Abstract
This thesis describes a data-driven technique for estimating the multijet
background to Supersymmetry (SUSY) searches with no leptons using the
ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The technique is used to
estimate multijet distributions in SUSY signal and control regions with
1 fb1 of
s = 7 TeV data collected by ATLAS in 2011. The systematic
uncertainty on the estimates is reduced with the development and use of
novel event shape triggers. Multijet estimates provided from the technique
developed in this thesis are used by the ATLAS collaboration in several
different SUSY searches.

Authors Contribution
The material presented in this thesis is based upon work performed by a large number
of people in the ATLAS collaboration. The authors contribution is summarised here.
Service Work
The author was responsible for maintaining and developing the Full Chain Testing
framework. This work is described in more detail in 4.6. The author also took
numerous Computing at Point 1 shifts; these involved monitoring the data flow
from the CERN Tier 0 computing farm to Tier 1 and Tier 2 sites around the world.
Trigger Development
The author developed and maintained the  triggers discussed in 7.4.3. As part of
this work, the author aided the validation of the L2 jet triggers, contributing plots to
a note on jet trigger performance [1]. The algorithms written for the  triggers were
also used for other event shape triggers including a trigger using the MCT variable [2]
for SUSY searches.
Multijet Background Estimation
The authors main contribution to the ATLAS collaboration was the development of
the jet smearing technique for estimating the multijet background to SUSY searches
with jets, EmissT and no leptons at ATLAS. The authors work was directly used for the
multijet estimation in several ATLAS papers [3, 4, 5]. The techniques developed have
also been used in several other SUSY searches including searches with b-jets [6, 7, 8]
and searches with high jet multiplicities [9]. The most up to date version of the jet
smearing method is described in this thesis in Chapters 6 to 8 and is also documented
in an internally approved ATLAS note [10].
Additional Contributions
The author has presented SUSY background studies at a number of meetings includ-
ing ATLAS UK 2009 in Oxford, where the author was awarded the poster prize;
ATLAS UK 2010 in Cambridge and Physics at the LHC 2010 in Hamburg, where
the author won the poster prize. The author has also presented results from the AT-
LAS collaboration on diphoton searches with EmissT and heavy long-lived charged
particles using the muon spectrometer at Physics at the LHC 2011 in Perugia.
Chapter 1
Introduction
The search for SUSY is one of the most important tasks for experimental particle
physicists. Searches using the particle detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
currently offer the best chance of directly discovering SUSY particles in nature. In
the searches using the ATLAS detector, the measurement of jet response and its use
for multijet background estimation is a vital part of this quest.
This thesis describes a data-driven technique for estimating the multijet back-
ground to fully hadronic searches for Supersymmetry (SUSY) at ATLAS. This in-
cludes the measurement of jet response, including its non-Gaussian tails, and the
development and use of novel event shape triggers to increase the sensitivity of this
measurement. The use of this technique on 1 fb1 of data collected by the ATLAS
experiment in 2011 is described.
Chapter 2 gives an overview of the Standard Model of particle physics and an
introduction to SUSY. The motivation for SUSY is explained, in that it provides a
solution to the hierarchy problem of the Higgs mechanism of electroweak symmetry
breaking. The current status of SUSY searches is then reviewed including strategies
for controlling and estimating the multijet background to fully hadronic searches
at hadron colliders. Chapter 3 describes the LHC and the ATLAS detector, with
particular emphasis on the calorimetry and trigger systems which are used in this
Introduction
thesis. Chapter 4 then describes the analysis tools used in this thesis, such as Monte
Carlo simulation and how physics objects are reconstructed using ATLAS. Chapter 5
gives details on the fully hadronic SUSY search performed at ATLAS, to which the
author contributed. The results from this search using 1 fb1 are presented.
Chapter 6 gives an overview of the jet smearing method for multijet background
estimation including the assumptions behind the technique and how low-EmissT data
seed events are selected. Chapter 7 then describes how jet smearing is used to measure
jet response at ATLAS, including the measurement of non-Gaussian response tails.
Novel event shape  triggers are then introduced and they are shown to provide
extra statistics for the measurement of non-Gaussian response. Chapter 8 describes
the use of jet smearing to provide the multijet estimation for the fully hadronic SUSY
search and presents the results of this analysis.
Chapter 9 gives a summary of this thesis and concludes. Future work which
could improve the techniques developed in this thesis is discussed.
Chapter 2
Theoretical and Experimental
Background
This chapter gives an overview of where the work of this thesis fits in the wider picture
of particle physics research and particularly in searches for Supersymmetry (SUSY) at
hadron colliders. 2.1 describes the Standard Model, including details on the strong
interaction and the Higgs mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. 2.2 then
introduces SUSY and explains its central ideas. The current progress in the search for
SUSY is briefly reviewed in 2.3. As yet there is no experimental evidence for SUSY,
the work in this thesis contributes to some of the latest and most sensitive searches
performed with ATLAS. Details of jet production and reconstruction in detectors
at hadron colliders are given in 2.4. The strategies for dealing with the multijet
background to SUSY searches with no leptons at hadron collider experiments are
discussed in 2.5, this is very relevant to the work in this thesis.
2.1 The Standard Model
The Standard Model (SM) (see e.g. [11]) is our most accurate mathematical descrip-
tion of the fundamental constituents of the universe and how they interact. It was
2.1. The Standard Model Theoretical and Experimental Background
formulated in the 1970s and succeeded in bringing together the electroweak and
quantum chromodynamic theories into an internally consistent framework. All of the
particles associated with the SM, with the exception of the Higgs boson, have been
experimentally observed. The SM cannot be a complete description of the universe as
it does not include gravity; furthermore, issues such as the gauge hierarchy problem
(see 2.1.3) and no dark matter candidate motivate extensions to the SM.
2.1.1 Particle Content
The SM is a quantum field theory and the excitations of the fields described by the SM
are the point-like fundamental particles which we observe in nature. The Lagrangian
of the theory is required to be gauge invariant; this means that the theory does
not depend on the space-time positions of the fields. To maintain this invariance,
additional gauge fields are included in the theory which provide the forces between
the particles. Particles in the SM possess internal angular momentum known as spin,
s . Matter particles (fermions) have half-integer spin s = 1/2 and the forces between
them are mediated by particles with integer spin (bosons). There are three forces in
the SM: the strong interaction, the weak interaction and electromagnetism. Fermions
which feel the strong interaction are known as quarks, otherwise they are known as
leptons. Table 2.1 shows the matter particles of the SM in the three generations which
have been observed, each generation containing a quark and lepton doublet. Table 2.2
shows the vector gauge bosons (excitations of the gauge fields) which mediate the
forces between the particles.
2.1.2 The Strong Interaction
The theory which governs the interactions of quarks and gluons is known as the strong
interaction, or Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The theory introduces a new type
of charge, known as colour charge, which is respected by the strong interaction in
the same way that electric charge is respected by electromagnetism. The strong in-
teraction is the strongest of the three forces and is mediated by the gluon which itself

carries colour charge. The strong interaction increases in strength with increasing dis-
tance; this property, coupled with the strength of the force, leads to the phenomenon
of confinement. Confinement dictates that particles carrying colour charge (quarks
and gluons, collectively known as partons) can only exist in bound states (hadrons).
Note that hadrons can be further subdivided into two groups: baryons, which contain
three quarks and mesons, which contain quark-antiquark pairs. Partons can only ex-
ist in bound states because the energy required to separate two partons is sufficient
to produce a quark-antiquark pair which can then bind to the original partons. If
a parton is given sufficient energy then it can produce many new pairs of particles
due to confinement, this is known as hadronisation. Hadronisation is observed in a

more detail in 2.4.
2.1.3 Electroweak Theory, the Higgs Mechanism and the Hierarchy
Problem
Electromagnetism and the weak force unify at  100 GeV and are described by the
electroweak theory. The four vector bosons which carry the electroweak interaction
are the photon, W+ , W and the Z . As shown in Table 2.2, the W and Z bosons
are observed to be massive. The mechanism for generating these masses in the SM,
without violating gauge invariance, is the Higgs mechanism [12]. A self-interacting
complex doublet scalar field is added to the theory which causes spontaneous sym-
metry breaking giving mass to the gauge bosons and fermions. The fermion masses
originate due to interactions between the Higgs scalar field and the fermionic fields
(interactions of this type are known as Yukawa couplings). The particle associated
with the Higgs field is the undiscovered Higgs boson. Although the mass of the Higgs
Boson is not predicted by the SM, other observables in the SM are sensitive to its
mass and these indicate a Higgs mass of less than 161 GeV [13]. Recent results from
the ATLAS experiment at the LHC indicate that Higgs mass lies between 115.5 GeV
and 131 GeV [14]. The probable low mass of the Higgs Boson conflicts with the fact
that radiative corrections to the Higgs mass (through such loop diagrams as shown
in 2.1) diverge quadratically up to a cut-off scale, , where the SM is no longer valid.
If the SM is valid up to high energies then extreme amounts of fine-tuning to the bare
Higgs are required to keep the observed mass at  100 GeV. This unfeasible amount
of fine-tuning is known as the hierarchy problem.
2.2. Supersymmetry Theoretical and Experimental Background
Figure 2.1: Example of a one-loop diagram which contributes to the Higgs mass
squared.
2.2 Supersymmetry
Supersymmetry (SUSY) hypothesises a symmetry between bosons and fermions. For
every SM particle, a partner particle (sparticle) is introduced with a spin quantum
number which differs by one half. Furthermore, no particles currently observed can be
partners of other SM particles and therefore a wealth of new undiscovered particles is
predicted. The motivation for the theory is that each sparticle will contribute to the
radiative corrections to the Higgs mass discussed in 2.1.3. Their contributions will be
opposite to the SM particles hence cancelling the divergences and removing the need
for fine-tuning the bare Higgs mass. SUSY, if it exists, must be a broken symmetry as
the sparticle masses must be much higher than their SM particle partners (otherwise
they would have already been observed). Various mechanisms have been proposed
for the breaking of the theory, more details are given later in this section.
In most SUSY models, a multiplicative conservation law is applied on a quantity
known as R-parity:
R = (1)3(BL)+2s, (2.1)
where B is baryon number and L is lepton number. SM particles have even R-parity
and sparticles have odd R-parity. The conservation law is imposed otherwise SUSY
models would predict (amongst other things) proton decay. This naturally leads to
the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) being stable as there is no kinematically
allowed decay to a sparticle and decays to SM particles would violate R-parity. At
2.2. Supersymmetry Theoretical and Experimental Background
the high energies present shortly after the big bang, sparticles would have been pro-
duced copiously and then would each have decayed into a LSP. If the LSP is weakly
interacting then these stable sparticles naturally provide a dark matter candidate.
R-parity conservation also has important consequences for collider experiments such
as the LHC:
 Sparticles must always be produced in pairs.
 Any sparticle will eventually decay into the LSP which is stable. If the LSP
has no electric charge and is weakly interacting (as is required for SUSY to
provide a dark matter candidate) then the LSP will leave a particle detector
unobserved. Its presence can only be inferred from momentum imbalance of the
observed particles.
As there is yet to be any experimental evidence for SUSY or measurements of
SUSY parameters, the theory is largely unconstrained. Given the large number of
additional particles postulated by the theory, there are a vast number of free param-
eters and therefore possible SUSY models. Assumptions need to be made to group
these models to allow their predictions to be tested with experimental observations.
The simplest possible SUSY model which is consistent with the SM is called the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). It postulates the smallest num-
ber of new particles and does not specify the mechanism for SUSY being a broken
symmetry. Two favoured models which are based on the MSSM, but which do spec-
ify how SUSY breaking occurs, are the constrained MSSM (cMSSM) and minimal
supergravity (mSUGRA) [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. In both of these models, gravitational
interactions mediate SUSY breaking. These models are closely related and rely on
only five parameters including the common boson mass, m0 and the common fermion
mass, m1/2 . Exclusion limits for these models are often shown in the m0,m1/2 plane.
It should be noted that in the MSSM, the observable mass eigenstates are mixings of
different sparticles. For example, the neutralino is the electromagnetically neutral
mass eigenstate and the chargino is the charged mass eigenstate of the mixing of
the sparticle partners of gauge and Higgs bosons. In many models, the LSP is the
neutralino (01 ).
2.3. Current Status of SUSY Searches Theoretical and Experimental Background
Recently, effort has been made to produce a set of simple models (containing
few parameters) which are based on the expected phenomenology of SUSY models
but dispense with much of the complexity associated with them [20]. These are
known as simplified models and are intended to provide a framework to describe
any SUSY-like excess which may be observed in LHC data.
2.3 Current Status of SUSY Searches
LEP, the Tevatron and the LHC have performed wide-reaching searches for signs that
SUSY exists in nature. There is yet to be any experimental evidence for sparticle
production. Searches for squarks ( q ) and gluinos ( g ), the super-partners of quarks
and gluons respectively, are most relevant to this thesis and are summarised in this
section.
2.3.1 SUSY Searches at Past Colliders
Before recent results from the LHC, LEP and the Tevatron provided the most strin-
gent limits on searches for squarks and gluinos. Gluino production is forbidden at
LEP as the gluino does not interact electroweakly. In squark searches, exclusion
results from LEP are generally much less stringent than results from the Tevatron.
However, in the stop (the SUSY partner of the top quark) sector, LEP still provides
some useful information. For example, in searches for acoplanar jets with missing
energy, stop masses from 96 to 99 GeV are excluded in the case of mtm01mc > 5
GeV [21].
The Tevatron, before its deactivation, ran at a centre-of-mass energy of 1.96
TeV, substantially higher than 209 GeV achieved at LEP. This results in its mass reach
for SUSY particles being much larger than at LEP. However, the search is complicated
by the fact that the momenta of the colliding partons are unknown. Furthermore,
the relative cross-sections between new physics processes and background processes
(such as inelastic scattering and multijet production) is much higher than at LEP.
2.3. Current Status of SUSY Searches Theoretical and Experimental Background
In the pp collisions at the Tevatron, coloured SUSY particles will have the highest
production cross-section. Both squark and gluino production are possible depending
on the SUSY model, but in both cases the final state consists of a number of jets and
missing transverse energy (EmissT ). Backgrounds to these searches are of two types,
those involving real EmissT (e.g. W  l + jets) and those involving fake EmissT from
jet mismeasurement. The exclusion results from CDF and D are interpreted in the
mSUGRA framework in Figures 2.2 and 2.3.

2.3.2 SUSY Searches at the LHC
Direct searches have been performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. SUSY
searches at ATLAS can be broadly split into two types:
 Signatures involving significant EmissT and multiple jets. These are the primary
discovery channels for most general SUSY models and include the zero lepton
analysis which is described in more detail in Chapter 5. They are defined by
the number of leptons in the final state and whether b-jets are required. In
these searches, the primary production mechanisms are squark and gluino pair
2.3. Current Status of SUSY Searches Theoretical and Experimental Background
production since they couple to the strong interaction.
 Searches for long-lived exotic massive particles and for signatures of R-parity
violating SUSY. There are a number of signatures which can be studied, includ-
ing searching for particles which stop in the detector and decay at a later time,
monojet analyses and searches for highly displayed vertices.
The searches with jets and EmissT are most relevant to this thesis and are summarised
in this section.
The analysis involving jets, EmissT and no leptons [5] is described in Chapter 5. It
provides the largest discovery reach for squark and gluinos as discussed in Chapter 5.
A related search is for events containing two b-jets, EmissT and no leptons [7]. This
search is particularly sensitive to the pair production of scalar bottom quarks (the
sparticle equivalent of b-quarks) decaying to b-quarks and neutralinos. In MSSM
models where this is the exclusive decay mechanism for scalar bottom quarks, the
mass of these squarks is excluded beneath 390 GeV for neutralino masses below 60
GeV. ATLAS has also performed a search for high jet multiplicities ( 6 jets) with
no leptons [9]; unlike other searches described in this section there is no direct EmissT
cut used. This search is sensitive to SUSY models predicting many-body decays or
large cascade decays to partons. It extends the exclusion reach in mSUGRA/cMSSM
models in certain regions of the m0,m1/2 plane above that found in the main jets,
EmissT and no lepton analysis.
Searches involving jets, EmissT and leptons are characterised by the lepton mul-
tiplicity. Squarks and gluinos are expected to decay into SM quarks and charginos
or neutralinos. The charginos (i ) and neutralinos (
i ) can decay into SM leptons
through the following main processes: 0i  lj , i  l0j , 0i  ll0j and
i  llj , where i > j and i > 0. It should be noted that l refers to any
SM lepton but the searches described in this section only deal with electrons and
muons due to the short lifetime of the tau lepton. The processes shown above allow
for a variety of final state lepton multiplicities. The one lepton search [24] searches
for an excess of events with one lepton, jets and EmissT and produces exclusion lim-
its in mSUGRA/CMSSM models which are not as stringent as those from the no
2.4. Jets at Hadron Colliders Theoretical and Experimental Background
lepton search. The two lepton search [25] is split into searches for same-sign lep-
tons and opposite-sign leptons. The opposite-sign search also looks for an excess of
same-flavour over different-flavour lepton pairs. Limits are set in a simplified model
(see 2.2) of weak gaugino (the sparticle partner of a SM gauge boson) production.
Finally, the multi-lepton search [26] uses signatures with four or more leptons to pro-
vide cross-section limits on processes creating four or more leptons (with and without
a veto on Z bosons).
CMS also has a wide programme for SUSY searches including searches involving
leptons, b-jets and Z bosons. The fully hadronic searches (without a b-jet require-
ment) are the most relevant to this thesis. These searches at CMS are split into four
different search strategies:
 Using the T variable [27]. T is a kinematic variable which is designed to
distinguish between real and fake EmissT .
 Using the MT2 variable [28]. MT2 was originally introduced to measure sparticle
masses but in this search it is used as a discovery variable.
 Using razor variables [29]. This search is designed to distinguish between pair
produced heavy particles (like squarks and gluinos) and pair produced SM par-
ticles.
 Using missing energy [30].
In all cases, no evidence of SUSY is found so exclusion limits are published. Figure 2.4
gives an overview of the exclusions from a variety of different searches at CMS; the
fully hadronic searches mentioned above are the most sensitive.
2.4 Jets at Hadron Colliders
The theory of QCD is briefly outlined in 2.1.2 and it is noted that high energy partons
form jets in a detector. This section will expand on this process as it is extremely
2.4. Jets at Hadron Colliders Theoretical and Experimental Background

plane. From [31].
relevant to this thesis. Taking the example of a simple qq  qq hard scatter at the
LHC: firstly, two hard quarks are produced in the interaction. Additional partons
are radiated from the incoming quarks (initial state radiation) and from the outgoing
quarks (final state radiation). The other partons in the colliding protons will also
interact (multi-parton interactions). This is generally, with the initial state radiation,
referred to as the underlying event. Any outgoing partons from the hard interaction
or radiation will then shower; this accounts for quark-antiquark pairs produced from
gluons and gluon radiation from gluons and quarks. Each shower of outgoing partons
will then hadronise to form a co-linear collection of colour neutral hadrons. These
collections of hadrons are referred to as jets and will interact in the tracking system
and deposit energy in the calorimetry of a particle detector.
It is impossible to uniquely define what constitutes a jet in a detector. For ex-
ample, a jet may correspond to the group of hadrons produced from a single outgoing
hard parton, but it may also be from a number of co-linear hard partons or even a
2.5. Multijet Background Theoretical and Experimental Background
boosted W decaying into a pair of quarks. In these cases, the object reconstructed
in the detector can be indistinguishable. Therefore, experiments must decide their
criteria for a jet and understand that this does not map directly to a parton pro-
duced in the pp interaction. Jets are then defined in experiments from the choice of
jet algorithm. These use input from either theoretical objects (simulated partons or
hadrons) or detector quantities like energy deposits in the calorimetry or tracks. The
following are desirable properties for jet algorithms:
 Collinear safe. This means that a reconstructed jet should not be affected if a
parton in the jet splits into two collinear partons. Non-collinear safe algorithms
produce divergences in theoretical calculations.
 Infra-red safe. The reconstructed jet must be unaffected by the emission of a
small amount of soft radiation. As with collinear safety, if the algorithm is not
infra-red safe then theoretical calculations contain divergences.
 Well-defined area. To allow simple isolation and overlap removal to be applied,
it is desirable that jets have well defined areas, usually in a conical shape.
 Computationally fast.
ATLAS uses the anti-kt algorithm [32] for jet reconstruction. This algorithm sat-
isfies all of the above desirable criteria for a jet algorithm and provides a natural
replacement for iterative cone algorithm which is collinear unsafe.
2.5 Multijet Background
At the Tevatron and LHC, the cross section for multijet production is extremely
large. For example, Figure 2.5 shows that, at
s = 7 TeV, the cross section for
jet production with E
T > 100 GeV is higher than the cross section for W and
Z boson production. Multijet production refers to any reconstructed events with
multiple jets and no prompt isolated electrons or muons and is dominated by processes
2.5. Multijet Background Theoretical and Experimental Background
mediated by the strong force. Multijet events can contain significant missing energy
through jet mismeasurement and due to the presence of neutrinos in heavy flavour
jets. Therefore it is a potentially significant background for fully hadronic SUSY
searches. This section will briefly discuss the various strategies used at the Tevatron
and LHC experiments.

2.5. Multijet Background Theoretical and Experimental Background
2.5.1 Multijet Strategy at Tevatron Searches
Full details of the fully hadronic search at CDF are given in [22]. At CDF, high EmissT
multijet events are primarily due to significant jet mismeasurement and not from
heavy flavour jets containing neutrinos. In these events the EmissT will most likely
align along the direction of one of the jets in the event. For this reason, CDF cut
on the azimuthal angle between the jet and EmissT for selected jets in the event. The
remaining multijet background is estimated from Monte Carlo (MC) and the validity
of the MC estimate is checked in multijet dominated control regions. The multijet
background is significant in the signal regions considered, as shown in Table 2.3.

Full details of the fully hadronic search with D can be found in [23]. As at CDF,
the multijet background at D is primarily due to calorimetric jet mismeasurement
and cuts are applied on the azimuthal angle between the jets and EmissT to significantly
reduce the background. D estimate the remaining multijet background using a data-
driven method where the EmissT spectrum is fitted with an exponential function in the
low-EmissT region (after the subtraction of other non-multijet sources of E
T ). The
fit is then extrapolated to the high EmissT signal regions providing an estimate of the
2.5. Multijet Background Theoretical and Experimental Background
multijet background in those regions. In all of the signal regions considered, the
estimated background is sufficiently small to be ignored in setting limits.
2.5.2 Multijet Strategy at LHC Searches
The multijet estimation in fully hadronic searches at ATLAS is the subject of this
thesis and will be described in detail in Chapters 6 to 8. At CMS, the four searches
introduced in 2.3.2 have differing strategies to the multijet background. The searches
using the T [27], MT2 [28] and razor [29] variables rely on reducing the background
to a negligible level using a combination (depending on the search) of azimuthal cuts
between the jets and EmissT , hard cuts on the discovery variable and b-tagging. The
missing energy search [30] also uses an azimuthal cut between the jets and EmissT
to reduce the multijet background and the remaining background is estimated using
a Rebalance and Smear method. This method uses similar techniques to those
described in this thesis: jets in a sample of data events with low EmissT are scaled (or
smeared) with a data-measured response function to produce events with potentially
high EmissT . This sample is used as the multijet estimation in the signal regions.
Table 2.4 shows the data observation and estimated backgrounds for the signal regions
in this search; it can be seen that the multijet background is small compared to the
other SM processes.

The LHC and the ATLAS Detector
This chapter provides a brief introduction to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and
the ATLAS detector. 3.1 describes the LHC, notable achievements of the collider
and its future goals. 3.2 describes the ATLAS detector; emphasis is given to the
systems which allow jet and missing transverse momentum (EmissT ) reconstruction and
to the trigger system (see 3.2.5). ATLAS provides precision energy measurements
of electromagnetic and hadronic showers and is near-hermetic, making it an ideal
detector for measuring jets and EmissT .
3.1 The Large Hadron Collider
The LHC is the highest energy collider experiment ever built. It is a proton-proton
collider running at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and in the dataset considered
in this thesis, reached a peak luminosity of  1033 cm2s1 . It is housed in the 27
km tunnel which was previously home to the LEP collider at CERN. It also uses
many of the existing accelerator facilities of CERN. Proton beams are collided at
four locations around the ring where the main LHC detector experiments are located:
ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. Some of the design parameters of the LHC are
shown in Table 3.1. A schematic of the accelerator complex is shown in Figure 3.1.

The LHC has a vast physics programme to fully utilise the extremely high energy
and luminosity delivered. Primary goals include the observation of the Higgs boson
(see 2.1.3), the search for physics beyond the SM, including SUSY (see 2.2), and
for precision measurements of SM processes. In order to realise these goals, general
purpose (ATLAS and CMS) and specialised (ALICE and LHCb) particle detectors
are located at collision points on the LHC ring. The work in this thesis is performed
using the ATLAS detector.
During 2010 and 2011, the LHC ran with beam energies of 3.5 TeV per beam
pushing particle physics into a new energy realm. At the time of writing, the LHC
has now delivered over 5 fb1 of data to the ATLAS and CMS detectors. This has
allowed precision SM physics to be performed and many models for physics beyond
the SM have been tested to extents beyond what was possible using results from the
Tevatron. Particular successes of the LHC are the achievement of the highest peak
luminosity at a hadron collider [36] and limiting the available mass range of the SM
Higgs to a small window between  115 GeV and  141 GeV [14, 37]. In 2012, the
LHC will run with an energy of 4 TeV per beam [38] and aims to collect 15 fb1 in
order to finalise the search for the SM Higgs boson. After 2012, the LHC will undergo

a period of repairs and upgrades to allow it to reach its design energy in 2014-2015.
3.2 The ATLAS Detector
The ATLAS detector, A Toroidal LHC Apparatus is amongst the most complex
detectors ever built. It is designed as a general purpose detector and is optimised to
search for the Higgs boson, physics beyond the SM and to perform precision SM mea-
surements. To allow this, it has a near hermetic design with precise particle tracking,
calorimetry and muon detection systems. The sub-detector most important in the
reconstruction of jets and missing energy is the calorimeter (see 3.2.3); however, the
other sub-detectors are also essential. A schematic of the entire detector is shown in
Figure 3.2. Full details of the detector can be found in [39].
3.2. The ATLAS Detector The LHC and the ATLAS Detector
Figure 3.2: Schematic of the ATLAS detector. From [39].
3.2.1 Geometry and Transverse Quantities
The z -axis of the ATLAS detector is aligned along the beam pipe. The x-axis points
towards the centre of the LHC ring and the y -axis points vertically upwards. However,
as a cylindrical detector, cylindrical polar coordinates are commonly used where the
azimuthal angle  is measured around the z -axis and the polar angle  is the angle
from the z -axis. Pseudorapidity is defined as  =  ln tan(/2). This is widely used
instead of  as it is invariant under Lorentz boosts. The distance R in  space
is defined as R =
()2 + ()2 and is often used to define the separation of
physics objects reconstructed in the detector.
At the LHC, the hard scatter in a collision occurs between partons which carry
an unknown proportion of the momenta of the protons. This means that momen-
tum conservation can only be applied transverse to the beam axis. For this reason,
transverse quantities such as pT (transverse momentum) are commonly used.
3.2. The ATLAS Detector The LHC and the ATLAS Detector
3.2.2 Inner Detector
The purpose of the inner detector is to precisely reconstruct the tracks of charged
particles originating from (or near to) the interaction point. To allow this, three sub-
detectors are used: the pixel detector, semiconductor tracker (SCT) and transition
radiation tracker (TRT). The pixel and SCT (the precision trackers) cover a pseudo-
rapidity range of || < 2.5. The entire inner detector is immersed in a 2 T magnetic
field created by the central solenoid magnet. This magnetic field results in charged
particles following curved trajectories, allowing their momenta to be measured from
the radius of curvature. A schematic of the inner detector is shown in Figure 3.3.
Figure 3.3: Schematic of the ATLAS inner detector. From [39].
Pixel Detector
The pixel detector is the closest detector to the interaction point and has the highest
granularity of any of the sub-detectors in ATLAS. This is primarily to allow accurate
locating of any secondary vertices in an event. The pixel detector contains three
layers of silicon pixel arrays which have minimum pixel size in R    z space of
3.2. The ATLAS Detector The LHC and the ATLAS Detector
50  400 m2 (R is the perpendicular distance from the z axis). This allows an
accuracy of 10 m 115 m in R  z space.
The SCT provides further, coarser tracking measurements than the pixel detector. It
uses layers of paired silicon microstrips, with 80 m pitch, to give three-dimensional
tracking. Particles cross eight silicon layers through the SCT providing four space-
points for track reconstruction. The resolution of the SCT in the barrel is 17 m 
580 m in R  z space.
The TRT uses straw tubes to provide tracking measurements in R    z space.
The TRT provides a large number of hits (36 per track) which makes a significant
impact to momenta measurements of tracks. It also assists particle identification as
the amount of transition radiation increases with particle velocity; therefore at a given
energy electrons can be identified as the particles which produce the most transition
radiation.
3.2.3 Calorimetry
ATLAS uses two sampling calorimeter systems (electromagnetic and hadronic) to
accurately measure the energy deposited by different particles in the detector. The
calorimeter is the most important component in the measurement of jets and EmissT
in ATLAS. It provides precision measurements in the central region of the detector,
|| < 2.5, and coverage up to || < 4.9. This large range is vital in the measurement
of EmissT as it ensures that the energies of all particles with significant transverse
momenta can be measured. The calorimeter also has large depth (approximately ten
interaction lengths) to limit punch-through of high momenta particles into the muon
3.2. The ATLAS Detector The LHC and the ATLAS Detector
system and to fully contain hadronic showers. A schematic of the ATLAS calorimeter
is shown in Figure 3.4.
Figure 3.4: Schematic of the ATLAS calorimeter. From [39].
Both calorimeters are made up from a large number of individual cells and
particles traversing the calorimetry will deposit energy in many of these cells. To
provide an input to jet algorithms (see 2.4), the cells are grouped into clusters
with a clustering algorithm. Examples of clustering algorithms are the sliding window
and topological cluster algorithms.
Electromagnetic Calorimeter
The electromagnetic calorimeter is divided into a barrel region covering || < 1.475
and two end-caps covering 1.375 < || < 3.2. The active material is liquid-argon
and the absorber is lead. Accordion-shaped kapton electrodes provide the readout,
which has complete  coverage. There are three sampling layers in the || < 2.5
region and two in the 2.5 < || < 3.2 region. As shown in Table 3.2, the first
sampling layer in the central region has very fine  resolution to allow accurate
3.2. The ATLAS Detector The LHC and the ATLAS Detector
estimation of the  coordinate of an electromagnetic shower. The second layer collects
the majority of the energy of a shower and the third collects the tail of the shower
with reduced granularity. There is a presampler present in the region || < 1.8 to
allow corrections for energy lost in material upstream of the calorimeter. It should
be noted that the majority of the energy in a typical hadronic shower is absorbed
in the electromagnetic calorimeter so this sub-detector is vital in measuring both
electromagnetic and hadronic objects. For much of the dataset used in this thesis,
an electronics failure resulted in there being a dead region in two layers of the barrel
region of the electromagnetic calorimeter. This is referred to as the LAr hole.
It affects the reconstruction of any physics objects which use the electromagnetic
calorimeter including electrons, jets and EmissT .

Hadronic Calorimeter
The hadronic calorimeter consists of three subsystems: the tile calorimeter, the
hadronic end-cap (HEC) and the forward calorimeter (FCal). The tile calorimeter
covers the range || < 1.7. It uses steel absorbers with scintillating tiles as the active
medium and has three layers. The HEC uses LAr as the active medium and copper
as the absorber and is arranged to provide four sampling layers per end-cap. It covers
the pseudorapidity range 1.5 < || < 3.2. The FCal (covering 3.1 < || < 4.9) also
uses LAr as the active medium and uses copper (in the inner module) and tungsten
(in the outer two modules) as the absorber. The overlap between the tile and FCal
reduces the loss in material density. Table 3.3 shows some key parameters of the
hadronic calorimeter. Coverage is provided up to || = 4.9 with at least 3 sampling
layers providing near-hermetic coverage.
3.2.4 Muon System
The muon system of ATLAS forms the outer part of the detector and a significant
fraction of the detectors volume. Superconducting air-core toroid magnets provide
up to 7.4 Tm of bending power meaning that even the momenta of the highest energy
muons can be determined. There are four detection sub-systems in the muon system:
monitored drift tubes (MDT), cathode strip chambers (CSC), resistive plate chambers
(RPC) and thin gap chambers (TPG). The MDT and CSC provide the precision
tracking measurements whilst the RPC and TPG form the muon trigger system and
give a second coordinate for muon track reconstruction.
3.2.5 Trigger and Data Acquisition
The design luminosity of 1034 cm2s1 translates to an event rate of  109 Hz;
however, computing resources mean that only  200 Hz can be permanently stored.
This means the trigger system must select roughly 1 in 5  106 events. This is
made possible through a three stage trigger system consisting of one hardware trigger

(level 1) and two software triggers (level 2 and event filter, collectively known as the
High Level Trigger (HLT)). The trigger works at the electromagnetic energy scale (no
corrections are applied for hadrons).
The level 1 (L1) trigger uses calorimeter information (with reduced granularity
of 0.1 0.1 in   in most regions) and the muon trigger system to trigger on
high momenta leptons, jets and event quantities such as EmissT and
ET . The L1
trigger must decide within 2.5 s whether an event should be passed to L2 for further
analysis. Given this need for extremely fast processing and the lack of full detector
infromation at L1, thresholds applied to physics objects are looser than appiled in
the HLT. There is a maximum L1 output rate  75 kHz. The L1 trigger also defines
regions of interest (RoIs) in  space for the level 2 trigger to analyse. These RoIs
are located in the regions of the detector where the L1 trigger finds objects satisfying

energy thresholds defined in the L1 trigger menu (see 4.4 for information on trigger
menus).
The level 2 (L2) trigger uses the full detector granularity but only investigates
the RoIs identified by the L1 trigger. Software algorithms are used which are more
sophisticated than the L1 algorithms but not yet at the level of the offline algorithms
due to the requirement for fast processing of  10 ms. The L2 output rate is  1
The event filter (EF) trigger uses the full event information and some offline
algorithms to analyse the events passed by the L2 trigger to reduce the output rate
to  200 Hz. The trigger has  1 s to make its decision and hence there is insufficient
time to perform processing identical to that done offline; for example there is no Jet
Energy Scale correction (see 4.3.3) applied to event filter jets.
Chapter 4
Analysis Tools
This chapter describes the analysis tools common to much of the work described in
this thesis. 4.1 describes the dataset used throughout. 4.2 gives an overview of the
simulation and reconstruction framework used by ATLAS and details the samples
of Monte Carlo simulated data used. 4.3 describes how physics objects are recon-
structed covering objects relevant to this thesis, overlap removal and event cleaning.
In 4.4 and 4.5, information is given on trigger menus and the single jet triggers used
extensively in the analysis detailed in this thesis. Finally, 4.6 describes the full chain
testing performed at ATLAS to check for problems in the full production chain; the
author performed service work for the experiment in this area.
4.1 Data Samples
The data used in this analysis were recorded by the ATLAS experiment from 22nd
March 2011 to 28th June 2011 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb1
after the application of the official SUSY group Good Run List (GRL)1. ATLAS splits
its collected data events into different streams depending on which triggers are fired
1A GRL indicates which periods of data taking are appropriate for a particular physics analysis,
with the appropriate sub-detectors active and functioning correctly.

by an event. This is convenient as events useful for lepton physics are not generally
useful for fully hadronic searches. This thesis uses the JetTauEtMiss stream, which
contains events where jet,  lepton or EmissT triggers have fired.
4.2 Simulation and Reconstruction Software
Event simulation consists of three stages: event generation, detector simulation and
digitisation. Event generation produces the idealised, particle level event before de-
tector effects are included. Detector simulation then passes these events through a
model of the full detector using GEANT4 [40]. The digitisation is designed to match
the real detector so that the input to reconstruction is identical for real and simulated
data.
Monte Carlo (MC) samples are produced using the available generator which is
most appropriate for the required final state and the number of events needed. Gen-
erators used at ATLAS compute either the Leading-Order (LO) or Next-to-Leading-
Order (NLO) contributions to a given process. Furthermore, some generators only
compute the matrix elements for the hard interaction process whilst others calculate
the elements for extra radiated hard partons. All generators require the input of Par-
ton Density Functions (PDFs), which describe the probability of a collided parton
having a given momentum fraction of its parent proton. At ATLAS, LO genera-
tors use the MRST2007LO* modified LO PDFs [41] and NLO generators use CTEQ6.6
PDFs [42]. As well as simulating the hard process, generators also need to simulate
the parton showers, hadronisation, decays and the underlying event (see 2.4). The
generators used for MC samples in this thesis are described below:
 Multijet production: PYTHIA [43]. This generator works at LO and only cal-
culates the matrix elements for the hard process. This means that it may not
properly simulate events with more than two hard partons. However, it per-
forms all steps of generation in one package. This makes it an good choice for
producing the large number of simulated multijet events needed at a hadron
4.3. Object Reconstruction Analysis Tools
collider experiment.
 Top quark pair production: MC@NLO [44, 45] (with a top quark mass of 172.5
GeV). MC@NLO is a NLO generator which only calculates the matrix elements
for the hard process. It is interfaced with HERWIG [46, 47] for performing parton
showering, hadronisation and decays. JIMMY [48] is used for simulating the
underlying event.
 W and Z production with accompanying jets: ALPGEN [49]. This generator
works at LO but calculates the matrix elements for both the hard process and
radiated hard partons. This makes is ideal for producing electroweak bosons
with accompanying jets. It is also interfaced with HERWIG and JIMMY.
All MC samples are produced using the ATLAS MC10b parameter tune [50, 51] and
a GEANT4 [40] based detector simulation. All simulation and reconstruction software
is integrated into the ATHENA [52] framework used by ATLAS.
For the plots produced throughout this thesis, MC distributions are scaled to
the data luminosity unless specified otherwise; this is often the case for the multijet
MC where the normalisation requires a correction factor as the cross-section from
PYTHIA deviates from that observed in data by  30%.
4.3 Object Reconstruction
The purpose of object reconstruction in ATLAS is to build analysis objects and
event quantities which match as closely as possible what occurred in the detector
following a collision. Firstly, standalone objects are reconstructed by the various
detector subsystems; for example the ID and muon systems identify tracks and the
calorimetry identifies areas of energy deposition. Combined reconstruction then pools
this information together, removing overlap and constructs the final physics objects
such as jets, muons and EmissT .
4.3. Object Reconstruction Analysis Tools
4.3.1 Electrons
Events containing electrons isolated from any jets are vetoed throughout the analysis
detailed in this thesis. Electrons are identified using an algorithm which is seeded by
energy deposited in clusters in the EM calorimeter. The clusters are then matched to
tracks in the inner detector. The main aim of electron reconstruction is to maintain
a high reconstruction efficiency whilst providing good rejection against jets faking
electrons. To achieve this, selection is applied on a range of discriminating variables:
 Calorimeter shower shapes.
 Leakage into the hadronic calorimeter.
 Inner detector track quality.
 Track-cluster matching.
Electrons which pass these cuts, are not located in the LAr hole (see 3.2.3) and have
pT > 20 GeV are referred to as candidate electrons and used in the overlap removal
described in 4.3.4. Note that a smearing procedure is applied to the momenta of
electrons in MC to match what is observed in the data.
4.3.2 Muons
Events containing muons isolated from jets are vetoed in the analysis described in this
thesis. Muons are reconstructed with an algorithm (STACO) which uses the track
found in the Muon Spectrometer (MS) as well as the track in the Inner Detector
(ID) [39]. Two types of muons are used: combined muons which are made from
tracks that have been independently reconstructed in both systems using the STACO
algorithm and segment-tagged muons which use the MS to tag ID tracks as muons,
without requiring a fully reconstructed MS track. Requirements are imposed on the
number of hits in different layers of the ID and track quality is assessed based on
information from the TRT. Finally, muons are required to have pT > 10 GeV; they
4.3. Object Reconstruction Analysis Tools
are then referred to as muon candidates and are used in the overlap removal described
in 4.3.4. Note that a smearing procedure is applied to the momenta of muons in MC
to match what is observed in the data.
4.3.3 Jets and Missing Transverse Energy
Jet production and reconstruction are introduced in 2.4. For the analysis described
in this thesis, jets are reconstructed using the anti-kt jet algorithm [32] with distance
parameter R = 0.4 (in y   space). This algorithm is both infra-red and collinear
safe and also benefits from being computationally efficient and provides jets with a
fixed size. Inputs to the anti-kt algorithm are topological clusters (see 3.2.3). The
topological cluster algorithm [53] works by first finding seed cells in the calorimeter
above a primary noise threshold level. Neighbouring cells are then added to the
cluster if they have energy greater than a secondary noise threshold. This process
is continued for all cells neighbouring any primary or secondary cells until there are
no more adjacent cells with energy greater than the secondary threshold. Finally,
any cells neighbouring the cluster with energy greater than a third noise threshold
are also included. The clustering and initial jet reconstruction is performed at the
electromagnetic scale. The transverse momenta of the jets are then corrected (as a
function of jet pT and  ) through Jet Numerical Inversion Correction [54] to account
for the difference in response between hadrons and electrons in the detector. This is
known as the Jet Energy Scale (JES) correction. The JES correction increases the
energy of a typical jet by  40%. Finally, the position of a jet is corrected to point at
the primary vertex of the interaction. Jets arising from b-quarks are identified with
an algorithm which uses impact parameter and secondary vertex information [55].
In this analysis, jets must have pT > 20 GeV and || < 2.8. All jets passing
this loose selection are considered when applying the overlap removal described in
4.3.4. Jet quality cuts are applied to jets after overlap removal, at which point
events containing at least one jet failing these quality cuts are rejected (see 4.3.5).
Missing transverse momentum is calculated with an object-based EmissT algo-

rithm. Clusters are first matched to reconstructed physics objects in the following
order: electrons, jets and muons. Any remaining clusters, not matched to an object,
are included in a Cellout term. The EmissT is given by the following formula:

4.3.4 Resolving Overlapping Objects
When candidates passing the object selection overlap with each other, a classification
is required to remove all but one of the overlapping objects. All overlap criteria are
based on the simple geometric R =
2 + 2 variable and based on previous
studies at ATLAS [56]. They are applied in the following order:
1 If an electron and a jet are found within R < 0.2, the object is interpreted as
an electron and the overlapping jet is ignored.
2 If a muon and a jet are found within R < 0.4, the object is treated as a jet
and the muon is ignored.
3 If an electron and a jet are found within 0.2  R < 0.4, the object is in-
terpreted as a jet and the nearby electron is ignored. This is an isolation
requirement.
4.3. Object Reconstruction Analysis Tools
4.3.5 Event Cleaning
Event cleaning is applied to match the standard SUSY analysis. The cleaning is de-
signed to reject events containing jets originating from non-collision sources. Firstly,
a primary vertex is required with at least five tracks associated with it to ensure the
presence of a hard interaction which jets can originate from. Jets originating from
non-collision sources have the following criteria where the cuts are applied with a
logical OR condition:
 A large fraction of the energy of the jet (> 0.5) is deposited in the HEC with
more than half of the cells flagged as having bad quality. These can be dead
or particularly noisy cells.
 A large fraction of energy of the jet (> 0.95) is deposited in the EM calorimeter
where a large proportion of the cells (> 0.8) are flagged as having bad quality.
 The jet is measured over an anomalously long time compared to the event time
(> 25 ns).
 A very low proportion of its energy (< 0.05) is deposited in the EM calorimeter
and the sum of the momenta of the tracks of the jet is small compared to the
calorimetric pT measurement (|ptrkT |/pjetT < 0.05).
 The fractional amount of energy measured in one layer of the calorimeter is very
high (> 0.99).
Events containing a jet passing any of these criteria are vetoed. Events are also
rejected if the average jet time is very low (< 5 ns) or if a noise spike is observed
in the LAr calorimeter. Finally, events are rejected if one of the leading four jets in
the event (after overlap removal) with pT > 40 GeV points into the LAr hole region
(see 3.2.3).
4.4. Trigger Menus Analysis Tools
4.4 Trigger Menus
The trigger system used by ATLAS, described in 3.2.5, uses a trigger menu to
decide what properties of an event should be triggered on. The menu is made up from
a set of individual trigger items. A trigger item might require an electron or jet with
a certain pT threshold. Trigger items also include event-wide properties such as E
or angles between physics objects. The naming convention for trigger items is usually
the type of object followed by the pT threshold and then details of the algorithm. For
example the j240 a4tc EFFS trigger item requires a jet with pT > 240 GeV; it uses
the anti-kt algorithm [32] with a distance parameter of 0.4 (a4) and it uses topological
clusters (see 4.3.3) with the event filter in full scan (tc EFFS) mode. Full scan mode
means that the entire event is analysed by the event filter algorithms and not just
items identified by the L1 and L2 triggers. A trigger item will actually correspond
to a chain of decisions with one decision made at each level of the trigger system.
For example the j240 a4tc EFFS trigger corresponds to requiring a jet at L1 with
pT > 75 GeV, a jet at L2 with pT > 95 GeV and an EF jet with pT > 240 GeV.
The thresholds increase with the trigger level as the rate reduction must increase as
described in 3.2.5.
Some trigger items would output too high an event rate to be usable if it were not
for the use of prescaling. A trigger item with a prescale of 10 will only record one in
10 of the events which would pass the normal requirements of the trigger. Prescaling
allows a manageable amount of data to be collected from commonly occurring events;
this is the case for single jet triggers with low pT thresholds such as the j55 a4tc EFFS
trigger item.
The trigger menu and prescaling vary with the instantaneous luminosity deliv-
ered by the LHC to ATLAS. For example, in early runs in 2011, the relatively low
instantaneous luminosity meant the j55 a4tc EFFS trigger could be run unprescaled;
however, in later runs the trigger was given a prescale of more than 2000. Trigger
items can also be deactivated with increasing luminosity or with the availability of
improved algorithms.
4.5. Single Jet Triggers Analysis Tools
4.5 Single Jet Triggers
The analysis described in this thesis uses single jet triggers extensively. Background
information on the ATLAS trigger system is given in 3.2.5 and the trigger menu
system is described in 4.4. The single jet triggers used are shown in Table 4.1.
Given that the triggers work at the EM scale, the trigger pT threshold will not
directly correspond to the offline, calibrated leading jet pT at which the trigger is
fully efficient (the trigger plateau). In order for trigger inefficiencies to not bias
offline distributions, an offline pT cut is applied at the plateau pT value. To evaluate
this value, trigger efficiencies are studied as a function of offline leading jet pT for
different trigger thresholds as shown in Figure 4.1 (prepared by the ATLAS jet trigger
group [57]). Table 4.1 shows the pT range which each trigger is used for as informed
by Figure 4.1.

in the detector. This means that, to reconstruct the true leading jet pT distribution,
events from prescaled triggers must be weighted appropriately. The weighting factors
are found by checking the average prescale of each trigger over the dataset considered
in this thesis. Table 4.1 shows these average prescales. Figure 4.2 demonstrates that
this procedure gives a smooth leading jet pT distribution in data.

4.6. Full Chain Testing Analysis Tools
4.6 Full Chain Testing
In order to swiftly identify problems in the full production chain used by ATLAS,
every day full chain testing is performed. This involves running a number of test
jobs with several different generated samples with a small number of events compared
with a full production. Any problems which are identified can then be rectified
without interrupting full production. The author was involved in maintaining the full
chain testing (FCT) framework as part of his service work in the ATLAS collaboration.
The FCT runs event generation, simulation, digitisation and reconstruction us-
ing batch queues at CERN. The tests are steered using an xml configuration file
which specifies the details of the chains which are run. Each chain typically runs
 10 events to attempt to identify problems in the software. The generated samples
include Higgs, Z boson, and minimum bias production. A slightly larger sample
(1000 events) of top pair production is also run. This range of samples is used so that
all types of different physics objects are created, hence testing as much of the soft-
ware as possible. The author helped to maintain the FCT (checking for failures in the
tests) and worked to improve its automation including writing scripts using Python
to simplify the xml configuration file. The author also ensured that the output of the
tests gave consistent results.
Chapter 5
SUSY Search with Jets, EmissT and
No Leptons at ATLAS
In this chapter, the ATLAS search for squark and gluino production in the jets, EmissT
and no lepton channel with 1 fb1 , to which the author contributed, is described.
Full details can be found in [5]. The analysis is introduced in 5.1, it is noted that
this search has the highest potential reach for discovering SUSY. 5.2 describes the
analysis method including how SM backgrounds are estimated and how systematic
uncertainties are calculated. The results of the analysis are shown in 5.3. No evi-
dence for SUSY is found and limits are set on simplified SUSY and mSUGRA/cMSSM
models. These limits significantly extend on past ATLAS searches and searches per-
formed at previous collider experiments. The multijet background estimation, which
is a vital part of this analysis, is described in Chapters 6 to 8.
5.1 Introduction
In 2.3, the current status of SUSY searches using particle collider experiments is
described. The discovery reach is highest at the Tevatron and LHC due to their high
centre-of-mass energies. At these colliders, squarks and gluinos, which couple to the
5.2. Method SUSY Search with Jets, EmissT and No Leptons at ATLAS
strong interaction, have the highest production cross-sections. They can decay to
quarks and weakly interacting neutralinos through q  q01 and g  qq01 leaving
final states of EmissT (from the undetected 
1 ) and jets. These decays have higher
branching ratios than squark and gluino decays involving leptons described in 2.3.2.
This means that the no lepton channel potentially has the largest reach for discovering
SUSY. However, the lack of leptons in the final state makes this a challenging analysis,
not least in how the multijet background is controlled and estimated.
The search presented in this chapter, also documented in [5], uses 1 fb1 of
data collected by the ATLAS experiment in 2011. This is the same dataset used for
the multijet background estimation described in this thesis in Chapters 6 to 8. The
analysis is optimised for the greatest discovery reach in simplified models (see 2.2)
where particles except for the squarks, gluinos and 01 have masses beyond the reach
of the LHC.
5.2 Method
5.2.1 Trigger and Event Selection
The trigger used requires EmissT > 45 GeV and a jet with pT > 75 GeV, both at the
electromagnetic scale. The trigger has > 98% efficiency for the offline analysis using
cuts of EmissT > 130 GeV and leading jet pT > 130 GeV.
The object reconstruction, overlap removal and event cleaning is identical to that
described in this thesis in 4.3. The event selection is split into five different searches
labelled A to E, shown in Table 5.1. It is based on cuts on EmissT (for inferring the
presence of the 01 ), the number of jets above particular pT thresholds and on variables
which reduce SM background contamination. The different jet requirements in A to
E optimise the reach of the search for different sparticle production and decay modes.
For example, pair produced squarks may decay to two quarks and two neutralinos
leaving a final state of two jets and EmissT , while pair produced gluinos are likely to
5.2. Method SUSY Search with Jets, EmissT and No Leptons at ATLAS
generate four quarks with two neutralinos giving a final state with four jets. Therefore
searching for different jet multiplicities ensures that different production and decay
modes are covered. All of the analyses use meff as a discriminating variable; this is
defined as the sum of the transverse momenta of the leading n jets in the analysis
and the EmissT . In signal region E (the high mass channel), all jets with pT > 40 GeV
are used in the meff calculation. The use of the meff variable is motivated by the
fact that squarks and gluinos, if they exist, have higher masses than SM particles.
Therefore the energy available in the transverse plane is higher than for SM events
and consequently the SUSY events have higher meff . The (ji, E
T )min cut is
designed to reduce the multijet background to a small level. A similar cut is used in
SUSY searches at the Tevatron and at CMS (see 2.5), as mismeasured jets or jets
containing neutrinos will most likely align with the EmissT . Finally, the E
T /meff cut
further enriches the proportion of events from squark and gluino production compared
to SM particle production.

5.2.2 Standard Model Background Determination
The SM backgrounds to this SUSY search are the following:
5.2. Method SUSY Search with Jets, EmissT and No Leptons at ATLAS
 Multijet production. Significant EmissT can be produced from heavy flavour
quark decays or through severe jet mismeasurement. In order to pass the
(ji, E
T )min cut, the E
T produced must not align with the selected jets.
This can occur if a jet fluctuates to such a degree that it is not reconstructed
with pT > 40 GeV or if multiple jets in the event fluctuate.
 W + jets. These events can enter the signal regions due to leptonic W decays
(W  l ) producing unmeasurable neutrinos. The charged lepton may not be
reconstructed in W   when the  decays hadronically; in W  e when
the electron is mis-identified as a jet or in W   when an isolated muon is
not found.
 Z + jets. This is primarily composed of Z   + jets and is irreducible.
 Single or pair produced top quarks. Top quarks decay almost exclusively
through t  Wb . As for the W + jets background, if the W decays lep-
tonically to a hadronic  lepton or a misidentified/lost e or  then the event
will contain EmissT , jets and no leptons and can pass the signal selection.
For all of these backgrounds, Control Regions (CRs) are defined which have similar
selections to the Signal Regions (SRs), except that the cuts are modified to enrich the
CRs in the background of interest. Five CRs are used for each SR. Transfer Factors
(TFs) are then derived for each of the 25 CRs. These are the estimated ratios of
events expected between each CR and SR. The expected number of events from a
particular background in a SR is then:
N(SR, estimate) = N(CR, observed) TF(estimate) (5.1)
The advantage of this procedure is that some systematic uncertainties cancel out in
the TF estimation. The TFs are estimated using MC, except for the multijets where
the data-driven technique described in this thesis is used (see Chapters 6 to 8). The
CRs are defined in the following ways:
 Z + jets: CR1. Two independent selections are used:  + jets (CR1a) and
(Z  ee/) + jets (CR1b). The momenta of the photon or leptons are added
5.2. Method SUSY Search with Jets, EmissT and No Leptons at ATLAS
to the EmissT to simulate (Z  ) + jets events where the neutrino is not
detected.
 Multijet production: CR2. The (ji, EmissT ) cut is changed to (ji, EmissT ) <
0.2. This selects multijet events as the EmissT in these events is most likely to
point in the direction of one of the jets in the event.
 W + jets: CR3. A lepton is required and the transverse mass of the l + EmissT
system is required to be consistent with the W transverse mass (30 GeV 
100 GeV). In events which populate the signal region, the lepton is mis-
identified as a jet and therefore to emulate these events in this CR, the lepton
is treated as a jet for computing variables like meff . Top quark events are re-
moved by requiring a veto on b-jets (identified from the impact parameter and
secondary vertex, see 4.3.3).
 Top quark production: CR4. The selection is the same as CR3 except b-jets
are required instead of vetoed.
5.2.3 Systematic Uncertainties
The sources of systematic uncertainty in the analysis arise from the derivation of
the TFs described above and in the modelling of expected SUSY signals. These
uncertainties are discussed in this section.
The Jet Energy Scale (JES) correction to account for the difference in detector
response to hadrons and electrons discussed in 4.3.3 is not accurately modelled in
the MC. To account for this, the uncertainty on the JES correction in MC is measured
in 2010 data [54]. This uncertainty depends on jet pT ,  and the presence of nearby
jets and is on the level of 4% on average. MC samples are then produced with re-
calibrated jet momenta using the upper and lower allowed values of the JES correction
and TF estimates are produced using these samples. The uncertainty on the TFs is
then the difference between the TF estimates in the re-calibrated samples and the
nominal sample. The same procedure is applied for jet energy resolution which is
5.3. Results SUSY Search with Jets, EmissT and No Leptons at ATLAS
also not accurately modelled in MC (with an uncertainty of up to 7%). The effects of
pileup (multiple pp interactions occurring in one bunch crossing) are accounted for
in the JES and jet resolution uncertainties. The JES and jet resolution uncertainties
are also applied to the expected SUSY signal yields.
The modelling of jet radiation is not perfectly described in the MC. For ex-
ample, as is mentioned in 4.2, ALPGEN only calculates leading order processes and
MC@NLO only calculates the matrix elements for the hard interaction. To account for
this, the backgrounds are reproduced using alternative generators or with reduced jet
multiplicity and the difference in these TFs from the nominal ones is taken as the
uncertainty. Differences are . 40%. Parton density function uncertainties (see 4.2)
are also accounted for on the samples used for TF estimation and on SUSY signal
samples.
Differences between the modelling of photons and leptons (and the photon and
lepton triggers) in MC and data form an additional uncertainty. Differences in the
b-tagging efficiency are also accounted for. Finally, CR contamination with other SM
processes and limited MC statistics are considered.
The uncertainties associated with the estimation of the multijet TFs are de-
scribed in detail in this thesis in Chapter 8.
5.3 Results
Figure 5.1 shows the expected and observed meff distributions in the different SRs
shown in Table 5.1. The expectation from a simulated mSUGRA model is also shown
on the plots. Good agreement is observed between the SM expectations and the
data. Table 5.2 shows the expected numbers of events from SM processes compared
to the observations in the data. Again, good agreement is observed. As no evi-
dence for an excess is seen, limits are set on possible SUSY parameters using the CLs
technique [58]. This is a frequentist-motivated technique used for determining ex-
clusion intervals. Exclusion contours are calculated for simplified SUSY models with

m(01) = 0 (Figure 5.2) and for particular mSUGRA/cMSSM models (Figure 5.3).
The plots show that the limits observed are more stringent than from previous AT-
LAS searches and searches at LEP and the Tevatron. An example of the mass limits
set is that in a simplified model with only squarks of the first two generations, a gluino
octet, a massless 01 and requiring squark and gluino masses to be less than 2 TeV,
gluino and squark masses below 700 GeV and 875 GeV respectively are excluded at
the 95% confidence level.

Chapter 6
Jet Smearing Overview
This chapter gives an overview of the jet smearing technique for estimating the mul-
tijet background to SUSY searches with no leptons. 6.1 introduces the concept of
jet response. 6.2 gives the motivation for the jet smearing method and defines the
process of jet smearing. 6.3 outlines the assumptions of the technique and justifica-
tions. Finally, 6.4 explains the selection of well-measured data seed events which
are used throughout the method.
6.1 Jet Response
No particle detector can perfectly reconstruct a physics object and so every type of
object will have an associated resolution or response distribution. pT response is
defined as R = precoT /p
T where p
T is the pT of the reconstructed jet and p
is measured at the particle level. In the case of jets, the response will be relatively
broad because of a number of effects:
 Fluctuations in the hadronic shower can be large.
 There is a significant amount of dead material in the detector in and leading
6.2. Motivation and Overview Jet Smearing Overview
up to the hadronic calorimeter, which affects how precisely the energy of a jet
can be measured.
 Some of the energy of the jet can fall outside of the cone of the jet.
 Jets may not be fully contained in the calorimeter, punching-through to the
muon system.
 Heavy flavour jets can contain neutrinos which escape undetected.
These effects lead to the response of a jet being broader than that of an purely electro-
magnetic object such as an electron. Furthermore, these effects can produce extreme
deviations in the reconstructed momentum of a jet compared with the particle-level
momentum. As a result of this, jet response does not follow a purely Gaussian shape
but also contains non-Gaussian tails.
The response of a jet can depend on its kinematics. For example, punch-through
(mentioned above) is clearly pT dependent. Furthermore, as described in 3.2.3, the
ATLAS calorimeter uses different technologies in different regions of  and therefore
the response will depend on the direction of a jet. Jet response can also depend on
the flavour of the jet as heavy flavour jets can contain neutrinos through electroweak
decay. This will be revisited in 7.1. The measurement of jet response, including the
non-Gaussian tails, will be discussed in detail in Chapter 7.
6.2 Motivation and Overview
A data-driven estimation of the multijet background to SUSY searches with no lep-
tons (described in Chapter 5) is vital because the large cross-section for multijet
production at the LHC means that it is impossible to simulate a comparable number
of MC events. For example, at an instantaneous luminosity of 1033 cm2s1 , the
LHC produces  400 events per second containing a jet with EjetT > 100 GeV (see
Figure 2.5). A data-driven estimation is also desirable as the multijet estimation
from PYTHIA is not expected to reproduce the data at high jet multiplicities. This
6.2. Motivation and Overview Jet Smearing Overview
is because, as mentioned in 4.2, PYTHIA is a leading order generator and matrix
elements are only calculated for the hard interaction, and not for additional hard
radiated partons.
The jet smearing method is a data-driven technique which is used to determine
multijet distributions in SUSY signal and control regions. It works through scaling
(smearing) the momenta of jets in well measured, low-EmissT seed events with ran-
dom numbers drawn from jet response functions measured using data. This process is
repeated a large number of times for each seed event, hence producing a large number
of smeared events or pseudo-data. The pseudo-data sample then contains events
with multiple jets and potentially large EmissT and can be used like a MC sample pro-
viding estimated distributions of multijet events. The normalisation of pseudo-data
distributions to the data can be performed in multijet dominated control regions.
Selecting the seed events from data means the kinematics of the pseudo-data
match multijet data events as long as no bias is introduced though the seed selec-
tion. The smearing of the jets in the seed events acts to re-introduce EmissT into the
events. The precise measurement of jet response, including the non-Gaussian tails,
as a function of jet angle and momentum, ensures that the EmissT distribution in the
pseudo-data reproduces the data. The measurement of jet response is described in
detail in Chapter 7. Figure 6.1 shows a cartoon of the jet smearing method, with two
high-EmissT events generated from a well-measured seed event.
A smeared event is generated by multiplying each jet four-vector in a seed event
by a random number drawn from the appropriate jet response function. The smeared
event EmissT is then given by
~p T (ji) +
~pT(ji), (6.1)
primes are used to distinguish smeared from unsmeared quantities.
6.3. Assumptions of the Method Jet Smearing Overview
Figure 6.1: Jet smearing cartoon. From [59]
6.3 Assumptions of the Method
The jet smearing technique relies on some basic assumptions:
1 The EmissT of multijet events is dominated by jet fluctuation (true or fake).
2 True and fake sources of jet fluctuation can be included in one response function
and this can be applied to all jets.
3 Any dependence of jet response on event-wide properties, such as jet multiplicity
or the fluctuations of other jets in the event, can be neglected. In other words,
jet smearing can justifiably be applied on a jet-by-jet basis.
6.4. Seed Event Selection Jet Smearing Overview
The main justification for these assumptions is that the technique is shown to suc-
cessfully reproduce the control distributions discussed in Chapter 7 and the multijet
control and validation distributions for the main SUSY analysis shown in 8.4. As-
sumption (2) can be checked by studying the proportion of b-jets to light-jets in the
seed selection to check for potential bias. This is done in 6.4, see Figure 6.4(d).
6.4 Seed Event Selection
The seed selection is designed to collect events where the momenta of the recon-
structed jets are as close as possible to the true, particle level jets. In other words
jets in these events should have response values within the Gaussian core of jet re-
sponse. Jet fluctuation can then be introduced through smearing with minimal double
counting.
Events must first pass the trigger selection shown in Table 4.1. To ensure that
only events in which jets have undergone small response fluctuations are selected, a
cut on EmissT could potentially be used. However, since E
T resolution varies with
the event scalar sum ET , a cut on E
T would bias the pT scale of the seed events.
This is demonstrated in Figure 6.2. Instead the EmissT -significance, S , is used as it
approximately eliminates the
ET dependence.
EmissT
(6.2)
The S distribution for events passing the trigger selection is shown in Fig-
ure 6.3. A cut on S at the peak value ensures that the selected events will typically
contain jets undergoing fluctuations in the peak of the Gaussian part of the response
function whilst retaining a relatively high selection efficiency. The value chosen is
S < 0.7 GeV1/2 . Using a higher value would provide more seed event statistics but
increase the chance of having a large fluctuation present in a jet in a seed event.
Given that limited seed statistics is not the dominant uncertainty in the method,

Chapter 7
Measurement of Jet Response
This chapter describes the measurement of jet response used for the jet smearing
multijet estimation described in Chapter 8. Firstly, jet response is measured from
multijet MC samples as described in 7.1. The MC response is modified to match
data using the techniques described in 7.2. The dijet analysis for constraining the
Gaussian response is described in 7.3. The Mercedes analysis for constraining the
non-Gaussian response tails is then described in 7.4. Novel event shape triggers are
used to collect extra statistics for this measurement as described in 7.4.3. They
allow the non-Gaussian response tail to be constrained to a greater extent than if
only standard single jet triggers are used as shown in 7.4.4.
7.1 MC Response
Jet response is initially taken from multijet MC samples. It is then constrained to
match the data in control distributions. To measure the response from MC, the
following is done:
 Multijet samples produced with PYTHIA (see 4.2) and standard object defini-
tions and overlap removal are used (see 4.3). Jet cleaning is applied as in 4.3.5
7.1. MC Response Measurement of Jet Response
so that jet response is only measured for jets which are used in the main SUSY
analysis.
 Jet response is measured for any reconstructed jet in an event isolated from other
reconstructed jets by R > 1.0 and matched to a truth jet with R < 0.1. The
reconstructed jet is also required to be isolated from other truth jets by R >
1.0. Note that R here refers to the geometric quantity R =
2 + 2 ,
and not jet response.
 The four-momenta of any final state neutrinos in the cone of the truth jet are
added to the jet. This is vital as both true and fake sources of EmissT should be
encoded in the jet response function used for jet smearing.
 Finally, the jet response is measured as a function of truth jet pT using RMC =
precoT /p
Figure 7.1(a) shows RMC with pT bins of width 20 GeV. The response function
for a jet with a particular momentum is a pT slice of this distribution. The response
for jets with 140 GeV< pT < 160 GeV is shown in Figure 7.1(b).

MC statistics.
7.2. Modification of MC Response Measurement of Jet Response
In 6.1, it is noted that the response of heavy flavour jets is expected to be dif-
ferent to the response of light jets. This is particularly relevant to the background es-
timation in SUSY searches with b-jets [6, 7, 8] where reconstructed b-jets are smeared
with different response functions to those used for light jets. This technique is not
used in the analysis described in this thesis since there is no requirement for b-jets
in the SUSY signal or multijet control regions. In the supporting material [60] (in-
ternally approved by the ATLAS collaboration) for the analysis described in [7], the
response functions for true and reconstructed b-jets and for reconstructed light jets
are determined using multijet MC. These are shown in Figure 7.2. It can be seen
that the non-Gaussian tails are much larger for the b-jets than for the light jets. This
indicates that non-Gaussian jet response is dominated by the presence of neutrinos
in heavy flavour jets.
7.2 Modification of MC Response
In order to constrain the response functions so that they match jet response in data,
multijet dominated control distributions are used. Jet smearing on seed events is
used to produce pseudo-data which can then be compared to the data. The response
functions are then modified to gain agreement between the pseudo-data and the
data. Two techniques are used to modify the MC response functions to improve
the agreement between the pseudo-data and data in the control distributions:
(1) Additional Gaussian smearing to widen the jet response. To account for differ-
ences in the Gaussian response width in MC and data, a pT -dependent Gaus-
sian smearing is introduced. For a given jet, the smearing value from the MC
response function is multiplied by a number drawn from a Gaussian with a
mean of one and width correction(pT). The functional form and uncertainty on
correction(pT) is determined using the analysis described in 7.3. This analysis
uses the pT asymmetry of dijet events to constrain correction(pT) so that the
Gaussian response in pseudo-data matches that in data.
(2) Non-Gaussian response shape modification. Understanding the shape of the

regions. This is because the high EmissT requirement guarantees that at least one
jet in a multijet event has undergone a very significant fluctuation. The Mer-
cedes1 analysis described in 7.4 is used to derive the correct tail shapes and
uncertainties in different pT bins. Events are selected with three or more jets
where one of the jets is unambiguously associated with the EmissT in the event.
The EmissT can then be assumed to be due to the fluctuation of the matched
jet and the response of that jet can be measured. This analysis constrains the
non-Gaussian response to match the data.
1The events passing the selection in this analysis resemble the Mercedes logo, see Fig. 7.4.
7.3. Dijet Analysis Measurement of Jet Response
7.3 Dijet Analysis
The first control distribution is the pT asymmetry of dijet events. In pure dijet events,
any asymmetry is due to jet fluctuation. Events must first satisfy the trigger selection
shown in Table 4.1. Seed events are selected as described in 6.4 and 1000 smeared
events are produced from each seed event as described in 6.2. The following require-
ments are then imposed on the data (following the trigger selection from Table 4.1)
and smeared data:
 Two jets with pT > 130, 40 GeV. No additional jets with pT > 30 GeV.
 | (j1, j2)| < 0.3.
The pT asymmetry is given by
A(pT,1, pT,2) =
pT,1  pT,2
pT,1 + pT,2
, (7.1)
where the indices correspond to the jet pT ordering. The width of a Gaussian fitted
to this distribution is given by:
((pT,1))2 + ((pT,2))2
pT,1 + pT,2
. (7.2)
If the jets have approximately the same rapidity then (pT,1) = (pT,2) = (pT).
Furthermore, pT,1 + pT,2 = 2pT,average . Therefore:
(pT)
. (7.3)
A(pT,1, pT,2) is measured in pT bins (see Fig. 7.3(a)) and then the pT slices are
fitted with Gaussians with means fixed at zero in the range 0 < A < 0.15. This
range was found to provide a good fit for all pT . See Figures 7.3(b) and 7.3(c) for
examples. Fig. 7.3(d) shows the Gaussian widths measured in data (A,data ). Also
shown is A reproduced using jet smearing with the uncorrected response function
7.3. Dijet Analysis Measurement of Jet Response
taken from MC (referred to as A,MC ). The A,data and A,MC distributions are then
fitted with the following functional form:
+ C. (7.4)
The difference observed between A,data and A,MC is used to constrain the
correction(pT) parameter introduced in 7.2. The additional smearing of the MC
response functions with correction(pT) increases MC(pT) in the same way as in the
convolution of two Gaussians:
total(pT)
MC(pT)
+ correction(pT)
2. (7.5)
total(pT) is the width of the corrected response function. Requiring that this cor-
rected response matches the data response (i.e. total(pT) = data(pT)) and using
Eq. 7.3 it follows that:
2 A,data)2 = (
2 A,MC)2 + correction(pT)2. (7.6)
Therefore:
correction(pT) =
2A,data  2A,MC (7.7)
Using this equation and the parameters in Table 7.1 from the fits to A,data and A,MC
(using Eq. 7.4), correction(pT) is now fully described. Table 7.1 shows the parameters
calculated using different fitting ranges, this is important in deriving the systematic
uncertainties on correction(pT) as discussed below.
7.3.1 Uncertainty on correction(pT).
The fits on A,data and A,MC are unconstrained below 150 GeV with the triggers
used in this analysis so correction(pT) must be extrapolated to low pT . This results in
the value of correction(pT) at low pT varying to a large extent with the fitting range
used. Examples are:

Table 7.1: Parameters for fits to the A,data and A,MC distributions. These param-
eters are used to calculate correction(pT) using Eq. 7.7 as described in the text.
 Fitting range 150 GeV < pT < 400 GeV = correction(50 GeV) = 0.119.
 Fitting range 150 GeV < pT < 600 GeV = correction(50 GeV) = 0.074.
 Fitting range 150 GeV < pT < 1000 GeV = correction(50 GeV) = 0.053.
These fits are shown in Figure 7.3(d). Using different fitting ranges therefore provides
a simple method which accounts for the uncertainty on correction(pT) at low pT .
To account for any other differences between A,total and A,data , high and low
estimates are performed in the following way:
 High estimate: use parameters from fitting range 150 GeV < pT < 400 GeV.
correction(pT) = correction(pT) + 0.05.
 Optimal estimate: use parameters from fitting range 150 GeV < pT < 600 GeV.
optimal
correction(pT) = correction(pT).
 Low estimate: use parameters from fitting range 150 GeV < pT < 1000 GeV.
lowcorrection(pT) = correction(pT) 0.05.
The value 0.05 is an arbitrary choice but is seen to perform well as discussed below.
To obtain a given distribution or quantity, the estimate using 
optimal
correction(pT) is taken
as the optimal estimate. The uncertainty is then taken as half the difference between
7.3. Dijet Analysis Measurement of Jet Response
the estimates acquired using 
correction(pT) and 
correction(pT). This procedure is
used for obtaining the jet smearing estimate of A shown in Figure 7.3(e). The
chi-squared value between the estimate and data is 24.1 with 34 degrees of freedom
(p value = 0.90). This indicates that the estimate (with uncertainties accounted
for) reproduces the data well.

7.4. Mercedes Analysis Measurement of Jet Response
7.4 Mercedes Analysis
The measurement of the non-Gaussian jet response tails is vital in attempting to
reproduce high EmissT multijet events. The Mercedes analysis, developed in [59, 61],
is designed to probe the response tails of a single jet. Unlike a dijet balance analysis,
the Mercedes analysis can distinguish between high-side and low-side fluctuations of
the candidate jet. The selection described here is based on that presented in [59].
Events are initially selected according to the trigger selection in Table 4.1. Seed
events are selected as described in 6.4 and 1000 smeared events are produced from
each seed event as described in 6.2. The pseudo-data accounts for the Gaussian
corrections and uncertainties found in 7.3. The selection described below is then
imposed on the data (following the trigger selection from Table 4.1) and smeared
data.
The preselection requirements are for three or more jets with pT > 260, 40, 30
GeV and EmissT > 30 GeV. Three jets are required to allow the selection of three
pronged Mercedes type events which allow for the unambiguous association of one
jet with the EmissT in these events (see Fig. 7.4 for a depiction of Mercedes events).
The cut on the leading jet pT is used to ensure that data events are collected us-
ing non-prescaled triggers to simplify the derivation of the tail shape. Non-multijet
backgrounds are also significantly reduced with this cut.
Large EmissT can be generated either by upward or downward fluctuations in
jet response. Therefore it is important to select events with jets either parallel or
anti-parallel to EmissT in the transverse plane (see Fig. 7.5). Therefore, in each event
passing the preselection cuts, all N jets with pT > 30 GeV are sorted in increasing
distance in  from the EmissT and the event is selected if it satisfies either :
|(j1, EmissT )| <   |(jN , EmissT )|
|(j1, EmissT )| < match
|(j2, EmissT )| > isol1 , (7.8)
7.4. Mercedes Analysis Measurement of Jet Response
Figure 7.4: Mercedes event topology. EmissT is unambiguously associated with one
jet in the event. Events of this type are those used in the measurement of the non-
Gaussian component of the jet response function.
  |(jN , EmissT )| < |(j1, EmissT )|
  |(jN , EmissT )| < match
  |(jN1, EmissT )| > isol1 , (7.9)
where the indices refer to position in the  ordering. match gives how close in 
the candidate jet should be to the EmissT . 
1 gives how isolated the next closest
jet must be. Applying these cuts selects events where the jet most closely associated
with the EmissT is sufficiently well associated to be considered a match and is isolated
from any other jets in the transverse plane. The fluctuating jet is then labelled as J
and the jet closest to being back-to-back with J is labelled as K . This corresponds
to J = j1 and K = jN for the parallel selection (Eq. 7.8), and J = jN and K = j1
for the anti-parallel selection (Eq. 7.9).
In order to avoid ambiguity, events containing jets both parallel and anti-parallel
to the EmissT are rejected. Figure 7.6 shows the |(K,EmissT )| distribution for both
parallel and anti-parallel selections with match = 0.1 and isol1 = 1.0. It is clear
that K tends to be back-to-back with J . To resolve this ambiguity, events passing

Finally, in order to reduce the contamination from non-multijet sources (like
Z( ) + jets), events are required to have high pT jets other than the candidate
fluctuating jet. In each event, jets other than J are sorted in decreasing pT and the

7.4. Mercedes Analysis Measurement of Jet Response
7.4.1 Modification of Non-Gaussian Response
Figure 7.7 shows that the jet smearing estimate without tail corrections does not
perfectly reconstruct the low-side non-Gaussian tail observed in the data. This is
especially clear in Figure 7.7(b) where the estimate overshoots the data in the region
0.0 < R2 < 0.5. In the high-side region (R2  1.0), good agreement is observed
between the estimate and data indicating that no special treatment is needed for the
high-side non-Gaussian tail.
In order to modify the tail, firstly the MC response functions are fitted with
a functional form. The tail can then be modified by changing a parameter in the
functional form. The jet smearing estimates of R2 (like those in Figure 7.7) can
then be reproduced using the modified tail and the agreement between the estimate
and data can be probed. By repeating this procedure (using different values for the
parameter), the optimal form of non-Gaussian tail can be found with an associated
uncertainty.
The functional form found to best describe the MC non-Gaussian jet response
is a Gaussian with a fitting range restricted to the tail region. In order to define
this region, the response is first fitted with a Crystal Ball function [62] (which has a
continuous derivative) in the range 0.0 < R < 1.2. It is important to note that this
function is not expected to provide a perfect fit to the response distribution; it is only
used as a tool to determine the extent of the tail region. The Crystal Ball function
is defined as:

7.4. Mercedes Analysis Measurement of Jet Response
The crossing point between the core and tail regions is therefore at x = x  . To
ensure the tail dominates, the tail Gaussian is fitted in the range 0 < x < x0.1.
Examples of the Crystal Ball fits and the fitting ranges determined are shown in
Figure 7.8. Also shown are Gaussians fitted to the tail region. The full jet response
is then the Gaussian fit in the tail region and the original MC response histogram
outside of the tail region.

Figure 7.8: Fitting the MC response tail. For every pT slice, a Crystal Ball function
is fitted to the R distribution in the region 0.0 < R < 1.2. The tail region is then
defined as 0 < R < x    0.1 (see Eq. 7.17 and text). A Gaussian is then fitted
in this region. Also shown is the Gaussian component of the Crystal Ball fit, this is
used in producing a sample of pseudo-data with only Gaussian smearing as described
in 7.4.2. The yellow band shows the uncertainty from limited MC statistics.
7.4. Mercedes Analysis Measurement of Jet Response
The response tail can now be modified by changing the shape of the Gaussian fit.
This is achieved by multiplying the width of the Gaussian (tail ) by a factor tail .
The mean of the Gaussian is fixed and the normalisation is set such that the value
of the function at x = x    0.1 is fixed. Figure 7.9 shows examples of how the
response varies with the choice of tail for jets with 140 GeV < pT(true) < 160 GeV.

7.4.2 Determining tail and its Uncertainty
In order to test the compatibility of the modified tails with the observation in the
data, pseudo-data samples are produced with different tail values. 
2 tests are
then performed between the Mercedes distributions in the pseudo-data samples and
in the data.
The first task of this analysis is to define the regions in which the 2 tests are
performed. This is important as only differences in the tail shape should be probed,
7.4. Mercedes Analysis Measurement of Jet Response
and not differences in the Gaussian region of the Mercedes distributions. To achieve
this, one must define in what region the Mercedes distributions are dominated by tail
fluctuations. This is achieved by creating a sample of pseudo-data only using Gaussian
smearing. The response functions for this sample are taken from the Crystal Ball fits
described in 7.4.1. The fits are used to define the parameters for Gaussians which
are a good match to the core of the response distributions as shown in Figure 7.8. For
a particular Mercedes pT bin, the tail region is then defined as those bins in which
the bin content of the Gaussian smeared pseudo-data distribution is less than half
the bin content of the data. This is demonstrated in Figure 7.10.

a sample of pseudo-data created with Gaussian-only smearing. Comparing these
distributions defines the tail region (shown in the plots) for performing 2 tests
between data and pseudo-data (including the non-Gaussian tail) as described in the
text. Statistical uncertainties are shown.
7.4. Mercedes Analysis Measurement of Jet Response
Having defined the tail regions of the Mercedes distributions, 2 tests can now
be performed between the pseudo-data and data with different values of tail . For
these tests, the pseudo-data is compared with the data with the non-multijet MC
subtracted from it. As can be seen in Figure 7.7, in the region 0.0 < R < 0.4
there can be a significant non-multijet contamination and there can be bins with
no data observed. For these reasons, the first bins are merged until the amount of
data observed is greater than the non-multijet MC and furthermore there are no bins
missing data to the right of this first bin. For example in Figure 7.7(b), the first bin
is taken as 0.0 < R < 0.3. Sets of pseudo-data are created with tail varying from
0.5 to 1.5 in steps of 0.05. The 2 values are then calculated. For each pT(true) bin
three values of tail are found:
 optimaltail : the value of tail which gives the highest p-value2.
 hightail : the value of tail above optimaltail at which the hypothesis of a good
fit is rejected at a one sigma level. i.e. The first parameter value above 
optimal
at which the p-value is found to be less than 0.32.
 lowtail : the value of tail below optimaltail at which the hypothesis of a good
fit is rejected at a one sigma level.
The parameter values found are shown in Table 7.2. These values are used to produce
the pseudo-data distributions shown in Figure 7.11.
To obtain a given distribution or quantity, the estimate using 
optimal
tail is taken
as the optimal estimate. The tail uncertainty is then taken as half the difference
between the estimates acquired using 
tail and 
tail . This procedure is used
for obtaining the jet smearing estimate of the Mercedes distributions shown in Fig-
ure 7.12. This can be compared to Figure 7.7 where tail corrections have not been
performed. For completeness, there should also be a correction and uncertainty de-
rived for the tail normalisation (compared to the Gaussian component of jet response).
However, the effect of such a correction is small compared with the effect from the
shape change discussed in this section and therefore is not included in this analysis.

7.4.3 Dedicated  Trigger
The lower-pT single jet triggers which could be used for collecting Mercedes events
in 7.4 have high average prescaling as shown in Table 4.1; this is due to the high
cross-section for multijet production at the LHC. This partly motivates the high
leading jet pT cut (pT > 260 GeV) used in the Mercedes analysis. To allow the use
of a lower pT cut, and hence have more available statistics for the measurement of
non-Gaussian jet response, novel event shape triggers called  triggers have been
developed. These triggers are designed to be fully efficient for triggering Mercedes
events whilst rejecting a significant number of other multijet events. This allows the
trigger to collect a greater number of events useful for the Mercedes analysis whilst
running with the same trigger bandwidth as an equivalent single jet trigger.
Figure 7.13 shows the min((j1, j2)) distribution of all combinations of pairs
of jets (referred to as min henceforth) passing the trigger selection described in
Table 4.1. The majority of events either have jets which are back-to-back (min   )

or are close to each other (min  0) in  . Both of these cases fail the Mercedes
event selection as the candidate jet must be isolated from other jets and not back-to-
back with other jets in the event. For this reason, the quantity min is an ideal one
to trigger on.
To inform the choice of the min cut, the offline min distribution is plotted
for events passing the full Mercedes event selection described in 7.4; this is shown in
Figure 7.14. It is clear that an offline cut of min < 2.2 would be fully efficient for
the Mercedes selection.

The first  triggers developed are L2 triggers. To aid their development, L2
jet kinematics are studied using ATLAS data recorded in 2010. Some key distribu-
tions are shown in Figure 7.15. Figures 7.15(a) and 7.15(c) show the  and 
distributions between the two leading momenta jets at L2 (for jets reconstructed at
L2 with ET > 7 GeV). The MC simulation of the L2 jet kinematics is seen to model
7.4. Mercedes Analysis Measurement of Jet Response
the data reasonably well. Figures 7.15(b) and 7.15(d) demonstrate that in the ma-
jority of cases, the L2  and  values match the offline (events on the diagonal).
There are also a large number of events lying far from the diagonal, in these events
the momentum ordering of the jets is different between L2 and offline. This can occur
due to the simplicity of the L2 jet algorithms compared to offline and the fact that no
JES correction is applied at L2. This partly motivates the use of the min variable
in the  triggers instead of  between the two highest momenta jets.

For the dataset considered in the rest of this thesis, there were two  triggers
active: EF j135 j30 a4tc EFFS dphi04 and EF j180 j30 a4tc EFFS dphi04. These
are EF triggers giving the advantage that the jets considered are a closer match
to the offline jets compared with L2 jets. The dphi04 notation corresponds to
min <   0.4. The EF j180 j30 a4tc EFFS dphi04 trigger is not needed in the
dataset of this thesis as the equivalent single jet trigger (EF j180 a4tc EFFS) was
unprescaled as shown in Table 4.1. This trigger is used in later data periods be-
yond the scope of this thesis. The EF j135 j30 a4tc EFFS dphi04 trigger is used
as it had an average prescale of 3.4 compared to 8.9 for the corresponding single
jet trigger: EF j135 a4tc EFFS. The Mercedes distribution for pT(true) > 100 GeV
measured using this trigger and with the leading jet pT cut and p
T set to 200 GeV
is shown in Figure 7.16(a). For comparison the same distribution except using the
EF j135 a4tc EFFS trigger is plotted in Figure 7.16(b). To easily compare the shapes,
Figure 7.16(c) shows the two distributions on the same plot, with the data from
EF j135 a4tc EFFS normalised to the  trigger. The distribution from the 
trigger matches that from the single jet trigger (within uncertainties) indicating that
the  trigger does not bias the R2 distribution.

7.4.4 Using Events from  Trigger to Constrain tail
Utilising the events from the EF j135 j30 a4tc EFFS dphi04 trigger may allow the
tail parameter to be further constrained and hence reduce an uncertainty on the
shape of the non-Gaussian response tail. To achieve this, the procedure described
in 7.4.2 is repeated except that the leading jet pT cut and pcut1T are set to 200 GeV.
For the data distribution, the EF j135 j30 a4tc EFFS dphi04 is used for events with
200 GeV < pT(leading) < 260 GeV instead of the EF j135 a4tc EFFS trigger. Note
that pseudo-data is produced in the normal way, following the usual single jet trigger
selection shown in Table 4.1.
The statistical uncertainty for bins in the data R2 histogram is underestimated
in the case of there being zero events observed from the prescaled  trigger. For
example, take a bin with N events from the unprescaled trigger and 0 events from
the prescaled trigger; the statistical uncertainty would usually be
N on this bin.
However, an entry from the prescaled trigger does not just add one event, but an
event with a weight: wPS . Therefore the upper uncertainty on this bin should be
N  wPS =
N2 + w2PS . Therefore, for any bins whose error is less than 3.4
(this corresponds to wPS for EF j135 j30 a4tc EFFS dphi04), the upper error is set
N2 + 3.42 . The lower error is not modified. Table 7.3 shows the values of tail
which are obtained and Figure 7.17 shows the R2 distributions in the tail region used
for the 2 fits.
Comparing Table 7.3 with Table 7.2, it can be seen that using the  trig-
ger does further constrain tail compared to using only single jet triggers. The
consequence of this will be discussed in Chapter 8.

Chapter 8
Jet Smearing for Multijet
Estimation
This chapter describes the final multijet background estimation for the fully hadronic
SUSY search (see Chapter 5) using the jet smearing method. The response func-
tions used are those measured in Chapter 7. Firstly, in 8.1 the technique is shown
to successfully reproduce the multijet EmissT distribution observed in data. In 8.2,
the method used for performing the final multijet estimation is given. 8.3 gives the
uncertainties associated with the jet smearing method with systematic uncertainties
dominating. 8.4 presents the results of the analysis, with estimated multijet distri-
butions compared to the data in the SUSY control, signal and validation regions. The
estimated transfer factors between the control and signal regions are also shown. Fi-
nally, in 8.5, the results are discussed. The multijet distributions estimated with the
jet smearing method display excellent agreement with the data in SUSY control and
validation regions. In the signal regions, the benefit in the extra statistics compared
with multijet MC is evident.
8.1. Validating the Method Jet Smearing for Multijet Estimation
8.1 Validating the Method
Before obtaining the final multijet estimation for the SUSY signal and control regions,
the method is tested by attempting to reproduce the multijet EmissT distribution.
Events must first satisfy the trigger selection shown in Table 4.1. Seed events are
selected as described in 6.4 and 1000 smeared events are produced from each seed
event as described in 6.2. A requirement is then made for the presence of two jets
with pT > 130, 40 GeV in the data and smeared data. The E
T distribution in data,
estimated with jet smearing and with MC simulated data is shown in Figure 8.1. The
smeared data here is produced with response functions using the Gaussian and tail
corrections and associated uncertainties described in Chapter 7.
8.2 Method for Final Multijet Estimation
Having constrained the response functions to successfully model multijet dominated
distributions in the data, jet smearing can now be used to provide multijet distri-
butions in SUSY signal and control regions. For the multijet estimation, only the
signal regions (shown in Table 5.1) and CR2, the multijet control regions, are needed.
For each signal region, CR2 has the same cuts except the (ji, E
T ) requirement
changed to (ji, E
T ) < 0.2.
Seed events are selected as shown in 6.4 and 10000 smeared events are produced
from each seed as described in 6.2. The response functions used for the smearing are
those constrained with multijet data as discussed in Chapter 7. The extra constraint
on tail allowed by the  triggers shown in 7.4.4 is not used to begin with. The
smeared events are then passed through the relevant signal or control region selection.
In comparison, data events are required to pass the signal trigger described in 5.2.1
and then the relevant signal or control region selection. The required inputs from
this method to the full SUSY analysis are Transfer Factors (TFs) from the multijet

. (8.1)
This is just the predicted number of multijet events in the signal region divided by
the predicted number in CR2. Therefore no normalisation of the multijet estimate is
required. For the plots in this analysis, the multijet estimates from jet smearing and
from Monte Carlo are normalised to the data using the CR2 cuts but without the final
EmissT /meff or meff cuts. As is explained in 5.2, the TF can be used to estimate the
number of events from a particular background in a SR using the following equation:
8.3. Uncertainties Jet Smearing for Multijet Estimation
N(SR, estimate) = N(CR, observed) TF(estimate). (8.2)
8.3 Uncertainties
The uncertainty on the final transfer factors is dominated by systematic uncertainties.
The largest contribution is from the uncertainty on the non-Gaussian tail, introduced
via the uncertainty on tail .
8.3.1 Systematic Uncertainties
The systematic uncertainties accounted for in this analysis arise are from the uncer-
tainties on the response functions used for the smearing process and from any biases
introduced by the seed selection. For each uncertainty, the full estimate is repeated
with the response function modified in the appropriate way; the uncertainty is then
the deviation of this estimate from the original estimate.
Response function uncertainties
The uncertainties on the jet response fall into two types:
 The uncertainty on the Gaussian response width. This is introduced through
the uncertainty on correction(pT) described in 7.3.1 and the validity of the
uncertainty can be observed in Figure 7.3(e).
 The uncertainty on the shape of the non-Gaussian tail. This is introduced via
the uncertainty on the tail parameter as described in 7.4.2. Figure 7.12
shows the Mercedes distributions produced using the optimised values of tail
including uncertainties.
8.3. Uncertainties Jet Smearing for Multijet Estimation
Seed selection bias uncertainty
Figure 6.4(b) shows that a small bias is introduced to the leading jet pT by the seed
selection. To account for this, an estimate is performed with a constant factor of 0.1
added to jet response. This will, on average, increase smeared jet pT by 10%. This
is referred to as Rmeanshift = +10%. Figure 8.2 shows leading jet pT in data and
estimated with jet smearing. This extra uncertainty is seen to account for differences
observed between the data and original estimate.

Dependence of jet response on 
Jet response could be affected by the  coordinate of the fluctuating jet. For example,
a jet in the crack region of the calorimeter would be expected to have a broader
response than a jet in the central region. Binning jet response in pT will partly
account for these differences due to the correlation between pT and  . The largest
8.3. Uncertainties Jet Smearing for Multijet Estimation
effect of  dependent response on the results of this analysis would be if the non-
Gaussian tail shape were strongly dependent on  . This is checked by repeating the
Mercedes analysis (see 7.4) in the following  bins:
 Central region ( || < 0.8).
 Extended tile barrel (0.8 < || < 1.2).
 Crack region (1.2 < || < 2.1).
 End-cap region (2.1 < || < 2.8).
For the smearing estimates, Gaussian and tail corrections are applied to the response
functions with uncertainties accounted for as described in 7.3 and 7.4. To increase
statistics for this measurement, the pT binning is removed so the only requirement
is pT(true) > 100 GeV. The results are shown in Figure 8.3. It is clear that the
estimate agrees well with the data indicating that non-Gaussian fluctuations are not
strongly  dependent. The 2 p-values obtained between the tail regions in the
data and estimates, calculated using the method described in 7.4.2 and accounting
for uncertainties on tail and correction(pT), are 0.98, 0.94, 0.66 and 0.96 for the
central, extended tile barrel, crack and end-cap regions respectively. Given the good
agreement observed between the data and estimates, no uncertainty is associated with
the  dependence of jet response.

8.4. Results Jet Smearing for Multijet Estimation
Statistical uncertainties
The uncertainty from limited seed event statistics and pseudo-data statistics is prop-
agated to all distributions and numbers produced using the jet smearing method.
The procedure used is described in [59]. The uncertainty from limited pseudo-data
tends to zero in the limit of infinite Nsmear , the number of smeared events produced
from each seed event. The number of seed events, however, relies on the number of
events collected with the single jet triggers shown in Table 4.1 and the efficiency of
the seed selection described in 6.4; it does not depend on Nsmear . In a simplified
case, if smeared data produced from only one seed event contributes to a signal re-
gion histogram, then the statistical uncertainty on the number of events present in
the signal region should be  100%.
The derivation described in [59] yields a final overall statistical uncertainty on
the jth bin of an estimated distribution (normalised to 1) of:
total(pj) =
NseedNsmear
nij(1 + nij). (8.3)
nij is the number of entries from the i
th seed event in the jth bin. In the limit of
infinite Nsmear , Eq. 8.3 simplifies to:
seed(pj) =
NseedNsmear
n2ij. (8.4)

Table 8.1 shows the transfer factors determined for the different analyses using
the jet smearing method. The transfer factors are re-evaluated using the extra con-
strained tail parameter from using the  triggers as discussed in 7.4.4; this is
shown in Table 8.2.

8.5 Discussion
The CR2 distributions in Figures 8.4 to 8.8 and the validation plots in Figure 8.9 show
good agreement between the data and the smearing estimates (with non-multijet MC
8.5. Discussion Jet Smearing for Multijet Estimation
accounted for). In the SR distributions in Figures 8.4 to 8.8, the benefit in statistics
from using the jet smearing estimate compared to the multijet MC is clear. The
transfer factors shown in Table 8.2, which are estimated using the extra-constrained
tail parameter (from the use of the  triggers) are seen to have smaller overall
fractional systematic uncertainties associated with them than those shown in Ta-
ble 8.1. Therefore the use of the  triggers allows a more accurate estimation of
the multijet background.
Chapter 9
Conclusions
A data-driven technique to estimate the multijet background to SUSY searches with
no leptons at ATLAS has been described. Versions of this method were used for the
multijet estimations in a number of SUSY searches [3, 4, 5], allowing a greater discov-
ery reach than would have been possible with MC methods. As part of the method,
jet response at ATLAS was measured, including the non-Gaussian tails. Novel event
shape triggers were developed which provided more statistics for the response tail
measurement thus increasing the sensitivity of the final multijet estimation.
Chapter 2 gave an overview of the SM and SUSY. SUSY is seen to provide a
solution to the hierarchy problem. The status of SUSY searches was described with no
evidence yet found for its existence. Finally, techniques for reducing and estimating
the multijet background to SUSY searches with no leptons at hadron colliders were
overviewed.
In Chapter 3, the LHC and ATLAS detector were described. It was seen that
the calorimetry of ATLAS provides the ability to make reliable measurements of jets
and EmissT which are key in fully hadronic SUSY searches.
Chapter 4 described the analysis tools used in this thesis including details of
the Monte Carlo simulated multijet samples used for the initial measurement of jet
Conclusions
response. Object reconstruction, event cleaning and details of triggers used were also
given.
Chapter 5 gave an overview of SUSY searches using ATLAS. The fully hadronic
search was described and it was seen to provide exclusion limits in searches for squarks
and gluinos beyond those found at the Tevatron and previous searches using the
ATLAS detector.
Chapter 6 introduced the jet smearing method for multijet background estima-
tion. An introduction to jet response was given, alongside an overview of jet smearing
and the assumptions which the technique relies on. The selection of well measured
data seed events was also described.
In Chapter 7, the measurement of jet response using the jet smearing method
was described. This included the evaluation of the non-Gaussian jet response tail. The
technique was shown to adequately describe multijet dominated control distributions.
Novel event shape  triggers were then introduced and they were shown to provide
extra statistics for the measurement of non-Gaussian response.
Chapter 8 described the use of jet smearing, using the data-measured response
functions, to provide the multijet estimation for the fully hadronic SUSY searches.
Multijet distributions were estimated and yielded excellent agreement with the data
observations. Transfer functions were produced between SUSY multijet control dis-
tributions and signal regions. The use of  triggers was seen to reduce the overall
systematic uncertainty on these transfer functions.
The data-driven jet smearing technique, described in Chapters 6 to 8, is the pri-
mary method used by the ATLAS collaboration to measure the multijet background
to SUSY searches with no leptons. As such it is a key part of these searches, and has
resulted in the collaboration setting exclusion limits beyond that which would have
been possible with MC methods. Any future SUSY discovery will need to demon-
strate that the multijet background is well understood and under control, the analysis
presented in this thesis will allow this.
Future work which could reduce the systematic uncertainties associated with
Conclusions
the method could include using dijet events to further constrain the non-Gaussian
response measurement and improving the seed selection to limit the bias introduced
to the leading jet pT distribution.
