Abstract
Plant material can regulate the mechanical properties of its cellular structure by
changing: (i) the structure of the cell wall, (ii) the cell core pressure, and (iii)
the cell-cell cohesion. The relevant scale at which such phenomena occur, though
beyond the capacity of the human eye, can be followed by mechanical analysis
and mathematical models based on micro-structural evidence. This thesis focuses
on two fundamental mechanical aspects. First, it concerns the mechanism of cell
debonding, as this is key in explaining the softening of fruit and legumes dur-
ing storage or cooking, and is decisive for the perceived quality of food products.
Particular attention is given to the mathematical modelling of damage through
shear deformation as this has been largely neglected in the literature due to many
theoretical and computational difficulties. Second, it provides a multiscale hyper-
elastic framework which relates the stresses and strains of a whole structure to
those at the cell level, and vice versa. Specifically, the non-linear elastic moduli
at the macroscopic level are derived systematically from those at the cell level.

Chapter 1
Introduction
In this chapter, first, to motivate our work, we introduce some of the processes
which have resulted in the food products that we know and love today. We also
discuss the physical principles which affect the shape and cellular structure of
these products, and describe textural features and the link between texture and
mechanical properties at the cellular level. We then outline the continuum me-
chanics problems studied in this thesis.
1.1 Background and motivation
Fruits have evolved through natural selective processes. Appealing properties (to
the animals who choose to consume them) have promoted success of the plant
species [41]. Fruit ripens and becomes most attractive when the seeds are fully
developed, and thus mature seeds are transported to new locations through the
animal gut [155, p. 78]. Man has also domesticated plants using selective breeding
over millennia to enhance specific characteristics. This has lead to many of the
cultivars known today. For example, rapeseed, mustard, cabbage, kale, brussel
sprouts, broccoli and turnip have all been bred from an original genus of brassica,
where either the seeds, leaves, stems, buds, flowers or roots have been optimised
[40,80]. More recently, scientific methods such as genetic modification (GM) have
1.1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
been developed to further control food quality [158]. Desirable characteristics can
include: crop yield (shape, size and quantity), consistency/uniformity, time to
maturity, drought/pest resistance, taste, nutrition, appearance and texture.

1.1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
Tubers (e.g. potato) and legumes (e.g. lentils) are deceptively similar to fruit
(e.g. apple, pear). The cellular tissues are comprised of a cohesive network, the
middle lamella, binding together fluid-filled parenchyma cells [64] (Figure 1.1).
They can all be used as a food product, or to seed new plants in the next season.
Cell-cell disassociation (or debonding) affects the perceived texture but is also an
essential mechanism in new root growth [139]. The cytoplasm in mature apples
contains high levels of sugars, whereas in potatoes the sugars are converted into
starch. The cell walls also contain fibres important in our diets - a fibre-reinforced
matrix, comprising of hemicellulouse, pectins and glycoproteins [122]. This pri-
mary structural component, within the hydrostatic structure, can sustain large
deformations and the presence of fibres gives the walls a non-linear mechanical
response [28,46,59].
Gene activation and regulation are known to control functions, such as cell
division and expansion, but the shape and form is also developed by the physical
forces in the environment [67, p. 27]. An example of force-growth interaction is
the cellular structure of trabecular bone. As a load-bearing material, the cellular
structure is in alignment with the principal stretches across the geometry (approx-
imated by an isotropic homogeneous material under the same mechanical loading).
Wolffs law of bone remodelling is used to describe the active process that bones
adopt to realign to best resist applied load [141]. Similarly, in non-load-bearing
materials, such as fruit (primarily supporting their own body forces), the cell ge-
ometry and stiffness must also be influenced by some local mechanical forces. In
an apple, the central region (pith) has large radially organised elongated cells,
whereas in the cortex where there is less competition for space, the cells are more
uniform (and with larger intercellular spaces) [78] (see Figure 1.1 for reference).
Active remodelling can be observed in root growth as lateral roots initiate within
the mother root, which debonds its cells to allow for new growth [128].

1.1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
Texture can be defined as the physical response of a material or substance to
some contact stimuli, with textural characteristics stemming from the behaviours
of deformation, failure and flow [71]. We primarily assess texture through touch,
mouth feel and experiment, although our interpretation can also be influenced by
psychological factors [71]. Squeezing a fruit or vegetable can assess how ripe or
fresh the produce is [142]. A firm avocado is not yet ripe, while a soft/limp carrot
is stale. Taste and appearance are primary factors in many foods, but there is a
large selection of mild flavoured foods (bread, mashed potatoes) where texture is
the most important attribute [27]. The boiling of potato causes the parenchyma
cells to swell, increasing the cell core (turgor) pressure and cell wall tension, which
reduces its strength, allowing it to fail more easily [90]. Terminology used to
describe the texture of mash potato includes: soft, fresh, smooth, creamy, fluffy,
light, airy, lumpy, sticky, claggy, soggy, wet, dense, dry, hard, bitty, grainy and
mealy. These descriptive words are subjective and the terminology and definitions
used in literature are inconsistent [77].
The interactions we have with food (squeezing, slicing, chewing, etc.) can be
simulated with mechanical testing methods, such as compression, tension, pene-
tration and bending tests [17]. These engineering tools can quantify properties in
space and time, but the information we extract from them requires precise and
meaningful definition. Many have set out to standardise terminology, such as [71]:
 Hardness: force required to compress;
 Crispness: amount and pitch of sound generated;
 Juiciness: amount of fluid released.
A greater understanding of the relationship between cellular level properties
and texture may lead to overcoming quality problems in plant foods [77] and also
inform industrial processing techniques (such as the extraction of oils [24]).

1.2. CONTRIBUTION OF THIS THESIS
1.2 Contribution of this thesis
Texture is a manifestation of the micro- and macro-organisation of the tissue [77].
In apples and potatoes, the texture is dependant on the structural integrity of the
cell wall, middle lamella and turgor pressure [59,123,130]. The interplay between
the cell level parameters and the macroscopic behaviour at the tissue is investi-
gated in this work using the tools of finite elasticity theory and computational
finite element models. As a thesis in applied mathematics, the general approach
adopted here is outlined as follows:
1. Choose specific phenomenological processes to study;
2. Make appropriate simplifications and assumptions;
3. Create model problems;
4. Develop and apply suitable theoretical and computational frameworks;
5. Interpret and draw insight from the results.
1.2.1 Debonding
The first subject of our attention is the process of cell-cell debonding. The texture
named mealy, or mealiness occurs if less energy is required to debond cells rather
than to rupture/burst them [53,79]. This is desirable for baked and mashed potato
but not for potatoes in soups or salads where the structural integrity of the piece
is important [135]. In apples, this texture can be dry and bitty as the cells do not
release their fluid. The biological process which promotes this texture has three
major components [19,29,70,168]:
 Dismantling of the middle lamella;
 Degradation of the pectin in the cell walls;
 Dehydration and loss of turgor pressure.
Page 5
1.2. CONTRIBUTION OF THIS THESIS
If the pectin levels in the cell walls drops, then the cell walls become stiffer
and harder to rupture. If the intercellular bonds weaken and break down, then
less force needed to separate parenchyma cells. These, in turn, cause the failure
mode to transition from cell bursting/rupture to cell debonding. In addition, if
the force acting on the cell wall from the cell core decreases, then the cell wall will
be under less tension and its strength will increase. Further drops in pressure will
promote cell shrinking, which also pulls at the intercellular bonds [19,70,81].
This study aims to explore the interactions of these variables on the behaviour
of debonding. Shear is chosen as the primary deformation of study as it is ubiq-
uitous yet largely neglected in literature, due to difficulties in engineering testing
and measurement. In practice, our teeth are offset and so, during chewing, our
food is subjected to shearing forces. In this thesis, the investigation is approached
systematically, firstly considering the behaviour on the smallest scale and then
increasing size and complexity to find multiscale relationships.
We start with a purely analytical study of generalised shear in a transversely
isotropic cell wall, finding the permissible forms of the deformed face. This is used
to explore if two walls in unilateral contact can debond when they are sheared
together. The contribution of cellulose fibres to the mechanical properties of the
walls is captured by transverse isotropy, and of the cell core by the inter-cellular
pressure. Moving up the scale, we consider shearing of collections of cells in
unilateral contact. As the solution to this more complex problem relies on the finite
element method employed, computational scaling with model size is explored, such
that large scale models can be evaluated. This includes cell wall elasticity, cohesion
and cell core effects. A model parameter analysis is carried out to shed light on
the fundamental physical interactions observed in the literature for debonding in
fruit tissues.

1.2. CONTRIBUTION OF THIS THESIS
1.2.2 Multiscale stretching
Our second main focus is developing direct models which relate the cell level prop-
erties to the tissue stiffness. Here, a general continuum hyperelastic framework is
stated for creating new isotropic material models describing cellular materials. In
this case, we assume that no failure occurs at the microscopic scale, such as cell
rupturing or debonding. These models can be used to extend the idea of model
scalability further as these are easier to compute and can represent large tissue
samples. Such models are not limited to fruit and vegetables, but can describe
other non-load bearing structures, such as the brain, fat tissue and man-made
architectured materials, such as tissue scaffolds. The main restriction is that the
architecture deforms primarily by wall stretching rather than bending. They may
have cells which are closed and possibly pressurised by some compressible or in-
compressible contents. Alternatively, cells may be open collections of struts that
would not inhibit the transportation of fluid. Non-linear elastic parameters can be
derived for these new cellular material models, and used to measure the relation-
ship between scales, such as the effects of cell core stiffness on the macroscopic
non-linear shear modulus. The models can be applied to experimental data of
cellular tissues to estimate cell wall properties from the tissue elastic behaviour.
This thesis aims to provide insight into the mathematics of shearing materials,
computational procedures for cellular modelling, non-linear elastic moduli and an
insight into the multiscale relationships between parameters - which can all have
an impact on research and development in food science. This work could also
be applied to the creation of synthetic industrially engineered materials using the
developing technology of additive manufacture and 3D printing, which is briefly
explored as well.

Prerequisites and notation
2.1 Introduction
Robert Hooke is responsible for early work in elasticity and also first identified the
cellular structure of cork using early microscopes in 1665 [75, p. 112]. Hookes law
gives a linear relationship between force and deformation in a spring. A linearly
elastic (or Hookean) material is the fundamental principal in the infinitesimal
strain / small strain / linear elastic regime, which adequately explains the be-
haviour of many materials in engineering. This elastic regime was applied to
cellular materials in 1958 to investigate the relationships of cell wall stiffness and
turgor pressure on macroscopic stiffness [123]. An extensive overview of the me-
chanical behaviour of cellular structures, studied under the linearly elastic regime
is provided in [66] (see also [6365]).
2.1.1 Preliminary concepts from linear elasticity
When a sample undergoes mechanical deformation, the load and the displacement
can be recorded giving a force-deformation curve. The stiffness, rigidity or firmness
is the slope of the initial linear curve. This is considered elastic behaviour if the
original shape is recovered when loads are released. If the deformation rate changes
2.1. INTRODUCTION
significantly, this could be considered a yield point, which is often an indication of
some microscopic damage/rearrangement. In this case, the original shape is often
not recovered and the result is a plastic deformation. Large scale failure, observed
as a dramatic drop at the end of the force-displacement curve, is an indication of
the material strength and the required force for failure. The toughness is given by
the work done (force times deformation) to reach failure and is also represented
as the area under the curve.
Rescaling the force by the cross sectional area gives stress (Pa) and the defor-
mation by length gives strain (dimensionless). A stress-strain curve and the pa-
rameters derived from it are considered material properties as opposed to sample
properties. The following elastic parameters are important measures of material
properties and are considered constants in the linear elastic regime [113]:
 Youngs modulus, or elastic modulus E > 0 is the stiffness of a material in
uniaxial tension and is given by the slope of the stress-strain curve. The
larger the modulus, the stiffer the material and the more force is required to
deform it.
 Poissons ratio  is the negative ratio of lateral to longitudinal strain in
uniaxial tensile stress. Values of  are typically between -1 and 0.5 for an
isotropic material, with  = 0.5 for incompressible materials, which maintain
their volume under deformation.
 Shear modulus  is the ratio of shear stress to shear strain.
 Bulk modulus  represents the materials response to uniform compression
or hydrostatic pressure and the resulting decrease in volume. For nearly
incompressible materials  is large compared to , tending towards infinity
for true incompressibility.
For a linear isotropic material (with uniform behaviour in all directions), these
parameters are not independent: from any two, the others can be calculated.

2.2. LARGE-STRAIN DEFORMATION
2.1.2 Finite elasticity
Finite strain / finite elasticity approaches consider large deformations and capture
non-linear behaviour caused by changes in properties as the deformation progresses
[6,58,84]. These approaches raise numerous challenges and opportunities for new
(and often counter-intuitive) findings. The non-linear elasticity theory has been
applied to the study of cellular materials, capturing behaviours not observed in
the small strain regime, in [103,104,174].
Next, we summarise some elements of finite elasticity theory [67, 73, 88, 112,
127, 157] that are relevant for the results of this thesis, including: deformation of
a solid body (kinematics), stress within a continuum material, and boundary and
contact conditions, which are at the heart of this thesis.
2.2 Large-strain deformation
2.2.1 Deformation
Definition 2.2.1 (material body) A material body B is a set of material points
which occupy a compact domain of the 3D Euclidean space,   R3. The interior
of the body is an open, bounded and connected subset   R3 with boundary
 =  = \, which is Lipschitz continuous, and therefore a unit normal vector
n exists almost everywhere on .
Definition 2.2.2 (reference configuration) A reference (material) configuration
B0 is a chosen configuration where the material points have unique coordinates
X = (X1, X2, X3)  .
Definition 2.2.3 (current configuration) The current (spatial) configuration B is
the configuration after a deformation has been applied and has coordinates x =
(x1, x2, x3)  R3.
Page 10
2.2. LARGE-STRAIN DEFORMATION
Transformation from the reference configuration to the current configuration
is achieved with a map , such that:
x = (X). (2.2.1)
This map is a one-to-one, continuously differentiable vector field  :   R3
with det() > 0 on , such that  is injective on , to ensure that no two
material points in the interior of the body can map to the same location (no
interpenetration). Then the inverse map 1 also exists. The map needs not be
injective on  as self-contact is allowed on the body surface (see Figure 2.1).
Figure 2.1: Example of deformation with self-contact.
Definition 2.2.4 (deformation gradient) Changes in length, area and volume are
determined by the deformation gradient
 = F =

 . (2.2.2)
Then, the deformation of a line is given by F, change in area by cofF = det(F)FT
and volume by the Jacobian J = detF.
Definition 2.2.5 (isochoric deformation) If J = 1 then the volume remains con-
stant and the deformation is said to be isochoric.
Definition 2.2.6 (homogeneous deformation) If the deformation gradient is uni-
form (does not depend on material coordinates) then each part of the material
Page 11
2.2. LARGE-STRAIN DEFORMATION
deforms as the whole does and the deformation is said to be homogeneous.
Definition 2.2.7 (displacement field) The displacement field is denoted as:
u(X) = xX. (2.2.3)
Definition 2.2.8 (displacement gradient) The displacement gradient, more com-
monly used in engineering, is defined as:
u = F I, (2.2.4)
 ij = Fij  ij. (2.2.5)

Figure 2.2: Unit cube (left) subject to simple shear (right).
A simple shear (SS) deformation is characterised by [33, 35, 114]:
x1 = X1 + kX2 x2 = X2 x3 = X3, (2.2.6)
where k is a positive constant, i.e. the deformation parallel to the X1 axis is linear.
The gradient tensor for this deformation is
5 = F =

1 k 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
 . (2.2.7)
det(F) = 1, so this is an isochoric deformation.
Page 12
2.2. LARGE-STRAIN DEFORMATION
2.2.2 Deformation tensors
Deformation tensors are measures of an elementary vector after deformation. In
finite elasticity, the Cauchy-Green tensors are commonly used: the left Cauchy-
Green tensor B = FFT and the right Cauchy-Green tensor C = FTF. The
Green-Lagrange tensor E = 1/2(C  I) is commonly used in engineering and in
the finite element solver, Finite Elements for Biomechanics (FEBio) [92], employed
in this thesis.
In terms of the displacement gradient, the Green-Lagrange deformation tensor
is expressed as
Eij =
( ui
. (2.2.8)
In the linear elastic limit, the quadratic terms in the Green-Lagrange tensor
are ignored, giving the linear, infinitesimal deformation tensor
 = (ij)i,j=1,2,3, ij =
( ui
. (2.2.9)
In terms of the deformation gradient F, this is equal to
(F + FT ) I. (2.2.10)
Both Cauchy-Green tensors are symmetric positive definite (SPD) by construc-
tion and therefore have strictly positive eigenvalues {2i }i=1,2,3, where {i}i=1,2,3
are known as the principal stretch ratios or principal stretches. i can be found
by solving the characteristic equation
det(B I) = 3  I1(B)2 + I2(B) I3(B) = 0, (2.2.11)
Page 13
2.2. LARGE-STRAIN DEFORMATION
where Ii(B) are the principal invariants given by:
I1(B) = tr(B), (2.2.12)
I2(B) = tr(cof((B)) =
(tr(B)2  tr(B2)), (2.2.13)
I3(B) = det(B) = J
2 (as J = det(F) = det(FT )). (2.2.14)
Note that Ii(B) = Ii(C), for i = 1, 2, 3.
Equivalently, the principal invariants can be expressed as functions of the prin-
cipal stretches as follows:
I1(B) = 
1 + 
2 + 
3, (2.2.15)
I2(B) = 
2 + 
3 + 
1, (2.2.16)
I3(B) = 
3. (2.2.17)
Remark 2.2.10 When the right Cauchy-Green tensor is strictly diagonal, C =
diag(21, 
3), where {i}i=1,2,3 are the principal stretches, then
E = diag
(21  1
22  1
23  1
. (2.2.18)
Theorem 2.2.11 The Polar Decomposition Theorem states that any deformation
gradient F can be decomposed as follows,
F = RU = VR, (2.2.19)
where R is a rotation tensor, satisfying RRT = I, U is the right (material)
stretch tensor with respect to the reference configuration, V is the left (spatial)
stretch tensor with respect to the current configuration, and U,V are unique SPD
tensors.
Page 14
2.2. LARGE-STRAIN DEFORMATION
For the left and right Cauchy-Green deformation tensors, respectively,
C = FTF = UTRTRU = U2, (2.2.20)
B = FFT = VRRTVT = V2. (2.2.21)
We consider U, with strictly positive eigenvalues {i}i=1,2,3 and the correspond-
ing mutually orthogonal and normalised set of eigenvectors forming the columns
of a 3 3 matrix Q = {Qi}i=1,2,3, then the eigenvalue problem is
UQi = iQi. (2.2.22)
For C, the eigenvalue problem is
CQi = U
2Qi = 
iQi, (2.2.23)
and thus C and U have the same eigenvectors {Qi}i=1,2,3, and the eigenvalues
of C and the square of the eigenvalues of U. Here, {i}i=1,2,3 are the principal
stretches (as in (2.2.11)) and {Qi}i=1,2,3 are the Lagrangian (referential) principal
axes. It is then clear that C can be written in terms of a triaxial stretch along the
principal axes. The spectral decomposition of the right Cauchy-Green tensor is a
product of the principal stretches and the Lagrangian principal axes,
C = QQT , (2.2.24)
where  = diag(2i ).
In terms of the current configuration, we consider F = VR, and substituting
RRT = I, we have
F = RRTVR = RU, (2.2.25)
Page 15
2.3. HYPERELASTIC MATERIALS
where U = RTVR. Therefore,
C = (RTVR)2 = RTV2R. (2.2.26)
Substituting into the eigenvalue problem,
CQi = R
TV2RQi = 
iQi (2.2.27)
= RRTV2RQi = R
iQi (2.2.28)
= V2(RQi) = 
i (RQi). (2.2.29)
By letting RQi = qi, we find the eigenvalue problem for B,
Bqi = V
2qi = 
iqi, (2.2.30)
where q = {qi}i=1,2,3 are the Eulerian principal axes in terms of the current
configuration. The spectral decomposition of the left Cauchy-Green deformation
tensor is
B = qqT . (2.2.31)
2.3 Hyperelastic materials
A hyperelastic material is characterised by a constitutive law or strain energy den-
sity function, W(F), which depends on the deformation gradient F. It typically
involves various deterministic model parameters, such as the constant elastic mod-
uli for infinitesimal deformations of a material within a given class of functions.
The total strain energy over the domain of the reference configuration is then
W(F)dV. (2.3.1)
Page 16
2.3. HYPERELASTIC MATERIALS
The following assumptions are long-standing principles in isotropic finite elas-
ticity [67,127,157]:
The principle of material objectivity or frame indifference states that
the constitutive equations must be invariant under changes of frame of reference.
It requires that the scalar strain energy function is unaffected by a superimposed
rigid body transformation (which involves a change of position) after deformation,
i.e. W(RTF) =W(F), where R  SO(3) is a proper orthogonal tensor (rotation).
Material objectivity is guaranteed by considering strain energy functions defined
in terms of invariants.
The principle of material isotropy, or material symmetry requires that
scalar strain energy function is unaffected by a superimposed rigid-body trans-
formation prior to deformation, i.e. W(FQ) = W(F), where Q  SO(3). For
isotropic materials, the strain energy function is a symmetric function of ei-
ther the principal invariants W(F) = W(I1, I2, I3) or the principal stretches
W(F) =W(1, 2, 3).
2.3.1 Strain energy density functions
For homogeneous isotropic hyperelastic materials described by a strain energy
density function that depends only on the deformation gradient F, we assume
the energy to be identically zero at the unstressed state, i.e. W(I) = 0. By the
principle of objectivity, requiring that the strain energy function is unaffected by
a superimposed rigid-body deformation, and by the material symmetry, W can
be expressed equivalently in terms of the principal invariants I1, I2, I3, or alter-
natively, in terms of the principal stretches 1, 2, 3. In order to simplify the
notation, we write the strain-energy function as W and infer its argument from
the context.

where the fourth invariant I4 = (CM)M and M is a unit vector denoting direction
of transverse isotropy, in the reference configuration.

2.3.2 Stress
Cauchy stress
The Cauchy (true) stress represents the internal force per unit of deformed area
acting in the deformed solid. For a compressible hyperelastic material, it can be
expressed (in terms of the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor B) as follows [68],
 = 0I + 1B + 1B
1, (2.3.7)
where
, (2.3.8)
, (2.3.9)

. (2.3.10)
For an incompressible hyperelastic material, the Cauchy stress tensor takes the
 = pI + 1B + 1B1, (2.3.11)
where p is known as the hydrostatic pressure, or the Lagrange multiplier, for the
incompressibility constraints and I3 = det(B) = 1 [127, p. 200].
The Cauchy stress can also be written equivalently in terms of the right
Cauchy-Green deformation tensor C, as follows,
 = 2J1F
FT , (2.3.12)
where for an isotropic material,

1st Piola Kirchhoff stress
The 1st Piola Kirchhoff stress tensor represents the internal force per unit of
undeformed area acting within the deformed solid. By the Piola transform, it can
be expressed in terms of the Cauchy stress as
P = cof(F) = JFT . (2.3.14)
Equivalently, in terms of the strain energy density function W and the right
Cauchy-Green deformation tensor C,
P = 2F
. (2.3.15)
For an incompressible hyperelastic material, the 1st Piola Kirchhoff stress tensor
takes the form
 pFT . (2.3.16)
2.3.3 Principal stresses
In Section 2.2.2, it was shown that the Cauchy-Green deformation tensors can be
written in terms of principal stretches with respect to the principal directions. A
similar process can be applied to stresses to give strictly diagonal, triaxial stress
tensors, with the diagonal entries known as the principal stresses.
Principal Cauchy stresses
Consider the Cauchy stress defined by (2.3.7). Substituting the spectral decom-
position for B from (2.2.31) and likewise a decomposition of I in terms of q (as
Page 20
2.3. HYPERELASTIC MATERIALS
the identity matrix is indifferent to the change of basis), we obtain
 = 0qIq
T + 1qq
T + 1q
1qT (2.3.17)
= q(0I + 1 + 1
1)qT . (2.3.18)
Therefore, the Cauchy stress can also be written in terms of the basis q and takes
the form
 = 1q1  q1 + 2q2  q2 + 3q3  q3, (2.3.19)
where i are the principal stress values of the Cauchy stress tensor, and the tensor
product is defined as qi  qj = qiqTj .
If the Cauchy stress is written in terms the right Cauchy-Green deformation
tensor C, as in (2.3.12), then the principal Cauchy stresses take the form
i = 2J
12i
, i = 1, 2, 3 (no summation). (2.3.20)
By the chain rule, this becomes
i = 2J
12i
= 2J12i
= 2J12i
= J1i
. (2.3.21)
Principal 1st Piola Kirchhoff stress
Recalling that the 1st Piola Kirchhoff stress is related to the Cauchy stress by
(2.3.14), we obtain the principal stress values of the 1st Piola Kirchhoff stress
tensor,
Pi = Ji
, i = 1, 2, 3 (no summation). (2.3.22)
The spectral decomposition of the 1st Piola Kirchhoff stress in terms of prin-
Page 21
2.3. HYPERELASTIC MATERIALS
cipal stresses is
q1 Q1 +
q2 Q2 +
q3 Q3. (2.3.23)
where the second vector in the tensor products now represent the basis of the
reference state.
2.3.4 Material responses: Adscititious inequalities
Decades of theory and experiments have suggested that isotropic nonlinearly elas-
tic materials satisfy the following principles, known as the adscititious inequali-
ties [8, 93,108]:
Baker-Ericksen (BE) inequalities: the greatest principal stress occurs in the
direction of the greatest principal stretch. The BE inequalities in linear elasticity
reduce to  > 0 and  > 0, where  is the shear modulus and  is the bulk
modulus. For finite elasticity, the BE inequalities are formally stated as follows:
i 6= j  (i  j)(i  j) > 0, i, j = 1, 2, 3, (2.3.24)
where {i}i=1,2,3 and {i}i=1,2,3 are the principal stretches and stresses, respec-
tively, and  replaces the strict inequality > if any two principal stretches
are equal.
Considering the form of Cauchy stress given by (2.3.7), the BE inequalities can
also be written in terms of the elastic coefficients [8, 93,108] as follows,
j  1 > 0, i, j = 1, 2, 3. (2.3.25)
Pressure-compression (PC) inequality: each principal stress is a pressure
or a tension according if the corresponding principal stretch is a contraction or an

elongation, respectively.
i(i  1) > 0, i = 1, 2, 3. (2.3.26)
In practice, mean versions of the PC condition are used, as follows [113],
1(1  1) + 2(2  1) + 3(3  1) > 0, (2.3.27)
> 0, (2.3.28)
if not all i = 1, i = 1, 2, 3. In general, BE ; PC and PC ; BE [103].

equation
div  = b(x), (2.4.1)
where b(x) is the total body forces acting on the object, for example, due to
gravity.
The deformed configuration may not be known, so it can be more convenient
to define the equilibrium equation in terms of the reference configuration, giving
the Lagrangian equation
Div P = b0(X), (2.4.2)
where b0(X) = J
1b(x). In the absence of body forces b0(X) = 0.
The above governing equations are completed by a constitutive law, depending
on material properties (Section 2.3), and supplemented by boundary conditions.

2.4.2 Boundary conditions
The solution of a boundary value problem (BVP) is the displacement field u(X),
such that the equilibrium equation (2.4.2) is satisfied for all X  , together with
the following conditions on the boundary  = . Here, we consider the relatively
disjoint and open subset {0,D,N ,C}  , such that  \ (0  D  N  C)
has zero area [88, Chapter VI].
Dirichlet (displacement) conditions. The displacement is zero where the
object is fixed:
u(X) = 0 on 0. (2.4.3)
The displacement is prescribed:
u(X) = uD on D. (2.4.4)
Neumann (stress/traction) condition. External normal force applied at the
surface causes a normal stress:
 = n = g(x) on N , (2.4.5)
or equivalently, in the reference configuration,
P(X)N = g0(X) on N , (2.4.6)
where g(x) and g0(X) are the traction forces, and n and N are the normal vectors
to N . Here, the subscript 0 refers to a vector with respect to the reference
configuration.

Unilateral contact conditions. Acting on C , the area where contact is pos-
sible [88, 112]:
 Contact displacement condition (interpenetration of bodies cannot occur):
[uC ] N  d, where [uC ] = [u(X) u(X)] (2.4.7)
where X and X are material points potentially in contact (within different
bodies, or the same body for self-contact), N is the normal vector, [uC ] is
a function of the displacement giving the relative distance between the con-
tacting surfaces, and d  0 is a bounded measurable gap between surfaces,
which is the distance that cannot be exceeded between potential contacting
points.
 Normal contact pressure (surface loads cause compressive stress in the ma-
terial body):
P(X)N N = gC(X) N  g (2.4.8)
where gC(X) is the force acting on the contact surface and g  0 is the
cohesion parameter, a force that must be overcome to separate (debond) the
contacting surfaces.
 Complementarity condition (if there is contact pressure, then contact occurs,
while no contact results in no contact pressure):
([uC ] N d)(P(X)N N g) = 0 (2.4.9)
The complementarity condition is highlighted in Figure 2.3, with d = 0 and
g = 0.
 Newtons third law (if two material points map to the same point in space,

equal and opposite reaction forces occur):
gC(X) = P(X)N = P(X)N = gC(X) if (X) = (X) (2.4.10)
Contact No contact
Figure 2.3: The complementarity condition, with two bodies 1 and 2 in contact
(left) and not in contact (right). Where the bodies are in contact, a force is possible
through the contact interface, whereas when there is a gap uC < 0 the normal
force must be zero.
Here, general unilateral contact conditions are given for surfaces with cohesion
and a permissible bounded gap (in which objects are still considered in contact)
in the absence of friction [88, 112]. We can define contact in terms of the current
state or the reference state. Here, it is stated in terms of the reference state.
The complexity of contact problems modelling structural systems is generally
associated with the detection of contacts and openings, and the resolution of non-
linear equations for contact [102, 112]. These problems originate in the so-called
problem with ambiguous boundary conditions which was first posed by the Italian
mathematician Antonio Signorini in 1933 [149].
Page 26

2.4.3 Variational formulation
To form the variational problem which will be solved numerically, we need to define
the kinematically and statically admissible fields (conditions on displacement and
force, respectively). For simplicity, we assume the cohesion parameter and the
permissible gap to be zero, i.e. g = 0 and d = 0.
Definition 2.4.1 (kinematically admissible fields) The vector field u is a kine-
matically admissible displacement if and only if it simultaneously satisfies both
the Dirichlet boundary condition and the non-penetrative contact condition. We
denote the closed convex set of kinematically admissible fields by:
K = {u  W 1,s(;R3) |u(X) = uD on D, (2.4.11)
[uC ] N  0 on C}, (2.4.12)
where W 1,s is a Sobolev space. The condition s > 3/2 is sufficient for a solution
to exist [112].
Definition 2.4.2 (statically admissible fields) A tensor field F = I + u is a
statically admissible field if and only if W/F simultaneously satisfies the elasto-
static equilibrium condition, Neumann boundary condition and contact conditions
(contact pressure and Newtons third law - for every action, there is an equal and
opposite reaction). We denote the closed convex set of statically admissible gradi-
ent field by:
S = {F  Lq(;R) |Div
= 0 in , (2.4.13)
N = gN on N , (2.4.14)
N N = gC N  0 on C , (2.4.15)
gC(X) = gC(X) if (X) = (X) on C}, (2.4.16)
Page 27
2.4. BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS
where Lq is a Lebesgue space with q > 1, such that the function is greater than
once integrable [112].
2.4.4 Weak formulation (without contact)
If there are no contact boundaries to be resolved and no body forces present,
then the variational (weak) form of the potential energy is as follows: Find the
displacement u = xX  K such that
(X,F(u)) : vdV =
gN  vdA, (2.4.17)
with the admissible test field v = uu, u  K, gN is the normal surface traction
measured per unit area of the undeformed state. This can be solved by employing
the Newton-Raphson Method [88,109].
2.4.5 Weak formulation with unilateral contact
In the case of unilateral (i.e. non-penetrative, cohesionless, frictionless) contact,
and in the absence of body forces, the weak variational form of the potential energy
is as follows: Find the displacement u = xX  K such that
(X,F(u)) : vdV =
gN  vdA+
N  (v + u)dA (2.4.18)
with the admissible test field v = uu, u  K, gN is the normal surface traction
measured per unit area of the undeformed state.
Note the difference between the energy equation without contact (2.4.17) and
with contact (2.4.18) is the integral over the contact area. Solving (2.4.18) is more
complex and computationally expensive.

2.4.6 Solution schemes
In this thesis, there are two solution schemes used:
1. Semi-inverse method;
2. Finite element method.
Both approaches are briefly described, along with their strengths and weaknesses.
Semi-inverse method
In continuum mechanics, the semi-inverse method is one of the few analytical
techniques able to obtain exact solutions. The approach is as follows:
1. Describe:
(a) material, geometry and if it is static or dynamic,
(b) deformation,
2. Find:
(a) material responses (such as stress),
(b) mechanical behaviour.
Exact solutions provide powerful insights and direct understanding of the non-
linear behaviour of solids. The semi-inverse method depends on the deformation
being defined a priori. Often we assume homogeneous deformations and substitute
into the field equations, hoping that they simplify such that exact solutions to
BVPs can be acquired. For complex deformations, the deformation cannot be
described and the semi-inverse method cannot be employed. Here, approximate
solutions can be obtained by numerical procedure, where it is cast as a variational
problem used to generate finite element methods.
Page 29
2.4. BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS
Finite element method
The finite element method (FEM) is a numerical method to analyse an object
to approximate its deformation and stresses (see [88,124] and references therein).
FEM requires inputs such as geometry, material properties and boundary condi-
tions. The inputs create a variational formulation, such as (2.4.17), that requires
numerical integration. The solid is discretised into intervals, known as a mesh.
Each element (which could be a 4 node tetrahedral element) in the mesh has a
simple function to approximate its displacement. A large set of linear equations is
formulated where the unknowns are the displacement at each node. These linear
equations are then solved. FEBio is a Finite element solver specifically designed
for biomechanics and as such provides the requires hyperelastic material models
and boundary conditions appropriate for modelling biological tissue [92].
In the last decade the finite element method has become more powerful (with
increasing computing power) and highly accessible (with simple user interfaces
and work flows). It is capable of approximating complex coupled fields problems
and produces highly detailed visual outputs with colour maps for stress and dis-
placement. As it is an approximation, there are several factors which affect its
accuracy, such as the density of the mesh and the shape of elements used. It can
also suffer from diverging solutions in the minimization algorithm, for which the
cause is not always obvious. In contrast to the semi-inverse method, calculating
incompressible materials is not possible and the material stiffness is overestimated,
which is called element locking. However, no real material is truly incompress-
ible and the FEM software has a special class of nearly incompressible materials.
Remark 2.4.3 It is important to note that although physical phenomena are be-
ing explored, assumptions and simplifications must be made on the material, the
deformation and the boundary conditions.
Remark 2.4.4 In non-linear elasticity, multiple solutions can exist, as seen, for
example, in the case of the classic problem of the Rivlin cube [116, 137].

Debonding of sheared cell walls
3.1 Introduction
Many cellular solids are anisotropic due to the structural distribution of the cells as
well as the cell wall material aeolotropic properties. For example, at the millimetre
scale, wood is a cellular structure, which can be modelled as a hexagonal prismatic
honeycomb, while at the micrometre scale, the cell walls are fibre-reinforced com-
posites, made up of fibres of crystalline cellulose embedded an amorphous matrix of
hemicellulose and lignin. Features such as wood density, representing the relative
quantity of the cell wall in a given volume of wood tissue, and microfibril angle
play important roles in the stiffness and load bearing capacity of this complex
structure, and the impact of their variations on the tree biomechanical perfor-
mance is non-trivial [38, 56, 65, 66, 136]. While wood density varies significantly,
the composition and strength of the cell wall is less variable, and phenomena such
as cell debonding, commonly known as cell-peeling, consisting in the pulling
apart of two halves of the cell wall which debond along the central lamella are
responsible for fast and extensive crack propagation in many wood types [7]. The
behaviour of wood is captured well by the small strain regime, however analogous
behaviours occur in softer plant tissue, where large strains require a non-linear
framework.
3.1. INTRODUCTION
The relevant scale at which such phenomena occur, though beyond the capac-
ity of the human eye, can be followed by mechanical analysis and mathematical
models based on micro-structural evidence [18,89,122]. To effectively capture cell
wall debonding, mathematical models that account for the attachment between
cells, which in some structures may sufficiently weaken so that cells separate, are
required for improved predictions of large distortions and failure in cellular struc-
tures. However, obtaining suitable models that are, at the same time, physically
plausible, mathematically tractable, and computationally feasible raises many the-
oretical and numerical challenges.
In this study, we model cellular structures with non-linear hyperelastic cell
walls under large shear deformations [110], and incorporate cell wall material
anisotropy [33,35] and unilateral contact between neighbouring cells in our struc-
tural models [25, 26, 82, 88, 112]. The theoretical and computational challenges
raised by these models range from the non-linear deformation of the individual
elastic cell walls, to the detection of contact and openings between individual
cells. For the cell wall material, we consider one of the most common features
of many cellular solids, namely transverse isotropy, whereby the material has one
axis of rotational symmetry and the cell wall is stiffer in that direction [76,85,99].
The fibre direction is often aligned close to the vertical axis of the cell [64], with
fibre angle varying in-plane, as the cell walls are thin. We analyse the mechanical
behaviour of two cuboid cell walls in unilateral, frictionless, contact and subject
to generalised shear deformation, and find that, if the walls are in mutual contact
in the undeformed state, then gaps can form at the interface between the sheared
walls. Although the finite shear deformation of transversely isotropic hyperelastic
solids was previously analysed in the literature, a similar study of the simultaneous
shear deformation of two transversely isotropic bodies under unilateral contact has
not been carried out before. Furthermore, our theoretical and numerical results
help to explain the important role of internal cell pressure in some natural cellular
Page 32
3.2. FIBRE-REINFORCED CELL WALLS UNDER SHEAR
structures (such as apples, potatoes, pears, tomatoes, kiwi) where cell debond-
ing occurs. In Section 3.2, we analyse theoretically the mechanical behaviour
of two cuboids of incompressible transversely isotropic Mooney-Rivlin material
in unilateral (frictionless) contact and subject to simultaneous generalised shear
deformations, and demonstrate the appearance of gaps at the potential contact
zone. In Section 3.3, we extend this approach to include time dependence, for a
more simple material, such as the isotropic incompressible neo-Hookean material,
and find that walls have multiple modes of deformation, which suggests a greater
likelihood of debonding than the static case.
3.2 Fibre-reinforced cell walls under shear
The classical problem of generalised shear deformation involves finite plane de-
formations of a rectangular section of a material in which straight lines parallel
to the X1-axis are displaced relative to one another in the X2-direction, and the
straight lines parallel to the X2-axis in the undeformed state remain parallel af-
ter the deformation. When a cuboid cell wall is subject to generalised shear, the
deformation takes the form:
x1 = X1 + f(X2), x2 = X2, x3 = X3, (3.2.1)
where X = (X1, X2, X3) and x = (x1, x2, x3) are the Cartesian coordinates for the
reference (Lagrangian, material) and the deformed (Eulerian, spatial) representa-
tion, respectively, and f is a function to be determined (see Figure 3.1).
In particular, for the simple shear deformation, (3.2.1) takes the form:
x1 = X1 + kX2, x2 = X2, x3 = X3, (3.2.2)
where k is a positive constant (see Figure 3.2) [34, 35, 108, 157]. In this case, the
Page 33
3.2. FIBRE-REINFORCED CELL WALLS UNDER SHEAR

straight lines parallel to the X1 or the X2-axis in the undeformed state remain
straight and parallel after the deformation.
Figure 3.2: Unit cube (left) subject to simple shear (right).
For a cuboid wall of incompressible Mooney-Rivlin material under the deforma-
tion (3.2.1), Green & Adkins (1970) [68, pp. 127-129] found that the straight lines
parallel to the X2-axis deform in the shape of a quadratic parabola. In the semi-
inverse method where the deformation is defined, the surface tractions need not be
known a priori. However, a normal stress may be needed on the inclined faces to
enforce this deformation, which is important for defining the boundary conditions
in finite element simulations. The surface tractions for simple shear are calculated
by Mihai & Goriely (2013) [109] in their paper investigating the Poynting effect
in simple shear deformations of Mooney-type materials. The positive Poynting
effect in shear is obtained if the sheared faces tend to spread apart, while the
negative Poynting effect occurs if the sheared faces tend to draw together.
The generalised shear of anisotropic incompressible materials was analysed by
Page 34
3.2. FIBRE-REINFORCED CELL WALLS UNDER SHEAR
Merodio et. al [100] and Destrade et al. [36]. Both assume that the material is
clamped between two rigid plates and is infinite in length. To account for material
anisotropy, the strain energy density function is decomposed into an isotropic and
anisotropic part, such that
W =Wiso +Wani. (3.2.3)
They used an incompressible neo-Hookean material for Wiso and a standard rein-
forcing model for Wani, where
Wani =
(I4  1)
, (3.2.4)
with  > 0 being a material constant describing fibre stiffness. Merodio et. al [100]
found that instabilities such as fibre kinking can occur whereas Destrade et al. [36]
studied two families of fibres embedded int the material and found instabilities can
occur from their relative orientation.
Here, we consider two hyperelastic bodies made from an incompressible trans-
versely isotropic material containing one family of extensible fibres embedded in
a Mooney-Rivlin material, which is described by the strain energy density func-
tion [33,35,88]
W(I1, I2, I4) =
(I1  3) +
(I2  3) +
(I4  1)

where I1, I2, I3 are the principal isotropic invariants, I4 is the anisotropic invariant,
and C1 > 0, C2 > 0, and C4 > 0 are constants. If the fibres are contained in the
plane (X1, X2) and oriented in the direction

Figure 3.3: Two unit cubes in unilateral contact (left) deformed by generalised
shear (right), with the fibre direction M also shown.
Assuming that the bodies are initially in contact at a common interface, we
wish to determine whether they will separate if they are deformed simultaneously
by the generalised shear (see Figure 3.3). For the deformation (3.2.1), the defor-
mation gradient is equal to

and their principal invariants are

I2 = tr (Cof C) =
(tr C)
2  tr C2
= (f )2 + 3, (3.2.11)
I3 = det C = 1. (3.2.12)
For a deforming body made of a homogeneous incompressible transversely
isotropic hyperelastic material described by the strain energy functionW(I1, I2, I4),
the Cauchy stress tensor can be represented as
 = pI + 1B + 1B1 + 4FM FM, (3.2.13)
where 1 = 2W/I1, 1 = 2W/I2, and 4 = 2W/I4 are the material
response coefficients, and p is a Lagrange multiplier associated with incompress-
ibility (3.2.12).
In particular, if the material is reinforced with fibres which are oriented in the
direction (3.2.6), then
FM FM =

(f  sin + cos)
f  sin2  + sin cos 0
f  sin2  + sin cos sin2  0
0 0 0
 . (3.2.14)
Then, by (3.2.9) and (3.2.14), the components of the Cauchy stress (3.2.13)
Page 37
3.2. FIBRE-REINFORCED CELL WALLS UNDER SHEAR
take the form
11 = p+ 1 + 1 + 1(f )2 + 4 (f  sin + cos)
, (3.2.15)
12 = (1  1)f  + 4
f  sin2  + sin cos
, (3.2.16)
22 = p+ 1 + 1 + 1(f )2 + 4 sin2 , (3.2.17)
33 = p+ 1 + 1, (3.2.18)
13 = 23 = 0, (3.2.19)
where
1 = C1, 1 = C2, 4 = C4
(f )2 sin2  + 2f  sin cos
. (3.2.20)
Next, by the equilibrium equation in absence of body forces (2.4.1), it follows
= 0, (3.2.21)
= 0, (3.2.22)
= 0, (3.2.23)
and substituting (3.2.15)-(3.2.18) in (3.2.21)-(3.2.23) yields
(1  1)f  + 4
f  sin2  + sin cos
, (3.2.24)
1 + 1[(f
)2 + 1] + 4 sin
, (3.2.25)
= 0. (3.2.26)
Equation (3.2.26) shows that p is independent of x3, while equation (3.2.24)
implies that p is a linear function of x1. Next, integration of (3.2.25) with respect
Page 38
3.2. FIBRE-REINFORCED CELL WALLS UNDER SHEAR
to x2, gives
p(x1, x2) = 1 + 1 + 1(f
)2 + 4 sin
2  + ax1 + c, (3.2.27)
where a and c are undetermined constants. By (3.2.24) and (3.2.27),
(1  1)f  + 4
f  sin2  + sin cos
= a, (3.2.28)
and the constant c remains to be obtained from the contact conditions.
Integrating and substituting 1, 1, and 4 using (3.2.20) yields the following
cubic equation in f 
)3 sin4 + 3(f )2C4 sin
3  cos+
C1 + C2 + 2C4 sin
2  cos2 
f  = aX2 + b,
(3.2.29)
where b is an arbitrary constant.
In particular, if the fibres align in the X1-direction in the reference configura-
tion, i.e.  = 0, then 4 = 0 and (3.2.29) reduces to a linear equation in f , as in
the isotropic case.
We now focus our investigation on the special case when the fibres align in the
X2-direction, i.e.  = /2. In this case, by (3.2.27) and (3.2.20),
p(x1, x2) = C1  C2 + (C4  C2)(f )2 + ax1 + c, (3.2.30)
and the stress components (3.2.15)-(3.2.18) take the form:
11 = (C1 + C2  C4)(f )2 + C4(f )4  ax1  c, (3.2.31)
12 = (C1 + C2)f
 + C4(f
)3, (3.2.32)
22 = ax1  c, (3.2.33)
33 = (C2  C4)(f )2  ax1  c. (3.2.34)
Page 39
3.2. FIBRE-REINFORCED CELL WALLS UNDER SHEAR
The equation (3.2.29) simplifies as
)3 + (C1 + C2) f
 = aX2 + b, (3.2.35)
where C1 > 0, C2 > 0, and C4 > 0.
Assuming that the fibres are much stiffer than the matrix, so that C4  C1+C2,
(3.2.35) becomes
(f )3 +
C1 + C2
= aX2 + b. (3.2.36)
It can be approximated as
)3 = aX2 + b. (3.2.37)
3.2.1 Possible shear deformations
Assuming that, during the deformation, the points of coordinates (X1, 0, 0) remain
fixed and those of coordinates (1, X2, 0) are deformed into (1, X2 + k, 0), i.e.
f(0) = 0 and f(1) = k, (3.2.38)
the following two cases are distinguished:
(i) If a = 0, then (3.2.37) reduces to
f  =
. (3.2.39)
Then, by (3.2.38), this reduces to simple shear
X2 = kX2, (3.2.40)
with b = C4k
Page 40
3.2. FIBRE-REINFORCED CELL WALLS UNDER SHEAR
(ii) If a 6= 0, then solving (3.2.37) in f  yields
f  =
)1/3(
, (3.2.41)
and integration with respect to X2 gives
)1/3(
. (3.2.42)
Then, by (3.2.38), b = 0 and a = C4(4k/3)
3, i.e.
f = kX
2 . (3.2.43)
Note that in the paper [114], the Dirichlet condition f(1) = k was replaced with
the Neumann condition f (1) = k, with similar results. The Dirichlet conditions
in (3.2.38) are used as they are more general, for shear deformation.
3.2.2 The unilateral contact constraints
Now, we consider two unit cubes made from the same fibre-reinforced material de-
scribed by the strain energy function (3.2.5) and occupying the reference domains
[1, 0] [0, 1] [0, 1] and [0, 1] [0, 1] [0, 1], respectively, with the fibres aligning
in the X2-direction (i.e.  = /2). Assuming that the two cubes are sheared
simultaneously by (3.2.1), such that f(0) = 0, where f satisfies (3.2.40) for the
first cube and (3.2.43) for the second cube, while at the interface between the
two cubes, the contact conditions (2.4.7)-(2.4.10) are satisfied such that d = 0,
we wish to verify if it is possible for gaps to appear at the common interface
(X1, X2, X3)  {0}  [0, 1] [0, 1].
Since gaps do not appear when the two bodies deform by the same deformation,
we assume f1(X2) = kX2 as given by (3.2.40) for the first cube and f2(X2) = kX
as given by (3.2.43) for the second cube, such that f1(0) = f2(0) = 0. We wish
Page 41
3.2. FIBRE-REINFORCED CELL WALLS UNDER SHEAR
to verify if, in this case, the contact condition (2.4.7)-(2.4.10) are simultaneously
satisfied. The unit normal vector at any point on the curve (0, X2) is
N = [1, 0, 0]T . (3.2.44)
 The unilateral contact condition (2.4.7) between the deforming cubes is
0  [uC ] N = f1(X2) f2(X2), X2  (0, 1), (3.2.45)
and, since
f1(X2) = kX2 > kX
2 = f2(X2), for all X2  (0, 1), (3.2.46)
it follows that the condition (3.2.45) is satisfied.
 The normal forces condition (2.4.8) for each cube is
PN N = 11  f i12  g, X2  (0, 1), i = 1, 2. (3.2.47)
Equivalently, by (3.2.31)-(3.2.32),

2  ax1  c  g, X2  (0, 1), i = 1, 2, (3.2.48)
where x1 = X1 + fi(X2) for i = 1, 2.
Since X1 = 0 at the interface between the two bodies in the reference con-
figuration, the condition (3.2.48) is equivalent to
PN N = C4(f i)
2  afi  c  g, X2  (0, 1), i = 1, 2. (3.2.49)
Page 42
3.2. FIBRE-REINFORCED CELL WALLS UNDER SHEAR
For the first cube, a = 0 and (3.2.49) takes the form
PN N = C4k2  c1  g, (3.2.50)
where the constant c1 remains to be determined.
For the second cube, a = C4(4k/3)
3 and (3.2.49) becomes
PN N = C4
2 C4
2  c2  g,  X2  (0, 1),
(3.2.51)
where the constant c2 is to be determined.
 In the reference configuration, at X2 = 0, [uC ]N = 0 and the action-reaction
relation (2.4.10) implies
c2 = C4k
2 + c1. (3.2.52)
 By the complementarity condition (2.4.9), since by (3.2.46), the relative
displacement across the interface between the two cubes is strictly greater
than zero for all X2  (0, 1), the corresponding normal contact stress must
satisfy
PN N = g. (3.2.53)
For the first cube, (3.2.53) holds if and only if the equality in (3.2.50) is
satisfied, i.e.
c1 = C4k2  g. (3.2.54)
For the second cube, by (3.2.52) and (3.2.54),
c2 = g, (3.2.55)
Page 43
3.2. FIBRE-REINFORCED CELL WALLS UNDER SHEAR
and (3.2.51) simplifies as follows
2  C4
2  0,  X2  (0, 1). (3.2.56)
Note that, by taking k  0, the equality in (3.2.56) is satisfied to the first
order in k, hence (3.2.53) holds for sufficiently small k.
Under the given assumptions and prescribed deformation, the contact condi-
tions (2.4.7)-(2.4.10) with d = 0 are simultaneously satisfied for both cubes. If
the contact conditions had not been satisfied then we would have concluded that
the assumptions and/or prescribed deformation were incorrect, but since they are
satisfied, it is possible for gaps to appear at the common interface between the
two cubes when these are sheared simultaneously.
3.2.3 The cohesive effect of internal cell pressure
We now turn our attention to the normal stresses (3.2.48) at the external faces
(X1, X2, X3)  [1, 1] [0, 1] [0, 1]. Assuming that the cells are filled and there
is a normal force g0  g exerted by the cell core on the faces of the cell walls,
then, at these faces,
PN N = C4(f )2  aX1  af  c = g0, X2  (0, 1), (3.2.57)
where X1  {1, 1}.
For the first cube, the normal stresses (3.2.57) are equal to that at the interface
between the two cubes, i.e.
PN N = C4k2  c1 = g0. (3.2.58)
Page 44
3.2. FIBRE-REINFORCED CELL WALLS UNDER SHEAR
For the second cube, (3.2.57) takes the form
PNN = C4
2 C4
k3C4
2 c2 = g0,X2  (0, 1),
(3.2.59)
and if k  0, then these stresses are also equal to the normal stress at the interface
between the two cubes to the first order in k.
Consequently, if g0 = g, then the contact conditions are satisfied and we cor-
rectly assumed that gaps may appear at the interface between the two cubes. Else
if g0 < g, then the complementarity condition is not met and the assumption of
gaps appearing between the cell walls does not hold. In particular, when g = 0,
if the cells are empty, i.e. g0 = 0, then the sheared cell walls may debond due
to gaps appearing between adjacent cell walls, whereas if the cells are filled and
there is internal pressure g0 < 0 exerted on the cell walls, then these walls remain
in full contact during the generalised shear deformation.
3.2.4 Surface tractions
The semi-inverse method requires the deformation to be defined a priori and then
an exact solution to a BVP can be attempted. The required surface tractions to
enforce the deformation do not need to be defined a priori and can depend on the
solution to the BVP and the contact conditions. Here we calculate the normal and
tangential stresses which must be applied to the faces in the planes X1 = 1, 0, 1,
to enforce these deformations.
The normal and tangential stresses on the vertical cell walls in order to ensure
the prescribed deformation are given by
PN = N  (PN), (3.2.60)
PT = (PN) [N  (PN)]N, (3.2.61)
Page 45
3.2. FIBRE-REINFORCED CELL WALLS UNDER SHEAR
where N = [1, 0, 0]T in the reference configuration. In terms of the Cauchy stress
components this becomes
PN = 11  f 12, (3.2.62)

21  f 22
31  f 32
 =

 . (3.2.63)
From the Cauchy stresses given in (3.2.31)-(3.2.34)
PN = C4(f )2  ax1  c, (3.2.64)
PT2 = (C1 + C2 + ax1 + c)f
 + C4(f
)3, (3.2.65)
PT3 = 0. (3.2.66)
By (3.2.35) and x1 = X1 + f(X2),
PN = C4(f )2  a(X1 + f) c, (3.2.67)
PT2 = aX2 + b+ (ax1 + c)f
 = a(X2 +X1f
 + ff ) + b+ cf . (3.2.68)
From Section 3.2.1, we know that for the cube deformed by f = kX2: a = 0 and
b = C4k
3, and for the cube deformed by f = kX
2 : a = C4(4k/3)
3 and b = 0.
The values for c for each cube are defined in (3.2.54)-(3.2.55), resulting from the
complementarity condition. Thus, for the first cube
PN = g, (3.2.69)
PT2 = gk. (3.2.70)
Page 46
3.2. FIBRE-REINFORCED CELL WALLS UNDER SHEAR
and for the second cube,
PN = g  C4(4k/3)2X
2  C4(4k/3)
3X1  C4k(4k/3)3X
2 , (3.2.71)
PT2 = g(4k/3)X
2 + C4(4k/3)
3X2 + C4(4k/3)
2 + C4k(4k/3)
(3.2.72)
Considering small deformation, a first order approximation in k reduces the
surface tractions on the second cube to
PN = g, (3.2.73)
PT2 = g(4k/3)X
2 . (3.2.74)
The dependence on X2 in the second cubes tangential stress is hard to implement
in simulation, but essential to enforce the exact deformation prescribed. Without
these surface tractions a different deformation would occur and one that that
would be less tractable using the semi-inverse method.
3.2.5 Numerical examples
In this section, we illustrate numerically the shear deformation of two hypere-
lastic cuboid walls in unilateral contact, with and without internal cell pressure
and demonstrate its cohesive effect. The numerical example presented here was
realised within the open-source Finite Elements for Biomechanics (FEBio) soft-
ware environment [92], and in particular, unilateral contact was approximated
numerically using the inbuilt FEBio finite element implementation.
First, we consider two cuboid walls of hyperelastic material described by (3.2.75)
and occupying the domains [1, 0][1, 1][0, 1] and [0, 1][1, 1][0, 1], respec-
tively, in the undeformed state, as in Figure 3.4. The bodies are allowed frictionless
non-penetrative contact on the faces in the plane X1 = 0. Both cuboids are de-
formed simultaneously by imposing the following Dirichlet boundary conditions:
Page 47
3.2. FIBRE-REINFORCED CELL WALLS UNDER SHEAR
 u1 = k on faces in the plane X2 = 1;
 u1 = k on faces in the plane X2 = 0;
 u2 = 0 on faces in the planes X2 = 0, 1;
 u3 = 0 on faces in the planes X1 = 1, 0, 1, X2 = 0, 1 and X3 = 0, 1,
where ui is a displacement in the i
th direction. The following Neumann boundary
conditions are applied:
 g1,g2,g3 = 0 on faces in the planes X1 = 1, 0, 1,
where gi is a force applied in the i
th direction. These surface tractions are derived
from (3.2.69)-(3.2.74) where the cohesion parameter g = 0. If we did not set
g = 0 then there would have been a dependence on X2 which is not possible to
implement in FEBio. It is also important to highlight that g1 and g2 are defined in
the reference state and the normal N does not change throughout the deformation.
In a second simulation, in addition to the above boundary conditions, an extra
Neumann boundary condition is applied:
 g1 = g0 on faces in the plane X1 = 1, 1,
where the g0 = 0.1 MPa represents the force from a cell core.

In the computer simulation, the transverse isotropic hyperelastic material is
characterised by the strain energy function [162]
W(I1, I2, I4) =
(I1  3) +
(I2  3) +
(ln J)2 +
(I4  1)2, (3.2.75)
where C1 = 0.1 MPa, C2 = 0.01 MPa,  = 100 MPa, C4 = 1 MPa, and the fibre
direction is parallel to the contact surface [168].
The undeformed and deformed bodies are represented in Figure 3.5A, where
gaps across their interface are captured in the deformed state. In Figure 3.5B, for
the two bodies, normal pressure g0 is also applied on the two external side surfaces,
causing the bodies to remain in full (active) contact after the deformation.
Figure 3.5: Finite element representation of two cuboids of hyperelastic material in
mutual unilateral contact, with dimensionless size 121 each in the undeformed
state (left), and under generalised shear deformation (right), when the lateral
external sides are (A) free and (B) subject to uniform normal pressure. The
colour bar indicates displacements in the X1- (horizontal) direction.
For FEM, the contact interfaces are split into discrete sections for which the de-
formation is approximated at each time step. Solutions in the semi-inverse method
which do not satisfy the complementarity conditions could still be approximated
by FEM since potential interpenetration would change the deformation in the lo-

cal area - resulting with areas of contact and gaps, both on the same interface.
These results support that of the previous section where gaps can occur between
bodies under generalised shear. Also, they support the notion that intercellular
pressure can work as a cohesive force between pairs of cell walls.
3.3 Isotropic cell walls under time-dependant shear
deformation
Now we consider the problem of time-dependant generalised shear deformation
where a large number of solutions for the shape of the deformed face f may exist.
To maintain tractability of the solutions for shear motion, we restrict attention to
the incompressible neo-Hookean material and find general solutions of generalised
shear motion and generalised shear. This is presented without contact, but the
analysis from the previous section could be applied.
For the deformation of a large-strain and time-dependant body, the Eulerian
field equation is
x = div + b (3.3.1)
 = T (3.3.2)
where x = (X, t) is the motion of the body with respect to time,  is the density
of the elastic body (constant), b = b(x, t) is body force (assumed to be zero here),
 represents partial derivative w.r.t t and , partial w.r.t X2 (Newtons notation).
When a cuboid cell wall is subject to generalised shear motion, the deformation
takes the form:
x1 = X1 + f(X2, t), x2 = X2, x3 = X3, (3.3.3)
where X = (X1, X2, X3) and x = (x1, x2, x3) are the Cartesian coordinates for the
reference (Lagrangian, material) and the deformed (Eulerian, spatial) representa-

tion, respectively, and f is a function to be determined.
The deformation gradient F, the left Cauchy-Green tensor B and its inverse

The Cauchy stress for an incompressible material is

where p is an undetermined hydrostatic pressure and 1, 1 are material depen-
dant constants. Then,

From (3.3.1), in the absence of body forces, the equations of motion must
satisfy:
= f ,
(3.3.7)
As generalised shear motion is not a homogeneous deformation, the hydrostatic

stress is not necessarily constant, so the equilibrium equations can be written as
= (1  1)f   f , (3.3.8)
= 21f
f , (3.3.9)
= 0. (3.3.10)
Restricting our attention to the incompressible neo-Hookean material model,
given by
(I1  3), (3.3.11)
we find that (3.3.8-3.3.10) simplifies to
= f   f , (3.3.12)
= 0, (3.3.13)
= 0. (3.3.14)
= 0 implies that p is not dependant on x2 or x3, i.e. p = p(x1, t).
Further, if we assume that there is zero net energy in the x1 direction on the
contact boundary C , 
11dx1 = 0, (3.3.15)
then we can conclude that p = p(t).

Surface tractions
The normal and tangential stresses on the vertical cell walls in order to ensure the
prescribed deformation are given by
PN = 11  f 12 =  p, (3.3.16)

21  f 22
31  f 32
 =

 . (3.3.17)
As it is assumed that p(t) is, at most, a function of time and not on deformation
or position, then the tractions could be simply applied in simulation, and holds
true for all possible functions f found from solving the BVP.
3.3.1 Solving the boundary value problem
As p is only a function of time, the equilibrium equations reduce to an equation
for f , in the form of a one dimensional wave equation,
f . (3.3.18)
where
/ is the speed of the wave propagation.
The following boundary conditions are used:
f(0, t) = 0, f(L, t) = k, (3.3.19)
with initial conditions:
f(X2, 0) = f0(X2), f(X2, 0) = f0(X2). (3.3.20)
To solve this equation with non-homogeneous boundary conditions, we first
Page 53
3.3. ISOTROPIC CELL WALLS UNDER TIME-DEPENDANT SHEAR
DEFORMATION
consider a time independent solution f E = 0, with boundary conditions fE(0) = 0
and fE(L) = k. The steady state solution is simply
X2. (3.3.21)
Next we introduce v(X2, t) = f(X2, t)  fE(X2), which is a solution to the
problem
v, (3.3.22)
with homogeneous boundary conditions
v(0, t) = 0, v(L, t) = 0. (3.3.23)
Using separation of variables [69], we find the general solution for v(x, t) has
the form
v(X2, t) =
[An cos(t) +Bn sin(t)] sin(X2), (3.3.24)
where  = (n/L)
/ and  = n/L.
Therefore the general solution for f(X2, t) has the form
f(X2, t) =
[An cos(t) +Bn sin(t)] sin(X2) (3.3.25)
with  = (n/L)
/ and  = n/L.
To determine the constants An and Bn, consider now the initial conditions,
f(X2, 0) =
An sin(X2) = f0(X2), (3.3.26)
f(X2, 0) =
Bn sin(X2) = f0(X2). (3.3.27)
Page 54
3.3. ISOTROPIC CELL WALLS UNDER TIME-DEPENDANT SHEAR

Using Fourier series, a function g(x) on 0 < x < L can be written in the form
g(x) =
n sin(x), (3.3.28)
and has constants n in the form
g(x) sin(x)dx. (3.3.29)
Letting g(x) = (f0(X2) (k/L)X2) and An = n, we find
f0(X2)
sin(X2)dX2. (3.3.30)
Similarly, letting g(x) = f0(X2) and Bn = n, we find
f0(X2) sin(X2)dX2. (3.3.31)
3.3.2 The general solution of generalised shear motion
The general solution of generalised shear motion in an incompressible neo-Hookean
material is
f(X2, t) =
[An cos(t) +Bn sin(t)] sin(X2) (3.3.32)
f0(X2)
sin(X2)dX2. (3.3.33)
f0(X2) sin(X2)dX2. (3.3.34)
where  = (n/L)
/ and  = n/L.
In general there are different modes of oscillations present in generalised time-
dependant shear motion. For any mode n and fixed X2 = X
X = Dn and

For an increase in t by one second, the argument of cos and sin increases by

fore to increase the frequency of oscillation one can increase the shear modulus ,
decrease the density  or decrease the length of the beam L.
Conversely for any mode n and fixed t = t, [An cos(t

purposes.

3.4 Summary
Many natural structures are cellular solids at millimetre scale and fibre-reinforced
composites at micrometer scale (e.g. plant stems, vegetables, fruit). For these
structures, physical properties are associated with the mechanical responses of the
structural elements under applied forces, and phenomena such as cell separation
through debonding of the middle lamella in cell walls is important for perceived
behaviour and texture.
To explore such phenomena, we model cellular structures with non-linear hy-
perelastic cell walls under large shear deformations and incorporate cell wall ma-
terial anisotropy and unilateral contact between neighbouring cells in our models.
Analytically, we show that, for two cuboid walls in unilateral contact and subject
Page 57
3.4. SUMMARY
to generalised shear, gaps can appear at the interface between the deforming walls.
Although the deformation of transversely isotropic materials has been studied in
the literature, they have not been studied in the context of contact mechanics and
therefore this research is novel. This work has been published in the Journal of
Engineering Mathematics [114].
The semi-inverse method is powerful for obtaining exact analytic solutions.
The deformation gradient is assumed and then the material responses and nec-
essary tractions are calculated. Here we found a possible solution which had
complex tractions which depend on the X2 direction, which raises questions about
the physical plausibility of the deformation. However, employed in Section 3.3,
for time-dependant generalised shear deformation, we consider a simple isotropic
incompressible neo-Hookean material and find a plethora of possible behaviours
that have not been discussed in the literature, including a general solution for
generalised shear. In terms of contact of two cell walls in unilateral contact, the
amount of possible forms of f in generalised shear means that gaps are more likely
to occur. Choosing two solutions from (3.3.41), the analysis from Section 3.2 could
be repeated to find if the solutions are compatible. In addition, if time-dependent
solutions were considered, then the frequency of oscillation can vary, if for example
the values of  differ slightly.
In these works on fibre reinforced materials, the fibre angle is deterministic
and the maximum and minimum are considered (/2 and 0), whereas the fibre
direction in a real cell wall is stochastic and the mean fibre direction could be
anywhere in the range 0    /2. Stochastic fibre directions (see [97] for details)
could be incorporated into these models, but the results may become complex and
intractable. The work could be further expanded for compressible materials and
for shear with superimposed triaxial stretch. The transversely isotropic case is
currently limited to the case where fibres are much stiffer than the isotropic matrix
and this middle ground could be explored further, where O(C4)  O(C1 + C2).

Debonding of cellular tissue in
shear
4.1 Introduction
Cell separation through debonding of the middle lamella in cell walls is key in ex-
plaining the property or behaviour of fruit and legumes during maturation, storage
or cooking, and is decisive for the quality of food products [81,91,145]. Fruit tissue
is a hydrostatic structure in which individual fluid-filled cells provide resistance to
compressive forces, and the fluid pressure may also influence the elastic properties
of the cell walls [29, 103]. Physical evidence suggests that the firmness of fruit
(apple, pear, tomato) decreases during pre-harvest ripening, when the cell walls
of the fruit tissue become softer, and continues to decrease in post-harvest storage
due to the loss of cell-to-cell contact, even though the stiffness of the cell walls in-
creases [5,14,168]. Ripening also involves a reduction in turgor pressure, and other
physiological and mechanical factors, such as changes in cell size, wall thickness,
and composition, may also contribute to changes in the strength and elasticity of
the cell walls. For example, during cool storage, cells from high-maturity fruit tend
to lose intercellular cohesion but maintain cell wall integrity, while cells from low-
maturity fruit tend to maintain relatively high cell-cell cohesion but the strength
4.1. INTRODUCTION
of the cell wall declines, so the cells are easily ruptured [53,70]. Cellular pressure
also decreases after harvest which causes cell wall relaxation and could acceler-
ate the process of loss of cohesion. However, both the cell wall strength and the
intercellular cohesion decline as fruit enter the over-ripe stage [19].
Figure 4.1: Example of debonded fruit cells, leaving cells with their cell walls
intact at the fracture surface, or debonding zone.
We extend our analysis from the previous chapter to the investigation of finite
element models of periodic structures with hexagonal cells, and find that, when
the structures are sheared, gaps appear between adjacent cell walls, causing ex-
tensive cell separation diagonally across the structure. To overcome difficulties
in the resolution of non-linear equations for contact, we extend the successive
deformation decomposition procedure proposed in [111], where seamless cellular
structures were treated, to structures with non-penetrative intercellular contact as
follows: (i) first, a continuous deformation is computed for the entire structure, as
in a compact elastic solid, where only the external boundary conditions and cell-
cell pressures are imposed, while the cells remain in mutual contact; (ii) then, for
the predeformed structure, the micro-structural properties at individual cell level,
such as the unilateral contact between cell walls are taken into account. For the
computer simulations, the two-step procedure proved significantly faster and more
accurate than when the external boundary conditions and contact constraints were
imposed simultaneously in a single step.
Page 60
4.1. INTRODUCTION
Next, we address the question as to what is the influence of the cell-cell cohesion
on the intercellular contact where debonding is possible? To answer this question,
we impose uniform normal pressure on the contacting cell walls, and find that
separation is less likely between cells with high cell pressure than between cells
where the internal pressure is low. This is in agreement with physical observations
that, under applied force, tissue from high-maturity fruit (apple, pear) breaks
down into small clumps of undamaged cells, while cell walls from less mature
fruit, which are relatively strongly attached to each other, will rupture [70].
Our computer simulations of cellular bodies with hyperelastic cell walls in
mutual non-penetrative contact under large shear deformation, and the two-step
strategy which we employ to solve the multibody contact problems more efficiently
are novel. In Section 4.4, we present a set of computer models representing groups
of hexagonal cells in mutual unilateral contact for which we explore the effects of
large-strain deformations.
4.1.1 Summary of FEBio definitions
A number of concepts and definitions are necessary, that are either general for
FEM, or particular for FEBio [92], for the implementations in this chapter.
Quasi-static analysis - Structural analysis in FEBio will be achieved in a quasi-
static setting, such that deformation happens slowly enough for the system to
remain in internal equilibrium. The deformation can equally be considered as in-
stantaneous, with no time-dependence.
Analysis step - One or many analysis steps can be defined, which are collections
of all the constraints, such as boundary conditions, loads, contact interfaces, etc.
The initial analysis step serves a special purpose since it collects all the con-
straints that do not depend on a particular step. Additional analysis steps can be
added which have constraints specific to that step.
Time step - Within each analysis step, a number of time steps are defined. Not

to be confused with the notion of time, these ordered steps are used for incre-
menting the constraints, such that, e.g., a boundary condition can be applied in
predefined step sizes. For each time step the solution for that step is obtained by
a succession of equilibrium iterations using the Newton-Raphson method, where
each iteration brings the model (hopefully) closer to the solution for that step.
Failure to converge at a particular time step causes a roll-back to an interpolated
lower time step. Failure to converge can be caused by a number of reasons, in-
cluding an element becoming so distorted that it inverts J  0, or a convergence
tolerance not being reached at a contact interface.
Sliding contact - A sliding contact interface defines a non-penetration constraint
between two surfaces. This means that the surfaces are allowed to separate and
slide across each other, but are not allowed to penetrate each other. This is equiv-
alent the frictionless unilateral contact conditions defined in Section 2.4.2.
Tied contact - Tied interfaces can be used to tie two non-conforming surfaces
together, such that they are attached and do not debond throughout deformation.
If both surfaces have compatible nodes and have the same material defined, then
they can be considered as deforming together as one continuous material.
4.2 Problem formulation
Computationally, we construct finite element models in FEBio [92] with uniform
cells consisting of non-linear hyperelastic cell walls with uniform cell wall thickness,
which surround cellular inclusions [103,104]. Adjacent cells are bound together via
intercellular pressure [67,73,127] and unilateral contact between cells [88,112,114].
The cell inclusions are represented as an elastic solid with low elastic modulus and
zero initial stress. The pressure from the cell core (in the undeformed state) are
represented as pressure loads on the internal cell walls. Tissues are subjected to
shear of magnitude uX (displacement in the X direction) and gaps are created
between cells, which are measured and used to quantify debonding.
Page 62
4.2. PROBLEM FORMULATION
4.2.1 Geometry and mesh
Within fruit tissues, cells are arranged randomly, as demonstrated in Figure 4.1.
Voronoi tessellations (2D and 3D) are packings that represent the randomised as-
pect of natural cellular materials. Geometric simplifications, such as uniform cell
geometry and packing, allow for ordered and repeatable experiment which can
be accurately scaled. In a hexagonal prism (or honeycomb) packing, each cell
wall has equal length and the cell is in maximum contact with six neighbouring
cells, without intercellular spaces. Hexagonal geometry is often used to approx-
imate cellular structures in analysis [63, 66, 174]. Tetrakaidecahedrons (14 sided
stackable polyhedra with all edges equal length) can create 3D space filling pack-
ings similar to those found in biologically grown cellular materials [65]. Potato
parenchyma packings are nearly isotropic with very few empty voids between cells
and tetrakaidecahedral modelling has been found to represent this well [79].
As this is a study on the contact between cells and overcoming some of the
computational difficulties, hexagonal prism cell geometry is chosen as each cell
only has 6 contact interfaces. The cell core is also hexagonal and is fixed to the
surrounding cell wall. We refer to the model size by the number of horizontal cells
on the bottom row, by the number of vertical cells, for example 33, 45 and 57.
On the top and bottom boundaries, extra tabs are added for the application of
boundary conditions. Tabs are shown in Figure 4.2 (left). The geometries are cre-
ated using open source software OpenSCAD, a programming based 3D modelling
program, and then imported into FEBio and meshed using the inbuilt tetgen
algorithm. Mesh refinements were carried out to assess deformation convergence
and found that the mesh, with elements of size 0.2, is sufficient. Adding further
mesh complexity adds to computational time greatly, limits potential model sizes
and does not refine the results substantially further.

4.2.2 Contact and cohesion
Contact conditions are prescribed on the cell walls which share a common in-
terface. For frictionless, non-penetrative contact, a sliding contact interface is
used. Parameter values used for defining this interface can be found in Appendix
C. Le Tallec (1994) [88, Chapter VI] provides existence results for the contact
formulation (2.4.18) and explains the adaptation to the numerical algorithm to
detecting contact. The potential contact surface has a subset where contact ac-
tually occurs. A predictor-corrector algorithm predicts the subset and calculates
the contact-free equations (2.4.17) excluding this subset. Then it checks for points
where the contact conditions (non-penetration, compressive contact and comple-
mentarity (2.4.7-2.4.9)) have been violated and adds these points to the contact
subset. This process is iterative and ends when the contact subset stays invariant
between iterations.
It is possible to create a cohesive contact interface in FEBio by implement-
ing the source code edited by Bronik (2017) [21], but the computational cost is
extremely high for multiple contacts. We found a more computationally effective
solution to implementing cohesion in our models, as follows: as a cohesive contact
interface requires a tensile force over a critical value g to separate faces, we instead
Page 64
4.2. PROBLEM FORMULATION
implement balanced normal non-linear surface loads between each pair of contact-
ing walls. In the reference configuration, the pressures are equal and opposite on
both sides of the cell wall pairs and thus has zero net force. The result is a force
g which must be overcome to separate cell wall pairs. Figure 4.2 (right) shows
the application of these surface loads on the internal cell surfaces and the external
tissue faces to maintain zero net force. The non-linear pressure load applies in a
normal direction to the current state of a surface.
4.2.3 Modelling cell core
The predominant mechanism of cell wall behaviour in empty cells is wall bending
but in fluid filled cells this becomes cell wall stretching. Stretching requires more
stress than bending and thus increases yield strength of the material [65]. It is
common to assume that as cells are compacted together, cell wall bending can be
neglected [130,131]. The effect of having an internal fluid in closed compartments
is that when deformation occurs (assuming no rupture of cell walls) the cells
volume is conserved and the densification stage of the stress-strain curve does not
happen [103].
As in other studies, fluid viscosity is ignored and the walls are assumed to be
impermeable so there is no relaxation of the cell due to fluid migration, which
is reasonable in the short time scale where forces are exerted [58, 130]. We also
assume initial pressure is equal in all cells.
In [130], the stress in a deformed cell wall of a pressurised cell is decomposed
as the sum of (a) the stress in the undeformed cell wall of the pressurised cell and
(b) the stress of the deformed cell wall in the unpressurised cell. Similarly here,
the cell inclusions are represented in two ways: (a) as a prescribed normal pressure
force acting on the surface of the cell walls; (b) as an elastic solid with low elastic
modulus and zero initial stress. In Section 3.2.3, it was proved theoretically that
modelling cell inclusions by imposing a uniform normal force on the surface of the

cell walls is equivalent to imposing intercellular cohesion.

The cell walls are made from a nearly incompressible isotropic homogeneous
Mooney-type hyperelastic material [121,138],
(I1  3) +
(I2  3) +
(ln J)2, (4.2.1)
where C1 = 1 MPa, C2 = 0.1 MPa and  = 100 MPa is the bulk modulus.
We choose to model the fluid also as a homogeneous Mooney-Rivlin material,
which is nearly incompressible, with parameters C1 and C2 being at least one order
of magnitude smaller than the cell wall material, whilst keeping the bulk modulus
 = 100 MPa for the compressibility restraint.

Shear deformation is applied by the following Dirichlet boundary conditions:

 uY = 0 on both top and bottom tabs;
Page 66
4.2. PROBLEM FORMULATION
 uY = 0 on central cell faces (front and back, excluding boundary layers);
 uZ = 0 on all external faces and tabs (front and back, including external
tissue boundary),
where ui, i = X, Y, Z denotes displacement in the i
th direction. Displacement
magnitude is unitless, relative to the cell size, given in Figure 4.2 (middle). Unless
otherwise stated, uX will imply both u
X and u
X of the same magnitude.
The restrictions uY = 0 on cell faces are imposed to restrict rotational defor-
mation of the cells within the tissue and more closely represent simple/generalised
shear (and also restrain the solution space). For quantification of parameter in-
teractions, this solution gives tractable results.
Cell pressure and cohesion are applied by the following Neumann boundary
conditions:
 gn = p, normal traction on the contact interfaces and external tissues bound-
 gt = 0, tangential traction zero everywhere.
The magnitude of the constant p is measured in MPa. The direction of gn is
normal relative to the current state of the surface, such that if the angle of the
surfaces changes, so does the direction of force.
Traction free boundary conditions are used as an initial assumption (or ide-
alisation) to isolate the shear effect. Later, this assumption will be related and
traction will be imposed with cell cohesion for qualitative and quantitative results,
with the shear effect already understood.
4.2.6 Preliminary results
For the above geometry and boundary conditions, with shear displacements uX =
0.5 and p = 0 MPa, the simulation results are showed in Figure 4.4B. Here we
Page 67
4.3. IMPROVING THE MODELLING PROCEDURE
can see cells stack into columns (along the diagonal compressive principal axis)
and small gaps appear between these columns. These effects propagate from the
boundary effects where deformation is generally largest.
We measure the gap between the central cells to quantify debonding, as in
Figure 4.4C. The central node positions in the mesh are recorded after deformation,
and their relative distance in the X direction is recorded as the gap size.

4.3 Improving the modelling procedure
Implementing contact problems in FEBio using a single analysis step results in a
suboptimal calculation processes and is prone to divergence problems. We extend
and implement methods of increasing computational efficiency, robustness and
make the process scalable. The idea of scalability, in computing terms, is that
the architecture of the calculation process scales well with complexity/size. In the
single analysis step implementation, the computation time increases exponentially
with the number of cells in the system whereas we aim to use multiple analysis
steps to make it scale close to linear in order to handle large numbers of cells
competently. In this section we introduce the extended successive deformation
decomposition procedure method for contact problems.

4.3. IMPROVING THE MODELLING PROCEDURE
Successive Deformation Decomposition Procedure (SDDP)
If x = (X)  R3 describes the first deformation in analysis step (i), and x =
(X)  R3 describes the second deformation in analysis step (ii), written in terms
of the B0 configuration, then the deformation:
x = (x) = (
(x)) (4.3.1)
maps the deformed state B to the final configuration B.
Let F = d(X)/dX, F = d(X)/dX and F = d(X)/dX be the corre-
sponding deformation gradients, such that det(F) > 0 and det(F) > 0, i.e. the
mappings  and  are invertible and orientation preserving.
Then, by the chain rule, the following compatible multiplication decomposition
holds [103]:
F = FF (4.3.2)

Application of SDDP in modelling cellular bodies
To improve computational efficiency we employ the SDDP, separating the defor-
mation into successive analysis steps:
 Step (0): In the initial step, impose the boundary conditions uY and uZ on
the surfaces defined in Section 4.2.5, which are always imposed.
 Step (i): Consider the structure as one continuous, seamless set of cells.
This is achieved with tied contact conditions between every cell wall pair,
such that cells cannot debond and both compressive and tensile forces are
transmitted through the interface.
 (i)a: Incrementally apply the cell and external pressures gn upto a
prescribed magnitude p.
 (i)b: Use (i)a as the reference configuration, with gn = p, and incre-
mentally apply the displacements uX . This results in a deformed set of
cells, without the development of intercellular spaces.
 Step (ii): Finally, consider debonding at the cell interfaces by replacing the
tied contact conditions with sliding contact, which allows for non-penetrative,
cohesionless and frictionless contact. This takes the deformed structure from
step (i), with the applied Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, and
allows tensile forces to debond neighbouring cell walls. Cohesion is included
through application of cell pressures in step (i)a.
The algorithm in step (i) is simple to compute as no iteration sets are added to
the process to detect where the contact occurs (as it happens everywhere on the
potential contact surface) and therefore forces need to be calculated only once per
time step. The change of contact conditions in step (ii) requires a single iteration
to calculate the final equilibrium state given by the full contact equation (2.4.18).
As a single iteration, this step is performed quickly, as shown in the following
section.
Page 70
4.3. IMPROVING THE MODELLING PROCEDURE
An SDDP in a quasi-static deformation means that each step effectively hap-
pens simultaneously. The result calculated through SDDP should be the same
as one calculated with only sliding contacts, but with a smaller computational
cost. SDDP is known to be well determined in a continuous structure [103]. For
a discontinuous structure of contacting elastic bodies, the work of Signorini and
Fichera can be used to show that this is also well determined [52,149].
For our simulations of a 57 cellular tissue, without cellular inclusions and co-
hesion, we study the calculation procedures to quantify the power of the successive
deformation decomposition procedure.
Analysis of the standard procedure in FEBio
Using the Full-Newton solver, the calculation process is broken down into time
steps where the deformation is applied incrementally. The optimal number of
time steps was defined in our simulations of shear as 10, but to reach the final de-
formation 76 steps were used. This indicates that a number of diverging solutions
were encountered at the prescribed time steps and rolled back to an interpolated
time step.
At each of these time steps, there were an average of 78 equilibrium iterations.
At each equilibrium iteration there were exactly 32964 simultaneous equations
being solved in the stiffness matrix and the number of non-zero entries changed
between each iteration, ranging between 6.89 6.98 105.
The calculation process took 3677.18 seconds to execute (a little over one hour).
This time is somewhat to do with 73 cell-cell pairs and their contact interfaces
(between the 32 cells in the 5  7 tissue) which are evaluated at each time step.
The contact interfaces are iteratively calculated at each step to find the points
which are in contact and their reaction forces.
The process is parameter sensitive (interpenetration penalty, deformation size,
material stiffness), but likelihood of success of the calculations is not bounded by
Page 71
4.3. IMPROVING THE MODELLING PROCEDURE
a set of parameter limits, as small perturbations can fix or break the process. The
time at which failure occurs is later in the calculation process, which can be 40
minutes in.
Analysis of the SDDP in FEBio
Step (i) The first step deformed the tissue with tied contacts with optimal
number of iteration steps defined as 10, and to reach the final deformation exactly
10 steps were used. This indicates that the computation was relatively stable.
At each time step, there were an average of 6 equilibrium iterations. At each
equilibrium iteration there were exactly 32964 equations being solved in the stiff-
ness matrix and the number of non-zero entries was always 5.81 105.
Step (ii) The second step took the first step as its reference state and had a
change of boundary conditions. As there was no boundary condition to be succes-
sively applied, only one iteration step was needed to find a new equilibrium state.
The optimal number of iteration steps is therefore 1. Under normal circumstances
if there is a problem and the particular step cannot be calculated, a smaller it-
eration step would be used. However, in this case a smaller step has identical
boundary conditions so if it fails to be calculated the first time, then it will fail
every time. In some ways, this makes the calculation more sturdy as divergent
solutions are found earlier in the calculation process and can be restarted with
different uX or gn values.
In this one time step, there were 34 equilibrium iterations. At each equilibrium
iteration there were exactly 32964 equations being solved in the stiffness matrix
and the number of non-zero varied at each equilibrium iteration in the range
6.89 7.0 105.
The calculation process took 36.87 seconds to execute.

Visual inspection of the colour map of displacements in X, Figure 4.6, shows
a clear general agreement with seemingly identical cell position and colour dis-
tribution between the normal and SDDP simulations. To quantify the similarity,
Page 73
4.3. IMPROVING THE MODELLING PROCEDURE
a comparison is performed on nodal positions in the final state. The maximum
difference in X displacements is 1.8102, with average difference 3.6103. For
perspective, the maximum difference 1.8 102 is approximately 1/10 of the cell
wall thickness. The gap size is measured between the initially contacting central
nodes between the inner-most middle cells. The gap size differs by 7 103.
In terms of calculation time there is a huge difference, from one hour to less
than one minute for the SDDP. The distribution of time taken over deformation
size is not linear for the normal procedure as it starts fast and progressively gets
slower (and may level off). The SDDP reliably takes the same amount of time to
calculate.
Calculation reliability is poor for the standard procedure, it can run for a
long time and then fail, for example running for 45 minutes then failing at 72%
deformation. For the SDDP due to the second step calculating in a single iteration
it is clear after the first attempt at solving if it will succeed or fail which means
there is a faster turnaround for building models.
Clearly there are strong advantages for using the successive deformation de-
composition procedure.
Validation of cohesive cell-cell bonding
A tensile test has been performed to see how well cohesive pressure stops tis-
sue failure under tensile deformation. Failure is quantified by debonding between
neighbouring cells, where the distance between any initially contacting nodes ex-
ceeds 0.05.
The SDDP is used and the cell walls are made from Mooney-Rivlin material
with material constants C1 = 1 MPa, C2 = 0.1 MPa and cohesive pressure p = 0.1
Tensile deformation is applied by the following boundary conditions:
 u+Y = 0.5 displacement on the top tabs and u
Y = 0 on the bottom tabs;
Page 74
4.3. IMPROVING THE MODELLING PROCEDURE
 uX = 0 on top and bottom tabs;
 uZ = 0 displacement on all external faces.
Cell pressure and cohesion are applied by the following Neumann boundary con-
ditions:
 gn = p, normal traction on the contact interfaces and external tissue bound-
aries;
 gt = 0, tangential traction zero everywhere.
The direction of gn is normal relative to the current state of the surface, such that
if the angle of the surfaces changes, so does the direction of force.

Figure 4.7A shows tissue deformation for cells that have tied contacts and in
Figure 4.7B the cells are able to debond, where the high pressure within the cells
stop debonding from occurring. For a deformation of u+Y = 0.3, failure occurs for
p < 0.01 MPa and for u+Y = 0.5, failure occurs for p < 0.018 MPa. This supports
the results for pressure simulating the effects of cohesive contact interfaces and
further validates the usefulness of the SDDP.

The number of cells within the model tissue is explored here. In Figure 4.8 we

4.4. PARAMETER INVESTIGATION
In each model the cells are the same size and distribution, the difference being
that there are more cells - making the tissue larger. Here the magnitude of the
shear deformation is scaled to the size of the cell, not the tissue. Gap sizes are
shown in Figure 4.9 for the three tissue scales. Even with a small cell number in
the 3  3 model, the gap opening is close to that of the 4  5 and 5  7 models.
The main difference between the models is the size of the X deformation possible
for simulation before computational failure. The 3 3 model shows deformations
up to a magnitude of 0.5, the 4 5 upto 0.8 and the 5 7 upto 1.2.

4.4.2 Cell wall material models
We investigate the difference between the Mooney-Rivlin material and comparable
a linear elastic material by converting the material parameters (C1 = 1 MPa,
C2 = 0.1 MPa and  = 100 MPa) to the Youngs modulus E and Poissons Ratio
, using the following identities,

Comparing the Isotropic Elastic material model in FEBio the simulation, a
deformation of 0  uX  0.3 shows the gap size matching within a tolerance of
103. Matching results at small strain is exactly what is to be expected by the
definition of the finite and small strain regimes. For larger uX , the results start
to diverge.

4.4.3 Cohesion
We vary both shear magnitude uX and intercellular pressures p on a 5 7 tissue
to measure how these affect cell separation.
Figure 4.11 shows a plot of the gap size for 0  uX  1.1 and pressures
0  p  0.015 MPa. The data clearly shows that increasing pressure delays the
initiation of gaps. For zero pressure the rate of increase in gap size seems to follow

has been initiated.
Figure 4.12 shows the final deformation state (step (ii)) with 0.4  uX 
0.8 and 0  p  0.01 MPa. It is clear that gaps increase in size with greater
deformation (from left to right) and gaps decrease with increased cohesive pressure
(from top to bottom). The gap size seems to correlate with large deformation of
the corner cells.
4.4.4 Revisited: cell wall with cohesion
Again we investigate the difference between Mooney-Rivlin material and linear
isotropic material. Now we also include intercellular cohesion, shown in Figures
4.13 and 4.14.
The gap opening in the linear elastic case initiates at a higher deformation and
then grows at a similar rate. The difference in behaviour is similar to that of the
higher deformations in the previous linear/Mooney comparison (Figure 4.10).

4.4.5 Cell core
We now consider the soft elastic inserts embedded within the cell walls and study
the effect of its relative stiffness compared to the cell walls.
Figure 4.15 shows very similar deformation to that of the empty cells. The
volume restriction and elasticity of the inclusion has decreased gap size noticeably
at this deformation. Figure 4.16 shows a comparison of the gap sizes for inclusions
which have Mooney-Rivlin material parameters 10, 20, 40 and 1000 smaller
than the cell walls. The gap size of the cellular tissue with empty cell contents is
also shown. The first part of the deformation shows all gap sizes growing at the
same rate, but the rate of increase in gap size is delayed with the presence of an
inclusion. The closer the inclusion parameters are to the cell wall material, the
later the onset of this gap increase. After the gap increase begins, it happens at
a much faster rate than the empty case. The inclusion material 1000 smaller
shows that after this increase, the size of gap and the rate at which it expands
converge with the empty structure.

Elasticity of cellular inclusions are 10% softer than cell walls. The colour bar

Page 82
4.5. SUMMARY
The behaviour here is an interplay between volume restriction and inclusion
elasticity. As the elasticity constants decrease away from that of the cell wall
the behaviour will converge somewhere close to the 1000 case. Conversely, as
the material properties increase towards that of the cell wall then the cells will
become homogeneous granules. Thus empty cellular tissues and homogeneous
granules provide an upper and lower bound for debonding behaviour.

4.5 Summary
Numerically, when finite element models of periodic structures with hexagonal cells
are sheared, significant cell separation is captured diagonally across the structure.
To obtain the numerical results, we employ a successive deformation decomposition
technique, whereby: (i) first, a continuous deformation is assumed throughout the
structure; (ii) then, for the predeformed structure the unilateral contact between
cell walls are taken into account. The two-step procedure proves significantly
faster and more accurate than a one-step approach where the external boundary
conditions and contact constraints are imposed simultaneously.
Page 83
4.5. SUMMARY
Our analysis further indicates that, under large deformations, separation is less
likely between cells with high internal cell pressure than between cells where the
internal pressure is low. This is in agreement with the physical observations that
plant tissue under high turgor pressure (e.g. in fresh and growing fruit and veg-
etables) failed by cell wall rupture, whereas tissue under low turgor (e.g. in cooked
or ageing plants) failed by cell separation. The way cells separate or break and re-
lease their content is critical for horticultural qualities, such as fruit texture, which
is of major interest to producers around the world. As markets impose increas-
ingly stringent quality standards, there is a demand for development of models
that predict changes in fruit texture so that these processes can be managed and
controlled more effectively. Even though, in most cases, it is at a cellular level that
the structural basis of texture is best addressed, due to the inherent complexity
and diversity of cellular structures, the explicit representation of all individual
cells and their contact constraints in a structure with a very large number of
cells is not feasible computationally. Nonetheless, since local changes can generate
changes in the overall structural properties, the micro-structural model with non-
penetrative intercellular contact proposed here can be incorporated in a multiple
scale approach suitable for use in large-scale finite element computations.
Our simulations of non-penetrative contact within cellular bodies with hyper-
elastic cell walls, and the computational strategy which we employ is novel. This
work has been the subject of many talks, most notably presented at the 25th
Conference of the UK Association for Computational Mechanics, where the au-
thor received the Mike Crisfield Award, for best presenter of all PhD and post
doctoral researchers. The author also won sizeable sponsorship to communicate
these findings at an international conference on biological soft matter and agricul-
tural food challenges in Sao Paulo, Brazil - which also then lead to an invited talk
in the Food Sciences group at the University of Nottingham, to discuss possible
collaboration.

Multiscale analysis of cellular
structures
5.1 Introduction
Solid cellular structures are widespread in nature and in an ever increasing num-
ber of biomedical and engineering applications [22,42,55,65,66,103,114,145,161].
For example, engineered tissue scaffolds provide an environment for growth and
regeneration of biological cells [20, 39, 43, 45, 47, 129, 143, 164, 166, 171], while nat-
ural materials generally incorporate several levels of structural hierarchy, which
contribute to their macroscopic physical properties [51, 54, 134, 160, 173]. From
the modelling point of view, a sub-level in the structural hierarchy can be treated
either as a substructure with its own geometry, or as a continuum described by a
suitable material model.
When studying cellular structures, the common assumption is that cell walls
are linearly elastic with a geometrically non-linear behaviour. In this case, if
the cell walls bend, then the elastic response can be determined from the linear-
elastic deflection of a beam [65, 66]. However, in many cellular structures, when
loaded, the cell walls stretch axially rather than bend. The dominant mechanical
behaviour is determined by the architecture and depends on whether the cells are
5.1. INTRODUCTION
open or closed [30,160]. Stretch-dominated cellular structures, such as octet-truss
and body-centred cubic geometries, for example (see Figure 5.1), have a higher
stiffness-to-weight ratio than bending-dominated ones [23, 30, 31, 44, 54, 66, 101,
159,160]. In addition, biological and bio-inspired materials are often non-linearly
elastic under large strains, and a finite elasticity approach is needed to understand
them [67,73,127,157].
Figure 5.1: Examples of stretch-dominated architectures: (A) octet-truss and (B)
body-centred cubic, at the cell level (left) and at the mesoscopic structural level
(right), respectively.
Microstructure-based models for a cellular solid with open cells of isotropic
linearly-elastic material were first proposed by Gent & Thomas (1959) [61], where
infinitesimal stretches were assumed. In [62], these models were extended to struc-
tures with closed cells containing an ideal gas. For these models, effective Youngs
modulus and Poissons ratio under infinitesimal deformations were derived explic-

5.1. INTRODUCTION
itly from the constitutive equations [11,13]. For cellular structures of non-linearly
elastic material under finite strain deformations, a phenomenological continuum
model was proposed by Blatz & Ko (1962) [15]. This model reduces to the Gent-
Thomas model in the small strain limit [10, 12]. Later, it was noted in [153]
that Hills energy functional of hyperelasticity [72] can be used to describe the
simple special case of structures where the principal stresses are uncoupled, i.e.
depend only on the stretch ratio in the corresponding principal direction. These
approaches are based on Ogden-type strain-energy functions for compressible ma-
terials extending the incompressible strain-energy functions defined in [126].
For stretch-dominated structures with open or closed cells made from non-
linear elastic materials, in [118,119], novel continuum isotropic hyperelastic mod-
els, at a mesoscopic level, where the number of cells was finite and the size of the
structure was comparable to the size of the cells, were constructed analytically
from the structural architecture and the material properties at the cell level. For
these structures, the cell walls, which were equal in size and arbitrarily oriented,
were under finite triaxial deformations, while the joints between adjacent walls
were not elastically deformed. The elastic responses at different scales were re-
lated by the assumption that, when the structure is subject to a triaxial stretch,
each cell wall deforms also by a triaxial stretch, without bending or buckling, and
the stretches of the structure and of the cell walls were related by a rotation.
Possible instability effects due to cell wall buckling, for example, which could also
occur under large deformations, were discussed in [118].
In this chapter, we bring new insight into the constitutive behaviour of the
stretch-dominated, open- and closed-cell models introduced in [118, 119], by pro-
viding a systematic derivation of their non-linear elastic parameters in the the-
oretical framework of [113]. As the focus of this study is the formal derivation
of non-linear elastic parameters, for which finite homogeneous deformations are
required, possible damage or instability effects are not discussed here. We start
Page 87
5.2. HYPERELASTIC MODELS FOR STRETCH-DOMINATED
ARCHITECTURES
with a summary of the hyperelastic models and specialise these models to the case
with neo-Hookean cell components (Section 5.2), which we then analyse explicitly
as follows. For each model, first, the non-linear shear modulus is calculated under
the multiaxial deformation consisting of simple shear superposed on finite uniaxial
stretch (Section 5.3.1). Then, the non-linear Poissons ratio is computed under
uniaxial stretch, and the corresponding non-linear stretch modulus is obtained
from a universal relation involving the shear modulus as well (Section 5.3.2). A
universal relation is valid for a class of strain energy density functions, in this case,
isotropic hyperelastic materials. The role of the non-linear shear and stretch mod-
uli is to reflect stiffening or softening in a material under increasing loads. Volume
changes are quantified by the non-linear bulk modulus under hydrostatic pressure
(Section 5.3.3). To illustrate the theoretical results, we present and discuss the
non-linear elastic parameters of open- or closed-cell models where the material
and geometric parameters at the cell level are specified (Sections 5.3.4).
The strength of this model is highlighted is Section 5.4 by being applied back-
wards to experimental data to predict cell wall behaviour, using an incompressible
Fung type model to capture cell wall stiffening. Finally, in Section 5.5.1 the model
based on neo-Hookean cell walls is implemented as a new material model in FEBio.
5.2 Hyperelastic models for stretch-dominated
architectures
In this section, first we summarise the general formulation of the continuum hy-
perelastic models for stretch-dominated architectures with open or closed cells
proposed in [118, 119]. We then specialise these models to the particular case of
structures with neo-Hookean cell components, which we analyse in detail in the
next sections.

ARCHITECTURES
5.2.1 Geometric assumptions
The geometric assumptions are as follows: all cell walls are equal, with undeformed
thickness t and length L; the walls are thin, with the thickness-to-length ratio
0 < k = t/L < 1; and cell walls meet at joints with thickness t.
The representative volume fraction, w, signifies the fraction of cell wall ma-
terial in the structure, excluding the volume of the joint. This can be calculated
explicitly if the geometry is known. Here, we make further assumptions which let
us express a general w only as a function of k.
Open-cell structures. For the open-cell structure [118], we consider the case
where all cell walls meet at spherical joints (Figure 5.2A). It is assumed that
the entire surface of the joint is covered by cell walls (such that no red cell joint
is visible in Figure 5.2), then the volume of cell walls surrounding a joint is a
function of the joints surface area 4(t/2)2 = 4(kL/2)2. Half of each cell wall
L/2 is assumed to belong to each joint, giving
Vwall =
k2L3
(5.2.1)
Taking the unit volume as the volume of the sphere with radius R = (L+t)/2 =
L(1 + k)/2, which is centred at a joint and contains half of the length of each cell
wall connected to that joint (see Figure 5.2B),
Vunit =
L3(1 + k)3
(5.2.2)
Thus, the representative volume fraction of solid material contained in the cell
walls, included in this sphere, is
(o)w =
Vwall
Vunit
(1 + k)3
. (5.2.3)

Closed-cell structures. For the closed-cell structures [119], all cell walls have
flat faces and adjacent cell walls meet along cell edges of length L, while adjacent
cell edges meet at spherical joints. In this case, setting the unit volume as the
volume of a sphere with radius R = (L + t)/2 = L(1 + k)/2, centred at a joint,
the representative volume fraction of solid material contained the cell walls (faces
and edges) included in this sphere, is equal to
(c)w =
(1 + k)2
, (5.2.4)
while the remaining volume fraction, taken by the cell core, is
(c)c =
(1 + k)3
. (5.2.5)
See [119] for detailed derivation.
5.2.2 Kinematic assumptions
Stretch-dominated open-cell structures. When the structure is deformed
homogeneously with the principal stretches {i}i=1,2,3, each cell wall deforms by a
triaxial stretch with the principal stretches {i}i=1,2,3. Let (e1, e2, e3) be the usual
orthonormal vectors for the Cartesian coordinates in the principal directions in
which the structure deforms, and (n1,n2,n3) denote the orthonormal vectors in
the principal direction of a deforming cell wall, satisfying:
n1 = e1 cos  cos e2 cos  sin+ e3 sin ,
n2 =e1 sin e2 cos,
n3 =e1 sin  cos+ e2 sin  sin+ e3 cos .

- For the cell wall, the deformation gradient is the stretch tensor F = diag(1, 2, 3)
and the Cauchy-Green tensor is equal to C = diag(21, 
3). We denote the prin-
cipal invariants of the stretch tensor, F, by
1 = 1 + 2 + 3,
2 = 12 + 23 + 31,
3 = 123,
(5.2.7)

I1 = 
1  22,
I2 = 
2  213,
I3 = 
(5.2.9)
- Assuming that the cell joints do not deform, if L and l are the lengths of a cell
wall before and after the deformation, respectively, and t is the width of a joint
between adjacent walls, we denote by L = L+ t = (1 + k)L and l = l+ t = l+ kL
the corresponding lengths of a cell element comprising a cell wall and a joint (or
a cell wall and half of each joint situated at the ends of the wall) before and after
the deformation (Figure 5.4). Then the principal stretches for a cell element are
i + k
1 + k
, i = 1, 2, 3. (5.2.10)
Due to the structure undergoing homogeneous deformation, the cell element is
assumed to deform in the same manner as the structure, relating the principal
stretches of the cell element {i}i=1,2,3 to the principal stretches of the structure
{i}i=1,2,3 by
1 cos

the following relations hold between the stretch invariants (5.2.7) and (5.2.12), of
the cell wall and of the cell element, respectively,
1 = (1 + k)i1  3k,
2 = (1 + k)
2i2  2k(1 + k)i1 + 3k2,
3 = (1 + k)
3i3  k(1 + k)2i2 + k2(1 + k)i1  k3.

(1 + k)3i3  k(1 + k)2i2 + k2(1 + k)i1  k3
(5.2.14)
- For the structure, the principal invariants of the stretch tensor are
i1 = 1 + 2 + 3,
i2 = 12 + 23 + 31,
i3 = 123.
(5.2.15)
Stretch-dominated closed-cell structures. For the closed-cell structures, the
kinematic assumptions on the cell walls and the cell joints are the same as for the
open-cell case. In addition, when the cells are filled with an isotropic hyperelastic
core, it is assumed that the cell core deforms homogeneously with the cell walls
and remains in full active contact with the adjacent cell walls throughout the
deformation, i.e., no internal gaps occur.
Remark 5.2.1 We note that, in order for the kinematic assumptions to be satis-
fied, and in particular, that the deformation of the cell walls can be approximated
by a triaxial stretch, while the elastic deformation of the joints may be neglected, it
is reasonable to assume that the thickness of the walls, t, is much smaller than the
Page 94
5.2. HYPERELASTIC MODELS FOR STRETCH-DOMINATED
ARCHITECTURES
length of the walls, L, and hence k = t/L is sufficiently small, i.e. 0 < k  1. In
practice, the upper limit for k, such that the kinematic assumptions are reasonably
satisfied, will depend on both the cell wall material and cell geometry. In particular,
under the geometric and kinematic assumptions described above, in [118], numer-
ical examples show that the mesoscopic models capture the behaviour of cellular
structures with a fixed number of cells and increasing wall thickness more accu-
rately for the structures with thinner walls, where the deformation of the walls is
closer to the triaxial stretch and the joints deform less significantly, as assumed
theoretically, than for those with thicker walls, where the theoretical assumptions
fail to be satisfied. In the numerical examples presented in Section 5.3.4, we com-
pare numerically the non-linear material properties of the mesoscopic models, by
taking k  {0.1, 0.2, 0.3} and the cell wall material parameters fixed, or varying
the cell core material parameters while the cell wall material is fixed, with k = 0.1.
5.2.3 Constitutive models
First, we recall that, for a homogeneous isotropic hyperelastic material, the fol-
lowing principles hold:
- Material objectivity (frame indifference), which states that the constitutive
equation must be invariant under changes of frame of reference, i.e. the scalar
strain-energy function, W = W(F), depending only on the deformation gradient
F, with respect to the reference configuration, is unaffected by a superimposed
rigid-body transformation (which involves a change of position) after deformation,
i.e. W(RTF) =W(F), where R  SO(3) is a proper orthogonal tensor (rotation).
- Material isotropy, which requires that the strain-energy function is unaffected
by a superimposed rigid-body transformation prior to deformation, i.e. W(FQ) =
W(F), where Q  SO(3).
Page 95
5.2. HYPERELASTIC MODELS FOR STRETCH-DOMINATED
ARCHITECTURES
Assuming that the cell walls are made from a homogeneous isotropic hyper-
elastic material, it follows from the kinematic assumptions in Section 5.2.2 that
the following strain-energy functions can be equivalently expressed:
 By (5.2.9) the strain-energy of the wallWw can be expressed in terms of the
principal invariants of C or F of the cell wall deformation
Ww(I1, I2, I3) =Ww(1, 2, 3). (5.2.16)
 By (5.2.13), the strain-energy of the wall can be related to the strain-energy
of the cell element Ww
Ww(1, 2, 3) =Ww(i1, i2, i3) (5.2.17)
 By (5.2.11), (5.2.12),(5.2.15) and the principals of material objectivity and
isotropy, the strain-energy of the element can be equivalently written in
terms of the the structures principal invariants
Ww(i1, i2, i3) =Ww(i1, i2, i3). (5.2.18)
Open-cell model. For the open-cell model, the strain-energy function per unit
volume is defined by taking the mean value of the cell wall energy over the unit
sphere [118],
W(o)(i1, i2, i3) = (o)w
 /2
 /2
Ww(i1, i2, i3) sin dd
= (o)w Ww(i1, i2, i3).
(5.2.19)
Page 96
5.2. HYPERELASTIC MODELS FOR STRETCH-DOMINATED
ARCHITECTURES
Then, the principal components of the corresponding Cauchy stress tensor are
i = J
W(o)
= J1o
W(o)
 (lni)
, i = 1, 2, 3,
(5.2.20)
where {i}i=1,2,3 the principal stretches of the structure and Jo = i3 = 123.
A consequence of this formulation is that if a cell wall is incompressible, so will
the structure. This relationship would not be true in a bending-dominated struc-
ture, where the cell wall bending allows for a high level of compressibility. However
this assumption fits for stretch-dominated structures, especially in tension where
relatively little buckling should occur, as discussed in [118].
Closed-cell model. For the closed-cell model, the strain-energy function is
equal to [119]
W(c)(i1, i2, i3) = (c)w Ww(i1, i2, i3) + 
c Wc(i1, i2, i3), (5.2.21)
where Ww(i1, i2, i3) and Wc(i1, i2, i3) are the strain-energy functions for the cell
walls and the cell core, respectively. When the cells are empty, the hyperelastic
model defined by (5.2.21) simplifies to
W(e)(i1, i2, i3) = (c)w Ww(i1, i2, i3). (5.2.22)
For the general closed-cell model given by (5.2.21), the principal components of
the associated Cauchy stress tensor are
i = J
W(c)
= J1c
W(c)
 (lni)
, i = 1, 2, 3,

where Jc = i3 = 123.

5.2.4 The particular case with neo-Hookean cell compo-
nents
To investigate formally the non-linear elastic behaviour of the constitutive models
(5.2.19) and (5.2.21), we specialise to the case where the cell wall material is
described by the compressible neo-Hookean model
Ww(I1, I2, I3) =
(I1  3 ln I3) +
, (5.2.24)
with w > 0 and w > 0 constants.
Open cells with neo-Hookean cell walls. The strain-energy function for the
open-cell model (5.2.19) with the cell wall material described by (5.2.24) is equal
to [118]

(5.2.26)
Closed cells with neo-Hookean components. For the closed-cell structures,
if the cells are filled, we further assume that the cell core is characterised by the

Wc(I1, I2, I3) =
(I1  3 ln I3) +

with c > 0, c > 0 constants. Then, the strain-energy function for the closed-cell
model (5.2.21) takes on the form [119]

5.3 Non-linear elastic moduli
5.3.1 Shear modulus
In this section, for the hyperelastic models (5.2.25) and (5.2.28), we determine
explicit non-linear shear moduli, as discussed in [113]. Consider the following
multiaxial homogeneous deformation [49, 147], consisting of simple shear super-
Page 99
5.3. NON-LINEAR ELASTIC MODULI
posed on finite uniaxial stretch (Figure 5.5) [35,113,132],
x1 = (a)X1 + aX3,
x2 = (a)X2,
x3 = aX3,
(5.3.1)
where (X1, X2, X3) and (x1, x2, x3) are the Cartesian coordinates for the La-
grangian (reference) and the Eulerian (current) configuration, respectively, and
a and  are positive constants.
Figure 5.5: Cube (left) deformed by uniaxial stretch (middle) followed by simple
shear (right).
For this deformation, the principal stretches {i}i=1,2,3 satisfy
21 =
(a)2 + a2 (1 + 2) +
[(a)2 + a2 (1 + 2)]
2  4a2(a)2
22 =
(a)2 + a2 (1 + 2)
[(a)2 + a2 (1 + 2)]
2  4a2(a)2
23 = (a)
(5.3.2)
Then, J = 123 = a(a)
The non-linear shear modulus is defined as [113],
(a, ) =
1  2
21  22
, (5.3.3)
Page 100
5.3. NON-LINEAR ELASTIC MODULI
where {i}i=1,2,3 are the principal components of the Cauchy stress tensor associ-
ated with the deformation (5.3.1).
Remark 5.3.1 Note that the non-linear shear modulus (5.3.3) is positive if the
Baker-Ericksen (BE) inequalities hold. These inequalities state that the greater
principal stress occurs in the direction of the greater principal stretch and take on
the form
(i  j) (i  j) > 0 if i 6= j, i, j = 1, 2, 3, (5.3.4)
with  replacing the strict inequality > if any two principal stretches are
equal [8, 93].
For the neo-Hookean models (5.2.24) and (5.2.27), the non-linear shear mod-
ulus (5.3.3) is constant and equal to w and c, respectively.
When a  1, i.e., for simple shear superposed on infinitesimal axial stretch,
the non-linear shear modulus given by (5.3.3) converges to the non-linear shear
modulus for simple shear,
() = lim
(a, ), (5.3.5)
and the principal stretches satisfy
21 = 1 +
2 + 
2 + 4
= 2,
22 = 1 +
2  
2 + 4
= 2,
23 = 1.
Similarly, when   0, i.e., for infinitesimal shear superposed on finite axial
stretch, the non-linear shear modulus, given by (5.3.3), converges to
(a) = lim
(a, ). (5.3.6)
If a  1 and   0, then these shear moduli converge to the linear shear

(a).
(5.3.7)
Open-cell model. For the open-cell model (5.2.25), the non-linear shear mod-
ulus (5.3.3) is
(o)(a, ) =

123 (1 + 2)
(1 + 2) (1 + k) k +
[1(1 + k) k] [2(1 + k) k]

ln[1(1 + k) k] + ln[2(1 + k) k] + ln[3(1 + k) k]
[1(1 + k) k] [2(1 + k) k]
(5.3.8)
When a 1, the non-linear shear modulus given by (5.3.5) is equal to
(o)() = lim
(o)(a, ), (5.3.9)
and if   0, then the non-linear shear modulus defined by (5.3.6) is

In the linear elastic limit [118], a  1 and   0, by (5.2.3), these shear moduli
converge to

Closed-cell model. Similarly, for the closed-cell model (5.2.28), the non-linear
shear modulus (5.3.3) is equal to
(c)(a, ) =
w (1 + k)
123 (1 + 2)
(1 + 2) (1 + k) k +
[1(1 + k) k] [2(1 + k) k]

When a 1, the non-linear shear modulus (5.3.5) is
(c)() = lim
(c)(a, ), (5.3.13)
and if   0, then the non-linear shear modulus (5.3.6) is
(c)(a) = lim
(c)(a, ). (5.3.14)
In the linear elastic limit [119], a  1 and   0, by (5.2.4) and (5.2.5), these

When the closed cells are empty, we obtain the corresponding non-linear shear
moduli, (e), (e), (e) , and their linear elastic limit, (e), by setting 
c = 0 in

5.3.2 Stretch modulus and Poisson function
Next, we focus on the simple extension (or contraction) diag(1, 2, 3), with
3 = a > 1 (a < 1 for contraction) and 1 = 2 = (a) (as in Figure 5.5 middle),
for which the associated Cauchy stress tensor is equal to  = diag (0, 0, N), with
N > 0 for uniaxial tension (N < 0 for uniaxial compression).
Remark 5.3.2 We recall that, for a hyperelastic body subject to uniaxial tension
(or compression), the deformation is a simple extension (contraction) in the di-
rection of the tensile (compressive) force if and only if the BE inequalities (5.3.4)
hold [8, 93]. If the BE inequalities are valid for the cell wall material, then these
inequalities are valid also for the open- and closed-cell models (see details in [119]).
The non-linear Poissons ratio, defined in terms of the logarithmic (or Hencky,
or true) strain, is equal to the following Poisson function [10,113]
(a) = 
ln(a)
. (5.3.16)
Then, the non-linear stretch modulus satisfies the following universal relation
(valid for all isotropic hyperelastic materials) [113],
E(a) = (a)
a2  a2(a)
(1 + (a)) ln a
(1 + (a) + a (a) ln a) , (5.3.17)
where (a) and (a) are given by (5.3.6) and (5.3.16), respectively, and  (a) =
d(a)/da is the derivative of (a) with respect to a.
We note that, for the neo-Hookean models (5.2.24) and (5.2.27), the non-linear
Poissons ratio given by (5.3.16) is not constant (see Section 5.3.2 for a proof). We
denote by w(a) and Ew(a) the non-linear Poisson function and stretch modulus
for the cell wall, respectively, and similarly, by c(a) and Ec(a) the non-linear
Poisson function and stretch modulus for the cell core, respectively. Then, the
Page 104
5.3. NON-LINEAR ELASTIC MODULI
respective linear elastic limits are as follows:
w = lim
w(a)
2 (w + w)
Ew = lim
Ew(a)
= 2w(1 + w),
(5.3.18)
c = lim
c(a)
2 (c + c)
Ec = lim
Ec(a)
= 2c(1 + c).
(5.3.19)
Open-cell model. For the open-cell model (5.2.25) under the deformation
diag(1, 2, 3), such that 3 = a and 1 = 2 = (a) in the Cartesian directions
(e1, e2, e3), we assume that some of the cell walls are aligned with these Cartesian
directions. Then, their deformation is diag(1, 2, 3), where 3 = a(1 + k)  k,
1 = 2 = (a) = 
w(3)
3 = [a(1+k)k]w(a(1+k)k), and (a) = ((a)+k)/(1+
k). In this case, the non-linear Poissons ratio, defined by (5.3.16), is equal to
(o)(a) = 
[a(1 + k) k]w(a(1+k)k) + k
 ln(1 + k)
. (5.3.20)
In the linear elastic limit [118], the Poisson function given by (5.3.20) converges
(o) = lim
(o)(a)
= w.
(5.3.21)
Page 105
5.3. NON-LINEAR ELASTIC MODULI
The corresponding non-linear stretch modulus satisfies the following relation sim-
ilar to (5.3.17),
E(o)(a) = (o)(a)
a2  a2(o)(a)
(1 + (o)(a)) ln a
1 + (o)(a) + a((o))(a) ln a
, (5.3.22)
with (o)(a) given by (5.3.10). In the linear elastic limit [118], the non-linear
stretch modulus defined by (5.3.22) converges to
= lim
E(o)(a)
= Ew
w (1 + k)
1 + k
(5.3.23)
Closed-cell model. Similarly, for the closed-cell model (5.2.28), if the cells are
empty or the Poissons ratios for the cell walls and the cell core are equal, i.e.,
w = c, then the Poisson function and stretch modulus are, respectively,
(c)(a) = 
[a(1 + k) k]w(a(1+k)k) + k
 ln(1 + k)
(5.3.24)
E(c)(a) = (c)(a)
a2  a2(c)(a)
(1 + (c)(a)) ln a
1 + (c)(a) + a((c))(a) ln a
, (5.3.25)
with (c)(a) given by (5.3.14). In the linear elastic limit [119],
(c) = lim
(c)(a)
(5.3.26)

Non-linear Poisson function for neo-Hookean material
Here we prove that the non-linear Poissons ratio defined by (5.3.16) is not constant
for an elastic body characterised by the generalised neo-Hookean model
W(1, 2, 3) =
21 + 
2 + 
3  3 ln(
[ln(123)]
, (5.3.28)
where  > 0 and  > 0 are constants.
Proof: Under simple tension or compression, diag(1, 2, 3), with 3 = a >
0 and 1 = 2 = (a), the associated Cauchy stress tensor is equal to  =
diag (0, 0, N), where N 6= 0 and the diagonal components satisfy
i = J
, i = 1, 2, 3, (5.3.29)
with J = 123. For the constitutive model (5.3.28), under the given deforma-
tion, (5.3.29) reduces to
213
(21  1) +  ln
213
213
(23  1) +  ln
213
(5.3.30)
Page 107
5.3. NON-LINEAR ELASTIC MODULI
Equivalently, by subtracting the first from the second equation in (5.3.30), we
obtain
(21  1) +  ln
213
(23  21)
213
(5.3.31)
Next, using the definition of the Poisson function given by (5.3.16), if 3 = a, then
1 = 
(a)
3 , and (5.3.31) takes on the form
(a2(a)  1) +  (1 2(a)) ln a = 0,
(a2  a2(a))
a12(a)
(5.3.32)
Assuming constant Poisson function, (a) =  = /(2(+)), then  = 2/(1
2) and (5.3.32) reduces to
a2 + 2 ln a = 1,
(a2  a2)
a12
(5.3.33)
Next, noting that the first equation in (5.3.33) has the unique solution a = 1, we
conclude that only under infinitesimal strain the Poisson function can be constant,
but not under finite strain in general.
5.3.3 Bulk modulus
Volume changes in the isotropic hyperelastic models (5.2.25) and (5.2.28) can
be quantified by the following non-linear bulk modulus [113], defined under the
equitriaxial stretch diag(1, 2, 3), with 1 = 2 = 3 = a > 0 (Figure 5.6),
 (1 + 2 + 3)
(J  1)
, (5.3.34)
where {i}i=1,2,3 are the principal Cauchy stresses and J = 123 = a3.

5.3. NON-LINEAR ELASTIC MODULI
Figure 5.6: Cube deformed by hydrostatic compression.
Remark 5.3.3 For a compressible isotropic material, the fact that the volume of
the material is decreased by hydrostatic compression and increased by hydrostatic
tension is expressed by the the pressure-compression (PC) inequalities stating that
each principal stress is a tension or a compression if the corresponding principal
stretch is an extension or a contraction, i.e., i (i  1) > 0, i = 1, 2, 3 [157,
p. 155]. Physically, either or both of the following mean versions of the PC con-
ditions are more realistic,
1 (1  1) + 2 (2  1) + 3 (3  1) > 0, (5.3.35)
> 0, (5.3.36)
if not all principal stretches are equal to 1. By [119], if the PC inequalities hold for
the cell wall material, then these inequalities hold also for the open- and closed-cell
models.
Page 109
5.3. NON-LINEAR ELASTIC MODULI
As J quantifies the relative change of volume from the reference to the current
configuration, assuming that J is close to 1 (i.e., for small or incremental volume
changes), and setting 1 = 2 = 3 = , the non-linear bulk modulus (5.3.34)
simplifies as follows,
 = lim
J  1
. (5.3.37)
For the neo-Hookean models (5.2.24) and (5.2.27), the respective bulk moduli
given by (5.3.37) are constant and equal to
2w + 3w
2c + 3c
(5.3.38)
Open-cell model. For the open-cell model (5.2.25), expressing the principal
components of the Cauchy stress tensor as

Note that (o) and (o) scale by the same factor, such that
. (5.3.41)
This result is to be expected in the linear elastic limit since (o) = w.
Closed-cell model. Similarly, for the closed-cell model (5.2.28), the non-linear
bulk modulus defined by (5.3.37) is equal to
(c) = lim
w (1 + k)
c (Jc  1)
J1/3c (1 + k) k

Hence, for the open- and the closed-cell models with neo-Hookean cell walls, the
non-linear bulk moduli given by (5.3.40) and (5.3.42), respectively, are constant.
5.3.4 Examples

both evaluated under varying compression or tension, with 0.75 < a < 1.25.

(c)(), given by (5.3.13), evaluated under varying simple shear, with 0 <  < 0.5,
superposed on infinitesimal stretch, and (B) the non-linear shear modulus (c)(a),
given by (5.3.14), evaluated under infinitesimal shear superposed on varying com-
pression or tension, with 0.75 < a < 1.25.

by (5.3.24), both evaluated under varying compression or tension, with 0.75 <

Discussion of examples
Our illustrative examples show that, for the open-cell model:
- Under simple shear superposed on infinitesimal stretch, the non-linear shear
modulus increases slightly or remains almost constant as the shear parameter,
satisfying 0 <  < 0.5, increases (Figure 5.7A).
- Under infinitesimal shear superposed on finite axial stretch, the non-linear
shear modulus decreases or remains almost constant as the stretch ratio, satisfying
0.75 < a < 1.25, increases (Figure 5.7B).
- Under increasing finite axial stretch, the non-linear stretch modulus increases,
while the Poisson function decreases (Figure 5.8).
- As the thickness-to-length ratio of the cell wall, k, increases, the non-linear
shear and stretch parameters increase, while the non-linear Poissons ratio de-
creases in tension and increases in compression (Figures 5.7 and 5.8).
Analogous properties were found for the closed-cell model with empty cells
(results not shown). In addition, when the closed cells are filled with an elastic
core that has the same Poissons ratio as the cell walls:
- The non-linear shear and stretch moduli increase as the shear modulus of the
cell core, c, increases (Figures 5.9 and 5.10A).
- When the Poissons ratios for the cell wall and for the different cell core
materials are equal, the non-linear Poissons ratio for the closed-cell model does
not change with the cell core (Figure 5.10B).
Note the bulk modulus is only defined in the linear elastic limit and is constant,
whereas the other elastic moduli are functions of deformation. Hence, no plots of
the bulk modulus are given.

5.4. BACKWARDS MULTISCALE METHOD
5.4 Backwards multiscale method
There are many experimental difficulties in recording accurate cell wall stiffness
for biological cellular materials. These difficulties arise from: (i) the size of the
cell walls and the testing equipment required for measuring non-linear behaviour
accurately; (ii) changes in properties between in vivo and in vitro - an extracted
cell wall will have a different stiffness if it is within a tissue, as environmental
conditions (such as hydration) will change. The power of using the multiscale
framework [119] as a backwards multiscale method is that it is able to extract
information from macroscopic tests and predict cell wall properties that may be
otherwise impossible to find.
In this section, we will apply the multiscale framework in reverse to exper-
imental data for the Jonagord apple, Figure 5.11 [125], to derive the cell wall
properties. The advantage of this data is that three sets of measurements were
taken, for varying cell core pressures (manipulated by absorption of mannitol so-
lution, with different osmotic potentials). This means that we can distinguish the
cell core effect and find the common cell wall data between the data sets. No
experimental data could be found to give a complete validation of the derived
cell wall material, so we highlight that this cell wall derivation is for illustrative
purposes only.
The experimental test [125] was performed on a rectangular specimen (11 
5  2mm) bonded by an adhesive at the ends to a tensile test rig. Three cycles
of uniaxial tensile loading and unloading, to zero stress, were performed, then
elongation until tissue failure. Tensile loading happened at a rate of 6.6ms1.
Results are shown in Figure 5.11 1.

5.4.1 Model derivation
The isotropic incompressible Fung strain energy density function [57] has the ca-
pacity to capture the strain stiffening effects caused by the fibres within the cell
walls, so we will use it for our cell wall material. This is then incorporated in the
mesoscopic model, which we then calibrate against the experimental data. The
cell wall strain energy density function is
eb(I13)  1
, (5.4.1)
where w is the infinitesimal shear modulus of the cell wall, b is the stiffening
factor, and I1 is the first strain invariant of the deformation.
We assume that the cell core can be represented with a simple incompressible
neo-Hookean model
I1  3
, (5.4.2)
where c is the infinitesimal shear modulus of the cell core.
Page 117
5.4. BACKWARDS MULTISCALE METHOD
The mesoscopic strain energy density function for the closed cell model is then
W(c) =
eb[(1+k)
2(i212i2)2k(1+k)i13(1k
2)]  1
i21  2i2  3
(5.4.3)
where 
w and 
c are the volume fractions of cell wall and cell core material in a
representative unit volume (note that 
w does not include the volume of nodes),
respectively, k is the wall width-to-length ratio, and i1 and i2 are the first and
second deformation invariants.
In terms of principal stretches, i, for the mesoscopic structure, this takes the
W(c) =
eb[(1+k)

3)2k(1+k)(1+2+3)3(1k

(5.4.4)
The corresponding principal stresses are

(5.4.5)
As we assume the cell walls, core and joints are all incompressible, the mesoscopic
bulk material is also incompressible and therefore 123 = 1. The mesoscopic
material is also isotropic and subject to uniaxial stretch, then 1 =  and 2 =
. A common assumption is that the out of plane stresses are zero, i.e.
3 = w
(1 + k)2
 k(1 + k)
b[(1+k)2(2+ 2

We can calibrate (5.4.8) to the experimental data, and find values for cell wall
material parameters (w and b) for each of the three cases provided. For each
dataset, the values for the cell core stiffness c can vary.
5.4.2 Experimental parameters
Average cell area over 2D cross sections have been recorded for high, normal and
low pressure. This allows for an approximation of the cell radius and volume.
Cell thickness was not recorded in this experiment, but [96] uses transmission
electron microscopy and MatLab analysis to calculate the cell wall thickness of
the Jonagord apple, thus a recording of 1.67 + 0.71m is used here. In order
to approximate the cell wall thickness to length ratio k and the volume fractions
w and 
c , an idealised geometric assumption is made. An optimal, ordered, cell
packing in three dimensions, with full cell-cell contact (no gaps) is a tetrakaidec-
ahedral packing [65]. The resulting geometric parameters are summarised in the
table below.

5.4.3 Model calibration
A built-in procedure is used in MatLab to calibrate the mesoscopic material model
against the experimental data. The absolute residual norm is minimised, where
the norm is given as
||r||22 =
[1() exp]2, (5.4.9)
where exp is the experimentally recorded stress in the first direction, extracted
from Figure 5.11 using grabit in MatLab.
The residual norms for each dataset (relating to the low, medium and high
core stiffness) is combined in the minimisation process with equal weighting, such

Examining the data of Figure 5.11, sudden changes in the slope indicate some
sort of damage or failure, so these data points should be excluded. Further, there

are cyclic tests included in these data sets which are also excluded. There are two
logical approaches to analysing the given data sets, which are both explored:
(i) Consider only data points up to the onset of damage,
(ii) Consider only data points up to a prescribed stretch.
Approach (i)
Here the data is resampled, so there are 100 data points in each data set, shown in
Figure 5.12. Excluded data points are shown in black. The fminsearch MatLab
function is used as the data sets do not have the same  range. An objective
function produces an error, dictated by (5.4.9), with equal weighting for each data
set. Penalties are included to enforce positive parameters.

residual norm ||r||22 = 0.039. The fit works well for both low and high pressures,
where either the Fung or neo-Hookean models dominate. However, for the normal
pressure the fit is not so good.
Approach (ii)
The data is resampled, such that there are 100 data points in the data range 1 
  1.08 and 8% deformation is the maximum deformation considered, as shown
in Figure 5.13. Excluded data points are shown in black. The more appropriate
lsqcurvefit MatLab function is used as the data sets share the same  range and
a single, combined objective function can be used, with equal weighting for each
data set. Lower limits are used to enforce positive parameters.

where black points are excluded in the fit.
The optimised parameters are w = 1.3760, b = 36.6717 and for the cell cores
(low pres) c = 0.006, (med pres) c = 0.1976 and (high pres) c = 1.0590, with
residual norm ||r||22 = 0.0031. Within the data range, there is strong agreement

5.5. NEW MATERIAL MODELS IN FEBIO
between the fit and experimental results, given by a norm which is of one order
of magnitude smaller than case (i). Outside of this range, stiffness increases more
sharply than the experimental data due to a higher stiffening factor.
5.4.4 Cell wall approximation
With the Fung cell wall material model approximation and the fitted parameters
from the mesoscopic material model, we now have functions and parameter val-
ues for both the cell wall and the continuum material, which could be used and
validated in further study. The Fung models for case (i) and (ii) are given by
eb(I13)  1
, (5.4.10)
with w = 1.9767, b = 16.057 for case (i) and w = 1.3760, b = 36.6717 for case
(ii). Assuming no out of plane stress, Figure 5.14 shows a stress plot of these
functions, given by
w = w

5.5 New material models in FEBio
The open and closed cell mesoscopic material models have been implemented in
FEBio. This was written in C++ code and compiled into a .dll plugin, which can
be downloaded and used by other FEBio users. For validation, the computational
results are compared to the analytical predictions. We find that in uniaxial defor-
mation, the axial stress from the theory and simulation agree with accuracy 106.
This was tested with neo-Hookean cell wall material w = 1, w = 4 (which corre-
sponds to  = 0.4 in the infinitesimal limit) and for closed cell - a soft neo-Hookean
cell core c = 0.01, c = 0.49 (which corresponds to  = 0.49 in the infinitesimal

limit). The boundary conditions were as follows: bottom face is fixed in the Z
direction and prescribed in the Z direction on the top. All faces are free in the X
and Y plane, however small cubes are attached to the top and bottom faces with
fixed X and Y to avoid multiple solutions. Clearly, with such strong agreement
between theory and simulation, the boundary conditions suffice for a homogeneous
deformation.
5.5.1 Derivation of the spatial elasticity tensor
The spatial elasticity tensor C is required for the linearisation of elasticity problems
and is calculated here in order for a new hyperelastic material to be implemented
in FEBio. C is of rank four and possesses major symmetries such that [73]
C = CT or CABCD = CCDAB, (5.5.1)

5.6. SUMMARY
5.6 Summary
For stretch-dominated cellular structures with open or closed cells made from an
arbitrary homogeneous isotropic hyperelastic material, continuum isotropic hyper-
elastic models at a mesoscopic level were constructed analytically in [118,119]. To
gain further insight into the non-linear elastic behaviour of these models, here,
we specialised to the case with neo-Hookean cell components, and derived explic-
itly the non-linear shear, stretch, and bulk moduli and Poisson function defined
in [113].
For the continuum models of stretch-dominated structures with open or closed
cells investigated here, the non-linear elastic parameters were predicted analyt-
ically from the material and geometric parameters at the cell level, which were
provided a priori. Conversely, continuum models with specific non-linear elastic
properties may be designed by selecting suitable material and geometric properties
of the components, or these cell level parameters can be derived from experimental
measurements on cellular tissues, as in Section 5.4. The limitations in our ability
to perform validation tests for the open-cell model, is explored in Appendix A.
The exploration of the non-linear parameters has been published in the In-
ternational Journal of Non-linear Mechanics [144] and has been presented (along
with the backwards multiscale method) at the 10th European Solid Mechanics
Conference, Bologne, Italy (July 2018).

Conclusions and perspectives
6.1 Overview
The aim of this thesis was to illuminate some of the behaviours of deforming cellu-
lar materials and the links to their composition such as the cell wall, cell core and
cohesive middle lamella. This aim was achieved by studying cell wall pairs and
complex cellular tissues under shear deformation, in addition to exploring multi-
scale models built from microscopic observations. The use of non-linear materials
and large deformation frameworks allows for changes in material properties as the
deformation progresses, which is readily observed in soft biological material, es-
pecially fibrous composites. Our results match experimental observations and are
useful in directing further research.
Simple and generalised shear have been mathematically analysed for over half
a century, yet this is the first time they have been put in the context of contact
mechanics, where the permissible forms of deformed walls are combined with the
complementarity conditions of gap size and contact pressure. The exercise with
isotropic Mooney-Rivlin cell walls is omitted from the thesis, however this gives
detail on the possible quadratic forms of the deformed walls which do not con-
flict with the complementarity conditions. By including transverse isotropy, the
theoretical results depend on a fibre direction and a stiffness in this direction. If
6.1. OVERVIEW
the fibre direction is parallel to the direction of shear, the isotropic case is recov-
ered. For simplified solutions, we assume the fibres to be much stiffer than the
surrounding matrix, but the role of the relative stiffness and a general fibre angle
could be further explored. In addition, the presence of intracellular pressure is
proven to have a cohesive effect on contacting cell wall pairs.
In many soft fruits it is desirable for the tissue to fail by cell bursting rather
than cell-cell debonding, as it is the cell cytoplasm which contains the flavour
and juices. There is relatively little literature on the debonding failure mode as
this is harder to test and decipher from mixed mode results. A limit of the finite
elasticity approach is that no damage can occur in the cell walls, such that cell-cell
debonding can only be explored and not the transition from cell bursting as the
primary failure mode. However, as the information on debonding is limited, our
investigation provides valuable insights. Finite element simulations of multibody
contact problems are usually inefficient due to the algorithms that detect and
resolve contact. As debonding cellular materials can quickly become cumbersome,
a two step procedure is developed to increase speed and reliability. In this case, the
boundary conditions play an important role in limiting the solution space to allow
tractable, measurable results. Frictionless non-penetrative contact is employed
between cells and cohesion is implemented through normal pressure on the cell
walls. Cohesion delays the onset of debonding, but once the debonding force
has overcome a certain limit, the opening increases in size at a constant rate.
The cell core affects the structure through its stiffness (approximated by a soft
elastic inclusion) and a normal pressure acting on the cell walls. The volumetric
constraint in the cell core also delays gap initiation, but here the opening does not
increases in size at the same rate, as the softer the core, the more quickly the gap
grows. Therefore, dehydrating cells will both cause a pull at the intercellular bonds
and increase the speed of gap growth. This is in agreement with the experimental
observations that ageing and cooked plants debond more readily.
Page 130
6.1. OVERVIEW
Expanding the scale of our focus further, we consider continuum approaches
for isotropic cellular materials using the frameworks of [118,119]. The assumptions
here are that the cell walls primarily deform by triaxial stretch, due to the struc-
tural architecture, and that the cell joints do not deform significantly. This frame-
work extends any hyperelastic isotropic material model to a mesoscopic scale, but
only the compressible neo-Hookean strain-energy function is formally explored.
In this case, the non-linear shear modulus, stretch modulus, Poissons function
and bulk modulus are explicitly derived for the cellular material comprising of
neo-Hookean cell walls. These moduli, which quantify multiscale relationships be-
tween the structure and cell wall properties, are the most mathematically pure
elastic characteristics of a soft material, and are in the process of being adopted
within the materials testing community. However, it will be some time before
they are adopted within food sciences. Possibly the most useful aspect of the
multiscale method (to experimentalists) is the backward multiscale process pro-
posed in this thesis, as this can enlighten us to the possible cell wall properties
of a biological structure when only the bulk tissue behaviour is known. Although
this method is powerful, there are currently limitations in our ability to perform
experimental validation. This is either due to the restrictions imposed by the
modelling assumptions, or the limitations of experimental processes. In Appendix
A, these limitations are explored for a 3D printed octet-truss geometry. Using this
information, new mathematical/computational/experimental models could be de-
signed which provide end-to-end validation. However, this was outside the context
of this thesis as it would require new multiscale hyperelastic material models, as
mentioned in Section 6.2.5. The newly implemented material models in FEBio
allows for new finite element simulations that could represent soft cellular tissues,
for example to see the effect of body forces on an apples geometry, or as part of hy-
brid approach where discrete cells are modelled in high stress areas and continuum
material where debonding does not occur, as discussed in Section 6.2.3.

6.2.1 Cell size effect
Not discussed in the body of this thesis is the impact of cell size. Cell size is
explored in a collaboration project (included in Appendix B) where we test several
silicone structures in homogeneous deformation, with the same beam thickness-
to-length ratio. This study highlights that smaller, but more numerous cells of
hyperelastic material will increase sample stiffness. However, within the multiscale
framework, each of these structures would give the same elastic properties. Often
in multiscale frameworks the cell size is assumed to be much smaller than the
sample size, yet here we do not enforce this constraint and there may be some way
to include the effects of cell size.
6.2.2 Stochastic material parameters
Accounting for the inherent variability in material properties is one of the next
stages in research for hyperelastic materials [115]. This could be the result of
variation between samples, within individual samples, and from experimental er-
ror/uncertainty. In this case, the standard deterministic model parameters and
equilibria are replaced by stochastic parameters and likely equilibria, defined
in terms of probability distributions. Several papers, where stochastic elasticity
problems are treated analytically, have been recently published [105107,116,117],
which contain new and useful findings, and answer important questions such as
what is the influence of the random model parameters on the predicted non-
linear elastic responses? and what are the possible equilibrium states and how
does their stability depend on the material constitutive law?. These problems,
can offer significant insight into how the stochastic formulation can be incorpo-
rated into the nonlinear field theory. Similar stochastic models can be developed
for other mechanical systems.

6.2.3 Hybrid models and generative modelling
Cell-cell dissociation, or debonding, along specific zones is a fundamental process
in the growth, reproduction and ageing of plants. Seed pods and pollen anthers
open along specific contours (dehiscence) [94, 95, 133], whereas leaves and fruits
are shed from prescribed connection points (abscission) [139,140,146]. Dehiscence
and abscission occur through zones which are only a few cells thick. As with fruit,
the cell-cell bonds degrade, but in addition, here, the cells outside of this zone
lignify and become stiffer. Mechanical stimulation is often necessary to initiate
the disassociation between the cells, which may come from harvesting machinery,
human touch or environmental conditions such as wind. In some cases, the disas-
sociation is violent as it releases residual stresses in the material, such as in pod
shatter where the seeds get widely scattered [151]. We may want to delay, dis-
able or promote the onset of this process of debonding. By better understanding
the fundamental processes, from a mechanical perspective, we can better direct
agricultural research efforts for increasing productivity and reduce waste.
So far, we have constructed finite element models for the plant tissue as an
assembly of discrete closed cells with intercellular cohesion, and as a represen-
tative continuum material (developed in [118, 119]). Now we can combine these
approaches to show a more efficient hybrid method that can be used to describe
tissues with different debonding areas, such as in dehiscence and abscission. In
areas where debonding does not occur, a multiscale hyperelastic material model
can be used. This can have different properties to the debonding area, such as
increased wall stiffness and cellular pressure. In the areas where debonding can
occur, discrete cells can be modelled with hexagonal cell walls containing a soft
elastic inclusion and bounded together by an intercellular pressure, as previously
studied. The successive deformation decomposition procedure can also be imple-
mented here.

the strain-energy function

with w, w, c, c representing the cell walls and the core, where the parameters
for the cell core are at least one order of magnitude smaller than the cell wall.

6.2. FURTHER WORK
In the example FEBio simulation, Figure 6.1, structures are subject to shear
deformation through the following Dirichlet boundary conditions:
 uX = 1 displacements, with u+X = 1 on the top face and u
X = 1 on the
bottom face;
 uY = 0 on both top and bottom faces and additionally on all non-boundary
cell faces;
 uZ = 0 displacement on all external faces.
ui, i = X, Y, Z, indicates displacement in the i
th direction, of unitless dimension,
relative to the length of one cell face.
Cell pressure and cohesion are applied by the following Neumann boundary
conditions:
 gn = 0.005 MPa, normal traction on the contact interfaces;
 gt = 0, tangential traction zero everywhere.
The direction of gn is normal relative to the current state of the surface, such that
if the angle of the surfaces changes, so does the direction of force.
We can vary the cell wall stiffness parameter w inside the debonding zone
and in the continuum material. Stiffening in the continuum material (or soften-
ing within the debonding zone) is indicative of the differential stiffness between
lignified areas and non-lignified cells in the debonding zone.
With these tools we can create complex, but efficient numerical simulations
and hope the approach and resulting mechanical insights are used in experimental
investigation of phenomenological processes such as: coordinating the falling of
fruits at harvest; suppressing behaviours such as pod shatter in oilseed rape and
the premature shedding of petals in ornamental flowers; and promoting cell-cell
separation for easy-peel fruit.

Generative modelling
These hybrid models can be incorporated in an adaptive multiscale approach for
the analysis of cellular bodies that can handle a large numbers of cells. In a
multiscale process, a continuum hyperelastic model can be used first to describe
the structure at the macroscopic level, then, after the loading is increased, the areas
where the contact forces reach critical values can be remodelled at the microscopic
level to predict important local effects. The open source MatLab interface for
FEBio, Gibbon [120] is a strong candidate for this iterative remodelling process.
6.2.4 Hierarchical structures
Advancements in manufacturing techniques are also enabling the creation of new
types of materials with several nested hierarchical levels [4, 44, 172, 173]. Such
structures promise to explore uncharted territory in materials research [54,65,160],
while the recursive nature of their hierarchies brings up questions about self-similar
and fractal behaviours [1, 4, 48, 87,134].
As the strain-energy functions for the isotropic hyperelastic cell wall and cell
core materials can be chosen arbitrarily, the mesoscopic models for open- or closed-
cell structures given by (5.2.19) and (5.2.21), respectively, can be applied itera-
tively to create hierarchical or self-similar structures. In this case, the cell walls
would consist of stretch-dominated architectures with open or closed cells. For
a model to be classified as self-similar, the geometric and kinematic assumptions
must hold on multiple levels. These models can be useful in deformation decom-
position or multiple scale procedures, where a cellular structure is represented first
as a continuum material deforming under finite homogeneous strain. The design of
such models and their non-linear elastic analysis remains to be explored. newpage

6.2.5 Optimised 3D printed structures
The behaviour of generalised shear motion from Section 3.3 could be integrated
into the mesoscopic model of Section 5 to give the time-dependent response of 3D
printed structures in sandwich panels, such as the octet-truss Figure 6.4A or the
hierarchical geometries developed by the author Figure 6.4B&C with a bending
dominated structure embedded within a stretch-dominated architecture. The ma-
terial stiffness is quantified by a multiscale relationship between the microscopic
properties such as beam width. The relationship between oscillation frequency
and applied load could lead to dampening or excitement under specific loads -
which has applications in automotive and aerospace industries where manipulat-
ing vibrations can increase product lifespans as it can mitigate fatigue. This idea
was awarded first place in the Cardiff Sparks competition in the Ideas category,
which funded a batch of 3D printed prototypes.

Appendices
Appendix A
Insight into testing an ordered,
open-cell geometry
We take this opportunity to explore the gap between the analytical theory pre-
sented in Section 5 and practical experiment. This task is non-trivial as both
mathematical assumptions and experiments can have conflicting limitations.
The octet-truss geometry is chosen here as it is an ordered, isotropic lattice
material with microscopic parameters that can be varied (such as beam thickness)
to change the structures elastic properties. The structure is highly efficient and is
one of the most lightweight to stiff geometries available. It has been a geometry of
interest in numerous studies [44,54,65,134,160,172,173] where it has been studied,
(or 3D printed) with linear material. No literature was found for this structure
using hyperelastic material.
Homogeneity
We assume in the mesoscopic framework that the material is deformed by a ho-
mogeneous deformation, such that the same deformation applies to each part of
the material, regardless of position. As we produce a continuum material model,
we assume that the cellular structure can be considered a homogeneous material.
The boundary conditions applied in an engineering tensile test often do not
allow homogeneous deformation. For example, a tensile test uses clamps to grip
the test piece and these restrict lateral contraction, creating necking in the test
material. Often the assumption is made that if the test piece is sufficiently long,
then the middle section deforms homogeneously. Innovative test piece clamps have
been designed for quasi-2D materials (2D designs with a thickness), discussed in
Appendix B, which allow for homogeneous uniaxial tensile deformation.
The material can only be considered homogeneous if there are a sufficiently
large number of cells and the boundary cells behave the same as the central cells.
Unfortunately this is not the case with the octet-truss geometry as the behaviour
of the boundary cells (which deform differently to the central cells) will dominate
if they are not sufficiently far from the centroid of the sample. This means that
the engineering test solutions above are inappropriate as a thin sample will be
subject to the effects of boundary cells.
Stretch-dominated behaviour
The incomplete cells on the boundaries are softer than the core material as the
conditions for being stretch-dominated are not met here. The beams are organised
into diamonds, as shown in Figure A.1 and bending occurs at the joints. The addi-
tion of cross bracing on the boundary can preserve stretch-dominated behaviour.
If the bracing is orientated perpendicular to the direction of force, this will enforce
stretching in the boundary beams, without adding surplus stiffness (as the beam
will only resist cell contraction and not go into tension itself).
Also, the conditions for stretch-dominated behaviour are defined in the in-
finitesimal strain regime and do not necessarily hold true for large deformation.
Shearing and buckling can be observed in very soft materials, or large deformation.
In our models we assume random orientation of beams and that on average,
each beam undergoes the same deformation. The octet-truss has beams with a
prescribed order and geometry and it is noted that 2/3 beams go into tension
Page 142
Figure A.1: The surface of octet-truss cells which show boundaries are not stretch-
dominated.
and 1/3 go into slight compression (as expected in stretch-dominated structures).
This can be seen in Figure A.2 where beams orthogonal to the stretch are blue (no
stress) and all other beams are identically stressed (red). This model was created
using Gibbon [120], an open source MatLab interface for FEBio.
Beam length, orientation and nodal connectivity
The walls are taken to be thin, with the thickness-to-length ratio 0 < k = t/L < 1.
As k increases, so does the joint volume which results in the assumption breaking
down that the joint does not significantly contribute to the strain energy of the
structure. There are limitations in the 3D printing process for beam length, thick-
ness and cell size, due to unsupported overhangs. Using the printing technology
in the Cardiff University Engineering department, the lowest k value achievable is
k = 0.333, where the cell walls are cylinders with diameter 2mm, length 6mm and
unit cell size 11.3mm. k = 0.333 is the upper limit of beam thickness ratio before
the joints show too much deformation.
We also assume that:
 all cell walls have equal thickness and length (however here there are two
different beam lengths. We could take the average beam length);
 the cell walls meet at joints with thickness t (which is roughly true here);

Page 144
 the number of walls connecting at a joint is constant (whereas there are 8
and 12 beam connections).
Measurement
In the mathematical models we calculate the stress within the continuum material
body, but in a non-homogeneous material it is not clear how this internal stress
translates. In experiment, there is often a normal stress applied to the boundary
which is recorded as nominal (or engineering) stress. Due to the deformation
gradient F being assumed to be strictly diagonal, the nominal stress is related
to the first component of the 1st Piola Kirchhoff stress tensor. From the stress
on the boundary we can calculate the expected deformation in the mesoscopic
material model. One can also measure the displacement in individual beams on
the boundary, using optical methods such as DIC (digital image correlation) and
video strain gauge, but as we know already, these beams act differently than those
within the body.
Material properties
Often 3D printing material is not classified by a hyperelastic material model (with
material constants) by the manufacturers so it is the researchers duty to perform
this task. For the polymer ninjaflex used at Cardiff University, Mr. Michael
Robinson performed uniaxial tension (UT), biaxial tension (BT) and pure shear
(PS) tests to classify the material (sufficient data for accurate hyperelastic model
fitting), under a static setting. As the material is incompressible, then [37, 152]
can be used to inform the fitting procedure and appropriate model selection for
a rubber-liker material. The author aided in classifying ninjaflex, finding that
Mooney-Rivlin or Yeoh-Fleming models [167] appropriately fit the data. As men-
tioned in Section 6.2.2, variability will exist within the material model as properties
could vary between prints and could also vary with temperature.

Viscoelasticity and damage
We assume that the material consists of a true hyperelastic material which does
not have strain rate dependant properties and does not undergo microscopic or
macroscopic damage. However in practice, all materials undergo some microscopic
damage/viscoelasticity and show hysteresis. Damage usually starts at the weakest
point in a cellular structure and propagates from there [66]. The test print qual-
ity (Figure A.3) is an acceptable standard for mechanical testing, with bonding
between layers and a roughly smooth step size between layers. However, many
imperfections can be observed which could promote localised stresses and slip
between layers after repeated or high intensity loading.
Summary
There is substantial evidence to support that this geometry cannot be tested in
homogeneous conditions and that any attempt would be a qualitative approxima-
tion. There are different methods that could be approached, including using a
sample geometry which is very wide perpendicular to the loading direction, and
within a sandwich panel. Here the boundary conditions can be approximated
with F = diag(, 1, 1) and simulated with periodic boundary conditions. How-
ever, the mathematics may be better optimised for this situation using simple
shear assumptions rather than uniaxial tension on the microscopic scale.

Non-linear scaling effects in the
stiffness of soft cellular structures
For cellular structures with uniform geometry, cell size and distribution, made
from a neo-Hookean material, we demonstrate experimentally that large stretching
causes non-linear scaling effects governed by the microstructural architecture and
the large strains at the cell level, which are not predicted by the linear elastic
theory. For this purpose, three honeycomb-like structures with uniform square
cells in stacked distribution were designed, where the number of cells varied while
the material volume and the ratio between the thickness and the length of the
cell walls was fixed. These structures were manufactured from silicone rubber
and tested under large uniaxial tension in a bespoke test fixture. Optical strain
measurements were used to assess the deformation by capturing both the global
displacements of the structure and the local deformations in the form of a strain
map. The experimental results showed that, under sufficiently large strains, there
was an increase in the stiffness of the structure when the same volume of material
was arranged as many small cells compared to when it was organised as fewer
larger cells. Finite element simulations confirmed our experimental findings. This
study sheds a new light on the non-linear elastic responses of cellular structures
in large-strain deformations, which cannot be captured with linear elasticity.
B.1. INTRODUCTION
B.1 Introduction
The design and assessment of cellular structures undergoing large elastic deforma-
tions is central in many industrial and biomedical applications, and their math-
ematical modelling and mechanical analysis pose many theoretical and computa-
tional challenges [103,104,113,118,119]. In particular, soft cellular structures are
the subject of important research efforts in regenerative applications, such as soft
tissue scaffolds, for which a better understanding of the mechanical behaviour is
necessary to optimise their functional performance [16,39,45,47,83,148,163,171].
Cellular structures can also be found in both load-carrying and non-load-carrying
matter, in nature as well as in several industrial areas (e.g., impact protection,
aerospace, microelectronics, pharmaceutical and food processes) [56, 66, 122, 136,
161]. Therefore, by studying the fundamental mechanical responses of cellular
structures, important insights can be gained for the development of many areas
of research.
For natural and man-made cellular structures, several key factors determine the
magnitude of the enhancement of stress level in the cellular body, including the cell
geometry, the cell wall thickness, and the number of cells [103, 104, 118, 119, 144].
For two different structures made from the same volume of solid material, which
is distributed uniformly as a small number of large cells or as a larger number of
smaller cells, respectively, if the ratio between the thickness and the length of the
cell walls is the same in both structures, then the stiffness of the structures under
small strain elastic deformations is the same [66]. While this is valid for many
cellular structures with linear elastic cell walls, and similarly, for structures with
non-linear elastic walls in the small strain regime, in many cellular solids, the cell
size is expected to have a more independent effect on the elastic responses, even
though this effect is typically obscured by other structural properties [9, 145].
In this study, for cellular structures with uniform geometry, cell size and dis-
tribution, and a neo-Hookean hyperelastic cell wall material [138,156], we demon-

B.1. INTRODUCTION
strate experimentally that sufficiently large stretching causes non-linear elastic ef-
fects which are governed by the microstructural architecture and the large strains
at the cell level, and are not predicted by the linear elasticity theory. For this
purpose, three honeycomb-like structures with uniform square cells in stacked dis-
tribution were designed, where the number of cells varies while the total material
volume and the ratio between the thickness and the length of the cell walls is
fixed. These structures were manufactured from silicone rubber and tested un-
der large uniaxial tension in a bespoke test fixture. Optical strain measurement
techniques were used to assess the deformation by capturing both the global dis-
placements of the structure and the local deformations in the form of a strain
map [50,60,154,165,170]. The experimental results show that there is an increase
in the stiffness of the structure when the same volume of solid material is arranged
as many small cells than when organised as fewer larger cells. This behaviour is
also captured by our finite element simulations of cellular structures with similar
geometries and cell wall material properties.
This study sheds a new light on the non-linear elastic responses [67,73,88,113,
124,127,157] of soft cellular structures, which cannot be captured by the classical
linear-elastic theory. In particular, we show that, under sufficiently large strains,
the stiffness of the structures with non-linear elastic cell walls varies with the
cell size [104, 118], in contrast to the results predicted for structures with linear
elastic cell walls [66], given that the same volume of material is used for each
structure, and that the thickness-to-length ratio for the cell walls remains the
same. This has important implications for the optimal design of cellular materials
in various applications, and in particular, for stretch-dominated architectures,
which are structurally more efficient, due to a higher stiffness-to-weight ratio,
than the bending-dominated ones [30,66,113,118,119,144].

B.2.1 Structure design and manufacture
Three periodic honeycomb-like structures with a different number of square cells
in stacked distribution were designed and manufactured, ensuring that the overall
volume of solid material used and the ratio between the thickness and the length
of the cell walls is the same for all structures, whilst the number of cells vary.
The geometric parameters for the designed structures are summarised in Table
B.1 and illustrated on a single structure in Figure B.1. In this figure, the tabs
seen at the top and the bottom of the structure allow for the physical structure to
be mounted in the bespoke test fixture, as described in detail in the next section
which focuses on the experimental set-up.

structures were then cast out of Tech-Sil 25 silicone. This silicone is a two-part
silicone, mixed as per the manufacturers instructions, which underwent a two-
part de-gassing process, first after the initial mixing and second after the casting,
then allowed 24 hours to cure. The material behaviour of this silicone is charac-
terised by a neo-Hookean hyperelastic model, described by equation (B.2.1), with
Youngs modulus E= 0.74 MPa and Poissons ratio =0.48 under infinitesimal de-
formations. The neo-Hookean model is the simplest non-linear hyperelastic model,
originally proposed to characterise the non-linear elastic behaviour of rubberlike
material in [138, 156]. Our parameter values were obtained through uniaxial ten-
sile and compression testing, using the process of inverse analysis, prior to the
manufacturing of the structures. A total of six structures were manufactured, two
of each structure type.
B.2.2 Experimental setup
To conduct the uniaxial tensile testing of each structure, a bespoke fixture was
designed (see Figure B.2). This allowed for the (top and bottom) ends of the
structure to slide horizontally whilst the structure was loaded vertically, meaning
that all the initially straight and vertical cell walls remained almost straight and
vertical throughout the testing, avoiding the unwanted bending of the side walls,
which is commonly seen during more traditional tensile tests whereby the ends

direction and create a straight edge during tension.
Page 152
B.2. EXPERIMENTAL MATERIAL AND METHODS
of a structure are clamped. This was achieved through the use of dowel rods
and needle roller bearings, where the friction within the system was minimised
through polishing of the contact surfaces. When the coefficient of friction was
experimentally measured for the system, a resulting mean CoF of 0.020.003 was
found, demonstrating minimal friction within the bespoke test fixture.
Uniaxial tensile tests were conducted using a Zwick - Roell Z050 tensile test-
ing machine, with a 2kN load cell to measure tensile force. Initially, loading and
unloading tests were carried out to verify that the structures were elastically de-
formed, i.e., all the changes in the deformed structures were reversible. For this,
each structure was subjected to a 60N tensile load in 10N increments and unloaded
to 0N after each increment. To measure their local and global deformations, the
structures were subjected to a maximum tensile load of 50N. To capture quasi-
static deformations, the tests were performed at a velocity of 2 mm/s, and a
pre-load of 1N was used to remove slack from the experimental set-up. Tests were
conducted twice for each structure type (n=2).
B.2.3 Digital Image Correlation
Digital image correlation (DIC) is a non-contact optical measurement technique
measuring specimen displacement. A high contrast pattern is applied to the sur-
face of the specimen, which provides unique points of identification to allow the
software to track the displacement of the specimen. The specimen is imaged in its
unloaded state, and this acts as a point of reference for the software. The speci-
men is then imaged throughout loading, either through video or through a series of
camera images. The software will then use the captured images to track the unique
points within the high contrast pattern, measuring the displacement of the speci-
men. From the displacement, strain can then be computed using the parameter of
the affine transformation and the gradients of the deformation [50,60,154,165,170].
Within this study, two DIC systems were used, the first was the Imetrum Video
Page 153
B.2. EXPERIMENTAL MATERIAL AND METHODS
Gauge system. This was used to capture the global deformation of the structure
through the application of virtual strain gauges. The second system was a Q-400
Dantec Dynamic system used to create a 2D map of the strains at a local level,
focusing solely on the centre cell of each structure.
Measuring global deformation
A video strain gauge system (Imetrum) was used to capture the global deformation
of the structure during tensile tests. The system was used with a single camera
with a general-purpose lens and calibrated using markers of a known distance
apart within the field of view, as per the manufacturers instructions. Markers
were applied to the surface of the specimen to allow the software, provided as part
of the system, to track the deformation of the structure. These were applied to the
structure using a black marker pen, with markers applied to the intersections and
the mid-wall of the cells. When processing the data, virtual strain gauges were
applied to the structure, using markers that maximised the length of the gauge,
thus reducing errors within the system. For the purpose of this study, a limited
number of points were selected to validate the new loading fixture, although there
is a potential for further exploiting results obtained from these data.
Measuring local deformation
The Q-400 (Dantec Dynamics) system was used to capture the local deformation
of the structures and to validate the finite element models (FEMs). The system
consisted of the necessary software, Instra4D, a HiLis light source and a data
logging system to connect the cameras to the laptop. The HiLis light source is
a high intensity LED illumination system which provides cool and homogeneous
illumination. Two digital cameras were used with the system and were mounted
onto a tripod with the HiLis light source positioned between them. The two
cameras were connected to a data logging system, which in turn was connected to
Page 154
B.2. EXPERIMENTAL MATERIAL AND METHODS
the laptop. Following this, the aperture and focus of both cameras were adjusted,
focusing on the high contrast speckle pattern applied to the surface of the silicone
specimen [165]. This high contrast speckle pattern was applied using white and
black face paint (Snazaroo). Three different camera setups were required, due to
the differences in structure geometry, ensuring the most appropriate setup for each
structure in terms of the field of view. Each camera set-up differed in terms of their
field of view only, with the same equipment including calibration target and camera
lenses used for each. Following the setup of the DIC system, it was necessary to
conduct a calibration. This determined the position and orientation of each of the
cameras with respect to the surface of the specimen and related the pixel size of the
object image to the metric scale. In order to calibrate the system, a series of eight
calibration images were taken of a calibration target. The calibration target used
for this study was a 99 grid, 40mm x 40mm (Dantec Dynamics). The target was
rotated and tilted for each image to allow the software to determine the required
parameters. A calibration residuum of< 0.1 was considered acceptable [165]. Data
was processed within the DIC software, Instra4D, with the parameters from data
capture and processing displayed in Table B.2. For each structure, two polygons
were drawn over the surface of the struts, one covering the vertical strut, and
one covering the horizontal strut. In both cases, the joints were excluded from
the analysis. For the polygon, mean values of the strain over the surface were
exported. Throughout this study, the Green-Lagrange strain is used [73,113,127].
B.2.4 Experimental results
Global deformation of structures
To validate the new loading fixture (see Figure B.2), and thus ensure that the
boundary conditions achieved are as expected, the global behaviour of each struc-
ture was analysed using the Imetrum video strain gauge system. Virtual strain
gauges were added to the structure, as shown in Figure B.3(a), with the red dots

depicting the marks made on the physical structure. Struts 1, 2 and 3 were com-
pared to verify that the strain was the same for each of these struts, thus ensuring
that no end-effects were present in the structure. The results can be seen in Fig-
ure B.3(b), where the struts exhibit almost identical mean vertical strains at loads
up to around 80N. Throughout the paper, strains are presented as millistrain or
mstrain. Struts 2 and 5 were analysed to ensure that the new loading fixture cre-
ated symmetrical boundary conditions, as seen in Figure B.3(c), where the mean
vertical strains for these two struts are almost identical.
In addition to the vertical strain of different struts, the horizontal strain was
also analysed. Virtual strain gauges were added to the structure as shown in
Figure B.4(a), with the red dots depicting the marks made on the physical struc-
ture. Struts 7 and 8 were compared to verify that the strain was the same for
each strut, thus ensuring that no end-effects were present within the deformed
structure. These results are illustrated in Figure B.4(b), where the struts exhibit
almost identical mean horizontal strains at loads up to around 80N. Struts 8 and
9 were analysed to ensure that the loading fixture created symmetrical boundary
conditions, as seen in Figure B.4(c), where the mean horizontal strains for these
two struts are almost identical.
Although the reported results correspond to the structure with 5  5 cells,

similar results were obtained for the structures with 3  3 and 9  9 cells, thus
validating the new loading fixture in creating the desired boundary conditions for
uniaxial tensile testing under large strains.
To ensure that all testing remained within the elastic limits of the structures
and no plastic deformation occurred, a series of loading-unloading tests were also
performed. The loading conditions were as described previously, with each struc-
ture being subjected to a 60N tensile load in 10N increments and unloaded to
0N after each increment. Figure B.5 shows the results for the three structures.
The data demonstrate no plastic deformation of the structure, with each structure
clearly remaining within its elastic region, with minimal hysteresis between the
loading and unloading paths.

and unloading of the three structures. The blue, red and grey lines represent the
9 9 structure, the 5 5 structure and the 3 3 structure respectively, with the

testing, n=2.
Additionally, the experimental results demonstrated some variation between
different samples of the same structure (see Figure B.5). Despite these variations,
Page 159
B.2. EXPERIMENTAL MATERIAL AND METHODS
the same trend was seen within the data, with the 9  9 structure being stiffer
that the 5  5 structure which was in turn stiffer than the 3  3 structure. The
variation between samples could be caused by a number of factors. One possibility
is the slight inconsistencies in the manufacturing process. For example, the silicone
used is a two-part silicone and small variations in the volume of the mixture could
influence its mechanical properties. Another possible explanation for the variation
in experimental results is the slight change in the testing environment, for example,
tests were not conducted in a temperature-controlled environment.

Since all cells in the structure are deformed similarly, for our analysis, we focus
on the central cell. In Figures B.6-B.8, we show the strain maps within the three
different structures under three different loads each. The same strain map scale
was used for the three structures within each image, but varied for the different
loading stages. At 10N tensile load, there appears to be almost no difference
between the strains in the three structures, as seen from Figure B.6, but as the
load increases, the difference between the strains in these structures increases. For
example, Figure B.6 suggests that, in the structure with 9  9 cells, the vertical
strain at 50N tensile load is greater than in the 55 cells structure, which in turn
is greater than in the 3  3 cells structure. This observation is confirmed by the
results plotted in Figure B.7, where the force required to stretch the structure with
99 cells to a certain magnitude of Lagrange axial strain (or by a certain maximum
vertical displacement) is greater than for the structure with 5  5 cells, which in
turn, is greater than for the structure with 3  3 cells. Importantly, it should be
noted that Figure B.7(b) shows almost no differences in the strains of the cell walls
within the small strain regime (typically, this is classified as below 4% strain or

40mstrain). The strain within the cell walls begin to vary at around 150mstrain,
showing the stiffening effect of the cell arrangements at larger deformations.
To illustrate the orientation of the maximum principal strains in the structures
under tensile loads, in Figure B.8, the strain orientation in the structure with 33
cells at a 50N tensile load is shown. However, similar trends were observed in the
other structures as well, although with different magnitudes of strain. As seen
from Figure B.8, the maximum principal strain is orientated in the vertical direc-
tion within the vertical struts, and corresponds to longitudinal tension, whereas in
the horizontal walls, the maximum principal strain is orientated in the horizontal
direction and corresponds to longitudinal compression. At the intersection be-
tween the horizontal and vertical walls, the orientation of the maximum principal
strain shows a more curved alignment, highlighting the more complex behaviour
that occurs at these joints.
B.2.5 Finite element simulation
Model set-up
In this section, we assess computationally non-linear stretching effects in periodic
cellular structures with square cells in stacked distribution and neo-Hookean cell
wall material [138, 156], similar to those tested experimentally. Within the finite
element simulations, the generalised neo-Hookean model was used, characterised
by the strain energy density function:
W(I1, I2, I3) =
(I1  3 ln I3) +
, (B.2.1)
where  = E/[2 + ] > 0 and  = E/[(1 + )(1  2)] > 0 are constant mate-
rial parameters, with E and  denoting the Youngs modulus and Poissons ratio
respectively, and  representing the shear modulus at infinitesimal deformations,
and C = FTF and B = FFT , with F denoting the (large-strain) deformation
Page 163
B.2. EXPERIMENTAL MATERIAL AND METHODS
gradient. The Green-Lagrange strain tensor then takes the form E = (C  I)/2,
where C is the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor defined above and I is the
identity tensor (note the boldface notation for tensors) [73,113,127].
As in the experimental tests, a Youngs modulus, E, of 0.74 MPa and a Pois-
sons ratio, , of 0.48 were assumed for the cell wall material. These parameter
values were then used to compute the constants  and  for the neo-Hookean
model, given by (B.2.1), in the finite element simulations. As a Poissons ratio of
0.5 corresponds to perfect incompressibility, a Poissons ratio of 0.48 represents a
condition of slight compressibility (or near incompressibility). The modelled struc-
tures had the same geometry as those tested experimentally, but the symmetry of
the boundary conditions was used to reduce computational cost, modelling only
half of the tested specimen. To compute the force-displacement responses in the
computational structures, cylindrical metal rods inserted through the hoops at the
end of the structure were modelled, mimicking the physical tests conducted exper-
imentally. The position of these rods can be seen clearly in Figure B.9. These rods
were modelled as rigid bodies, and the boundary conditions between the rods and
the structure, as rigid interfaces. The rigid rods had a prescribed displacement
in the positive vertical direction to create the prescribed vertical stretch of the
structure. The internal and external faces of the structure were allowed to deform
freely. The boundary conditions applied to the model are shown schematically in
Figure B.9.
The numerical results recorded here were obtained within the Finite Element
for Biomechanics (FEBio) software environment [92]. The model structures were
created in SolidWorks and imported into the FEBio software, and a mesh refine-
ment study was performed for each structure, the results of which are shown in
Figure B.10, to ensure that the numerical results are independent of the mesh
size. To evaluate the mesh sensitivity, the total reaction force was used as this
was a criteria of interest in evaluating the overall behaviour of each structure.

structures investigated, showing the total reaction force for each structure and the

The reaction force was computed within the FEBio software for each of the rigid
rods used in constraining the structures. To calculate the total reaction force for
each structure, the computed forces for each rigid rod were added together and
the resulting reaction force was doubled due to the symmetry assumption applied
to the model. The results were deemed to be independent of meshing parameters
once three results in a row were within 1% of one another. The mesh elements
used were 4-node linear tetrahedral elements, with the exact details of the mesh
used for each structure found in Table B.3. An example of the mesh used for the

The numerical results from the computational models were compared with the
experimental data. For the finite element models, the reaction force on the rigid
rods was exported, as well as the displacement of the structure, to compare with
the force-displacement data acquired experimentally. The results shown in Figure
B.12 for the finite element simulation are in qualitative agreement with the experi-

mental data, as for both the computation and experimental structures, the stiffness
clearly increases with the number of cells. In addition to the force-displacement
curves, the vertical strain maps across the computational and experimental struc-
tures with 5  5 cells are presented, at the same scale, in Figure B.13. In this
figure, the magnitude of the strains found computationally and experimentally
are similar.

50 N load: (a) FEBio model and (b) experimental. Note that the two figures are
shown at similar scale bars (the colours are software-specific). The strain shown
is in mstrain.
For all structures, there are slight differences between the finite element simu-
lations and experimental results. These differences can be attributed to assump-
tions made within the modelling process. One example would be the material
model representing the silicone used to create the structures. For this study, a
neo-Hookean hyperelastic model was chosen with parameters determined exper-
imentally. Furthermore, there is a variation in the experimental results between
samples making it difficult to evaluate the difference between finite element simu-
lations and experimental testing. More experimental testing is required to assess
these variations.

Analysis of FEM data

with (a) showing the 3  3 structure, (b) showing the 5  5 structure and (c)
showing the 9  9 structure. The solid lines show the response of the centre cell
joint and the dashed lines show the response of the centre cell vertical wall. Each
figure shows the total structure displacement against the Lagrange axial strain
(mstrain).
In order to understand the difference in behaviour between the different struc-
tures investigated as part of this study further analysis of the FEM models was
conducted. As part of this analysis, it was found that the joints within the struc-
tures exhibit a different non-linear behaviour compared to the cell walls (Figure
B.14). The non-linear behaviour of the joints changes due to the extra constraints,
therefore when the number and size of the joints changes within a structure, the
mechanical response of the structure changes. Figure B.14 shows that, in the small
strain regime, the difference between the response of the cell joint and the cell wall
is negligible, with the difference increasing outside of the small strain regime. This
trend can be seen in all structures investigated as part of this study.
B.3 Conclusion
In general, for different cellular structures with linear elastic cell walls, containing
the same volume of solid material, which is distributed either as a small number

B.3. CONCLUSION
of large cells or as a larger number of smaller cells, when the ratio between the
thickness and the length of a wall is the same, the stiffness of the corresponding
structure is expected to be the same [66]. For similar structures of non-linear
elastic material also, this behaviour appears reasonable under small strains. How-
ever, in real structures, under sufficiently large strains, the cell size is expected to
have a more independent effect, even though this effect may be relatively minor
or harder to separate from other mechanical responses [9, 145].
The aim of this paper was to separate the cell size effect from other non-
linear elastic responses when the size of the cells and the size of the structure
are comparable (i.e., the cells are not infinitesimally small relative to the cellular
sample). Specifically, for cellular structures with uniform cell size, shape, and
distribution, we demonstrated experimentally, for the first time, that, under large-
strain deformations, the stiffness in cell walls made from an isotropic non-linear
hyperplastic material increases when the number of cells increases while the volume
of solid material and the ratio between the thickness and the length of the wall
remain fixed. This can be attributed to the non-linear responses of the elastic
cell wall joints in addition to that of the cell walls. Therefore, when the number
and size of the joints changes, the response of the structure will change. Further
investigation is required to understand the limits of the structures in regard to
their stiffness.
For our experimental tests, we developed a novel loading method for cellular
structures under uniaxial tensile tests, which allows for a structure to be loaded
in such a way that the end-effects are minimal and the boundary conditions are
suitable for non-linear elastic analysis under large strains.
In addition to the experimental study, we constructed computational models
which simulate the physical structures and reproduce the elastic effects observed
experimentally. Finite element models are suitable for further investigation of
three-dimensional structures with different cell size or cell wall material parame-

B.3. CONCLUSION
ters, and subject to different loads [118,119].
Although many natural structures are irregular, cellular structures with regular
geometry are easily reproducible and can be studied systematically to identify the
independent influence of different properties [103,104,118,119,144]. In particular,
our analysis offers valuable insight into the independent mechanical effect of cell
size for structures under large elastic strains, which cannot be captured within
the linear elasticity framework. Our results naturally open the door to many new
questions, and will inspire further theoretical and experimental investigations.
