Abstract
The neutrons and gamma rays created in nuclear reactions provide a way to measure
conditions in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) experiments. Interpretation of nuclear
measurements requires detailed theoretical models and numerical simulations. This
thesis presents a computational study of the nuclear observables based on radiation
hydrodynamics simulations of ICF experiments. Current measurement techniques are
replicated to highlight their strengths and shortcomings. Novel analyses are developed
to measure conditions in experiments which are currently unmeasured.
Novel features of the scattered and high energy neutron spectrum are investigated.
The neutron backscatter edge spectral shape is shown to be determined by the scattering
rate weighted ion velocity distribution. A spectrum model is developed, tested and
shown to infer currently unmeasured values for fluid velocity and temperature in the
dense DT fuel. For magnetised spherical implosions, secondary DT neutrons exhibit
yield increases and spectral anisotropy. The alpha knock-on component of the tertiary
neutron spectrum shows sensitivity to hotspot transparency.
Images of the DT primary and scattered neutrons are calculated for several radiation
hydrodynamics simulations. The primary neutron image shape analysis is shown to
be robust against differential attenuation effects. The use of multiple energy gates
to measure areal density within different angular ranges is demonstrated. Activation
diagnostics are shown to have finite angular resolution due to the extended nature of
the hotspot.
The time history of fusion gamma rays is found to be correlated to the rate of me-
chanical work performed on the hotspot. The length of peak delays between fusion and
carbon gamma rays indicate the degree of burn truncation. Images of carbon gamma
rays can be used to measure large scale asymmetries in the remaining ablator.
Combining and expanding on nuclear measurements allows a more complete picture
of hydrodynamic conditions. This will aid in understanding and improving ICF exper-
iments.
Role of the Author
The research in this thesis relies on many numerical codes developed at the Cen-
tre for Inertial Fusion Studies (CIFS) at Imperial College London. The radiation-
magnetohydrodynamic code Chimera/Gorgon has been developed by many over the
course of many years. The atomic physics code SpK was created and developed by Dr
Nicolas Niasse [134]. Further development by the author is presented in this thesis.
Namely the inclusion of pressure ionisation and ionisation potential depression models.
The inverse ray trace neutron transport code AKED was initially created by Dr Brian
Appelbe and has been further developed by many at the group [115]. The author has
developed the code by: improving the inverse ray trace algorithm; including angular
smoothing to the rays; including Gaussian energy spectra to the rays and including the
effects of fluid velocity on neutron scattering. The 1D discrete ordinates transport code
Minotaur is entirely the work of the author. The Chimera simulations analysed in this
thesis were performed by Dr Kris McGlinchey [119, 120], Dr Chris Walsh [181, 184], Dr
Jon Tong [174] and the author.
Many external collaborations have been enacted during the course of this research.
Tomographic reconstruction techniques developed by Dr Volegov [177179], and others,
at LANL are used to process neutron images created by the author. To complement
theoretical work on the backscattered neutron spectrum at OMEGA, LILAC simulations
were provided to the author by Owen Mannion at the LLE.

First and foremost, I would like to thank Professor Jeremy Chittenden. Without his
guidance, insight and knowledge this thesis would not have been possible. His super-
vision granted the freedom to explore ideas while still always providing advice and
direction. This made for a truly enjoyable three and a half years of research. I am
also incredibly grateful to Dr Brian Appelbe, his expertise and enthusiasm have been
invaluable throughout my PhD. I apologise for wrecking his whiteboard with all my
questions and half-formed ideas.
I have had the good fortune to have fantastic office mates throughout my time at
Imperial. Whether sharing a coffee or a pint (or cheese), it has been great to engage
in both the pointless chat and the scientific discussion. In particular, I am grateful to
Jerrys students Kris, Chris, Cat and Jon who showed me the ropes when I started. To
those with whom I have gone on conference, thank you for entertaining evenings and
weekends. To all the lovely folk of the Plasma Group, thank you for the tea breaks,
Hyde Park football and pub visits.
To my parents, I am very thankful for your love and support. While it might have
gone over my head when I was younger, your lesson to always put in the effort was
put to good use during my PhD.
Finally, I owe a great debt to Immy for making life outside work so enjoyable.

1 Introduction
1.1 Nuclear Fusion
Nuclear fusion is the combination of light nuclei to form heavier nuclei, releasing energy
if the products are more stable than the reactants. Stars derive their energy from fusion
reactions, first fusing hydrogen to form helium and then fusing heavier elements up
until iron. The energy released per nuclear reaction, Q, is given by the binding energy
difference between the reactants and products. The binding energy per nucleon peaks
around iron (Z=26). Elements heavier than iron can split to form lighter nuclei while
releasing energy, which is known as nuclear fission.

of neutrons and protons as approximated by the semi-empirical mass formula
[149].
1.1 Nuclear Fusion 21
The electrostatic repulsion between nuclei must be overcome in order for fusion to
occur. This introduces a barrier transparency term, T , to the cross section for fusion
reactions, which is often written as [8]:
(E) =
T = S(E)
, (1.1)
where EG is the Gamow energy and S is the astrophysical S-factor, which depends
on the nuclear physics of the reaction and generally has a weaker energy dependence
than the Gamow factor. Thus, reactants with energies much less than the Gamow
energy have a low probability of reaction. In order to sustain a high rate of fusion
reactions a self-maintaining population of nuclei with sufficient energy is needed. If the
reactants are in thermal equilibrium then large temperatures are needed and therefore
the reactants will be in a plasma state. For example, in p-p fusion EG = 493 keV
which requires temperatures significantly higher than the ionisation energy of 13.6 eV.
If some fraction of the energy created in the fusion reactions can be coupled back to the
reactants, maintaining or raising the temperature, then a self-sustaining thermonuclear
burn can occur. The reaction rate is also increased by raising the number density, n,
of the fusing plasma which raises the collision frequency of nuclei (col = nv where
v is the relative velocity of the reactants). The total volumetric reaction rate, Rab,
for a species a colliding with a species b is given by integrating over the normalised
distribution of relative velocities, f(v):
Rab =
1 + ab
nacol,b =
1 + ab
(E)vf(v)dv =
1 + ab
v , (1.2)
where the Kronecker delta, ab, accounts for double counting if the species are identical.
This formula separates the density dependence ( n2) from the temperature dependence
which resides inside the reactivity, v.
Performing nuclear fusion on Earth as a source of energy is a great scientific and
engineering task. It has great potential due to the high energy density of fusion fuel
(greater than a million times that of fossil fuels), little to no nuclear waste and no
greenhouse gas emission. Controlled nuclear fusion also presents a unique scientific
challenge in understanding the physics occurring at the extreme conditions reached.
For example kinetic and hydrodynamic instabilities, properties of dense plasma, and
transport phenomena are areas of active research within the nuclear fusion community.
When selecting fusion fuel candidates: a low Gamow energy EG, a high S-factor and
high Q value are desirable. Hydrogen isotopes have the lowest Gamow energy due to
their singular charge. The reaction of deuterium (D) and tritium (T) (EG = 1182 keV)
has a large S due to a broad 5He resonance as well as a large Q = 17.6 MeV due its stable
products, the doubly magic alpha particle and a neutron. Most fusion experiments to
date currently use or aim to use DT as their primary fusion energy source. The DT
22 Chapter 1. Introduction
fusion reaction proceeds as follows:
D + T   (3.5 MeV) + n (14.1 MeV) , (1.3)
where the bracketed terms in the above expression denote the partition ofQ given to each
product in the centre of mass frame in accordance with energy-momentum conservation.
The high energy alpha particle will transfer its energy back to the reactants through
Coloumb collisions with other charged particles; this allows thermonuclear temperatures
to be maintained. The neutron has a much smaller cross section for interaction with
the reactants so leaves the reaction region after no or few interactions, allowing it to be
used as a heat source for the working fluid of the reactor.
The final consideration is how to confine the fusing plasma for sufficient time such
that the energy released exceeds the energy delivered to form the plasma. In stars the
confinement is achieved almost indefinitely by gravitational forces. Terrestrially, there
are two main approaches: magnetic and inertial. In magnetic confinement fusion (MCF)
magnetic fields are employed to restrict the plasma constituents to travelling along field
lines. In inertial confinement fusion (ICF) the plasma is confined by its own inertia.
The ICF approach is the subject of this research.
1.2 Inertial Confinement Fusion
In inertial confinement fusion a dense, hot plasma is assembled by implosion. In order
for the assembled fusing plasma to achieve thermonuclear burn conditions, the fusion
reaction time must be faster than all energy loss timescales in the system. The fusion
time scale, fus, and power density, Wfus, can be related to the reactivity as defined in
Eq. 1.2:
fus =
nv , Wfus = RDTE =
n2vE , (1.4)
where n is the total ion number density and RDT is the DT reaction rate as defined
in Eq. 1.2. We have used a 50:50 DT mixture and we assume the neutron escapes the
system and only the alpha particle deposits its energy, E = 3.5 MeV.
There are three processes which can prevent thermonuclear burn conditions being
met: radiative losses, hydrodynamic disassembly and thermal conduction losses. Each of
these sets a constraint on the physical parameters of the fusing plasma. Measurement of
these parameters is essential in understanding the plasmas proximity to thermonuclear
burn. The theory and simulation of measurement in ICF experiments is the focus of
this thesis. For context, a brief simplified overview of the fundamental requirements for
thermonuclear conditions in ICF will be given here. More detailed descriptions can be
found in the literature [8, 111].
Firstly we will consider radiative losses by considering bremsstrahlung1 in power
balance with alpha heating. To do this we consider a uniform volume of fusing DT
1Bremsstrahlung or braking radiation is the electromagnetic radiation produced during the deceleration
of one charged particle by another.
1.2 Inertial Confinement Fusion 23
plasma which traps all alpha particles. We will approximate the plasma as optically
thin to obtain the maximal radiative losses:
Wb  Cbn2
n2v(Tb)E W , (1.5)
where Cb is the bremsstrahlung constant (Cb = 5.341037 W m3 keV1/2 for n in m3
and Tb in keV) and Wb is the total bremsstrahlung power density. Due to the density
squared dependence of both processes, the power matching condition above uniquely
defines a temperature, Tb = 4.3 keV, above which alpha heating dominates. Here we
have also assumed the radiation is produced only by the DT plasma. However, in reality
other higher atomic number elements can become mixed into the hot DT. These more
efficient radiators can increase the losses, increasing the required temperature for alpha
heating to dominate.
Secondly we will consider the hydrodynamic disassembly time. To do this a spherical
volume, V , with radius R, uniform density, , and temperature, T , is considered. This
volume will expand due to a rarefaction wave moving at the isothermal sound speed2,
2kBT/mf where mf is the average ion mass of the fuel [8]. By considering the
burning volume as only the unrarefied region, the confinement time scale is given by
[53]:
con =
 R/cs
(R cst)3
. (1.6)
Comparing the fusion and confinement times, we obtain:
= vnR
4mfcs
 R . (1.7)
Hence, a large areal density, R, is required in order to provide sufficient inertia to
confine the fusing plasma. This time scale ratio can be simply related to the fractional
burn up of DT, . This quantity is defined as the ratio of the number of fusion reactions
occurring in the confinement time and the initial number of DT pairs:
  Nfus
RDTV con =
8mfcs
R  1
 R . (1.8)
Here we have ignored fuel depletion so the above expression is only true in the low burn
limit,   1. The temperature which minimises the burn parameter, HB, is found to
be T = 39 keV, which is considerably greater than the bremsstrahlung limit derived in
Eq. 1.5. Evaluating the R constraint at this minimum while including an approximate
correction to include the burn depletion effect [53] we find:
8mfcs
1   73
1  kg/m
. (1.9)
2The wave can be approximated as isothermal at burning temperatures due to the high thermal
conductivity smoothing out temperature changes brought about by decompression [8, 53].
24 Chapter 1. Introduction
It is worth considering this condition for the case of solid density DT (DT,solid = 225
kg/m3). For a 30% burn up fraction, the mass of DT required and the resultant energy
released in the form of neutrons are found to be 2.5 kg and 20 TJ (equivalent to 50
kilotons of TNT), respectively. It is abundantly clear that a much smaller mass of DT
is required and hence DT must be compressed to very high densities to reach the R
constraint. A mass of 1 mg is needed to obtain 100 MJ of fusion energy at 30% burn up
fraction, which requires a compression of /DT,solid  1500 to match the areal density
given in Eq. 1.9. Spherical convergence is preferable for reaching these high compressions
as it minimises the convergence ratio (CR = Rinitial/Rfinal) needed compared to other
geometries and confinement is equal in all directions. A lower convergence ratio allows a
more asymmetric implosion to be tolerated as asymmetries are amplified by convergence.
Up to this point a uniform spherical volume has been considered. However, there
is an issue with using this as an ICF target design. The specific heat capacity of
DT plasma is cDT = 0.11 MJ/keV/mg thus compressing and heating 1 mg of fuel to
sufficient temperatures requires a few MJs of energy. This reduces the maximum possible
energy gain and increases the driver energy required. However, if a small fraction of the
fuel ( 2%) is heated and the majority is compressed at low temperatures, the energy
requirement is reduced significantly. The hot fuel reaches thermonuclear burn conditions
and self-heats. The burn is then propagated into the cold, dense fuel surrounding
it. This hotspot ignition scheme reduces the energy requirements, thus increasing the
possible energy gain. It is the central design philosophy behind current ICF experiments.
The ignition and burn propagation processes have yet to be achieved experimentally but
have been the subject of theoretical and computational research [8, 53, 111, 174].
This leads on to our final energy loss mechanism: thermal conduction losses. Once the
central hotspot and surrounding fuel layer have formed, the large temperature gradient
will create an outward heat flux into the cold fuel. This heat flux is balanced by an
inward enthalpy flux in the form of mass ablation. While this mechanism does not
reduce the pressure in the hotspot [14], it does increase the mass of the hotspot and
consequently the temperature is reduced. The consequent reduction in alpha heating
can prevent the hotspot from reaching self-heating conditions. By assuming that cold
and hot fuel are stationary and isobaric, and that there is some heat front sweeping
cold fuel into the hotspot at a velocity uabl, an expression can be found for the hotspot
heating rate including the effects of alpha heating, radiative losses and mass ablation.
Using the following thermodynamic relations for internal energy, E, and pressure, P :
E = McDTT = V cDTT, (1.10)
cDTT, (1.11)
1.2 Inertial Confinement Fusion 25
we obtain the following equations [14, 91]:

Ehs =

which can be combined to find the rate of temperature change of the hotspot:

where V is volume, S surface area, E internal energy and P pressure. Subscripts hs
and sh denote the hotspot and cold fuel shell respectively. Dotted quantities are used
to denote time derivatives. Small surface area to volume ratios are preferable in order
to minimise thermal conductive cooling of the hotspot3. A constraint on the ablation

, (1.16)
where  quantifies the symmetry of the hotspot by comparing the surface area to volume
ratio to the spherical case such that  = 1 for a perfectly spherical hotspot and  < 1
for asymmetric hotspots. Here we have again assumed the fuel is optically thin and
all alpha particles stop. The alpha particles can deposit their energy in the hotspot,
thus raising the temperature without increasing the ablation velocity. If, however,
alpha particles deposit their energy in the fuel shell then this can increase the ablation
velocity. The region in which they deposit their energy is dependent on the hotspot
temperature and areal density. Figure 1.2 shows the alpha range at different densities
and temperatures. It is noted that Rhs  3 kg/m2 is needed to ensure hotspot self-
heating at low temperatures.
With this considered, the different regimes of hotspot heating and cooling can be seen
through Eq. 1.16. This is shown in Fig. 1.3. At sufficiently low temperatures, radiative
losses dominate and the hotspot is destined to cool. Depending on the ablation velocity,
which is driven by both alpha and thermal energy being deposited in the shell, the
hotspot can self-heat or cool. For the ablation velocity driven by thermal conduction it
can be shown that uabl  T
hs [14]. This defines a region in which mass ablation cools
the hotspot indefinitely thus preventing ignition. We will refer to this as quenching the
hotspot. At high temperatures, mass ablation can cool the hotspot but not extinguish
it as eventually a stable temperature (Ths = 0) is reached at a lower ablation rate.
In summary, the requirements for hotspot self-heating and confinement are:

slowing on ions and electrons.
1. The hotspot temperature must be sufficiently high such that alpha heating domi-
nates over radiative cooling. In the case of pure DT optically thin bremsstrahlung
loss, the temperature must exceed 4.3 keV. This can be extended to say that high
atomic number mix into the hot fuel must be prevented as this will increase the
radiative losses.
2. The areal density of the whole capsule must be sufficiently high in order to prevent
hydrodynamic disassembly before substantial thermonuclear burn has occurred.
For 30% burn up the areal density of the whole capsule must be  30 kg/m2.
3. Dependent on the hotspot temperature, the rate at which cold fuel mass is ablated
into the hotspot must be low enough to prevent uncontrolled cooling. This mass
ablation can be driven by thermal conduction and alpha heating. If the hotspot
has R  3 kg/m2 and T . 10 keV then the majority of alphas deposit their
energy in the hotspot, reducing the ablation velocity. For sufficiently high hotspot
temperatures T & 20 keV then thermal conduction driven mass ablation cannot
reduce the hotspot temperature indefinitely so no longer can cause failure.
With these established end goals, the implosion and drive of ICF capsules will be out-
lined. There are two methods for driving capsules, direct and indirect drive, involving
the direct and indirect irradiation with laser energy. As the name suggests, direct drive

are plotted against hotspot temperature, Ths, for  = 1, Rhs = 4 kg/m
and Tsh = 500 eV based on Eqs. 1.12 to 1.16. Since the hotspot areal density
is sufficiently high to stop alphas, we will consider the mass ablation to be
thermal conduction dominated. The dashed black line shows the thermal

involves firing many beams of a laser directly at the capsule, while indirect drive involves
the laser being used to heat a hohlraum4 surrounding the capsule, creating a thermal
X-ray bath. The irradiation produces pressure on the capsule through ablation, effec-
tively creating a spherically converging rocket. The need to form a central hotspot leads
to capsule designs of the general form seen in Fig. 1.4. The spherical piston formed by
the converging shell compressively heats the central region to ignition conditions. To
maximise gain, ignition should be reached once all kinetic energy has been converted to
internal energy at the stagnation point.
The initial drive phase of an ICF capsule is complex, involving launching multiple
shocks through the ablator and fuel. These shocks can be merged in different locations,
the number of shocks changed or the strength of the shocks altered to control the in-
flight adiabat (entropy). Varying the adiabat controls the balance between stability
and compressibility of the implosion. A higher adiabat is more stable with respect to
hydrodynamic instabilities but less compressible. The main drive ablates mass from
the ablator creating inward pressure through the reaction force. The peak implosion

Figure 1.4: General spherical capsule design aiming for central hotspot ignition. The ini-

the ablator creates ablation pressure which accelerates the capsule inwards to

until stagnation is reached. The capsule has then reached a convergence ratio,
CR, sufficient to both heat and compress the fuel to ignition conditions.
velocity is reached after sufficient mass has been ablated at the exhaust velocity, uex,
as shown by the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation:
uimp = uex ln
, (1.17)
where m0 and mf are the initial and final masses respectively and uimp is the implosion
velocity.
Once the shell has reached its peak implosion velocity, the capsule enters the de-
celeration phase. The kinetic energy of the shell is converted into internal energy of
the hotspot therefore slowing the shell. To explore dynamic evolution of the shell and
hotspot during deceleration and stagnation, the isobaric system of Equations 1.12 - 1.15
are modified to include the work done by an imploding incompressible shell moving at
uhs. First, the mechanical work performed by the shell on the hotspot is included:
Ehs = Wmech +Wabl +W +Wrad , (1.18)
Ehs = uhsPShs +
uablPShs +
n2hsvEVhs QradVhs . (1.19)
Second, the motion of the hotspot due to the shell and ablation is included along with
the associated change in hotspot mass due to ablation:

uhs =

uabl = k

Mhs = Shsshuabl . (1.23)

Finally, the temperature change due to the changing mass and internal energy of the
hotspot is found:
Ths =
MhscDT
 Ths
. (1.24)
The ablation velocity Eq. 1.22 is taken from the work of Betti et al., where the expres-
sions for k can be found [14]. The fuel depletion effect is not included in the model. The
radiation loss term, Qrad, has been modified to include the optical depth of the hotspot.
This reduces the energy loss rate from radiation, especially at lower temperatures. In
terms of the black body function, B , and free-free opacity, 
 , Qrad is given by:
Qrad =

This correctly obtains the optically thin and thick limits. For simplicity radiation
reabsorbed by the shell will be neglected in this model.
Given initial conditions the system of ODEs can be integrated numerically. We will
consider the system from the beginning of stagnation where the shell is free-falling. By
varying the initial velocity of the shell (uhs), the response of the system can be explored.
The results are presented in Fig. 1.5, for the following initial conditions:
Mtot = 0.15 mg, Mhs(t = 0) = 0.02Mtot,
Ths(t = 0) = 500 eV, Rhs(t = 0) = 500 m .
The initial velocity of the shell was varied from 200 to 450 km/s giving shell kinetic
energies, KEsh, between 3 and 15 kJ. For the implosions velocities less than 400 km/s,
radiative losses lead to an inefficient system where the peak internal energy of the
hotspot is less than shell kinetic energy. At 400 km/s, the hotspot begins to appreciably
self-heat thus beginning to overcome radiative losses and thermal conductive cooling.
However it is not sufficient to propagate the burn through the shell with only  20%
of the DT mass entering the hotspot. A 50 km/s increase in the implosion velocity
drastically alters the behaviour; the temperature rapidly increases (Ths > 0) before the
stagnation time,  90% of the shell mass is ablated into the hotspot, and the internal
energy reaches 16  the shell kinetic energy. The increased pressure and low remaining
shell inertia leads to a rapid disassembly leading to a shorter burning period.
In summary, in order for the capsule to reach the requirements for successful hotspot
ignition and burn, the drive must accelerate the capsule to high implosion velocities
while maintaining a high density (low adiabat) DT fuel layer. Due to cooling from both
ablation of dense DT fuel and re-expansion, reaching hotspot temperatures of 4.3 keV
is not sufficient for runaway self-heating. Fuel ablation is however required to reduce
the hotspots transparency to alphas (by increasing the Rhs) and also propagate the
burn once the hotspot has ignited.

1.2.1 Current Experiments
We will now turn our attention towards current ICF experiments, the shortcomings of
the simplistic analysis presented so far, the physical processes preventing thermonuclear
burn conditions from being achieved, and the diagnostics used to measure the capsule
conditions around stagnation.
1.2.1.1 National Ignition Facility
The National Ignition Facility (NIF) contains the worlds most energetic laser (1.8 MJ)
[79] and uses the indirect drive approach to drive cyrogenic layered DT capsules to
stagnation pressures as high as  360 Gbar [108], the highest achieved pressure in
a laboratory experiment. The first ICF experiments began at NIF in 2010 with the
National Ignition Campaign. The capsule and laser pulse design have been altered
over time to increase the stability of the implosion, reaching higher experimental fusion
1.2 Inertial Confinement Fusion 31
yields at the price of reducing the maximum obtainable or clean yield (as predicted
by spherically symmetric calculations). All designs include a hohlraum made of a high
atomic number material, typically gold (Au) or depleted uranium (DU), to convert the
laser energy to X-rays. X-rays are absorbed by the capsule ablator by atomic processes,
heating it and causing ablation. A diagram of the indirect drive concept and the recent
capsule designs used at NIF are shown in Fig. 1.6. A feature included in the experimental
designs which has not been discussed in the preceding analysis is the presence of a high
atomic number dopant in the ablator. The dopant shields the fuel from high energy
non-Planckian M-band X-rays made in the hohlraum, therefore preventing preheating
of the fuel which would limit the compressibility. The dopant element depends on what
can be successfully entrained within the ablator and is generally included at the few
atomic percent level. The high density carbon (HDC) ablator designs can use a much
shorter laser pulse due to its 3.35 higher density than CH plastic as this reduces the
thickness of ablator and therefore the first shock transit time [105].

laser entrance holes and between inner and outer beams. (Right) Diagrams of
the capsule and pulse designs modelled in this work, the dimensions are not
given as these can vary between shots. There are differences in ablator (plastic
vs high density carbon (HDC)) and dopant type as well as laser drive shape
[26, 108, 139]. For scale, capsule outer diameters are  2 mm and hohlraums
are approximately 6 by 10 mm at NIF.
Various degradation mechanisms cause experiments to achieve lower fusion yields
than predicted. Asymmetries in the radiation drive will cause an asymmetric implosion
creating inefficiency in the form of residual kinetic energy (RKE)[188]. As the X-rays
can be absorbed and re-emitted many times inside the hohlraum before striking the
capsule, these radiation asymmetries are generally limited to lower mode numbers. As
32 Chapter 1. Introduction
the drive asymmetries are projected onto the spherical surface of the capsule they can be
decomposed into spherical harmonics. The axisymmetric even modes (labelled P2, P4,
etc.) were studied in more detail in earlier experiments due to the cylindrical symmetry
of the hohlraum. However, low odd modes, mostly L = 1, have been identified as
a significant source of RKE in recent analyses of experiment and simulation [60, 75,
116, 152, 162]. The tent used to support the capsule within the hohlraum imparts
a perturbation to the capsule surface as the X-ray drive causes the tent to explode
[161]. This perturbation is amplified by hydrodynamic instabilities and convergence
producing a region of low areal density through which bubbles of hot fuel from the
hotspot can escape [119, 120]. The fill tube used to feed DT into the capsule creates a
perturbation which launches a jet of ablator material across the hotspot at stagnation
[37, 120, 161]. This ablator material contains the high atomic number dopant so is an
effective radiator causing energy loss [48]. Hydrodynamic instabilities seeded by surface
roughness, volumetric defects such as voids and particulates on the capsule surface will
grow, causing fuel-ablator mix and potentially feed-through to the hotspot; this induces
ablator mix and increases radiative losses [37, 141, 142]. Even if these hydrodynamic
instabilities do not entrain ablator into the hotspot, the cold fuel spikes and hot fuel
bubbles created increase thermal conductive cooling and are a source of RKE [34].

Facility, D. S. Clark et al.,  IAEA, (2018) [39].
Detailed 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations including the current understand-
ing of perturbation sources can be used to assess the relative importance of various
degradation mechanisms, to improve understanding of experimental results and to iden-
tify any possible missing perturbation sources. Examples of high fidelity simulations
performed post-shot at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) are shown in
1.2 Inertial Confinement Fusion 33
Fig. 1.7. The aim of these simulations is to reproduce experimental observables through
introducing known perturbation sources.
Another approach to improve understanding of degradation mechanisms is through
radiation hydrodynamics simulations with idealised perturbations and asymmetries ap-
plied. The aim is not to reproduce a particular experiment but to investigate the
observable effects and failure mechanisms produced. This knowledge can inform both
experiment and simulation to explain discrepancies between prediction and observation
[34, 42, 120, 174].
1.2.1.2 OMEGA
The OMEGA laser at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE) uses 60 laser beams
to deliver up to 40 kJ directly to the target [16]. For direct drive experiments, the
configuration of beams aims to uniformally irradiate a spherical capsule with UV light.
Figure 1.8: (Left) Diagram of the laser irradiation directly on the capsule which is held in
place by the stalk. At OMEGA capsule outer diameters are  1 mm or less.
(Right) a) Skymap of the laser intensity on the surface of the capsule with
uniform equal power in the 60 OMEGA beams. This was calculated using the
view factor software VISRAD [113]. b) Two laser pulse designs, the single
and triple picket, used for ICF experiments at OMEGA, figure reprinted with

by the American Physical Society.
As the radiation is in the optical range, a dopant is no longer required to shield the
fuel and the ablator used is typically plastic. As the ablated plasma at sufficient density
can be opaque to optical light, the laser energy is deposited further from the target than
in indirect drive. More precisely, the critical electron number density, nc, at which the
34 Chapter 1. Introduction
plasma becomes opaque to a laser of frequency l is given by:
me0
, (1.26)
where me is the electron mass, e is the electron charge and 0 is the vacuum permittivity.
Beams at non-normal incidence are refracted away before they can reach the critical
surface. Electrons heated by the laser must then transport the energy to higher densities
to cause ablation. Beyond the driver differences, summarised in Fig. 1.8, the principles
of ICF are the same for direct drive as indirect drive.
Drive asymmetry in direct drive is influenced by the beam geometry so typically
includes higher modes than one would expect from indirect drive [19]. A tent is not
required and instead the capsule is held in place by a stalk which seeds a perturbation
which is the subject of active research [62, 63]. Target offsets from the centre of the
target chamber can induce mode 1 drive asymmetries [116, 146].
1.3 Experimental Nuclear Diagnostics
Evaluating the degradation mechanisms in play within experiments requires a wide
range of measurements. However, ICF experiments present a challenging environment
in which to perform measurements. The short timescales (hundreds of picoseconds),
the small lengthscales (tens of micrometres) and the high background environment re-
quire complex diagnostics to handle these constraints. In this work we will focus on
measurements of products of nuclear reactions and therefore will be observing close to
stagnation when fusion reactions have an appreciable rate. The diagnostics used in cur-
rent ICF experiments and their capabilities will be summarised here as context for the
modelling presented in this work, which aims to simulate the physical phenomena be-
ing measured. Analysis of measured data involves solving an inverse problem, many of
which do not have a unique solution and require an optimization problem to be solved.
High dimensional optimization is difficult and therefore ad-hoc or simplified physical
models are often used in experimental data analysis which belie the true complexity of
the underlying physical system. By both modelling the physical system and the ob-
servable signals we can evaluate the effectiveness of the measurements in capturing the
physical system. Novel measurements and data analysis techniques which could increase
the effectiveness can also be investigated.
1.3.1 Neutron
Neutrons are produced in fusion reactions and can undergo elastic and inelastic nuclear
scattering events within the capsule, altering the neutrons energy and direction of
travel. Both energy spectra and time-gated images of neutron flux outside the target
are measured.
1.3 Experimental Nuclear Diagnostics 35
1.3.1.1 Spectrometers
There are two methodologies for measurement of neutron energy spectra: time of flight
and magnetic recoil.
Neutron time of flight spectrometers (nToFs) use velocity dispersion to separate the
different neutron energies in time. In other words, the faster neutrons arrive first and
the slower later. Then, the arrival time at the nToF relates to a specific neutron energy.
If the detector has a light transit time, tc, from the target, then the arrival time, t, and
kinetic energy, Kn, of the incident neutron are given by:
, (1.27)
Kn = (n  1)mn, n =
1 2n
, (1.28)
where n and mn are the velocity and mass of the neutron, respectively, defined in a
system of units where the speed of light c = 1. The time of production of a neutron can
also alter the arrival time at a detector. However if the detector is positioned far enough
away then the transit time is much larger than the range of production times and the
neutrons can be assumed to have been made at the same instant. Then a distribution
of neutron flux in arrival time, f(t), can be converted to an energy distribution, f(Kn),
through a Jacobian:
f(Kn) = f(t)
 =
(nn)3mn
f(t) . (1.29)
As the Jacobian is increasing with decreasing energy, for constant time resolution the
energy resolution increases with decreasing energy. This is due to the velocity dispersion
increasing at lower energies.
The neutrons are not directly detected but via conversion to light either through
traditional scintillators based on organic molecules [74, 116] or quartz-based Cherenkov
radiators [125]. This introduces neutron energy dependent detector efficiency and a non
Dirac-delta instrument response function. For a perfect delta function IRF the Eq. 1.29
is correct. However the IRF convolves the signal and, as deconvolution is an ill-posed
problem, fitting to experimental data, f(t), is therefore done through a forward fitting
process [74]. The measured neutron flux as a function of detection time, t, is given by:
f(t) =
f(Kn(t))s(Kn(t))a(Kn(t))
(nn)
R(Kn, t
  t)dt+B(t) , (1.30)
where s is the sensitivity of the detector at a given neutron energy, R is the energy
dependent IRF, a is the beam-line attenuation and B is an additional background term.
Here we have introduced the detection time t which due to the IRF is not equal to the
neutron arrival time t. By an appropriate non-linear fitting routine the physical model
f(Kn) can be fit to the experimental data f(t
). The additional background term is due
to scattering of neutrons from parts of the experiment not including the capsule e.g.
36 Chapter 1. Introduction
the target chamber. Using a well collimated and shielded line of sight can minimise this
background contribution [116].
The Magnetic Recoil Spectrometer (MRS) uses an alternative energy differentiation
mechanism by using incident neutron flux to knock on charged particles and measure the
recoil particle energy distribution [54]. A large separation is included between the recoil
particle source, usually a CH or CD foil placed near the implosion, and the magnetic
spectrometer. This creates a small range of acceptance angles to the spectrometer
and thus only the forward scattered recoil particles are measured. Once inside the
spectrometer, the dispersion of the charged particles travelling through the magnetic
field can be mapped to a charged particle energy. Due to the focussing on forward
scattering, this charged particle energy can then be mapped onto a neutron energy. As
there is no reliance on time dispersion, MRS has the potential to perform a time-resolved
measurement using a single detector, although this has not been accomplished at the
time of writing [57].
The traditional analysis of the DT fusion neutron spectrum is to extract the thermal
temperature of reacting ions from the width of the peak. This standard analysis was
first outlined by Brysk in 1973 [23], although there have been many advances in the
description and analysis of the DT peak [5, 132]. A notable addition is the measurement
of a fluid velocity of reacting ions through a shift in the peak centroid [5, 132], which has
been realised experimentally [75, 116, 118]. This analysis also revealed that the apparent
ion temperature extracted from the DT peak includes a significant contribution from
fluid velocity variance induced Doppler broadening. This was verified by the difference
in measured apparent DT and DD ion temperatures [61]. Separately, the scattered
neutron spectrum is used to measure an areal density, R, through a scattered yield
measurement [42, 95].
1.3.1.2 2D Imaging
Similar to the neutron spectrometers, neutrons are not directly imaged but must be
converted to light first. In the case of the Neutron Imaging System (NIS) at NIF [72,
123, 187] this is done by a scintillator after the neutrons have passed through an aperture
array. Both penumbral and pinhole images are created by this array allowing calibration
and subsequent image reconstruction [123]. There are currently three operational lines
of sight (LoS), one polar with (-) coordinates (5.25-225) and two equatorial at (90-
315) and more recently (90-213) [51]. Currently, only the (90-315) LoS can take two
energy-gated images. The time dispersion effect is used to allow different time gates
on the imaging systems to measure different neutron energies. All three LoSs capture
images of neutrons between 13-17 MeV - this energy range is dominated by the primary
DT fusion neutrons. Primary neutron images map out a set of line integrals of T(D,n)
reaction5 rate with an attenuation factor due to scattering and other interactions. The
5Here we introduce the compact nuclear reaction notation. A reaction A+b which produces c+D
is denoted A(b,c)D, where the convention is that the highest mass particles are in the upper case
positions.
1.3 Experimental Nuclear Diagnostics 37
primary image, Ip, with orthogonal image plane coordinates, x and y, and attenuation
length,  , is given by:
Ip(x, y) =
dz RDT (x, y, z)e
(x,y,z) , (1.31)
where z is the coordinate normal to the image. The image is processed to extract infor-
mation about the spatial source distribution, RDT , while generally assuming uniform
or zero attenuation factor. Limited LoS (2 or 3 images) tomographic reconstruction
has been developed by Volegov et al. to allow these 2D line-integrated images to be
converted into 3D source distributions [177, 178]. Tomographic reconstruction will be
discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.
The second image on the (90-315) LoS measures downscattered neutrons between
6-12 MeV. While this image does include neutrons from other sources, a significant
proportion of the signal is due to singly scattered neutrons. To reach 6-12 MeV they
must scatter within an angular range , leading to an image function of the form:
Is(x, y) =
dz ni(x, y, z)e
ds RDT (x sx, y sy, z sz)e
(1.32)
The rate of scattering is proportional to the neutron flux and areal density therefore
subsequent analysis of this image can find the areal density spatial distribution. Consid-
ering only the images along (90-315), Casey et al. developed the fluence compensation
technique to extract an approximate areal density image [25]. The primary image can be
converted to a map of neutron fluence at the scattering site by using the most probable
scattering angle and the assumption of constant brightness per unit length along the
line of sight. Thus an image of areal density can be extracted from the downscattered
neutron image by dividing out the neutron fluence calculated from the primary image.
By combining the fluence compensation analysis with the 3D source tomography, the
assumptions of a singular scattering angle and constant brightness per unit length can
be removed and a 3D map of density can be reconstructed [180].
Due to the limited number of lines of sight and the spatial resolution of  14 m
[72] used to measure the fusing region  50 m and the dense fuel layer  100 m,
tomographic reconstruction is under-determined and therefore error prone. Shape asym-
metry is also extracted from the 2D images by Legendre polynomial decomposition of
the 17% contour6. Only low modes (L . 4) can be resolved so the shape asymmetry
can be related to low mode drive asymmetry. The 17% contour is chosen to avoid the
effects of noise while enclosing a significant fraction of the emission. This can be seen
by Abel transforming Eq. 1.31 for constant attenuation factor and a source which is
6The coefficients of this decomposition are often labelled PN, where N is the polynomial order. The
N > 0 coefficients are typically given as a fraction or percentage of P0.

axisymmetric about y and uniform within its volume:
Ip(x, y) = 2e

dr = 2e
 X(y)
r2  x2
dr , (1.33)
Ip(x, y) = 2e
X(y)2  x2 . (1.34)
For a uniform spherical source (X2 = R2  y2) the 17% contour corresponds to 98.5%
of the total radius [72]. However, a Legendre polynomial decomposition in the source
radius does not simply map to a image plane Legendre polynomial decomposition. For
example, with source radius Legendre polynomial coefficients of R0 = 1 and R2 = 0.2
the 17% contour has coefficients of R0 = 1.09, 0.90 and R
2 = 0.199,0.193 respectively.
It is seen that the sign and amplitude of P2 in the source affects the inferred P0 from the
image, in this case at the 10% level. While contour analysis does not require solution
to a complex inverse problem, equating the inferred shape from a 2D image to the 3D
source (even if axisymmetric) is incorrect.
1.3.1.3 Activation
Activation diagnostics are used to measure the yield of neutrons as well as the anisotropy
of the neutron flux. The total primary DT neutron yield is typically measured by the
activation of the isotope 63Cu through the reaction 63Cu(n,2n)62Cu which has a thresh-
old on the incident neutron kinetic energy of 10.9 MeV [33]. The radioactive product
undergoes + decay (which produces two 0.511 MeV -rays by positron annihilation)
with a half-life of 9.74 minutes and thus the neutron yield above 10.9 MeV can be
measured through the decay rate [41].
The anisotropy of the neutron flux over 4 solid angle is measured by the flange
neutron activation diagnostics FNADs [15, 190, 191]. These use the 90Zr(n,2n) reaction
(activation energy Ea = 12.0 MeV [33]) to produce
89Zr which undergo + decay with
a 3.27 day half-life producing metastable 89mY which de-excites via a 909.0 keV -
ray several seconds later. The activation measurement is described by the following
equation:
A() = ket
dEfn(E, )a(E) , (1.35)
where k is a constant related to the number of target nuclei and target geometry,  is
the decay constant, fn(E, ) is the energy spectrum of incident neutrons in direction 
and a(E) is the cross section for the activation process. The constant k is calibrated
using reference shots where the energy spectrum is isotropic. Then in ICF experiments
anisotropy in the activation, A, is due to anisotropy in fn(E, ). We assume a Gaussian
form for fn(E, ) [23] and linear form for the activation cross section (E) = a,m(E
1.3 Experimental Nuclear Diagnostics 39
Ea) [15]. Then at t = 0 the activation is given by:
A() =
ka,m
Y ()
(E  Ea)e
(EE)2
22 dE , (1.36)
A() =
ka,m
Y ()
(E  Ea)
1 + erf
E  Ea
 (EEa)
. (1.37)
Generally for the DT fusion peak, the mean neutron energy is E  14 MeV with
standard deviation   0.15 MeV. Therefore, to a very good approximation the above
expression simplifies to the fn delta function limit:
A()  kY ()a,m(E  Ea)  kY ()() . (1.38)
We now have two terms which can alter the activation measurement: the intrinsic yield
anisotropy Y () and the centroid shift anisotropy () = a,m(EEa). The intrinsic
yield anisotropy changes due to kinematic focussing and scattering. The first effect
occurs if the emitting material is moving at a velocity ~vf causing the lab frame flux
to be focussed in the direction of travel. Scattering on the path to the detector lowers
the energy of some neutrons to below the activation energy, the ones that undergo
small angle scattering remain above 12 MeV. The downscatter ratio into 12 - 14 MeV
is approximately RDT (kg/m
2)  0.86% for 50/50 DT. These downscattered neutrons
prove difficult to include in simplified analysis as their direction is also altered in the
scattering and their < 2% contribution will be neglected here [15]. The sum of the
kinematic focussing and scattering effects gives an intrinsic yield anisotropy of the form:
Y () 
1 + 2
~vf  
s(E)R()
. (1.39)
The centroid shift anisotropy arises due the activation cross section energy dependence.
Higher energy neutrons are more likely to cause activation and therefore anisotropic
shifts in the mean neutron energy will cause activation anisotropy. The centroid of the
DT peak varies due to a Doppler shift if the emitter is in motion. There are higher
order effects which are neglected here [132], these will be discussed in more detail in
Section 2.2.1. We will split the isotropic shifts to the centroid from the anisotropic
shifts, E = E0 + E(), for clarity. We will approximate the centroid shift due to the
Doppler shift classically:
()  a,m(E0  Ea +mnvn~vf  ) . (1.40)
Around E = 14 MeV, the activation cross section slope a,m = 0.30 barns/MeV and the
scattering cross section s = 0.79 barns for 50/50 DT. Therefore we see the FNADs are
sensitive to areal density asymmetries and bulk flows of the fusing plasma. The centroid
shift due to Doppler shift can be measured using neutron spectrometers [75] and the
FNADs velocity-corrected such that only the areal density asymmetry contribution
40 Chapter 1. Introduction
remains [148].
1.3.2 Gamma Ray
Fusion reactions can create -rays, albeit with a low branching ratio, and are also
produced in inelastic nuclear reactions such as neutron scattering. Given here are the
measured reactions produced within the capsule. The associated branching ratio is
given for the DT fusion reaction [81, 101, 125, 135]:
D + T  5He+  (16.8 13.5 MeV)  4 105 /DTn , (1.41)
n+ C  n+ C +  (4.4 MeV)  1 103(RC) /DTn , (1.42)
where RC is the carbon areal density in kg/m
2. The 4.4 MeV -ray is produced via
a transition from the first excited state to the ground state of 12C  this is a very
narrow resonance with width 0.01-0.02 eV [1]. Neutrons also inelastically scatter in
the hohlraum and the thermomechanical package (TMP) which holds the target in the
chamber, producing background -rays with energies < 14 MeV. There are two time-
resolved -ray detectors at NIF, the gas Cherenkov detector (GCD) [65, 82] and the
gamma ray history (GRH) [81] diagnostics. Both these diagnostics use Cherenkov radi-
ation from electrons which have reached superluminal velocities via Compton scattering
from the incident -ray flux. The Cherenkov production medium is a gas cell where
the fill pressure can be altered to change the refractive index, n, and therefore thresh-
old Cherenkov energy (ne = 1). For illustrative purposes, consider forward Compton
scattering of an electron by a -ray of energy E = me, the threshold refractive index
for Cherenkov production is:
(2 + 1)
(2 + 1)
2  1
. (1.43)
For a 16.8 MeV DT -ray ( = 32.9), the Cherenkov production medium must have a
refractive index of at least 1.00045. Multiple gas cells with different refractive indices
can be used to create spectral windows to remove background -ray signal. The high
energy threshold channel can be used to measure the DT reaction rate as a function
of time, giving measurements of the centroid and width of the reaction history named
the nuclear bang time and burn width respectively. Recent developments to GCD have
introduced a pulse dilation system to increase the time resolution to  10 ps [65]. By
combining two gas cells with threshold energies either side of the 4.4 MeV C inelastic
scattering -ray, inference of ablator areal densities can be made [84]. Time shifts of
the C- peak relative to the DT- peak are also observed [121].
C- rays can be imaged and the (90-213) NIS LoS is developing the capability to
image fusion neutrons, downscattered neutrons, -rays and x-rays simultaneously [51].
The ability to image C- rays has previously been demonstrated on the other NIS LoS by
moving the time gating earlier to the photon arrival time. Similar to the downscattered
1.4 Research Aims 41
neutron image, the C- image intensity is proportional to the neutron fluence and carbon
areal density. With similar imaging techniques discussed in Section 1.3.1.2 information
about the shape of the remaining ablator during neutron production can be found.
1.4 Research Aims
Bridging the gap between numerical simulation and experimental data analysis is ben-
eficial to both areas of research. The aims of this thesis are to both improve the capa-
bility and accuracy of the numerical simulation of ICF experiments and simulate the
observable signals produced. Therefore, we diagnose the simulated experiment as one
would a real experiment. Weaknesses in current experimental analysis; experimental
observations missing from simulated observations and novel analysis techniques can be
realised. As discussed earlier, this work will focus on nuclear diagnostics. One- and
three-dimensional neutron and fast ion transport codes have been developed in order
to produce synthetic nuclear diagnostics based on hydrodynamic simulations. Current
experimental trends across multiple diagnostics are explored through the application of
various perturbations. Additionally, we investigate possible measurements and analyses
which would expand the range of measurements possible in ICF experiments. While
many current diagnostics measure conditions within the hotspot, we aim to directly
measure the unknown conditions of the dense DT fuel and the remaining ablator during
thermonuclear burn through analysis of nuclear measurements.
In Chapter 2, the background theory relevant to describing inertial confinement fusion
implosions and their experimental observables is given. This includes a discussion of:
radiation hydrodynamics; atomic and statistical physics; and fusion reaction products
and their transport. Additionally, the numerical techniques and code used in modelling
the nuclear observables as well as the implosion itself are discussed within this chapter.
In Chapter 3, results under the umbrella of neutron spectroscopy are given. These
include the neutron backscatter edge, spectroscopic signals of areal density asymmetry
and features of the high energy neutron spectrum. These sections present both novel
analysis techniques which could be used on current experimental diagnostics as well as
future developments to further increase the utility of neutron spectra.
In Chapter 4, various results from neutron imaging are presented. Activation mea-
surements and primary and scattered neutron imaging of 3D radiation hydrodynamics
simulations are investigated to highlight both potential shortcomings and successes of
current analysis.
In Chapter 5, -ray measurements are investigated to complete our description of
nuclear observables. These include both imaging and time history measurements of
-rays made in both fusion reactions and inelastic neutron scattering.
Finally the conclusions and plans for future work are given.

The complex physical behaviour of an ICF experiment is governed by the action of
macroscopic systems of particles and the interaction between these systems. The sys-
tems belong to two classifications; those which are locally in equilibrium i.e. thermal,
and those which are non-thermal. Generally the ions and electrons of the bulk plasma
are close to thermal and hence are well described by the hydrodynamic equations. The
thermodynamic properties of this plasma depends on a detailed description of the mi-
croscopic properties of the plasmas constituents. In contrast, the products of fusion
reactions are far from equilibrium due to their long mean free paths. They therefore re-
quire an appropriate transport equation to describe their behaviour. Radiation emitted
by the plasma or used to drive the capsule also requires a non-local treatment. Common
to all these systems is the large number of particles allowing a statistical/probabilistic
description through continuous (~r,~v) phase space distributions. The evolution of these
distributions can be described generally by the Boltzmann equation [98]:
+ ~v  rf +
 vf =
collision
source
, (2.1)
where f is the expectation value of finding any of the particles at location ~r with velocity
~v at time t and ~F is any external force felt by the particles in the system. The various
collision operators and source terms will depend on the system considered. Processes
which conserve particle number, e.g. scattering, will be assigned to the collision term.
Non-conservative processes will be assigned to the source term. Systems of different
particle types couple to each other making the modelling of ICF experiments uniquely
challenging  analytic techniques cannot yield results without many simplifications and
therefore numerical analysis is essential.
This chapter will describe the necessary theory needed to model ICF implosions and
the resultant observable nuclear signals. First, a description of radiation hydrodynamics,
which is used to model the plasma conditions in capsule implosions, will be given in Sec-
tion 2.1. This will be accompanied by a description, in Section 2.1.3, of the underlying
2.1 Radiation Hydrodynamics 43
microscopic behaviour associated with atomic physics which affects the thermodynamic
and radiative properties of the hydrodynamic elements. Second, the theory describing
the transport of nuclear reaction products through the bulk plasma will be given. This
will be separated into neutron transport in Section 2.2.1 and fast ion transport in Sec-
tion 2.2.2. The numerical methods employed to solve a given physical system will be
given in the relevant section.
2.1 Radiation Hydrodynamics
2.1.1 Hydrodynamics
Hydrodynamics is centrally important to the theory and simulation of ICF. The ma-
terials in ICF targets are generally highly collisional giving conditions that are locally
very close to thermodynamic equilibrium. This can be quantified by the electron and
ion mean free paths (MFPs) [86] at typical ICF conditions at stagnation:
e = 0.14
1030m3
)1( Te
m , (2.2)
i = 0.20
1030m3
)1( Ti
m , (2.3)
where ln  is the Coulomb logarithm, Zi and Ti are the charge and temperature of the ion
species i, and Te is the electron temperature. These short MFPs ensure the majority
of particles are in thermodynamic equilibrium and hence have a Maxwellian velocity
distribution. There are populations in the tails which have longer MFPs and therefore
are responsible for transport phenomena. However, these generally only slightly perturb
the velocity distribution from Maxwellian and can be well described by local transport
theory.
Hydrodynamics describes the behaviour of locally thermal populations of particles.
The velocity dimensions of phase space can be integrated out such that only position
and time dimensions remain. At the heart of this treatment are the three conservation
laws used to form the hydrodynamic equations: conservation of mass, conservation
of momentum and conservation of energy. These laws can be derived from Eq. 2.1 by
taking velocity moments. Here we will simply quote the resulting inviscid hydrodynamic
equations [29]:
+ ~u  
+   ~u = 0 , (2.4)
+ ~u  
~u = P + ~Fext. , (2.5)
+ ~u  
+ (+ P )  ~u =   ~q +Qext. , (2.6)
defining mass density , fluid velocity ~u, pressure P , internal energy , heat flux ~q, exter-
44 Chapter 2. Theory and Numerics
nal energy source Qext., and external force ~Fext.. The term inside the square brackets,
named the advective derivative, describes the advection of hydrodynamic quantities
with the fluid motion. Terms involving the divergence of the fluid velocity (  ~u) de-
scribe the change in hydrodynamic quantities due to compression/expansion. On the
right hand side of the equations are terms which do not involve the macroscopic fluid
motion (e.g. P ) or are external to the fluid itself.
A useful analytical result which can be found directly from the hydrodynamic equa-
tions are the Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) jump conditions. These relate the fluid states
either side of a shock. A shock wave is a disturbance which moves faster than the local
speed of sound resulting in a discontinuity in hydrodynamic properties either side of
the shock. The conditions are expressions of the conservation of mass, momentum and
energy across the shock in the frame comoving with the shock. The subscripts 1 and 2
will be used to denote upstream and downstream quantities respectively [40]:
1u1 = 2u2 , (2.7)
1 + P1 = 2u
2 + P2 , (2.8)
  1
u21 =
  1
u22 , (2.9)
where  is the heat capacity ratio. Shocks occur during many phases of ICF implosions
and hence the RH relations are essential in analysing the hydrodynamic conditions. In
the strong shock limit, P2/P1  1, one finds that density and velocity jumps across the
shock converge to a constant value:
  + 1
  1
= 4 for  =
. (2.10)
This demonstrates the need for many strong shocks to reach large compressions of the
ablator and/or fuel during the initial drive. Passing many shocks also allows for lower
entropy production than a single powerful shock  in the limit of a very large number
of successive shocks the compression becomes effectively adiabatic [111].
The hydrodynamic equations given in Eqs. 2.4 to 2.6 are solved numerically within
the code Chimera. The numerical schemes used have been detailed in previous work at
Imperial College [34, 119, 134, 171]. In order to solve these equations for density, fluid
velocity and internal energy, expressions are needed for the remaining unknowns. Ther-
modynamic relations between the pressure, temperature, density and internal energy
can be derived from an appropriate equation of state, this will be briefly discussed in
Section 2.1.3. The heat flux is described by Fouriers law ~q = T and the thermal
conductivity, , is calculated from local transport theory [163]. Coupling from the radi-
ation field and fast ion species, e.g. DT fusion alphas, can be included via force densities
and energy exchange rates. For detail on the coupling and transport of alphas within
Chimera see the work of Dr Jon Tong [174]. Radiation transport will be discussed in
the following section.
2.1 Radiation Hydrodynamics 45
Here we have only discussed hydrodynamics, however, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
and magnetic effects in transport can alter the behaviour of the plasma. The effects
can be significant, especially if a strong magnetic field is externally applied to the tar-
get [140, 183]. For details on extended MHD effects in spherical ICF implosions as
calculated by Gorgon (the MHD version of Chimera) see the work of Dr Chris Walsh
[181184].
2.1.2 Radiation Transport
Radiation is used in the drive of ICF implosions, but there is also significant self emission
by the hot plasma. It therefore affects the dynamics of implosions by acting as both a
source and sink of energy. Measurements of self emission are an important means for
diagnosing plasma conditions in experiment.
In the absence of a material, radiation will free stream. In the presence of an in-
teracting material, radiation will be absorbed, emitted/re-emitted and scattered. The
mechanism for the materials interaction with the radiation field depends on both the ma-
terial and radiation field properties. Here we will draw the distinction between photons
with frequencies   p and  & p. Electromagnetic (EM) waves with frequencies be-
low the plasma frequency cannot propagate. Firstly, for the lower frequencies ( & p)
EM waves create collective responses in the plasma and therefore can refract strongly.
These frequencies are relevant to the propagation of lasers through ICF plasmas. The
laser paths are well described by the geometrical optics approximation  a description
of which can be found in the work of Kaiser and references therein [97].
Secondly, for the high frequencies (  p) photons interact with the medium at a
photon-particle level. This regime is relevant to the transport of X-rays in ICF plasmas,
which will be the focus of this section. The Boltzmann equation (Eq. 2.1) can be used to
describe a population of photons with the simplification that the photons must move at
the speed of light, c. The radiative transfer equation is written in terms of the radiation
intensity, I , which is related to f through a constant:
dAdtdd
f , (2.11)
+   I =
. (2.12)
The photon direction of travel is denoted . The collision and source terms here contain
the interactions of photons with matter through absorption, emission and scattering.
The scattering term can be described through a double differential cross section. This
gives the probability a photon of frequency   moving in direction  scatters to a
frequency  in direction . The collision operator which conserves photon number has
the form:
= ns,sI + ns
d2,s
I(~r, 
,  , t) , (2.13)
46 Chapter 2. Theory and Numerics
where ns is the number density of scatterers, ,s is the total cross section for scattering
at frequency  and the double differential cross section appears in the integral term. The
Thomson and Compton scattering of photons from single free electrons has a differential
cross section given by the Klein-Nishina formula [192].
The absorption and emission of radiation are described through the opacity and emis-
sivity. Physically, the opacity,  , is the inverse of the mean free path of a photon at
a given frequency. The absorption processes which contribute to this opacity include
free-free, bound-free and bound-bound electronic transitions. The (spectral) emissivity,
j , is due to the inverse of these absorption processes, giving the self emission of the
material. These properties will be described in more detail in the following section. By
definition, the opacity and emissivity introduce terms of the form:
= I + j , (2.14)
combining Eqs. 2.12 to 2.14 we arrive at the full radiative transfer equation:
+   + (ns,s + )
I = j + ns
d2,s
I(~r, 
,  , t) . (2.15)
At ICF relevant conditions, the material absorption and emission dominate over scat-
tering for dynamically important photon energies. The small contribution from the
scattering term can be approximated as an averaged absorption cross section. At very
high frequencies such as -rays, scattering can dominate over absorption leading to
drastically different behaviour.
There are two scenarios in which modelling of the radiation field is needed; radia-
tive energy transfer influencing the hydrodynamics and exiting radiation measured by
diagnostics. The full radiative transfer equation requires 7 dimensions: 3 spatial, 2
angular, 1 spectral and 1 temporal. Therefore, radiative transfer is extremely computa-
tionally expensive to solve numerically. Based on the requirements of the two modelling
scenarios, simplifications to the transport equation can be made to ensure tractability.
First, we consider the radiative energy transfer influencing hydrodynamics (i.e. radi-
ation hydrodynamics). Localised sources and beams of X-rays are uncommon in ICF
plasmas, so I should not rapidly vary with propagation direction . Therefore, Eq. 2.15
is simplified by taking the first two angular moments to obtain the energy density, E ,
flux, ~F , and pressure, P :
cE =
Id, Fi, =
iId, cPij, =
ijId ,

E = 4j   ~F , (2.16)
+ c
~F = c2 P , (2.17)
cE  4
d . (2.18)
2.1 Radiation Hydrodynamics 47
Also included is the heating equation, Eq. 2.18, of the material with temperature, T , and
heat capacity at constant volume, cV . The two moment equations involve a streaming
operator which includes the absorption due to the opacity,  . On the RHS, there
are sources due to divergences of fluxes and material emission, j . Solution to these
equations requires a closure relation for the radiation pressure tensor P . Various
closure relations are used throughout work in radiation hydrodynamics, Chimera utilises
a closure and solution scheme known as P1/3 [129] with automatic flux limiting [165].
The closure is obtained by assuming an isotropic radiation field, in which case:
Pij, =
ijId =
ijd =
ijE . (2.19)
The moment equations are also split into a number of radiation energy groups  this
is known as a multigroup solution. Each group uses j and  values which have been
averaged across the range of energies within the group. A detailed description of the
radiation transport methods and their implementation in Chimera can be found in the
PhD theses of Dr Kristopher McGlinchey [119] and Dr Christopher Jennings [94].
X-ray diagnostics can measure spectra or images within certain spectral ranges and
therefore detailed knowledge of the spectrum arriving at the diagnostic is required. The
diagnostics are placed far from the implosion and therefore the incident X-ray flux is
anisotropic. Therefore, the methods employed to solve radiation hydrodynamics are
generally not well suited to this task. By restricting the paths of photons to only those
which intersect the diagnostic, transport is solved only along characteristics of a single
direction, det. X-ray diagnostics of the capsule measure high energy X-rays (several
keV) for which the mean free path is long. Additionally, the material properties evolve
slowly compared to the light transit time so a steady state can be assumed. Using
the method of characteristics, the time-independent radiative transfer equation can be
rewritten as:
I(~r, det) =
ds(~r  sdet)
j(~r  sdet, det) ds , (2.20)
from this we will introduce a formal definition of optical depth,  , between position ~r
and a distance s along direction :
(s) =
ds(~r  s) . (2.21)
When evaluating the radiation intensity at a diagnostic based on a hydrodynamic simu-
lation, radiative properties are constant across grid cells. The radiation intensity exiting
a cubic cell of length l and index i is given by:
I,i+1/2 =
1 e,i(l)
+ I,i1/2e
,i(l) , (2.22)
where I,i1/2 is the radiation intensity entering the cell at the far side. The whole
48 Chapter 2. Theory and Numerics
hydrodynamic simulation domain can be integrated across in this manner allowing post-
processed synthetic X-ray diagnostics to be produced.
2.1.3 Atomic Physics & Statistical Mechanics
Knowledge of the structure of electronic states is required to understand the radiative
properties of a material. We will first discuss how the structure and occupation of
electronic states are determined through a confluence of atomic physics and statistical
mechanics. A thermodynamic ensemble of quantum mechanical states must be con-
sidered in order to determine macroscopic properties. Marrying a small scale accurate
quantum mechanical description with the many-body and many-species thermodynamic
system is an exceedingly difficult task and a field of active research. There are two over-
arching approaches; the physical and chemical pictures. In the physical picture, one
works at the level of electrons and nuclei, calculating electronic states self-consistently.
Bound electronic states cause ions, atoms and molecules to emerge. An example of a
solution method in the physical picture is density functional theory (DFT). However,
physical picture models cannot independently describe all of parameter space due to
the approximations made in their construction. The approach that we shall use is in
the chemical picture. In the chemical picture, we define chemical species within the
material; free electrons, bound electrons, ions, molecules, etc. Each of these species
is described through its own free energy and interaction terms. The free energies can
be derived from the partition functions for the grand canonical, Z, and canonical, Q,
ensembles:
exp [ (En  Nn)] , (2.23)
exp [En] , (2.24)
where n labels the microscopic states within the system with energy En and occupancy
Nn. The inverse temperature and chemical potential are denoted  = 1/kBT and ,
respectively. The partitioning of a thermodynamic system between the different species
is determined through chemical equilibrium. A notable example of this is the Saha
equation, where one considers the chemical equilibrium of ionisation between stages i
and i+ 1:
 Ai+1 + e
 , (2.25)
i = i+1 + e , (2.26)
logZa , (2.27)
a = 
logQa , (2.28)
2.1 Radiation Hydrodynamics 49
where subscript a denotes the species a. Using Eqs. 2.27 and 2.28 one can find an
expression for the chemical potential to solve the Saha ionisation equilibrium, Eq. 2.26.
A benefit of the chemical picture is that it is conceptually closer to the macroscopic
quantities we wish to extract. However, there are two issues which arise from this
approach. Firstly, although the equations of chemical equilibrium are simpler than
the many-body equations of the physical picture, one must construct models for the
partition functions based on microscopic properties and interactions. For all but the
simplest terms, these models are approximate in nature. Secondly, we have drawn a
distinction between chemical species such as free and bound electrons where physically
there is no difference in their properties and interactions. Indeed, core bound electrons
and high energy free electrons do behave differently and are well described by different
models. However, in the middle ground it is less clear that the distinction is meaningful.
Interactions between free and bound electrons must be added back into the model after
the separation of terms  a physical picture model has no such issue.
The discussion above is also relevant for the equation of state needed to close the
hydrodynamic equations. Within the chemical picture, a statistical mechanical de-
scription of pressure, internal energy, heat capacity, chemical potential, entropy, etc.
is possible through thermodynamic potentials. Typically, the Helmholtz free energy,
F = kBT lnQ, is used as it is useful for isothermal and isochoric processes while al-
lowing the pressure to change. The equation of state code FEOS [100, 126], used in
Chimera, is based on a series of additive Helmholtz free energy expressions. Ions and
electrons are given separate free energy terms. Finally, thermodynamic quantities can
be derived from the total free energy, e.g. P = F/V .
Returning now to the Saha ionisation equilibrium, we first consider a dilute, single-
species plasma where interaction terms due to free electrons can be ignored, then the
grand partition functions are given by:
QNideal
= exp
eQintQtrans
, (2.29)
Qtrans =
, i =
2~2
, (2.30)
Qint =
gn exp [En] , (2.31)
Ze = 1 + exp [(E  )] , (2.32)
where Q are the single-particle partition functions, gn and En are the degeneracy and
energy of the discrete energy level n and i is the thermal de Broglie wavelength for
species i. The bound electrons are described by the ion internal partition function, Qint.
Separately, the free electrons are described as a partially degenerate free electron gas
through Ze. We have considered the ions to behave classically for translational degrees of
50 Chapter 2. Theory and Numerics
freedom as typically n3i  1. We can now form the Saha ionisation equation explicitly:
Ni+1Ne
= Nee
Qint,i+1
Qint,i
= Nee
n gn,i+1 exp [n,i+1]
n gn,i exp [n,i]
eIi , (2.33)
where Ii is the ground state ionisation energy and n,i are the excitation energies. The
ionic translational partition functions cancel almost exactly as the ion masses only differ
by a single electron mass. The chemical potential of the free electrons can be calculated
for a given Ne, in the classical limit this simplifies to:
e  2V
. (2.34)
To highlight the power of the Saha equation, we will present the analytical solution
obtained for a classical hydrogen plasma with no bound electronic excitations. The
ionisation fraction, fe = ne/(n0 + n1) = ne/n, is given by:
1 fe
exp [I] , (2.35)
therefore the ionisation fraction can be found over density-temperature space from a
single algebraic expression, see Fig. 2.1. We see increased temperature drives ionisation

and increased density drives recombination. While the Saha solution is well-behaved
2.1 Radiation Hydrodynamics 51
over the whole space, one must remember that here we have neglected interaction terms.
Therefore, the present Saha result is inaccurate at higher densities.
Given all of the ionisation and excitation energies from an atomic model, one might
hope to solve the non-linear set of Saha equations for any element. Even when neglecting
interaction terms, one will quickly run into difficulties. This is because the internal
partition function diverges if all bound levels of an isolated atom/ion are considered.
This non-physicality is a symptom of the separate treatment of bound and free electrons.
In reality the highest lying bound states will be perturbed by nearby charges and become
delocalised. In a simplified view, the transition between free and bound states has moved
to lower energies, this process is named continuum lowering or ionisation potential
depression (IPD). This rather foreign concept is related to the much more familiar
screening process in plasmas. The potential of a charge is screened by the surrounding
charges reducing its effect at large distances. We will consider the effect of a charged
test particle placed into a plasma. In terms of the dielectric function, , in wavenumber-

where  is the electrostatic potential, ~D is the displacement field and ~E is the electric
field. The response of the plasma to applied external potential, ext, from the test
particle results in a screened effective potential, eff. From the linearised Vlasov equation
including the Coulomb potential, it can be shown that one obtains a statically ( = 0)
screened Coulomb potential of the form [104]:

where EFa is the Fermi energy of species a. The response of the plasma is therefore
defined through the inverse screening length, . The classical Debye-Huckel, D, and
highly degenerate Thomas-Fermi, TF , limits of the inverse screening length are given.
A consequence of the screening by the plasma is a non-zero self-energy associated with
the induced electrostatic potential (ind = effext). The induced electrostatic poten-
tial is due to the screening cloud and does not include the potential of the test particle
itself. The total electrostatic energy of the plasma is found by summing the potential
energy of all particles i, correcting for double counting:
Zie(~ri) =
Zieind(r = 0) 
i , (2.39)
52 Chapter 2. Theory and Numerics
from this we can find an expression for the self energy, i, by using Eq. 2.37:
Zieind(r = 0) =
Z2i e
er  1
Z2i e
. (2.40)
Therefore, a free particle in a plasma has an energy of Ei = p
i /2m + i. Since i is
negative, the free continuum has shifted to lower energies. This is exactly the ionisa-
tion potential depression that was eluded to earlier. The bound states of an isolated
atom which lie above i will no longer be bound if placed within a plasma. Models
for i(n, T ) which extend beyond the linearised result given above will be given in
Section 2.1.3.1.
The dynamic version of the static continuum lowering described above is also impor-
tant in plasmas. It gives rise to Stark broadening, an effect commonly considered in
dense plasma X-ray line spectroscopy [71]. Additionally, this discussion will elucidate
why splitting electrons into bound and free within a plasma is too simplistic. At any
point in space the motion of plasma particles creates a time-varying electric potential,
known as the microfield. Figure 2.2 illustrates the effect of a non-zero electric field on
electron bound states at one instance. For tightly bound states, the resultant Stark
shifts are perturbative and will vary in time  in a time averaged sense this effectively
broadens the states. Weakly bound states may temporarily form molecular orbitals as
ions draw close to each other (e.g. H+2 in a hydrogen plasma). Single-ion bound states

can therefore be temporarily destroyed and we must include the statistical average of
this effect to our chemical model. To do this we will use the occupation probability
method which simply introduces a multiplicative factor, wn, which reduces the statis-
tical weight of bound states (gn  gnwn where 0  wn  1). Following the work of
Hummer and Mihalas, we define a critical field F cn at which the bound state n becomes
2.1 Radiation Hydrodynamics 53
unbound. Then the probability of the survival, wn, can be calculated from the microfield
distribution function P (F ):
 F cn
P (F )dF . (2.41)
The microfield distribution function, P (F )dF , gives the probability of the ion experi-
encing an electric field strength in the interval [F, F +dF ]. The microfield is isotropic in
unstructured media and is defined through the statistical average of the summed electric
field from all particles in the plasma. The specifics of the critical field and microfields
distribution models will be given in Section 2.1.3.1.
The combined effects of pressure ionisation can be included in our chemical picture
model by modifying the internal partition function. This is done through the reduced
statistical weights, wn, and shift to the continuum, . An illustration showing the
action of these effects on the density of states is shown in Fig. 2.3. Mathematically
these effects are given by:

The statistical average of the remaining bound states are broadened by the
electric microfield. A fraction of these states can become semi-bound or free
resulting in a statistical weight of the bound state wngn < gn.
We will now begin our discussion of radiative properties. First, we note that in ther-
modynamic equilibrium all forward and reverse processes must balance. Therefore, the
54 Chapter 2. Theory and Numerics
emission of photons must balance the absorption of photons by the reverse process. The
photon field is a blackbody field in thermodynamic equilibrium. Therefore, establishing
equilibrium by balancing processes yields Kirchhoffs law of thermal radiation:
j = B , (2.44)
where B is the blackbody or Planckian function. Therefore, in thermodynamic equi-
librium emissivity can be derived from opacity and vice-versa. While non-equilibrium
conditions can arise in ICF they will not be considered. In these cases, the source
function (defined as the ratio of emissivity to opacity j/) is no longer Planckian and
forward and backward processes must be considered individually. However, the time-
reversibility of microscopic processes can be used to relate the cross sections for forward
and backward processes, even out of equilibrium.
The free-free, bound-free and bound-bound electron transitions produce/absorb pho-
tons. The theory of these processes is well-established and described within the litera-
ture [112, 153, 192]. Only a brief summary of the relevant results is given here.
Electronic transitions between bound states are described through the Einstein co-
efficients which detail the properties of emission and absorption from two levels of a
quantum system. This system can undergo spontaneous emission (defined through the
A coefficient) or interact with the present radiation field to cause photon absorption
and stimulated emission (defined through the B coefficients). These processes alter the
number of electrons in the lower level, j, as they are promoted to or demoted from the
upper level, k. The rate equation for the level j acts to define the Einstein coefficients
A and B: (
= Akjnk + (Bkjnk Bjknj)
d . (2.45)
The principle of detailed balance leads to the Einstein relations, of which we will use
gjBjk = gkBkj . From this and the Boltzmann distribution of energy levels, one can
derive the opacity for the line transition between states j and k:

it should be noted that Eq. 2.46 is true even out of thermodynamic equilibrium. The

where rjk is the dipole matrix element. We have also included the line shape function,
(), which takes a Voigt profile1 due to the convolution of Gaussian and Lorentzian
shapes from various physical processes, e.g. Doppler and natural broadening. The
stimulated and spontaneous processes are not restricted to bound-bound transitions.
Therefore, all opacities must account for the effective decrease in absorption caused
by stimulated emission. In thermodynamic equilibrium, this arises as a multiplicative
[1 exp(h/kBT )] factor.
The free-free process, named bremsstrahlung, occurs within the free continuum of
states so can produce/absorb photons at any energy. The total opacity of thermal
bremsstrahlung for all ion species i is given by [112]:

gff(, T ) , (2.50)
i,ff =

where   1/137 is the fine structure constant, a0  52.9 pm is the Bohr radius and
gff is the free-free Gaunt factor. Gaunt factors are introduced to include full quantum-
mechanical corrections to the semi-classical cross section expressions.
An electron transition between a bound and free state can produce photons at any
energy above a threshold. The threshold energy is the energy required to promote the
electron from the bound state to the lowest energy free state. Using the semiclassical
photoionisation cross-section calculated by Kramer, the opacity of thermal bound-free
absorption for state j is given by [153]:
bfj, = nj
1 exp
gbf(j, , T ) , (2.52)
j,bf =

, h  j ,
0, h < j ,
(2.53)
where Nj is the principal quantum number of state j, Zj is the effective screened nuclear
charge seen by state j, j is the energy between the bound and lowest energy free state
and gbf is the bound-free Gaunt factor. This cross-section has been calculated assuming
hydrogenic bound states.
Given these formulae and the distribution of ionic and electronic states one can calculate
the opacity. Similar expressions exist for emissivities, j .
2.1.3.1 SpK
The initial numerical implementation of the theory described in the previous section was
written by Dr Nicolas Niasse  the code was named SpK [134]. The author has inherited
the code and has performed a number of improvements with the aim to introduce
1More complex line shape profiles can be produced in plasmas, see the textbook by Griem for details
[71].
56 Chapter 2. Theory and Numerics
physical models for warm dense matter phenomena. In particular introducing pressure
ionisation models to the code.
SpK is an atomic model code which uses the screened hydrogenic model (SHM) with
energy levels taken from the NIST database to perform detailed configuration accounting
(DCA) calculations of the state populations, free electron number density, emissivity
and opacity at given conditions. Multigroup emissivity and opacity tables produced by
SpK are used within the radiation-hydrodynamics code Chimera. SpK can work in local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) or collisional-radiative equilibrium (CRE), however,
only the LTE version shall be discussed here. The Saha equations are solved iteratively
using a Picard step with damping [151]. In fact, in SpK the logarithm of the Saha
equations is solved as this more accurately captures the disparate scales which occur
in ionic and electronic populations. With ionic stage index i and iteration index j, the
Saha iterative loop has the following form [134]:
ne,j = Zjntot , (2.54)
i+1,j = i,j + ln [Qe,j ] + ln
Qint,i+1,j

i Zifi,j
i fi,j
, ni,j =
fi,j
i fi,j
ntot , (2.57)
Zj+1 = Zj + (1 )Zj , (2.58)
where ntot is the total number of nuclei in all ionic stages, the internal and electron
partition functions, Q, take the forms given in Section 2.1.3 and Eq. 2.55 is the logarithm
of the Saha equations. The ionic fractions, fi,j , are constructed such that they have
a maximal value of 1. This is to ensure stability over a large range of ion densities.
Picard iteration (Eq. 2.58) updates the jth ionisation estimate where the damping, ,
is typically set at 90%. To initialise the iterative Saha solution, the average ionisation
is estimated using a Thomas-Fermi2 estimate [127, 150], i.e. Z0 = ZTF . The Saha loop
is exited when Zj+1 and Zj converge within tolerance.
Various IPD models exist and each uses different approximations to arrive at the shift
in the continuum. A popular model developed by Stewart and Pyatt [164] retrieves
the low coupling ( = 1
ws  1, where rws = (3/4ni)1/3) Debye limit and high
coupling ion-sphere limit. This is done by ensuring continuity between the small and
large radii limits of the Poisson equation. The Poisson equation solutions include the
self-consistent spatial charge density distributions of ions and free electrons. The value
of induced electrostatic potential at the origin is taken as the continuum shift, . The
2In the Thomas-Fermi (TF) model, both the bound and free electrons are treated as a partially
degenerate electron gas [192]. A self-consistent electron density and potential are calculated from
Poissons equation and the normalisation condition (number of electrons must equal ion charge).
Approximate fits to the TF ionisation state have been performed, see More Table IV for details[127].

resulting Stewart-Pyatt model has a simple functional form:

, lim
 = IS =
40rIS
, (2.60)
where D  1/D is the Debye length and rIS  (3Z/4ne)1/3 is the ion-sphere radius.
The Stewart-Pyatt IPD model has had some success [83] and some failure [36] in ex-
plaining experimental data. It is commonly used in opacity and atomic models, such as
Prismspect and FLYCHK.
The pressure ionisation (PI) model used to calculate the reduced statistical weights,
wn, is based on the work of Mihalas, Hummer and Dappen [88, 89, 124]. The microfield
distribution used is the Holtsmark distribution which uses the ideal gas approximation.
The Holtsmark distribution is therefore correct in the  0 limit  a derivation of the
Holtsmark distribution is given in Appendix A.1.1. The Holtsmark distribution is used
to find the cumulative probability of experiencing a field strength less than a critical
field, F c. This critical field is chosen such the bound state would be classically unbound

field for state n; kn is the Stark ionisation factor which reduces the field required to
ionise high lying states [88]; Nn is the principal quantum number of state n and F0
is the field strength arising from an ion at the mean interionic separation. Numerical
approximations to the Holtsmark cumulative distribution were taken from Poquerusse
[143].
Including Stewart-Pyatt IPD and Holtsmark PI allows SpK to more accurately cal-
culate thermodynamic conditions in dense plasmas. Repeating the calculation for the
ionisation fraction of Hydrogen, free electrons can be obtained as the density is in-
creased, see Fig. 2.4. We can also compare our calculation of opacity to other opacity
codes at X-ray ablation relevant conditions  an example of Carbon at 1 g/cc and 100 eV
is shown in Fig. 2.4. These model improvements have been used to calculate multigroup
opacities to increase the accuracy of radiation hydrodynamics simulations.
While the inclusion of these two models has improved the accuracy of SpK, the models
are derived within separate approximations. A more consistent approach would aim to
calculate wn and  from the same underlying model. This is a goal for future work on

2.2 Nuclear Reaction Products
A multitude of nuclear reactions occur during an ICF implosion, the most notable of
which are the fusion reactions. The products of these fusion reactions have energies
orders of magnitude higher than the thermal energy of the fusing plasma. The products
are either fast ions, neutrons or photons and each of these species undergo a different
set of interactions after their creation. The primary fusion reactions that can occur in
a fusing DT plasma are:
D + T   (3.5 MeV) + n (14.1 MeV)   1 , (2.64a)
D + T  5He +  (16.8 13.5 MeV)   4 105 , (2.64b)
D +D  3He (0.82 MeV) + n (2.45 MeV)   0.5 , (2.64c)
D +D  T (1.01 MeV) + p (3.03 MeV)   0.5 , (2.64d)
T + T  + 2n (+11.3 MeV)   1 , (2.64e)
the branching ratios, , of the reactions are given on the right hand side of the above
equations. The cross sections and thermal reactivities are shown in Fig. 2.5. As alluded
to in the introduction, it is clear that the DT fusion reaction will be dominant with
its reactivity being 2 orders of magnitude greater than the DD reaction. The energy
spectra of neutrons created by these fusion reactions will be discussed in Section 2.2.1.
The fusion neutrons (also known as primary neutrons) can undergo subsequent nu-
clear interactions with nuclei in the background plasma. Listing those with the largest
cross sections: elastic collisions with D,T and ablator materials (C,H,etc.); D(n,2n) and

T(n,2n) reactions3; and inelastic scattering from C. The total cross section for neutrons
interacting with H, D, T and 12C as a function of incident neutron energy is shown in
Fig. 2.6.
The total cross sections for neutrons at 14 MeV are of order 1 barn. Therefore, the
primary DT neutrons have MFPs in 50/50 DT given by:
 4.2 
1 g/cm
. (2.65)
Thus, for currently obtainable areal densities (R . 1 g/cm2) a large fraction of the
primary neutrons can leave the stagnated capsule without collision. For those that
collide, and therefore are lower in energy, subsequent collisions become more likely due
to the increase in cross section at lower energy.
The charged particle products are presented with a Coulomb interaction cross sec-
tion considerably larger than any nuclear interaction cross section. The Rutherford
differential cross section is strongly peaked towards small angles:

80K

where Z1 and Z2 are the charges of the colliding species, K is the kinetic energy of the
3No bound excited levels exist in D and T. Therefore, all inelastic interactions involve the break up
of the nucleus with an energy threshold set by the binding energy. For the deuteron the triplet spin
state is bound while the singlet spin state has a small positive energy  this leads to a resonance
responsible for the large nH scattering cross section at low energies [13]

projectile and  is the scattering cosine.
The effect of Coulomb collisions on fast ions is well approximated by a Fokker-Planck
collision operator, which will be described in detail in Section 2.2.2. However, large an-
gle Coulomb and non-fusion nuclear collisions are still probable and these can produce
additional fast ion populations. Fusion reactions can also occur between fast and back-
ground ions as the raised centre of mass energy drastically increases the cross section,
see Fig. 2.5 and Eq. 1.1. Secondary fusion reactions occur when fast ions produced
in a primary fusion reaction directly undergo an additional fusion reaction. For a DT
plasma, the fast triton produced by the D(D,p)T reaction can undergo a T(D,n) reac-
tion producing a neutron in the 11.9-17.2 MeV range. Tertiary reactions, as the name
suggests, involve the fusion reactions of fast ions indirectly produced by primary fusion
reactions.
2.2.1 Neutron Transport
The multitude of nuclear reactions described in Section 2.2 create and modify the pop-
ulation of neutrons as they are born and traverse the capsule. The spatial variation,
time evolution and energetic distribution of a population of neutrons within a back-
ground fluid is described by a transport equation derived from the Boltzmann equation
(Eq. 2.1). The neutron transport equation is written in terms of the angular neutron
flux, , which is related to the distribution, f , through a constant ( = kf , k = v/mn):
+    = 1
, (2.67)
2.2 Nuclear Reaction Products 61
where   ~v/v is the neutron direction of travel. The source term is due to fusion
reactions in the background plasma. Primary reactions simply spawn neutrons inde-
pendent of neutron flux. Secondary and tertiary sources are more complex but shall be
placed into this term and expanded on in Section 2.2.2 on fast ion transport. All the
neutron source terms will be combined into a single source term, S, which is a function
of position, energy, direction and time:
= S(~r,E, , t) . (2.68)
The primary DT and DD fusion reactions are vitally important in diagnosing hotspot
conditions in ICF experiments. Since they are highly exothermic 2 2 body reactions,
the spectrum of neutrons is peaked close to the centre of mass neutron energy. This
is due to the energy released in the reaction, Q  MeV, being orders of magnitude
larger than the pre-collision centre of mass energy, K  keV. To illustrate the reaction
kinematics from which the spectrum of fusion neutrons arises, we will consider the simple
case of a homogeneous thermal fusing plasma. The velocity distribution of reacting ions
are isothermal Maxwellian distributions. We introduce the reaction notation 1 + 2 
3 + 4 to label particle properties (mass, energy, momenta). With particle 3 being the
exiting neutron, we introduce the following standard kinematic properties [3]:
~vcm =
m1~v1 +m2~v2

, ~vr = ~v1  ~v2, K =

then the neutron spectrum is given by the following expression:

where Ni are the normalisations for the Maxwellians in i-space (e.g. Ncm =

and m12 is the reactants reduced mass. Equation 2.73 gives the normalised neutron
production spectrum at a given K value  the second exponential function has negligible
effect at physically relevant temperatures as it centred at v3 = u3. The resultant total
spectrum (Eq. 2.71) is then written as a reaction probability weighted sum over these
production spectra. This is the natural variable separation since the reaction probability
62 Chapter 2. Theory and Numerics
( nvr) only depends on K. Indeed the reactivity, as defined in Eq. 1.2, can be found
via an integral over K, see Eq. 2.72. Figure 2.7 shows the resultant neutron production
spectrum for the DT reaction at various K and T values.

The overlap of the Maxwellian and cross section creates the Gamow peak
which shifts to higher K as the temperature increases. (Right) Plot showing
the neutron production spectrum at two K values of 10 and 50 keV. The
spectra are normalised and therefore do not take into account the increased
reaction rate at higher K and T .
Here we have used classical mechanics for simplicity, however relativistically correct
calculations have been performed in the literature which increase both the accuracy and
complexity of the expressions [5, 132]. A DT fusion neutron moves at  0.17c and hence
relativistic corrections are on the order of 1  1.5%. Many approximate evaluations
of Eq. 2.71 have been performed, most notably the Brysk [23] and Ballabio [11] forms.
These treatments involve taking moments of the neutron energy E3 in terms of K and
vcm with Eq. 2.70. The moments are then used within Gaussian or modified Gaussian
distributions to approximate the form of the neutron production spectrum.
While the above analysis is true for an isothermal stationary plasma, the fusing region
in ICF experiments has a wide variety of hydrodynamic conditions which one must sum
over. The moment approach allows the cumulants4 of the total spectrum to be related to
physical quantities of interest. A comprehensive relativistic analysis has been performed
by Munro [132], the results of which are quoted here (in a unit system in which c = k

where  is the neutron emission direction, p is the lab frame neutron momentum mag-
nitude, K is the total kinetic energy of the reactants in the centre of mass frame, and
p0 and E0 are the neutron momentum and energy at K = 0. Higher order terms have
been excluded for brevity. The angle brackets denote a burn average defined as follows:
f =
d3u f(T, ~u)N(T, ~u)
d3u N(T, ~u)
, (2.78)
where N(T, ~u) is the number of neutrons produced at temperature T and fluid velocity
~u summed over all positions and times.
While the derivation of the cumulants is complex, the results are physically intuitive.
The mean neutron velocity at a detector along  depends on the Doppler shift intro-
duced by the fluid velocity and the kinetic energy of the reactants which must be passed
onto the products. The average kinetic energy of reactants is set by the product of the
cross section and the relative velocity distribution which exhibits a Gamow peak. This
peak arises as the cross section grows with energy,  exp(
Eg/K), but the relative
velocity distribution decays,  exp(K/T ), see Fig. 2.7. Increasing the reactant kinetic
energy K causes a shift of the neutron spectrum to higher energy. The centroid of the
Gamow peak then sets , which is named the Gamow shift. The variance in the
neutron velocity is due to Doppler broadening. Therefore, the variance depends on the
range of centre of mass velocities due to both temperature and fluid velocity variance.
The higher order cumulants depend on covariances between shift or broadening induc-
ing mechanisms. As an illustrative example, if we consider a fusing plasma with two
regions of different temperature then the combination of different width spectra will
create wings therefore increasing the kurtosis. Finally the projection onto the detector
LoS gives rise to LoS variation in neutron spectral cumulants. This is due to fluid veloc-
ity introducing anisotropy in the lab frame neutron spectra. There are various orders
at which this can occur depending on the power of fluid velocity which appears. At
zeroth order are the isotropic components (e.g.  and ) which have no anisotropy.
At first order are the vector components (e.g. ~u) which are proportional to the cosine
between fluid velocity and detector, cos  = u. At second order are the matrix com-
ponents (e.g. Var(u)) which have ellipsoidal angular dependence. The eigenvectors of
the matrix give the 3 principal axes and the eigenvalues give the value of the matrix
component along the principal axes. Finally increasingly higher order components have
64 Chapter 2. Theory and Numerics
more complex angular dependences.
Experimental primary neutron spectroscopic measurements have concentrated on ex-
tracting burn-averaged quantities from the first two cumulants. For the mean, four
neutron spectrometers are required to constrain the vector and isotropic components
therefore allowing the burn-averaged fluid velocity and Gamow shift to be measured
[75, 116]. Measurements at both NIF and OMEGA show non-zero burn-averaged fluid
velocity, commonly called hotspot velocity, which indicates the presence of a low odd-
mode drive asymmetry. For the variance, six neutron spectrometers are required to
constrain the matrix and isotropic components [188]. The variance is often called the
inferred ion temperature due to early treatments neglecting fluid velocity e.g. Brysk
[23]. However the six spectral measurements do not enable separation of the tempera-
ture and fluid velocity variance effects. The smallest eigenvalue of the variance matrix
is the linear combination of the temperature and isotropic fluid velocity variance. This
is used as an upper bound on the burn-averaged ion temperature, . The difference
between the largest and smallest eigenvalues gives the maximal inferred ion temperature
asymmetry, often labelled Tion. A large Tion indicates high RKE in anisotropic flows
typically attributed to low mode drive asymmetries [62]. Non-zero skew and kurtosis
have been observed however analysis has been limited due their complex dependencies
on physical parameters [131].
Exact numerical calculations of the relativistically correct version of Eq. 2.71 were
performed by Appelbe by using tabulated data for the cross section [3, 5]. The sum over
all hydrodynamic conditions can then retrieve the true neutron spectrum. This cannot
be extracted from the cumulants alone as they do not constrain the functional form of
the underlying distribution.
Collisions of neutrons with ions of species i, be they elastic or inelastic, are described
by their appropriate double differential cross sections:
nii + ni
(~r,E, , t)
(2.79)
For elastic or inelastic scattering which preserve particle number, the double differential
cross section can be reduced to a single differential cross section through conservation
laws. We will consider a general 2  2 body interaction for species i + j  k + l
with energy Q is released. The momenta of the products must be equal and opposite in
the centre of mass (CoM) frame. Therefore the energy of the products is independent
of angle in the CoM frame. Any frame transformation introduces a 1-to-1 angular
dependence to the outgoing energy, simply due to the vector addition of velocities. This
allows the double differential cross section (or scattering kernel) to be simplified to [169]:
 (0  
0), where: 0  i  k . (2.80)
Here we have used the azimuthal symmetry of the CoM differential cross section to pull
2.2 Nuclear Reaction Products 65
out a factor of 2. Subscript c is used to denote CoM quantities. For example, the lab
frame scattering cosine is denoted 0 while the CoM frame scattering cosine is denoted
c. We have defined a number of kinematic parameters of interest; the energies of i and
k (Ei and Ek), the scattering cosine between i and k which satisfies conservation laws
(0), and the Jacobian relating the CoM and lab frames (g = |c/Ek|).
We will work initially in the beam target frame, where species i will be the projec-
tile, species j is the stationary target and species k is the exiting species of interest.
Kinematic variables can all be written in terms of two parameters a and b:
a2  mlkmij
, a2 =
, (2.81)
m2ijmk
m2jmi
, b2 =
, (2.82)
where: E =
Ei = Ei,c + Ej,c and mij =
mi +mj
. (2.83)
The right hand expressions give physical interpretations to a and b: a2 gives the ratio
of the CoM outgoing energy and the incoming energy, b2 gives the ratio of the energy
in the CoM motion of species k to the incoming energy. E is the same as K used in
the primary spectrum analysis but we will follow the scattering literature here and use
From energy and momentum conservation laws, the kinematic parameters can be
related to a and b as follows (see Appendix A.2.1):
Ek = (a
2 + b2 + 2abc)Ei , (2.84)
0 =
 (a2  b2)
, (2.85)
g(Ei) =
((a+ b)2  (a b)2)Ei
Ek,max  Ek,min
. (2.86)
For a uniform differential cross section, an incoming monoenergetic beam will be scat-
tered into a uniform energy distribution between Ek,max and Ek,min. For example, if we
consider elastic neutron scattering from an ion with mass mj = Amn then:
, b =
, (2.87)
 Ek,max = Ei, Ek,min =
Ei = Ei . (2.88)
The lower kinematic endpoint forms what is known as the backscatter edge, which will
be the subject of Section 3.1. Another example to consider is the beam target DT fusion
reaction (Q = 17.6 MeV) which describes the secondary fusion reaction of the fast triton
66 Chapter 2. Theory and Numerics
from the primary D(D,p)T reaction:
, b2 =
. (2.89)
For Ei = 1.01 MeV Ek,max = 17.2 MeV, Ek,min = 11.9 MeV , (2.90)
this process, amongst others, produces a high energy neutron spectrum which will be
the subject of Section 3.3.
To match the scattering kinematics notation with that of the neutron transport lit-
erature [12, 130, 167, 168]: the neutron energies are given no subscript, all masses
are written as multiple of the neutron mass, primes denote pre-collision quantities and
unprimed denote post-collision quantities.
The differential cross section contains the nuclear physics of scattering which is a
complex problem and the complete description is beyond the scope of this work. For
context, the basics of the quantum-mechanical scattering problem is outlined in Ap-
pendix A.3. The cross sections used in this work were taken from the ENDF [33] and
CENDL [64] nuclear databases. In Fig. 2.8 we show the differential cross sections for
the elastic scattering reactions nD and nT at a neutron energy of 14 MeV.

differential cross section in the beam-target frame as a function of normalised
energy, E0 = 14 MeV. Note the backscatter edges at 1/9 and 1/4 of E0 for D
and T respectively.
In ICF the bulk ions off which the neutrons are scattering are not stationary due to
thermal and non-thermal motion. While the velocities of these ions are generally much
smaller than the neutrons, there is a non-negligible effect. We will consider the elastic
scattering of neutrons from ions of mass Amn. The scattering kernel must be modified in
order to account for the ion motion and integrated over the distribution of ion velocities.
The differential cross section can be assumed constant within the integration range due
the large velocity difference between neutron and ion. Within this approximation, the
2.2 Nuclear Reaction Products 67

The thermal velocity distribution causes the energy-angle relationship to no longer be
1-to-1 as shown by Eq. 2.92 and Fig. 2.9. For the purpose of calculating the differential

MeV the T = 0 and T = 1 keV results remain the same following the form

To include the bulk non-thermal motion, i.e. fluid velocity, of the scatterers we must
transform our kinematic parameters from the beam target frame to the lab frame. The
classical and relativistic treatment of this frame transformation are given in Appen-
dices A.2.2 and A.2.3. Differential cross sections of the form given in Eq. 2.80 are
unchanged in form but the lab frame Jacobian and quantities must be used. We will
consider the classical limit first and the elastic scattering of a neutron from cold (T =
0) ions of mass Amn and pre-collision energy E
i. Using results derived in the appendix,

where  and  are the cosines between the incoming neutron and the initial ion tra-
jectory, and between the outgoing neutron and the initial ion trajectory respectively.
This transformation introduces kinematic beaming as well as changing the kinematic
end points. Forward scatter, 0 = 1, still gives equal incoming and outgoing energies,
E = E. However, backscatter, 0 = 1, now gives:
E , (2.97)
contrasting with the beam-target results given in Eq. 2.88. The scattering cosine also
now explicitly depends on neutron direction. Therefore in the lab frame the energy-angle
relation is more complex and knowledge of only the neutron properties is insufficient in
determining the scattering angle.
The relativistic corrections to scattering kinematics are small, this will be illustrated
by considering the head-on collision between a neutron and ion for which:

shows a comparison of relativistic and classic results for an initial neutron kinetic energy
of 14 MeV. Also shown is how ion velocities alters the arrival time of backscattered
neutrons, which is relevant for the resolution of nToF detectors.
Classical expressions are used in the neutron transport calculations by the codes
Minotaur and AKED, see Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4. The relativistic kinematic corrections
are included when constructing models for experimental data in Section 3.1.
There are some nuclear interactions which occur with greater than two products
and thus exhibit more complex energy spectra. This is due to many distinct product
distributions satisfying energy-momentum conservation compared to the single solution
for the 2  2 body reactions. The final state is now dependent on the details of the
interaction at a nuclear level which are generally complex. For the TT fusion reaction
there are multiple possible reaction channels which contribute characteristic shapes to

The (n,2n) reactions pose a similar problem and differential cross sections are depen-
dent on the nuclear physics models used. The three-body D(n,2n) reaction requires an
understanding of the three-nucleon force [52] which is not well characterised. Here we
will simply present the spectral shapes which are the current best estimates in Fig. 2.11.
2.2.2 Fast Ion Transport
In contrast to the bulk ions which exist in thermal equilibrium, fast ions long mean
free path requires a non-local transport description. In a similar fashion to photons
and neutrons, the fast ion transport equation is derived from the Boltzmann equation
(Eq. 2.1). However the external force term is non-zero due to the effect of electric and
magnetic fields on the charged ion:
+ ~v  f + Ze
~E + ~v  ~B
 vf =
. (2.102)
The source term is due to both fusion reactions and ions knocked on by other fast
species. Bulk ions can also be accelerated by electric fields into the long mean free path
regime. However, this is uncommon in ICF plasmas as they are very collisional. Ion
knock on sources will include a differential cross section term for a collision of species i
which forms our fast ion species of interest j:
= S(~r, v, , t) +
d2ij
vfi(~r, v
, , t) . (2.103)
The primary source term, S, can be calculated in a similar way as the primary neutron
source term. For a 22 body thermonuclear reaction, Eq. 2.71 can be used for the fast
ion product.
The collision term for charged particles is problematic due to the divergence of the
Coulomb potential. Classical descriptions of binary collisions of bare charges must
invoke a cut off  an approach commonly invoked in high energy physics to remove
divergences that exist at scales not well described by the current theory. However the
idea that collisions are binary does not marry well with the concept of screening in plas-
mas. This can be remedied through calculating the potential of mean force which gives
an effective binary potential. For a Debye plasma, the effective potential is the Debye
potential which removes the long range divergence. A quantum mechanical treatment
is required to describe the short scales and remove the short range divergence. These
complex behaviours are hidden away in a function know as the Coulomb logarithm, ln ,
2.2 Nuclear Reaction Products 71
which appeared briefly in Section 2.1. We can now precede with a binary collision treat-
ment with a Coulomb logarithm attached. Inspecting the Rutherford differential cross
section in Eq. 2.66, we note that small angle scattering events are much more likely than
large angle ones. This allows the collision operator to be written in a Fokker-Planck
form  the derivation is complex and only the results will be quoted5. The final sim-
plification is to consider the collisions of fast species a with a Maxwellian population of
species b [80]:

sab = 2x
 abG(xb) = 2x2babG(xb) , (2.109)
ab = 2ab G(xb) . (2.110)
This complex set of equations and definitions describe three collisional processes: an-
gular deflection, slowing down and parallel velocity diffusion, with collision frequencies
dab, 
ab and 
ab respectively. Angular deflection acts to bring about isotropy in the
velocity distribution. Slowing down reduces the speed of particles without altering their
direction like a viscous drag. Parallel velocity diffusion acts to increase the variance
of speeds. All these processes are a result of many successive small angle Coulomb
collisions in which momentum and energy are exchanged between species. As we are in-
terested in describing suprathermal ionic species, we must consider the behaviour of the
collision frequencies at high velocities. The relative importance of the different processes
is shown as a function of xb(= v/vTb) in Fig. 2.12. For reference a 1.0 MeV primary
triton initially has a xe = 0.43
1 keV/Te and for thermal ions xi  43xe
mi/mp.
Slowing by electrons dominates the initial behaviour of fast ion species due to the
large mass difference causing ae  ae. Once the fast ions have slowed sufficiently to
increase the collision frequency, the thermal ions can very effectively slow and thermalise
any fast ion species. The slowing therefore sets the range that fast ions can travel 
this was briefly discussed in the introduction with respect to alpha heating within the

Figure 2.12: (Left) Normalised collisional frequencies as a function of the ratio of fast
ion velocity to thermal velocity. Note the different normalisation for slowing
down which factors out the target mass dependence. At high xb parallel

the thermal species (ma  mb) then ab  ab. In this limit slowing down

work of Antal and Lee was used [2].
hotspot, see Fig. 1.2. In this work, we are more concerned with the nuclear reactions
which can occur in-flight. If we consider a fast D or T ion, the cross section for the DT
fusion reaction peaks at  0.1 MeV, as shown in Fig. 2.5. Generally, fast ions are created
at energies of a few MeV and slowing down reduces their energy as they travel. This
acts to increase the reaction cross section and the number of in-flight fusion reactions.
Therefore, accurate modelling of fast ions and their nuclear interactions requires a good
description of Coulomb collisional processes.
A significant difference between neutron and fast ion transport is the effect of electro-
magnetic fields. Large scale electric fields are rare in plasmas as the charges can easily
move to eliminate the field. Magnetic fields are a much more common consideration
and they can have a significant effect on fast ion transport. The Larmor orbits created
by magnetic fields have radius and angular period given by:
(2.111)
, (2.112)
where v is the ion velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field B. For low B, smaller
spatial and time scales will dominate and the magnetic field will have little effect.
For high B, the fast particles will be confined to small, rapid Larmor orbits and their
behaviour has effectively collapsed down to a single dimension along the field line. How-
ever, all realistic applications of magnetic field effects in ICF will sit in an intermediate
regime. Additionally the hotspot radius, stopping distance and Larmor radius may be
2.2 Nuclear Reaction Products 73
of similar order causing difficulty for analytic techniques and leading to sensitivity to
many parameters. Simulation of fast ion trajectories including the Lorentz force are
therefore necessary. The trajectories of fast D(D,p)T tritons in various magnetic field
strengths is shown in Fig. 2.13.

magnetic field strengths applied along the z-axis. The spatial scale has been
normalised by the triton stopping distance, T . The triton behaviour tran-
sitions from free streaming through to confinement to the field lines. If the
reactive volume is smaller than the stopping distance then one can replace
T with the source radius R.
The fusion reactions which occur in-flight are beam-target and therefore the spectra
differ from the thermonuclear primary spectra discussed in Section 2.2.1. Instead the
differential cross section and kinematic limits must be used (kinematic limits for T(D,n)
are given in Eqs. 2.89 and 2.90). The spectral shape is dependent on the fast ion flux,
energy and angular distribution as well as the target ion density distribution. Figure 2.14
shows the beam-target DT spectra for various beam energy spectra produced by different
physical processes. Fast tritons can be produced in D(D,p)T, nT scattering and large-
angle Coulomb collisions of fusion alphas. Fast deuterons do not have a fusion source and
are only created in knock-on events. The complex interplay of slowing, Larmor orbits,
finite source volumes and spatial distributions make secondary and tertiary neutron
spectra an interesting simulation challenge.
In this work we are focussed on the nuclear diagnostic signatures so the normally
pivotal role of alpha transport in ICF will take a backstage part. Instead the focus
will be on fast deuterons and tritons and their subsequent nuclear reactions. These
species do not contain enough energy density to affect the hydrodynamics significantly

so calculation of their behaviour can be performed as a post-process. Two numerical
codes have been developed to perform fast ion transport in a different number of spatial
dimensions. Minotaur performs 1D spherical transport and therefore does not include
magnetic field effects. AKED works in 3D and therefore will be used when magnetic
fields are present.
2.2.3 Minotaur
Neutron transport including all relevant nuclear processes is an intensive numerical
calculation requiring discretisation of Eq. 2.67 in position and velocity space. Invoking
spherical symmetry allows multiple interaction types to be retained without restrictive
calculation time. Additionally, the plasma fluid velocity is small compared to fusion
neutron velocities (14 MeV neutron moves at 51,000 km/s compared to . 500 km/s fluid
velocities) so the transport can be assumed time independent. This approximation is
on firm ground for the unscattered primary DT neutrons, which leave the capsule in 
1 ps. However, this approximation is less valid for slow neutrons which have undergone
multiple scattering. Therefore, a lower bound of 1 MeV on the neutron kinetic energy
is considered. Written in its conservative form, the 1D spherical neutron transport
equation is given by:
(1 2) + n(r)(E)
(r, ,E) = Sext.(r, ,E) + Sscat.(r, ,E) ,
(2.113)
where  is the direction cosine of the neutron and r is the radius.
2.2 Nuclear Reaction Products 75
There are many methods for solving this equation including Legendre polynomial
expansion of the angular coordinate (named PN ), discretising the angular coordinate
(named discrete ordinates or SN
6) or stochastic Monte Carlo methods. There are
merits to each method, however the anisotropic differential cross sections relevant to
the problem do not favour the Legendre polynomial expansion [169]. The deterministic
discrete ordinates method was opted for over the stochastic method commonly used for
neutron transport in ICF plasmas [186, 189]. As the code was developed to look at di-
agnostic signatures in the neutron spectrum, the statistical noise introduced in a Monte
Carlo solution is undesirable especially when looking at low probability events. However
deterministic methods do have insidious numerical errors which must be investigated
through convergence studies.
With this considered, the author developed a spherical 1D discrete ordinates multi-
group neutron transport code, Minotaur. This involves discretisation of the neutron
distribution over radius (index i), direction cosine (index n) and energy (index g).
First a choice must be made on how to discretise in the angular domain, 1    1.
Legendre-Gaussian quadrature splits the domain into a set of nodes, n, with weights,
wn, which allow integrals to be approximated as follows:
()d 
wn(n), (2.114)
wn = 2 . (2.115)
If () is a polynomial of degree 2N  1, or less, then N -point Legendre-Gaussian
quadrature returns the exact result of the integral. The half points are then defined
through the weights with the appropriate end points:
n+1/2 = n1/2 + wn, 1/2 = 1, N+1/2 = +1 . (2.116)
Generally even N is chosen to avoid solving along  = 0 where the spatial derivative
in Eq. 2.113 vanishes. Normal finite differencing of the angular differential in Eq. 2.113
requires uniformally spaced n in order to recover the correct solution for a uniform
isotropic source,  = S/n. To allow Legendre-Gaussian discrete ordinates, angular
differencing coefficients n+1/2 are introduced which are defined as follows [109]:
(1 2)
n+1/2n+1/2  n1/2n1/2
, (2.117)
n+1/2 = n1/2  wnn, 1/2 = 0 . (2.118)
These coefficients ensure that the correct solution is obtained for the uniform isotropic
6The abbreviation, SN , derives from the procedure of splitting the angular domain into N straight
line segments proposed by Carlson [24]. The method is a special case of the more general discrete
ordinates method which has subsequently adopted the SN label [12].
76 Chapter 2. Theory and Numerics
source case.
The spatial and energy domains are split with more freedom. A comment will be made
here about the multigroup (energy) approximation used in Minotaur as different schemes
exist in the literature [12]. The multigroup equations are found by integrating Eq. 2.113
over a finite energy ranges, the equations are then coupled through the scattering term.
By performing the integration the cross sections must then be replaced by averages, for
example:
(E)(r, ,E) g(r, )g(r, ), (2.119)
g(r, ) 
(E)(r, ,E)dE
(r, ,E)dE
. (2.120)
However, rather undesirably the total cross section is now dependent on angle, . In
Minotaur the flux is assumed to be independent of energy within each group:
(r, ,E)  g(r, )Q(E) =
g(r, )
, (2.121)
(E)dE (2.122)
where g is the width of the energy group. This approximation removes the angular
dependence in cross sections. Suitably small energy groups must therefore be taken so
that /E < /g. Spatially we need only define radii, areas and volumes of cells 
the half points of radii will be taken as the edges of cells:
r1/2 = 0, Ai+1/2 = 4r
i+1/2, Vi =
r3i+1/2  r
i1/2
. (2.123)
By applying these discretisations to the conservative form of the neutron transport
equation (Eq. 2.113) we ensure the correct conservation laws are maintained.
With the discretisation defined, the diamond differencing scheme is used to relate the
fluxes at the boundaries to the centred value:
i,n,g =
i+1/2,n,g + i1/2,n,g
i,n+1/2,g + i,n1/2,g
, (2.124)
2.2 Nuclear Reaction Products 77

where both the external and scattering source term have been bundled into Si,n,g. Equa-
tion 2.124 gives the two diamond difference equations used to relate fluxes at both spatial
and angular faces to centred values. Equations 2.125 and 2.126 give the inward and out-
ward integration of the transport equation. Finally Eq. 2.127 is the solution for purely
radially inward neutrons which is required to solve the whole system, it is often called
the starter flux. The solution procedure is as follows:
1. Solve for the starter flux
2. Perform inward radial sweeps, decreasing i, for n < 0, using the diamond differ-
ence to find i,n1/2,g for the next n+ 1 sweep
3. Perform outward radial sweeps, increasing i, for n > 0, using the diamond dif-
ference to find i,n1/2,g for the next n+ 1 sweep
For all problems considered in this work the outer boundary condition will be taken
as a vacuum condition i.e. no incoming flux:
N+1/2,n,g = 0 for n < 0 . (2.128)
The flux at the origin is isotropic and in a discrete sense this gives the following condi-
tion:
= 0 = 1/2,n1/2,g = 1/2,n+1/2,g . (2.129)
A consequence of the diamond differencing scheme is a loss of positivity of the stream-
ing operator (left hand side of Eq. 2.113). To remedy this a negative-flux-fixup is
employed when instances of negative flux occur [109]. This reduces the accuracy of the
calculation so it preferable to choose sufficient spatial resolution to avoid this. This is
parametrised through h = nr
2|n| < 1 where r is the spatial mesh spacing.
78 Chapter 2. Theory and Numerics
Ignoring scattering for the time being, we can test the transport using a finite, uni-
form, isotropic, monoenergetic, spherical source with constant macroscopic cross section,
 = n. This involves solving the following form of the neutron transport equation
1 2
(r, ) =
(R r) , (2.130)
where  is the Heaviside function. The above equation can be solved analytically using
the method of characteristics:
(r, ) =
(1 exp [l(r, )]) exp
l(r, )
, (2.131)
l(r, ) =
R2  r2(1 2) r < R ,
R2  r2 (1 2) r > R and  >
0 elsewhere ,
l(r, ) =
R2  r2(1 2) r > R and  >
0 elsewhere .
A comparison between numerical and analytic results for the first two angular moments
of  is shown in Fig. 2.15 for R = 1. This shows good agreement for 32 angular groups
used in the numerical calculation.

dashed line shows the neutron current and black lines show the equivalent
results as calculated numerically by Minotaur.
Now that the streaming operator and external source term have been tested, we must
now consider how to handle the anisotropic scattering source term. Commonly this is
done by expanding the scattering kernel in terms of Legendre polynomials [12, 109].
However, for highly anisotropic scattering this can lead to unphysical results such as
negative fluxes [169]. Instead we will use the I and I* methods outlined by Takahashi and
Rusch [167169] which performs no expansion of the scattering kernel. These methods
analytically derive expressions for the angular transition probability, denoted I, when
2.2 Nuclear Reaction Products 79
the azimuthal angles are integrated out. If we consider neutron directions pre-collision,
, and post-collision, , with a fixed scattering cosine, , between them then the
angular transition probability, abbreviated to ATP, is given by [169]:

I(, , ) is symmetric in its three parameters and obeys conservation of probability
when integrated over any one of the angles. The diagrammatic interpretation and the
plotted functional form are shown in Fig. 2.16. Numerically I must be integrated over
the angular group widths in ,  and , one of the three integrals can be performed
analytically thus avoiding the singularities in I at y = 1 [167, 168].
Figure 2.16: (Left) Diagram showing the geometric arrangement under consideration, the
angles between  and r, and  and  are fixed but the azimuthal angle
between  and  is allowed to vary. This causes the angle between  and
r to change between the limits 1 and 2. (Right) The angular transition
probability plotted in terms of the reduced variable y, I(y) =
1 y2
The cosines in y can be interchanged due the symmetry properties of I.
Before introducing the differences between the I* and I methods, the discretisation
and treatment of the scattering source in discrete ordinates will be discussed. First
we will only consider downscatter since, for the relevant temperatures, the degree of
upscatter is small, En/T & 10
3. This also greatly simplifies the transport calculation as
the energy groups can be swept in decreasing energy order (increasing index) a single
time. The s-th scattered source term is calculated using a transport solution for the
s  1 flux, thus a von Neumann series solution can be converged on through multiple
80 Chapter 2. Theory and Numerics
iterations. The discretised version of the differential cross section is often named a
transfer cross section with symbol t as it gives the particles transferred from a given
energy/angle group to another. The scattering source is simply a sum over these transfer
cross sections7:
Sscat.,i,n,g,s =
s1(r, , E) (2.136)
g,g,m,ni,m,g,s1 ,
where m and g are the incoming angular and energy group.
If the lab frame differential cross section is independent of neutron direction, i.e.
the target is stationary, then the I*-method can be used. This involves separating the
calculation of ATP from the differential cross section. In index notation:
wng,g,nIn,m,n = 
g,g,m,n . (2.137)
For 2 2 body reactions, calculation of the intermediate g,g,n with proper treatment
of the delta function angular dependence is detailed in the report by Mori et al. [130].
For other reactions, such as the D(n,2n) reaction, the unit base transform is used to
allow smooth interpolation over non-rectangular double differential cross section data
tables  this method is detailed in the ENDF manual [175].
If the differential cross section depends on neutron direction, i.e. the target is non-
stationary, then the calculation cannot be separated. The ATP and differential cross
section should be calculated at the same time to avoid unnecessary numerical calcu-
lation. This is named the I-method as, rather than treating the scattering cosine as
an independent variable (like in the I*-method), it is directly linked to the kinematic
parameter 0. This means that I is calculated at the same time as the differential cross
section: 
wng,g,m,n,nIn,m,n =

The transfer cross sections can also be position dependent if fluid velocity and tem-
perature are spatially varying. This adds extra dimensionality to the transfer cross
section calculation which then dominates computing time. Appendix B.2 describes the
calculation of the transfer cross sections in detail.
To test the scattering operator in Minotaur, the constant isotropic elastic scattering
of a unit monoenergetic source, Q0(E) = (EE0), is considered. The energy spectrum
for the sth scattered flux can be calculated analytically by repeated operation of the
scattering kernel, this can be compared to the equivalent discrete form from Minotaur,

With the neutron transport numerics of Minotaur described, its practical application
to 1D radiation hydrodynamics simulation of ICF experiments will be given. For this we
will use a simulation of N130927 performed with Chimera [34]. Figure 2.18 shows the
hydrodynamic conditions at the time of peak neutron production (known as bang time).
This simulation will serve to show Minotaur can recover known neutron spectroscopic
signals. In Chapter 3, we show how Minotaur has been used to highlight novel neutron
spectral features.
The birth spectra of fusion neutrons for given plasma conditions were accurately cal-
culated by Appelbe [3, 5, 6] and are included in Minotaur. Alternatively the relativistic
Brysk [11, 23] spectrum can be used for the DT and DD reactions. This is less accurate
but provides an analytic form for the spectra and allows more direct comparison with
3D calculations which also use this form for expedience. The Brysk form has a Gaussian

Ballabio gives expressions for the mean, Eb, and variance, 
b , which will be given in Ap-
pendix B.1. Most notably the Brysk model cannot capture the high energy tail present
in the more accurate spectra. As most nuclear cross sections decrease with increasing
energy above 14 MeV, this high energy tail is not expected to have a significant effect
on the spectra at lower energies.
An example of the full 1D neutron spectrum is given calculated from the hydrody-
namic simulation of N130927 in Fig. 2.19. The neutron spectrum shows several features
of interest; the DT and DD peaks occurring at  14 and 2.5 MeV respectively, the
backscatter edges either side of the DD peak and the spectrum down to 10 MeV which
is dominated by scattering from D and T. These 1D neutron transport calculations
give knowledge of the full detail of the spectrum for an unperturbed implosion. This
calculation was run with 64 angular (Legendre-Gauss) groups and 400 energy groups
which were clustered around spectral features of interest; 25 hydrodynamic time steps
surrounding bang time were summed to obtain the time integrated spectrum. The scat-
tering source term was iterated 4 times (therefore allowing quadruple scattering) before
the result had converged.
Below the DT peak and down to 10 MeV, the major contribution to the spectrum is
from scattering from deuterons and tritons. Scattering from the ablator and D(n,2n)
provide minor additions to this region. Multiple scattering from the fuel becomes in-

creasingly important at higher areal densities. Figure 2.20 illustrates the spectral con-
tribution of DT multiple scattering at a fuel R of 1 g/cm2. For fuel areal densities
relevant to current indirect drive ICF ( 1 g/cm2), the 1012 MeV spectrum is pre-
dominately from single scattering from DT. This leads to fitted relations between fuel
areal density and down scattered ratio (DSR) [56, 61]. The DSR is defined as the ratio
of neutron yields in spectral ranges [10 MeV, 12 MeV] and [13 MeV, 15 MeV]. This
can be related to the areal density in the single scatter and monoenergetic point source
approximation:
DSR =
Y1012
Y1315
E=14
R , (2.142)
where barred quantities are averaged over the fuel fractions. Negligible remaining ab-
lator contribution has been assumed, due to both the lower ablator areal density and
larger ion average mass. The DSR-R relationship can change due to capsule conditions
deviating from the simplifying assumptions. The most erroneous of these is the point
source approximation. An extended source will, on average, reduce the areal density
seen by scattering neutrons. Therefore R in Eq. 2.142 should be replaced with the
neutron averaged areal density, L < R. Based on the capsule model used, DSR-R
relations can be inferred from areal density scans in Minotaur. For two example cases, a
point source in a uniform sphere and an isobaric hotspot model [172], linear RDT-DSR
coefficients ( m/) of 21.0 and 19.4 were found. These are in agreement with others
in the literature [56, 61]. It is difficult to have a definitive RDT-DSR relationship
as it is dependent on hotspot-fuel configuration, remaining ablator percentage and DT
primary spectral shape. However realistic variation of capsule conditions in 1D do not
alter the linear RDT-DSR coefficients by more than  10 %. However, multidimen-
sional effects can be significant. This is to be expected as R becomes poorly defined
for large 2D/3D asymmetries.
Minotaur was adapted to perform fast ion transport in tandem with neutron trans-
port. Only unmagnetised problems can be considered due to the restriction of spherical
symmetry employed in Minotaur. Following Morel [128], the Fokker-Planck collision
operator (Eq. 2.104) can be recast in terms of angular flux, , and energy:
(1 2) + n(r)(E)
(r, ,E) = LFP + Sext.(r, ,E) , (2.143)
LFP =
1 2
 . (2.144)
As discussed in Section 2.2.2, slowing down is generally the dominant term for fast ions
and therefore we shall neglect angular deflection and parallel diffusion ( =  = 0). A
slight modification to the transport algorithm is required to include the Fokker-Planck
slowing down term. Using a simple upwind scheme, the transport equation of energy

subscripts i and t refer to the fast ion and target particle respectively, energies and
temperatures are in MeV and number densities in m3. This forms a matrix equation
with the diagonal and upper diagonal non-zero. The lowest energy sink group has a
boundary condition gg+1 = 0. At every spatial step this matrix equation is solved us-
ing LU decomposition with partial pivoting from Numerical Recipes [144]. This general
method allows easier extension to higher order differencing schemes and the inclusion of
the parallel diffusion term  the simple upwind scheme is positive definite but diffusive.
A test problem of a point (1 m radius) triton source in a 3 keV 50/50 DT plasma at
a ion number density of 1031 m3 is considered. The triton energy birth spectrum used
was consistent with the 3 keV ion temperature. Figure 2.21 shows the results of this
test which show good performance of the slowing algorithm, given its simplicity.

triton energies, the treatment of the sink group and the ray effects present
in discrete ordinates solutions of point source problems [107].
Minotaur can perform fast ion transport of alphas, deuterons and tritons with slowing

down. Including knock-on fast ion source terms from neutrons and alphas was a simple
extension of the scattering source term which exists in the neutron transport. Currently
no scattering term of the same species is implemented (e.g. the effect of large-angle
Coulomb scattering on the fast D and T populations). The neutrons produced by fast
D and T reactions are fed back into the neutron transport8. The results from Minotaurs
coupled neutron fast ion transport will be given in Section 3.3.
2.2.4 AKED
Numerical solution of neutron and fast ion transport in all of 6D phase space is a
leviathan computational task. In order to efficiently solve these problems, the region
of phase space explored must be restricted. Monte Carlo techniques statistically sam-
ple the space with many computational particles therefore estimating the underlying
distribution. These stochastic methods are inherently noisy and thus low probability
events experience large statistical error. Deterministic methods used in less dimensional
problems (such as discrete ordinates) typically do not scale well to 3D, so new schemes
are needed.
In this section, we present the code AKED9 which uses a novel inverse ray trace
method to perform neutron transport in 3D. This allows both neutron spectra and
images to be calculated at multiple detector locations. Fast ion transport is performed
with a more traditional Monte Carlo method as Larmor orbits cannot be handled by a
ray tracing method.
The inverse ray trace is based on a solution to the transport equation using the method
of characteristics. As only diagnostic signatures are of interest, only the neutrons which
will arrive at the detector are tracked. This greatly reduces the size of the calculation
making it tractable in 3D. The time independent form of the transport equation can be
rewritten in a line integral form [12]:
(~r, , E) =
(E)
dsn(~r  s)
S(~r  s, , E) ds ,
where S represents both the external and nuclear interaction source terms. Solving along
the detector line of sight, (~r, ) = (~rdet, det), now constitutes a single line integral if S
is known. In practice this integral tracks neutron paths from the detector plane back
through the simulation grid. The source and degree of attenuation is calculated for each
grid cell intersected. For a primary source, the source term is simply the reaction rate
in that grid cell. A scattering source is handled via an additional set of traces from
the intersected cell to all emitting cells above an emission power threshold. This is a

knock-on ions to even higher velocities. This DT fusion accelerator has an upper limit when
the energy taken away by the neutron in the knock-on event matches the energy gained in the DT
reaction. This occurs at a final neutron energy given by E = 4Q/5 and therefore 126 and 56 MeV
for D and T respectively.

for alpha particle transport. The name however has stuck and I hope it doesnt change.

considerably larger calculation than for the primary source. Since each ray from an
emitter to the scattering cell is independent, this calculation can be fully parallelised
(AKED uses the MPICH implementation of MPI). Generally only a limited scattered
energy range is of interest, allowing the calculation size to be reduced by considering
only a subset of rays for which the primary neutrons downscatter into the accepted
range. Figure 2.22 shows a diagram of the inverse ray trace method for primary and
scattered neutrons. The details of and the improvements to the numerical raytracing in
AKED will be given in Appendix B.3.

The source term for scattering is given by a more complex expression:

distance. The energy of the outgoing neutron is calculated using the elastic scattering
relation for a scattering cosine, 0 =   :

The monoenergetic approximation for the primary DT peak is poor if resolved neutron
spectra are desired. However, a multigroup method becomes computationally expensive
if fine energy resolution is required. Therefore a number of approximations are made to
improve the efficiency of the calculation while maintaining spectral detail. Motivated
by the success of the Brysk model[11, 23] (Eq. 2.141), we consider each neutron ray
to have a Gaussian energy distribution. By considering Gaussians, only three variables
are required to be transported along the rays: amplitude, mean and variance. The
neutron birth spectrum within each grid cells rest frame is indeed close to Gaussian
[132]. However transforming to the lab frame results in a loss of the Gaussian form of
Brysk. Noting that the fluid velocity is significantly lower than the neutron velocity,
the Gaussian form can be recovered via a first order binomial expansion in the ratio of
fluid to neutron velocity. If we consider the lab frame neutron velocity, ~vn, and emitter
fluid velocity, ~vf , with cosine f between them, then transforming to the rest frame
must give the Brysk neutron energy, Eb:

A similar simplification can be made for the Jacobian from rest to lab frames. The lab
frame neutron spectrum is then approximated by the following Gaussian form:
Qb(E) =
22b
(E  (Eb + E))
. (2.155)
The final primary spectrum constitutes a sum of these approximated Brysk spectra.
Although the individual spectra reaching the synthetic detector possess no higher cu-
mulants than variance, their sum will. Therefore, the moment analysis outlined by
Munro [131, 132] is still possible with some error introduced. Additionally, the Gaus-
sian form can be exploited when handling attenuation. Performing a piecewise linear
fit to the total cross section centred on the spectral mean simplifies the calculation of

, (2.157)
E = E  nLm2b , (2.158)
where nL is the line integrated number density of scatterers. Since m < 0 at 14 MeV,
the mean shift for primary DT neutrons is to higher energies. For scattering, the energy
dependence of the differential and absolute cross section is assumed constant about the
spectral mean. This allows the scattered spectrum mean and variance on the ray to be
simply related to the source mean and variance via a multiplicative factor, as given by
Eq. 2.151:

s =

where the mean and variance post scattering event are denoted Es and 
s respectively.
The energy reduction factor  can be modified to include the effect of scatterer fluid
velocity through classical kinematics. At the present time the effect of temperature on
scattering has not been included in AKED. In summary: the birth, attenuation and
scattering of neutrons can be performed by manipulation of the amplitude, mean and
variance of a Gaussian. This efficient treatment of the energy domain along with the
efficiency of the ray trace allows for calculation of primary and singly-scattered neutron
spectra from large ( 106 computational cells) 3D radhydro simulations.
Forming images involves summing over energy space and resolving the detector posi-
tion, in the opposite fashion to the spectra. Often images are taken in restricted energy
gates, e.g. 13 - 15 MeV and 6 - 12 MeV. These gates are sufficiently wide that many
of the effects needed to accurately describe the spectra are not required to form these
gated images e.g. the effects of fluid velocity on scattering. Therefore, images can be
calculated in a more computationally efficient manner. It is worth noting here that
since the 3D radhydro simulations are calculated on Cartesian grids at stagnation that
they suffer from grid imprint. This presents itself as distortions along the cardinal di-
rections of the simulation grid. A symptom of this is that images produced from these
simulations can appear boxy. Higher spatial resolution can mitigate the grid imprint
but at an increased computational cost.
Currently, only singly-scattered and un-scattered neutrons are included in the inverse
ray trace method. This approximation introduces significant error at lower neutron en-
ergies as the degree of multiple scattering increases. However, features at higher neutron
energies and distinct single scattering phenomena such as the backscatter edges can be

analysed within this approximation with appropriate background subtraction. Mino-
taur was used to benchmark the more approximate 3D ray trace calculations by ensuring
agreement on a symmetric implosion, see Fig. 2.23. For expedience the multiple and
ablator scattering and break-up reaction backgrounds are omitted in 3D calculations.
To estimate the error in AKED, Minotaur found at 1 g/cm2 the spectrum produced
within the single scatter approximation introduces fractional error < 30% above 10
MeV causing a 20% reduction in calculated DSR. These errors increase for larger areal
densities and decrease for lower.

hydrodynamic profiles. The equivalent calculation was performed in 1D in
Minotaur with only scattering from DT considered. Excellent agreement
between the codes is seen in the single scatter case (1S). The effect of double
scattering (2S) on the scattered spectrum is shown by the green line.
The inverse ray trace method can also be used to calculate the -ray signal made
by inelastic scattering of neutrons from carbon nuclei. This resembles the scattered
neutron calculation however the trace back to the detector tracks the 4.4 MeV -rays
rather than the scattered neutrons.
Fast ion transport in AKED is performed with a Monte Carlo method which uses the
framework outlined by Sherlock [159]. The Lorentz force is included and the equations
of motion are integrated using the standard Boris algorithm commonly used in particle-
in-cell simulations. Each Boris step is followed by the collisional processes, e.g. slowing

down, and calculation of produced beam-target spectra. Figure 2.13 showed some fast
ion trajectories calculated using this method. With a set of detector positions specified,
the beam-target spectra can be calculated directly from the differential cross section
in the T = 0, vf = 0 limit or interpolated from tables calculated at a range of beam
energies, plasma temperatures and fluid velocities [4].

Typically detailed analysis of neutron spectra in ICF experiments is limited to the DT
and DD peaks. In this chapter, we aim to extend spectral analysis to include features
in the scattered and high energy spectrum. This will introduce techniques which could
be utilised to increase our understanding of conditions within ICF experiments.
3.1 Backscatter Edge
As described in Section 2.2.1, DT fusion neutrons that undergo 180 elastic scatter from
ions lose the largest fraction of their energy possible for a single scattering event. This
produces a sharp edge in the neutron spectrum. For stationary target ions, the resultant
edge energy is dependent only on the ion mass and incoming neutron energy. However,
if the target ion has significant velocity (due to thermal or non-thermal motion) this
will affect the energy of the backscattering neutron1. Therefore the energy spectrum
of these backscattering neutrons can be related to the hydrodynamic conditions of the
ions from which the scattering occurred.
3.1.1 Backscatter Edge Spectral Shape
The scattering kinematics of neutrons are affected by the velocities of ions with which
they interact. In the general case, this is accounted for by a frame transformation from
the beam-target frame of the neutron and stationary ion to the lab frame in which the
ion is non-stationary. The backscattering geometry simplifies this transform greatly,
using the notation that primed quantities are pre-collision and unprimed post-collision:
1One can draw an analogy with VISAR, an interferometry technique which measures the velocity
of any reflector by reflecting a laser from its surface. In our case, neutrons backscatter from ions
therefore measuring the velocity of the scattering medium opposite the detector.

The pre-collision neutron velocity mean and variance are determined by hotspot con-
ditions [3, 5, 132]. The scattering medium conditions determine the pre-collision ion
velocity mean and variance. Any bulk motion will cause a shift in the edge position and
any variation in ion velocity, be it temperature or variance in fluid velocity, will create
a broadening of the edge. Hence an analogy can be drawn between the backscatter
edge moments and the moments of the primary DT fusion neutron peak. While the DT
peak moments are only sensitive to the burn-weighted properties of the hotspot, the
backscatter edge shape is also sensitive to the scattering rate weighted properties of the
scattering medium.
The form of the backscatter edge is found by evaluating the spectrum of singly collided
neutrons. This is given by the product of the uncollided or birth neutron flux, b, and
the nuclear interaction differential cross section of the background ions integrated over
all space, time, incoming neutron direction, , and energy, E:
I1s(E, ) =
b(~r, 
, E) , (3.2)
where di = nidV dt and ni is the number density of ions of species i. By assuming
energy separability, the birth neutron flux can be split into the spatial angular flux, b,
and a normalised birth energy spectrum, Qb. The resultant total spectrum of singly
interacting neutrons travelling in direction, , with energy, E, is then given by:
I1s(E, ) =
db(~r, 
, ) . (3.3)
As the densest regions of the capsule are situated outside the fusing plasma, the birth
energy spectra across these regions are well represented by the averaged spectrum,
supporting energy separability. Here we have also assumed no attenuation between
source and scattering site. Since the DT birth spectrum width is small compared to its
94 Chapter 3. Neutron Spectroscopy
mean, changes in spectral shape due to differential attenuation are small for typical ICF
conditions[132]. Figure 3.1 shows the change in DT primary mean, vn, and standard
deviation,
Var(vn), for density and temperature profiles taken from a LILAC[44]
simulation at bang time. The mean is very close to constant ( 1 % change) and the
standard deviation changes by only a few percent in the dense DT layer. This result
lends credence to the energy separability approximation used in the following analysis.

the dense DT layer, changes in the primary spectrum cumulants are minimal.
Here we will consider the scattering source term as we did in Section 2.2.1. However,
we will simplify the analysis by only considering backscatter events. For elastic collisions,
energy and momentum conservation requires that the outgoing neutron energy is directly
related to the pre-collision velocities and the scattering cosine,    = 0. For a single
ion velocity, the double differential cross section can therefore be written as[169]:
 (0  
) , (3.4a)
subscript c denote terms in the centre of mass frame,  is the lab frame scattering cosine
which satisfies the conservation requirements. By only considering the backscatter ge-
ometry, where 0 = 1, the neutron trajectory reduces to a single dimension and hence
only depends on the parallel component of the ion velocity, as seen in Eq. 3.1a. There-

If the fluid velocity and ion temperature at coordinate ~r are ~vf and Ti respectively, then
the Maxwellian, M(~r, v

note that the initial neutron direction has been set to satisfy the backscattering condi-
tion, i.e.  = . The birth neutron flux at position ~r in direction  can be found
via integration of the neutron production rate along chords. For a detector direction
det, Fig. 3.2 shows the geometry of the integral expression in Eq. 3.5a.

the volume dV neutrons are backscattering towards the detector along the
line of sight det. The flux of birth neutrons, b, reaching dV with energy
spectrum Qb are travelling along a chord in the direction det. The ions
in dV are assumed to have a Maxwellian distribution of velocities with fluid
velocity ~vf and temperature Ti.
Noting the separation of terms dependent on position and on neutron birth energy,
96 Chapter 3. Neutron Spectroscopy
the integral can be expressed as an integral over ion velocity of two collected expressions:
Ibs(E, ) = C

Where: C =

Qbs(v

,) , (3.5e)
where Yn is the birth neutron yield and m is the average ion mass in the scattering
medium.
Physically, P (v
i,) is the normalised distribution of ion velocities seen by backscat-
tering neutrons. This will change based on the hydrodynamic properties of the hotspot
and fuel shell. Since the probability of scattering is proportional to the ion number
density, P (v
i,) will be weighted more strongly towards the densest parts of the capsule.
Hence measurement of the spectral shape of the backscatter edge will allow inference
of the properties of the dense fuel. This distribution is converted to a backscatter edge
shape through the averaged differential cross section, Qbs. This term is determined by
the primary DT birth spectrum and the elastic scattering differential cross section.
In this work we will focus on the nT backscatter edge and hence the distribution of
triton velocities. The theory above is general and applies for elastic scattering from any
ion species. However, experimentally the nT edge is more accessible for current ICF
target designs, as it has the greatest signal to background. Extra value is gained from
the measurement of multiple backscatter edges. For example with both nT and nD edge
measurements, separation of thermal and non-thermal broadening effects is possible due
to the ion mass differences; a similar analysis exists for the DT and DD primary peaks
[61, 133].
The classical expressions given in Eq. 3.1 are approximately correct however relativis-
tic corrections are required in order to accurately find the position of the edge. This
is due to the relativistic velocities of the DT primary neutrons ( 0.17c). As shown
in Fig. 2.10, for a 14 MeV neutron backscattering off a stationary triton (Ai = 2.99...)
the classical and relativistic kinematic edges differ in energy by 20 keV, 3.483 MeV and
3.463 MeV respectively. Current nToF detectors have the energy resolution to detect
these differences [116]. In this section we have only considered pure backscatter events,
however scattering angles less than 180 must be considered in order to fully model the
scattered neutron spectrum. This will be addressed in Section 3.1.3.1.
3.1.2 Measuring Implosion Dynamics Near Stagnation
As the capsule starts to stagnate it consists of three distinct regions: hotspot, shocked
shell and free-falling shell [14]. The return shock acts as the boundary between the
subsonic shocked material, composed of both the hotspot and shocked shell, and the
3.1 Backscatter Edge 97
unshocked material, which is rapidly inflowing at the implosion velocity. The boundary
between the hotspot and shocked shell will be taken as the 1 keV ion temperature con-
tour in this work, although other definitions exist. Neutrons scatter within each of these
regions and the scattering kinematics will be influenced by the different hydrodynamic
properties. The relative fraction of areal density in each of these regions will determine
the proportion of scattering occurring. Here we will discuss the properties for implo-
sions with weak alpha-heating; they are still compressing during neutron production as
there is insufficient heating to sustain fusion reactions during re-expansion[174]. The
free-falling shell is cold ( 100 eV) and imploding at or close to the implosion velocity
( 300-500 km/s). The shocked shell is at a temperature of a few hundred eV and
moving at several tens of km/s. Conditions within the hotspot change rapidly with
radius; as the temperature drops with radius, the density rises and hence the scattering
neutrons are more sensitive to conditions towards the edge of the hotspot.
Of central importance to the backscatter edge shape is the distribution of ion velocities
seen by backscattering neutrons, P (v
i,). In the following analysis we will relate the
properties of this distribution to relevant hydrodynamic quantities. For a 1D spherical
profile, Eq. 3.5d can be evaluated as follows:
P (vi,) 
4r2dr ni(r, t)
d b(r, , t)M(r, , t) , (3.6a)
M(r, , t) =
2Ti(r, t)
i, + vf (r, t)
2Ti(r, t)
 , (3.6b)
b(r, , t) =
ds RDT
r2  2sr+ s2, t
, (3.6c)
RDT (r, t) = fDfTn
i (r, t)vDT (Ti(r, t)) , (3.6d)
where:  =   r , b(r, t) =
d b(r, , t) ,
where fD and fT are the number fraction of D and T, vDT is the DT reactivity[18] and
the total birth flux, b, has been defined here for later use. Using the above equations,
P (v
i,) can be calculated without the need for a neutron transport calculation. This
method also allows for the individual contributions from the hotspot, shocked and free-
falling shell to the shape of the backscatter edge to be examined separately. Within
this section, subscripts HS, SS and FS will denote hotspot, shocked and free-falling shell
respectively, total components will appear without a subscript.
By taking moments of Eq. 3.6a, expressions for the mean and variance, v and 2v, of
98 Chapter 3. Neutron Spectroscopy
P (v
i,) in terms of the appropriate average of hydrodynamic quantities are found:
v = vf , (3.7a)
2v =
 v2 , (3.7b)
Where: x =
4r2dr ni
d b x(r, , t)
dr 4r2nib
, (3.7c)
where Eq. 3.7c defines the scattering rate averaging used in Eqs. 3.7a and 3.7b for the
hydrodynamic quantities.
Thus, from measurements of the backscatter edge, inferred v and v values can be
interpreted in terms of the above scattering rate averaged hydrodynamic quantities. For
a neutron point source, the scattering rate average reduces to:
xp.s. =
dtdYn
dr nix(r,  = 1, t)
dtdYn
dr ni
, (3.8)
i.e. a burn weighted areal density average, hence the quantities in Eqs. 3.7a and 3.7b
can be approximated as such.
An extended neutron source reduces the contribution from the centre of the hotspot
and introduces angular dependence to the neutron flux altering the effects of fluid veloc-
ity to the moments. To illustrate the angular dependence effect, we will use the uniform
spherical source solution given in Eq. 2.131 (neglecting attenuation) to give average
neutron directions ( and 2) as a function of radius. These are shown in Fig. 3.3,
we also show the averages for an isobaric hotspot with a parabolic temperature profile
for comparison. We see that the angular averages monotonically increase the weighting
of fluid velocities at larger radii. Outside the emitting region, 2 tends to 2 as
the spread of neutron directions reduces. Given that  < 1, average fluid velocities
inferred from v will be underestimates.
A more detailed understanding of the information contained in the backscatter edge
can be found through analysis of radiation hydrodynamics simulations. In this work
we will focus on simulations of the single[154] and triple[69] picket direct drive designs
for OMEGA. These designs have been fielded experimentally and obtain high hotspot
pressures and neutron yields[70]. In particular the triple and single picket shots 87653
and 89224 will be considered. In addition to the pulse shape differences, 89224 is a faster
target (480 km/s compared to 390 km/s of 87653) leading to a higher burn-averaged ion
temperature (4.8 keV compared to 3.8 keV of 87653). The simulations were performed
by the 1D hydrodynamics code LILAC[44].
The triple picket design aims to minimize the shock preheating of the fuel and hence
achieve a low in-flight adiabat [155]. This allows a high peak density to be achieved in
the fuel shell at stagnation. Therefore an increased fraction of the neutrons will scatter
in the shell compared to the hotspot. The bangtime profiles for the LILAC simulation of
shot 87653 are shown in Fig. 3.4. See Fig. 3.5 for the bang time hydrodynamic conditions

radius, R, was set to enclose 90% of the neutron emission in the parabolic
temperature profile case.
for 89224 as calculated by LILAC, this shot will be discussed further in the following
paragraphs. Also shown is the angular integrated scattering rate, i.e. the averaging
used in calculating v and v. It follows the density profile closely outside the hotspot,
showing that an areal density average is a good approximation in this region. Com-
paring the scattering and burn rate it is clear that the primary and scattered neutrons
sample different regions. Nearly all primary neutrons are created in the hotspot and a
considerable fraction (> 50%) of neutrons scatter in the shell regions. Hence the scat-
tered neutron spectrum contains information of the hydrodynamic properties in regions
of the stagnated capsule that are inaccessable via primary neutron measurements.
The dynamics of the return shock is important in determining the conditions in the
shocked shell and hotspot. Figure 3.6 tracks the return shock and hotspot positions
during neutron production. The Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) shock conditions (given in
Eqs. 2.7 to 2.9) can be used to find the post-shock hydrodynamic properties given the
upstream conditions and shock velocity. As discussed earlier, the upstream or free-
falling shell has a fluid velocity close to the implosion velocity and a low temperature.
An approximate set of shock conditions in the lab frame can be obtained by assuming
the upstream pressure is negligible. We will relax this assumption later in this chapter
but here it allows us to find the basic physical relationships brought about by the return
shock:

3.1 Backscatter Edge 101
The post-shock fluid velocity and temperature are vf and T and the implosion and
shock velocity are vimp and vs. We have used the strong shock limit and a fully ionised
ideal gas equation of state. The neglected degeneracy corrections to the pressure are
< 10% at stagnation from LILAC simulations of the two shots considered. From these
equations we see that the post shock conditions are dependent on only the implosion
and shock velocities. If the conditions are uniform,  = 5/3, and the shock velocity is
negligible, we can manipulate these equations to find expressions for v and v for the
nT edge:
v = vf =
vimp , (3.11)
2v =

However, the hydrodynamic conditions vary spatially and temporally during neutron
production as can be seen in Figs. 3.4 and 3.6. The shock conditions therefore cannot
fully explain the scattering ion velocity distribution moments.

Given the capsule conditions throughout neutron production, calculation of P (v
and the resultant backscatter edge shape can be performed, see Fig. 3.7. The individual
contributions to P (v
i,) from the hotspot, shocked and free-falling shell as well as the
total mean and variance are given in Table 3.1. The positive v causes an upshift in the
102 Chapter 3. Neutron Spectroscopy
energy of the backscatter edge. The non-zero v causes an additional broadening of
the edge over the slight broadening due to the variance in the birth neutron energy.
The single picket design uses a pre-pulse designed to increase the adiabat to reduce
hydrodynamic instability growth [68]. A consequence of increased adiabat is reduced
shell compressibility and hence a lower peak density is achieved in the shell at stagnation.
Therefore an increased fraction of the neutrons will scatter in the hotspot compared to
the shell. The calculated P (v
i,) and backscatter edge shape for the LILAC simulation
of shot 89224 are shown in Fig. 3.8. The individual contributions to P (v
i,) from the
hotspot, shocked and free-falling shell as well as the total mean and variance are given
in Table 3.1.
From analysis of these two LILAC simulations some general remarks can be made
about the various contributions to v and v. Differences in these quantities can then
be attributed to the physical processes which govern the individual behaviour of the
hotspot, shocked and free-falling shell.

For v, it was seen that in both cases the subsonic velocities of the hotspot and shocked
shell are within 10 km/s of each other. The free-falling shell is considerably faster
therefore a return shock which is less far through the fuel at bang time will cause higher
v values. However generally . 20% neutrons scatter in this region so v is closer to the
velocity of the shocked fuel. Using the shocked and unshocked v values2 and Eq. 3.9, a
shock velocity can be calculated as follows:
vFS 
vSS . (3.13)
This gives 32 and 15 km/s, radially outward, shock velocities for 87653 and 89224
respectively. These are in agreement with the shock velocities in the hydrodynamics
2Remembering that a minus sign is needed when switching between v and fluid velocity.

simulations at bang time to within a factor of  2. As the shell implodes, it performs
mechanical (PdV) work on the hotspot. Loss mechanisms, such as radiative cooling,
must be balanced by compressive and alpha heating. Hence a high rate of mechanical
work at bang time indicates both low alpha heating and high losses. Using measurements
of hotspot pressure[32] and radius, v can be used to calculate the rate of PdV work
through an isobaric hotspot approximation:
Wmech = 4PHSR
HS v . (3.14)
The mechanical power was found to be 4.1 (3.8) and 6.2 (7.1) TW for 87653 and 89224
respectively, where bracketed terms are those calculated directly from the hydrodynam-
ics simulations without approximation. Hence by combining measurements from the
backscatter edge and current hotspot diagnostics, the work being done on the hotspot
by the imploding shell at bang time can be calculated.
For 2v, ion temperature is the dominant source of ion velocity variance in the hotspot,
whereas both temperature and fluid velocity variance are significant for the shell. This
leads to approximately 25% of the total 2v being due to fluid velocity variance. For
comparison, approximately 10% of the apparent ion temperature as measured by the
width of the primary DT peak[5, 11, 23, 132] is due to fluid velocity variance in these
simulations.
The scattering rate averaged temperature, Ti, depends on multiple factors within the
stagnating capsule. If the shell density is lower, i.e. higher stagnation adiabat, a larger
fraction of neutrons will scatter within the hotspot, increasing the Ti. Comparing the
triple and single picket simulations, we find scatter weighted adiabats of 7.5 and 11.0
respectively within the shocked shell. Similar fractional change is seen in the total 2v
for these simulations. Additionally if the temperature gradient at the edge of hotspot
is higher this will also cause an increase in the Ti of the fuel. While its difficult to
predict, with simple models, the temperature profile between hotspot and shocked shell,
the return shock heating of the shell is more easily described. Again, we invoke the RH
conditions using Eqs. 3.10 and 3.13:
mp (vFS  vSS)2 , (3.15)
from which we obtain shocked shell temperatures of 201 and 174 eV for 87653 and
89224 respectively, a factor of  3 underestimate. The assumption of negligible pre-
shock pressure is the likely cause for this. Considering an ideal gas with  = 5/3, we can
obtain a more general expression for the post-shock temperature if we do not invoke a
strong shock limit. To do this we will introduce the Mach number M , defined as follows:
M2  v
, (3.16)
where cs is the adiabatic sound speed. The pre-shock Mach number can be used to
3.1 Backscatter Edge 105

The strong shock limit is given by  . Unfortunately we now require the pre-shock
temperature in order to evaluate the post-shock temperature. From simulation, the
pre-shock Mach numbers are approximately 2.2 and 1.5 at bang time for 87653 and
89224 respectively. This predicts post-shock temperatures of 486 and 710 eV by using
the Ti of the pre-shock material (shown in Table 3.1 in the free-falling shell column
and corresponding Ti rows). The values obtained are generally in better agreement
with the Ti of the shocked shell from simulations, as shown in Table 3.1 in the shocked
shell column and corresponding Ti rows. The larger inaccuracy for 89224 is likely due
to the lower percentage of free-falling shell remaining during neutron production giving
a larger averaged pre-shock temperature, see Fig. 3.5.
Shock physics can explain the hydrodynamic conditions either side of the return
shock at any one instant. However, there are many processes occurring which are not
predicted purely through the RH conditions. These include subsonic time evolution;
spatial gradients in conditions pre- and post-shock; thermal conduction and mass abla-
tion. Therefore, deviations from pure shock predictions are expected  although these
predictions do provide good estimates and bounds on stagnation conditions.
The fluid velocity variance can be due to both variation in space and time. Using
the 87653 simulation, we will visualise the effect of fluid velocity variance on P (v
i,) by
neglecting the thermal velocity of the ions. Calculating P (v
i,) at bang time is used
to quantify the spatial contribution and the time-integrated calculation includes both
spatial and temporal components. The results are shown in Fig. 3.9. Several sources of
fluid velocity variance can be identified in both the time-resolved and time-integrated
results. A large source of spatial velocity variance is due to the fluid velocity jump
across the return shock, this appears as a double peaked P (v
i,). A less clear source of
variance is due to the range of scattering neutron directions due to the extended source.
This is especially clear in the hotspot, where 22 is the largest, see Fig. 3.3. The
time-integrated result shows much larger variance in scattering ion velocity due to fluid
velocity. This is due to deceleration of the scattering regions, on top of the spatial fluid
velocity variance apparent in the time-resolved case
Estimates of the fluid velocity variance can be found using simple models which de-
scribe the dominant processes affecting the fluid velocity. To first order, the temporal
variation is due to the average deceleration of the shell, a, throughout neutron pro-

where BW is the nuclear burn width and the velocity variance has been converted to

Spatial variations in fluid velocity in the shell are generally dominated by the differ-
ence in velocities across the return shock. This can be estimated by assuming the return
shock is approximately stationary in the lab frame and satisfies the strong shock con-
ditions. Defining the fraction of shocked areal density, sh, and the pre-shock velocity,
vimp:
Var (vf)s  300

The fraction of shocked areal density will depend on the position of the return shock
through the fuel and the pre-shock velocity is determined by the implosion velocity at
the beginning of the deceleration phase. The return shock position also affects v, which
can be approximated in a similar fashion:
v  4 3sh
vimp . (3.22)
3.1 Backscatter Edge 107
This approximation considers only the deceleration across the shock. Post-shock, the
fuel continues to compress and decelerate, leading to a lower average fluid velocity than
predicted by shock conditions.
A preliminary study using an ensemble of 100 LILAC simulations was made to further
investigate the trends shown for the selected shots 87653 and 89224. These were post-
processed to extract the scattering rate weighted ion velocity distributions. These were
split into contributions from hotspot, shocked and free-falling shell therefore yielding 11
values per simulation (scatter fraction, ion velocity mean and variance for each region
and the totals). It is worth noting that the total v and v are, by definition, related to
the components as follows:

various components indicates a more fundamental underlying relationship between the
values. There is certainly further analysis that could be performed to better understand
108 Chapter 3. Neutron Spectroscopy
the physical relations between the scattering ion cumulants. Simplified hydrodynamic
models, such as those described in Betti et al. [14] and Christopherson et al. [35],
could aid in this analysis. These include the hotspot, shocked shell and free-falling shell
components and capture the dynamics of the return shock. Alternatively, one could
extract more information from the LILAC ensemble such as the average shock speed,
shell deceleration and shock strength to relate with the scattering weighted quantities.
Understanding these physical relations will allow a physically motivated fitting model
to be constructed which goes beyond the empirical Gaussian approximation made for
the scattering ion velocity distribution.
3.1.3 Neutron Spectral Shape Model
Since the nD and nT backscatter edges occur at low neutron energies, there are multiple
sources of background. For the nT edge these include; TT primary neutrons, nD single
scattering, the D(n,2n) and T(n,2n) break up reactions and multiple scattering. Thus
a general model is required in order to evaluate the shape of the edge and backgrounds.
Due to the complexity of the backgrounds at lower neutron energies, ad-hoc models have
been opted for to fit the neutron background under the DD peak [74] and in previous
work on the nT edge [42]. However, for fitting backscatter edges, the background is
only constrained at lower energies after the edge, where no single scatter signal for that
ion species exists. Therefore, a more constraining ab-initio model is favoured to ensure
the spectral shape under the edge is physical.
While scattering from remaining carbon-based ablators in indirect drive experiments
can contribute  1% to the 10-12 MeV neutron spectrum[95], it has a much smaller
contribution at lower energies, see Fig. 2.19. DT fusion neutrons elastically scattering
once from carbon have a lower energy limit of 10 MeV due to carbons high mass,
Ai  12. The highest cross section inelastic scattering, which produces a 4.4 MeV
-ray, has a neutron lower energy limit of 6 MeV. Therefore ablator scattering can be
neglected in fitting the nT edge.
3.1.3.1 Integral Model
With knowledge of the differential cross sections of the various nuclear interactions, the
distribution of scattering ion velocities, and the birth neutron energy spectrum, the full
scattered neutron spectrum can be approximated. The same simplifying assumptions
used to obtain an expression for the spectral shape of the backscatter edge, Eq. 3.5a, can
be used for a general scattering angle for elastic scattering interactions. For complex
inelastic processes, such as the (n,2n) reactions, the effect of the ion velocity distribu-
tion has not been included. Since these reactions produce a broadband spectrum of
neutrons for every scattering angle, the relative effect of ion velocities on the spectral
shape is reduced. By assuming isotropy in areal density and birth spectrum, the single
3.1 Backscatter Edge 109
interaction components to the spectra are given by:
I1s(E) =
dvi,P (v
(E, vi,)Qb(E
) . (3.25)
Multiple interaction events can be treated in a similar fashion to the single interaction
terms, however the source term is no longer the birth neutrons and is instead replaced
by the scattered neutron source. In addition, the averaged ion velocity distribution seen
by neutrons undergoing multiple scatters will be different to the distribution seen by
singly scattered neutrons. As the scattering rate is  ni where  is the neutron flux
to be scattered, the difference between the spatial and angular distribution of the birth
and singly scattered neutron fluxes will alter the scattering rate weighted ion velocity
distribution. Here the zeroth order approximation of stationary ions will be used:
I2s(E) =
E, vi, = 0
I1s(E
) . (3.26)
The cross sections for the (n,2n) inelastic scattering processes rapidly decrease near
their threshold energies, see Fig. 2.6. Therefore double inelastic scattering events can
be neglected  a numerical analysis performed by Minotaur showed double inelastic
events are  103 of the scattered signal at OMEGA cyro areal densities. The various
components of the single and double scatter models are shown in Fig. 3.11a.
The primary TT neutrons contribute to the spectral background below 9 MeV. Using
the ratio of the DT and TT reactivities, the TT yield is calculated from the DT yield
and the inferred burn averaged ion temperature:
YTT =
fT fT  vTT (T DT )
fDfT  vDT (T DT )
YDT . (3.27)
The temperature dependent shape of the TT spectrum has been evaluated by Appelbe
[6] and hence can be included in the model with relative ease. The single scattering of
the TT neutrons is then evaluated in an identical manner to the single scattering of the
DT neutrons. Figure 3.11b shows a comparison of the single scatter model with and
without TT scattering against a Minotaur calculation.
The complete spectral model for the fitting of the backscatter edge includes the fol-
lowing contributions; single interactions (nT, nD, D(n,2n), T(n,2n)) of the DT and TT
neutrons including the effects of scattering ion velocities, double interactions of the DT
neutrons, and the uncollided TT neutrons. The model can be written as the following
fitting function:
Ibs(E) = A1sI1s(E, v,v) +A2sI2s(E, v,v) +ATT ITT (E) . (3.28)
The amplitudes will have the following dependencies: A1s  R, A2s  (R)2 and

functions of the cumulants of the scattering ion velocity distribution, P (v
i,). In order to
fit experimental data some functional form needs to be assumed for P (v
i,). A Gaussian
approximation has been shown to produce reasonable results on synthetic data[42], also
see Figs. 3.7 and 3.8. Figure 3.12 shows the various model components for various v and
v values within the single Gaussian model for P (v
i,). More complex models, such as
three Gaussians for the hotspot, shocked shell and free-falling shell respectively, could
be used to infer more information about the stagnated capsule but requires many free
parameters to be set.
Experimental measurements of the underlying spectral shapes and differential cross
sections have been made for a number of reactions included in this model: the nD
and nT single scattering at  14 MeV[55]; the TT primary spectrum [27] and the
D(n,2n) reaction at  14 MeV [52]. Theoretical models[33, 64] in agreement with these
measurements are then used to cover all neutron energies. For the T(n,2n) reaction,
limited neutronic experimental data are available and hence there is a larger uncertainty
in its spectral shape.
3.1.3.2 Synthetic Data Comparison
Synthetic neutron spectra, which include transport effects excluded from the simplified
spectral model (Eq. 3.28) can be produced based on hydrodynamic profiles. Compar-
isons between synthetic data and the model will serve as the first test towards experi-
mental viability of this model.
For the first case we will consider the LILAC simulation for the shot 87653, see
Figs. 3.4 and 3.7. This has a burn-averaged R of 218 mg/cm2 for which the attenuation
of the primary DT spectrum is < 2% and approximately 1% of scattered neutrons
undergo triple scattering. Hence many of the assumptions made are valid at this areal
density. The analysis of the edge was performed in a similar fashion to an experimental
analysis, although in energy rather than time-of-flight space. First, the primary DT
peak was fit in order to estimate the birth spectrum shape. Then non-linear least-
squares fitting of the spectrum is performed using the LevenbergMarquardt algorithm
on both sides of the nT edge (between 3 and 5 MeV), extending the range previously
used in Crilly et al.[42]. Using the P (v
i,) shown in Fig. 3.7, excellent agreement is seen
between the model and synthetic data with at most  0.5% deviation, the results are
shown in Fig. 3.13. Using the single Gaussian approximation for P (v
i,) showed at most
 1% deviation between model and synthetic data. This produced best fit values of v
and v of 72 and 214 km/s compared to the theoretical values of 75 and 229 km/s; the
discrepancies can be attributed in part to non-Gaussian components of P (v
i,).
The same analysis was followed for shot 89224, which has a burn-averaged R = 162
mg/cm2. The deviation between model and synthetic data was again  1%. The single
Gaussian model found best fit v and v values of 70 and 254 km/s compared to the
theoretical values of 69 and 274 km/s. Therefore the accuracy error introduced in v and
v by the approximations made is < 10%. At OMEGA the timing uncertainty in the

nToFs is  56 ps [116]. At 3.5 MeV this leads to neutron velocity (energy) uncertainty of
 3.5 km/s (1 keV). Given the results from synthetic data and experimental uncertainty,
analysis of experimental data for similar OMEGA shots can be carried out with the
model presented [117].
Higher areal densities will reduce the signal to background for the backscatter edge
as well as introduce additional backgrounds and non-negligible attenuation. To test the
validity of the assumptions made within the model, neutron spectra were calculated for
a set of scaled isobaric profiles with Rs of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 g/cm2. By scaling
self-similar profiles it is ensured that the averaged hydrodynamic properties, e.g. burn-
weighted ion temperature, of the DT fuel are unaltered between different areal densities.
A pressure of 100 Gbar, central temperature of 6 keV with a parabolic spatial profile
and shell temperature of 300 eV were used. Fits to the synthetic spectra are shown in
Fig. 3.14. Good agreement between the total model and the synthetic spectra is found
across the whole fitting range for all areal densities.
Agreement between the individual components of the fit (uncollided primary TT,
single and double scattering) and the equivalent neutron transport component gives
confidence that the underlying physical phenomena are well modelled. For R = 0.5
g/cm2, an average deviation of 14% is found between the amplitude of the single scatters
in the model and the equivalent neutron transport result. At higher areal densities,
triple scattering and differential attenuation cause increasing deviation between the
components of the model and synthetic spectra. Therefore interpretation of the various
amplitudes of the backgrounds, A1s, A2s and ATT , in the model as physical parameters
is lost. The complete model however still performs well as an ad-hoc fitting function
and measurement of v and v is possible at higher areal densities.
These results suggest that the model developed in this work could be used to fit
experimental spectra at 0.5 g/cm2 (DSR 2.5%) and potentially up to 0.75 g/cm2 (DSR

are relaxed. Inclusion of triple scattering and attenuation effects would allow access to
even higher areal densities with confidence in the physical basis of the ab-initio model.
3.1.4 Multidimensional Effects
Whilst the preceding analysis has focussed on 1D implosions, in reality ICF experiments
are subject to many instabilities and perturbations which preclude a spherical implosion.
The scattered neutron spectrum will still be affected by the velocity distribution of
the ions, however now different lines of sight will sample regions of the capsule with
different hydrodynamic conditions. Asymmetries in the measured v would indicate
asynchronous stagnation of the shell. Variation in v could be due to differences in the
shell deceleration[42] and/or angular variation in fuel temperatures.
A radiation-hydrodynamics simulation performed by the code Chimera[34, 174] will
be used here to illustrate how anisotropy in hydrodynamic conditions manifests within
the scattering ion velocity distribution. The time integrated spectrum from a capsule
implosion with a P1 asymmetry will be considered. The magnitude of the drive asym-
metry, 3% P1/P0, used in the Chimera simulation caused a 60% reduction in neutron
yield compared to the symmetric case and produced a 130 km/s neutron-averaged (see
Eq. 2.78) hotspot velocity. A 2D slice in the x-z plane of the simulation at bang time
is shown in Fig. 3.15. This presents a scenario where, when viewed along the +z axis
(denoted as +z line of sight), the detected primary neutrons are shifted up in energy,
114 Chapter 3. Neutron Spectroscopy
but the neutrons travelling towards the back of the capsule are down shifted. The
backscattered neutrons will then receive a positive energy shift from the fluid veloc-
ity of the shell. Hence the shifts from the hotspot and from the shell are oppositely
directed. When viewed along the opposite direction (z line of sight) both the shifts
act to increase the backscattering neutron energy, albeit with a different shell velocity
magnitude. Combining spectra from antipodal lines of sight will allow the calculation
of separate hotspot and shell velocities. The primary spectra measured constrain the
spectrum of neutrons arriving at the backscattering sites. As a result no additional
assumptions need to be made about the birth spectrum used to fit the edges.

The neutron transport was performed by AKED with the effects of fluid motion
turned on and off to provide a comparison. Ion temperature effects on scattering are
not included in AKED but will be discussed later in this section. Portions of the resulting
spectra are shown in Fig. 3.16. The bulk fluid motion has produced the expected shifts
of both primary and backscatter edge spectra. The Down Scattered Ratios (DSRs)
predict R = 0.77 and 0.30 g/cm2 along the +z and -z axes respectively. This areal
density difference is mirrored in the intensity of the backscatter edges showing the mode
1 asymmetry.

fitting model than the one given in Eq. 3.28. This more primitive model used a Gaussian
distribution of ion velocities, however the differential cross section was assumed isotropic
and an ad-hoc background model was used. The derivation and detail of the model will
be given in an Appendix C.2. The model was able to extract v and v values of 130/50
km/s and 40/90 km/s for the +/ z lines of sight respectively. The ad-hoc background
model was able to handle the areal density asymmetry present  the 1D model (Eq. 3.28)
relies on spherical symmetry so cannot be used in this case.
To link these 3D results with the 1D analysis presented in previous sections, Fig. 3.17
shows the scattering ion velocity distributions as seen by two antipodal detectors along
the axis of the P1 drive asymmetry. From the +z direction, a faster shell is observed as
this side of the capsule has been driven harder by the drive asymmetry. From the z
direction, a slower shell is observed as well as the presence of a free-falling shell com-
ponent. Averaged shell velocities, v, of 160 and 78 km/s from +z and z respectively.
This agrees with the projected fluid velocity seen by neutrons with scattering angles in
the range 180o10o calculated within the inverse ray trace of AKED. Asymmetry in
v will create anisotropy in work done causing ineffective conversion to internal energy
within the hotspot. This results in residual kinetic energy which is evident in this case
due to the large hotspot velocities. The lower v values obtained by fitting the spectra
(130 and 40 km/s) can be explained by the simplified nature of the fitting model. Due
to the assumption of isotropic centre of mass frame scattering, the fit becomes invalid at
energies above the edge where the scattering angles are less than 180o. Therefore larger
fluid velocities which create a greater shift in the kinematic edge are not well captured
within this approximation.
Extending beyond previous work by the inclusion of the thermal velocity of the ions,
2v values of 784 and 1591 eV were found from +z and z respectively. The scatter
weighted temperatures of 552 and 1110 eV reveal that the difference in 2v between
detectors is due to both differences in dense fuel temperatures as well as differential
deceleration of the shell. In summary, large anisotropy in both v and 2v were found
therefore demonstrating the backscatter edge measurement could assist in identifying
3D asymmetries in the dense fuel.
As seen in our P1 example, centre of mass motion of the hotspot occurs in asymmetric
implosions and causes the birth spectrum to be anisotropic[5, 75, 116, 132]. Backscat-
tered neutrons were initially moving in the opposite direction to the detector line of
sight. Hence knowledge of the reverse birth spectrum is required in order to analyse
the backscatter edge. In previous work [42], also presented above, this was resolved by
using antipodal detectors. However without this detector arrangement the reverse birth
spectrum can be approximated if the neutron averaged fluid velocity vector is measured.
This measurement is currently performed at the NIF[75] and OMEGA[116, 118] and re-
quires at least four neutron spectrometers. For the detector measuring the backscattered
neutron spectrum, a measurement of the apparent ion temperature is also required. Us-
ing the notation of Munro[132], the centroid and variance of the reverse birth spectrum

Var()b = + Var(~u)ijb,ib,j + ...  Var()d , (3.29b)
where: b,i = d,i for backscatter.
Figure 3.18 shows the geometric interpretation of these relations. In the above approx-
imations higher order terms and the effect of scattering have been neglected. Absolute
errors in the inferred reverse birth spectrum have a reduced effect due to the mass dif-
ference between neutron and scattering ion, see Eq. 3.1 a-c. For example, errors in the
mean birth energy are reduced by a factor of 4 for the nT edge.
Similar to the measurement of hotspot velocity, mode 1 asymmetry of the fluid velocity
of the shell can be measured by 4 spectrometers if it is assumed to have the following
form:
~vshell = (~vasym  r + viso)r . (3.30)
The purely radial velocity is required so that the average angle between neutron and
fluid velocity is the same in every line of sight. Then 4 measurements of v can be
decomposed into viso and ~vasym. The isotropic component is compressive while the
asymmetric part is purely residual kinetic energy. The optimal detector arrangement
for this measurement is the same as for the hotspot velocity measurement. A brief
discussion of optimal detector arrangements is given in Appendix C.1.
Large areal density asymmetries present an issue for the spectral background model if
a broad energy range of the neutron spectrum is considered. Restricting to  3-5 MeV

reduces the scattering angle range for the elastic processes (nT and nD). The large
aspect ratio of hotspot size to shell thickness also acts to reduce the range of neutron
averaged areal densities seen[42]. For the (n,2n) reactions a single incoming neutron
energy and scattering angle produces a broad band of outgoing neutron energies. Hence
near the nT edge the (n,2n) background has been produced in all 4 of solid angle, thus
has a much weaker dependence on R asymmetries. Further development of the detailed
model to include the effect of strong R asymmetries is required. 3D measurements of
R from neutron spectrometers[95] or FNADs[15, 190, 191] could be used to inform this
analysis.
3.2 Downscattered Spectrum from Areal Density
Asymmetries
The degree of down scatter of DT fusion neutrons is often used as a measure of areal
density. This is done through a DSR measurement which is converted to an areal
density through a fit to 1D neutron spectra [56, 95]. To recap, the DSR is defined
as the ratio of neutron yields in ranges [10 MeV, 12 MeV] and [13 MeV, 15 MeV].
When considering 3D effects, the energy-angle relation for elastic scattering is a vital
reference. For stationary ions, incoming and outgoing neutron energies E and E are
related through the scattering cosine, 0, and ion-neutron mass ratio, Ai:
20 +A
i  1
Ai + 1
. (3.31)
3.2 Downscattered Spectrum from Areal Density Asymmetries 119
The areal density traversed by the downscattering neutrons is therefore at an angle to
the line of sight [95]. For a given energy range, this defines a cone of scattering over
which a neutron-averaged areal density is measured, see Fig. 3.19. The line of sight
areal density is only experienced by the un-scattered or low scattering angle neutrons.
This draws a distinction between areal density measurements from primary neutrons,
such as the FNADs, and scattered neutrons, such as the nTOFs. Energy gating and
spectra can use this geometric feature of elastic scattering to measure different spatial
regions of the implosion, this will be explored in Section 4.2.

Figure 3.19: Diagram showing two scattering cones for two different energy gates. Scale
of hotspot and cold fuel has been altered to emphasise the scattering cone
geometry. Due to an extended source there is overlap between the available
scattering regions. Higher energy scattered neutrons will sample regions at a
lower angle to the detector line of sight. The reverse is true for lower energy
scattered neutrons. For a 14 MeV neutron the scattering angles from D (T)
down to 10 and 12 MeV are 47.5o (59.5o) and 31.9o (39.5o) respectively.
Variations in plasma conditions may influence the slope of the scattered spectrum.
The shape of down scatter spectrum is set by the differential cross section, the energy
distribution of the scattering neutrons and the areal density of the scattering medium.
As the spectrum down to 10 MeV is dominated by elastic scattering from DT [42],
changes of spectral shape in this region could indicate fuel areal density asymmetry.
Reducing to the simplest case of a monoenergetic, E = E0, point source in an arbitrary
120 Chapter 3. Neutron Spectroscopy
single species density distribution, the singly scattered neutron spectrum is given by:
I1s(E, )  YnR
(0(E0, E)) , (3.32)
R =
dr (~r)( 0(E0, E)) , (3.33)
where the R integral defines the scattering cone for scattering cosine 0. Therefore,
with knowledge of the differential cross section, the azimuthally averaged areal density
at varying polar angles can be inferred. Multiple species, birth energy spectra and
spatial source distributions complicate the resulting downscattered spectrum, however
the underlying principle still holds.
To illustrate this effect with realistic source and areal density asymmetries, the neu-
tron spectrum for an implosion with a P2 drive asymmetry will be considered, see
Fig. 3.20. The magnitude of the drive asymmetry, 3% P2/P0, used in the Chimera sim-
ulation was such that the neutron yield was close to experimental values (3.19  1015
without alpha-heating). The positive P2 asymmetry created a larger R along the waist
compared to the poles. However, due to the hotspot being greatly distorted, the areal
density experienced on average by a neutron leaving the capsule differs significantly
from the R taken from the simulation centre point.

The areal densities used in descending order are the line of sight neutron-
averaged areal density, the inferred areal density from the DSR of the P2
simulation and an areal density chosen such that 1D spectrum matches that
P2 spectrum at 10 MeV. Inset is a zoomed in plot over the 10-13 MeV region.
122 Chapter 3. Neutron Spectroscopy
In order to infer the change in areal density with angle from neutron spectra, it was
assumed that the primary spectrum measured and the birth spectrum of neutrons to
be downscattered were the same. Thus by matching the measured primary spectrum, a
set of calculated 1D neutron spectra would match the downscattered spectrum from the
perturbed implosion when the areal densities were equal. Various 1D isobaric hotspot
simulations were performed where the temperature and velocities were tailored to fit
the Brysk cumulants of the primary spectrum from the P2 simulation. Due to the low
neutron-averaged areal densities, the single scatter approximation used in the neutron
transport is valid. For a detector viewing along the axis of symmetry, the large areal
density surplus at the waist is avoided by neutrons born in the polar jets which scatter
into the detector line of sight, c.f. solid blue line in Fig. 3.20. From the simulation data,
it is seen that, as the scattering angle is increased from 30o to 60o, the neutron-averaged
areal density along scattering paths decreases. Intuitively this will increase the slope
in the 10 - 12 MeV range of the spectrum. Figure 3.21 shows the resultant neutron
spectrum from the P2 simulation with a polar detector.
The P2 spectrum DSR infers a R = 0.57 g/cm2; this areal density represents the
weighted sum over all scattering paths exemplified by the solid blue line in Fig. 3.20.
The R along the detector direction was found to be 0.62 g/cm2. The 1D spectra with
these areal densities intersect the P2 spectrum at different energies, see Fig. 3.21. A
1D simulation with R = 0.525 g/cm2 intersects close to a neutron energy of 10 MeV.
This corresponds to a 15% change in R between the line of sight and the angular range
near 10 MeV. Minotaur was used to construct single-scattering R-DSR relationships
for the 1011, 1112 and 1213 MeV regions. Applying these to the P2 neutron spec-
trum, R10-11 = 0.56 g/cm
2, R11-12 = 0.58 g/cm
2 and R12-13 = 0.60 g/cm
2 were
calculated. The average angles in these ranges are 49, 41 and 31 respectively. These
were weighted by the differential cross section with the assumption of a 50:50 mixture
of DT.
In this way, spectra can be utilised to calculate the magnitude of neutron-averaged
areal density asymmetry. As each energy range includes integration over the hotspot
volume and scattering cone, the areal density from simulation centre is not accessible. At
bang time the centre point areal densities are 0.4 and 2.2 g/cm2 along the pole and across
the waist respectively. This asymmetry is significantly larger than that inferred from the
neutron spectrum. However, if a relatively spherical hotspot were to be surrounded by
an asymmetric dense fuel distribution, the effect on the downscattered spectrum would
be amplified. In experiments, the drive is often modified until the hotspot appears round
in imaging [157]  the downscatter slope analysis, amongst other techniques, could be
used to test whether the dense DT fuel layer is also round given the modified drive.
3.3 High Energy Neutrons
There are secondary and tertiary DT fusion reactions which can produce neutrons with
energies greater than the primary DT neutrons [10]. These involve the reaction of fast

ions with the thermal population therefore reaching suprathermal reaction energies.
The order, primary, secondary or tertiary, indicates how many interactions take place
in the fusion reaction chain. Figure 3.22 shows the series of reaction chains relevant for
DT fusion. The energies obtained can be calculated using the kinematic expressions
given in Section 2.2.1.

3.3.1 Secondary Reactions in Magnetised Spherical Implosions
In Magnetised Linear Inertial Fusion (MagLIF) the spectral shape of secondary DT
neutrons made in a magnetised DD plasma has been shown theoretically [7, 102] and
experimentally [156] to depend on magnetic field strength and topology. Future plans
to magnetise spherical implosions on the NIF require an assessment and measurement
of the magnetic flux compression possible. Measurement of the secondary neutron
spectra presents a possible mechanism for a direct magnetic field strength diagnostic.
However a low areal density R . 100 mg/cm2 target is required in order for the
triton stopping distance to be greater than the target size [147]. If this is not satisfied,
nearly all tritons thermalise within the fuel and Larmor orbits will not extend the path
lengths and hence will not increase the reaction probability of the tritons. Gas filled
exploding or compressing pusher capsules are viable choices to remain under this areal
density requirement while still producing large primary yields. The conditions from a
2D hydrodynamic simulation of a magnetised exploding pusher were used to set up a
suitable test problem. The secondary neutron spectra were calculated from the averaged
static hydrodynamic conditions at bang time with various burn widths enforced:
r = 300 m,  = 1000 kg/m
, Te = 5 keV, Ti = 10 keV, B = 2000 T .
The spectra along two of the NIF nToF lines of sight are shown in Fig. 3.23. The
magnetic field is orientated along the z-axis, (-) coordinates of (0-0), while Spec E and
124 Chapter 3. Neutron Spectroscopy
Spec NP are along (90-174) and (18-304) respectively. Magnetising the triton orbits is
seen to increase the secondary yield. This is because it extends the pathlength of tritons
within the fuel. This can be quantified by the triton path average areal density. For the
unmagnetised case R = 22.0 mg/cm2 and secondary yield ratio of 3.2  103 were
found  AKED and Minotaur agreed on these values to within a few percent. Magnetised
tritons with burn widths of 100 ps and 200 ps gave R = 29.0 and 34.3 mg/cm2, and
yield ratios of 4.7 and 7.0  103 respectively. It is worth noting that the unmagnetised
triton transit time across the fuel is 40-50 ps. The anisotropy in the spectra is due
to increased path length of tritons emitted perpendicular to the field relative to those
emitted parallel. Therefore, when observing the spectrum perpendicular to the field
there is a larger flux of tritons parallel and anti-parallel to the line of sight. Reaction
kinematics then leads to the observed double peaked spectrum. A similar reasoning can
be applied to the detector parallel to the field.

magnetising the fast triton orbits is to increase the secondary yield and to
introduce anisotropy to the neutron spectra. Two burn widths of 100 and
200 ps were considered to estimate the effect of time-dependent hydrody-
namic conditions. Also shown is the unmagnetised with a -33% P2 shape
asymmetry applied which mimics the spectral shape of the magnetised cases.
While the results are encouraging, the secondary spectrum can also show anisotropy
if an areal density asymmetry is present. For example, a negative P2 implosion3 will
create a similar spectral anisotropy as a magnetic field applied along the z-axis as shown
in Fig. 3.23. Imaging diagnostics could measure the shape asymmetry and its effect on
spectral anisotropy could be quantified. Finally the time-dependent case with realistic
drive asymmetries and perturbations needs to be considered  this will be the subject
of future work.

and pancake respectively. Other breakfast foods have yet to be utilised for other Legendre modes.
3.3 High Energy Neutrons 125
3.3.2 Alpha and Neutron Mediated Tertiaries
There is interest in both alpha and neutron mediated tertiaries as they could provide
additional measurements of capsule conditions. The tertiaries are very sensitive to areal
density (Yt  YpR2) and therefore measurable yields require cryogenic implosions with
DT ice layers. Work on the tertiaries has suggested that they are a possible test of
stopping power models in degenerate plasmas [77, 78] and activation measurements have
been performed at NIF [73]. These measurements used thulium activation diagnostics
which have a threshold energy of  16 MeV but the cross section rapidly grows up
to 20 MeV. Therefore the signal is dominated by knock-on ions and the high energy
neutron yield was found to  104 of the total yield. In future, this analysis could
proceed beyond a yield measurement to a spectral measurement in order to infer more
details of the reaction in-flight process. Towards this, high energy neutron spectra were
calculated using Minotaur for an OMEGA scale areal density. We will use a simple
isobaric model for hotspot [171] and fuel shell with a fixed total fuel areal density. The
ion and electron temperature have radial profiles given by:
T (r) =
Tc  (Tc  Ts)
r < R ,
Ts R < r < Rfuel .
(3.34)
The exponent q was varied and the effect on the resultant high energy neutron spectrum
was investigated. The resulting spectra for:
Tc = 6keV, Ts = 500eV, R = 250mg/cm
, R = 25m and Rfuel = 30m ,
with two q values (2 and 10) are shown in Fig. 3.24. It is seen that the flatter temperature
profile (q = 10) leads to a faster population of alphas. This is due to the reduced
stopping power at higher temperatures, see Fig. 2.12, meaning that the hotspot is more
transparent in this case. The deuterons and tritons are then knocked on to higher
energies. However, the cross section for large angle Coloumb scattering is inversely
proportional to the square of the projectile energy, therefore a faster alpha population
produces fewer total knock-on ions. This leads to the alpha-mediated tertiary neutrons
having a larger high energy component but a reduced total yield. The rapid increase
in density at the hotspot edge gives a small volume for slowing and scattering to occur.
The opposite is true in the more opaque (q = 2) case.
The neutron-mediated tertiary neutrons do not have such a sensitivity as the primary
DT neutrons are unaffected by plasma temperature in flight. Additionally, neutron scat-
tering can occur within the shell where alphas have been ranged out. The secondaries
are a  1 % contribution to the high energy spectra and therefore have negligible effect
to the spectral shape. This test case shows spectral sensitivity to capsule conditions
beyond yield and areal density. A future theoretical and computational investigation of
tertiary neutron spectra could reveal a useful diagnostic tool.

As discussed in the Introduction, purely spherical implosions give the most efficient
conversion of kinetic to internal energy. Neutron imaging gives spatial information of
both the hotspot and dense fuel. It is therefore essential for measuring deleterious
asymmetries in the implosion. In this chapter, we will assess the current analysis meth-
ods used in neutron imaging by using synthetic data from radiation hydrodynamics
simulations.
4.1 Primary Neutron Imaging
In this section, two nuclear diagnostics which measure the spatial distribution of the
primary DT neutrons are discussed. The first is traditional 2D imaging which measures
the spatially resolved distribution of the line-integrated DT fusion rate. The images are
used to measure the convergence and shape asymmetry of the implosion. Multiple 2D
images can be used to tomographically reconstruct the 3D emitting volume. The second
diagnostic considered is a system of activation measurements that create a 2D image
of the yield variation, as discussed in Section 1.3.1.3. While each activation sample
spatially and temporally integrates the incident neutron flux, multiple samples placed
over the sphere can resolve angular variation in the primary DT neutron yield.
4.1.1 2D Imaging
As discussed in Section 1.3.1.2, primary neutron images map out a set of line integrals
of T(D,n) reaction rate with an attenuation factor due to scattering and other interac-
tions. Scattered neutrons are lower in energy so are gated out for the primary neutron
images. Two important measurements extracted from primary images are the radius
and any distortion to the hotspot, as measured by the Legendre modes [72]. The radius
of the hotspot is used to measure compression through the convergence ratio. Shape
distortion is measured through the 17% contour. One might consider how attenuation
affects this analysis. The dense fuel shell is the densest region and hence causes a large
fraction of the attenuation. Due to the hotspot-shell configuration, the primary neutron
images will be limb darkened by this effect.

Figure 4.1: The primary image attenuation factor as a function of radius for a uniform
spherical DT shell of areal density 1 g/cm2 and thickness  surrounding a
hotspot of radius R
To quantify this we will consider a uniform spherical DT shell of areal density 1 g/cm2
and thickness  surrounding a hotspot of radius R. Figure 4.1 shows the attenuation
factor as a function of image radius for various shell-hotspot aspect ratios, /R. The
thinnest, i.e. the highest density, shells cause the strongest limb darkening. This may
lead to a small underestimate of the hotspot radius when analysing the 17% contour. For
a uniform source the limb darkening causes a shift in inferred hotspot radius from 0.985
R to 0.962 R for an aspect ratio of /R = 0.05. Therefore for symmetric implosions
the 17% contour is robust to attenuation effects.
We will now consider primary neutron images from 3D hydrodynamic simulations.
To do this we will utilise a simulation with many different wavelength perturbations1
performed with Chimera [181]  this simulation type will be referred to as multimode.
Figure 4.2 shows a density cross section at bang time and the time integrated primary
neutron image, including attenuation, as calculated by AKED. Experimental images are
also time integrated as the time-of-flight velocity dispersion effect is used to separate
out the neutrons by energy to form gated images.
Neglecting attenuation effects could cause misidentification of darker regions as re-
gions of low neutron production. However, the attenuation effect is likely to be marginal
similar to the symmetric limb darkening analysis. To remove the conflicting effect of
temporal blurring we will consider a time resolved image. This is shown for the multi-
mode simulation in Fig. 4.3. When imaged at 1m resolution, the level of attenuation
1The perturbations take the form of randomly seeded Rayleigh-Taylor velocity perturbations. These
are placed at the vertices of geodesic spheres in order to uniformly perturb the whole sphere. More
details can be found in thesis of Dr Taylor [171].

is observed to vary by at most 20% within the hotspot. The shape inferred via the
17% contour with attenuation effects on and off is within 2.5m at all points. At 5m
resolution, the variation in attenuation is reduced to below 13%. Thus the error induced
by neglecting attenuation in analysis of primary images is tolerable for high mode and
small amplitude low mode perturbations.
While shape analysis using the 17% contour can identify distortion of the hotspot
within a plane, this is not the complete picture. Since realistic capsule implosions
are perturbed in a 3D manner, ideally a 3D surface could be constructed to identify
3D asymmetries. However, due to the limited number of lines of sight, tomographic
reconstruction of the neutron production is challenging. Neglecting attenuation, the
problem is given by the matrix equation:
A  ~x = ~b , (4.1)
where ~x and ~b are the source and images arranged as vectors of length M and N (gen-
erally M > N). The N M matrix A gives the relative contribution of a source point
to an image point. There are many tomographic methods for solving for the source,
~x. However, for many techniques poor results are expected if only a few images are
available. To illustrate the difficulty of this problem we will adopt a naive approach
and compute the (Moore-Penrose) pseudo-inverse of A via singular value decomposi-
tion (SVD). We will take 3 orthogonal images of the multimode simulation (neglecting
attenuation) and aim to reconstruct the 3D source. Figure 4.4 shows the results of the
SVD reconstruction.
Many artefacts exist in the reconstruction, most notably the cross pattern along the
detector directions. The total neutron yield has also been increased in the reconstruction
by 8%. In order to obtain more accurate and efficient results a different method must
be utilised. Sophisticated tomographic techniques for a small number lines of sight have
been developed by Volegov et al. to form a 3D reconstruction of the neutron reaction rate
[177179]. These tomographic techniques employ an iterative Generalized Expectation-
Maximization (or GEM) algorithm. These aim to maximise the log-likelihood with an
additional potential term which prevents large differences between adjacent cells [177].
By employing an isobaric hotspot approximation, these 3D reconstructions are being
used to infer burn averaged density and temperature profiles [48]. While shape analysis
through the 17% contour appears robust to attenuation effects, this may not apply to the
reconstructions. Further work to investigate these effects in reconstruction techniques
is required. Some results from the Volegov et al. reconstructions will be shown at the
end of Section 4.2 alongside density reconstructions from scattered neutron images.
4.1.2 4 Yield Variation
The FNADs measure the incident neutron fluence modulated by the activation cross
section which possesses an energy threshold [15, 190, 191]. This system is distributed
over 4 of solid angle and aims to capture the 3D nature of the areal density. Since the

132 Chapter 4. Neutron Imaging
neutron fluence is attenuated by areal density, variation in FNAD signal is correlated
with capsule areal density variations. The hotspot is generally extended and therefore
it is expected that the areal density variation inferred in this way is correlated with the
neutron-averaged areal density. Due to the energy dependence of the activation cross
section, the Doppler shifts induced by fluid velocity in the hotspot will also affect the
FNADs signal [15, 148]. Flows towards an activation sample will increase the signal
measured. In this work we will focus on the finite FNAD resolution due to the extended
source.
The hotspot and shell can become highly distorted, this can cause a chord from
an emitting cell to enter and exit the shell multiple times before exiting the capsule.
This geometrically complex (non-convex) system is difficult to analyse. We will make a
number of simplifying assumptions here to show the effect of an extended source. The
hotspot is taken as a uniform sphere of negligible density, the shell as a uniform shell
and perturbations as uniform increases in density on patches of the shell. This model is
therefore purely illustrative  the results of detailed numerical calculation will be given
later in this section. The loss of resolution induced by an extended source can be shown
by varying the hotspot radius. Figure 4.5 shows the test case geometry and the results
for two perturbation sizes.
Figure 4.5: (Left) The geometry of the FNAD test problem. The source region lies within
Rh, the shell starts at Rs = 1 and has thickness   Rs. The density
perturbation lies at polar angles less than p. Rays are traced from every
point in the source volume out at angle . (Centre) The average areal density
for cosp = 0.9 at various hotspot radii. (Right) The average areal density
for cosp = 0.5 at various hotspot radii.
The extended hotspot results deviate from the point source result quite strongly even
in the unperturbed region. This is because of the increased average chord length through
the shell. Additionally the perturbation is smoothed out considerably by the extended
source. From a geometric analysis, the last ray angle that intersects the perturbation
(using the angle definitions in Fig. 4.5) is given by:
sin ( p) =
. (4.2)
This sets the angular resolution for a given hotspot-shell radius ratio e.g. the apparent
perturbation width is increased by 30 for Rh/Rs = 0.5. There are many differences
between this simple model and realistic stagnation conditions. However, the same con-
4.1 Primary Neutron Imaging 133
clusions can be carried across. An extended hotspot has poorer angular resolution and
an increased average chord through the shell.
We will now consider a more accurate representation of the FNAD diagnostic by
post-processing a 3D hydrodynamics simulation. To form the synthetic 90Zr FNADs a
forward ray trace was performed from all the emitting cells along a detector direction
vector. A birth spectrum was created for each emitting cell based on the temperature
and fluid velocity. The areal density along the neutron path was used to attenuate the
number of neutrons measured. Using the 3D multimode simulation shown in Fig. 4.2,
5000 synthetic FNADs were distributed at uniform angular intervals over 4. The
resultant measurement is given in Fig. 4.6 a). A low mode (l,m  2) spherical harmonic
fit was performed on the 19 experimental FNAD locations [190, 191], shown as coloured
circles. This shows asymmetry in both the polar, l, modes and azimuthal, m, modes,
see Fig. 4.6 b).

neutron-averaged areal density and d) the line integrated density from the
simulation centre point weighted by the burn history. Figure a) marks the
angles of some lines of latitude and longitude for orientation. [17]
The degree of smoothing of high mode perturbations can be seen by comparing the
neutron-averaged areal density (Fig. 4.6c) and the line integrated density from the
simulation centre point weighted by the burn history (Fig. 4.6d). As expected, the
neutron-averaged areal density shows the same features as the FNAD map. However,
the map of centre point R weighted by the burn history is notably different. In the
134 Chapter 4. Neutron Imaging
R map, the high mode detail has been greatly smoothed and the magnitude of the
resulting low mode alias is lower. The extended nature of the hotspot means that the
bubbles and spikes seen clearly in the R map are sampled from multiple starting points.
Spikes surrounded by emitting material thus appear spatially larger. Also, when viewed
down the spike axis, the attenuation effect appears reduced due to emitting plasma
surrounding the spike. Hence high mode perturbations are not resolvable, no matter
the number of activation detectors, and the magnitude of the low mode sample of
these perturbations is lowered. Experimental FNADs sky-maps often exhibit modes
l,m  2 of similar or larger magnitude as those found in the multimode synthetic
data [15, 91]. In this multimode simulation a large polar spike produces a P1 signal
in the FNADs. Possible high mode detail missed by the FNADs would be visible in
well-resolved primary and scattered neutron images, e.g. Figs. 4.2 and 4.3. The neutron-
averaged fluid velocity inferred from the primary spectra (29 km/s) accounts for  25%
of the FNAD variation. This L=1 effect exacerbates the aliasing of the high mode
areal density variation, although correction of the fluid velocity effect is possible with
a spectroscopic hotspot velocity measurement[148]. Performing downscattered neutron
spectral measurements along the poles, the RDSR were found to be 0.71 and 0.81
g/cm2 respectively. These are consistent with the P1 measured in the FNADs. It
should be noted that the DSR measurement samples between  30  60 degrees away
from the detector axis.
4.2 Scattered Neutron Imaging
Scattered neutron images can be used to identify areas of increased density as this will
lead to increased scattering. However, these images contain information about both
the density and the neutron flux at the scattering site. Therefore additional analysis
is required to infer the scattering ion density. Fluence compensation is a technique,
developed by Casey et al. , which can be used to approximately decouple the primary
flux from scattered neutron images and therefore directly image the scatterer density
[25]. The technique involves using the primary image to infer the primary fluence at
the scattering locations.
Simplifying assumptions are needed to calculate the primary fluence from the primary
image. First, the primary neutron emission rate is assumed to be constant along the
line of sight2. Second, a single average scattering angle, s, is used. The average angle
depends on the energy gate, [Emin, Emax], used to form the scattered neutron image.
The scattered neutron spectrum within this energy gate can be used to compute s .
This is done by first calculating the angle of scattering of a 14 MeV neutron from the
2Technically, the neutron source is assumed to be separable along the line of sight direction, z, such
that S(x, y, z) = S(x, y)I(z). However this has the same effect as the constant along z assumption.

, (4.3)
where A is the average ion mass divided by the neutron mass. The scattering angle is
then averaged using the outgoing scattered neutron spectrum, Qs(E), as follows:
s =
 Emax
s(E)Qs(E)dE
 Emax
Qs(E)dE
. (4.4)
The primary fluence, i,j , is then found using s to calculate the 1/r

source and scattering site:
i,j =

rk,l,i,j =
(xi  xk)2 + (yj  yl)2
sin s
, (4.6)
where Si,j is the primary neutron image and the image coordinate distances are xi and
yj . Attenuation effects on the primary fluence calculation are neglected.
Dividing the scattered neutron image by the approximated primary fluence retrieves
the product of the areal density seen by these scattered neutrons and the differential
cross section. For a downscattered neutron image, DSni,j , the fluence compensated
image, Li,j , is given by [25]:
Li,j =
DSni,j
, (4.7)
where Ap is the image pixel size and mn is the neutron mass.
The simplifying assumptions of a single scattering angle and uniform brightness per
unit length appear restrictive and one would like to see the effects of these approxi-
mations. However, constructing a suitable test problem is tricky, as with all scattering
problems. As a test case, we will consider an unattenuated monoenergetic spherical
neutron source and a spherically symmetric scattering medium with density ns(r). A
scattered neutron image is made at infinity with a radial coordinate s. This leads to a
scattered image per unit radius of the form:
Psn(s) =
2r2drns(r)

d(r, )
dI(, , )

where I is the angular transition probability (Eq. 2.134) and  is the angular neutron
flux. The Dirac- ensures that we move along the line of sight of the detector. Figure 4.7
shows the imaging and scattering geometry.

This integral becomes the forward Abel transform (in angular form) for constant 
and isotropic differential cross section. Unfortunately the differential cross section does
not have a simple analytic form therefore this integral must be integrated numerically
over all scattering angles. We can construct a simple numerical test to assess only the
uniform brightness per unit length approximation. This will be done by including the
single scattering angle approximation. The allowed scattering cosine, , will be varied
to observe its effect. We will use the bang time conditions of a 1D Chimera simulation of
the HDC shot n170601 to set our density and neutron flux. From this we can calculate
our primary and scattered images from Eq. 4.9 and then find our fluence compensated
image. The results of this test are shown in Fig. 4.8.
In this test, we see that the shape of the scattered images is very different between
isotropic and peaked differential cross sections. More forward directed scattering pro-
duces images of the front of the dense DT layer, while larger scattering angles highlight
the peripheries. This carries over into the fluence compensated images which become
more strongly peaked at larger radii for larger scattering angle. The fluence compen-

sated images deviate strongly from the line integrated density due to the scattering
geometry restriction. We can see that the assumption of uniform brightness per unit
length prevents us from recovering the underlying spherical density distribution. How-
ever, we can convert the scattered image into a, more physically useful, distribution of
areal density along the scattering paths. In Casey et al. [25], the average scattering
angle is taken as 45 for which the fluence compensated image is closest to matching
the position of peak L in this test case.
Typically, experimental images use an energy gate between 6 and 12 MeV to measure
the scattered neutron image. There are many contributions to this range beyond singly
scattered neutrons, see Fig. 2.19. Notably, the inelastic D(n,2n) process comprises a
significant portion of signal, reaching equality with the DT elastically scattered fraction
at  6 MeV, see Fig. 3.11. Multiple scattering also becomes important at higher areal
densities, see Fig. 2.20 for the contributions of double and triple scattering to the spec-
trum at 1 g/cm2. There are therefore multiple benefits to restricting the energy range
at the cost of reduced signal. Sources which are difficult to describe and analyse, such
as inelastic and multiple scattering, can be minimised. Also the range of allowed elastic
scattering angles is reduced, leading to a more directed measurement.
If the large range of scattered neutron energies was split into multiple energy gates
then different regions of the dense shell could be sampled, see Fig. 3.19. To illustrate
this technique we will consider a calculation where a single spike Rayleigh-Taylor[171]
velocity perturbation has been applied to an otherwise symmetric implosion at peak ve-
locity. The neutron transport calculation was carried out with AKED. At initialisation,
the maximal radial velocity of this spike was a factor of  2 times greater than in the

spike density and the shell density at higher angles, see Fig. 4.9. The time dispersion
of the neutrons would allow this technique to be applied along a single line of sight. By
viewing the spike along its axis, blurring due to radial motion is avoided in the time
integrated image. A time integrated scattered neutron image perpendicular to the spike
axis reproduces the shape of the perturbation. The 11.5-13 MeV image can be used to
estimate the areal density of the cold fuel spike and the preceding shell. Dividing out
by the differential cross section evaluated at the average angle of 30o, an areal density
of  2.0 g/cm2 was obtained. An areal density of 1.8 g/cm2 was found at bang time
directly from the Chimera simulation.
Working with the Neutron Imaging Group at LANL, synthetic primary and (6-12
MeV) scattered neutron images from the multimode simulation were used in tomo-
graphic reconstruction of the neutron production and density [179]. Using AKED,
time integrated images were taken along experimental NIS lines of sight to test and
benchmark the reconstruction technique for use with experimental data. To aid in the
comparison, the time integrated neutron production and density were calculated from
the hydrodynamic simulation. When integrating up the density, each time was weighted
by the total neutron production rate at that time to give the correct burn average. The
6-12 MeV window for the scattered images includes a much larger angular range (
30-100) than for the 10-13 MeV cases discussed above. This greatly increased the
computational expense of the calculation, and the efficient ray trace method was essen-
tial in making this task tractable. Figure 4.10 shows the results of the reconstruction.
Given this synthetic data test, the reconstruction technique has been used to analyse
experimental data.
The third line of sight on the NIS will soon be upgraded to measure a scattered neutron
image [179]. This will allow more accurate reconstruction of the density distribution.
The synthetic data analysis can then be revisited and the new scattered image line of
sight included. Carbon -ray images (see Section 5.1 for details) on the NIS lines of
sight were also calculated using AKED for the multimode simulation  these will be the
subject of future reconstruction work to measure the remaining ablator morphology.
4.3 Combined Imaging Analysis
Spectroscopic measurements regularly measure large hotspot velocities [75, 116, 148].
However, these measurements are unable to distinguish different spatial hydrodynamic
profiles if they have the same integrated flow velocities. In this section we will explore
two different perturbation types which can induce hotspot flows. We aim to answer the
question: can imaging techniques distinguish between the different perturbations when
the spectroscopic measurements cannot?
To do this we consider two scenarios: a P1 drive asymmetry and a more localised
reduction in the implosion velocity, which will be named an aneurysm perturbation
for reasons which will become clear. Both result in neutron spectroscopic measure-

3. Thus without additional information these scenarios are difficult to dis-
tinguish. However, they have very different hydrodynamic behaviour at stagnation.
The P1 exhibits bulk motion along the drive axis while maintaining a relatively round
hotspot. The shell is more strongly compressed on the side with harder drive. The
hotspot does not break out of the shell during neutron production. In contrast, the
aneurysm perturbation proceeds as a normal implosion with a localised region lagging
behind. Once the pressure in the hotspot builds up during stagnation, this localised
region has the lowest areal density and, consequently, is forced outwards. The hotspot
starts to flow out through this developing aneurysm leading to a measurable hotspot
velocity in neutron spectra. Therefore the different structures of the shell and hotspot
should present themselves in primary and fluence compensated images as shown in
Fig. 4.11.

image. Graphs c) and d) are the primary and fluence compensated neutron
images for the aneurysm case. The axis of the perturbation is along  = 80,
 = 30. The NIS polar and equatorial lines of sight were considered and
the line of sight which gave the best representation of the hotspot and shell
shape was used. Some slight Cartesian grid imprinting is visible but is small
compared to the perturbation size.
The P1 case shows a close-to round hotspot from the primary neutron image. Its cen-

troid is displaced from target chamber centre by  20 m. However, this displacement
would be difficult to detect with the NIS as the final neutron image is an average of
many images through many pinholes. The fluence compensated image reveals the areal
density asymmetry aligned with the drive asymmetry axis. The aneurysm case shows a
distorted hotspot with a teardrop shape due to the outflowing hotspot. The centroid
of the emission is very close to the centre. The nature of the perturbation means that
for most of the shell the implosion is unperturbed, this leads to a centred implosion.
This also shows up in the fluence compensated image which shows a small weak patch
in the shell through which the hotspot is flowing. The imaging resolution of the primary
and scattered neutron images are  10 m [176, 179]. This is sufficient to resolve the
differences visible in Fig. 4.11.
Similar analysis has been performed with X-ray images by Ruby et al. [152]. X-ray
images have the benefits of having better spatial resolution than neutron images and
being time resolved ( 100 ps), this allows a direct measurement of velocity. However, X-
ray images do not measure the same behaviour of the fusing material as neutron images,
even in the case of no mix. This is due to the different temperature dependencies of X-
ray emissivity and nuclear reactivity. Also mix induced by the fill tube or other defects
can dominate X-ray images. Then the dynamics of the mixed region rather than fusing
region are measured. X-rays images also cannot measure shell conditions. Therefore,
the correlation between hotspot flows and low areal density regions cannot be seen.
While these perturbations were applied in an idealised manner, the important dis-
tinction is their different extent: whole capsule (P1) vs localised (aneurysm). Potential
sources of these two cases are quite different due to this fact. The P1 asymmetry could
be caused by smooth top-bottom drive imbalance [114] while the aneurysm could be
caused by the growth of more localised defects. These could be dust on the capsule,
voids or grain boundaries in the ablator, the fill tube or stalk, surface roughness and the
capsule support tent. Many tailored experiments have been performed to observe the
growth of these perturbations as detailed within the comprehensive reviews by Smalyuk
et al. and the references therein [160, 161].

In indirect drive implosions there is remaining ablator at stagnation. This is to
prevent radiative heating of the dense DT shell which would limit compression. Most
of the shots on NIF to date have used an ablator containing carbon (CH, HDC). This
chapter is concerned with these shots, although the discussion of DT fusion  rays is
more general as it does not rely on a carbon-based ablator.
5.1 Imaging the Carbon Ablator via Inelastic Neutron
Scattering
Fine scale hydrodynamic mix between the ablator and fuel has been suggested as a
possible cause of lower than expected compressions as measured by the DSR [37]. While
this mix can not be resolved at stagnation, measurements of the reduced compression
of DT and carbon would lend credence to this hypothesis. The carbon  history, the
topic of the following section, can be used to measure the average ablator areal density
[30, 84, 121]. However this gives no information on the spatial distribution of ablator.
Imaging the carbon ablator through the 4.4 MeV -rays made in inelastic neutron
scattering could provide this information.
Much of the analysis applied to scattered neutron imaging can be equally applied to
carbon  imaging. One key difference is that the differential cross section for  emission
is symmetric and close to isotropic, with a P2 coefficient of  0.15 [64]. Within the
isotropic approximation, a carbon  image is given by:
I(x, y) =
C(~r)
dE (E)n(~r,E) , (5.1)
where n 
dn is the total flux of neutrons, C is the carbon density, mC the mass
of a carbon nuclei and  is the inelastic scattering cross section. As the primary DT
neutron fluence is  100 times greater than at other neutron energies, we will neglect
other neutron energies and invoke energy separability:
I(x, y) 
C(~r)
n(~r)
dE (E)Qn(E) =
dz C(~r)n(~r) , (5.2)
144 Chapter 5. Gamma Ray Measurements
where  defines the average scattering cross section across the primary DT spectrum.
For a uniform isotropic neutron flux the images shows the carbon areal density along
chords. Since the carbon occupies the remaining ablator shell, we expect a limb bright-
ened image. This is due to the largest chord residing at the inner radius of a shell. In
more realistic scenarios, the total neutron flux, n, will highlight carbon closer to the
neutron source. Unlike scattered neutron images, the emission and scattering sources
are separated in carbon  imaging.
To show the effect of the neutron flux term we will consider a 1D hydrodynamic
simulation of the HDC implosion N170601. Figure 5.1 shows the density, the neutron
flux and their product at bang time. Also shown are the resultant carbon gamma images
with and without the neutron fluence term. The effect, while subtle, is to reduce the
effective emission with increasing distance from the hotspot.

using a forward Abel transform. The upper half (a) takes account of the
neutron flux and the lower half (b) assumes a uniform isotropic flux. Both

For this symmetric case it is clear that the inner radius of the ablator can be found
given sufficient spatial resolution. Decompression of the ablator would reduce the in-
tensity measured and increase the thickness of the ring seen in the image.
Perturbations within the ablator can seed or feed through to the fuel creating cold
fuel spikes [119]. If these ablator perturbations do not break out into the hotspot then
they will not create a measurable X-ray signal. It is therefore critical to image the shape
of the ablator near bang time to identify such perturbations. The remaining ablator
also provides areal density to maintain confinement. Thin regions in the ablator will
reduce confinement and allow early decompression.
The multimode simulation will be used as a case study for these potential further
uses of carbon  imaging. Figure 5.2 shows time integrated carbon  images at the
resolution of the simulation and with a 10 m Gaussian filter applied to mock up
potential experimental resolution. The third line of sight of NIS will soon be upgraded
5.1 Imaging the Carbon Ablator via Inelastic Neutron Scattering 145
to image the carbon  rays [179]. We will use the  10 m resolution reported for
the neutron imaging as an estimate for  imaging resolution [179]. The spikes created
by the perturbations and the blow-off region are clearly visible. Thin regions of the
ablator can also be seen. The presence of spikes still persists after the addition of a
10m Gaussian filter.

The fill tube has been experimentally observed to inject doped ablator into the
hotspot, which greatly increases X-ray emission [47, 185]. There has been detailed
simulation work aiming to capture the hydrodynamic behaviour of the fill tube induced
mix and the resulting diagnostic signatures [39, 46, 185]. One might wonder if carbon
 imaging may be able to contribute a direct nuclear measurement of the mixed carbon
to corroborate the X-ray images. To answer this question, we will be using the 3D
Chimera simulation of N161023, including the fill tube and 2D radiation drive asymme-
tries, performed by Dr Kris McGlinchey. Other synthetic nuclear measurements from
this simulation are reported in McGlinchey et al. [120]. Figure 5.3 shows equatorial
carbon- images perpendicular to the fill tube jet. At the resolution of the simulation
(2 m) the injected carbon due to the fill tube is visible in the image1. While the mass
of ablator mix induced by the fill tube is small (30 - 100 ng depending on ablator type
and fill tube size [185]), the carbon is injected into the hotspot and hence experiences a
very high neutron flux which increases its carbon--ray production. However, at a more
realistic resolution of 10 m the fill tube mix is washed out in the image. Interplay
1It is worth noting that the interface tracker used in the hydrodynamics of this simulation [136] prevents
movement of mix cells once they become a single isolated cell. Therefore we might expect the fill tube
mix to travel further into the hotspot in reality. This has the potential to increase its carbon--ray
signal due to the increased neutron fluence.
146 Chapter 5. Gamma Ray Measurements
between the radiation drive asymmetries (primarily P4) and the fill tube has caused
ablator decompression around the fill tube which is visible as reduced carbon--ray in-
tensity. This implosion is significantly less perturbed than the multimode simulation
and hence the -ray images more closely resembles the 1D result shown in Fig. 5.1.

visible in both cases.
From a computational model standpoint, the inverse ray trace has led to clear images
allowing physical interpretation. Due to the low cross section, previous Monte Carlo
-ray calculations have exhibited poor statistics leading to noisy images [20]. While this
could be remedied in future calculations, the inverse ray trace by construction produces
images at the resolution of the hydrodynamic grid.
5.2 Fusion and Carbon -ray Histories
DT fusion -rays can be used to track the progress of burn in time without complications
from additional interactions in flight to the detector. The Gamma Reaction History
(GRH) and Gas Cherenkov Detector (GCD) measure the burn history and extract the
bang time and burn width which correspond to the centroid and FWHM of the fusion
-ray production rate.
The measured burn widths are consistently higher than most simulations predict.
Through numerical investigation it is found that perturbations can both elongate or
truncate the burn depending on their nature [120]. Perturbations which introduce high
atomic number mix, such as the fill tube, tend to lower the burn duration by reducing
5.2 Fusion and Carbon -ray Histories 147
the effective size of the hotspot through radiative cooling. In contrast, asymmetric
implosions without mix tend to have longer burn widths. We will look at two types of
asymmetry: low mode drive asymmetry (P2 and P4) and the multimode perturbation
(which has been used multiple times within this thesis). The asynchronous convergence
of these implosions extends the time over which mechanical work is done on the hotspot,
see Fig. 5.4. We define a few timescales, beyond the burn width, to compare the different
simulations. First we define the stagnation time to be when the PdV work on the hotspot
goes to zero. The time difference between the stagnation time and bang time will be
denoted tstag. Secondly a PdV timescale is defined as the peak-to-trough PdV work
divided by the gradient of the PdV work at stagnation, this will be denoted tPdV .

Figure 5.4: The PdV work on the 1 keV hotspot for each simulation type are shown in
solid lines and in dashed lines are the normalised DT reaction rates. The
simulations are high foot implosions which are symmetric (P0), perturbed
with multimode (MM) or driven with radiation drive asymmetries (RA). Also
shown are the time difference between bang time and stagnation, tstag, and
the peak-to-trough PdV work, |PdV |, for the RA case.
To find correlations between the mechanical work and burn pulse, principal compo-
nent analysis (PCA) was utilised. This technique constructs the correlation matrix of
the data and performs an eigen-decomposition. However, rather than looking at the
directions (eigenvectors) with the highest variance within the data we will look for the
highly correlated data i.e. the directions with the lowest eigenvalues. The yield, burn
148 Chapter 5. Gamma Ray Measurements
width, tPdV and tstag were taken from 6 simulations (3 high foot and 3 HDC implo-
sions) and PCA was performed. For both the high foot and HDC design, symmetric,
low mode radiation asymmetries and multimode cases were considered. From PCA, it
was found that 99% of the data variance lay in the first two directions. Therefore the re-
maining two directions are highly correlated, potentially revealing physical connections
between the data coordinates. These two relationships are as follows:
tstag = ktPdV k = 0.882 , (5.3)
tburn = k1tPdV + k2Y
k1 = 1.548 ,
k2 = 1.204 ,
(5.4)
where x denotes the standardised quantity i.e. x = (x  x)/x where x and x are
the population mean and standard deviation of variable x. Firstly we find that the
timescale over which PdV work is done is directly proportional to the time difference
between bang time and stagnation. As the PdV work is a source of heating for the
hotspot, a slower rate will allow energy loss mechanisms, such as radiative losses, more
time leading to early burn truncation. Secondly we find the burn width is proportional to
a linear combination of yield and PdV work timescale. The dependence on yield, at first
counter intuitive, comes from the fact the two capsule designs used in the simulations are
different sizes. Purely from hydrodynamic scaling, the smaller capsules will give lower
yields, smaller hotspots and shorter burn durations. More interestingly, we see the
burn width is proportional to the PdV work timescale. If the hotspot is compressively
heated over a longer period this will extend the burn. The asynchronous stagnation
of perturbed implosions cause an increased tPdV . Therefore a possible explanation for
long experimental burn widths is that not all perturbation sources are accounted for in
simulations.
Detailed 3D high fidelity hydrodynamics simulations come closest to matching the ex-
perimental observables when all known perturbation modes are included [37]. An active
area of research in both indirect and direct drive is looking into 3D drive asymmetries
brought about by laser balance or target placement issues [63, 114, 137]. These drive
asymmetries may account for the difference in simulated and experimental burn widths.
From this investigation principal component analysis has proved itself a powerful tool
and it could be used in a combined analysis of different diagnostic measurements.
Using -ray energy gating, both the fusion and carbon -ray production rates have
been measured [30]. Neglecting the neutron time of flight between the source and the
ablator ( 1 ps), the instantaneous yield of carbon -rays for a spherical capsule is given
YC(t) =
4r2dr

dE (E)n(r, t, E) . (5.5)
Similar to the carbon  images, we will only consider the scattering of primary DT

neutrons and invoke energy separability:
YC(t) 
4r2dr
C(r)
n(r, t) . (5.6)
If the neutron source is a point source then n(r)  1/r2 and the yield is directly propor-
tional to the areal density. However, as with many examples in this work, the neutron
averaged areal density is not equal to the line integrated areal density. Introducing a
extended source flux factor, Fn(r, t)Yn(t)  4r2n(r, t), we arrive at:
YC(t) 
Yn(t)
drC(r)Fn(r, t) . (5.7)
For most analyses, Fn(r, t) is taken as 1 and the carbon  yield is directly proportional
to the product of the carbon areal density and neutron yield  this is known as the mo-
noenergetic instantaneous point source or MIPS model [84]. However, one can calculate
an approximate Fn(r, t) by assuming a uniform extended neutron source of radius R(t):
Fn(r, t) =
rR (r2 R2) ln
r +R
r2 R2
, (5.8)
Fn(r, t) lim
= 1, Fn(r, t) lim
. (5.9)
The function Fn quantifies the increase in flux due to the increased solid angle subtended
by the source at distance r, compared to a point source. This modifies the carbon 
yield formula given by Eq. 5.7 as follows:
YC(t) 
CL(t)  Yn(t), CR  CL 
CR . (5.10)
Therefore the carbon  yield can be increased due to the higher average chord length
through the ablator given by an extended source. Estimates of CR based on a point
source model will be too high by at most 50%.
Without significant alpha heating, the carbon areal density is still increasing through-
out the fusing period and peak compression is reached after bang time. Thus it is ex-
pected that the peak carbon  signal will be reached after bang time for a symmetric
case. Areal density asymmetries which disrupt the hotspot will alter both the fusion
and carbon -ray histories. As the time between peak neutron production and peak
areal density increases, an increasing delay between fusion and carbon -ray peaks will
be observed. With hotspot self-heating, thermonuclear burn can continue during re-
expansion [174] and therefore for these cases the carbon  peak will occur before bang
time. Time shifts between fusion and carbon  peaks have been observed experimentally
[122].
Figure 5.5 presents the -ray histories from the multimode case and the symmetric
simulation from which the multimode simulation was initialised. Both exclude alpha
heating. For the symmetric case, peak carbon  signal occurred  15 ps after bang
150 Chapter 5. Gamma Ray Measurements
time. The time difference between peak fusion and carbon  production was 30 ps
for the multimode case. Meaney et al. report average peak delays of  15 ps in
experiments at NIF [122]. As discussed earlier, the increased PdV work timescale leads
to an increased time delay between bang time and stagnation. Stagnation defined as
the zero of mechanical work on the hotspot should be well correlated with the peak
areal density. Therefore the larger time difference between peak fusion and carbon 
production in the multimode case is a direct result of the increased PdV work timescale
brought about by the perturbations. The symmetric case was also run with alpha
heating included and the carbon -ray signal peaks 10 ps before bang time. This
shows that burn had continued through re-expansion, a signature of robust ignition and
propagating burn, details of which can be found in Tong et al. [174].

more significant time shift in carbon  signal is observed. The fusion  signals

respective fusion  signals. The dashed line shows the evolution of the product

As shown in Eq. 5.10, the time evolution of the carbon  signal should be equal to

Yn  CR within a simplified point source model. This can easily be calculated for the
symmetric case and is displayed in the Fig. 5.5. We note a  10% discrepancy between
this simplified model and the carbon  yield calculated via the inverse ray trace method.
First we will consider the correction from an extended source. When the hotspot is
large compared to the thickness of remaining ablator then CL  3CR/2 (within
the uniform source model). This explains why the carbon  production is higher than
the simplified model prediction at early times. As the ratio of hotspot radius to ablator
thickness decreases CL  CR.
An additional effect not considered in Eq. 5.10 but included in the AKED calculation
is attenuation. Primary DT neutrons are scattered by the fuel and ablator altering
their energy and direction. This modified the total neutron flux seen by the ablator and
therefore alters the carbon  production rate. If we first ignore the scattered neutrons,
then attenuation just acts to dilute the neutron flux in the ablator. Therefore as the
areal density of the fuel increases as the capsule converges the degree of attenuation will
increase. This will act to reduce the carbon  yield relative to the unattenuated case.
This is indeed seen in the results. In reality a fraction of the neutrons scattered prior
to exiting the fuel will inelastically scatter off the ablator producing -rays which the
simulation does not account for. Hence the real signal is expected to lie between the
extremes of no attenuation with a point source, given by the areal density burn rate
product, and full attenuation with an extended source, given by the inverse ray trace
model.
6 Conclusions
6.1 Neutron Spectroscopy
In Section 3.1, the effect of ion velocities on the spectrum of backscattered neutron
energies was investigated theoretically and through numerical neutron transport calcu-
lations [42, 43]. The work in this thesis showed for the first time that the shape of the
backscatter edge is dependent on the scattering rate weighted ion velocity distribution.
Hydrodynamic conditions throughout the capsule dictate the form of this distribution
and hence these conditions can be inferred from spectroscopic analysis. The mean, v,
and variance, 2v, of the distribution are given by averaged fluid velocity and the sum
of the averaged temperature and fluid velocity variance respectively. Since the neutrons
scatter in dense DT fuel which has a low neutron and photon emittance, the backscatter
edge presents an avenue to probe regions of the stagnating capsule currently unmea-
sured. Diagnosing these conditions allows inference of hydrodynamic quantities relevant
to capsule performance. For example, from v the rate of mechanical work done on the
hotspot by the imploding shell during neutron production can be calculated. The v
value can be converted to an inferred scatter weighted temperature, with the effect
of fluid velocity variance included. Measurement of both the nD and nT edge would
allow separation of the thermal and non-thermal contributions to the variance in the
scattering ion velocity.
In order to fit the shape of nT backscatter edge, a spectral model for the background
was developed. This includes single and double scattering terms, and the attenuated
primary TT neutrons. The model was tested on synthetic data produced by the neutron
transport code Minotaur[42] and showed good agreement at current direct drive ICF
experimental areal densities. For LILAC simulations of the triple picket shot 87653
and the single picket shot 89224, the model and neutron transport result were within
1% of each other at all energies of the fitting region. Using a single Gaussian model
for the scattering ion velocity distribution, best fit values for v and v were all within
10% of theoretical values. Numerical results suggest that to analyse at areal densities
& 0.75 g/cm2 (DSR  3.8%) may require the inclusion of more spectral backgrounds
and attenuation effects. The cumulants for the scattering triton velocity distribution
were calculated for a large ensemble of 1D LILAC simulations. Large correlations were
observed between the cumulants of the hotspot, shocked shell and free-falling shell
indicating a more fundamental underlying relationship. For example, the total v was
seen to be strongly correlated with the hotspot areal density. Future work will aim to
construct a simple model which can explain these strong correlations. This will allow
6.1 Neutron Spectroscopy 153
more detailed information to be extracted from the backscatter edge measurements.
Analysis of experimental backscatter edge data would be possible using the same
forward fitting technique currently used for neutron time-of-flight spectra [74]. The nT
and nD edges occur in the vicinity of the DD peak so instrumental characterisation
at these energies would be mutually beneficial for these spectral signals. Analysis of
experimental nT backscatter edge data at OMEGA is in progress, for which the author
has provided analysis tools [117].
For 3D perturbed implosions different lines of sight would measure the conditions of
different regions of the capsule. Asymmetries in dense fuel conditions could therefore
be inferred. Four neutron spectrometers are sufficient to characterise the DT neutron
birth spectrum needed to analyse the edge. Future investigation is required for the
treatment of large areal density asymmetries in the detailed spectral model. However,
functional fits based on a simplified backscatter model including an ad-hoc background
were able to account for the areal density asymmetry. With the use of anti-podal
primary and nT edge spectral measurements, this model inferred birth spectral moments
and shell velocity means and variances for a P1 implosion. Differences between the anti-
podal edge measurements quantified the large residual kinetic energy and asymmetric
deceleration brought about by the P1 drive. The effect of temperature on scattering
was not included in this calculation but a separate analysis showed that asymmetry in
the scattered weighted temperature was present.
In Section 3.2, we showed that the DSR range in the spectrum can exhibit significant
slope changes in the presence of areal density asymmetries. By comparison to 1D spec-
tra, areal densities within different angular ranges were calculated for a P2 simulation.
Experimental spectral data measuring down to 10 MeV exists [74] and a comparison of
inferred areal densities, FNADs and neutron images would test the viability of this anal-
ysis. Measuring the primary spectrum, backscatter edges and DSR range, and hence
the inferred hotspot and shell velocities and areal density asymmetries, would allow for
a more complete description of low mode perturbations.
In Section 3.3.1, the viability of using the secondary DT spectrum in pre-magnetised
spherical implosions as a measure of fast ion magnetisation was explored. Conditions
for an exploding pusher target were considered in order to minimise the fuel areal
density, and hence minimise slowing of the fast tritons created in DD reactions. It was
shown for a 2 kT magnetic field that the magnetised triton paths created significant
asymmetry in the measured secondary DT spectrum. There was also an increase in
secondary DT yield. The level of asymmetry and yield increase was dependent on the
burn time, i.e. how long the stagnation conditions could survive. For 100 and 200 ps
burn durations the secondary DT yield increased by 1.5 and 2.2 times compared to the
unmagnetised case. These two timescales are approximately 2 and 4 times the triton
time of flight across the fuel. The anisotropy in the secondary neutron spectrum also
increased with increasing burn duration. However, an anisotropic spectrum can also be
obtained from shape asymmetry in the fuel. A 33% P2 shape asymmetry was shown to
give similar anisotropy in the secondary spectrum to the 100 ps magnetised burn case.
154 Chapter 6. Conclusions
There was not an associated increase in secondary DT yield for the unmagnetised P2
case. Secondary spectral signals indicating areal density asymmetry on unmagnetised
targets have been observed experimentally at NIF [106]. Therefore, it may be possible
to estimate the average magnetic field strength with measurements of secondary yield,
secondary spectra and X-ray imaging.
In Section 3.3.2, the spectrum of high energy neutrons created by tertiary DT reac-
tions was shown to be sensitive to the temperature and density profiles of the hotspot.
In particular, the alpha knock on component is dependent on the energy at which alpha
particles reach the dense DT fuel layer. The slowing of alphas is reduced if the hotspot
is more transparent. This increases the high energy yield of alpha-mediated tertiaries,
altering the neutron spectrum shape. One way in which to increase the hotspot trans-
parency is to flatten the temperature and density profile within the central hotspot.
The neutron-mediated tertiaries are less sensitive to this profile effect. Thus, the high
energy neutron spectra above  19 MeV become close to equal for different hotspot
profiles. The alpha-mediated tertiaries are of particular interest as they present a direct
measurement of alpha collisions, and hence alpha heating.
6.1.1 Future Work
The backscatter edge shape has been well described through the scattering rate weighted
ion velocity distribution. However, understanding of the various contributions to the
ion velocity distribution requires further work. The ensemble of LILAC simulations
revealed that the hotspot, shocked shell and free-falling shell contributions to the ve-
locity distribution are highly correlated. The return shock plays a key role in setting
the conditions in the hotspot and shocked shell. However, other processes are occurring
which prevent a purely static shock based analysis. A few possible examples are the
subsonic compression post-shock, thermal flux from the hotspot and the time evolution
of the shock and free-falling shell. A more fundamental understanding of the stagna-
tion process will greatly benefit the backscatter edge measurement. This will be gained
through numerical modelling and simplified analytic models.
The current spectral model for the backscatter edge cannot capture areal density
asymmetries without the inclusion of ad-hoc backgrounds. Therefore, further develop-
ment of the model is required. This will require the drawing of areal density asymmetry
data from other diagnostics to feed into the model. Separately, extension of the model
to higher areal densities will require additional considerations such as triple scattering.
A surrogate background model developed from a database of 1D neutron spectra may be
an efficient route to including the multiple backgrounds. This analysis will also benefit
the spectral slope analysis in the presence of areal density asymmetries.
While the static model discussed in 3.3.1 gives a good first estimate, the capability
to perform magnetised secondary spectra calculations in line with the hydrodynamics
is currently being developed and tested by Dr Brian Appelbe. This will allow the sec-
ondary spectral signals from hydrodynamic simulations of proposed magnetised target
6.2 Neutron Imaging 155
designs to be investigated.
Modelling of tertiary spectra is in its nascent stages and there are many avenues for
further work. Development of the codes used to model tertiaries will be discussed later
in Section 6.5. On the theoretical side, previous models for the tertiary spectrum were
local [77, 78]. However, results presented here show that profile effects modify the spec-
trum highlighting the non-local nature. Therefore, a simple theoretical model including
the finite range of alphas is required. Separately, the backscatter edge measurement
samples the same region as the neutron-mediated tertiaries. A combined analysis would
remove some of the unknowns present in the tertiary analysis. For example, the finite
temperature of the shell alters the stopping power of knocked on ions  the backscatter
edge could provide a measurement/constraint on this.
6.2 Neutron Imaging
Primary neutron imaging was investigated in Section 4.1.1. It has been shown that
spatially varying attenuation does not affect shape analysis using the 17% contour.
Since the 17% contour is the primary shape analysis method in use for neutron imaging,
this result ensures confidence in its interpretation. This was tested for both idealised
1D and perturbed 3D conditions. While the attenuation factor varied by a few tens
of percent over a few m for the 3D perturbed case, the contour position was moved
by only < 3 m. Three dimensional reconstruction techniques using multiple lines of
sight were tested on synthetic primary images. The technique developed by Volegov
et al. [177179] produced encouraging results on synthetic images created by AKED.
However, further analysis investigating the effects of differential attenuation is required.
In Section 4.1.2, the use of activation diagnostics to measure areal density asymme-
tries was shown to have limited resolution due to the extended hotspot. A simple test
case showed that the angular resolution () on areal density asymmetries is depen-
dent on the shell to hotspot radius ratio (Rs/Rh):   sin1 (Rh/Rs). Therefore, the
neutron-averaged areal density, as seen by the FNADs, will have less high mode content
than the centre-point areal density. For a multimode simulation, the high mode pertur-
bations were not resolvable by the FNADs due to the extended nature of the hotspot.
Hotspot velocity appears as an additional low mode signal, further reducing the ability
to measure high mode areal density variation. Theoretically, scattered neutron imaging
is better suited to resolve high mode areal density asymmetries. However, it is limited
by low image resolution in experiment.
In Section 4.2, it was shown that multiple energy-gated neutron images and the fluence
compensation technique allow a detailed description of shell conditions. Multiple energy
gates probe different angular ranges and hence localised features such as high mode
spikes and the tent scar can be isolated in this scheme. For a simulation with a single
spike perturbation, fluence compensated images faithfully recovered the areal density
conditions near bang time. Performing the gating on a single line of sight would allow
such features to be imaged with the same projection characteristics - this capability has
156 Chapter 6. Conclusions
already been proven with the 6-12 MeV and 13-17 MeV gates on one NIS line of sight.
The recent increase in neutron yields [50, 108] may allow for sufficient signal-to-noise
ratio in narrower energy gates. In collaboration with Volegov et al. [179], scattered
neutron images of the multimode simulation were used in a density reconstruction.
The perturbation structure and density values were in modest agreement, with the
reconstructed mass 20% lower than simulated [179]. These are encouraging results
given that only a single scattered neutron image was used in the reconstruction.
In Section 4.3, combined imaging and spectroscopic analysis has been shown to aid
in diagnosing different failure mechanisms and understanding the correlation between
hotspot flows, shell asymmetries and drive imbalances. The particular examples consid-
ered had very similar spectroscopic signals. However, primary and fluence compensated
imaging revealed that one was due to bulk motion of both shell and hotspot whilst the
other had a more localised out-flowing or aneurysm of the hotspot. Since the remedies
to these two failure mechanisms could be very different, it is important to differentiate
between them.
6.2.1 Future Work
We expect that reconstruction techniques will become more reliable as additional imag-
ing lines of sight are being constructed. The effect of an increased number of lines of
sight can be readily tested using synthetic data. While tomography potentially leaves
17% contour and fluence compensation 2D analysis behind, new metrics and analysis
of the reconstructed 3D volumes are required in order to compare prediction and ex-
periment. Separately, analysis involving multiple energy gates on a single line of sight
may allow more accurate inferred conditions without the assumptions and degeneracy
of tomographic techniques.
6.3 Gamma Ray Measurements
In Section 5.1, an investigation was carried out to produce simulated images of remain-
ing carbon-based ablator using the 4.4 MeV -ray produced by inelastic scattering of
primary DT neutrons. The third line of sight of NIS will soon be upgraded to image the
carbon  rays  the  10 m resolution reported for the neutron imaging [176, 179] was
used as an estimate for the  imaging resolution1. Carbon  imaging was shown to be an
effective method to image the ablator areal density for both spherical and asymmetric
implosions. The ablator features closest to the hotspot have an increased signal. This
allows the feed-through of ablator perturbations to hotspot and dense fuel morphology
to be investigated. For a multimode simulation, a spatial resolution of 10 m on a time
integrated image was sufficient to observe the perturbed structure. A simulation using
realistic perturbation sources [120] showed that low mode radiation drive asymmetries
1One of the main limiting factors on the neutron image resolution is the neutrons long mean free path

an issue which will persist with  imaging.
6.3 Gamma Ray Measurements 157
can be imaged and resolved at 10 m. However, the fine scale ablator mix induced by
the fill tube defect does not give a strong enough carbon  signal to overcome imaging
spatial resolution. A combination of high fidelity simulations, which accurately capture
mix dynamics [37], and synthetic carbon  images can be used in future to find the
required spatial resolution to resolve the fill tube mix.
In Section 5.2, the time series of DT fusion  production were analysed for a number
of radiation hydrodynamics simulations performed by Chimera. Comparison between
the PdV work performed on the hotspot and the burn history revealed some corre-
lations. The time between stagnation (PdV work = 0) and bang time was found to
be proportional to the timescale over which the PdV work was performed. In other
words, a rapid compression of the hotspot brought the stagnation and bang time closer.
This is intuitive as this gives loss mechanisms, such as radiative cooling, less time over
which to operate  the energy loss is therefore reduced. A second strong correlation
was found between the burn width, PdV work timescale and yield. The yield depen-
dence is purely from hydrodynamic scaling, as the smaller capsules will give lower yields,
smaller hotspots and shorter burn durations. The PdV work timescale sets the heating
rate of the hotspot. A prolonged heating rate will extend the burn time at the expense
of a lower peak fusion rate. Hydrodynamic simulations which under-predict the burn
width are likely missing perturbation sources which cause a more asynchronous stag-
nation. As understanding of the experiment has improved, additional perturbations
such as 3D drive asymmetries have been analysed. When included in simulation, these
perturbations generally bring the simulated and experimental burn widths into closer
agreement.
The time series of carbon -rays were also consider in Section 5.2. The carbon -ray
production rate is, to first order, proportional to the product of neutron yield and ablator
areal density. Comparison of time series of DT fusion and carbon -ray production
showed a delay between the peaks. The length of this delay changed depending on the
degree of burn truncation. Symmetric and multimode simulations showed 15 and 30 ps
delays respectively. Similar delays ( 15 ps) between fusion and carbon -ray peaks
have been systematically observed in experiments at NIF [122]. The simulation results
indicate that the delay between stagnation and bang time increases for asymmetric
implosions. The same conclusion was made independently from analysis of the fusion
-rays.
6.3.1 Future Work
In a similar fashion to the scattered neutron images, the carbon -ray images can
be used to reconstruct the remaining ablator density given a source distribution. The
images contain information of carbon distribution in all 4, unlike the restricted angular
range of the scattered neutron images. This makes the reconstruction easier as there
are no blind spots, but more degenerate as more solutions could create the observed
image. Synthetic data created using techniques described in this work could be used to
158 Chapter 6. Conclusions
determine if the current reconstruction techniques for scattered neutron images can be
applied to carbon -ray images without modification.
Recent experimental developments in the measurements of the DT fusion -ray histo-
ries has greatly increased the time resolution possible to 10 ps [66]. Features beyond
the centroid and width of the production rate can now be resolved. Therefore, a more
extensive simulation study of DT fusion -ray histories including higher moments (such
as skew and kurtosis) would allow more information to be inferred from experimental
measurements. Similarly features of the carbon -ray signal, such as the width, could
be explored to extract time resolved ablator density properties. Foremost, developing
analysis to extract the ablator areal density as a function of time using the fusion and
carbon -ray history.
6.4 Outlook
Diagnosing failure mechanisms in current ICF experiments is key in improving future
experimental performance. The list of potential sources of perturbations and asym-
metries is constantly evolving. Existing measurements can be used to identify and
remove/minimise these sources. However, these measurements do not give a com-
plete picture of the experiment and failure mechanisms can be missed or misidentified.
Novel measurements are vital in both constraining known mechanisms and revealing
new degradation sources. To date, the majority of measurements are focussed on the
conditions within the hotspot. This is due to its central importance in the hotspot
ignition scheme but also due to its high emittance of observable signals. The properties
of the dense DT fuel are relatively poorly measured, similarly for the remaining ablator
in indirect drive experiments. This is due to the low emittance of these regions. Instead
scattering measurements must be relied on, which currently are used to infer areal den-
sity [84, 95] but do not measure hydrodynamics conditions such as fluid velocity and
temperature. As preheating of the fuel and fuel-ablator mix are proposed as degradation
mechanisms [58], hotspot measurements cannot currently directly measure these effects.
Therefore, efforts towards increasing the capabilities of nuclear measurements, such as
the backscatter edge analysis, is required in order to better understand the dominant
degradation mechanisms at play.
Combining measurements allows more information to be extracted than analysis of
the measurements separately. In the field of ICF, a Bayesian analysis using multiple
measurements has been developed to infer stagnation conditions during Magnetic Lin-
ear Inertial Fusion (MagLIF) experiments at Z [103]. Integrating a similar framework
to spherical ICF experiments would allow assumptions used in analysis of individual
measurements to be relaxed. For example, the conversion of DSR to areal density is
found from 1D neutron transport calculations so cannot account for the effects of asym-
metries. By the inclusion of FNADS and neutron images, the fuel morphology could
be included in the DSR to areal density measurement. In recent years, Artificial Intel-
ligence (AI) techniques have started to enter the areas of ICF design and experiments.
6.4 Outlook 159
These generally involved design optimisation [70, 76] and/or calibrating simulation to
experimental data [58, 70, 87]. AI also has great potential in pure experimental data
analysis, for example genetic algorithms have been used in X-ray spectroscopy [67]. For
complex systems, it is often the case that it is difficult to construct a simple model to
solve the inverse problem [99]. However, it is possible to perform a large number of
calculations of the forward problem for various input conditions. Bayesian inference
(using Markov chain Monte Carlo or similar) presents a way to construct a method
which can use these forward calculations to fit experimental data and estimate with
uncertainties the input conditions. Doing large numbers of calculations of the forward
problem however can be prohibitively computationally expensive; in these situations
using a machine learned emulator can speed up calculations. This is relevant to many
of the nuclear measurements discussed in this thesis.
One of the primary aims of this research has been to expand the number of measurable
quantities in ICF experiments. However, measurements in ICF tend to be averaged in
some sense, usually temporal and/or spatial integration has been performed. Therefore
potentially vital information about the time evolution and spatial profiles is still missing.
For example, the burn-average ion temperature can be approximately measured but the
cooling rate of the hotspot cannot. A similar problem exists with lack of measurements
on spatial gradients. To access this information one needs to include higher order terms
in the current analysis or to combine diagnostic information. An example of the former is
to measure the kurtosis of the DT peak and therefore have a measurement of the variance
of the ion temperature, see Eq. 2.77. An example of the latter is the analysis proposed
and performed by Divol et al. [48] which uses primary neutron imaging tomography
and spectral analysis to reconstruct spatially resolved 3D ion temperature maps.
As experiments towards magnetised ICF on NIF start, the role of nuclear measure-
ments in diagnosing the effects of the magnetic fields needs to be investigated. In this
work we presented the use of secondary DT spectra in diagnosing magnetic fields in low
areal density targets. However, these techniques are not viable for high gain layered
implosions as the triton stopping distance becomes too short. Direct measurements of
the magnetic field strength with nuclear observables will become increasingly difficult.
Indirect measurements, such as increased temperature and change in capsule shape,
can be performed but will rely on some additional model to extract a magnetic field
strength.
The measurements presented in this thesis have been given in the context of ICF.
However, some of the techniques are applicable in other high energy density physics
experiments. These experiments commonly involve the shock compression of materials
to high densities. Ions and electrons can behave very differently at shock fronts and
therefore separate measurements of ionic and electronic conditions are valuable. As the
radiative properties are dominated by the electrons, it is often difficult to measure the
ionic contribution. Nuclear measurements can be used to focus on the ions. With the
use of an external neutron source, the backscatter edge could be used to infer velocities
and temperatures of the ions.
160 Chapter 6. Conclusions
Capsule implosions have been used to study nuclear fusion reactions at conditions
relevant to stellar and Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Nuclear measurements are relied on in
these cases to measure the yield and spectrum of fusion products [27, 28, 96, 193, 194].
ICF experiments also more accurately recreate the astrophysical environment in terms
of plasma conditions. In more traditional accelerator experiments, the target is cold
and hence has bound electron screening of the nucleus. Separately, the high neutron
flux environment of a DT capsule allows neutron-induced reactions to be studied. Light
nuclei provide a good test bed for fundamental nuclear theory. For example, accurate
modelling of nucleon-nucleon and 3-nucleon interactions is needed to gain agreement
with measurements of the D(n,2n)p reaction [52, 158]. Heavier nuclei (atomic mass >
56) are also of interest as their neutron-capture reactions have astrophysical relevance.
The slow (s) and rapid (r) neutron-capture processes account for all the neutron rich
heavy elements observed in the universe [9]. While directly measuring these processes
is extremely difficult due to their high temperature and number density requirements,
nuclear physics problems which affect these processes could be investigated using ICF
experiments [31]. One such effect is the thermal excitation of nuclear states altering the
neutron-capture cross section. This will require temperatures in the tens of keV range
[31]  this would be possible in the case of a strongly igniting DT capsule.
6.5 Future Work in Numerical Modelling
In order to continue using simulated data to inform experimental analysis, continued
development of simulation tools to improve accuracy is required. We will discuss two
facets of the ongoing research in numerical modelling of ICF implosions at Imperial Col-
lege. These are improvements to the calculation of radiative properties used in radhydro
simulations and the transport models used to post process the radhydro simulations to
calculate the nuclear observables.
6.5.1 Minotaur
While Minotaur is currently the most comprehensive code at Imperial College for pro-
ducing neutron spectra from 1D hydrodynamics simulations, there are several avenues
for further work. Currently, the computation time is dominated by the calculation of
transfer cross sections including the effects of fluid velocity and temperature. Either
some increase in efficiency of the calculation is needed or the creation of tables which
could be loaded to reduce run time. Since we are working with neutron energies much
higher than those of the scattering ions, some suitable expansion may allow an increased
efficiency. Alternatively, the scattering matrices are sparse, see Fig. 2.9, and therefore
the tables would be easily compressed. The inclusion of ion velocities to inelastic pro-
cesses is also currently neglected. Relativistic corrections have proved important in
matching physical neutron spectra and therefore should be an aim to include these in
Minotaur. Fast ion transport is in a less developed state than the neutron transport
6.5 Future Work in Numerical Modelling 161
in Minotaur. Given interesting preliminary results in high energy neutron spectra, see
Section 3.3, development of the fast ion transport would allow a wider range of re-
search paths. A key update would be to include stopping power models that can handle
partially degenerate and coupled plasmas. This would aid in modelling the tertiary
neutrons.
6.5.2 AKED
In order to make AKED efficient enough for 3D calculations, many simplifying steps
have been taken. An important new addition to AKED would be the inclusion of
inelastic scattering such as D(n,2n), allowing some accuracy to be recovered at lower
neutron energies. The ray trace algorithm also traces between cell centres, albeit with
some angular smoothing (see Appendix B.3), which can cause some grid effects. A sub-
grid or stochastic sampling of the starting and finishing points of a ray may be used to
eliminate this.
6.5.3 SpK
A proposed improvement to SpK is to implement and develop a model for IPD and
pressure ionisation which is self consistent i.e. the shift in continuum and loss of bound
states are calculated from the same model. This non-ideal plasma behaviour can be
formulated in terms of an interacting fluid description of structure factors and radial
distribution functions2. Work from Lin et al. [110] describes a method to calculate IPD
from the static structure factor. Work from Iglesias et al. [93] describes how to calculate
a microfields distribution from a radial distribution function. Combining these methods
within SpK with a interacting fluid model, such as hyper-netted chain or mean spherical
approximation, would be a step in the direction of self-consistent non-ideal behaviour.
2The radial distribution function, g(r) is related to the static structure factor, S(q), through a Fourier
transform, S(q) = 1 + nF(g).

A.1.1 Microfield Distribution
The microfields problem was originally approached by Holtsmark when considering the
distribution of gravitational forces acting on a particle due to all neighbouring particles.
The same analysis can be used in plasmas due to the same radial dependence of Newtons
law of gravitation and Coloumbs force law. Since many derivations in the literature aim
to provide a more general microfield distribution, the Holtsmark result is often quoted
without derivation. A detailed derivation will therefore be given here for reference.
We first assume that particles are uniformly distributed in space d3r, the distribution
of force, W (~F ), at the origin is then given by:
W (~F ) =
~Fi(~ri)
, (A.1)
where V is the volume of the space, ri is the position of the i-th particle and Fi is the
force due to the i-th particle. Using the Fourier transform identity:
(~x) =
(2)3
d3k exp
i~k  ~x
, (A.2)
we then arrive at:
W (~F ) =
(2)3
d3k exp

i~k 
~Fi(~ri)
, (A.3)
W (~F )  1
(2)3
d3k exp
i~k  ~F
T (~k) . (A.4)
Since the interparticle force only depends on the separation, T (~k) can be written as a
power of a single integral:
T (~k) =
i~k 
~Fi(~ri)
i~k  ~F (x)
. (A.5)
The common statistical mechanics trick of adding and subtracting 1 will then be used to
obtain a convergent result in the thermodynamic limit (N , V , n = N/V =

T (~k) =

i~k  ~F (x)
d3x n
1 exp
i~k  ~F (x)
T (~k) = exp
1 exp
i~k  ~F (x)
. (A.6)
If we now specify the form of the force as inverse square ~F = A~x/x3, then T (k) can be
found through integration:
1 exp
i~k  ~F (x)
x2  x
(2k|A|)3/2 ,
T (k) = exp
(2k|A|)3/2
. (A.7)
Using the isotropy of the system to integrate out the angular dimensions in k-space [21],
we define the probability of finding a field strength, F =
~F
P (F ) = 4F 2W (~F ) =
dk k sin(kF ) exp
]2/3)3/2
 . (A.8)
Finally the Holtsmark distribution is commonly written in terms of the reduced dimen-
sionless microfield parameter  = F/F0 and integration variable y = kF0:
PH() =
dy y sin(y) exp
, (A.9)
F0 = |A|
, (A.10)
where r0 is the interparticle separation and therefore F0 represents the force at the
interparticle separation. A plot of the functional forms of the Holtsmark distribution
and its cumulative are shown in Fig. A.1. The constant 2
2/5 = 1.002651... is often
dropped due to its proximity to 1.
The assumption of uniformly distributed particles used in deriving the Holtsmark
distribution is the same as an ideal gas approximation. In reality the repulsive forces
between charged particles reduce the probability of finding particles in close proxim-
ity. Therefore microfield distributions in real plasmas are more peaked at lower field
strengths. There are many models which aim to capture this behaviour [85] of which
APEX is a notable example [92, 93]. APEX calculates the microfield distribution based
on the pair correlation function, g(r), which can be calculated from statistical fluid
equations.

A.2 Scattering Kinematics
A.2.1 Beam Target Geometry
We will consider a general 2  2 body interaction for species i + j  k + l where
energy Q is released (negative Q gives absorbed energy). In the beam target (BT)
frame, species i is our beam and species j our target. We will solve for the properties
of species k without loss of generality. As with most kinematics problems, transforming
to the centre of mass (CoM) frame greatly simplifies the analysis, see Fig. A.2 for the
geometry of the two frames.
Beam Target Frame Centre of Mass Frame
Figure A.2: Diagram showing the 2 2 scattering geometry in the beam target and centre
of mass frames. Relevant velocities and angles are defined in the figure. Note
in the centre of mass frame that the target particle j is moving at the centre
of mass velocity as it is stationary in the lab frame.
Firstly we will consider the classical case (v  c and E = p2/2m), using energy and
166 Chapter A. Theory Appendices
momentum conservation in the CoM frame to solve for the energy of k:
Ec,i + Ec,j +Q = Ec,k + Ec,l , (A.11)
mi +mj = mk +ml , (A.12)
~pc,i = ~pc,j and ~pc,k = ~pc,l , (A.13)
Ec,k =
mlkmi
mkmij
, (A.14)
where we defined the reduced mass 1/mij = 1/mi + 1/mj and the total CoM energy
pre collision E = Ec,i + Ec,j =
Ec,i. From here we will derive the first mass
parameter, a, relating the BT and CoM frame energies:
~vcm =

~pi, (A.15)
Ec,i =
Ei, E
Ei , (A.16)
Ec,k =
mlkmij
Ei  a2Ei . (A.17)
Next we find the energy of the outgoing particle in the BT frame and along the way
define the second mass parameter, b. The outgoing energy is found as a function of
incoming energy and CoM scattering cosine:
v2i =
m2ijmk
m2jmi
Ei  b2Ei , (A.18)

this allows the slowing down kernel, g = c/Ek, to be found:
2abEi
((a+ b)2  (a b)2)Ei
Ek,max  Ek,min
. (A.21)
The maximum and minimum energy of the outgoing particle occur at c = +1 and
c = 1 respectively. Finally the BT frame scattering cosine, 0, is related to the
incoming and outgoing energies:
Ec,k =
mk(~vk  ~vcm)2 = Ek mk~vk  ~vcm + b2Ei , (A.22)
mk~vk  ~vcm = 2b
EkEi
0 = Ek + b
2Ei  a2Ei , (A.23)
0 =

Combining Eqs. A.20 and A.24 one can find a relationship between BT and CoM scat-

In the following sections pre collision motion of the target will be included and a
relativistic treatment of elastic scattering will be given.
A.2.2 Classical Lab Frame Scattering Kinematics
This section will use the notation and results outlined in the previous section, subscript
BT will be used to identify BT frame quantities.
In the lab frame, target species j is no longer stationary thus altering the velocity of
the CoM. Therefore, we must define additional angles between the projectile and target
in the problem:
  ~vi  ~vj

For the lab frame scattering cosine it is simpler to re-derive from energy and momentum
conservation in the lab frame than to transform the BT scattering cosine. We eliminate
species l from the conservation equations and rearrange for 0 to obtain:
0 = 
BT,0 +

BT,0 =
 (a2  b2)
. (A.32)
If we are considering reactions where species l and j are the same then the final term
in Eq. A.31 vanishes, e.g. for neutron scattering.

Finally the cross section must be altered to account for the change in flux due to the
change in relative velocity. The factor is introduced to the cross section so that the
collision operator is given by the product of the scattering kernel and lab frame incident
flux:

A.2.3 Relativistic Lab Frame Scattering Kinematics
Natural units (c = 1) will be used in the following section leading to following relativistic
definitions:

~p = M~ , (A.36)
M2 + p2 = M , (A.37)
K = E M = (  1)M , (A.38)
, (A.39)
where , ~p, M , ~, E, K and M denote the Lorentz factor, 3-momentum, rest mass,
velocity, energy, kinetic energy and invariant mass respectively.
Relativistic corrections to scattering kinematics are required to very accurately de-
scribe the post collision velocities at MeV particle kinetic energies. In particular, this
analysis will be of interest for the elastic scattering of DT fusion neutrons. We will
therefore focus on the kinematics of the incoming and outgoing neutron.
Similar to the analysis in the previous two sections, the quantities that will be required
for the scattering analysis are the scattering cosines, in the lab and centre of mass frames,
and the slowing downing kernel[169]. These are given by the following definitions:
  ~p
n  ~pn
pnpn
, c 
~p c,n  ~pc,n
p2c,n
, g 
 . (A.40)
As before, subscript c denotes centre of mass frame quantities, primed quantities are
pre-collision and unprimed quantities are post-collision. We also need to define the
various angles between neutron and ion:
  ~p
n  ~p i
,   ~pn  ~p
. (A.41)
We will proceed in this analysis by finding the properties of the centre of mass frame,

using the invariant mass to link to the lab frame:
~c =
~p n + ~p

p2c,n =

M2n , (A.43)
M2 = M2n +M

i  2pnpi , (A.44)
where c is the velocity of centre of mass frame and c is the equivalent Lorentz factor.
The lab and centre of mass frame 3-momenta can then be related via a Lorentz boost
of ~c:
~p c,n = ~p
c  1
~c  ~p n  cEn
~c , (A.45)
~pc,n = ~pn +

Combining the above equations and the energy-momentum conservation laws, the fol-
lowing expressions are found:

where Ai = Mi/Mn as before. We see that these equations reduce to the more familiar
classical expressions for n = 1. Of particular interest is the kinematic edge at 
 = 1,

pleasing final results. I imagine this is the kind of algebra a textbook might label as an exercise for
the reader.

The terms in the square brackets are the relativistic corrections to the backscatter edge
velocity and kinetic energy. For K n = 14 MeV, the incoming neutron Lorentz factor
n  1.015 leads to a correction factor of 0.993 (0.994) for D (T) backscatter giving
downshifts of a few tens of keV to the backscattered neutron.
A.3 Quantum Mechanical Scattering Problem
The aim of this appendix is to show how nuclear potentials are related to the differential
and total scattering cross sections. The basics of the quantum mechanical scattering
problem are laid out while hinting at the true complexity of the full analysis.
Spinless solutions, (~r), of the Schrodinger equation for a central potential V (r) can
be decomposed into spherical harmonics, Ylm(r), and the radial Schrodinger equation
formed:
(~r) =
ul(r)
Ylm(r) , (A.55)
+ 1 l(l + 1)
ul() = U()ul() , (A.56)
U() =
V (r)
, E =
,  = kr . (A.57)
In the absence of the potential, Eq. A.56 is the Ricatti-Bessel function which permits
solutions, jl() = jl() and nl() = nl() where jl and nl are the spherical Bessel
functions. Constructing a normalised linear combination using a mixing phase shift l:
ul() = cos ljl() + sin lnl() . (A.58)
As long as the potential decays sufficiently fast, solutions must asymptote to this free
particle solution.
Now if we consider the scattering problem, we have state of definite linear momentum
(i.e. plane wave) incident on the scattering potential. The probability of scattering into
a given solid angle is then found through the outgoing flux at a distance much larger
than the effective radius of the potential. The incoming plane wave solution can be
shown to be given by [13]:
~k~r =
(2l + 1)iljl(kr)Pl(cos ) ===
(2l + 1)il sin (kr  l/2)Pl(cos ) ,
(A.59)
A.3 Quantum Mechanical Scattering Problem 171
where Pl are the Legendre polynomials and  is the angle between ~k and ~r.
The total wavefunction must have the asymptotic form which satisfies the large r
radial Schrodinger equation given in Eq. A.58:
(~r) ===
Clm(cos ljl(kr) + sin lnl(kr))Ylm(r) , (A.60)
Clm sin (kr  l/2 + l)Ylm(r) . (A.61)
The naming of l as a phase shift is now clear, it is the phase difference between the
incident and scattered waves. The scattered wave is the difference between this total
wavefunction and the incident plane wave. By requiring that the scattered wave is
purely outgoing, the coefficients Clm can be solved for and the following partial wave
solution is found [13, 59]:
scat(~r) = (~r) ei
~k~r ===
(2l + 1)eil sin lPl(cos ) 
f() . (A.62)
Thus the differential and total cross section can be written in terms of the phase shifts,
l, introduced by the potential:
= |f()|2 =
(2l + 1)(2l + 1)ei(ll ) sin l sin lPlPl , (A.63)
(2l + 1) sin2 l . (A.64)
The partial-wave analysis gives an exact procedure to solve the scattering problem at all
energies. The phase shifts can be calculated for a specified V (r) or found by fitting to
experimental data. The former is done by invoking the continuity of the wavefunction,
ul(), at the potential radius R:
tan l = 
kRjl(kR) jl(kR)L
kRnl(kR) nl(kR)L
, L 
ul(k, r)
dul(k, r)
, (A.65)
here we have ignored spin which introduces a spin-orbit interaction term to the Hamil-
tonian. A more complex expression for f(, ) is needed with spin dependent phase
shifts JL [13]. Fitting experimental data is generally aided by the phenomenological
R-matrix analysis described in the following references [13, 45].
B Numerics Appendices
B.1 Primary Fusion Reactions Spectral Cumulants
This appendix will summarise the key results of the paper Relativisitic calculation of
fusion product spectra for thermonuclear plasmas by Ballabio et al.. The mean and
variance of the fusion product energy spectra are used within numerical calculations
within this thesis. Natural units (c = 1) will be used in this appendix.
First the reaction rate weighted average is defined as follows:
f(K, vcm) =
v2cmdvcmf(K, vcm)(K)A
v2cmdvcm(K)A
, (B.1)
A = exp
(m1 +m2)v

By expanding expressions for energy and momentum in terms of velocity, one can derive
expressions for the mean and variance of the outgoing particle.

where the coefficients  and  are functions of the particle masses only. We will use the
reaction notation 1 + 2  3 + 4, where 3 is the outgoing particle:

2 +m23 m24
2(m1 +m2)
m3, K =

The averages of K and v2cm can be readily calculated from the definition in Eq. B.1,
although the averages of v2cm have a particularly simple form:
v2ncm = (2n+ 1)
m1 +m2
. (B.6)
By noting the definition of the reactivity v (as shown in Eq. 2.72), the K averages
B.2 Transfer Cross Sections in Minotaur 173
can be shown to be given by [11]:
Kn = T 2Kn1 d
2 vKn1
. (B.7)
For DT and DD, Bosch and Hale [18] provide analytic formulae for the reactivity there-
fore allowing for analytic, albeit complex, expressions for the K averages.
These above expressions work for any 2  2 body thermonuclear reaction with mas-
sive reactants and products.
B.2 Transfer Cross Sections in Minotaur
In Minotaur differential cross sections dependent on material conditions, fluid velocity
and temperature, need to be integrated over to form transfer cross sections. This can
be a numerically intensive task so analytic expressions are sought for where possible.
For temperature alone, the cross section is of the form given in Eq. 2.91, which shall
be repeated here:
D(0, E,E
) , (B.8)
D(0, E,E
4T2

  E  E, 2  1
E + E  20
. (B.10)
As it is only a function of the scattering cosine, the I*-method can be used. Addition-
ally, the D function can be integrated analytically over 0 reducing calculation time
considerably. From Mathematica, the integral over 0 between 
0 and 
0 is given by:
 up0
D(0, E,E
)d0 =
||
1 + erf
2  ||
+||
2 + ||
)]up0
, (B.11)
where in the limit of T  0, the top-hat function between the beam-target kinematic
limits is retrieved. If we consider the typical ICF relevant conditions E/T  1, then
the second term can be neglected as (2 + ||)/ > 0 for all energies and angles so
the argument of the error function is far into the tail. The level of upscatter can be
calculated from D(0, E,E
) over the whole angular range, for E = 14 MeV and T = 10
keV it was found to be 0.07% and 0.08% for nD and nT respectively. Therefore upscatter
can be neglected at ICF relevant temperatures.
For fluid velocity alone, the cross section is of the form given in Eq. 2.95, which shall

be repeated here:

0 =

As it is a function of lab frame neutron directions, the expression for 0 must be inserted
into the angular transition probability before integration. The ATP can then be ana-
lytically integrated over  and then numerically integrated over the remaining degrees
of freedom [166]. The analytical integral over  between dw and up is performed in
the reduced variable y domain:

I(, , 0)d =

where we have completed the square in order to form the reduced variable y:

A = 1 2  (BT,0 +Ai)2 , (B.16)
B = 2(1 +Ai)(

 +A22i , (B.18)
, (B.19)
y(vi = 0) =
 BT,0
1 2
1 2BT,0
. (B.20)
The transfer cross section is then found from the product of the ATP, differential cross
section and Jacobian. This method was benchmarked at the backscatter edge by com-
paring numerical results to direct integration of the double differential cross section with
colinear ion and neutron velocities.
Finally if both temperature and fluid velocity are non-zero then the product I and D
must be integrated over. Unfortunately this must be done numerically over all degrees of
freedom. A Gaussian-Legendre adaptive Gaussian quadrature routine is used to ensure
converged results. Now that no analytic integration can be done, the singularities in
I(y) at y = 1 are problematic. The variable transform y = sin(x) removes these
B.3 Raytracing in AKED 175
singularities so integration is performed in the x-domain (
< x < 
I(, , 0)D(0, E
, E, , , Ei)d0 =
D(x[0, E
, E, , , Ei])dx , (B.21)
as D is strongly peaked the integration domain is split into 3, two regions either sides
of the peak and one that encloses the peak:
 xup
D(x)dx =
 xpeakNx
D(x)dx+
 xpeak+Nx

, 0 =

 = E  E  2
EEi

, (B.23)
E + E  20
. (B.24)
A value of N = 4 was chosen as this generally causes the integrated regions outside
the peak to be close to zero and thus quickly neglected by adaptive integration. If
the peak lay outside the integration region the limits and the number of regions was
altered appropriately. An approximate analytic method of calculating the integral in
the x-domain would greatly improve calculation time.
B.3 Raytracing in AKED
AKED performs raytracing and line integrals on 3D regular Cartesian grids. Efficient
algorithms are required to handle the large grid sizes and high number of rays needed
to perform scattering calculations. In this appendix we will discuss the raytracing
implemented in AKED, this has been improved compared to older versions of the code
[115]. These improvements were aimed to address the overall computational efficiency
of the code and grid-imprint effects.
B.3.1 Cardinal directions and grid rotations
We will refer to the basis vectors of the Cartesian grid as the cardinal directions. Ray
tracing along cardinal directions is trivial and the preferred method of calculation.
Line integrals are simply for-loop sums over the cardinal direction and their total path
length through the grid is the same. The grid can be reoriented via rotation followed
by interpolation, see Fig. B.1.
The cardinal directions can then be orientated with the imaging coordinates. While
some error is introduced during the interpolation this is compensated by the speed up
gained in ray tracing along the detector direction. Rays will not intersect grid cell edges
and imaging pixel coordinates match the data grid coordinates. There is potential to
domain split the grid and rays between processors as each ray needs only the information
in a single row of the grid. This has not been pursued as scattering breaks this simplicity

the detector and trilinear interpolation from the hydrodynamic simulation
grid is performed to fill in the new grid.
- however rotated domain splitting could be employed in problems without scattering
e.g. X-ray imaging/spectroscopy.
B.3.2 Non-cardinal directions
Scattering calculations must include rays travelling in non-cardinal directions in order
to fully explore the space. These rays cut through grid cells in chords with varying chord
length. However solving the line equation in each cell is relatively expensive. Since the
grids on which AKED works are regular the line equation needs only to be solved a
single time. Defining the line equation with the coordinate origin at the ray origin:
~r = p~ (B.25)
Where p is the path length travelled and ~ is the normalised ray direction. The distances
to the nearest cell boundaries in each cardinal direction can be found simply (pi = i/i)
for regular grid spacings i. The algorithm for the marching the rays is then:
 Find the path lengths, qi, required to move into the next grid cell in each direction
qi = p
i + nipi , (B.26)
B.3 Raytracing in AKED 177
where p0i are the path lengths to exit the initial starting cell as the origin may
not lie at a cell boundary. ni are the number of steps taken in each direction and
therefore all ni are initially 0.
 The smallest value of qi is found as this will give the smallest chord to move. Then
ni is incremented by 1 for the direction i corresponding to the smallest qi. The
path length taken in this step is qi,min  p. The grid coordinates of the ray can
also be incremented in a similar way to ni. In the special cases were 2 or 3 of
the qis are equal then the ray has reached a cell vertex and multiple ni must be
incremented.
 This procedure is repeated until the ray exits the grid
A schematic of this algorithm on a 2D grid is shown in Fig. B.2.
Figure B.2: Diagram showing a non-cardinal direction ray trace with the marching path
lengths pi shown. In this example the stepping order is (x, y, x, x, y, ...) with
path length values p = (p0x, p
x + px, p
x + 2px, p
y + py, ...)
The simplicity of the regular grid allows this efficient algorithm which leads to reduced
computation time spent in the ray trace.
B.3.3 Angular averaging
In a scattering calculation emitter and scatterer cells are paired up and a ray connecting
their centres is considered. For large separations, any small change in the ray direction
would disconnect the emitter and scatterer cell. Therefore a single ray along the line of
centres is a good approximation. However for emitters and scatterers in close proximity
this is not true. The line connecting any two points within the cells can vary from
the line of centres by a large degree. The magnitude of this effect will depend on the
178 Chapter B. Numerics Appendices
parameter a = R/ where R is the emitter-scatterer separation and  the grid cell
size. One could subdivide the cells N times and consider many rays for each sub-cell
pairing but this is computationally expensive (order N2). Instead a single ray will
be considered but with an approximate averaging of the scattering angle over many
ray directions. The weighting function W (s, a) is approximated by considering the
fractional illumination of a circle by another circle both with radius  and separated
by distance R. This configuration is shown in Fig. B.3 as well as angular definitions.
Figure B.3: Diagram showing the geometric system used to estimate the angular average
weighting function. Circle 1 (the emitter) uniformly illuminates circle 2 (the
scatterer), the area which is illuminated at chord angle  is given by A().
The scattering angle between scatterer-emitter-detector is given by s = 0+
where 0 is the scattering angle for the ray connecting grid cell centres.
The weighting function is taken as the normalised distribution of illuminated area:
W (s, a) =
A()
dA()
, (B.27)
W (s, a) =
dA()
(1 x)
2x x2 + arcsin(1 x) + 
, (B.28)
x = a sin() = a sin(s  0) . (B.29)
The maximum chord angle permitted is given by max = arcsin(2/a) and thus the
weighting function becomes more peaked as the emitter and scatterer draw further
apart. Hence at sufficient high a the angular averaging can be neglected, a limit of
B.3 Raytracing in AKED 179
a > 10 is used in AKED. While considerable simplification has been used to obtain
the weighting function, it is vast improvement over the single ray treatment. Due to
the cubic grid, connecting cell centres causes certain angles to be emphasized. This
causes peaks to appear in the scattered neutron spectrum - similar to Bragg diffraction
in crystals. The benefits of angular averaging are evident when comparing the scattered
neutron spectrum with and without the angular averaging as shown in Fig. B.4.

C Results Appendices
C.1 Optimal Neutron Spectrometer Arrangement
When measuring neutron spectra properties are resolved to the detector line of sight.
To measure the underlying properties, multiple measurements of their components must
be combined. There is therefore an optimal arrangement which minimises the error in
the combined measurement. To begin we will consider the measurement of a linear
combination of isotropic and vector properties. This is relevant for the centroid shift of
primary DT and DD peaks:
~m = A ~b , (C.1)


, (C.2)
where ~m is a vector of measured centroid shifts, A is the matrix of projections to detector
lines of sight and ~b is the vector containing the isotropic and vector components. With
4 unknowns, we need 4 detectors to fully determine the system. For 4 detectors, the
projection matrix is given by:

1 1x 
1 2x 
1 3x 
1 4x 

, (C.3)
sin(i) cos(i)
sin(i) sin(i)
cos(i)
 . (C.4)
Altering the detector arrangement changes the line of sight vectors i. The error in the
inferred vector ~b is given by:
= A1Var (~m)
. (C.5)
We will now assume that the spectrometers all have the same measurement error (m)
such that Var (~m) = 2mI, where I is the identity matrix. The determinant of covariance
matrix is a measure of the total uncertainty in the inferred quantities. Therefore we
C.1 Optimal Neutron Spectrometer Arrangement 181
must aim to minimise this. Using the properties of determinants:
Var
) =
, (C.6)
therefore we must aim to maximise the determinant of the projection matrix, A. Using
that the determinant of a 3x3 matrix with columns ~a, ~b and ~c is the signed volume of
the parallelepied, Vabc, defined by the vectors ~a, ~b and ~c:
|A| = V234  V134 + V124  V123 . (C.7)
Therefore we aim to maximise the volume enclosed by the line of sight vectors. For 4
detectors, this creates a tetrahedron with total volume V = |A| = 16/3
3. In this case,
the covariance matrix of ~b is given by:

1 0 0 0
0 3 0 0
0 0 3 0
0 0 0 3

Var
) =
2m =
. (C.8)
As we can see, the tetrahedral arrangement also ensures no covariance between inferred
quantities.
Now we consider the optimal detector arrangement if we have additional detectors (for
a total ofN) and therefore have an overdetermined system. Since we are overdetermined,
the normal equation must now be solved in order to minimise the least squares distance
to the data:
AT  ~m = ATA ~b , (C.9)
)1 AT  ~m = A+  ~m . (C.10)
The error propagation follows a similar format but with the pseudo inverse, A+, rather
than the square matrix inverse:
= A+Var (~m)
= 2mA
, (C.11)
Var
) = 2m
A+
)T  =
|ATA| . (C.12)
Since A is not square, the determinant cannot be split further. However, the square 4x4
ATA matrix has a simple form in terms of the detector lines of sight components:
ATA =
1 1   
~1 ~2   
1 ~1
1 ~2
 =


(C.13)
182 Chapter C. Results Appendices
The determinant of this matrix must again be maximised to minimise the inference
uncertainty. We also note that if we want no covariance between inferred quantities
then ATA must be diagonal. This requires that:
ix =
iy =
iz =
z = 0 . (C.14)
These above conditions are indeed satisfied by the tetrahedral arrangement for 4 spec-
trometers. For 5 detectors, the lines of sight which satisfy these conditions form a square
pyramid with ATA of:
ATA =

5 0 0 0
0 0 15
0 0 0 5

, Var

3 0 0 0
0 8 0 0
0 0 8 0
0 0 0 12

. (C.15)
Interestingly, while there are no covariances, the errors are not equal for each vector
component. The x and y components are treated equally, as the pyramid is rotationally
symmetric around z, however the z component has a larger error.
A similar analysis can be performed if measuring a symmetric matrix component,
this is relevant for the width of the primary DT and DD peaks. For each line of sight
k, the measured value is given by:
B  ~k , (C.16)
bxx bxy bxz
bxy byy byz
bxz byz bzz
 . (C.17)
Since B is a 3x3 symmetric matrix there are 6 unknowns and therefore at least 6
measurements are required. Any isotropic component can be added by addition to the
diagonal of B. Therefore the isotropic component cannot be separated from the matrix
component and the number of unknowns remains as 6. A more suitable form of the
above equation can be found if we can diagonalise B:
 ST D  S  ~k =
D  ~k , (C.18)
~ = S  ~ . (C.19)
The elements of D are the values which are measured along the principal axes of B.
In terms of inferred ion temperature, the largest and smallest values in D give the
maximum and minimum inferred temperatures. The projection matrix S projects the
line of sight vectors to the principal axes basis of B. Therefore ~ are the projected line
of sight vectors. In this form our 6 unknowns are split into 3 which form the elements of
D and 3 which rotate/reflect the line of sight basis into the principal axis basis through

orthonormal matrix S.
The error propagation analysis will be more complex in this case so will not be pursued
here.
C.2 Simplified Backscatter Edge Fitting Model
Early development of the theory of the backscatter edge spectral shape was reported in
the Crilly et al. [42]. At this time, an ad-hoc background model was invoked rather than
the physically based model shown in Section 3.1. The differential cross section of nT
was also assumed isotropic and therefore a very restrictive fitting range had to be used
to accommodate these assumptions. However this model does allow more freedom in
the shape of backgrounds and therefore is, currently, more successful when considering
spectra from implosions with large areal density asymmetries. However, despite the
differences, the progression from the model presented below and the model presented in
Section 3.1 is clear.
For elastic scattering with an isotropic centre-of-mass differential cross section and
stationary scatterer, the energy spectrum at the backscatter edge can be approximated

The backscatter energy reduction factor, , is given above for the case of negligible
fluid velocity of the scattering medium. The functional form of the integral can be
approximated for a Gaussian birth spectrum, Qb(E
), with a mean a and variance b2. If
the birth spectrum is strongly peaked (i.e. b  a) then the slowing down kernel [169],
g(E), can be expanded about a and the elastic scattering cross section taken as linear

There is no m contribution to the first order in b/a term due to cancellation in the
product of the cross section and slowing down kernel. These approximations allow the
integral to be performed analytically. To first order in b/a, this produces:

Hence information about the mean and variance of the birth spectrum are stored in the
form of the backscatter edge. Therefore, there is inherent slope to the edge shape even
for stationary scattering ions.
By using Minotaur, this fit was tested on spectra produced by an isobaric hotspot
model [172]. Figure C.1 shows the simulated nT edge and a best fit. The effect of
fluid and thermal velocities on the broadening on the birth spectra was included. The
effects of fluid and thermal velocities on the edge will be investigated in the following
discussion and therefore will be neglected here. A limited energy range around the
edge must be used for two reasons. Firstly, the assumption of isotropic centre-of-mass
frame scattering will affect the spectral shape above the edge, this will constrain the
upper limit of the fitting region. Secondly, using a small energy range will limit the
variation in the background sources; over this range they can assumed to be constant,
this will constrain the lower limit of the fitting region. For these conditions, it should
be noted that the background signal is relatively constant around the nT edge. The
fit was performed from 3.3 MeV up to the peak value of the backscatter edge. Fits
extended to higher energy and those which only included a limited section of the edge
performed poorly. In these scenarios, the height of the edge was poorly constrained
which had a knock on effect on the best fit mean and variance. Hence the fitting region
adopted extended from the peak of the edge down to  200 keV below the centre of
the edge. From the edge fit the mean and standard deviation of the birth spectrum
were calculated to be 14.03 and 0.145 respectively. The primary spectrum moments
gave values of 14.05 and 0.147, thus the fit produced good agreement. Since Minotaur
does not included the approximations used to obtain Eq. C.20, the good fit validates
the choices made.
Often significant fluid velocity, vf , is present in the scattering medium so it is required
to extend this spectral backscatter edge fit to moving scatterers. By considering only co-

linear collisions between neutrons and the scattering ions we can reformulate to include
fluid velocity effects through the energy reduction factor :
(vf 6= 0) =
A+ 1 2Avf/vn
, (C.21)
replacing (vf = 0) (vf ) in Eq. C.20 .
This will allow a single average shell velocity to be inferred by fitting the backscatter
edge. As an extension we will assume that scattering ion velocities sampled by the
backscattering neutrons are normally distributed with mean and variance: v and 2v.
We can see here the link with the more detailed analysis in terms of the scattering rate
weighted ion velocity distribution. This allows us to calculate the expected value of the
backscattered spectrum for a range of scattering ion velocities. The total backscatter
shape is simply the sum of edges shifted by variable scattering medium velocity. This
will cause an additional shift and smoothing of the resultant edge shape. Expanding

where 0 = (vf = 0). Comparing to Eq. C.20, we see the additional shape changes

Figure C.2: A comparison between models with and without the effect of the differen-
tial cross section included. The simple model replicates the more detailed
detailed model up to a certain point beyond which the shape of differen-
tial cross section alters the shape of the nT scattering signal drastically.
Therefore, simple model, if used, must consider only a very limited range
of energies.
A more sophisticated model which can handle both the areal density asymmetries and
the physical shape of the signal and background is required to replace the two models
considered in this work.
