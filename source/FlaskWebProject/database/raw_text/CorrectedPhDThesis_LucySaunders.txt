Abstract 
The technique of single crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction is applied in the study of solid state 
proton transfer processes in hydrogen bonded molecular complexes. Proton transfer processes are 
of interest where they are responsible for a number of physical and chemical properties within 
solid state functional materials; their study gives insight into the occurrence of such properties and 
where they may be targeted and tuned in future materials. The synchrotron X-ray diffraction 
technique has been trialled with respect to the potential it offers for high throughput capability for 
studying proton transfer processes as a function of an external stimulus or across a number of 
molecular systems.  
Chapter 1 contains a review of the literature of the hydrogen bond, including its role in crystal 
engineering and proton transfer effects. In Chapter 2, the theory behind the analytical techniques 
used in the study of hydrogen bonded molecular complexes, in which crystallographic methods are 
fundamental, are described. In Chapter 3 the research project aims and objectives are presented; 
these objectives are targeted at the use of single crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction in the study 
and rationalisation of solid state proton transfer processes. In Chapter 4, the experimental methods 
implemented in this research project to achieve these research goals are reported.  
Chapter 5 is the first of the result chapters and applies the synchrotron single crystal X-ray 
diffraction technique in the study of variable temperature proton disorder in centrosymmetric 
hydrogen bonded carboxylic acid dimers. Chapter 6 focuses on the design of proton transfer 
systems implementing a number of crystal engineering strategies in the design of short strong 
hydrogen bonds (SSHBs) for potential proton migration studies. Chapter 7 applies a combination 
of diffraction methods (synchrotron and laboratory X-ray diffraction) and refinement strategies in 
the study of temperature dependent proton migration across SSHBs, allowing the potential of these 
methods in the study of proton migration to be assessed. Chapter 8 is the final application of the 
synchrotron technique in studies of proton transfer behaviour investigating static proton transfer 
behaviour in molecular complexes of the proton sponge 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene with 
organic acids. The urea-acid inclusion materials presented in Chapter 9 additionally allow the 
investigation of the hydrogen bond as a crystal engineering tool in the design of hydrogen bonded 
solvent-inclusion networks. 
In the last chapter, Chapter 10, conclusions from the findings in Chapters 5 to 9 are pulled together 
and patterns explored. Drawing on these overall findings, some suggestions for future work are 
also made.

Chapter 1.  
Introduction 
In the research project upon which this thesis reports, the hydrogen bond is explored as both a 
crystal engineering tool and as a means to study interesting proton transfer effects in the solid 
state. The molecular complexes studied have been prepared by evaporative crystallisation. Single 
crystal X-ray diffraction has been used as the main technique for the characterisation of the 
materials studied whilst synchrotron X-ray diffraction has been investigated as a rapid throughput 
tool in studying proton transfer effects.   
This Introductory Chapter gives an account of the principles underlying the molecular complexes 
studied: the hydrogen bond which is the principal intermolecular interaction by which the 
components are assembled; crystal engineering, the design tool which seeks to predict which 
intermolecular interactions will form between given components, which also informs the choice of 
components in attempting to form complexes with a designed structure or property; and proton 
transfer, an important phenomenon within hydrogen bonds in solid state materials and which is 
manifest in its different facets in various aspects of the complexes studied. 
1.1 The hydrogen bond 
The concept of the hydrogen bond was first introduced by Latimer and Rodebush to explain the 
structure and properties of water; the oxygen atoms can be considered to show tendencies partially 
to both add and give up hydrogen such that two water molecules may be bound together by a weak 
bond. 
 Subsequently, Pimental and McClellan described the situation of hydrogen bond 
formation occurring when a hydrogen atom is bonded to an atom, called a hydrogen bond donor 
(D), that is more electronegative than itself such that the hydrogen atom is deshielded and may 
interact with a neighbouring atom in the same or a different molecule, called a hydrogen bond 
acceptor (A), which is electron rich or itself electronegative. 
 A hydrogen bond then exists if there 
is evidence of bond formation between DH and A, specifically involving H (Figure 1.1). 
acceptor A must have lone-pair electrons or polarisable -electrons. 
 The hydrogen bond can be 
distinguished from weaker van der Waals interactions by its tendency for linearity between the 
DH and A groups.

Figure 1.1 The description of a hydrogen bond formed between a hydrogen bond donor group, DH, and a hydrogen 
bond acceptor group, A.   
Hydrogen bonds form in solution or within a solid material and are important in both biological 
and chemical systems having structural or dynamic implications 
9, 10
 and leading to certain physical 
properties of materials. 
 Evidence of hydrogen bonding is observable in Nuclear Magnetic 
Resonance (NMR) spectra where the DH proton signals are shifted significantly downfield and 
in Infrared spectroscopy (IR) where DH stretch bands are shifted to lower stretching 
frequencies. 
1.1.1 The hydrogen potential energy surface (PES) 
The formation of a hydrogen bonding interaction has consequences for both the position and 
vibrational motion of the hydrogen atom in the DH bond which is governed by the potential 
energy surface (PES); in an isolated DH bond, the PES has the shape of a single well. 
On forming a hydrogen bond, the vibrational motion of the hydrogen atom is restricted; due to the 
hydrogen atom now being restrained by two bonds (DH and HA). This restriction is reflected 
in the PES which broadens with smaller energy gaps between the DH vibrational levels 
(representing a slight weakening of this bond as a bond to the acceptor is formed) and a second 
well is developed; the PES has the shape of an asymmetric double well (Figure 1.2). 
Figure 1.2 The potential energy surface (PES) for a free DH (solid line) and DH in a hydrogen bond 
(dashed line). 
All types of hydrogen bonds exist within two classes; those formed between donor and acceptor 
groups in different molecules are intermolecular hydrogen bonds whilst those formed between 
donor and acceptor groups in the same molecule are intramolecular. 
 Within the two classes, three 
sub categories of hydrogen bonding interactions can be defined depending on bond energies, 
geometries and nature of the interaction (Table 1.1).

Energy (kcal mol
) 14  40 4  15 < 4 
The strength of a hydrogen bond may also be affected by donor acidity and acceptor basicity. 
Donor properties improve on increasing the acidity of the DH proton; an increase in electron 
density on the donor will strengthen its donor ability, for example N>O>S, whilst a better 
hydrogen bond acceptor is one that is more basic. The hardness and softness of the acid (the donor, 
D) and the base (the acceptor, A) (HSAB) will also affect the hydrogen bond strength, defined as 
the ability of the hydrogen bond donor to polarise and the acceptor to become polarised; hard 
donors and acceptors have a lower ability to polarise or be polarised, respectively, whilst the 
opposite is true for soft donors and acceptors. Typically, hard acid donors prefer to form hydrogen 
bonds with hard base acceptors whilst soft acid donors prefer to form hydrogen bonds with soft 
base acceptors; this interaction of like with like creates extra stability in the hydrogen bonded 
adduct. 
14, 15
Different shapes of the PES are observed for DH when involved in different strength hydrogen 
bonding interactions with A (Figure 1.3). Moderate strength hydrogen bonding interactions have a 
PES with the shape of an asymmetric double well potential. If the interaction of the proton with D 
becomes increasingly equivalent in energy to its interaction with A, the energy difference between 
the two wells reduces and the asymmetric potential becomes increasingly symmetric. For strong 
hydrogen bonds, the double wells in the PES become increasingly symmetric and the energy 
barrier between them is reduced; the PES has the shape of a symmetric double well potential. In 
some cases, where the donor-acceptor distance is increasingly short, the barrier between the two 
wells is sufficiently reduced such that the PES has the shape of a symmetrical single well 
potential. 
Figure 1.3 The potential energy surfaces for the motion of a hydrogen atom in (a) an asymmetric double well, (b) a 
symmetric double well and (c) a symmetric single well PES. 
1.1.2 Strong hydrogen bonds 
Strong hydrogen bonds are the shortest, with donor-acceptor distances in the range of 2.2 to 2.5 , 
and are the most directional of the hydrogen bonding interactions with hydrogen bond angles 
approaching 180 . Linearity provides strength in these interactions due to being the optimised 
geometry for electrostatic interaction of atoms. 
 Strong hydrogen bonds most commonly occur 
where there is an electron deficiency in the DH donor group or where there is an excess of 
electron density in the acceptor group. An electron deficiency in D increases the partial positive 
charge on H whilst an increased electron density on A leads to an increased interaction with the 
deshielded proton; the result is a strengthening of the formed hydrogen bonding interaction. 
Where either the donor or acceptor or both are charged, these are termed charge assisted hydrogen 
bonds (CAHB). 
18, 19
 Stronger hydrogen bonds have also been found to be formed for increasingly 
delocalised conjugated systems, such as in -diketone moieties or in amide groups; the amide  
NH group becomes a stronger donor if the amide C=O accepts a hydrogen bond. The DH 
groups are polarised by charge flow through -bonds. 
 This is the effect of resonance assisted 
hydrogen bonds (RAHB) and may be inter or intra molecular (Figure 1.4). 
Figure 1.4 Resonance assisted hydrogen bonds (RAHBs) (a) resonance forms of an amide group and (b) RAHB rings.  
Strong hydrogen bonds may also occur due to geometrical conformation, when donor and acceptor 
atoms are brought into closer contact than the sum of the van der Waals radii such as in 4,4'-
dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridin-1-ium 2,4,5-tricarboxybenzoate (Figure 1.5); deprotonated and protonated 
carboxylic acid groups are in close proximity. 
Figure 1.5 The intramolecular OHO in 4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridin-1-ium 2,4,5-tricarboxybenzoate. 
Common types of strong hydrogen bonds include O
HO, N
HO
HN hydrogen 
bonds. Strong hydrogen bonds may have bond energies in excess of 12 kcal mol
, comparable to 
some covalent interactions. Very short hydrogen bonds with donor-acceptor distances of less than 
2.5  for OHO and less than 2.6  for NHO are considered short strong hydrogen bonds 
(SSHBs). These interactions may be described as three-centre four-electron bonding where the 
proton is involved in two partial covalent bonds to the donor and acceptor and, as such, are 
characterised by elongated DH and shorter HA distances. 
 The shortest SSHBs may exhibit 
interesting proton migration behaviour related to the symmetric shape of the PES of DH in this 
short hydrogen bond (1.3.2). 
1.1.3 Moderate hydrogen bonds 
Moderate strength hydrogen bonds have donor-acceptor distances that are less than the sum of the 
van der Waals radii of the two atoms, typically in the range of 2.5 to 3.2 , and are the most 
commonly formed hydrogen bonds, often called normal hydrogen bonds. They form between 
neutral donor and acceptor groups where D is electronegative relative to H and the acceptor atom 
has a lone pair; these are regarded as mostly electrostatic in nature. Moderate strength hydrogen 
bonds include OHO, NHO or NHN interactions. They are softer interactions able to 
exhibit a wider range of hydrogen bond angles, typically 130 to 180 . 
 If the moderate strength 
hydrogen bond has an increasingly symmetric double well PES, split occupation of the two proton 
sites at either end of the hydrogen bond may be observed; this behaviour is proton disorder 
(1.3.1). 
1.1.4 Weak hydrogen bonds 
Weak hydrogen bonds are formed when the hydrogen atom is bonded to a slightly more 
electroneutral atom than itself or when the acceptor atom does not have lone pairs but -electrons. 
The donor-acceptor distances in such cases are typically on the edge of the van der Waals limit 
(3.2 to 4.0 ) and the hydrogen bond angles are highly non-directional (90 to 150 ). They are 
entirely electrostatic in nature and have strengths of less than 4 kcal mol
; the weakest of the weak 
hydrogen bonds are barely distinguishable from van der Waals interactions. 
 Weak hydrogen 
bonds may be divided into subsets including those that are formed from a weak donor and strong 
acceptor, including CH donors with oxygen and nitrogen acceptors, those that are formed from a 
strong donor and weak acceptor, including NH and OH donors with  and fluorine acceptors, 
and those that are formed from weak donor and weak acceptors, including alkyne and CH 
donors and  and fluorine acceptors. CH donor strength tends to depend on the carbon 
hybridisation C(sp)>C(sp
)>C(sp
) and whether the donor atom is bonded to electron withdrawing 
groups. 
Weak CHO hydrogen bonds 
CHO hydrogen bonds are particularly important weak interactions in the solid state playing a 
role in crystal structure stabilisation and their existence has been confirmed by charge density 
studies. 
 They tend to form for CH groups with oxygen acceptors in preference to interaction 
with other hydrogen bond acceptors. 
 Their formation usually occurs as a result of the hydrogen 
atom in the CH bond pointing towards oxygen atom lone pairs, forming an electrostatic 
interaction. 
 They are suggested to have a significant role in crystal packing, stabilising structures 
due to this electrostatic nature, 
 particularly in a lateral manner such as those in quinoid 
compounds. 
 The geometrical parameters of these hydrogen bonds are of interest (Figure 1.6). 
Varied linearity of these interactions has been observed. For those formed between a CH group 
with a carbonyl as the hydrogen bond acceptor, the CHO contacts tend to lie in the plane of 
the oxygen sp
 lobes (the trigonal plane of R1, R2, C and O) and the hydrogen bond angle <CHO 
tends to be close to 120 . Those formed between a CH donor and oxygen atoms, in general, 
may vary significantly in their <CHO angle (), with an average of 153  reported. 
Figure 1.6 Types of CHO hydrogen bonding interactions: (a) formed between a CH group and a carbonyl 
acceptor and (b) between a CH group and an oxygen atom acceptor. Variation in the <CHO occurs. 
A weak hydrogen bond is defined as having a donor-acceptor distance of 3.2 to 4.0 . However, 
for weak CHO hydrogen bonds the situation is more complicated as they may be distorted by 
other crystal forces or where the hydrogen atom is highly acidic; this leads to shorter CO 
distances. In assessing a weak CHO hydrogen bond, both distance and angular characteristics 
should therefore be considered. 
1.1.5 Bifurcated hydrogen bonds 
Hydrogen bonds are long range interactions and as such DH may interact with more than one 
acceptor at once. The interaction of DH with a second acceptor or the interaction of one 
acceptor with two donor DH groups generates a bifurcated hydrogen bond (Figure 1.7). 
Hydrogen bonding interactions of the type DHA are two centre interactions whilst bifurcated 
hydrogen bonds are three centre interactions. The bifurcated hydrogen bonds are characterised by 
the distances r, d1, d2 and angles 1, 2 and 3 with varying symmetries in d and . 
8, 15, 30
 Related 
to the molecular geometry, certain components are prone to forming bifurcated hydrogen  
bonds. 
31, 32
Figure 1.7 Three centre bifurcated hydrogen bonds (a) bifurcated donor DHAA and (b) bifurcated acceptor DHADH.  
1.2 Crystal engineering 
Hydrogen bonds are frequently exploited in the field of crystal engineering. Crystal engineering is 
defined as the controlled design of organic solids, employing a strategy which uses the 
understanding of intermolecular interactions in the context of crystal packing, with desired 
structure-related functions. 
 It is a bottom up construction approach starting from molecular 
building blocks, called molecular components, which assemble via a process of crystallisation to 
give a single or multi-component crystalline functional material (Figure 1.8). 
Figure 1.8 The assembly of molecular building blocks to form a multi-component material via crystallisation.  
1.2.1 Crystal packing 
The arrangement of the molecular building blocks in a crystalline material is called the crystal 
packing; the crystal packing is governed by intermolecular interactions between molecular 
building blocks. 
 The primary mode of assembly of the molecular building blocks is through 
hydrogen bonding interactions. Hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups on different molecular 
building blocks link to form primary hydrogen bonded structural motifs called synthons (Figure 
1.9). 
 The process of linking hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups to form a hydrogen bond 
synthon is called molecular recognition 
 and occurs in a complementary or self-complementary 
fashion; the hydrogen donor and acceptors on each side of the synthon are from different 
functional groups for the former or are from the same functional group for the latter.   
Figure 1.9 Common hydrogen bonded synthons: complementary (a)i carboxylic acid:amide 
() synthon, 
(a)ii nitro:amide 
() synthon, (a)iii carboxylic acid:pyridine 
() and self-complementary (b)i carboxylic acid 
dimer 
() synthon, (b)ii amide dimer 
() synthon and (c) a single carboxylic acid link 
().  
Molecular building blocks may arrange themselves into extended networks including hydrogen 
bonded chains or rings by repetition or combination of different hydrogen bond synthons. Etter 
defined a set of rules for molecular arrangmemt via molecular recognition; all good proton donors 
and acceptors will be used in hydrogen bonding, six membered ring intramolecular hydrogen 
bonds form in preference to intermolecular hydrogen bonds and the best proton donors and 
acceptors that remain post intramolecular hydrogen bond formation then form intermolecular 
hydrogen bonds. 
 So-called graphset notation is used to describe the morphology of these 
networks; this notation includes the type of network, such as a ring (R), chain (C), finite (D) or 
intramolecular hydrogen bond (S), the number of hydrogen bond donors (subscript) and acceptors 
(superscript) and the size of the motif (in brackets), corresponding to the number of atoms in the 
repeat unit. 
36, 37
 As exemplars, the synthon in Figure 1.9(a)i is a ring network with graphset 
notation 2
2(8) whilst that in Figure 1.9(b)iii is a chain network with graphset notation 1
1(4). 
Urea is a component commonly used in crystal engineering design strategies. The large number 
and arrangement of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups on the molecular building block 
offer the potential for a range of hydrogen bond synthons and networks to form; the nature of the 
network that is favoured is altered depending on the substitution of the urea. 
 These include head 
to tail one dimensional hydrogen bonded chains formed in urea, 
 N,N-diphenylurea, 
 N,N-
dimethylurea 
 and N-methylurea, 
 and isolated hydrogen bonded dimers formed in N,N-
dimethyl urea 
 (Figure 1.10). 
Figure 1.10 Hydrogen bonding networks in substituted ureas: head totail one-dimensional chains in (a) urea, (b) N-
methylurea, (c) N,N-dimethylurea and isolated dimers in (d) N,N-dimethylurea.  
The combination of substituted ureas with molecular building blocks containing complementary 
but different hydrogen bond donor-acceptor groups to the ureas can either disrupt or work in 
combination with the head to tail one-dimensional hydrogen bonded urea chains and urea dimers 
to give further hydrogen bonded networks. Carboxylic acid molecular building blocks are 
commonly combined with urea and link via a carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond 
synthon. For dicarboxylic acids, this synthon may form singly or on either side of the urea, 
depending on its substitution and crystallisation ratio of the molecular building blocks. Alhalaweh 
et al (2010) 
 defined the resulting hydrogen bonded motifs of urea (U) and carboxylic acid (Ac) 
as U:Ac, if crystallised in a 1:1 ratio, as U:Ac:U, if crystallised in a 2:1 ratio of U to Ac, or as 
Ac:U:Ac, if crystallised in a 1:2 ratio of U to Ac (Figure 1.11).  
Figure 1.11 The resulting hydrogen bonding motifs in urea (U) carboxylic acid (Ac) molecular complexes when in 
ratios (a) 1:1, (b) 2:1 or (c) 1:2. 
The amine functionality on the urea, when substituted on one side only, has the potential to 
interact with nitro groups forming NH(O)O bifurcated 2
1(6) and 2
2(8) hydrogen bond 
synthons such as in co-crystals of 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid and 4-aminobenzoic acid where 
the nitro groups link to an amine group in the next molecule via these synthons.

Weaker interactions 
Hydrogen bonding controls the primary linking of the molecular buildings blocks. However, 
weaker interactions in the crystal packing also exist which may dramatically alter the three-
dimensional arrangement of the primary motifs as well as the nature of the hydrogen bonding 
within the motifs. 
Halogen bonding interactions have been shown to be comparable in strength to hydrogen bonding 
interactions in terms of their role in molecular assembly; 
 their location at the periphery of 
molecules means they are ideally positioned to be involved in intermolecular interactions. 
halogen atom (X) in an RX bond has an electropositive area on its outer side, called a -hole, 
which can interact with a negative site (Y) such as a lone pair of a Lewis base or -electron 
density. The result is a RXY halogen bond formed along the extension of the RX bond. 
48-50
Halogen bond strength decreases in order of halogen Cl<Br<I and increases as the 
electronegativity of the R substituent increases. 
 Halogenhalogen contacts, characterised by an 
XX distance less than the sum of van der Waals radii, have also been recognised with a view to 
application in crystal engineering design strategies. 
 Two preferred geometries have been 
identified for the interaction of halogen atoms (Figure 1.12). 
Figure 1.12 The two preferred geometries for halogenhalogen contacts: (a) 1 = 2 and (b) 1 = 180  and 2 = 90 . 
R = organic group and X = Cl, Br and I.  
Weak  interactions between aromatic moieties have been shown to exist 
 and have an 
influence on crystal packing and control of molecular orientation 
 in crystalline materials. Weak 
electrostatic interactions between aromatic rings mean that these moieties tend to organise 
themselves in two ways (Figure 1.13). Aromatic rings may be packed in a face-to-face manner, 
stacked parallel or offset or in a herringbone arrangement, or packed in an edge to face 
arrangement; these are more akin to weak hydrogen bonds, of the type CH. 
 These 
arrangements occur as a result of the quadrupole moment created by the -electron density which 
results in a negative charge in the centre of the ring and positive charges at the edges of the ring; 
the parallel eclipsed packing (Figure 1.13(a)i) is therefore less favourable due to repulsive forces 
occurring. The attractive interactions in a face-to-face stack may be enhanced by adding 
substituents to the aromatic rings, regardless of electron withdrawing or donating nature. 
Figure 1.13 Types of  interactions: (a) face to face (i) eclipsed and (ii) offset and (b) edge-to-face.  
Carbonyl-carbonyl pseudo -stacking interactions have also been identified in the three-
dimensional packing of crystalline materials including anti-parallel stacked carbonyl-carbonyl, 
parallel offset carbonyl-carbonyl and a 90  approach between carbonyl groups (Figure 1.14). 
Figure 1.14 Weak carbonyl-carbonyl interactions: (a) anti-parallel, (b) offset parallel and (c) a 90  approach. 
Weaker hydrogen bonds such as CHX, CX and CH have also been suggested to 
play a significant role in the stabilisation of molecular assemblies.

1.2.2 Crystal forms 
A crystalline material can exhibit a number of different crystal forms. Polymorphs are those that 
vary in the crystal packing of the molecular components; if multi-component, the stoichiometric 
ratio of components will be unchanged. Solvates contain solvent molecules in addition to the main 
components. Components within a crystal may be neutral, termed a co-crystal if multi-component, 
or charged, if proton transfer has occurred between components; this is a salt (Figure 1.15). 
61-63
some cases, neutral and charged components may be present in the same crystalline material.  
Figure 1.15 Differing crystal forms for a molecular building block including polymorphs, a salt, a solvate and a co-
crystal.  
The changes to the crystal packing in different crystal forms of a material may lead to different 
properties. These include differing physical properties such as colour, where changes in molecular 
packing can lead to changes in colour as observed in 5-methyl-2-[(2-nitrophenyl)amino]-3-
thiophenecarbonitrile (ROY) as a result of the change in the angle rotation between two parts of 
the structure; 
 mechanical properties such as hardness, for example diamond and graphite are 
made from the same carbon building block however the tetrahedral arrangement of carbon atoms 
in diamond give it a hard, rigid structure whilst the layered arrangement of carbon atoms in 
graphite result in a softer material with sliding layers; 
 surface properties such as habit, for 
example the anti-malarial drug arteether exhibits a number of crystal morphologies as a result of 
changes in crystal packing 
 and different thermodynamic and physical properties such as 
solubility, an example of which is the introduction of isonicatinamide into the crystal structure of 
the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dexlansoprazole, which improved its solubility relative 
to the API alone. 
 Changes to the properties of a material on obtaining a different form are 
therefore of particular importance in the pharmaceutical industry. 
Different crystal forms also have differing stabilities and may convert with time or be induced by 
temperature to the most thermodynamically stable form; this less stable form is termed 
metastable. 
 Crystal forms may also interconvert between anhydrous and solvated materials 
under atmospheric conditions or from exposure to solvent vapours (Figure 1.16). The addition of 
solvent to a material has been reported to improving tableting properties of an API. 
 Figure 1.16 The interconversion between an anhydrous crystal form and a solvate.  
1.2.3 Inclusion materials 
Inclusion materials are chemical crystalline compounds in which a host framework is formed 
around a guest species. The host components are typically linked by hydrogen bonding or weak 
intermolecular interactions into an extended network which contains cavities of molecular size. 
The guests can satisfy both inefficiencies in the crystal packing of the host, filling open framework 
spaces, and the hydrogen bond donor or acceptor abilities of the host. 
69, 70
 Guests may be included 
in the host lattice in channels, forming inclusion compounds, or in enclosed molecular pockets, 
termed inclusion clathrates. 
The formation of inclusion complexes may be targeted in crystal engineering design strategies by 
careful selection of host components and guest species. The large number of hydrogen bond donor 
and acceptor groups aid assembly into the hexagonal channel host structure in urea inclusion 
compounds 
 whilst their arrangement favours a honeycomb structure for the inclusion clathrate 
of trimesic acid. 
 Some host networks have been formed as a result of host component molecular 
symmetry, such as for the tris(o-phenylenedioxy)cyclophosphazene which packs into open 
hexagonal channels, 
 and host component molecular size, including xanthenol which is bulky and 
rigid and leads to packing inefficiencies in the structure. 
 Guests may also induce inclusion 
behaviour often controlled by guest size, solvents are frequently included into host networks due to 
their ability to fill empty space, or controlled by guest ability to accept or donate electron density 
for hydrogen bond formation to the host network or to bridge polar regions of the crystal. 
 Guest 
shape may also induce inclusion behaviour, for example the hexagonal host network in urea 
inclusion compounds only forms in the presence of linear guests. 
Inclusion complexes exhibit a range of interesting properties including guest release and uptake; 
if guest release leads to structural collapse then the material has virtual porosity only. 
78, 79
host networks may also exhibit selectivity for certain guests 
 and it may be possible to exchange 
one guest for another whilst the host framework remains intact. 
 Related to their properties, 
inclusion complexes are targeted in crystal engineering due to their potential applications in 
pharmaceutics, 
 chemical sensing, 
 in the separation of alkanes 
 and in the capture of 
volatile organic compound (VOCs). 
 In Chapter 9, hydrogen bonded inclusion networks 
are targeted using crystal engineering strategies.  
1.3 Proton transfer  
Within a hydrogen bonded synthon, various proton transfer processes are possible. Proton transfer 
is facilitated or limited by the hydrogen bond; in many situations this is considered as the most 
important property of the hydrogen bond, with proton transfer processes constituting a significant 
component of important areas such as enzyme catalysis and acid-base chemistry. 
 Proton transfer 
involves the transfer of charge, in the form of a proton, from one molecular component to another, 
usually between an acidic and basic species. Where proton transfer occurs across a hydrogen 
bonded synthon in a crystalline material, a salt is formed. If proton transfer occurs such that the 
proton occupies a mid-point between the acid and the base, this species is termed an 
intermediate. 
The occurrence of salt formation via proton transfer between molecular components has been 
suggested to be related to the pKa values of the interacting components. The pKa is the acid 
dissociation constant, linked to the pH and concentrations of the dissociated [Ac
] and non-
dissociated acid [HAc] (Equation 1.1) in a particular solution. 
Equation 1.1   =  + 
[]
[]
A general rule frequently followed in crystal engineering is that if the value of pKa between two 
components (pKa(base)  pKa(acid)) is greater than 2 or 3, a salt will be formed and if it is less than 
0, a neutral complex is observed. Between pKa values of 0 to 3, however, the pKa parameter is 
unable to reliably predict salt formation. One consideration for using pKa values is that they are 
only valid under the solution equilibrium conditions at which they were determined and are 
temperature dependent; 
 however, in crystal engineering, once a material has formed, it is in the 
solid state. Crystal engineering design strategies therefore often use values of pKa  only as a 
guide.  
Proton transfer, once it has occurred between molecular components may either be dynamic, 
where the proton position can be tuned upon varying the external environment such as by changes 
in temperature or static, where no further change in proton position is observed post transfer. 
Interesting dynamic proton transfer behaviour has been observed across hydrogen bonds in the 
form of proton disorder (1.3.1) and proton migration (1.3.2) whilst interesting static proton 
transfer behaviour has been observed in molecular complexes of proton sponges (1.3.3). 
Materials exhibiting these proton transfer properties have been targeted by crystal engineering 
design strategies.  
1.3.1 Proton disorder 
The proton transfer process of proton disorder may occur across hydrogen bonds in the solid state. 
It involves the partial switch in function of the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups such that 
the hydrogen atom occupies two sites simultaneously (in different unit cells within the crystal 
packing). Two proton disorder mechanisms exist including conformational disorder, involving 
bond reorientation, and configurational disorder, involving bond making and breaking due to 
reorganisation of adjacent single and double covalent bonds; 
 configurational disorder is of 
interest in this thesis (Chapter 5). Proton disorder commonly occurs across moderate strength 
hydrogen bonds where the shape of the PES approaches that of a symmetric double well such that 
the energy difference between the two proton sites in the hydrogen bond is small. 
 Typically, the 
proton disorder may be temperature dependent, where a single proton site in the hydrogen bond is 
occupied at low temperature whilst a second proton site becomes increasingly occupied as the 
temperature of the system increases. 
Proton disorder is often present in systems containing cyclic hydrogen bonded 2
2(8) carboxylic 
acid dimers (Figure 1.17). 
90, 91
 These dimers commonly form between carboxylic acid groups, the 
2(8) carboxylic acid hydrogen bonding synthon is insensitive to carboxylic acid group 
substituents, and, if formed between the same molecular species (homo dimer), permits the 
adoption of a centre of symmetry in the dimer; the symmetry of the dimer may lead to symmetry 
in the shape of the PES double wells and proton disorder. 
 The presence of proton disorder in 
these systems is suggested by shortened CO and lengthened C=O carboxylic acid bond  
lengths 
 from the average CO (1.305 ) and C=O (1.226 ) lengths for an aromatic 
carboxylic acid group 
 and by elongated OH distances. If the proton is modelled initially as a 
single site, proton disorder may be indicated by a substantially elongated anisotropic thermal 
ellipsoid for the proton along the hydrogen bond, as the proton seems to spread over the two 
simultaneously occupied sites. 
 In this case, the proton should be modelled as having two partly 
occupied sites. The presence of split hydrogen atom density along the hydrogen bond donor-
acceptor line when imaged directly in Fourier difference maps (2.4.1) also indicates the presence 
of proton disorder. 
Figure 1.17 (a) The configuration disorder of carbonyl-hydroxyl groups in a carboxylic acid 
() hydrogen bonded 
dimer and (b) the shape of the anisotropic hydrogen atom thermal ellipsoid when disorder is present.  
Proton disorder has been observed in a number of substituted benzoic acids containing 
centrosymmetric homo hydrogen bonded 2
2(8) carboxylic acid dimers including benzoic acid, 
identified in the solid 
 and liquid phases, 
 4-dimethylamino benzoic acid (4-DABA) in its native 
crystal structure, in a binary complex with 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (3,5-DNBA) 
89, 97
 and in a 
ternary complex with 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid and 4,4-bipyridine 
 and in crystal polymorphs of 
3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid. 
 The proton disorder in these systems was found to be temperature 
dependent from diffraction studies including split occupancies of the dimer proton of 86:13 at 
20 K compared to 62:37 at 175 K in benzoic acid dimers, 
 90:10 at 100 K compared to 62:38 at 
300 K in 4-DABA hydrogen bonded homo dimers in the native crystal structure of 4-DABA, 
66:34 at 100 K compared to 46:53 at 300 K in 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded homo dimers in the  
4-DABA 3,5-DNBA binary complex, 
 75:25 at 100 K compared to an approximate 50:50 
disorder in 4-DABA hydrogen bonded homo dimers in the ternary complex with 3,5-
dinitrobenzoic acid and 4,4-bipyridine. 
 The dynamics of temperature dependent proton disorder 
in benzoic acid have been followed by NMR 
24, 99
 and neutron diffraction methods 
 and were 
found to occur by the classical Arrhenius jump model at high temperatures; this model is based on 
the simplest assumptions of the collision and transition-state theories for reactions which must 
surmount an energy barrier and where the reaction probability jumps from 0 to 1 at a particular 
energy. 
 However, at low temperature below 50 K, the proton dynamics switch to phonon-
assisted quantum tunnelling; where a particle may appear on the other side of a barrier it does not 
have the energy to classically overcome. 
 An energy difference between the two proton sites has 
been calculated, in terms of H, at 0.12 kcal mol
 for the 50 to 175 K temperature range. 
The proton disorder in these substituted benzoic acid systems is suggested to be tuneable by crystal 
packing. For example, in an isolated benzoic acid hydrogen bonded 2
2(8) homo dimer, the 
simultaneous transfer of the dimer proton results in a configuration equivalent in energy to the 
original 
 and 50:50 occupancy of each proton site is expected. However, on placing the 
hydrogen bonded dimer in a crystallographic lattice environment in the solid phase of benzoic 
acid, the geometry and energy of the two proton configurations differs from the situation in 
isolated dimers. This is related to the change in shape of the potential energy surface of hydrogen 
bonds forming the 2
2(8) homo dimer when in a crystal. An isolated dimer has a symmetric 
double well potential; the two wells are equivalent in energy and the barrier between them is 
small. However, in a dimer in a crystal, anisotropic crystal field effects in the local environment 
lead to an asymmetric double well potential where there is a significant difference in energy 
between the two wells and thermal activation is required to switch between the two proton 
configurations.  
Crystal packing effects on proton disorder are observed in the binary complex of 4-DABA 3,5-
DNBA; a carboxylic acid hydrogen bonded 2
2(8) homo dimer of 3,5-DNBA exhibits proton 
disorder with temperature, in one packing environment, whilst a carboxylic acid hydrogen bonded 
2(8) homo dimer of 4-DABA, in another crystal packing environment, does not. 
 Jones et al. 
(2013) 
 suggested the lack of proton disorder in the 4-DABA homo 2
2(8) hydrogen bonded 
dimer could be attributed to the asymmetric arrangement of weak interactions to the 4-DABA acid 
groups; one acid oxygen interacts with a nitro group (dOO 2.988(2) ) and the other with a methyl 
group forming a weak CHO hydrogen bond (dCO 3.214(3) ). These interactions create an 
asymmetry in the dimer hydrogen bond such that one proton site is favoured over the other. In 
contrast, only very weak -interactions, not strong enough to perturb the symmetry of the dimer 
hydrogen bond, formed to the acid groups in the 3,5-DNBA dimer (d 3.088(3) to 3.313(3) ). 
A similar effect is observed between polymorphs of 3,5-DNBA. 
 Both polymorphs contain 
carboxylic acid hydrogen bonded 2
2(8) homo dimers however, on changing the crystal packing 
environment of the dimer between the polymorphs, the proton disorder differs at 300 K; in 
polymorph I (P21/c) it is 64:36 whilst in polymorph II it is 72:28. The crystal packing environment 
of the dimer in polymorph I includes interactions between one of the dimer acid oxygen atoms 
with a nitro group (dNO 3.021(3) ) and with an aromatic CH group (dCO 3.407(3) ) whilst 
the crystal packing environment of the dimer in polymorph II includes the dimer acid oxygen and 
a neighbouring ring CH (dCO 3.508(1) ) and an anti-parallel -contact between the acid 
carbonyl and a nitro group (d 2.927(1) and 3.026(1) ). 
Pressure may also have effect on the ordering/disorder of protons in carboxylic acid hydrogen 
bonded 2
2(8) homo dimers. When pressure up to 2.21 GPa was applied to benzoic acid at room 
temperature; the proton ordering was observed to change from 50:50 at 0 GPa to 90:10 at 0.2 GPa; 
the increase in pressure resulted in closer contacts to the local environment and hence enhanced 
asymmetry in the potential. Further increases in pressure led to an increase in proton disorder 
attributed to a compressed dimer hydrogen bond distance lowering the potential barrier for 
hydrogen transfer between sites. 
Studies into solid state proton disorder may provide insight into the role of weak interactions on 
molecular conformation and hydrogen bond PES behaviour. Chapter 5 examines in detail the 
effect of changes to the local packing environment on temperature dependent proton disorder in 
additional molecular complexes containing 3,5-DNBA carboxylic acid hydrogen bonded 2
homo dimers, applying the technique of synchrotron X-ray diffraction.  
1.3.2 Proton migration 
Proton migration is a proton transfer process which involves the gradual shift in position of a 
hydrogen atom across a hydrogen bond. It is observed in very short hydrogen bonds, called short 
strong hydrogen bonds (SSHBs) with donor-acceptor distances of 2.4 to 2.55 , depending on the 
identity of D and A. The shape of the PES for these hydrogen bonds approaches that of a 
symmetric single well potential where the barrier to proton transfer is low such that proton 
migration may occur. 
16, 105
 The proton transfer pathways of migration across hydrogen bonds 
include from an off-centred position to a symmetrically located position, or vice versa, or by a 
switch from one side of the hydrogen bond to the other. As such, proton migration across a 
hydrogen bond is characterised by changes in the DH and HA distances. Proton migration 
may also be followed in Fourier difference maps (2.4.1) suggested by either a shift in the position 
or by elongation of the hydrogen atom density along the hydrogen bond that often accompanies the 
migration process; a switch in the direction of the elongation along the hydrogen bond may also 
indicate migration. The shift in proton location within such migration processes in SSHBs tends to 
have a maximum value of around 0.1 . 
Proton migration across SSHBs is a tuneable effect occurring as a result of the application of 
external variables including pressure, 
 electric fields 
 or temperature. The temperature 
dependence of proton migration, in particular, is of interest in this research project. Temperature 
dependent proton migration has been observed in a number of OHO and O
HO
 SSHBs 
formed in urea organic acid molecular complexes including the 1:1 adduct of urea phosphoric acid 
(migration of 0.04  where dOO is approximately 2.4 ), 
 the 2:1 complex of N,N-dimethylurea 
oxalic acid (migration of 0.045(9)  where dOO is approximately 2.43 ), and the 2:1 complex of 
N,N-dimethylurea oxalic acid (migration of 0.031(9)  where dOO is approximately 2.44 ). 
Temperature dependent proton migration has also been observed in a number of N
HO
SSHBs including in N-heterocycle organic acid molecular complexes in pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic 
acid (migration of 0.09  where dNO is approximately 2.52 ), 
 in 4,4-bipyridine benzene-
1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid (migration of 0.1  where dNO is approximately 2.52 ) 
 and in 4-
methylpyridine pentachlorophenol (migration of 0.08  where dNO is approximately 2.50 ). 
Other variables may lead to the tuning of proton migration behaviour. These include SSHB donor-
acceptor distances; temperature dependent proton migration has not been observed for SSHBs with 
distances above 2.45 , for OHO or O
HO
 SSHBs, or above 2.55 , for N
HO
SSHBs. The proton migration occurs in these molecular complexes where the SSHB donor-
acceptor distance remains invariant as a function of temperature. In terms of designing potential 
proton migration systems, some previous efforts have gone into targeting the design of SSHBs 
using pKa values of components; this is based on the premise that it may be possible to relate 
hydrogen bond strength and pKa values, 
 thus the latter may also be applicable in tuning proton 
migration behaviour; stronger hydrogen bonds may be expected to form between two components 
where their difference in pKa approaches zero. 
 An increase in basicity of the hydrogen bond 
acceptor may lead to shorter SSHB donor-acceptor distances such as in molecular complexes of 
oxalic acids with substituted ureas; oxalic acid forms shorter OHO hydrogen bonds in this 
synthon with more basic N-methylurea (dOO 2.449(2) and 2.419(2) ) 
 and N,N-dimethylurea 
(dOO 2.4398(15) and 2.4423(15) ) 
 than with less basic urea (dOO 2.472(5) ). 
The consideration of pKa values may also allow extent of proton migration to be tuned. Jones et 
al. (2012) 
 compared the extents of migration of a proton across OHO SSHBs in urea 
phosphoric acid (1:1), 
 N,N-dimethylurea oxalic acid (2:1) and N,N-dimethylurea oxalic acid 
(2:1) 
 to values of pKa and observed a trend of increasing degree of migration as pKa became 
less negative. A similar effect was observed by Schmidtmann and Wilson (2008) 
 in molecular 
complexes of pentachlorophenol-lutidine; the value of pKa between components correlated with 
the extent of hydrogen transfer across an OHN hydrogen bond in the dimeric 
pentachlorophenol-lutidine complexes. No correlation was, however, observed in the equivalent 
trimeric complexes. As in the systems exhibiting proton disorder (1.3.1), the nature of the local 
environment surrounding the OHN hydrogen bond in the pentachlorophenol-lutidine systems 
may be affecting its proton transfer behaviour; in the dimeric complexes the OHN hydrogen 
bond is isolated from a polar environment and follows a trend of pKa whilst strong polar 
interactions are present in the trimeric complexes and no such trend is observed. 
 The nature of 
the local environment is affected by molecular stoichiometry in these cases; changing where 
stoichiometry of components changes. Correlations between the extent of proton transfer and pKa 
values for related systems may therefore be affected by stoichiometry of components; a trend may 
only be applicable where the stoichiometry of acidic and basic components is the same across the 
related systems however, this does not appear to be the case of the substituted urea organic acid 
systems.  
Proton migration may be favoured across SSHBs in certain hydrogen bond synthons. Proton 
migration occurs across OHO and N
HO
 SSHBs which are frequently involved in the 
same type of hydrogen bonded synthon between the same molecular building blocks; OHO 
SSHBs form as part of a carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthon between substituted 
ureas and organic acids whilst N
HO
 SSHBs occur between organic acids and N-
heterocycles, usually involving proton transfer, and either in a planar acid:pyridine 2
2(7) synthon 
or a single N
HO
 hydrogen bond between non co-planar pyridine and carboxylic acid groups 
(Figure 1.18).  
Figure 1.18 Synthons favouring SSHB formation: (a) carboxylic acid:amide 
() hydrogen bond synthon, (b) planar 
acid:pyridine 
() synthon and (c) a single N+HO- hydrogen bond between non-planar pyridine and carboxylic 
acid groups. 
Migration of a proton across SSHBs may lead to certain physical properties including colour, such 
as in the 1:1 adduct between squaric acid and 4,4-bipyridine,
 and ferroelectricity, such as in the 
molecular complex of phenazine chloranilic acid. 
 The low barrier to hydrogen transfer in 
SSHBs is thought to play an important role in enzyme catalysis, in transition state  
stabilisation 
 and to be responsible for proton conduction in water. 
 The study of proton 
migration across SSHBs may therefore reveal details about the hydrogen bonding behaviour 
relevant to these properties; single crystal X-ray and neutron diffraction methods are commonly 
employed in its study. 
121, 122
 Chapter 6 applies crystal engineering strategies in the design of 
SSHBs with potential proton migration properties whilst Chapter 7 investigates temperature 
dependent proton migration using a combination of synchrotron and X-ray diffraction.  
1.3.3 Static proton transfer 
Subtle effects about proton transfer behaviour can be revealed when observing static proton 
transfer across a group of related molecular complexes. Static proton transfer is defined here as the 
situation where a proton is transferred from one molecular component to the other in the formation 
of a molecular ionic salt; this transfer state remains unchanged across a range of external variables 
over which the structure is studied. 
The molecular complexes of DMAN (1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene) with organic acids are a 
good target for studying subtle static proton transfer effects. DMAN is a strongly basic 
derivative of naphthalene (pKa 12, H2O) 
 with a high proton affinity caused by the syn peri-
planar arrangement of the amine substituents; protonation relieves the steric strain induced by the 
position of the nitrogen lone pairs close to each other in the peri-planar arrangement. 
protonation, a very stable intramolecular [NHN]
 hydrogen bond (IHB) forms in DMAN 
between the amine substituents (the average protonated dNN is 2.59 ) and the arrangement of the 
DMAN methyl groups changes from a staggered to an eclipsed arrangement (Figure 1.19). 
Figure 1.19 The change in arrangement of the DMAN methyl groups from (a) a staggered arrangement in the neutral 
state 
 to (b) an eclipsed arrangement in the protonated state. 
127, 128
The proton is shielded in its inter-nitrogen position within the IHB by the amine methyl groups, 
leading to a very slow rate of deprotonation, slower than the rate of diffusion  
 The high thermodynamic basicity coupled with the low kinetic basicity 
leads to the term proton sponge for DMAN and other peri amino naphthalenes.  
DMAN forms very stable ionic complexes with organic acids 
 including with 1,2,4,5-benzene-
tetracarboxylic acid (pyromellitic acid), 4,5-dichlorophthalicacid, dicyanoimidazole, and o-benzoic 
sulfimide dehydrate (saccharin). 
 In the crystal structures of these complexes, packing occurs 
that is reminiscent of the close packing observed in inorganic compounds; either in pairs of 
stacked cations or anions, in an anti-parallel manner forming molecular planes, or by one single 
DMANH
 interacting with six anions, or vice versa, in the local environment. 
 Within the 
crystal packing of DMANH
 cations and deprotonated acid anions, a robust fragment  
 [Me2NHNMe2]
 X
, where X
 is the nearest electronegative atom, is formed (Figure 1.20).  
Figure 1.20 The [Me2NHNMe2]
 X
 fragment formed between the protonated DMAN and the nearest 
electronegative atom, X
The [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment has multi-centre intermolecular bonding character 
containing the strong [NHN]
 intermolecular hydrogen bond (IHB) (major component), and 
weak hydrogen bonds between the methyl groups and X
 (the minor component); protonation of 
DMAN results in a +1 charge which is delocalised over the whole cation, increasing the charges at 
the methyl groups and hence their susceptibility to forming intermolecular interactions. 
Variations in the anion may generate variation in the minor component of the fragment and also 
lead to structural changes in both the cation and anion; 
 protonation of DMAN leads to structural 
changes from the neutral base including the shortening of the C1C2, C3C4, C5C6 and 
C7C8 bond lengths, lengthening of the CN distances, an increase in the ipso angles, C2C1C9 
and C9C8C7, and NCC. 
In the [Me2NHNMe2]
 X
 fragment, the PES of the major component [NHN]
 IHB has 
the shape of an asymmetric double well 
 with a low barrier potential (typically 4.5 kcal mol
for proton motion. 
 The motion of the proton in the low barrier potential appears to differ 
depending on the nature of the counter ion and aggregate state of the sample. 
 In an isolated 
DMANH
 cation, the IHB proton would be centrally located, equally shared between the two 
nitrogen atoms, or disordered over two positions. 
 Any asymmetry in the proton position can 
therefore be attributed to weak intermolecular interactions in the crystal packing. 
133, 134
 The weak 
interactions of the minor component are thought to influence the position of the proton in the IHB; 
the proton is increasingly asymmetrically located where the arrangement of the weak interactions 
is increasingly asymmetric. 
 The behaviour of the proton in the IHB may also be related to the 
proximity of X
 in the minor component. X
 may act as a second acceptor to the IHB proton 
generating a bifurcated hydrogen bond. In this bifurcated hydrogen bond, X
 is almost always 
located slightly closer to the protonated nitrogen (N1) of the IHB; the N1H X
 hydrogen bond 
angle is also usually largest. 
 The range in which X
 may be having an effect on the IHB proton 
has been investigated in neutron diffraction studies on a number of molecular complexes of 
DMAN with halo-benzoic acids. X
 appeared to have an effect on the IHB proton behaviour when 
HX
 distances were in the range of 2.61 to 2.81 ; indicated by an equivalent movement of the 
thermal ellipsoids of the two atoms along the IHB. 
Where the [Me2NHNMe2]
 X
 fragment is formed in DMAN organic acid molecular 
complexes, the crystal packing and proton transfer behaviour across the [NHN]
 hydrogen 
bond appear related, and to be tuneable, by switching the anion, X
. As discussed in 1.3.1 and 
1.3.2, this is a further example of weak interactions in the crystal packing, secondary to the strong 
and moderate hydrogen bonds, tuning proton transfer characteristics of hydrogen bonds.  
Chapter 8 investigates proton transfer effects in a number of molecular complexes of DMAN with 
halo and hydroxy benzoic acids, previously identified as containing the [Me2NHNMe2]
 X
fragment. 
 This is carried out using synchrotron X-ray diffraction with an emphasis on the effect 
of the minor interactions on proton transfer behaviour and of changing the anion on elements of 
the crystal structure and packing.  
The haloanilic acids are molecular building blocks that have also been reported to have interesting 
static proton transfer behaviour. 
 This behaviour is related to their ability to couple hydrogen 
bond formation with electron transfer and their being susceptible to different degrees of 
deprotonation (Figure 1.21).

The haloanilic acids bromanilic and chloranilic acid are strongly acidic favouring SSHB formation 
through CAHBs. With N-heterocycles (N), the anilic acids (Ac) commonly form CAHBs, 
comprising a number of hydrogen bonding motifs related to its protonated state including an

hydrogen bonds to N-heterocycle molecules on either side of the acid and an N:Ac:Ac:N motif for 
a singly deprotonated anilic acid comprised of an anilic acid hydrogen bonded dimer bifurcated on 
the deprotonated side by N-heterocycles (Figure 1.22).

Chapter 2.  
Theory 
X-ray crystallography is an important tool in confirming the results of a crystal engineering design 
strategy or in the examination of hydrogen bonds, enabling the determination of the crystal 
structure of a prepared material. The theory behind this method is presented here. 
2.1 The crystal 
The crystal is a solid phase built up of a regular arrangement of atoms in three-dimensions. 
Within this arrangement equivalent environments exist, related by translation and equally spaced, 
called lattice points; the regular array of equivalent points forms the crystal lattice.  
2.1.1 The unit cell 
Lattice points are joined in three dimensions forming a parallelopiped to define the smallest 
repeating three-dimensional unit of the crystal, called the unit cell. 
 The unit cell has three 
lengths defined by a, b and c and angles between these lengths defined by ,  and  (Figure 2.1).  
Figure 2.1 The crystal unit cell formed from four lattice points in the crystal with unit cell lengths a, b, c and angles ,  
and . 
The linking of lattice points to construct the unit cell may occur in four different ways (Figure 2.2) 
including linking at the four corners only (primitive), at the four corners with a lattice point at the 
centre of each face (face-centred), at the four corners with two extra lattice points positioned on 
opposite faces which intersect the C-axis (C-centred) and at the four corners with an extra lattice 
point at the body centre (body-centred). These are the four possible lattice types. 
Figure 2.2 Four lattice types (a) primitive P, (b) face-centred F, (c) C-centred and (d) body centred I.  
2.1.2 The seven crystal systems 
In addition to the three-dimensional translational component, the crystal lattice is affected by 
symmetry, including by rotation or reflection symmetry. The presence of these symmetries 
imposes restrictions on the unit cell lengths and angles such that only seven crystal systems, 
distinguished from one another by shape, are possible (Table 2.1). 
 For each crystal system, only 
certain lattice types (PCIF) are allowed; in total this generates 14 so-called Bravais lattices.

2.1.3 Crystal symmetry 
The symmetry of a crystal is best described by the symmetry within the unit cell; the unit cell 
repeats via translational symmetry in three dimensions to form the crystal. The unit cell is 
generated from smaller asymmetric units (asu) related to one another by a combination of 
symmetry operations. An operation is a symmetry operation if, after being carried out, the 
properties of space remain unchanged. The symmetry operations (Figure 2.3) are performed on 
symmetry elements including points, axes or planes. There are four non-translational symmetry 
operations including rotation about an axis (n-fold= 2, 3, 4 and 6), reflection through a mirror 
plane, inversion through a point and a roto-inversion involving the rotation about an axis followed 
by an inversion through a point. The two translational symmetry operations include a screw axis, 
involving the rotation about an axis followed by a translation along the axial direction, and a glide 
plane, involving the reflection of an object followed by its translation parallel to the reflection 
plane. 
Figure 2.3 Symmetry operations of (a) a 2-fold rotation (180 ), (b) a reflection, (c) an inversion, (d) a rotoinversion,  
(e) a 21 screw axis and (f) a glide plane.  
In crystals, multiple symmetry operations can co-exist; the combination of multiple non-
translational operations generates a point group, so-called since the operators leave one point 
fixed. There are 32 possible crystal point groups. The next level of symmetry includes the 
translational components. By applying the 14 translational Bravais lattice symmetries and the 
translational symmetry operations to the 32 point groups, the 230 unique ways of arranging of 
points in space are generated  these are the space groups 
143, 145
 and describe the only ways in 
which identical objects can be arranged infinitely in the crystal.  
2.1.4 Lattice planes 
As well as forming unit cells, lattice points can be linked in two-dimensions to give a lattice plane. 
Lattice planes can be defined throughout the crystal, with different orientations and separations 
(Figure 2.4). The orientation of a plane can be described by considering the intercepts a, b, c it 
makes on axes x, y, z. These points of interception are called the Weiss indices and have values 
that are unit lengths such as 1a, 1b, 1c. In the case where a plane runs parallel to an axis/axes with 
no intercept, the Weiss index has a value of infinity (). Because the Weiss indices may include 
fractions or values of , this makes their use inconvenient and so are replaced by Miller indices 
hkl which are the reciprocal values of the Weiss indices with the fractions cleared. 
 Lattice 
planes separated by the same spacing, called d-spacing, are parallel and are described by the same 
Miller indices hkl; these are a family of crystal planes hkl. 
Figure 2.4 (a) Sets of parallel lattice planes with interlayer spacings d1hkl and d2hkl and (b) a crystallographic plane 
cutting x,y,z described by Weiss indices and the corresponding Miller indices.  
2.1.5 The reciprocal lattice 
The reciprocal lattice is an alternative way to describe the direct crystal lattice; instead of a 
family of parallel crystallographic planes hkl separated by a certain d-spacing, the reciprocal lattice 
is built up of vectors (Figure 2.5). The vectors have a direction that is the normal of a family of 
crystal planes in direct space and a length that is the inverse of the hkl d-spacing, d
. A family of 
crystallographic planes may therefore be represented as a point called a reciprocal lattice point at 
the end of vector of length d
 and whose direction from the reciprocal space origin is given by the 
normal to the hkl lattice plane. 
Figure 2.5 (a) Two families of parallel crystallographic planes hkl (red = planes 1 and blue = planes 2) separated by d-
spacings d1 and d2 respectively and (b) the normal to these families of planes from a common origin with length 
  and 
Instead of being defined by a, b and c, the reciprocal lattice is defined by vectors a
 and c
is related to the direct lattice by:  
Equation 2.1   =
Equation 2.2   =   (   ) =   (    ) =   (  ) 
therefore:  
Equation 2.3     =    =    =  
Equation 2.4     =    =     =    =    =    =  
Equation 2.4 suggests that a
 is normal to the plane (b,c), b
 is normal to the plane (a,c) and c
normal to the plane (a,b). 
 A reciprocal lattice point thus defined at the end of vector d
, lies 
along the a
and c
 axes, which are the indices h, k and l. The length of the vector from the 
origin is (ha
). The reciprocal lattice is important for understanding the geometry of 
diffraction from crystals. 
2.2 Diffraction of X-rays by crystals 
2.2.1 Generation of X-rays 
X-rays may be generated via a process of accelerating electrons through a potential difference  
 (20  50 kV) and colliding them with a water cooled metal anode target. The electrons are 
generated initially from a heated filament supplied by an alternating current. The traditional 
laboratory method occurs in an evacuated X-ray tube and the anode is cooled where most of the 
electron collision energy leaves as heat. Collision of the high energy electrons on the anode target 
creates vacancies by ejecting electrons from the low-lying occupied atomic orbitals; subsequently, 
excited state electrons will drop into these vacant orbitals and the X-rays generated by this method 
are at characteristic energies (hence wavelengths) from the K and K transitions. The X-ray 
wavelengths generated are characteristic of the anode metal, and are generated alongside a 
continuous spectrum of white radiation. Usually monochromatic X-rays are employed and the K 
wavelength is selected preferentially. The most common anode metal targets in X-ray 
crystallographic studies are copper (Cu-K) and molybdenum (Mo-K) generating K wavelengths 
of 154.18 pm and 71.07 pm, respectively. 
147, 149
2.2.2 Scattering of X-rays by crystallographic planes 
The periodic nature of crystals means that they may act as a three-dimensional diffraction grating 
for X-rays; 
 the diffraction occurs from the crystal lattice planes. For a set of parallel lattice 
planes with Miller indices hkl and interplanar spacing dhkl, diffraction occurs provided several 
conditions are met. Incoming X-rays, incident to a set of lattice planes (hkl) at angle  (Figure 
2.6), will only be observed as diffracted X-rays (reflections) if they interfere constructively on 
leaving the crystal. Constructive interference only occurs when the difference in path lengths of 
the diffracted beams (EF + FG) is an integral number of wavelengths (n). 
Figure 2.6 The Bragg condition for reflection of X-rays from a set of crystal planes with a spacing, .. 
Diffracted X-rays from a set of crystal planes, dhkl, will also only be observed at particular Bragg 
angles of incidence (hkl) of the incoming beam. The Bragg equation describes fully the conditions 
for diffraction (Equation 2.5); combining the difference in path lengths and the relationship 
between dhkl and hkl. 
Equation 2.5   =   
2.2.3 The Ewald construction 
The Ewald construction may be used to determine when the Bragg diffraction conditions are met 
for a set of hkl lattice planes (Figure 2.7(a)). In the basic construction, a sphere of radius 
 , called 
the Ewald sphere (E), where  is the wavelength of the incident X-rays, is drawn with the crystal at 
the centre. Incoming X-rays pass through the centre of the sphere. The origin of the reciprocal 
lattice is placed at the point where the direct X-ray beam leaves the sphere, point O, and the 
diffraction conditions for a set of hkl lattice planes are met by rotating the reciprocal lattice about 
O until a reciprocal lattice point cuts the sphere, at point P. Diffraction is observed from the set of 
planes at point P and the direction of diffraction, the normal to a set of hkl lattice planes d
, is then 
given by drawing a line from the centre of the sphere to point P. There is a limit to the number of 
lattice points that may cut the Ewald sphere on rotating the reciprocal lattice and therefore 
reflections that may be observed. This is called the limiting sphere (L) and is achieved by 
rotating the Ewald sphere around the point where the direct beam leaves it which generates a 
larger sphere of radius 
 (Figure 2.7(b)). 
Figure 2.7 (a) The Ewald construction for meeting the Bragg condition and (b) the limiting sphere (L) of observable 
reflections.   
2.2.4 Scattering of X-rays by atoms 
The diffraction of X-rays by a crystal occurs due to the ability of the atomic electrons, within the 
crystal, to scatter X-rays. The scattering of X-rays by atoms can be described by an atomic 
scattering factor; this considers the sum of the contributions from all Z electrons; this contribution 
changes as a function of scattering angle (Equation 2.6). At a scattering angle of zero all scattered  
X-rays are in phase; the scattering amplitude is the contributions from all electrons and f is equal to 
Z. The X-rays become increasingly out of phase as the scattering angle increases such that the 
amplitude for each electron decreases and f falls off (Figure 2.8); the rate of fall off of f is affected 
by thermal motion of atoms, which modifies electron density and capacity to scatter, and is 
greatest for lighter atoms. For hydrogen, the scattering at an angle of zero is low, due to it having 
only one electron, and the fall of is rapid due to the high motion of these atoms. 
144, 148
Equation 2.6      =  
    
     
Figure 2.8 Scattering factor functions for elements iron (blue), carbon (red) and hydrogen (green). 
Thermal motion of atoms 
Atoms in a crystal are not static entities; they undergo vibrations called thermal motion about their 
equilibrium positions (dynamic disorder). This thermal motion (expressed quantitatively in terms 
of atomic displacement parameters, ADP) is inversely proportional to atomic mass and leads to a 
reduction in the scattering factor as a function of sin/. 
 The motion may be isotropic, described 
by the single parameter B (8
U) or U and models a sphere for atomic motion where motion in 
all directions is equal, or anisotropic, described by six parameters U11, U22, U33, U23, U13, U12 and 
models a three-dimensional ellipsoid for atomic motion where motion in all directions is not 
equal. 
 The thermal motion of atoms modifies atomic scattering (f) by causing the atomic 
electron density to be spread over an expanded volume such that intensity (f) is reduced.   
Equation 2.7  () = ()

2.2.5 A single crystal X-ray diffraction experiment 
In a single crystal X-ray diffraction experiment, a crystal is rotated around a fixed point in the 
incident X-ray beam. This allows the maximum number of possible reciprocal lattice points to cut 
the Ewald sphere and therefore reflections to be observed. Rotation of the crystal is achieved by 
mounting on a goniometer on a diffractometer commonly with three possible axes of crystal 
rotation including ,  and . The diffracted X-rays are observed using a detector which sweeps 
along a vertical 2 range adding a fourth rotation; 
 in modern diffractometers the detector 
angular sweep is achieved by using an area detector (Figure 2.9(a)). Diffraction, for crystal 
structure determination, is usually measured from a sample at very low temperature, typically at 
100 or 150 K. At lower temperatures, the thermal motion of atoms is reduced, leading to a 
reduction in the fall off in atomic scattering with diffraction angle. 
 Often, it is beneficial to 
collect data on a sample at both low temperature and room temperature; phase transitions or some 
other structural change may be induced in a sample between the two temperatures. The detectors 
used in single crystal experiments include image plates, 
 charged coupled devices (CCD), 
complementary metal oxide semi-conductors (CMOS) 
 and Pilatus hybrid pixel detectors. 
a typical diffraction pattern, the diffracted X-rays are observed as spots (Figure 2.9(b)).  
Figure 2.9 (a) A four circle goniometer 
 and a (b) single crystal X-ray diffraction pattern from a CCD detector.  
2.3 Crystal structure determination using X-ray diffraction 
The measurement of X-ray diffraction from a crystalline material can allow the structure of the 
material to be determined, recognising that the diffraction pattern is the Fourier transform of the 
crystal structure. This is related to the information held within the geometry and intensity of the 
diffracted X-rays in the recorded diffraction image. 
2.3.1 Pattern geometry  
The arrangement of spots in a diffraction pattern is related to both the size and shape of the unit 
cell and its crystal symmetry.  
Unit cell determination 
The distance of each diffraction spot from the centre of the diffraction pattern is proportional to 
sin. Rearranging the Bragg equation (Equation 2.8) shows that each diffraction spot is equivalent 
to a reciprocal lattice point dhkl
 (1/dhkl) at position a
 or h, k, l on the reciprocal lattice. 
Equation 2.8   =  
The position of dhkl
 can only be known if the orientation matrix is first determined. The orientation 
matrix (A) is a 3 x 3 matrix which gives the components of the reciprocal lattice (a
) in three 
directions of the goniometer axial system (Equation 2.9); the goniometer on which the crystal is 
mounted has three orthogonal axes, x points at the X-ray beam, y is at 90  to x in the horizontal 
plane and z is normal to the xy plane.  
Equation 2.9   = (
The orientation matrix may be determined by using a set of reference reflections (diffraction 
spots), whose positions are then optimised to give a set of reciprocal lattice points which are 
calculated relative to the goniometer axial system. This gives the nine elements of A. The indices 
of all reflections are generated and the unit cell parameters are then extracted from the orientation 
matrix using its transpose (Equation 2.10). 
142, 153
Equation 2.10  () =  (
.  .  . 
.  .  . 
.  .  . 
Symmetry determination 
Information about crystal symmetry may be observed from the diffraction pattern including Laue 
class and the presence of translational symmetry elements. The crystal symmetry and space group 
may be assigned by comparing the intensities of reflections which are equivalent by symmetry. 
Diffraction patterns are inherently centrosymmetric; two reflections (hkl) and (hkl) (denoted 
  ) are related to one another via an inversion centre however since only the square of the 
amplitude of the intensity can be measured, the phase is lost, then they are considered equivalent, 
as described in Friedels law. The centrosymmetric nature of the diffraction pattern limits the 
determinable symmetry to eleven Laue groups; centrosymmetric symmetries cannot be 
distinguished from non-centrosymmetric symmetries. 
Absences 
Certain subsets of reflections in the diffraction pattern have zero intensity such that they are 
considered absent; these absent reflections may also indicate information about crystal 
symmetry, being an effect of translational symmetry elements. 
 Absent reflections are caused by 
the destructive interference of X-rays for certain hkl reflections and affect a subset of reflections. 
The absence of certain reflections also occurs due to lattice centring which are called general 
absences; no absences occur in primitive lattice types whilst reflections are absent in I when the 
sum of h + k + l is odd, in A when the sum of k + l is odd, in B when the sum of h + l is odd, in C 
when the sum of h + k is odd and in F when hkl have mixed odd and even integers. Systematic 
absences occur due to the presence of translational symmetry elements of screw axes and glide 
planes, where planes of atoms are introduced part way along the cell and reflections from these 
planes interfere with those from other planes. For example, the presence of a 21 screw axis along b 
means that reflections will be absent from the 0k0 planes when k is odd. 
142, 147, 159
2.3.2 Reflection intensities 
The intensities of the light scattered from objects allows them to be observed. Larger objects 
scatter visible light however as objects get smaller, magnification and smaller wavelengths of light 
are required. Atoms in a crystal scatter X-rays from their electrons (2.2.4). The intensity of the 
scattered X-rays therefore holds information about the type and arrangement of atoms within the 
crystal. The intensities can be described by a term called the structure factor Fhkl. (Equation 2.11) 
defined as the resultant of the waves scattered by all atoms in the unit cell in the hkl direction and 
is dependent on the scattering factor fj and position (xj, yj, zj) of each atom (Equation 2.12). 
Equation 2.11      
Equation 2.12   =    
(++)=
An image of the atomic structure is then obtained in the form of the electron density (x,y,z) by a 
recombination of the structure factors Fhkl using a Fourier transform (Equation 2.13) which gives 
(x,y,z) at position x, y, z in the unit cell, where V is the volume of the unit cell. 
Equation 2.13  (, , ) =  
    
(++)
Equation 2.13 means that if the structure factors are known, the electron density distribution in the 
unit cell can be determined and the atoms located within it. In terms of the application of Equation 
2.13 to determine electron density and hence atomic positions, one significant problem is the phase 
problem; the values of Fhkl obtained from the intensities are in fact its modulus, ||. The 
amplitude of the Fhkl are thus known but their phases are unknown. Both are required for structure 
determination 
141, 149
 and so structure solution programmes aim to overcome this phase problem. 
Different methods may be employed by structure solution programs including direct methods, 
Patterson synthesis and charge flipping. The structure solution method employed in this research 
project is that of direct methods.  
2.3.3 Direct methods of crystal structure determination 
Direct methods are a trial and error method that aims to overcome the phase problem by using 
relationships between the intensities of different reflections to determine the missing phases. The 
Fhkl structure factors obtained from the diffraction experiment are first normalised (E(h)) to remove 
the effects of atomic shape. A restriction on the electron density is then imposed, (x,y,z) must be 
positive everywhere, which generates inequalities among E(h) and sets up the phase relationship 
between E(h) triplets via the Sayre Equation (Equation 2.14). 
Equation 2.14 ()   (  ) +  ()   
where h and k are reciprocal lattice vectors. 
The reflections to be used for phase determination are then selected such that the strongest E(h) are 
chosen and that each E(h) is present in as large a number of phase relationships as possible. Initial 
phases are assigned which are then used in the tangent formula (Equation 2.15), derived by Karle 
and Hauptmann, to derive new phases using a large number of the triplet relationships; this process 
is iterated until the phases are converged to stable values. 
Equation 2.15 () 
 |()()| (()+())
 |()()| (()+())
Figures of merit are calculated for each phase set allowing their quality to be indicated and those 
with the highest values are used to calculate electron density maps. The peaks in the electron 
density map are then interpreted to form an initial structural model. 
142, 153, 160
2.4 Crystal structure refinement 
The initial structural model obtained from direct methods will have substantial inaccuracies 
corresponding to incompleteness or errors in the model and in the data. To minimise these errors, 
structural parameters need to be optimised including atom types, positions and displacement 
parameters. This is done via the process of least squares structure refinement on F
. In this process 
the structure factors from the model (Fc) are compared to those from the experiment (Fo); the aim 
of the least squares refinement is to minimise the difference between the two (Equation 2.16). In 
this minimisation, each reflection is assigned a weight (w) reflecting the confidence in the 
accuracy of the measured intensity; inversely proportional to the estimated variance of the 
amplitude of F (Equation 2.17). Only the amplitudes of Fo and Fc are compared as the phases of 
the structure factors are unknown from the experiment. 
Equation 2.16   ( ||
  ||
Equation 2.17   =
(
During the least-squares procedure, the parameters to be optimised include atom types, positions 
and displacement parameters. In the initial structural model, only heavy atom types are assigned. 
Often these assignments may not be correct and should be corrected at this point; mis-assignment 
of atoms may be indicated as residual peaks around the atom, if assigned too few electrons, or as 
troughs, if assigned too many. The displacement parameters of the heavy atoms are also optimised 
from an initial isotropic model to be anisotropic. 
The progress of a refinement is monitored in residual R-factors, weighted (Equation 2.18) and non-
weighted (Equation 2.19), and a goodness of fit parameter, S (Equation 2.20). During a refinement 
these values should reduce and a complete structure is indicated by an wR2 of less than 0.2, an R-
factor in the range of 0.02 to 0.05 and a goodness of fit of 1.

2.4.1 Fourier difference maps 
If a structure is approaching completion but still has a small section undefined, remaining atoms 
may be located by calculating a Fourier difference map (x,y,z), using a derivation of Equation 
2.13, where the difference structure factors (|| - ||) are used alongside the calculated phases, 
  (Equation 2.21). The difference map (, , ) contains scattering density in Fo that has not 
been accounted for by Fc. 
Equation 2.21  (, , ) =    (||    ||)
(++)+
If all heavy atoms have been located and refined anisotropically, at this stage, the Fourier 
difference map will contain only peaks for the hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atom positions may 
often be freely refined however, the low electron density of hydrogen atoms makes their 
refinement from X-ray data much less precise; often they may instead be fixed at riding positions 
relative to the heavy atom to which they are bonded. Hydrogen atoms are also refined with 
isotropic thermal parameters from X-ray data, involving just one B or U term. This is a 
consequence of the small contribution of a hydrogen atom to the scattering; refining hydrogen 
atoms with anisotropic displacement parameters would lead to an over interpretation of the data, 
reducing the observed data to parameter ratio which would compromise the accuracy of the overall 
refinement. Hydrogen atom displacement parameters may be refined anisotropically from neutron 
data where hydrogen atoms have a larger relative contribution to the scattering. 
As well as the location of hydrogen atoms, Fourier difference maps may provide additional details 
about the structure. For high quality single crystal X-ray diffraction data, it may be possible to 
observe additional structural features including the bonding density between atoms or lone pairs.  
Fourier difference maps may also be very useful in the study of hydrogen transfer processes such 
as proton disorder (1.3.1) and migration (1.3.2). Fourier difference maps can be generated for 
selected hydrogen bonding interactions with the hydrogen atom removed from the model such that 
the hydrogen atom density is observable in the map (Figure 2.10); the density may indicate 
information about the hydrogen atom behaviour in a certain type of hydrogen bond or as a function 
of an external variable. Fourier difference maps are frequently employed in temperature dependent 
proton disorder and migration studies.

associated with the H-atom by a peak maxima in (a) a two-dimension bitmap, (b) in a three-dimensional surface. In these 
maps, the e 
 range is often between - 0.2 to 0.8 e 
Interpretation of Fourier difference maps  
The interpretation of Fourier difference maps for structure solution or the determination of proton 
behaviour may be affected by the presence of noise in the form of Fourier ripples or smearing of 
electron density. 
 The Fourier difference maps are generated from a Fourier series of the structure 
factors which in turn are derived from the diffraction intensities. The diffraction intensities are a 
measured quantity and so subject to error; the noise present in the Fourier difference maps, and 
therefore the quality of the final structure, will depend on the uncertainties in the measured 
intensities. 
 Noise in the Fourier difference maps may also occur related to the nature of the 
scattering material such as if molecules in the crystal are undergoing enhanced molecular 
vibrations, as a result of molecular disorder or due to collecting data at higher temperatures. 
Ideal diffraction data, for optimised Fourier difference maps, may be obtained when collected from 
a uniform crystal using an X-ray beam with a constant beam profile and image widths that are 
finely sliced relative to the crystal mosaicity. Background will be low whilst the intensities should 
have a high signal to noise ratio. Each reflection should be well defined and sampled multiple 
times, for an increased redundancy, and to a high resolution. The data set will also have good 
completeness.   
2.4.2 Constraints and restraints 
The optimisation of structural parameters during the refinement process may involve the use of 
constraints or restraints. Constraints involve either the use of equations to rigidly relate parameters 
or the assignment of fixed numerical values to parameters. Overall they reduce the number of 
independent refinable parameters. For example, when proton disorder is present across a hydrogen 
bond, in order to refine the ratio of the site occupancy factors for each proton site, their sum is 
constrained to unity. The fixing of hydrogen atoms using a riding model on a heavy atom involves 
a constraint applied to the DH bond lengths and DDH bond angles. Restraints are 
additional experimental observations and increase the overall number of parameters. They use a 
minimisation function involving a target value for a parameter which the actual restrained 
parameter will approach during refinement. For example, restraints may be applied to distances 
between atoms. 
2.4.3 Rigid body refinement 
Atoms in a crystal undergo vibrations. If, when within a molecule, there are only small internal 
vibrations of atoms compared with the overall movement of the molecule, then a rigid body 
refinement may be applied. A rigid body refinement involves the constrained coordinate 
refinement of one or more groups of atoms that move, by rotations or translations around a fixed 
axis, as a single body. The internal arrangement of atoms does not change. 
153, 163
 The use of a rigid 
body has the effect of reducing the number of overall refinement parameters.  
Rigid body motion and TLS tensors 
When a molecule is described by a rigid body, the vibrations of its atoms (atomic displacements) 
must be consistent with the overall molecular motion. This is the rigid body motion and it can be 
described by a harmonic approximation with translational, librational and screw components in a  
3 x 3 matrix. The translational component, described by the tensor T, includes a backwards and 
forwards oscillation in three-dimensions whilst the libration component, described by the tensor L, 
includes rotary oscillation. The screw component, described by the tensor S, includes the complete 
motion of the molecule that does not lie on the centre of symmetry in the crystal structure. 
occurs when there is correlation between the translational and librational motion such that the 
librational axes do not intersect at a single point. 
In order to describe the rigid body motion of a molecule using the TLS tensors, the x, y, z 
coordinate system must first be converted to Cartesian orthogonal, rx, ry, rz coordinates using the 
matrix [M] (Equation 2.22 and Equation 2.23): 
Equation 2.22 [] =  (
  
  
  
Equation 2.23  [
] = []   [
where A, B and C are the unit cell lengths,  and  are the unit cell angles, and sin is described 
by Equation 2.24. 
Equation 2.24   =


The T, L and S tensors are applied to the Cartesian coordinates to obtain the TLS description, in 
Cartesian format, of the heavy atom anisotropic thermal displacement parameters, U11, U22, U33, 
U23, U13 and U12 (Equation 2.25 to Equation 2.30). 
Equation 2.25

Equation 2.30 
 =    
 +  +    +  +    +
When using the TLS description, corrections to the bond lengths are also usually applied as a 
result of inter-atomic distance shrinking caused by the librational component. 
 Using the TLS 
description of molecular motion reduces the number of thermal parameters from six, for each 
atom, to 20 for the whole molecule. 
2.4.4 Parametric structure refinement 
Parametric structure refinement (originally developed in the form of parametric Rietveld 
refinement) allows a large number of data sets, collected as a function of an external variable, to be 
refined against an evolving structural model. This differs from individual and sequential analysis 
in that the structural model is fitted simultaneously to all data sets. The simultaneous refinement 
leads to a higher precision in certain refined parameters, the standard uncertainty of a parameter is 
greatly reduced when derived from a large number of data sets. The method can also allow the 
modelling of evolving behaviour across the data, help to avoid false solutions and greatly reduces 
processing time compared to individual refinement against what can be hundreds of data sets. 
The application of a parametric structure refinement is based on the idea that, on collecting a large 
set of data as a function of an external variable, certain parameters (prm) will be either common 
across the data sets or may be related, such as the evolution of an atomic position with 
temperature. These parameters may be parametrised thus reducing the parameter to data ratio. An 
example input parametric refinement file is shown in Figure 2.11. The input file contains a section 
for the refinement choices, including turning models on or off or selecting data files, sections for 
each temperature, which contain the instructions required to perform refinement against each 
individual data set, and a section which contains information applicable to all data sets including 
the structural model. Parametric refinement may be performed using the Topas-Academic V5.0. 
Figure 2.11 Schematic layout of parametric structure refinement file.  
Parametric refinement has been employed in powder X-ray diffraction studies for a number of 
purposes including to carry out quantitative phase analysis and the determination of reaction 
mechanism in a photodimerisation reaction of 9-methylanthracene, 
 tested as one of many 
refinement strategies for determining the structural evolution of As2O5 
 and to obtain a more 
reliable estimate of the optimised parameters in the study of dealumination of a zeolite catalyst. 
Of particular relevance to this research project is the work by Ting et al. (2012) using parametric 
Rietveld refinement on neutron powder diffraction data to probe hydrogen atom positions in the 
hydrous compound BaCl2.2H2O; the changes in hydrogen atom positions as a function of 
temperature could be determined and monitored using the parametric method. 
 Parametric 
structure refinement is performed on single crystal X-ray diffraction data in the study of 
temperature dependent proton migration in Chapter 7.  
2.5 Synchrotron crystallography 
Laboratory X-ray sources are appropriate in the majority of cases for routine accurate 
determination of molecular structure from a single crystal. However, where samples and 
diffraction experiments are non-routine, it can be advantageous to use synchrotron radiation at a 
synchrotron source.  
Synchrotron radiation is electromagnetic radiation covering the range from infrared to X-rays. It 
was first observed in 1947 and has been employed in research studies since the mid-1960s. 
Electromagnetic radiation is generated when a charged particle is accelerated 
 or forced along a 
circular path. 
 Electrons are charged particles and when they are accelerated to kinetic energies 
above the MeV range, and travelling close to the speed of light along a circular path, they emit 
synchrotron radiation. 
 A typical synchrotron radiation research facility (Figure 2.12) has a 
linear accelerator (LINAC) which accelerates electrons from an electron gun into a booster ring 
where they are further accelerated to the speed of light. Once at speed, the electrons are injected 
into the storage ring, which is an evacuated ring shaped chamber, in bunches. 
Figure 2.12 A typical synchrotron research facility: (a) electron gun, (b) the LINAC, (c) the booster ring, (d) the storage 
ring, (e) an insertion device, (f) a bending magnet, (g) the optics hutch, (h) the experimental hutch and (i) the control 
room. 
In the storage ring, sets of magnets are located at periodic points. Bending magnets maintain the 
electron direction of travel and speed along the circular path of the storage ring. 
 These magnets 
work on the principle that if a moving electron intersects a magnetic field which is perpendicular 
to the direction of travel, then it will experience a force perpendicular to both the direction of 
travel and the magnetic field. This force generates a centripetal acceleration causing the electron to 
move along a circular path and emit electromagnetic radiation. 
Additional sets of magnets are also located around the storage ring which produce the synchrotron 
radiation; these types of magnets determine the synchrotron generation. In third generation 
synchrotrons, the generation of the synchrotrons used in this research project, magnets called 
insertion devices are used on straight sections. There are two types of insertion devices called 
wigglers and undulators (Figure 2.13). 
Figure 2.13 Insertion devices: (a) a wiggler and (b) an undulator. 
Wigglers contain dipole magnets which emit radiation with an energy () characteristic to the 
circulating electron beam energy (E) and magnetic field (B) of the magnets. An electron beam 
passing through these magnets is wiggled periodically away from and back to its curved path. A 
compensation effect occurs along the wiggle, using a very intense magnet, and results in a greater 
radial acceleration and the production of bright white light. 
177, 179, 180
 For multipole wigglers, the 
central emitted beam brightness is proportional to the number of wiggler periods. 
Undulators contain magnets with alternating low field magnetic poles. An electron beam passing 
through these magnets undergo a series of inward and outward electron accelerations where 
radiation is emitted on each undulation. Downstream from the undulator, the emitted radiation 
may overlap interfering constructively or destructively and the result is a lumpy spectrum, where 
each lump corresponds to a particular wavelength. Undulators therefore can produce very intense 
single wavelength radiation by magnet parameter tuning. 
The nature of the synchrotron radiation is a contracted narrow fan, in the forward direction of the 
electron bunches. Where there are several electron bunches circulating horizontally, passing a 
number of magnets, there is a continuum of such fans spread out over an arc creating a final fan 
that is wider horizontally than vertically; this property gives synchrotron radiation a greater 
intensity and collimation than ordinary laboratory sources. 
 Radiofrequency (RF) cavities are 
also present in sections along the storage ring to boost electron energy and momentum that has 
been lost due to bending and electron collisions.  
The generated synchrotron radiation is utilised in beamlines, located at tangents to the storage ring 
and downstream of the insertion devices. In X-ray diffraction studies, a typical beamline set up 
includes firstly an optics hutch, which takes the synchrotron radiation emitted by a wiggler or 
undulator and carries out tuning by monochromation to select the desired wavelength of radiation 
and focusing to a desired beam size and positioning for a particular diffraction experiment. 
Monochromation of the beam is carried out using a set of two monochromator crystals, one selects 
the wavelength by the application of Braggs law whilst the other redirects the beam back to its 
original path. The beam is focused in the vertical and horizontal directions using mirrors. 
next section of a beamline is the experimental hutch where diffraction of the synchrotron X-rays 
from a sample is measured and the final section is the control room where the diffraction 
experiment is controlled and monitored. The single crystal beamlines of I19, Diamond Light 
Source. U.K. 
 and 11.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source, U.S.A. 
 are described in 4.2.6, 
respectively.  
At a synchrotron X-ray source, the nature of the radiation called synchrotron radiation differs 
from conventional laboratory source radiation by being highly intense, coherent, polarised, having 
a broad tuneable spectrum and a pulsed nature. 
 Each of these properties leads to particular 
applications. The high intensity of the X-rays means that data collections are extremely quick such 
that very fast reactions in solids can be followed 
 and the collection time for multi temperature 
or pressure experiments is significantly reduced. The pulsed-time structure of the synchrotron 
source means that time resolved studies, such as the decay of excited states may be studied. 
Synchrotron X-rays also allow a higher coverage of reciprocal space with fewer detector settings 
and facilitates measurement of weak high order reflections, important in charge density  
studies. 
184, 185
 The tuneable spectrum of wavelengths means that resonance effects at or near the 
atomic absorption edge to carry out chemically specific diffraction can be exploited. 
intensity of the synchrotron radiation also means that small and weakly diffracting samples are no 
longer lost causes but can yield data of sufficient quality to allow structure solution and 
refinement. 
2.6 Diffraction methods to follow proton transfer processes 
Proton transfer across hydrogen bonds, including proton disorder or migration, has been followed 
in the solid state using both neutron and X-ray diffraction. Neutron diffraction remains the 
definitive technique for determining precise hydrogen atom positions and identifying the presence 
of proton transfer across hydrogen bonds. 
 However, advances in X-ray detector technology 
mean that hydrogen atoms may be routinely located and atomic positions and isotropic thermal 
parameters refined from X-ray diffraction data. 
 In particular, hydrogen atom behaviour can be 
determined when visualised in Fourier difference maps. 
 A number of combined neutron and  
X-ray diffraction studies have revealed that the type of information obtained about the hydrogen 
atom behaviour is, however, not the same. This is related to the fact that the two techniques differ 
in what they observe; X-rays are scattered by atomic electrons whilst neutrons are scattered by 
atomic nuclei. When forming part of a DH bond, the position of the one electron of the 
hydrogen atom is not localised on the hydrogen atom but located preferentially in the bonding 
region and closer to the heavy atom. Therefore, in an X-ray diffraction experiment, the hydrogen 
atom bonding density, and not the nuclear position as in neutrons, is being observed. Hydrogen 
atom positions given by neutrons are also shifted by 0.13 to 0.15  relative to those from  
X-rays. 
 This creates a problem when observing the proton transfer process of temperature 
dependent proton migration where larger apparent shifts in proton position are suggested from an 
X-ray study compared to a neutron study on the same material; in a study of the 1:1 adduct of urea 
phosphoric acid, a larger shift in the proton density maximum occurred with temperature in the  
X-ray data (0.1 ) versus in the neutron data (0.04 ). 
 Fourier difference maps will also reveal 
different information for the two techniques where those from X-ray data contain the bonding 
density whilst those from neutron data contain the nuclear density. X-rays therefore give 
information about electron sharing and thermal effects, whilst neutron data indicates thermal 
effects only. 
Due to hydrogen atoms being less precisely located by X-rays, standard uncertainties on bond 
lengths involving hydrogen atoms 
 and on hydrogen atom site occupancies are greater than for 
those in neutron refinement; for bond lengths the standard uncertainties are typically in the second 
decimal place for X-rays compared with the third for neutrons, while site occupancies have 
standard uncertainties of approximately 10% for X-rays 
 compared to approximately 1% for 
neutrons. 
 The difference in intensity of scattering between the two techniques also affects the 
information being observed about the hydrogen atom. In X-rays, hydrogen atoms have a low 
scattering intensity, where the one electron only is present. In contrast, in neutrons the scattering 
power, called the scattering length, is related to the properties of the nucleus which is strong for a 
hydrogen atom. This means that it is possible to refine hydrogen atoms anisotropically from 
neutron data whilst only isotropic refinement is possible from X-rays. Due to the neutrons 
interacting with nuclei rather than diffuse electrons in X-rays, there is also no fall off in scattering 
as a function of scattering angle, only that due to thermal motion of atoms. This means structural 
details about the hydrogen atom can be studied to a higher resolution in neutrons. 
Despite the different observations made by X-rays and neutrons, several combined diffraction 
studies of proton transfer across hydrogen bonds have shown that overall observed trends may be 
the same. Similar trends have been indicated in Fourier difference maps of hydrogen bonds 
including in the 1:1 adduct of urea phosphoric acid, where the hydrogen atom density was seen to 
migrate across the bond with temperature in both X-ray and neutron Fourier difference maps; the 
effect was clearer in the X-ray maps (Figure 2.14), 
 and in cyclic hydrogen bonded dimers of 
3,5-DNBA polymorph II where the emergence of proton disorder in the form of a second site in 
the dimer hydrogen bond was indicated in both X-ray and neutron Fourier difference maps at 
300 K. 
Figure 2.14 Fourier difference maps at 150 and 350 K for the (a) neutron and (b) X-ray structures of the OHO 
SSHB in the 1:1 adduct of urea phosphoric acid. The SSHB hydrogen atom is indicated by a peak maxima. 
Similar trends have also been observed in the occupancies of proton positions in X-ray and neutron 
proton disorder studies. One combined X-ray and neutron study on proton disorder in 4-DABA 
3,5-DNBA demonstrated that it may be possible to refine hydrogen atom site occupancies 
provided high quality X-ray data are obtained. In this study, refined hydrogen occupancy values 
from X-ray data were in agreement with those from neutron data, at all temperatures. 
 In 3,5-
DNBA polymorph II, the proton occupancies between the two techniques were also shown to 
follow the same trend of the second site increasing in occupancy with temperature; the final 
occupancy values at 300 K differed slightly (X-ray 72:28, neutron 81(2):19(2)) but were 
considered as being within the estimated 10 % error for the X-ray values. 
 The uncertainty in 
occupancy values from X-rays may be considered greater than this due to the small amount of 
electron density associated with each position and frequently Fourier difference maps are a more 
reliable route to extracting information on proton disorder. 
 In the case of dibenzoylmethane, 
there was no overall agreement in the observed trends found from neutron and X-ray structures. 
The nuclear density in variable temperature neutron Fourier difference maps showed an 
asymmetric hydrogen atom position which was invariant with temperature whilst electron density 
in variable temperature X-ray Fourier difference maps suggested a migration from an asymmetric 
position at low temperature to a symmetric position at room temperature. 
Overall, the two diffraction techniques are in the most part complementary and where combined 
give a more complete picture of the proton transfer and hydrogen bonding; neutron diffraction 
probes the structural framework (positions of the atomic nuclei forming the molecule) whilst  
X-rays probe the bonding and therefore the chemistry. There is evidence to suggest, however, that 
X-ray diffraction offers potential in these studies of proton transfer. All previous diffraction 
studies of proton transfer processes have been carried out using neutron diffraction or a laboratory 
X-ray diffractometer. It would be advantageous if synchrotron X-ray diffraction could routinely be 
used in the study of proton transfer processes where X-rays are able to reveal interesting 
information about proton transfer processes. The high intensity of synchrotron X-rays means, for 
the multi temperature measurements which are usually carried out in the study of proton transfer, a 
greatly reduced data collection time compared to neutron and laboratory diffraction experiments. 
The number of samples that can be studied is also hugely increased at a synchrotron and, where 
the X-rays are stronger in intensity, the large crystal requirements of neutrons are not an issue. 
Synchrotron X-ray diffraction is applied in this research project in the study of temperature 
dependent proton disorder (Chapter 5) and proton migration (Chapter 7) processes and low 
temperature proton transfer behaviour (Chapter 8). 
2.7 Powder X-ray diffraction 
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is an alternative diffraction technique carried out on poly 
crystalline (powder) samples. It is usually a fixed  method with a varying  and is based on the 
tendency of powder samples to be comprised of randomly oriented micro crystallites such that on 
exposure to X-rays, the Bragg condition is satisfied for a number of different hkl crystal planes 
simultaneously. The diffracted X-rays are observed as Debye Scherrer cones as a result of 
diffraction occurring from the same hkl crystal plane in a number of crystallites. 
 Detectors 
either record the whole of the diffraction cones, or take a vertical or horizontal slice. The cones or 
cone slices are then integrated to give the characteristic PXRD pattern containing peaks for 
reflections from particular hkl crystal planes at 2 positions related to the dhkl with intensity Ihkl 
(Figure 2.15).  
Figure 2.15 Diffraction of a powder crystalline product, its detection and data conversion to a PXRD pattern.  
The diffraction observed by PXRD therefore differs to that observed by single crystal X-ray 
diffraction as the three-dimensional distribution of peaks is compressed down to one-dimensional 
lines. There is a significant loss of information in doing so, caused by an overlap of reflections 
from crystal planes of the same or similar d-spacing; this means that information on intensities and 
positions of the diffraction maxima is obscured. Crystal structure determination is thus less straight 
forward from PXRD data than from single crystal X-ray diffraction data. 
 The determination of 
unit cell parameters from a PXRD pattern is, however, relatively straight forward, provided good 
resolution of diffraction peaks. The unit cell determination process involves an initial peak 
selection, fitting and indexation process, using the positions of the maxima of typically the first 
twenty peaks to obtain the unit cell. A profile fitting technique, such as that of Pawley or LeBail is 
carried out which results in more accurate determinations of cell parameters by the refinement of 
variables that describe the different features of the diffraction pattern including the unit cell 
parameters, the background intensity and peak widths, shapes and intensities. 
 PXRD can be 
important when it is not possible to grow single crystals of a material, offering either the potential 
for the determination of unit cell parameters or, in favourable cases, structure solution.  
PXRD has a number of applications related to the features of a PXRD pattern. Peak positions and 
their relative intensities serve as a fingerprint for any crystalline material. This means that a 
PXRD pattern of a sample can identify the presence of a single component, a mixture and its phase 
composition, 
 structural changes as a function of an external variable such as temperature leading 
to new materials 
 or the preferred orientation of crystallites by a distortion of peak intensities. 
Preferred orientation may occur in a powder sample when crystallite shape is increasingly 
anisotropic, such as plate or needle-like, resulting in distinctly non-random orientations due to 
natural preferences in packing of the anisotropic particles. The orientation of the crystallites is less 
random creating preferred orientation axes from which the intensity of reflections with reciprocal 
lattice vectors parallel to these axes are distorted. 
2.8 Thermal analysis of solids 
The thermal analysis of a solid may allow its thermal properties to be determined. Once the 
structure of a material is obtained using X-ray crystallographic methods, it is then possible to link 
any observed properties to its structure. Thermal properties of crystalline materials frequently 
include thermally induced phase transitions. A phase transition involves the conversion of one 
phase of a substance to another phase and is often accompanied by a change in enthalpy; the 
rearrangement of atoms or molecules usually requires the intake (endothermic process) or results 
in the release (exothermic process) of energy. 
 In crystalline materials, thermal transformations 
include solid to liquid (melting), liquid to solid (recrystallisation) and solid to solid 
transformations; the last of these can correspond to structural rearrangement such as transition 
between polymorphs or loss of trapped guest molecules such as solvents. 
 By performing thermal 
analysis on materials, it may be possible to understand the structural transformations occurring. 
2.8.1 Differential scanning calorimetry 
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a thermal analysis method which allows the thermal 
properties of a crystalline material to be studied and quantified.  
A heat-flux DSC is commonly used to study crystalline samples. A typical heat-flux DSC set up 
involves a sample chamber, isolated from the external environment, and two disks that operate as 
temperature sensors and heaters (sample and reference). The crystalline sample is enclosed in a 
pan and placed on the sample heater whilst an empty sealed pan is placed on the reference heater 
(Figure 2.16). 
Figure 2.16 Sample chamber used in DSC, including sample and reference pans placed on sample disks connected to 
temperature sensors and heaters.  
The sample disks with sensor/heater components work together in two control loops. One loop 
acts to increase the temperature of the sample and reference pans, during an experiment, at the 
same constant rate, which is recorded. The second ensures that, if a temperature difference occurs 
between the sample and the reference, as a result of a phase transition, the heat input is adjusted to 
remove this difference. The sensor records this difference between the heat flow to the sample and 
reference (dH/dt) during an experiment as a function of temperature. 
 The heat flow is affected 
by the heat flux (dQ/dt), the heat capacity of the sample including the pan, Cs, the heat capacity of 
the reference including the pan, CR, the temperature at constant pressure, TP, and the thermal 
resistance of heat transfer to the chamber disks, R (Equation 2.31). A positive value of (dH/dt) 
corresponds to an absorbed thermal energy, caused by an endothermic transformation, whilst a 
negative value of (dH/dt) corresponds to a release of thermal energy, caused by an exothermic 
transformation. When (dH/dt) is null (no transformation), the heat capacity of the sample can be 
obtained using Equation 2.31. 
193, 194
 Equation 2.31  (
) =  (
) + (  ) (
)   (
Examples of the type of endo and exothermic transitions observed in a typical (exo up) DSC 
curve are shown in Figure 2.17. Endothermic transitions occur as dips whilst exothermic 
transitions occur as peaks. Types of endothermic transitions include solid to liquid transformations 
such as melting and loss of trapped guest molecules such as desolvation. In these transitions, the 
atoms/molecules take in energy in order to break away from the rigid structure. Types of 
exothermic transitions include liquid to solid transformations such as recrystallisation and often 
occur after a melt. 
 DSC curves can provide information about these transformations such as the 
onset temperature, the heat related to the transformation and transformation rate. 
Figure 2.17 A DSC curve showing endo and exothermic transitions observed in crystalline materials.  
DSC has a number of applications in addition to identifying thermal transitions including in the 
detection and determination of relative stability of polymorphic solid forms of a material, indicated 
by melting points (the higher melting polymorph is the more thermodynamically stable) 
identifying inclusion behaviour in materials; broad endotherms in the DSC curves indicate guest 
release. 
2.8.2 Thermogravimetric analysis 
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) permits the mass of a crystalline sample to be continuously 
weighed as a function of temperature. 
 This is achieved in a setup which involves the sample 
being placed in a tared crucible on a precision balance which is positioned in a furnace (Figure 
2.18). The precision balance records the mass of the sample during the experiment.  
Figure 2.18 A TGA setup, coupled with a mass spectrometer.  
In a TGA experiment, frequently the mass loss of a material is followed with temperature and the 
results are plotted in a mass loss curve (Figure 2.19) of sample weight% (Equation 2.32) versus 
temperature; mass loss is indicated by a step in the curve.  
Figure 2.19 A typical TGA mass loss curve with temperature; each step corresponds to a mass loss from the sample.  
Equation 2.32 % =  

where Mi is the initial sample mass and MT is the sample mass at temperature, T.  
TGA may allow a number of characteristics of a material to be determined. Thermal stability of a 
material is indicated by the temperature of the first mass loss step (if any). 
 If a material is multi-
component and the sample is pure, the size of each of the mass loss steps can indicate the ratio of 
components 
 as well as the decomposition pathway of the material, including revealing its 
kinetics. 
 TGA may also indicate the ability of solids to retain guests and the temperature of 
their release. 
TGA coupled with mass-spectrometry 
By coupling TGA with mass spectrometry, it is possible to confirm the identity of the component 
lost in a single mass loss step observed in TGA and indicated by endothermic events in DSC 
curves. In setting up the TGA-MS experiment, the mass spectrometer can be programmed to detect 
signals from certain molecular fragments as a function of TGA experiment time. 
 The technique 
is particularly useful in confirming guest loss from inclusion compounds.

Aims and Objectives 
In the research project upon which this thesis reports, the use of the technique of synchrotron  
X-ray diffraction is explored for the study of proton transfer processes in hydrogen bonded 
molecular complexes. These processes play an important role in a number of biological, chemical 
and physical phenomena. By the study of proton transfer processes in model systems, including 
those exhibiting both dynamic (proton disorder and migration) and static proton transfer 
behaviour, additional insight into the subtleties of these processes will be found. In particular, in 
this research project, we are interested to find where the hydrogen bonds form that exhibit proton 
transfer and what may tune their transfer behaviour; thereby revealing the perturbation effects on 
the hydrogen bond potential energy surface. 
Synchrotron X-ray diffraction is not commonly employed in the study of proton transfer processes; 
the method of choice is that of neutron diffraction, allowing a more reliable determination of 
hydrogen atom behaviour. However, there is a precedent for its application in these studies in 
previous work by Jones et. al. (2013) 
 which demonstrated that it is possible to observe 
equivalent trends in the proton transfer behaviour from X-ray data as that found from neutron data. 
There are many benefits to using the synchrotron method, and the associated high source 
brilliance, in these studies including offering the potential to collect very high quality data, for 
obtaining good quality Fourier difference maps in which the determination of hydrogen atom 
behaviour is most reliable for X-ray diffraction, and offering a rapid sample throughput, beneficial 
in proton transfer studies which are usually carried out as a function of temperature or over a range 
of molecular complexes and therefore require multiple measurements. In contrast to neutron 
diffraction, the probing of the electron density by X-ray diffraction, allows additional information 
about the evolving chemistry of the hydrogen bond to be found. It is hoped that this research 
project can contribute to making routine the use of synchrotron X-ray diffraction for the reliable 
determination of proton transfer behaviour such that the additional subtleties can be explored.  
Two interlinked strands, therefore, comprise the work in this research project, namely (i) a crystal 
engineering component to target the design of materials (model systems) in which proton transfer 
behaviour may be studied and (ii) the application of synchrotron X-ray diffraction in the study of 
the proton transfer behaviour in those molecular complexes prepared. In a third strand (iii), the 
tuning of proton transfer behaviour will be explored. 
For (i), the crystal engineering strand of the research project is driven by the need to have systems 
in which proton transfer behaviour can be studied by the synchrotron X-ray diffraction technique, 
in order to allow the development of this methodology. The molecular complexes in this research 
project are accessed via considered and developed crystal engineering strategies which target 
proton transfer effects. In these strategies, the hydrogen bond and weaker interactions are 
important; the potential of the hydrogen bond to exhibit a number of functions is also explored.  
In carrying out (ii) there are a number of focus points. These include exploring the potential of the 
synchrotron technique in the study of a number of proton transfer processes including the dynamic 
processes of proton disorder, proton migration and the static process of proton transfer at different 
synchrotron sources including the Diamond Light Source, U.K. 
 and Advanced Light Source, 
U.S.A. 
 A number of data collection strategies are explored to optimise the use of the synchrotron 
technique in these studies. Different methods of crystal refinement, including implementing a 
parametric method in Topas-Academic V5.0, 
 are also investigated. 
The strands of (i) and (ii) have consequences for (iii), affecting the potential to rationalise the 
proton transfer behaviour; in particular, this requires the reliable determination of the proton 
transfer behaviour using the synchrotron technique. Tuning effects are thus investigated for a 
number of proton transfer processes in the range of solid state organic molecular complexes 
including those of crystal packing, hydrogen bond donor-acceptor distances and variations in the 
molecular components.  
Chapter 4.  
Techniques and Instrumentation 
Chapter 4 details the range of techniques and instrumentation used for the preparation and 
characterisation of the materials under study in this research project in order to realise the research 
goals outlined in Chapter 3. This is a general overview whilst the more specific details are 
included in an experimental section in each results chapter. 
4.1 Materials preparation 
Due to the focus of this research project on single crystal X-ray diffraction methods, the primary 
aim of the materials preparation was the growth of good quality single crystals of target materials. 
The target materials were multi-component crystalline molecular complexes.  
The required characteristics of the single crystal, including size and quality, were further governed 
by the diffraction source employed; related to the intensity of the source. At high intensity 
synchrotron sources, diffraction data can be measured from smaller single crystal samples (less 
than 50  in all dimensions) compared to on an in-house laboratory source (crystal dimensions of 
100 to 200 ), where X-ray intensity is lower. The higher intensity of X-rays at a synchrotron 
source also means that this method is more sensitive than the home sources to crystal defects such 
as mosaic spread, defined as the degree of alignment and identical nature of the crystal unit 
cells, 
 or tiny crystallites on the surface of the crystal and so requires crystals of higher quality. 
Single crystallinity was also important for materials characterisation via the non-diffraction 
technique of hot stage microscopy (HSM). Analysing a single crystal in HSM ensures thermal 
transitions are clearly observed and can be attributed to a pure material. For some of the 
characterisation techniques performed during the work in this research project, the growth of 
micro crystalline powders was sufficient. These techniques include powder X-ray diffraction 
(PXRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis coupled with 
mass spectrometry (TGA-MS); for PXRD, the sample was required to be highly micro crystalline 
for a good resolution of diffraction peaks to observe changes in the diffraction peak positions for 
example as a result of a phase change.  
4.1.1 Crystallisation 
The growth of single crystals of single and multi-component molecular complexes is achieved via 
the process of crystallisation. A number of crystallisation methods are commonly employed 
including the slow evaporation of solvent (evaporative crystallisation), vapour diffusion, slow 
cooling and using batch or continuous methods. 
195, 202
The molecular complexes in this research project were prepared via evaporative crystallisation, a 
simple method that is commonly employed for single crystal growth and one that is largely 
successful, 
 though it may be affected by crystallisation parameter variation. 
 The general 
experimental procedure of evaporative crystallisation involves the dissolution of target 
components in a 7 mm
 glass vial with a 1 to 2 ml of volatile solvent. The target components are 
present in chosen stoichiometric ratios and usually with masses of each component in the range of 
20 to 50 mg (1.25 to 2.5 x 10
 mol). The stoichiometric ratios are often varied including a 
common choice of 1:1, 1:2 or 2:1 ratios, which may lead to variation in the ratio of the 
components in the formed molecular complex; the stoichiometric ratio of components in the 
crystallisation is, however, not always carried through to the molecular complex formed. Complete 
dissolution of components is important to allow recrystallisation of a new multi-component 
material from solution. 
 Dissolution is achieved either by agitation by hand, where components 
are more soluble, or using a sonicator with gentle heating, where solubility of components was 
lower. The crystallisation vial is sealed with a plastic cap in which holes are pierced (6 to 10 holes) 
to aid the slow evaporation of solvent. The sealed crystallisation vial should then ideally be left 
undisturbed during the crystallisation process. This may be at ambient temperature or in a 
controlled temperature environment. Over a period of time, the solvent evaporates from the vial 
increasing the concentration of the components in solution. Crystallisation then occurs when the 
concentration reaches supersaturation and the point of crystal nucleation (Figure 4.1). Single 
crystal samples may be taken from solution for analysis or the crystallisation vials may be left to 
dry completely at ambient conditions until studied.   
Figure 4.1 Crystallisation via the slow evaporation of solvent.  
A number of parameters can be varied in the crystallisation procedure which may affect the sample 
reaching the supersaturation and crystal nucleation points; this has consequences for crystal 
growth and crystallisation outcome. 
 Variations in the crystallisation procedure may therefore 
allow different crystal forms to be accessed or, where some crystallisation conditions are more 
successful than others, allow improved crystal growth. In the preparation of the molecular 
complexes during the experimental work conducted in this research project, the parameters of 
solvent and temperature were varied.  
The choice of solvent in evaporative crystallisation can affect the crystallisation outcome related to 
component solubility, in a chosen solvent, as well as its volatility. Polar and non-polar, protic and 
aprotic solvents were trialled in the molecular complex preparation component of the research 
project including methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, acetone, tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethyl acetate, 
water, diethyl ether, hexane and cyclohexane. In some cases, a combination of solvents was 
employed. Before each crystallisation experiment, the solubility of the target components in each 
solvent was trialled; the solubility of components in certain solvents is largely affected by their 
polarity where like usually dissolves in like. Solubility is important, since in order for 
recrystallisation of a component from solution, it must first be dissolved. Ideally, moderate and 
similar solubilities of the target components is preferred; in a two component solution, if one 
component is more soluble in the crystallisation solvent than the other, the less soluble component 
is likely to recrystallize alone first and without molecular complex formation. It is also important 
to consider the volatility of the solvent as this may affect evaporation rate which has consequences 
for crystal formation; solvents with a lower volatility evaporate more slowly whilst slower 
evaporation rates yield larger crystallites. In some cases, solvent may be co-crystallised alongside 
the target materials occupying holes in the crystal lattice; this may lead to the formation of 
hydrates or solvent inclusion complexes.  
The choice of crystallisation temperature in evaporative crystallisation may also affect the 
crystallisation outcome related to the rate of solvent evaporation at each temperature; solvent 
evaporation occurs more quickly at higher temperatures whilst a quicker evaporation rate leads to 
the formation of smaller crystallites. A range of temperatures were trialled in the molecular 
complex preparation component of the research project including at 5, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 C. 
The elevated temperatures (25 to 50 C) were achieved using welled hot-plates (Figure 4.2) which 
were set to be held at a fixed temperature. The crystallisation vial was placed into a hot-plate well 
until all solvent was evaporated, at which point the sample is removed from the hot plate as further 
heating may lead to degradation of the sample. Crystallisation vials were also placed in the fridge, 
at 5 C; this slowed the rate of evaporation and crystal formation.  
Figure 4.2 Welled hot plates for crystallisation at elevated temperatures of 25, 30, 40 and 50 C. 
Once crystalline precipitates have formed, it may be favourable to test their stability to solvation; 
solvation may lead to solvent inclusion complexes. A method of vapour diffusion is employed and 
involves placing single crystal or powdered samples of a material into a vial into a sealed solvent 
environment (Figure 4.3). Over time, the solvent vapourises and diffuses into the dry sample, 
where the solvent concentration is low. This can lead to a solvated material.  
Figure 4.3 The process of vapour diffusion of solvent. 
In this setup both the temperature and solvent choice can be varied, altering the rate of vapour 
diffusion; an increased temperature or volatility of the solvent increases the rate of vapour 
diffusion. Vapour diffusion was carried out in this research project to attempt the formation of 
solvent inclusion materials from non-solvated forms. The set up involved placing a powdered 
sample of a material in an open 7 mm
 vial in a 100 ml sealed bottled with approximately 20 ml of 
solvent and leaving for up to 24 hours at a range of temperatures.  
4.1.2 Crystal evaluation 
The precipitates resulting from the crystallisation trials carried out in this research project were 
initially evaluated using optical microscopy. This method allows a range of information about the 
precipitates to be determined including crystalline nature and identity. This aids in determining the 
next appropriate experimental steps; indicating the most suited characterisation method for each 
precipitate or the need for additional crystallisation experiments.  
The crystalline nature of the precipitate could be identified whether single crystals, micro 
crystalline powders or oils were formed. For those forming single crystals, their suitability for 
single crystal X-ray diffraction studies can be assessed in the quality of the crystal edges and faces 
or on crystal manipulation such as by cutting. The formation of non-single crystalline products in 
some cases, such as powders and oils, may indicate the need for the investigation of different 
crystallisation conditions. Where powders are formed, they may be characterised using powder  
X-ray diffraction (4.3).  
Information about the likely identity of the products may also be found using optical microscopy. 
A new product, whether single or multi-component, may be identified if there is a change in 
morphology or colour in the crystallisation product from the starting materials. The presence of a 
single morphology product formed from a two component crystallisation may indicate the 
formation of a multi-component system. The presence of multiple phases with differing 
morphologies and/or colours in the crystallisation vial may indicate the formation of multiple 
products. This could be an indication that a molecular complex has not formed and that the starting 
materials have crystallised separately. Additionally, a molecular complex may have formed 
alongside a starting material or molecular complexes of different crystal forms are present.  
Of the crystalline precipitates formed from the crystallisation trials carried out in this research 
project, characterisation of single crystal samples was carried out using single crystal X-ray 
diffraction (4.2) whilst powder crystalline samples were characterised using powder X-ray 
diffraction (4.3). 
4.2 Single crystal X-ray diffraction 
Single crystal X-ray diffraction was performed on suitable single crystal samples resulting from 
the materials preparation component of this research project. Unit cell screening was first carried 
out on suitable single crystals resulting from the crystallisation trials via single crystal X-ray 
diffraction analysis to identify where new products had formed. The unit cell of the crystal under 
study was compared to those in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) 
 to confirm the 
formation of a new crystal structure, previously unreported and different to that of the starting 
materials or existing molecular complexes. Where a new crystal structure was indicated, single 
crystal X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out for crystal structure determination. The structures 
presented in subsequent chapters were determined using single crystal X-ray diffraction, 
conducted using both laboratory and synchrotron sources; the synchrotron sources were employed 
for variable temperature or high throughput measurements. The experimental procedure was 
generally the same for both types of source. 
4.2.1 Sample selection 
The selection of single crystals for diffraction studies is carried out using polarised light 
microscopy. A good single crystal sample is one that appears visually of good quality with well-
defined crystal edges and faces and free from tiny crystallites or cracks. Single crystallinity is 
important for the diffraction to occur as individual reflections 
 and is indicated for a crystal 
when extinguishing in plane polarised light on a 90  rotation. A good single crystal sample is also 
one that is of a certain size or one that can be cleanly cut to the appropriate size. Typically, crystal 
sizes with dimensions of 100 to 200  are recommended for laboratory sources whilst less than  
50  can be measured at synchrotron sources; crystal size is dependent on X-ray source size as 
well as goniometer head sphere of confusion. The selected crystal is mounted on a glass fibre or 
loop attached to a magnetic mount using either fomblin or glue depending on the nature of the 
experiment. The magnetic mount is then placed on the diffractometer goniometer head. The 
temperature of the diffraction experiment is set and, once at the desired temperature, the crystal is 
centred in the X-ray beam position by adjustments to the vertical and horizontal axes of the 
goniometer head.  
4.2.2 Screening, data collection and data processing 
The process of collecting diffraction data from a single crystal, once mounted and centred at the 
desired temperature, involves a number of stages including crystal screening, data collection and 
data processing.  
Initial screening is carried out via a pre-experiment which involves the collection of a number of 
diffraction images from the crystal, when rotated through different positions. These screen images 
have a number of uses including indicating the diffraction quality of the sample, the identity of 
material forming the crystal (whether something new or previously reported) and the strategy 
required to collect a complete data set to allow crystal structure determination; all important 
factors for deciding whether or not to proceed to the data collection stage with a sample. The 
diffraction quality of the crystal is assessed in the intensity, peak shape and resolution of the 
reflections on the diffraction images. A crystal of good diffraction quality has reflections that have 
a good intensity and occur to a high resolution (typically dmin < 0.84 ), that do not overload at 
low angle and which are not split. The reflections from the screen images are assigned hkl indices 
and used to determine the orientation matrix, unit cell parameters (a, b, c, , , ) and Bravais 
lattice via an auto-indexing procedure. At this stage, the determined unit cell parameters should be 
checked against those of existing materials to confirm a new material has been formed before 
commencing the data collection stage.  
Once a new material is confirmed and a crystal of good diffraction quality is found, a full data 
collection for crystal structure determination can be carried out. A recommended data collection 
strategy is output at the end of the pre-experiment. The strategy suggests the required exposure 
time per diffraction image to obtain diffraction data to the required resolution, values of I/ and 
completeness for accurate structure determination from the data collection. These parameters may 
change depending on experimental requirements but are typically d-spacing 0.8  resolution, an 
I/ of 15, a redundancy of 5 and a completeness of 98 %. The extent of reciprocal space to be 
accessed during the data collection is also decided on, in terms either of the requirements of the 
unique data for the particular crystal system or in portions of the limiting sphere. The collection of 
a full hemisphere of data, if time allows, is recommended as this allows all unique data to be 
accessed even for the lowest symmetry triclinic system. The width of the diffraction image should 
also be considered depending on crystal mosaicity; image width should be less than the crystal 
mosaicity to enhance reflection sampling. The time for a full data collection may be affected by 
sample size and quality or X-ray source intensity and can be anything between 2 to 24 hours for 
laboratory diffractometers whilst for synchrotron sources the data collection can be completed in 
as little as 10 minutes. In some cases, the recommended full data collection time may be longer 
than the available experimental time; in these cases it is worth restarting the screening process. 
The result of the data collection process is a list of reflections that have assigned hkl Miller indices 
and a measured intensity. Each intensity has an associated standard uncertainty (I) which 
indicates the precision and reliability of the experiment; affected by both X-ray generation and 
diffraction experiment processes.  
The data is processed via a data reduction method that involves a number of stages. A 
redetermination of the unit cell is carried out via indexing of the Bragg reflections to determine 
their Miller indices hkl over a larger portion of the data and to obtain an improved set of unit cell 
parameters. This is followed by an integration step which integrates the intensity, in pixel counts, 
of each hkl reflection across the diffraction images. The intensities are corrected for background 
counts, these are estimated and removed, followed by additional Lorentz-polarization and 
absorption corrections. 
 A merging and averaging process of the repeated and symmetry 
equivalent data is then carried out to produce a set of unique and scaled data. The final intensities 
are converted to observed structure amplitudes |
2| (Equation 2.11) and the output is a list of 
reflections with hkl indices, intensity |
2| and with standard error |
Data collection and processing were performed in this research project using a number of software 
packages including Rigaku 
 CrystalClearTM, 
 Rigaku Oxford Diffraction 
 CrysAlisPro, 
DIALS 
 in Xia2, 
 Bruker AXS 
 Apex2 
 with SADABS 
 and Bruker AXS 
XPREP. 
4.2.3 Crystal structure solution and refinement 
The theory of structure solution and refinement is described in 2.3 and 2.4, respectively. The 
process involves the location of atoms in the unit cell from the diffraction data for structure 
solution followed by optimisation of the solved structure via refinement.  
In this research project, all crystal structures were solved by direct methods (2.3.3) using the 
program SHELXS-2013 
 followed by crystal structure refinement via a least-squares method 
using SHELXL-2013. 
 Where necessary, the programme PLATON 
 was used to check the 
space group assignment. All programs were used within the WinGX program suite. 
 In general, 
non-hydrogen atoms were refined freely with anisotropic thermal parameters. All hydrogen atoms 
were refined with isotropic thermal parameters and treated by a mixed of independent and 
constrained refinements. The specific refinement details for the treatment of the hydrogen atoms of 
interest are included in the experimental sections of each chapter. Crystal structures were viewed 
and analysed using the structure visualisation program Mercury. 
 The imaging of the hydrogen 
atom scattering density is carried out in two dimensional Fourier difference maps in the region of 
specific hydrogen bonds generated with the hydrogen atom of interest removed from the structural 
model. The Fourier difference maps are viewed in MAPVIEW within WinGX. 
 Additional 
programmes were used for crystal structure refinement via alternative methods. Jana2006 
employed to allow the TLS refinement of anisotropic displacement parameters. In the refinement, 
a fully refined starting model from SHELXL-2013 
 was input in which the hydrogen atom 
positions were recalculated and refined and each molecular component was modelled as a rigid 
body with TLS refined anisotropic displacement parameters.   
Topas-Academic V5.0  
Crystal structure refinement was also carried out in this research project using the program Topas-
Academic V5.0. 
 Topas-Academic V5.0 
 is a non-linear least squares system driven by a 
scripting language which may be employed in the fields of crystallography, solid state chemistry, 
optimisation and function minimisation. Its main features include a computer algebra system for 
function minimisation and linear/non-linear constraint applications, least squares refinement 
(including Rietveld methods) for single crystal and powder diffraction data (laboratory, neutron 
and synchrotron), a simulated annealing algorithm for structure solution from single crystal and 
powder X-ray diffraction data, an indexing algorithm and a command line TC.exe for batch data 
processing. 
 In this research project, Topas-Academic V5.0 
 was used for the purpose of 
single crystal structure refinement. The advantage of its use in this work, over standard single 
crystal refinement packages, is the potential to perform parametric refinements (2.4.4) in which a 
single structure is refined simultaneously against a number of datasets.  
The single crystal structure refinement method is based on the method originally developed for 
parametric Rietveld refinement, most commonly used in powder X-ray diffraction and one of the 
final stages of crystal structure determination via this method. Rietveld refinement employs a 
least-squares method M (Equation 4.1) to obtain the best fit between the experimental powder 
diffraction pattern (yobs) and that calculated (ycalc) from a trial structure (this must be a good 
representation of the correct crystal structure to avoid leading to false minima); every point along 
the observed and calculated profiles are considered as an intensity measurement and compared. 
Equation 4.1  =  (  )
where yiobs and yicalc are the intensity of the i
 data point in the experimental and calculated powder 
diffraction profiles, respectively, and wi is a weighting factor for the i
 data point. 
The powder pattern is calculated for the trial structural model using the information of (1) the 
lattice parameters (to determine peak positions), (2) atomic positions and thermal parameters, (3) 
2-dependent functions that describe peak shape (affected by features of both the instrument and 
sample) and width and (4) a description of the background intensity. Selected parameters are 
adjusted by the least-squares refinement method to achieve the best fit between the observed and 
calculated powder patterns (Equation 4.1); achieved by turning parameters on or off within the 
input file. Additional parameters related to the sample, including sample height, may additionally 
be refined. The refinement is driven in Topas-Academic V5.0 
 by an instruction file (inp file), 
edited in an external text editor programme JEdit V4.3, 
 which connects to the Topas-Academic 
The agreement between the observed and calculated powder patterns is assessed by an R-factor 
Rwp (Equation 4.2); a good fit is indicated by Rwp values within the region of 5 to 20 %. 
 A visual 
comparison is also made on plotting the observed and calculated patterns alongside a difference 
curve (yobs  ycalc) (Figure 4.4); the smaller the difference curve the better the fit. 
Equation 4.2  =   (
 (()())
 (())
Figure 4.4 A plot of yobs, ycalc and the yobs  ycalc difference curve versus 2. 
In a single crystal structure refinement in Topas-Academic V5.0, 
 the least-squares method M 
(Equation 4.1) is also employed to obtain the best fit between a structure and the data. This method 
differs from the powder Rietveld refinement in that there is a greater certainty in the starting 
model, which can be obtained by a single crystal refinement of the same data in SHELX-2013. 
The parameter yobs is also different due to the data being a processed hkl reflection file which does 
not contain any peak shape or background information, and also does not suffer from the problems 
of peak overlap in powder data. The powder pattern ycalc is therefore calculated for the trial 
structural model using the information of (1) the lattice parameters (to determine peak positions) 
and (2) atomic positions and thermal parameters. During the least-squares minimisation, selected 
parameters within (2) are optimised, including the atomic positions and thermal parameters, to 
achieve the best fit between the observed and calculated powder patterns. A weighting scheme on 
yobs may also be applied to optimise the best fit. The unit cell parameters are not refined, being 
determined within the single crystal data reduction that produced the hkl reflection file. As in the 
Rietveld refinement, the fit is indicated by Rwp factors and on plotting the observed and calculated 
patterns alongside a difference curve (yobs  ycalc) (Figure 4.5). The refined structure can also be 
viewed within the Topas-Academic V5.0 
Figure 4.5 (a) A plot of yobs, ycalc and the yobs  ycalc difference curve versus 2 for a single crystal hkl reflection file and 
(b) the view structure option in the Topas-Academic V5.0 
The use of Topas-Academic V5.0 
 in this research project enabled single crystal refinement to 
be conducted over a number of variable temperature data sets using a parametric method (2.4.4). 
This allowed the behaviour of certain parameters to be followed or driven over the temperature 
range whilst having advantages of an increased accuracy of parameters and a reduction in 
processing time.  
4.2.4 Variable temperature measurements 
The study of the proton transfer processes in the molecular complexes during the work in this 
research project required crystal structure determination at multiple temperatures, where proton 
migration and proton disorder are temperature dependent effects. This allowed the evolution of the 
hydrogen bond to be followed, including shifts in the refined hydrogen atom positions or changes 
in the occupancy of the proton sites in the hydrogen bond, as a function of temperature.  
For the molecular complexes in which proton migration was studied, full data collections were 
first carried out in-house using laboratory X-ray diffraction at low (100 or 150 K) and high (300 or 
350 K) temperature. This allowed potential proton migration materials to be identified. Multi-
temperature measurements were also carried out at synchrotron X-ray diffraction facilities. These 
multiple temperature measurements were carried out in a range of temperature step sizes, from 10 
to 100 K, and in a stepwise or continuous temperature ramping method, depending on the 
experimental requirements. In these variable temperature experiments, a different crystal mounting 
was required to that used in the low temperature crystal structure determinations; single crystal 
mounts with copper bases were used, to enhance the conduction of heat, and the crystal was glued 
to the loop attached to the mount using araldite to prevent it moving at the higher temperatures. 
The sample position was also re-centred approximately every 40 K during the variable temperature 
measurement to account for expansion or shrinking in the mount on temperature variation.  
Using a synchrotron source in the variable temperature measurements was advantageous allowing 
a more rapid data collection. The more rapid data collection introduced the possibility to probe the 
proton transfer behaviour at a greater number of points over the temperature profile; this could be 
done in a significantly shorter time than would be possible on an in-house source.  
4.2.5 Laboratory single crystal X-ray diffraction 
Four in-house laboratory X-ray diffractometers were used in the single crystal X-ray diffraction 
studies of the molecular complexes during the work in this research project. These include (1) a 
Rigaku 
 R-Axis/RAPID diffractometer which has a four-circle goniometer and is equipped with 
a Rigaku 
 image plate detector. The diffractometer has a standard sealed tube source (Mo-K 
radiation) and uses a graphite monochromator. (2) a Rigaku Oxford Diffraction 
 (formerly 
Agilent Technologies) Gemini A Ultra diffractometer which has a four-circle  geometry 
goniometer and is equipped with an Agilent 
 Atlas CCD detector. The diffractometer has a dual 
source (Cu-K and Mo-K radiation) sealed tube with a graphite monochromator. (3) a Rigaku 
Oxford Diffraction 
 (formerly Agilent Technologies) Xcalibur diffractometer which has a four-
circle  geometry goniometer and is equipped with an Agilent 
 EoS2 CCD detector. The 
diffractometer has a standard sealed tube source (Mo-K radiation) and uses a graphite 
monochromator. (4) a Rigaku Oxford Diffraction 
 (formerly Agilent Technologies) SuperNova 
diffractometer which has a four-circle  geometry goniometer and is equipped with an Agilent 
EoS2 or Atlas CCD detector. The diffractometer has a dual source (Cu-K and Mo-K radiation) 
sealed tube with a graphite monochromator. Diffractometers 1 to 3 were used in-house at the 
University of Bath whilst diffractometer 4 was used both in-house at the University of Bath and at 
the Research Complex at Harwell (RCaH).  
Despite the variations in the specific components across the diffractometers, their general set-up is 
the same (Figure 4.6). The four-circle goniometer can achieve rotation of the crystal through the 
three diffractometer axes ,  and  (the fourth is 2 of the detector) to access all the positions 
required to collect a complete set of diffraction data. Movement of the detector is also possible to 
vary the sample-to-detector distance; this may be required for a crystal with long unit cell axes to 
spread out reflections. A liquid nitrogen flow device (Oxford Cryosystems 
 Cryostream 700 or 
Oxford Instruments 
 CryojetXL) is additionally employed in the setup; this is aligned to point at 
the mounted crystal and allows the sample temperature to be controlled or manipulated during a 
diffraction experiment, such as in the variable temperature measurements. Single crystal 
diffraction data collections are commonly carried out at low temperature (100 or 150 K) or room 
temperature (298 to 300 K). The experimental set-up is encased within an interlocked safety 
cabinet. Different detectors (4.2.7) are employed between the Rigaku 
 R-Axis/RAPID (imaging 
plate) and Rigaku Oxford Diffraction 
 (previously Agilent Technologies) Xcalibur and 
SuperNova diffractometers (CCD). Each diffractometer is connected to a control computer.

Oxford Diffraction 
 (previously Agilent Technologies) SuperNova.  
Data collection and processing are carried out by software on the control computer and are specific 
to each type of machine. For the data collection and processing, the Rigaku 
 R-AXIS/RAPID 
diffractometer uses the Rigaku 
 CrystalClearTM  
 software package and the Rigaku Oxford 
Diffraction 
 Gemini, Xcalibur and SuperNova diffractometers use the Rigaku Oxford 
Diffraction 
 CrysAlisPro 
 software package.  
4.2.6 Single crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction  
Single crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies of the molecular complexes in this research 
project were carried out at two synchrotron facilities: Diamond Light Source, U.K 
 on Beamline 
I19, Harwell and the Advanced Light Source, U.S.A. 
 on Beamline 11.3.1, Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory. The theory of synchrotron crystallography is described in 2.5. The high 
intensity of synchrotron X-rays gave two advantages in these studies; (1) the potential to collect 
good quality data for a more reliable determination of hydrogen atom behaviour and (2) a more 
rapid data collection for a high throughput of samples increasing the number of examples and 
number of temperatures across which possible proton transfer behaviour can be studied.  
I19, the small-molecule single crystal diffraction beamline at the Diamond Light Source 
I19 is a high flux, tuneable wavelength chemical crystallography beamline dedicated to single 
crystal structure determination including under a variety of conditions and sample 
environments. 
The I19 beamline is on a five metre straight section of the Diamond Light Source, U.K. 
 storage 
ring. It is supplied by synchrotron radiation being downstream of an in-vacuum undulator insertion 
device. The beamline schematic is shown in Figure 4.7. 
Figure 4.7 A schematic of the beamline I19, 
 Diamond Light Source, U.K. 
In the first section of the beamline, in the optics hutch, the wavelength of synchrotron radiation is 
selected in the 5 to 28 keV range by a cryo-cooled double crystal monochromator (DCM), 
equipped with Si-111 crystals; the double crystals of the DCM maintains the fixed-exit beam 
geometry. A pair of bimorph mirrors down-stream of the DCM focus the X-ray beam in the 
vertical and horizontal axes onto the sample position in the experimental hutches downstream of 
the optics hutch; the dimensions of the mirrors are matched to the divergence of the beam, and its 
3 mrad incidence angle, allowing a maximised beam foot print over the mirrors. The focused beam 
has a Gaussian profile with a FWHM (full width half maximum) of 90 mm horizontally and  
60 mm vertically at the first sample position in experimental hutch 1 (EH1) and 185 mm 
horizontally and 130 mm vertically at the second sample position in experimental hutch 2 (EH2). 
The beam size can be varied by defocusing the bimorph mirrors; this allows flexibility on sample 
size. A number of cameras are located along the beam path to monitor beam position whilst a 
number of attenuators along the beam path allow flux on the sample to be controlled. 
The two experimental hutches downstream of the optics hutch take beam controlled by an X-ray 
shutter. They house different experimental setups designed to support complementary areas of 
structural science . Single crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies of the molecular complexes 
in this research project have been carried out in both experimental hutches. EH1 is designed for 
high-throughput chemical crystallography whilst EH2 can house significant sample environment 
apparatus such as those using a laser and its position downstream of EH1 allows experiment 
preparation without disrupting the operation of EH1.  
During this research project, EH1 (Figure 4.8) has been used in two different modes of operation, 
pre and post-upgrade. Pre-upgrade, data were collected using Si (111) monochromated radiation at

 four-circle  geometry diffractometer equipped with a  
Rigaku 
 Saturn 724+ CCD area detector. The sample temperature was controlled using an 
Oxford Cryosystems 
 Cryostream Plus. Data collection was performed using the Rigaku 
CrystalClearTM  
 software package whilst data processing was performed using the Rigaku Oxford 
Diffraction

4.2.7 Single crystal X-ray detectors 
A critical stage in an X-ray diffraction experiment is the detection of photons from the scattered  
X-ray. Where the photons are scattered from atomic electrons, they reveal information about 
molecular composition; the ability of an X-ray detector to count the number of photons with 
precision will affect the success of the crystal structure determination. 
 In this research project, a 
number of single crystal X-ray detectors were used in the data collection process. The X-ray 
detectors vary in the area and the mode of measurement of the diffracted intensities.  
Image-plate detectors have a detection surface that, in the case of the instrument used in this 
project, is curved and made out of a photosensitive plastic sheet. On exposure to X-rays, a colour 
centre is created which is then read out, as a digital image, by a laser which scans across the 
photosensitive sheet. Image plates have high efficiency and high dynamic range and sample a large 
diffraction area. These detectors require long exposure and read out times (minutes) and so are less 
suited to synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies where, with the possible short exposures, the long 
read out time would slow an experiment down. 
 Image plate detectors are therefore also less 
suited to variable temperature measurements; to collect at a number of temperatures would require 
a large amount of experimental time. The use of image plates for single crystal structure 
determination is, however, routine, particularly in the area of protein crystallography.   
CCD (charge coupled device) detectors, such as the Agilent 
 CCD EoS2 or Atlas and Bruker 
 APEX2 detector, have a significantly shorter exposure and read out time (seconds) in 
comparison to image plate detectors. 
 A CCD detector has the shape of a truncated cone with a 
phosphor at the wider end which produces visible light in response to X-rays. The pattern on the 
phosphor is then coupled, via fibre optics, to the CCD chip at the tapered end which encodes the 
resulting signal; 
 the read-out from the CCD chip occurs in a pixel-to-pixel manner via charge 
transfer. 
 The coupling and pixel-to-pixel charge transfer processes for CCD detectors can result 
in noise issues whilst blooming is also a problem; involving the overflow of potential wells into 
neighbours which results in a wrong intensity measurement. 
 These detectors are, however, 
widely used in diffraction studies and have been optimised to account for these problems. The 
faster read-out than image plate detectors makes these detectors well suited to use in synchrotron 
X-ray diffraction studies being able to cope with the shorter exposure times allowing complete 
data sets to be collected in a short amount of time. 
Active pixel (AP) complementary metal oxide (CMOS) detectors such as the Bruker AXS 
PHOTON 100 CMOS detector also use a phosphor layer to detect the X-rays, via the photoelectric 
effect, as AP CMOS chips cannot directly read X-rays. Optical coupling then transfers the 
resulting electronic signal to the CMOS chip occurring, in contrast to CCDs, per pixel in an 
independent manner via the AP sensor. 
 Due to the independent pixel read-out, image 
processing is more complicated to address the pixel to pixel non uniformities whilst the optical 
coupling means noise can also be an issue with these detectors. 
 CMOS detectors can, however, 
operate without the need for a mechanical shutter. This means faster image read outs are possible; 
this is advantageous in both synchrotron and variable temperature studies. 
Pilatus hybrid pixel detectors such as the DECTRIS 
 Pilatus 300K and 2M are photon counting 
devices which perform direct detection of X-rays. They consist of a sensor layer (silicon pixels) 
which converts X-rays directly into electrical signal counted by a detector. 
 Features of these 
detectors include wide dynamic range, very short read out time (3 s), shutterless operation, no 
read-out noise and a very high count rate leading to a good signal to noise ratio. The sensitivity 
and dynamic range of hybrid pixel detectors addresses the need to collect weak scattering 
alongside stronger signals, important in diffuse scattering studies. 
 Due to the very short read out 
times Pilatus detectors are well suited to both synchrotron and variable temperature measurements 
allowing complete data sets to be collected in a short amount of time. The good signal to noise 
ratio offered by these detectors may also improve observation of the weakly scattering hydrogen 
atom in the proton transfer studies undertaken here.

4.3 Powder X-ray diffraction 
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is an additional diffraction method used in the evaluation of the 
crystallisation products formed by slow evaporation of solvent; polycrystalline samples are those 
where crystallites are too small for single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. PXRD is a non-
destructive method that requires little sample preparation and has a number of applications 
allowing both structural and phase information to be obtained. It is most widely used in phase 
identification (finger printing). A powder diffraction pattern is characteristic of a crystalline 
material and so, by comparing the powder diffraction pattern of a sample to simulated powder 
diffraction patterns of existing molecular complexes or starting materials, crystalline phases may 
be identified including new materials or different polymorphic forms and whether a mixed phase is 
present or if phase pure; in single crystal analysis it may also be of interest to determine whether a 
single crystal represents the bulk from which it was taken. Rietveld analysis can be carried out on 
mixtures of known components to determine their phase composition (quantitative phase analysis). 
Information about the microstructure of crystallites including morphology can also be obtained 
from a powder diffraction pattern.  
Phase transitions, as a result of molecular rearrangements and caused by external variables such as 
temperature, pressure or time, may also be followed in crystalline materials using powder 
diffraction. This is of importance as the majority of molecular rearrangements occur via a single 
crystal to powder phase transition. In these cases, powder X-ray diffraction data are collected as an 
external variable is applied to the sample in-situ. Phase transitions are then indicated by shifts in 
the diffraction peaks of the powder patterns as a function of the external variable.  
In favourable circumstances, it is possible to carry out indexing of a powder pattern to obtain unit 
cell parameters and space group information; the diffraction pattern should be of good quality with 
a good resolution of diffraction peaks. This is done using indexing programmes such as 
DICVOL 
 or Topas-Academic V5.0 
 and can be performed for a pure or mixed powder phase 
where multiple phases may be indexed individually. Crystal structure determination using powder 
diffraction is also possible; the level of success is usually dependent on the quality of the data. It is 
an involved process which requires a start model and direct space global optimisation 
approaches 
 but offers a realistic alternative when single crystals of a material remain elusive; the 
number of structures solved and refined successfully by this method has been rising in recent 
years.  
In this research project, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was performed for a number of 
purposes. Firstly, powder X-ray diffraction was carried out as an additional method to evaluate the 
precipitates from the crystallisation trials. The purpose was either to identity whether a single 
crystal sample represented the bulk crystallisation product or, where a powder precipitate only was 
formed, used as a fingerprinting tool to identify the solid phases present. Powder X-ray diffraction 
was also employed to follow thermal phase transitions of solvated materials. The heating of 
samples was not carried out in-situ due to the limitations of the in-house diffractometer setup; 
samples were instead preheated to a desired temperature on the hot stage and powder X-ray 
diffraction data measured on samples recovered to room temperature. In the solvent vapour 
diffusion trials, powder X-ray diffraction was carried out on a sample pre and post-vapour 
diffusion to identify phase transitions.  
All powder diffraction experiments in this research project were carried out on a laboratory source. 
Powder samples were prepared for measurement by grinding 10 to 20 mg of single crystal or 
powder precipitates from the crystallisation vial using a pestle and mortar. Grinding was 
performed to achieve a homogenous microcrystalline powder mixture in order to prevent the 
preferred orientation of crystallites known to distort diffraction peak intensities. The ground 
samples were packed onto glass slides covering an area of approximately 10 mm
; the samples 
were kept in place by a thin layer of fomblin oil on the glass slide. Once prepared, samples were 
mounted on the diffractometer in a centred positioned in the path of the direct X-ray beam. During 
data collection, the sample remained centred in the incident X-ray beam but was continuously 
rotated in the horizontal plane; this allowed the effects of preferred orientation to be minimised.  
Samples were analysed at room temperature with a Bruker AXS 
 D8 Advance powder 
diffractometer equipped with a Bruker AXS 
 Vantec-1 detector, using graphite-monochromated 
copper radiation (Cu-K  = 1.54184 ) (Figure 4.12). The X-ray detector was scanned vertically, 
through a 5 to 50  2 range and data collection times were approximately 30 minutes long (scan 
rate of ~2 /minute). Qualitative analysis was carried out on the collected powder patterns by 
comparison to the simulated powder patterns of the molecular complexes characterised in this 
work or to existing molecular complexes and starting materials. The comparison was done visually 
by stacking the powder patterns in the plotting programme WGnuplot 
 and comparing peak 
positions and heights.

D8 Advance powder diffractometer. 
4.4 Thermal analysis 
Thermal analysis was conducted for the identification of new materials based on sample melting 
points and to determine the thermal behaviour of the molecular complexes. The qualitative 
approach of hot-stage microscopy (HSM) and quantitative approaches of differential scanning 
calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) 
were employed. The three techniques were complementary; for example HS and TGA-MS 
revealed the nature of the endotherms in the DSC traces, whether attributable to melting or a phase 
transition as a result of desolvation. 
4.4.1 HSM 
Hot stage microscopy (HSM) combines microscopy and thermal analysis to allow the visual study 
of crystalline materials as a function of temperature and time. 
 The basic hot-stage configuration 
(Figure 4.13) includes an optical microscope equipped with a digital camera, a heating stage 
sample chamber coupled to a digital programmable temperature controller and a computer with 
software to record HSM images from the digital camera. HSM has a number of applications 
including assessing purity via observation of compound melt range, crystal nucleation and growth, 
inducing solid to solid transformations and also for co-crystal screening. HSM studies were 
particularly important in this research project in studying the thermal properties of solvent 
inclusion materials reported in Chapter 9. 
Figure 4.13 The experimental set-up for conducting hot stage microscopy.  
HSM analysis was conducted using a Mettler Toledo 
 FP82 hot stage equipped with a Leica 
Microsystems 
 DM1000 microscope. Single crystal and powder samples were placed on glass 
slides fixed in position in the heating-stage sample chamber. The powder samples were prepared 
by gently grinding single crystal or powder precipitates from the crystallisation vial using a pestle 
and mortar. Each sample was subjected to a programmed temperature regime using a Mettler 
Toledo 
 FP90 Central Processor. The single crystal samples were filmed using a Lumenera 
Infinity 2 microscopy camera mounted on the microscope. A software package by 
Studio86Designs 
 was used for video capture (Studio Capture) and playback (Studio Player). 
Samples were typically heated using a ramp rate of 5 C min
from a start temperature of 30 C up 
to a desired temperature; either until the sample had melted, in the initial screen measurements, or 
to a specific temperature to investigate certain DSC transitions.  
4.4.2 DSC 
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) allows the thermal properties of a material to be studied 
on measuring the heat flow to a sample against that of a reference; differences between the two 
indicate thermal transitions in the sample. DSC was carried out in the work in this research project 
to probe the thermal stability of inclusion materials including desolvation properties, phase 
transitions and melt properties.  
DSC studies were carried out using a TA Instruments 
 Thermal Advantage Q20 DSC equipped 
with TA Instruments 
 Thermal Advantage Cooling System 90 and operated with a dry nitrogen 
purge gas at a flow rate of 18 cm
. Samples of 3 to 6 mg, prepared by gently grinding single 
crystal or powder precipitates from the crystallisation vial using a pestle and mortar, were loaded 
into Tzero
 aluminium pans and sealed with a Tzero
 aluminium lid using a press. An empty 
sealed Tzero
 aluminium pan was used as the reference. HSM measurements of a sample from 
the same crystallisation vial were used as guide for the recommended heating regime; the target 
temperature was set to approximately 10 C higher than the indicated melt point from HSM. A 
heating regime of 5 C min
, typically from 20 C to 300 C, was carried out on each sample, 
programmed using the TA Instruments 
 TA Advantage for Qseries
 software. The temperature 
was allowed to equilibrate at the starting temperature (typically between 20 - 40 C) and held 
isothermal for two minutes at the end temperature. In the DSC traces, the onset temperatures of 
endo and exotherms and the transition energies were determined using the TA Instruments 
Universal Analysis software; 
 the onset temperature is the temperature at which a change in the 
DSC thermogram occurs and is defined as the intersection of the tangents of the peak with the 
extrapolated baseline.  
4.4.3  TGA-MS 
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) allows the thermal 
decomposition pathway of a material to be followed by measuring sample weight loss as a 
function of temperature; when coupled with MS the identity of the lost components can be 
confirmed. TGA-MS was carried out to probe thermal stability of solvent inclusion materials 
including desolvation properties and decomposition pathway.  
TGA was performed using a SETSYS Evolution TGA from Setaram Instrumentation, KEP 
Technologies. 
 Samples of 5 to 10 mg, prepared by gently grinding single crystal or powder 
precipitates from the crystallisation vial, using a pestle and mortar, were measured in a tared 
alumina crucible, 170 l, under an argon gas purge, flow rate 20 ml min
. The weight of the 
sample was measured using a balance with 0.002 mg sensitivity. HSM and DSC measurements of 
a sample from the same crystallisation vial were used as a guide for the recommended heating 
regime; the target temperature was set to approximately 100 C higher than the indicated melt 
point from HSM and DSC to ensure reaching the decomposition temperature. A heating regime of 
5 C min
, between 20 and 400 C, was carried out on each sample, programmed using AKTS 
Calisto 
 Thermal Analysis Software. The weight of the sample was measured over the regime by 
the AKTS 
 Calisto 
 Thermal Analysis Software. In the heating regime, the temperature was 
allowed to equilibrate at the start temperature (typically between 20 and 40 C) for forty minutes 
and kept isothermal for two minutes at the end temperature.  
For each batch of TGA-MS experiments, a blank measurement carrying out the same heating 
regime, 5 C min
 between 20 and 400 C, was conducted on an empty crucible; this allowed the 
crucible contribution to each sample measurement to be removed. The crucible contribution 
includes buoyancy and gas convection effects, related to the argon gas temperature in the TGA 
furnace, which leads to an initial increase in weight at the start of the experiment. After blank 
subtraction, a mass loss profile (weight%) as a function of temperature was produced; the mass 
loss in weight% was calculated by the Calisto Thermal Analysis Software. 
 The size of each 
mass loss step in the profile was then determined using the Calisto Thermal Analysis Software; 
the mass difference (m) was calculated between selected points on the TGA curve, at the start 
and end of each mass loss step. 
MS was coupled with the TGA using an OmniStar GSC 320 from Pfeiffer Vacuum, 
 under an 
argon atmosphere (2.3 bar outlet pressure) controlled using Pfeiffer Vacuum 
 Quadera 
software. In the experimental set up, the MS was programmed to detect the first three to four 
significant MS peaks of each solvent. The signals of these peaks were recorded throughout the 
temperature regime and plotted alongside the TGA curve, as a function of temperature; this 
allowed the solvent mass loss step to be identified.

Synchrotron studies of proton disorder in  
3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid dimers 
Chapter 5 investigates the proton transfer process of proton disorder (1.3.1) and its dependence 
on crystal packing environment using variable temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies 
of a related series of molecular complexes.   
5.1 Introduction and aims 
Proton disorder is an effect which has been observed in a number of substituted benzoic acids 
containing centrosymmetric cyclic 2
2(8) hydrogen bonded carboxylic acid dimers. 
89, 92, 95, 97, 98
particular, crystal packing effects have been suggested to tune the proton disorder in these 
systems. 
 In order to understand further the role of weak interactions in the crystal packing on 
tuning the proton disorder, it is beneficial to identify and study further systems in which the effect 
is observed; variable temperature measurements will also reveal the temperature dependence of the 
proton disorder.   
Molecular complexes of 3,5-dintrobenzoic acid (3,5-DNBA) containing the centrosymmetric 
2(8) hydrogen bonded carboxylic acid dimers (Figure 5.1) are of interest in this study and are 
known to exhibit proton disorder with temperature including in the native forms of polymorphs I 
and II of 3,5-DNBA 
 and in the binary complex of 4-DABA (4-dimethylaminobenzoic acid)  and 
3,5-DNBA. 
Figure 5.1 Centrosymmetric 
() hydrogen bonded carboxylic acid dimers of 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (3,5-DNBA). 
A search of the CSD was conducted to identify additional systems containing the centrosymmetric 
3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded dimer in which the proton disorder could be studied. The structures 
of KIZQIT, 
 VOCHOK, 
 YAFVOS 
 and PUQQIB 
 were revealed as potential candidates 
as these had not previously been studied by variable temperature methods and have carboxylic 
acid CO and C=O bond lengths suggestive of proton disorder (Table 5.1), deviating in length at 
room temperature from those of an ordered aromatic carboxylic acid. 
 The co-molecules were 
also readily available commercially, from Sigma-Aldrich (Figure 5.2).  
Table 5.1 Candidates for variable temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies. The average CO and C=O 
carboxylic acid bond lengths for an ordered aromatic carboxylic acid group are 1.305  and 1.226 , respectively.

Previously, studies of proton disorder in 2
2(8) hydrogen bonded benzoic acid dimers have been 
carried out using the single crystal diffraction techniques of laboratory X-ray and neutron 
diffraction. Only a small number of systems have been studied to date, 
89, 92, 97, 98
 in the detailed 
way that is the focus of this work, limited by the availability of variable temperature and/or 
neutron diffraction measurements. There has, as yet, been no investigation into using X-rays from 
synchrotron sources to investigate such proton disorder effects, despite the high intensity and rapid 
throughput offered by this technique, both of which are potentially beneficial to multi-temperature 
studies of hydrogen transfer processes.  
In the work presented in this chapter, variable temperature single crystal synchrotron X-ray 
diffraction is applied in the study of proton disorder in centrosymmetric 3,5-DNBA hydrogen 
bonded dimers using data collected on beamline I19, at the Diamond Light Source, U.K. (DLS), 
and on beamline 11.3.1, at the Advanced Light Source, A.L.S. (ALS). 
 The study of these systems 
at multiple sources enables a greater reliability in the observations made about the proton disorder 
behaviour, where in agreement, by the synchrotron X-ray technique. 
The synchrotron technique was investigated initially for 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded homo 
dimers in the C2/c polymorph (3,5-DNBA II) (5.3), a system known to exhibit proton disorder at 
300 K and which has been extensively studied previously by variable temperature laboratory X-ray 
and neutron diffraction. 
 The four additional systems of YAFVOS, KIZQIT, VOCHOK and 
PUQQIB were also studied using variable temperature single crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction 
with the aim of assessing further the potential of the synchrotron technique in following proton 
disorder (5.4) and in determining the effect of weaker interactions in the local environment of the 
centrosymmetric 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded dimer, particularly around the acid groups, on the 
presence and onset temperature of proton disorder (5.5).

 Saturn 724+ CCD detector. The 
sample temperature was controlled using an Oxford Cryosystems 
 Cryostream Plus. Data were 
collected using the Rigaku 
 CrystalClearTM 
 software whilst data processing was performed 
using Rigaku Oxford Diffraction 
 CrysAlisPro 
 version 1.171.36.28. 
Single crystal diffraction data were collected for molecular complexes 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN and 
3,5-DNBA MCZ at 100, 200 and 300 K at the Advanced Light Source, U.S.A. 
 using a Bruker 
 D8 Diffractometer equipped with a Bruker AXS 
 Apex2 CCD detector at 100, 200 and 
300 K. The sample temperature was controlled using an Oxford Cryosystems 
 Cryostream Plus. 
Data were collected using Bruker AXS 
 Apex2 
 and processed using Bruker AXS 
Apex2 
 with SADABS-2012. 
For all 3,5-DNBA molecular complexes, the structures were solved using SHELXS-2013 
refined using SHELXL-2013 
 within the WinGX package. 
 A summary of the 
crystallographic data are given in Table 5.4 to Table 5.6. 
Refinement details 
The refinement details include the treatment of the 3,5-DNBA carboxylic acid group hydrogen 
atom in each structure, during structure solution and refinement. Two refinement models were 
employed for the hydrogen atom in the 3,5-DNBA dimer hydrogen bonds. In both models, the 
hydrogen atoms were located based on Fourier difference maps. Model 1 involved the hydrogen 
atom position being restricted to one site but the isotropic thermal parameter and position being 
refined freely. In the sample 3,5-DNBA MCZ, for a stable refinement of the 3,5-DNBA hydroxyl 
hydrogen atom, a DFIX of 0.82  was applied to the OH distance, a standard X-ray OH bond 
length, and the hydrogen atom isotropic atomic displacement parameters was fixed at 1.5 times 
that of an equivalent hydrogen atom. In the sample 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB, for a stable refinement of 
the 3,5-DNBA hydroxyl hydrogen atom, a DFIX of 0.82  was applied to the OH distance. 
Model 2 split the dimer hydrogen bond hydrogen atom over two positions, whose combined 
occupancy was constrained to unity and isotropic thermal parameters at each position constrained 
to be equal. The hydrogen atom positions were also fixed at 0.82  from the relevant donor 
oxygen.

5.3 A comparative diffraction study of proton disorder in 3,5-DNBA II 
In order to benchmark the technique of variable temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction in the 
study of proton disorder processes, it was first applied to the sample of 3,5-DNBA II in which the 
proton disorder had previously been studied extensively by Jones et al. (2013) by both variable 
temperature laboratory (Lab) X-ray and neutron diffraction. 
 A number of strategies were trialled 
in this work on 3,5-DNBA II initially to maximise data quality (5.3.1). The best strategy was then 
applied in a variable temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction study on 3,5-DNBA II and the 
results compared (5.3.2) to those obtained by Jones et al. (2013) from Lab X-ray and neutron 
diffraction studies. 
5.3.1 Optimisation of synchrotron X-ray diffraction data for studying proton disorder 
Fourier difference maps are one of the more reliable methods used to extract information about 
proton disorder behaviour in X-ray diffraction studies of substituted benzoic acids. 
 However, 
the reliability of this method is greatly affected by data quality; poor data quality leads to 
significant amounts of noise in the X-ray Fourier difference maps such that the signal from the 
hydrogen atom is obscured and therefore behaviour indeterminable. 
In order to optimise the use of synchrotron X-ray diffraction in the study of proton disorder via 
Fourier difference maps, a number of data collection strategies were trialled on the sample of  
3,5-DNBA II, on I19, at the Diamond Light Source, U.K. 
 (DLS), in EH1 and EH2.  
Strategy effects 
The effects of changing certain data collection parameters, such as redundancy and resolution, on 
the quality of the Fourier difference maps by changing the data collection strategy such as the 
amount and/or type of diffraction data that was collected were investigated. Different image 
widths and exposure times were also trialled in initial screens before deciding on a 1.0  image 
with a 1 second exposure time. For each collection strategy trialled, a hemisphere of data was 
collected. For strategy 1, no further data was collected, for strategy 2, an additional hemisphere of 
data was collected (giving a sphere in total), for strategy 3, additional low angle data were 
collected and for strategy 4, additional high angle data were collected. These four strategies were 
implemented on four different single crystals of 3,5-DNBA II at 100 K using a Rigaku 
 Saturn 
724+ CCD on I19, at the DLS, in EH1. For each strategy, the data collection parameters are in 
Table 5.7 whilst the generated Fourier difference maps are in Figure 5.3.

Footnote 1 Data collection for each strategy was performed on a different crystal, where each crystal was of a similar size.  
Figure 5.3 Fourier difference maps showing the electron density associated with the H-atom in the 3,5-DNBA dimer

Source, U.K. 
 at 100 K with (a) strategy 1 of a hemisphere, (b) strategy 2 of (i) a hemisphere sphere (ii) plus an 
additional hemisphere, (c) strategy 3 of (i) a hemisphere sphere (ii) plus additional low angle data and (d) strategy 4 of 
(i) a hemisphere (ii) plus additional high angle data.  
Good quality clean Fourier difference maps, where the behaviour of the hydrogen atom density 
can clearly be seen, are generated from the hemisphere of data collected for each strategy; noise in 
the Fourier difference maps as a result of changes in crystal quality between strategies can 
therefore be ruled out and be attributed solely to the effects of the additional data. The good 
quality Fourier difference maps result in all cases where the completeness and redundancies are 
high and the values of Rint, the merging value of the data, are low.  
The inclusion of the additional data, on top of a hemisphere, leads to varying changes in the 
Fourier difference maps and data collection parameters. The inclusion of the additional data for 
strategies 2 and 3 leads to the Fourier difference maps remaining of good quality with low levels 
of noise. The values of completeness and redundancy are also improved whilst a slight increase in 
the value of Rint occurred; a higher multiplicity of data usually increases Rint. 
 The collection of 
the additional hemisphere in strategy 2 results in a slight reduction in the noise in the Fourier 
difference map from that of the initial hemisphere. This reduction in noise indicates improved data 
quality; a result of collecting the unique data multiple times which offers the opportunity during 
the process of merging intensities to reject outliers and reduce the ratio of uncertainty in each 
intensity 
 and where the data to parameter ratio is improved; both factors are important for 
reliable structural solution and refinement. 
 The collection of additional low angle data on top of 
the initial hemisphere, as in strategy 3, may allow additional information about the hydrogen atom 
to be accessed. However, the noise in the Fourier map is actually unchanged. 
The inclusion of the additional high angle data (to 0.56 ) in strategy 4 leads to a significant 
increase in noise in the Fourier difference maps from that of the initial hemisphere. The values of 
completeness and redundancy are lower whilst the value of Rint is higher; indicating a reduction 
overall in the quality of the data. The collection of additional high angle data can improve the 
resolution of the data which is important for unambiguous atom location where high angle 
reflections are primarily due to scattering by atomic cores; the accurate location of atoms in turn 
reduces noise in Fourier difference maps. Measuring more of the weaker reflections at the higher 
angle can also increase the data to parameter ratio. However, the weaker reflections have a low 
signal to noise ratio and so their inclusion may reduce the overall quality of the data, as observed 
here by the large amounts of noise in the Fourier difference maps. In addition, the lack of core 
electrons in bonded hydrogen atoms means that additional high angle data is unlikely to have a 
beneficial effect explicitly in their direct determination. 
Detector effects 
It was possible to obtain good quality Fourier difference maps, in which the behaviour of the 
hydrogen atom density was clearly visible, when using a Rigaku 
 Saturn 724+ CCD detector. 
The potential of the DECTRIS 
 Pilatus 300K detector in the study of proton disorder in 3,5-
DNBA II in Fourier difference maps was also investigated. The operation of a Pilatus detector 
differs from that of the CCD detector, operating as a photon counter rather than a photon 
integrator. This means that, in contrast to a CCD detector, the Pilatus detector has a significantly 
higher count rate and dynamic range, faster read out times and almost negligible background noise 
in the diffraction data. 
155, 239, 240
 These characteristics may benefit proton disorder studies by 
reducing noise in the Fourier difference maps, where the quality and resolution of the data may be 
significantly improved, and allowing the variable temperature data to be collected on shorter 
timescales.   
Fourier difference maps were generated for a sphere of data (for 3,5-DNBA II) collected on the 
DECTRIS 
 Pilatus detector, in EH2 on I19 at the Diamond Light Source, U.K., 
 at 120 and  
300 K. For each strategy, the data collection parameters are given in Table 5.7, with the generated 
Fourier difference maps in Figure 5.4. Different image widths and exposure times were also 
trialled for the DECTRIS 
 Pilatus detector in initial screens before deciding on a 0.4  image 
with a 0.4 second exposure time. 
Figure 5.4 Fourier difference maps showing the electron density associated with the H-atom in the 3,5-DNBA dimer 
hydrogen bonds in 3,5-DNBA II from data collection using the DECTRIS 
 Pilatus detector, in EH2 on I19 at the 
Diamond Light Source, U.K. 
 at (a) 120 K and (b) 300 K.  
The completeness and redundancy are high for both the 120 and 300 K data collections with 
values similar to those obtained for the collection of a sphere using the CCD detector. The Fourier 
difference maps are of reasonable quality at 120 K whilst larger amounts of noise are present at 
300 K; likely a result of increased thermal motion or due to a difference in sample quality where 
the measurements were not carried out on the same crystal. The 120 K Fourier difference map has 
an increased amount of noise in comparison to those at 100 K from the CCD detector, for 
strategies 1 to 3, however the hydrogen atom behaviour is still determinable. In the 300 K map 
there is also a suggestion of a second hydrogen atom peak, as observed in the literature laboratory 
X-ray study of this sample. 
 These initial results of using the DECTRIS 
 Pilatus detector in the 
study of proton disorder in Fourier difference maps therefore appear promising with proton 
disorder behaviour suggested at 300 K which agreed with that reported previously in the 
literature. 
 However, before the use of the Pilatus can be employed reliably in future studies 
further investigation into this method is required in order to obtain Fourier difference maps 
equivalent in quality to those obtained using the CCD detector.   
Summary 
For the data collection strategies which involved data collected using the Rigaku 
 Saturn 724+ 
CCD detector, the hemisphere data collection strategy appears to be best suited to the study of 
proton disorder, allowing good quality Fourier difference maps to be generated, comparable to 
those from a sphere of data but with the benefit of being collected in half the time; this is important 
in variable temperature studies that require measurements at multiple temperatures. Overall, the 
trials using the CCD detector gave better results than those using the DECTRIS 
 Pilatus 300K 
detector. However, it is important to note that the use of the DECTRIS 
 Pilatus 300K detector in 
these studies is still in the very early stages and these initial results are promising for its future use.  
5.3.2 Variable temperature X-ray diffraction study of 3,5-DNBA II 
The results from the first variable temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies on 3,5-DNBA 
II at the Diamond Light Source, U.K. 
 (DLS) and the Advanced Light Source, U.S.A. 
 (ALS) are 
presented in this section and compared to those previously obtained by Jones et al. (2013) using 
laboratory (Lab) X-ray and neutron diffraction. 
 The focus is on the hydrogen bond dimer 
structural and atomic displacement parameters, occupancies of disordered sites and Fourier 
difference maps. The study of 3,5-DNBA II is performed at two sources to have greater confidence 
in the observations made about the proton disorder behaviour, where in support of one another, by 
the synchrotron X-ray technique. 
Based on the findings in 5.3.1, a data collection strategy of collecting a hemisphere of data was 
employed at each synchrotron source and data collected using photon integrating CCD detectors of 
a Rigaku 
 Saturn 724+ CCD on I19, at the DLS, in EH1 and a Bruker AXS 
 Apex2 CCD 
detector on 11.3.1 at the ALS.  
Hydrogen bond dimer structural parameters 
A comparison of the 3,5-DNBA II hydrogen bonded dimer structural parameters over the 100 to 
300 K temperature range revealed that the changes in the CO and C=O bond lengths observed 
with temperature in the DLS and ALS synchrotron structures are in agreement and within error of 
those observed in the previously determined Lab X-ray and neutron structures 
 (Table 5.8 and 
Figure 5.5); the same trend of CO decreasing and C=O increasing in length is observed as a 
function of temperature and therefore the same extent of proton disorder is indicated across the 
four structures. This is expected where parameters involving the heavy atoms of oxygen and 
carbon may be accurately refined from both X-ray and neutron data due to their strong scattering 
in both methods.

Figure 5.5 A comparison of the CO and C=O bond lengths of the carboxylic acid groups forming the hydrogen 
bonded dimers as a function of temperature in the DLS, ALS, Lab X-ray and neutron structures. The standard 
uncertainties on the distances are plotted but are smaller than the symbols used to denote each data point. 
The atomic distances in the dimer hydrogen bond were compared across the four structures (Table 
5.9). The OO distances of the dimer hydrogen bonds are similar in length between the DLS and 
ALS structures and to those in the Lab X-ray and neutron structures, at the different temperatures, 
and also invariant over the temperature range. The hydrogen bonded dimer lies along the b-axis 
and variations in the OO hydrogen bond distances across the structures from the different 
sources appear to correspond to differences in the determined b-axis length; the longest OO 
distance at 100 K occurs in the DLS structure which has the longest b-axis length at 8.765(5)  
whilst the shortest OO distance at 100 K occurs in the ALS structure which has the shortest b-
axis length at 8.7446(4) . When a hydrogen atom refinement model (model 1) with a single 
hydrogen atom site in the dimer is employed, with a freely refined position and thermal parameter, 
the refined OH distances are in agreement for the three X-ray structures (DLS, ALS and Lab), 
over the temperature range, and indicate a slight movement of the refined hydrogen atom position 
towards the centre of hydrogen bond with increasing temperature; an indication of the onset of 
proton disorder. The refined OH distances were longer in the neutron structure than all the 
measured X-ray lengths; the difference is as expected for bond lengths involving hydrogen atom 
positions determined by the two different techniques (2.6).

Atomic displacement parameters 
The atomic displacement parameters were compared across the different structures at the higher 
temperature of 300 K where thermal motion is increased (Figure 5.6). The anisotropic 
displacement parameters of the heavy atoms are in good agreement across all four methods, 
indicating similar atomic motion at this temperature. From X-rays, it is only possible to refine 
hydrogen atom displacement parameters isotropically. There is agreement in the size and 
enlargement of the hydrogen atom isotropic displacement parameter, relative to those in the rest of 
the dimer, across the three X-ray structures (Lab, 
 DLS and ALS). In the neutron structure, the 
hydrogen atom displacement parameter is refined anisotropically and found to be larger than the 
displacement parameters of the hydrogen atoms in the rest of the dimer. The enlarged hydrogen 
atomic displacement parameter in all structures relative to the others indicates a similar apparent 
increased motion of the hydrogen atom at this temperature, indicative of proton disorder. 
However, the anisotropic modelling of the hydrogen atom in the neutron structure additionally 
allows the direction of the elongation and hence apparent motion along the dimer hydrogen bond 
to be determined. This is one disadvantage of the X-ray technique in these studies where only 
extent of motion and not direction is indicated by the isotropically refined hydrogen atom thermal 
parameter.

 and (d) neutron structures 
 at 300 K. 
Fourier difference maps 
Fourier difference maps were generated for the dimer hydrogen bonds for the DLS and ALS 
structures (Figure 5.7) to visualise directly the behaviour of the hydrogen atom density relative to 
that seen in the Fourier maps of the Lab X-ray and neutron structures. 
 A single peak is present in 
the Fourier difference maps of the DLS and ALS structures at 100 K, in agreement with those of 
the Lab and neutron structures at the same temperature, and suggesting an ordered proton. The 
DLS and ALS Fourier maps both contain a potential second peak at 200 K, agreeing with that 
observed in the 200 K Fourier difference map of the Lab X-ray structure. The Fourier difference 
maps of the DLS and ALS structures contain two peaks at 300 K with differing intensities, 
indicating proton disorder with unevenly occupied proton sites, which appear to have the same 
behaviour as those in the Fourier difference maps at 300 K of the Lab X-ray and neutron 
structures. There is better agreement in the shape of the hydrogen atom density in the DLS Fourier 
difference map at 300 K with the shape of the density in the Lab and neutron Fourier difference 
maps than in the ALS Fourier difference maps at the same temperature; the second peak is much 
more defined for this structure. The same trend of increasing proton disorder with temperature is 
therefore suggested by all Fourier difference maps.

 and (d) neutron structures. 
Hydrogen atom site occupancies 
A structural model (model 2) where the hydrogen atom is split over two positions in the dimer 
hydrogen bond was refined for both the DLS and ALS data to determine whether similar 
information about the site occupancies, to that available from the Lab X-ray and neutron 
structures, could be obtained (Table 5.10).  
Table 5.10 Refined occupancies of the two proton configurations in the 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded dimer in  
3,5-DNBA II in the DLS, ALS, Lab X-ray 
 and neutron structures. 
 The X-ray refined occupancy values have an 
estimated error of approximately 10 %. 
Method/T(K) 100 200 300 
DLS 87:13 78:22 69:31

 100:0 78:22 72:28 
Neutron 
 100:0 100:0 81(1):19(2) 
At 100 K, a small extent of proton disorder is indicated in the 3,5-DNBA dimer by the refined 
occupancy values of 87:13 for the two proton configurations in both the DLS and ALS structures. 
The occupancies at the same temperature are, in contrast, 100:0 for the Lab X-ray and neutron 
structures. It should be noted, however, that the estimated uncertainty on occupancy values of 
proton sites from X-rays is approximately 10 % 
 and the 13% occupation of the second site, 
suggested for the DLS and ALS structures, is equivalent to just 0.13 of an electron which could be 
equivalent to background noise. It may therefore be more sensible to assess these occupancies 
values alongside the CO and C=O bond lengths and Fourier difference maps. In the DLS and 
ALS structures, at 100 K, the CO and C=O bond lengths are in good agreement with the average 
CO and C=O bond distances for an ordered aromatic carboxylic acid group 
 and the DLS and 
ALS dimer hydrogen bond Fourier difference maps show a lack of a second peak. It is therefore 
likely that the carboxylic acid group is fully ordered, with an occupancy ratio of 100:0, as refined 
in the Lab and neutron structures. Therefore, it appears that for synchrotron structures, when 
discussing site occupancies of the two proton sites, the CO and C=O bond lengths and Fourier 
difference maps should also be considered.  
There is good agreement in the overall trend of the disorder increasing with temperature suggested 
by the refined occupancies from the DLS and ALS structures with the Lab and neutron structures. 
The occupancies of the two sites are also in agreement at 200 and 300 K between the three X-ray 
structures and at 300 K, are close to being consistent with those refined in the neutron structures 
(81(1):19(2)); supported by consistent CO and C=O bond lengths across the DLS, ALS, Lab and 
neutron structures and the presence of the second peak in the 300 K Fourier difference maps.  
Summary 
The DLS and ALS variable temperature synchrotron studies of proton disorder in 3,5-DNBA II 
revealed equivalent information about the proton disorder to that found by the previous Lab X-ray 
and neutron diffraction studies. 
 Synchrotron X-ray diffraction may therefore be suitable for the 
identification and quantification of proton disorder in 3,5-DNBA cyclic hydrogen bonded dimers. 
This is supported where the information revealed about the proton disorder is also in agreement 
between the two synchrotron sources. However, it is apparent that certain parameters should be 
given greater weighting during the analysis including using the CO and C=O bond lengths and 
Fourier difference maps for the primary identification and quantification of the proton disorder 
with hydrogen atom refined parameters including position, displacement parameters and 
occupancies of proton sites only considered alongside this primary information.  
This preliminary study therefore reveals how to optimise the information from the synchrotron  
X-ray technique to allow a more reliable determination of proton disorder behaviour.   
5.4 Synchrotron studies of proton disorder in molecular complexes of 
3,5-DNBA 
In this section, the synchrotron technique is applied to additional molecular complexes containing 
centrosymmetric 2
2(8) hydrogen bonded 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid dimers to assess further the 
potential of this technique in studies of proton disorder and to aid in determining the role of the 
local environment on tuning proton disorder characteristics, including its presence and onset 
temperature.  
The proton disorder is studied in the four molecular complexes of 3,5-DNBA 3-aminobenzonitrile 
(3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN), 3,5-DNBA N-methylcarbazole (3,5-DNBA MCZ), 3,5-DNBA indole-3-
acetic acid (3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac) and 3,5-DNBA 1,4-diiodobenzene (3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB) so 
selected where, in their crystal structures at room temperature, the centrosymmetric 2
hydrogen bonded homo benzoic acid dimer is formed and proton disorder is suggested in the 
carboxylic acid CO and C=O bond lengths. All samples have been studied in EH1 on I19, at the 
Diamond Light Source, U.K. 
 (DLS); for 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN and 3,5-DNBA MCZ, they have 
also been studied on beamline 11.3.1, at the Advanced Light Source, U.S.A 
 (ALS).  
5.4.1 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN  
In the crystal structure of 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN at 100 K (DLS), the two components crystallise in a 
1:1 ratio, with two formula units in the asymmetric unit, in space group 1. Two symmetry 
independent 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded 2
2(8) dimers (dimer 1 and dimer 2) are present in the 
structure, where the 3,5-DNBA molecules are held together by strong to moderate strength  
OHO hydrogen bonds (dimer 1 dOO 2.588(1)  and dimer 2 dOO 2.618(1)  at 100 K) and 
are related by an inversion centre at the centre of the 2
2(8) hydrogen bonded ring (Figure 5.8(a)i 
and (b)i).  
Figure 5.8 The 3,5-DNBA centrosymmetric hydrogen bonded 
() dimers at 100 K in the molecular complex of  
3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN: (a) dimer 1 and (b) dimer 2, i perpendicular to the dimer plane and ii in plane of the dimer.  
Within the hydrogen bonded dimers, the aromatic rings of the two 3,5-DNBA molecules are in the 
same layer in dimer 1 (0.193  between aromatic ring planes) whilst they are slightly offset in 
dimer 2 (0.533  between aromatic ring planes) (Figure 5.8(a)ii and (b)ii). The hydrogen bonded 
carboxylic acid groups are essentially planar to the aromatic ring in both dimers; a twist of 5.6(2)  
occurs in dimer 1 and a twist of 0.8(2)  occurs in dimer 2. In the 2
2(8) hydrogen bonded ring of 
each dimer, the carboxylic acid groups are tilted relative to one another (COO angle of 
111.30(8)  in dimer 1 and 114.80(8)  in dimer 2 and a C=OO angle of 123.81(9)  in dimer 1 
and 120.25(8)  in dimer 2). One of the nitro groups in dimer 1 lies slightly out of plane of the 
aromatic ring, with torsion angles of  18.5(2) and 3.8(2) , whilst both of the nitro groups lie out 
of plane of the aromatic ring in dimer 2, with torsion angles of 12.0(2) and  9.9(2) . 
Molecular packing 
In the crystal structure of 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN, dimer 1 and dimer 2 are in different crystal 
packing environments. Several short contacts are formed to the hydrogen bonded carboxylic acid 
groups in both dimer 1 and dimer 2 (Figure 5.9). 
Figure 5.9 The local packing environments of the 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded dimer carboxylic acid groups in  
(a) dimer 1 and (b) dimer 2 in the molecular complex of 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN. For clarity, the packing is shown for one 
side of the centrosymmetric dimer only. 
In dimer 1, weak CHO hydrogen bonds form to both carboxylic acid oxygen atoms involving 
CH groups donated from neighbouring 3-ABCN molecules. A shorter interaction forms to the 
carbonyl oxygen atom than the hydroxyl oxygen atom (dCOcarbonyl 3.393(2)  and <CHO 151(1)  
versus dCOhydrozyl 3.546(1)  and <CHO 147(1) ). A nitrile group of a neighbouring 3-ABCN 
molecule also stacks below the carboxylic acid group forming weak contacts to the acid -density 
(d 3.294(2) and 3.378(2) ). In the local environment of dimer 2, a weak CHO hydrogen 
bond forms to the hydroxyl oxygen atom involving a CH group donated by a neighbouring  
3-ABCN molecule (dCO 3.349(2) , <CHO 123(1) ). A 3-ABCN molecule also stacks below the 
carboxylic acid group forming weak contacts to the acid -density (d 3.349(2) ) whilst a weak 
OO contact (dOO 2.948(1) ), less than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the two atoms 
(3.04 ) and therefore significant, forms between the acid carbonyl and a nitro group of a  
3,5-DNBA molecule in a neighbouring dimer 2 unit. 
Intermolecular interactions also occur between the 3,5-DNBA molecule, forming each 
centrosymmetric dimer, and to 3,5-DNBA and 3-ABCN molecules in the local environment 
(Figure 5.10). Interactions formed between 3,5-DNBA molecules are dimer specific such that no 
significant interactions form between dimer 1 and dimer 2.   
Figure 5.10 The local packing environments of each 3,5-DNBA molecule in (a) dimer 1 and (b) dimer 2 in the 
molecular complex of 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN. For clarity, the packing is shown for one side of the centrosymmetric dimer 
only. 
In the local environment of dimer 1, weak interactions form to both nitro groups of the 3,5-DNBA 
molecule forming the centrosymmetric dimer. The nitro group on the protonated side of the  
3,5-DNBA molecule forms weak CHO hydrogen bonds, through both its oxygen atoms, to 
aromatic CH groups from different 3,5-DNBA molecules in neighbouring dimer 1 units (dCO 
3.212(2) and 3.269(2) ). The nitro group on the non-protonated side of the 3,5-DNBA molecule 
interacts with a neighbouring 3-ABCN amino group via an NHO hydrogen bond (dNO 
3.224(1) ) and bifurcated CHO hydrogen bonds (dCO 3.395(2) and 3.606(2) ). A weak 
CHO bond also form on the non-protonated side of the 3,5-DNBA molecule, involving an 
aromatic CH at the 2-position, to a nitro group of a 3,5-DNBA molecule in a neighbouring 
dimer 1 unit (dCO 3.212(2) ). In the middle of the 3,5-DNBA molecule, a ring CH group at 
the 4-position forms a weak hydrogen bond to a nitro group of a 3,5-DNBA molecule in a 
neighbouring dimer 1 unit (dCO 3.269(2) ). The amino end of a 3-ABCN molecule stacks below 
the 3,5-DNBA molecule forming weak -contacts (d 3.332(2) ). 
In the local environment of dimer 2, weak interactions form to both nitro groups of the 3,5-DNBA 
molecule forming the centrosymmetric dimer. The nitro group on the protonated side of the  
3,5-DNBA molecule forms a weak CHO hydrogen bond to aromatic CH groups on a 
neighbouring 3-ABCN molecule (dCO 3.392(2) ) and on a 3,5-DNBA molecule in a 
neighbouring dimer 2 unit (dCO 3.213(2) ). The nitro group on the protonated side also forms a 
weak OO contact to the acid group of a 3,5-DNBA molecule in a neighbouring dimer 2 unit 
(dOO 2.948(1) ); less than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the two atoms (3.04 ) and 
therefore significant. The nitro group on the non-protonated side of the 3,5-DNBA molecule 
interacts with a neighbouring 3-ABCN amino group, via a moderate strength NHO hydrogen 
bond (dNO 2.948(2) ), and with an aromatic CH in a 3,5-DNBA molecule in a neighbouring 
dimer 2 via a weak CHO hydrogen bond (dCO 3.314(2) ). A weak CHO bond also 
forms on the non-protonated side of the 3,5-DNBA molecule, involving an aromatic CH at the  
2-position to a nitro group of a 3,5-DNBA molecule in a neighbouring dimer 2 unit (dCO 3.213(2) 
). In the middle of the 3,5-DNBA molecule, one of the ring CH groups forms a weak  
CHO hydrogen bond to a nitro group of a 3,5-DNBA molecule in a neighbouring dimer 2 
(dCO 3.314(2) ). 3-ABCN molecules also stack above and below the 3,5-DNBA molecule, at the 
benzonitrile (d 3.306(2) and 3.258(2) ) and amino ends (d 3.322(2) ).  
The wider packing of each dimer in 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN occurs in isolated layers of each 
component; the two symmetry independent dimers occupy different layers (Figure 5.11). The 
dimer acid groups are well integrated into the structure.  
Figure 5.11 The wider packing in the molecular complex of 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN. Dimer 1 is in blue and dimer 2 in red.  
Variable temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements on 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN  
Variable temperature measurements were carried out on 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN at the DLS at 100 to 
300 K, in 50 K steps, and at the ALS at 100 to 300 K, in 100 K steps. 
The CO and C=O bond lengths of the carboxylic acid groups forming the hydrogen bonded 
dimers were followed as a function of temperature (Table 5.11 and Figure 5.12). Over the 100 to 
300 K temperature range, a linear trend of the CO bond lengths shortening and the C=O bond 
lengths lengthening with temperature occurs in both dimer 1 and dimer 2. This suggests the 
presence of temperature dependent disorder in this molecular complex. In general, the CO and 
C=O bond lengths are closer in length over the temperature range for dimer 2 than they are for 
dimer 1. At 100 K, the CO and C=O bond lengths in dimer 2 also deviate from the average for 
an aromatic carboxylic acid (approximately 1.29 and 1.25 ) whilst they do not for dimer 1 
(approximately 1.31 and 1.23 ). This suggests that the onset temperature and extent of proton 
disorder occurring is not the same for the two 3,5-DNBA dimers and that the effect is greater in 
dimer 2, though not such that a 50:50 split occupancy is suggested as the CO and C=O bonds 
are not equalised at this temperature.  
The CO and C=O bond lengths from the DLS and ALS structures are consistent over the 
temperature range and indicate similar proton disorder behaviour; the apparent deviation at 300 K 
in the CO and C=O distances in dimer 2 between the DLS and ALS structures is not large 
enough to be considered statistically significant.

Figure 5.12 The CO and C=O bond lengths of the carboxylic acid groups forming the hydrogen bonded dimers as a 
function of temperature in (a) dimer 1 and (b) dimer 2 in the DLS and ALS structures in 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN.  
The OHO hydrogen bond parameters in dimer 1 and 2 were also followed as a function of 
temperature (Table 5.12). The OO hydrogen bond distance remains constant over the 
temperature range and between the DLS and ALS structures. The OH distances lengthen and the 
HO distances shorten linearly with temperature (Table 5.12 and Figure 5.13) as the refined 
hydrogen atom position moves towards the centre of the bond; behaviour that is characteristic of 
temperature dependent disorder and in agreement with the changes in the CO and C=O bond 
lengths. The OH and HO distances suggest that the onset temperature of the proton disorder is 
different between the two dimers, where an elongated OH distances occurs at temperatures as 
low as 100 K to 150 K in dimer 2 whilst in dimer 1 occurs more in the range of 150 to 200 K; this 
is in agreement with the deviations in the CO and C=O bond lengths which are evident at 100 K 
in dimer 2 but are not indicated in dimer 1 until 200 K. The movement of the refined hydrogen 
atom position towards the centre of the bond is greater in dimer 2, coinciding with the CO and 
C=O bond distances being closer in dimer 2 over the temperature range, and suggest a greater 
extent of proton disorder occurring in this dimer. The OH and HO distances are also consistent 
between the DLS and ALS structures for each dimer, over the temperature range studied. The  
OH and HO distances, in conjunction with the CO and C=O bond lengths, are therefore 
informative about the onset and temperature dependence of the proton disorder in this sample and 
the difference in the extents of disorder occurring between the two dimers. 
The size of the thermal parameter (Uiso) of each dimer hydrogen atom increases linearly with 
temperature and can further suggest the presence of temperature dependent proton disorder in  
3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN, in conjunction with the other indicators discussed here. The large value of 
Uiso in dimer 2 of 0.101(9) 
 at 100 K compared to 0.069(6)  
 in dimer 1, also suggests an 
earlier proton disorder onset temperature in dimer 2. The increase in size of the thermal parameters 
with temperature is similar between the two dimers and so indicates less about the extents of 
disorder occurring across the two dimers than is suggested by the CO/C=O and OH/HO 
lengths as a function of temperature. Of course, in the absence of any corroborating information, 
the increase in size of the thermal parameter may also simply be an indicator of increased thermal 
motion at higher temperatures. In this case, the size of Uiso would only be useful for identifying the 
presence of proton disorder at low temperatures in this sample.

Figure 5.13 The OH and HO bond lengths in the OHO dimer hydrogen bonds with temperature in (a) dimer 1 
and (b) dimer 2 in the DLS and ALS structures of 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN. 
Fourier difference maps were generated for the dimer 1 (Figure 5.14) and dimer 2 (Figure 5.15) 
hydrogen bonds over the temperature range. In agreement with the changes observed in the  
CO/C=O and OH/HO bond lengths and hydrogen atom thermal parameters, a change in the 
hydrogen atom density in the Fourier difference maps for each dimer occurs with temperature and 
this change appears to be different between the two dimers. Unlike for the CO/C=O and  
OH/HO bond lengths and hydrogen atom thermal parameters, the Fourier difference maps for 
each dimer are not consistent between the DLS and ALS structures. This lack of consistency may 
be caused by the presence of significant (and different) amounts of noise in the Fourier difference 
maps generated for the DLS and ALS structures and so the information about the behaviour of the 
hydrogen density in the dimer hydrogen bonds is less clear or reliable. There is less noise in 
Fourier difference maps generated for the DLS structures and so these are better used for 
identifying the presence and extent of proton disorder in this sample in conjunction with the other 
structural parameters. 
For dimer 1, a single peak for the hydrogen atom density is present in the Fourier difference maps 
generated for the DLS structure at 100 and 150 K. The single peak suggests an ordered carboxylic 
acid; in agreement with the CO and C=O bond lengths at this temperature (dCO 1.309(1)  and 
dC=O 1.232(2) ). The first change in the shape of the hydrogen atom density occurs at 200 K; at 
this temperature, a second peak appears in the Fourier difference map generated for the DLS 
structure and suggests the onset of proton disorder at this temperature. This apparent change in the 
hydrogen atom density at 200 K coincides with the first significant deviation of the CO and 
C=O bond lengths away from those of an ordered aromatic carboxylic acid; from 1.300(1)  and 
1.234(2) , respectively, at 150 K to 1.290(2)  and 1.242(2) , respectively, at 200 K. The 
intensity of the signal for this peak increases between 200 and 300 K such that the second site is 
more apparent and indicates an increase in the extent of proton disorder between these two 
temperatures. The increase in intensity of the second peak between 200 and 300 K coincides with 
further shortening of the CO and lengthening of the C=O bond distances to 1.277(2) and 
1.243(2) , respectively.  
For dimer 2, a weak signal in the Fourier difference maps of the dimer hydrogen bond at 100 K 
may indicate a second hydrogen atom position and the onset of proton disorder. This is not 
completely unlikely where the CO and C=O bond lengths (dCO 1.295(1)  and dC=O 
1.248(2) ) are slightly shortened and lengthened, respectively, at this temperature for an ordered 
aromatic carboxylic acid group. The intensity of the signal for the second peak appears to increase 
with temperature at 200 K, suggesting an increase in the extent of proton disorder and coinciding 
with an increased shortening and lengthening, respectively, of the CO and C=O bond lengths at 
this temperature (dCO 1.279(2)  and dC=O 1.253(2) ). In the 250 and 300 K Fourier difference 
maps, the hydrogen atom density appears almost equally spit over the two sites, in two separate 
positions at 250 K and elongated over the two sites at 300 K. This could suggest an approaching 
towards a 50:50 disorder of the dimer proton above 250 K coinciding with the equalisation of the 
CO and C=O bond lengths which are close in value to each other at 300 K (dCO 1.269(2)  and 
dC=O 1.254(3) ).  
In agreement with changes to the CO and C=O bond lengths with temperature, the variable 
temperature Fourier difference maps for each dimer are able to identify temperature dependent 
proton disorder in 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN and also reveal information about the extent of proton 
disorder occurring.

The potential to refine accurate occupancies for the proton sites as a function of temperature was 
investigated for 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN. A structural model where the hydrogen atom is disordered 
over two sites in the dimer hydrogen bond was refined for both the DLS and ALS structures (Table 
5.13).  
Table 5.13 Refined occupancies of the two proton configurations in dimer 1 and dimer 2 in the DLS and ALS structures 
of 3.5-DNBA 3-ABCN. The X-ray refined occupancy values have an estimated error of approximately 10 %.

The refined proton site occupancies are consistent, considering the estimated 10% error, for 
dimer 1 and dimer 2 between the DLS and ALS structures. The occupancy values follow the trend 
of increasing disorder with temperature and a greater increase occurs in dimer 2, as suggested by 
both hydrogen bond dimer structural parameters and Fourier difference maps. However, the extent 
of disorder at each temperature does not appear to agree as well with the CO and C=O bond 
lengths at each temperature. For example, a split occupancy of approximately 70:30 is estimated 
for dimer 1 at 100 K suggesting a significant amount of proton disorder to be occurring. This does 
not coincide with the CO and C=O bonds lengths (dCO 1.309(1)  and dC=O 1.232(2) ), which 
have values close to those of an ordered aromatic carboxylic acid, and the Fourier difference maps, 
which contain only one hydrogen atom peak, at this temperature. For dimer 2, at 300 K, an 
approximate 50:50 disorder is suggested by the refined occupancy values however the CO and 
C=O bonds lengths are not equalised at this temperature in either the DLS (dCO 1.269(2)  and 
dC=O 1.254(3) ) or ALS (dCO 1.278(5)  and dC=O 1.240(5) ) structures, respectively. The 
proton site occupancies refined from the synchrotron X-ray data are thus shown here to be less 
reliable for determining the onset and extent of variable temperature disorder in this complex,  
3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN, relative to the other structural parameters and Fourier difference maps.   
5.4.2 3,5-DNBA MCZ 
In the crystal structure of 3,5-DNBA MCZ at 100 K (DLS), the two components crystallise in a 
1:1 ratio, in space group 1. A 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded 2
2(8) dimer is present in the 
structure where the 3,5-DNBA molecules are held together by moderate strength OHO 
hydrogen bonds (dOO  2.626(2)  at 100 K) and are related by an inversion centre at the centre of 
the 2
2(8) hydrogen bonded ring (Figure 5.16).  
Figure 5.16 The 3,5-DNBA centrosymmetric hydrogen bonded 
() dimer in the molecular complex of 3,5-DNBA 
MCZ at 100 K: (a) perpendicular to the dimer plane and (b) in plane of the dimer. 
Within the hydrogen bonded dimer, the aromatic rings of the two 3,5-DNBA molecules are not in 
the same layer (offset by 0.447  between aromatic ring planes) and the hydrogen bonded 
carboxylic acid group is twisted slightly out of co-planarity of the 3,5-DNBA aromatic ring 
(5.9(2) ). On forming the 2
2(8) hydrogen bonded ring, the carboxylic acid groups are tilted 
relative to one another (COO angle of 117.2(1)  and a C=OO angle of 117.6(1) ). One of 
the nitro groups is co-planar with aromatic ring (twisted by  0.6(2) ) whilst the other is twisted 
slightly (7.1(2) ) out of co-planarity of the aromatic ring.  
Molecular packing 
In the crystal structure of 3,5-DNBA MCZ, there are short contacts in the local packing 
environment of the carboxylic acid groups forming the 3,5-DNBA dimer (Figure 5.17). These 
include those to MCZ molecules, in the neighbouring environment, which stack above  
(d 3.273(3) and 3.308(3) ) the carboxylic acid groups. There are no significant interactions to 
the carboxylic acid oxygen atoms.

molecualr complex of 3,5-DNBA MCZ. For clarity, the packing is shown for one side of the centrosymmetric dimer 
only. 
Intermolecular interactions also occur between the 3,5-DNBA molecule, in each dimer, and the 
local environment (Figure 5.18). These interactions involve predominantly MCZ molecules with 
tail to tail interactions formed between 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bond dimers.

in the molecular complex of 3,5-DNBA MCZ. For clarity, the packing is shown for one side of the centrosymmetric 
dimer only. 
Weak interactions form to both 3,5-DNBA nitro groups of the 3,5-DNBA molecule forming the 
centrosymmetric dimer. The nitro group on the protonated side of the 3,5-DNBA molecule forms 
weak CHO hydrogen bonds through interaction of both its nitro oxygen atoms to MCZ 
aromatic CH (dCO 3.475(2) and 3.602(2) ) and methyl CH (3.257(2) ) groups. The nitro 
group on the non-protonated side of the 3,5-DNBA molecule forms weak CHO hydrogen 
bonds through interaction of both the nitro oxygen atoms with CH groups donated by an MCZ 
aromatic ring (dCO 3.454(2) ) and a MCZ methyl group (dCO 3.217(2) ). Both nitro groups 
form weak OO contacts to a neighbouring 3,5-DNBA dimer unit (dOO 3.037(2) ), just less 
than the sum of the van der Waals radii for the two atoms (3.04 ) and therefore significant, 
occurring such that a nitro group on the protonated side on one 3,5-DNBA molecule links to the 
nitro group on the non-protonated side of the next 3,5-DNBA molecule. Equivalently orientated 
MCZ molecules stack above (d 3.340(2), 3.394(2) and 3.360(2) ) and below (3.311(2), 
3.317(2), 3.366(2) and 3.373(2) ) the 3,5-DNBA molecule forming the dimer.  
In the wider crystal structure, molecules of MCZ molecules pack around the 3,5-DNBA hydrogen 
bonded dimers such that the acid groups lie in a pocket, in an isolated environment (Figure 5.19).   
Figure 5.19 The wider packing in the molecular complex of 3,5-DNBA MCZ. The 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded dimer 
is shown in blue.  
Variable temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements on 3,5-DNBA MCZ  
Variable temperature measurements were carried out on 3,5-DNBA MCZ at the DLS at 100 to 
300 K, in 50 K steps, and at the ALS at 100 to 300 K, in 100 K steps.  
The CO and C=O bond lengths of the carboxylic acid groups forming the hydrogen bonded 
dimers were followed as a function of temperature (Table 5.14 and Figure 5.20). Over the 100 to 
300 K temperature range, only very small changes to the CO and C=O bond lengths occur. At 
100 K, the CO and C=O bond lengths (at approximately 1.27 and 1.25 , respectively) deviate 
significantly from the average for an aromatic carboxylic acid in the DLS and ALS structures, 
suggesting a significant amount of proton disorder at this temperature. Between 100 and 200 K, 
the CO and C=O bond lengths follow a linear trend of shortening and lengthening, respectively, 
indicating temperature dependent proton disorder, reaching equalisation at 200 K, in both the DLS 
and ALS structures. This suggests a 50:50 proton disorder at this temperature. Beyond 200 K, the 
CO and C=O bond lengths appear to switch in the ordering; the C=O bond is now longer than 
the CO. However, these values are consistent within error and so no further change to the proton 
disorder is suggested between 200 and 300 K. The CO and C=O bond lengths between the DLS 
and ALS structures are consistent over the temperature range, in support of the same proton 
disorder behaviour; the apparent deviation at 300 K in the CO and C=O distances between the 
DLS and ALS structures is not large enough to be considered significant.

Figure 5.20 The CO and C=O bond lengths of the carboxylic acid groups forming the hydrogen bonded dimers as a 
function of temperature in the DLS and ALS structures of 3,5-DNBA MCZ. 
The OHO hydrogen bond parameters of the 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded dimer were also 
followed as a function of temperature (Table 5.15). A gradual increase in the OO hydrogen bond 
distance occurs between 100 and 300 K for the DLS structures in accordance with thermal 
expansion of the cell. In the ALS structure, a shortening of the OO hydrogen bond distance 
occurs between 200 and 300 K. This may be caused by the 3,5-DNBA dimer lying effectively 
along the b and c-axes which experience decreases in length between 200 K and 300 K; from 
8.4261(6) to 8.395(17)  for the b-axis and from 15.7600(1) to 15.72(3)  for the c-axis. Little 
change is observed in the OH and HO distances as a function of temperature; a result of the 
distance restraint applied to the OH distance in order to achieve a stable refinement of the 
hydrogen atom position. These parameters therefore cannot be used to identify or quantify the 
temperature dependent proton disorder in this sample. The size of the isotropic thermal parameter 
(Uiso) for the dimer proton is large at 100 K, at 0.11 
, and may suggest the presence of proton 
disorder at this temperature in agreement with the deviating (from the ordered carboxylic group 
distances) CO and C=O bond lengths. The increase in the size of the isotropic thermal parameter 
as a function of temperature may also indicate an increase in the extent of proton disorder 
occurring. However, the thermal parameter continues to increase in size beyond 200 K with no 
further change in the proton disorder suggested by the CO and C=O bond lengths, indicating on 
the basis of this corroborating factor that this is likely simply a result of the increase in thermal 
motion of atoms with temperature. In this case, the size of Uiso would therefore only be useful for 
identifying the presence of proton disorder at low temperature but reveals little about the 
temperature dependence or extent occurring. The hydrogen atom thermal parameters do not have 
errors as a result of a restraint being applied to the thermal parameter for a stable refinement. This 
makes this parameter even less reliable in determining proton disorder behaviour.

Variable temperature Fourier difference maps were generated for the 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded 
dimer (Figure 5.21). In agreement with changes being observed in the CO/C=O bond lengths as 
a function of temperature, a change in the hydrogen atom density for the DLS structure also 
occurs. There is less agreement in the proton disorder behaviour indicated in the Fourier difference 
maps between the two sources. The Fourier difference maps of the ALS structures contain large 
amounts of noise and therefore determination of the hydrogen atom behaviour is more difficult.  
At 100 K, a second peak is present in the DLS Fourier difference map suggesting the presence of 
proton disorder at this temperature. The second peak has a strong intensity, indicated by the white 
region at its centre which is just smaller than that of the first peak. The intensity of the second peak 
suggests a significant amount of proton disorder at this temperature and is in agreement with the 
CO and C=O bond lengths at 100 K, which deviate significantly from the values of an ordered 
aromatic carboxylic acid. The intensity of the second hydrogen atom peak is increased at 150 and 
200 K such that its maximum appears greater than that of the first peak. This suggests an increase 
in the extent of the proton disorder occurring between 150 and 200 K and may be an indicator of a 
50:50 split in occupancies at 200 K, as suggested by the equalised CO and C=O bond lengths. A 
similar effect is observed at 250 K, but with the intensity of the first site being slightly stronger, 
whilst at 300 K, the density for the hydrogen atom is significantly smeared such that it becomes 
difficult to resolve the two hydrogen atom positions; there is also additional noise in the Fourier 
difference maps. These fluctuations in the density between 200 and 300 K occur as the CO and 
C=O bond lengths undergo minor fluctuations within error.  
A second peak with strong intensity is also present in the Fourier difference map for the ALS 
structure at 100 K, indicating the presence of proton disorder. The intensity of this second peak 
appears to be greater than that of the peak for the refined hydrogen atom position and suggests 
more disorder to be occurring than indicated by the values of the CO and C=O bond lengths at 
100 K. Significant amounts of noise are present in the Fourier difference maps for the 200 and  
300 K ALS structures such that determination of the hydrogen atom behaviour is unreliable.  
The better quality variable temperature Fourier difference maps for the DLS structure are able to 
identify temperature dependent proton disorder in 3,5-DNBA MCZ and also reveal information 
about the extent of proton disorder occurring that is in reasonable agreement with changes to the 
CO and C=O bond lengths as a function of temperature.  
Figure 5.21 Variable temperature Fourier difference maps showing the electron density associated with the H-atom in 
the 3,5-DNBA dimer hydrogen bonds in 3,5-DNBA MCZ in the (a) DLS and (b) ALS structures.  
The potential to refine accurate occupancies for the proton sites as a function of temperature was 
investigated for 3,5-DNBA MCZ. A structural model where the hydrogen atom is disordered over 
two sites in the dimer hydrogen bond was refined (Table 5.16).  
At 100 K, the occupancies refined for the proton sites in the DLS and ALS structures both indicate 
the presence of proton disorder, in agreement with the deviation of the CO and C=O bond 
lengths away from the values of an ordered aromatic carboxylic acid. However, there is not 
agreement in the extent of disorder suggested. For example, in each structure, at 100 K, the refined 
occupancies suggest a 50:50 disorder (considering the 10 % error on occupancies refined from X-
rays) or a slight bias for the second site and a switch in carboxylic acid configuration; this is not in 
agreement with the disorder behaviour suggested by the CO and C=O bond lengths at 100 K 
(approximately 1.27 and 1.25 , respectively). An increased occupancy of the second site is also 
suggested between 100 and 200 K in the DLS structure, agreeing with the Fourier difference maps 
where the second peak appears slightly more intense but in contrast to the CO and C=O bonds 
which approach equalisation at 200 K, suggesting a 50:50 proton disorder. Occupancy values for 
the two proton sites at 300 K have been refined in the DLS structure, however a significant extent 
of smearing of the proton density is suggested in the Fourier difference maps; it therefore seems 
unlikely that during the refinement it is possible to attribute electron density to two separate 
positions with any confidence. There is also poor agreement in the refined occupancies between 
the DLS and ALS structures. 
It appears that the refined occupancies are particularly unreliable for this molecular complex and 
so should be significantly down weighted when quantifying extents of proton disorder.

5.4.3 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac 
In the crystal structure of 3,5-DNBA and In-3-Ac at 100 K (DLS), the two components crystallise 
in a 1:1 ratio, in space group P21/c. A 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded 2
2(8) dimer is present in the 
structure, where the 3,5-DNBA molecules are held together by strong to moderate strength O
HO hydrogen bonds (dOO 2.633(2)  at 100 K) and are related by an inversion centre at the 
centre of the 2
2(8) hydrogen bonded ring (Figure 5.22).

() dimer in the molecular complex of 3,5-DNBA 
In-3-Ac at 100 K: (a) perpendicular to the dimer plane and (b) in plane of the dimer. 
Within the hydrogen bonded dimer, the aromatic rings of the two 3,5-DNBA molecules are in the 
same layer (0.136  between aromatic ring planes) and the hydrogen bonded carboxylic acid 
groups are essentially planar to the aromatic ring (twisted by  3.9(2) ). In the 2
2(8) hydrogen 
bonded ring, the carboxylic acid groups are tilted relative to one another (COO angle of 
113(2)  and a C=OO angle of 118(1) ). The nitro groups are non co-planar with the aromatic 
ring, twisted by  12.8(2) and 27.5(2)  out of co-planarity.  
Molecular packing 
In the crystal structure of 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac, there are short contacts in the local packing 
environment of the carboxylic acid groups forming the 3,5-DNBA dimer (Figure 5.23). These 
include those to In-3-Ac molecules, in the local environment, which stack above (d 3.393(2) and 
3.338(2) ) and below (d 3.387(2) ) the carboxylic acid groups. There are no significant 
interactions formed to the carboxylic acid oxygen atoms.

molecular complex of 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac. For clarity, the packing is shown for one side of the centrosymmetric dimer 
only and shown from different perspectives (a) and (b). 
Intermolecular interactions also occur between the 3,5-DNBA molecules, in each dimer, and the 
local environment (Figure 5.24). These interactions involve In-3-Ac molecules only; there are no 
direct links between the 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded dimers.

in the molecular complex of 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac. For clarity, the packing is shown for one side of the centrosymmetric 
dimer only. 
Weak interactions form to both 3,5-DNBA nitro groups of the 3,5-DNBA molecule forming the 
centrosymmetric dimer. The nitro group on the protonated side of the 3,5-DNBA molecule forms 
weak CHO hydrogen bonds through both its oxygen atoms to aromatic CH groups from 
different In-3-Ac molecules in the local environment (dCO 3.206(2) and 3.172(3) ). One nitro 
oxygen atom also interacts with an NH group on a neighbouring In-3-Ac forming a moderate 
strength NHO hydrogen bond (dNO 2.991(1) ). The nitro group on the non-protonated side 
of the molecule forms a weak CHO hydrogen bond through one of its oxygen atoms to a  
CH group of a neighbouring In-3-Ac molecule (dCO 3.279(2) ) whilst the other oxygen atom 
interacts with an NH group on a neighbouring In-3-Ac forming a weak NHO hydrogen 
bond (dNO 3.023(2) ). A weak CHO bond also form on the non-protonated side of the  
3,5-DNBA molecule, involving one of its ring CH and an In-3-Ac hydroxyl group (dCO 
3.362(2) ). In-3-Ac molecules in the local environment also stack above (d 3.328(2) and 
3.383(2) ) and below (d 3.329(2), 3.331(2), 3.353(2) and 3.355(2) ) the 3,5-DNBA molecule 
forming the dimer.  
In the wider crystal structure, similarly to 3,5-DNBA MCZ, molecules of In-3-Ac pack around the 
3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded dimer such that the acid groups lie in a pocket, in an isolated 
environment (Figure 5.25).

dimer is shown in blue.  
Variable temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements on 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac  
Variable temperature measurements were carried out on 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac at the DLS from 100 
to 300 K, in 50 K steps.  
The CO and C=O bond lengths of the carboxylic acid groups forming the hydrogen bonded 
dimers were followed as a function of temperature (Table 5.17 and Figure 5.26). Over the 100 to 
300 K temperature range, a linear trend of the CO bond lengths shortening and the C=O bond 
lengths lengthening with temperature occurs. This suggests the presence of temperature dependent 
disorder in this molecular complex. At 100 K, the CO and C=O bond lengths deviate from the 
average for an aromatic carboxylic acid, being 1.282(2) and 1.251(2)  respectively. Proton 
disorder is therefore indicated at low temperature. At 300 K, the CO and C=O bond lengths are 
very close in length, at 1.272(2) and 1.263(2)  respectively, suggesting a high extent of disorder 
in the proton position at this temperature; though not such that a 50:50 split occupancy is 
suggested as the CO and C=O bonds are not fully equalised.

Figure 5.26 The CO and C=O bond lengths of the carboxylic acid groups forming the hydrogen bonded dimer as a 
function of temperature in 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac. 
The OHO hydrogen bond parameters of the 3,5-DNBA dimer were also followed as a function 
of temperature (Table 5.18 and Figure 5.27). The OO hydrogen bond distance remains constant 
between 100 and 250 K whilst a large increase occurs at 300 K. This jump may be caused by the 
3,5-DNBA dimer lying parallel to the a-axis which experiences a sharp increase in length between 
250 and 300 K from 15.8620(5)  to 15.948(3) .  
The hydrogen atom parameters in the OHO are less informative about the temperature 
dependent proton disorder in this molecular complex than the CO and C=O bond lengths. The 
elongated OH and shortened HO bond distances indicate the presence of disorder at 100 K 
(dOH 1.19(4)  and dHO 1.45(4) ), however, over the temperature range, they indicate little 
about the change in disorder occurring, remaining essentially unchanged up to 200 K. At 250 K, 
the refined hydrogen atom position is moved towards the centre of the bond, this is an indicator of 
a possible increase in disorder at this temperature. The thermal parameter of the dimer proton is 
large at 100 K (0.112(13) 
) and may suggest the presence of disorder at this temperature 
however, there is little change in this value over the temperature range and so it does not give 
additional insight into how the disorder changes with temperature. In this molecular complex, the 
hydrogen atom parameters therefore may be tentatively used to identify the presence of proton 
disorder initially, but do not indicate how the disorder changes with temperature.

Figure 5.27 The OH and HO bond lengths of OHO dimer hydrogen bonds with temperature in  
3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac. 
Variable temperature Fourier difference maps were generated for the 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded 
dimer (Figure 5.28). In agreement with changes being observed in the CO/C=O bond lengths 
with temperature, a change in the hydrogen atom density in the Fourier difference maps also 
occurs. However, this change is not as consistent as the trend seen in the CO and C=O bond 
lengths as a function of temperature. At 100 K, a second peak with weak intensity is present in the 
Fourier difference map suggesting proton disorder at this temperature. This is in agreement with 
the CO and C=O bond lengths, which deviate slightly at 100 K from the average distances for 
an aromatic carboxylic acid. A significant increase in the intensity of the second peak occurs at 
150 K suggesting an increase in the extent of proton disorder; this is a greater increase than 
suggested by the CO and C=O bond lengths which change in length by a relatively small 
amount between these temperatures. The signal of the second peak appears to decrease between 
150 and 200 K whilst the CO and C=O bond lengths continue along the linear trend of 
lengthening and shortening. The intensity of the second site then increases once more between 
200 and 300 K. At 300 K, the intensities of the peaks for the two proton sites are almost equal, and 
suggest a large degree of proton disorder, approaching, but not quite equal to, a 50:50 occupancy, 
coinciding with that suggested by the CO and C=O bond lengths at this temperature (dCO 
1.272(3)  and dC=O 1.263(2) ).  
The variable temperature Fourier difference maps are thus able to identify temperature dependent 
proton disorder in 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac and also reveal some information about the extent of proton 
disorder occurring. However, the suggested proton disorder behaviour is only in agreement with 
that suggested by the CO and C=O bond lengths at the temperature extremes of 100 and 300 K. 
This lack of agreement may be due to significant amounts of noise in the Fourier difference maps 
for these molecular complexes such that elements of the true proton disorder behaviour are hidden. 
For this molecular complex, the trend in the proton disorder is best assessed in the CO and C=O 
bond lengths, but this interpretation is supported by the other factors observed; hydrogen atom 
parameters and Fourier difference maps.  
Figure 5.28 Variable temperature Fourier difference maps showing the electron density associated with the H-atom in 
the 3,5-DNBA dimer hydrogen bonds in 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac.  
The potential to refine accurate occupancies for the proton sites as a function of temperature was 
investigated for 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac. A structural model where the hydrogen atom is disordered 
over two sites in the dimer hydrogen bond was refined (Table 5.19).  
The refined occupancy values follow the trend of increasing disorder with temperature, as 
suggested by the CO and C=O bond lengths and Fourier difference maps. However, the extent 
of disorder at each temperature is greater than that suggested by the equivalent CO and C=O 
bond distances. For example, at 100 K, a split proton site occupancy of 56:44 has been refined. 
However, the CO and C=O bond lengths at this temperature are far from being equivalent in 
length and the intensity of a second hydrogen site is only small in the Fourier difference maps. 
This suggests that, even considering the estimated 10 % error on refined occupancy values from 
X-rays, for this molecular complex, these values should be down weighted in importance when 
quantifying extents of proton disorder.

values have an estimated error of approximately 10 %.

5.4.4 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB 
In the crystal structure of 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB at 100 K (DLS), the two components crystallise in a 
2:1 ratio, in space group I2/a. A 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded 2
2(8) dimer is present in the 
structure, where the 3,5-DNBA molecules are held together by strong to moderate strength  
OHO hydrogen bonds (dOO  2.668(4) at 100 K) and are related by an inversion centre at the 
centre of the 2
2(8) hydrogen bonded ring (Figure 5.29).

() dimer in the molecular complex of 3,5-DNBA 
1,4-DIB at 100 K: (a) perpendicular to the dimer plane and (b) in plane of the dimer. 
Within the hydrogen bonded dimer, the aromatic rings of the two 3,5-DNBA molecules are in the 
same layer (0.096  between aromatic ring planes) and the hydrogen bonded carboxylic acid 
group is twisted slightly out of co-planarity of the 3,5-DNBA aromatic ring on dimer formation 
(twisted by  5.5(5) ). In the 2
2(8) hydrogen bonded ring, the carboxylic acid groups are tilted 
relative to one another (COO angle of 108(3)  and a C=OO angle of 124(1) ). The nitro 
groups are non-planar, twisted by 18.9(5) and 5.6(5)  out of co-planarity with the aromatic ring.  
Molecular packing 
In the crystal structure of 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB, there are short contacts in the local packing 
environment of the carboxylic acid groups forming the 3,5-DNBA dimer (Figure 5.30). Contacts 
form only to other 3,5-DNBA molecules in the local environment.

complex of 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB. For clarity, the packing is shown for one side of the centrosymmetric dimer only: (a) 
and (b) show the packing from different perspectives. 
The carboxylic acid hydroxyl group interacts with the local environment via a weak CHO 
hydrogen bond (dCO 3.438(4) , <CHO 143.9 ) to an aromatic CH group and a weak OO 
(dOO 3.019(4) ) to a nitro group in the same neighbouring 3,5-DNBA molecule; the interaction 
distance is just less than the sum of the van der Waals radii for the two atoms (3.04 ) and 
therefore can be considered as significant. A number of -interactions form to the carboxylic acid 
carbonyl group including an anti-parallel carbonyl-nitro  interaction (d 2.982(4) and 
2.934(4) ) to a nitro group in a neighbouring 3,5-DNBA molecule and a -interaction to an 
aromatic carbon in a neighbouring 3,5-DNBA molecule (d 3.169(4) ). A 3,5-DNBA molecule 
also stacks below the carboxylic acid group forming a  contact and interacting via its nitro 
group (d 3.149(5) ).  
Intermolecular interactions also occur between the 3,5-DNBA molecule, in each dimer, and the 
local environment (Figure 5.31) and involve both 3,5-DNBA and 1,4-DIB molecules. 
Figure 5.31 The local packing environments of the 3,5-DNBA molecule in the centrosymmetric hydrogen bonded dimer 
in the 2:1 complex of 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB. For clarity, the packing is shown for one side of the centrosymmetric dimer 
only. 
Weak interactions form to both 3,5-DNBA nitro groups of the 3,5-DNBA molecule forming the 
centrosymmetric dimer. The nitro group on the protonated side of 3,5-DNBA molecule forms 
weak CHO hydrogen bonds to both nitro oxygen atoms through interaction with aromatic  
CH groups donated from 1,4-DIB molecules (dCO 3.385(6) and 3.445(6) ). One of the nitro 
oxygens forms a IO halogen bond (dIO 3.432(3) ) with a neighbouring 1,4-DIB molecule; the 
interaction distance is just less than the sum of the van der Waals radii for the two atoms (3.5 ) 
and therefore can be considered significant. The other nitro oxygen forms an OO contact to a 
neighbouring 3,5-DNBA nitro group (dOO 2.852(4) ); considerably less than the sum of the van 
der Waals radii (3.04 ) and therefore significant. Additional -contacts form to aromatic -
density in neighbouring 3,5-DNBA (d 3.061(4) and 3.149(5) ) and 1,4-DIB (d 3.138(5) ) 
molecules involving both nitro oxygen atoms. Fewer interactions form to the nitro group on the 
non-protonated side of the 3,5-DNBA molecule forming the centrosymmetric dimer. Both nitro 
oxygen atoms interact with a nitro group of a neighbouring 3,5-DNBA forming OO contacts 
(dOO 2.852(4) and 3.019(4) )); these are less than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.04 ) 
and therefore can be considered significant. One of the nitro oxygen atoms is also involved in anti-
parallel nitro-carbonyl -interactions to an acid group in a neighbouring 3,5-DNBA molecule (d 
2.934(4) and 2.982(4) ). An additional weak CHO hydrogen bond forms on the non-
protonated side of the 3,5-DNBA molecule involving an aromatic CH at the 2-position and a 
hydroxyl oxygen in a neighbouring 3,5-DNBA molecule (dCO 3.438(4) ).   
The wider packing of each dimer in 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB occurs in layers of each component; 
(Figure 5.32). This illustrates that the 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded dimer acid groups are involved 
in an extensive range of interactions within the local environment.

dimer is shown in blue.  
Variable temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements on 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB  
Variable temperature measurements were carried out on 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB at the DLS from 100 
to 300 K, in 100 K steps.  
The CO and C=O bond lengths of the carboxylic acid groups forming the hydrogen bonded 
dimers were followed as a function of temperature (Table 5.20 and Figure 5.33). Over the 100 to 
300 K temperature range, a linear trend of the CO bond lengths shortening and the C=O bond 
lengths lengthening with temperature occurs suggesting temperature dependent proton disorder. At 
100 K, the CO and C=O bond lengths (dCO 1.306(5)  and 1.227(5) ) are equivalent to those 
for an ordered aromatic carboxylic acid suggesting there is no proton disorder at this temperature. 
The onset of proton disorder is indicated at 200 K, where the CO and C=O bond lengths deviate 
from the values for an ordered aromatic carboxylic acid.  At 300 K, there is a significant deviation 
of the CO bond length (dCO 1.265(6) ) and some deviation of the C=O bond length (dCO 
1.239(6) ). A significant extent of proton disorder occurring is therefore likely at 300 K however, 
not to the extent that 50:50 disorder is suggested.

Figure 5.33 The CO and C=O bond lengths of the carboxylic acid groups forming the hydrogen bonded dimer as a 
function of temperature in 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB. 
The OHO hydrogen bond parameters of the 3,5-DNBA dimer were also followed as a function 
of temperature (Table 5.21). The OO distance remains constant over the temperature range. 
Little change occurs in the OH and HO distances as a function of temperature; this is a result 
of the distance restraint applied to the OH distance in order to achieve a stable refinement of the 
hydrogen atom position in the presence of the heavy iodine atom. These parameters therefore 
cannot be used to identify or quantify the temperature dependent proton disorder in this sample. 
The size of the isotropic thermal parameter (Uiso) for the dimer hydrogen bond hydrogen atom 
starts at a very small value at 100 K, again likely a result of the presence of the heavy iodine atom 
affecting the refinement, and then increases significantly at 200 K; this may indicate the onset of 
proton disorder at this temperature, as suggested by the deviating CO and C=O bond lengths. 
There is no further change in the size of hydrogen atom thermal parameter at 300 K and so this 
parameter reveals little about how the disorder changes with temperature. In this molecular 
complex, the hydrogen atom parameters therefore may be tentatively used to identify the presence 
of proton disorder initially, but do not indicate how the disorder changes with temperature once 
present. The presence of the heavy iodine atom undoubtedly affects the capability of this 
parameter being exploited as an indicator of disorder in this case.

Variable temperature Fourier difference maps were generated for the 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded 
dimer (Figure 5.34). In agreement with changes observed in the CO and C=O bond lengths with 
temperature, a change in the hydrogen atom density in the Fourier difference maps also occurs. At 
100 K, a single hydrogen atom peak is present indicating an ordered carboxylic acid group, in 
agreement with the CO and C=O bond lengths (dCO 1.306(5)  and 1.227(5) ). At 200 K, a 
second, very weak hydrogen atom peak is present in the Fourier difference map suggesting a small 
extent of proton disorder at this temperature, similarly to the indications from the CO and C=O 
bond lengths which deviate at this temperature. At 300 K, the intensity of the second hydrogen 
atom peak increases, suggesting an increase in extent of disorder, however this is only very slight 
in comparison to the more significant change in the CO and C=O bond lengths. There are large 
amounts of noise in the Fourier difference maps for 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB as a result of the presence 
of the iodine atom. This makes it more difficult to distinguish the residual density of the hydrogen 
atom from the background noise and determine its behaviour.  
The variable temperature Fourier difference maps are therefore able to identify temperature 
dependent proton disorder in 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB and also reveal some information about the 
extent of proton disorder occurring. However, with iodine present, there are large amounts of noise 
present in the maps, and the proton disorder is best assessed in the CO and C=O bond lengths. 
Figure 5.34 Variable temperature Fourier difference maps showing the electron density associated with the H-atom in 
the 3,5-DNBA dimer hydrogen bonds in 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB. 
The potential to refine accurate occupancies for the proton sites as a function of temperature was 
investigated for 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB. A structural model where the hydrogen atom is disordered 
over two sites in the dimer hydrogen bond was refined (Table 5.22). Considering the noise present 
in the Fourier difference maps, it seems unlikely that it is possible to refine the proton occupancies 
accurately. At 100 K, occupancies of 89:11 are refined. Considering the ordered CO and C=O 
bond lengths and the lack of a second peak in the Fourier difference maps, this is a reasonable 
approximation to the more likely situation of the occupancy split being 100:0, where no disorder is 
present; the 89:11 refined occupancy split is likely to be the result of density in the form of Fourier 
ripples being mis-identified as a second site. The extent of proton disorder suggested by the 
refined occupancies increases from 89:11, at 100 K, to 78:22, at 200 K. This may be a reasonable 
estimate, as the CO and C=O bond lengths and Fourier difference maps of the dimer hydrogen 
bonds also suggest some proton disorder at this temperature. At 300 K, the occupancies of the two 
proton sites are 54:46. This almost 50:50 occupancy is not reflected in the CO and C=O bond 
lengths or the Fourier difference maps suggesting these values to be less reliable. Again, these 
refinements are likely to be affected by the presence of the iodine atom.

5.4.5 Determining the energy difference between proton configurations 
An attempt was made to calculate the difference in energy, H, between the two proton sites in 
the 3,5-DNBA molecular complexes, achieved by applying Arrhenius behaviour to the occupancy 
values using Equation 5.1 and Equation 5.4. 
Equation 5.1   =
 
where K is the configuration ratio, PA is the occupancy of proton site one and PB is the occupancy 
of the proton site two . The variation in K with temperature then allows thermodynamic parameters 
to be extracted as follows: 
Equation 5.2  =  
Equation 5.3  =    
Equation 5.4   =   (
) + (
The same analysis was attempted using the more reliable CO and C=O bond lengths where the 
configuration ratio, K, was given by: 
Equation 5.5   =  
(). 
(=).
where 1.2  is the approximate minimum C=O distance.  
From these values, a plot of lnK vs (1/T) therefore gives H and S (Figure 5.35 and Table 5.23).

When using the occupancy values of the proton configurations, the proton disorder follows 
classical Arrhenius jump behaviour between 100 and 300 K for the molecular complexes of 3,5-
DNBA 3-ABCN and 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac, shown by a linear increase in K with temperature. In the 
case of 3,5-DNBA MCZ and 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB, the fit to Arrhenius behaviour is less good, 
likely to be caused by incorrect occupancy values. When using the CO and C=O bond lengths, 
the proton disorder strongly follows classical Arrhenius behaviour between 100 and 300 K for the 
molecular complexes of 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN, 3,5-DNBA MCZ and 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac; in the 
case of 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB, the fit to Arrhenius behaviour does not hold at 100 K, seen by a less 
steep increase in K. Where Arrhenius behaviour does not fit at low temperatures, this has 
previously been attributed to quantum tunnelling effects; occupation of the second site occurs 
without the same classical temperature dependence. 
100, 102
The energy difference between the two proton configurations (H) in hydrogen bonded dimers of 
benzoic acid is 0.12 kcal mol
 Similar magnitudes of H are calculated here for the  
3,5-DNBA molecular complexes. The negative values of H indicate an endothermic reaction; 
expected where an increase in population of the second site occurs with temperature, as described 
by Boltzmann statistics for a chemical system at equilibrium. 
 The values of H calculated 
using the occupancy values and CO and C=O bond lengths indicate that 3,5-DNBA MCZ and 
3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac have the lowest energy difference between the two proton configurations 
whilst larger energy differences between the two proton configurations are indicated for 3,5-
DNBA 1,4-DIB, 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN dimer 1 and dimer 2. This suggests a greater symmetry in 
the double wells of the dimer hydrogen bond potential energy surface in 3,5-DNBA MCZ and 3,5-
DNBA In-3-Ac than in 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB, 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN dimer 1 and dimer 2. 
In cases where there is significantly less agreement in the refined occupancy values with the trends 
from the CO and C=O bond lengths and Fourier difference maps as a function of temperature, 
the energy differences between the two proton configurations is likely to be more accurate where 
calculated using the more reliable CO and C=O bond lengths.  
5.4.6 Following temperature dependent proton disorder using synchrotron X-ray 
diffraction 
It was possible to follow proton disorder as a function of temperature in the molecular complexes 
studied, using the synchrotron X-ray diffraction technique. The determination is most reliable in 
the heavy atom CO and C=O bond lengths, this is not unexpected as, provided good resolution 
of data, the carbon and oxygen atoms can be accurately located in the structure. In favourable 
circumstances, the Fourier difference maps revealing information about the onset and extent of 
proton disorder occurring at each temperature were found to be in agreement with the trends 
indicated in the CO and C=O bond lengths. This is as indicated in the initial comparative 
diffraction study. In several cases, the determination of the proton disorder is hindered by large 
extents of noise in the Fourier difference maps; this is the case in 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac and 3,5-
DNBA 1,4-DIB; here, considering the changes in the CO and C=O bond lengths is even more 
important for elucidating the proton disorder behaviour. This emphasises the importance of having 
good quality Fourier difference maps for the reliable determination of proton behaviour in these 
studies. 
The refined carboxyl group hydrogen atom positions and isotropic thermal parameters, when 
considered in conjunction with the CO/C=O bond lengths and Fourier difference maps, also 
indicate the presence of proton disorder in the molecular complexes but only when freely refined 
and in general do not reveal information about the extent occurring at each temperature; in the case 
of 3,5-DNBA MCZ and 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB, a stable refinement could only be achieved on 
applying a restraint to the OH distance so the refined hydrogen atom parameters were less 
informative about the proton disorder. Beyond the comparative study on 3,5-DNBA II, the refined 
occupancy values are not particularly reliable in the majority of cases for the determination of 
proton disorder extent, disagreeing with the CO/C=O bond lengths and density in the Fourier 
difference maps. This remains a disadvantage in using this technique, in that reliably refined 
proton sites occupancies only appear achievable when conditions are optimised, as for 3,5-DNBA 
II. The Arrhenius behaviour determined using the proton site occupancies therefore should be 
considered with caution whilst those determined using the CO/C=O bond lengths may give a 
better indication of the difference in energy between the two proton configurations in future.  
The measurements at the ALS, for 3,5-DNBA II, 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN and 3,5-DNBA MCZ, in 
addition to those at the DLS and being consistent with the DLS results, provide further evidence in 
support of the proton disorder behaviour observed. This is in spite of these being generally lower 
in data quality, indicated by greater noise in the Fourier difference maps, such that only the C
O/C=O bond lengths are reliable for the disorder behaviour determination. 
Critically, the use of the synchrotron technique facilitates the study of the variable temperature 
proton disorder behaviour across a number of temperatures and in a number of systems. This 
allows greater details about the evolving nature of the proton disorder to be found and increases 
the set of materials over which the disorder behaviour can be rationalised.  
5.5 The effect of local environment on proton disorder in 3,5-DNBA 
dimers 
Varying degrees of proton disorder occurred in the 3,5-DNBA dimers across the molecular 
complexes, as a function of temperature which may be rationalised in the crystal packing. 
Variable temperature proton disorder in the molecular complexes 
Variable temperature proton disorder occurs in all four molecular complexes, observed most 
reliably in the CO and C=O bond lengths and Fourier difference maps of the dimer hydrogen 
bonds. The temperature dependence of the proton disorder can be modelled by the classical 
Arrhenius jump model, where thermal activation on increasing the temperature leads effectively to 
hopping over the energy barrier to the second proton site. This means that population of the second 
site occurs with increased temperature, due to increased thermal energy; however, it should be 
noted that this may also be a consequence of the shape of the potential energy surface changing 
with temperature, a possibility not investigated in this work. One exception to this fit to Arrhenius 
behaviour is 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB, where this model does not hold at 100 K, and may suggest 
quantum tunnelling to be dominant in this molecular complex at this temperature.   
3,5-DNBA MCZ and 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac are the most disordered systems with the lowest disorder 
onset temperatures, at or below 100 K, and display the greatest extents of disorder occurring at 
each temperature; the proton disorder is greatest overall in 3,5-DNBA MCZ indicated by the CO 
and C=O bond lengths being closer over the temperature range and the signal for the second 
hydrogen atom being stronger in the Fourier difference maps over the full temperature range 
studied. The smallest energy difference between the two proton configurations from the Arrhenius 
analysis is also suggested for these two molecular complexes. This suggests a more symmetric 
double well potential energy surface for the dimer hydrogen bond in these molecular complexes 
where there is little difference in energy between the two proton sites. Proton disorder is also 
present in 3,5-DNBA dimer 2 at 100 K, however the extents of disorder occurring at each 
temperature is less than for 3,5-DNBA MCZ and 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac. This indicates a more 
asymmetric double well potential energy surface for the dimer hydrogen bond and may also 
indicate a larger energy barrier between the two proton sites. 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN dimer 1 and 3,5-
DNBA 1,4-DIB are the least disordered systems having the higher disorder onset temperatures, at 
200 K, and lower extents of disorder occurring at each temperature. Larger energy differences 
between the proton configurations are also indicated in these molecular complexes by Arrhenius 
analysis. This indicates a very asymmetric double well potential energy surface for the dimer 
hydrogen bonds in these molecular complexes with potentially a large barrier between the two 
proton sites.  
Local packing effects on proton disorder 
The proton disorder characteristics of each molecular complex may be rationalised in the crystal 
packing; where the proton behaviour reflects the nature of the hydrogen bond potential energy 
surface, this may indicate the role of the local environment in its tuning. This may allow certain 
proton disorder behaviour to be designed into future materials or where proton transfer processes 
lead to certain properties, may allow property tuning via crystal packing.  
The proton disorder in molecular complexes 3,5-DNBA MCZ and 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac occurs at a 
low onset temperature and to large extents at each temperature. A close to symmetric double well 
potential energy surface is therefore indicated for the dimer hydrogen bonds in 3,5-DNBA MCZ 
and 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac. This proton disorder behaviour occurs in these molecular complexes 
where the local environment of the acid groups forming the dimer hydrogen bonds are in isolated 
pockets with no direct interactions to the carboxylic acid groups, with only -contacts forming to 
the acid carbon atoms. The crystal packing environment where there are no interactions to the 
carboxylic acid oxygen atoms therefore appears to favour a more symmetric double well hydrogen 
bond potential where proton disorder is likely. A similar effect is observed in several reported 
molecular complexes containing the 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded dimer (CSD refcodes 
GAUTAM (3,5-DNBA and 4-dimethylamino benzoic acid), 
 KIZQOZ (3,5-DNBA and N-
Isopropylcarbazole) 
 and KIZREQ (3,5-DNBA and N-Isobutylcarbazole)). 
 In these molecular 
complexes, there are no interactions between the carboxylic acid oxygens and the local 
environment, with only -stacking above the acid carbon occurring. In this packing environment, 
the CO and C=O bond length within the carboxylic acid are either equalised, or close to being 
so, at room temperature (dCO and dC=O are 1.259(4) and 1.256(4) , respectively in GAUTAM, 
are 1.266(2) and 1.251(2) , respectively in KIZQOZ and are 1.269(3) and 1.253(4) , 
respectively, in KIZREQ) suggesting significant extents of proton disorder and therefore a close to 
symmetric double well potential energy surface for the dimer hydrogen bond.  
In the molecular complexes where a lower extent of proton disorder occurs at each temperature, 
such as in 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN dimer 2 or the onset temperature for proton disorder is higher, 
including in 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN dimer 1 and 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB, less symmetric double well 
potential energy surfaces for the dimer hydrogen bonds are indicated. This proton disorder 
behaviour occurs where the 3,5-DNBA carboxylic acid groups are involved in a significant 
number of interactions to the local environment. Specifically, the local environments include weak 
CHO hydrogen bonds and OO interactions of the carboxylic acid oxygen atoms with nitro 
groups. These interactions occur with varying strengths, and in different numbers and 
arrangements, to each end of the OHO dimer hydrogen bonds for each molecular complex. 
The presence and asymmetric arrangement of these interactions appears to be influencing an 
asymmetry in the dimer hydrogen bond, reflected in the lesser and different extents of proton 
disorder in these three complexes. A similar effect is observed in several reported molecular 
complexes containing 3,5-DNBA hydrogen bonded dimers (CSD refcodes ABUNOA, 
AJIXOH, 
 YIVHUI01, 
 and ZUPJOJ). 
 In these molecular complexes, there is an 
asymmetric arrangement of interactions between the carboxylic acid oxygens and the local 
environment, including weak CHO hydrogen bonds and nitro-carbonyl group -interactions. 
The CO and C=O bond of the carboxylic acid indicate low extents of proton disorder in these 
complexes (dCO and dC=O  are 1.287(3) and 1.244(3) , respectively at 298 K in ABUNOA, are 
1.306(2) and 1.225(2) , respectively in AJIXOH at 200 K, are 1.306(2) and 1.230(2) , 
respectively in YIVHUI01 at 100 K and are 1.279(6) and 1.229(5)  in ZUPJOJ at 298 K) and 
therefore an asymmetric double well potential energy surface for the dimer hydrogen bond is 
indicated when in these packing environments.  
These observations add further weight to the conclusion made by Jones et al. (2013) that weak 
interactions in the local environment of the dimer carboxylic acid groups play a role in 
determining the presence and nature of proton disorder in these systems; 
 having an effect of 
tuning the nature of the hydrogen bond potential energy surface.  
Packing subtleties 
It is apparent that the absence of intermolecular interactions in the local environment of the 
carboxylic acid groups of the dimer hydrogen bonds favours a symmetric hydrogen bond double 
well potential energy surface and therefore larger extents of proton disorder, whilst their presence 
favours an asymmetric hydrogen bond potential energy surface and proton ordering. There are, 
however, additional subtleties in the packing that should be explored.  
In 3,5-DNBA MCZ and 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac, the carboxylic acid groups of the dimer hydrogen 
bonds do not form any interactions with the local environment and as such the dimer hydrogen 
bond environment should be symmetric with a symmetry in the double wells of its potential 
energy surface; 50:50 proton disorder would be expected at 100 K. This is not the case in 3,5-
DNBA MCZ and 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac and the extents of disorder, suggested by the CO and C=O 
bond lengths and Fourier difference maps at 100 K, is also different between these complexes; a 
greater extent is suggested in 3,5-DNBA MCZ. This may be due to a number of factors. The fact 
that 50:50 proton disorder is not achieved at 100 K in either complex may be caused by the local 
environment of the rest of the 3,5-DNBA molecule in each dimer (3,5-DNBA MCZ, see Figure 
5.17 and 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac, see Figure 5.24). In these two molecular complexes, the number of 
interactions, types of groups forming these, and interaction distances involved, differs between the 
protonated and non-protonated side of the 3,5-DNBA molecules forming the dimer. This may be 
sufficient to alter the electronics of 3,5-DNBA on each side of the molecule to different extents 
such that an imbalance in the symmetry of the carboxylic acid groups is created, preventing the 
formation of a symmetric double well potential energy surface for the dimer hydrogen bond and a 
50:50 proton disorder resulting. The difference in the extents of disorder occurring at 100 K 
between 3,5-DNBA MCZ and 3.5-DNBA In-3-Ac may also be related to the nature of the co-
molecule, which in 3,5-DNBA MCZ is a three fused ring structure with an acid group attached and 
in 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac is a two fused ring structure with a methyl group attached. These co-
molecules have different electronics and so may cause different perturbations to the 3,5-DNBA 
molecule on interaction. In general, the interactions formed between 3,5-DNBA and In-3-Ac 
molecules are shorter than those formed between 3,5-DNBA and MCZ molecules; this may lead to 
a greater perturbation effect in 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac and cause the lower extent of proton disorder 
occurring in this complex.  
A further subtlety in crystal packing effects on proton disorder may be investigated in the 
molecular complex of 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN, where two 3,5-DNBA dimers are present which 
exhibit differing degrees of temperature dependent proton disorder; dimer 2 shows a greater extent 
of proton disorder than dimer 1. These dimers are free from electronic effects introduced by 
different components and so increaingly subtle packing effects can be studied. The 
centrosymmetric hydrogen bonded 2
2(8) ring formed between the 3,5-DNBA carboxylic acid 
groups is highly involved in interactions with the local environment in both dimer 1 and dimer 2. 
At a glance, the carboxylic acid groups of dimer 1 appear to be in a more symmetric environment 
than those of dimer 2 (Figure 5.9), where the same type of interaction, a weak CHO hydrogen 
bond, is formed on either side of the acid dimer. However, they are not of the same length. The 
nature of the CH groups forming the weak CHO hydrogen bonds, to either end of the dimer 
hydrogen bond, also differ as a result of the functional groups on the 3-ABCN molecule; a strongly 
electron withdrawing (EW) group (nitrile) and a strongly electron donating (ED) group (amino) 
are at the one and three position, respectively. ED groups may increase the acidity of an aromatic 
CH at the ortho and para positions, whilst EW groups increase the acidity at the meta positions. 
For the 3-ABCN molecule interacting with acid dimer 1, the nitrile group directs to the CH 
interacting with the carbonyl oxygen and the amino group directs to the CH group interacting 
with the hydroxyl oxygen. Therefore, as the amino and nitrile group have differing directing 
abilities, the acidity of the two CH groups involved in the weak CHO are very different and 
the interaction with the dimer oxygen atoms is different in each case leading to different 
perturbation effects at each end of the dimer hydrogen bond. The local environment of the dimer is 
therefore asymmetric. The CO and C=O bond lengths and Fourier difference maps indicate a 
more symmetric environment in dimer 2, over the temperature range. This raises the question of 
what is causing the carboxylic acid environment to be more symmetric in dimer 2 than in dimer 1. 
This could be caused by a number of crystal packing effects. The greater symmetry in dimer 2 may 
be attributed to the interactions formed to each end of the dimer hydrogen bond being less 
significant; the local environment of dimer 2 includes a weak CHO hydrogen bond with low 
directionality (<CHO 123(1) ) and a weak OO contact. In contrast, in the local environment of 
dimer 1, two weak CHO hydrogen bonds form with high directionality (<CHO 151(1)  and 
147(1) ); weak CHO hydrogen bonds formed to carboxylic acid dimers, if more directional, 
lead to a greater possibility of proton ordering. 
 Therefore, greater perturbation of the symmetry 
of the carboxylic acid or dimer hydrogen bonds may be being caused in dimer 1 than in dimer 2.  
The arrangement of molecules around the dimer hydrogen bonds may also be the cause for the 
difference in extents of proton disorder occurring between dimer 1 and 2 in 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN 
(Figure 5.36). Molecules of 3-ABCN are located above and below the plane of the acid dimer in 
dimer 1 and dimer 2. Around dimer 1, the 3-ABCN nitrile group points over the acid dimer with a 
slight bias towards the carboxylic acid hydroxyl oxygen (distances NOhydroxyl 3.377(2)  versus 
NOcarbonyl 3.467(2) ). In contrast, around dimer 2, the nitrile groups are in a different position, 
located on either side of the acid dimer, again near the hydroxyl oxygen atom but this time at a 
much longer distance (dNO 3.782(2) ). The closer proximity of the nitrile group to one side of 
the acid dimer in dimer 1, than in dimer 2, may be the cause for the greater asymmetry suggested 
in dimer 1; the nitrile group is very electron rich and may interact strongly with the nearby acid 
causing a greater perturbation effect on one side.

in 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN: viewed perpendicular to the plane of the dimer hydrogen bond in each case. The two symmetry 
independent 3-ABCN molecules are shown in green and yellow. 
Other effects suggested to influence proton disorder 
Additional effects on proton disorder have been investigated in the literature for hydrogen bonded 
substituted benzoic acid dimers.  
Planarity of the 3,5-DNBA molecule is not expected to affect the amount of disorder in 3,5-DNBA 
hydrogen bonded dimers. 
 This was indeed the case in the four 3,5-DNBA molecular complexes 
studied in this chapter. At 100 K, similar extents of proton disorder occur in 3,5-DNBA MCZ and 
3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac, although very different twist angles of the nitro groups out of planarity with 
the aromatic ring occur. There is also no correlation between the changes in 3,5-DNBA substituent 
group planarity with the extent of proton disorder occurring as a function of temperature; proton 
disorder increases in each of the 3,5-DNBA molecular complexes as a function of temperature but 
the co-planarity of the two nitro groups with the benzene ring does not change in the same way 
across the complexes.  
The extent of skew of carboxylic acid groups in a centrosymmetric hydrogen bonded 2
benzoic acid dimer may also reflect their interaction with the local environment. The skew of 
carboxylic acid groups is defined by the COO and C=OO angles. Average values for an 
ordered carboxylic acid dimer are 112 and 125 , respectively. 
 Extents of proton disorder may 
also be related to skew; where the skew is small (COO and C=OO angles are equal) this 
favours proton disordering and a more symmetric hydrogen bond double well potential whilst 
where the skew is large (C=OO angle is greater than the COO angle), this favours proton 
ordering and a more asymmetric hydrogen bond double well potential. 
 In the molecular 
complexes in this chapter (Table 5.24), at 100 K, the most symmetric environment, indicated by 
the COO and C=OO angles, occurs in 3,5-DNBA MCZ whilst the least symmetric occurs in 
3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB and 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN dimer 1; this agrees with the proton disorder 
behaviour observed. The skew of carboxylic acid groups is an additional measure of proton 
disorder which does not rely on accurately refined hydrogen atom positions and so may be useful 
to consider in X-ray studies where hydrogen atom positions are ambiguous.

5.6 Conclusions 
In this chapter, the technique of synchrotron X-ray diffraction has been explored and developed in 
the study of proton disorder processes in hydrogen bonded benzoic acid dimers of 3,5-DNBA. 
This technique allows maximum throughput of samples, addressing the lack of variable 
temperature measurements on these systems to date. It was hoped that, by adding to the number of 
samples in which temperature dependent disorder has been studied, further understanding of the 
effect of the crystal packing on tuning proton disorder may be achieved. This work builds on that 
by Jones et al. (2013). 
The initial bench marking of the synchrotron technique for the previously well studied disorder 
system of 3,5-DNBA II allowed insight into data optimisation methods to access the higher quality 
Fourier difference maps for the reliable determination of proton behaviour. A hemisphere 
approach was recommended allowing the greatest speed of collection with little compromise in 
Fourier difference map quality compared to the other strategies. This aids in the design of future 
experiments allowing proton behaviour to be probed at an increased number of temperatures with 
a reduction in experimental time. The detector trials revealed both detector types to be applicable 
in synchrotron studies of proton behaviour where the CCD detector is currently the most suited, 
routinely allowing the collection of good quality data from which relatively noise free Fourier 
difference maps could be generated, however, the preliminary results from the Pilatus detector are 
promising and indicate the need for further investigation into the use of this detector in such 
studies.  
Initial comparative diffraction studies of the high temperature proton disorder in 3,5-DNBA II 
revealed the synchrotron technique to be a promising method in the study of proton disorder 
processes; equivalent information about the disorder to that found previously from X-ray 
laboratory and neutron studies could be found. Certain caveats were noted including that, in the 
assessment of proton disorder behaviour from the synchrotron X-ray data, the more reliable CO 
and C=O bond lengths and Fourier difference maps should be given greater weighting than the less 
accurately determined refined hydrogen atom parameters. These caveats are applicable to all 
studies of proton behaviour using X-rays; greater confidence can be had in proton behaviour 
indicated by the refined hydrogen atom positions when supported by the undisputable heavy atom 
parameters and by good quality Fourier difference maps. 
Variable temperature single crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction was applied to previously known 
molecular complexes of 3,5-DNBA. By considering the CO and C=O bond lengths and Fourier 
difference maps alongside the refined hydrogen atom parameters, information about the degree 
and onset of proton disorder could be determined for each complex. As found in the optimisation 
studies, the CO and C=O bond lengths and Fourier difference maps were the most informative 
about the proton disorder; information about the disorder was less reliable when observed in the 
hydrogen atom parameters. This emphasises the problems encountered in determining behaviour 
from hydrogen atom information refined from X-ray data. The greatest extent of disorder over the 
temperature range was indicated in 3,5-DNBA MCZ and 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac whilst the least 
occurred in 3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB.  
The potential to follow the temperature dependent proton disorder in these molecular complexes 
allowed its rationalisation in the crystal packing, particularly in the variations in the 3,5-DNBA 
dimer local environment. It was found that a more symmetric double well hydrogen bond potential 
occurred, indicated by low onset temperatures and greater extents of proton disorder at each 
temperature, when the hydrogen bonded dimer carboxylic acid groups were isolated from direct 
interactions to the local environment, as in 3,5-DNBA MCZ and 3,5-DNBA In-3-Ac. The presence 
of weak interactions to the hydrogen bonded dimer carboxylic acid groups, in contrast, created a 
more asymmetric double well hydrogen bond potential, indicated by higher onset temperature 
lesser extents of proton disorder at each temperature, as in 3,5-DNBA 3-ABCN dimer 1 and 2 and 
3,5-DNBA 1,4-DIB. Additional subtleties in the crystal packing were also suggested to tune 
proton disorder including variations in the type or number of interactions to each end of the 
hydrogen bonded dimer or variations in the nature or position of the interacting group or co-
molecule. These observations add further weight to the hypothesis made by Jones et al. (2013) that 
weak interactions may affect the energetics of the dimer hydrogen bond and therefore play a role 
in tuning proton configuration in hydrogen bonded substituted benzoic acids. 
 This ability to tune 
proton behaviour by changes to the crystal packing, achieved on co-former variation, adds further 
insight into the perturbing effect of different types of interactions on proton dynamics. The role of 
weak interactions in structure control is further explored in Chapter 8. To investigate further the 
effect of local environment on the proton disorder in 3,5-DNBA molecular complexes, additional 
examples containing the 3,5-DNBA dimer would be beneficial. Additional substituted benzoic 
acid co-formers were trialled in this work for the design of new molecular complexes containing 
3,5-DNBA homo dimers, however these proved unsuccessful and further investigation is required.  
In this study, the use of synchrotron X-ray diffraction to follow proton disorder processes was 
possible, when first benchmarked against the Lab X-ray and neutron technique. Issues remain in 
the accurate determination of refined hydrogen atom parameters, evident in the 3,5-DNBA 
molecular complexes, and therefore this study would benefit from complementary single crystal 
neutron diffraction studies for a more accurate determination of proton site occupancies. However, 
where the comparative diffraction study showed agreement across the synchrotron, Lab X-ray and 
neutron data, and where proton disorder trends were observed in synchrotron X-ray diffraction 
study of 3,5-DNBA molecular complexes, some confidence can be invested in the results 
presented in this chapter and the conclusions made about the effect of local environment on proton 
disorder behaviour. This is important where increasing knowledge about the susceptibility of 
hydrogen bonds to chemical environment may allow, in future, proton transfer behaviour to be 
designed into crystalline materials; this may be advantageous in the design of functional materials 
with properties that may be attributed to proton transfer. 
Chapter 6.  
Crystal engineering short strong hydrogen bonds 
(SSHBs) for potential proton migration studies 
In this chapter, crystal engineering strategies are explored in the design of short strong hydrogen 
bonds (SSHBs) in the solid state for potential proton migration studies.  
6.1 Introduction and aims 
The short donor-acceptor distances of SSHBs (1.1.2) leads to a hydrogen bond potential energy 
surface that has a low barrier to proton transfer such that the proton transfer process of proton 
migration may be observed (1.3.2). 
 Proton migration across SSHBs may lead to certain 
physical properties within materials such as ferroelectricity 
 or colour change. 
 Its study in 
model systems may therefore aid in the understanding of these physical properties and their 
targeting in future materials; variable temperature diffraction methods are commonly  
employed. 
108, 109, 121
The predictable design of SSHBs in the solid state is difficult and even more so is the prediction of 
those that will have proton migration properties. It has been suggested that proton migration across 
SSHBs may occur only for very short donor-acceptor distances; proton migration has only been 
reported where the hydrogen bonding distance is less than 2.45  for OHO interactions 
in the region of 2.55  for N
HO
 interactions. 
110, 111, 267
 There are, however, few examples of 
temperature dependent proton migration across these SSHBs reported in the literature.  
In this chapter, several crystal engineering design strategies have been trialled to engineer SSHBs 
for potential proton migration studies. The design strategies include targeting the formation of the 
carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bonding synthon (1.2.1, Figure 1.11) between substituted 
urea and organic acid molecular building blocks. This synthon has led previously to OHO 
SSHBs which exhibit proton migration properties in urea phosphoric acid, 
 N,N-dimethylurea 
oxalic acid and N,N-dimethylurea oxalic acid. 
 A strategy of targeting charge transfer species 
such as the haloanilic acids alongside charge acceptor species such as N-heterocycles has also been 
trialled with the aim of forming charge assisted hydrogen bonds (CAHB) (1.3.3); charges on the 
hydrogen bond donor or acceptor group as a result of charge transfer can lead to a strengthened 
hydrogen bond.
 N-heterocycles with benzene carboxylic acids are also targeted where the 
combination of these molecular components has led to a number of molecular complexes with 
HO
 SSHBs including in pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid, 
 4,4-bipyridine 1,2,4,5-
tetracarboxylic acid, 
 isoniazid with 4-aminosalicylic acid 
 or OHN SSHBs including in 
isonicotinamide oxalic acid; 
 in all the complexes containing N
HO
, temperature 
dependent proton migration occurs.  
The effect of the acidity and basicity of molecular components on resulting hydrogen bond 
strength is also investigated by considering the nature of substituents and pKa values between 
components; the strongest and shortest of hydrogen bonds may be formed when pKa approaches 
zero. 
 The relationship between the hydrogen bonding and crystal packing in terms of the local 
environment of the hydrogen bonds and in terms of the wider packing including hydrogen bonding 
motifs is also explored; chemically equivalent hydrogen bonds in the same crystal structure have 
been shown to exhibit different proton transfer characteristics and is attributed to crystal 
packing. 
The molecular components investigated in this chapter in the design of SSHBs include basic 
components set 1, comprising substituted ureas and 3-deazauracil (Figure 6.1) and basic 
components set 2, containing N-heterocycles (Figure 6.2). Basic components sets 1 and 2 are 
combined with a range of organic acids (Figure 6.3). OHO and charge assisted N
 HO
SSHBs are targeted between molecular components; OHO SSHBs between set 1 basic 
components and the organic acids and charge assisted N
HO
 SSHBs between set 2 basic 
components and the organic acids. Whereas previous studies have focused on substituted ureas 
with straight chain dicarboxylic acids in the design of OHO SSHBs 
 for potential 
temperature dependent proton migration, the focus of this study is on substituted ureas with 
benzene mono and di-carboxylic acids.

The molecular components selected covered a range of pKa values to examine the effect of pKa 
values between components on SSHB length (Table 6.1). The pKa values were obtained, where 
possible, from literature sources. Where literature sources could not be found for a molecular 
component, the ACD-I Lab 
 was used to calculate or predict the values of pKa. Values were also 
calculated for the molecular components with pKa values obtained from literature sources, to 
check the calculation method; in most cases agreement was observed.

for specific atoms/groups whilst those predicted are pKa and ion fractions for molecular regions.

6.3 Engineering OHO SSHBs 
Twenty-seven molecular complexes containing an OHO hydrogen bonding interaction were 
synthesised from the combination of the set 1 basic molecular components with the organic acids. 
The OHO hydrogen bond is commonly formed between the substituted ureas (U) and benzene 
carboxylic acids (Ac) molecular building blocks in a carboxylic acid:amide U:Ac 2
2(8) hydrogen 
bonding synthon containing a strong OHO hydrogen bond, alongside a moderate strength  
NHO hydrogen bond (Figure 6.4(a)). In the 3-deazauracil and organic acid molecular 
complexes, a single strong OHO hydrogen bond connects the two different molecular building 
blocks (Figure 6.4(b)).  
Figure 6.4 Hydrogen bond synthons formed in the basic set 1 organic acid molecular complexes of (a) a carboxylic 
acid:amide 
() U:Ac hydrogen bonding synthon formed between substituted ureas (U) and benzene carboxylic acids 
(Ac) and (b) a single OHO hydrogen bond formed between the 3-deazauracil and organic acids.  
6.3.1 Substituted urea and benzene carboxylic acid molecular complexes 
In the substituted urea benzene carboxylic acid molecular complexes, the OHO hydrogen 
bonding interaction is formed in a carboxylic acid:amide U:Ac 2
2(8) hydrogen bonding synthon 
(Figure 6.4(a)). Related to the substitution of the molecular components and their crystallisation 
ratio, this synthon is utilised in forming a number of different hydrogen bonding motifs of varying 
stoichiometries; these include a U:Ac, U:Ac:U and Ac:U:Ac motif (Figure 1.11), as previously 
described by Alhalaweh et al. (2010). 
Substituted urea and benzoic acid molecular complexes 
The combination of the substituted urea and benzoic acid molecular building blocks results in a 1:1 
complex and the formation of the OHO hydrogen bonding interaction in a single carboxylic 
acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bonding synthon generating a U:Ac hydrogen bonding motif  
 (Figure 6.5). These molecular complexes include DMU2-NBA, DMU3-NBA, DMU3-CBA, 
DMU4-CBA, DMU3,5-DNBA, DMU2,4-DNBA and PhU2,4-DNBA. The di-substitution of the 
second amine group in the N,N-dimethylurea molecular complexes, the bulky group phenyl group 
in the N-phenylurea molecular complexes and the single carboxylic acid group on the benzoic 
acids prevents any further U:Ac synthons being formed. In DMU3-CBA, two independent U:A 
motifs are present and therefore can be better described as a 2:2 complex. In DMU2,4-DNBA, the 
formation of the U:A synthon occurs alongside the transfer of the 2,4-DNBA carboxylic acid 
hydrogen atom to the urea carbonyl and the SSHB is a O
HO
CAHB; DMU2,4-DNBA is 
therefore a salt. Proton transfer does not occur in any of the other U:Ac molecular complexes. 
Figure 6.5 Carboxylic acid:amide 
() U:Ac hydrogen bonding synthons in (a) DMU2-NBA, (b) DMU3-NBA,  
(c)i and ii DMU3-CBA, (d) DMU4-CBA, (e) DMU3,5-DNBA, (f) DMU2,4-DNBA and (g) PhU2,4-DNBA 
The OHO hydrogen bonding interactions are short enough to be considered SSHBs, with 
OO hydrogen bond distances in the range of 2.44 to 2.52  (Table 6.4). The shortest SSHB is 
formed in DMU2,4-DNBA, where it is charge assisted, with an OO hydrogen bond distance of 
2.446(1)  and an elongated OH distance of 1.08(2) ; this is characteristic of an SSHB with a 
symmetric single well potential. DMU2,4-DNBA is the only molecular complex containing an 
OHO SSHB with an OO hydrogen bond distance within the previously proposed limit of 
2.45  where proton migration may occur. In DMU3-CBA, two OHO SSHB are present in 
the two different U:Ac synthons with significantly differing OO hydrogen bond distances of 
2.472(2) and 2.481(2) ; this may be caused by crystal packing effects.

Substituted urea and benzene dicarboxylic acid molecular complexes 
The combination of the substituted ureas with benzene dicarboxylic acids, where there is an 
additional carboxylic acid group compared to the benzoic acids, resulted in different crystallisation 
ratios of components and the formation of OHO hydrogen bonds in different hydrogen 
bonding motifs.  
In nine of the substituted urea benzene dicarboxylic acid molecular complexes, components form a 
2:1 complex, respectively, and the formation of the OHO hydrogen bonds occurs via two 
carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bonding synthons generating a U:Ac:U hydrogen bonding 
motif (Figure 6.6); for UIP, which is better described as a 2:2 complex, a second different 
hydrogen bonding motif is also present. There is no proton transfer across the OHO hydrogen 
bonds in any of the molecular complexes containing the U:Ac:U motif. 
Figure 6.6 The U:Ac:U hydrogen bonding motif in molecular complexes (a) UIP, (b) DMUIP, (c) MU5-AIP,  
(d) DMU5-AIP, (e)i and ii DMUNIP, (f) DMUP and (g) U5-AIP and (h) PhU5-NIP II.  
OHO hydrogen bonding interactions are formed in the U:Ac:U molecular complexes with a 
range of OO hydrogen bond distances from 2.43 to 2.65  (Table 6.5). The OHO hydrogen 
bonding interactions short enough to be considered SSHBs are formed in DMUIP, DMU5-AIP, 
DMU5NIP, DMUP and PhU5-NIP II. Only in PhU5-NIP II for O11H100O10 is the OO 
hydrogen bond distance within the previously proposed limit of 2.45  where proton migration 
may occur; an elongated OH distance of 1.07(4)  is also present and is characteristic of an 
SSHB with a symmetric single well potential. In DMUP, O2H2O5 is just above the limit at 
2.452(2)  whilst in O3H1O6, an elongated OH distance of 1.09(3)  is present in a longer 
SSHB (dOO 2.493(2) ) and is again characteristic of an SSHB with a symmetric single well 
potential.

In eight of the substituted urea benzene dicarboxylic acid molecular complexes, OHO 
hydrogen bonds form in a carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bonding synthon involving one 
carboxylic acid group of the benzene dicarboxylic acid generating a U:Ac motif, whilst the second 
carboxylic acid group forms a single OHO hydrogen bond to a neighbouring substituted urea. 
In these molecular complexes, components are present in equivalent ratios; exceptions to this are 
MU5-NIP which is a 2:1 complex. In a number of cases, including MUIP, DMU3-NP, MUP and 
PhU3-NP, the single OHO hydrogen bond to a neighbouring substituted urea molecule 
connects U:Ac motifs (Figure 6.7). In MU5-NIP, the single OHO hydrogen bond forms to 
neighbouring N-methylurea which hydrogen bonds to an N-methylurea in a neighbouring U:Ac 
motif; motifs are connected by these N-methylurea:N-methylurea links (Figure 6.7(e)).  
Figure 6.7 The connection of U:A motifs via a single OHO hydrogen bond link in (a) MUIP, (b) DMU3-NP,  
(c) MUP, (d) PhU3-NP and (e) MU5-NIP. 
In the UIP and MU5-AIP structures, the single OHO hydrogen bond, formed between the 
second carboxylic acid group and a neighbouring substituted urea, forms a connection to the next 
U:Ac:U motif (Figure 6.8). The substituted urea in the U:Ac synthon also participates in a U:Ac:U 
hydrogen bonded motif. The result is a hydrogen bonded chain of U:Ac synthons, within which an 
Ac:U:Ac hydrogen bond motif is also present. In U5-NIP, the single OHO hydrogen bond, 
formed between the second carboxylic acid group and a neighbouring urea, connects to an 
extended hydrogen bonded chain of urea molecules which run through the structure (Figure 6.9).  
Figure 6.8 The U:Ac:U, Ac:U:Ac, U:Ac and single OHO hydrogen bond links in (a) UIP and (b) MU5-AIP. 
Figure 6.9 The hydrogen bond connections of U:Ac motifs and single OHO hydrogen bond links in U5-NIP.  
There is no proton transfer across the OHO hydrogen bonds in any of the molecular 
complexes. The OHO hydrogen bonding interactions form with a range of OO hydrogen 
bond distances from 2.47 to 2.66  (Table 6.6). SSHBs are formed in all molecular complexes, 
apart from PhU3-NP where the OO hydrogen bond distances are greater than 2.6 . None of the 
SSHBs are below the previously proposed limit of 2.45  for proton migration to occur; the SSHB 
O4H21O10 is the closest in U5-NIP at 2.470(1)  and also has an elongated OH distance of 
1.07(3) , characteristic of an SSHB with a symmetric single well potential.

The combination of N,N-dimethylurea and 5-aminoisophthalic acid (DMU5-AIP) leads to a very 
different structure to the other seventeen molecular complexes. The components crystallise in a 1:1 
ratio in which the OHO hydrogen bond forms instead in a three membered hydrogen bonded 
ring, graphset notation 3
4(10), as a result of intramolecular hydrogen transfer between the 5-AIP 
amine group and one of its carboxylic acid groups, forming zwitterions (Figure 6.10); DMU5-AIP 
is therefore a salt. A charge-assisted moderate strength N
HO
 hydrogen bond (dN+O
- 2.826 
) forms between the deprotonated carboxylic acid in one 5-aminoisophthalic acid molecule and 
the protonated amine group in another 5-aminoisophthalic acid molecule. A third  
5-aminoisophthalic acid molecule completes the ring through a strong charge assisted OHO
hydrogen bond to the deprotonated carboxylate group (dOO 2.591 ), and a second OHN
hydrogen bond with the protonated amine group, via an NHO hydrogen bonding interaction 
(dNO 2.838 ) (Table 6.7).

6.3.2 3-deazauracil organic acid molecular complexes 
The molecular complexes formed between 3-deazauracil and organic acid molecular components 
have the common feature of a single OHO hydrogen bond link between the 3-deazauracil 
carbonyl group and the organic acid hydroxyl group but are otherwise very different (Figure 6.11). 
It is not possible to identify a common hydrogen bonding motif beyond this single OHO 
hydrogen bond link. The component ratios in each complex also differ; 3-DAZABrA hydrate is a 
2:1:2 molecular complex, 3-DAZAClA and 3-DAZA2,4-DNBA are 1:1 complexes whilst  
3-DAZA3-NP is a 1:2 molecular complex. A carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthon 
forms alongside a single OHO hydrogen bond link in 3-DAZA2,4-DNBA. The formation of 
the OHO hydrogen bond link between components occurs with partial proton transfer of both 
BrA hydrogen atoms in 3-DAZABrA hydrate, complete proton transfer of one ClA hydrogen atom 
in ClA3-DAZA forming an O
HO
 CAHB and with no proton transfer in 3-DAZA2,4-DNBA 
and 3-DAZA3-NP.

(d) 3-DAZA3-NP. 
The OHO hydrogen bonding links between the 3-deazuracil and organic acid component form 
with a range of OO distances from 2.41 to 2.56  (Table 6.8). All the OHO hydrogen 
bonding links are short enough to be considered SSHBs. A very short OHO hydrogen bond is 
formed in 3-DAZABrA hydrate (dOO 2.411(2) ) well below the previously proposed limit of 
2.45  for proton migration to occur and where the hydrogen atom is symmetrically located, this is 
characteristic of an SSHB with a symmetric single well potential. In 3-DAZA2,4-DNBA, the 
SSHB OO distance, at 2.449(1) , is just below the previously proposed limit for proton 
migration to occur.

6.4 Engineering charge assisted N
HO
 SSHBs  
Seventeen molecular complexes were synthesised containing an N
HO
 charge assisted 
hydrogen bonding interaction between set 2 basic molecular components with the organic acid 
(benzene carboxylic acid or anilic acid) molecular building blocks.  
In several of the six-membered substituted N-heterocycle and benzene carboxylic acid molecular 
complexes, the charge-assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bond is assisted by a weak hydrogen bond 
between the carboxylate group and a hydrogen bond donor adjacent to the protonated nitrogen; a 
pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon (Figure 6.12(a)) results. This synthon has 
been commonly reported in pyridine carboxylic acid molecular complexes. 
 In the  
N-heterocycles and anilic acid molecular complexes, the charge assisted N
HO
 hydrogen 
bond is present in a number of motifs. Similar to other haloanilic acid molecular complexes, 
31, 138
a bifurcated 2
1(5) N
H(O)O
 hydrogen bond prevails between the deprotonated anilic acid group 
and a protonated N-heterocycle nitrogen atom (Figure 6.12(b)). Single charge assisted  
HO
hydrogen bonds also form between the N-heterocycle and haloanilic acid molecular 
components either singly (Figure 6.12 (c)), or alongside a water molecule which forms a 
bifurcated hydrogen bond with the deprotonated group (Figure 6.12(d)).  
Figure 6.12 The hydrogen bonding motifs formed in the N-heterocycle organic acid molecular complexes: (a) a

HO
 hydrogen bond and (c) a single N
HO
 hydrogen bond forms to the 
deprotonated acid alone or (d) alongside a water molecule which forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the 
deprotonated acid group.  
6.4.1 N-heterocycle and benzene carboxylic acid molecular complexes 
The combination of the six-membered N-heterocycles and benzene carboxylic acid molecular 
building blocks formed 1:1 complexes in IN2,4-DNBA I, INZP and INZ2,4-DNBA and a 2:1 
complex in INP. In IN2,4-DNBA II and INZ5NIP, two independent molecular motifs are present 
and therefore these complexes can be better described as 2:2 complexes. A methanol solvate of 
IN2,4-DNBA (IN2,4-DNBA III) was also formed as a 1:2:1 complex.  
In the molecular complexes where components are present either in equivalent ratios or where the 
benzene carboxylic acid is the major component, a charge assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bond 
forms in a pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon as a result of proton transfer 
between the benzene carboxylic acid and the N-heterocycle; in IN2,4-DNBA I, II and III and INZP 
the proton is transferred to the N-heterocycle nitrogen atom whilst in INZ2,4-DNBA, the proton is 
transferred to the diazo functional group (Figure 6.13). The assisting DHO interaction in the 
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon is a weak CH   O hydrogen bond in IN2,4-DNBA I (dCO 
3.093(2) ), IN2,4-DNBA II (dCO 3.007(2) ) IN2,4-DNBA III (dCO 3.128(2) ) and INZP 
(dCO 3.110(2) ) whilst in INZ2,4-DNBA it is a moderate strength NHO hydrogen bond 
(dNO 2.777(1) ). Proton transfer to the N-heterocycle occurs in both molecular units connected 
by the pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon in IN2,4-DNBA. In IN2,4-DNBA 
III, where a second IN molecule is not present, the second 2,4-DNBA molecule hydrogen bonds to 
the methanol solvent instead of undergoing proton transfer. In INZP, only one of the phthalic acid 
protons is transferred to the isoniazid co-component, the other forms a very short intramolecular 
OHO
 hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group (dOO 2.379(1) ). These types of hydrogen 
bonds often occur between deprotonated and protonated carboxylic acid groups when in close 
proximity. 
Figure 6.13 The pyridine:carboxylic acid 
(7) hydrogen bond synthons comprised of a charge assisted N
HO
hydrogen bond and a weak DHO hydrogen bond between the N-heterocycle and the deprotonated carboxylic acid 
group in the molecular complexes: (a) IN2,4-DNBA I, (b) IN2,4-DNBA II (c) IN2,4-DNBA III, (d) INZP and (e) 
INZ2,4-DNBA. 
Differences in the hydrogen bonding to IN2,4-DNBA I to III, INZP and INZ2,4-DNBA occur in 
INP and INZ5-NIP (Figure 6.14). In INP, the phthalic acid molecular component hydrogen bonds 
through both carboxylic acid groups to two isonicotinamide molecules via their nitrogen ring 
atoms. Proton transfer, to form a charge assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bond, occurs across one 
INP hydrogen bond link only. This interaction does not form as part of a pyridine:carboxylic acid 
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon, as in IN2,4-DNBA I to III and INZP, but is a single hydrogen bond 
where the carboxylate group and pyridine ring are twisted significantly out of co-planarity (72 ). 
The hydrogen bond link formed by the second phthalic acid carboxylic acid group is an OHN 
hydrogen bond and is formed in a hydrogen bond synthon that is a variation of the 
pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon; there is no proton transfer across the  
OHN hydrogen bond and this interaction is assisted by a weak CHO hydrogen bond (dCO 
3.103(1) ). In INZ5-NIP, charge assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bonds form between each 
symmetry independent molecular pair of isoniazid and 5-nitroisophthalic acid molecules. Transfer 
of a single hydrogen atom from one carboxylic acid group occurs for each 5-nitroisophthalic acid 
molecule to the diazo functional group of the isoniazid molecules. The non-deprotonated 
carboxylic acid group in each 5-nitroisophthalic acid molecule forms a side-on interaction with a 
carboxylate group of a neighbouring acid via an OHO
 hydrogen bond (dOO 2.586(3) and 
2.609(3) ).  
Figure 6.14 (a) The hydrogen bonding links between molecular components in (a) INP and (b) INZ5-NIP. 
The distances of the charge assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bonding interactions in the  
N-heterocycle benzene carboxylic acid molecular complexes range from 2.551(1) to 2.757(3)  
(Table 6.9). The charge assisted N
HO
hydrogen bonds that are short enough to be 
considered SSHBs are formed in IN2,4-DNBA I, II and III, INP and INZ2,4-DNBA. The shortest 
SSHB is formed in INP, with a N
 distance of 2.551(1) ; this is on the limit of 2.55  where 
proton migration has previously been observed across charge assisted N
HO
 SSHBs. In INP, 
the N
H distance is elongated at 1.07(2) ; this is characteristic of an SSHB with a symmetric 
single well potential. In IN2,4-DNBA, the N
 distance of 2.555(1)  is slightly longer but 
close to the previously observed proton migration limit and the N
H distance is elongated at 
1.04(2) . Between IN2,4-DNBA II and IN2,4-DNBA III, the charge assisted N
HO
hydrogen bonding interactions have significantly different N
 distances; this may be caused 
by crystal packing effects.

6.4.2 N-heterocycle and anilic acid molecular complexes 
The combination of the N-heterocycle (N) and anilic acid (Ac) molecular components formed ten 
molecular complexes in which proton transfer between the two molecular components resulted in a 
charge assisted N
HO
hydrogen bond. 
In three of the molecular complexes, the charge assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bond forms as part 
of a N
H(O)O
 bifurcated hydrogen bond synthon occurring on one side of the anilic acid where it 
is singly deprotonated (HAc
) in the 1:1 complexes of 4-APClA and 4-APBrA and on both sides 
of the anilic acid where it is doubly deprotonated (Ac
) in the 2:1:1 complex of 1,2,4-TZClA 
hydrate. 4-APClA and 4-APBrA are isostructural, differing only in the halogen atom present. In 
their structures, two bifurcated hydrogen bond units connect via single OHO hydrogen bonds 
on the protonated side of the anilic acid molecule (dOO 4-APClA 2.671(3) , 4-APBrA 2.692(5) 
) (Figure 6.15(a) and (b)). The formation of the N
H(O)O
 bifurcated hydrogen bond synthon on 
both sides of the anilic acid in 1,2,4-TZClA hydrate results in a centrosymmetric N:Ac:N 
hydrogen bonding motif similar to that observed in other 2:1 molecular complexes of N-
heterocycles with anilic acids including 2:1 picoline-bromanilic acid 
 and 2:1 picoline-anilic 
acid molecular complexes. 
 Water molecules also hydrogen bond to either side of the 
deprotonated acid via a weak OHO hydrogen bond (dOO 3.049(3) ).

HO
 hydrogen bonds present in a N
H(O)O
 bifurcated hydrogen bond synthon in 
(a) 4-APClA, (b) 4-APBrA and (c) 1,2,4-TZClA.  
A bifurcated N
H(O)O
 hydrogen bond synthon also forms in the 1:1 molecular complexes of 
PYBrA and 4(5)-MIBrA occurring on one side of the anilic acid where it is singly deprotonated 
(Figure 6.16). A neighbouring 5-membered N-heterocycle also interacts with the deprotonated side 
of the anilic acid via an NHO
 hydrogen bond; with the presence of a second NH group in 
pyrazole and 4(5)-methylimidazole, it is less clear in these complexes whether the charge assisted 
HO
 hydrogen bond is that involved in forming the bifurcated N
H(O)O
 hydrogen bond 
synthon or the single NHO
 hydrogen bond. Two bifurcated hydrogen bond units dimerise 
over an inversion centre on the protonated side of the anilic acid via moderate strength OHO 
hydrogen bonds (dOO PYBrA 2.692(3)  and 4(5)-MIBrA 2.655(3) ) forming an N:Ac:Ac:N 
hydrogen bonded motif. This hydrogen bonded motif is commonly found in other 1:1 molecular 
complexes of the anilic acids and N-heterocycles including lutidine-bromanilic acid 
lutidine-chloranilic acid molecular complexes. 
Figure 6.16 Charge assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bonds present in N:Ac:Ac:N hydrogen bonded motifs in (a) PYBrA 
and (b) 4(5)-MIBrA.  
A 1:1 molecular complex is also formed in 3,5-DMPYClA where the anilic acid is singly 
deprotonated (HAc
) by the N-heterocycle. The charge assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bond forms 
to the deprotonated side of the anilic acid. However, unlike in 4-APClA, 4-APBrA, 1,2,4-
TRIAZClA, PYBrA and 4(5)-MIBrA, it occurs as a single interaction only and there is no 
bifurcated hydrogen bond formed to the deprotonated acid groups; this may be a result of the two 
molecules being twisted 84  out of co-planarity with one another. Two 3,5-DMPYClA units 
assemble via single OHO hydrogen bonds, as in 4-APClA and 4-APBrA, but this time formed 
between the deprotonated and protonated sides of the anilic acid (dOO 2.681(1) ) and resulting in 
a bent N:Ac:Ac:N hydrogen bonding motif (Figure 6.17).   
Figure 6.17 The charge assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bonds present in hydrogen bonding motifs of 3,5-DMPYClA. 
In four of the N-heterocycle anilic acid molecular complexes, water molecules replace the N-
heterocycle in the bifurcated hydrogen bond synthon and interact with the deprotonated anilic acid 
groups. This occurs in 3,5-DMPYBrA hydrate, 3,5-DMPYClA hydrate, 4(5)-MIClA hydrate and 
PYClA hydrate. The charge assisted N
HO
hydrogen bond forms side-on to the deprotonated 
acid and as a single interaction (Figure 6.18). In 3,5-DMPYBrA hydrate, 3,5-DMPYClA hydrate 
and 4(5)-MIClA hydrate, the anilic acid is doubly deprotonated (Ac
) and the N-heterocycle and 
water molecules are in excess of the anilic acid. This generates a five membered hydrogen bonded 
motif which has inversion symmetry; the anilic acid occupies a special position of an inversion 
centre. 3,5-DMPYBrA hydrate and 3,5-DMPYClA hydrate are isostructural, differing only in the 
halogen atom present. The water:acid:water (W:Ac:W) hydrogen bonded unit is not unusual for 
hydrates of N-heterocycle haloanilic acid molecular complexes, also being observed in structures 
with CSD refcodes ABUHOU, 
 BARLOW, 
 GOMBEP 
 and NEQWEM 
 among others. A 
different hydrogen bonding motif forms in PYClA hydrate in the presence of water, where the N-
heterocycle and anilic acid components are present in equivalent ratios (1:1) and where the anilic 
acid is singly deprotonated. Water forms an OH(O)O
 bifurcated hydrogen bond to one side of the 
anilic acid only. Two of these units assemble on the protonated side of the anilic acid via a single 
moderate strength OHO hydrogen bond ((Figure 6.18(d)). In the molecular complex of  
4(5)-MIClA hydrate, a neutral chloranilic acid molecule (H2Ac) is also present alongside the Ac
This species does not interact via NHO hydrogen bonds with the N-heterocycle.

 hydrogen bonds in hydrogen bonded motifs in (a) 3,5-DMPYBrA hydrate,

The charge assisted N
HO
 and NHO
 hydrogen bonds formed in the seven N-heterocycle 
anilic acid molecular complexes have NO distances in the range of 2.598(3) to 2.939(2)  (Table 
6.10). The N
HO
 charge assisted hydrogen bonds in PYBrA, PYClA hydrate and  
3,5-DMPYClA hydrate are at the limit of the N
HO
 SSHBs whilst none are below the 
previously proposed limit for proton migration to occur. In general, shorter hydrogen bonding 
interactions were formed where not part of a bifurcated synthon.

6.5 SSHB formation in the molecular complexes 
This study has investigated the combination of a range of molecular building blocks in the design 
of SSHBs for potential proton migration studies. In total, forty-four molecular complexes were 
synthesised, twenty-seven with OHO hydrogen bonds in the range of 2.41 to 2.66  and 
seventeen with charge assisted N
HO
 in the range of 2.55 to 2.97 . Of the twenty-seven 
with OHO hydrogen bonds, nineteen can be considered SSHBs, with donor-acceptor distances 
less than 2.6 , whilst only five have donor-acceptor distances that are on or below the previously 
proposed limit of 2.45  for proton migration to occur. Of the seventeen molecular complexes 
with charge assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bonds, eight can be considered SSHBs, with donor-
acceptor distances less than 2.6 , whilst only two have donor-acceptor distances that are on or 
below the previously proposed limit of 2.55 .  
The seven molecular complexes with OHO and N
HO
 SSHBs below or near the 
respective proposed limits for proton migration are potential proton migration materials and 
include DMU2,4-DNBA (dOO 2.446(1) ), DMUP (dOO 2.452(1) ), 3-DAZA2,4-DNBA (dOO 
2.449(1) ), DMU5-NIP (dOO 2.434(2) ), 3-DAZABrA hydrate (dOO 2.411(2) ; a very short 
hydrogen bonding interaction), INP (dNO 2.551(1) ) and IN2,4-DNBA II (dNO 2.555(1) ). The 
potential for proton migration across SSHBs is further suggested in DMU2,4-DNBA,  
3-DAZABrA hydrate, INP and IN2,4-DNBA where the DH distance is elongated in the SSHB 
in the low temperature structures (100 or 150 K); this is characteristic of an SSHB with a 
symmetric single well potential and favours proton migration. These OO SSHB distances in the 
molecular complexes of DMU2,4-DNBA, 3-DAZABrA hydrate are comparable to those 
previously reported for proton migration materials including urea phosphoric acid (dOO 
2.411(2) ), 
 N,N,-dimethylurea oxalic acid (dOO 2.4469(9) ) 
 and N,N-dimethylurea 
oxalic acid (dOO 2.4398(15) and 2.4423(15) ). 
 The NO SSHB distances of INP and IN2,4-
DNBA are slightly longer than those previously reported for the proton migration materials 
isoniazid 4-aminosalicylic acid (dNO 2.548(2) ), 
 pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid (dNO 
2.523(2) ) 
 and 4,4-bipyridine benzene-1,2,4,5-tetra carboxylic acid (dNO 2.5220(17) ). 
A number of design strategies were trialled in this work to target the formation of SSHBs in the 
molecular complexes. The effect of these on SSHB formation is explored.   
6.5.1 Molecular component selection and hydrogen bonding motif effects on SSHB 
formation 
In this study, the success of the combination of different molecular components via different 
hydrogen bonded molecular motifs in accessing SSHBs is of interest. 
The selection of substituted ureas and benzene carboxylic acid molecular components and of  
3-deazauracil and organic acid molecular components proved to be a good strategy for obtaining 
OHO SSHBs, with SSHBs formed in nineteen out of the twenty seven molecular complexes 
prepared; in several cases the donor-acceptor distances are below the previously proposed proton 
migration limits. In general, there was a greater predictability in the motifs formed on combination 
of the organic acids with the substituted urea molecular components than with the 3-deazauracil 
molecular components; the substituted ureas repeatedly formed a carboxylic acid:amide 2
hydrogen bond synthon whilst there was more variation in the hydrogen bond motifs formed in the 
3-deazauracil molecular complexes. The 3-deazauracil basic component was also particularly 
difficult to co-crystallise with the organic acids; only four such complexes formed compared to 
twenty-three from the combination of substituted ureas with benzene carboxylic acids. As found 
by Alhalaweh et al. (2010), 
 there was some relationship between ratio of molecular components 
in the substituted urea benzene carboxylic acid complexes and the type of hydrogen bonding motif 
formed. The U:Ac hydrogen bond motif was formed in the 1:1 and 2:2 substituted urea benzene 
carboxylic acid molecular complexes whilst the U:Ac:U motif formed in the 2:1 substituted urea 
benzene carboxylic acid molecular complexes. Exceptions to this include the 2:1 complex of 
MU5-NIP, in which only a U:Ac motif formed, and the 2:2 complexes of UIP and MU5-AIP, in 
which a number of motifs formed including a Ac:U:Ac and a U:Ac:U hydrogen bonded motif. In 
all the 2:2 molecular complexes, a single U:Ac hydrogen bond motif was formed alongside a 
single OHO hydrogen bond involving the second carboxylic acid group. In general, in these 
complexes, the shorter OHO hydrogen bonds were formed in the U:Ac motif. This may be 
related to cooperative hydrogen bonding effects (resonance assisted HBs) occurring causing a 
strengthening of interactions in the U:Ac synthon. 
 This indicates that a strategy of targeting the 
carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthon can allow shorter SSHBs to be accessed than 
for the single interactions. In the four 3-deazauracil organic acid molecular complexes synthesised, 
all showed a preference for the formation of a single OHO hydrogen bond whilst in one 
complex, 3-DAZA2,4-DNBA, a carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthon was also 
formed. Unlike for the substituted urea benzene carboxylic acid molecular complexes, the single 
OHO hydrogen bonds were generally shorter than those in the carboxylic acid:amide 2
hydrogen bond synthon. This indicates that this carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond 
synthon is not favoured for the formation of shorter SSHB in all cases.  
In forming the N
HO
 charge assisted hydrogen bonds, the N-heterocycles with the benzene 
carboxylic acids, rather than the anilic acids, proved to be more successful in synthesising 
molecular complexes containing SSHBs; five out of seven formed SSHBs with the benzene 
carboxylic acids whilst for the anilic acids no donor-acceptor distances were significantly lower 
than the 2.6  donor-acceptor distance limit. The lack of very short N
HO
 charge assisted 
hydrogen bonds in the N-heterocycle anilic acid molecular complexes may be a result of bifurcated 
hydrogen bonds being commonly formed on proton transfer. Three-centre hydrogen bonds in a 
bifurcated motif are generally weaker than two-centre single hydrogen bonding interactions. 
The geometry of the acid groups in the anilic acids favours the formation of bifurcated hydrogen 
bonds on deprotonation; the bifurcated motif is common in molecular complexes of N-
heterocycles and haloanilic acids. 
31, 138, 139, 274
 Single N
HO
 charge assisted hydrogen bonds 
were formed in some molecular complexes; in general these were shorter than those in the 
bifurcated motif. This indicates that, in future studies engineering SSHB, targeting bifurcated 
interactions is a less good strategy to implement for anilic acids. The combination of the N-
heterocycles and anilic acids did, however, reveal information about the predictability of the 
design of different bifurcated motifs. In the 1:1 N-heterocycle anilic acid molecular complexes, the 
anilic acid was singly deprotonated and formed a bifurcated hydrogen bond with a hydrogen bond 
donor (N
H or OHwater) on the deprotonated side. Two of these bifurcated motifs then 
consistently interacted on the non-protonated side via single or dimer OHO hydrogen bonds; 
an exception to this was 3,5-DMPYClA where bulky methyl groups were adjacent to the N
groups possibly preventing bifurcation. In the 2:1 N-heterocycle anilic acid molecular complexes, 
the anilic acid was doubly deprotonated and formed a bifurcated hydrogen bond with a hydrogen 
bond donor (N
H or OHwater) on both sides of the acid. There was also some predictability in 
the hydrogen bonded motifs formed by the bromo and chloro analogues; several of the bromo and 
chloro molecular complexes were isostructural including 4-APBrA with 4-APClA, and 3,5-
DMPYBrA hydrate with 3,5-DMPYClA hydrate.  
In the molecular complexes of the N-heterocycles with benzene carboxylic acids, N
HO
charge assisted hydrogen bonds in a pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon were 
favoured. This synthon has been commonly reported in pyridine carboxylic acid molecular 
complexes. 
273, 279
 In INP, one of the N
HO
 CAHBs formed singly and not as part of a 
pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon; this interaction was the shortest of those 
formed, at 2.551(1) . This may indicate that the formation of a N
HO
 CAHB not in a 
pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon leads to shorter SSHBs. This was explored 
in several examples in the literature. In isonicotinamide 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid, 
 the N
HO
CAHB was shorter (dN+O-2.538(2) ) when formed singly in the 1:1 molecular complex than 
when formed as part of a pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon in the 2:1 
complex (dN+O- 2.564(2) ). In the crystal structure of 4,4-bipyridine benzene-1,2,4,5-
tetracarboxylic acid, a N
HO
 CAHB in the pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond 
synthon was longer (dN+O-
2.617(5)
) than when formed singly (dN+O-
2.551(5)
 It may be 
that preventing the formation of the N
HO
 CAHBs in the pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
hydrogen bond synthon is advantageous for accessing the shorter interactions. The shorter nature 
of the N
HO
 CAHB when not formed in a pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond 
synthon may be due to the closer molecular approach allowed in contrast to when the 
pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon is formed; in order for the weak DHO 
to form alongside the N
HO
 CAHB in the synthon, molecular approach between the 
carboxylate and the protonated N-heterocycle may be more restricted.  
6.5.2 Effects of acidity and basicity of molecular components on SSHB formation 
The effect of the acidity and basicity of molecular components, indicated by pKa values (1.3), on 
SSHB formation is also of interest in this work; the pKa values of two components interacting via 
a hydrogen bond, and their differences (pKa) may affect the proton transfer properties across the 
hydrogen bond and the hydrogen bond strength.  
The molecular complexes described in this chapter cover a pKa range of 4 to 6.5 (Table 6.11). 
The proton transfer behaviour observed is, in most cases, in agreement with the pKa values 
between the two components; all those with pKa < 0 form a co-crystal, except for DMU2,4-
DNBA and DMU5-AIP which form salts, and all those with pKa > 3 form salts. A large number 
of the N
HO
 molecular complexes are in the 0 to 3 pKa range where the outcome is less 
predictable; the majority form salts except for 3-DAZABrA hydrate, which forms an intermediate 
between a salt and a co-crystal where the proton is symmetrically located in the SSHB. In INP and 
IN2,4-DNBA III, two molecular pairs of the basic and acid components are present; in one pair 
proton transfer occurs across the SSHB whilst it does not in the other and a mixed ionisation state 
molecular complex is formed. Similarly, in 4(5)-MIClA hydrate, a singly deprotonated and neutral 
acid are both present whilst the 4(5)-methylimidazole is always protonated. 4(5)-MIClA hydrate 
has a pKa value of 6.3 and so salt formation would be most likely; however, the stoichiometry is 
not 1:1 resulting in the coexistence of deprotonated and neutral ClA molecules.  
The shortest of the SSHBs are formed in the molecular complexes where there is some degree of 
proton transfer occurring. For example, the OHO SSHBS in the molecular complexes 
DMU2,4-DNBA and 3-DAZABrA hydrate are two of the shortest formed; a CAHB is formed in 
DMU2,4-DNBA whilst in 3-DAZABrA hydrate the proton is partially transferred across the 
hydrogen bond, occupying a central position. For the N-heterocycle organic acid molecular 
complexes of INP and IN2,4-DNBA III, two molecular pairs of the IN and acid components are 
present, connecting via charge assisted and neutral hydrogen bonds between the same functional 
groups; the charge assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bonds are significantly shorter than the neutral 
OHN hydrogen bonds where proton transfer had not occurred. In future design strategies for 
SSHB, the selection of components with pKa > 3, where proton transfer is increasingly likely as 
occurring in the majority of cases in the complexes in this chapter, may be advantageous to form 
the shorter of the SSHBs.

Potential correlation of the values of pKa for each molecular complex with the donor-acceptor 
distances of the hydrogen bond formed between the basic and acidic molecular components can 
also be examined (Figure 6.19). A correlation between pKa and SSHB length has previously been 
made, indicating that the strongest and shortest of hydrogen bonds between two components may 
be formed when pKa approaches zero. 
117, 269
 pKa values may therefore be a potential tool for 
tuning hydrogen bond strength.

 See A6.3 for the 
values of pKa of molecular complexes taken from the literature. The standard uncertainties on the SSHB distances are 
plotted but are smaller than the symbols used to denote each data point. 
In the molecular complexes in this chapter, a correlation between pKa values and SSHB length is 
not clear, with the data points being scattered. Some of the shorter OHO and N
HO
hydrogen bonds are formed between components with more similar proton affinities (pKa  0) 
however, as are some of the longer interactions. The hydrogen bonds with donor-acceptor 
distances less than the previously proposed proton migration limits (2.45  for OHO and 2.55 
 for N
HO
) were formed for OHO hydrogen bonds in the 0 to -2.5 range and for N
HO
 hydrogen bonds in the 0 to +2.5 range. Longer hydrogen bond lengths were however also 
formed in these regions. It could be that by selecting molecular components with pKa values 
approaching zero it may be possible to access the shorter interactions however this it is not 
guaranteed. This lack of firm correlation between pKa and SSHB distances emphasises the 
difficulties in transferring pKa values, determined under solution equilibrium conditions, to the 
solid state. 
Determining the effect of changes in basicity or acidity of molecular components on SSHB 
formation by substitution, instead of using the pKa values, may be a more reliable way to tune 
SSHB strength. For the OHO substituted urea benzene carboxylic acid molecular complexes, 
the shortest of the interactions were formed more consistently where the urea was increasingly 
substituted with methyl groups, in the N,N-dimethylurea molecular complexes. For example, the 
combination of substituted ureas with isophthalic acid leads to the shortest distance forming in 
combination with the most substituted urea (DMUIP dOO 2.508(1) , MUIP dOO 2.594(2)  and 
UIP dOO 2.622(2) ). This has also been seen previously in substituted urea oxalic acid molecular 
complexes where the OHO interaction distance shortened with increasing substitution of the 
urea. 
109, 115, 293, 294
 The shortening of the SSHB was attributed to the enhanced basicity of the urea 
when increasingly substituted with electron donating methyl groups. Ureas that are increasingly 
substituted with electron donating substituents therefore appear favourable for accessing the 
shortest of the OHO SSHBs in substituted urea benzene carboxylic acid molecular complexes.  
For the molecular complexes of the benzene carboxylic acids with both set 1 and set 2 basic 
components, the SSHB length appears to be tuneable by substitution of the acid. In general, 
SSHBs with shorter donor-acceptor distances are found to be formed where the acids were 
substituted with electron withdrawing groups, in particular the shortest formed on nitro 
substitution, leading to enhanced acidity. For example, the OHO SSHBs OO distances in 
UIP, MUIP and DMUIP are longer (dOO UIP 2.622(2) to 2.626(2) , MUIP dOO 2.594(2)  and 
DMUIP dOO 2.508(1) ), than in their respective nitro substituted molecular complexes of  
U5-NIP, MU5-NIP and DMU5-NIP (dOO U5-NIP 2.470(1) , MUIP dOO 2.490(1)  and 
DMUIP dOO 2.434(2) to 2.482(2) ). For the molecular complexes of the haloanilic acids with 
the set 2 basic components, the SSHB length also appear to be tuneable by acid substitution with 
increasingly electronegative substituent, again leading to enhanced acidity; in general shorter 
charge assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bonds form in the bromo substituted molecular complexes 
than the chloro substituted such as when in complex with 4-acetylpyridine (4-APBrA dN+O- 
2.658(5) to 2.793(5)  and 4-APClA 2.674(3) to 2.793(3) ) and with 3,5-dimethylpyrazole (3,5-
DMPYBrA hydrate dN+O- 2.621(1)  and 3,5-DMPYClA hydrate 2.700(1) ). The shortest of the 
SSHBs formed between substituted urea or N-heterocycle basic components may therefore be 
accessible where organic acids are substituted with increasingly electron withdrawing species.  
The ortho substitution of the benzene carboxylic acids also leads to shorter donor-acceptor 
distances. This might be expected where ortho substituted benzoic acids are more acidic and better 
hydrogen bond donors than those that are meta or para substituted; attributed to the steric 
hinderance which forces the carboxylic acid group to twist out of co-planarity with the benzene 
ring. 
 This prevents conjugative electron donation of the acid group with the benzene ring and 
increases acidity; conjugation with the benzene ring destabilises the conjugate base thereby 
reducing acidity. For example, shorter OHO SSHBs are formed in DMUP (dOO 2.452(2) and 
2.452(2) ) than in DMUIP (dOO 2.508(2) ) and in MUP (dOO 2.558(1) to 2.591(2) ) than in 
MUIP (dOO 2.594(2) to 2.674(2) ). Targeting ortho substituted organic acids therefore appears 
favourable for accessing the shortest of the OHO SSHBs in substituted urea benzene 
carboxylic acid molecular complexes. 
6.5.3 Crystal packing effects on SSHB formation 
In some of the molecular complexes, SSHBs are formed in identical hydrogen bonding motifs 
between the same molecular components with varying donor-acceptor distances. In these 
instances, the SSHBs are free from electronic effects and so the variations must be a result of 
changes to the crystal packing. The differences in SSHB distances are rationalised in the crystal 
packing in molecular complexes of IN2,4-DNBA I to III and in DMU3-CBA in which identical 
hydrogen bonding motifs are formed for each complex with the same pKa values but where there 
is variation in the SSHB distances.  
IN2,4-DNBA I to III 
Across the three IN2,4-DNBA I, II and III molecular complexes, the charge assisted N
HO
hydrogen bonds vary in length in the same pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond synthons 
between the same pair of IN and 2,4-DNBA molecules (IN2,4-DNBA I dN+O- 2.596(2) , IN2,4-
DNBA II SSHB1 dN+O- 2.555(1)  and SSHB2 2.636(1)  and IN2,4-DNBA III  
 dN+O- 2.599(2) ). The crystal packing of the local environment of the pyridine:carboxylic acid 
2(7) hydrogen bond synthons varies (Figure 6.20).  
Figure 6.20 The crystal packing of the pyridine:carboxylic 
(7) hydrogen bond synthons (circled) in the molecular 
complexes (a) IN2,4-DNBA I, (b) IN2,4-DNBA  II and (c) IN2,4-DNBA III.  
Variations in the crystal packing of each SSHB includes the side of the IN to which the 
pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon forms. This occurs on the amine side of the 
IN molecule in IN2,4-DNBA II and IN2,4-DNBA III whilst it occurs on the carbonyl side in 
IN2,4-DNBA I. The orientation of the 2,4-DNBA molecule forming the pyridine:carboxylic acid 
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon form also varies, indicated by the location of the nitro group at the 
2-position relative to the IN amide group (Figure 6.21). For one orientation of 2,4-DNBA, the 
nitro group at the 2-position is pointing in a similar direction to the IN amide carbonyl; the charge 
assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bonds are shorter in this case including in IN2,4-DNBA I, IN2,4-
DNBA II (SSHB1) and IN2,4-DNBA III. For the second orientation of 2,4-DNBA, the nitro group 
at the 2-position is pointing in a similar direction to the IN amide amine group; in this instance the 
charge assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bond is longer, occurring in IN2,4-DNBA II (SSHB2).  
Figure 6.21 The orientation of the 2,4-DNBA 2-position nitro group relative to the IN carbonyl in the IN2,4-DNBA 
molecular complexes: (a) the nitro and carbonyl groups are oriented towards the same side and (b) the nitro and carbonyl 
groups are oriented to opposite sides. 
The interactions of the nitro group at the 2-position on the 2,4-DNBA with the carboxylate group 
in the pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon also varies across the different forms 
where the SSHB distances vary. In IN2,4-DNBA I and IN2,4-DNBA II (SSHB2), the nitro 
interaction with the carboxylate group involves the oxygen forming the weak CHO interaction 
(dOO 2.849(2) and 2.972(2) , respectively) whilst in IN2,4-DNBA II (SSHB1) and in IN2,4-
DNBA III they involve the oxygen forming the charge assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bond (dOO 
2.937(2) and 2.924(2) , respectively). Weak interactions in the local environment of the charge 
assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bond also vary as the SSHB donor-acceptor distance varies. In 
IN2,4-DNBA I there are none formed directly to the SSHB, -contacts form to the carboxylate end 
of the SSHB in IN2,4-DNBA II SSHB1 (including d 2.943(1) to 3.180(1) ) and IN2,4-DNBA 
III (d 2.753(2) to 3.170(2) ) whilst -contacts (d 2.756(2) to 3.061(2) ) and a weak  
CHO hydrogen bond (dCO 3.409(2) ) form to the carboxylate end in IN2,4-DNBA II 
SSHB2. There does not appear to be any obvious correlation of these interactions with SSHB 
length. 
In the crystal packing of each IN2,4-DNBA molecular complex there are also molecular structural 
variations. The angle between the planes of 2,4-DNBA carboxylate group and pyridine ring 
forming the pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon and the torsion angles of the 
nitro groups of 2,4-DNBA molecules vary; there does not appear to be any correlation in these 
variations with SSHB length (Table 6.12).

The pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon connects to the next via an 
amide:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthon. The NHO hydrogen bond distances in the 
amide:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthon are shorter where the charge assisted N
HO
hydrogen bonds in the pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon are shorter and vice 
versa (Table 6.13). Here there appears to be some correlation evident between the crystal packing 
and the SSHB distances.

In summary, across the three molecular complexes of IN2,4-DNBA, variations in the donor-
acceptor distances of the charge assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bonds may be rationalised by 
variations in the crystal packing and in some cases it is possible to correlate the two effects.  
DMU3-CBA 
In the crystal structure of DMU3-CBA, two symmetry-independent units containing identical 
hydrogen bonded U:Ac motifs between the same two components are present. In each of the U:Ac 
motifs, the OHO SSHB donor-acceptor distance varies (U:Ac1 SSHB dOO 2.472(2)  and 
U:Ac2 SSHB dOO 2.481(2) ). The differences in lengths occur alongside interesting variations 
in crystal packing (Figure 6.22).  
Figure 6.22 The crystal packing of the U:Ac motifs in DMU3-CBA (a) in U:Ac1 (dOO 2.472(2) ) and  
 (b) U:Ac2 (dOO 2.481(2) ). The weak interactions formed to the U:Ac 
() hydrogen bond synthon are circled in 
orange whilst those formed between the rest of the 3-CBA molecule and the local environment are circle in purple.  
Variations in the crystal packing to the carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthon occur 
between U:Ac1 and U:Ac2. Weak CHO hydrogen bonds form to either end of the OHO 
SSHB in both the U:Ac1 and U:A2 motifs with differing interaction strengths (U:Ac1 dCOacid  
3.493(3)  and dCOurea   3.552(3)  and U:Ac2 dCOacid  3.478(3)  and dCOurea  3.569(3) ). The 
shorter OHO SSHB in U:Ac1 occurs where the weak CHO hydrogen bond to the acid end 
of the SSHB is shorter and the weak CHO hydrogen bond to the urea end is longer. In the 
crystal packing, a weak CHO hydrogen bond also forms to the 3-CBA carbonyl group of each 
U:Ac motif. The interactions are of different lengths (U:Ac1 dCO 3.275(2)  and U:Ac2 dCO 
3.464(3) ) and the nature of the CH forming the interaction also differs between the two 
motifs; in U:Ac1 the CH is ortho to a cyano group and donated by a symmetry independent  
3-CBA molecule whilst in U:Ac2, the CH is para to a cyano group and is from a symmetry 
equivalent 3-CBA molecule. The CH bond which is ortho to a cyano group in U:Ac1 is 
increasingly polarised, resulting in a shorter interaction distance than formed to U:Ac2 which 
experiences less polarisation in the para position.  
The 3-CBA molecule also forms a different weak interaction with the surrounding environment via 
the CH group at the 4-position to the carboxylic acid group. In U:Ac1, the CH group forms a 
weak CHN hydrogen bond with a neighbouring nitrile group (dCN 3.558(3) ) whilst in 
U:Ac2, the CH groups forms a weak CHO bond to a neighbouring carboxylic acid group 
(dCO 3.275(2) ). The interaction distances of the nitrile groups with a neighbouring amine in 
each U:Ac motif differs (U:Ac1 dNN 3.103(3) ) and U:Ac2 dNN 3.146(3) ). In general, where 
the weaker interactions involving the rest of the 3-CBA molecule in each U:Ac motif and the local 
environment are shorter, as in U:Ac1, the OHO SSHB is shorter. Between the two U:Ac 
motifs, there are variations in the crystal packing alongside variations in the length of the  
OHO SSHB and in some cases the two are effects may be correlated.  
In summary, between the two U:Ac motifs in DMU3-CBA, variations in the donor-acceptor 
distances of the charge assisted OHO hydrogen bonds may be rationalised by variations in the 
crystal packing.  
6.6 Conclusions 
In this chapter, the design of organic molecular complexes containing OHO and N
HO
SSHBs for potential proton migration studies has been attempted.  
Forty-four molecular complexes were synthesised from the combination of the benzene carboxylic 
acids with the set 1 basic components for the formation of OHO SSHBs and from the 
combination of organic acids with the set 2 basic components for the formation of charge assisted 
HO
 SSHBs. From these forty-four molecular complexes, SSHBs were formed in twenty-
seven whilst six of these had SSHBs with donor-acceptor distances below or near the proposed 
limits for proton migration; complexes DMU2,4-DNBA DMUP, 3-DAZA2,4-DNBA, DMU5-NIP 
and 3-DAZABrA hydrate, INP and IN2,4-DNBA II are thus recommended for variable 
temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction proton migration studies. The strategies implemented in 
the design of SSHBs in this research project can therefore be considered relatively successful, 
where a large number have formed in the engineered molecular complexes. Only a small number 
of these are near the proposed limits for proton migration indicating that the design of SSHBs with 
potential proton migration behaviour remains a challenge and further development of crystal 
engineering strategies are required.  
Despite the relative lack of success in accessing potential proton migration materials, the crystal 
engineering studies aid in identifying where they might be targeted in the future as well as 
revealing insight into molecular aggregation. In terms of component selection, the combination of 
substituted ureas and benzene carboxylic acids is recommended giving a greater predictability for 
OHO SSHB formation than the combination of 3-deazuracil with the organic acids, where the 
carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) synthon was found to be robust in governing molecular assembly and 
successful in the design of SSHBs. The combination of six-membered N-heterocycles with 
benzene carboxylic acids was the better approach for accessing charge assisted N
HO
SSHBs, frequently formed in a pyridine:carboxylic acid 2
2(7) hydrogen bond synthon, compared 
with the combination of N-heterocycles with the haloanilic acids. In the latter a bifurcated 
hydrogen bonding motif persisted within which the N
HO
 SSHBs were generally weaker; 
this was a consequence of the arrangement of the acid groups and indicates molecular geometry is 
an important consideration in these studies. Relatively few investigations of the six-membered N-
heterocycles with benzene carboxylic acids were carried out and so more crystallisation trials are 
recommended; in particular the isonicotinamide co-former appears to be a good target for the 
formation of the shorter N
HO
 SSHBs.  
In terms of the acidity and basicity of molecular components, there did not appear to be a strong 
correlation between pKa and SSHB donor-acceptor distances; in some cases the shortest SSHBs 
were formed where pKa approached zero, as observed in the literature, however a range of SSHB 
distances were also formed for a single pKa value. This emphasises the problems of transferring 
pKa values, determined under solution conditions, to the solid state and indicates their better use as 
a guide in these studies. The values of pKa may be useful in future strategies where there was 
mostly agreement with the predicted salt/co-crystal outcome and where the shortest of the 
hydrogen bonds were formed where an extent of proton transfer had occurred such as in DMU2,4-
DNBA and 3-DAZABrA hydrate. Targeting charge transfer species is therefore a recommended 
strategy to implement in the design of SSHBs and can be achieved by targeting certain pKa 
values where salt formation is expected. In the complexes studied here, in preference to using 
pKa values, the consideration of the acidity or basicity of molecular components in terms of 
substituents proved to be more reliable way to access SSHBs. Certain substituents were favourable 
for SSHB formation; shorter OHO hydrogen bonds were formed where the ureas were 
increasingly substituted with electron donating groups, and more basic, whilst electron 
withdrawing substituents and substituents ortho to a carboxylic acid group, increasing acidity, in 
the benzene carboxylic acids led to shorter OHO and N
HO
 hydrogen bonds being 
formed. The targeting of these types of co-formers is recommended in future SSHB design 
strategies.  
Predictability in the resulting hydrogen bonding motifs formed was revealed between particular 
molecular components which, in some cases, were also relatable to molecular stoichiometry or 
protonation state. This was seen in the substituted urea organic acid molecular complexes, forming 
U:Ac, U:Ac:U and Ac:U:Ac motifs related to molecular stoichiometry, and in the N-heterocycle 
anilic acid molecular complexes, forming N:Ac:Ac:N and N:Ac:N or W:Ac:W motifs related to 
protonation state. This reoccurrence of motifs aids in the determining the likely aggregation of 
molecular components in future molecular complexes as well as the robust nature of certain 
hydrogen bonding synthons in the solid state.  
By exploring the situation in which the SSHBs were present, crystal packing was also shown to 
tune the nature of SSHBs; this was observed from the study of DMU3-CBA and the different 
forms of IN2,4-DNBA (I to III) where molecular orientation and weak intermolecular interactions 
appeared to influence SSHB donor-acceptor distances.   
This study into the design of SSHBs for potential proton migration studies reveals insight into 
crystal engineering strategies to favour their formation as well as the different variables that may 
tune the SSHB strength in the solid state. These observations are important as they aid in accessing 
SSHBs more predictably in the future such that the studies of proton migration in the solid state 
may be added to, allowing the understanding of the manifestation of these properties in the solid 
state.  
Chapter 7.  
X-ray diffraction and synchrotron studies of proton 
migration across short strong hydrogen bonds (SSHBs) 
Chapter 7 investigates the proton transfer process of proton migration across SSHBs, and its 
manifestation in the solid state, using a combination of variable temperature laboratory and 
synchrotron X-ray diffraction data and analysed by a combination of refinement techniques. 
7.1 Introduction and aims 
There are relatively few examples of temperature dependent proton migration (1.3.2) across 
SSHBs reported in the literature and, where its study may reveal information about hydrogen 
bonding and proton transfer behaviour, it is beneficial to identify further systems. The 
manifestation of proton migration is, however, difficult to predict in materials. Certain 
combinations of molecular building blocks have repeatedly led to the formation of proton 
migration materials including the combination of substituted ureas and organic acids 
108, 109
 or the 
combination of six membered N-heterocycles with organic acids. 
 Proton migration has also 
only been observed across SSHBs with certain donor-acceptor distances; for OHO SSHBs 
where the OO distance is less than 2.45  
108, 109
 and for N
HO
 SSHBs, where the NO 
distance is less than 2.55 . 
110-112, 267, 296
 The extent of proton migration across an SSHB has also 
been rationalised on considering the pKa values of components forming the SSHB 
 or the 
crystal packing. 
112, 297
 Temperature dependent proton migration has been followed previously 
using single crystal X-ray laboratory and neutron diffraction methods; single crystal neutron 
diffraction remains the method of choice due to the possibility for accurate location of the 
hydrogen atom. There has, as yet, been no investigation into using X-rays from synchrotron 
sources in the study of proton migration.  
In this chapter, temperature dependent proton migration is studied in the molecular complexes 
engineered in Chapter 6, where possible, by variable temperature X-ray diffraction methods with 
the aim of aiding the understanding of this process in the solid state. The technique of synchrotron 
X-ray diffraction is trialled in the study of proton migration in the most promising of these 
potential proton migration materials with the aim of investigating this technique in observing the 
finer points of the proton transfer process.  
In the study of the temperature dependent proton migration using the synchrotron technique, two 
refinement methods are used. These include the traditional method of stepwise refinement in 
SHELXL, 
 for individual temperature steps (7.3). A parametric structure refinement method 
(2.4.4) in Topas-Academic V5 
 is also trialled to probe evolving hydrogen atom positions as a 
function of temperature (7.4). This method allows the evolving position of the migrating 
hydrogen atom to be refined as a function of temperature simultaneously over a range of data sets. 
This refinement method offers the potential for enhanced accuracy of parameters compared to 
individual structure refinement for each data set, while also saving time where large numbers of 
data sets are collected over a given temperature range. This approach has been implemented 
previously for variable temperature powder data and allowed quality structural information on the 
evolving hydrogen atom positions to be obtained. 
 As yet, no equivalent study has been carried 
out using variable temperature single crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction data.  
Two data collection approaches are also implemented related to the temperature ramping including 
(i) collecting data at each temperature with stepwise temperature ramping (STEP) and (ii) 
collecting data with a continuous ramping of temperature (CONT.). The continuous ramping 
method allows evolving hydrogen atom position information to be accessed along the temperature 
profile and is made possible by the use of the synchrotron X-ray source.

7.3 Identifying temperature dependent proton migration across SSHBs 
using synchrotron and X-ray diffraction and refinement in SHELX 
The temperature dependent proton migration properties of the molecular complexes identified in 
Chapter 6, where possible, were investigated using variable temperature single crystal X-ray 
diffraction. Variable temperature measurements were carried out first in the laboratory, generally 
involving two data collections performed at 100 or 150 K for the low temperature determination 
and 300 K for the higher. Where the results from these initial studies were promising, variable 
temperature measurements were also carried out at a synchrotron source over a 100 to 350 K 
temperature range. Temperature dependent proton migration across SSHBs was suggested in just 
two of the twenty-five molecular complexes investigated; those of DMU2,4-DNBA and INP.  
7.3.1 Variable temperature synchrotron studies of proton migration 
Variable temperature study of DMU2,4-DNBA (1:1) 
HO
 SSHB with an OO distance of 2.441(1) , at 100 K, is formed between the acid 
and urea components in the molecular complex of DMU2,4-DNBA. The 2,4-DNBA acidic proton 
resides on the DMU molecule at 100 K; the molecular complex DMU2,4-DNBA is therefore a salt 
at this temperature. This SSHB length is less than the previously proposed 2.45  limit, above 
which proton migration across OHO SSHBs is not expected to occur. Variable temperature 
measurements were carried out on this material at the Advanced Light Source, U.S.A. 
 between 
100 and 350 K, in 50 K temperature steps.  
The O
HO
 SSHB hydrogen bond parameters were followed with temperature using 
refinement model 1, where the position and isotropic thermal parameter of the SSHB hydrogen 
atom were refined freely (Table 7.8 and Figure 7.1). At 100 K, the refined hydrogen atom position 
suggests that the proton resides on the urea with an elongated OH distance of 1.09(2)  and a 
HO distance of 1.37(2) . As the temperature is increased, between 100 and 200 K, the refined 
hydrogen atom position shifts slightly closer to the urea oxygen atom, shown by a decrease in the 
OH distance to 1.06(2)  at 200 K but is within the error limits for the determination and not 
significant. Between 200 and 350 K, the proton shifts significantly towards the centre of the  
HO
hydrogen bond by approximately 0.12 . A second refinement model (model 2), 
employing a fixed thermal parameter for the SSHB hydrogen atom, was also refined at each 
temperature (A7.2, Table A7.1 and Figure A7.1). Although there are larger errors on the OH 
and HO distances when employing this model, the same trend of proton migration was 
suggested, of the order of 0.1 . The consistent trends of the SSHB proton migrating towards the 
centre of the hydrogen bond as a function of temperature, indicated in the OH and HO bond 
lengths in both refinement models, is promising for the presence of temperature dependent proton 
migration in this molecular complex.  
There is a small variation in the SSHB donor-acceptor distance (dOO) as a function of 
temperature. This occurs between 100 and 200 K where the OH and HO distances are within 
the error limits for the determination. However, where the most significant change in the OH 
and HO distances has occurred, between 200 and 350 K, the length of the SSHB is invariant. 
This is supportive of proton migration being the cause for the lengthening of the OH distance as 
a function of temperature and not occurring as a consequence of an expanding hydrogen bond, 
caused by lattice expansion as a function of temperature.

Figure 7.1 The OH and HO distances in DMU2,4-DNBA over the 100 to 350 K temperature range for refinement 
model 1. 
Reasonable quality variable temperature Fourier difference maps of the O
HO
SSHB were 
generated from the data, in which it was possible to elucidate changes in the hydrogen atom 
density as a function of temperature (Figure 7.2). A shift in position of the hydrogen atom density 
occurs towards the centre of the O
HO
SSHB, as a function of temperature. These 
observations support the proton migration indicated by the OH and HO distances as a function 
of temperature. It should be noted, however, that the refined hydrogen atom position does not 
coincide with the peak maxima at most temperatures; a shift in the refined position occurs relative 
to the peak maxima which is consistent across the maps. Between 100 and 250 K, the hydrogen 
atom density is elongated along the hydrogen bond, towards the deprotonated 2,4-DNBA. This 
behaviour is indicative of a hydrogen atom in an SSHB which is partially shared between two 
atoms and so may also confirm the presence of proton transferring effects.  
Figure 7.2 Fourier difference electron density maps showing the electron density associated with the H-atom in the 
HO
SSHB in DMU2,4-DNBA over the 100 to 350 K temperature range.  
The bond distances of the groups forming the O
HO
SSHB were also followed as a function 
of temperature (Table 7.9). The DMU carbonyl CO shortens, from 1.294(1)  at 100 K to 
1.282(2)  at 350 K, reflecting a slight increase in bond order of this bond, approaching the C=O 
bond length for a neutral carbonyl in the native crystal structure of DMU 
 (1.245(2)  at 273 K), 
and providing additional evidence in support of proton migration. The carbonyl group in DMU in 
the molecular complex therefore retains some protonated character at 350 K, in agreement with the 
elongated OH distance at this temperature which indicates a bias to the DMU in the SSHB. 
Interesting behaviour is observed in the 2,4-DNBA carboxylate group, as the proton moves 
towards the centre of the OHO SSHB with increasing temperature. The deprotonated CO 
bond decreases slightly in length as a function of temperature, from 1.274(1)  at 100 K to 
1.266(2)  at 300 K. This suggests an increased deprotonation of this group and is not in support 
of migration of the proton, away from DMU towards 2,4-DNBA. This effect is, however, very 
small and could be caused by a redistribution of charge in the carboxylate group. The carboxylate 
carbonyl group, not involved in forming the SSHB, shortens from 1.237(1)  at 100 K to 1.225(2) 
 at 350 K, as would be expected for a carboxylic acid group which becomes increasingly 
protonated and is thus in support of proton migration.

In summary, a trend of temperature dependent proton migration is indicated in this molecular 
complex by all information, occurring most significantly between 200 and 350 K.  
Variable temperature study of INP (2:1) 
HO
 SSHB, with an NO distance of 2.551(1)  at 100K, forms between the 
isonicotinamide and phthalic acid components in the molecular complex of INP. The phthalic acid 
(P) acidic proton resides on the IN molecule at 100 K; the molecular complex INP is therefore a 
salt at this temperature. This SSHB donor-acceptor distance is just above the 2.55  limit where 
proton migration has previously been observed across N
HO
 SSHBs. Variable temperature 
measurements were carried out on this material at the Advanced Light Source, U.S.A 
 between 
100 and 350 K.  
The N
HO
 SSHB hydrogen bond parameters were followed with temperature using 
refinement model 1, where the position and isotropic thermal parameter of the SSHB hydrogen 
atom were refined freely (Table 7.10 and Figure 7.3). At 100 K, the proton resides on the 
isonicotinamide with an elongated NH distance of 1.07(2) . As the temperature is increased, 
between 100 and 350 K, the refined proton position shifts gradually, but significantly, towards the 
centre of the N
HO
 hydrogen bond, by approximately 0.1 . A second refinement model 
(model 2), employing a fixed thermal parameter for the SSHB hydrogen atom, was also refined at 
each temperature (A7.2, Table A7.2 and Figure A7.2). Although there are larger errors on the 
H and HO
 distances when employing this model, the same trend of proton migration is 
suggested, of the order of 0.1 . The consistent trends of the SSHB proton migrating towards the 
centre of the hydrogen bond as a function of temperature, indicated in the N
H and HO
lengths in both refinement models, is promising for the presence of temperature dependent proton 
migration in this molecular complex. The N
 SSHB distance remains invariant between 100 
and 300 K with a very slight increase at 350 K. This is supportive of proton migration being the 
cause for the lengthening of the N
H distance as a function of temperature and not occurring as 
a consequence of an expanding hydrogen bond, caused by lattice expansion as a function of 
temperature. 
An OHN hydrogen bond also forms in this structure between the other phthalic acid 
carboxylic acid group and a second isonicotinamide molecule. No proton migration is indicated 
across this hydrogen bond as a function of temperature.

Figure 7.3 The N

 distances in INP over the 100 to 350 K temperature range for refinement model 1. 
Good quality variable temperature Fourier difference maps of the N
HO
 SSHB were 
generated from the data; in these it was possible to elucidate changes in the hydrogen atom density 
as a function of temperature (Figure 7.4). An increasing elongation of the hydrogen atom density 
occurs along the hydrogen bond towards the phthalic acid carboxylate group as the temperature 
increases. This elongation supports the occurrence of temperature dependent proton migration as 
indicated in the N
H and HO
 distances as a function of temperature. The refined hydrogen 
atom positions are slightly offset from the hydrogen atom peak maxima, this effect occurring to 
the same extent at all temperatures.

H end of the N
HO
  SSHB in INP over the 100 to 350 K temperature range. 
The structural parameters of the groups forming the N
HO
 SSHB were also followed as a 
function of temperature (Table 7.11). The CN distances in IN shorten from 1.341(1)  at 100 K 
to 1.329(2)  at 350 K. The IN CNC angle also decreases from 121.10(9)  at 100 K to 120.2(1)  
at 350 K. These structural changes in IN provide additional evidence in support of proton 
migration, away from the IN nitrogen atom; in the native crystal structure of the neutral IN, the 
CN bond lengths are 1.337(2)  and the CNC angle is 116.6(1) . 
 In the phthalic acid 
carboxylate group forming the SSHB, there is little change in the phthalic acid deprotonated CO 
bond length over the temperature range. A shortening of the C=O bond length occurs from 
1.238(1) , at 100 K, to 1.228(2)  at 350 K; this coincides with a transfer of H2 back towards to 
the carboxylic acid group and is in support of proton migration occurring.

A trend of temperature dependent proton migration can be identified in INP, indicated by all 
information. Additional interesting thermal behaviour is observed for this molecular complex in 
the lattice parameters (A7.2, Figure A7.3). A slight contraction of the b-axis and -angle between 
100 and 350 K occurs whilst the a and c-axes undergo significant increases in length. However, 
INP cannot be considered a negative thermal expansion material as the cell volume continues to 
increase with temperature.  
Variable temperature study of 3-DAZABrA hydrate, a complex with a very short OHO 
hydrogen bond 
The molecular complex of 3-DAZABrA hydrate contains an OHO SSHB between the anilic 
acid and 3-deazauracil components with a very short OO distance of 2.411(2)  at 100 K, well 
below the previously proposed 2.45  cut off; the proton in this SSHB also occupies a close to 
central position at 100 K, slightly closer in proximity to the BrA end of the SSHB (dOH 1.16(4)  
and dHO 1.30(4) ); the molecular complex 3-DAZABrA hydrate is therefore in an intermediate 
proton transfer state at this temperature. Variable temperature measurements were carried out on 
3-DAZABrA hydrate at the Advanced Light Source, U.S.A. 
 between 100 and 350 K.  
The OHO SSHB hydrogen bond parameters were followed with temperature using refinement 
model 1, where the position and isotropic thermal parameter of the SSHB hydrogen atom were 
refined freely (Table 7.12 and Figure 7.5). Despite the very strong nature of the OHO 
hydrogen bond formed between the anilic acid and 3-deazauracil, no proton migration was 
suggested in the OH or HO bond lengths over the 100 to 350 K temperature range. Fourier 
difference maps of the OHO hydrogen bond do not show a consistent picture with temperature 
(Figure 7.6); an increased smearing of the proton density along the hydrogen bond occurs between 
100 and 250 K but this does not persist above this temperature. This may be indicative of a change 
in the shape of a presumably single well potential for this SSHB, in which the proton occupies a 
fairly constant average position between the O atoms throughout the temperature range. The 
observation of the hydrogen atom density in the OHO hydrogen bond is more difficult in this 
sample due to the present of the heavy bromine atom, which dominates the X-ray data, and due to 
the hydrogen atom not lying in the same plane as either of the molecules forming the SSHB; the 
hydrogen atom is twisted by 25(2)  out of the plane of the BrA ring whilst it is twisted 3(2)  out 
of the plane of the 3-DAZA ring. Also, the refined hydrogen atom position does not coincide with 
the peak maxima at most temperatures. Future neutron single crystal diffraction data might be of 
value for this complex if sufficiently large crystals can be obtained. The OO distance in the 
SSHB increases by 0.02  with temperature; this increase is more substantial than observed in 
most of the other complexes studied in this chapter and is not suggestive of a situation that would 
support proton migration.

OH and HO distances.

In summary, temperature dependent proton migration cannot be confirmed in the molecular 
complex of 3-DAZABrA hydrate.  
Variable temperature study of DMU3,5-DNBA (1:1) 
An OHO SSHB with an OO distance of 2.472(3)  at 100 K is formed between the acid and 
urea components in the molecular complex of DMU3,5-DNBA. The refined hydrogen atom 
positions show the SSHB proton occupies the centre of the hydrogen bond at 100K (dOH 
1.23(7)  and dHO 1.26(7) ); the molecular complex DMU3,5-DNBA is therefore in an 
intermediate proton transfer state at this temperature. Variable temperature measurements were 
carried out on DMU3,5-DNBA at the Advanced Light Source, U.S.A. 
 between 100 and 300 K.  
The OHO SSHB hydrogen bond parameters were followed with temperature using refinement 
model 1, where the position and isotropic thermal parameter of the SSHB hydrogen atom were 
refined freely (Table 7.14 and Figure 7.7). As a function of temperature, the proton position 
appears to shift away from the centre of the hydrogen bond towards the DMU molecule. However, 
the large errors on the bond lengths suggest that there is insufficient evidence for proton migration. 
The Fourier difference maps of the OHO hydrogen bond contain large amounts of noise, 
making determination of hydrogen atom density and hence thermal behaviour difficult (Figure 
7.8). In these maps, the refined hydrogen atom position does not coincide with the peak maxima at 
most temperatures. The density of the hydrogen atom is biased towards the 3,5-DNBA oxygen 
atom at 100 K, with some smearing along the OHO hydrogen bond. A second peak is present 
at 200 K, indicating possible disorder of the proton over two positions, which remains up to 300 K. 
A structural model where the hydrogen atom is disordered was thus refined at each temperature 
and a 50:50 disorder was suggested at all temperatures, but again with a high degree of 
uncertainty. It is not possible to determine the hydrogen atom behaviour reliably as a function of 
temperature in this molecular complex. The OO distance in the SSHB fluctuates with 
temperature; this behaviour is not suggestive of proton migration.

The structural parameters of the groups forming the SSHB (Table 7.15) add to the conclusion that 
no deduction of the presence or absence of migration can be made in this case, as they suggest a 
different trend to that of the OH and HO bond lengths over the temperature range; the CO 
bonds instead suggest the proton resides on the 3,5-DNBA molecule and becomes increasingly 
bonded with temperature.

In summary, the presence of temperature dependent proton migration cannot be confirmed in the 
molecular complex of DMU3,5-DNBA.  
Variable temperature study of DMUP (2:1) 
Two OHO SSHBs with OO distances of 2.493(2)  (O3H1O6) and 2.452(2)   
 (O2H2O5) are formed at 100 K between the acid and urea components in the molecular 
complex of DMUP with both the SSHB protons residing on the phthalic acid molecule. Variable 
temperature measurements were carried out on DMUP at the Advanced Light Source, U.S.A 
between 100 and 300 K. 
The OHO SSHB hydrogen bond parameters were followed with temperature using refinement 
model 1, where the position and isotropic thermal parameter of the SSHB hydrogen atom were 
refined freely (Table 7.16 and Figure 7.9). An elongated OH distance is found in both the  
OHO hydrogen bonds at 100 K; these lengthen as the temperature is increased to 300 K, 
although these changes are not significant enough to suggest proton migration. The Fourier 
difference maps contain large amounts of noise making determination of hydrogen atom behaviour 
difficult (Figure 7.10). The refined hydrogen atom positions also do not coincide with the peak 
maxima at most temperatures. The shape of the density of the hydrogen atom does not appear to 
change with temperature in either of the O3H1O6 and O2H2O5 hydrogen bonds; no 
temperature dependent proton migration is suggested across these interactions. The OO distance 
in the O3H1O6 SSHB fluctuates whilst it increases in the O2H2O5 SSHB; neither 
behaviour is suggestive of proton migration.

The structural parameters of the groups forming the SSHB (Table 7.17) add to the conclusion that 
no deduction of the presence or absence of migration can be made in this case; the DMUP C=O 
distances shorten, indicating an increase in bond order, the opposite of what would be expected for 
transfer of the phthalic acid proton across the SSHB to DMU, whilst in the phthalic acid 
carboxylic acid groups there is no change in the CO bond and the C=O bond fluctuates in 
length.

In summary, temperature dependent proton migration cannot be confirmed in the molecular 
complex of DMUP.  
Variable temperature study of IN2,4-DNBA II (2:2) 
Two N
HO
 hydrogen bonds are formed between isonicotinamide and 2,4-dinitrobenzoic acid 
components in the molecular complex of IN2,4-DNBA II at 100 K; one is a charge assisted  
HO
 SSHB with an N
 distance of 2.555(1)  (N1
H2O5
) whilst the other is a 
charge assisted strong to moderate hydrogen bond with an N
 distance of 2.636(1)   
H1O9
). The molecular complex IN2,4-DNBA is a salt at 100 K as a result of the proton 
transfer between the IN and 2,4-DNBA species at this temperature. Variable temperature 
measurements were carried out on this material at the Advanced Light Source, U.S.A. 
 between 
100 and 350 K.  
The N
HO
 SSHB hydrogen bond parameters were followed with temperature using 
refinement model 1, where the position and isotropic thermal parameter of the SSHB hydrogen 
atom were refined freely (Table 7.18 and Figure 7.11). At 100 K, the proton resides on the 
isonicotinamide in the N1
H2O5
 SSHB with an elongated N
H distance of 1.04(2)  and 
an HO
 distance of 1.52(2) . As the temperature is increased, between 100 and 350 K, the 
proton position shifts, in a fluctuating manner towards the centre of the N1
H2O5
hydrogen 
bond. At 350 K, the N
H distance has lengthened to 1.12(2) and the HO
 distance shortens to 
1.46(2). Whilst this may indicate a migration of 0.08 , the trend is not consistent and not 
significant when the errors are taken into account. It was also not possible to confidently identify 
proton migration in the Fourier difference maps of the SSHB (Figure 7.12). The maps show an 
elongation of the hydrogen atom along the hydrogen bond but this does not increase consistently 
across the temperature range and by 350 K, the increased thermal motion of the entire system is 
reflected in the noise in the Fourier difference map. The refined hydrogen atom positions are 
slightly offset from the hydrogen atom peak maxima; occurring to the same extent at all 
temperatures. The N
 distance in the SSHB increases by approximately 0.014  with 
temperature; this increase is substantial and is not suggestive of proton migration. No proton 
migration is indicated across the N2
H1O9
 hydrogen bond as a function of temperature as 
would be expected for the long N
 distance.

in both the CO and C=O bond lengths of the 2,4-DNBA carboxylate group. Transfer of H2 from 
the protonated IN nitrogen atom back to the 2,4-DNBA acid group would be consistent with the 
shortening of C=O, but not the shortening of CO. A shortening of the IN CN bond lengths 
occurs, as the temperature increases, which could also suggest a transfer of H2 back to the 
carboxylic acid group. A clear picture of proton migration in this system is lacking, however.

In summary, temperature dependent proton migration cannot be confirmed in the molecular 
complex of IN2,4-DNBA II.  
7.3.2 Variable temperature studies of proton migration on a laboratory source 
Variable temperature X-ray diffraction on a laboratory diffraction source was carried out on the 
molecular complexes, where possible, engineered in Chapter 6. Data collections were carried out 
at two temperatures to investigate for potential proton migration behaviour (Table 7.20 to Table 
7.22). Due to the long N
 hydrogen bond distances in the N-heterocycle and anilic acid 
molecular complexes, all greater than 2.6 , these samples were not the focus for temperature 
dependent proton migration studies. The two data collections were generally carried out at 100 or 
150 K for the low temperature determination and 300 K for the higher. 
Proton migration was not suggested in these molecular complexes, based on the DH and HA 
distances and Fourier difference maps of the SSHBs at the two temperatures. In nearly all cases the 
DA distance is greater than the previously proposed limits for proton migration to be observed 
across an OHO or N
HO
 SSHB. Exceptions to this are DMU5-NIP and  
3-DAZA2,4-DNBA with OHO SSHBs donor-acceptor distances below the migration limit at 
150 K (dOO 2.434(2) and 2.449(1) , respectively); however, no proton migration is indicated in 
either of these molecular complexes between 150 and 300 K. A very short intramolecular  
OHO
 hydrogen bond is formed in INZP (dOO 2.379(1) ). There is no significant change in 
the hydrogen atom position or the electron density within the intramolecular hydrogen bond over 
the 100 to 350 K temperature range (Figure 7.13). This is unsurprising in this case where these 
hydrogen bonds have a steric contribution and are often unsymmetrical, 
 and so are unlikely to 
exhibit proton migration.

7.3.3 Following temperature dependent proton migration using synchrotron and X-ray 
diffraction 
From the variable temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies and refinement in  
SHELXL, 
 it was possible to identify temperature dependent proton migration in two molecular 
complexes DMU2,4-DNBA and INP.  
Its identification, in these cases, is aided by consistent trends being observed across all 
information. In particular, the same migration trend is observed between the DH and HA 
lengths and the Fourier difference maps; this is important where Fourier difference maps give the 
most reliable picture of the hydrogen atom behaviour. 
 Trends in the reliably determined heavy 
atom positions, including donor-acceptor distances and bond lengths of the groups forming the 
SSHBs, also support the migration. There is not complete agreement in the refined hydrogen atom 
position and the peak maximum in the Fourier difference maps of these two systems. This is likely 
caused by the refined X-ray positions attempting to model the hydrogen atom density with a 
isotropic thermal parameter when, in an SSHB, it has a more anisotropic shape; this leads to an 
incorrect shifting of the atom away from its true position. 
  The difference is, however, small 
and consistent over the temperature range meaning the refined hydrogen atom positions can be 
relied on; this is further evidence of the importance of consistent trends being observed in these 
studies. The identification of temperature dependent proton migration in DMU2,4-DNBA and INP 
using the synchrotron technique is assisted by relatively noise free Fourier difference maps, for the 
reliable determination of hydrogen atom behaviour, and low values of error on the hydrogen atom 
bond parameters such that shifts in the proton positions are greater than the error limits for the 
determination and therefore significant; in DMU2,4-DNBA and INP the values of error on the D
H and HA distances are relatively small at  = 0.02 to 0.03, the errors increasing with 
determination temperature.  
Temperature dependent proton migration is not identifiable in the other molecular complexes 
studied using synchrotron X-ray diffraction of 3-DAZABrA hydrate, DMU3,5-DNBA, DMUP and 
IN2,4-DNBA. In general, the Fourier difference maps are noisier than those of DMU2,4-DNBA 
and INP; this makes determination of hydrogen atom behaviour within them more difficult and in 
most cases, the combined evidence indicate a lack of proton migration. A conclusion that no 
proton migration is occurring in these molecular complexes would tend to be more reliable than 
proving that proton migration is present.  
The use of the synchrotron technique, in these studies, therefore appears reliant on a number of 
factors. The importance of consistent trends across all information, particularly where supported 
by more reliable Fourier difference maps or heavy atom positions, is emphasised for confidence in 
the identification of temperature dependent proton migration using the synchrotron X-ray 
diffraction technique. This is not only of relevance here but also in all studies of proton transfer. 
Proton migration behaviour could also only be determined reliably where Fourier difference maps 
are relatively noise free; this emphasises the need for optimised Fourier difference maps in these 
studies. These studies implemented the same data collection strategy across the molecular 
complexes, collecting a fast scan to replace overloaded reflections followed by collecting 
additional low angle data, where the hydrogen atom contribution to the scattering is more 
significant; with the speed of collection of the synchrotron and the intrinsically higher intensity, 
such a strategy can be deployed readily. The increased noise in the Fourier difference maps of  
3-DAZABrA hydrate, DMU3,5-DNBA, DMUP and IN2,4-DNBA, compared to in those of 
DMU2,4-DNBA and INP, may therefore be a consequence of lower sample quality. Being able to 
determine the proton transfer behaviour using synchrotron X-ray diffraction may therefore also be 
dependent on the nature of the sample under study. Increased noise in some of the Fourier 
difference maps may also indicate the need for additional corrections such as for sample 
absorption or extinction. 
The potential of the synchrotron technique to collect diffraction data from which proton migration 
behaviour may be determined is indicated, provided conditions are optimised. The speed of data 
collection offered by the synchrotron technique is advantageous in the variable temperature studies 
allowing the proton transfer behaviour to be probed at a number of points along the 100 to 350 K 
temperature profile allowing a smoother observation of trends and in allowing these effects to be 
studied in an increased number of systems. The initial variable temperature studies carried out on a 
laboratory source were useful in the initial identification of molecular complexes to study at a 
synchrotron and in the identification of materials in which temperature dependent proton migration 
was unlikely to be occurring based on the DH and HA and SSHB donor-acceptor distances.  
7.3.4 Proton migration effects 
The study of temperature dependent proton migration in the molecular complexes allows an 
understanding of this process in the solid state. 
The synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies indicated temperature dependent proton migration of 
0.12  in DMU2,4-DNBA, between 200 and 350 K, and 0.1  in INP, between 100 and 350 K. 
The extents of temperature dependent proton migration across SSHB observed in molecular 
complexes in the literature are generally reported from neutron studies (Table 7.23). This makes a 
comparison of the extent of migration observed in DMU2,4-DNBA and INP to those previously 
reported more difficult; the neutron and X-ray diffraction techniques observe different 
characteristics of the hydrogen atom and as such hydrogen atom positions given by X-rays are 
shifted relative to those from neutrons. 
 However, it has been noted that, in a combined X-ray 
and neutron diffraction study of proton migration in urea phosphoric acid, a shift in the proton 
position as a result of migration was observed in neutron measurements to be 0.04 , while in X-
ray measurements this was indicated to be 0.1 . 
 Considering this simple comparison, a shift of 
0.12 , as observed for DMU2,4-DNBA from X-ray data, could be equivalent to a shift of 0.045  
from neutron data. For DMU2,4-DNBA, a similar extent of proton migration to that in N,N-
dimethylurea oxalic acid is then found; 
 here the OHO hydrogen bond lengths are also 
similar suggesting that the conversion of apparent migration magnitudes between X-ray and 
neutron determinations may be a reasonable approximation. The extent of proton migration 
observed in DMU2,4-DNBA and INP is therefore in the range of that seen in previous proton 
migration studies (approximately 0.03 to 0.1 ). The nature of the proton migration occurring for 
DMU2,4-DNBA is most similar to that in urea phosphoric acid 
 where the proton migrates 
across a charge assisted O
HO
 SSHB, from the substituted urea end to the middle of the 
SSHB; the SSHB is however notably shorter in urea phosphoric acid. For INP, there are 
similarities in the nature of the proton migration occurring with 4,4-bipyridine 1,2,3,4-
tetracarboxylic acid 
 and with pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid 
 where the proton migrates 
across a charge assisted N
HO
SSHB away from the nitro end; however unlike in INP, in 
these molecular complexes the extent of migration is significantly greater such that at 300 K, the 
proton is closer to the oxygen atom.

Several explanations for the temperature dependent proton migration occurring across SSHBs have 
been suggested. A small number of studies attribute the migration to a static hydrogen bond 
potential with a shape such that the first excited state lies close to the acceptor atom and it 
becomes increasingly populated with temperature; the effect is observed as migration.

most cases, the effect of proton migration has been attributed to thermal fluctuations in the 
molecular environment induced by lattice vibrations; the result is a very subtle change in shape of 
the hydrogen bond potential energy well and a shift in the minimum, closer to the hydrogen bond 
acceptor atom. This explanation has been advanced for urea phosphoric acid, 
299, 300
 3,5-pyridine 
dicarboxylic acid 
 and 4,4-bipyridine 1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid. 
 In some cases no clear 
explanation has been advanced for the mechanism of proton migration, including in the case of  
4-methyl pyridine pentachlorophenol, which is proposed to be caused by either a change in 
thermal population of a static unsymmetrical hydrogen bond potential well or by subtle changes in 
the potential well itself. 
 In molecular complexes of N,N and N,N-dimethylurea oxalic acid, 
only a slight elongation in the hydrogen atom density was observed in Fourier difference maps 
calculated from neutron diffraction data, indicating that the apparent migration could be attributed 
to causes other than simply the effect of increased thermal motion. 
The temperature dependent proton migration behaviour occurring in the molecular complex of 
DMU2,4-DNBA is most similar to that in urea phosphoric acid, migrating from an off-centred to 
an increasingly centred position, with increasing temperature, in a charge assisted SSHB. As a 
function of temperature, there is also only a slight elongation in the hydrogen atom density in the 
X-ray Fourier difference maps indicating that the apparent migration can be attributed to causes 
other than just being an effect of increased thermal motion. Therefore, it could be that a similar 
proton migration mechanism, as occurring in urea phosphoric acid, 
299, 300
 occurs here in DMU2,4-
DNBA; attributable to thermal fluctuations in the molecular environment induced by lattice 
vibrations. For INP, the nature of temperature dependent proton migration behaviour is most 
similar to that in 3,5-pyridine dicarboxylic acid 
 and 4,4-bipyridine 1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic 
 where the proton migrates across a charge assisted N
HO
 SSHB away from the 
nitrogen end. However, a significant smearing of the hydrogen atom density in the X-ray Fourier 
difference maps is observed with temperature and so it is less clear in this sample whether 
migration between 100 and 350 K is simply an effect of increased thermal motion or if the same 
mechanisms as those in 3,5-pyridine dicarboxylic acid and 4,4-bipyridine 1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic 
acid are occurring, attributed to thermal fluctuations in the molecular environment induced by 
lattice vibrations.  
Manifestation of temperature dependent proton migration across SSHBs 
The observation of temperature dependent proton migration may allow insight into its 
manifestation in the solid state, and therefore design into future materials.  
Temperature dependent proton migration has been reported for certain SSHB donor-acceptor 
distances only. For an OHO SSHB, a limit of 2.45  has been proposed, above which no 
proton migration is expected. In the molecular complexes containing OHO SSHBs, proton 
migration was only identifiable in DMU2,4-DNBA, where the OO distance is 2.441(1)  at  
100 K. Proton migration is not indicated in any of the molecular complexes with OO distances 
above 2.45  including molecular complexes with SSHB donor-acceptor distances just above the 
limit such as DMUP (dOO 2.493(2) and 2.452(2)  at 100 K) and DMU3,5-DNBA (dOO 2.472(3) 
 at 100 K). The previously proposed 2.45  limit for migration is therefore consistent with the 
molecular complexes in this study. The shorter donor-acceptor distance favours the increasingly 
symmetric hydrogen bond potential energy surface and low barrier to proton transfer such that 
migration is possible. Being below the proposed 2.45  limit, however, does not appear to be a 
guarantee for the occurrence of proton migration. In 3-DAZABrA hydrate, an OHO SSHB is 
formed well below the limit (dOO 2.411(1)  at 100 K) but no temperature dependent migration is 
indicated. Although the donor-acceptor distance is very short in this molecular complex, the 
hydrogen bond has low directionality (<OHO 152(4) ) and this may lead to a less symmetric 
potential well making proton migration less favourable. For an N
HO
 SSHB, temperature 
dependent proton migration has not been identified above 2.55 ; reported in isoniazid 4-
aminosalicylic acid (dNO 2.548(2) ), 
 pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid (dNO 2.523(2) ) 
4,4-bipyridine benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid (dNO 2.5220(17) ). 
 INP has the longest 
HO
 hydrogen bond across which proton migration is identifiable (dNO 2.551(1) ) and is 
just above the 2.55  limit. From variable temperature studies of IN2,4-DNBA, it was not possible 
to identify the presence of temperature dependent proton migration; in this complex the SSHB has 
a slightly longer donor-acceptor distance (dNO 2.555(1) ) than INP. Therefore, it may be that the 
limit for proton migration across N
HO
 SSHBs is somewhere in the narrow range of 2.551 
and 2.555 . The SSHB distance is therefore shown to tune the occurrence of proton migration 
across SSHBs.  
The value of pKa has previously been correlated to the extent of proton migration occurring 
across OHO SSHBs in substituted urea organic acid molecular complexes; 
 a greater extent 
of proton migration was observed where the pKa of the two components forming the SSHB 
became increasingly less negative (i.e. approached zero). The values of pKa for each of the 
proton migration materials are included in Table 7.23. DMU2,4-DNBA has a value of pKa 1.12 
and exhibits a large shift in proton position of 0.12  in the X-ray study, corresponding to an 
estimated shift of 0.045  from a neutron determination. Extents of proton migration observed in 
previous OHO SSHBs are, in increasing order, 0.031(9)  for N,N-dimethylurea oxalic acid, 
0.04  for urea phosphoric acid, 0.045(9)  for N,N-dimethylurea oxalic acid with increasingly 
less negative pKa values of 1.94, 1.87 and 1.56, respectively. DMU2,4-DNBA fits in this 
trend alongside N,N-dimethylurea oxalic acid with an estimated shift of approximately 0.045  for 
neutrons and a pKa value of 1.12. These findings are therefore in support of the trend suggested 
by Jones et al. (2012) on the nature of proton migration across SSHBs in substituted urea organic 
acid molecular complexes related to pKa values. 
 One finding of interest is the lack of variable 
temperature proton migration suggested in 3-DAZABrA hydrate, despite the presence of a very 
short SSHB (dOO 2.411(1) ) and the pKa value of 0.06; this pKa is the closest to zero amongst 
the relevant complexes studied to date. It may be that that some imbalance in the pKa values is 
required for any proton migration to be observed between components. Across the previously 
studied N
HO
 proton migration materials, including INP from this chapter, an opposite and 
less consistent trend is observed; the extent of proton migration appears to increase as the pKa 
values are more positive and further away from zero. The extents of proton migration observed in 
HO
 SSHBs are, in increasing order, 0.1  for INP in the X-ray study, corresponding to an 
estimated shift of 0.04  from a neutron determination, 0.14  for isoniazid 4-aminosalicyclic acid 
in the X-ray study, corresponding to an estimated shift of 0.056  from a neutron determination, 
0.08  for pentachlorophenol 4-methylpyridine, 0.09  for pyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid and  
0.1  for 4,4-bipyridyl-benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylic acid. The corresponding pKa values are 
0.44, 0.21, 1.26, 1.8 and 1.4, respectively. The problems of transferring pKa values to the solid 
state, only valid under the solution equilibrium conditions at which they were determined, 
therefore indicated. It may be that pKa values may be used to access temperature dependent 
proton migration materials in crystal engineering strategies, seeming more likely for those 
containing OHO SSHBs proton migration, however further examples are required before this 
can be proven.  
7.4 Parametric structural refinement in Topas-Academic V5.0 
Parametric structural refinement in Topas-Academic V5.0 
 has also been applied in the study of 
temperature dependent proton migration in this research project. The approach is trialled and 
developed on variable temperature single crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction data collected on 
molecular complexes DMU2,4-DNBA, identified as a proton migration material in 7.3, and for 
the molecular complex of benzimidazole 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (BZN4-OHBA) which has been 
identified as having ambiguity in the proton transfer behaviour. 
Two approaches were applied for the single crystal synchrotron variable temperature X-ray 
diffraction data collections. These were (i) collecting data at each temperature with stepwise 
temperature ramping (STEP) and (ii) collecting data with a continuous ramping of temperature 
(CONT.). The continuous ramping method allows evolving information to be accessed along the 
temperature profile. For the sample DMU2,4-DNBA, single crystal variable temperature 
diffraction data were collected in a step wise approach collecting in 10 K temperature steps, 
between 100 and 350 K. For BZN4-OHBA, single crystal variable temperature diffraction data 
were collected in a step-wise temperature ramping approach collecting in 20 K temperature steps, 
between 100 and 300 K and also collected continuously, with a continuous ramping of temperature 
(120K hr
); the data could then be split into various temperature increments, with a single average 
temperature determined for each effective diffraction pattern from experimental log files. 
7.4.1 Setting up the refinement of single crystal data in Topas-Academic V5.0 
The setup of a parametric refinement in Topas-Academic V5.0 
 was carried out in two stages. 
An input file for structural refinement at a single temperature was first set up in which the 
structural models for DMU2,4-DNBA and BZN4-OHBA were optimised and refinement choices 
finalised. This single temperature input file (single/rigid.inp) was then used as the seed to 
generate the multi-temperature parametric input file (multi.inp) for structural refinement over the 
specified temperature range and variable temperature data.  
Both the single and multi-temperature files were set up with the same format, having sections for:  
 general refinement information including the output R-factors (Rwp) (4.2.3);  
 define to select refinement choices; 
 use_t0000 for the selection of temperature/dataset against which to refine; 
 xdd_scr containing information for each data set (seed information) including unit cell 
parameters, selected structural information and refinement choices; 
 for xdds containing data treatment information for all data sets (weighting schemes and 
data cut-offs); 
 for strs within the for_xdds section containing the structural model to be refined against 
the data.  
Single.inp 
Initial single temperature single crystal structural refinements were performed on the 100 K data 
set for each molecular complex in a single.inp file in Topas-Academic V5.0. 
 A number of 
refinement parameters were varied within the file to optimise the structural model. The structural 
model was assessed based on the value of the refined R-factor (Rwp). 
The input starting model was that of the 100 K structure, in CIF format, for each molecular 
complex obtained from crystal structure solution and refinement against the 100 K data set using 
SHELX programs 
218, 219
 in the WingGX package. 
 The same starting model was used for  
BZN4-OHBA STEP and BZN4-OHBA CONT.; that of BZN4-OHBA STEP at 100 K. Each 
structure was refined against the data with a 2 cut off of 60  for DMU2,4-DNBA and 50  for 
BZN4-OHBA STEP and CONT., chosen where there were few reflections with significant 
intensity beyond these limits, and a standard Topas-Academic V5.0 
 weighting scheme, 
weighting reflections with a value of 1 if Yobs<1, or equal to 1/Yobs, if Yobs > 1. An extinction 
coefficient was also applied as this was seen to improve the refinement.  
In the structural model, the atomic coordinates were allowed to vary within minimum and 
maximum limits (0.05) and the atomic thermal displacement parameters were also refined. The 
hydrogen atom isotropic thermal parameters were refined with Beq values, constrained to be equal 
and allowed to vary within minimum and maximum limits (5). The heavy atom thermal 
parameters were refined both isotropically and anisotropically, with individual Ueq values; 
anisotropic refinement in Topas-Academic V5.0 
 was made possible by the quality of the single 
crystal data. A thermal correction was applied to the structure factors involving an isotropic 
scaling of the thermal parameters at each temperature using, either an isotropic temperature factor 
proportional to Beq (Equation 7.1), Bfix, or proportional to Uiso (Equation 7.2), Ufix.  
Equation 7.1    = [ 
()/] 
Equation 7.2     = [ 
()/]
where 1 Beq is equivalent to 8
The success of each model was assessed in the output R-factors. Low R-factors were achieved for 
each model (Table 7.24) indicating a good refinement and in each case, well behaved structures 
were refined. Anisotropic refinement of the heavy atom thermal parameters gave lower R-factors 
than isotropic refinement suggesting it to be the better model. There were no differences in the  
R-factors on changing the type of thermal correction applied to the data; as Ufix values are more 
commonly used in small molecule crystallography, it will be the thermal correction applied in all 
models that follow.

complex at 100 K.

The data treatment information and structural model are included in single.inp in the for_xdds 
section.  
Rigid.inp 
The structural model in the single.inp was developed to include refinement of molecules as rigid 
bodies (rigid.inp) with rotational and translational components defined about a central atom. This 
allowed a reduction in the number of overall refinement parameters. The rotations and translations 
of each molecule were included in the xdd_scr section. Rigid bodies were refined for the 
isotropic and anisotropic thermal parameter models; there was no change in the R-factors on 
applying this model (Table 7.25) at 100 K. The stability of this rigid body model was also tested as 
the data collection temperature approached room temperature. In the case of the anisotropic 
refinement of thermal parameters, the R-factor experienced a small increase in each molecular 
complex and the structure remained stable. In contrast, the isotropic refinement of thermal 
parameters in the rigid body at 300 K led to an unstable refinement of the structural model in 
which the hydrogen atoms were no longer in sensible refined positions. For the stable refinement 
of hydrogen atoms at all temperatures, a model with anisotropic thermal parameters is therefore 
recommended.  
A TLS approximation for rigid body motion was also trialled (2.4.3) in order to introduce a low 
parameter method to describe heavy atom thermal parameter evolution as a function of 
temperature. This model was implemented in the xdd_scr section. To implement the TLS model, 
the TLS tensors were set to starting values of zero and the atomic fractional coordinates, taken 
from the for_strs in the for_xdds section, were converted to Cartesian coordinates using 
Equation 2.22 and Equation 2.23 (2.4.3). The Cartesian coordinates were then used, alongside the 
TLS tensors, as refined from the data to generate the TLS modelled anisotropic thermal parameters 
(U11, U22, U33, U12, U13, U23); the TLS modelled Uij were output in Cartesian format for the non-
orthorhombic complexes (BZN4-OHBA). Larger R-factors were refined for the TLS model  
(Table 7.25), particularly at the higher temperature, compared to normal refinement of the 
anisotropic thermal parameters. However, where the increase is small, the TLS model may be 
suitable for the refinement of the heavy atom thermal parameters.

temperature for each molecular complex. An x denotes an unsuccessful refinement.

The high temperature heavy atom thermal parameters were compared visually between the 
anisotropic and TLS models for each molecular complex (A7.3, Figure A7.4 to Figure A7.5). 
Figure 7.14 is representative of the comparison, shown for DMU2,4-DNBA. There was some 
agreement in the visual appearance of the thermal parameters between the normal and TLS 
modelled anisotropic thermal parameters in each molecular complex. Alongside the similarities in 
R-factors, this indicates the TLS model may be suitable for the refinement of the heavy atom 
thermal parameters in place of a normal anisotropic model. To further assess the correctness of the 
TLS model set up in Topas-Academic V5.0, 
 refinement of each high temperature structure was 
also carried out in Jana2006, 
 refined with both normal and TLS heavy atom anisotropic thermal 
parameters. There was some agreement in the visual appearance of the thermal parameters 
between the Topas-Academic V5.0 
 and Jana2006 
 TLS refinements (A7.3, Figure A7.4 to 
Figure A7.5).

Topas Academic V5.0 
 and (c) TLS refinement in Jana2006 
 in DMU2,4-DNBA at 300 K. 
The TLS tensor values between the Topas-Academic V5 
 and Jana2006 
 refinements were 
also compared (A7.3, Figure A7.6 to Figure A7.10). The S term was small to almost negligable 
for all molecular components and thus there was good agreement between the Topas-Academic 
 and Jana2006 
 output values. The L terms were also small for all molecular components 
and again there was good agreement between the Topas-Academic V5.0 
 and Jana2006 
output values. The T tensors were the largest, with those output from Topas-Academic V5.0 
generally disagreeing with those output from Jana2006; 
 larger values were output from Topas-
Academic V5.0. 
 The discrepancies in the TLS tensors between the different refinement 
programs indicate that the approximation in Topas-Academic V5.0 
 may not be correct. This 
may be caused by differences in the refinement parameters between the software programs; in 
addition, in this case only a basic TLS refinement was carried out in Jana2006, 
 which may not 
be optimised. However, where the R-factors and visual appearance of the refined anisotropic 
thermal parameters indicated the Topas-Academic V5.0 
 TLS approximation to be reasonable, it 
was trialled alongside a normal anisotropic refinement to model the heavy atom thermal 
parameters over the multi-temperature datasets.  
Definition of the hydrogen atom behaviour 
The hydrogen atom of interest in each molecular complex was defined in the xdd_scr section of 
the rigid.inp file, separate from the rest of the molecular structure in the for_xdds section. This 
allowed models to be applied to the hydrogen atom position as a function of temperature. Two 
models were employed, defined using ifdef statements which could be selected or deselected in 
the general refinement choices section. Model 1 Hfree allowed free refinement of the hydrogen 
position over the temperature range, within minimum and maximum limits (0.05). Model 2 
Hpara applied parametric behaviour to the hydrogen atom position over the temperature range 
where an aim of this work was to drive a linear migration trend (Hpara) of the hydrogen atom 
position that could be benchmarked against the data during the parametric refinement. A modified 
version of the Taylors series expansion (Equation 7.3) 
 was used. 
Equation 7.3    =   ( +    
    +    
  
where  contains the atomic coordinates of the hydrogen atom, 000 contains the initial 
atomic coordinates of the hydrogen atom, a and b are the Taylor expansion coefficients refined 
over the whole data and Tshift is defined by Equation 7.4 and is used to reduce correlations and 
bring the temperatures onto a -1 to +1 scale. 
Equation 7.4   = (

()
Multi.inp 
The single temperature refinement rigid.inp containing the finalised structural model and 
refinement choices were used to generate the multi-temperature parametric file (multi.inp). The 
rigid.inp file was modified to include use_t0000 for all temperatures over the studied range. The 
xdd_scr section was also expanded for its application to each refinement temperature, carried out 
using the program Substitute. 
Several multi.inp files were set up in which different refinement models were applied. These 
included refining the heavy atom thermal parameters using a normal anisotropic model or 
modelled using the TLS approximation (the TLS behaviour was defined in the xdd_scr at each 
temperature). The rigid-body rotations and translations were also defined by two models (defined 
in the xdd_scr section at each temperature); allowed either to refine freely at each temperature, 
except at 100 K where they were fixed, or fixed at each temperature (at those of the 100 K 
structure) and having the effect of reducing refinement parameters.  
An approach of refining over all data sets simultaneously (a surface approach) and carrying out 
consecutive single refinements (an independent approach) at each temperature was also trialled. 
7.4.2 Parametric structural refinement using multi.inp in Topas-Academic V5.0 
The multi-temperature multi.inp files for each molecular complex and for the different models 
were run in Topas-Academic V5.0. 
R-factors 
Both independent and surface refinements were trialled for each multi.inp. The surface 
refinements were stable for all molecular complexes leading to well behaved structures and 
anisotropic thermal parameters. In contrast, the independent approach was only stable for the TLS 
refinement of anisotropic thermal parameters for DMU2,4-DNBA (Hfree only) and BZN4-OHBA 
STEP (Hfree and Hpara). The overall R-factors for the surface refinements are presented in  
Table 7.26 and Table 7.27 for the different Hfree and Hpara models. 
Between the different surface refinements, the refinement of the rigid body rotations and 
translations at each temperature (except at 100 K) was indicated as a better approach than their 
fixing at the same start values over the temperature range, giving lower overall R-factors for each 
molecular complex and being the most structurally stable. When all rigid in the TLS approach, the 
anisotropic thermal parameters became non-positive definite indicating the fixing of the rigid body 
rotations and translations at the same start values over the temperature range to be unsuitable here. 
Higher overall R-factors were obtained for the refinement of the anisotropic thermal parameters 
using the TLS approach compared to when a normal anisotropic refinement was employed. 
However, the increase is small suggesting the TLS approach to be an appropriate model; the TLS 
anisotropic thermal parameters were also seen to increase in size as a function of temperature 
indicating this model to be working. There was little difference in the overall R-factors refined for 
Hfree and Hpara hydrogen atom behaviour models. Of interest, in the surface refinement of  
BZN4-OHBA CONT., where the refinement of the rigid body rotations and translations (except at 
100 K) was carried out, the implementation of the Hfree model led to a single nitrogen atom having 
non-positive definite thermal parameters at 100 K whilst the implementation of Hpara led to 
sensible thermal parameters for this atom at 100 K; this indicates the importance of every 
parameter contributing to the overall structural refinement.

The R-factors for each molecular complex for each temperature data set were also recorded. 
(A7.3, Figure A7.11 to Figure A7.18). Figure 7.15 is representative of the variable temperature 
R-factor (Rwp) plots. The free refinement of the anisotropic thermal parameters with an isotropic 
scaling led to a well-shaped plot of the R-factors as a function of temperature; the low and high 
temperatures had R-factors at extremes. The implementation of the TLS model of the anisotropic 
thermal parameters led to an increase in the R-factors at each temperature but also had a general 
effect of flattening out the well-shaped changes. The surface refinements led to much flatter trends 
in the R-factors than the independent refinements as a function of temperature (Figure A7.12 and 
Figure A7.15).

TLS tensors 
The TLS tensors refined from the TLS model of anisotropic thermal parameters (A7.3, Figure 
A7.19 to Figure A7.35) indicated that, as a function of temperature for DMU2,4-DNBA and 
BZN4-OHBA, the translational elements of the rigid body motion increased the most followed by 
the librational elements whilst there was little change in S tensors. 
Proton migration effects 
Across the molecular complexes, the best multi-temperature structural refinements in Topas-
Academic V5.0 
 were indicated as those which involved a surface approach where the rigid 
body rotations and translations (except at 100 K) were refined and where normal anisotropic 
thermal parameters were refined or modelled using the TLS method. The proton migration 
behaviour was assessed using these best approaches for each molecular complex in the DH and 
HA distances of the SSHB output from these approaches, for the Hfree and Hpara models.  
DMU2,4-DNBA 
The proton migration behaviour for each surface refinement is shown in Figure 7.16. For the Hfree 
models (Figure 7.16(a)i and b(i)), there is good agreement in the proton migration behaviour 
suggested between the normal anisotropic and TLS refinement of the anisotropic displacement 
parameters; the hydrogen atom transfers from a central position in the hydrogen bond back 
towards the protonated DMU molecule as a function of temperature. For the Hpara models (Figure 
7.16(a)ii and (b)ii), there is good agreement in the proton migration behaviour suggested between 
150 and 350 K by the normal anisotropic and TLS refinement models of the anisotropic 
displacement parameter; the hydrogen atom transfers from a central position in the hydrogen bond 
back towards the protonated DMU molecule as a function of temperature. Below 150 K, the 
hydrogen atom start points differ; the TLS refinement of the anisotropic thermal parameters 
indicates a less central starting position for the hydrogen atom however this difference may be 
consistent within error. 
The Hpara and Hfree models show similar proton transfer behaviour; the application of the Hpara 
model appears to smooth the trend observed. The trend in the proton transfer behaviour suggested 
by these models is, however, not in agreement with that suggested in 7.3.1 from the single crystal 
refinements of variable temperature data in SHELXL-2013; 
 the proton migrates from the DMU 
towards the centre of the hydrogen bond between 200 and 350 K. It was, however, possible to 
obtain similar behaviour to that from SHELX on using a variation of the Hpara model (Hpara_2) 
where a and b were set to zero in Equation 7.3 and, at each temperature, the refinement was 
referred back to the starting Hx0y0z0 in the for_xdds section. This was applied in a surface 
refinement with the refinement of the rigid body rotations and translations (except at 100 K) 
(Figure 7.17).

BZN4-OHBA STEP 
The proton migration behaviour for each surface refinement is shown in Figure 7.18. For the Hfree 
models (Figure 7.18 (a)i and (b)i), the proton migration behaviour suggested disagrees between the 
normal anisotropic and TLS refinement models of the anisotropic displacement parameters; the 
normal anisotropic displacement parameters model suggests migration of the proton towards the 
centre of the hydrogen bond as a function of temperature whilst the TLS refinement indicates little 
change in the hydrogen atom position. For the Hpara models (Figure 7.18 (a)ii and (b)ii), there is 
some agreement in the proton migration behaviour suggested between normal anisotropic and TLS 
refinement models of the anisotropic displacement parameters; the hydrogen atom undergoes some 
transfer towards the centre of the hydrogen bond as a function of temperature. However, where 
this movement is only very slight, this could also be interpreted as no migration occurring. The 
surface refinement with Hfree employed alongside the normal refinement of anisotropic thermal 
parameters results in the least similar behaviour to the other three models; the hydrogen atom 
moves from a less centred position at 100 K.  
The single crystal refinement of variable temperature data in SHELXL-2013 
 (Figure 7.19) does 
not indicate any significant proton migration in this molecular complex as a function of 
temperature. The surface models, excluding normal anisotropic thermal parameters, therefore 
appear to agree in this case with the SHELXL-2013 
 refinements. A variation of the Hpara model 
(Hpara_2), where a and b were set to zero in Equation 7.3 and, at each temperature, the refinement 
was referred back to the starting Hx0y0z0 in the for_xdds section, was also applied in a surface 
refinement with the refinement of the rigid body rotations and translations (except at 100 K) for 
BZN4-OHBA (Figure 7.20). A similar trend of a slight shift in proton position, that could be 
considered as indicating no migration, was observed for the normal anisotropic and TLS refined 
anisotropic displacement parameters.

The proton migration behaviour for each surface refinement is shown in Figure 7.21. For the Hfree 
models (Figure 7.21(a)i and (b)i), the proton migration behaviour suggested in the normal 
anisotropic and TLS refinement of the anisotropic displacement parameter strongly agree; little 
change in the hydrogen atom position is indicated as a function of temperature. There is also 
strong agreement between the normal anisotropic and TLS refinement models of the anisotropic 
displacement parameter for the Hpara model. The hydrogen atom position appears to shift slightly 
from an off-centre position on one side of the hydrogen bond to an off-centred position on the 
other side of the hydrogen bond; this shift may be within error and can be interpreted as indicating 
that no migration occurs over the temperature range.  
For this continuous approach, the Hpara models appear to give a smoother description of the 
hydrogen transfer behaviour occurring. The lack of proton migration being observed by the 
different refinements in models in Topas-Academic V5.0 
 is in agreement with that suggested 
by the single crystal refinements in SHELXL-2013 
 (Figure 7.19). This continuous temperature 
ramping data collection approach reveals more information about the changing nature of the 
hydrogen atom picture than obtained in the stepwise temperature ramping approach (BZN4-OHBA 
STEP) where points along the temperature profile are missed.

7.4.3 Method assessment 
The application of parametric structure refinement to multi temperature single crystal synchrotron 
X-ray diffraction data in Topas-Academic V5.0 
 has been developed in this research project for 
variable temperature data collected on the molecular complexes of DMU2,4-DNBA and  
BZN4-OHBA.  
In the initial stages of the development of the parametric structure refinement method, a number of 
models were trialled to determine how to achieve method optimisation. This method was found to 
be optimised, in terms of the refinement parameters, in surface refinements in which the molecular 
components are defined as rigid bodies whose rotations and translation may refine over the 
temperature range, except at 100 K, and where anisotropic thermal parameters are employed either 
refined freely with an isotropic scaling (normal anisotropic) or modelled using the TLS approach. 
In particular, the implementation of the TLS model allowed a flattening of the R-factors over the 
temperature range indicating that a reasonable fit of the refined structure to the data is occurring at 
all temperatures compared to the normal anisotropic refinement approach in which the fit was 
significantly poorer at the temperature extremes. The parametric structure refinement method 
could also be optimised in terms of the raw data. Two methods were trialled for the variable 
temperature data collection for molecular complex BZN4-OHBA including a step wise 
temperature ramping approaching (STEP) and a continuous temperature ramping approach 
(CONT.). The CONT. approach allowed a more complete picture of the changes in the hydrogen 
atom position as a function of temperature to be accessed which was missed by the STEP approach 
collecting over larger stepwise 20 K temperature intervals.  
The optimised method gave sensible structural outputs and allowed proton migration behaviour, 
defined by models, to be followed as a function of temperature in both DMU2,4-DNBA and 
BZN4-OHBA STEP and CONT. The proton migration behaviour suggested by the optimised 
models, however, was not always in agreement with that from single crystal refinements in 
SHELXL-2013. 
 This appeared to be heavily related to the model used to drive the hydrogen 
atom position as a function of temperature. For example, in DMU2,4-DNBA it was not possible to 
observe the same proton migration behaviour using the Hfree and Hpara models as found from single 
crystal refinements in SHELXL-2013. 
 In general, at a particular temperature, the hydrogen 
atom position was shifted in the surface refined structures relative to its position in a single 
temperature refinement; the DH distances were longer in the surface refinements. For example, 
the N
H distance was elongated for the 100 K structure from 1.12  in a single temperature 
refinement (in a rigid.inp) to 1.22  in a Hfree surface refinement (1.22 ). It may be that, during 
the surface refinements, an averaging effect occurs on the positions of the hydrogen atom of 
interest across the temperature range. It was possible to observe similar proton migration 
behaviour to that found from the SHELXL-2013 
 refinements for DMU2,4-DNBA when an 
altered version of the Hpara model was used. In this model, at each temperature, the refinement was 
referred back to Hx0y0z0 in the for_xdds section, the 100 K coordinates for the hydrogen atom 
from the CIF. This is in contrast to the Hfree and Hpara models where the hydrogen atom of interest 
is included in each xdd_scr section only and its position may be averaging over the data. In 
general, similar proton migration behaviour was observed between the Hfree and Hpara models and 
the Hpara model gave a smoothing of the trend observed. The difference in the refined hydrogen 
atom behaviour observed between the hydrogen atom models (i.e SHELXL-2013 
 versus Topas-
Academic V5.0) 
 may indicate that, for these systems, it may be beyond the capabilities of the 
available data to constrain the hydrogen atom behaviour to be driven in a certain way (such as by 
the Hpara models which may be pushing it too far).  
The parametric structure refinement method developed in this research project is in the early 
stages of implementation and requires further investigation; the initial results indicate potential for 
its application in these proton migration studies. The TLS description of anisotropic thermal 
parameters, in particular, requires more development where it appears to work for the systems of 
DMU2,4-DNBA and BZN4-OHBA but has not been confirmed as correct by other refinement 
programs. It would therefore be beneficial to explore the TLS implementation further. The choice 
of the model for the variable temperature hydrogen atom behaviour also gives significant variation 
in behaviour observed. It is therefore important in these studies to trial a number different models 
for hydrogen atom behaviour, it may be that one size does not fit all; further investigations into the 
different hydrogen atom behaviour models to implement are required. It would be interesting to 
develop this method further to study the evolution of the hydrogen atom thermal parameter as a 
function of temperature, with a DH distance fixed, or to apply this type of investigation to 
studies of proton disorder, where site occupancies can be refined in Topas-Academic V5.0. 
7.5 Conclusions 
In this chapter, single crystal synchrotron and X-ray diffraction has been applied in the study of 
proton migration across SSHBs. Two structural refinement methods have been applied to follow 
the proton migration behaviour.  
The use of traditional refinement methods in SHELXL-2013 
 allowed temperature dependent 
proton migration to be identified and followed from synchrotron X-ray diffraction data in the 
molecular complexes DMU2,4-DNBA and INP; the extent occurring was comparable to that 
reported in the literature. The synchrotron technique was found to be applicable in the study of 
proton migration behaviour provided consistent trends were observable across all information, 
including good correlation between the refined hydrogen atom positions and Fourier difference 
maps, and that Fourier difference maps were relatively noise free for the reliable determination of 
proton behaviour; aided by the availability of high quality data from this technique. Sample quality 
was also shown to have consequences for the success of the determination of the proton behaviour 
in the Fourier difference maps. These are reflections relevant in all studies of proton transfer and, 
if considered, may aid the success of this technique in future studies.  
The use of the parametric structural refinement technique in Topas-Academic V5.0 
 has been 
trialled in this research project for following proton migration in variable temperature synchrotron 
single crystal X-ray diffraction data. This refinement method offers the potential for increased 
accuracy on parameters and reduction in processing time. Its application to following proton 
migration behaviour was found to be possible with sensible results output; this is promising where 
this is the first implementation of a method of this type to single crystal data. The use of the 
continuous temperature ramping method is also revealed to be worthwhile in these studies. The 
parametric refinement method was found to be improved by continuous temperature ramping 
during data collection allowing hydrogen atom behaviour to be followed continuously along the 
temperature profile; this is a novel method which is recommended in future studies of proton 
transfer. A significant caveat was, however, presented in the use of the parametric refinement 
method in that the proton migration behaviour observed appeared to be highly dependent on the 
model used for the evolving hydrogen atom behaviour. Further development of this method is 
therefore required but these early results indicate its potential in studies of proton transfer; its 
application to additional samples, such as where proton migration has been identified previously 
by single crystal X-ray or neutron diffraction measurements including in urea oxalic acid, 
would be highly beneficial. 
The study of these materials by single crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction has allowed additional 
insight into the observed proton migration behaviour including its tuning by donor-acceptor 
distance or values of pKa. The proposed OHO SSHB donor-acceptor distance limit for 
observing temperature dependent proton migration was suggested to be rigid where no proton 
migration was observed above the 2.45  donor-acceptor distance. For the N
HO
 SSHBs, 
additional insight into the donor-acceptor distance limit for proton migration to be observed was 
revealed to be longer than found previously, cases of proton migration have only been reported for 
HO
 SSHBs with donor-acceptor distances below 2.55 , and potentially in the range of 
2.551(1) and 2.555(1) ; proton migration was indicated across the former SSHB but not the 
latter. The extent of proton migration occurring in these complexes followed the trend of 
increasing migration with less negative pKa for the OHO SSHBs in the substituted urea 
organic acid molecular complexes, supporting that observed by Jones et al. (2012). 
 In contrast, 
for the N
HO
 SSHBs, there did not appear to be a clear trend between the value of pKa and 
the extent of proton migration occurring suggesting trends may only be applicable between similar 
molecular complexes. Details about the potential migration mechanism were also suggested from 
the variable temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies contributing to the understanding of 
why such processes occur in the solid state. 
The study of the tuning effects on the proton migration behaviour aids in the design of this 
property into additional systems, where the number of reported proton migration materials is still 
relatively few; in particular, strategies that target certain donor-acceptor distances or certain pKa 
values between components may be favourable. The synchrotron technique may contribute 
significantly to these studies allowing a greater number of systems to be studied reliably at an 
increased number of temperatures.  
Chapter 8.  
X-ray diffraction and synchrotron studies of proton 
transfer behaviour in molecular complexes of DMAN 
In this chapter, synchrotron and X-ray diffraction is applied in the study of static proton transfer 
behaviour in the molecular complexes of the proton sponge molecule, DMAN (1,8-
bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene), with organic acids. As in the systems studied in Chapter 5 and 
Chapter 6, weak intermolecular interactions are important.  
8.1 Introduction and aims 
In molecular complexes of DMAN with organic acids, proton transfer between components results 
in crystal packing in which a [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment, where X
 is the nearest 
electronegative atom, is formed (1.3.3). The nature of the anion X
 appears to tune features of the 
crystal packing, 
 including the minor component of the fragment comprised of the weak  
CHX
 hydrogen bonds formed between the methyl groups and X
; the transfer behaviour of 
the proton in the major component of the fragment, the intermolecular hydrogen bond (IHB)  
[NHN]
, in turn may be tuned by these weak interactions. 
To further understand the effect of the anion in tuning features of the crystal packing and to 
rationalise the IHB proton transfer behaviour, it is beneficial to identify and study further systems 
in which the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment is formed. A number of molecular complexes of 
DMAN with halo and hydroxy benzoic acids have been identified as containing the  
[Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment by laboratory X-ray diffraction. 
128, 136
 In these complexes, the 
DMAN and benzoic acid components crystallise in a 1:2 ratio. Proton transfer occurs between one 
acid and the DMAN whilst the second acid forms a negatively charged dimer (ACID
) with the 
deprotonated acid via a strong OHO
 charge assisted hydrogen bond (CAHB). The acid dimer 
positions itself above the [NHN]
 IHB, forming the [Me2NHNMe2]
fragment
(Figure 8.1); here X
 is the deprotonated carboxylate oxygen atom.  
Figure 8.1 The interaction of the protonated DMAN (DMANH
) and the charged acid dimer (ACID
In these complexes, the positions of the hydrogen atoms in the DMANH
 IHB and the ACID
dimer hydrogen bond could not be relied upon when determined from the laboratory X-ray 
diffraction data; the Fourier difference maps showed ambiguity in the location of these atoms. 
was therefore not possible to attempt rationalisation of the proton transfer behaviour using this 
technique. Neutron diffraction measurements were carried out by Jones et al. (2016) on several of 
the DMAN complexes, including DMAN with 2-fluoro, 2-iodo and 4-iodobenzoic acids; this 
method enables a precise determination of the hydrogen atom positions alongside the anisotropic 
refinement of hydrogen atom thermal parameters allowing the proton transfer behaviour to be 
accurately determined and thereby rationalised. 
 The proton behaviour in the IHB and the 
 SSHB was found to be effected by combinations of weak interactions in the local 
environment. A correlation was also found between the thermal motion of the IHB proton and X
when in close proximity; indicated by an equivalent movement of the thermal ellipsoids of two 
atoms when the HX
 distances were in the range of 2.61 to 2.81 . 
133, 135
In this chapter, DMAN substituted benzoic acid molecular complexes containing the  
[Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment are studied using a combination of synchrotron and X-ray 
diffraction. The molecular complexes under study include (i) the previously identified DMAN halo 
and hydroxy benzoic acids molecular complexes (co-former set 1) and (ii) new molecular 
complexes of DMAN with a range of substituted benzoic acids (co-former set 2). Across the 
molecular complexes, the effect of anion (X
) variation, by substitution, on features of the crystal 
packing and molecular structure, including in the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment, is 
investigated. Attempts to rationalise the low temperature IHB proton transfer behaviour using the 
X-ray technique are also made; conclusions are compared to those found in the neutron diffraction 
studies. 
In this work, a study of the previously identified molecular complexes of DMAN with halo and 
hydroxy benzoic acids (co-former set 1) 
 has been conducted at a single low temperature (100 
or 150 K) using the technique of synchrotron X-ray diffraction with the aim of improving on the 
previously collected X-ray diffraction data; Fourier difference maps of higher quality are 
obtainable via this method such that more reliable hydrogen atom location and behaviour 
determination can be achieved. The synchrotron technique is first benchmarked for DMAN  
2-iodobenzoic acid (8.3), where the neutron diffraction data is available for comparison at the 
same temperature, 
 and subsequently applied to all those DMAN complexes with halo and 
hydroxy benzoic acids previously identified  (Figure 8.2) (8.4); it was not possible to prepare the 
previously found 2-chloro and 3-chloro benzoic acid analogues.

acid (3-OHBA) and (k) 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-OHBA).  
The new molecular complexes of DMAN with a range of substituted benzoic acids (co-former  
set 2), prepared as part of crystal engineering study into the effect of anion substitution on the 
crystal packing, are also studied via a combination of the synchrotron technique and using 
laboratory X-ray diffraction with measurements conducted at 100 or 150 K. The benzoic acid co-
formers contain a range of electron withdrawing and donating substituents (Figure 8.3). The 
formation of additional complexes in this study allows further understanding of the effect of anion 
substitution on the crystal packing and molecular structure and contributes to the number of 
instances across which the low temperature proton transfer behaviour can be studied.

8.3 A comparative diffraction study of proton transfer behaviour in 
DMAN 2-iodobenzoic acid 
The reliable determination of proton transfer behaviour is important in this study to aid in its 
rationalisation across the DMAN substituted benzoic acid molecular complexes.  
In order to benchmark the technique of synchrotron X-ray diffraction, in these studies of proton 
transfer behaviour, it was first applied to the molecular complex of DMAN2-IBA at 100 K, where 
the neutron diffraction data is available for comparison at the same temperature. 
133, 135
 The focus is 
on the DMANH
 IHB and CAHB ACID
 dimer structural and atomic displacement parameters, 
the observable IHB proton behaviour within the Fourier difference maps and the heavy atom 
parameters of the hydrogen bonding groups. 
8.3.1 Hydrogen bond structural parameters 
A comparison of distances involving hydrogen atoms in the [NHN]
 IHB and CAHB ACID
dimer SSHB for the synchrotron X-ray structure and neutron structure (Table 8.4) indicate that 
there is, in general, a difference in the order of 0.1 ; this is as expected between X-ray and 
neutron determinations. 
 Despite the shift in the proton positions, similar proton location 
behaviour is suggested as, in both cases, the refined proton position appears asymmetric. The 
structural parameters of the groups forming the [NHN]
 IHB and CAHB ACID
 dimer SSHB 
were generally in agreement between the synchrotron and neutron determinations (Table 8.5). In 
each case they supported the asymmetrical location of the protons in the [NHN]
 IHB and 
CAHB ACID
 dimer SSHB; the bond distances of these groups differed in length at either end of 
the interaction. There is a slight variation in the CN bond distances for the synchrotron X-ray 
structure but still indicate the same trend as neutron structure, that the CN is longer for the 
protonated nitrogen atom. 
The thermal parameters of the [NHN]
 IHB differ between the X-ray and neutron structures 
(Figure 8.4); refined isotropically for the X-ray case and anisotropically in the neutron case. The 
anisotropic refinement possible from neutron data means that the direction of movement of a 
hydrogen atom along a hydrogen bond can be indicated in the thermal ellipsoid. In the X-ray case, 
possible motion of a hydrogen atom along the bond may be indicated instead by an enlarged 
isotropic thermal parameter; however, the directionality remains unknown. Despite this difference, 
the same overall trend of a slight movement of the hydrogen atom along the hydrogen bond is 
indicated for DMAN2-IBA by each technique; a slightly enlarged isotropic thermal parameter is 
observed in the X-ray structure for the IHB proton alongside a slightly elongated anisotropic 
thermal parameter in the neutron structure.

8.3.2 DMANH
 IHB Fourier difference maps 
In the Fourier difference maps of the [NHN]
 IHB (Figure 8.5), the density of hydrogen atom 
in the synchrotron X-ray structure indicates an asymmetric hydrogen atom position as in the 
neutron structure and is in support of that indicated by the X-ray refined hydrogen atom position. 
There is, however, slightly different proton behaviour, imaged in the Fourier difference maps, 
suggested for the structure determined using each diffraction method; the shape of the density for 
the proton is different in the maps generated from the X-ray and neutron structures. The density for 
the hydrogen atom is significantly elongated along the IHB in the X-ray structure whilst in the 
neutron structure the density is better defined; this can be related to the bonding density being 
observed in the X-ray Fourier difference map whilst nuclear density is observed in the neutron 
Fourier difference map. This difference is partly a result of the maps from neutron diffraction 
imaging nuclear density whilst those from X-ray diffraction, imaging electron density. There is 
also significant noise in the X-ray Fourier difference map as a consequence of the heavy iodine 
atom being present in the structure, obscuring the observation of the hydrogen atom; this may also 
be a contributing factor to the different proton behaviour being observed between the X-ray and 
neutron Fourier difference maps. The X-ray Fourier difference map, does however, give some 
indication about the direction of motion along the hydrogen bond where the hydrogen atom 
isotropic thermal parameter does not.

8.3.3 Summary 
Similar hydrogen atom positional information as that obtained by neutron diffraction 
133, 135
observed in the synchrotron X-ray hydrogen bond distances, with the well-established 
consideration that the equivalent neutron bond lengths will be longer by ~ 0.1 . This positional 
information is reliable when it is supported by the structural parameters of the groups forming the 
hydrogen bond and the Fourier difference maps, as is the case here. However, there is less 
agreement in the suggested hydrogen atom thermal behaviour between the two techniques; 
synchrotron X-ray diffraction may indicate increased thermal motion but lacking directional 
information. The direction of the hydrogen atom motion may instead be revealed in the 
synchrotron X-ray structures by considering the size of the isotropic thermal parameters alongside 
the shape of the density in the Fourier difference maps. This initial study therefore suggests that 
synchrotron X-ray diffraction may be suitable in studies of proton transfer behaviour on 
considering these points.   
8.4 Synchrotron diffraction study of previously identified DMAN 
benzoic acid molecular complexes 
In this section, synchrotron X-ray diffraction is applied to the previously identified molecular 
complexes of DMAN with halo and hydroxy benzoic acids. 
 The effect of anion (X
) variation, 
by substitution, on features of the crystal packing and molecular structure is investigated and the 
low temperature DMANH
 IHB proton transfer behaviour is studied.  
8.4.1 Anion variation 
In these molecular complexes, anions in the form of substituted ACID
 dimers are present (Figure 
8.6). The change in both the identity of the halo substituent (acidity order F< Cl < I) and its 
position (acidity order ortho > meta/para) alters the electronics of the ACID
 dimer in conjugate 
base form. 
Figure 8.6 The ACID
 anion substitution for BA, 2-FBA, 3-FBA, 4-FBA, 4-ClBA, 2-IBA, 3-IBA, 4-IBA, 3-OHBA and 
4-OHBA.
8.4.2 Crystal packing 
On substituting the anion, there are slight changes in the wider crystal packing, however the same 
inorganic type arrangement is adopted; the packing is built up from layers of pairs of DMANH
cations and pairs of the ACID
 dimers (Figure 8.7). In the majority of the complexes the 
DMANH
 cations are anti-parallel in each pair (Figure 8.8); an exception to this is in  
DMAN4-IBA, where they are parallel. In each pair, varying degrees of overlap of the DMANH
cations occur whilst its packing varies between the complexes. The DMANH
pairs pack in 
pockets in DMAN4-FBA, DMAN4-ClBA, DMAN3-IBA and DMAN2-FBA, in columns in 
DMANBA, DMAN3-OHBA hydrate, DMAN4-OHBA hydrate and in one dimensional chains in 
DMAN3-FBA, DMAN2-IBA, DMAN4-IBA and DMAN4-OHBA. Contacts linking the DMANH
cations include  stacking, methylmethyl contacts and methyl contacts; dependent on the 
extent of eclipsed packing occurring.

(i) DMAN3-OHBA hydrate, (j) DMAN4-OHBA, (k) DMAN4-OHBA hydrate. The DMANH
 cation is shown in blue, 
the ACID
 anion in red and water molecules in green. 
Figure 8.8 Molecular packing of the DMANH
 cations in (a) anti-parallel pairs, (b) in parallel pairs, (c) in columns and 
(d) in chains.  
At the more local level of the crystal packing, the DMANH
 cation and ACID
 dimer anions 
aggregate into the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment (Figure 8.9); the fragment formation is 
robust and unaffected by changes to the anion. Anion variation, in a few cases, alters the motif 
formed by the acid molecules when in the aggregate. In DMAN3-OHBA hydrate and  
DMAN4-OHBA hydrate, the anion unit is not an ACID
 dimer but a single deprotonated acid 
molecule; the deprotonated acid molecules link by interaction between the deprotonated carboxyl 
group and a hydroxyl group in the 3 or 4-position in the next acid. In DMAN4-OHBA hydrate, 
two symmetry independent protonated molecules of DMAN crystallise alongside two 
deprotonated acid molecules (DMAN A) and a molecule of water (DMAN B). The identity of X
remains largely unchanged across the molecular complexes; in most cases X
 is the deprotonated 
carboxyl oxygen atom except for in DMAN4-OHBA hydrate B where a water molecule is inserted 
into the space above the DMANH
 IHB. In DMAN3-OHBA hydrate and DMAN4-OHBA hydrate, 
the arrangement of X
 over the DMANH
 IHB proton is different; two X
 atoms straddle the  
[Me2NHNMe2]
; both from the deprotonated acid.

The [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment minor components 
Aggregation of the DMANH
 cation and ACID
 dimer anion is facilitated via the minor 
component of the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment via weak CHX
 interactions (Table 8.6 
and Table 8.7). In DMAN2-FBA, DMAN4-FBA hydrate, DMAN4-ClBA hydrate and  
DMAN2-IBA minor interactions also form to a halogen atom at the 2-position on the ACID
dimer. In all the molecular complexes, the DMANH
 methyl groups are also involved in contacts 
to other neighbouring X
 in the local environment. The minor CHX
 interactions vary on 
varying the anion; the CX
 interaction length increases with increasing electronegativity of the 
halogen substituent, in the order fluoro, chloro, iodo, whilst the longer CHX
 interactions 
occur where the anion is ortho substituted versus meta or para substituted. In general, the shortest 
or greatest number of the weak CHX
 interactions form to the most protonated N1(CH3)2 
group.

Variation in the bifurcated hydrogen bond parameters occurs across the molecular complexes. The 
HX
 distances vary in length depending on anion substituent; shorter HX
 distances form for 
the least electronegative substituents and where the substituent is meta or para substituted. In 
general, in the [NHN]
 IHB formed in DMANH
 cations, the NH and HN distances are 
related; a short NH leads to a long HN. Therefore, in a bifurcated hydrogen bond, a short 
HX
 separation may be expected to lead to a lengthened NH and therefore an increased NN 
distance. 
 However, there does not appear to be any particular correlation between the distances 
of N1H and HX
 in the complexes here; a short HX
 does not consistently lead to a 
lengthened N1H. There is, however, reasonable correlation between N1N2 and N1H where 
shorter N1H distances occur for longer N1N2 distances; DMAN2-FBA and DMAN2-IBA are 
outliers having N1N2 distances of 2.584(2) and 2.566(3) , respectively, alongside N1H 
distances of 1.31(3) and 1.11(4) , respectively. Other trends are apparent including that X
closest, in general, to the protonated N1 and that the NHX
 angle is larger to the protonated 
nitrogen in the IHB (N1), as observed in the literature. 
 There is also a strong correlation 
between N1X
 and X
H. 
Local environment of DMAN fused rings 
The fused rings of the DMANH
 cation also form interactions with X
 in the local environment 
involving the naphthalene CH groups; the arrangement changing as the anion is varied.  
Weak interactions to neighbouring X
 occur only on the more protonated side of the DMAN in 
complexes DMAN2-FBA, DMAN2-IBA, DMAN4-IBA and DMAN3-FBA (Figure 8.10). These 
are weak CHO hydrogen bonds involving the C2 position and forming a weak CHO 
hydrogen bond to an acid oxygen, in DMAN2-FBA (dCO 3.289(2) ), DMAN2-IBA (dCO 
3.293(2) ) and DMAN4-IBA (dCO 3.188(4) ) and at the C4 position involving an acid oxygen 
in DMAN3-FBA (dCO 3.351(2) ). A weak CHF halogen bond also forms on the protonated 
side at the C3 position in DMAN2-FBA (dCF 3.42(4) ). 
Figure 8.10 Weak interactions to the naphthalene CH groups on the protonated side of the DMANH
 cation in (a) 
DMAN2-FBA, (b) DMAN3-FBA, (c) DMAN2-IBA and (d) DMAN4-IBA.  
In some cases, weak interactions to neighbouring X
form to both sides of the fused rings of the 
DMANH
 cation including in DMANBA, DMAN4-FBA hydrate, DMAN4-ClBA hydrate, 
DMAN3-OHBA hydrate and DMAN4-OHBA hydrate (Figure 8.11). On the protonated side, weak 
CHO hydrogen bonds occur at the C2 position involving an acid oxygen atom in  
DMAN4-FBA (dCO 3.400(3) ), DMAN4-ClBA hydrate (dCO 3.488(2) ), DMAN3-OHBA 
hydrate (dCO 3.251(2) ) and DMAN4-OHBA hydrate (dCO 3.229(2) ). On the non-protonated 
side, weak CHO hydrogen bonds occur at the C6 position in DMAN3-OHBA hydrate (dCO 
3.352(2) ) to a water oxygen, in DMAN4-OHBA (dCO 3.216(2) ) and DMAN4-OHBA 
hydrate B (dCO 3.626(2) ) to a hydroxyl oxygen. In DMAN3-FBA, a weak CHO forms on 
the non-protonated side at the C5 position (dCO 3.430(3) ) to a water oxygen and in  
DMAN4-ClBA hydrate a water bifurcates the C4 and C5 positions forming two CHO 
interactions (dCO 3.505(2) and 3.437(2) , respectively). In DMANBA, an acid oxygen bifurcates 
the C4 and C5 positions forming two CHO interactions (dCO 3.320(2) and 3.398(2) , 
respectively). 
Figure 8.11 Weak interactions to the naphthalene CH groups on both sides of the DMANH
 cation in (a) DMANBA, 
(b) DMAN4-FBA hydrate, (c) DMAN4-ClBA hydrate, (d) DMAN3-OHBA hydrate and (e) DMAN 4-OHBA hydrate B.  
In one case, DMAN4-OHBA hydrate (DMAN A), a weak interaction to a neighbouring X
 forms 
to the non-protonated side of the cation only; a weak CHO hydrogen bond forms to a hydroxyl 
oxygen atom (dCO 3.336(2) ) at the C7 position (Figure 8.12). 
Figure 8.12 Weak interactions to the naphthalene CH groups on the non-protonated side of the DMANH
 cation 
(DMAN A) in DMAN 4-OHBA hydrate.  
Overall, minor interactions between DMANH
 and X
 in the local environment occurs more 
frequently to either the protonated side only or to both the protonated and the non-protonated side 
of the DMANH
 cation.  
8.4.3 Molecular structure  
On anion variation, changes in the molecular structure of the DMAN and ACID
 anion 
components occur. 
[NHN]
 IHB and OHO CAHB 
In the DMANH
 cation in each molecular complex, the proton position varies in the [NHN]
IHB. In the majority of cases, the proton is asymmetrically located (Table 8.9); the proton is 
symmetrically located only in DMAN2-FBA (N1H and HN2 are equivalent in length). The 
proton position in the IHB in DMANBA and DMAN4-OHBA is close to symmetric, being 
positioned just off-centre. The location of the proton in the OHO
 CAHB forming the ACID
dimer anion also varies (Table 8.10), and is found to be asymmetrically located and donated in all 
instances by the acid which does not sit above the DMANH
 cation IHB. In DMAN2-FBA, 
DMAN4-FBA hydrate and DMAN4-ClBA hydrate, the proton sits just off centre in the OHO
CAHB. There does not appear to be any correlation between the location of the proton in the 
DMANH
 cation IHB and the location in the proton in the OHO
 hydrogen bond forming the 
 dimer in the anion. There also does not appear to be any correlation between anion 
substituent and proton position in either hydrogen bond.

Thermal parameters 
The effect of the minor component, and its variation, on the thermal behaviour of the [NHN]
IHB proton may be monitored in Fourier difference maps. In neutron studies, many attempts have 
been made to relate the thermal parameters of a hydrogen atom in a hydrogen bond to the shape of 
the hydrogen bond potential well. 
 In X-rays, where the possibility of refining hydrogen atom 
parameters is more restricted, the shape of the electron density observed directly in a Fourier 
difference map may give some indication of the shape of the potential well and thermal behaviour. 
Differences in the shape of the hydrogen atom density for the IHB proton occur across the 
molecular complexes in the Fourier difference maps (Figure 8.13).  
Figure 8.13 Fourier difference electron density maps showing the electron density associated with the H-atom in the  
 [NHN]
 IHB in (a) DMANBA, (b) DMAN2-FBA, (c) DMAN3-FBA, (d) DMAN4-FBA hydrate, (e) DMAN4-
ClBA hydrate, (f) DMAN2-IBA, (g) DMAN3-IBA, (h) DMAN4-IBA, (i) DMAN3-OHBA hydrate, (j) DMAN4-OHBA, 
(k) DMAN4-OHBA hydrate i DMAN A and ii DMAN B.  
The Fourier difference maps are of reasonable quality from the synchrotron X-ray structure 
determinations such that the determination of hydrogen atom behaviour is possible; in the maps of 
DMAN2-IBA and DMAN4-IBA large amounts of noise are present caused by the heavy iodine 
atom and make the determination more difficult. It should also be noted that the refined hydrogen 
atom position does not coincide with the peak maxima; a shift in the refined position occurs 
relative to the peak maxima which is consistent across the maps.  
Ordered IHB protons are suggested for DMAN3-FBA, DMAN4-IBA and for DMAN4-OHBA 
hydrate DMAN B by a very spherical shape of electron density, suggesting an asymmetric double 
well potential for these hydrogen bonds and low proton thermal motion. This asymmetry supports 
the asymmetry observed in the refined hydrogen atom positions for these molecular complexes. 
Some elongation of the IHB proton density along the IHB occurs for DMAN3-IBA and  
DMAN3-OHBA hydrate whilst this elongation is more significant for DMAN4-ClBA, DMAN2-
IBA and DMAN4-OHBA hydrate DMAN A; increased proton thermal motion is indicated for 
these molecular complexes in an IHB with a more symmetric double well potential. DMANBA, 
DMAN2-FBA and DMAN4-OHBA have symmetrically shaped elongated density at a more 
central position in the IHB, suggestive of a flatter single well potential and greater proton thermal 
motion; the flattest occurs for DMAN2-FBA. This symmetry is in support of the symmetry 
observed in the refined hydrogen atom positions for these molecular complexes. This increased 
thermal motion occurs in DMANBA, DMAN2-FBA and DMAN4-OHBA where the HX
distances are 2.53(2), 2.68(2) and 3.46(2) , respectively; no correlation between extent of proton 
thermal motion and the proximity of the IHB proton and X
 is therefore suggested. The density of 
the IHB proton in DMAN4-FBA hydrate appears as a split peak in the Fourier difference map, 
suggesting the possibility of proton disorder. This behaviour can be described by a double well 
potential with a low barrier to proton transfer. Refining the occupancies of the two proton sites 
results in a 56:44 disorder.  
Significant differences in the shape of the hydrogen atom density for the ACID
 dimer proton 
(Figure 8.14) are observed across the molecular complexes. The ACID
 dimer proton density has a 
spherical shape for DMANBA, DMAN3-IBA, DMAN3-OHBA hydrate, DMAN4-OHBA, and 
DMAN4-OHBA hydrate DMAN A and is suggestive of an ordered proton with low thermal 
motion in an asymmetric OHO hydrogen bond double well potential. This asymmetry 
supports the asymmetry observed in the refined hydrogen atom positions for these molecular 
complexes. In DMAN2-FBA, DMAN2-IBA and DMAN4-IBA, the proton electron density is 
elongated along the hydrogen bond and could indicate a more symmetric double well potential and 
increased proton thermal motion. This symmetry is in support of the symmetry observed in the 
refined hydrogen atom positions for these molecular complexes in the case of DMAN2-FBA and 
DMAN2-IBA but not for DMAN4-IBA; the refined hydrogen atom position may therefore be less 
reliable for this complex. In DMAN2-FBA, DMAN4-FBA hydrate and DMAN4-ClBA hydrate, 
the proton electron density is symmetrically elongated, indicating a flatter single well potential for 
these OHO hydrogen bonds and increased thermal motion. 
Figure 8.14 Fourier difference electron density maps showing the electron density associated with the H-atom in the 
 dimer OHO hydrogen bond in (a) DMANBA, (b) DMAN2-FBA, (c) DMAN3-FBA, (d) DMAN4-FBA

hydrate, (j) DMAN4-OHBA, (k) DMAN4-OHBA hydrate DMAN A.  
In general, hydrogen bonds with a shorter DA distance should give a flatter potential energy 
well. 
 This is the case for the molecular complexes in this section. Increasingly flat single well 
potentials for the [NHN]
 IHB are suggested for DMANBA, DMAN2-FBA and  
DMAN4-OHBA where the IHB NN distances are some of the shortest whilst the most 
asymmetric double well potentials are suggested in DMAN3-FBA, DMAN4-IBA and DMAN4-
OHBA hydrate DMAN B where the IHB NN distances are some of the longest. Proton 
behaviour in hydrogen bonds in these complexes may therefore be more related to hydrogen bond 
donor-acceptor distances than the proximity of the IHB proton and X
. For the ACID
 dimer O
HO hydrogen bond, the flattest potential wells were again suggested where the OO distances 
were the shortest (around 2.45 ), in DMAN2-FBA, DMAN4-FBA hydrate and DMAN4-ClBA 
hydrate.  
In the previous neutron diffraction studies of these molecular complexes, a correlated thermal 
motion of the IHB proton and X
 displacement parameters along the [NHN]
 IHB indicated an 
interaction of the two atoms occurring when in close proximity (dHX- 2.61 to 2.81 ). 
133, 135
 Here, 
only isotropic thermal parameters of the IHB proton can be determined from the synchrotron  
X-ray diffraction studies (Figure 8.15); in this case an enlarged hydrogen atom isotropic thermal 
parameter, relative to those in rest of the structure, can suggest movement along the [NHN]
IHB hydrogen bond. Enlarged IHB proton isotropic thermal parameters are observed for 
DMANBA, DMAN2-FBA, DMAN4-FBA hydrate and DMAN4-ClBA hydrate; in these cases the 
anisotropic thermal parameter of X
 also lies along the IHB suggesting interaction between the two 
atoms. The HX
 distances are correspondingly short (2.53(2), 2.68(2), 2.56(2) and 2.56(2)  
respectively). The correlation suggested in the thermal parameters of H and X
 in DMAN2-FBA is 
in agreement with that observed in the complex at 200 K in the neutron diffraction study. 
133, 135
DMAN4-OHBA hydrate A (Figure 8.15(k)), the thermal parameter of the water oxygen atom lies 
along the hydrogen bond but the IHB proton does not have an enlarged thermal parameter. Despite 
the short HX
 distance of 2.77(2) , interaction is therefore not suggested; this may be due to the 
HX
 having less of a charged attractive component. Smaller IHB proton thermal parameters 
occur where the thermal parameter of X
 does not lie along the bond including in DMAN4-IBA, 
DMAN3-OHBA hydrate, DMAN4-OHBA.

The effect of altering the minor component by changing the anion is also reflected in structural 
changes within components of the ACID
 dimer (Table 8.11) and the DMANH
 cation  
(Table 8.12).  
In the majority of the aggregates, the acid dimer is non-planar; the benzene rings of each acid are 
twisted by 70 to 90  degrees from planarity with one another (Figure 8.16). In DMAN4-FBA 
hydrate and DMAN4-ClBA hydrate the components of the acid dimers are close to being co-
planar, with the benzene rings twisted by 12 to 14  from planarity with one another and the 
carboxylic acid groups flat relative to one another (COOC twist angles of 173.6(2) and 171.2(2)  
respectively). The moieties within the ACID
 dimers are also all relatively planar; the largest twist 
out of planarity of the carboxylic acid group with the benzene ring occurs in DMAN2-FBA, 
DMAN2-IBA and DMAN4-IBA.

Different extents of changes in the structural parameters may be observed on different sides of the 
DMANH
 cation, reflecting the symmetry of the IHB, whilst the changes in the DMANH
structural parameters across the different molecular complexes reflects the effect of changing the 
anion and the minor interactions (Table 8.13 and Table 8.14).  
Across the DMAN molecular complexes, there is a difference in structural parameters due to the 
effect of the proton location and minor interactions with the anion. In the majority of the molecular 
complexes, except for DMAN2-FBA, the refined IHB proton position indicates an asymmetrically 
located proton. There is also a general asymmetry in the equivalent CC bond distances on the 
protonated and non-protonated side of the molecule, in particular between C1C2 and C7C8, and 
between C3C4 and C5C6 (see Figure 1.20 for atom labelling scheme). In DMAN2-FBA, the 
refined hydrogen atom position suggests a proton that is symmetrically located in the IHB and, 
reflecting this, the equivalent CC bond distances on the left and right hand side of the DMAN 
molecule are very similar in length. The CN peri-amino distances are also slightly longer for the 
side on which the proton resides, C1N1, in all the molecular complexes. In DMAN2-FBA, there 
is a slight asymmetry in the two CN lengths suggesting a slight preference for one side of the 
IHB over the other. A larger ipso angle and smaller NCC angle is also observed on the protonated 
side of the DMANH
 for all the molecular complexes in which the refined hydrogen atom 
positions indicate a proton that is asymmetrically located. The CNC angle between the methyl 
groups decreases slightly on protonation and an asymmetry in these values on either side of the 
IHB is also observed in all the molecular complexes. A lesser shortening of C1C2 and C7C8 
occurs for DMAN2-FBA, DMAN3-FBA DMAN3-IBA whilst a greater shortening of C3C4 and 
C5C6 occurs for DMANBA, DMAN4-FBA hydrate and DMAN4-ClBA hydrate. DMANBA and 
DMAN3-FBA have significantly shorter CN distances then the other molecular complexes.

Variation in the bond lengths of the carboxylate groups (CO
, C=O1) and the carboxyl (COH 
and C=O2) groups occurs across the molecular complexes (Table 8.15). These variations may 
reflect the refined hydrogen atom position of the proton in the ACID
 dimer hydrogen bond and be 
a result of being involved in the minor interactions in the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment. 
Between the two acid molecules forming the dimer, the carboxyl bond lengths are most similar to 
those of the carboxylate where the refined hydrogen atom position indicates a proton that is most 
symmetrically located in the ACID
 dimer OHO hydrogen bond and vice versa.

8.5 Synchrotron and X-ray diffraction studies of new DMAN 
substituted benzoic acid molecular complexes 
In this section, synchrotron X-ray diffraction is applied to new DMAN substituted benzoic acid 
molecular complexes. The effect of anion (X
) variation, by substitution, on features of the crystal 
packing and molecular structure is investigated and the low temperature DMANH
 IHB proton 
transfer behaviour is studied. 
Eight previously unknown molecular complexes of DMAN with a selection of substituted benzoic 
acids containing both electron withdrawing and electron donating groups have been prepared 
containing the [Me2NHNMe2]
fragment.  
8.5.1 Anion variation 
The change in both the identity of the substituent and the ring position alters the electronics of the 
conjugate base X
. In this new set of molecular complexes, components were found to crystallise 
in a number of ratios including 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 of the DMAN organic acid components; in these, 
single ACID
 units, ACID
 dimers and trimers (Figure 8.17) are present.  
Figure 8.17 The ACID
 anion substitution for a (a) single ACID
 anion, (b) an ACID
 dimer and (c) an ACID
 trimer 
unit. 
The effect of the anion and minor component on the crystal structure is again of interest in these 
materials particularly where changing the withdrawing or donating nature of the substituent altered 
the identity of X
 in the [Me2NHNMe2]
fragment. The molecular complexes were 
studied using synchrotron X-ray diffraction with the exception of DMAN 4-ABA and  
DMAN4-NBA II which were studied using X-ray diffraction from a laboratory source. 
8.5.2 Crystal packing 
On substituting the anion, there are changes to the wider crystal packing in the 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 
molecular complexes (Figure 8.18). In five of the molecular complexes, the inorganic type 
arrangement where the packing is built up from layers of pairs of DMANH
 cations and pairs of 
the ACID
 anion units is adopted. 
Figure 8.18 Molecular packing in the molecular complexes of (a) DMAN5-NIP, (b) DMAN2-NBA,  
(c) DMAN3-OMBA, (d) DMAN3-ABA, (e) DMAN4-ABA hydrate (f) DMAN2-CBA, (g) DMAN4-CBA, (h) DMAN4-
NBA II. The DMANH
 cation is shown in blue, the ACID
 anion in red and water molecules in green. 
In DMAN2-NBA, DMAN5-NIP, DMAN3-OMBA, DMAN3-ABA and DMAN4-ABA hydrate, 
the DMANH
 cations stack in anti-parallel pairs. These are isolated pairs with the exception of 
DMAN5-NIP and DMAN4-ABA hydrate, which forms columns of interacting DMANH
 cations 
(Figure 8.19(a) and (b)). In DMAN2-CBA, DMAN4-CBA and DMAN4-NBA II, the DMANH
cations adopt the other type of inorganic crystal packing; each cation is surrounded by six ACID
molecules; in DMAN2-CBA and DMAN4-CBA this packing forms chains of DMAN through the 
structure (Figure 8.19(c) and (d)). 
Figure 8.19 Molecular packing of the DMANH
 cations in (a) isolated anti-parallel pairs, (b) anti-parallel in columns, 
(c) and (d) in single chains.  
At the more local level of the crystal packing, the DMANH
 cation and ACID
 anion units 
aggregate into the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment (Figure 8.20 and Figure 8.21); the 
substitution of the anion alters how this aggregation occurs. Where there are electron donating 
substituents on the benzoic acid ring, the aggregation of the DMANH
 cation and ACID
 units 
occurs in a 1:2 ratio and where X
 is the deprotonated oxygen atom, as seen in the complexes in 
8.4. In contrast, where there are electron withdrawing substituents on the benzoic acid ring, the 
aggregation of the DMANH
 cation and ACID
 units occurs in a 1:1 or 1:3 ratio, and the electron 
withdrawing substituents are inserted into the space above the DMANH
 IHB in preference to the 
deprotonated oxygen atom of the carboxylic acid group; one exception to this DMAN2-NBA 
where X
 is the deprotonated oxygen atom. The acid groups forming the dimer and trimer 
hydrogen bonded units do not catenate further. DMAN5-NIP forms a 1:1 aggregate via the 
[Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment, however due the presence of the additional carboxylic acid 
group, continuous hydrogen bonded chains form between the ACID
 molecules.  
Figure 8.20 The aggregation of the DMANH
 cation and ACID
 anion unit in (a) DMAN5-NIP, (b) DMAN2-NBA, 
(c) DMAN3-OMBA, (d) DMAN3-ABA and (e) DMAN4-ABA hydrate i DMAN A, ii DMAN B and iii DMAN C. 
Figure 8.21 The aggregation of the DMANH
 cation and ACID
 anion unit in (a) DMAN2-CBA, (b) DMU4-CBA and 
(c) DMAN4-NBA II i DMAN A, ii DMAN B and iii DMAN C. 
The [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment minor components 
Aggregation of the DMANH
 cation and ACID
 anion units occurs via the minor component of 
the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment via weak CH X
 hydrogen bonds (Table 8.16 to Table 
8.18). X
 is the deprotonated carboxyl oxygen atom in DMAN2-NBA, DMAN3-OMBA, 
DMAN3-ABA and DMAN4-ABA whilst it is the non-carboxylic acid group substituent in 
DMAN5-NIP, DMAN2-CBA, DMAN4-CBA and DMAN4-NBA II. Additional minor interactions 
also form between the [Me2NHNMe2]
 component and neighbouring X
 atoms. In general, 
shorter minor interactions occur where X
 is the carboxylic acid group in contrast to where X
an electron withdrawing substituent. The shortest and greatest number of the weak CHX
interactions form to the most protonated N(CH3)2 group; DMAN2-NBA is the only exception to 
this where the deprotonated oxygen is closest to the non-protonated dimethylamine, however the 
position of the carboxylic acid group overall is over the protonated dimethylamine; a second minor 
interaction forms between the methyl CH and a second acid oxygen.

) of the [Me2N1HN2Me2]
 fragment across the 
molecular complexes. N(CH3)2 group 1 is the most protonated forming the IHB.

Variation in the bifurcated hydrogen bond parameters occurs across the molecular complexes. 
Where the acid group occupies the space above the IHB proton, as in DMAN2-NBA,  
DMAN3-OMBA and DMAN3-ABA, the HX
 interaction distance is shorter; the exception to 
this is in DMAN4-ABA hydrate where the ACID
 dimer lies flat over the IHB. As in the DMAN 
complexes in 8.4, there does not appear to be any particular correlation between the N1H and 
HX
 distances. There is a weak negative correlation between the HX
 distance and the NN 
IHB distance; longer HX
 distances occur where the NN donor-acceptor distance is shorter. 
There is reasonable correlation between N1N2 and N1H distances; shorter N1H distances 
occur for longer N1N2 donor-acceptor distances. Other trends are apparent including that X
closest, in general, to the protonated N1 and that the NHX
 angle is larger to the protonated 
nitrogen in the IHB (N1), as observed in the literature. 
 There is also a strong correlation 
between N1X
 and X

The fused rings of the DMANH
 cation also form interactions with X
 in the local environment 
involving the naphthalene CH groups; the arrangement changing as the anion is varied.  
Weak interactions to neighbouring X
 occur only on the more protonated side of the DMAN in 
complexes DMAN2-CBA, DMAN4-CBA and DMAN4-ABA hydrate DMAN A and DMAN C 
(Figure 8.22). These are weak CHO hydrogen bonds formed between an acid oxygen and a 
DMAN aromatic CH group at the C2 position in DMAN2-CBA (dCO 3.594(3) ) and 
DMAN4-ABA hydrate DMAN C (dCO 3.352(2) ). In DMAN4-ABA hydrate DMAN A, a weak 
CHO hydrogen bonds forms between a water oxygen and a DMAN aromatic CH group at 
the C3 position (dCO 3.650(6) ). In DMAN4-CBA, weak CHN hydrogen bonds form 
between a nitrile group and DMAN aromatic CH groups at the C3 and C4 positions (dCN 
3.450(2) and 3.457(3) ).

 occur to both sides of the DMANH
 cation in DMAN5NIP, 
DMAN2-NBA, DMAN3-ABA, DMAN4-NBA II DMAN A, B and C (Figure 8.23).  
Weak CHO hydrogen bonds form at the C2 position to acid oxygen atoms in DMAN2-NBA 
(dCO 3.383(2) ) and nitro oxygen atoms in DMAN4-NBA II DMAN A (dCO 3.466(2) ), 
DMAN4-NBA II DMAN B (dCO 3.442(2) ) and DMAN4-NBA II DMAN C (dCO 3.472(2) ) 
whilst in DMAN5-NIP, weak CHO hydrogen bonds form at the C3 position to nitro oxygen 
atoms (dCO 3.637(1) ). Additional weak CHO hydrogen bonds also form to nitro oxygen 
atoms on the protonated side in DMAN4-NBA II DMAN A, at the C4 position (dCO 3.503(3) and 
3.375(2) ), and in DMAN4-NBA II B, at the C3 and C4 positions (dCO 3.402(2) and 3.397 (2) 
). On the protonated side in DMAN3-ABA, CHN hydrogen bonds form to a neighbouring 
amine group (dCN 3.413(2) ). On the non-protonated side of the DMANH
 cation, weak C
HO hydrogen bonds form to nitro oxygen atoms in DMAN2-NBA (dCO 3.455(2) ), at the C6 
position, and at the C5 position in DMAN4-NBA II DMAN B (dCO 3.455(2) ) and  
DMAN4-NBA II DMAN C (dCO 3.610(2) ). On the non-protonated side of the DMANH
cation, weak CHO hydrogen bonds form to acid oxygen atoms in DMAN5-NIP (dCO 
3.173(1) ), at the C5 position, in DMAN3-ABA (dCO 3.407(2) and 3.362(2) ), at the C5 and 
C7 position, and in DMAN4-NBA II A (dCO 3.377(2) ) at the C6 position.

The weak interactions to neighbouring X
 occur on the non-protonated side only in in  
DMAN4-ABA hydrate DMAN B at the C7 position to a neighbouring acid oxygen (CHO 
(dCO 3.276(1) ) and in DMAN3-OMBA, the methoxy oxygen atom bifurcates CH groups at 
the C5 and C6 position forming weak CHO hydrogen bonds (dCO 3.258(2) and 3.248(2) ) 
(Figure 8.24).

 cation in

In general, for the minor CH X
 interactions involving the fused rings, the situation where 
interactions occur to either the protonated side only or to both the protonated and the non-
protonated side of the DMANH
 cation is more common than occurring only to the non-protonated 
side only. 
8.5.3 Molecular structure 
[NHN]
 IHB and OHO CAHB 
On anion variation, changes in the molecular structure of the DMAN and ACID
 anion 
components occur. In the majority of the DMAN molecular complexes discussed in this section, 
the refined hydrogen atom positions indicate an IHB proton that is asymmetrically located in the 
IHB (Table 8.20), with the symmetric situation only in DMAN4-ABA hydrate, indicated by 
equivalent distances for N1H and HN2 in DMAN A and B. The refined hydrogen atom 
position is just off-centre in the IHB in DMAN5-NIP and DMAN2-CBA.

The location of the proton in the OHO
 CAHB forming the ACID
 anion unit was also 
recorded (Table 8.21). The refined hydrogen atom positions indicate a proton that is 
asymmetrically located in the OHO
 CAHBs in all the molecular complexes with the 
exception of that interacting with DMAN B in DMAN4-ABA hydrate; the refined hydrogen atom 
position indicates a symmetrically located proton. In DMAN5-NIP, DMAN3-ABA and  
DMAN2-CBA, the OHO
 proton resides on the acid that sits above the DMANH
 cation IHB 
whilst the opposite is true for DMAN3-OMBA, DMAN4-ABA hydrate, DMAN4-CBA and 
DMAN4-NBA II; the proton resides on the acid which does not sit above the DMANH
 cation 
There does not appear to be any link between the location of the proton in the DMANH
 cation 
IHB with the location of the proton in the OHO
 hydrogen bond forming the ACID
 anion 
unit.

Thermal parameters 
The effect of the minor component, and its variation, on the thermal behaviour of the [NHN]
IHB and OHO
 CAHB proton is investigated for this set of molecular complexes in Fourier 
difference maps.  
Differences in the shape of the hydrogen atom density for the [NHN]
 IHB proton occur 
across the molecular complexes in the Fourier difference maps (Figure 8.25).  
Figure 8.25 Fourier difference electron density maps showing the electron density associated with the H-atom in the 
[NHN]
 IHB in (a) DMAN5-NIP, (b) DMAN2-NBA, (c) DMAN3-OMBA, (d) DMAN3-ABA, (e) DMAN4-ABA 
hydrate (i) DMAN A, (ii) DMAN B and (iii) DMAN C, (f) DMAN2-CBA, (g) DMAN4-CBA and (h) DMAN4-NBA II i 
DMAN A, ii DMAN B and iii DMAN C.  
The Fourier difference maps are of reasonable quality from the synchrotron and X-ray structure 
determinations such that the determination of hydrogen atom behaviour is possible in most cases; 
in the maps of DMAN4-ABA hydrate and DMAN4-CBA large amounts of noise are present 
making determination more difficult. It should be noted that the refined hydrogen atom position 
does not coincide with the peak maxima; a shift in the refined position occurs relative to the peak 
maxima which is consistent across the maps.  
Ordered IHB protons are suggested for DMAN2-NBA, DMAN4-NBA II DMAN A and B by a 
spherical shape of proton electron density; the IHBs in these cases are therefore likely to have an 
asymmetric double well potential and low proton thermal motion. This low thermal motion occurs 
where the HX
 distances are 2.61(2), 3.29(4), 3.26(2) and 3.27(3) , respectively. The 
asymmetry is in support of the asymmetry observed in the refined hydrogen atom positions for 
these molecular complexes. Some elongation of the IHB proton density along the interaction 
occurs for DMAN3-OMBA, DMAN3-ABA, DMAN4-CBA and DMAN4-NBA II DMAN C, 
whilst increased thermal motion of the proton is suggested in the Fourier difference map of 
DMAN4-ABA DMAN C. In these complexes, the IHB is more likely to have a more symmetric 
double well potential. This elongation of the IHB proton density in these molecular complexes is 
in support of the lengthened N1H distances indicated by the IHB proton refined hydrogen atom 
position. An ordered proton is indicated by the IHB proton density for DMAN4-ABA hydrate 
DMAN A. However, this density is symmetrically located and is in support of the symmetry 
observed in the refined hydrogen atom positions for this molecular complex. Large thermal 
motions are suggested for the IHB protons in DMAN5-NIP and DMAN4-ABA hydrate DMAN B 
by the smeared peak in the Fourier difference maps; in both cases this is suggestive of a more 
symmetric flat single well potential. This symmetry is in support of the symmetry observed in the 
refined hydrogen atom positions for these molecular complexes. The determination of proton 
behaviour from the Fourier difference map is less reliable for DMAN4-ABA hydrate DMAN B 
where there are significant amounts of noise present. The increased thermal motion occurs in 
DMAN5-NIP and DMAN 4-ABA hydrate DMAN B where the HX
 distances are 3.27(2) and 
3.25(5) , respectively; no correlation between extent of proton thermal motion and the proximity 
of the IHB proton and X
 is therefore suggested. 
Differences in the shape of the hydrogen atom density for the ACID
 unit protons are observed 
across the molecular complexes in the Fourier difference maps (Figure 8.26). The proton electron 
density has a spherical shape and appears to be well localised in almost all of the molecular 
complexes; an asymmetric double well potential is therefore suggested. In DMAN3-ABA, the 
density for the hydrogen atom appears split and is suggestive of proton disorder. Refinement of a 
model with the hydrogen atom split over two sites revealed a 54:46 occupancy of the two 
configurations. In this complex the OHO
 hydrogen bond is likely to have a symmetric double 
well potential with a relatively low barrier to proton transfer. This is in support of the symmetry 
observed in the refined hydrogen atom positions for DMAN3-ABA. The Fourier difference maps 
are extremely noisy for DMAN 4-ABA hydrate making the determination of the hydrogen atom 
behaviour unreliable from these maps.

 anion unit OHO hydrogen bonds in (a) DMAN5-NIP, (b) DMAN3-OMBA, (c) DMAN3-ABA,

There does not appear to be any correlation between the HX
 distance and the thermal behaviour 
of the IHB proton in the Fourier difference maps. There is instead a stronger correlation with the 
IHB DA distance. Hydrogen bonds with a shorter DA distance should give a flatter potential 
energy well, which is reflected in the density corresponding to the hydrogen atom in the hydrogen 
bond. The shortest of the IHB donor-acceptor distances occur for DMAN4-ABA hydrate DMAN 
B (dNN 2.564(5) ), DMAN5-NIP (dNN 2.572(1) ), DMAN4-ABA hydrate DMAN C (dNN 
2.568(5) ) and DMAN4-ABA hydrate DMAN A (dNN 2.568(5) ). In all but DMAN4-ABA 
hydrate DMAN A, a flatter potential well is suggested by the density in the Fourier difference 
maps for the IHB proton. The proton is symmetrically located as might be expected for a short 
hydrogen bond. The thermal motion of the proton decreases as the IHB donor-acceptor distance 
lengthens; the longest IHB donor-acceptor distances occur for DMAN2-NBA (dNN 2.620(1) ) 
and DMAN4-NBA II DMAN A and DMAN B (dNN 2.601(2) and 2.601(2)  respectively) and 
the shape of the proton density in the Fourier difference maps appears more ordered indicating a 
more asymmetric hydrogen bond potential. For the OHO
 interactions, one of the shortest 
donor-acceptor distances occurs in DMAN3-ABA (dOO 2.450(1) ) and, in the Fourier difference 
map of this interaction, the proton density is split over two sites indicating a more symmetric 
double potential well. A similarly short donor-acceptor distance is formed in DMAN4-ABA 
hydrate O1H83O1 (dOO 2.448(4) ), where the proton is again symmetrically located in the 
hydrogen bond. The longer OHO
 interactions have ordered protons and less symmetric 
shapes of the hydrogen bond potential well are suggested by the shape of the proton the density in 
the Fourier difference maps.  
The possibility of correlation between the shape of the anisotropic thermal parameters of X
the isotropic thermal parameter of the IHB proton is investigated for this set of DMAN molecular 
complexes (Figure 8.27). Enlarged IHB proton isotropic thermal parameters are observed for 
DMAN5-NIP, DMAN3-OMBA, DMAN3-ABA and DMAN2-CBA where the anisotropic thermal 
parameter of X
 lies along the IHB. This may suggest interaction between the two atoms. The 
HX
 distances are, however, distinctly varied (3.27(2), 2.55(2), 2.55(2) and 3.30(2)  
respectively). Unlike in the literature, 
 the correlation of the indicated thermal motions of the 
IHB proton and X
 does not occur here as an effect of their proximity.

 anion and DMANH
 cation  
The effect of altering the minor component by changing the anion is also reflected in structural 
changes within components of the ACID
 anion unit (Table 8.22) and the DMANH
 cation  
(Table 8.23).  
In the majority of the complexes, the acids within each unit are non-planar; an exception is in 
DMAN4-ABA hydrate where the molecules in each ACID
 dimer are close to planarity, being 
twisted by 175 to 180  relative to one another (Figure 8.28). DMAN4-ABA hydrate also has the 
most planar benzene rings of the ACID
 anion units (0 to 10  between the rings) whilst the 
benzene rings are significantly non co-planar in the rest of the molecular complexes (twisted by 32 
to 90 ). The moieties within the ACID
 units are also largely relatively planar (
OCCC and 
HOCCC); the largest twist out of co-planarity of the carboxylic acid group with respect to the 
benzene ring occurs in DMAN2-NBA and DMAN2-CBA as a consequence of substituents ortho 
to the carboxylic acid group.

On protonation of DMAN, the arrangement of the peri-amino groups changes from a staggered to 
an eclipsed arrangement. 
 In DMAN-5NIP, DMAN2-NBA, DMAN2-CBA and DMAN4-CBA, 
there is a significant deviation away from the eclipsed arrangement (NCCN torsion angles of

Across the DMAN molecular complexes, differences are observed in a number of structural 
parameters including the CC (Table 8.24) and CN bond lengths and the CCC, NCC and CNC 
angles (Table 8.25). These differences indicate the effect of changes to the minor component as a 
result of changing the anion. Protonation of DMAN leads to a shortening of the C1C2, C3C4, 
C5C6 and C7C8 bond lengths; a greater extent of shortening occurs for DMAN3-OMBA, 
DMAN4-ABA hydrate (DMAN C) and DMAN4-CBA whilst the least shortening of these bonds 
occurs in DMAN5-NIP. There is also a difference in the symmetry of the structural parameters on 
the two sides of each DMANH
 cation in the presence of the different anions; notably in the 
equivalent CC bond distances (see Figure 1.20 for labelling scheme), in particular between  
C1C2 and C7C8, and between C3C4 and C5C6. The C1N1 bond lengths are also longer 
than C8N2. This asymmetry reflects the asymmetry in the refined IHB proton position, evident in 
the majority of the molecular complexes. The most asymmetrically located proton indicated by the 
refined hydrogen atom position occurs in DMAN2-NBA and DMAN4-NBA II, which also show 
the greatest asymmetry in the C1N1 and C8N2 bond lengths. Larger ipso and smaller NCC 
angles and a decrease in the CNC angle between the dimethylamino methyl groups also occurs on 
the protonated side of the DMANH
 cation. In DMAN4-ABA hydrate DMAN A and B, the proton 
is the most symmetrically located. Reflecting this, the CN bond lengths and CCC, NCC and 
CNC angles are the most similar between the two sides of the molecule.

Variation in the bond lengths of the carboxylate (CO
, C=O1) and carboxyl (COH and C=O2) 
groups occurs across the molecular complexes; this may reflect the position of the acid proton in 
the hydrogen bonded units (Table 8.26). Where the proton is most symmetrically located in the  
OHO
 hydrogen bond, the bond lengths of the carboxyl bond group are most similar to those 
of the carboxylate group, and vice versa.

8.6 Consequences of anion variation on the crystal packing 
Variation of the anion has consequences for both the wider and local crystal packing in the DMAN 
molecular complexes studied in this chapter.  
In most cases, the wider crystal packing of the DMANH
 cation and ACID
 anions is unaffected 
by anion substitution; the inorganic packing type occurs where units of each species are built up in 
layers. Changing the anion in DMAN2-CBA, DMAN4-CBA and DMAN4-NBA II leads to a 
different packing; in these complexes each DMANH
 cation is surrounded by six ACID
 anions. 
This difference is likely related to the crystallisation ratio of the components in DMAN2-CBA, 
DMAN4-CBA and DMAN4-NBA II; all crystallised in a 1:3 ratio, where the ACID
 anion is 
present in excess of the DMANH
 cation. In order to accommodate the additional ACID
 anion 
molecules there is a change in packing from pairs of counter ions to a cation surrounded by anions. 
This 1:3 crystallisation ratio occurs for the non-halogen electron withdrawing substituents, 
excluding 5-nitroisophthlalic acid and 2-nitrobenzoic acid. It may be that the wider crystal packing 
can be influenced by DMAN co-former selection.  
The crystallisation ratio also reflects the aggregation of the DMANH
 cation and ACID
 anions 
into the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment which in turn appears to be related to substituent on the 
benzoic acid ring of the anion. In the molecular complexes containing benzoic acids substituted by 
either halogen atoms or electron donating groups, the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment forms 
where X
 is an ACID
 dimer and where either the deprotonated acid or a water molecule, if 
present, occupies the space above the [NHN]
 IHB. In contrast, in the molecular complexes 
containing benzoic acids substituted by electron withdrawing groups, the crystallisation ratio 
changes to either 1:1 or 1:3 and in all but one case (DMAN2-NBA) the electron withdrawing 
substituent occupies the space above the IHB. This suggests that, by substitution of the anion, the 
way the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment forms may be controlled. The exception to this, 
DMAN2-NBA, has the carboxylate group positioned above the IHB where there is no additional 
2-NBA molecule to stabilise its negative charge; the DMAN and 2-NBA components crystallise in 
a 1:1 ratio. If a 1:2 molecular complex of DMAN2-NBA could be accessed, a switch in the 
identity of X
 may occur. In DMAN5-NIP, the components also crystallise in a 1:1 ratio however, 
the nitro substituent group is preferentially positioned above the IHB. In contrast to 2-NBA, 5-NIP 
has a second carboxylic acid group to stabilise the carboxylate group. The literature contains few 
examples of DMAN with substituted benzoic acids with electron withdrawing or donating groups. 
The complex of DMAN with 4,5-dichlorophthalic acid contains the same [Me2NHNMe2]
fragment. 
 In the presence of the halogen substituent, the carboxylate group is positioned over 
the IHB. This agrees with the arrangement observed in the halo benzoic acid complexes in this 
chapter.  
Anion variation also appears to have local packing effects across the molecular complexes in this 
chapter. Within the [Me2NHNMe2]
 assembly, the length of the minor CHX
interactions appears to be tuneable, on changing the anion. In general, where the X
 located above 
the [NHN]
 IHB is from the ACID
 unit, the minor interactions are shorter than those where 
 is an electron withdrawing substituent. This may be a result of the CHX
 interactions being 
formed between more strongly oppositely charged species where X
 is a carboxylate group 
compared to where X
 is an electron withdrawing substituent. A choice between an electron 
withdrawing substituent or an electron donating or halogen substituent may therefore allow the 
length of these interactions to be tuned.  
A change in the length of the minor CHX
 interactions also occurs, for those molecular 
complexes where X
 is the ACID
 carboxylate group, depending on identity and position of the 
benzoic acid ring substituent; these effects are evident in the DMAN halo benzoic acid molecular 
complexes. The length of the minor CHX
 interactions increase with increasing 
electronegativity of the halogen in the order fluoro, chloro, iodo. This effect is due to the more 
electronegative ring substituents forming stronger acids, by the inductive effect, but in turn weaker 
conjugate bases for interaction of the deprotonated acid with the dimethylamino CH groups; this 
means these interactions are longer. The position of the halogen substituent also leads to changes 
in the minor interactions. Carboxylic acid groups with ortho substituents have an increased acidity, 
compared to meta and para substituents, and consequently form weaker conjugate bases. This is 
reflected in the length of the CHX
 interactions formed in the two series of DMAN2-FBA, 
DMAN3-FBA and DMAN4-FBA hydrate and DMAN2-IBA, DMAN3-IBA and DMAN4-IBA. 
The ortho substituted acids (DMAN2-FBA and DMAN2-IBA) form weaker interactions to the 
DMANH
 methylamino groups than the meta (3-position) and para (4-position) substituted 
equivalents. Substitution of an acid at a particular position or by a particular group therefore may 
allow tuning of the minor component.  
The anion also appears to tune the symmetry and the number of the weak minor CHX
interactions formed within the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment across the molecular complexes. 
The symmetry in the arrangement of the CHX
 interactions appears to be affected by the 
identity of X
. For example, in the molecular complexes where X
 is the carboxylate or a cyano 
group, X
 is positioned more centrally over [Me2NHNMe2]
. In contrast, where X
 is a nitro 
group, it is positioned offset and closer to one of the DMAN dimethylamino groups. In the 1:3 
molecular complexes, including DMAN2-CBA, DMAN4-CBA hydrate and DMAN4-NBA II, the 
type of packing adopted where the ACID
 anions pack around the DMANH
 cation leads to an 
increased number of minor CHX
 interactions forming to the local environment; this is usually 
biased to one dimethylamino group over the other. The substitution of the benzoic acids with 
hydrogen bond acceptor groups also leads to an increase in the numbers of minor CHX
interactions occurring. Certain substituents on the anion therefore appear to favour particular 
arrangements and numbers of formation of the minor interactions within the  
 [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment. 
Varying the anion is therefore suggested to have significant packing effects in the DMAN 
molecular complexes. Certain substituents are shown to favour particular crystal packing and tune 
the aggregation within the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment. By selecting certain substituents the 
minor interactions are shown to be tuneable in length, number and also arrangement. This gives 
interesting insight into molecular packing in the solid state and the potential for targeting certain 
crystal packing in these DMAN benzoic acid molecular complexes.  
8.7 Rationalising the proton transfer behaviour 
8.7.1 Symmetry of the DMANH
 cation 
The symmetry of the DMANH
 cation is found to vary over the molecular complexes. Of 
particular interest in this study is the effect of the minor interactions on the [NHN]
 IHB. In 
the nineteen molecular complexes studied in this chapter, the symmetry of the proton in the IHB 
changes from being asymmetrically located, such as in DMAN4-IBA and DMAN4-NBA II, to 
being centrally located in DMAN2-FBA and DMAN4-ABA hydrate DMAN A. In an isolated 
DMANH
 cation, the proton is expected to be symmetrically located; 
 varying positions of the 
IHB proton when the DMANH
 cation is in combination with different anions indicates that 
crystal packing forces play a role in tuning its position.  
The symmetry of the DMANH
 IHB appears to be strongly related to the weak CHX
interactions forming the minor component of [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment. This has been 
suggested previously by Wozniak et al (2003); the weak minor interactions can influence the 
location of the proton in the [NHN]
 as changes in the distribution of these minor 
interactions alter the symmetry of the nitrogen atoms forming the interaction, altering the 
symmetry of the hydrogen bond potential well. In most cases, the IHB proton is located on the 
nitrogen atom whose methyl groups are involved in either the shortest or the greatest number of 
the weak CHX
 interactions; the weak CH X
 interactions of the minor component have a 
tuning effect on proton position. An exception to this is in DMAN2-FBA, where the refined 
hydrogen atom position and IHB Fourier difference map indicate a symmetrically located IHB 
proton and an equal number of minor interactions occur to the dimethylamino groups on each side 
of the IHB, however they are significantly shorter to one side than the other. Similarly in DMAN4-
ABA hydrate DMAN A, the refined hydrogen atom position and IHB Fourier difference map 
indicate a symmetrically located IHB proton but there are a greater number of minor interactions, 
which are also shorter, to the dimethylamino groups on one side of the IHB. In these cases, other 
factors may be contributing including the NN hydrogen bond distance. As noted above, as the 
donor-acceptor distance decreases in a hydrogen bond, the shape of the potential energy surface 
becomes increasingly flat changing from an asymmetric double well to a single well. 
position of proton in the hydrogen bond also becomes increasingly symmetric. In DMAN2-FBA 
and DMAN4-ABA hydrate DMAN A the IHB inter nitrogen distances are 2.584(2) and 2.568(5) 
, respectively. These are short NN distances; the neutral DMAN base has an NN separation 
of 2.80  and the average protonated DMANH
 NN separation is 2.59 . 
 A flat potential well 
is therefore possible, the Fourier difference maps of the IHB for each complex indicate this, and 
may outweigh the influence of the weaker interactions to the dimethylamino groups.  
Within the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment, an interaction between X
 and the IHB proton also 
forms. As found in previous DMAN studies, X
 is closer to the DMAN methyl groups than the 
IHB proton, this means that the weak CH X
  interactions are more significant than the HX
interaction; 
 this is the case in the molecular complexes in this chapter where no correlation 
between IHB proton symmetry and HX
 is indicated but is between IHB proton symmetry and 
the weak C HX
 minor interactions. 
As with the minor interactions involving the dimethylamino groups, the weak CHX
interactions to the fused DMANH
 cation rings appear to be strongly related to the symmetry of 
the IHB, in most cases forming either to the side of the cation on which the IHB proton is located 
or to both sides of the DMANH
 cation. In particular, in DMAN4-OHBA hydrate DMAN A and 
DMAN4-ABA hydrate DMAN B, the DMANH
 proton is positioned just off centre of the IHB 
despite the minor CHX
 interactions involving the dimethylamino groups being biased 
towards the more protonated side of the cation. However, the interactions involving the DMANH
cation fused rings involve the non-protonated side only and are reasonably short (dCO 3.336(1) 
and 3.276(1) ). It may be that the weak interactions to the fused ring on the non-protonated side 
offset the minor interactions involving the dimethylamino groups on the protonated side and cause 
the elongation observed in the NH distance towards the centre of the bond. This illustrates the 
subtle interplay of weak interactions in these molecular complexes. The effect of the minor 
interactions on the symmetry of the DMANH
 cation is also reflected in the bond lengths and 
angles of the cation which are inequivalent on different sides of the molecule when the IHB proton 
is asymmetrically located and vice versa. 
8.7.2 Behaviour of the IHB proton 
Several studies have investigated the effect of the interaction of the IHB proton with X
 on its 
thermal behaviour within the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment. X
 may act as a second acceptor 
to the IHB proton forming a bifurcated NHXN hydrogen bond. No link as yet has been found 
between the NH and HX
 in the bifurcated hydrogen bond, 
 this is also the case in the 
molecular complexes in this chapter; a symmetrically located proton occurs in DMAN2-FBA 
where the HX
 distance is short (2.68(2) ) and in DMAN4ABA hydrate DMAN A where this 
distance is long (3.29(4) ).  
There may yet be a connection between the thermal behaviour of the IHB proton and the nearest 
electronegative atom X
, in agreement with that found by Jones et al. (2016). 
 In the molecular 
complexes in this chapter, enlarged isotropic thermal parameters for the IHB proton are observed 
where the anisotropic thermal parameter of X
 lies along the IHB. This occurs in DMANBA, 
DMAN2-FBA, DMAN4-FBA hydrate, DMAN4-ClBA hydrate, DMAN5-NIP, DMAN3-OMBA, 
DMAN3-ABA, DMAN2-CBA and may suggest interaction. However, unlike in the study by 
Jones et al. (2016), 
 where this similar behaviour in the thermal parameters for the IHB proton 
and X
 occurs where the two atoms are in close proximity (the HX
 distance is in the range of 
2.61 to 2.81 ), this is not the case across the molecular complexes studied in this chapter; the 
similar behaviour of the thermal parameters occurs where the HX
 distances are in a wide range: 
2.53(2), 2.68(2), 2.56(2), 2.56(2). 3.27(2), 2.55(2), 2.55(2) and 3.30(2) , respectively. It is 
therefore difficult to make any definite conclusions about the effect of the length of the HX
interaction on the behaviour of the IHB proton from this study; a greater link is instead observed in 
the thermal parameters. It seems that the minor CHX
 and IHB NN separations are more 
important in determining proton behaviour in these molecular complexes; the minor interactions 
may mitigate against a symmetrically located proton where it might otherwise be expected.   
8.7.3 Behaviour of the ACID
 proton 
The proton in the OHO
 CAHB has differing behaviour across the molecular complexes 
which may also be related to the weak minor interactions. Symmetric and asymmetric protons with 
order or disorder are observed in these bonds. There does not appear to be any link between the 
behaviour of the IHB proton and the ACID
 proton however a link is suggested between the HX
component of the minor interactions and the symmetry of the OHO
 CAHB; a more 
symmetric OHO
 CAHB forms where the HX
 interaction is shorter. For example, in 
DMAN4-NBA II DMAN A, the OH and HO
 distances are 0.97(3) and 1.58(3)  alongside a 
HX
 distance of ca. 3.26(2)  whilst in DMAN4-ClBA hydrate the OH and HO distances 
are 1.19(3) and 1.26(3) , respectively, alongside an HX
 of 2.56(2) . The proton location in 
the OHO
 CAHBs formed in the ACID
 anion units are all asymmetric in the 1:3 DMAN 
molecular complexes whilst there is greater variation in the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes. These  
OHO
 CAHBs are also generally longer in the 1:3 complexes likely due to the carboxylate 
sharing its negative charge over two oxygen atoms such that the charge assisted component is less. 
The HX
 interaction distance therefore appears to have a greater effect on the OHO
than the [NHN]
8.8 Application of synchrotron X-ray diffraction in the study of proton 
transfer behaviour 
As in Chapter 5 to Chapter 7, synchrotron X-ray diffraction is applied in the study of hydrogen 
atoms; here, its potential in the study of static low temperature proton transfer behaviour in the 
presence of weak interactions is explored.  
In general, the data collected using the synchrotron technique is of high quality, shown by low 
errors on the DH and HA hydrogen bond distances ( = 0.02  in some cases) and with a low 
level of noise in the Fourier difference maps. There is also consistency between the refined 
hydrogen atom positions and the position of the density for the hydrogen atoms in the Fourier 
difference maps; the relative shift between the two occurred consistently in the maps across the 
molecular complexes. For some samples, where there is increased noise in the Fourier difference 
maps and higher errors on hydrogen atom bond distances, this may be attributed to lower sample 
quality, the DMAN molecular complexes tended to produce more plate like crystals, or in some 
cases be due to the presence of heavy (e.g. iodine) atoms in the structure which generate additional 
Fourier ripples. There was an improvement, in most cases, in the quality of the Fourier difference 
maps generated from the synchrotron X-ray data in comparison to those generated from the 
laboratory X-ray data 
 (Figure 8.29(a)); where not improved, they were largely unchanged 
(Figure 8.29(b)). There was, however, little change in the uncertainties on the hydrogen atom 
positions between the two techniques; in DMAN2-FBA the IHB NH and HN distances were 
1.31(3) and 1.32(3) , respectively, in the synchrotron structure and 1.30(3) and 1.32(3) , 
respectively, in the laboratory X-ray structure.

 [NHN]
 IHB in (a) DMAN2-FBA and (b) DMAN2-IBA generated from the (i) the laboratory X-ray structure 
and the (ii) synchrotron X-ray structure.  
Synchrotron X-ray diffraction is deployed very effectively in the study of the packing and 
aggregation of the DMANH
 cations and ACID
 anions into the [Me2NHNMe2]
fragment, with rapid, accurate structure solution possible for each complex. The accurate structure 
solution allowed the asymmetry of the [NHN]
 IHB and the OHO
 CAHB to be 
confirmed in the heavy atom parameters; including the CN and CC distances of the DMANH
cation and in the bond distances of the carboxyl and carboxylate groups of the ACID
 anions. The 
subtle changes in the crystal packing, across the molecular complexes as a result of anion 
variation, and its effect on proton behaviour could also be followed with confidence; including in 
the minor CHX
 interactions where the heavy atom distances were the focus. A strong link is 
also suggested between the HX
 and the N1X
 distances in the bifurcated [NHN]
hydrogen bond such that the more reliable heavy atom distances may be used to infer the HX
interaction distance in future.  
In this study, using X-rays, only the isotropic refinement of the hydrogen atom thermal parameters 
is possible; the potential of the interaction between H and X
 can be less clearly observed than in 
neutrons where hydrogen atom parameters may be refined anisotropically. It was therefore more 
difficult to determine when H and X
 were interacting on observation of the thermal parameters of 
the two atoms; this is exemplified in the comparative diffraction study in 8.3. However, there was 
some correlation between the size of the isotropic thermal parameter and the behaviour of the 
thermal parameter of X
; an enlarged isotropic thermal parameter is observed when the thermal 
parameter of X
 lies along the [NHN]
 IHB. This may be a useful indication of interaction 
between H and X
 in future X-ray studies.  
Fourier difference maps give a good indication of the nature of the IHB potential, and here it was 
hoped that the synchrotron data may have given advantages. The expected shift of the position of 
the hydrogen atom for the X-ray structure relative to the neutron structure is observed reliably in 
both the Fourier difference maps and hydrogen atom bond lengths, and these maps have given 
consistent indication of elongation of hydrogen atom density that indicated freedom of movement 
along some of the SSHBs, for example. An increased amount of noise is present in some of the  
X-ray maps, however, which means that some of these findings must be treated with a degree of 
caution.  
One of the main advantages of the use of the synchrotron technique is that it has allowed the study 
of a large number of these molecular complexes increasing the set over which the anion effects 
and low temperature proton transfer behaviour, and the associated hydrogen atom parameters and 
electron density, are studied. This allows a significant contribution to the understanding of crystal 
packing effects on molecular structure and proton behaviour.  
8.9 Conclusions 
In this chapter, the effect of anion variation on both the wider and finer details of the crystal 
structure have been investigated in existing and new molecular complexes of DMAN using a 
combination of synchrotron and X-ray diffraction. Attempts to rationalise the low temperature IHB 
proton transfer behaviour have also been made.  
Across the molecular complexes, variation of the anion led to changes in the wider crystal packing. 
The formation of the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment was, however, shown to be robust on 
anion substitution forming in all molecular complexes as a result of proton transfer between 
DMAN and the organic acids; aiding in the predictability of the outcome on the combination of 
these molecular components. The variation of the anion instead affected components within the 
[Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment. It was shown that the identity of X
 could potentially be 
predicted or tuned based on the electronic characteristics of the substituted benzoic acid; electron 
donating or halogen substituents led to one [Me2NHNMe2]
 arrangement whilst electron 
withdrawing substituents tended to lead to another. These electronic characteristics also appeared 
to influence crystallisation ratio of components forming the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment; 
only 1:2 molecular complexes were formed for the electron donating and halobenzoic acid 
substituents. In the minor component of the [Me2NHNMe2]
 fragment, the CHX
interactions involving the dimethylamine CH and nearest electronegative atom X
 were also 
suggested to be tuneable, in terms of length and arrangement, via changes to the identity of X
consequence of varying the anion; this selection includes variation of electronics by nature and the 
ring position of the benzoic acid substituent. This knowledge is useful in the design of future 
DMAN molecular complexes where control of the composition of the [Me2NHNMe2]
fragment is desired; in terms of identity of X
 and the length of the minor interactions forming it. 
This is also a good example of ways to achieve more subtle structural variations in a crystal.  
In agreement with that seen elsewhere, 
130, 131
 the crystal packing appeared to influence proton 
behaviour with a subtle balance of effects occurring. The minor interactions were suggested to 
cause localisation of the [NHN]
 IHB proton whilst the thermal behaviour of the proton within 
the IHB appeared to be related more to the NN separation of the IHB than the proximity of the 
anion; this is in contrast to the previous neutron diffraction study by Jones et al. (2016) on several 
of these materials where an effect on the IHB proton thermal behaviour was indicated in the HX
distance range of 2.61 to 2.81 . 
 This lack of agreement may highlight limitations of the 
synchrotron technique in accurately determining the HX
 distances. However, there did appear 
to be a similar link between the thermal behaviour of the IHB proton and that of the X
 anion, 
suggesting interaction; enlarged isotropic thermal parameters are observed when the thermal 
parameter of X
 lies along the IHB.  
This study aids in trying to rationalise the proton behaviour occurring in protonated DMAN 
systems. The influence of weak interactions on crystal structure has been shown, by which 
interactions to one part of the molecule cause structural perturbations at another. By taking these 
effects into account, it may be possible to achieve control over structure and proton transfer 
properties in future. The use of the synchrotron technique in these studies allowed data of good 
quality to be obtained, reflected in clean Fourier difference maps, from which hydrogen atom 
behaviour and position could be reliably determined across the molecular complexes. Again, the 
Fourier difference maps were shown to be important for the determination of the hydrogen atom 
thermal behaviour whilst heavy atom parameters allowed greater confidence in the refined 
hydrogen atom positions. This allowed the rationalisation of the proton behaviour in the crystal 
packing using the synchrotron X-ray technique. To draw more definitive conclusions, 
complementary neutron diffraction studies would be beneficial in these studies. The high 
throughput nature of the synchrotron technique also allowed the number of existing DMAN 
organic acid systems to be increased facilitating the study of the nineteen complexes in this 
chapter, adding further insight to the role of weak interactions in structure control, particularly in 
proton dynamics, and how these interactions may be controlled or changed by subtle changes to 
the anion.  
This is the fourth study presented in this thesis applying the synchrotron technique in different 
aspects of the study of hydrogen atoms, and their behaviour.  
Chapter 9.  
Crystal engineering urea organic acid hydrogen bonded 
networks with solvent inclusion properties  
In Chapter 6, the carboxylic acid:amide 2
2 hydrogen bond synthon was shown to be robust for 
SSHB formation between substituted urea and benzene carboxylic acid molecular components. In 
this chapter, it is explored alongside additional synthons in the design of substituted urea organic 
acid hydrogen bonded networks with solvent inclusion properties. The work in this chapter has 
arisen from the investigations in Chapter 6. 
9.1 Introduction and aims 
Inclusion materials (1.2.3) have guest hosting properties as a result of molecular packing. They 
are often targeted in crystal engineering because of their potential applications in 
pharmaceutics, 
 chemical sensing, 
 in the separation of alkanes 
 and in the capture of 
volatile organic compounds (VOCs). 
The predictable design of materials with inclusion behaviour in the solid state is difficult, 
requiring the formation of crystalline solids in which molecules do not efficiently fill 
space. 
 A number of factors may influence their formation including host component 
molecular size 
 and guest size and shape. 
 A number of inclusion materials have been 
reported based on hydrogen bonded networks 
305-307
 where particular hydrogen bonding 
synthons assemble to build up the host structure. 
308-310
 In these materials, the number, type 
and geometry of the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups of the host molecular building 
blocks influences the nature of the hydrogen bonded networks formed.  
The two building blocks utilised in the synthesis of solvent inclusion compounds in this 
chapter are based on the urea and polycarboxylic acid core, each of which offer flexibility 
in hydrogen bonding functionality through various substitutions. Urea and substituted ureas 
have the potential to interact with a number of different co-formers via their different 
functional groups; interaction through the amide functionality facilitates urea-urea 
interactions, to form hexagonal channels around linear guests in urea inclusion 
compounds, 
72, 311
 and with carboxylic acids enables urea-carboxylic acid interactions, via 
the carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bonding synthon; three hydrogen bonding motifs 
(U:Ac, U:Ac:U or Ac:U:Ac) (1.2.1), 
 leading to hydrogen bonded chains in molecular 
complexes of substituted ureas and di-carboxylic acids, have previously been reported. 
38, 113
It is also of relevance here to note that amine groups can form extended hydrogen bond 
networks with nitro group functionalities; for example in co-crystals of 3,5-dinitrobenzoic 
acid and 4-aminobenzoic acid, the nitro groups link to an amine group in the next molecule via 
bifurcated 2
1(4) and 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthons. 
36, 45
 Polycarboxylic acids may form extended 
hydrogen bonded networks via carboxylic acid 2
2(8) hydrogen bonded dimer synthons such as 
in trimesic acid which has a honeycomb structure around coronene guest molecules; 
network extension in two or three dimensions and directions may occur related to 
arrangement of the carboxylic acid groups. 
In this chapter, molecular building blocks of substituted ureas are combined with  
5-nitroisophthalic acid in the design of hydrogen bonded networks with solvent-guest inclusion 
properties. Molecular recognition of substituted urea and 5-nitroisophthalic acid molecular 
building blocks, into extended networks, is possible via carboxylic acid 2
2(8) homo dimers, 
carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) and 2
1(6) hydrogen bond synthons, amide:amide 2
2(8) homo dimers, 
nitro:amide 1
2(4), 2
1(6) and 2
2(8) hydrogen bonded synthons (Figure 9.1).

A systematic study of four substituted ureas with 5-nitroisophthalic acid in the presence of eight 
laboratory solvent molecules is carried out (Figure 9.2). A range of substituted urea molecular 
building blocks are investigated to determine the effect of different substituents, including altering 
the number of donor-acceptor sites available for hydrogen bond synthon formation, on inclusion 
network generation. Where hydrogen bonded networks with solvent guest inclusion properties 
have been synthesised, their thermal stability is studied; these are included in a recent  
publication.

9.3 Molecular complexes of substituted ureas with 5-nitroisophthalic 
In the design of hydrogen bonded networks with solvent guest inclusion properties from 
substituted ureas and 5-nitroisophthalic acid molecular components in the presence of a range of 
laboratory solvents, fourteen molecular complexes have been prepared. Nine of the fourteen can be 
considered solvent inclusion materials whilst five are non-solvated. Only the combination of  
N-phenylurea with 5-nitroisophthalic acid led to hydrogen bonded networks with solvent inclusion 
properties.  
9.3.1 Inclusion materials of N-phenylurea 5-nitroisophthalic acid  
Nine hydrogen bonded networks with solvent inclusion properties have been prepared from the 
combination of molecular building blocks N-phenylurea and 5-nitroisophthalic acid (Table 9.3). 
IM1-IM7 are inclusion materials (IM), while CIM1 and CIM2 are classed here as condensed 
inclusion materials (CIM).

Host Framework 
In inclusion materials IM1  IM7, N-phenylurea and 5-nitroisophthalic acid molecules assemble 
into hydrogen bonded ring host networks around solvent guest molecules (Figure 9.3 (a) to (g)). 
The hydrogen bonded ring networks are comprised of eight molecular building blocks in IM1 to 
IM6 and in each case molecular assembly is via four carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond 
synthons, in both U:Ac and U:Ac:U hydrogen bonded motifs, and via two carboxylic acid:amide 
1(6) and two nitro:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthons. In contrast, six molecular building 
blocks form the hydrogen bonded ring in IM7 and molecular assembly occurs via two carboxylic 
acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthons, in a U:Ac motif, and via two nitro:amide 2
hydrogen bond synthons and two carboxylic acid dimer 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthons. 
Condensed hydrogen bonded networks form in CIM1 and CIM2 (Figure 9.3 (h) and (i)), each 
containing different portions of the ring networks present in IM1  IM6; carboxylic acid:amide 
2(8) hydrogen bond synthons, in a U:Ac motif, form in both complexes alongside a nitro:amide 
2(8) hydrogen bond synthon in CIM1 and a carboxylic acid:amide 2
1(6) synthon in CIM2. Ring 
formation does not occur in CIM1 and CIM2, where there is a 1:1 stoichiometry of the host 
components such that no U:Ac:U motifs form and where solvent molecules hydrogen bond to the 
second 5-nitroisophthalic acid carboxylic acid group.  
In these hydrogen bonded networks, the phenyl and urea moieties of the N-phenylurea molecular 
building blocks experience varying degrees of molecular distortion. These are most significant for 
N-phenylurea occurring in the angles between the urea and phenyl moiety planes; variation occurs 
across the IMs and within the same crystal structure. In general, the co-planarity of the phenyl and 
urea moieties is increased in the IMs compared to the native crystal structure; angles between the 
plane of the two moieties range from ca. 0 to 35  in IM1  IM7 versus ca.  48  in the native 
crystal structure, CSD Refcode PHUREA01. 
 The N-phenylurea molecular building blocks have 
the most co-planar phenyl and urea moieties in IM4 (angles between moiety planes are 3 to 6 ) 
whilst in CIM1 and IM5, the moieties of the N-phenylurea molecular building blocks are the least 
co-planar (angle between moiety planes are 33 and 35 , respectively). Variations in the co-
planarity of the phenyl and urea moieties also occur within the same molecular complex; the co-
planarity is most similar in IM4 (angles between moiety planes are 3 to 6 ) and IM6 (6 to 14 ). 
For the IMs with hydrogen bonded ring networks, there does not appear to be any link between 
position in the ring, or hydrogen bond synthon involvement, and the angles between the moiety 
planes within N-phenylurea. The variation in the torsion angles of the 5-nitroisophthalic acid 
carboxylic acid groups with the benzene ring across the IMs is only small in comparison (OCCC 
torsions in the range of 0 to 12 ) covering a slightly wider range than in the native crystal 
structure, CSD Refcode COFDUW10 (OCCC torsions in the range of 2 to 6 ). 
 The largest 
twist of a 5-nitroisophthalic acid carboxylic acid group out of planarity of the benzene occurs in 
IM4 (OCCC torsion 11.6(9) ) whilst the smallest occurs in IM1 (OCCC torsions in the range of 
0 to 3.5(4) ) and IM2 (OCCC torsions in the range of 0 to 2(1) ).

(h) CIM1 and (i) CIM2.  
At first glance, the host ring networks in IM1  IM5 appear isostructural, having the same 
graphset notation 8
8(42). However, the arrangement of the hydrogen bond synthons in space and 
the orientation of the molecular building blocks differ (Figure 9.4).

and IM4, (b) IM3, (c) IM5. 
The hydrogen bonded network in IM6 contains the same number of each hydrogen bond synthon 
as in IM1 to IM5 but has an expanded ring structure with a different graphset notation of 8
8(40). 
In IM7, a different combination of synthons to IM1  IM6, is present and the overall hydrogen 
bonding network is altered, with graphset notation 6
6(36). Similar hydrogen bond lengths in the 
hydrogen bonded synthons of the ring network are observed for the IMs (Table 9.4 to Table 9.7).

The hydrogen bonded ring networks in IM1 to IM7 have an elongated ellipsoid shape (Figure 9.5 
and Table 9.8). The longest dimension of the hydrogen bonded ring in each inclusion material is 
ca. 12  in IM1  IM5 and 15  in IM6 and IM7, where the ring networks are expanded. These 
dimensions are comparable to those for the inclusion materials of trimesic acid (14 ), if there is 
no pore interpenetration, 
 2,4,6-tris-(4-bromophenoxy)-1,3,5-triazine (BrPOT) (12 ) 
 and in 
some zeolites.

Guest inclusion 
Guests (G) are included in the centre of the hydrogen bonded ring in each IM and in the close 
packed space in the CIMs. The host:guest ratios are presented in Table 9.9. In IM1, IM3, IM6, 
CIM1 and CIM2, a single type of guest species is included in the host structure. In contrast, in 
IM4, IM5 and IM7, two types of guest species are included; in IM4 and IM5 a volatile solvent 
and a water molecule are included whilst in IM7 a disordered THF and methanol molecule are 
included. In IM7, the guest is disordered over an inversion centre making its determination more 
difficult. Crystallisation was carried out from methanol and THF solvent whilst the electron 
density in the asymmetric unit resembled that of half a THF alongside an additional solvent 
molecule. To aid in the guest identification, Squeeze, 
 within the WinGX package, 
carried out on the host structure without the solvent modelled. The residual electron count per unit 
cell was 49. It is likely a THF molecule is present (an electron count of 40) alongside an additional 
guest which may be a molecule of water (electron count of 10) or methanol (electron count of 18). 
The identity of this guest is investigated further in 9.4.2.

Guest inclusion occurs in IM1  IM6, CIM1 and CIM2 by tethering to a carboxylic acid hydroxyl 
group of the host, via an OHO or OHN hydrogen bond, that is not involved in formation 
of the hydrogen bonded host network; the hydroxyl group interacts with an oxygen or nitrogen 
atom on the solvent guest. Similar tethering of the guest to the host framework via hydrogen 
bonding interactions has been reported in other inclusion materials including in an orthogonal 
bis(resorcinol)-anthracene compound, 
 in an AL-MIL-53 metal organic framework 
 and in the 
1,1-binaphthyl-2,2-dicarboxylic acid clathrate with DMF. 
 Guest-guest interactions have also 
been reported. 
 In contrast, in IM7, the hydrogen bonding capacity of the host building blocks is 
satisfied in network formation and there is no carboxylic acid hydroxyl group to which the guest 
can tether; this may account for the disordered nature of the solvent. Instead, the guest species are 
held in place by -interactions to host rings in the layers above and below  
 (d 3.220(5)  3.316(8) ).  
In IM1, two types of guest inclusion occur (Figure 9.3 (a) i and ii). In one host ring, a methanol 
guest is tethered to the host by interaction to the carboxylic acid hydroxyl group. In the second 
host ring, a molecule of N-phenylurea hydrogen bonds instead to the carboxylic acid hydroxyl 
group, through an OHO hydrogen bond, and the methanol guest interacts with the host 
through an OHO hydrogen bond to a carbonyl oxygen in an carboxylic acid:amide synthon. In 
IM4 and IM5, water tethers to the host framework by interacting with the carboxylic acid 
hydroxyl group and the second solvent molecule is held in place by a guest-guest OHO 
hydrogen bond to the water. Additional interactions hold the water guest species in place in CIM1; 
one water hydrogen bonds to a second carboxylic acid group, this time to the carbonyl oxygen, 
whilst the other water molecule is held in place by an additional interaction to a nitro group and a 
urea carbonyl in neighbouring 5-nitroisophthalic acid and N-phenylurea molecules, respectively. 
Guest-guest interactions also occur between the two water molecules. The host-guest and guest-
guest interaction distances in all the IMs and CIMs are presented in Table 9.10.

In addition to the tethering of each guest species to the ring network, via interaction with a host 
hydroxyl group, secondary interactions occur as the host components pack around the guest 
forming the solvated pockets or channels. In IM1, in the hydrogen bonded ring where the 
methanol guest interacts with the host hydroxyl tether group, the methanol guest also forms several 
hydrogen bonding interactions to N-phenylurea molecules in the surrounding framework including 
an NHO (dNO 3.119(3) ) and an OHO (dOO 2.802(3) ) hydrogen bond and a weaker 
CHO (dCO 3.444(6) ) hydrogen bond. In the other hydrogen bonded ring, where an N-
phenylurea molecule interacts with the host hydroxyl tether group, the second methanol guest is 
held in the host structure via two NHO hydrogen bonds (dNO 2.919(3) and 3.171(3) ) to the 
tethered N-phenylurea molecule in the middle of the ring and a weak CHO hydrogen bond to a 
5-nitroisophthalic acid molecule (dCO 3.290(3) ) host molecule. In IM2, the ethanol guest is 
further held within the hydrogen bonded ring via OHO and CHO hydrogen bonds to a  
5-nitroisophthalic acid host molecule (dOO 2.555(2)  and dCO 3.49(2), 3.58(2) ). The water 
molecules do not form additional interactions to the host framework. In IM3, the acetonitrile guest 
is packed in the host framework via - interactions and weak CHO hydrogen bonds to a 
carboxylic acid group in the layer below (d 3.099(2) and dCO 3.199(2) ). In IM4, the water 
guest species tethered to the host hydroxyl group also interacts with an N-phenylurea molecule of 
the host via an NHO hydrogen bond (dNO 3.202(6) ) and with a 5-nitroisophthalic acid 
molecule in the layer above via an OHO hydrogen bond (dOO 2.853(8) ). The pairs of 
acetone guests in each pocket interact via weak CHHC (dCC 3.71(1) ) interactions. There 
are no host-guest interactions involving the acetone solvent, only guest-guest interactions. In IM5, 
the water guest species tethered to the host hydroxyl group also interacts with an N-phenylurea 
molecule in the ring above via an OHO hydrogen bond (dOO 2.867(2) ). The THF guest is 
located below the hydrogen bonded ring layer and interacts with the host framework through a 
weak CHO hydrogen bond (dCO 3.391(5) ) to a 5-nitroisophthalic acid host oxygen atom. 
Pairs of THF molecules in each pocket also interact via weak CHHC contacts (dCC 
3.809(6) ). Additional interactions holding the guest species in place in IM6 include - 
interaction between an ethyl acetate oxygen and a 5-nitrosiophthalic acid molecule (d 3.214(3) 
) and in IM7 include - interactions between the guest and 5-nitroisopthalic acid molecules 
(d 3.185(5) to 3.351(5) ). There are no additional interactions holding the water guest in place 
in CIM1. In CIM2, the guest is additionally held in place by an NHO hydrogen bond to an  
N-phenylurea molecule and several CHO weak interactions to a 5-nitroisophthalic acid 
molecule (dNO 3.069(1)  and dCO 3.432(2)  3.567(2) ).  
The hydrogen bonded rings in IM1  IM7 form one-dimentionsal chains that pack in layers 
through the crystal structure. In IM1, IM3, IM4 and IM5, pairs of rings stack on top of one 
another in opposite orientations creating pockets of guests; this arrangement is characteristic of 
inclusion clathrates (Figure 9.6). In IM1 and IM3, the pair wise packing of hydrogen bonded rings 
means two molecules of guest are present per pocket. The guest molecule is also co-planar with 
the hydrogen bonded ring layer. In contrast, in IM4 and IM5, four molecules of solvent are 
present per pocket as two types of guest are included per ring (volatile solvent and water 
molecule); only the water molecules are co-planar with the hydrogen bonded ring layer whilst the 
volatile solvents sit in the space between the layers. In IM2, IM6 and IM7, hydrogen bonded rings 
stack continuously on top of one another, creating channels; this is characteristic of inclusion 
compounds (Figure 9.7). In IM2, the layers are not planar but have a wave like structure and, in 
the case of IM6 and IM7, the hydrogen bonded rings are stacked offset from one another and the 
guest channel runs diagonally through the structure. In CIM1 and CIM2, the hydrogen bonded 
networks extend in two-dimensions generating layers, within which the guests occupy pockets, in 
pairs (Figure 9.6).

calculation in Mercury 
 used a contact surface with parameters of a 1.2  probe radius and 0.7  
grid spacing (Table 9.11). Small void volumes were indicated in CIM1 (< 14 
 per unit cell), 
whilst the largest void volume was present in CIM2 (~336 
 per unit cell). CIM2 was also 
shown to be the least dense empty framework whilst IM1 was the most dense.

In IM1, IM3 and IM5, parts of the host framework occupy the space between the stacked layers. 
In IM1, an N-phenylurea molecular building block is oriented almost perpendicular to the 
hydrogen bonded ring plane, by 82 , and in IM3 and IM5, a phenyl ring bends into the interlayer 
space, out of co-planarity of the layers by 29.84  and 25.82 , respectively. The layers of 
hydrogen bonded ring networks, in each IM, pack via - stacking interactions between the phenyl 
rings of both the N-phenylurea and 5-nitroisophthalic acid and between phenyl rings and lone pair 
density on the nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the intermolecular building blocks. A range of 
interlayer spacings occur for the different inclusion materials (Table 9.12). The shortest 
interactions form in CIM2, where the hydrogen bonded ring motif is not present. The closest 
packing of layers where the hydrogen bonded ring motif is present occurs in IM3 whereas the 
most spaced layers are in IM5; likely a consequence of the large THF molecules positioned in the 
interlayer spacing.

ratio of components and in space group 1, and NS2, in a 1:1 ratio of components and in space 
group P21/c (Figure 9.8). NS1 has a structurally similar hydrogen bonded ring network to that 
formed in IM1 to IM5, comprised of four carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthons, 
in both U:Ac and U:Ac:U hydrogen bonded motifs, and two carboxylic acid:amide 2
1(6) and two 
nitro:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthons.  
Figure 9.8 Hydrogen bonding networks in non-solvated N-phenylurea 5-nitroisophthalic acid (a) NS1 and (b) NS2. 
In contrast to IM1 to IM5, in NS1, an N-phenylurea molecule sits in place of the guest in the 
centre of the hydrogen bonded ring network and an additional carboxylic acid:amide 2
hydrogen bond synthon is formed. NS2 has a very different structure to all other complexes 
discussed here. A single carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthon is formed, in a U:Ac 
motif, alongside a nitro:amide 2
1(6) hydrogen bond synthon and a single OHO interaction, 
formed between symmetry independent 5-nitroisophthalic acid molecules and involving a 
carboxylic acid hydroxyl group of one and a carbonyl oxygen atom of the other. A weak CHO 
hydrogen bond between the nitro group and an N-phenylurea aromatic CH group (dCO 3.402(3) 
) also forms. The hydrogen bonding interactions in NS1 and NS2 are listed in Table 9.13 and 
Table 9.14, respectively.

The hydrogen bonded networks in NS1 and NS2 extend in one dimension forming a hydrogen 
bonded chain. Infinite numbers of these hydrogen bonded chains interconnect through weak  
CHO interactions into two dimensional sheets (NS1 dCO 3.374(2) and 3.442(2) , NS2 dCO 
3.446(3) and 3.506(3) ). Packing of the hydrogen bonded sheets in NS1 and NS2 occurs in layers 
(Figure 9.9) where each layer is oppositely oriented to the next. - stacking interactions form 
connections between the layers (NS1 d 3.311(4) to 3.367(3)  and NS2 d 2.974(4) to 
3.330(4) ). The N-phenylurea molecule occupying the centre of the hydrogen bonded ring in NS1 
is twisted relative to the hydrogen bonded ring network, out of co-planarity by 21 , packing 
diagonally across the ring layers.

9.3.3 Non-solvated substituted urea 5-nitroisophthalic acid molecular complexes  
Three non-solvated molecular complexes of urea 5-nitroisophthalic acid (U5-NIP), N-methylurea 
5-nitroisophthalic acid (MU5-NIP) and N,N-dimethylurea 5-nitroisophthalic acid (DMU5-NIP) 
have also been prepared. U5-NIP and DMU5-NIP are 4:1 and 2:1 complexes of the substituted 
urea and 5-nitroisophthalic acid molecular components, respectively, formed in space group 1. 
MU5-NIP is a 2:1 complex formed in space group P21/n. In these molecular complexes, 
substituted urea and 5-nitroisophthalic acid molecules assemble into hydrogen bonding networks 
(Figure 9.10). Unlike the IMs of N-phenylurea and 5-nitroisophthalic acid, these do not have 
solvent inclusion behaviour.  
Figure 9.10 Hydrogen bonded networks formed in (a) U5-NIP, (b) MU5-NIP and (c) DMU5-NIP. 
In U5-NIP and DMU5-NIP, the hydrogen bonded networks have a ring structure comprised of 
eight molecular building blocks, as in the N-phenylurea 5-nitroisophthalic acid IMs. The ring 
network in DMU5-NIP is close to being isostructural with those formed in the N-phenylurea  
5-nitroisophthalic acid IMs. In MU5-NIP, the hydrogen bonded network does not have a ring 
structure but is more chain like.  
In the networks of U5-NIP, MU5-NIP and DMU5-NIP, molecular assembly occurs via carboxylic 
acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthons, in a U:Ac motif as in the N-phenylurea  
5-nitroisophthalic acid IMs. In U5-NIP, molecular assembly also occurs in the ring network via 
nitro:amide 2
2(8) and carboxylic acid:amide 2
1(6) hydrogen bond synthons, as in the IMs, and via 
an amide:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bonded dimer. In MU5-NIP, the hydrogen bonded chain is 
additionally comprised of a carboxylic acid:amide 2
1(6) hydrogen bond synthon between MU and 
5-NIP molecules, as in the IMs, alongside a single NHO link between a 5-NIP nitro group and 
MU amine NH group (dNO 2.934(2) ) and a single OHO hydrogen bond (dOO 
2.614(1) ) between a 5-NIP hydroxyl group and a MU carbonyl. In DMU5-NIP, in the ring 
network, each 5-NIP molecule is involved in two carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond 
synthons forming a U:Ac:U hydrogen bond motif; this motif also forms in IM1  IM6, and NS1. 
The disubstitution of one nitrogen atom in the DMU molecule means that a nitro:amide 2
hydrogen bond synthon is blocked from forming between the 5-NIP nitro group and the DMU 
molecule in the hydrogen bond ring; instead they link via a nitro:amide 2
1(6) hydrogen bond 
synthon. This disubstitution also means that a carboxylic acid:amide 2
1(6) hydrogen bond synthon 
is blocked from forming between the 5-NIP carboxylic acid group and the DMU molecule; instead 
they link via a single NHO hydrogen bond (dNO 3.038(2) ). The hydrogen bonding ring 
interactions are given in Table 9.15.

Guest substituted urea molecules occupy the centre of the hydrogen bonded ring networks in  
U5-NIP and DMU5-NIP. In U5-NIP, the guest urea molecules form hydrogen bonded chains that 
run almost perpendicular to the plane of the ring network (non-planar by ca. 70 to 80 ). One chain 
is tethered to the host via an OHO hydrogen bonding interaction with a 5-NIP hydroxyl 
group, not satisfied on hydrogen bond network formation (dOO 2.614(1) ), as in the IMs, and a 
carboxylic acid:amide 2
1(6) hydrogen bond synthon with a urea of the host (dNO 2.971(2) and 
2.945(2) ) whilst the other chain is tethered by a single NHO hydrogen bond to a host urea 
molecule (dNO 2.934(2) ). In DMU5-NIP, a disordered N.N-dimethylurea molecule occupies the 
centre of the hydrogen bonded ring (occupancy split of 84:16) tethered to the host on interaction 
with the 5-NIP hydroxyl group via a carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthon (dOO 
2.434(2)  and dNO 3.089(2) ).  
The packing of the hydrogen bonding networks in U5-NIP, MU5-NIP and DMU5-NIP forms 
layered structures in U5-NIP and DMU5-NIP whilst in MU5-NIP, molecules are arranged with 
alternate orientations (Figure 9.11).  
Figure 9.11 The crystal packing in (a) U5-NIP, (b) MU5-NIP and (c) DMU5-NIP. 
In U5-NIP, the layers are formed of two dimensional planar sheets of the hydrogen bonded rings. 
The sheets stack on top of one another in the crystal structure such that each hydrogen bonded ring 
lies over the next; this creates the channels which are occupied by the one dimensional chains of 
urea molecules. The interlayer separations in U5-NIP are in the range of 2.948(2) to 3.295(2) . In 
DMU5-NIP, the hydrogen bonded rings extend in one dimensional chains. These chains connect in 
two dimensions to form planar sheets via weak CHO hydrogen bonds; formed between DMU 
methyl groups and both oxygen atoms in the OHO hydrogen bond of the carboxylic 
acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthon (dCO 3.309(2), 3.535(2), 3.332(2) and 3.561(3) ) and 
between a methyl group and a 5-NIP nitro oxygen atom (dCO 3.171(2) ). The planar sheets of 
DMU5-NIP stack on top of one another such that two oppositely oriented hydrogen bonding rings 
form a pocket of two disordered DMU molecules. The interlayer separations in DMU5-NIP are in 
the range of 3.206(2) to 3.486(2) . There is no layered structure in MU5-NIP. Instead, molecules 
pack in three-membered pseudo planar units, consisting of a U:Ac hydrogen bonded motif linked 
to a second MU molecule by a carboxylic acid:amide 2
1(6) hydrogen bond synthon. These motifs 
stack in offset columns by - interactions (d 2.958(1) to 3.333(2) ) and each column is 
alternately oriented to the next (rotated by 79 ), connected by OHO hydrogen bonds formed 
between MU and 5-NIP molecules (dOO 2.918(2) ) and between MU molecules  
(dOO 2.955(2) ). 
9.4 Experimental characterisation of the properties of N-phenylurea 
5-nitroisophthalic acid inclusion materials 
9.4.1 Crystallisation trials 
Not all the solvents trialled generated the N-phenylurea 5-nitroisophthalic acid IMs; the host 
components were set up in a range of polar (methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, acetone, THF, ethyl 
acetate, water) and non-polar solvents (diethyl ether, hexane and cyclohexane). Only the polar 
solvents were included in the host structures; diethyl ether produced NS2 whilst the host 
components were insoluble in hexane and cyclohexane.  
9.4.2 Thermal behaviour of N-phenylurea 5-nitroisophthalic acid inclusion materials 
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), Differential Scanning 
Calorimetry (DSC) and Hot Stage Microscopy (HSM) were carried out on IM1  IM7, CIM1 and 
CIM2 to determine the thermal stability of these materials. The thermal stability of NS1 and NS2 
was also investigated. 
TGA-MS 
TGA coupled with MS was carried out on the IMs according to the procedure detailed in 4.4.3. 
The TGA curves with MS data for IM1  IM7, CIM1 and CIM2 are shown in Figure 9.12 to 
Figure 9.14. The TGA shows well defined three-step mass loss profiles in each of the IM and CIM 
curves. The first step corresponds to the loss of the guest, with the identity of each lost guest 
confirmed by MS analysis (Figure 9.12 to Figure 9.14). The second and third mass loss steps 
correspond to the N-phenylurea and 5-nitroisophthalic acid components, respectively, of the host 
framework. In the TGA-MS of CIM2 (Figure 9.14(c)), a small amount of IM4 may be indicated 
by a weak MS signal for a water peak (m/z = 18). There is reasonable agreement between the 
expected and observed weight loss values for each step (Table 9.16). Discrepancies between the 
expected and observed weight losses can be attributed to an impure sample in each case; calculated 
values were based on the asymmetric unit. The size of the first mass loss step in IM7 indicates the 
likely identity of the disordered solvent as THF only. However, in the MS data, methanol solvent 
is detected alongside THF. Therefore in IM7, it is likely that both THF and methanol solvent are 
included in the host structure.

DSC analysis was carried out on the IMs, NS1 and NS2, according to the procedure detailed in 
4.4.2. The DSC traces for each IM and the non-solvated materials, NS1 and NS2, are shown in 
Figure 9.15 and the thermal data is tabulated in Table 9.17. The broad endotherms, below 130 C, 
in the DSC trace for each IM correspond to the loss of the solvent guest from the host; these occur 
within the temperature range of the first mass loss step in the TGA curves of each IM. Two 
endotherms are present in the case of IM2, IM4 and IM5, where two types of guests occupy the 
host structure. The desolvation endotherm in the DSC trace of IM7 is less broad and occurs at a 
higher temperature than in the other IMs. The differing onset temperatures of the desolvation 
endotherms indicate that there is a significant difference in energy required to remove each guest 
molecule from the host structure across the different IMs (Table 9.18).

A melt present in the DSC traces of IM1  IM7 and CIM2, post desolvation at Tonset ca. 150 C, 
matches the main melt of NS1, suggesting the identity of the desolvation product as NS1. The 
short melt in the DSC trace of NS2, at Tonset 149.6 C, also matches the main melt of NS1, 
suggesting conversion to NS1 at this temperature. A second smaller melt peak in the DSC traces 
for IM1, IM3, IM5, IM6 and CIM2 at Tonset 136 C, matches the main melt peak of NS2. This 
may indicate some conversion to this non-solvated form, post desolvation, before conversion to 
NS1 at the higher temperature. The recrystallisation peak in the DSC traces of IM1  IM7, CIM2, 
NS1 and NS2 at ca. Tonset 170 C suggest conversion to the same unidentified product (UN1) at 
this temperature. Different thermal behaviour, post desolvation, is observed for CIM1. The main 
melt in the DSC trace occurs at a higher temperature of Tonset 174.2 C followed by a 
recrystallisation at Tonset 185.7 C; CIM1 is not suggested to convert to NS1 on desolvation but to 
a different unidentified product (UN2) which then converts to a further different unidentified 
product (UN3) post recrystallisation. 
HSM was carried out on single crystals of IM1  IM7, CIM1 and CIM2, according to the 
procedure detailed in 4.4.1. Single crystals were heated by ramping from room temperature to 
past the desolvation temperature as indicated in the DSC traces and the TGA curves for IM. A 
single crystal to powder phase transition was indicated through the desolvation temperature for 
each of the IMs; a powder product was formed in each case. HSM on single crystals of NS1 and 
NS2 was also carried out. Single crystals of NS1 were heated from room temperature to up to 290 
C, beyond the decomposition temperature. On heating NS1, a melt in line with that in the DSC 
trace of NS1 occurred at ca. Tonset 160 C. This was followed by a recrystallisation to a powder 
product between 172 and 180 C, in line with that in the DSC trace of NS1. Single crystals of NS2 
were heated from room temperature to 290 C, beyond the decomposition temperature. At ca. Tonset 
134 C, in line with that in the DSC trace of NS2, a melt occurred with a retention of single 
crystallinity. A small melt in line with that in the DSC trace of NS2 occurred at ca. Tonset 150 C.  
This was followed by a recrystallisation to powder product at Tonset 157 C in line with that in the 
DSC trace of NS2. 
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis 
The thermal transitions indicated in the DSC traces for each material were investigated by PXRD 
according to the procedure detailed in 4.3. PXRD analysis on IM1  IM7 and CIM2 on samples 
at 25 C and after preheating to 145 C or 150 C, past the desolvation point and just below the 
melt temperature, confirmed a structural change (Figure 9.16 to Figure 9.18) and indicated 
conversion to NS1 post-desolvation (Figure 9.20). PXRD analysis on NS2 at 25 C and after 
preheating to 150 C, past the main melt and just below the second smaller melt peak, also 
confirmed a structural change (Figure 9.18) and indicated conversion to NS1 (Figure 9.20). PXRD 
analysis of IM1  IM7, CIM2, NS1 and NS2, preheated to 184 C beyond the recrystallisation 
point, confirmed conversion to the same unidentified (UN1) product (Figure 9.21). PXRD analysis 
of CIM1 at 25 C and on samples preheated to 145 C, past the desolvation point just below the 
melt temperature, confirmed a structural change (Figure 9.19) and indicated that desolvation did 
not lead to NS1 (Figure 9.20) but to an unidentified product (UN2). PXRD analysis of UN2, 
preheated further to 189 C, confirmed a further structural change and indicated the formation of a 
different unidentified recrystallisation product (UN3) to that of UN1 (Figure 9.21).

recrystallisation point, to 184 C (189 C for CIM1). 
The conversion of IM1  IM7, NS1 and NS2 to the recrystallisation product UN1, on heating to 
184 C, was accompanied by a colour change from yellow to cream in the powdered sample. This 
is most striking in NS2 (Figure 9.22). 
Figure 9.22 Powder samples of NS2 (a) at 25 C and (b) after preheating to 184 C. 
The presence of a more stable higher temperature form of NS1 (UN1) is suggested by both DSC 
and PXRD analysis however the identity of this product is unknown. Unlike IM1  IM7 and 
CIM2, CIM1 does not convert to NS1; instead different unidentified desolvation (UN2) and 
recrystallisation (UN3) products are formed. Preliminary indexing and Pawley fits were carried out 
on the powder patterns of UN1, UN2 and UN3 in Topas-Academic V5.0 
 to obtain unit cell 
parameters for these materials. The indexing was inconclusive and further investigation is required 
to confirm their identity; synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction data collections would be 
beneficial to allow accurate indexing of diffraction peaks.  
In the DSC trace of IM1, IM3, IM4, and IM5, an additional small endotherm is present at Tonset 
136  138 C matching that of the melt for NS2 (Figure 9.15), at Tonset 134.8 C. This may indicate 
that in these IMs, post-desolvation, an initial conversion to NS2 occurs at a lower temperature 
before converting to NS1 at 145 C. PXRD analysis was carried out on IM1, IM3, IM4, and IM5 
after preheating to 126  127 C, post desolvation and below the melt of NS2 (Figure 9.23). The 
powder patterns are most similar to that of NS1 at this temperature however an additional peak is 
present at 2 ca. 28 , which does not occur in the patterns for the IMs at room temperature but 
matches the strongest peak in the simulated powder pattern of NS2. It may be that there is some 
conversion of IM1, IM3, IM4, and IM5 to NS2 upon desolvation, alongside NS1. Although not 
conclusive, this is not an unreasonable suggestion as organic inclusion compounds have been 
reported to undergo multiple phase transitions upon thermal desolvation.

9.4.3 Ambient temperature desolvation 
The IMs may be desolvated using heat; this method leads to desolvation via a single crystal to 
powder phase transition. By using more gentle methods, it was thought that desolvation may be 
possible via a single crystal to single crystal phase transition. Desolvation under vacuum was 
trialled for the IMs where the solvent occupied channels in the host structure, in IM2, IM6 and 
IM7, and therefore more accessible.  
IM6 and IM7 were selected for vacuum studies, being the better quality crystals for diffraction 
studies. Single crystals of IM6 and IM7 were put under vacuum at 0.1 mbar pressure for 24 to 48 
hours. Batches of crystals were screened before and after being under vacuum. After being under 
vacuum, the crystal sample quality had deteriorated significantly for both samples. It was only 
possible to collect a single crystal data set on IM7 to determine whether the solvent had been 
removed from the channels. The disorder THF/methanol solvent remained within the channels and 
there was no change in the output electron count per unit cell from Squeeze. 
Powdered samples of IM2 and IM6 were also put into a desiccator to determine whether 
dessication would lead to NS1. PXRD patterns of the sample pre and post dessication, after a two 
week dessication period, did not indicate a structural change or desolvation.  
9.4.4 Resolvation studies 
Vapour diffusion studies were carried out on powdered samples of NS1 and NS2 to attempt their 
resolvation. Powder samples of NS1 and NS2 were placed in a small vial in a sealed bottle in the 
presence of solvent forming a vapour diffusion chamber (Figure 4.3). Solvents methanol, ethanol, 
acetonitrile, acetone, THF and ethyl acetate were used in this setup.  
Vapour diffusion was trialled initially at a range of temperatures (18, 25, 30, 40 and 50 C) and it 
was found that the lowest temperature of 18 C was the best condition for vapour diffusion of all 
the solvents; higher temperatures resulted in rapid sample wetting by the solvent vapour. A vapour 
diffusion time period of 24 hours was chosen; beyond this, samples were wet by the solvent 
vapour. In the case of THF solvent, vapour diffusion was stopped after three hours when signs of 
sample wetting were observed.  
Powder diffraction data were collected on NS1 and NS2, before and after vapour diffusion with 
each solvent (Figure 9.24). Changes in the powder patterns of NS1 were only indicated after 24 
hours of vapour diffusion in acetone solvent (at 18 C) however it was not possible to confirm the 
nature of the structural change. Changes in the powder patterns of NS2 were indicated after 24 
hours of vapour diffusion in methanol, acetone, THF and ethyl acetate solvent (at 18 C) however 
it was again not possible to confirm the nature of the structural change. Vapour diffusion of a 
powdered sample of NS2 with acetone resulted in a colour change from yellow, pre-vapour 
diffusion, to white post vapour diffusion and inside the vapour diffusion chamber (Figure 9.25). 
Since CIM2 is an acetone IM and forms colourless crystals, this may indicate the formation of this 
CIM by resolvation. On removing the powder from the chamber into ambient conditions, the 
colour of the powder returned to yellow. CIM2 shows similar colour change behaviour, forming 
colourless blocks on crystallisation but turning to a yellow powder once exposed to air.

9.4.5 Competition experiments 
Host frameworks may selectively include some guests over others. The selectivity of the hydrogen 
bonded ring network formed by N-phenylurea and 5-nitroisophthalic acid towards particular 
solvent guest inclusion was investigated for 1:1 solvent mixtures and the same 2:1 stoichiometric 
ratio of the N-phenylurea and 5-nitroisophthalic acid molecular components. 
The competition experiment outcomes are shown in Table 9.19; the evidence for each outcome is 
included in A9.1. The non-solvated NS1 is the most formed material in the solvent competition 
studies, forming in six out of seven instances when water comprised part of the solvent mix and 
three instances for the combination of non-water solvents. In no instances is NS2 formed. This 
suggests a preference for the host to be non-solvated, and in the NS1 form, where possible. The 
host framework had the greatest preference for ethanol and acetonitrile; these solvents are 
selectively included over the competing solvent in the solvent mix in the most instances (four out 
of seven). Medium preference by the host is shown for methanol and ethyl acetate; each is 
included in three out of seven instances. The methanol acetonitrile 1:1 solvent mix resulted in both 
IM1 and IM3 forming indicating these solvents to be equally favourable for inclusion by the host. 
The host framework appeared to have the lowest preference for acetone or THF; these solvents are 
selectively included over the competing solvent in the solvent mix in the fewest (two out of seven) 
instances. The 1:1 methanol and THF solvent mixture led to a design route for a new inclusion 
material, involving the inclusion of both solvents, resulting in IM7; indicating these solvents to be 
equally favourable for inclusion by the host. 
For the combination of acetonitrile and THF, acetone and water or acetone and diethyl ether, the 
powder pattern of the crystallisation product is most similar to the simulated powder pattern of 
IM2. It is unknown which solvent or whether one or both are included from these mixtures but this 
result indicates that the structure in IM2, where solvent guests occupy channels in the structure, 
may be favourable for mixed solvent systems; this is indeed the case for IM7.

each outcome is given in A9.1.

9.4.6 Variation of stoichiometry 
The host components were set up in three different ratios of 1:1, 2:1 and 1:2 with the different 
solvents; it was thought that on changing the stoichiometry, different hydrogen bonding networks 
might result as the number of different groups available for each type of synthon formation is 
changed. In particular, the formation of the carboxylic acid:amide 
() hydrogen bond synthon 
(U:Ac) is likely to be affected by the set up ratio of the N-phenylurea (U) and 5-nitroisophthalic 
acid (Ac) components; a 1:1 set up ratio would favour the formation of this synthon involving one  
5-nitroisophthalic acid carboxylic acid group (in a U:Ac motif) whilst a 2:1 ratio would favour its 
formation involving both carboxylic acid groups (in a U:Ac:U motif). 
 In fact, changing the 
stoichiometry of components does not appear to change the host network; the same network is 
favoured for each solvent regardless of stoichiometry of components. Changes in the host network 
are instead achieved on changes to the guest (9.6). 
9.5 IM desolvation to NS1  
The desolvation of IM1  IM7 and CIM2 does not lead to a porous structure with accessible void 
space, instead there is conversion to NS1, meaning the IMs have virtual porosity only (Figure 
9.26). The loss of cavity structure on guest removal is typical for organic inclusion compounds 
and there are only a few examples in the literature where an empty framework is stable on guest 
removal. 
74, 325
 This lack of stability of an empty host framework is unsurprising in the IMs studied 
here as guest removal leads to an unsatisfied hydrogen bonding group (5-nitroisophthalic acid 
hydroxyl group) which should be fulfilled according to Etters rules. 
 The conversion to NS1 
results in the fulfilment of the hydrogen bonding capabilities of this group, accompanied by the 
replacement of the solvent in the hydrogen bonded ring host network with an N-phenylurea 
molecular building block. In the case of IM7, the fact an empty host network is not formed is more 
surprising; guest removal can occur from the channels without disrupting the hydrogen bonded 
ring. This suggests that the formation of NS1 is highly favourable.

9.5.1 Structural changes on desolvation 
On desolvation of IM1  IM7, and CIM2, to NS1 a layered structure is retained which, in the case 
of IM2, becomes increasingly flat. N-phenylurea remains the major component where the ratio of 
molecular building blocks changes from 3:2 in the IMs (7:4 in the case of IM1) to 2:1 in NS1, for 
the N-phenylurea and 5-nitroisophthalic acid molecular building blocks, respectively. In contrast, 
upon desolvation of CIM2 to NS1, the ratio of molecular building blocks changes from 1:1, where 
the host components are present in equal amounts, to 2:1, where N-phenylurea is the major 
component. The structural changes on desolvation are most significant for IM6, where the 
expanded hydrogen bond network condenses, for IM7, which switches a carboxylic acid dimer 
2(8) hydrogen bond synthon for a carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) hydrogen bond synthon, and for 
CIM2, which adopts a more planar structure and a significant molecular rearrangement occurs. 
The desolvation to NS1 leads to a reduction in cell volume and retention of triclinic symmetry in 
the majority of cases; exceptions to this are IM7, where desolvation instead leads to a marginal 
increase in cell volume, and CIM2, where desolvation occurs alongside a change in symmetry 
from monoclinic to triclinic. The desolvation of IM1  IM6, and CIM2, to NS1 also leads to an 
increase in crystal density (Table 9.20) and a change in the interlayer spacing (Table 9.21); the 
largest change is observed in IM4 and IM5. This is not case for IM7, crystal density is instead 
reduced on converting to NS1.

9.5.2 Selective conversion to NS1 
The selective conversion of IM1  IM7 and CIM2, to NS1, on desolvation, rather than to NS2 
(which is only produced here by crystallisation from diethyl ether) may be related to several 
factors including thermal stability, stoichiometries and the nature of the hydrogen bond network.  
NS1 has a greater thermal stability than NS2, shown by conversion of NS2 on heating to NS1, and 
is therefore likely to be the thermodynamically more favourable desolvation product; the main 
melt for NS2 occurs at Tonset 134.7 C compared with 163.0 C for NS1. The ratio of host 
molecular building blocks, where N-phenylurea is in the majority, is also retained in NS1 whereas 
in NS2, N-phenylurea and 5-nitroisophthalic acid components crystallise in an equivalent 1:1 ratio; 
it may be that the stoichiometries with excess N-phenylurea are more favourable. In CIM2, the 
ratio of host molecular building blocks is actually most similar to NS2 where the N-phenylurea and 
5-nitroisophthalic acid components are present in equivalent proportions. The selective conversion 
of CIM2 to NS1 may further suggest the favourability of stoichiometries with excess  
N-phenylurea. The hydrogen bonded ring host network is the most similar between NS1 and  
IM1  IM7, and CIM2, where molecular building blocks assemble via more similar hydrogen 
bonded synthons in contrast to the situation in NS2, where only one of the hydrogen bond 
synthons present in the IMs leads to molecular building block assembly in this structure. CIM1 
does not convert to NS1 on desolvation, forming UN2, and also forms a different recrystallisation 
product of UN3. The fact that CIM1 does not convert to NS1 may be related to CIM1 and NS1 
having similar crystal densities (1.505 M gm
 and 1.496 M gm
, respectively) such that 
conversion would not lead to any favourable gain in crystal density. It could also be that, due to 
the small size of the guests, the space created on desolvation is too small to allow molecular 
rearrangement to NS1; in the other IMs, where larger solvent molecules are present, rearrangement 
to NS1 occurs.  
The relative stability of NS1 compared to the IMs and NS2 was also indicated in the resolvation 
studies; only vapour diffusion with acetone resulted in a shift in the peak position of the powder 
pattern of NS1, pre and post vapour diffusion. In contrast, NS2 appeared more susceptible to 
solvent vapours indicated by a shift in peak positions of the powder pattern of NS2, pre and post 
vapour diffusion with methanol, acetone, THF and ethyl acetate. The competition studies also 
indicated the relative stability of NS1 compared to the IMs and NS2. NS1 was formed 
preferentially in a number of instances over inclusion of a solvent whilst NS2 was not 
preferentially formed in a single instance from solvent mixtures containing diethyl ether; the form 
of the second solvent resulted each time.  
9.5.3 Thermal behaviour 
A relationship between fine structure and thermal transformations of a compound is possible. 
Guest removal energy may be related to crystal density, where a more dense inclusion material is 
more stable and more energy will be required to disrupt the system, 
 or to host-guest interaction 
strength. 
 This is not the case in the materials discussed in this chapter and the energy required 
to remove each guest correlates more strongly with guest
boiling point (Table 9.18 and A9.2).  
9.6 Guest templation of host network formation 
Guest molecules appear to exert control on the host structure formed in the IMs. Changes to the 
combination of guest species led to alterations in the hydrogen bonded host network formed. For 
example, in IM4, a hydrogen bonded ring network forms in the presence of acetone and water 
whilst in CIM1 and CIM2, condensed networks form where water or acetone are present singly. 
In IM5, one hydrogen bonded ring network forms in the presence of THF alongside water whilst 
in IM7, the hydrogen bonded ring network is altered in the presence of THF alongside methanol.  
Changes in the hydrogen bonded host network were also observed on changing the molecular size 
of the solvent. For example, an expanded hydrogen bonded ring network occurs for the long chain 
ethyl acetate solvent (in IM6) whereas a smaller hydrogen bonded ring network occurs in IM1 and 
IM3 where the solvent molecules are smaller (methanol and acetonitrile, respectively). The second 
non-solvated form NS2 is only produced by crystallisation from diethyl ether and it can be 
proposed that the large volume of the solvent molecules in this case precludes the initial formation 
of a solvated IM and instead favours NS2 formation. The location of the included solvent changed 
in the isostructural IMs, IM1 to IM5, related to solvent size. In IM1 to IM3, the solvent molecules 
(methanol, ethanol and acetonitrile) are included in the plane of the hydrogen bonded ring whilst 
in IM4 and IM5, the larger solvent molecules of acetone and THF occupy the space between the 
layers. 
The guest may also be exerting control over the host networks related to its polarity and hydrogen 
bonding ability; inclusion in the majority of cases (except IM7) was via a hydrogen bonding 
interaction to the host. Only IMs with polar guests included were prepared; although a number of 
polar and non-polar solvent guests were trialled. NS2 was formed direct by crystallisation from 
diethyl ether and the fact that no ring network was formed around a diethyl ether guest may be 
related to it being non-polar with a hydrogen bond acceptor oxygen atom which is sterically 
hindered by the diethyl groups. The multiple hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups of the 
water guest may prevent a ring type network forming in CIM1. Water was also only included as a 
guest when crystallised from ethyl acetate from a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of the N-phenylurea and 
5-nitroisophthalic acid host components; crystallisation from water from a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio 
of components presented a direct route to NS1. Attempts were made to alter the hydrogen bonding 
network by changing the set up ratio of components, however in all cases (except in the formation 
of CIM1 occurring from a different solvent to that which was included) this had no effect on the 
network formed. This further suggests the greater templating role of guest molecules in these 
materials. 
9.6.1 Host preference for guests 
The preliminary competition experiments carried out in 9.4.5 indicated that guest uptake by the 
N-phenylurea 5-nitroisophthalic acid host network may occur preferentially although it is difficult 
to form any particular trends. There was a general preference for the guest that could be included 
in the layer of the hydrogen bonded ring network rather than occupying the space between layers; 
methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile or ethyl acetate were included preferentially over acetone or THF. 
This may suggest that a more efficient packing may be achieved in this arrangement. 
 In some 
cases, the guest giving the most dense packing was included preferentially such as for the 1:1 
ethanol acetonitrile solvent mix (IM2 1.435 gmol
 versus IM3 1.428 gmol
) which gave 
IM2, and for the 1:1 acetone THF solvent mix (IM4 1.424 gmol
 versus IM5 1.440 gmol
which gave IM5. However, this was not true of all combinations. No particular link was found 
between guest size or host-guest interaction strength and inclusion preference. In general, there 
was a significant preference for a structure that matched that of IM2, even from solvent mixtures 
that did not involve ethanol. In the IM2 structure guests, occupy channels; this type of inclusion 
may be favourable for mixed solvent systems, as seen in IM7. 
These studies are merely indicative at this stage and would benefit from further investigations 
including trialling further solvent mix ratios; this may allow a selectivity coefficient to be 
determined. 
 There are also some caveats in the analysis carried out. When a powder precipitate 
was formed on crystallisation from a solvent mixture, it was not possible to make a firm 
conclusion about the product identity due to the presence of multiple phases and when single 
crystals were obtained, not every single crystal in the vial was screened and so some products may 
have been missed and the bulk may be misrepresented.  
9.7 Engineering hydrogen bond networks with inclusion properties 
In the design of hydrogen bonded networks with inclusion behaviour, a number of substituted urea 
molecular building blocks alongside 5-nitroisophthalic acid were trialled.  
The strategy of targeting the polycarboxylic acid 5-nitroisophthalic acid proved to be successful 
for forming extended hydrogen bonded networks with inclusion behaviour. The trigonal 
arrangement of the hydrogen bonding groups (carboxylic acid and nitro groups) allowed network 
extension in three directions and aided the generation of structural voids, filled by guest molecules, 
by hindering the close packing of molecules. The 5-nitroisophthalic acid carboxylic acid groups 
participated in a number of hydrogen bond synthons which led to network formation including 
carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) and 2
1(6) synthons to substituted urea amide groups. The  
5-nitroisophthalic acid nitro group was also versatile in network formation participating in a 
number of hydrogen bond synthons including nitro:amide 2
2(8) and 2
1(6) synthons to 
substituted urea amide groups. The planarity of the 5-nitroisophthalic acid molecule was carried 
through to the hydrogen bonding synthons it formed; this may have encouraged the formation of 
the hydrogen bonded rings.  
The variation of the substituted urea in combination with 5-nitroisophthalic acid appeared to affect 
the hydrogen bonded inclusion network formation. Hydrogen bonded networks with inclusion type 
behaviour were formed for U5-NIP, DMU5-NIP and for the N-phenylurea IMs. In these 
complexes, the hydrogen bonded networks had ring structures formed around guest molecules; in 
U5-NIP and DMU5-NIP these guests were the substituted urea whilst in the N-phenylurea IMs, the 
guests were solvent molecules. No inclusion type behaviour occurs in the hydrogen bonded 
networks of MU5-NIP; hydrogen bonded chains of molecules formed instead. 
Within the networks, differing effects related to the substituted nature of the urea were observed. 
Changes to the substitution of the urea led to changes in the extended nature of the hydrogen 
bonded ring networks formed between U5-NIP, DMU5-NIP and the IMs, affecting the number of 
hydrogen bond donor-acceptor groups available. In U5-NIP, where the urea was unsubstituted and 
had the maximum number of urea donor and acceptor groups available for hydrogen bonding, the 
hydrogen bonded ring networks extended in two dimensions, forming a hydrogen bonded planar 
sheet. In contrast, in DMU5-NIP and for the N-phenylurea IMs, one side of the urea molecule was 
blocked by substitution and the hydrogen bonded ring networks extending in a one-dimensional 
chain only.  
The substituent size also appeared to have an effect on the type of hydrogen bonding network 
formed. In MU5-NIP, despite having the same number of hydrogen bonding sites available as  
N-phenylurea, the same ring network does not form. The single methyl substituent is significantly 
smaller than the phenyl ring (Figure 9.27). It may be that larger urea substituents are required to 
stabilise the type of ring network formed in the N-phenylurea IMs. This is supported by almost 
isostructural hydrogen bonding ring networks forming for DMU5-NIP; the dimethyl substituents 
are also bulky on one side of the urea. The bulky substituents may have an effect of protecting the 
ring unit from disruption at the extremities giving it a closed favourable structure. A similar effect 
is seen in host frameworks based on hydrogen bonded hydroxyl rings which are stabilised by 
bulky, rigid groups. 
328, 329
Figure 9.27 A structural overlay of molecules N-methylurea (red) and N-phenylurea (blue).  
Changes in the urea substitution appeared to tune the hydrogen bonded network cavity size. This 
was observed between the hydrogen bonded ring networks formed in DMU5-NIP and in the  
N-phenylurea 5-nitroisophthalic acid IMs IM1 to IM5. A structural overlay of the two hydrogen 
bonded networks indicates that the cavity formed by the hydrogen bonded ring network in DMU5-
NIP is smaller than in IM1 to IM5 (Figure 9.28). This is related to urea substituent size where the 
N-phenyl substituent on the urea acts as a larger spacer and shifts the position of the  
5-nitroisophthalic acid molecule, relative to its in position in DMU5-NIP, causing the ring to 
widen. The smaller cavity size in DMU5-NIP may be the cause for only DMU molecules being 
included in this material where its flexibility to solvent guest molecules is reduced. The fact that 
no solvent guests are included in the DMU5-NIP network may also be related to the strength of the 
host-guest interaction formed; a very short OHO hydrogen bond (dOO 2.434(2) ) forms to 
the DMU guest in DMU5-NIP which may be too strong to be disrupted by solvent guest 
molecules. 
Figure 9.28 A structural overlay of the hydrogen bonded ring network in IM1 to IM5 (blue) and DMU5-NIP (red). 
The variations in the urea substitution also appear to have a consequence for the guest inclusion in 
the hydrogen bonded networks. In U5-NIP where the urea was unsubstituted and therefore smaller, 
guest molecules formed chains that penetrated the hydrogen bonded ring network; this allowed 
the hydrogen bonding of the urea molecules to be satisfied. In contrast, in DMU5-NIP or NS1, 
where the guest was substituted on one side by bulky groups, it was included in the layer of the 
hydrogen bonded network.  
Variation in the substitution of the ureas also led to variation in the hydrogen bonding synthons 
that were formed. Across the different substituted urea 5-nitroisophthalic acid complexes, the 
formation of the carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) synthon was prevalent and unaffected by 
substitution; this indicates the robust nature of this motif for the assembly of carboxylic acid and 
amide groups. In contrast, the type of nitro:amide synthon formed and whether the carboxylic 
acid:amide 2
1(6) synthon was present was affected by urea substitution. This is evident between 
the IMs and DMU5-NIP where the hydrogen bonding network is almost isostructural except for 
the type of nitro:amide hydrogen bond synthons present. In DMU5-NIP, the disubstitution of the 
DMU nitrogen atom blocks hydrogen bonding sites and led to a nitro:amide 2
1(6) synthon 
forming, in place of a 2
2(8) synthon in the IMs, and a single NHO hydrogen bond, in place of 
a carboxylic acid:amide 2
1(6) synthon in the IMs. The change in synthons had little effect on the 
overall ring network formation. The carboxylic acid:amide 2
1(6) synthon was present in all non or 
singly substituted urea molecular complexes. The nitro amide 2
2(8) synthon formed for U5-NIP 
and the N-phenylurea IMs, where the urea was increasingly less substituted; it was not formed in 
MU5-NIP despite the single substitution of the urea however this structure is most different to that 
of U5-NIP and the N-phenylurea IMs. 
9.8 Conclusions 
In this chapter, substituted ureas with 5-nitroisophthalic acid have been investigated for the design 
of hydrogen bonded networks with inclusion behaviour via a number of hydrogen bonding 
synthons. Fourteen molecular complexes were prepared, nine of which had solvent inclusion 
behaviour (IMs); these latter were formed for the combination of N-phenylurea with  
5-nitroisophthalic acid.  
In the synthesised inclusion materials, the hydrogen bond was shown to be an important tool both 
in host formation and guest inclusion; host networks were based on a number of hydrogen bond 
synthons whilst guest tethering occurred in most cases via hydrogen bonding to the host. This 
reaffirms the potential of the hydrogen bond in inclusion material design. Certain hydrogen 
bonding synthons prevailed in the networks between the 5-nitroisophthalic acid and substituted 
urea components including carboxylic acid:amide and nitro:amide hydrogen bond synthons; in 
particular the carboxylic acid:amide 2
2(8) synthon was robust for network formation. This aids in 
the predictability of the assembly of urea, carboxylic acid and nitro group containing molecular 
building blocks in the solid state.  
The molecular components of 5-nitroisophthalic acid and substituted ureas were shown to be 
suitable targets in the design of hydrogen bonded networks with inclusion behaviour. The 
arrangement of hydrogen bonding groups in 5-nitroisophthalic acid favoured the formation of ring 
networks which led to the inclusion behaviour whilst substitution of the urea allowed tuning of the 
resulting hydrogen bonding networks, including network shape and size; an increased substitution 
of the urea with bulkier groups favour inclusion behaviour in the resulting networks and is 
recommended in further design strategies. The nitro functionality of the 5-nitroisophthalic acid 
molecule proved to be a valuable crystal engineering tool allowing network extension and 
variation being versatile in hydrogen bond synthon formation. This reveals the potential for 
network modification by modifications to the molecular components.  
The synthesised IMs were not thermally stable but desolvated on heating, as is typical for organic 
inclusion compounds, which did not lead to an empty structure but to a material where a host 
molecular building block replaced the solvent guest in the cavities. These materials therefore do 
not offer the potential for porous frameworks on guest removal; this is likely a result of the host 
hydrogen bonding group pointing into the guest cavity which must be fulfilled on guest release. 
The study of thermal behaviour allows physical properties to be related to structure; this may aid 
in the prediction of the thermal behaviour of future inclusion materials where the structure is 
known.  
In the design of these materials, the guest is shown to have an important role in determining host 
structure having a templating effect; different host networks were formed for different 
combinations of single and multiple guests. The templating of host structures by guest molecules 
is useful in the design of inclusion materials, allowing the introduction of diversity into the 
networks and providing the potential for making subtle modifications to structure and therefore 
properties. The inclusion of different guests in different networks, or not, may also indicate the 
determining factors in guest selection; here molecular size and hydrogen bond donor-acceptor 
ability appeared to be important. Preliminary competition studies investigated the host selectivity 
of guests, however these potential properties require further investigation.

Conclusions and future work 
The work in this research project has demonstrated the potential of synchrotron X-ray diffraction 
to reveal information about proton transfer behaviour, across hydrogen bonds, in the solid state. 
The synchrotron X-ray diffraction technique was found to be applicable in the studies of proton 
transfer behaviour when both the data collection and refinement procedures were optimised. It was 
therefore possible to correlate a number of effects to the proton transfer behaviour including the 
hydrogen bond local and wider crystal packing and hydrogen bond donor-acceptor distances. This 
aids in the understanding of these processes and in the future design of proton transfer materials. 
The study of these effects in the range of molecular complexes accessed from crystal engineering 
studies also provides insight into the predictability of molecular recognition and crystal packing 
where common hydrogen bond motifs repeatedly formed for combinations of certain co-formers. 
Where the crystal packing leads to a certain physical property, such as proton transfer or inclusion 
behaviour, this contributes to the predictable design of functional materials.  
10.1 Synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies of proton transfer behaviour 
The synchrotron X-ray diffraction technique was found to be applicable in the study of proton 
transfer processes allowing the collection of diffraction data from which proton transfer behaviour 
could be determined. In particular, the speed of data collection offered by this method was found 
to be invaluable allowing multiple measurements across which the proton transfer processes could 
be studied; whether multi-temperature measurements, such as for the investigations of the 
temperature dependent effects of proton disorder and migration, or across a number of molecular 
complexes. The success of the synchrotron technique in these studies was, however, found to rely 
upon certain factors which should be considered upon its implementation in future studies.  
Having high quality data was shown to be important in these studies in order to allow the reliable 
determination of proton transfer behaviour in the Fourier difference maps; reduced data quality led 
to increased noise in the Fourier difference maps and to large errors on the hydrogen bond 
parameters such that hydrogen atom behaviour, or changes in it, became indeterminable. This was 
seen in a number of cases and was likely a cause of sample quality therefore emphasising the need 
for optimum conditions in order to rely on the use of the technique in studying proton transfer 
behaviour. The optimisation studies attempted to probe where these optimum conditions could be 
achieved during the data collection stages. The trialling of a number of data collection strategies, 
between which the portions of data collected and X-ray detectors were varied, revealed that 
collecting a hemisphere of data using a CCD detector is an appropriate strategy to employ in these 
studies allowing good quality Fourier difference maps to be obtained without compromising 
experimental time. Promising results were found in the preliminary studies using the DECTRIS 
Pilatus 300K detector; this detector offers enhanced speeds of collection and improved signal to 
noise ratios and therefore may be the way forward in future studies of this type. Varied 
temperature steps and ramping methods were trialled during the data collection process and it was 
found that smoother and more reliable trends in the hydrogen atom parameters could be found 
when probing the proton transfer behaviour at an increased number of points along the temperature 
profile. The collection of data, as the temperature is ramped continuously, also allows a more 
detailed account of the proton transfer behaviour over the range studied. The approach of 
continuous temperature ramping was pioneered in this work, having not previously been 
implemented in single crystal X-ray diffraction studies, and was made possible by the use of the 
synchrotron X-ray source.  
The choice of refinement method was shown to have consequences for the determination of proton 
transfer behaviour using the synchrotron technique. The different refinement strategies trialled, 
targeted both the way information about the transferring hydrogen atom was refined from the 
synchrotron data and the way it was modelled during the refinement. Single temperature step data 
set refinement in SHELXL 
 was shown to be successful and a simple method to implement in 
following the proton transfer processes, whether static or as a function of temperature. The 
employment of the parametric refinement method in Topas-Academic V5.0 
 was shown to be 
both possible and potentially advantageous in the studies of proton migration allowing shifts in 
proton position to be followed by its simultaneous refinement over a large number of data sets and 
saving significant data processing time. There were, however, limitations presented with the use of 
this method. Parametric refinement has the potential to offer an enhanced accuracy in the refined 
proton position, where refined over a large sample of data, however, the model chosen to drive the 
hydrogen atom position with temperature significantly affected the migration behaviour indicated 
by the refined hydrogen atom positions. The use of parametric refinement in studies of this type is, 
however, promising and while it is a more involved method, this work has gone some way to 
making its implementation in studies of proton transfer more routine and further investigation is 
recommended. Care was also required in the treatment of the transferring hydrogen atom in the 
SHELXL 
 refinements. In some cases, such as following proton migration, it was appropriate to 
apply different models to the proton thermal behaviour; freely refined and fixed thermal 
parameters indicated similar proton transfer behaviour allowing confidence in the observed proton 
migration. In other cases, such as following proton disorder, modelling the hydrogen atom 
behaviour in a certain way, including models with the proton position split over two sites in the 
hydrogen bond, was less appropriate; in most cases the refined occupancies were not supported by 
the carboxyl bond lengths or the Fourier difference maps. This emphasises the problems presented 
in attempting to follow or to model the behaviour of potentially a fraction of an electron. 
The determination of the proton transfer behaviour occurring in each system using the synchrotron 
technique was found to be most reliable when all available information extracted from the data 
were in support of the behaviour suggested and when following a consistent trend. It was also 
found that greater weight, in the determination, should be given to the Fourier difference maps, a 
direct imaging approach that is not dependent on models assumed for the proton structural 
parameters and hence offers high potential to allow proton behaviour to be determined reliably 
from X-ray diffraction, and to the heavy atom parameters, accurately refined by this technique. 
This allows greater confidence in the results obtained from synchrotron X-ray diffraction. This 
may appear a disadvantage in comparison to neutron diffraction methods, which allow 
unambiguous determination of proton transfer behaviour without the need of supporting 
information. However, these disadvantages are compensated for by the high throughput offered by 
the synchrotron radiation methods assessed here allowing the collection of a single data set in 
minute time scales compared to hours for a neutron diffraction measurement.  
These findings therefore contribute to the development of the synchrotron X-ray diffraction 
method such that it can be used routinely and more confidently in future studies of proton transfer 
behaviour. Further development is required, including exploring the use of Pilatus detectors in 
these studies, as well as maximising the potential of the parametric refinement processes in  
Topas-Academic V5.0. 
10.2 Tuning proton transfer behaviour 
Proton transfer in the form of temperature dependent proton disorder and migration and static 
proton transfer processes was studied using the synchrotron technique. Changes in hydrogen atom 
density or shifts in refined hydrogen atom positions, as a function of temperature or across a set of 
complexes, were observable in agreement with structural parameters and density in the Fourier 
difference maps. This allowed details about the proton transfer behaviour to be revealed including 
mechanistic information and temperature dependency. Proton disorder and migration were both 
shown to be temperature dependent and gradual effects; the effect more subtle in the case of 
proton migration. Proton disorder occurred via Arrhenius behaviour whilst the proton migration 
observed was most likely attributable to lattice fluctuations with temperature. In the case of the 
static proton transfer, this transfer was well defined in each complex whilst subtle effects were 
shown to occur on the length scale, across the complexes. The proton transfer behaviour in turn 
revealed the details about the likely shape of the hydrogen bond potential energy surface. These 
studies therefore contribute towards the understanding of the different proton transfer processes. 
The study of the different proton transfer processes allowed variations in the transfer behaviour to 
be rationalised in the variations across the molecular complexes. A number of effects were 
revealed to tune the transfer behaviour occurring across the molecular complexes.  
Crystal packing, including in the local environment of the hydrogen bond and the wider packing, 
was indicated to tune the proton transfer behaviour occurring. This effect was apparent in the 
proton disorder (Chapter 5) and static proton transfer (Chapter 8) studies. Proton transfer effects 
were reduced where interactions formed in the local environment of the hydrogen bond. This was 
evident in the 3,5-DNBA molecular complexes; decreased extents of proton disorder occur at each 
temperature where there is a direct interaction between the dimer hydrogen bonds and the local 
environment in contrast to complexes in which this interaction is not present. In the DMAN 
molecular complexes, the  [NHN]
 IHB proton appears localised by the interactions between 
the nitrogen donor-acceptor atoms and X
; asymmetrically located and undergoing reduced 
extents of transfer, on the side of the IHB that forms the shortest interactions to X
. Similar 
thermal behaviour was also observed in the DMAN molecular complexes between the IHB proton 
and X
, potentially indicating an influence of X
 on the proton behaviour. Proton transfer effects 
were also reduced where interactions were formed in the wider crystal packing. This was evident 
in the DMAN molecular complexes; the [NHN]
 IHB proton appears localised by the  
[Me2NHN Me2]
 X
 minor interactions, located on the side of the IHB where they are 
shortest. In some of the 3,5-DNBA molecular complexes (3,5-DNBA MCZ and 3,5-DNBA In-3-
Ac), despite the dimer hydrogen bonds being in an isolated environment, a 50:50 disorder is not 
observed; this occurs where there the arrangement of interactions to rest of 3,5-DNBA molecule 
are not the same on the protonated and non-protonated side which may be sufficient to imbalance 
the symmetry of the carboxylic acid dimer groups. The observed tuning effect of the crystal 
packing on proton transfer behaviour in this research project is in support of that found by Jones et 
al (2013) 
 and contributes further insight to what the specific effects might be. The tuning of 
the proton transfer behaviour by the crystal packing also indicates the sensitivity of the hydrogen 
bond potential energy surface; perturbed by the weaker interactions.    
Proton transfer behaviour was also found to be related to the hydrogen bond donor-acceptor 
distances. As is well known, the strength of the hydrogen bond affects the proton transfer process 
occurring, related to the shape and barrier height of the hydrogen bond potential energy surface for 
the different interactions. Proton disorder occurred for moderate strength hydrogen bonds whilst 
proton migration occurred for the shortest of the interactions (SSHBs). The proton transfer process 
of temperature dependent proton migration appeared particularly sensitive to donor-acceptor 
distance, only occurring in the molecular complexes across OHO SSHBs with donor--acceptor 
distance of less than 2.45  or N
HO
 SSHBs with donor-acceptor distances in the region of 
2.551  or less. These observations are in agreement with studies in the  
literature. 
110, 111, 117, 267
 For OHO SSHBs, the previously proposed 2.45  limit appeared strict, 
where proton migration was observed in DMU2,4-DNBA for an OO distance of 2.441(1)  but 
not for DMUP for an OO distance of 2.449(2) . This emphasises the need for very short donor-
acceptor distances for the proton migration process to occur; this is related to a reduction in the 
barrier to proton transfer and to the increasingly symmetric hydrogen potential energy surface as 
the donor-acceptor distance reduces. In the case of the N
HO
 SSHBs, the donor-acceptor 
distance is the longest in INP of those previously reported to exhibit proton migration. No limit 
has been yet been suggested for these interactions however, it may within the range of 2.551(1) to 
2.555(1) , where proton migration could not be confirmed in IN2,4-DNBA whose N
distance was the latter. More studies are required to examine the N
HO
 SSHB donor-acceptor 
range to identify a potential limit above which temperature dependent proton migration is not 
expected to occur. In the molecular complexes, the donor-acceptor distance also appeared to tune 
the transfer occurring at low temperature (100 or 150 K); in the SSHBs studies, elongated DH 
distances occurred for the shortest donor-acceptor distances whilst in the DMAN molecular 
complexes, the static transfer behaviour appeared to be related to the donor-acceptor distance 
(more so than the HX
 distances). This indicates the effect of donor-acceptor distances on the 
shape of the hydrogen bond potential energy surface. These studies aid in understanding proton 
transfer behaviour and contribute to the knowledge of where it may be expected in similar 
materials, in terms of donor-acceptor distances, or those donor-acceptor distances to target; this is 
important where relatively few examples exist in the literature. 
The potential for pKa values to tune proton transfer behaviour was also indicated; the extent of 
temperature dependent proton migration across OHO SSHBs in substituted urea organic acid 
molecular complexes 
 has previously been correlated to pKa values. The single OHO 
proton migration material identified in this research project (DMU2,4-DNBA) agrees with the 
suggested trend of increasing extent of migration as the pKa values become increasingly less 
negative (i.e. approaches zero). However, no such trend was indicated for the N
HO
 SSHBs 
on comparing the single N
HO
 proton migration material identified in this research project 
(INP) with those previously reported. Two issues arise in this work on correlating pKa and proton 
migration including the difficulties in transferring pKa values to the solid state, including that they 
are determined from solution but applied in the solid state, and on comparing extents of migration 
obtained from different diffraction methods; proton shifts determined from X-ray diffraction are 
longer than those determined from neutron diffraction. 
 The tuning effects of pKa on proton 
transfer therefore should be considered more tentatively. If applicable, however, this factor would 
be beneficial in these studies allowing extents of proton migration to be targeted through co-
former selection.   
Proton transfer behaviour therefore appears tuneable by a subtle balance of a combination of 
effects. This reveals the potential to control proton transfer behaviour in future materials where 
crystal packing has an element of predictability or in targeting certain hydrogen bond donor-
acceptor distances. By targeting certain transfer behaviour, it may be possible to target certain 
functions, attributable to proton transfer, in solid state materials.  
10.3 Crystal engineering 
The implementation of crystal engineering strategies allowed the preparation of a number of 
molecular complexes. A number of design strategies were employed including targeting the 
formation of (1) SSHBs, in the design of potential proton migration materials, (2) the  
 [Me2NHNMe2]X
 fragment, for the study of proton transfer behaviour and anion effects, 
and (3) extended hydrogen bonded networks with inclusion behaviour. Across the crystal 
engineering strategies, elements of predictability were noted, contributing to knowledge of 
molecular assembly in the solid state.  
There was some predictability in the tuning of the intermolecular interaction distances between 
components. This was found in both the studies involving the engineering of SSHBs and in the 
DMAN organic acid molecular complexes and occurred as a result of molecular substitution and 
molecular motif formation. Molecular substitution appeared to affect the interaction distances of 
the SSHBs and the minor interactions in the DMAN molecular complexes related to the basicity of 
the hydrogen bond acceptors. A strategy of selecting increasingly acidic hydrogen bond donors 
and increasingly basic hydrogen bond acceptors is recommended to access the shortest of the 
SSHBs whilst targeting increasingly acidic substituted benzoic acids or those with non-halogen 
electron withdrawing groups in the DMAN molecular complexes led to weaker minor interactions. 
Certain hydrogen bonding motifs also appeared to have consequences for interaction distances; 
SSHBs were favoured in hydrogen bonding motifs of the carboxylic acid:amide and single CAHB 
HO
 hydrogen bonds whilst a [Me2NHNMe2]X
 fragment, where X
 was a 
deprotonated acid, led to shorter minor interactions than where it was an electron withdrawing 
group. A correlation between interaction distances and pKa values was less conclusive, however, 
the pKa values were mostly correct in predicting the occurrence of proton transfer; this is 
interesting where the shorter hydrogen bonds generally formed where proton transfer had 
occurred. Interaction distances were found, whether those in the local or wider packing, to tune 
proton transfer behaviour. Understanding the ways in which these interactions distances may be 
tuned or targeted is of interest where they appear to influence proton transfer behaviour; their 
tuning via component selection and combination may allow certain proton transfer behaviour to be 
targeted in materials.  
There was also predictability in molecular aggregation occurring across the molecular complexes. 
Aggregation appeared affected by hydrogen bonding groups; certain hydrogen bonding groups 
assembled repeatedly via the same hydrogen bonding motifs such as the combination of the 
carboxylic acid and amide functionalities and the anilic acids with N-heterocycles. The ring 
position or nature of the substituent also caused variation in the aggregation including in the 
DMAN:ACID
 anion units formed, in terms of the identity of X
 or the ratio of components 
forming the [Me2NHNMe2]X
fragment, or the urea organic acid motifs formed, whether 
extended or isolated, as the number of available hydrogen bonding sites or size of molecular 
substituent varied. The geometry of the hydrogen bond donor-acceptor groups also favoured 
certain molecular aggregation. For example, the arrangement of the acid groups in the anilic acids 
favoured bifurcation on deprotonation whilst the pseudo trigonal symmetry of hydrogen bonding 
groups in 5-nitroisophthalic acid favoured hydrogen bond network extension in three directions for 
inclusion network formation. In the case of the inclusion networks, guests were also shown to play 
a role in templating the networks revealing additional ways to influence molecular assembly in the 
solid state as well as introducing diversity into networks formed. The predictability in the 
molecular aggregation observed in the complexes in this research project indicates ways in which 
control of crystal packing may be achieved by certain co-former selection or combination. Where 
molecular aggregation can determine material properties, such as proton transfer or inclusion 
behaviour, increased knowledge of molecular assembly, as found in this work, aids in the 
deliberate design of functional materials.  
As well as contributing knowledge to the design of materials in the solid state with desired 
structure related functions, the work in this research project is also an excellent example of the 
robust nature and versatility of the hydrogen bond in crystal engineering; able to exhibit a number 
of proton transfer processes or facilitate host-guest chemistry, contributing to both host network 
design and guest inclusion.  
10.4 Future work 
The work presented here has the potential to be developed in aspects of both the synchrotron X-ray 
diffraction studies of proton transfer behaviour and in the crystal engineering studies.  
Related to the use of the synchrotron X-ray diffraction technique, developments in both the data 
collection and crystal structure refinement methods are still required where this is the first reported 
instance of its implementation in studies of this type. The optimisation of the hybrid pixel 
detectors such as the DECTRIS 
 Pilatus range would be advantageous in these studies for a 
more rapid data collection, particularly useful in the continuous temperature ramping studies 
allowing many more points along the temperature profile to be probed, and for reduced noise for 
potentially cleaner Fourier difference maps for proton transfer behaviour determination. The 
continuous temperature ramping method should also be further explored, trialled only in one case, 
allowing the evolving proton transfer behaviour to be followed. The single crystal parametric 
refinement method developed in Topas-Academic V5.0 
 should be built on, currently allowing a 
stable refinement but where there is room for its optimisation. Trialling further models for proton 
transfer would also be of interest, including one that restricts the hydrogen atom position but 
allows the thermal parameters to refine, to determine what else can be refined parametrically or 
applying the method to further examples. In general, improvement in the refinement of proton site 
occupancies in the disorder studies is also required; this was achieved somewhat reliably in the 
benchmarking study of 3,5-DNBA but remained unreliable for the 3,5-DNBA molecular 
complexes. Using the carboxyl bond lengths may be one solution, but a better method for treating 
the split proton density is required. 
In using the synchrotron X-ray technique to elucidate information about the proton transfer 
occurring such that it can be rationalised, this study would benefit from complementary neutron 
diffraction measurements; this is particularly true in the determination of the disordered proton 
split site occupancies. The aim here, however, was to assess the potential of X-ray methods in the 
absence of neutron studies. A number of systems were studied reasonably successfully using the 
synchrotron technique and correlations between proton transfer behaviour and other effects could 
be identified. The study of further systems would add further weight and insight to the conclusions 
made in this research project about the tuning effects on proton transfer behaviour, particularly 
those of the weaker interactions, and therefore how to achieve the design of proton transfer 
behaviour into additional materials. There was also no attempt made to quantify the tuning effects 
of the weaker interactions in this work. This could be performed using computational methods and 
would allow the energy of stabilisation/destabilisation associated with the crystal packing to be 
determined. 
 The tuning effects could also be investigated by conducting charge density studies 
to determine atomic charges and electron density of components of the weak interactions; this may 
reveal their perturbation effects or strength. 
Developments to the crystal engineering strand would target further proton transfer materials 
considering what has been found in this research project. The design of the charge assisted  
HO
 was not as well investigated as those of the OHO SSHBs and should be 
investigated further, particularly those for the 6-membered ring N-heterocycles, favouring the 
shorter of the interactions. If successful, this may allow the donor-acceptor distance limit for 
migration across charge assisted N
HO
 hydrogen bonds to be determined. Where proton 
transfer led to the shortest of the OHO SSHBs, the pKa range where proton transfer is 
expected should be probed for their future design. Despite the contributions from this research 
project, the number of reported studies of proton disorder systems remains low. Further 
investigation into the circumstances under which the 3,5-DNBA centrosymmetic hydrogen bonded 
dimers form would be of interest. Where attempts to crystallise 3,5-DNBA dimers in the presence 
of a range of substituted benzoic acids were unsuccessful, a strategy of using different types of co-
molecules should be implemented. The substituted benzoic acid co-molecules used were selected 
with the aim of determining whether certain benzoic acid substituents favoured homo (3,5-DNBA 
dimer alongside a co-molecule dimer) or hetero-dimer formation; in all cases, the co-molecules 
crystallised separately. The combination of 5-nitroisophthalic acid with ureas whose substituents 
are more bulky than that of N-phenylurea would be interest to determine if similar hydrogen 
bonding inclusion networks can be obtained for other substituents via the same hydrogen bonding 
synthons. This may lead to a range of inclusion materials based on the same synthons and network 
motif.  
10.5 Concluding remarks 
The work in this research project is by no means definitive in the studies of proton transfer 
behaviour using synchrotron X-ray diffraction but hopes to go some way in demonstrating its 
potential for routine use in these studies, offering the potential to reveal insight into the transfer 
process and aspects of molecular structure control.  
Crystal engineering is shown to remain a significant tool in the design of solid state functional 
materials with the hydrogen bond being robust for materials formation. It is hoped that the design 
strategies trialled in this work can be used in the development of functional materials, whose 
function is dependent on the proton behaviour, as in the proton transfer systems, or molecular 
packing, as in the inclusion networks.
