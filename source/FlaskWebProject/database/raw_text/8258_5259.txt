ABSTRACT 
The general p r o p e r t i e s , c l a s s i f i c a t i o n and d i s t r i b u t i o n of 
p l a n t p r o t e i n s are discussed w i t h i n an a g r i c u l t u r a l context and the 
p r o t e i n content and composition of several g r a i n crops are tab u l a t e d . 
The major p r o t e i n s of legume seeds are s a l t s oluble p r o t e i n s ( i . e . g l o b u l i n s ) 
and the methodology f o r t h e i r e x t r a c t i o n , separation and c h a r a c t e r i s a t i o n 
i s reviewed. The s t r u c t u r e , l o c a t i o n and d i s t r i b u t i o n of legume g l o b u l i n s 
are described and the p r o p e r t i e s of various p u r i f i e d legume g l o b u l i n s are 
compared. The major seed p r o t e i n s of Pisum sativum are legumin and v i c i l i n 
and seed g l o b u l i n s w i t h p r o p e r t i e s s i m i l a r to those of legumin and v i c i l i n 
have been extracted from other legumes. The i s o l a t i o n and p a r t i a l 
c h a r a c t e r i s a t i o n of v i c i l i n - l i k e p r o t e i n s from seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris 
and Vigna unguiaulata and of le g u m i n - l i k e p r o t e i n s from these two species 
and .Phaseolus aureus i s described. 
The p o t e n t i a l usefulness of the examination of seed p r o t e i n s 
by polyacrylamide g e l ele c t r o p h o r e s i s to taxonomic problems i n Phaseolus 
and Vigna i s i n v e s t i g a t e d and the data obtained are discussed i n r e l a t i o n 
to recent r e - c l a s s i f i c a t i o n s of the species. Procedures f o r the e x t r a c t i o n 
and p a r t i a l c h a r a c t e r i s a t i o n of p r o t e i n s from an archaeological sample of 
maize grains are described and the p r o t e i n s from t h i s sample are compared 
w i t h the p r o t e i n s from a modern v a r i e t y of maize. I t i s suggested t h a t 
p r o t e i n data from archaeological samples could be u s e f u l i n studies of 
crop p l a n t o r i g i n s and i n c u l t u r a l s t u d i e s , and t h a t the procedures 
employed may be a p p l i c a b l e t o archaeological samples of other g r a i n s . 
N u t r i t i o n a l aspects of p l a n t p r o t e i n s are discussed b r i e f l y . 
A possible s t r a t e g y f o r the improvement of the sulphur amino ac i d content 
of legumes w i t h a r e l a t i v e l y low legumin content i s suggested and i t i s 
demonstrated t h a t polyacrylamide g e l electrophoresis may provide a basis 
f o r a screening procedure f o r p r o t e i n q u a l i t y i n legume breeding programmes.

INTRODUCTION 
The seed i s the f i r s t form i n which the new spermatophytic 
p l a n t can e x i s t , in vivo, independently of i t s maternal parent. I t s 
s t r u c t u r e i s s p e c i a l i s e d f o r d i s p e r s a l and i t c a r r i e s w i t h i n i t s e l f the 
m a t e r i a l s , i n c l u d i n g p r o t e i n s , which are required f o r s u r v i v a l and, under 
favourable c o n d i t i o n s , growth and the development of an adequate 
photosynthetic system. The bulk of the seed, g e n e r a l l y , i s carbohydrate 
and/or o i l , however the p r o t e i n content of seeds can be 10% ( c e r e a l s ) , 
20% (many legumes) or even 45% ( c e r t a i n v a r i e t i e s of Glycine max): f o r 
comparison the p r o t e i n content of many v e g e t a t i v e t i s s u e s (as harvested) 
i s less than 5% ( 1 ) . The seed p r o t e i n f r a c t i o n i s heterogeneous and i t 
includes many of the types of p r o t e i n found i n the mature p l a n t . Several 
c l a s s i f i c a t i o n s of p l a n t p r o t e i n s e x i s t and these have been described ( 1 ) . 
A high p r o p o r t i o n of the m a t e r i a l synthesised during seed 
development i s l a i d down as reserve, or storage, m a t e r i a l which i s 
u t i l i s e d subsequently as a source of carbon and n i t r o g e n compounds during 
germination. More than 80% of the seed p r o t e i n may be storage p r o t e i n (1) 
and t h i s component i s t h e r e f o r e of considerable importance both to the 
seed and t o man and h i s animals as a food source. 
I n the l a t t e r p a r t of the nineteenth century and the e a r l y 
p a r t of the t w e n t i e t h century Osborne and h i s co-workers developed 
procedures which were of general a p p l i c a b i l i t y f o r the e x t r a c t i o n and 
separation of the major seed p r o t e i n s . They defined four classes of 
p r o t e i n s on the basis of s o l u b i l i t y , viz.', albumins (water s o l u b l e ) , 
g l o b u l i n s ( s a l t s o l u b l e ) , prolamins ( a l c o h o l s o l u b l e ) , and g l u t e l i n s 
( a l k a l i s o l u b l e ) . The percentages of the Osborne s o l u b i l i t y classes i n 
various grains have been tabulated ( 1 ) . The albumin f r a c t i o n includes 
the numerous enzymes of the seed and generally contains 10% or less of 
the seed p r o t e i n . The major p r o t e i n s of legumes are g l o b u l i n s , and 
prolamins and g l u t e l i n s are e i t h e r absent or are present i n only low 
concentration. Albumins and g l o b u l i n s occur also i n other grains and i n 
some crops, f o r example hemp and rape, g l o b u l i n s are major p r o t e i n s . 
However prolamins and g l u t e l i n s are the major f r a c t i o n s i n cereals and 
albumins and g l o b u l i n s form only 20% or less of the p r o t e i n ; i n r i c e 80% 
of the p r o t e i n i s g l u t e l i n . 
Although the Osborne s o l u b i l i t y classes have proved very 
u s e f u l i n comparing the g r a i n p r o t e i n of d i f f e r e n t crops the percentages 
r e f e r r e d t o above should be regarded only as approximations. Accurate 
values are d i f f i c u l t to o b t a i n because of a r t i f a c t s of e x t r a c t i o n and 
f r a c t i o n a t i o n . Some of the problems and precautions which may be taken 
have been discussed ( 1 , 2 ) ; procedures f o r the i s o l a t i o n of cereal 
prolamin have been reviewed r e c e n t l y by M i f l i n and Shewry 
During the e a r l y i n v e s t i g a t i o n s by Osborne's group the seed

g l o b u l i n s of Pisum sativum were separated i n t o two f r a c t i o n s which were 
designated legumin and v i c i l i n r e s p e c t i v e l y . V i c i l i n was more soluble 
than legumin i n d i l u t e s a l t s o l u t i o n , i t p r e c i p i t a t e d from s o l u t i o n when 
heated to 95 and i t had less sulphur than legumin. The g l o b u l i n s from 
Vioia faba3 Vioia sativa and Lens esaulentum were separated i n t o f r a c t i o n s 
w i t h p r o p e r t i e s i d e n t i c a l ( w i t h i n the l i m i t s of experimentation) to 
those of legumin and v i c i l i n and these f r a c t i o n s were also termed legumin 
and v i c i l i n . By cont r a s t the g l o b u l i n s i s o l a t e d from other legumes, f o r 
example Glycine max and Phaseolus vulgaris d i f f e r e d from legumin and 
v i c i l i n . 
Subsequent t o the development of the u l t r a c e n t r i f u g e 
Danielsson + prepared legumin and v i c i l i n from Pisum sativum by d i l u t i o n , 
and by d i a l y s i s and i s o e l e t r i c p r e c i p i t a t i o n , and determined t h e i r 
sedimentation c o e f f i c i e n t s  l e g u m i n 12.6S, v i c i l i n 6.5-8.IS. He f u r t h e r 
characterised the two f r a c t i o n s by t h e i r chemical compositions and by 
t h e i r e l e c t r o p h o r e t i c m i g r a t i o n . Danielsson also i d e n t i f i e d p r o t e i n s w i t h 
sedimentation c o e f f i c i e n t s of approximately 12S and 7S i n seed g l o b u l i n 
f r a c t i o n s from more than 20 other legumes, which included Glycine max and 
Phaseolus vulgaris, and on the sole basis of the sedimentation data he 
c a l l e d these p r o t e i n s legumin and v i c i l i n . 
During the l a s t two decades advances i n biochemical technique 
have led to the p u r i f i c a t i o n , or p a r t i a l p u r i f i c a t i o n of several legume 
storage p r o t e i n s . The methodology f o r the e x t r a c t i o n , separation and 
c h a r a c t e r i s a t i o n of seed g l o b u l i n s has been discussed and the accumulated

data ( t o 1976) on t h e i r d i s t r i b u t i o n have been reviewed ( 2 ) . The legumin 
f r a c t i o n which Osborne prepared from Pisum sativum, although impure, 
contained mainly a s i n g l e p r o t e i n and the term legumin has been r e t a i n e d 
f o r t h i s p r o t e i n . The term v i c i l i n i s used here f o r the 7S storage 
g l o b u l i n s of Pisum sativum and other legumes. A more pr e c i s e d e f i n i t i o n 
of v i c i l i n which would be acceptable i n a l l l a b o r a t o r i e s i s s t i l l l a c k i n g , 
and o p e r a t i o n a l l y the term i s sometimes applied to the g l o b u l i n f r a c t i o n 
which i s soluble i n d i l u t e s a l t s o l u t i o n at pH 4.7. However g l o b u l i n s 
other than the 7S storage p r o t e i n s may be present i n t h i s f r a c t i o n ( f o r 
references see 2) and may sometimes be confused w i t h the v i c i l i n . 
G l o b u l i n l e c t i n from Phaseolus vulgaris sediments i n the u l t r a c e n t r i f u g e 
as a 6.IS species (3) and i s not e a s i l y detected by t h i s technique when 
the sample contains high concentrations of 7S g l o b u l i n . Smaller (2S-4S) 
seed g l o b u l i n s have been i d e n t i f i e d i n preparations from several legumes; 
ge n e r a l l y they are present i n r e l a t i v e l y low con c e n t r a t i o n by comparison 
w i t h the major 12S and 7S g l o b u l i n s and they have received less a t t e n t i o n 
than the l a t t e r . 
Legumin-and v i c i l i n - l i k e g l o b u l i n s occur i n several (and 
perhaps i n a l l ) genera of the Leguminosae and le g u m i n - l i k e p r o t e i n s are 
found also i n other d i c o t y l e d o n s . However the r e l a t i v e concentrations, 
one to another, of legumin and v i c i l i n p r o t e i n s vary from species to 
species and even between v a r i e t i e s ( 1 , 2 ) . 
At Durham the major p r o t e i n s of several legumes and some 
non-legumes have been studied and p a r t i c u l a r a t t t e n t i o n has been given to 
species of Phaseolus and Vigna, as well.as._to members of the Vicieae. 
The g l o b u l i n s from Phaseolus aureus (3),. Phaseolus vulgaris (3, 4) and 
Vigna unguioulata (5) have been f r a c t i o n a t e d by use of zonal i s o e l e c t r i c 
http://well.as._to
p r e c i p i t a t i o n . The f r a c t i o n s from the two species of Phaseolus were 
p a r t i a l l y characterised by a n a l y t i c a l u l t r a c e n t r i f u g a t i o n and ele c t r o p h o r e s i s 
i n polyacrylamide gels under no n - d i s s o c i a t i n g and d i s s o c i a t i n g c o n d i t i o n s , 
and the g l o b u l i n s from Phaseolus vulgaris were characterised f u r t h e r by 
amino acid a n a l y s i s , N-terminal amino ac i d determination, carbohydrate 
determination and by t h e i r a g g l u t i n a t i n g a c t i v i t y against red blood c e l l s . 
The g l o b u l i n s from Vigna unguioulata were p a r t i a l l y characterised by 
a n a l y t i c a l u l t r a c e n t r i f u g a t i o n and gel e l e c t r o p h o r e s i s . The l o c a t i o n of 
the g l o b u l i n s of Phaseolus vulgaris i n the cotyledons and the separation 
of the major polypeptides (sub-units) of the g l o b u l i n s of Vigna unguioulata 
and t h e i r sequential synthesis d u r i n g seed development were also described. 
These i n v e s t i g a t i o n s give f u r t h e r support to the o p i n i o n (2) t h a t legumin-
and v i c i l i n - l i k e p r o t e i n s are d i s t r i b u t e d widely i n the Leguminosae. 
Small diferences between equivalent polypeptides i n the 
leg u m i n - l i k e p r o t e i n from d i f f e r e n t species, and s e r o l o g i c a l data (see 2) 
i n d i c a t e t h a t these p r o t e i n s are not i d e n t i c a l . A s i m i l a r s i t u a t i o n i s 
found w i t h other w e l l defined p r o t e i n s , f o r example the haemoglobins, and 
i t i s p o s s i b l e , by analogy, t h a t the legumin-like p r o t e i n s are a l l forms of 
legumin. C l e a r l y more c r i t i c a l data, f o r example amino a c i d sequences, 
are required t o determine whether or not the legumins are r e l a t e d one to 
another by common ancestry. P r e l i m i n a r y sequence data has been obtained 
( B o u l t e r , unpublished) from legumin from members of the Vicieae and a

SUMMARY 
Protein band patterns of globulins extracted from the seeds of a number of different species of 
Phaseolus and Vigna, have been obtained by disc electrophoresis and the sub-units of the major 
seed proteins have been separated on gels by use of continuous SDS electrophoresis. The 
agglutinin potential of seed extracts with respect to human Group O red blood cells has also 
been determined. The globulin extracted from Phaseolus lunatus was different from that from 
P. acutifolius, P. coccineus, P. dumosus and P. vulgaris, and these globulins were different from 
the major glohulins extracted from other species which differed among themselves. The globulin 
patterns for P. atropurpureus and P. lathyroides were not the same as those of the other species 
examined and saline extracts from the two species lysed red blood cells. Agglutinin activity was 
detected only in extracts from P. acutifolius, P. coccineus, P. dumosus and P. vulgaris. Glyco-
protein I I , the major seed protein of P. vulgaris, was tentatively identified as the major globulin 
in extracts from P. acutifolius, P. coccineus and P. dumosus, and was not detected in the other 
species, with the exception possibly of P.'atropurpureus and P. lathyroides. We discuss our data 
in relation to recent re-classifications of species of Phaseolus and Vigna. 
INTRODUCTION 
Approximately 80% of the protein of legume seeds is storage or reserve protein; in those 
legumes which have been examined it is. made up of a small number of different salt-
soluble proteins, globulins (for references see Derbyshire, Wright and Boulter, 1975). 
Usually one or two of these proteins predominate and more than 50% of the total seed 
protein may occur as a single protein, for example legumin in Vicia faba (Wright and 
Boulter, 1972) and Glycoprotein I I in Phaseolus vulgaris (Pusztai and Watt, 1970; 
Racusen and Foote, 1971; Barker et al., 1975). 
The composition of the storage protein differs in different legume species (Boulter, 
Thurman and Derbyshire, 1967; Kloz, 1971; Dudman and Mil lerd , 1975), but for 
certain tribes, uniform electrophoretic protein band patterns are obtained when the seed 
globulins from members of the same tribe are compared (Boulter et al., 1967). I n other 
tribes, however, uniform patterns are not obtained from different members but here it 
may be possible, as for example in the tribes Phascoleac, Loteae and Glycineae, to 
distinguish sub-groups, each with a characteristic protein band pattern. I t may also 
prove feasible to use storage protein band patterns to sub-divide the species of a large 
genus. Thus, the storage protein band patterns of thirty-six species of Crotalaria 
correlate well with subdivisions of the genus based on morphological and cytological 
data and with geographical distribution (Boulter et al.., 1970). 
Several revisions of the classification of the Phaseoleac have been proposed in recent 
years and in these schemes some species of Phaseolus have been transferred to other 
G 283

genera, i.e. Macroptilium, Azukia and Vigna (Hutchinson, 1964; Ohwi, 1965; Ohwi and 
Ohashi, 1969; Marechai, 1969; Verdcourt, 1969, 1970). Kloz and co-workers (KIoz, 
1971) have examined immunological reactions of the seed proteins of species f rom the 
Phaseolus-Vigna complex and conclude that seed protein composition correlates with the 
systematic position of the species f rom which the protein was obtained. The immuno-
electrophoretic techniques employed by Kloz and co-workers (Kloz, 1971) are relatively 
simple and rapid; however, appropriate antibody samples must be prepared, usually, for 
each plant group under investigation and, ideally, f rom pure proteins; these preliminary 
steps are time-consuming when compared to the direct examination of seed protein 
extracts or the total seed globulin fraction. The seed globulins and their sub-units from 
a small sample of species of Phaseolus and Vigna have been examined by the use of 
electrophoretic and other techniques in order to assess the potential usefulness of this 
approach of these genera. Since the major seed globulin of Phaseolus vulgaris has been 
isolated and characterized recently (Pusztai and Watt, 1970; Barker et al., 1975), we are 
able also to comment on the distribution of this protein in the two genera. 
MATERIALS 
Seeds of Phaseolus species were gifts f rom J. Smartt and had been collected from plants 
grown in the Botanical Gardens of the School of Agriculture, Cambridge. Cultivars of 
P. vulgaris were obtained locally and seed of Vigna unguiculata was provided by the 
International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, Nigeria. 
METHODS 
Seeds were milled in a Glen Creston M i l l and each meal was then divided into three 
portions. Globulin protein was prepared f rom one portion of each meal by the method 
of Boulter et al. (1967). Total protein was extracted f rom a second portion by blending 
with 10 volumes of 2.5% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)1% z-mercaptoethanol 
(2-Me) in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer p H 7.0 in a high-speed blender, which was 
cooled in ice, for 3 min and the resultant slurry was squeezed through two layers of 
muslin and centrifuged at 23,000 g for 10 min. The third portion of meal was stirred 
with 10 volumes of 1 % NaCl in 0.05 M phosphate buffer p H 7.0 and the suspension 
which passed through two layers of muslin was clarified by centrifugation. 
Disc electrophoresis of globulins in 7% acrylamide gels was carried out by the pro-
cedure of Ornstein and Davis (1961). Protein extracted in SDS-2-Me was heated for 2 min 
at ioo C and then cooled in running tap water: electrophoresis.of these solutions was 
carried out by the method of Weber, Pringle and Osborne (1972). Protein bands in gels 
were detected by staining with Amido-Black 10B and glycoprotein components were 
identified in duplicate gels by the method of Zacharius et al. (1969). 
The agglutinating activity of salt extracts was determined by mixing one volume of 
extract wi th one volume of a 1 % suspension of human Group O red blood cells in 1 % 
NaCl. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The protein band patterns obtained by disc electrophoresis of the seed globulins were 
of two types (Table 1). I n one type a single stained band was dominant and in the other 
Seed proteins of Phaseolus and Vigna 285 
no single component dominated the pattern, although one stained more heavily than the 
others (i.e. either R m 0.21 or 0.31). The single banded pattern was seen in gels of globu-
lins from Phaseolus acutifolius, P. coccineus, P. dumosus, P. lunatus and P. vulgaris, and 
the mobility of the major band in each gel, except those of P. lunatus, was approximately 
the same, R m 0.39; the mobility of the major band of the globulin f rom P. lunatus was 
R m  - 3 3 -
Multi-banded patterns were found in gels of the other ten species which were examined 
and in each of these patterns prominent bands were seen in the regions corresponding to 
R m 0.21 and 0.31, except in gels of P. trilobus. Other major bands were not seen in gels 
of P. uconitifolius, P. angular is, P. aureus, P. mungo and Vigna unguiculata, but were in 
gels of Phaseolus calcaratus ( R m 0.13), P. filiformis ( R m 0.26), P. atropurpureus ( R m 0.09, 
0.24, 0.38) and P. lathyroides ( R m 0.37, 0.47). Only the last two species contained a

prominent component which corresponded in mobility on gels to that of the dominant 
band of the single-banded species. Three bands were prominent i n gels of P. trilobus 
and their mobilities were 0.14, 0.22 and 0.24. The storage proteins of many legumes show 
reversible association/dissociation with changes in ionic strength and p H (for references 
see Derbyshire et al., 1975). Thus, the differences between multi-banded patterns ob-
served here and those seen in the previous investigation (Boulter et al., 1967) may 
have resulted from association/dissociation of a single protein. 
Electrophoresis of the protein subunits extracted f rom several cultivars of P. vulgaris 
and f rom P. vulgaris sub-sp. aborigineus, gave subunit patterns which were very similar 
one to another and which were dominated by a pair of bands R m 0.27 and R m 0.30 of 
unequal intensity (Table 1). The band R m 0.27 was diffuse and intensely stained relative 
to the band R m 0.30. More mobile components were prominent i n the regions R m 
0.40-0.45, and 0.50-0.57. I n certain of the cultivars, for example 'The Prince', a band 
was observed in the region corresponding to R m 0.24, but in other cultivars, e.g. 'Master-
piece', this band was not seen. A l l these subunits were stained as glycoproteins by the 
PAS method. 
A subunit pattern similar to that of P. vulgaris and including band R m 0.24, was 
obtained f rom P. acutifolius, P. coccineus and P. dumosus, which suggests that similar 
proteins exist in relatively high concentrations in each of the four species. A similar 
conclusion has been arrived at by Klozova and Kloz (1972), who have shown that a 
286 E . D E R B Y S H I R E et al. 
protein immunochemically similar to the major seed protein of P. vulgaris occurs in 
seed extracts f rom P. acutifolius, P. coccineus and P. dumosus, although the protein f rom 
P. acutifolius was not identical to that f rom the other species. I n contrast, they showed 
that extracts f rom P. lunatus did not react immunologically with the antibodies prepared 
f rom the protein from P. vulgaris. The major seed protein of P. vulgaris is a glycoprotein, 
Glycoprotein I I (Pusztai and Watt, 1970; Racusen and Foote, 1971; Barker et al., 1975), 
which is dissociated by SDS treatment to subunits R m 0.27 and 0.30, i.e. subunits with 
mol. wt 50,000 and 47,000 in SDS gels, and the data suggest that this seed protein is a 
major protein also in P. acutifolius, P. coccineus and P. dumosus. Subunits with mobilities 
similar to those of Glycoprotein I I were observed as very faint bands on gels of P. 
lunatus; the significance of these weak bands, i.e. whether they belong to Glycoprotein 
I I , cannot be assessed. The other components seen on SDS gels of P. acutifolius, P. 
coccineus, P. dumosus and P. vulgaris, were the major components on gels of P. lunatus. 
The most prominent subunit extracted from each of the other species was also a 
glycoprotein. Its mobility ( R m 0.24) was the same in each extract and was less than the 
mobilities of the Glycoprotein I I subunits. In gels of P. atropurpureus and P. lathyroides 
the relative concentration of subunit R m 0.24 was less, and that of subunit R m 0.19 was 
greater than in the other species of this group. Subunits characteristic of Glycoprotein 
I I were absent f rom these species except possibly in P. atropurpureus and P. lathyroides, 
where bands of R n i 0.27 and R m 0.30 were seen as minor components. However, Klozova 
and Kloz (1972) have shown that the major seed protein of P. vulgaris was not detected 
immunologically in extracts from the latter two species or from the other species which 
we have examined, except P. acutifolius, P. coccineus and P. dumosus. 
Two glycoprotein bands were prominent in the region R l n 0.41-0.45 in gels f rom P. 
nr.uti.fnHm, P. ralraratus, P. caccitieiiL, P. diunQsus,R.fiHforviis.,P.Jiawlus^xid^B. vulgaris., 
and human Group O blood cells were agglutinated when mixed with salt extracts f rom 
P. acutifolius, P. coccineus, P. dumosus and P. vulgaris. The subunits of the agglutinins 
of P. vulgaris are glycoproteins with mol. wt 34,000 and 30,000, which migrate during 
electrophoresis with R m 0.41-0.45 (Allan and Crumpton, 1971; Barker et al., 1975), and 
it is suggested that agglutinins homologous with those of P. vulgaris may occur in P. 
acutifolius, P. coccineus and P. dumosus. Extracts f rom the samples of P. calcaratus, P. 
filiformis and P. lunatus which we examined did not agglutinate human Group O red 
blood cells. Samples of P. calcaratus which did not agglutinate this group of erythrocytes 
have been reported previously (Bird, 1955), and cultivars of P. lunatus which contain 
agglutinins which are active against these cells are rare (Boyd, Waszczenko-Zacharczenko 
and Goldwasser, 1961), although cultivars which agglutinate human Group A or non-
human red blood cells are widespread (for references see Toms and Western, 1971). The 
agglutinating activity of seed extracts f rom P. filiformis has not been reported previously, 
as far as we are aware. 
A glycoprotein subunit R m 0.44 was a conspicuous component in gels of P. mungo 
and Vigna unguiculata and appeared to be absent from gels of Phaseolus aconitifolius, 
P. angularis, P. atropurpureus, P. aureus, P. lathyroides and P. trilobus. Human Group O 
red blood cells were not agglutinated by salt extracts f rom any of these species; however, 
they were lysed when mixed with extracts f rom P. atropurpureus and P. lathyroides. 
Boyd et al. (1961) also did not detect agglutinin or lytic activity in extracts f rom P. 
angularis, P. aureus, P. calcaratus and Vigna sinensis (cowpea) when these were tested 
against human Groups A, B and O erythrocytes (but see Toms and Western, 1971). 
T w o subunits R n, 0.48 and R m 0.52, were prominent in the subunit patterns from 
http://nr.uti.fnHm
Seed proteins of Phaseolus and Vigna 287 
Phaseolus aconitifolius, P. aureus, P. calcaratus and P. mungo, and the less mobile of these 
bands was prominent in gels of P. trilobus and Vigna unguiculata but not in those of 
Phaseolus angularis, P. atropurpureus and P. lathyroides; in the latter three species 
component R m 0.52 was prominent. 
Taken together the protein data discussed above demonstrate that the species of 
Phaseolus can be separated into a number of groups on the basis of their seed protein 
composition. By this criterion P. coccineus, P. dumosus and P. vulgaris form a closely 
related group and P. acutifolius differs f rom these only in the slightly different immuno-
logical reactivity of its major seed protein. The species in this group differ f rom P. 
lunatus and other species which do not have Glycoprotein I I as their major seed protein, 
and on the basis of their protein band patterns and the lytic activity of their extracts, P. 
atropurpureus and P. lathyroides are different f rom other species. 
Hutchinson (1964) transferred P. atropurpureus and P. lathyroides to the genus 
Macroptilium and this revision receives some support f rom the protein data presented 
here. I t has also been proposed that Asiatic species of Phaseolus, including P. angularis, 
should be placed in a new genus Azuika (Ohwi, 1965), or, more recently, in Vigna (Ohwi 
and Ohashi, 1969). Marechai (1969) has transferred Phaseolus aconitifolius to Vigna also. 
Verdcourt (1970) has extensively revised the genus Vigna and has included in it Phaseolus 
aconitifolius, P. angularis, P. aureus, P. calcaratus, and P. trilobus, as well as Vigna 
unguiculata (and many species which we have not examined). The protein data are 
consistent with these revisions and suggest also that species of Phaseolus not transferred 
to other genera can be separated into a group which has the major seed protein Glyco-
protein I I and others in which this protein is absent.

SUED PROTEIN PROCLtS OF AFRICAN REPRESENTATIVES 
OF VIGNA SPP. .

Summary 
Rrpresentativcs of Vigna species may be separated into a number of groups on the 
basis of their seed protein profiles. Since these groups are consistent v'<\h contemporary 
classifications of the species it is suggested that the procedure employed here may be of 
value in systematic investigations of this genu The profiles indicate that the different 
species examined all have the same major seed storage proteins. 
Introduction 
Vigna a widespread tropical and sub-tropical genus is morphologically very 
diverse. The systcmatics of this genus has been subject to prolonged controversy 
and both the classification of traditionally recognised species ot Vignj and the 
composition of the genus have been revised from time to time; lor a com-
prehensive discussion of African representatives of Vigna sc* Vcrdcourt (1970). 
The potential value of electrophorctic patterns of proteins in systematic 
investigations of plants was discussed by Boulter, Thurman & Turner (1966) and 
useful data have been obtained for a number of taxa (see for example Boulter,-
Thurrrun Jx Derbyshire, 15)67; Vaughan &: Denford, 196S; Boulter, Derbyshire, 
Frahm-Lclivcld &: Polhill, 1970; Crisioiolini, 1971). We now report the seed 
protein profiles of eleven African representatives of Vi%na, and suggest that our , 
data indicate that the procedure employed here may be of value in systematic 
investigations of this genus. 
Materials and Methods 
F*ed samples were obtained from the germphsm collection maintained and 
ca;?iOgued by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, and 
had been harvested from plants grown there under similar conditions of soil and 
climate. Their accession numbers and the species they represent are shov/n in 
Table 1. A seed mca was prepared from each sample by milling several seeds 
in a Glen Creston M i l l equipped with a 0.7 mm screen, and protein was extracted 
from 10 mg of meal by blending with 1 ml c . i M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 
containing 25 mg sodium dodecyl sulphare (SDS) and 20 ,ul 2-mcrcaptoethanol 
solution. The protein solutions were heated in scaled tubes for 1 niln at iccT and 
then cooled rapidly to room temperature. The density of each solution was 
increased by the addition of 0.5 ml Sc 0 glycerol and bromo phenol blue dye 
was added to each to act as a visible marker during electrophoresis. Each solution 
was then divided into two parts and to one, an equal volume of o.i/o 
myoglobin in the SOS-phosphate buffer, which had also been hea:ed and cooled, 
was added as a marker pro:cin. The proteins were subjected to electrophoresis 
in io'0 SDS-acryb.m:de ge'.s bv the procedure of Weber & O^bcirn ( I Q 6 Q ) and 
their locations in the gels were determined by staining wish i. Amido Black in

Results ami Discussion 
The seed protein profile of V. unguiculata cv. Prima (Fig. 1) was obtained 
consistently with different samples examined on severs occasions; a simitar 
pattern was obtained from cv. Sit.10 Pole (Table 1). The major components in 
tins profile correspond to the subunits of the major storage proteins of cv. 
Prima isolated by ion exchange chromatography in SM urea, (Carasco, 1976) 
and components with the same Rms were aUo the major components in profiles 
of the other representatives 01 Vipu which we examined; i ; is probable therefore 
that the dillerent species of Vig'M all contain the same niajoi storage proteins. 
The profile from V'. H>:$H;.C:I.I.I included a component. R y 0.16, which was  
not prominent in proliles trom any of the other samples which we examined 
and several of the latter contained components with R n l c.31 and/or R,n o.48-0.50 
which -were not prominent in V. uiigiiicnluitt. The profiles of the three samples

af V. oblongijolia var. parvij'ora which we examined were identical and the 
;ame profile was obtained from accession T v n u 89 (V . lancijoli.i). This finding 
is consistent with results obtained by 1'aris (1965) who showed that V. oblongi-
lolia, V. parvijlora and V. lancijolia were cross fertile, and with the classification 
of Vcrdcourt (1970) who has transferred V. lancijolia to V. oblongifolia and 
maintains parvijlora as a separate taxon only at the varietal level. The profiles 
from the five samples of V, vexilLita were aiso substantially similar to each other 
and they differed from those of the other species examined. However the five 
profiles from V. vexillata were not identical and dilicrcnccs were observed among 
the minor components with Rms between 0.4S and 0.50. I t must be emphasised 
that the absence of a component from a proiile in Table 1 docs not necessarily 
imply the absence of the corresponding protein from the seed since i) only the 
more prominent components have been recorded in the table and ii) proteins 
present in very low concentrations in gels may not have been detected by the 
staining procedure which we employed. 
V. unguiculata, V. oblongijolia and V. vexillata belong to different breeding 
groups (l-'aris, 1 9 6 5 ) and each species is representative ot a different sub-genus 
(Verdcourt, 1 9 7 0 ) . Thus whilst the data presented here indicate that rep-
resentatives of Vigna may be separated into groups on the biiis of their protein 
profiles it has not demonstrated at which taxonomic level the profiles are 
characteristic. However, seed protein profiles from several species of Phaseolus 
which have been transferred to Vigna (Marechal, 1 9 6 9 ; Verdcourt, 1 9 7 0 ) also 
differed from each other (Derbyshire, Yarwood, Neat fie Boulter, 1 9 7 6 ) and taken 
together the two sets of data indicate that species of Vigru can be distinguished 
by use of their seed protein profiles.

SUMMARY 
Maize grains from an archaeological site in N.E. Arizona have been examined by light micro-
scopy and electron microscopy. Their endosperm tissue was intact and was similar to that of 
modern maize although some of the features seen in other non-viable seeds were present; the 
embryos, however, were discoloured and damaged. Protein has been extracted from both 
endosperm and embryos although only a small quantity was extracted from the latter. 
The protein sub-unit profiles of these extracts and of storage protein fractions prepared by 
serial extraction of endosperm meal in salt, alcohol and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) 
solutions have been determined after electrophoresis in SDS-acrylamide gels. The data ob-
tained indicate thai zein and glutelins similar to modern maize proteins were the major 
storage proteins but that their proportions differed to those in modern maizes; these 
conclusions are supported by the amino acid composition of the wholse seed meal. It is 
suggested that these procedures may be applicable to other archaeological samples of seeds 
including those of other species and that the data so obtained may be of use in cultural 
studies and in botanical studies of crop plant origins and evolution. 
INTRODUCTION 
The morphology of archaeological plant material has been compared with that of modern 
varieties in order to trace the probable evolutionary pathway of maize during its domestica-
tion (Mangelsdorf, 1974). Morphological structures, however, are a less direct reflection of 
the genetic information of an organism than the protein profile formed by a direct template 
mechanism and comparisons of protein profiles have been shown to be of considerable 
value in establishing relationships of present day taxa (e.g. see Johnson and Hall, 1966; 
Boulter et al., 1970: Avise, 1974). The investigation reported here demonstrates that 
proteins can be extracted from archaeological plant material and meaningfully compared 
with those from modern varieties, indicating that comparative studies of the protein profiles 
of ancient seeds may be useful both for archaeological investigations and for studies of crop 
plant origins and evolution. 
MATERIALS 
Well-preserved grains of 10-12 row maize, average weight 0.3 g, from the excavations of Earl 
H. Morris (unpublished) on a site in Canyon del Muerto in the N.E. corner of Arizona, near 
500 E. DERBYSHIRE ETAL. 
the more famous Mummy Cave, were kindly provided by Dr J. B. Wheat of the University of 
Colorado Museum at Boulder. The site has not been precisely dated but this is potentially 
determinable from tree-ring data (Gladwin, 1957; Schulman, 1949) and is between the 
Basketmaker stage in the earlier part of the 1st millenium (Morris, 1954) and its time of 
abandonment sometime between the 11th and 13th centuries (Bushnell, 1957). 
METHODS 
Starch distribution was examined in fresh sections of imbibed grains stained with iodine in 
potassium iodide. Protein distribution was examined in 2-jum sections of resin embedded 
material stained with alcoholic Bromophenol Blue. Material for electron microscopy was 
fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1.5% formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 
post-fixed in 1% osmic acid, dehydrated with ethanol and embedded in Spurr's resin. Thin 
sections were stained with uranyl acetate and alkaline lead citrate. 
Meals were prepared from whole seeds and from separated endosperm and embryos by 
milling in a Glen Creston Mill and were extracted by blending in 2.5% sodium dodecyl 
sulphate (SDS)-O.Ol M 2-Mercaptoethanol (2-Me) -0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 
(100 mg meal/ml) for 3 min. at high speed, then stirred for 15 min. and finally clarified by 
centrifugation at 23,000 g for 10 min. Salt soluble protein was extracted from other 
portions of meals in 0.4 M NaCl-0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 by a similar procedure. The 
salt-insoluble residue from the early maize endosperm was serially extracted with 70% ethyl 
alcohol, 70% ethyl alcohol made 0.01 M with respect to 2-Me, and 2.5% SDS-0.01 M 2Me-
0.1 M phosphate buffer; each extraction step, including the saline extraction was repeated 
twice. 
Samples of extracts, in 1%-SDS-0.1 M 2-Me-0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7,0-wcrc heated 
for 5 min. in closed tubes at 100C then cooled. Electrophoresis of these samples was carried 
out in SDS-acrylamide gels by the method of Weber and Osborn (1969). Samples of the 
saline extracts were examined, in the absence of SDS and 2-Me, in non-dissociating acryl-
amide gels (Ornstein and Davis, 1961). Gels were stained for total protein with 1% Amido 
Black in 7% acetic acid and excess stain was removed by diffusion in 7% acetic acid. The 
esterase, acid phosphatase and leucine amino peptidase activities of saline extracts were 
determined separately in non-dissociating acrylamide gels (Brewbaker et al., 1968). 
Duplicate samples of meals were hydrolysed in 6 M HC1 for 20 h in sealed tubes at 105C 
and the amino acids were determined with a Locarte automatic loading analyser. Total meal 
nitrogen was determined by an automated micro-Kjeldahl method (Varley, 1966). 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The maize from the Canyon del Muerto did not germinate at 27C although the imbibed 
grains had the same moisture content (35%) as viable imbibed grains of a modern maize 
used for comparison. 
Visual inspection and light microscopy showed that the endosperm tissues of the early 
maize were relatively intact and contained starch and protein whilst those of the embryos 
were discoloured and damaged, and in some grains destroyed. The general structure of the 
endosperm in which there was a single layer of aleurone cells was similar to that of modern 
maizes (Khoo and Wolf, 1970). Electron microscope studies of aleurone cells showed short 
lengths of endoplasmic reticulum, intact nuclei which were multilobed, and numerous 
protein bodies and spherosomes (Plate 1, No. 1, and Plate 2, No. 2); the spherosomes 
Protein in early maize grains 501 
surrounded the nuclei and protein bodies, lined the plasmalemma and filled much or the 
cells. Other cell organelles were not readily distinguished. Some protein bodies showed clear 
regions similar to the clear globoids which appear during the initial stages of reserve mobiliz-
ation in barley (Jones, 1969). Numerous dark dense patches in the chromatin of nuclei 
(Plate 1, No. 1) and withdrawal of the protoplast from cell walls (Plate 2, No. 2) were 
observed in the early maize aleurone cells and these are features seen in other non-viable 
seeds (van Staden, Gilliland and Brown, 1975; Villiers, 1971), however, another feature of 
non-viable seeds, namely the extensive coalescence of spherosomes (van Staden et al., 1975) 
was not seen; the majority of the spherosomes were intact and only a small number had 
coalesced. When examining the inner endosperm we encountered similar practical difficulties 
to those of mature maize reported by Khoo and Wolf (1970). They distinguished between a 
sub-aleurone layer and the starch endosperm and commented on differences in protein 
body staining and size in the two zones. We noted a similar sub-aleurone layer of approxi-
mately cubic cells which contrasted in shape with the elongate inner cells and a larger 
population of small protein bodies in the inner tissues than that in the sub-aleurone layer 
(Plate 2, No. 3). Larger protein bodies were also present in both the sub-aleurone layer and 
the five to six layers of inner tissue which we examined; all were membrane bound, and 
showed the characteristic speckling which had been observed by Khoo and Wolf (1970) 
only in the sub-aleurone layer. Protein was not confined solely to the protein bodies and 
formed a matrix in the sub-aleurone layer and in the inner endosperm. The matrix protein 
was more intensely stained than the protein body protein, however, the total volume of the 
protein bodies was far in excess of that of the matrix. 
The storage protein of maize consists of alcohol-soluble protein (zein) and acid/alkali 
soluble glutclin which may consist of more than one protein. Zein is laid down in the protein 
protein bodies of the endosperm and glutelins form a matrix in the endosperm cells (Wolf, 
Khoo and Seckinger, 1967). Both protein types are extracted by SDS. 
The gel protein profiles of SDS-2Me extracts of meals from the whole seed, endosperm 
and embryo of the early maize show that the endosperm pattern is very similar to that 
of the whole seed meal indicating that little if any embryo protein is present in the latter; 
SDS patterns of the embryo confirm this but show that they do contain a small amount of 
protein. Also included in Fig. 1 is the gel pattern of a modern maize, and comparison with 
the early maize pattern shows that protein subunits similar to those of modern maize are 
present in the early maize. The subunit structures of zein and glutelin fractions extracted 
from the early maize by use of the appropriate solvents have been established hy SDS gel 
electrophoresis Fig. 1, e-g). When these are compared with subunit profiles of similar 
fractions from modern maize, for example those of Paulis, Bietz and Wall (1975), it can be 
seen that although the profiles are not identical the subunit structures of zein and most of 
the glutelin fraction have been preserved in the early material. The relative proportions of 
the protein types are different, see Fig. la, in that early maize contains proportionately less 
glutelin than modern maize. Further support for this suggestion comes from a consideration 
of the amino acid composition data of the two meals (Table 1). These are very similar in-
dicating the presence of the same type of proteins but differ in the proportionally lower 
lysine and methionine and proportionally higher leucine in early maize, probably explicable 
by the fact that glutelin contains relatively more lysine and methionine and less leucine than 
zein (Paulis and Wall, 1971; Mertz, 1972). The alcohol-insoluble glutelin (AIG) obtained 
from early maize in this investigation consisted of a smaller number of subunits than that 
obtained from AIG of a modern maize by Paulis et al., (1975). also the most prominent

subunits in gels of the early maize AIG were more mobile than those of the modern AIG. 
Since subunits in the latter fraction ranged in molecular weight up to 127,000 daltons, 
which is an unusually large value for individual polypeptide chains (Smith, 1966), it is 
possible that the dissociation achieved by Paulis et al, (1975) was incomplete. 
The results of this investigation demonstrate the possibility of extracting proteins from 
archaeological samples for use in cultural studies and in botanical studies of crop plant

ABSTRACT 
Storage globulins contribute 80-90% of the seed protein of many legumes and 
consist principally of two proteins called vicilin and legumin in peas. The relative 
proportions of the two proteins has been shown to differ in different legumes by 
gel-electrophoresis. The essential amino acid composition of vicilin and leguinin of 
Pisuin and Vicia differ and the possible significance of these findings to screening 
strategies for improved legume programmes was discussed. 
Cowpeas were grown in growth cabinets under standard environmental conditions. 
Seeds were shown to have the same percentage nitrogen and sulphur on a dry-weight 
basis, irrespective of the position of the pod on the plant, indicating that legume seeds 
may have a conservative biochemistry. 
Legume seeds may contain up to 50% protein on a dry-weight basis. Most 
of this protein, of the order of 8090%, is contributed by the seed storage 
globulins (Osborne, 192$), which have been operationally divided into two 
fractions, called legumin and vicilin in peas (Osborne, 192^ Danielsson, 
1949). Proteins with similar properties occur in a wide range of legumes 
(Danielsson, 1949; Altschul, Yatsu, Ory& Englemann, 1966; Boulter & 
Derbyshire, 1971). Because of their physiological role, it is likely thai stor-
age proteins are complex (see Bailey & Boulter, 1971), and, in fact, those of 
several legume species, e.g. Pisum sativum, Vicia faba, Qcer arietinum, Gly-
cine max and Arachis hypogea, have been shown to be made up of sub-units 
(see Boulter & Derbyshire, 1971). 
Amino acid analyses of, and rat-feeding experiments with a variety of 
legume meals, indicate thai the sulphur-amino acids, cysteine and methio-
nine, are usually the first-limiting amino acids nutritionally (see Aykroyd & 
Doughty, 1964), and this is a reflection of the fact that the storage globu-
lins, the major proteins of the meal, are low in sulphur-amino acids. 
This paper discusses the proteins of developing legume seeds, in relation-

ship to possible strategies for screening in breeding programmes for im-
proved grains legumes. Several different legumes are used as examples. 
RESULTS 
Table I gives the amino acid compositions of vicilin and legumin of Pi stun 
and Vicia. It can be seen that with regard to the essential amino acids, 
legumin of both species is higher than vicilin in the sulphur-aniino acids and 
tryptophan, but lower in isoleucine, lysine and phenylalanine. The remain-
ing essential amino acids are in, more or less, the same proportion in the two 
fractions. 
The results given in Fig. 1 show that vicilin and legumin do not occur in 
the same relative proportions in different legumes, and that sometimes one 
and sometimes the other predominates. 
We are presently attempting to use total sulphur as a measure of the 
sulphur-amino acid content of different varieties of cowpeas (Boulter, 
Evans, Thompson & Yarwood, 1972). In collaboration with Drs. Hughes 
and Summerfield of the Plant Environment Laboratory of the University of

Reading, we have analysed the percentage nitrogen and percentage sulphur 
of the seeds of pods at various nodes of cowpeas grown, by them, under 
standard conditions in growth cabinets (daylength 12 h. 30, day tempera-
ture 30, night temperature 21.5). These results show that the percentage 
nitrogen and percentage sulphur of seeds in pods at different nodes on the 
same plant and in pods on different plants, have, within 10% limits, the same 
percentage nitrogen and percentage sulphur on a dry-weight basis. These 
results indicate that legume seeds are biochemically conservative and that 
seeds are produced which conform to the average, otherwise abortion takes 
place. In our analyses we have ignored aborted seeds which represent less 
than 0.1% of the total dry weight of the seeds of a pod. 
DISCUSSION 
Opaque 2, a high lysine maize with an improved nutritional status, has an 
increased ratio of glutelin to prolamin as compared to normal strains, i.e. a 
change has taken place in the relative proportions of the storage proteins. 
By analogy, nutritionally improved grain legumes would be obtained i f in a 
variety of a legume such as Pisum or Vicia, the ratio of legumin to vicilin 
were increased in the mature seed, since, as can be seen from the results in 
Table I , legumin contains more sulphur-amino acids than vicilin. How far the 
sulphur-amino acid patterns of vicilin and legumin of Pisum and Vicia can 
be extrapolated to these same protein fractions in other legumes, is uncer-
tain, due to difficulties in separating these two fractions cleanly. Since 
different proportions of these two proteins occur in different legume species 
(see Fig. 1), the potential for grain improvement by this route also differs. 
Vicilin and legumin are synthesised in the protein bodies of the devel-
oping seeds of Vicia faba (Briarty, Coult & Boulter, 1969; Bailey, Cobb & 
Boulter, 1970), also see Plates 14, and Graham and Gunning (1970) have 
shown, using serological methods, that both proteins are laid down in the

same protein bodies. This situation is not directly comparable therefore, 
w i th that o f maize, where prolamin is laid down in the protein body but 
glutelin appears as a matrix protein. Thus, the chances o f obtaining legume 
lines wi th changed proportions o f storage proteins, may prove more d i f f i -
cult. 
Vici l in is soluble at pH 4.7 (Danielsson, 1949), whereas legumin is not. 
Unfortunately, complete separation of vicilin and legumin cannot be 
achieved by this method since not all the vicilin dissolves at p i I 4.7, nor 
does all the legumin remain insoluble (unpublished work on Vicia, Phaseolus 
and Vigna). However, comprehensive variations in ionic strength and type o f 
ion have not been fu l ly investigated and, i f pursued, might lead to the 
elucidation of conditions where there was a virtual complete extraction of 
vicilin at pH 4.7. I f this were so, a screening procedure which determined 
the total nitrogen of meal after extraction at pll 4.7, would, in fact, be a 
screening procedure for legumin content, and meals which gave high nitro-
gen values would be high legumin-containing varieties and hence, with some 
legumes, be varieties with a high sulphur-amino acid content. 
Since legumes are not eaten alone, improved grain legume programmes 
must be considered in the context of the whole diet. Lines of Vicia and 
Pisum which result from an increased proportion of legumin to vicilin will 
have relatively less of the essential amino acids, lysine, isoleucine and phe-
nylalanine, and, if incorporated into a diet, might in some circumstances 
lead to an overall deterioration in its nutritional value, e.g. cereal-based diets 
with limiting lysine. If , therefore, it is accepted that lines with changed 
proportions of vicilin and legumin are likely to be selected in screening 
programmes, it is essential to consider the overall amino acid composition of 
the diet in which these are to be incorporated and not to assume that 
increased sulphur-amino acid content will necessarily be beneficial. 
Danielsson (1952) using peas, and Wright & Boulter (1972) Vicia faba, 
have shown that the onset of the synthesis of the two storage proteins does 
not occur simultaneously in the developing seeds; for example, in Vicia 
faba, vicilin was formed prior to legumin, although the rate of synthesis of 
the latter was faster, so that in the mature seed the ratio of legumin to 
vicilin was about 4 : 1 by weight. These results indicate that these proteins 
arc under separate genetic control and by analogy with Opaque 2, support 
the suggestion that lines with changed proportions of storage protein may 
well exist or be generated in breeding programmes. The question, however, 
still remains to be answered as to how much change can take place in the 
pattern of seed proteins without loss of viability etc. Probably in the case of 
the storage proteins which supply nitrogen for the developing seed, the 
scope for change without loss of function is much greater than for an 
enzymic protein. The latter, for full activity, has to conform to a strict 
three-dimensional shape, which depends on the amino acid sequence. Where-
as, provided changes in the amino acid composition of storage proteins do 
not make them indigestible, and providing the resulting pool of amino acids 
can be used by the germinating seed enzyme systems to provide the nitrogen 
building block for synthesis, these changes would be tolerated. The results 
in Fig. 1 show, in fact, that different legume genera do have different pro-
portions of these two proteins, and it is likely this situation could occur in 
different varieties of the same species. 
The changing pattern of protein synthesis in the developing seed under-
lines the importance of analysing seeds for their amino acid composition at 
the same physiological development stage, if comparisons between different 
varieties are to be meaningful. 
The other major protein fraction of legume seeds is the albumin fraction 
(see Boulter & Derbyshire, 1971). Although albumin proteins have not been 
fully separated and characterised, it is generally accepted that the various 
enzymes of the seed occur with this fraction. Separations of the albumins of 
various legume seeds on polyacrylamide gels normally give electrophore-
tograms with 2030 protein staining bands (Fox, Thurman& Boulter, 
1964). In the case of Pisum about ten of these are major bands, and in 
Vicia, about 8 (unpublished observations). This figure contrasts strongly 
with the probable total number of albumin proteins, which is of the order 
of several thousand, if we include all of the enzymic proteins of seeds. It is 
not clear therefore, whether each band on an electrophoretogram consists of 
one or many proteins. However, making the assumption that there are, in 
the case of Pisum, 10 major proteins representing some-50% of the albumin 
present, in our view an upper estimate, this would mean that any one 
albumin protein could only represent of the order of less than one percent 
of the total protein of the seed. Lines containing this protein with increased 
sulphur-containing amino acids, therefore, would not play a very significant 
part in increasing the overall sulphur-amino acid content of the meal. Thus, 
varieties containing albumin proteins with an improved amino acid profile, 
which is reflected in the amino acid profile of the whole meal, will not be 
detected very readily. It is for these reasons thai we feel priority should be 
given to screening strategies based upon analyses of the whole meal, for 
example, total sulphur or to those based on theoretical considerations of the 
globulin fraction, such as those outlined above. However, proteins do occur 
in legumes with high sulphur-amino acid content, e.g. the blue protein-of 
Phaseolus vulgaris (Pusztai, 1966). Further, urease in Jackbean (which has a 
sulphur-amino acid content similar to Smith's (1966) standard protein 
(Bailey & Boulter, 1971), may contribute as much as 1% of the dry weight 
of seed. 
_It is often said that methionine is usually the first limiting amino acid of 
legumes. However, it is important, in our view, to consider the two sulphur 
amino acids together, as cysteine can spare methionine. In cowpeas the 
methionine contents of vicilin and legumin are about the same, whereas that 
of cysteine in vicilin is much lower (unpublished data), and much of the 
supplemented methionine used in rat-feeding experiments with cowpea 
meals, is used to supply cysteine (Boulter, Evans, Thompson & Yarwood, 
1972). Probably, in this case, screening for cysteine content may prove 
more useful than screening for methionine content as a first priority, al-
though screening for both would be the best course of action. 
The results obtained with cabinet-grown cowpeas shows that sampling 
may not be a major problem and that gene/environment interaction may 
not be a grossly distorting factor in screening programmes with cowpcas. 
SUMMARY 
The storage proteins, vicilin and legumin, of Vigna aureus, V. mungo, Cajanus cajan, 
Pliaseolus hmatus, P. vulgaris and Vicia faba, were separated on polyacrylamide gels by 
electrophoresis and the relative proportions of these two proteins shown to vary in 
different species. Consideration of the amino acid compositions of vicilin and legumin of 
Pisum and Vicia, shows that the essential amino acids, cysteine, methionine and trypto-
phan, are higher in legumin than in vicilin, whereas isoleucine, lysine and phenylala-
nine, are lower. By analogy with high lysine corn, it was suggested that lines with 
relatively high sulphur amino acid patterns could contain an increased proportion of 
legumin to vicilin. The implications of this for devising screening procedures was dis-
cussed, and it was emphasized that the overall essential amino acid composition of the 
diet as a whole, has to be considered before a screening strategy can be decided. Work 
with Vicia faba has shown that vicilin and legumin are synthesised at different rates in 
the developing seed, suggesting that the proteins are under separate genetic control. 
Vigna unguicuiata seeds were grown in growth cabinets under standard environ-
mental conditions. Seeds were shown to have the same percentage nitrogen and sulphur 
on a dry-weight basis, irrespective of the position of the pod on the plant. These results 
indicate the possiblity that legume seeds may have a conservative biochemistry, and 
that under normal conditions, an average type seed is produced. Under other con-
ditions, some average seeds will be produced, but the plant will 'compensate' by 
abortion of some pods and seeds.

DISCUSSION 
Professor Persson (As/Norwegen) 
I like to see your paper f r o m a plant breeding point o f view. From the varietal 
difference in Vicia faba, can i t be suggested that great improvement can be expected in 
terms of food value? 
Secondly as you have pointed out that the synthetic systems of legumin and vicilin 
arc different, is there any information as to the genetic nature o f genetic control o f the 
synthesis o f globulins, as this w i l l be o f interest for plant breeders. 
Professor Boulter (Durham/G.B.) 
The question as to whether there already exists in the world collections of different 
legumes, sufficient variation fo r exploitation via breeding programmes, to give crops 
wi th greatly improved food values, has not been f u l l y investigated. However, present 
indications are that this is likely to be so and this includes our own experiences wi th 
Vicia faba. 
With regard to the second question, at the moment we do not know the genetic 
nature of the control systems for the synthesis o f vicilin and legumin. 
McSheehy (Haughley/G.B.) 
You have shown very clearly that the production o f legumin lags behind that of 
vic i l in . In view o f that could there be gene environment interaction. In other words has 
one a situation where the production o f legumin cannot commence unti l the intra-
cellular environment contains a predetermined level o f vicilin? Have we a situation 
where a 'repressor gene' controlling the opcron for legumin synthesis is 'switched-off 
by vicilin? I f this is possible then there may be problems associated wi th trying to alter 
the final relative concentrations o f the two proteins. 
Professor Boulter (Durham) 
A l l that can be said at this stage, is that the syntheses o f vici l in and legumin are 
switched on at different times. The particular mechanism of the control is not known. 
I f the mechanism is as suggested by Mr. McSheehy, then an alteration in the f inal 
relative concentration o f these proteins would have to be effected by their rates o f 
synthesis, which arc different , rather than changing the times at which their synthesis is 
switched on. However, there arc very many other possible control mechanisms.

Professor Boulter (Durham) 
I am afraid I am unable to answer your question, apart f r o m saying that lupin, 
including the species Lupinus albus. contains vicilin and legumin-type proteins, but we 
have not investigated their proportions or times of synthesis.. 
Professor Scliuphan (Geisenheim) 
You pointed out that the contents o f cystine in Vicia faba have been found tenfold 
in legumin in comparison wi th vicil in. 
M far as I have taken f rom your table this relation is reverse in methionine. A m I 
right? 
Professor Boulter (Durham) 
No. The values for the sulphur amino acids arc given in Table 1 of my paper, and, in 
fact, legumin contains about twice as much methionine as does vici l in.

Abs t rac tAn I I S seed g lobul in has been isolated f r o m Phaseolus aureus and P. vulgaris by zonal isoelectric precipi-
ta t ion and the M W s o f the constituent subunits determined. The protein o f P. vulgaris occurs in ihc protein 
body f ract ion and its chemical composi t ion , inc luding the - terminal amino acids and amino acid composi t ion 
has been determined. The s imi lar i ty between the I I S g lobul in o f the two Phaseolus spp. and legumin f r o m other 
legumes is discussed. 
I N T R O D U C T I O N 
Legumin , an I I S g lobu l in first isolated as an impure frac-
t ion f r o m seeds o f Pisum sativum [1 ,2 ] has been pur i f ied 
f r o m Vkiafaha seeds where it represents approximately 
75% o f the storage protein [ 3 - 5 ] . Legumin- l ikc globulins 
are also ma jo r seed storage proteins o f other legume spe-
cies for example Vicia saliva [ 6 ] and Glycine max [ 7 - 9 ] 
and they probably occur widely among f lower ing 
p l a n t s [ 1 0 ] . G lobu l ins which sediment as U S c o m -
ponents have been identif ied in several species o f Pha-
seolus and were equaled w i t h legumin by Danielsson 
solely on the basis o f their sedimentation coefficients [ 2 ] . 
The only species o f Phaseolus f r o m which an I I S g lobu-
l in has been isolated previously is P. aureus [ 1 1 ] and 
the subuni i composi t ion reported for this g lobu l in differs 
f r o m that o f legumin-like globulins. 
W e have now isolated a legumin-l ike g lobul in ' f r o m 
Phaseolus aureus and P. vulgaris and have characterized 
that of the latter species. 
R E S U L T S 
The crude g lobul in preparations f r o m Phaseolus vul-
garis and P. aureus were each separated in to two protein 
fract ions by zonal isoelectric precipi ta t ion [5 ,12] . One o f 
these fractions consisted o f protein which was soluble 
at p H 4-7 and eluled f r o m the c o l u m n in a volume of 
50 m l immediately after the void volume (130 ml) . while 
the other consisted o f protein insoluble at p H 4-7 and 
which was substantially retarded (Vt approximate ly equal 
to 2-5 V,) and clutcd in a volume o f 90 m l . The retarded 
f rac t ion f r o m each species accounted for approximately 
15% of the protein recovered (250/300 mg) and was 
homogeneous in the ul t raccntr i fuge (.s'20 approx. I I S ) 
except for traces (approx. 5%) o f a larger component (.s-20 
approx. 16S). By comparison the Linretarded protein was 
heterogeneous at p H 7 in the ul t raccntr i fugc and for bo th 
species the Schlieren diagrams showed a large 7S peak 
which was not completely resolved f r o m a small 2S-3S 
peak: a 6S shoulder was also present in the 7S peak 
of P. vulgaris. W h e n the unretarded f ract ion o f P. vulgaris 
was examined in the ul t racenir i fuge at p H 6-2 and 
1 = 0 1 5 more than 50% o f the 7S component observed 
at p H 7 was replaced by a peak which corresponded 
to I8S protein and under these condi t ions the sedimen-
tat ion coefficient of the 6S component o f P. vulgaris was 
6- IS i.e. it had a calculated M W of approximately 
130000. The unretarded prote in o f P. aureus d i d not as-
sociate to 18S at p H 6-2 and 1 = 0 1 5 . Agglu t ina t ing ac-
t iv i ty was delected on ly in the unretarded f ract ions: agg-
lu t ina t ion by that o f P. vulgaris was more rapid than 
by that o f P. aureus. 
The protein o f the retarded f rac t ion f r o m each species 
migrated du r ing disc electrophoresis as a m a j o r band 
w i t h mob i l i t y 0 1 5 relative to that o f the bromophenol 
blue marker band and t w o slower and one faster mino r 
bands. The proteins were dissociated by treatment w i t h 
sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and 2-mercaptoethanol 
(2Mc) in to m a j o r subunits w i t h apparent M W s 62000 
and 20000: only trace amounts o f slain were retained 
by these subunits when half gels were stained fo r glyco-
protein by ihe PAS procedure. 
Further characterization was then carried out on Ihe 
protein recovered f r o m the retarded f ract ion o f bo th spe-
cies. The protein was first precipitated by the addi t ion 
o f ( N H 4 ) 2 S 0 4 to 70% saturation and then redissolvcd 
in a small volume o f 0 01 M 2-Me. This method o f recov-
ery was used rather than precipi ta t ion by dialysis since 
protein precipitated by dialysis against dcionized water

Zona l isoelectric precipi ta t ion has been employed pre-
viously t o isolate pure legumin f r o m prote in precipitated 
by a m m o n i u m sulphate precipitat ion f r o m in i t ia l extracts 
o f Vicia fabu [ 5 ] and V. sativa [12,13] . However we have 
found i l necessary, when isolating the 1 IS globulins f r o m 
Phuseolus spp. by this procedure to first remove small 
molecules f r o m the in i t i a l extracts by molecular sieving 
and also to inh ib i t oxidat ive processes. The 1 IS globul ins 
isolated f r o m Phaseolus aureus and P. vulgaris are insolu-
ble at p H 4-7 at / = 0-3 and they each have sedimen-
tat ion coefficients, M W s and subunit sizes which are 
similar to those o f legumin of Vicia faba[5'\ and V. 
saliva [13 ,14] . The U S g lobul in o f P. vulgaris and legu-
m i n o f V. faba are s imilar in amino acid composi t ion, 
N - t e r m i n a l amino acids and in their low content o f 
carbohydrate. 
The N - t e r m i n a l amino acids o f legumin o f members 
o f the Vicicac arc glycine, leucine and threo-
nine [3.5,13.15,16] and ihose o f Glycine, max arc gly-
cine, leucine and phenylalanine [ 8 ] : un l ike the si tuat ion 
in Phaseolus vulgaris therefore, N - l e r m i n a l methionine 
Isolation of a Icgumin-likc protein 413 
has not been reported in these leguinins. Several explana-
tions for the apparent finding o f A'- terminal methionine 
can be proposed. It may be there as a true A'- tcrminal 
o f the protein or it cou ld be a contaminant i f the protein 
were not completely pur i f ied . A fur ther possibili ty arises 
since the synthesis o f polypeptide chains in the cytoplasm 
of eukaryotes is ini t ia ted by /V-tenninal mc th iony l resi-
dues which are subsequently cleaved f r o m the completed 
chains [17,18] . Thus the fV-terminal mc th iony l residue 
detected may be the in i t i a t ing meth ionyl residue. 
The presence of contamina t ing material cou ld explain 
the low levels of carbohydrate found in several 11S 
g lobul in p r epa ra t i ons [10 ] ; however it could also ind i -
cate that leguinin contains a glycoprotein subunit. The 
carbohydrate content o f subunils isolated f r o m I I S 
globulins o f legumes have not been reported but a 2-7S 
subunit o f the i2S g iobu i in o f Brussica napus contains 
4 - 5 % carbohydrate [ 1 9 ] . 
The three banded pattern o f subunits w i th M W s 
37000. 34000 and 20000 found in SDS gels o f clissocialed 
I I S g lobul in f r o m Pliaseolus aureus and P. vulgaris is 
also found in dissociated legumin f r o m Vida falm [ 5 ] and 
V. saliva [ 1 4 ] . The subunit w i t h M W 62000 seen in some 
of the Phaseolus preparations w o u l d appear to be an 
association product and a component o f similar M W 
is also seen in dissociated legumin preparations f r o m V. 
faba and V. saliva under special condit ions. In dissociated 
I I S g lobul in f r o m Glycine max only t w o sizes of 
subunits, w i t h M W s 37000 and 22000 have been separ-
ated so far [ 9 ] . Dissociated U S g lobul in f r o m Lupinus 
august ifolius has subunits w i t h M W s 63000, 53000. 
40000 and 20000 which di f fer somewhat from the 
above [ 2 0 ] . However the complete dissociation and sep-
arat ion o f the U S g lobu l in subunils are very dependent 
on the condi t ions employed and a cr i t ical comparison 
can be made between subuni l composi t ions o f various 
globulins only when the latter have been dissociated un-
der identical condi t ions and their subunils examined by 
a variety o f techniques. 
The high ni trogen and d icarboxyl ic acid/amide con-
tents o f the I I S g lobu l in o f Pliuseolus vulgaris relative 
to those o f a standard protein [ 2 1 ] , its occurrence in the 
protein body f ract ion and its s imi lar i ty to legumin sug-
gest strongly that this protein is, l ike other legumins, 
a storage prote in . Whereas the U S globulins o f Vtcia 
faba and Glycine max contr ibute substantially to the 
nu t r i t iona l value o f these beans, the ma jo r g lobu l in o f 
Phaseoliis vulgaris is Glycopro te in I I [22,23] and legumin 
represents a much smaller p ropo r t i on o f the protein of 
these beans. However, the compos i t ion o f the storage 
proteins is different in different cult ivars of the same spe-
cies [ 2 4 - 2 7 ] and other cult ivars o f Phaseolus aureus ani l 
P. vulgaris may have higher legumin contents and be 
o f greater nu t r i t iona l value than those used in the present 
investigation. Procedures based on those employed here 
may play a part in screening programmes for the selec-
t ion of lines w i th improved nu t r i t iona l status. 
The unretarded fract ions w i l l not be discussed in detail 
here but the presence in Phaseolus aureus o f high concen-
trat ions o f 7S protein which does not associate to an 
18S molecular species suggests, cont rary to the sugges-
t ion of Ericson and Chrispeels [ 1 1 ] , that this protein is 
not identical to the 7S Glycopro te in I I o f P. vul-
garis [ 2 2 ] . Agglut in ins w i t h sedimentation coefficients of 
approximately 6S have also been isolated from P. vul-
garis [28.29] and it is probable that these were the pro-
teins or the unrelarded fraction which sedimcnted as 6.IS 
species. 
The G l f rac t ion o f ascorbatc extracts prepared f r o m 
Phaseolus vulgaris by Sun el al. [30.31] is regarded by 
them as Glycopro te in I I and an I I S protein was not 
detected, a l though Ihey had reported previously that the 
sedimentation coefficient o f G l (32) was I I S . The 
subunits identif ied in dissociated G l protein were also 
ma jo r components o f a dissociated G l f rac t ion prepared 
by isoelectric precipi ta t ion [ 3 1 ] and they equate G l y c o -
protein I I procedurally w i th legumin [ 3 1 ] . By contrast 
the G I A f rac t ion which we isolated was heterogeneous 
and contained U S protein. 7S protein (Glycoprote in I I ) , 
and possibly a g lobu l in agglut inin. The I I S globulins 
which have been isolated from various species as (rela-
tively) pure proteins are very similar to legumin of Vwia 
faba when characterized by modern biochemical tech-
niques [ 1 0 ] . They have similar sedimentation coefficients, 
M W s , subunit sizes, amino acid composi t ion , N- t e rmina l 
amino acids, low contents o f carbohydrate and low solu-
bilities at p H 4-7 al / = 0-3, and we regard them al l 
as legumin by analogy w i t h other well characterized pro-
teins, for example the haemoglobins, a l though only when 
their amino acid sequences have been determined w i l l 
it be clear whether they are funct ional ly s imilar 
proteins or whether Ihey arc a group of proteins related 
by a c o m m o n ancestry.

Isolation of 115 globulins. Seed meals of Phuseolits aureus 
(green gram) and P. vulgaris cv. "Streamline", were dispersed 
with 10 g insoluble polyvinyl-pyrrolidone in 0-4 M NaCI-001 
M 2 M c - 0 l M N a H 2 P 0 4 p H 7 (10g meal/100 ml), and were 
blended for 3 min in a high-speed blender which was cooled 
in ice. and then stirred for IS min. Each extract was filtered 
through 2 layers of muslin and clarilicd by ccnlrifugation, then 
60 ml clarified extract, containing approximately I g protein 
was applied to a column of Sephadcx G-25 (6-6 cm x 20 cm), 
which had been equilibrated with 0-2 M NaCI-0035 M N a H 2 
P 0 4 pH 7-0-01 M 2 Me. The column was developed wi lh the 
latlcr buffer. The chromatographic fractions which contained 
protein excluded from the Sephadcx G-25 were bulked and 
adjusted to 70% saturation with respect to (N1-I 4 ) 2 S0 4 and 
the protein which precipitated was quickly collected by ccntri-
fugation and redispcrscd in 10 ml 0-2 M NaCI-0 05 M 
N a H 2 P 0 4 : pH 8-0-01 M 2 Me (pH 8 bulTer soln). Ammonium 
sulphate was removed from (he protein soln by passing it 
through a column (3-4 x 20 cm) of Scphadcx G-25, which had 
been equilibrated wilh Ihe pH 8 bulTer solution. After live-fold 
concentration of the protein solution by use of an Amicon 
ultrafiltration cell 8 ml, containing approximately 300 mg pro-
tein, was applied to a column (3-4 x 35 cm) of Sephadex G-50 
which had been equilibrated with 0-2 M NaCI-0-05 M citric 
acid pl-l 4-7-001 M 2 Mc and the column was then developed 
wilh (he pH 8 buffer solution (zonal iso-clcclric precipitation 
(12)) at a flow rale of 25 ml/hr. Buffer solns which were 
employed had been dcacralcd and flushed wilh N 2 before the 
addition of 2 Me and were stored under N . The Sephadex 
used for chromatography had been dcacratcd before equilib-
ration. Column eluatcs were monitored continuously at 
280 nm by use of an L K B Uvicord I I analyser. 
Ascorhate extract. An ascorbate extract of meal of Phaseulus 
vulgaris was prepared by the method of McLccslcr el al. [32] 
and clarified by cenirifugalion. The clarified extract was 
diluted with two volumes of dionized water al 4 and the 
protein which precipitated was collected by ccnlrifugalion and 
designated Ihe GIA fraction. 
Protein boilies. These were isolated by ccnlrifugation 
through glycerol, a method suggested by M . J. Chrispcels.

Seed meal (500 my) of Phaseolus vulgaris was suspended in 
5 ml 80% glycerol in 0 05 M N a H 2 P 0 4 pH 8 and centrifuged 
at 3000 tj for 20 min and then at 23 000 g for 20 min. The 
supernatant was layered over 10 ml 90% glycerol in the same 
buffer and centrifuged al 23000g for 20 min. The pellet was 
resuspended in 5 ml 80% glycerol in buffer, large aggregates 
of material were removed by low speed centrifugation and 
the protein bodies were pelleted at 23000g. 
Analytical centrifugal Urn. This was carried out al 40000 
rpm and 20 in an Omega I I 70000 ultracentrifuge. Proteins 
were cemrifuged al concentrations of 5 mg/ml and I mg/ml 
and sedimentation cocllicienls. s, 0 and s20v, values were deter-
mined as described by Svcdbcrg and Pedersen [33] . The Sch-
lieren peaks obtained at the lower protein concentration were 
loo small for accurate measurement and values quoted in the 
texl were obtained at concentrations of 5 mg/ml, except where 
slated otherwise. Approximate MW's were calculated by the 
method of Halsall [34;]. 
Dissocial ion of protein. Equal volumes of protein soln 
(2 mg/ml) and 2 ;5% SDS-01 M 2 Me-0 05 M Pi buffer pH 7 
were mixed and heated for 3 min in a boiling water bath 
and then cooled in running tap water. Myoglobin was 
employed as a marker protein and after healing in 
SDS-2Me-Pi butler pH 7. i l was added lo a portion of each 
dissociated protein sample lo a final concenlration of 
0-7 mg/ml. 
Polyairylamide-gel electrophoresis. Undissociated proteins 
were examined in 7-5% gels by the procedure of Omstein and 
Davis [35] bin without the use of spacer gel. Dissociated pro-
teins. 20/ i l and 80yil vols, were loaded under buffer onto 10% 
gels of 60 mm length in a continuous 0 1 M Pi, pH 7-10 m M 
sodium ihiogiycolate system (11,31): 15 mA/gel was main-
tained for 3 hr. Gels were stained for protein in 1% (w/v) 
Amido Black in 7% HOAc and dcslained by diffusion in 7% 
HOAc. Certains gels, on which the subunits of I I S globulin 
had been separated, were split longitudinally and one half of 
each gel was stained for protein while the other was stained 
for glycoprotein by the periodic acid-Schifls base pro-
cedure [37] . The eleclrophorelic mobilities of the subunils 
relative to that of the marker protein were determined after 
staining and the apparent MW's of the subunits were esti-
mated by reference to a calibration curve prepared using cyto-
chrome c, myoglogin. pepsin, ovalbumin and serum albumin. 
Agglutinin activity. Protein fractions were adjusted lo pH 7 
and a protein concentration of I mg/ml and then mixed with 
an equal vol of a 2% suspension of human group O red blood 
cells in 1% NaCI at RT. 
Chemical composition. Total notrogen was determined by 
an automated micro-Kjcldahl method [38] , and total sulphur 
was estimated by wet digestion with perchloric-nitric acid mix-
ture, and subsequent turbidimelric analysis of BaSOj [39]. 
Carbohydrate was determined by the method of Dubois el 
al. [40] . The amino acid composition of acid hydrolysed (20 
and 70 hr) protein was analysed on a Locarle automatic load-
ing amino acid analyser. Tryptophan was determined colori-
inelrically [41] and cysteine plus cystine were determined by 
performic acid oxidation [42] and subsequent analysis of cys-
leic acid on the Locarle analyser. A'-Terminal amino acids 
were determined by the procedure of Gros and Laboucssc 
[ 4 3 ] ; after hydrolysis each sample was loaded on one side 
of a polyamidc sheet, a mixture of dansylated amino acids 
was loaded onto the reverse side and the A'-lerminal amino 
acids of the sample were identified after chromatographic sep-
aration by reference to the pattern obtained from the amino 
acid mixture.

AbstractSeveral extract ion and f rac t ionat ion procedures have been employed to isolate the major storage proteins 
of mature seeds o f Phaseolus vuUjuris cv. "Seafarer"; three proteins which were soluble at p H 4.7. and one that 
was insoluble at that pH were identif ied. The characteristic subunits o f the three p H 4.7 soluble proteins had 
M W s 50000 and 47000 : 32000, and 23000 respectively: those o f the p H 4.7 insoluble fractions had M W 60000 
and 20000. A m i n o acid composit ions, A'- tcrminal amino acid residues and the presence o f carbohydrate in these 
proteins have been determined. A l l these proteins occurred in the protein body f ract ion and their relative amounts 
were different in the outer and central parts of the cotyledons.

Protein laid d o w n dur ing seed development and uti l ized 
as a nitrogen and carbon source du r ing germinat ion is 
termed storage pro te in : in legumes 80% o f the seed pro-
tein may be storage protein. Pusztai has pur i f ied and 
characterized several seed proteins f r o m Phaseolus vul-
f /  n ' s [ l - 4 ] and Racusen and Foote [ 5 ] and H a l l and his 
associates [ 6 - 8 ] have also investigated the seed storage 
proteins of this species: an I I S storage protein f r o m P. 
vulgaris has recently been described [ 9 ] . However, when 
interpret ing previously described results, problems arise 
since the variety of methods of isolation and pur i f ica t ion 
used make comparison d i f f icu l t . Also , the relationship 
of a pur i f ied f ract ion to the to ta l protein complement 
is often unclear, and the analytical methods used, e.g. 
u l t raccntr i fugat ion, often do not unequivocally ident i fy 
the protein. 
In this investigation of the storage proteins o f Pha-
seolus vulgaris, sodium dodccyl sulphate (SDS)-polvacryl-
amidc gel electrophoresis has been used to identify the 
component subunils and to assess the pur i ty o f the pro-
tein fractions obtained. The intracellular localization of 
the storage proteins and their d i s t r ibu t ion wi th in the 
cotyledons has also been determined.

band. Rm 0.35-0.4. and in addi t ion there were prominent 
components. R, 0.19. 0.1, and several other minor com-
ponents. A densitonietric trace, o f the protein band pat-
tern obtained by SDS-gcl electrophoresis o f this extract 
is shown in Fig. I . There arc two main subunits, M W 
50000 and 47000, but four other prominent components, 
M W 60000, 32000, 23000 and 20000 are also present. 
SDS extraction and eleclroplioretic analysis or meal gave 
a similar clectrophorelic prof i le . SDS extractions o f meal 
o f a different cul t ivar . "Canadian Wonder" , gave a s imi-
lar subunit pattern, except that in this cul t ivar the equiv-
alent subunits to the 50000 and 47000 M W components 
were of lower M W . 49000 and 45000 respectively, and 
an addi t ional major band o f M W 53000 was present.

The prccipiuitc, obui ined f r o m alkaline salt extracts 
by addi t ion of a m m o n i u m sulphate to 70% saturation, 
was enriched in the 60000, 32000, 23000 and 20000 M W 
subunits. T w o fractions were obtained by zonal isoelec-
tric precipitat ion of the redissolved precipitate: one 
elated immediately after the vo id volume, in citrate 
buffer pH 4.7. and was p H 4.7 soluble; the second frac-
t ion which accounted for approximate ly 20% of the pro-
tein applied to the co lumn, was insoluble at pH 4.7. and 
was retarded dur ing chromatography. When these frac-
tions were analysed by disc electrophoresis, the p H 4.7 
soluble Traction migrated as a major , poor ly defined 
band, Rm 0.35-0.4, w i th a subsidiary band Rm 0.19: the 
p H 4.7 insoluble f ract ion, which was poor ly soluble in 
the electrophoresis sample buffer, migrated as a single 
band R, 0.1. SDS gel electrophoresis showed that the 
major components of the in i t ia l extract, i.e. the M W 
50000 and 47000 components, together wi th the lower 
M W subunils of 32000 and 23000 M W were confined 
to the p H 4.7 soluble fract ion, and the pH 4.7 insoluble 
fract ion consisted almost entirely of subunits o f M W 
about 80000. 60000 and 20000. Th i s par t ia l pur i f ica t ion 
of components was conf i rmed when the main band cut 
f r o m the gel after disc electrophoresis o f an alkaline 
extract was shown, in the SDS gel system, to be mainly 
composed or 50000 and 47000 M W subunits. w i th smail 
amounts o f the 32000 and 23000 M W siibimits. It is o f 
interest to note that when the subsidiary band (R, 0.19). 
found on disc gel electrophoresis o f the p|- | 4.7 soluble 
f ract ion was similar ly cut out and analysed, it also con-
sisted of the 50000. 47000 and 32000 M W subunits. In 
the absence o f 2-mercapioethanol, the p H 4.7 insoluble 
f ract ion gave a single band of M W about 80000 on SDS 
gel electrophoresis; treatment w i t h 1% (v/v) 2-mercapto-
clhanol resulted in loss o f this component and the con-
comitant appearance o f subunits o f M W 60000 and 
20000, but a small amount or the 80000 M W band 
always remained. The p H 4.7 soluble f rac t ion gave the 
same band pattern in the presence or absence o f 2-mer-
captocthanol. Carboxymethyla t ion caused no change in 
the band pattern o f any fract ion. 
When alkaline salt extracts were chromatographed on 
DEAE-cellulose, the protein was separated into two frac-
tions. Unadsorbed protein was eluted as a small peak 
wi th the starting buffer and when analysed by disc elec-
trophoresis it gave a diffuse band R 0.27-0.39. together 
w i l l i a band migra t ing wi th the b iomo-phcno l blue 
marker, Rm 1.0; SDS gel electrophoresis showed this frac-
t ion to be main ly composed o f the 32000 M W subunit. 
Protein adsorbed to the co lumn was cluled as a large 
peak wi th 0.17 M N a C I ; while the leading edge o f the 
c lu l ion profi le was very sharp, a shoulder occurred on 
the t ra i l ing edge. Disc electrophoresis o f the leading edge 
o f this peak resulted in an intense band Rm 0.37, w i th 
a weak band R, 0 .21; the protein o f the t ra i l ing edge 
contained a s low-moving band Rm 0.1, in addi t ion to 
these components. The leading edge o f the main peak 
was shown by SDS gel electrophoresis" to conta in the 
subunits o f 50000 and 47000 M W . together w i th a trace 
of the 23000 M W subunit. The middle or the peak 
contained subuniis o f M W 80000, 60000, 50000, 47000 
and 20000, i.e. the 23000 M W subunit was absent from 
, this region o f the peak. The t ra i l ing edge contained al l 
the above subunits w i t h enrichment of a 2 3 0 0 0 M W 
subimit . The 32000 M W subunit was not observed in 
this peak. 
Rcchromatography o f fractions f r o m the leading edge 
o f the main peak Tailed to remove completely the trace 
amount o f the 23000 M W subunit present. When 
samples o f the t ra i l ing edge o f the peak were rechromato-
graphed. fract ions enriched in the 60000 and 20000 
subunits. relative to the 50000 and 47000 M W subunils. 
were obtained, but the hit ler subunits were stil l the major 
components on SDS gels. Al te ra t ion o f the pl-l at which 
chromatography was carried out. the dimensions of the 
co lumn, ihe amount o f protein applied, the l low rate, 
and the steepness o f the sodium chloride c lu t ion gra-
dient, all failed to give increased resolution o f the pro-
teins of the main peak. 
When samples of alkaline salt extracts were cenlr i -
fuged in sucrose density gradients a single broad peak 
was obtained, a l though some protein remained at the 
l op or the gradient. SDS gel electrophoresis o f fractions 
from the gradient showed thai (a) the pH 4.7 insoluble 
fraction subunils. M W 60000 and 20000. were confined 
to the lower edge or the peak: (b l as judged by SDS-gel 
electrophoresis, most ol" the 50000. 47000 and 
32000 M W subunits were found in ihc broad peak, 
a l though some protein composed of these subunits 
remained at the top o f ihc gradient: (c) while the protein 
which remained ai the top of the gradient was enriched 
in siibunits of M W 23000. traces o f subunits or this size 
were also seen on the SDS gels or fractions f r o m the 
main peak. 
Water extracts. When water extracts of meal were 
cooled a substantial c iyoprccipi ta tc formed. When ana-
lysed by disc electrophoresis this was found to he com-
posed or a main component which migrated as a wide 
band, Rm 0.35-0.4. together w i th a subsidiary band Rm 
0.2. The supernatant f l u i d after removal of the cryoprcci-
pilale contained approximately equal amounts of com-
ponents w i t h Rms 0.37 and 0.1. 
Subunit analysis by SDS gel electrophoresis showed 
that the cryoprote in consisted o f the 50000 and 
47000 M W subunils. w i t h traces or the 32000 and 
23000 M W subunits: when the supernatant f l u id after 
removal o f this protein was analysed, it contained an 
increased p ropor t ion or the 80000. 60000, 32000. 
23000 and 20000 M W subunils and about 30% or the 
total amount or the 50000 and 47 000 M W siibunits. 
When the c ryopro tc in was analysed on disc gels and the 
main band (Rm 0.35-0.4) cut from the gel and the protein 
analysed in Ihe SDS system, i i was shown to consist 
o f (he 50000 and 47000 M W subunits. w i th a very small 
amount (ca 3% of the lo ta l protein) o f the 23000 M W 
subunit ; ihe 32000 M W subuni l was not observed. 
When Ihe cryoprccipitate from a water extract was 
subjected to gel isoclcctric-focusing in 7 M urea over the 
p H range 3-6, at least eighteen bands were obtained in 
the p H region 5.0-5.75. However, s imilar ly complex pat-
terns were also obtained from the p H 4.7 soluble Traction 
on isoelectric focusing in 7 M urea gels. 
Acidic extracts. T w o acidic extract ion methods were 
used (sec Experimental) and both gave the same results 
when the extracts were examined by gel electrophoresis. 
When acidic extracts were subjected to disc electro-
phoresis, the patterns obtained were similar to those 
obtained wi th alkaline salt extracts, but o w i n g to the 
poorer resolution obtained as compared to SDS gels, 
detailed comparison was not profi table. SDS gel electro-
phorctic analysis showed thai the acidic extracts were 
also similar in subuni l content to alkaline salt extracts.

On f rac t ionat ion o f the acidic ascorbatc extract, 
subuniis or 80000. 60000 and 20000 M W were confined 
to the F - l f rac t ion (sec Experimental for terminology of 
fractions) but those o f M W 50000 and 47000 were round 
in all three fractions. The 23000 M W subunit was 
enriched in the F - I f rac t ion , while the 32000 M W subunit 
was confined to the F - I I Tractions. 
When acidic extracts were prepared in the absence o( 
ascorbale. the F - I Traction contained the same subunits 
as the F - I Traction f r o m the ascorbate-containing extrac-
t ion, but there was markedly less of the 50000 and 
47000 M W subunits, i.e. the 80000, 60000 and 20000 
subuniis were enriched. Whi l s t the presence or absence 
of ascorbatc had less effect on the composi t ion of the 
F - I I f rac t ion, nevertheless, in the absence of ascorbate 
the F - I la f rac t ion consisted almost entirely o f the 50000 
and 47000 M W subunits, and the F - l I b f rac t ion o f the 
32000 M W subunit. Using either extractant, the F - I I 
Tractions agglutinated human group O erythrocytes. 
In contrast to the s i tuat ion w i th acidic extracts, pro-
tein was not precipitated by two-Told d i lu t ion oT alkaline 
salt extracts. When the latter were dialyscd overnight 
against running tap water, a Traction w i t h subunits s imi-
lar to those oT the F - I Traction from the ascorbate-
containing extract was precipitated.

the p H 4.7 insoluble Traction (60000 and 20000 M W 
subunits), the non-absorbed Traction from DEAE-ce l lu -
lose ion-exchange chromatography (32000 M W subunii) . 
and the leading edge oT the main peak eluted du r ing 
ion-exchange chromatography (50000 and 47000 M W 
subuniis), arc presented in Table I . together w i l h the

Carbohydrate content. When SDS gels of the p H 4.7 
soluble and insoluble Tractions were stained Tor the pres-
ence oT carbohydrate, on ly the 50000, 36000 and 
32000 M W subunits took up stain. The 32000 M W 
subunit stained relatively s t rongly: the 3 6 0 0 0 M W 
subunit . which was an insignificant component on the 
gels when stained Tor protein, showed up as a prominent 
component on periodic acid-SchifT (PAS) staining. When 
gels of SDS extracts o f P. vulgaris cv. "Canadian 
Wonder" , were s imi lar ly stained, the 53000. 49000 and 
32000 M W subitnils look up slain. 
Protein composition of protein bodies 
SDS gel electrophoresis showed that a l l the main stor-
age protein subunits (see Fig. 1) were f o u n d in the pro-
tein body fract ion. Protein bodies sedimentcd du r ing su-
crose density gradient centr i fugat ion as an opaque band 
centred at approximately 80% (w/v) sucrose. When frac-
t iona i ion o f the gradient was moni tored at 280 nm, the 
protein body peak was usually symmetrical w i l h respect 
to 280 n m absorption. Occasionally shoulders o f appar-
ently more or less dense particles were observed, but 
no differences in subunit pattern were detected when 
these regions were analysed. O n l y aboul 10% or the pro-
tein applied to the gradients was recovered in the protein 
body fraction. A l l the subunits present in the protein 
body fraction were also found at the top oT the gradients. 
Isolat ion oT protein bodies w i th glycerol at p H 5.0 
resulted in a protein body fraction which accounted for 
approximately 40% o f the total protein extracted f r o m 
meal. The protein subunit composi t ion oT these protein 
body preparations resembled that oT those isolated by 
sucrose density gradient centriTugation but in contrast

portents were found in the supernatant. When the gly-
cerol procedure was carried out at p H 7.5, some o f the 
p H 4.7 insoluble f ract ion protein subunits were found 
in the supernatant, but at this p H the yield o f protein 
bodies was lower (about 25"' o f the protein present in 
the p H 5.0 protein body fract ion) and the protein body 
f rac t ion contained an even higher p ropo r t i on o f the p l l 
4.7 insoluble f ract ion subunits relative to the to ta l . 
Figure 2a is an electron micrograph o f prote in bodies 
prepared by sucrose gradient centr i fugat ion. The protein 
bodies arc membrane-bound, a l though the membranes 
o f several have been ruptured and leakage o f their con-
tents is apparent. In some protein bodies, distinct and 
often sharp protuberances (arrowed) arc found . 
Protein bodies prepared by the glycerol method at p H 
5.0 were more intact (Fig . 2b). and their membranes were 
more clearly defined. However, small fragments of cell 
wal l were present and protein bodies were frequently 
present in clusters, surrounded by cytoplasmic material . 
Protein distribution within the cotyledon 
Salt extracts f r o m abaxial sections of cotyledons were 
richer in protein than those f r o m the centre and trypsin 
inh ib i to r act ivi ty was also greater in the abaxial sections. 
N o t on ly is there relatively more protein in the abaxial 
por t ion o f the cotyledon, but the p r o p o r t i o n o f the 
subunits there differs f r o m that o f the central region. 
Thus, the abaxial region is enriched relative to the cen-
tral port ions in 60000 and 20000 M W subunits and im-
poverished in 32000 and 23000 M W subunils. By com-
parison w i th the whole seed the abaxial region has less 
47000 M W subunit relative to the 50000 M W subunil . 
In contrast, the adaxial surface contained relatively large 
amounts of 32000 and 23000 M W subunils when com-
pared w i th other parts of the seed. 
The d is t r ibut ion o f protein subunits established by the 
direct analysis o f SDS extracts o f different regions o f 
the cotyledon was conf i rmed when protein bodies were 
isolated, using the glycerol procedure at p H 5.0. and their 
constituent protein was analysed by SDS gel electro-
phoresis.

The ma jo r storage protein o f P. ritlgaris cv. "Seafarer"

tcin. Glycoprote in I I . f r o m P. nilguris and Racuscn and 
Footc [ 5 ] have equaled this protein wi th the major salt 
soluble protein of P. vulgaris on the evidence of disc 
electrophoresis and amino acid composi t ion. Al though 
the subunit composi t ion of Glycopro te in I I has not been 
reported, the s imilar i ty between the major purif ied pro-
tein o f this investigation and Glycopro te in I I in sedimen-
tation coefficient. :i<:<:nci:iiinn helinvionr and amino acid 
composit ions clearly indicate that i h c i are the same pro-
tein. Furthermore, a l though the mob i l i t y in 5" acryl-
amidc gels obtained by us (not given here) was slightly 
greater than that reported by Racuscn and Footc [ 5 ] . 
there was a general s imi lar i ty in the appearance of the 
band on disc electrophoresis in the two investigations. 
This major protein behaved as a c ryopro tc in and pre-
cipitated when a water extract was cooled to 0 4 . A 
vici l in (i.e. a 7S, p H 4.7 soluble protein) f r o m Pimm sati-
vum, which was cryoprccip i la led f r o m a water extract 
of the meal, has also been described [ 1 0 ] . In contrast, 
a cryoprotc in obtained f r o m water extracts o f Glycine 
; > K I . Y [ I I ] has been shown to be composed mainly of an 
I I S protein ( l cgumin - l i ke ) [12 ] . Cryoprcc ip i l a l ion has 
been used as an in i t ia l step in the pur i f ica t ion o f this 
protein [ 1 3 ] but the effectiveness of water as an extrac-
tant for seed proteins varies f r o m legume to legume [ 1 4 ] . 
A second pl-l 4.7 soluble f rac t ion , corresponding to 
the 6S f ract ion observed in the ul tracentr ifugc by Derby-
shire and Boulter [ 9 ] , was composed o f glycoprotein 
subunils w i t h M W approximate ly 32000. The amino acid 
composi t ion of this f rac t ion is in reasonable agreement 
w i th that o f the lectin (subunil M W 30000-32000) iso-
lated by Andrews [ 1 5 ] f r o m navy bean; a notable com-
mon feature is a low glutamic acid content as compared 
to the olher storage proteins o f this species. 
Recently, Pusztai and W a t t [ 4 ] have separated and 
part ia l ly characterized a number o f agglutinins f r o m P. 
vulgaris, which differ in their isoelectric points but are 
also characterized by low glutamic acid contents. I t 
wou ld appear, therefore, that the protein f ract ion de-
scribed in this investigation is related to the preparations 
The major storage proteins of Pluiseolus vulgaris 755 
of Pusztai and Wat t , but their precise relationship is not 
clear. 
The pl-1 4.7 insoluble f rac t ion obtained here hy zonal 
isoelectric precipitat ion is similar to thai described in 
greater detail by Derbyshire and Boulter [ 9 ] , i.e. i l is 
a legumin-l ike protein. It is the only one o f Ihe storage 
proteins described here that appears to contain in lcr -
suhuni i disulphide bonds. 
The presence of at least a fourth protein is suggested 
by the occurrence of subunits o f M W 23000 which can-
not be assigned to any of the three previously described 
proteins. Suhunits o f this size were found in two different 
Tractions dur ing ion-exchange chromatography and su-
crose density gradient ccnl r i fugat ion. One f rac t ion eluted 
and sedimeiitcd wi th Glycopro te in I I . while the other 
sedimenlcd more slowly and was eluted at a higher salt 
concenlra l iun du r ing ion-exchange chromatography. 
The use of an acidic cxtraclant cither w i t h or w i thou t 
ascorbatc lo prevent oxidat ion , has been advocated by 
Hal l and his associates [ 6 - X ] . These same procedures 
were used here but our interpretat ion o f the results is 
different lo thai of Hal l and his colleagues. We consider 
H a l l s G - I f ract ion lo be equivalent lo our F I and F l l a 
fractions (prepared in the absence o f ascorbate) com-
bined, i.e. to an impure preparation o f Glycopro te in I I . 
Hall 's G - l l f rac t ion, containing a single major subunit 
of M W 3.0000 appears similar to our F - H b which we 
equate w i th the agglutinins described f r o m Phascolus by 
Pusztai and Wat t [ 4 ] . The use of an acid extract ion 
method wi th Vicia J'aba led to ihc fo rma t ion of lower 
M W polypeptides [ 1 6 ] and the method cannot be recom-
mended for general use w i th legumes. 
Isoelectric focusing in urea gels of several g lobu l in 
preparations has led lo Ihe demonstrat ion o f more pro-
tein components than expected f r o m the results obtained 
wi th other methods [17 -19 ] and this is also true for the 
data on Glycopro te in I I presented here. I t is not possible 
lo say whether some components are artefacts caused 
by carbamylat ion [ 2 0 ] and/or deaniidation [ 2 1 ] or if. in 
fact, al l the components are native subunits. the complex-
ity o f the pattern resulting f r o m microhelerogeneity. 
possibly in the carbohydrate moiety [ 2 2 ] . 
The major storage proteins o f P. vulgaris described 
above have been shown to be located in the protein body 
preparations by the presence o f their suhunits and the 
protein bodies were morphologica l ly similar to those 
previously described HI situ by O p i k [ 2 3 ] . The glycerol 
method Tor protein body preparation is rapid and gives 
a higher yield than f r o m sucrose density gradient centr i -
fugat ion. but glycerol preparations appeared to be less 
pure. 
Differences in the amount o f protein in different parts 
of legume and cereal seeds have been reported [24 . 25] . 
Vogel and W o o d [ 2 6 ] demonstrated that the outer 
regions o f the cotyledons o f Phascolus vulgaris were 
richer in protein-bound sulphydryl groups than the inner 
regions: W o o d and Cole [ 2 7 ] subsequently showed that 
ind iv idua l disc elecirophoretic components were found 
in di tic rent ratios in the outer and central regions o f 
the cotyledons. We have conf i rmed the gradient o f pro-
tein and trypsin inh ib i tor act ivi ty described by Z i m m c r -
mann ei al. [ 2 5 ] and have shown differences in the d i s t r i -
bu t ion o f storage protein subunits in different parts of 
the cotyledon. A l though ihc sulphur content o f different 
regions has not been analysed, the presence of greater 
amounts o f legumin subunits in the abaxial region o f 
the cotyledon is compatible w i t h a higher protein bound 
sulphydryl concentration there. 
A s t r ik ing result was the difference in Ihe rat io of the 
50000 and 47000 M W subunits observed between the 
abaxial surface and the central regions o f the cotyledon. 
The fact that this difference was also seen when the pro-
tein subunits o f protein bodies derived f r o m these regions 
were analysed by SDS gel electrophoresis suggests lha t 
the difference is not s imply an extraction artefact. 
Further work wi l l be necessary to determine whether this 
difference is upheld in pur i f ied preparations o f this pro-
tein isolated f r o m different regions of the cotyledons.

Preparation of seed meals. Seeds or cotyledons of Phaseolus 
vulgaris cvs. "Seafarer" and "Canadian Wonder" were finely 
ground in a Janke and Kunkel waier-cooled mill . 
Extraction of proteins, (a) Alkaline salt extracts. 6g of meal 
was stirred with 60 ml 0.5 M NaCI. 0.05 M NaPi buffer pH 
7.5 for 30 min al 4. Slurry was clarified by ccntrifugation 
at 38000 0 for 90 min at 4. ' 
(b) Water extracts. 6g meal was stirred with 60 ml distilled 
waier for 30 min al room temp (18-20). Afler clarification al 
38000[/ for 90 min (al 20) the supernatant fluid was cooled in 
an ice bath for 90 min. The ppt. which formed during cooling 
was collecied by cenlrifiigaiion al 23000;/ for 30min at 4^. 
(c) Acidic extraction and fractionation. A l l procedures were 
at 4. Extraction and fractionation were carried out us de-
scribed by McLccstcr et al. [ 6 ] using 0.5 M NaCI. 0.25 M 
ascorbic acid (measured pH 2.4): a similar procedure was fol-
lowed in the absence of ascorbate. using 0.5 M NaCI. adjusted 
lo pH 2.0 wilh dil HCI. as the cxtractanl. The solvent to 
meal ratio was 10:1 tv/w). The fraction precipitated by addi-
lion of 2 vols of distilled water lo ihe initial supernatant was 
collected by centrifugation. and is referred lo as the F-l frac-
tion. Overnight dialysis of the supernatant, after removal of 
the F-l fraction, against running H 2 0 resulted in the forma-
tion of a ppt: this was collected by centrifugation and is 
referred lo as the F-Ila fraction. A further ppt. was obtained 
by dialysis of the remaining supernatant fluid against several 
changes of disl. I-UO: this was also collected and is referred 
to as Ihe F-l lb fraction. 
(d) SDS extraction. 20 ma samples of meal were stirred wilh 
4 ml or 0.01 M NaPi buffer pH 7.0. 1.0% (w/v) SDS and 1.0% 
(v/v) 2-mercaploclhanol for 60 min al 37: they were then 
healed lo IO0C for 3 min and allowed lo cool al room temp: 
extracts were clarilied by ccntrifugation and analysed by SDS 
gel electrophoresis. 
Preparation of protein bodies, (a) By sucrose density gradient 
centrifugalion. A l l operations were carried out al 0-4. Seeds 
were soaked overnight in running H i O and their lestas and 
embryo axes removed. 3 g cotyledons were finely sliced and 
extracted with 10 ml of 35% (w/v)'sucrose in 0.025 M NaPi. 
0.025 M citric acid. pH 7.5. by gcnlle grinding for 1 min in 
a chilled mortar. Extracts were stirred for 10 min and then 
centrifuged al 165 # for 5 min. Approximately 1.5-2.0 ml of 
the supernatant fluid was carefully layered onto linear 50-90% 
(w/v) sucrose gradients in 0.025 M NaPi. 0.025 M citric acid. 
pH 7.5. prepared in 23 ml polycarbonate lubes. Gradients were 
centriruged for 3 hr in a 3 x 23 aluminium swing-out rotor 
operating al 4 C and 30000 rpm (R av. 94000g)~ Gradients 
were fractionated by inserting a thin capillary tube through 
the gradient lo ihe bottom of ihe lube and pumping the con-
tents out. The gradient was monitored al 280 tun Sucrose con-
centration was measured using a Bcllingham and Stanley 
sugar refraclomcicr. Samples were taken for electron micro-
scopy. SDS gel eleclrophorcsis and protein estimation. 
(b) By cenirifugutioit in glycerol solutions. The method used 
was communicated by Chrispccls [2S]. 3 g meal was genllv 
blended with 30 ml 80% glycerol in 0.05 M NaPi. 0.05 M citric 
acid. pH 5.0. containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoeihanol al room

lemp. The suspension was cenlrifuged Tor lOmin at 2000 g. 
When (he supernatant was layered onto a cushion of 8 ml 
90% (v/v) glycerol in water in a 50 ml centrifuge tube and 
centrifuged at 38000g for 60min al 15. protein bodies were 
obtained as a pellet. Samples or some pellets were taken for 
electron microscopy and Tor SDS-gel electrophoresis; pellets 
were resuspended in 0.5 M NaCI, 0.05 M NaPi buffer, pH 7.5. 
for protein estimation. The procedure was also carried out 
in the glycerol Pi-citrate buffer adjusted lo pH 7.5 with 
NaOH. 
Column chromatography, (a) Zonal isoelectric precipitation. 
Supernatant 11 nid from an alkaline sail extract was adjusted 
to 70% saturation with respect to ammonium sulphate: preci-
pitated protein was collected by ccntrifugation. dispersed in 
0.2 M NaCI. 0.05 M NaPi. pH 8.0, made 0.1% in 2-mercap-
locthanol. and dialyscd against this buffer. It was then sub-
jected to zonal isoelectric precipitation (29.30) using buffer of 
the same composition for elulion. 
(b) DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography. Ion-
exchange chromatography was carried out on columns of 
Whatman DE 52 cellulose equilibrated in 0.025 M NaPi 
buffer. pH 7.2. Samples for chromatography were dialyscd 
against this buffer prior to application. Elulion was com-
menced with buffer of ihe same composition, subsequently 
with a linear NaCI gradient (routinely 0-0.5 M l in the same 
buffer. 
Sucrose density gradient centrifugalion of proteins. Samples 
of clarified alkaline salt extracts were clialysed against excess 
0.5 M NaCI. 0.05 M NaPi pH 7.6. Approximately 1.5 ml was 
then carefully layered on to linear 5-20% (w/v) sucrose gra-
dients in ihe same buffer and the gradients were ccnlrifuged 
for 18 hr al 4 and 30000 rpm (R av. 94000 g) in a 3 x 23 ml 
swing-out rotor. Gradients were fractionated as described for 
the preparation or protein bodies by sucrose density gradient 
ccntrifugation. Fractions of 1.0 ml were collected. 
Estimation of protein. Protein concentration was determined 
by the method of Lowry et al. [31] using bovine scrum albu-
min as standard. Crude "fohulin preparations, prepared by 
lyophilisalion of the precipitate formed by overnight dialysis 
against running tap water of an alkaline sail extract of Pha-
seolus vulgaris, gave a similar calibration curve up lo a protein 
concentration of 200 //g/ml. 
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Undissociated proteins 
were examined in 7.0% (w/v) acrylamidc gels by the disc elec-
uopliorclic procedure of Ornslein and Davis [32] except that 
the spacer gel was omitted. The method of Weber and 
Osbom [33] was used to determine the apparent MWs of Ihc 
subunils of protein dissociated with SDS ( 1 % . w/v) and 2-mcr-
captoclhanol (0.2%. v/v). MWs were routinely determined on 
7.0% and 10.0% (w/v) acrylamide gels. To obtain maximum 
dissociation of subunils (i.e. the lowest MW's) it was found 
necessary lo incubate samples in a boiling water bath for 
3 min. Gels were stained for protein in 0.2% (w/v) Amido 
Black in 7.0% (v/v) HOAc and dcslained by diffusion in 7.0% 
(v/v) HOAc: densitometry traces were obtained by scanning 
I lie gels in transmission al 620 nm using a Joycc-Loebl Chro-
moscan. Gels were stained for glycoprotein by the PAS 
method of Zacharius el al. [34] . The location of bands after 
disc electrophoresis is described by their mobility relative to 
that of the hromophcnol blue marker used (relative mobility. 
R). Molecular weights were determined in the SDS system 
by comparison of the mobility of subunils with that of stan-
dard proteins oT known M W s . 
S-Carhox\welhvlation. This was carried oul by the method 
or Crestfield ei al. [35] . .   -
Direct analysis of hands in disc gels. After electrophoresis 
of undissociated proteins in disc gels, ihc region corresponding 
lo a particular band was cut from several gels in which the 
same sample had been electrophorcscd: the pooled gel sections 
were ground and extracted with 0.025 M NaPi buffer pH 7.0 
containing 2% (w/v) SDS and 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptocthanol. 
Gel isoelectric focusing in 1 M urea. The method used was 
thai of Wrigley [36] . 
/1/m'iio acid analysis. Duplicate samples of proteins in 6 
N-HCI were hydrolyscd in vacuo al 105 for 24 and 72hr: 
their amino acid compositions were determined on a Locarte 
automatic-loading amino acid analyser. The cysteine-cystine 
content was determined as cystcic acid following pcrformic 
acid oxidation [37] . 
N-terminal amino acid analysis. A'-tcrminal amino acids were 
determined by the dansyl-iiicihod of Gros and Labouesse [38], 
Electron microscopy. Samples of protein bodies were fixed 
in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde. 1% (w/v) osmic acid, 0.05 M 
sodium cacodylale buffer pH 7.0 in 80% sucrose (for samples 
from sucrose gradients) or in 80% glycerol (for samples from 
Ihe glycerol procedure) for 3 hr at 4. They were dehydrated 
in an alcohol scries and embedded in Spurr's resin. Thin sec-
tions were posl-siaincd with uranyl acetate and alkaline lead 
citrate and examined in an A.E.I. EM 66 electron microscope 
Agglutination test. Protein samples were prepared in 0.9% 
(w/v) sodium chloride pH 7.0. and mixed with an equal vol 
of 2% (v/v) suspension of Human group O erythrocytes in 
the same solution, at room temp. 
Trypsin inhibitor activity. This was determined by ihc effect 
of alkaline salt extracts on the irypsin-calalyscd hydrolysis 
of benzoyl-argiiiinc-/)-nitroai)ilide (BAPA): Ihe second method 
described by Erlangcr et al. [39] was used exccpl thai the 
assay was carried out in 0.05 M NaPi. 0.05 M citric acid buffer 
pH 7.5. al 35. Assays were carried oul such that the total 
inhibition did not exceed 60%, of the control trypsin activity.

Globul in protein formed the major protein f rac t ion o f mature seeds o f cowpea; it was found to be 
heterogeneous when examined by using chromatography and zonal isoelectric precipitat ion. Both 
7S and U S globulin were present and the f rac t ion was dissociated by SDS treatment into three 
ma jo r subunits w i th apparent molecular weights 56 000, 54 000, and 52 000 as determined in SDS-
acrylamide gels. The individual ma jo r stibunits were purified by using ion-exchange chromato-
graphy in 8 M urea and fur ther characterized by chemical analysis. T w o o f the ma jo r subunits had 
low but different contents o f S-containing amino acid residues and were probably subunits o f 7S 
glycoproteins. 
The pattern o f seed development was investigated and four phases were identified. The protein 
profile and the amino acid composi t ion o f the seeds changed dur ing development; most o f the seed 
globulin was synthesized in the th i rd and four th phases and the net synthesis o f the three major sub-
units o f the globul in differed. The profile o f the amino acid composi t ion o f the pod walls did not 
change dur ing the period o f synthesis o f the seed globulin f rac t ion . The essential amino acid content 
o f the meal is determined by that o f the globul in f rac t ion except for cysteine/cystine which is most ly 
supplied by the a lbumin f rac t ion , the latter probably containing some proteins r ich in S-containing 
amino acids.

The cowpea is cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions and, in West 
Africa, it is the most important pulse crop (Rachie, 1973). It is a main source of 
dietary protein in Nigeria (Oyenuga, 1967) in spite of the fact that cowpeas are 
nutritionally poor in S-containing amino acids (Boulter, Evans, Thompson, and 
Yarwood, 1973) and that the overall seed yields are low. An extensive breeding 
programme directed towards the improvement of cowpea has been established at 
the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan. 
Work with other legumes, for example Vicia faba, Pisum sativum (Wright and 
Boulter, 1972; Boulter, Evans, and Derbyshire, 1973), and soya bean {Glycine

max) (Wolf, 1970), has shown that the different proteins of seeds are of differing 
relative importance nutritionally and that globulin protein is usually the most 
important protein fraction. The aims of the present work were to characterize cow-
pea globulin with respect to the number of globulin components present and their 
amino acid composition and to follow the synthesis of individual polypeptides 
during seed development. Harris and Boulter, (1976) have recently published a 
developmental study of the fine structure of cowpea cotyledon cells.

Materials 
Mature air-dried seeds o f Vigna unguiculata cv. Pr ima were supplied by I . I T . A . Ibadan, Nigeria 
and were grown under glass in pots o f John Innes N o . 1 compost inoculated after 10 d wi th a 
Rhizobium strain specific for cowpea. The first flowers appeared 8 weeks after plant ing: usually 
8-14 seeds were formed in each pod and seeds underdeveloped by comparison wi th the other seeds 
in a pod were discarded. 
Methods 
Meals, prepared by mil l ing mature seeds in a water-cooled mi l l , were sieved through a 40 mesh 
sieve and defatted w i t h hexane before use. 
Protein extraction. Defat ted meal was dispersed in 0-4 M N a C l - 0 1 M P, buffer , p H 8 0, (2 g 
meal/50 m l ) and blended fo r 2 min in a high speed blender, which was cooled in ice. The brei was 
stirred for 15 m i n , fi l tered through two layers o f muslin, and clarified by centr ifugation. Protein 
f ract ions were then prepared by prolonged dialysis o f extracts against 0-033 M sodium acetate 
buffer , p H 5-0. The protein which precipitated was designated 'g lobul in ' and the p H 5-0-soluble 
protein was designated a lbumin. Alkal i-soluble protein was extracted f r o m defatted meal by 
blending w i th 1 N N a O H at a meal weight: solvent volume rat io o f I : 5. 
Chromatography. Ion-exchange chromatography in 8 M urea was performed w i t h Wha tman 
DE52-cellulose in a 1-25 cm x 25 cm column, in 0-076 M Tris-citrate buffer , p H 8-7, containing 
urea at 8 M M E at 0-01 M . Chromatography was carried out at room temperature using a 0-0-35 M 
N a C I elution gradient. Zona l isoelectric precipitat ion was performed using the procedure 
described by Derbyshire and Boulter (1976). 
Ultracentrifttgation. Protein solutions were examined fit 40 000 rev. m i n - 1 and 20  C in a Chris t 
Omega I I 70 000 ullracentrifuge. Sedimentation coefficients and s J 0 w values were determined as 
described by Svedberg and Pedersen (1940). 
Dissociation of protein. Equal volumes o f protein solution (2 mg m l - 1 ) and a solution containing 
2-5% ( w / v ) SDS, 0-1 M M E , and 0 05 M P, buffer , p H 7, were mixed and heated for 3 min in a 
boil ing water bath and then cooled in running tap water. Myog lob in was employed as a marker 
protein and, after heating in SDS-ME-P, buffer ( p H 7) solution, it was added to a port ion o f each 
dissociated protein sample to give a f inal concentration o f 0- 7 mg m l - 1 . 
Polyacrvlainide gel electrophoresis. The method o f Weber and Osborn (1969) was employed to 
determine the subunit composi t ion o f dissociated proteins. The apparent molecular weights o f sub-
units were determined on 10% acrylamide-SDS gels by reference to the relative mobilities o f serum 
albumin, ova lbumin , y-globulin, pepsin, myoglobin , lysozyme, and cytochrome c. Gels were stained 
for protein in either 1 % ( w / v ) A m i d o Black in 7% ( v / v ) acetic acid or 0 - 1 % ( w / v ) Coomassie 
bri l l iant blue-R250 in mcthanol-acetic acid-water ( 9 0 : 7 : 4 3 , by vol .) and for glycoprotein by the 
procedure o f Zacharius, Ze l l , Mor r i son , and Woodcock (1969). 
Serological methods. Polyvalent antiserum against the total proteins in a buffered salt extract 
f r o m mature seeds was obtained f r o m rabbits, which had received a series o f 2 0 - 2 4 intravenous 
injections over a period o f 7-8 weeks. Five days after the final injections the animals were kil led and 
their b lood collected. Immunoelectrophoresis using the Shandon micro-immunoelectrophoresis 
apparatus, was performed essentially as described by D u d m a n and Mi l l e rd (1975). 0 -75% ( w / v ) 
Agarose in T r i s -EDTA-bora t e buffer , p H 9 0 (0-25 M Tris , 0-8 m M E D T A , 0-375 M borate, 
adjusted to p H 9-0 wi th 6 M HC1) was spread on precoated microscope slides to give a gel 1-2 m m 
thick, and al lowed to set at 4  C . Seed protein solutions containing bromophenol blue were placed 
in precut wells and electrophoresed at 200 V at r o o m temperature until the marker dye had 
Carasco, Croy, Derbyshire, and BoulterMajor Polypeptides ofCowpea Seed 311 
migrated 30-40 mm from the origin. Antiserum (0-2 ml) was then placed in precut troughs between 
the samples and allowed to diffuse for 2 d at 4 C, in a humidified chamber. After washing in 
buffered saline, precipitin arcs were stained with 0-1% (w/v) Coomassie blue in methanol-aceiic 
acid-waler and excess stain was removed by washing in methanol-acetic acid-water. 
Chemical composition. Dry weights were determined by drying at 105 C to constant weight. 
Total N was determined by an automated micro-KJeldahl method (Varley, 1966) and total S was 
determined by wet digestion with perchloric-nitric acid mixture and subsequent turbidimetric 
analysis of B a S 0 4 (Mottershead, 1971). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry. 
Rosebrough, Farr, and Randall (1951) and the amino acid compositions of proteins were analysed, 
after hydrolysis in 6 N HC1 in vacuo at 105 C for 22 h and 72 h, on a Locarte auiomatic loading 
amino acid analyser; cysteine plus cystine were determined as cysteic acid after pcrformic acid 
oxidation. Tryptophan was determined colorimeirically (Bencze and Schmidt. 1957). The free 
amino acid contents of ethanol extracts of developing seeds and pod walls were determined by a 
ninhydrin method, using L-leucine as a standard (Moore and Stein. 1948, 1954). N-terminal amino 
acids were determined by the procedure of Gros and Labouesse (1969). Neutral sugars were 
determined by the method of Dubois, Giles, Hamilton, Rebers, and Smith, (1956), and total hexos-
amines were determined by use of the Morgan-Elson reaction (Morgan and Elson. 1934) as 
recommended by Good and Bessman (1964) after prior hydrolysis in 4 N HCI for 6 h (Spiro, 
1966); Glucosamine-HCl was employed as a standard.

Seed storage protein 
The N content of defatted air-dried meals of mature cowpea seeds was 4-33% of 
which 72% was extracted by use of buffered salt solutions. Approximately 15% of 
this extracted N diffused through the membrane during prolonged dialysis of the 
extract against the salt buffer and 85% of the N which remained in the sac 
precipitated during dialysis against distilled water, i.e. was globulin nitrogen 
(Osborne, 1924). 
The protein in the extract after dialysis against salt buffer sedimented in the 
ultracentrifuge to give a broad Schlieren peak with a small shoulder on its trailing 
edge. This protein fraction was composed mainly of globulin, a large proportion of 
which was 7S protein (the rate of displacement of the maximum of the Schlieren 
peak corresponded to s20 w = 7 - 2 ) . 
The major subunits of the undialysed buffered salt extract (Fig. 1) had molecular 
weights o f 56 000, 54 000, and 52 000, the 56 000 subunit being less prominent 
than the other two; carbohydrate was detected in the three subunils by the periodic 
acid-Schiffs reagent (PAS) procedure. 
Protein with subunits of molecular weights 56 000, 40 000, and 20 000 was 
retarded when proteins extracted in salt buffer were examined by zonal isoelectric 
precipitation at pH 4-7. This protein fraction sedimented in the ultracentrifuge as a 
mixture of I IS and 7S proteins. 
The individual major subunits of the globulin fraction were purified by elution 
from DEAE-cellulose in the presence of 8 M urea (Fig. 2). In addition to three pure 
fractions several minor fractions which contained mixtures of other subunils were 
eluted: the molecular weights of the subunits and the S contents of these minor 
fractions are tabulated in Table 1. The chemical compositions of the purified major 
subunits are tabulated in Table 2 and confirm the presence of carbohydrate in the 
subunits with molecular weights of 54 000 and 52 000. Table 2 also shows the 
amino acid compositions of the total cowpea globulin, the albumin (water-soluble)

leucine, phenylalanine, and arginine but low in S-containing amino acid residues. 
The cystine/cysteine contents of the two subunits for which these residues were 
determined were not identical and subunit mol. wt. 54 000 was richer in these 
residues than subunit mol. wt. 52 000. For most of the amino acids, the seed meal 
composition was closer to that of the globulin than to that of the albumin fraction, 
reflecting the higher concentration of the former in the seed; however the 
cystine/cysteine content of the seeds was determined mainly by the albumin 
fraction, which was rich in these residues compared to that of the globulin fraction. 
Seed pod development 
The development of mature pods of cowpeas grown under glass at Durham 
occupied approximately 28 d from anthesis to maturity compared to the 18-21 d 
required in West Afr ica . Except during the early stages, development was not well 
synchronized between seeds of the same chronological age, for example the fresh 
weights of individual seeds 14 d after anthesis ranged from 51 to 180 mg and their 
N contents differed also (20-80 mg). In contrast, except for seeds which were 
drying out, seeds of equal fresh weight were similar to one another in seed coat 
colour, dry weight, and N and S contents even though their ages varied by up to 
 5 d. (Seeds which were drying out were easily distinguished f rom younger seeds 
of equal fresh weight since seed desiccation coincided with drying out of pods.) The 
various parameters which have been investigated have been determined therefore in 
relation to seed fresh weight rather than to chronological age and this data is 
presented in Fig. 3 (pod wall) and Fig. 4 (seeds). However, for comparison with the 
work of others, the approximate time course of development is also indicated. 
As in other legumes, the pod walls developed more rapidly than the seeds during 
the early part of development and after approximately 7 d f rom anthesis they were 
one third the length o f mature pods and had three times as much N as the seeds 
contained within them. During the next few days the pod wall N increased 
temporarily and then declined to a level which remained relatively constant 
throughout the second half of the development period. About this time there was an 
increase in free amino acids in the wall and an acceleration in the N and dry weight 
accumulation by the seed. The route by which N and other material was 
transported from the wall to the seeds was not identified, however electron 
micrograph studies (Harris, unpublished) show that, at this stage, the seed wall is in 
close contact with the pod wall and has vascular tissue near its periphery. Pod wall 
protein was probably not a source of N for the seeds since the ' total ' protein 
fraction (alkali-soluble) of the pod wall remained relatively constant whilst these 
early changes were occurring. When dehydration o f the pods commenced the 
soluble protein fraction increased, although the amino acid composition profile o f 
the pod walls (Table 3) was not changed. 
From the data presented in Fig. 4, four phases of seed development have been 
identified. During phase I , which is a phase o f active cell division, the seeds 
remained small and were rich in free amino acids. In phase I I the growth rate 
accelerated and the seed dry weight, N , and S contents doubled whilst the 
proportion of free amino acids present declined. Globulin protein was first detected

with the period of maximum growth and with the enlargement of cell vesicles 
(protein bodies) in the cotyledons (Harris and Boulter, 1976). Nitrogen increased 
to a level approximately 80% of that found in mature seeds and S and protein, 
including globulin protein, also increased. Development during this phase was not 
uniform and the rates of increase in dry weight and N were temporarily retarded at 
approximately 150 mg fresh weight. After this temporary decline the rate of S 
accumulation decreased and by the end of phase I I I desiccation had commenced. 
In the final phase ( IV) , during which desiccation continued and was completed, 
the rates of dry weight, N , and S accumulation declined; net synthesis of globulin 
continued.

early in phase I I I had molecular weights o f 5 4 0 0 0 and 5 2 0 0 0 and were the most

The major seed proteins of legumes are globulins. They include 7S and U S 
globulins and the ratio o f these is different in different species, for example it is 1:4 
in Vicia faba (Wright and Boulter, 1972), and 9 :1 in Phaseolus vulgaris 
(Derbyshire and Boulter, 1976). The small number of 1 IS globulins which have 
been adequately characterized are similar to each other (Derbyshire, Wright, and 
Boulter, 1976) and legumin f rom Vicia faba for example is typical of the group. In 
contrast, the major 7S globulins in extracts f rom soya bean, pea, and Phaseolus 
vulgaris are not identical, although all three are glycoproteins, and furthermore, the 
7S globulin fractions f rom these species are heterogeneous. The major protein 
fraction in cowpea is 7S globulin and the data obtained here by ultracentrifugation 
together with electrophoretic data (Derbyshire, Yarwood, Neat, and Boulter, 1976) 
indicates that it is heterogeneous; although cowpea has been placed close to 
Phaseolus vulgaris in traditional classifications, the 7S globulin of cowpea is 
different f r o m that of Phaseolus vulgaris (Joubert, 1957; Derbyshire et al., 1976; 
Barker, Derbyshire, Yarwood, and Boulter, 1976). The 1 IS globulin f rom cowpea 
has not been extensively characterized but the limited data available suggest that it 
is a typical legumin-like 1 IS globulin.

Subunits of 7S seed globulin have been isolated and characterized previously 
only f rom soya bean (Masaki and Soejima, 1972; Thanh and Shibasaki, 1977). 
Both soya bean preparations dissociated into subunits of more than one molecular 
weight class; however, the values obtained were not identical but included subunits 
with molecular weights similar to one or other of the subunits isolated f rom cow-
pea. From the limited amino acid data presented (Masaki and Soejima, 1972) the 
soya bean subunits would appear to differ significantly in their cysteine/cystine 
content. 
The accumulation o f N in the pod wall and its subsequent decrease with the 
onset of rapid synthesis of seed protein suggests that the wall fractions act as a N 
reservoir, at least in the early stages of development. The pathway by which N may 
be transported to the seeds at this stage was not determined but the presence of 
vascular tissue in seed walls, which are in close contact with the pod wall (Harris, 
unpublished), suggests that these tissues may participate in the process. I f nitrate 
reductase occurs in the testas o f developing cowpea seeds as it does in Phaseolus 
vulgaris and Vicia faba (Schleiser and Muntz, 1974) nitrate may be one of the 
forms in which N is transported f r o m the pods to young seeds. 
The growth rate of ripening cowpea seeds declined temporally when their fresh 
weight was approximately 150 mg and the protein profile of the globulin fraction 
after this lag phase was different f rom that of younger seeds. A similar lag phase 
followed on the initial increase in seed protein synthesis in Pisum sativum 
(Burrows. 1967; Flinn and Pate, 1968), in Vicia faba (Fig. 1A in Briarty, Coult, 
and Boulter, 1969), and in maize (Ingle, Beitz, and Hageman, 1965); in P. sativum 
it coincided with the disappearance of the endosperm. I f the nutrients transported 
f rom the endosperm to the embryo differ f rom those transported to the seed f rom 
maternal tissues (Paramonova, 1975) the disappearance of endosperm would result 
in a change in the composition of the nutrients entering the embryo. 
The individual globulins of cowpea, including the minor components, are 
probably under separate genetic control during synthesis, as made evident by the 
changing serological and electrophoretic patterns. A similar pattern of sequential 
protein synthesis has been observed previously with Vicia faba (Wright and 
Boulter, 1972), Pisum (Millerd, 1975), and soya bean (Hi l l and Breidenbach, 1974) 
which suggests that it may be o f general occurrence. 
The different cowpea proteins and subunits differ in their S-containing amino 
acid contents and they also vary in relative concentration during development. 
Since it would appear that at least in some cases they are under separate genetic 
control it may be possible to manipulate their proportions to give rise to seeds with 
an increased proportion of S-containing amino acids. Table 1 shows that the 
albumin fraction as a whole has a nutritionally better amino acid profile than the 
globulin fraction and this is reflected in the seed composition. However, it may be 
much more difficult to manipulate the albumin fraction, qualitatively or 
quantitatively, than to manipulate the globulins, since the basic metabolism of the 
seed is more likely to be disturbed by changes in the albumins than by changes in 
the globulins, which probably function only as storage material. 
Globulin synthesis continues in cowpea during drying out of the seeds and less

1 IS globulin than 7S globulin is synthesized. These results contrast with those 
found in P. sativum, Vicia faba, and soya bean, in which globulin synthesis is 
almost completed before dehydration commences and 1 IS globulin is synthesized 
in equal or greater amounts than the 7S fraction, (Danielsson, 1952; Flinn and 
Pate, 1968; Wright and Boulter, 1972; Hi l l and Breidenbach, 1974). This apparent 
correlation between the physiological stage at which seed storage protein is syn-
thesized and the ratio of 1 IS globulin to 7S globulin in the mature seed suggests 
that it may prove possible to increase this ratio in cowpea seeds by postponing the 
onset of dehydration.

THE G E N E R A L PROPERTIES, CLASSIFICATION AND 
DISTRIBUTION OF PLANT PROTEINS

Introduction 
The objectives of this paper are to give a general description of plant proteins within 
the context of this meeting, and to set the scene for many of the topics dealt with 
in detail in later papers. The structure of proteins will not be given in any detail 
as this has been adequately covered elsewhere (Dickerson and Geis, 1969). 
There are very many different plant proteins, at least several thousands, which 
have many different functions. As yet, there are few data relating their detailed 
structure to these functions, but the use of the methods of physical chemistry, 
especially X-ray crystallography, for determining the structure of proteins is rapidly 
supplying information in this field, and the mechanisms of action of a few enzymes 
are now known. 
General Properties 
The properties of biological systems are inscribed by those of the proteins and 
nucleic acids which they synthesize. Diffusion tends to destroy biological systems, 
and large molecules, therefore, confer stability since the speed of diffusion is reduced 
with increase in mass. Proteins consist of one or more polypeptide chains and 
because of their large size, they occur as free macromolecules in colloidal solution 
and as associated colloids in a supramolecular condition. The colloidal state is corre-
lated with low thermal conductivity, low diffusion coefficients and high viscosity, 
properties which buffer the system from the effects of a changing environment. 
Proteins are polyelectrolytes and in supramolecular structures allow energy trans-
duction to take place, including the transduction of light into chemical energy under 
physiological conditions. Similarly, the many chemical processes which take place 
in biological systems could only proceed at the necessary rate through the agency 
of enzymes, all of which are proteins. Furthermore, many specific activities, such 
as cell interaction, cell motility, gene repression, mitogenesis, compartmentation 
and intracellular transport are mediated by proteins. 
Biological systems in addition to having great stability also have the capacity to 
reproduce their structures. The information for specifying the structures and pro-
cesses of the system from birth to death is stored and transferred to offspring by 
4 The general properties, classification and distribution of plant proteins 
the activity of nucleic acids; this information must also be transcribed and trans-
lated to give rise to the proteins of the system. 
Proteins consist of single or several polypeptide chains with unique sequence(s) 
of amino acids giving rise to unique three-dimensional structures which determine 
their highly specific activity. Isoenzymes, that is proteins with the same enzymic 
activity but different structures, are, however, quite common in plants; Scandalios 
(1974) lists 45 examples. Although relatively little is known in detail it can be 
safely assumed from our general knowledge of proteins that small differences will 
be found in the three-dimensional structures of different isomers. Furthermore, 
kinetic differences between isoenzymes have sometimes been demonstrated, suggest 
ing that the different forms of an enzyme may have physiological significance, 
especially as the pattern of isoenzymes may change during development and differ-
entiation. Usually, isoenzymes consist of two or more different polypeptide chains. 
In the simplest case of a dimeric molecule specified by two different alleles (a,b) at 
one locus, three forms of the protein may exist in the heterozygote, namely aa, bb 
and ab. If there are more than two chains, more than two alleles or more than one 
locus, the possible number of different protein molecules increases, although not 
all of these may occur, e.g. haemoglobin with the theoretically possible tetramer 
of four identical a-chains is not found in nature (Williamson, 1969). 
As a first approximation it can be taken that all molecules of a particular protein 
species are identical. Thus, unique sequences have been deduced for several protein; 
e.g. insulin (Sanger, 1956), suggesting that within the sensitivity of the method, i.e. 
approximately 5 per cent, molecules of these proteins are identical. Amino acid 
incorporation studies also lead to the same conclusion and show that whereas in 
vitro a small number of mistakes can occur in protein synthesis, such mistakes are 
extremely rare in vivo. Thus, haemoglobin contains no isoleucine and when 1 4 C 
isoleucine is fed to rabbit reticulocyte cells, they synthesize haemoglobin in vivo 
which contains no radioactivity; haemoglobin synthesized in vitro contains a small 
amount of isoleucine. There is evidence, however, that mistakes do occur rarely in 
the translation of the haemoglobin message in vivo (Carbon, Berg and Yanofsky, 
1966) and physical techniques, such as diffusion and ultracentrifugation, suggest 
that some microheterogeneity may exist (Cole, 1964). 
Since the biological activity of proteins is determined by their amino acid 
sequence, they cannot be synthesized as are the other compounds of the cell by 
an enzymic method; this would necessitate a large number of specific enzymes 
which in turn would require others ad infinitum. Probably all proteins are synthe-
sized by a template mechanism which involves interaction of mRNA with ribosomes 
Even though the process requires the co-ordinated activity of about 100 enzymes 
the rate of synthesis is very fast, approximately 15 amino acids per second. The 
main site of synthesis is in the general cytoplasm but mitochondria and chloroplasts 
also synthesize some proteins, although most of the proteins of these organelles are 
synthesized elsewhere in the cytoplasm prior to their transport to and incorporatior 
into the organelles. Protein bodies (see later) probably do not synthesize proteins, 
in spite of earlier claims to the contrary. However, recently, Burr and Burr (1976) 
have suggested that zein, the major storage protein of maize, is synthesized on rougl 
endoplasmic reticulum attached to the outside of protein bodies. 
Normally, a cell produces several molecules of each specific protein-type but in 
cases where enzymes may be under regulatory synthetic control, one or a few pro-
teins may be produced in great excess. Clarke (1974) in considering microbial 
enzymes, has divided them on this criterion into three groups: 
D. Boulter and E. Derbyshire 5 
1. The central metabolic pathway enzymes, which are needed whatever the 
nature of the primary growth substance, e.g. enzymes of the glucose pyru-
vate pathway, which are normally constitutive. 
2. The biosynthetic enzymes which determine the synthesis of cell constituents 
from the intermediates of the metabolic pools, e.g. the enzymes of the aspar-
tate -* argjnine pathway, which are normally de-rcpressed except in the presence 
of exogenous cell constituents. 
3. The peripheral enzymes which convert the primary food substances into com-
pounds which can enter the central metabolic pathways, e.g. 0-galactosidase, 
which hydrolyses lactose to glucose. These enzymes are catabolic and initiate 
the attack on substrates. Normally, they are inducible and almost always sub-
ject to catabolite repression by other carbon compounds, i.e. those more 
directly metabolized. 
However, the extent and importance of induction and repression of enzyme syn-
thesis in plants has not been established. Seed storage proteins are an example from 
plants where proteins may be produced in great excess {see later), although the 
underlying mechanism is not known in this case. 
Classification 
Classification is an artificial process reflecting the use of purpose of the classifier 
(Davis and Heywood, 1963). Present methods do not give exclusive classes and a 
particular protein can be classified in several different ways; for example, histones 
may be considered as regulatory or as structural proteins, permeases as membrane 
or transporting proteins, etc. Possibly when sufficient three-dimensional data is 
available, the ideal classification may be based on the mechanism of protein action. 
Alternatively, the omega classification (Davis and Heywood, 1963) may be based 
on evolutionary relationships since it is possible that on this basis there are fewer 
than 500 different types of protein. Rossmann. Moras and Olsen (1974), for exam-
ple, have suggested that the NAD-nucleotide binding enzymes, including various 
dehydrogenases, kinases and fiavodoxins, are homologously related, since they 
possess a common nucleotide binding domain. 
Present methods of classification relate to chemical structure, mechanism of 
action, biological function, location and the scparatory procedures employed in 
protein purification. 
CHEMICAL STRUCTURE 
Proteins may be classified as acidic, basic or neutral; alternatively, they may be 
classed as conjugated or unconjugated. Unconjugated proteins are composed 
entirely of amino acids, whilst conjugated proteins have other chemical groups 
bound to the polypeptide chain(s) in stoichiometric proportions. A variety of 
chemical groups may be involved, including carbohydrates, lipids, metals, porphy-
rins, open-chain tetrapyrroles and flavins. Emphasis on stoichiometry is important, 
since there are many examples where a protein has been classed as a conjugated 
6 The general properties, classification and distribution of plant proteins 
protein and later found not to be so because the non-amino group was not stoi-
chiometrically bound, e.g. Concanavalin A from jack bean, first thought to be a 
glycoprotein (Olson and Liener, 1967; Agrawal and Goldstein, 1968). 
MECHANISM 
An example of a mechanistic classification is the grouping together of the mammal-
ian proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase and thrombin plasmin, on 
the basis of the similarity of their mechanism of action (Hartley, 1974); they all 
have the same serine catalytic centre and charge transfer groups. Interestingly, 
subtilisin from Bacillus subtilis has a similar catalytic mechanism to these enzymes 
but an entirely different amino acid sequence otherwise; mechanistically, therefore, 
it belongs to the same group but evolutionalily is distinct. As more three-dimen-
sional structures of proteins are solved, and as a consequence their mechanism of 
action understood, this method of classification will become more widely used. 
FUNCTION 
Proteins are classified on the basis of their function into enzymic, enzyme inhibit-
ing, recognition, regulatory, transporting, storage and structural proteins. 
Enzymic 
Enzymes form the largest groups in any classification scheme of proteins. Referent 
should be made to Dixon and Webb (1964) or to the reports of the IUPAC-nj of 
Biochemistry (IUB, 1973) for details of their official nomenclature. In these schen 
enzymes are classified according to the nature of their reaction towards specific sut 
strates, often determined in vitro though these may not always reflect completely 
their activities in vivo. 
Enzyme inhibitors 
Proteinaceous inhibitors identified in plants include those of trypsin, chymotryp-
sin, other mammalian proteinases, insect and bacterial proteinases, amylase, inver-
tase and lipase (Liener, 1969). 
The role in vivo of proteinase inhibitors has often been regarded as protective 
(Ryan, 1973). Alternatively, a storage role has been assigned to them since, in 
for example soya bean, barley and potatoes, they are present in relatively high con 
centrations (Ryan, 1973). Most proteinase inhibitors which have been studied do 
not inhibit endogenous proteolytic activity from the same source (Ryan, 1973); 
however, proteolytic activity in lettuce and barley seeds increases during germina-
tion and this increase is correlated with a disappearance of the endogenous inhibi-
tors) (Ryan, 1973), suggesting that the latter may regulate proteolytic activity 
during germination. In cow peas, Gennis and Cantor (1976) have shown that the 
D. Boulter and E. Derbyshire 7 
proteinase inhibitor is complexed with an endoproteinase, suggesting that its role 
may be to stabilise its activity. 
Recognition 
Recognition proteins may be loosely defined as those which determine the compa-
tibility or otherwise of incoming materials by specific interactions. Hie classic 
examples of recognition proteins are those involved in the immune response in 
animals. Little is known about recognition proteins in plants but their importance 
is rapidly becoming acknowledged as our information about them increases. They 
include membrane receptor proteins (not yet clearly identified in plants), algal and 
fungal 'sexual' recognition proteins (Weise, 1969; Crandall, Lawrence and Saunders, 
1974), pollen proteins which determine the compatibility/incompatibility reaction 
on receptive or non-receptive stigma, respectively (Heslop-Harrison, 1975), and 
those proteins which may control the specificity of roots towards rhizobial strains 
(Bohlool and Schmidt, 1974). 
Many proteins from plants have been shown to agglutinate red blood cells and 
are, therefore, called phytohaemagglutinins; since many of them show selective 
agglutination effects they are also called lectins, a term sometimes used synony-
mously with phytohaemagglutinins. These proteins occur especially in the seeds 
of the Leguminosae and Euphorbiaceae but are not exclusive to this organ or to 
these families (Toms and Western, 1971). Eventually it may be found that many 
recognition proteins are also phytohaemagglutinins, since both recognition proleins 
and phytohaemagglutinins are usually glycoproteins. This is not invariably so 
however. Concanavalin A, for example, the best known plant lectin, is not a glyco-
protein. In addition to agglutination, phytohaemagglutinin preparations often 
show other effects on animal cells, e.g. toxicity or mitogenicity (Liener, 1969). 
However, in most instances the preparations are not of sufficient purity to decide 
whether one or more of the proteins present are responsible for the different 
functions. 
Regulatory 
The transcription and replication of DNA is probably regulated in part by histones, 
either by inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases or by interaction with 
the DNA template. Histones can be fractionated into five groups, at least one of 
which, Histone IV, is probably homologous between species (Delange and Smith, 
1971); further heterogeneity of histones may result from side-chain modifications 
of the amino acids after the synthesis of the primary sequence. Lack of specificity 
of histones, however, precludes them from being responsible for specific genetic 
regulation during differentiation and development and it is now generally accepted 
that they are non-specific repressors which can interact with most regions of DNA 
and so reduce the template activity of the latter. 
In contrast to the non-specific histones, highly specific regulatory proteins have 
been shown to control the synthesis of some proteins in micro-organisms (Jacob 
8 The general properties, classification and distribution of plant proteins 
and Monod, 1961a and 1961b); specific regulatory proteins of this type have not 
been isolated from higher plants but can be assumed to be present. 
Other regulatory plant proteins include the photosynthetic receptors, chlorophyll 
a and accessory pigments such as chlorophyll b, the algal biliproteins and morpho-
geny proteins. Chlorophyll and the other photosynthetic pigments are photo-
receptors which thereby regulate photosynthesis and hence, indirectly, the bio-
chemical processes which are dependent on its products. Photochlorophyllide 
holochrome and phytochrome, on the other hand, are morphogenic photo-
receptors. Conformational changes in etioplast structure, synthesis of chloro-
phyll and synthesis of some specific proteins, all follow the photoreduction of 
protochlorophyllide holochrome to chlorophyllide holochrome and precede the 
development of photosynthetic competence (Zucker, 1972). Phytochrome 
consists of a blue chromophore covalently bound to a protein; it exists in two 
forms P R and P F R , which are interconvertible and the ratio P R : P F R is controlled 
by light quality and intensity or by the length of duration of darkness. One or 
other form of phytochromc initiates or modifies developmental processes such 
as germination, etiolation and flowering by mechanisms as yet unknown; there 
is little direct evidence, for example, to support the suggestion by Mohr (1966) 
that phytochrome regulation involves gene activation. 
Other morphogenic proteins are associated with microtubules, which are 
involved in chromosome movements during mitosis and microfilament orientation 
in plant cell-wall formation; still others are associated with microfilaments 
involved in motility phenomena such as protoplasmic streaming (lleplcr and 
Palevitz, 1974). 
The tubulin protein of plant microtubules which differs from actin, its animal 
counterpart, has been extracted from several plants and shown to be similar in 
all cases (Hepler and Palevitz, 1974). Proteins isolated from phloem of higher 
plants, P proteins, are also suspected to function morphogenically. They are 
heterogeneous in form, but are probably all made up of subunits of mol. wt 
approximately 60 000, which in 0.1 mol KC1 polymerize into filaments (Weber 
and Kleinig, 1971; Kleinig, Dorr and Kollmann, 197l;Kleinigera/., 1971). 
A major class of regulatory proteins and polypeptides found in animals are 
hormones: comparable proteins have not been identified in higher plants, although 
a protein which induces sexual morphogenesis has been isolated from a culture 
medium in which Volvox carteri was grown (Starr and Jaenicke, 1974). 
Transporting proteins 
Proteins located in the membranes of animal and bacterial cells mediate the trans-
port of several types of molecules, including amino acids and sugars. Similar pro-
teins have not been isolated or characterised from higher plants but presumptive 
evidence for them exists. Thus, the organisation and structure of plant, animal 
and bacterial membranes are very similar as are the kinetics of amino acid uptake 
in these different organisms. The transport of oxygen in legume nodules is con-
trolled by leghaemoglobin, which is genetically coded for by the host plant 
(Dilworth, 1969); two leghaemoglobins have been isolated from soya bean 
nodules, one of mol. wt approximately 15 600 and the other with a mol. wt 
about 15900.

Storage proteins 
Proteins which are laid down in one phase of development but function subse-
quently at a later metabolic phase to supply intermediary nitrogen compounds 
for biosynthesis are called storage proteins. The most important of these arc 
the seed storage proteins which will be dealt with in some detail later. Apart 
from the storage organs of plants, e.g. seeds and tubers, storage proteins also 
occur in the growing meristems at some stages in the life cycle (Newcomb, 1967). 
Structural proteins 
Structural proteins have no enzymic activity and a purely structural function 
although some of the enzymes associated with membranes and ribosomes, etc. 
may also play an important structural role. There have been considerable techni-
cal problems to overcome in the isolation and characterisation of structural pro-
teins and often denatured proteins have been confused with them. However, dur-
ing the last few years considerable progress has been made in understanding the 
structural proteins of the cell membranes (Guidotti, 1972) and also those of the 
bacterial 70S ribosome. An important structural protein of plants is the cell-wall 
glycoprotein, exlensin; it occurs closely bound to the a-cellulose fraction of the 
wall and its function has been discussed by Lamport (1970). 
Location 
Subcellular organelles have multi-enzyme complexes associated with them in 
which the component proteins occur in a fixed spatial arrangement upon which 
the proper functioning of the system depends. Some of these proteins are only 
found in a particular organelle, e.g. cytochrome-oxidase in mitochondria, Fraction 
1 protein in chioroplasts, and hence proteins are sometimes classified according lo 
their subcellular location, i.e. chloroplastic, mitochondrial, nuclear, etc. 
Some proteins occur exclusively in a particular organ and this affords another 
method of locational classification, e.g. leaf protein, seed protein (Altschul etal. 
1964). Because of their importance, seed proteins have been the subject of several 
recent reviews (Danielsson, 1956; Stahmann, 1963; Altschul et al., 1966; Inglett, 
1972;Millerd, 1975). 
Methodological 
Osborne's (1924) classification, based mainly on solubility criteria, is still the 
main classification of this type. He grouped proteins into albumins, soluble in 
water; globulins, soluble in salt; prolamins, soluble in 70-80 per cent aqueous 
ethanol; and glutelins, soluble in dilute acids and alkalis. In spite of its many 
shortcomings, this operational classification, or modifications of i t , is still widely 
used (see later). 
Proteins are normally purified by taking advantage of differences in their size, 
shape or charge, using a variety of chromatographic, electrophoretic, molecular 
sieving and centrifugal techniques. Some classifications have been based on these 
10 Tlie general properties, classification and distribution of plant proteins 
separatory techniques. Serological cross-reactivity has also been used (Grabor, 
Benhamou and Daussant, 1962). 
Distr ibut ion o f Plant Proteins 
INTRODUCTION 
Cells do not synthesize all the proteins for which they have the genetic informa-
tion. The enzymes of the basic metabolic processes such as respiration and pro-
tein synthesis will be present in all 'living' cells but differentiation leads to the 
formation of many specialised cells and in these the complement of additional 
proteins will vary. Thus, cells specialised to produce storage protein in the seed 
will contain proteins which are not found in cells of the leaf specialised for photo-
synthesis, etc. Furthermore, cell specialisation may lead to the loss of some of 
the basic enzymes. 
During the course of evolution the genetic material coding for a particular pro-
tein will have changed so that the amino acid sequence of this protein will vary in 
different organisms; differences in homologous proteins from plants, e.g. cyto-
chrome c, have been used in .an attempt to establish plant phylogenetic relation-
ships (Boulter, 1973). Non-homologous proteins evolve at different rates, for 
example, plant plastocyanin has evolved about one and a half times as fast as 
plant cytochrome c (Boulter etal.. 1977). 
It is not intended here to give a comprehensive account of the distribution of 
plant proteins but only to mention some aspects of the proteins of the major 
food crops. 
G R A I N CROPS 
Seeds are normally high in protein relative to other parts of the plant as harvested, 
although on a global basis the latter may synthesize a greater total quantity of 
protein. The firm foundation of our present knowledge of the seed proteins was 
laid more than half a century ago during 40 years of study by Osborne and his 
colleagues (Osborne, 1924) and their classification of the seed proteins has been 
retained on the grounds of its usefulness in comparing the results obtained for 
different crops by various workers. Broadly speaking, the albumins correspond 
to metabolic proteins whilst the other solubility fractions from seeds consist 
mainly of storage proteins. These fractions are not single proteins, although char-
acterisation of the individual proteins of which they consist has not advanced 
very far, and care must be exercised in interpreting comparative data, since it is 
probable that an homologous protein from two different species may not always 
appear in the same solubility class. Even for a single species, the same protein 
may appear in different solubility classes i f extracted at different developmental 
stages of the seed, partly due to protein-protein interactions and partly to changes 
in extractability caused by the presence of other major deposits. The properties 
of seed proteins may also change during storage or with the method of seed-drying 
(Nash, Kwolek and Wolf, 1971; Munck, 1972). The order in which the solvents 
D. Boulter and E. Derbyshire 11 
are used during extraction can also affect the solubility of a protein, due primar-
ily, it is thought, to denaturation (Preaux and Lontie, 1975). 
Osborne's methodology has been modified and extended by the substitution 
of isopropanol for ethanol and by the addition of dissociating and reducing 
agents (for example, Paulis, Bietz and Wall, 1975; Preaux and Lontie, 1975); 
these modifications usually result in a glutelin fraction which differs in its com-
position from that described by Osborne; a new fraction, prolamin I I or alcohol 
soluble glutelin is obtained for example from barley and maize, when an alcohol 
insoluble residue is extracted with alcohol in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. 
In practice it may be particularly difficult to separate quantitatively albumins 
from globulins due to the phase characteristics of colloids. Furthermore, con-
fusion can arise i f water extracts are referred to as albumins since some globulins 
will be soluble under these conditions due to the presence of endogenous salts; 
in the absence of experimental details an unusually high ratio of albumins to glo-
bulins is suspect. Usually some denatured protein belonging to the other solubil-
ity classes is extracted with the glutelin fraction. 
CEREALS 
Table 1.1 gives typical values for the protein contents of the major cereals. These 
are of the order of 10 per cent but show that generally oats have a higher protein 
content than sorghum, barley and wheat, whilst maize and rice have the lowest 
protein contents. Individual varieties, however, often deviate from the mean by 
two or more percentage points and, for example, a high protein variety of rice, 
BPI-76-1, has a protein content of 14 per cent (Juliano, 1972), which is higher 
than the mean for barley and wheat. Usually more than 80 per cent of the total 
protein is endospermic; however, the concentration of protein is higher in the 
embryo since this is only one-tenth or less of the seed by weight (Wall, 1964). 
Also given in Table 1.1 are the percentages of the various solubility classes as 
defined in the modified Osborne classification. In cereals, two of the four solu-
bility classes, prolamins and glutelins, predominate. In rice these occur in the 
protein bodies and can, therefore, be called storage proteins. In barley and maize, 
whilst both of these proteins co-dominate, evidence suggests that only prolamin 
occurs in the typical protein bodies (lnglett, 1972; Munck, 1972). Even so, both 
prolamins and glutelins behave as storage proteins during germination insofar as 
they are broken down and supply nitrogen building blocks (Folkes and Yemm, 
1956). Although prolamins and glutelins usually predominate, their ratio differs 
in different cereals; for example, in barley and wheat they are present in almost 
equal proportions whilst in rice nearly all of the storage protein is glutelin. The 
oft-quoted statement that oats contain a high proportion of globulin stems from 
an incorrect value quoted in a major review (Table 2 in Brohult and Sandegren, 
1954); reference to the original (Liiers and Siegert, 1924) and more recent publica-
tions (Ewart, 1968; Wu et al., 1972) gives values which range between 6 and 13 
per cent. Usually the fractions are heterogeneous, for example glutelins in maize 
(Paulis, Bietz and Wall, 1975), prolamins in oats (Waldschmidt-Lietz and 
Zwisler, 1963) and globulins in rice and other cereals (Danielsson, 1952; Morita 
and Yoshida, 1968); however, the prolamin of maize may consist of a single 
size of polypeptide chain (Paulis, Bietz and Wall, 1975).

In addition to the major storage proteins, other proteins, for example phyto-
haemagglulinins in wheat, may occur in concentrations significantly greater 
than those in which the basic metabolic enzymes are found. 
Since the different protein fractions have overall different amino acid compo-
sitions (Munck, 1972; see also Chapter 13 this volume), cereal meals containing 
different proportions of the protein classes reflect this in their amiuu acid com-
positions (sec Table 2 of Whitehousc, 1973). 
LEGUMES 
Legumes are often called protein crops because their seeds have a high proportion 
of protein, usually 20-30 per cent of the dry weight, and even higher in the case 
of soya bean. Six legumes, chick pea. cow pea, dry bean, peanut, pigeon pea and 
soya bean, are extensively cultivated as grain crops (Roberts, 1970) and Table 1.2

gives their seed protein contents, together with those of broad bean and pea which 
are major crops in Europe; extraction of oil, from oilseeds for example, leaves a 
residue which is even richer in protein. By contrast with the situation in cereals 
there is usually little or no endosperm present in mature legume seeds and the 
storage tissues are almost entirely cotyledonary. Complete balance sheets of the 
proportions of the Osborne solubility classes are comparatively rare in the liter-
ature but indirect evidence suggests that most crop legumes contain about 70 per 
cenl globulin, 10-20 per cent albumin and 10-20 per cent glutelin with very little 
alcohol soluble protein (Table 1.3). There are several different storage globulins 
as characterised by sedimentation value and amino acid composition and they are 
extracted in the protein body fraction (Derbyshire, Wright and Boulter, 1976). 
Proteins which sediment as 1 IS or 7S molecular species are widely distributed;

however, the exact number of globulins and the extent to which counterparts 
occur in different legumes, are still not known except in specific cases. Different 
globulin storage proteins have different amino acid compositions; for example, 
the 1 IS legumin oiPhaseolus vulgaris contains higher amounts of sulphur-amino 
acids than the 7S glycoprotein I I , the major storage protein present (Derbyshire, 
Wright and Boulter, 1976). Since different legumes contain different proportions 
of the individual storage globulins (Derbyshire, Wright and Boulter, 1976) this 
is reflected in the amino acid compositions of their meals {Table 1.4). However, 
as is the case with cereals, other proteins, for example urease in jack bean, phyto-
haemagglutinins and trypsin inhibitors in Phaseolus vulgaris, which occur in signi-
ficant amounts, may be an important influence on the overall amino acid 
composition. 
OTHER G R A I N CROPS 
These include several of the major oil seeds, for example cotton, rape and sun-
flower and others in more localised cultivation. They represent a broader taxo-
nomic collection than either the legumes or the cereals and this is reflected in 
their seed structure. Different species have different ratios of endosperm to 
embryo and in a few species a substantial quantity ofnucellar tissue may persist 
as perisperm in the mature seeds, for example in sugarbeet (Esau, 1953). The 
seed protein contents of several crops on a fresh weight basis are given in Table 
1.5, which shows that they vary from species to species and in some, for example 
rape and cotton, may be as high as the protein contents of many legumes, even 
before extraction of oil; the amino acid composition of the protein also varies 
considerably (Table 1.5). Data on the protein composition of this group of 
seeds are much more limited than those on cereals and legumes; however, the 
major proteins are usually globulins (Brohult and Sandegren, 1954). Globulins 
which sediment in the ultracentrifuge as 11-12S, 7S or 2S proteins have been 
identified in many species (Derbyshire, Wright and Boulter, 1976), and it is 
possible, therefore, that these may be counterparts of legume storage globulins.

OTHER CROPS 
Other major sources of food are roots, tubers and fleshy fruits; they include 
cassava, yarn, potato and banana (plantain). These are generally considered 
to be calorie crops and they out-yield both legumes and cereals in this respect. 
On a fresh weight (as harvested) basis they contain less protein than legumes 
and cereals, of the order of 2 per cent for roots and tubers and less for fleshy 
fruits (Table 1.6). However, post-harvest processing may reduce the moisture

content of the crop; for example removal of toxins from cassava and drying of 
potatoes for storage removes more than 80 per cent of the moisture and gives 
a product with a protein content comparable to or greater than that of some 
grain crops: at the International Potato Centre, Lima, Peru, potato strains with 
a protein content of 20 per cent dry weight have been developed. The proteins 
of these storage tissues, except potato protein, have received little attention in 
the past; however, it is known that much of the protein can be expressed in the 
sap (McKee, 1962). The most extensively characterised proteins of potato 
tubers are the protease inhibitors which represent only 10 per cent of the pro-
tein (Ryan, 1973); however, approximately 70-80 per cent of potato protein 
is storage protein and, as in seeds, this is heterogeneous and highly amidated 
(Stegemann, 1975). 
Minor proteins which are of special interest in a dietary context are the 
sweeteners which have been isolated from several sources, for example miracle 
fruit and serendipity berries (Inglett, 1975). They are small proteins, mol. wt 
10 000-42 000 and the protein from miracle fruit is a glycoprotein. Although 
D. Boulter and E. Derbyshire 17 
it is known that the sweeteners act directly on the taste buds the mechanism of 
action is not fully understood. 
The shoots and leaves of plants are also used as sources of dietary protein. 
Two-thirds of the world's agricultural land is given over to herbage which 
supplies energy and protein to ruminant animals (Cooke. 1976). Generally, the 
levels of protein in fresh leaves, for example leafy vegetables, are of the order 
of 3 per cent (Table 1.7), and, as with roots and tubers, post-harvest drying may

increase the protein content to approximately 20 per cent or more. Leaf pro-
teins are often divided into two fractions, 1 and 2, on the basis of their solubility 
in ammonium sulphate solutions (Wildman and Bonner, 1947). Fraction 1 is now 
known as ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase and may account for more than 
50 per cent of the total leaf protein; fraction 2 is heterogeneous and contains the 
rest of the proteins of the leaf. Tliis predominance of the same protein in leaves 
of different species may account for the fact that the amino acid compositions 
of different species are rather similar, although not identical (Byers, 1971). The 
total proteins of leaves have been investigated extensively by Pirie and his 
colleagues (Pirie, 1971; see also Chapter 10, this volume) and fraction 1 protein 
is discussed further by Ellis (see Chapter 2, this volume). 
Nutr i t ional Aspects o f Plant Proteins 
PROTEINS IN DIETS 
There are three types of protein which are important in this context: 
1. Plant proteins used as food staples 
2. Anti-metabolic or toxic proteins 
3. Proteins which may afford protection against pests and diseases

18 77ie general properties, classification and distribution of plant proteins 
Proteins are needed in food to supply the essential amino acids which cannot 
be synthesized by animals and humans, and as a source of the non-essential amino 
acids or of nitrogen for their synthesis. 
There are eight essential amino acids, phenylalanine, methionine, lysine, leu-
cine, threonine, tryptophan, valine and isoleucine; in addition, cysteine and tyro-
sine are often also included since the former can spare methionine and the latter 
phenylalanine. Unless the amino acid composition of the protein in the food is 
balanced, i.e. in approximately the proportions for the requirement of essential 
amino acids (WHO, 1973), the protein will be utilised only to the level of the 
limiting amino acid. Usually only the essential amino acids which are present in 
low concentration are considered in this context; however, when high levels of 
leucine occur, for example in maize and sorghum, these may interfere with the 
availability of other amino acids (Harper, 1964). 
With diets containing a mixture of foods, the overall amino acid composition 
of their protein is usually balanced; but in developing countries where often one 
plant food forms the major part of the diet, this may not be so. By comparing 
the amino acid composition of the cereal meals (see Table 2 of Whitehouse, 1973) 
with the WHO pattern, it can be seen that lysine is limiting in all these crops, al-
though oats, rice and barley have higher levels than the other cereals. Diets made u 
largely of cereals, therefore, might also be limiting in lysine; diets in which legumes 
are the major protein source may be limiting in sulphur amino acids. I f other com-
ponents of diets supply adequate amounts of these amino acids, other amino 
acids might still be inadequate. Thus, sorghum is also low in methionine, phenyl-
alanine, tryptophan and arginine, the latter being an essential amino acid for 
some animals; maize is low in tryptophan and arginine, and both maize and 
sorghum have a large excess of leucine. Rice probably has the best spectrum of 
the cereals and that of oats is almost as satisfactory. After the sulphur amino 
acids, legumes may be low in tryptophan, threonine or isoleucine. 
The oft-quoted statement that plant proteins are nutritionally inferior to 
animal proteins stems from these considerations. The statement is not correct 
i f one compares the same proteins from an animal and a plant source, e.g. cyto-
chrome c or histone IV from animals is not nutritionally superior to that from 
plants (Dayhoff, 1972 and 1973). However, plant foods often consist predom-
inantly of one or a few storage proteins and in these specialised proteins one or 
more essential amino acids are present in relative concentrations lower than 
those recommended for dietary protein by WHO (1973); for example glutelins 
in rice are relatively low in lysine and threonine and glycoprotein II in seeds of 
Phaseolus vulgaris is relatively low in sulphur amino acids. Food from animal 
sources, on the other hand, usually contains a predominant protein which has 
a good amino acid profile, for example ovalbumin in egg protein, or myosin in 
meat (Table 1.8), or they contain a mixture of proteins with an overall balanced 
amino acid composition. It is often suggested also that plant proteins are less 
available or less digestible than animal proteins but the evidence for these general 
statements is not strong and appears to be based on data from protein mixtures. 
Much more work is needed in this very important area, since, due to increasing 
world population, plant proteins will be used more extensively in the future. 
Inhibitors of a wide range of proteolytic and glycolytic enzymes occur in 
plants including cereals and legumes, and their presence in uncooked diets 
seriously reduces utilisation of the food. The balance of evidence, however, 
from rat-feeding trials is that these compounds do not have an adverse effect

when they are inactivated by the correct cooking procedures prior to being fed 
(see Chapter 7). During cooking, toxic proteins similar to ricin in castor bean 
will, i f present, be inactivated also. 
Another important group of proteins, which if present in uncooked diets 
reduce the food value, are the phytohaemagglutinins. These may not always 
be completely inactivated by cooking procedures and so will continue to 
reduce the nutritional value of the food (see Chapter 7). Their activity in 
this situation is not a direct one on the blood cells but possibly involves inter-
action with other proteins in the gut or with the gut wall (see Chapter 8 for 
another explanation). Many of the agglutinins which have been isolated are 
glycoproteins. In legumes they are usually present in concentrations which 
are low relative to those of the major storage glycoproteins. The dietary 
significance of glycoproteins generally has not been assessed. 
IMPROVING THE SUPPLY OF PLANT PROTEIN 
There is now considerable evidence that many regional diets in developing coun-
tries contain inadequate quantities of protein as defined by the WHO require-
ments (1973). In most cases the deficiency of protein could be made up by 
increasing the amount of food consumed (see Chapter 14, this volume). However, 
there are some diets, for example those where the staple is a mainly starchy crop 
such as cassava or yam, in which the protein content is so low and of poor quality 
as to preclude meeting protein requirements solely by increased intake of food. 
In some cases, it may be possible to introduce other food crops containing higher 
protein contents and this may overcome the deficiency and additionally improve 
protein quality. However, attempts to introduce new food sources into traditional 
diets are likely to be impeded by sociopsychological factors which are difficult 
to overcome. 
Many diets could also be improved if the quantity and/or the quality of the pro-
tein in utilised crops were enhanced. There are two possible ways of accomplish-
ing this: one is by breeding programmes, either conventional or mutation breed-
ing, and the other by improved management, e.g. fertiliser treatments for those 
20 'flic general properties, classification and distribution of plant proteins 
soils which limit the amount and quality of the protein of the plants grown in 
them. For these programmes to be successful, satisfactory screening methods 
for total protein and protein quality must be available. These must be simple, fast 
and not require expensive equipment or much plant material (Evans and Boulter, 
1974). Methods exist for determining total protein either by dye-binding, automate 
Kjeldahl or by the use of IR reflectance methods (Neotec, 1971; Evans and Boulter, 
1974), and for screening for lysine and tryptophan in cereals (Villegas and Mertz, 
1971), and for the sulphur amino acids of legumes (Evans and Boulter, 1974; 
Boulter and Evans, 1975). 
Since about 70 per cent of the world's protein comes from cereals, and only 
about 20 per cent from legumes, at first sight il mighl appear that improving 
the yield and/or protein content of cereals would be the best strategy. However, 
as pointed out by Sinclair and de Wit (1975), 1 unit of glucose gives rise to approxi-
mately 0.8 units of polysaccharide but to only 0.4 units of protein, synthesis of the 
latter having a higher energy requirement. Therefore, for the same quantity of 
photosynthate transported to the seed there must be a 'trade-ofr between seed 
protein content and seed weight. While this situation might be accepted by nutri-
tionists in regions where the available carbohydrate is more than adequate, it would 
not be accepted by farmers except in special circumstances. This situation under-
scores the difficulties involved in increasing the protein content of cereals. How-
ever, Johnson and his colleagues have shown that a negative correlation between 
protein content and toral yield is not invariable. They have recently released a 
new productive, high protein, hard winter wheat variety derived from Atlas 66, 
with genetic potential for 2 percentage points higher grain protein content 
(Johnson, 1976). 
An alternative strategy is to improve the yield of legumes which, apart from 
soya beans, have not received as much attention as cereals. Their potential has 
been pointed out by Jain (1971), Borlaug (1973), Boulter (1976) and others 
and there are several reports of legume lines which contain much higher percen-
tages of protein than the usual varieties (for example, Luse, 1975). If the pro-
blems of instability of total and protein yields and susceptibility to pests and 
diseases could be solved, or at least in part, then improving legumes could be an 
excellent strategy. 
Not only protein content but also protein quality has come under intensive 
investigation by breeders and agronomists. Much of the work has been concen-
trated on improving amino acid profiles and considerable progress has been 
made, mostly with cereals (see Chapters 12 and 13). In addition however, the 
extent and nutritional significance of toxic and antimetabolic proteins, and 
other compounds in plants, e.g. tannins, saponins and polyphenols, will need to 
be better understood. As more 'exotic' plant materials are incorporated into 
breeding programmes these compounds may have to be 'bred out'. On the 
other hand, this could be detrimental i f it were established that a compound 
was a natural protective agent against pests and diseases of the crop (Ryan, 
1973), either in the field or in storage. For example, when gossypol, a nutri-
tionally undesirable polyphenol was bred out of cotton seeds, these cotton 
plant lines were more susceptible to pests. In some cases the compounds in 
question may be otherwise highly nutritious; thus, some protease inhibitors of 
legumes have exceptionally high sulphur amino acid contents, for example the 
blue protein inhibitor in Phaseolus vulgaris (Pusztai, 1966). For those com-
pounds which are completely inactivated during normal cooking procedures, 
D. Boulter and E. Derbyshire 21 
the correct strategy might be to breed for increased rather than decreased 
amounts. 
In the first agricultural revolution which took place in Neolithic times, the 
major crop plants which supply most of the world's food, except sugar beet, 
were brought into cultivation. It is not certain upon what factors the choice 
and successful domestication depended, but an important factor must have been 
the ability of the technology of that time to minimise the effects of toxic sub-
stances, and to store and prepare food. As the world population continues to 
increase, it would appear that in order to grow sufficient food a second agricul-
tural revolution will be needed before the turn of the century, in which new 
crops, new technology and new cropping patterns will play a part.

AbstractThe structure, locution in the seed and distribution of the storage protein of legume seeds are described. 
Methods which have been employed for the extraction, purification and characterisation or seed globulins are 
reviewed in relation to modern biochemical practice. The physical, chemical, and immunological characteristics 
of the classical legumin and vicilin preparations from Pisiim sativum are summarised and the distributions of proteins 
with sedimentation coefficients and/or immunological determinants similar to those of legumin and vicilin. arc 
tabulated. The structure and composition of various purified legumin and vicilin-typc proteins from a variety of 
legumes, arc compared. 
INTRODUCTION 
The biological role of the seed 
Prior to the development of the seed habit, plant dis-
persal wits the function of the spore. Once the megaspore 
was retained and fertilisation took place on the parent 
plant, the developing embryo could be nourished by the 
parent tissues, which was a considerable biological ad-
vantage, but the role of dispersal by the spore was lost; 
this function was taken over by the seed. The developing 
seed builds up a substantial store of reserve material and 
is shed as an independent propagule. There may be a 
period of dormancy but eventually, if conditions arc 
favourable, germination will take place and the reserve 
material is used as a source of nitrogen and carbon com-
pounds for the developing seedling; the nitrogen is 
mainly in the form of proteins, the carbon in the form 
of starch or oil , or both. 
On average, the percentage of protein in cereal grains 
is 10-15% of dry matter, and in legume seeds 20-25%. 
In contrast, a typical vegetative organ, such as the leaf, 
has only 3-5% of its dry matter as protein. Seeds, there-
fore, and particularly legume seeds, are a high protein 
food source for man and his animals cither directly or, 
more recently, as 'textured vegetable protein foods' for 
A definition of storage protein 
During the course of seed development from the ferti-
lised ovule to maturity, protein is laid down al a variable 
rate. Usually the rate of protein deposition increases dra-
matically about one-third of the way through the devel-
opment cycle [1-7] . Concomitantly, membrane-bound 
vesicles, protein bodies, appear which become filled with 
protein; this can be demonstrated by their staining

properties in the light microscope [8] and by inimuno-
fluorescent techniques using the electron microscope [9 ] . 
Furthermore, it has been shown with a variety of plants 
that the protein of the protein bodies is degraded on 
germination [10-13], and serves as the source of nitrogen 
for the various new nilrogen compounds synthesized by 
the developing seedling [14]. This protein is, therefore, 
called storage protein, since it is laid down at one stage 
of the life cycle for future use at a mctabolically more 
active stage. 
Many proteins occur in seeds and the problem is to 
distinguish the storage proteins from those which have 
metabolic or structural roles etc. Since it has rarely been 
shown that a protein isolated from seeds occurred in 
vivo in the protein bodies, arbitrarily, proteins extracted 
from seeds, which constitute 5% or more of the lotal 
protein, may be suspected to be storage proteins. This 
review describes the structure, and distribution or the 
major storage proteins of legumes. 
The 'classicaf vicilin and legtimin fractions of Oshorne 
[15] and Danielsson [16] 
Osborne and Campbell [17] showed that much of the 
protein of legume seeds was salt soluble globulin, and 
they were able to separate this fraction from Pisum sati-
vum into 2 major fractions,- legumin and vicilin, using 
repeated precipitation by dilution or heat treatment. The 
methods made use of the fact that legumin was less sol-
uble than vicilin in dilute sail solutions, and also that 
legumin solutions were not hcat-coagulable, whereas 
those of vicilin coagulated al 95. Chemical analyses of 
legumin and vicilin showed that their nitrogen and sul-
phur contents were 18 04% N and 0-42% S and 17-4% 
N and 018% S respectively. 
Osborne demonstrated that similar protein fractions 
could be extracted from other legume seeds, e.g. Phaseo-
lus vulgaris [18-20] and Glycine max [21], but that their 
4 E. DEHIIVSHIKK, D . J. WRIGHT and D . BOULTHU 
chemical compositions differed. In view of this, Osborne 
[15] refuted Ritthauscn's idea that only a comparatively 
small number of vegetable proteins occurred in nature. 
The innovation ofullracentrifugation [22] and electro-
phoresis [23] as analytical tools for high molecular 
weight substances, led to a closer investigation of the 
seed globulins. Ultracentrifugation analysis of seed pro-
teins was performed initially by Svedberg [24] and later 
and more extensively by Danielsson [16]. Daniclsson 
[16, 25] separated globulins from Piston sativum by the 
use of ammonium sulphate precipitation and isoelectric 
precipitation at pH 4-7, and on the basis of their solu-
bility, heat stability and "/ nitrogen, he equated them 
with the legumin and vicilin preparations described by 
Osborne and Campbell [17]. He demonstrated [16, 
26-2S] that vicilin and legumin: (a) scdimentcd in the 
ultracentrifuge as single components at different protein 
concentrations with i' 2o. = 6-58-1 and 12-64 respect-
ively, and had molecular weights of 186000 and 331000 
respectively: (b) migrated as single components during 
free flow electrophoresis in presence of 0-2 M NaCI; as 
judged by zero mobility, the isoelectric point of legumin 
was pH4-8 and vicilin pH 5-5: (c) were degraded during 
germination, i.e. functioned as storage proteins: and (d) 
that vicilin contained more lysine, and less tryptophan 
and glutamic acid than legumin. Tryptophan is easily des-
troyed during acid hydrolysis and as this method is 
usually employed, values for tryptophan arc often miss-
ing from published amino acid compositions. Danielsson. 
however, emphasised the difference between the ratios 
of tyrosine to tryptophan in vicilin (10:1) and legumin 
(4:1). 
Daniclsson [16] also examined the globulin fraction 
of 34 species of legumes from 8 tribes of the Lcgumino-
sae, (Fabaccae [29]), and found, with a few exceptions, 
that they all contained two globulins with sedimentation 
coefficients of approximately 7S and I IS which, on the 
sole basis of their sedimentation values, he called vicilin 
and legumin. For many proteins, sedimentation velocity 
is dependent on the concentration, and the range of 
values between 6-6 and 8-3 recorded for the 7S component 
by Daniclsson [16] from different sources, may have 
been due, in part, to differences in concentration of an 
equivalent protein in the preparations. However, it may 
also reflect some degree of heterogeneity in the protein 
contributing to the 7S peaks. Notable among the excep-
tions referred to above were Acacia longifolia, A. pen-
ninervis, A. verticillata and Trifolium repens. all of which 
contained a 7S component, but not an IIS, although 
the sensitivity of the technique is insufficient to demon-
strate the presence of very small amounts of the IIS 
component. 
Another method or comparing these globulins from 
different legumes has been to follow the immunochemical 
cross-reactivity of legumin and vicilin prepared by meth-
ods similar to those of Danielsson [27]. Earlier serologi-
cal investigations particularly those of Kloz and co-
workers (see e.g. Kloz [30]) using Immunoelectrophore-
sis, suggested that vicilin might be more widely distri-
buted than legumin. More recently, Dudman and Millerd 
[31] have investigated genera from eleven tribes of the 
Leguminosac [32] and, in agreement with Kloz, have 
shown proteins, immunologically related to vicilin and 
legumin, to be widely distributed in the Fabcae (Vicieae) 
and Trifolieae. However, by using several different im-
munological techniques they conclude, contrary to Kloz 
and co-workers, that legumin-likc proteins are more 
widely distributed than vicilin-like proteins in the other 
tribes investigated; the Phaseoleae gave no cross-reac-
tions with either protein from Vicia faba. 
Detailed characterisation of the storage proteins re-
quires their isolation in a form which satislies stringent 
homogeneity criteria. The advent of column chroma-
tography and gel electrophoresis demonstrated the het-
erogeneous nature of globulins prepared by the earlier 
techniques, and the traditional methods of protein purifi-
cation, e.g. crystallisation and salt fractionation have 
now been either entirely replaced or supplemented by 
techniques which utilise more directly the fundamental 
differences between the proteins to be separated, viz. 
molecular weight, shape and charge. The following descrip-
tion and critique of the various methods used to purify 
globulins is necessary, in order to understand the status 
of the results found in the literature; the physico-chemi-
cal properties assigned to some of these proteins must 
be viewed with suitable caution. 
T H E STORAGE PROTEINS O F LEGUMES 
Extraction and purification 
The complex and diverse chemical nature of seeds is 
such that the methodology used for extracting proteins 
may not be universally applicable. However, certain pre-
cautions outlined below must be taken unless it is de-
monstrated for a particular seed source, that they are 
unimportant. 
Freshly harvested, not stored, air-dried seeds should 
be used as starting material. If controlled growth en-
vironment facilities are not available to give adequate sup-
plies of freshly harvested seeds, then stored seeds are 
used, but the results obtained should be compared with 
those from freshly harvested seeds, e.g. storage of seeds 
or of ground meal results in a decrease in the quantity 
of protein which can be extracted by water and salt [33. 
Tcslas should be removed prior to extraction since 
they often contain substances, e.g. pigments, phcnolics, 
etc. which may later interfere with the isolation process. 
If freshly harvested seed is being used this presents no 
problem; if air-dried seed is being used it is often not 
possible to remove the testa readily, without soaking the 
seed and almost certainly some protein hydrolysis will 
occur during this process. Imbibition can be expedited 
by scarifying the seed and proteolysis can be reduced 
by carrying out the imbibition at low temperature. 
Air-dried seed is usually milled and defatted prior to 
extraction, although it has been suggested that this step 
is not necessary in some cases even with seeds of high 
oil content [7 ] . It is sometimes necessary to remove pig-
ment prior to protein extraction; Joubert [35-37] with 
Lupimis achieved this by washing with elhanol and 
water. 
Initial extraction of the protein of freshly harvested 
seed is normally accomplished by homogenisation in a 
high-speed blender. Meal can be extracted in an ultra-
sonicator or by homogenisation. Prolein-phytate inter-
actions are enhanced by the presence of cations and 
hence the ionic strength of the extractanl should be kept 
as low as possible. Precipitation of protcin-phytale com-
plexes takes place at acidic pH values, between pH 4-5 
and pH 6-6 [38], and the pH should be maintained above 
Storage proteins of legume seeds 5 
this range. On the other hand, association/dissociation 
reactions of globulins arc often promoted by high pH 
values and non-enzymic deamidation is also enhanced 
at pH 10 [39]. Deamidation proceeds more rapidly, at 
pH 7-4. in the presence of phosphate ions as compared 
to the rale in borate and Iris-glycinc buffers. 
Sulphydryl reagents such as 2-mcrcaptoethanol and 
dilhiothrcitol at low concentration, inhibit the formation 
of disulphidc bridges between proteins with free sulphyd-
ryl groups and hence reduce polymerisation and sub-
sequent insolubility; thus, it has been reported that 
2-mcrcaptoclhanol in the extraction medium increases 
the amount of protein extracted [40]. Aklylalion of SH 
groups with N-clhylmalciinide will also prevent disul-
phidc bridge formation, but little is known about the 
effects of these reagents on the internal sulphydryl and 
disulphicle gruups of the protein. 
EDTA. a neutral chelating agent, has proved useful 
in enzyme isolation and it has also given increased ex-
traction or the protein from seeds. Inclusion in the ex-
traction medium of polyvinylpyrrolidone or other similar 
reagents which complex with and so remove phenolic 
plant constituents, have been shown to be necessary for 
the isolation of active enzymes and mitochondria from 
some plants [41-43], although these agents have not 
been used generally when extracting seed globulins. 
One subject which perhaps deserves more attention 
than it is receiving at the present time, is that of proteoly-
tic activity in seed extracts, since this could modify sub-
stantially the proteins under investigation. Proteinase in-
hibitors such as diisopropyl fluorophosphate and phenyl-
methylsulphonyl fluoride, have been shown to be effec-
tive in overcoming this problem in the isolation of other 
proteins [44-48], and it is probable that their use wil l 
be extended to the isolation of the seed globulins, if only 
to determine whether the observed heterogeneity in some 
protein preparations is inherent or clue to proteolytic 
activity. Proteolytic degradation could be minimised by 
conducting extraction and purification procedures with 
small amounts of material at low temperatures, but the 
cryopreeipitation of some globulins [16. 49. 50] may 
make this procedure impractical. Proteolysis can be 
minimised also by the use of phenol-containing solvents 
[51]. The value of phenol as an efficient cxtractant of 
plant protein has been known for a considerable time 
[52]. and its particular value in the preparation of seed 
protein free from loosely bound carbohydrate has been 
emphasised recently by Pusztai [51]. Interactions be-
tween proteins and other polyelcctrolytcs are decreased 
in phenol containing solvents and proteins can be re-
covered in their native stale. 
Proteins which agglutinate animal erythrocytes are 
found in many legume seeds and often several agglutinins 
with different specificities exist in the same species [53]. 
Some of these proteins have also been shown to interact 
with other animal cells via the glycoproteins of the mem-
branes. Since glycoproteins occur extensively in seeds, 
interaction between these and the seed agglutinins, al-
though not investigated so far, could well take place 
in seed extracts. This is especially important in the 
present context, since some storage globulins arc glyco-
proteins. 
Even when extracts have been prepared under these 
conditions, it is advisable as Daniclsson [54] recom-
mended, to remove other non-protein materials from the 
extract as soon as possible: this may be effected by 
molecular sieving, by cryoprecipitation [49], or by salting 
out the proteins by the addition of ammonium sulphate 
[55]. The use of ammonium sulphate allows the simul-
taneous fractionation of the proteins and results in pre-
cipitates which can be rcdissolvcd directly or stored in 
a relatively stable condition. However, fractionation is 
usually incomplete and it is necessary eventually, to re-
move the salt either by chromatography or dialysis; the 
aggregation of protein molecules which occurs during 
precipitation, may, itself, enhance protein-protein inter-
action despite the presence of the salt. 
Further purification of the crude globulin preparation 
can be obtained by several procedures, but purification 
of individual proteins should be carried out as quickly 
as possible to reduce interactions: if required, samples 
between purification stages can be stored frozen, frcczc-
dricd or under a saturated solution of ammonium sul-
phate. The most successful method of purifying legumin 
( I IS protein) has been its isoelectric precipitation leaving 
the vicilin (7S protein) in solution [16. 56]: the exact 
pH used varies from one protein source to another, but 
is in the region of 4-7. For complete separation this pro-
cedure must be repealed several times [16. 57], but its 
greatest disadvantage is that some of the precipitated 
protein will not rcdissolve when the pH is readjusted 
to the original value [55. 58-60]. The formation of disul-
phidc-bridged polymers has been connected with this 
phenomenon [34], but another explanation for it could 
be the production during isoelectric precipitation of local 
areas of high acidity which leads to the dissociation of 
the globulins. 
A modification of this method, termed zonal isoelectric 
precipitation [61-64], seems to overcome these difficul-
ties. Because of the multiple precipitations involved and 
also since the I IS protein is not subjected to pH values 
below the isoelectric point, this technique affords rela-
tively pure, readily solubilised legumin preparations. The 
vicilin fraction obtained by this method is contaminated 
with legumin and is also impure [65]. 
Even with those sources where another protein is pres-
ent with a similar isoelectric poiiit to that of legumin, 
e.g. the 7S protein of soyabean [66], some separation 
may still be possible by the selection of a suitable ionic 
strength. Since phytatc has been reported as a major 
contaminant of globulins prepared by isoelectric preci-
pitation [38], it is advisable to remove as much of it 
as possible from the extract by dialysis or by treatment 
with Dowcx ion-exchange resin [38] before attempting 
isoelectric precipitation. 
Gel filtration can be utilised to remove low molecular 
weight proteins and also non-protein contaminants dur-
ing the purification of globulins. This technique has 
proved far less successful in the separation of vicilin and 
legumin however, than would at first appear from the 
difference in their sedimentation coefficients (7S and I IS) 
and molecular weights (186000 and 330000). Hasegawa 
el al. [67] separated two 7S proteins and a 6S protein 
from the IIS protein on Scphadex G-200, using extracts 
of Glycine max, but a third 7S protein co-eluled with 
the IIS protein. Some US globulins have been purified 
using this method, e.g. the US protein from seeds of 
Helianthus animus was separated from its 7S dissociation 
product by using repealed chromatography on Sephadex 
G-200 columns [68]. 
Koshiyama [69]. using a globulin preparation from 
Glycine max was unable even with the use of 200 cm-long 
6 E. Dl-KHYSIIIRI:. D. J. WRIGHT illltl D. BOULTER 
columns, to completely separate the I IS and 7S com-
ponents; he did. however, obtain a pure preparation or 
the 1 IS protein, glycinin, by taking only those fractions 
corresponding to the leading edge of the cluted peak. 
The failure to achieve reasonable separation of these two 
components on dextran gels is probably due to the fact 
that they both have approximately the same Stokes' 
radius [69]. Another complication is illustrated by the re-
sults obtained with the 7S globulins of Pisum sativum. 
These were retarded relative to standard proteins during 
thin-layer chromatography on cross-linked dextran [70] 
and this anomalous behaviour led to an underestimate 
of their molecular weights [71]. 
Interaction between proteins and cross-linked dextran 
may lead to the retention of proteins during molecular 
sieving and to selective losses. The degree of cross-lin-
kage of the dexlrun has a differential effect, e.g. C o n A 
is not retained by more highly cross-linked dextrans 
[72]. 
A more cflective method of separating the 7S and I IS 
proteins is by chromatography on hydroxylapatite (cal-
cium phosphate) gels [73, 74]. The degree of resolution 
allbrdcd by this method is enhanced significantly by 
operating at low clution rates [75]. 
A more recent innovation has been the use of affinity 
chromatography with cither monospecific antibodies or 
agglutinating proteins such as Concanavalin A. attached 
to solid supports. In the case of globulins of Glycine 
max the 7S protein contains more carbohydrate than the 
IIS [76], and is adsorbed during passage through a 
column of Con A Scpharose [77] ; however, the carbo-
hydrate content of seed globulins varies considerably and 
the future usefulness of the technique in the separation 
of 7S and I IS glohulins from other species, is difficult 
to assess. Two 7S globulins, fl conglycinin and y congly-
cinin. from Glycine max have been separated, one from 
another, by use of monospecific antibodies bound to Se-
pharose 6B (Koshiyama, I . , personal communication). 
The specificity of this type of affinity chromatography 
suggests that it will be employed extensively in the future, 
even though the production of antibodies is time-con-
suming. 
Ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-ccllulosc and 
DEAE-Scphadex has been used in the preparation of 
globulins from a wide range of seeds including Vicia sali-
va [78], Pisum sativum [79], Phaseolus aureus [80], Gly-
cine max [81, 82], Brassica napus [83], and Primus amyg-
dalus [84]. Because of its sensitivity, this technique 
affords better results when employed in the final stages 
of purification. It has also been used as a criterion of 
homogeneity [85] and as a form of fingerprinting tech-
nique to compare preparations of the same protein ob-
tained by different procedures [86]. 
Sucrose density gradient ccntrifugation has proved 
useful for the preparation of small but relatively pure 
quantities of the 1 IS globulins of Glycine max [ 7 ] , Plia-
seolus aureus [80] and Vicia faba [ 2 ] . Electrophoretic 
procedures have proved useful in the separation of par-
ticular globulins from other proteins, e.g. Glycoprotein 
I I of Phaseolus vulgaris was partially purified by use of 
free flow electrophoresis [87] and legumin and vicilin 
of Pisum have been isolated from gels after eleclro-
phoretic separation (Thomson, J., personal communica-
tion). 
The progress of the purification is monitored by pro-
cedures such as gel electrophoresis. Once purification is 
thought to be complete, a variety of methods is used 
to establish the homogeneity of the preparation, al-
though none of these, either singly or in combination, 
is necessarily definitive proof of the presence of only one 
protein. The ultraccntrifuge still remains a powerful ana-
lytical tool for this purpose, since it yields information 
on both Ihe purity of the preparation and on molecular 
size. However, the powers of resolution of the technique 
are inferior to those of electrophoresis. Free How electro-
phoresis has been employed to characterise globulins in 
a number of laboratories [27. 74, 88-90]. but is time-con-
suming and today the more convenient procedure of 
electrophoresis using a stationary support is employed. 
Solid supports such as paper, cellulose acetate mem-
branes, starch and polyacrylamide gels have been used 
[79, 90-92] and of these polyacrylamide gels usually give 
the greatest resolution; they can also be used on a pre-
parative scale. The pH of electrophoretic buffers can be 
selected to modify the net charge on the proteins and 
0-5 M NaCI [69] and 2-mercaptoeihanol [77] can be in-
cluded in the gel system to prevent the globulin undergo-
ing dissociation or aggregation during electrophoresis. 
Isoelectric focusing in solvent stabilised by the incorpor-
ation of sucrose [93] or on polyacrylamide gel [94], has 
also been used and affords a very high degree of resolu-
tion. Its usefulness with regard to the seed globulins is 
limited, since these proteins tend to precipitate at their 
isoelectric points and also since the technique only oper-
ates effectively at very low ionic strengths. Under those 
conditions it is necessary to solubilisc the seed globulins 
with reagents such as urea, and these affect the quatern-
ary structure of the protein. Nevertheless, the procedure 
has found application with the more soluble globulins, 
e.g. glycinin [69]. 
Immunoelectrophoresis can be used to check the pur-
ity of preparations since it is an excellent method for 
separating mixtures of legumin and vicilin [31, 95, 96]. 
Extracts of Vicia faba, for example, give clearly separated 
bands of vicilin and legumin as well as a third protein 
of intermediate electrophoretic mobility. However, the 
positions of immunoelectrophoretic bands is influenced 
by the concentration or the protein antigens, and it is 
not always possible, therefore, to be sure when an analy-
sis gives just a single band, whether it represents vicilin 
or legumin. The identity of bands may be confirmed, 
however, by the use of the Osserman technique [97] 
which combines both immunodiffusion and Immunoelec-
trophoresis, although this method is relatively insensitive. 
Various artefacts are possible in the immunological 
analysis of unfractionated seed extracts and these are dis-
cussed by Kloz [30] and by Dudnian and Millcrd [31]. 
Often a single A'-tcrminal amino acid is used as a 
measure of the homogeneity of a protein preparation. 
Since the seed globulins consist of more than one differ-
ent polypeptide chain in this case the test of purity is 
that the number of different ^-terminal amino acids 
found should be consistent with the number of different 
polypeptide chains in the molecule. Three different labels, 
dinitrophenyl-(DNP-), phcnylisothiocyanate and dan-
syl-(DNS-), have been employed to determine the AMer-
minal amino acids of storage globulins and the first of 
these has been used most frequently. It is anticipated 
however, that the greater sensitivity ( x 100) of the DNS-
method and the greater stability of the labelled deriva-
tives during protein hydrolysis, will lead eventually to 
the adoption of the latter as the preferred method of 
Storage proteins of legume seeds 7 
N-terminal analysis, especially when this is applied to 
the small quantities of protein elutcd from gels. 
Methods of characterisation 
In addition to characteristics such as size (ultracentri-
fuge), isoelectric point (electrophoresis) and number of 
subunits (electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulphate) 
which may be determined as by-products of homogeneity 
checks, further characterisation of the globulins involves 
the determination of their chemical composition (e.g. 
amino acid composition, carbohydrate content, etc.) and 
the separation, isolation and characterisation of their 
constituent subunits. Often outdated methods of chemi-
cal analysis have been used and these should now be 
replaced by modern methods such as described in Meth-
ods in Enzymology [98], to which reference should be 
made. 
Dissociation of globulins can be brought about by 
alteration of pH [33, 74, 99, 100] and by exposure to 
dissociating agents, e.g. urea, fonnamide, guanidine hy-
drochloride, detergents, /?-mercaptoelhanc>l [101] and 
dithiothreitol [102]. The latter 2 reagents are employed 
to disrupt disulphidc bridges and the other treatments 
result in cleavage of hydrogen bonds. Disulphide bonds 
are no I always located near the surface or the molecule 
and prior disruption of hydrogen bonds is usually necess-
ary to ensure that all disulphide bonds are exposed to 
the thiol reagent. The total cleavage of hydrogen bonds 
in large proteins also offers difficulties and high concen-
trations of dissociating agent are necessary to complete 
and maintain separation of subunits. When guanidinc 
hydrochloride is employed, a final reagent concentration 
of 4 M is adequate but a minimum concentration of 6 M 
urea is often essential. Sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) 
can be bound by protein to form 2 types of complex 
which differ in their stability; the more stable complex 
requires a binding ratio of l-4g/g protein [103]. It is 
necessary, therefore, to employ SDS under conditions 
which ensure this binding ratio is achieved, for example 
by introduction of SDS at a concentration (w/w) some 
ten limes that of the protein to be dissociated or by 
dialysis of the protein against a much larger volume of 
a medium of lower SDS concentration [104]. Even at 
the high binding ratio, reassociation of dissociated sub-
units has been reported, although these complexes 
usually involve only a small proportion of the protein. 
Separation of the dissociated subunits can be accom-
plished by utilising differences in cither their charge or 
molecular weight. In general, our experience has been 
that better resolution and higher recoveries are obtained 
when any disulphide-sulphydryl groups of the subunits 
are permanently blocked, for example, by carboxymethyl-
ation. Modifications of this kind however, may preclude 
their subsequent use for some physical and biological 
studies. 
Ion-exchange chromatography conducted in dissociat-
ing medium has been used successfully for the prep-
aration of the component subunits of several I IS pro-
teins. Dlouha et al. [105] fractionated S-sulphoedestin 
prepared from Cannabis sativa into 2 components on 
DEAE-cellulose using phosphate buffers of varying 
molarities in 6 M urea. The same ion-exchange resin was 
used in 4 M urea with a salt gradient to separate the 
subunits of legumin of Vicia sativa [106] and glycinin 
[107]. Separation of the subunits of CM-lcguinin from 
Vicia faba was achieved by chromatography in 6 M urea 
on the resin AGI-X2 [64]. Masaki and Soejima [108] 
separated three fractions from urca-dissociatcd 7S globu-
lin or Glycine max on DEAE-cellulose. Ghclie and Buzila 
[70] separated two components from cryoprccipitated 7S 
globulin of Pisum sativum by using Scphadcx G-200 in 
urea, and Grant and Lawrence [79] also using P. sati-
vum IS protein (vicilin) isolated a scries of urea-disso-
ciated subunits from polyacrylamide gels and determined 
their amino acid compositions and A'-tennini. 
Wright and Boulter [64] successfully applied the tech-
nique of preparative SDS poiyacrylamidc gel electro-
phoresis to the separation of the acidic and basic sub-
units of Vicia faba. but even though this work demon-
strates the feasibility of subunit separation on the basis 
of molecular weight, little has been attempted in this 
area. Goding et al. [109] have prepared a glycoprotein 
subunit from the 12S globulin of Brassicu napus using 
gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 in 2 M urea at pH 2-8. 
This component represented the largest subunit. on the 
basis or its clulion volume, and had a S% . value or 
2-7 S and AMcrminal glycine; three other components 
were also separated by this method. Lastly, Catsimpoolas 
[93] isolated 6 subunits. 3 acidic and 3 basic, from gly-
cinin by isoelectric focusing in urea-dithiothreilol 
medium. 
Characteristics and distribution 
Since the biological role of seeds is much the same 
throughout the flowering plants, it would appear likely 
that specific storage proteins have evolved and that 
equivalent homologously related proteins might exist in 
a wide range of plants. These proteins would be dis-
tinguishable from other proteins by their size, subunit 
composition and dissociation behaviour, which is related 
to the need to have a structure adapted to the drying 
out and wetting up of the seed, and by their amino acid 
composition, which is related to their function as storage 
compounds. Furthermore, their existence in different 
plants should be revealed by serological cross-reactivity. 
Thus, serological studies have shown that proteins im-
munologically related to vicilin and legumin of Piswn 
sativum and Vicia faba occur in other members of the 
Fabeac and Trifolieae. On the other hand, lack of cross-
reactivity belwcen Vicia faba and members of the Pha-
seoleae docs not imply that homologous proteins do not 
occur there also, since a single change in the amino acid 
sequence of a protein can have a drastic effect serologi-
cally [110, I I I ] . This section, therefore, presents a repre-
sentative selection of the data on the structure and com-
position of legume storage globulins, in order to itemise 
their general basic characteristics and to assess I he ex tent 
of their distribution in higher plants. 
L l i G U M I N 
Many dicotyledonous seeds have been shown to con-
tain proteins which occur in large amounts and which 
have sedimentation coefficients or approximately 11S 
and/or MW's in the region of 300000-400000. A compre-
hensive list is given in Table 1. together with their known 
physical characteristics. Sedimentation coefficients of 
supposedly identical globulins sometimes differ consider-
ably, e.g. 10-8-14-6 for ihe peanut globulin, arachin; 
however, equivalent globulins have not been examined 
always at the same protein conccntration(s) or in the

A globulin component, ^-globulin, of similar size to 
legumin, is also present in some monocotyledons. Both 
Qucnscl [157] and Danielsson [16] found a. component 
with sedimentation constant of 12-05 and M W of 
300000, in the embryos of Honleum uulyaie. Of the 
monocotyledons he investigated, Daniclsson found this 
5-globulin only in II. uulyurc'and then in small and vari-
able amounts. Since then, Pence and Elder [158] have 
observed a (5-globulin in Triticuin aeslivum. which lias 
an S 2 0 > l l, value of 10-64S. and Morita and Yoshida [159] 
have reported the presence of a r5-globulin in the em-
bryos of Oryza satiua. Cocas nucifera, another monocoty-
ledon, has a seed protein with S% value of 11-37 [160]. 
The amino acid composition of a representative 
sample of these 11S proteins (Table 2). suggests they have 
a storage role and may be equivalent proteins, since they 
all have a high content of amides (glutamic acid-gluta-

mine, aspartic acid-asparagine and arginine). A wide  
variation is seen in the reported values for their cysteine 
and methionine contents, but the most likely causes of 
this variation arc the low level of these amino acids and 
the difficulties associated with their accurate determina-
tion. This may account for the fact that certain globulins 
have been reported as being completely devoid of cys-
teine [2, 50]. The glycoprotein nature of the I IS globulin 
of Glycine max [162-164], Arachis hypoaaea [86. 165], 
Pliaseulus aureus [80], Vicia faha [57]. Phaseolus vulgaris 
(Derbyshire, E., unpublished results) and Brassiea spp. 
[109], has been investigated. Generally, the carbohydrate 
content is low ( < 1%) and is mainly in the form of neu-
tral sugars, although glucosamine [80] and galactosa-
mijie [109] have geen identified in two cases. 
It is apparent from the data assembled in Tables I -
and 2 that there arc many similarities between the t IS 
protein isolated from these different sources. However, 
this information is insufficient to decide if most legume 
seeds have an homologous counterpart to the legumin

of Pisum sativum and it is. therefore, necessary to exa-
mine the evidence of their subunit structures. 
The molecular size of the globulins has always been 
indicative of the existence of a subunit structure and this 
has been substantiated by data from dissociation studies 
and A'-tcrminal amino acid analysis. However, there are 
only a few instances in which subunit structure has been 
examined in detail, or where subunits have been isolated 
for further characterisation; the relevant data have been 
collected together in Table 3. This is not an exhaustive 
list but gives those subunit structures which have been 
studied in most detail; the data demonstrate the striking 
similarities in the properties of the subunits of the IIS 
globulin from different sources. Each globulin has both 
acidic and basic subunits with MW's between 
27000-37000 and 20000-24000 respectively. The subunit 
MWs_prcscntcd in Table 3 may not be directly compar-
able however, as they were obtained by two different 
techniques, namely SDS gel electrophoresis and ullracen-
trifugation, and the range of MW's may prove to be 
narrower than that reported in the table. The variation 
in the number and characteristics of both acidic and 
basic subunits reported by different workers (see Table 3), 
is probably attributable to the different resolving powers 
of the analytical techniques they employed. Glycine is 
the A'-terminal amino acid of the basic subunits of all 
the globulins and leucine is one of the AMermini or the 
acidic subunits of three of them (Table 3). These two 
amino acids also figure predominantly in the A'-terminal 
amino acids of other I IS globulins [79, 109, 119, 161], 
and consequently this may represent a general property 
of legumin-likc storage globulins. 
An indication of how closely the subunils of these 
globulins resemble one another can be gauged from 
amino acid composition data. This is presented in Tables 
4a and b for the acidic and basic subunits respectively, 
of legumin of Vicia faba and Vicia saliva, edestin of Can-
nabis saliva and glycinin of Glycine max. There is a re-
markable similarity in the amino acid composition of 
subunits of the same type and significant differences be-
tween the compositions of the acidic and basic subunits. 
Thus, the acidic subunits are all richer in glutamic acid-
glutamine than the basic subunits, while the latter con-
tain more alanine, valine and leucine. The variable amino 
acid composition of both the acidic and basic subunits 
from different sources may indicate that only parts of 
the molecule have been conserved, presumably those 
parts most intimately involved in maintaining the ter-
tiary and quaternary structure of the protein. Confirma-
tion of this must await primary sequence investigations.

Storage proteins of legume seeds II 
The only information so far is that of Dlouha et al. 
[169], who examined the structure of peptides isolated 
from a tryptic hydrolysate of the A-chain of cdcslin. 
Their results indicate localisation of groups of acidic, 
neutral and basic amino acid residues. 
A universal legumin-like storage globulin could be en-
visaged as having a structure compatible with the above 
characteristics, i.e. it would consist of twelve subunits 
with equimolar amounts of two types, acidic and basic, 
which differ in their MW's. these being 27000-37000 and 
20000-24000 respectively. However, there is some evi-
dence of greater complexity. Thus, Catsimpoolas and 
Wang [170] observed numerous bands when the acidic 
or basic subunits of glycinin were subjected to analytical 
scanning isoelectric focusing in urca-dithiothreitol 
media. They attributed the multiplicity of components 
mainly to differences in the primary structure of Ihe sub-
units, although no conclusive evidence was presented 
to substantiate this statement. Similarly, isoelectric focus-
ing or either acidic or basic subunits of CM-lcgumin of 
Vicia faba in 6 M urea revealed approximately 8 com-
ponents [65] (Wright, D. J., unpublished data), although 
in this case variation in charge modification as a result 
of carboxymcthylation may have been the cause. 
Recently, Yotsuhashi and Shibasaki [119] published 
details of an arachin structure in which the latter was 
comprised of 6 kinds of subunits having the average M W 
of 29000 (SS0 i. = 18) and which possessed 3 glycine, 
2 leucine (isoleucine) and 1 valine residue as the /V-ter-
minal amino acids. Whilst this model obviously has 
many similarities with those subunit structures listed in 
Table 3. other studies on arachin have revealed a more 
complex subunil structure. Thus, whilst Singh and Diec-
kert [85] reported substantial amounts of 6 subunits 
with MW's of approximately 15000, 24000, 29000, 
37000, 41000 and 43000, and Shetty and Rao [86] found 
the predominant subunils had MW's of 18000, 25000, 
33000 and 38000, both groups of workers observed ad-
ditional subunits with MW's between 15000 and 70000. 
Although components with MW's approximating to 
those of the acidic and basic subunits listed in Table 
3 were found, further investigations are required to ex-
plain the apparent multiplicity of subunit species, and 
Ihe differences in the proposed structures of the arachin 
molecule. 
The heterogeneity observed in the acidic and basic sub-
units poses an interesting question, namely, is there a 
unique legumin molecule composed of all these subunits 
or does legumin exhibit polymorphism, i.e. are there 
several types of legumin comprised of different subunits'.' 
It has already been established that the peanut protein, 
arachin, exists in nature in three variant forms which 
differ in their subunit compositions and also in their rela-
tive proportions in different seeds [165, 171]. Four dis-
tinct subunits were identified, viz. a and /?, with MW's 
of 35000, and y and a with MW's of 10000; the most 
probable structures for the 3 variant forms were given 
as a 4 / j 4 y 2 ^ 2 -
 a i 1 a i^yi^i a n d B v 2^2-
Although detailed structural studies on the remaining 
seed globulins given in Table 1 do not exist, the fact 
thai many of them are known to undergo dissociation 
in a comparable manner to legumin, edestin and glycinin, 
indicates I ha I their subunit structures may be similar. 
Dissociation proceeds in a stepwise fashion as follows 
~ I IS> ~7Sf 
3S ~2S (acidic and basic subunits) 
The conditions and the extent of dissociation vary from 
one globulin to another. Thus, arachin forms a reversible 
dissociating system between the climeric (I4-6S) and 
monomcric (9S) species [118], the latter being favoured 
at alkaline pH and low ionic strength. This has also been 
demonstrated for the 1 IS globulins of 3 species of lupin 
seed (Lupimis amjustifolius. L. albus and L. I ulcus [37. 
124] and. more recently, the IIS globulin of seeds of 
Helianiluis animus was reported to dissociate into a 7S 
component at ionic strengths below 0-3 [68]. Wolf and 
Briggs [172] observed that glycinin underwent reversible 
dissociation to 7S and 3S species when the ionic slrength 
of its solutions was lowered. On the other hand, some 
I IS globulins have been reported not to undergo associa-
tion-dissociation reactions with changes in ionic slrength 
in the pH range which is generally regarded as being 
non-denaturing for seed globulins, i.e. pH values between 
-4-5 and 9-5 [173]. These include the globulins from 
Vicia faha [124], Vicia sativa [88] and Pisum sativum 
[128, 129]. Dissociation of these globulins and also more 
extensive dissociation of the aforementioned globulins 
can be accomplished by employing acidic or alkaline 
pH's outside this 'stability range', or, alternatively, by 
the use of detergents, guanidine hydrochloride or urea 
[79. 125. 172. 174-177]. Thus, treatment of Icgumin of 
Vicia faba with ascorbic acid at pH 2-2 caused irrevers-
ible dissociation [178], at pH 2-8 legumin of Vicia sutiva 
dissociated completely to a component with an S 2 0 , 
value of2-4 [88] and Johnson and Richards [127] obtained 
3S species from the legumin of Pisum sativum at pH 2-05. 
Similarly, the I IS globulin of Brassica napus dissociated 
into components with sedimentation coefficients of 3S 
and 2-3S at pH 3-6 and in 6 M urea respectively [83]. 
On the other hand, legumin of Vicia sativa was reported 
as undergoing dissociation to components of roughly the 
same sedimentation coefficient (2-48S and 2-49S). in 4 M 
guanidine hydrochloride [106] and at pH below Ihe iso-
electric point [88] respectively, although Ihe MW's of 
these two components calculated by the method of 
Trautman [179]. were 30000 and 58000 respectively. 
Ionic strength has been shown to have a marked effect 
on acid denaturalion. For example, at pH 2-2 the slowest 
sedimcnting fraction of glycinin was observed lo change 
from 5S at 0-2 ionic strength lo 4S al 0-1 ionic strength, 
and finally with time to 2S [180]. Although the dissocia-
tion of the 1 IS molecule at acidic pH was counteracted 
by increasing ionic strength, it precipitated at 1-0 ionic 
strength on standing, indicating that some conforma-
tional change had occurred. Koshiyama [69] observed 
that addition of 0-1 M NaCI to a solution of glycinin 
in 01 N HC1. pH 2. altered the sedimentation coefficient 
from 2-48S to 3-75S. The latter author suggested that 
acid denaiuration not only caused dissociation of the 
protein into subunits by electrostatic repulsion of 
charged groups, but also resulted in the unfolding of the 
polypeptide chains. The question or whether the 3S dis-
sociation product is an artefact or whether it exists as 
such in Ihe native molecule or indeed whether its si ma-
ture involves disulphidc cross-links or some other type 
or bonding, e.g. non-polar, hydrophobic interactions, re-
mains lo be answered. Nevertheless, the establishment 
of 3S and 2S subunits as separate entities now seems 
to be beyond doubt and this removes some of the confu-
sion engendered by earlier work. Thus, the 3S subunits 
produced by acid treatment of the globulins of Cuciirbita 
spp. [181] and the 13S globulin from Fagopynim esculen-
12 E. DERBYSHIRE. D . J. WRIGHT and D . BOULTER 
turn [145] probably do not represent the monomeric sub-
units as suggested by the corresponding authors, but 
they may undergo further dissociation by selection of 
the appropriate conditions. 
The relative ease of disruption of the molecular struc-
ture of these globulins indicates that most, if not all, 
of the interchain bonding is non-covalent in nature, e.g. 
hydrogen bonding. There arc, however, a number of in-
stances where covalcnt links, i.e. disulphidc bridges, have 
been implicated in the bonding between subunits. Dlouha 
ei id. [105] reported that the A and B chains of edes-
tin were joined by disulphicle bonds, and more recently, 
Wright and Boulter [64] published a subunit structure 
for legumin of Vicia faha, in which the acidic and basic 
subunits formed 'intermediary' subunits via disulphidc 
bridges. These 'intermediary' subunits could correspond 
to the 3S component depicted in the dissociation scheme 
above. Disulphide-bonded subunits have also been 
shown to exist in solutions of both dissociated arachin 
[85. 171. 182] and dissociated glycinin [166]. In all these 
cases disulphidc-bridgcd subunits were shown to be pres-
ent by conducting dissociation studies first in the absence 
and then in the presence of a reducing agent. However, 
as Tombs and Lowe [16] and Wright [65] point out. 
it is possible that these subunits represent artefacts pro-
duced by disulphidc bond formation between sulphydryl 
groups, exposed as a result of disruption of secondary 
and tertiary structure by the dissociating agent: this 
phenomenon has been observed in studies of other pro-
tein systems, e.g. myosin [183]. Clarification of the pos-
ition with regard to disulphicle bridges is complicated 
by the fact that most isolation and purification pro-
cedures include a reducing agent at some stage to mini-
mize the possibility of intermolecular disulphide bond 
formation leading to protein aggregation [184], and it 
has been reported that even in a native molecule, disul-
phidc groups arc apparently accessible to reducing 
agents [ 185]. Because of the non-covalcnt forces operating 
between subunits, any reduction of internal disulphide 
bonds would only become apparent a her dissociation of 
the molecule. It may thus have to be recognised that 
the true state of disulphidc-sulphydryl groups in the 
native molecule can only be ascertained from a preparation 
free from reducing agent. 
The size of the seed globulins would appear to make 
the elucidation of their 3-dimensional structure a formid-
able problem. Nevertheless, some progress has been 
made with the aid of electron microscopy. Thus, edestin 
was observed to be a spherical particle with a diameter 
of -80-85 A [186-188], and more recently, two 3-di-
mcnsional models, based on electron microscopy exper-
iments were proposed for glycinin [93, 189]. In one 
model [93], glycinin consists of two annular-hexagonal 
structures packed one on top of another and each com-
posed of 6 subunits. It is suggested that alternation of 
acidic and basic subunits within the structure contributes 
by ionic interactions to the stability of the molecule. 
Such a structure in which all the binding forces are 
equivalent and non-covalent in character docs not ex-
plain, however, the apparent stability of the 3S moiety 
produced by acid denaturation of glycinin [123, 172, 
190] and or other IIS globulins [83, 88, 127, 145. 191]. 
I f one assumes, on the other hand, that these 3S com-
ponents contain disulphidc crosslinks, whether inherent 
or as artefacts, it (hen becomes difficult to explain the 
production of smaller subunits (2S) by the action of urea 
or guanidine hydrochloride, neither of which is capable 
of reducing disulphide bonds. Thus, Vaintraub and Shu-
tov [190] observed that at pH 2-6 glycinin dissociated 
to a 3-5S component, whereas treatment with 4 M urea, 
even in the absence of 2-mercaptocthanol, resulted in 
dissociation to a species with an S 2 0  . value of 
2-04S. 
The wide distribution of IIS seed protein (sec Table 
I) which, when investigated in more detail from different 
sources, shows considerable chemical and structural 
similarities (see Tables 2-4), is insufficient evidence to 
equate this protein with the legumin of Pisum. The infor-
mation to date gives some idea of the properties we may 
expect of a protein which is equivalent to legumin but 
the data are too incomplete to make a decision as to 
the extent of its distribution. Serological studies also 
have been used to determine the extent to which legumin 
occurs in different legumes and the results of these 
studies are gathered together in Table 5. 
Dudman and Millerd [31] found that all representa-
tives of the tribes Fabeae (Vicicac), Trifolieae and Ononi-
deae examined, contain proteins which gave identical 
cross-reactions with legumin of Vicia faha. except for 
Cicer and two species of Ononideae. where there was 
only partial identity. Legumin of partial immunological 
identity was also established to be present in Davicsiu 
mimosoides and Swainsonia stipularis and some evidence 
for a legumin-like protein was obtained in the Lotcac 
and Coronillcae. but this will need confirmation. Legu-
min was not detected immunologically in the tribes So-
phorcac, Dalbergieac, Genistcae and Phaseoleac. Where-
as Kloz and Turkova [95] found essentially the same 
results with the Vicieae, Gcnisteac and Phaseoleac, con-
trary to the finding of Dudman and Millerd [31] they 
did not detect legumin in the 3 members of the Trilblieac 
which they examined. Kloz and Turkova [95] used anti-
bodies prepared against the protein of Pisum sativum, 
whereas Dudman and Millcrd [31] used those or Vicia 
faha. The latter workers however, showed immunological 
identity between the legumin of Pisum sativum and Vicia 
faha.

Legumes in which seed globulins with sedimentation 
coefficients of - 7S have been identified, are listed in 
Table 6. The chemical compositions of 7S globulin frac-
tions arc very similar to one another and this is true 
whether we are considering pure 7S proteins or vicilin 
preparations which are known to contain more than one 
vicilin type protein (see later). Representative data are 
given in Table 7. which shows that all fractions contain 
substantial quantities of the dicar boxy lie acids and/or 
their amides and small amounts of methionine; cysteine, 
except in Lupinus and Aracliis. and tryptophan, arc cither 
absent or present in very low amounts. 
In those preparations where amide nigrogen has been 
determined, the amide content is very high (Table 7). 
reflecting their role as storage proteins. The level of ar-
ginine is not as high as in legumin. except in Lupinus 
spp. and Arachis hypogaea. but is higher generally than 
in the standard protein of Smith [196]. 
Carbohydrate has been reported in preparations from 
Vicia faha [200], Phascolus aureus [80]. lJliasi>olus vul-
garis [87] and Glycine max [66]. The latter two prep-
arations arc very similar in their content of neutral 
sugars (4-5 and 4-8%) and hexosamine (I I and 1-2%): the 
preparations from Vicia faha and Pliaseulux aureus con-
tained less than 2% neutral sugars and 0 2% hexosaminc.

/V-terminal analysis of 7S globulin fractions results in 
the labelling of several (up to 9) amino acids in the same 
preparation (Table 8) and often only the more heavily 
labelled amino acids are reported. Serine is common to 
all preparations and aspartate and/or glutamalc is 
usually labelled. The relatively large number of /V-ter-
mini may be due lo the presence of an equal number 
of different polypeptide chains in the globulin, or, 
alternatively, it could reflect the difficulties which are in-
herent in the successful application of the technique. Ser-
ine, for example, is often present as a contaminant and 
a control reaction should be carried out using dansyla-
lion without subsequent hydrolysis to detect such con-
taminants. 
Vicilin-lypc proteins have been identified immunologi-
cally in the Fabeac (Vicieae) and Trifolicac (Table 9), 
but only with Vicia and Pisum was identical cross-reacti-
vity obtained [31]. They also obtained some evidence 
for vicilin-typc proteins in the Ononideae, Podalyricae. 
Lotcac, but not in the Sophorcae, Dalbergieae, Genis-
teac, Astragalcac. Coronilleae and Phaseoleac. Kloz and 
Turkova [95] using antiscra to Pisum vicilin also identi-
fied vicilin-typc proteins in the Vicieae and Trifolieae, 
and failed to detect them in the Phaseoleae and Genis-
teac; the vicilin-like proteins of Vicia. Lens and Lathyrus 
gave cross-reactivity of identity. Klozova and Kloz [203] 
prepared anti-bodies to phascolin [204] (7S globulin 
preparation of Phaseolus) and tested these against 
various other legume extracts. Whilst extracts of some 
members of the genus Phaseolus contained a protein 
which was identical immunologically with phaseolin, 
others did not cross-react; other genera or the Phaseo-
leae and those of the tribes Coronilleae and Vicieae 
which were examined, also gave negative results. Bourdil-
lon's phaseolin has properties similar in many respects 
to those or glycoprotein I I , the major 7S globulin or 
Phaseolus vulgaris [87]. However, since these proteins 
were purified by different procedures, identity between 
them cannot be assumed. 
The "classical" legumin preparations of Osborne and 
Danielsson are not pure, but contain some vicilin as well 
as other contaminating proteins. More sophisticated 
fractionation procedures have led to the preparation or 
pure legumin, but modern methods or characterisation 
have also shown that this protein accounted for most 
or the protein in the legumin fractions or earlier investi-
gators. The "classical" vicilin Traction, on the other hand, 
when subjected to modem separatory techniques, has 
been shown to contain more than one major protein.

i;n by Danielsson's procedures have been separated into 
2 and 3 fractions respectively, by DEAE cellulose 
chromatography [78, 79]; that of Dolichos iahlab lias 
been shown to contain three proteins by chroma-
tography on hydroxylapatite [120], and those of Vicia 
faba [5. 65] Arachis hypogaea [205], Glycine max [206] 
and Phaseolus aureus [207], contain at least two com-
ponents as shown by a variety of methods. 
The vicilin fraction of Pisum sativum separates, at low 
ionic strength in the ultracemrifugc, into 2 molecular 
species, 7S and IIS [128]. The first of these proleins 
probably corresponds to the component which eluted 
from a cellulose column with the starting buffer, i.e. was 
not adsorbed, when Grant and Lawrence fractionated 
Pismn vicilin by ion-exchange chromatography on 
DEAE cellulose [79]. The second protein, which at low 
ionic strength sedimcntcd as an I IS species, probably 
corresponds to the adsorbed component of Grant and 
Lawrence since this component, at 0-3 ionic strength ex-
isted in both 7S and 1 IS forms. Ghetie and Buzila [70, 
71] used the same technique to obtain corresponding 
fractions which were then shown to be immunologically 
identical. These latter authors showed that the unad-
sorbed protein from the DEAE cellulose column is 
smaller, with a M W of 150000, and is less soluble at 
low temperature than the adsorbed protein, which has 
a M W of 190000. Different proportions of the two pro-
teins were obtained from different batches of seed. When 
the pH is lowered from 7 0 to 6-2 at low ionic strengths, 
the two proteins do not associate further (Derbyshire. 
E., unpublished) and in this respect they differ from the 
major protein of Phaseolus vulgaris, Glycoprotein I I (see 
later). We conclude that the vicilin fraction of Pisum sati-
vum contains 2 major proteins. One of these is cold sol-
uble, has a M W of approximately 190000. and associates 
to an I IS form at low ionic strength at pH values of 
7 0 and 6-2 and the other is a cryoprotein of M W 150000, 
which does not associate at low ionic strength at pH 
values of 7 0 and 6 2. 
Thus, although the 7S fraction from different legumes 
shows substantial chemical similarities (Tables 7 and 8), 
the heterogeneity of this fraction from Pisum sativum 
raises the question, is the major 7S protein of different 
legumes always the same equivalent protein? This ques-
tion will only be answered when the proteins have been 
fully characterised. So far only three 7S proleins. two 
from Glycine max [66. 74. 99] (Koshiyama. I . , personal 
communication) and one from Phaseolus vulgaris [87] 
have been purified and characterised. The major 7S pro-
tein of Glycine max corresponds in at least three proper-
ties to the larger of the two vicilins of Pisum sativum. 
but the minor 7S protein of Glycine max and the 7S 
protein of Phaseolus vulgaris have different properties to 
both of the vicilins of Pisum sativum. 
The major IS protein from Glycine max isolated by 
Koshiyama [74. 99] is cold soluble, has a M W of 
I80O0O-2I0000 at high ionic strength (S? 0.w = 7-92. 
/ = 0-5), and associates to a larger molecular species, the 
size of which (9S-12S) is dependent on protein concen-
tration, at low ionic strength (/ = 01) (Tables 6 and 10); 
its isoelectric point is pH 4-9 and it contains 15 9% Kjc l -
dahl nitrogen and 5% carbohydrate. Organic phosphorus 
is absent. It has an amino acid composition which is 
similar to that of other seed 7S proteins, i.e. a high con-
tent of aspartate and glulamate residues, and a low con-
tent of 4-cystine and methionine. Amide ammonia ac-
counts for 1-7% of the protein and eight different Af-tcr-
minal amino acids have been reported. It dissociates to 
5S and 2S forms in 001 M HC1, to 3S in detergent and 
to IS-2S in urea. The 7S globulin of Glycine max has 
been isolated and characterised also by Roberts and 
Briggs [76], who employed ammonium sulphate precipi-
tation. Only 4% of the 7S globulin present initially was 
recovered as the pure protein, but it was regarded as 
typical of the initial material as judged by its association 
to a 9S-12S form at low ionic strength, its dissociation 
to a 3S form in the presence of detergent and its behav-
iour during chromatography on calcium phosphate. 
Koshiyama regards his own preparation as a more 
highly purified form of the Roberts and Briggs protein 
and discounts the remarkably high M W (300000) deter-
mined for the latter. The major protein of the Roberts 
and Briggs preparation is identical with ji conglycinin, 
one of four globulins from Glycine max separated by 
Immunoelectrophoresis [208]. and Koshiyama (personal 
communication) has identified his own protein with /f 
conglycinin. Catsimpoolas and Ekcnstam [208] reported 
identity between Koshiyama's protein and y conglycinin, 
an immunoelectrophorctic component different from ft 
conglycinin; however, Koshiyama has isolated y congly-
cinin and has shown that it differs from his major 7S 
globulin. Thus, it is probable that Catsimpoolas and Ek-
enstam had not reproduced the preparative conditions 
employed by Koshiyama and had, in Tact, isolated y con-
glycinin and not the major 7S globulin. Gamma congly-
cinin has a M W of 104000 (S? 0 i. = 6-6), an isoelectric 
point at pH 5-8 and a carbohydrate content of 5% (w/w). 
The protein does not associate at low ionic strength, at 
pH 7-6. and it is not an agglutinin. The concentration 
of y conglycinin in the crude 7S globulin fraction is ap-
proximately 10%. 
The major 7S protein (Glycoprotein II) from Pltaseolus 
vulgaris has a M W or 140000 (S%.. = 7-6) (Table 6) and 
associates to a 19S form in the pH range 3-4-6-4. It does 
not associate to an I IS form at low ionic strength in 
the pH range. pH 2-2-8-0.' Glycoprotein I I has an isoelec-
tric point of pH 5-4 and contains 15-5% Kjeldahl 
nitrogen. 5-5% carbohydrate and only trace amounts of 
phosphorus. It has a lower content of gliitamale and 
a higher content of methionine and tryptophan than the

major 7S protein of Glycine max: amide ammonia ac-
counts for 1-8%, of the protein. I l dissociates to a 2S 
form in guanidinc hydrochloride. Pusztai and Watt [87] 
recovered only 9% of the total protein as pure glycopro-
tein H ; however, a protein fraction which accounts for 
35% of the total protein is almost identical in properties 
to glycoprotein I I [209]. The 7S globulin (Gl) isolated 
from Phaseolus vulgaris by acid extraction [100] associ-
ates to 18S in the pH range 3-8-5-4 and dissociates to 
3S at pH 12 and is equivalent to glycoprotein I I . 
A disconcerting discrepancy in the literature, is the 
assignment by Daniclsson [25] of sedimentation coeffi-
cients of 11-OS to phaseolin and 7-3S- to conphascolin, 
the major and minor globulins respectively of Pluiseolus 
vulgaris [210]. However, reference to the text and Fig. 
J LB of Danielsson's original report [16] shows clearly 
that the major globulin sediments as a 7S species and 
is equaled with vicilin. McLecstcr el al. [211] also report 
a high (I2S) sedimentation coefficient for the major pro-
tein of Phaseolus vulgaris, but in a subsequent publica-
tion [100] a I2S form is not recorded and the same 
globulin is shown to sediment as a 7S globulin and to 
associate to an I8S species at acid pH, i.e. it is equivalent 
to glycoprotein I I . 
The data available for 7S proteins of other species are 
very sparse and this limitation precludes their positive 
identification with any of the 7S globulins already de-
scribed. The Tact that there are usually several com-
ponents in the 7S fraction, none of which has been pro-
perly separated and characterised, is a further complica-
tion. 
7S proteins which associate at low ionic strength 
(/ = 01) (Table 10) and thus resemble the major 7S 
globulin of Glycine max, have been identified as major 
globulins in Arachis hypogaea [192], Vigna unguiculata 
and Lupinus albus [124, 130]. Major 7S proteins which 
do not associate at low ionic strength have been identi-
fied in preparations from Vicia faba [130], Vicia sativa 
[88], Lupinus angustifolius, Lupimts luteus and Phaseolus 
timaius [35, 125, 130] (see Table 6). However, the latter 
proteins were not examined at pH 6 and, therefore, it 
is not possible to discriminate between those which may 
be equivalent to Glycoprotein I I and those which may 
be equivalent to the smaller of the 7S vicilins of Piston. 
The major protein fraction, canavalin, of Canavalia ensi-
forinis [212-214] resembles the 7S globulin fraction of 
Pisum. since approximately 50% of the protein associates 
to I IS at low ionic strength at pH 7-0 and an equal quan-
tity remains as a 7S protein (Derbyshire, E., unpub-
lished); at pH 6-4 and high ionic strength both proteins 
exist as 7S species, whereas at low ionic strength both 
7S and I IS species occur. 
On the basis of the ultracentriTuge data 3 different 
types of 7S globulin can be recognised. One of these 
does not associate at low ionic strength, the second as-
sociates to an 1 IS species at pH 7 at low ionic strength 
and the third associates, to an 18S species, only at pH 
values below pH 7. 
Globulins with sedimentation coefficients of approxi-
mately 7S have been identified in a few other dicoty-
ledons, including Helianthus animus [147], Beta vulgaris 
[137], Telfairea pedata [156]. Cucurbila maxima [215] 
and Gossypium barbadense [216]. Except in Gossypium, 
they represent only minor components of the globulin 
fractions which consist mainly of 12S protein. Since, for 
example, the lS protein of soyabean is often accom-
panied by a small quantity of its monomer, the 7S form 
of glycinin [208, 217], it is possible that the 7S globulin 
of the non-legume dicotyledons may be a form of legu-
min; however, in the absence of other data the possibility 
that they are vicilins cannot be overlooked. 
An 8S globulin, y globulin, is the major globulin of 
embryos of Hordeum vulgare [16] and Oryza sativa 
[159], and a similar protein is also found as the major 
seed globulin of 7 other genera of the Gramineae. The 
y globulin of rice has been resolved into 3 proteins and 
at least one or these is a glycoprotein [218, 219]. A I2S 
globulin was not detectable in these monocotyledons, ex-
cept in barley, rice and wheat [158]. in which it occurred 
as a minor component. However, it would be premature 
to equate the y globulins with vicilin. In Cocos nucifera 
an 8S globulin is accompanied by a much greater con-
centration of I2S globulin [160].

Storage proteins of legume seeds 17 
A greater uncertainly surrounds the subunit structures 
of the 7SLstorage globulins than those of the I IS globu-
lins, and this is a reflection of the existence of several 
vicilin-like proteins and also the heterogeneity of most 
7S preparations. The data available is limited almost 
completely to the apparent MW's of the subunits (Table 
I I ) and the different methods used make it difficult to 
compare the values, especially those of Glycine max. 
However, it is apparent in most cases that the subunils 
are not linked by disulphide bridges since the inclusion 
of 2-mcrcaptoethanol in the dissociating media docs not 
alter (he size of the dissociation products. 
Different MW's have been assigned to the subunits of 
the 7S globulin of soyabean isolated in three laborator-
ies, possibly due to lack of identity between the prep-
arations used. The MVV of the subunils in 8 M urea was 
determined in the ultracentrifuge as 23UOO bv Koshiya-
ma [222] and as 35000 by Okubo el al. [121]; both 
workers used an assumed frictional ratio value. Higher 
values for the MW's of the subunits were obtained by 
Masaki and Socjima [108] who isolated urea dissociated 
globulin components with MW's of 81000 and 51000 
as determined on SDS gels. Koshiyama [220] estimated, 
on the basis of AMcrminal amino acids, that there were 
9 subunits in his major 7S protein fraction: however, 
the MW's of the 2 components isolated by Masaki and 
Socjima suggest that there arc 3 subunits and the /V-tcr-
minal amino acid analysis of the 2 components gave as-
partate (and serine) and serine respectively, which is con-
sistent with this number. 
The estimated MW's of subunils of the Phaseohis vul-
garis 7S globulin arc higher than those determined for 
the soyabean subunits by Koshiyama [220] and Okubo 
el al. [121]. Thus, Pusztai and Watt [87] obtained a 
range of values between 35000 and 43000 for Glycopro-
tein I I by a variety of methods and they suggest that 
there are three or four subunits in this protein. Barker. 
R. D. J. (unpublished) prepared the major 7S globulin 
of Phaseolus vulgaris by cryoprccipilation and resolved 
the subunits into two components in the molar ratio 
2:1 with MW's 50000 and 47000. Although these values 
are different from those of Pusztai and Watt [87], the 
methods of preparation of (he 7S globulin differed and, 
in any case, absolute reliance cannot be placed on values 
of MW's, particularly of glycoproteins, determined on 
SDS gels. Subunits with MW's 50000 and 47000 are the 
major subunits also of the cold soluble 7S globulin and 
of the 7S globulin prepared by ammonium sulphate pre-
cipitation but in these preparations other subunils were 
identified as minor components which suggests that 
other globulins were present with Glycoprotein I I (Der-
byshire. E.. unpublished). Similar subunits. including the 
minor ones, arc found in other cultivars and species of 
Phaseolus including P. formosus and P. acuiifalius. al-
though the proportions of the subunits relative one to 
another arc different in different cultivars (Derbyshire, 
E.. unpublished). One of the minor subunils of Phaseolus 
vulgaris referred to above, has a M W of approximately 
30000 and has been subsequently identified as a 6S ag-
glutinin (Derbyshire. E.. unpublished). Recently. Pusztai 
and Wall [223] have also isolated a globulin agglutinin 
with subunit M W 30000 from Phuscohis vulgaris, al-
though the M W of the native protein was not reported. 
Subunits similar in size to those of the 6S agglutinin 
occur in 7S globulin fractions of other species and it 
is unfortunaie that these fractions have not been moni-
tored for agglutinating activity. 
Subunits with MW's similar to those of the other 
minor subunits of the 7S globulin fraction of Phaseolus 
vulgaris, i.e. 56000, 43000 and 23000, are major com-
ponents of the 7S globulin fractions of Pisum sativum 
and Canavalia ensiformis. In Vicia faba where 2 vicilins 
have been separated, one dissociates with major subunils 
with MW's 55000 and 46000 and the other dissociates 
with subunils with M W 43400 [65]. The 7S globulin 
isolated from Vignu tmguiculata represents another form 
of globulin, different from that of the vicilins of Vicia 
faba. since it dissociates to major subunits with M W 
56000 and 53000 (Carasco. J. and Culkecn, J., unpub-
lished): also. 7S globulin of Vigna unguiculala associates 
to an I IS form at low ionic strength in contrast to the 
vicilins of Vicia faha which remain as 7S protein under 
these conditions [130]. In this laboratory we assign a 
M W of 53000 to the major subunit of the 7S globulin 
of Phaseolus aureus. The subunit of M W 23000 of Pha-
seolus vulgaris is found in several other species (sec Tabic 
I I ) . In Lupinus angustifolius it is greatly enriched in one 
of the 7S globulin fractions [221], suggesting it is a sub-
unit of a specific globulin possibly equivalent to the 
major 7S globulin of Glycine max. since Koshiyama 
[220] estimates the M W of the lattcr's subunits as 23000. 
This subunit is absent in the 2 vicilins of Vicia faba and 
it is not a subunit of glycoprotein I I . 
Whilst there is sufficient similarity in the subunit pat-
terns of different taxa to suggest that equivalent vicilin 
proteins arc involved, it is not possible to be sure of 
how many, or whether the subunit MW's as determined 
on gels arc the minimum subunit MW's of the native 
proteins. It must be emphasized that neither the action 
of dissociating agents nor the bonding between seed 
globulin polypeptides is fully understood, and it is poss-
ible thai complete separation of the individual polypep-
tide chains is not achieved by the techniques of dissocia-
tion usually employed. Taken at face value the subunil 
patterns suggest that there may be as many as 5 different 
forms of 7S globulin, vicilins. each of which may be re-
cognised by I or 2 characteristic subunils (Table 12). 
The ratio of these forms may vary from species to species

and even in extracts prepared in different ways from the 
same species. Normally, it would appear that all the 
forms do not occur in a single species except possibly 
in Plmseolus mlyaris. The determination of the N-ter-
minal regions of the amino acid sequences is an impor-
tant next step in order to clarify the situation. 
Only in the case of the soyabean proteins have sub-
units actually been isolated [108] and only the amino 
acid composition of the component with M W 81000 was 
reported (Table 13). Comparison between this and the 
composition of the parent protein suggests that the 
amino acid composition of the 51000 subunit is different 
from that of the 81000 subunit; the 2 components also

Although I IS and 7S globulins are the major storage 
proteins of legume seeds, other globulins occur in ex-
tracts. A 1SS protein often accompanies purified legumin 
as a minor component in the ultiacentrifuge and its pres-
ence correlates with a minor component of low clectro-
phoretic mobility. Association of legumin via disulphide 
bridges during isolation possibly explains the occurrence 
of the 1SS form. Similarly, the observation of I8S globu-
lins in several legumes [16] could be due to the associ-
ation of a 7S globulin, since a 7S globulin is usually 
the major globulin of those species with an 18S com-
ponent. 
Smaller globulins. 2S 4S. arc also found in several 
legumes [16. 36, 55. 75. 92. 153. 192. 208]. other dicoty-
ledons [37, 83. 137, 138, 147, 156], and monocotyledons 
[16, 157, 224 226] (Table 14), and they account for more 
than 5% of the protein of one or more species from each 
of the 3 taxa. Two small globulins with sedimentation 
values of 2-8S and 2-3S have been isolated from soyabean 
meal and characterised [227], and a 2S globulin has been 
identified in protein body preparations of soyabean [69, 
208]. 2S proteins, which are water soluble during isola-
tion [35, 228, 229] and a 2S protein present in undialysed 
preparations [130] have been reported but their relation-
ships, if any, to the 2S globulins have not been investi-
gated. The amino acid compositions of the 2S globulins 
from 5 species are given in Table 15. and generally they 
show the major characteristics of those of storage pro-

tein. i.e. high concentrations of amides and concen-
trations of arginine greater than that in a standard pro-
tein [196]. There arc substantial differences in amino 
acid composition between the 2S globulins from different 
genera and even between those from species of the same 
genus, e.g. Brassica spp. The isolation of two 2S globulins 
from soyabean suggests that additional 2S globulins may 
eventually be shown to be present in oliiei preparations. 
Recently, a heterogeneous globulin fraction, y conglu-
tin, which includes a 10S molecular species, has been 
isolated from Lupimis amjuslifolius [221, 230]. The y con-
glutin dissociates to subunits with M W 40000 in the ab-
sence of reducing agents and 30000 and 17000 when 
reduced. It represents 10-25% of the total globulin in 
different cultivars and species of Lupimis and it was not

Storage pruleins of legume seeds 19 
observed previously because it is not resolved from the 
I IS and 7S globulins in the ultraccntrifugc. The relatively 
high concentration of this fraction in the seed extracts, 
its globulin nature and its occurrence in the protein body 
fraction, strongly suggest thai it is storage protein. It 
is of especial importance nutritionally, since it has a high 
content of sulpho-amino acids (4-2 g/16 g N) and its con-
centration, relative to that of other globulins, in the seed 
ranges from 10 to 25% in different cultivars [92, 230]. 
The importance of these characteristics in relation to a 
grain legume improvement programme has been empha-
sised and discussed elsewhere [91. 92. 231]. 
Biosynthesis and degradation 
It is not our intention to discuss the biosynthesis and 
degradation of legume storage protein in any detail, since 
this has been done elsewhere [232, 234]. However, per-
spective requires a brief mention of some aspects and 
these are given below. 
Typical protein bodies from seeds of legumes do not 
contain ribosomcs (e.g. see [1 ] ) and do not contribute 
significantly to protein synthesis [235]. The storage pro-
tein which accumulates in protein bodies is synthesised 
elsewhere, on membrane-bound or free cytoplasmic poly-
somes [236]. and is then channelled through the endo-
plasmic reticulum prior to packaging into the protein 
bodies [237]. 
Harris and Boulter [238] suggest that some of the 
cytoplasmic vesicles into which the storage protein of 
Vigna unguiculata is transferred may originate from the 
Golgi apparatus, although some may be formed by sub-
division of the main vacuole, which is the mechanism 
implicated in Phaseolus vulgaris [ I ] . The involvement of 
the Golgi apparatus in the deposition and transport of 
protein, including plant cell wall glycoprotein and secre-
tory proteins in animals has been demonstrated in a var-
iety of tissues (see [239] for references). 
11S and IS globulins are found together in protein 
body fractions isolated from soyabean [208, 240. 241]. 
peanut [205, 242] and broadbcan [243]. and legumin 
and vicilin are both laid down in the same protein bodies 
[9 ] , although the protein bodies of a seed may not all 
have identical protein compositions. 
The composition of the storage protein fraction of 
legumes changes during the course of accumulation of pro-
tein during seed development [5, 25. 28, 244-249], and 
these changes suggest that the rates of synthesis of indivi-
dual proteins differ and may even vary during ripening. 
Several investigations have employed electrophoresis of 
total seed protein or globulin to follow the changes 
which occur in individual proteins [4. 244. 247] and 
these results demonstrate that changes do occur and they 
give some indication of which elcctrophorclic com-
ponents are involved. However, different globulins may 
have similar clectrophorelic mobilitcs and this, together 
with the possible presence of both "monomeric' and "di-
mcric' forms of a protein [208. 248. 250]. prevents more 
detailed interpretation of the data. Similarly, results ob-
tained by use of the ultracentrifuge alone [25, 28] must 
also be interpreted with caution. In order to follow the 
changing protein pattern during seed development, pro-
teins must be monitored by one or more of their unique 
characteristics, for example, immunological determinants 
and subunit composition. The limited critical data which 
are available confirm that in Viciu faha [5. 9] and in 
Glycine max [249] the ratio of the major globulins ( I I S 
and 7S) change during ripening, and that at least one 
of the 7S'proteins of these species is synthesiscd. like 
that of Pisitm sativum [25. 28], earlier than the 1 IS pro-
tein. The 7S. protein of mature Viciafaba seeds has been 
separated into 2 vicilins. and it is probable that the differ-
ent vicilins are synthesised at different rates, since the 
subunit composition of the vicilin fraction of V. faha 
changes throughout the development or the seed [5 ] . The 
ratio of three individual electrophorctic components of 
the soyabean 7S protein also varies during ripening 
[249]. 
With the onset of germination the protein bodies in-
crease in volume and late in germination have increased 
fifty-fold [12, 13]. The expansion is accompanied by pro-
teolysis and it has been suggested [13. 243. 251] that 
latent enzymes, including protease and acid phosphatase, 
laid down in the protein bodies during ripening, arc acti-
vated as part of the germination process. 
Vicilin of Pisum sativum, phased in. arachin and the 
I IS and 7S globulins of soyabean arc degraded during 
germination to proteins of greater clcctrophorctic mobi-
lity as demonstrated by use of Immunoelectrophoresis 
[248. 250. 252-254]. Legumin and vicilin arc degraded 
at the same rate in Pisum sativum [255] but in other 
species, for example Liipimts luteus [256] and Glycine 
max [250, 257]. different relative rales of breakdown 
have been reported. Daussant [252. 258] suggests that 
a progressive deamidation of storage protein takes place 
as a first step in degradation, and that this is followed 
by cleavage of disulphidc bonds when these arc present. 
Further decrease in the size of the proteins is brought 
about by protease systems, the activity of which may 
be regulated by pH changes in the seed as a result of 
an accumulation of amides, and Ghclic [259] has pro-
posed that separation of protein and non-prolcin moi-
eties of conjugated storage proteins may be necessary be-
fore proteolysis can proceed. The polypeptides released 
by these successive steps arc then available for progress-
ive hydrolysis by the endo- and cxo-pcplidascs of the seed 
[260] to their constituent amino acid [14].

The storage globulins are complex proteins and the 
technology of their isolation, purification and characteri-
sation is only just becoming well enough understood for 
different laboratories to obtain comparable results. 
For this reason we have excluded from this review 
much of the work carried out in the first half of the 
century and for references to those investigations the 
reader is referred to the earlier reviews [10. 15. 54, 173, 
193, 261-263]. 
Usually globulins arc extracted within the pH range 
7-9; however, Hall and colleagues [4] have proposed 
a new method for the isolation of storage proteins using 
acid extraction to produce a G l and G2 globulin frac-
tion. The G l globulin fraction from Phaseolus vulgaris 
which McLeestcr et al. [211] called legumin, was subse-
quently equated with the major storage protein, Glyco-
protein I I [100. 264]. In our view. G l should not be 
referred to as legumin but as an impure preparation of 
Glycoprotein I I . The G2 fraction which sediments in the 
ultracentrifuge with a sedimentation coefficient of 6-6 and 
dissociates into subunils of M W 32000. they equated 
20 E. DiiKiiYSHiKi;. D. J. WRIGHT and D. BOULTEK 
with vicilin. However. Pusztai and Watt [223] have ex-
tracted 6S agglutinins from seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris 
with subunit MW's between 30000 and 34000, and one 
of these is a globulin. The agglutinating potential of the 
G2 fraction was not determined by Hall et al. [4 ] but 
comparable preparations in this laboratory examined by 
us, agglutinate red blood cells (Derbyshire, E.. unpub-
lished); this evidence suggests that the G2 fraction which 
is relatively pure, docs not represent a typical vicilin. 
The use of the acid extraction method with"" Vicia faba 
led to the production of much lower M W polypeptides 
than those obtained with Pliaseolus [178, 211], and in 
view of the general tendency of storage globulins to dis-
sociate at low pH values, it cannot be recommended for 
general use: an additional disadvantage of the method is 
the possible acceleration of dcamidalion in the presence 
of ascorbate [265]. 
On the basis of biological, structural and chemical 
composition data, it is concluded that proteins with at 
least some of the properties of legumin have been found 
in dicotyledons, other than legumes, and even in mono-
cotylcdonous plants. The similarity of this protein in dif-
ferent plants could be due either to convergent evolution 
in response to a common functional need, or to common 
ancestry. Only an investigation into amino acid sequence 
differences, similar to that conducted by Boulter [266] 
for cytochromes c. could provide the evidence to decide 
which of these two possibilities occurred. 
Conclusions as to extent of the distribution of legumin 
in plants depends on the criteria used to identify the 
protein. Dud man and Millcrd [31] investigated eleven 
tribes of the Lcguminosae serologically, and found that 
a legumin-likc protein was restricted to members of the 
Fabeac. Trifolieac. Podalyrieae. Aslralagcac and Ononi-
deac. However, it is clear from other homologous protein 
data sets such as those ofplastocyanin, that lack of cross-
reactivity between taxa cannot be taken as evidence of 
the absence of an homologous protein [267]. Jackson 
el al. [268'J using maps or tryptic peptides of globulin prep-
arations, found little resemblance between those or Vicia 
faba (Vicieae) and Phaseolus vulgaris (Phaseoleae), which 
again suggests the absence of homologous storage pro-
teins in these 2 tribes. However, there is a considerable 
amount of structural data [16] (Derbyshire, E., unpub-
lished), indicating that an I IS protein equivalent to legu-
min does occur in low concentration in Phaseolus vul-
garis. 
We conclude that it would be premature to adopt the 
suggestion of Hall et al. [4 ] and McLeester et al. [211] 
that the term 'Icguinin' should be dropped, or that of 
Millerd [232] that it should only be applied to this pro-
tein in the Vicieae and Trifolieac, even though in the 
past legumin preparations have not always been strictly 
equivalent due to the presence of different impurities. 
The retention of trivial names for legumin. such as edes-
tin. should also be retained for the present since they 
are widely used in the literature. 
The position with regard to vicilin is less clear-cut and 
much more work will be needed before a full understand-
ing of this fraction from different plants is .available. 
When sufficiently investigated, the vicilin fraction has 
been shown to contain more than one protein and as 
many as 5 forms of vicilin may exist. A similar situation 
to that already described for legumin exists with regard 
to the distribution of vicilin-likc proteins. Danielsson 
[16] has shown the presence of a 7S.peak in the ultracen-
trifugc with salt extracts of seeds from various tribes of 
the Leguminosae, including the Acacicac in the sub-
family Mimosoideac, and on this evidence alone has 
equated the protein responsible with his vicilin prep-
aration from Piswn. However, other proteins with sedi-
mentation coefficients close to those of the vicilins exist 
and hence ultraccntrifugal evidence of the presence of 
vicilin must be treated with caution. In contrast. Dud-
man and Millerd [31] using a vicilin fraction from Vicia 
faba, found immunological evidence of a vicilin-like pro-
tein in members of the Fabeae and Trifolicac, but not 
in those of the other nine legume tribes investigated. 
Even so. the physical and chemical data which arc avail-
able, suggest that 7S globulins arc of widespread occur-
rence. 
Dudman and Millerd [31], on the basis of serological 
data, have claimed, in contrast to Kloz and co-workers 
who also used serology, that legumin is more "primitive" 
than vicilin. Blagovcschcnskii [269] came to a similar 
conclusion on the basis of studies on legume seed weight, 
percentage nitrogen and type of seed protein, although 
the evidence for the statement is not fully substantiated 
as there arc inconsistencies in the correlations suggested. 
In our view, (he question as to whether or not one of 
these proteins is phylogenctically older than the other, 
cannot be decided on the present evidence since the cri-
teria used are insufficient. 
Although vicilin and legumin have been shown to be 
distinct serologically [9. 31]. it is possible that they may 
have subunit(s) in common since the separated subunits 
of vicilin and legumin have not been tested serologically. 
Analysis of SDS gel patterns to determine whether or 
not vicilin and legumin have common subunits, is made 
difficult by the presence on gels of weak bands; thus, 
although the bands clue to the major subunits arc not 
common, some of the minor component bands may be. 
An alternative approach to this problem is that of Jack-
son et al. [161] who used tryptic peptide maps. These 
indicated that there was considerable overlap in the pep-
tide patterns or legumin and vicilin. ranging from about 
80% with Pisum sativum to 40% with Cicer arietinum. 
and it is probable that the substantial similarity between 
fingerprint patterns can safely be interpreted as indicative 
of some degree of common structure. However, the prep-
arations of vicilin and legumin used by Jackson et al. 
[161] were cross-contaminated, although the legumin 
preparations contained very little vicilin and it is unlikely 
that it contributed significantly to the tryptic maps of 
legumin. 
Storage proteins arc synthesised by the usual riboso-
mal template mechanism [232, 233]. Since the products 
of this process are clearly defined we can expect that 
the storage proteins arc also carefully prescribed and this 
is borne out by the fingerprint data of Jackson el al., 
who showed that different species of the same genus gave 
virtually identical globulin fingerprints. However, since 
storage proteins each consist of several subunits. it is 
possible that several forms of the same protein may 
occur within an individual or in a population of indivi-
duals, and this has been shown to be the case with the 
storage protein, arachin, of pcaniits [165]. 
In Pisum the 2 immunologically identical vicilins (sec 
earlier) occur in different ratios in different populations 
[70]. Also, the subunit composition of the vicilin fraction 
from different varieties of pea varied in such a way as 
to suggest that Pisum vicilin is polymorphic [270]. In 
Storage proteins of legume seeds 21 
breeding tests carried out by Hynes vicilin was not 
maternally inherited [270] and Davis [271] found no evi-
dence of maternal inheritance when he analysed the elcc-
(rophorctic patterns of the total globulins of some hy-
brids of Piswn cultivars. but did in the case of others. 
Polymorphism of storage proteins may be of frequent 
occurrence and the possibility exists for a complex inter-
play between the different gene loci responsible for the 
subunits. not only of a specific vicilin but perhaps of 
different proteins. It is important, therefore, that genetic 
studies be carried out to ascertain the way in which dif-
ferent subunits may combine to give polymorphic pro-
teins. 
The fact that the relative proportions of the different 
storage proteins can differ considerably in different 
legume species [91], and also in different varieties of the 
same species [229, 230. 269]. suggests that there are pos-
sibilities Tor considerable change in the storage protein 
without loss of seed viability. However, constraints will 
operate on changes in the composition of storage pro-
tein, since it must satisfy the following requirements: 
(a) act as a suitable nitrogen store, i.e. have an amino 
acid composition which on hydrolysis will supply all the 
nitrogen compounds of the seedling using the enzymic 
machinery of the latter; (b) be synthesised on and pass 
into the rough endoplasmic reticulum; and (c) contain 
the subunit interaction groups to allow correct packag-
ing during seed maturation and subsequently unpackag-
ing during germination (the latter requirements relate to 
the specificity of the proteolytic system of the germinat-
ing seed).
