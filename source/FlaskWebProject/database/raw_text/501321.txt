Abstract 
Abstract 
Snake venom proteins are potential sources for novel drug design both for treatment of 
snake bites and for human haemostatic disorders. To achieve these, the basic sequence, 
structure and functional relationships of venom proteins should be understood. Proteolytic 
enzymes such as metallo and serine proteases are the major components of venom in vipers 
and are responsible for local and systematic envenomation effects. We have purified, 
partially sequenced and functionally characterised a serine protease, rhinocerase from the 
venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros. Rhinocerase is a multifunctional enzyme with 
kininogenase, clotting and defibrase activities. Crystallisation trials have resulted in small 
crystals. We have also purified, sequenced and functionally characterised a 
metalloprotease, rhiminopeptidase from the same venom. Crystallisation of this protein 
yielded slightly larger crystals and their preliminary data has been obtained. 
Rhiminopeptidase is a zinc dependent aminopeptidase A, with neutral and basic activities. 
The complete sequence of rhiminopeptidase was obtained via cDNA amplification and a 
three dimensional structural model was created. 9 further Bitis gabonica rhinoceros serine 
protease sequences have been obtained. These sequences fall into 2 groups: one with 2 
isoforms (high molecular weight serine proteases) and another with 7 isoforms (low 
molecular weight serine proteases). The latter have substitutions in their catalytic triad 
residues. To understand more about the sequence, structure and functional relationships of 
viper venom serine proteases (VVSPs), all complete VVSP sequences have been extracted 
from sequence database. Sequence analysis of VVSP sequences including our 9 sequences 
showed that VVSPs have high sequence similarities, share common sequence and structural 
features, and are predicted to be N-glycosylated. A phylogenetic tree has been generated 
and analysed in relation to enzyme function. Complete functions and determined structures 
of most of the VVSPs are unknown and they need to be obtained via experimental studies 
to understand more about their sequence, structure and functional relationships.

1. Introduction 
1. Introduction 
Each creature in the world has its own mechanisms to protect itself from its enemies. 
But sometimes, the stronger one will beat the weaker one with an extraordinary power. 
In that case the weaker one has to search for an alternative mode to prevent the 
problems arising from the others. Human beings are the well-developed and advanced 
creatures in the world looking for a healthy and wealthy life. But unfortunately there are 
lots of enemies which threaten human health. Common enemies include wild animals 
and micro organisms such as bacteria and viruses. There is a continuing need to find 
mechanisms to protect man from his enemies and methods to cure the diseases caused 
by others. 
One group of organisms which threatens human health includes venomous and 
poisonous animals. They affect their enemies in various ways causing death or 
impairing organ and tissue functions. The word 'venom' usually represents the toxic 
substance produced by a plant or animal in a highly developed secretory organ or 
tissues which is delivered during the act of biting or stinging. The animals which secrete 
venom are called 'venomous animals' and have specialised venom glands, venom ducts 
and structures to deliver the venom (Russell, 1983). Common examples of venomous 
animals include snakes, scorpions, etc. 
The word 'poison' represents substances, which in small amounts cause death or 
seriously impair the functions of organs or tissues. Poisonous animals are generally 
regarded to be those creatures whose tissues, either in part or entirely, are toxic. 
Poisoning may take place through the ingestion of their flesh (Russell, 1983). Common 
examples of poisonous animals include certain puffer fishes, toads and newts. All 
venomous animals are poisonous but not all poisonous animals are considered to be 
venomous (Russell, 1983). 
1.1 Venomous and poisonous animals 
Venomous and poisonous animals are widely distributed in the animal kingdom from 
the unicellular protistan Gonyaulax, which is responsible for paralytic shellfish 
poisoning, to chordate-mammals such as the short tailed shrew (Russell, 1983). 
Although the exact numbers of such animals are not known, more than 1000 species of 
marine animals, 2500 to 3000 species of snakes and several tens of thousands of 
terrestrial arthropods such as spiders are known to be venomous or poisonous (Russell, 
1965). The number of venomous scorpions, bees, wasps, hornets, ants, ticks and some 
species of bugs is not known. 
1.1.1 Venomous and poisonous marine invertebrates 
The venomous marine invertebrates include the coelenterates, molluscs, sponges, 
annelids and echinodenns (Minton, 1974). 
1.1.1.1 Coelenterates 
The coelenterates are polymorphic aquatic animals which lack organs but possess 
tentacles and a highly developed venom apparatus for the capture of prey and defence. 
There are three major groups of coelenterates, namely the hydrozoa or hydroids, 
scyphozoa or jellyfish and the anthozoa which includes sea anemones and corals 
(Minton, 1974). The venom apparatus of coelenterates consists of a complex organ 
called a nematocyst, which largely consists of tentacles. The nematocyst consists of a 
venom filled capsule and a hollow tube with spines. Discharge of the nematocyst 
depends upon external chemical or mechanical stimuli. On discharge, the tube is 
violently ejected and penetrates the tissues of the prey using the spines. At the same 
time the venom is discharged through its lumen (Minton, 1974). 
Nematocyst venom contains toxic peptides, dopamine (Carlberg et aI., 1993), 
phospholipase A & B, proteolytic enzymes and neutral lipids (Stillway et al., 1971). 
Human envenomation by coelenterates lS wI"desp d th " rea In e manne environment, 
causing mainly paralysis and haemolysis (Witt1e et al., 1971). The envenomation 
 induces acute (Letot et al., 1990) and delayed inflammatory reactions in the skin by 
causing destruction of keratinocytes (in hair follicles) and swelling of their cytoplasm 
(Reed et al., 1984). Important venomous coelenterates include jelly fish (Aurelia sp), 
Portuguese-man-of-war (Physalia physalis), Australian jelly fish (Chironex sp), fire 
coral (Millipora sp), sea anemones (Anemonia sulcata), etc. 
1.1.1.2 Molluscs 
Among the thousands of species of shelled molluscs, a few are known to be venomous. 
The molluscs are tropical and subtropical in distribution and inhabitat shallow water 
from the tidal zone. The venom apparatus protrudes from the anterior portion of the 
shell along with the tentacles and siphon. The venom injection is accomplished by the 
hollow chitinous teeth, which lie in a sheath at the base of the pharynx (Minton, 1974). 
The venom of molluscs contains glycoproteins, indolyl derivatives (Endean et al., 
1967), chitin granules (Martin et al., 2007) and protease enzymes (Marsh, 1970). The 
symptoms of envenomation caused by molluscs are slurred speech, faintness and 
muscular weakness leading to paralysis (Haddad et al., 2006). The important venomous 
molluscs include cone shells (Conus sp) (Haddad et al., 2006) and octopus, particularly 
blue ringed octopus (Hapalochlaena sp) (Williamson, 1987). 
1.1.1.3 Sponges 
Sponges are considered to be the most primitive multi cellular poisonous animals as 
they lack developed organs or well-differentiated tissues. Most of them live in a marine 
environment and a few inhabit fresh water (Minton, 1974). Sponge extracts are toxic to 
many animals and they mostly affect fingers, causing stiffness, redness with pain, which 
may persist for four months and severe itching dermatitis with minimal or no local 
lesions lasting for two weeks (Rual, 1999; Kizer, 1983). hnportant venomous sponges 
include Microciono prolifera, Tedania ignis, Fibula nolitangere, etc. (Minton, 1974). 
1.1.1.4 Annelids 
Annelids are numerous in the sea, inhabiting many niches and playing an important role 
in marine ecosystems. They have spines filled with venomous fluid of unknown 
composition (Minton, 1974). The envenomation caused by these spines produces 
intensive burning, stinging pain, swelling, and erythema followed by numbness and 
itching that may last up to a few weeks (Smith, 2002). Important venomous annelids 
include bristleworms such as Eurythoe sp, Hermodice sp, fireworms such as Chloeia sp, 
bloodworms such as Glycera sp and clamworms Nereis sp (Smith, 2002). 
1.1.1.5 Echinoderms 
All the venomous echinoderms belong to the group of sea urchins. They have two types 
of venom apparatus: spines, which have only a defensive function and pedicellariae or 
tube feet, which serve both to immobilize the prey and as defence (Minton, 1974). The 
spines have a non-toxic fluid but the pedicellariae have a venom gland in each base of 
their tricuspid structures. A duct conveys the venom to the hooked and hollow tip of 
each valve or jaw. The jaws can inject the venom into foreign bodies when they adhere 
to the surface. The toxins isolated from the pedecillariae include protein toxins 
(Alender, 1965) and a dialyzable substance with acetylcholine activity (Mendes et aI., 
1963). These toxins are powerful blocking agents of neurotransmission (Parnas et al., 
1967) and release histamines from tissues (Feigen, 1966). Other biologically active 
substances isolated from echinodenns are saponins, glycolipids, carotenoids, porphyrins 
and naphthoquinones (Yokota, 2005) and they are involved in various envenomation 
activities in the host animals. The spine envenomation causes severe pain at the injury 
site and the pedecillariae result in giddiness, weakness of the limbs, paralysis of the lips, 
tongue, and eyelids and difficulty in breathing (Fujiwara, 1935). Important venomous 
species include Chinus sp, Tripneustes sp and Toxopneustes sp.

1.1.2 Venomous arachnids and myriapods 
The venomous arachnids and myriapods include scorpions, spiders, centipedes, 
millipedes and ticks. 
1.1.2.1 Scorpions 
Scorpions are mostly terrestrial and the primitive ones are aquatic. They nonnally grasp 
the prey with their pincers and immobilize it. Then they tear and crush the prey with 
their mouthparts. They ingest the juices and eject the solid parts as small pellets 
(Stahnke, 1966). The tail of the scorpion consists of six abdominal segments with the 
terminal one carrying the venom apparatus. This segment consists of a pair of venom 
glands, each enclosed in a muscular envelope (Minton, 1974). The venom of the 
scorpion contains a group of low molecular weight neurotoxic proteins with a high 
content of sulphur containing and basic amino acids (Miranda et al., 1964). The 
envenomation of scorpions causes irritability, salivation, gasping, laboured respiration, 
convulsions, neurological, cardio-pulmonary effects and haemotoxic effects (Ranu 
Alpay et al., 2008). The most important venomous species of scorpions belongs to the 
genus of Centruroides, Leiurus, Buthacus, Tityus, and Scorpio (Nicholson et al., 2006). 
1.1.2.2 Spiders 
Spiders are the most important venomous animals for many animals including human 
beings. The spider venom apparatus is associated with the chelicerae (first pair of 
appendages of the head). Most of the active compounds of spider venom are proteins or 
peptides such as serine proteases (Devaraja et al., 2008), cysteine-rich peptides 
(Villegas et al., 2008), ion channel-blocking peptide toxins (Billen et al., 2008), etc. The 
envenomation causes lytic action on the muscles of heart (Sari et al., 2008) and kidneys 
(Abdulkader et al., 2008), fatty tissues and haemocytes. Some highly venomous spiders 
are black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans), brown recluse spider (Loxosceles 
reclusa), small pallid spider (Chiracanthium mildei) and golden garden spider (Argiope 
aurantia) (Currie, 2008) . 
.. 1.1.2.3 Centipedes 
Centipedes are elongate, many segmented arthropods with one pair of legs to each 
typical body segment. The cylindrical venom glands are situated at the bases of the 
fangs. Centipedes uses their venom to kill prey and for defence. The venom of 
centipedes has been shown to contain metalloproteases and phospholipases (Malta et al., 
2008). The envenomation causes serious respiratory paralysis leading to death, burning 
pain, paresthesia and edema, which may develop into superficial necrosis (Malta et al., 
2008). The most venomous species of centipedes are Geophilus sp, Otostigmus pradoi, 
Cryptops iheringi (Malta et al., 2008) and Scolopendra viridicornis (Rates et al., 2007). 
1.1.2.4 Millipedes 
Millipedes differ from centipedes in having two pairs of legs in each typical body 
segment and in lacking structures for venom injection (Minton, 1974). Thus they could 
be classified as poisonous rather than venomous. Millipedes do not bite but many 
species have toxic substances such as pyrrolizidine oximes (alkaloid) that exude on to 
the body surface and thus they cause reddening (Burtt, 1947), dennatitis (Halstead, 
1949), irritation of the mucous membrane and nausea. One common example of 
millipedes is Aphe/oria corrogata, which produces hydrogen cyanide (Eisner, 1966). 
1.1.2.S Ticks 
Ticks are ectoparasites living on terrestrial vertebrates. There are two different types of 
ticks: hard ticks (Ixodid} and soft ticks (Argasid). The hard ticks remain attached to the 
host body and suck blood throughout most of their life cycle while the soft ticks live 
mostly in the host's nest and suck blood when they need. The biting and blood sucking 
apparatus consist of a hypodermic tooth and two hooked chelicerae (Minton, 1974). 
Ticks inject their salivary secretions while they suck the host blood. The envenomation 
of ticks mainly causes swelling, ulceration, fever and leading to paralysis (Buczek et al., 
2000). Paralytic and anticoagulant toxins (Motoyashiki et aI., 2003) have been found in 
several ticks' saliva. In addition to envenomation, ticks are vectors for several medically 
important diseases. Some of the examples of venomous ticks are Ixodes holocyc/us, 
 Dermacentor sp, Ornithodorus sp, etc (Minton, 1974). 
1.1.3 Venomous insects 
Insects inhabit terrestrial and fresh water environments, and are not found in marine 
environments. The venom of insects is involved both in capturing of prey and defensive 
functions. Envenomation usually causes serious illness and endangennent to life. 
Insects are highly mobile and have wings except for a few that are primitive or parasitic. 
The most important venomous insects belong to the following families: Hymenoptera 
(bees, wasps and ants), Lepidoptera (caterpillars and moths), Hemiptera (bugs) and 
Coleoptera (beetles). 
1.1.3.1 Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and ants) 
This family of insects lives together in groups and thus they attack their enemies as a 
group when they disturbed by others. Honey bees (A pis melli/era), paper wasps 
(Polistes sp) and army ants (Eciton sp) are some of the common examples of this 
family. These insects have a powerful venom which is discharged by their stings. The 
venom apparatus is present in the terminal portion of the abdomen. Members of this 
family have acid venom glands to secrete granules of lipids, carbohydrates and traces of 
proteins (Kanwar et al., 1971) and alkaline venom glands to secrete low molecular 
weight pharmacologically active compounds such as serotonin, histamine, acetyl 
choline, etc (Rosenbrook et al., 1964). The secretions of the venom glands are emptied 
into the venom reservoir whose duct delivers venom into the stings which in turn 
discharges into the host. The insects' envenomation mainly causes allergic reactions in 
many victims. Most of the venom substances present in insect venoms is non-antigenic 
and thus it is not possible to produce effective anti-venom for insects' envenomation. 
Until 1960, the research on the members of this family was done using extracts of 
whole insects or venom glands. But since 1960, the researchers have started collecting 
the venom of insects in large farms by electrically shocking the insects' abdominal 
cavities. 
The composition of honey bee venom is 88% water with the remainder consisting of 
 solid particles. The solid particles contain proteins, peptides, lipids and carbohydrates. 
One major polypeptide present in this venom is melitin which contains 26 amino acids. 
It occurs in the form of micelles of 4 molecules and it strongly reduces the surface 
tension as do detergents (Raghuraman et al., 2007). Apamin is the second major 
polypeptide containing 10 amino acids. It is rich in cystine residues and contains 2 
disulfide linkages. Apamin completely lacks aromatic amino acids. The major enzymes 
in honey bee venom are phospholipase A and B and hyaluronidase (Habermann et al., 
1965). The pharmacologically active substances present in honey bee venom are 
histamine, dopamine and noradrenalin (Habermann, 1972). Melitin acts by reducing 
blood pressure, damaging the motor end plates of nerves, reducing the membrane 
potential of striated muscles, haemolysis and releasing serotonin from platelets 
(Raghuraman et al., 2007). Apamin is a neurotoxin mainly affecting the spinal cord and 
causes prolonged hyper excitability (Minton, 1974). 
The venom of wasps contains wasp kinin which is a pharmacologically active 
polypeptide with properties similar to bradykinin. This venom contains higher amounts 
of hyaluronidase than honey bee venom. Serotonin, acetylcholine, histamine, adrenalin, 
noradrenalin and dopamine are the pharmacologically active compounds reported in the 
venom of all wasps except the mud douber (Sceliphron caementarium) wasp. Instead 
mud douber wasps have low molecular weight compounds such as free amino acids and 
lecithin together with a number of unidentified compounds (Minton, 1974). The 
envenomation causes dyspnea (shortness of breath), diarrhoea, akinesia Ooss of muscle 
action) and paralysis (Sharmila et al., 2007). Pulmonary congestion and bronchial 
musculature are caused by vasoactive substances in this venom. The kinin stimulates the 
action of residual smooth muscle. Degranulation of mast cells and haemolysis were also 
reported from this venom. This venom does not have any effects on nerve conductance 
(Edery et al., 1972). Most of the severe activities of this venom are caused by non-
antigenic toxins and thus anti-serum produced against this venom shows only a weak 
protective action (Steen et al., 2005). 
The venoms of most primitive ants such as Myrmecines sp, Ponerines sp, 
Pseudomyrmecines sp and Dorylines sp are similar to bee and wasp venom. The venom 
of red bull ant (Myrmecia gulosa) and army ants (Eciton sp) contain a heat labile 
protein, hyaluronidase, a substance with kinin like activity and histamine (Cavill et aI., 
1964). Fire ants are completely different from stinging arthropods in that their venom 
contains no protein but does contain alkaloids. The red fire ant (Solenopsis saevissima) 
venom contains 5 alkaloids, 2 trans-2-methyl-6-alkylpiperidines and 2 unsaturated 
analogues of alkaloids (MacConnell et aI., 1971). This venom is also unique in having 
alkaloids in trans form rather than in cis configuration. The venom of a common desert 
ant (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) causes piloerection (erection of hairs in skin), sweating, 
respiratory distress and terminal conwlsions (Rupp et aI., 2006). The venom of the fire 
ant shows insecticidal activity against Drosophila and other species of insects and mites 
(Blum et al., 1958). The action of this venom on arthropods causes paralysis. The 
insecticidal properties of fire ant venom are mainly caused by the trans configured 
alkaloids. Ant venom also shows anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities (Orivel et al., 
2001). 
1.1.3.2 Lepidoptera (caterpillars and moths) 
The envenomation caused by this family of insects, which includes caterpillars and 
moths, is less serious. The envenomation is mostly caused by contact with caterpillars 
and less frequently with the cocoon and adult stages. The venom apparatus contain 
spines and glands. Spines are present on the dorsal surface of insects to deliver the 
venom and they are connected to cup shaped venom glands at the bottom (Minton, 
1974). The venom is expelled into the lumen of the spines from the glands by capillary 
action. As it is very difficult to get venom from caterpillars, there is little research on 
this venom. The venom seems to contain peptides, histamine, serotonin and 
hyaluronidase (Minton, I 974). The envenomation causes symptoms such as violent 
pain, convulsions, oedema, faIl in blood pressure, fibrinolytic activity, dermatitis, etc 
(Carrijo-Carvalho et al., 2007). Examples of venomous members of this family are 
saddleback caterpillar (Sibine stimulea), tree asp (Euclea de/phinii), 10 moth (Automeris 
io), brown tail moth (Nygmia phaerrhoea), hawk moths (Acanthosphinx guesseldtii), 
lonomia caterpillar (Lonomia oblique) and south American caterpillar (Megalopyge 
 urens) (Diaz, 2005). 
1.1.3.3 Hemiptera (bugs) 
Bugs bite either to capture prey or for defence e.g. against man. These insects have two 
pairs of salivary glands: the main larger glands situated in the mesothorax and small 
accessory glands situated at the posterior region. The venom secretions by these glands 
are ejected into the tubule formed by the connection of the maxillae and mandible, and 
their distal tips are modified to form piercing lancets. When they bite they inject their 
salivary secretions and simultaneously suck the blood and liquefied tissues of their prey. 
Bug venom contains endopeptidase, hyaluronidase, phospholipase, gelatinase, etc. 
(Minton, 1974). The envenomation of bugs causes severe allergic reactions, impairment 
of cardiac contractions, effects on neural conductance and lysis of cuticular and 
collagenous structures. This causes symptoms such as convulsions, haemorrhage, 
respiratory paralysis, local pain, swelling, reddening, necrosis and irritation in eyes and 
skin (Bircher, 2005). Some of the common examples of venomous terrestrial bugs are 
Platymeris rhadamanthus (reduviid bug), Rhinoceros carmelita (assasian bug), 
Naucoris cimicoides (water bug) and Arilus cristatus (water bug). Some of the aquatic 
bugs are Notonectide sp (black swimmers), Nepidae sp (water scorpions) and 
Belostomatidae sp (giant water bugs). 
1.1.3.4 Coeloptera (beetles) 
Beetles are the largest group of insect species identified. They use their large mandibles 
to bite their prey in order to immobilize or kill them. Venomous actions have not been 
reported in humans. A toxin called cantharidin was found in the haemolymph and 
tissues of certain beetles (Tagwireyi et al., 2000). This toxin causes irritation to the skin, 
urinary and gastrointestinal tracts upon contact. Contact with beetles also causes the 
formation of blisters which are painless unless broken or rubbed (Bircher, 2005). 
Common examples of beetles which could cause blisters include Epicauta cinerea, 
Paederus sp (small rove beetles), Tenebrionidae sp (darkling ground beetles), Blap 
nitens and Anisomorpha buprestoides (seven day rider). 
1.1.4 Venomous fish 
Fish are the most numerous vertebrates living mostly in aquatic environments (both in 
fresh and sea water). There are two different types of fish: osteichthyes or bony fish and 
chondrichthyes or cartilaginous fish. About 9 families of cartilaginous and 17 families 
of bony fish have been reported to be venomous (Minton, 1974). The venom apparatus 
offish is usually associated with spines on various parts of the body, usually the dorsal 
fin, tail and operculum or in the pectoral region. The main function of the venom 
apparatus is for defence (Minton, 1974). 
1.1.4.1 Cartilaginous fISh (stingrays, sharks and chimeras) 
The skeletons of these fish are made up of soft and rubbery cartilages which are more 
flexible and lighter than bones. Stingrays are a major group of cartilaginous venomous 
fish. They are flattened and circular, and they have extremely long tails with venomous 
spines in the middle. Stingrays are found throughout the world mostly in tropical and 
warm coastal regions, and some inhabit :fresh water and estuaries. They feed on 
molluscs, worms and other small invertebrates. The sting of the rays contains a spine 
with sharp edges and a ventrolateral groove containg venom secreting epithelial cells. 
The sting is covered with a sheath which also contains venom secreting epithelial cells. 
During the envenomation, the spine is inserted deeply into the host and when it pulls 
out, the sheath along with the venom secreting epithelial tissues is fully or partly tom 
out and deposited in the wound of the host. This is how they cause severe injury 
(Minton, 1974). 
The venom extracts of stingrays contain serotonin, 5-nucleotidase, phosphodiesterase, 
hyaluronidase and some other unknown lethal fractions (Magalhaes et al., 2008). The 
envenomation causes severe pain, fainting, salivation, vomiting, urination and 
defecation. It shows no effect on neuromuscular transmission. The systemic absorption 
of venom also causes diarrhoea, muscle cramps, dyspnea, cardiac arrest and convulsion. 
The injury caused by the spines is highly susceptible to bacterial infection. Severe and 
deep punctures in thoraxic or abdominal cavities by stingrays can be fatal and thus 
surgical operation is required to carefully remove the pieces of sheath and venom-
fI containg tissues of stingrays (Diaz et al., 2007). Some of the common venomous 
examples of stingrays are California round stingrays (Urolophus hallen), giant stingrays 
(Dasyatis brevicaudata), Potamotrygon motoro and Himantura schmardae (Minton, 
1974). 
A few species of sharks including spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) (Haddad et al., 
2005) and 3 species of chimeras or rat fish have been reported as venomous fishes. The 
venom apparatus is much like stingrays but contains a smaller amount of venom 
producing tissues. The stings are less painful than stingrays (Minton, 1974) and the 
chemistry, pathology, and pharmacology of this envenomation are poorly known. 
1.1.4.2 Bony fishes 
The vast majority of fish are osteichthyes or bony fish. Osteichthyes consist of over 
29,000 species, making them the largest class of vertebrates in existence today. The 
venom apparatus of bony fish consists of spines with associated unicellular glands, 
which are usually attached to fins. The rupture of the unicellular glands releases the 
venom in the grooves of the spines which is injected into the host during penetration 
(Minton, 1974). 
1.1.4.2.1 Scorpion fish 
The family of scorpaenidae includes the most dangerous venomous fish in the world. 
Mostly they live in temperate and subtropical seas, though a few inhabitat fresh water 
regions. Most of the dangerous species occur around coral reefs and kelp beds. They 
feed on other fishes and invertebrates (Minton, 1974). 
Venom producing tissues are present in dorsal, anal and pelvic spines. Spines are 
associated with venom glands and the entire structure is covered by integwnentary 
sheath. Usually these fish sting when touched, stepped upon or otherwise restrained. 
The venom contains both toxic and non toxic proteins which are not well characterised . 
., The envenomation causes reduction of blood pressure, increase in respiration, cardiac 
arrest, muscular weakness, convulsions, paralysis of smooth, striated and cardiac 
muscles (Haw good, 2006). Death is mainly caused by direct action on the heart and 
diaphragm by deep thoracic puncture by spines. Common examples of venomous fish in 
this family include lime fish (Pterois antennata), lion fish (Pterois volitans) (Vetrano et 
al., 2002), scorpion fish (Scorpaenopsis sp), stone fish (Synanceja sp) and bullrout 
(Notesthes robusta) (Minton, 1974). 
1.1.4.2.2 Weever fish 
Weever fish are a small group of venomous fish. They live in coastal regions with 
shallow water and mud. They are commercially important in some parts of Europe. The 
venom apparatus is associated with dorsal and opercular spines consisting of deeply 
grooved spines containing elongated venom glands and an integumentary sheath 
(Minton, I 974). The venom contains proteins such as cholinesterase, adrenalin, 
noradrenalin, histamine, and serotonin (Davies et al., 1996). Envenomation causes 
reduction of blood pressure, myocardial ischemia, convulsions, vasoconstriction, severe 
pain, sweating, fainting, disorientation, dyspnea, cyanosis, local pain and cardiac 
arrhythmia (Halpern et al., 2002). Common examples of venomous weever fish are 
lesser weever (Trachinus vipera), greater weever (Trachinus draco), etc. (Halpern et al., 
2002). 
1.1.4.2.3 Catfish 
Catfish are a large group with more than a thousand species mostly inhabitating tropical 
and sub tropical streams. The venom apparatus is similar to other bony fish consisting 
of pectoral and dorsal spines with glandular tissues and the spines are covered with 
integumentary sheath (Satora et al., 2008). During external disturbance, the spines 
extend and penetrate into the host body. The chemistry of venom of catfish is not well 
understood but the venom is reported to have a dialyzable toxin (Minton, 1974). The 
envenomation causes respiratory distress, erythema, necrosis, pain, swelling and 
blisters. The wounds caused by catfish are susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections 
.. (Haddad et al., 2006). Common examples of venomous catfish are Clarias gariepinus 
(African catfish) (Satora et al., 2008), Cathorops spixii (Junqueira et al., 2007), 
HeteropneustesJossilis, Plotosus can ius (Indian catfish) (Auddyet al., 1994), etc. 
1.1.4.2.4 Toadfish 
Toadfish resemble scorpion and stone fish and are mainly found in the sea and esturies 
with a few found in fresh water rivers. The venom apparatus consists of dorsal and 
opercular spines with hollow spaces inside which end with a large opening at the base 
and a small opening at the tip. There are no ducts but the venom is squeezed into the 
hollow space from the gland when the spine penetrates into the tissues and is injected by 
the distal opening at the tip of the spines (Minton, 1974). The chemistry of toadfish 
venom is not well understood but reported to be acidic, clear and albuminous. The 
envenomation causes necrosis and paralysis (Haddad et al., 2003). However, 
envenomation by these fish is infrequent and severe cases have not been reported. 
.. Common examples of venomous toadfish are Thalassophryne maculosa (gunter) and 
Thalassophryne nattereri (niquim). 
1.1.5 Venomous (poisonous) amphibians 
Contemporary amphibians belong to three orders: frogs and toads, the salamanders and 
wonn like caecilians. The frogs and toads and salamanders are entirely distributed in the 
Northern hemisphere and wonn like caecilians found in tropical regions. Amphibians 
are restricted to freshwater and terrestrial environments. Amphibians do not have 
specialised venom apparatus such as spines, teeth or other structures to inject the venom 
into the host tissues, but they secrete toxin substances which are released on the surface 
of skins for defensive purposes when they are injured or threatened (Minton, 1974). 
Toad toxins are produced by parotid glands of the head and shoulder regions. They 
contain cardiotoxic steroids namely bufogenins and bufotoxins, dopamine, epinephrine 
and serotonin. Peptides with cytotoxic, severe oculotoxic and antibiotic activity are also 
found in toad secretions (Keomany et al., 2007). An example of a toxic toad is the fire 
bellied toad (Bufo melanostictus Schneider) (Keomanyet al., 2007). 
Frog skin secretions contain extremely toxic steroidal alkaloids, for example 
batrachotoxin is an extremely active cardio and neurotoxin from the Colombian arrow 
poison frog Phyllobates aurotaenia (Dalyet al., 1971). The envenomation of frog toxins 
causes dyspnea, convulsions and loss of equilibrium (Daly et al., 1971). Two examples 
oftoxic frogs are Phyllobates aurotaenia and Dendrobates pumilio (Minton, 1974). 
A well studied salamander is the European fire salamander (Salamandra maculosa). 
The skin secretion is a milky, viscid liquid. A principal toxin identified in salamander is 
the alkaloid salamandarine (Minton, 1974). A powerful neurotoxin was isolated from 
the eggs of California newts (Taricha sp). Contact with these skin secretions causes 
irritation of the skin, sneezing and watering of the eyes (Minton, 1974). 
1.1.6 Venomous reptiles 
1.1.6.1 Venomous lizards 
The lizards are the most abundant species of reptiles with over 3000 species. Only 2 
species of the helodermatidae family have been reported as venomous. They are the gila 
monster (Heloderma suspectum) and the Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum) 
(Fry et al., 2006). The gila monster lives in deserts and the Mexican beaded lizard 
inhabits fairly dense forests. The venom is mainly used for defence. The venom 
apparatus of lizards consists of deeply grooved teeth in the lower jaw with a duct 
leading to the venom glands. There are 3 or 4 lobes of venom glandular tissues each 
with an excretory duct to deliver the secretions (Fry et al., 2006). The venom contains 
mixtures of enzymes such as hyaluronidase, L-amino acid oxidase, phospholipase, 
fibrinolysin, phosphodiesterase, protease, kinin releasing arginine esterase (Fry et al., 
2006), serotonin and at least one low molecular weight non enzymatic toxin (Styblova 
et al., 1967). Envenomation causes swelling, local pain, salivation, vomiting, muscular 
weakness, increased urination and defecation. It also affects respiration and induces 
haemorrhages in many parts of the body (Cantrell, 2003). 
1.1.6.2 Venomous snakes 
In many areas worldwide snakes pose a major threat to mankind. There is a number of 
different kinds of snakes with both venomous and non-venomous activity. Among the 
venomous snakes each family has a different mode of action to attack its enemies and 
prey. Snakes have a well-established venomous gland and venom system for their own 
protection and to capture prey. Throughout the course of history, venomous snakes have 
represented a unique and particular fascination for humans (Bailey et aI., 2001). As 
snakes are the main focus of this thesis, they will be discussed in detail in section 1.2. 
1.1.7 Venomous mammals 
The platypus (Omithorhynchus anatinus) and a few species of echidnas in the 
monotremata family have been reported as venomous mammals. 
The platypus inhabits semi aquatic regions, where it digs long burrows to capture prey. 
Only the male platypuses are venomous. The venom apparatus consists of a movable 
horny spur situated in the middle of each hind limb and venom glands. The venom is 
secreted in glands and conveyed to the base of spur through ducts (Minton, 1974). The 
crude venom of the Australian male platypus contains approximately 50 peptides such 
as C-type natriuretic peptide and defensin-Iike peptides. These peptides mainly contain 
D-amino acids at either the amino or carboxy terminus (Jacobsen et aI., 1999). The 
envenomation causes haemorrhages, oedema, faintness, fever, severe pain at the bite 
site, peripheral vasodilation followed by hypotension, very weak coagulant and 
haemolytic activities (De Plater et aI., 1995). The recently sequenced complete genome 
analysis of the platypus Omithorhynchus anatinus, showed that these animals exhibit a 
fascinating combination of reptilian and mammalian characters and also the venomous 
system of the platypus is similar to that of reptiles (Warren et aI., 2008). 
The echidnas (insectivores) have spur, venom glands and ducts similar to that of 
platypus. Well known examples of this group include the short tailed shrew (Blarina 
brevi cauda) and the European water shrew (Neomys fodiens). The venom of these 
mammals is produced by submaxillary glands and delivered to lower incisors through 
ducts (Dufton, 1992). The main function of the venom is to immobilise the prey. Shrew 
venoms are rich in proteins including a serine protease, blarinasin (Kita et aI., 2005). 
Envenomation causes hypotension, burning pain, oedema and convulsions. Some other 
examples of venomous mammals include slow loris (Nycticebus coucang), larger 
insectivore (Solenodon paradoxus) and Atopoga/e cuban us (Dufton, 1992). 
1.2 Snakes 
1.2.1 Reptiles 
Snakes belong to the class of reptiles in the vertebrate lineage, which evolved from 
amphibians which in turn evolved from pisces. There are approximately 6000 living 
species of reptiles, divided into four orders: chelonia, crocodilia, rhynchocephalia and 
squamata (figure 1.1). The four orders of reptiles are distinguishable from other 
vertebrates by having an amniotic egg and by lacking both feather and hair (Russell, 
1983). The order chelonia includes turtles and tortoises; crocodilia includes crocodiles; 
rhynocephalia includes tuatara and squamata includes snakes and lizards. Most reptiles 
live in tropical or subtropical regions. Their numbers decrease toward the poles and they 
are rarely found at high altitudes. Snakes differ from lizards in some aspects. Snakes 
have no movable eyelids and legs but lizards do, and snakes have more flexible jaws, 
which permit them to swallow larger prey whole, while lizards have a fairly firm lower 
jaw and bite their food. The brain of a snake is situated in a bony case but is open 
anteriorly to each side in lizards (Russell, 1983). Snakes are more numerous in humid 
regions, while lizards are more common in arid regions. 
1.2.2 Phylogeny of snakes 
According to Russell (1983) the first reptiles appeared near the end of the palaeozoic 
era, approximately 300 million years ago. Their kind and numbers increased during the 
triassic period (230-180 million years ago), and they became a dominant form of 
terrestrial vertebrate. At the beginning of the mesozoic era, 16 orders were present. 
However by the end of the mesozoic era i.e. the late cretaceous period, at least half of 
the reptilian orders had become extinct for reasons that are not understood. Of the four 
surviving orders, only the squamata (lizards and snakes) seem to have increased in kind 
during the tertiary era. Some snakes seem to be actively evolving and undergoing 
adaptive radiation even today. 
Orders 
Figure 1.1 Classification of reptiles (information adapted from Peter, 1996). Only 
the families of snakes are included in this classification. 
1.2.3 Thermo system of snakes 
Snakes are poikilothermic or ectothermic (cold blooded) vertebrates. They lack a 
physiological system to maintain their body temperature in response to changes in their 
environment. Their metabolic rate is lower than that of mammals and they produce less 
body heat but lose more heat. Snakes have no compensative mechanism like shivering 
for heat conservation or sweating for rapid heat exchange. However they adapt 
themselves by behavioural means to ensure that their body temperature remains in the 
optimal range. When it is hot they seek a protected habitat like a burrow, water or 
branches of a shady tree. In cold weather they may seek direct sun rays or warm rocks 
or roads (Russell, 1983). 
1.2.4 Families of snakes 
There are two different types of snakes; the venomous and non-venomous snakes. 
Venomous snakes can secrete venom and cause lethal effects to capture their prey and 
for defence. Non-venomous snakes do not secrete venom, but they capture their prey in 
various ways such as crushing, chewing, constriction, swallowing live prey etc. These 
snakes use defensive mechanisms such as acting aggressively and mimicking the 
venomous snakes in an attempt to threaten their enemies. Snakes are divided into four 
families: colubridae, elapidae, hydrophidae and viperidae (Russell, 1983). The viperidae 
family is subdivided into three subfamilies namely viperinae, crotalinae and azemiops 
(peter, 1996). The term colubrids is applied to snakes of the colubridae family, elapids 
to the elapidae family, hydrophids to the hydrophidae family, viperids to the viperinae 
subfamily and crotalids to the crotalinae subfamily (Russell, 1983). 
1.2.4.1 Elapidae 
The elapids constitute one family of venomous snakes found in tropical and subtropical 
regions of the world. They range in size from 18cm (Drysdalia sp) to 6m (Ophiophagus 
sp). They have long slender bodies full of smooth scales and most are oviparous with a 
few being viviparous. They are carnivorous animals feeding on small snakes, frogs, 
lizards, small mammals, fish etc. Elapids have a pair of long fixed fangs which cannot 
fold in the mouth when not in use. The fangs can penetrate deeply and cause 
envenomation. Some snakes like Naja nigrico/lius (figure 1.2A) can spray venom 
through their fangs when facing enemies or prey. One of the most poisonous elapid 
snakes is the black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) (figure 1.28).

Dendroaspis po/y/epis 
(from 
The venom of elapid snakes is considered to be a potent neurotoxin, attacking mainly 
the nervous system of prey and victims. The venom of elapids is rich in proteins and 
polypeptide toxins. Envenomation mainJy causes profound neurological abnormalities 
such as cranial nerve dysfunction, abnormal mental status, muscle weakness, paralysis, 
respiratory arrest, necrosis, severe local burning pain, soft tissue swelling, salivation, 
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, respiratory failure, chest pain, 
eye pain, tearing, blurred vision (with eye exposure to venom from spitting cobras 
leading to blindness or impairment of vision), hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia 
and blistering (Norris, 2007). Acute inflammation of the eye follows from exposure to 
venom spat by the snake and is characterized by ocular congestion, oedema of the 
conjunctiva and cornea, and a whitish discharge from eyes (Russell, 1983). 
1.2.4.2 Colubridae 
Unlike other snakes, the colubrid snakes are fully covered by their body scales. Most 
are non venomous but the Boiga sp, the booms lang (Dispholidus typus) (figure].3) and 
African twig snake (Thelotornis capensis oatesii) are highly venomous and could cause 
fatalities in humans. Colubrid snakes generally live in trees. They feed on small 
mammals, birds, lizards, etc. Unlike the vipers and elapids, colubrid snakes have long 
fangs at the rear of their mouth. Thus, the bites are severe and deeper as the entire 
mouth along with the fangs is involved in the bite. The venom of the boomslang is 
primarily a haemotoxin, and the envenomation could disable the blood clotting process 
of the victim causing death as a result of internal and external bleeding (Kamiguti et aI. , 
2000). Other symptoms which develop after envenomation are headache, nausea, 
sleepiness and mental disorders. As the venom is slow acting, the severity of the 
envenomation may not be realised in time to prevent death.

1.2.4.3 Hydrophidae 
This family consists of sea snakes which inhabit the shallow and muddy coastal regions 
of several seas, predominantly tropical and sUbtropical waters in the western Pacific and 
Indian oceans. Sea snakes are the most abundant and widely distributed group of 
poisonous reptiles living in aquatic environments. These snakes are characterized by 
vertically flattened tails and nostrils with valve-like flaps. Sea snakes have scales but 
lack gills or fins. Even though they spend much of their time underwater, they must 
come to the surface periodically to breathe. They grow from I m to 3 m in length 
according to the species. Generally, sea snakes are not aggressive but handling or 
disturbance could result in bites. The venom apparatus of sea snakes consists of 2-4 
short hollow maxillary fangs associated with a pair of venom glands. The venom ducts 
open near the tips of the fangs. The fangs are dislodged easily from their sockets and 
may remain embedded in the skin of victims. Sea snakes are highly venomous and a 
mature adult snake can have enough venom to kill 3 adult humans. The venom is rich in 
neurotoxins and myotoxins (Minton, 1974). A common example of a poisonous sea 
snake is Lapemis hardwickii (figure 1.4). 
Figure 1.4 A poisonous sea snake Lapemis hardwickii. The tail of the snake is 
flattened in order to swim freely in the water. This image was taken from 
www.homes.jcu.edu.au. 
Envenomation causes muscle necrosis, anxiety, drowsiness, headache, ophthalmoplegia 
leading to failing vision, facial and muscle paralysis, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, 
abdominal pain, cramping, hypersalivation, slurred speech, cardiac arrest and fever 
(Foster, 2006). Sea snake venom has little to no effect on blood coagulation. 
1.2.4.4 Viperidae 
There are three subfamilies in viperidae family: viperinae, crotalinae and azemiops. 
Viperinae subfamily members (viperids) are generally known as true vipers and have 
eyes to detect their prey. This subfamily is further subdivided into several genera as 
shown in figure 1.5. In total 128 true vipers belonging to the subfamily of viperinae 
have been identified and they are listed in appendix 1 (peter, 1996). 
Crotalinae subfamily members (crotalids) are generally known as pit vipers. They have 
a pit organ between the eye and nostrils. The pit organ was first described by Tyson 
(1683) (as reported by Russell, 1983), while Desmoulins (1824) (as reported by Russell, 
1983) was perhaps the first who noted the rich innervations of the pit organ and 
emphasized its probable sensory nature. Bullock et al. (1952) defined these facial pits as 
highly specialized receptors of infrared radiation. Crotalids are further subdivided into 
several genera as shown in figure 1.5. In total 286 pit vipers have been identified 
~ worldwide. These are listed in appendix 2 (peter, 1996). 
Azemiops are the most primitive members of the viperidae family (Liem et al., 1971). 
This subfamily currently contains only one snake, the fea viper from Southeast Asia 
(Azemiops foae) (appendix 3). Unlike most other vipers it has colubrid-like head scales, 
smooth body scales and no tracheal lung. Although it does not have pit organs, it seems 
to be closer to crotalids than to the viperids. Knight et al. (1993) and Heise et al. (1995) 
analysed the mitochondrial 12S and 16S ribosomal DNA and confirmed it is a separate 
clade rather than being a member of the crotalinae subfamily.

Figure 1.5 Classification of vipers. The information was taken from Peter (1996). 
Vipers occur in almost all countries. They typically have broad, triangular heads and are 
also heavy-bodied with relatively short, slender tails. Most vipers have numerous and 
heavily keeled body scales. As indicated by their wide distribution, vipers can be found 
in most ecological habitats from tropical rain forests to deserts and even high 
mountains. Crotalids contain arboreal (e.g. Trimeresurus sp), terrestrial (e.g. Crotalus 
sp), and aquatic species. Viperids are usually terrestrial, although some burrow in desert 
sands (e.g. Cerastes sp, Echis sp) or are arboreal (Atheris sp). Vipers are found in 
various sizes from small to large (Bitis schneideri, which grows up to 28cm to Lachesis 
muta, which can be up to 3.6m). They feed on small mammals, birds and other 
vertebrates. Most crotalids are live-bearers i.e. they do not lay eggs, but give birth to 
free-swimming offspring. Among the few exceptions are Cafloselasma sp, some 
Trimeresurus and Lachesis sp which are oviparous. Viperids include both oviparous 
(e.g., Causus sp, Echis coloratus) and ovoviviparous i.e. they develop within eggs that 
remain in the mother's body until they hatch or are about to hatch and are nourished by 
egg yolk (e.g. Bitis sp, Echis carinatus and most of Vipera sp) (Russell, 1983). 
Examples of crotalid and viperid snakes are shown in figure 1.6. 
Figure 1.6 (A) Crotalus adamanteus (eastern diamondback rattle snake), image 
taken from www.bluechameleon.org and (8) Echis carinatus (an Indian saw scaled 
viper), image taken from www.tigr.org. 
The venom apparatus of vipers consists of a pair of venom glands, ducts and fangs. The 
venom glands secrete venom which is conveyed to the fangs through the duct during the 
bite. Vipers have long fangs which help in deep penetration and envenomation of prey. 
There are two different types of fangs found in venomous snakes: fixed fangs which 
cannot move and hinged or erectile fangs which can be erected when needed for biting 
and folded when not in use in the mouth. Vipers have erectile fangs. Each maxilla is 
cuboidal and bears a single enlarged maxillary fang. Several replacement fangs lie 
behind the functional fang. These can replace the functional fang if it is broken or gets 
stuck in the host tissue during the bite. The maxillary fang has a duct on its interior 
space, and the elongated ectopterygoid serves as a lever to erect or depress the fang 
(peter, 1996). The surface of the fang has orifices to deliver the venom. Viper venom is 
rich in hydrolytic enzymes and toxin molecules mainly affecting the circulatory system 
of prey and victims. This is discussed in more detail in section 1.3. 
In this research we focus on vipers. Vipers use their fangs to inject a large quantity 
(approximately 120mg per bite of a mature viper) of venom directly into the blood 
vessels which cause immediate dysfunction of the circulatory system. The viper bites 
cause random blood clotting which either blocks the blood flow to major organs or 
reduces the amount of fibrinogen, leading to continuous bleeding at the bite sites. In 
some cases, the venom causes fibrinolysis, dissolving blood clots, also causing 
continuous bleeding at the bite sites. It also can raise or lower the blood pressure of 
victims. In addition to these systemic effects, the venom causes local effects such as 
severe pain around the bite site, swelling, muscle weakness, erythema, blistering etc. 
1.2.S Treatment of snake bites 
Treatment of any venomous snake bite is a complex process as the bite is associated 
with several clinical manifestations. Snake bites are considered as severe emergency 
cases and must be treated as soon as possible. Physicians mainly try to understand the 
nature of the snake bite and its severity by assessing the bite site (looking at fang marks) 
and clinical manifestations, though not all symptoms develop immediately. Physicians 
may also seek laboratory diagnosis tests but treatment often needs to start before results 
are available (Russell, 1983). 
Primarily, treatment must focus on providing clear air if the patient is in dyspnea and 
intravenous fluid if they are in severe shock. Analgesics are required to reduce the 
burning local pain at the bite site due to the development of oedema. 
The required volumes of polyvalent anti-venom (anti-serum produced by immunising 
animals with non-lethal doses of snake venom) must be administered according to the 
severity of envenomation or the nature of the snake or bite. The anti-venom may cause 
anaphylactic reactions and serum sickness, and thus precautionary medicines (anti-
histamines, anti-serotonin, epinephrine, etc) are administered to prevent or treat such 
reactions (Russell, 1983). Blistering at the bite sites must be monitored as the anti-
venom is being administered. At the bite site, a severe wound may develop after the 
development of blisters. The wounds must be cleaned thoroughly to remove broken 
fangs and venomous particles. Sometimes the affected part must be amputated to 
prevent the spreading of venom effects to other parts of the body. According to the type 
of snake, different toxins could attack several parts of the body: for example cobra bites 
could attack the nervous system, and viper bites could attack the blood system. Thus 
precautionary medicines are taken to prevent the failure of these major organs of the 
body. Patients may also need a tetanus injection and antibiotics to prevent microbial 
infection at the bite site. Mild sedatives are also required when the respiration is normal 
in patients. Blood transfusion may be required in the case of viper bites as they cause 
severe bleeding and coagulation disorders. 
Polyvalent anti-venom is produced by immunising animals such as horse, rabbit, sheep, 
.. etc. using a mixture of the snake venoms which are thought to be venomous in 
particular regions or a country. Thus this is not specific for a particular snake venom 
and not effective in all cases. Further developments to improve the quality of anti-
venom are underway in order to obtain highly specific anti-venoms for effective 
treatments. For example, toxin-specific antibodies against serine proteases, 
phospholipases, etc. are being developed in laboratories (White, 2005). These are likely 
to be more effective than polyvalent anti-venom as not all proteins or other components 
present in the venom are toxic in the host system. DNA antibodies raised against 
epitopes present on the surface of toxins are also being developed (Wagstaff et al., 
2006). Epitopes are identified based on the existing structures of toxins and are 
constructed synthetically as a string of epitopes from several toxins along with suitable 
promoter regions. These strings could be injected using a gene gun and expressed in 
animals in order to raise antibodies. These antibodies are reported to be more effective 
than polyvalent anti-venoms (Wagstaff et al., 2006) . 
1.3 Snake venom toxicities 
Venom is a modified fonn of saliva secreted from the modified salivary glands (venom 
glands) of snakes. Snake venoms are a rich source of pharmacologically active 
compounds with a diverse spectrum of biological activities (Bailey et al., 2001). 
Venoms are usually composed of a complex mixture of hydrolytic enzymes, 
biologically active peptides and inorganic compounds. These components are 
responsible for causing the various toxicities or proteolytic activities in prey and victims 
(Harvey, 2001). 
1.3.1 Venom enzymes 
Snake venoms are said to contain at least 26 enzymes although no single venom 
contains all of these (Minton, 1974). At least 10 enzymes out of26 are found in almost 
all of the snake venoms, while the remainder are scattered throughout the venoms of the 
four families of venomous snakes. For example, the esterase that hydrolyses 
carbonaphthyoxy choline appears in large quantities in elapidae venom (Munjal, 1972), 
while crotalid and viperid venoms lack this enzyme but are rich in endopeptidases. 
Some of the important snake venom enzymes are explained below. 
Hyaluronidase catalyses the cleavage of internal glycosidic bonds of hyaluronic acid 
( acid mucopolysaccharide), which is present in the intercellular space and results in 
decreased viscosity of connective tissues. This breakdown allows other components of 
the venom to penetrate the involved tissues. This enzyme is responsible for oedema 
(Suwansrinon et al., 2007). The enzyme has also been referred to as the "spreading 
factor" (Duran-Reynals, 1936), as it enhances the spreading of other enzymes of the 
venom. 
Phospholipase A2 has been found in the venoms of many species of snakes and appears 
to be widely distributed throughout the venoms of elapids, vipers, crotalids, sea snakes 
and colubrids. It catalyses the hydrolysis of one of the fatty ester linkages in 
diacylphosphatides, forming lysophosphatides, followed by releasing both saturated and 
.. unsaturated fatty acids. Thus it is involved in the digestion of membranes which is 
followed by necrosis and tissue destruction at the bite site. The ability of snake venoms 
to hydrolyse lysophosphatides is expressed as phospholipase B activity. It was first 
described for certain Australian snake venoms by Doery et al. (1961) and subsequently 
by others. Russell (1983) has suggested that the phospholipase B activity is a second 
action of the venom phospholipase A2. 
Phosphomonoesterase (phosphatase) dephosphorylates its substrate by hydrolysing 
phosphoric acid mono esters, releasing a phosphate ion and a product with a free 
hydroxyl group. There are two non-specific phosphomonoesterases, acid and alkaline 
phosphatases and they have optimal pHs 5 and 8.5 respectively. Many types of venom 
contain both acid and alkaline phosphatases while others contain only one. It is widely 
distributed in the venoms of all families of snakes except the colubrids (Russell, 1983). 
Phosphodiesterase is an orthophosphoric diester phosphohydrolase that releases 
acetylcholine esterase, which catalyses the hydrolysis of acetylcholine to choline and 
acetic acid. It was first demonstrated in cobra venom (Iyengar, 1938) (as reported by 
Russell, 1983) and is widely distributed throughout the elapid venoms. It is also found 
in sea snake venoms but is not present in the viperid and crotalid venoms (Russell, 
1983). 
RNAse is an endopolynucleotidase present in some snake venoms in small amounts. It 
appears to have specificity towards pyrimidine-containing primidyl adenyl bonds in 
RNA. The optimum pH is 7-9 when ribosomal RNA is used as the substrate 
(Mahalakshmi et al., 2000). 
DNAse acts on DNA and gives predominantly tri- or higher oligonucleotides that 
terminate in 3' monoester phosphate. Crotalus adamanteus venom contains two 
DNAses with optimum pH at 5 and 9 (Sales et al., 2008). 
5' nucleotidase specifically hydrolyses the phosphate monoesters which link the 5' 
 position of DNA and RNA. It is a common constituent of all snake venoms and, in most 
instances it is the most active phosphatase in the venom. It is found in greater amounts 
in crotalid and viperid venoms than in elapid venoms (Sales et al., 2008). 
NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) nucleotidase catalyses the hydrolysis of the 
nicotinamide-N-ribosidic linkage of NAD, yielding nicotinamide and adenosine 
diphosphate ribosides. Its optimum pH is between 6.5 and 8.5 (Aird, 2005). Within 
subfamilies it is present in some genera, but not others e.g. present in Agkistrodon but 
not in Crotolus and in Bungarus but not in Naja (Russell, 1983). 
L-amino acid oxidase (LAO) catalyses the oxidation of L-a-amino and a-hydroxy acids, 
and is the most active enzyme of the known amino acid oxidases. The enzyme is 
responsible for the yellow colour of the snake venom. All venoms so far examined 
contain this enzyme (Russell, 1983). 
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) reversibly catalyses the conversion of lactic acid into 
pyruvic acid. It has been reported in a few elapid venoms and was not found in others 
(McLean, 1971). 
The proteolytic enzymes are of two types: metalloproteases and serine proteases. As this 
research mainly focuses on these enzymes, they will be discussed in detail in section 
1.3.2 Non-enzymatic proteins and peptides 
Snake venom contains a variety of biologically active non-enzymatic peptides, proteins, 
and organic compounds such as alkaloids. Their roles are different from the venom 
enzymes as they do not have catalytic activity. These are described below. 
1.3.2.1 Neurotoxins 
Neurotoxins are mainly found in the venoms of elapids and sea snakes. Several 
neurotoxins have been identified and they primarily act upon the voltage-dependent ion 
channels of membranes such as sodium, potassium and calcium ion channels, 
neuromuscular junctions, and thus block neurotransmission. There are different types of 
neurotoxins: alpha, beta, kappa and dendro neurotoxins. 
Alpha-neurotoxins such as alpha-bungarotoxin from elapids (Bungarus multicinctus, 
Naja sp), erabutoxin from the sea snake (Laticauda semifasciata) and cobratoxin from 
the Indian cobra (Naja naja) inhibit the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor of the 
neuromuscular junction to block neurotransmission (Low et al., 1976). These are also 
called postsynaptic neurotoxins as they act on postsynaptic membranes. 
Beta-neurotoxins such as notexin from the tiger snake venom (Notechis scutatus 
scutatus) (Mollier et al., 1990), ammoclytoxin, beta-bungarotoxin from the Taiwanese 
branded krait (Bungarus multicinctus), crotoxin from the South American rattlesnake 
(Crotalus durissus terrijicus), taipoxin from the Australian taipan (Oxyuranus 
scutellatus scutellatus) block neuromuscular transmission by keeping the nerve ends 
free from liberating acetylcholine. They can potentially block the release of newly 
synthesised acetylcholine receptors (Gundersen et al., 1981). These toxins also interact 
with voltage dependent potassium channels. 
Kappa bungarotoxins (Bungarus sp) are involved in blocking the central nervous 
system's cholinergic receptors. 
Dendrotoxins from mamba snakes (Dendroapsis sp) block particular subtypes of 
,~ voltage-gated potassiwn channels in neurons, thereby enhancing the release of 
acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions, which may result in muscle hyperexcitability 
and convulsive symptoms (Gasparini et al., 1998). The well studied dendrotoxins are 
dendrotoxin I and dendrotoxin K from black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) and alpha-
dendrotoxin from eastern green mamba (Dendroaspis angusticeps). 
1.3.2.2 Cardiotoxins 
Cardiotoxins are toxins which affect the cardiac functions by attacking the cardiac 
muscles. These are also called as cytotoxins. These toxins are mainly found in elapid 
snakes. Some examples are cardiotoxin II (cytotoxin II) from Naja naja oxiana 
(Dubovskii et al., 2001), cardiotoxin III (cytotoxin 3) from Chinese cobra Naja naja 
atra (Forouhar et al., 2003) and cardiotoxin V4II from Naja mossambica mossambica 
(Rees et al., 1990). These toxins disturb the plasma membranes of cardiac fibre ceIIs 
... and produce irreversible depolarisation and thus cause dysarythmia and hypotension, 
leading to death. 
1.3.2.3 Myotoxins 
Myotoxins occur mainly in sea snakes, vipers and elapids. These toxins lead to 
muscular degeneration by interacting with voltage-dependent sodium channels. They 
also penetrate into muscle cells and produce necrosis. Myotoxin-a from prairie 
rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis viridis) (Nedelkov et al., 1997) and crotamine from South 
American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus terrificus) (Goncalves et aI., 1956) are well 
studied myotoxins from vipers. 
1.3.3 Other non-enzymatic venom toxins 
Several low molecular weight small peptides have been found in the venoms of various 
snakes. Platelet aggregating peptide (Francischetti et al., 2004) and C-type lectins (Lin 
et al., 2007) are involved in the aggregation of platelets in the vascular system of prey or 
victims and lead to clotting disorders. Vasoendothelial growth factor indirectly affects 
the growth of vascular endothelium (Lomonte et al., 2008). Bradykinin potentiating 
peptides are involved in the conversion of bradykinin into kinin which in tum induces 
vasodilation to cause hypotension (Lomonte et al., 2008). Disintegrins are a group of 
peptides isolated from various snake venoms and they have a ROD (arginine-glycine-
aspartate) domain which binds to integrin receptors and inhibits the normal integrin-
ligand interactions. They prevent platelet aggregation by binding to the adhesive 
domains on the surface of platelets (Francischetti et al., 2004). 
Some snake venoms such as green mamba (Dendroapsis sp) contain a large amount of 
acetylcholine which causes pain and acts as a primary defensive response (Welsh, 
1967). Serotonin is a pharmacologically active compound which is mostly absent from 
snake venoms but is found in large quantities in the venom of Bitis gabonica, an 
African gaboon adder (Welsh, 1966). This can act as a vasoconstrictor and thus increase 
the blood pressure. 
1.4 Snake venom metalloproteases 
Snake venom proteolytic enzymes can be divided into 2 major groups according to their 
activities: snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs) and snake venom serine proteases 
(SVSPs). These enzymes mostly occur in viper venoms with a few found in colubrids, 
elapids and sea snakes. 
1.4.1 Metalloproteases in general 
Metalloproteases usually depend on a zinc ion for their activity. Zinc dependent 
metalloproteases occur in many biological systems and participate in a number of 
important physiological processes. For example carboxypeptidases A and B play key 
roles in digestion (Auld, 1974), collagenases may be destructive agents in arthritis 
(Harris, 1974) and angiotensin converting enzyme is important in the regulation of 
blood pressure (peach, 1977). 
Metalloproteases can be exopeptidases or endopeptidases/proteases. Exopeptidases 
cleave the ends of a polypeptide chain (aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases). 
Endopeptidases/proteases cleave proteins internally. Figure 1.7 shows the reactions 
catalysed by metallo endo and exopeptidases.

exopeptidases. This image was taken from Page et al. (1987). 
1.4.2 Classification of metaUoproteases 
Metalloproteases are one of the most diverse families of peptidases and contain about 
30 families so far (Rawlings & Barrett 1995). About half of these contain a common 
zinc binding motif called a HEXXH motif, where X is any amino acid and the bold 
letters in italics indicate the experimentally proved zinc ligands. Other investigations 
confinned that other amino acids are also involved in zinc binding. Hooper (1994) 
classified the metalloproteases based on the super families and the residues around the 
conserved zinc binding motif. Based on the presence of amino acids involved in the 
binding of zinc along with the HEXXH motif, Rawlings & Barrett (1995) classified the 
metalloproteases into families, clans and super families. This classification is mainly 
based on the evolutionary relationship~ of enzymes and is more powerful than other 
methods of classifications such as those based on reactions catalysed, substrates used 
etc. (Rawlings & Barrett 1995). Both classifications are discussed in this section. 
In the classification, the term 'family' describes a group of peptidases that are shown by 
their primary structures to be evolutionarily related (Rawlings & Barrett 1995). All the 
members of a family defined in this way are believed to have arisen by divergent 
evolution from a single ancestral protein and thus they are homologous. The term 'clan' 
represents a group of families which have diverged from a common ancestral protein, 
but they have diverged so far that we can no longer prove their relationships by 
comparison of their primary structures and have to place them in several separate 
families (Rawlings & Barrett 1995). The term 'superfamily' was introduced in order to 
place some of the families which share the amino acids involved in the catalytic 
mechanisms and are related to some extent (Rawlings & Barrett 1995). 
In general the metalloproteases were divided into 4 categories: zincins, inverzincins, 
carboxypeptidases and DD-carboxypeptidases (Hooper, 1994). The detailed 
classification of Hooper (1994) and Rawlings & Barrett (1995) is shown in figure 1.8.

corresponding families c1asslned by Rawlings & Barrett (1995) are shown In black boxes. This figure was made using information from Hooper 
(1995) and Rawlings & Barrett (1995). 
1.4.2.1 Zincins 
The zincins are metalloproteases which contain a HEXXH short zinc binding consensus 
sequence (Bode et al., 1993). Zincins are divided into two superfamilies together with 
another group with an unknown 3rd ligand. These superfamilies are g1uzincins and 
metzincins. 
1.4.2.1.1 Gluzincins 
The g1uzincins superfamily contains metalloproteases which contain two zinc binding 
ligands in the short zinc binding HEXXH motif and a glutamate as a third zinc binding 
meta1loproteases: thermolysin, endopeptidase 24.11, angiotensin converting enzyme 
and aminopeptidases (Hooper, 1994). The corresponding names given for these families 
by Rawlings & Barrett 1995 are shown in figure 1.8. 
1.4.2.1.2 Metzincins 
Metzincins are metalloproteases which contain 3 histidine residues as zinc binding 
ligands. 2 of these are in the consensus zinc HEXXH zinc binding motif and the third 
histidine occurs 11 amino acids later in the sequence. These metalloproteases have an 
unique methionine containing tum (met-tum) of similar conformation. The individual 
families of this superfamily were distinguished by the presence of amino acids next to 
the third zinc binding histidine residue and also the residues surrounding the methionine 
present in the met-tum (Hooper, 1994). Astacin, serratia, reprolysin and matrixin 
families are included in this superfamily. The corresponding family names given for 
these families by Rawlings & Barrett (1995) are shown in figure 1.8. 
1.4.2.1.3 Families with unknown 3rd zinc binding ligand 
Some families such as endopeptidase 24.15 and tetanus and botulism neurotoxins are 
included in a superfamily which has an unidentified third ligand. Though Hooper (1994) 
included these families in the gluzincins superfamily as their third zinc binding ligands 
were proposed to be glutamate, Rawlings & Barrett (1995) have included them as 
unknown groups (figure 1.8). 
1.4.2.2 Inverzincins 
A small group of zinc metalloproteases is characterised by having an inverted zinc 
binding motif HXXEll and this group has been named inverzincins (Hooper, 1994). 
This group includes insulin-degrading enzymes, pitrilysin and yeast processing 
enhancing protein. Hooper (1994) included these enzymes in the family of insulinase 
(figure 1.8). 
1.4.2.3 Carboxypeptidases 
This family includes all types of carboxypeptidases such as A, B, H, M, N, U, T etc. 
They have a unique short zinc binding motif containing the first two ligands, histidine 
and a glutamate, with the third zinc ligand, a histidine some distance (108-135 amino 
acids) C-terminal to this (figure 1.8). 
1.4.2.4 DD-carboxypeptidases 
D-alanyl-D-alanine-cleaving carboxypeptidase (DD-carboxypeptidase) from 
Streptomyces a/bus has been shown to have three histidine residues as zinc binding 
ligands, two of which occur in the HXH motif. A third zinc binding residue, a histidine 
is located 42 residues N-terminal to the HXH motif (Hooper, 1994). 
1.4.3 Structure of metalloproteases 
Metalloproteases contain several domains along with a common zinc binding catalytic 
domain. Thus the structures of metalloproteases vary depending on the domains present 
(examples of various domains in SVMPs are discussed in section 1.4.5). The catalytic 
domain of metalloproteases seems to be similar in all the enzymes. It is made of both a 
helices and ~ strands. The active site containing the zinc binding motif is found in the 
centre of the domain (Bjarnason et aI. , 1995) (figure 1.9). 
Figure 1.9 (A) The catalytic domain and (8) the catalytic site of metalloproteases 
showing the zinc binding residues (in white colour) and a zinc ion at the centre. 
This image was obtained from the PDB (code: lZIW) structure of tricorn 
interacting factor F3 which is a zinc dependent aminopeptidase A from an archean 
Thermoplasma acidophilum (Kyrieleis et al., 2005) using Protein Explorer. 
1.4.4 Catalytic mechanism of zinc binding metaUoproteases 
As the only metalloprotease studied in this research is an aminopeptidase A, the specific 
catalytic mechanism of human aminopeptidase A (Iturrioz et aI., 2001) is explained in 
detail. In the absence of substrate, the zinc ion is tetra-coordinated by 3 zinc ligands (i.e. 
histidine 385, histidine 389 and glutamate 408) and a water molecule. When the 
substrate enters, the recognition and orientation of the active site is enabled by several 
other residues. In the first step, a Ca2+ ion in the Sl subsite interacts with the PI 
carboxylate side chain of the substrate. Glutamate 352 in the anionic binding site 
interacts with the :free N-tenninal part of the substrate. Simultaneously the zinc ion is 
hexa-coordinated by establishing two additional interactions, one with the carbonyl 
group of the scissile bond and another with the unprotonated a-amine group of 
substrate. Then the negative charge of glutamate 386 polarises the zinc-coordinated 
water molecule and promotes its nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl atom of the peptide 
bond to be cleaved. The resulting tetrahedral intennediate is stabilised by electrostatic 
interactions with the zinc ion and hydrogen bonds with glutamate 386, tyrosine 471 and 
glutamate 352. Finally the transfer of a proton from glutamate 386 to the leaving 
nitrogen of the scissile bond triggers the cleavage of the peptide bond and releases the 
products. 
.. 1.4.5 Snake venom metaUoproteases 
Snake venom metalloproteases include both metallo endoproteases and exopeptidases. 
These enzymes have been found in viper and elapid venoms (Bjarnason et al., 1995) so 
1.4.5.1 Venom metallo-endoproteases 
The viper venom metallo endoproteases exert their effect around the snake bite site. 
They mainly act upon the collagenous structures in the inter- and intra-cellular matrix of 
the vasoendothelial cells of small blood vessels, causing haemorrhage at the bite site 
(Ownby, 1978). 
Four types of metallo endoproteases (type I to IV) have been found in snake venoms 
(figure 1.10). They belong to the reprolysin subfamily of the Ml2 family of 
metalloproteases and vary in molecular weight from 24-68kDa, with the smallest 
enzymes containing just the catalytic domain and the larger enzymes containing one or 
more domains. The higher molecular weight enzymes are more effective at inducing 
haemorrhage, though the reason for this is not understood (Hite, 1992). These 
metalloproteases have been classified based on the presence of various domains and 
their molecular weights. All are most likely stored as inactive zymogens in order to 
prevent autodigestion and are then activated by suitable proteolytic processing (Grams, 
1993). 
Type I metalloproteases are the lowest molecular weight proteins around 24kDa, 
containing only the metalloprotease domain and showing activity against matrix 
proteins. This group of enzymes is synthesised as an inactive form with signal and 
propeptides along with the metalloprotease domain. During posttranslational 
modification the signal peptide is removed and during activation the propeptide is 
removed in order to convert the inactive zymogen into an active enzyme (Siigur et al., 
2004). An example of type I metalloprotease is lebetase-4, a fibrinogenolytic enzyme 
from Vipera lebetina.

III Metalloprotease domain Cys-rich 
IV Metalloprotease domain 
Figure 1.10 Different types (I-IV) of metalloproteases with various domains. The 
metalloprotease domain is shown in blue, disintegrin in red, cysteine-rich domain 
in yellow and C-type lectins in black boxes. The information was taken from 
Bjarnason et al. (1995). 
Type II metalloproteases have a higher molecular weight and contain both 
metalloprotease and disintegrin domains. These enzymes are synthesised in an inactive 
form as type I metalloproteases but with an additional disintegrin domain. During 
posttranslational modification, the disintegrin domain may be cleaved off in some cases 
and released as disintegrin in the venom. Otherwise, the type II metalloprotease will be 
formed. An example of type II metalloprotease is lebetase-3, a fibrinogen degrading 
enzyme from Vipera lebetina (Siigur et aI. , 2004). 
Type III metalloproteases contain metalloprotease, disintegrin and a cysteine rich 
domain. These enzymes occur both in monomeric and dimeric forms. An example of 
this type of metalloprotease is human endothelial cell apoptosis inducing protease from 
Vipera lebetina (Siigur et aI. , 2004). 
Type-IV metalloproteases contain a heavy and two light chains. The heavy chain is the 
same as type ill metalloprotease. In addition to this. two light chains composed of C-
type lectins are synthesised from individual genes and connected to the heavy chain by 
disulphide linkages post-translationally. An example of this type is factor X activator 
from Vipera lebetina (Siigur et al., 2004). 
Another group of metalloproteases isolated from snake venoms is ADAMs [A 
disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM)] or adamalysins. These enzymes contain 
subunits like reprolysins but additionally have an epidermal growth factor like domain, 
transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail (Black et al., 1998). 
1.4.5.2 Venom metaUo-exopeptidases 
Metalloexopeptidase, particularly aminopeptidase activities have been found in 
viperidae and elapidae snakes such as Gloydius halys blomhoffi and Bungarus 
multicinctus (Murata et al., 1963). 
Several types of aminopeptidases have been found in snake venom: aminopeptidase A 
which can cleave N-terminal acidic amino acids, aminopeptidase B which can cleave N-
terminal basic amino acids, aminopeptidase N which can cleave N-terminal neutral 
amino acids and aminopeptidase M which can cleave N-tenninal methionine (Feracci et 
al., 1980). To date only one aminopeptidase A has been characterised and this is from 
the venom of Gloydius blomhoffi brevicaudus (Ogawa et al., 2007). No determined 
structure of snake venom aminopeptidases is available to date and the functions of these 
enzymes in venom are not understood. 
1.5 Snake venom serine proteases 
Serine proteases are enzymes which have a catalytic serine residue in their active site. 
They hydrolyse peptide bonds in target substrates. They are present in virtually all 
organisms and can be intracellular or extracellular enzymes. They play important roles 
in processes such as digestion, blood coagulation, post translational processing of 
secreted proteins and neurotransmission. 
1.5.1 Serine proteases in general 
1.5.1.1 Classification of serine proteases 
Rawlings & Barrett (1995) classified the serine proteases into 6 clans (SA, SB, SC, SD, 
SE and SF) and more than 20 families (SI, S2, etc) (figure 1.11). Clan SA includes 
enzymes such as chymotrypsin and enzymes which have a chymotrypsin-like 
mechanism and structural fold. The SB clan includes subtilisin and related enzymes and 
the SC clan includes enzymes related to carboxypeptidase C. The structural folds of 
each clan are completely different though SA and SB show similarities in catalysis. 
Clan SA includes mostly enzymes with endoprotease activities. As the snake venom 
serine proteases are in the S 1 family of the SA clan, the remaining sections in this 
chapter explain more about this family of enzymes. 
Figure 1.11 The classification of serine proteases. The boxes at the top show the 
clans; the middle boxes show the known catalytic triads of the respective clans and 
the boxes at the bottom show the families included in each clan. 
1.5.1.2 Structure of serine proteases 
The structure of members of the S 1 family of serine protease consists of 2 domains, 
each of which contains around 120 amino acids. The domains are similar in structure 
and are thought to have evolved by gene duplication. Each domain consists of an anti-
parallel beta barrel containing six beta strands. Two loop regions of each domain form 
the active site (figure l.12). The active site cleft and the catalytic residues are located at 
the junction of the two barrels (figure 1.12). 
Figure 1.12 Determined structure of chymotrypsin (PDB code: IGCT) (Dixon et 
aI., 1989) showing two domains with the catalytic site (shown red) between them. 
This diagram was generated using Protein Explorer. 
1.5.1.3 Catalytic mechanism 
Serine proteases have a conserved catalytic triad consisting of serine, histidine and 
aspartic acid, which are numbered histidine 57, aspartate 102 and serine 195 according 
to their location within the chymotrypsin sequence. The catalytic triad introduces a 
charge relay network, in which histidine 57 is polarised by the nearby aspartate 102, 
promoting its capacity as a proton shuttle. When the serine 195 O-y attacks the 
substrate, the serine hydrogen is transferred to histidine 57. During catalysis the 
oxyanion of the substrate forms hydrogen bonds to two main chain amide NH groups, 
belonging to residues glycine 193 and serine 195. This binding site is termed the 
'oxyanion hole' (Harel et aI., 1991). In this mechanism serine functions as the primary 
nucleophile and histidine plays a dual role as a proton acceptor and donor at different 
steps in the reaction. The histidine side chain increases the nucleophilicity of serine 195 
(Harel et aI. , 1991). Aspartate is thought to bring the histidine residue into the correct 
orientation to facilitate nucleophilic attack by serine. The mechanism of action is 
common to all serine proteases due to the conserved stereochemistry of the catalytic 
triad (Betzel, 2001) and is shown in figure 1 .13 .

1.5.1.4 Specificity pocket of serine proteases 
The primary specificity pocket is located next to the catalytic triad and recognises and 
locates the side chain of the substrate, allowing cleavage at the scissile bond. The 
consecutive residues in the substrate sequence which interact with the enzyme are 
labelled PI, P2, P3, P4 etc. towards the N-terminus and PI', P2' , P3' , P4' , etc. towards 
the C-terminus. The corresponding residues in the serine protease which interact with 
the substrate are SI (interacts with PI), S2, S3, S4 etc. towards the N-terminus and SI' , 
S2' , S3', S4', etc. towards the C-tenninus (figure 1.14). The S I residue is at the bottom 
of the primary specificity pocket and is a major determinant of the specificity of the 
enzyme. Chymotrypsin has serine 189 at S 1, and glycine 216 and glycine 226 at the 
sides of the specificity pocket, which confers specificity towards aromatic amino acids. 
Trypsin has aspartate at position 189 and thus conferring specificity towards basic 
amino acids such as lysine or arginine at PI site. Mutation of glycine 216 to the slightly 
larger alanine in trypsin makes trypsin to be specific just for arginine at PI site. 
Elastase, which contains threonine 226 and valine 216 at the sides of the specificity 
pocket, is selective for small amino acids such as glycine (Perona, 1995). 
Figure 1.14 The position of residues in substrates (P) and enzymes (S) involved in 
binding. 
The loops present between the beta-strands also play a critical role in substrate 
recognition (Matthews, 1967). 3 major loops in serine proteases have been discussed in 
relation to this: the 34 loop (starts at residue 34). the 99 loop (starts at residue 99) and 
the 174 loop (starts at residue 174). 
1.5.2 Snake venom serine proteases 
Serine proteases have been found in several snakes of the viperidae family, with a few 
found in colubridae and hydrophidae families. The functions of the few serine proteases 
identified from colubridae and hydrophidae snakes are still not understood. However 
viper venom serine proteases affect the blood coagulation system of both prey and 
victim in various ways. They have anti-coagulant and pro-coagulant effects on blood. 
As this study mainly focuses on viper venom serine proteases, the rest of this section is 
focused mainly on these enzymes. 
These effects of snake venom have been known for a long time. Fontana (1787) as cited 
by Weiss et al. (1969) was probably the first person to show that the venoms of many 
snakes had the ability to clot human and animal blood. Eagle (1937) did an extensive 
study and showed that many snakes of the crotalinae subfamily coagulated citrated 
horse plasma, indicating that coagulation is not due to the conversion of prothrombin to 
thrombin, as this would require Ca2+. These and later studies showed that this ability to 
clot blood is due to the direct action of the venom on the fibrinogen components of the 
blood and the clotting components of the venom have subsequently been identified as 
serine proteases. 
1.5.2.1 Blood coagulation system 
Blood is a fluid tissue containing both plasma and formed elements. The plasma is the 
fluid part containing all the blood clotting (coagulation) factors and other elements. The 
formed elements cover the cellular part including red blood cells, white blood cells and 
platelets. Blood clotting is part of an important host defence mechanism termed 
haemostasis (the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel). Upon vessel injury, 
platelets adhere to macromolecules in the sub-endothelial tissues and then aggregate to 
form the primary haemostatic plug. The platelets stimulate local activation of plasma 
coagulation factors, leading to generation of a fibrin clot that reinforces the platelet 
aggregates. Later, as wound healing occurs, the platelet aggregates and the fibrin clots 
t-- are broken down by fibrinolysis. Mechanisms that restrict the formation of platelet 
aggregates and fibrin clots to the sites of injury are necessary to maintain the fluidity of 
the blood (Voet & Voet 2004). 
Several components of the blood coagulation system are serine proteases. For example, 
thrombin is a multifunctional serine protease which is involved in both coagulant and 
anti-coagulant activities. Thrombin has a chymotrypsin-like fold and arginine at the S 1 
site. It is sensitive to many naturally occurring inhibitors such as hirugen, hirudin, soya 
bean trypsin inhibitor, anti-thrombin, etc. 
Human tissue plasminogen activator (tP A) is a circulating plasminogen activator which 
converts plasminogen into plasmin which in turn dissolves the blood clot. tP A has 5 
domains; an epidermal growth factor domain, a zinc finger domain, two kringle 
domains and a serine protease domain which has a chymotrypsin-like fold (Bode et al., 
1996). 
1.5.2.2 Functions of viper venom serine proteases 
The serine proteases affect the haemostasis of victims by interfering with various stages 
of blood clotting through the activation or inactivation of clotting factors (figure 1.15). 
Thus, they cause dysfunction of components in the circulatory system and also allow 
the entry of venom into various organs to cause local effects. Viper venom serine 
proteases can have either pro-coagulant or anti-coagulant activity. 
1.5.2.2.1 Pro-coagulant serine proteases 
These enzymes clot the blood via a variety of mechanisms. Some are directly involved 
in the coagulation cascade by activating factors such as fibrinogen, factor V etc. and 
others are indirectly involved by activating kininogen. Most of the fibrinogen 
converting enzymes are called fibrinogenases or thrombin-like enzymes, and the 
kininogen activating enzymes are called kininogenases or kallikrein-like enzymes 
(pirkle, 1998). Some of the clotting enzymes also activate factor XIII in a thrombin-like 
manner to cross link the fibrin clot (pirkle, 1998). According to their various activities , 
these enzymes can be subdivided into the following categories: 
Thrombin-like enzymes 
The serine proteases which convert fibrinogen into fibrin are known as thrombin-like 
enzymes because of their similarity to thrombin. These enzymes generally release only 
fibrinopeptide A from the Aa chain of fibrinogen, although some release both 
fibrinopeptides A and B. Examples of these enzymes include batroxobin from Bothrops 
atrox (Itoh, 1987), ancrod from Calloselama rhodostoma (Burkhart, 1992), crotalase 
from Crotalus adamanteus (Henschen, 1999) and acutobin from Deinagkistrodon 
acutus (Wang et al., 2001). 
Kininogenases 
Kininogenases convert kininogen into bradykinin, which in turns activates various 
factors in the blood coagulation cascade. Some of these enzymes also act upon 
fibrinogen by releasing both fibrinopeptides A and B. Examples include halystase from 
Gloydius halys (Matsui, 1998) and calobin from Gloydius ussuriensis (Hahn, 1996). 
Some of the kininogenases act on fibrinogen to release only fibrinopeptide B. Examples 
are mucofibrases from Trimeresurus (Protobothrops) mucrosquamatus (Hung, 1994) 
and kinin releasing and fibrinogen clotting enzyme from Bothrops jararaca (Serrano, 
1998). 
Factor V activators 
Coagulation factor V is a key regulatory factor in the blood coagulation cascade. Some 
of the viper venom serine proteases directly activate factor V. These include Russell's 
viper venom factor V activator (RVV-V) from Daboia russelli (Tokunaga et al., 1988) 
and a factor V activator from Macrovipera lebetina (Siigur et al., 1998). 
Platelet aggregators 
Some viper venom serine proteases aggregate human platelets and thus make blood clot. 
An example of this enzyme is platelet aggregator from Bothrops jararaca. 
1.5.2.2.2 Anti-coagulant serine proteases 
These enzymes degrade blood clots or make the blood non-clottable. They act on fibrin 
clots either directly by acting on fibrin or indirectly by converting plasminogen into 
plasmin. An example of a fibrin-degrading enzyme is the thrombin like enzyme 
defibrase from Gloydius saxatilis. Some examples of enzymes directly converting 
plasminogen into plasmin are plasminogen activators from Trimeresurus stejnegeri 
(Parry et aI., 1998), Gloydius halys and Lachesis muta muta (Sanchez et aI., 2000). 
Protein C activator 
Some viper venom serine proteases activate protein C and thereby back regulate or 
inhibit the blood coagulation by denaturing active factor V and VIII. One well-known 
example of this enzyme is protein C activator (ACe-C) from Agkistrodon contortrix 
contortrix (Kisiel, 1987).

1.6 Medical uses of snake venom proteins 
A number of snake venom toxins and enzymes playa key role in medical diagnosis and 
treatment of several critical diseases (Marsh et al., 2005). For example, venom 
thrombin-like enzymes are used to assay fibrinogen and its breakdown products for the 
detection of fibrinogen dysfunction (pirkle, 1998). Venom thrombin-like enzymes 
particularly reptilase (commercial name of bothrombin, a thrombin-like enzyme from 
Bothrops atrox) are not inhibited by heparin and thus can be used for assaying 
antithrombin III and other haemostatic variables in heparin-containing samples (Howie 
et al., 1973; Canoso et al., 1979). Snake venoms are a rich source of prothrombin 
activators and these are utilised in prothrombin assays, for studying 
dysprothrombinaemias and for preparing meizothrombin and non-enzymic forms of 
prothrombin (Rosing et al., 1992). Russell's viper (DabOia russe//i) venom contains 
toxins which have been used to assay blood clotting factors V (Kisiel et al., 1981), VII 
(Quick, 1971), X, platelet factor 3 (Hardisty et al., 1966) and, importantly, lupus 
anticoagulants (LA) (Martin et al., 1996). Other prothrombin activators (from the 
taipan, Australian brown snake and saw-scaled viper) have now been used to assay LA 
(Marsh et al., 2005). Protein C and activated protein C resistance can be measured by 
using Russell's viper venom and Protac, a commercial name for protein C activator 
from southern copperhead snake venom (Klein et al., 1986) and von Willebrand factor 
can be studied with botrocetin from Bothrops jararaca venom (Read et al., 1983). The 
disintegrins, a large family of arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)-containing snake 
venom proteins, show potential value in studying platelet glycoprotein receptors, 
notably, GPIIblIIIa and Ib (De Luca et al., 1995). 
Snake venom toxins affecting haemostasis are also been used in therapeutic 
developments. For example, Ancrod (from the Malayan pit viper, Calloselasma 
rhodostoma), has been used as an anticoagulant under the commercial name of Arvin 
for treating stroke, heart attack, deep vein thrombosis, etc. It has recently been 
suggested that use of Arvin in ischaemic stroke patients is better and costs less than 
other existing drugs (Samsa et al., 2002). 
1.7 Rationale of this research 
Snake venom proteins are a very interesting potential source for novel drug design for 
the treatment for hlUDan haemostatic disorders and snake bites. To date the treatment of 
snake bites is based simply on antivenom produced in animals. This antivenom shows 
several draw backs such as allergic reactions caused in the host system, cost and 
difficulties of production, ethical issues, etc. Thus there is a need to develop cheaper 
and more effective treatments for snake bite. Also several medically valuable enzymes 
could be developed from snake venom for the diagnosis of critical diseases. Thus snake 
venoms are an invaluable source for continuing research. However research to date in 
the field of snake venom proteins is less than other popular researches e.g. 
cardiovascular diseases, etc. This could be due to the unawareness of importance of 
snake venom proteins, the difficulties in catching and handling snakes in laboratories, 
requirement of experts for venom extraction and maintenance of snakes. 
Primarily this research aimed to focus on viper venom serine proteases. Preliminary 
analysis based on the literature and available sequences from publicly available 
databases showed several features: the sequence of over 100 viper venom serine 
proteases are known but most of them are functionally unknown and only four crystal 
structures are available to date. Furthermore extracting the available details of viper 
venom serine proteases is not straightforward as they are scattered in different sources 
such as databases, relevant articles, etc. Thus bioinformatics-based research to collect 
and analyse these sequences and their structures and functions was planned. 
In order to increase the number of functionally characterised viper venom serine 
protease sequences an experimental approach was developed. The viper Bitis gabonica 
rhinoceros (West African gaboon adder) (figure 1.16) was chosen as this is a physically 
large viper and can yield up to a gram of venom per milking. The envenomation of this 
snake causes a dramatic fall in arterial blood pressure, unstable circulation, severe 
coagulation disorder and tissue damage followed by necrosis (Marsh et al., 1997). 
~ Initially purification, characterisation, sequencing and crystallisation of all the serine 
proteases present in thjs venom was planned. During this research we also purified and 
studied a metaLloprotease from this venom. 
Figure 1.16 Image of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros (West Mrican gaboon adder), the 
one used in this research. This snake measured 85cm in length (head to tail) and 
10em in width (middle of the body) at the time the photograph was taken. The 
scale bar 1ern is equal to 5.67 em of snake length. This image was taken at 
Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, University of Liverpool. 
Further our understanding of the little studied Bitis gabonica rhinoceros venom and also 
our use of both experimental and computational approaches will help to understand the 
relationships between sequence, structure and function of viper venom proteins in 
general. Furthermore our study should increase the number of sequences and structures 
of venom proteins available in the databases. Ultimately such understanding may be 
useful for designing inhibitors at least for a group of venom proteins such as serine 
proteases and these could be used to develop a novel antidote to treat snake bites.

2.2 Protein visualisation methods in gels 
2.2.1 Reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
Acrylamide gel electrophoresis is a classical method to separate proteins from complex 
mixtures under an electric field between two charged electrodes. Proteins are separated 
based on their migration speed and distance migrated. To detennine the apparent 
molecular weight of proteins, sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is a standard method introduced by Laemmli et al. (1970). 
In this method, the proteins are denatured by reducing the disulfide linkages in the 
presence of a reducing agent, usually B-mercaptoethanol, and heating to break the non-
covalent linkages. The reduced and heat denatured proteins are linearized in order to 
make the movement independent of the shape and structure of proteins. SDS is an 
anionic detergent which has negative charge and moves towards to the anode in the 
electric field. The mixing of SDS with proteins allows the binding of SDS molecules 
with amino acid residues in the denatured polypeptide chains. Thus, the entire 
polypeptide chain acquires a negative charge and moves under the influence of the 
electric field towards the anode. 
Polyacrylamide gels are made by cross linking acrylamide and bis-acrylamide 
molecules in the presence of ammonium persulphate (APS) and a catalyst N,N,N',N'-
tetramethylethyienediamine (TEMED). This is initiated in the presence of free radical 
S04- ions produced by the decay of ammonium persulfate. TEMED is a catalyst which 
speeds up the fonnation of the free radicals. Cross linked polyacrylamide gels are 
porous to enable the migration of proteins through them. The size of the pores depends 
on the percentage of acrylamide and bis-acrylamide solutions. Buffer solutions maintain 
the pH throughout the fonnation and running of gels. There are generally two different 
types of polyacrylamide gels used for the separation of proteins: discontinuous and 
continuous. Discontinuous gels are usually prepared using two different concentrations 
of acrylamide gel solutions: a low percentage of acrylamide gel at the top called 
stacking gel to stack all the proteins present in the sample at approximately neutral pH. 
There is a higher percentage running separating gel under the stacking gel to separate 
the proteins under alkaline pH i.e. 8.8. The stacked proteins migrate evenly and slowly 
in the separating gel. Continuous gels are prepared with a single buffer solution for both 
stacking and resolving gels in order to separate the proteins under same conditions 
throughout the gel and the proteins migrate evenly from the point ofloading. 
For discontinuous SDS-PAGE in this research, protein samples were separated as 
described by Laemmli et aI. (1970) using 4% (v/v) acrylamide stacking gel [1.25m13M 
Tris-HCl pH 6.8, O.lmI 10% (w/v) SDS, 3.3m1 acrylamide : bisacrylamide (30:0.8) 
mix, O.5mllO% (w/v) ammonium persulphate, 15~1 TEMEO and 6.3 mI MilIi-Q water] 
and 10% (v/v) acrylamide resolving/separating gel [3.75m13M Tris-HCI pH 8.8, 0.3ml 
10% (w/v) SDS, IOmI acrylamide : bisacrylamide (30:0.8) mix, 1.5m1 10% (w/v) 
ammonium per sulphate, 30~1 TEMED and 14.45ml Milli-Q water]. The casting of the 
gel was perfonned using the 'Protean II' apparatus (Bio-Rad, UK). The stacking gel 
was prepared with sample loading wells at the top of the gel. The protein samples were 
prepared in equal volume of Laemmli reducing sample treatment buffer (RSTB) [10% 
(w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) 6-Mercaptoethanol, 1 % (w/v) bromophenol blue, 50% (v/v) 
glycerol, 1M Tris (PH 6.8) & Milli-Q water]. The bromophenol blue present in the 
RSTB indicates the movement of protein samples during electrophoresis as it migrates 
faster than proteins due to its very low molecular weight (6700a). The protein samples 
were heated at around 95C for 10 minutes to denature the proteins completely. The 
heat treated samples were centrifuged at 5000xg for 5 minutes to remove the particulate 
materials. The samples were loaded in each lane along with protein low molecular 
weight markers (Bio-Rad) to calculate the appropriate molecular weights of proteins. 
The gels were submerged and run in running buffer [0.025M Tris-HCI, 0.192M glycine, 
and 0.1% (w/v) SDS pH 8.3]. The electrophoresis was perfonned at 16mA fixed current 
for overnight. 
2.2.2 Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is another way of separating proteins based 
on their native charge, shape and size. The use of detergent and reducing agents is 
avoided to allow the migration of native proteins without any modifications or 
denaturation. This technique was first introduced by Davis et aI. (1964). As the proteins 
are not denatured in this method, the native structure and activity of enzymes are 
'7 retained. The disadvantage of this method is that the accurate molecular weight of the 
proteins cannot be calculated as they migrate based on their native charge in the gel. 
The buffers maintain the pH and protect the proteins from denaturation during the 
electrophoresis. 
For discontinuous native-PAGE, protein samples were separated using 4% (v/v) 
acrylamide stacking gel [1.25m13M Tris-HCI pH 6.8, 3.3m1 acrylamide: bisacrylamide 
(30:0.8) mix, O.5mIIO% (w/v) ammonium persulphate, 15111 TEMED and 6.4ml Milli-
Q water] and 8% (v/v) acrylamide resolving/separating gel [3.75m1 of 3M Tris-HCI pH 
8.8, 8m1 of acrylamide : bisacrylamide (30:0.8) mix, 1.5m1 10% (w/v) ammonium per 
sulphate, 30111 TEMED and 14.75m1 Milli-Q water]. The casting of the gel was 
perfonned using the 'Protean II' apparatus (Bio-Rad, UK). The protein samples were 
mixed with sample buffer [1 % (w/v) bromophenol blue, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 3.1m1 of 
1M Tris-HCI pH 6.8, and made up to 10ml with Milli-Q water) and loaded on to the gel. 
The gel was run at 60mA fixed current for 6 hours using Tris-glycine running buffer 
(0.025M Tris-HCl & 0.192M glycine, pH8.3). 
2.2.3 Coomassie Brilliant blue gel staining 
Coomassie Brilliant blue (CBB) dye R250 is a blue dye commonly used to stain 
polyacrylamide gels (Meyer et al., 1965). Coomassie blue staining is based on the 
binding of the dye, which binds to all proteins (at charged basic amino acids; arginine, 
lysine and histidine) and gives a blue colour. The gel is soaked in a solution of the dye. 
Any dye that is not bound to protein diffuses out of the gel during the destain steps to 
remove the background. The destained gel is then ready for visualization of blue protein 
bands on a clear background. Most SDS and native gel separated proteins can be 
simultaneously fixed and stained in the same solution. Coomassie Brilliant blue R250 
staining is a cheap, convenient and effective means to detect protein bands with above 1 
microgram quantities of protein. 
The SDS and native PAGE gels were soaked in an adequate volume of Coomassie 
Brilliant blue R250 solution [0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant blue R250 in 10% (v/v) 
glacial acetic acid, 40% (v/v) methanol and 50% (v/v) Milli-Q water] for 3-4 hours in a 
rotating shaker. Then the gel was destained with destaining solution [10% (v/v) glacial 
acetic acid, 40% (v/v) methanol and 50% (v/v) Milli-Q water] in a rotating shaker until 
, the background became clear, changing the destaining solution several times. The 
destained gels were scanned using a Bio-Rad gel scanner and stored in 4% (v/v) glacial 
acetic acid solution. 
2.2.4 Colloidal Coomassie Brilliant blue staining 
Colloidal Coomassie staining of protein gels is more sensitive than the Coomassie 
staining method and commonly used for mass spectrometric analysis (Neuhoff et aI., 
1988). In this staining method, the Coomassie Brilliant blue 0250 stain is used in the 
presence of ammonium sulphate, orthophosphoric acid and ethanol. The binding of dye 
is mainly targeted to the proteins, thus the background reactions will be minimal. This 
method can detect as little as lOng of protein. There is no need for destaining the gel in 
this method but it could be just rinsed with water twice to remove the particulate 
materials from the surface. 
SDS-PAOE gels were soaked in an adequate volume of ready-made colloidal 
Coomassie Brilliant blue staining solution and incubated for 2 hours at room 
temperature in a rotating shaker. After 2 hours, gels were rinsed twice with water and 
the protein bands were visualized. 
2.2.5 Silver staining 
Silver staining is a highly sensitive method to identify even nanogram quantities of 
proteins in polyacrylamide gels. The soluble Ag+ ions of silver nitrate bind to amino 
acid residues of proteins and the acrylamide matrix. During subsequent development, 
fonnaldehyde acts as a reducing agent to reduce the soluble Ag+ ions into insoluble 
metallic silver that appears black (Swain et al., 1995). The crystallisation of silver ions 
on the gel surface most likely starts at higher Ag+ ion concentrations i.e. those 
sedimented onto proteins compared to the background. The sodium thiosulphate present 
in the sensitizing steps and some silver nitrate solutions keep the Ag + in solution and 
diminish unspecific staining of the background. Thus, only silver ions bound on to the 
protein bands will become dark while the background appears light. The initial fixation 
will fix the proteins in the gel and sensitization will make the proteins sensitive for 
binding to silver ions. 
SDS-PAGE gels were fixed in fixative solution [40% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) glacial 
acetic acid and 50% (v/v) Milli-Q water] for one hour in a rotating shaker. The gel was 
washed three times at 5 minute intervals with Milli-Q water and incubated in sensitizing 
solution [30% (v/v) ethanol, 0.2% (w/v) sodium thiosulphate and 6.8% (w/v) sodium 
acetate in Milli-Q water]. The gel was then washed three times at 10 minute intervals 
with Milli-Q water followed by incubation in 0.25% (w/v) silver nitrate solution in 
Milli-Q water for 20 minutes. The gel was washed twice at one minute intervals with 
Milli-Q water and developed with developing solution [2.5% (w/v) sodium carbonate 
and 0.04% (v/v) fonnaldehyde in Milli-Q water] for until the protein bands became 
clearly visible and before dark background developed. The developing reaction was 
stopped by placing the gel in stopping solution [1.46% (w/v) ethylene diamine 
tetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA.Na22H20) in Milli-Q water] for 5 minutes. The 
gel was washed twice at 5 minute intervals with Milli-Q water and the bands were 
examined by scanning the gel in a Bio-Rad gel scanner. 
2.3 Assays of enzyme activity 
To identify the specificity of various enzymes, synthetic amino acid derivatives coupled 
with colouring agents or fluorescent substrates were employed. The amino acid specific 
to the enzyme fonns a scissile bond with methylcownarin (a common fluorescent 
substrate in enzymatic assays) (Kanaoka et at., 1977). When enzymes are incubated 
with fluorescent substrates, they cleave this scissile bond and liberate the 
methylcownarin as a fluorescent product which can easily be detected using a 
fluorimeter. In the fluorimeter, light at the excitation wavelength is used to excite 
fluorescent molecules. The molecules' fluorescence can be detected at the wavelength 
of the emitting radiation. 
Aminopeptidase A, B and N activities were assayed using amino acyl 7-amido-4-
methylcownarin according to the method of Moriyama et at. (1983) and serine protease 
activity was measured using N-benzoyl-L-arginine 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin HCI 
(BAAMC) (Bicknell et at., 2001). The liberated methylcoumarin molecules were 
excited at the wavelength of 366nm and emission of fluorescence was detected at 
460nm using a Perkin-Elmer lwninometer. A control with buffer and fluorescent 
substrate was used to quantify the background fluorescence in the absence of enzymes.

2.4 Protein purification methods 
2.4.1 Gel filtration column chromatography 
The principle behind gel filtration (also called molecular sievel molecular exclusion 
size exclusion) chromatography is that porous gel beads entrap protein molecules which 
are smaller than their pore size leaving the other molecules to run through the column. 
Subsequently the small entrapped molecules will come out of the beads and migrate 
along with the buffer. The pore sizes of the gel beads depend on the nature and type of 
beads being used. In addition, in the vertical column, higher molecular weight 
molecules will move faster under gravity than small molecular weight molecules 
(Murthyet al., 1964). 
A pre-swelled Sephacryl HR 200 column was mixed with 0.02M Tris-HC pH 7.4 in the 
ratio of3:1 and poured evenly at once into a 16mm X 100cm column. The column was 
packed under a very high flow rate, i.e. 90ml1hr for 2 hours and 120ml1hr for 1 hour 
using a peristaltic pump. After packing without any air bubbles, the column was 
equilibrated in the same buffer for 48 hours at a flow rate of 20ml/hour. Another 
Superdex 75 column which was already available in the lab was also used in this study. 
The columns were calibrated with blue dextran and chymotrypsinogen supplied in the 
low molecular weight column calibration kit. After calibrating the columns, the protein 
samples made in 0.02M Tris-HC pH 7.4 were loaded into the column slowly without 
any air bubbles. 
2.4.2 Liquid phase isoelectric focusing (Rotofor) 
Isoelectric focusing is a technique generally used to separate proteins according to their 
native isoelectric points (PI) in an electric field with different pH gradients. When the 
protein reaches a pH identical to its pI, it will have no net charge and thus it will stop its 
migration. This technique is generally perfonned using immobilized pH gradient (IPG) 
strips (made up of polyacrylamide, starch or agarose and pH gradients by using 
aliphatic ampholytes) and thus it can be used on an SDS-PAGE gel to obtain the two 
dimensional separation patterns of proteins. The same can also be used in a liquid 
medium rather than using IPG strips to separate the proteins in liquid fonn for further 
use. This technique was introduced by Bio-Rad, UK with a fully assembled instrument 
called 'Rotofor'. In this, there is a separating chamber which has 10 isolated 
.. compartments each partitioned with dialysis membrane. The edges of this chamber are 
closed using cathode and anode membranes on either side and the pores at the bottom of 
the chamber are sealed with sealing tape. The protein samples mixed with the desired 
pH range ampholytes are loaded into the chamber through the pores on the top without 
introducing any air bubbles. When all the compartments are fully loaded these pores are 
sealed using sealing tape. This set-up is connected with electrode-containing buffer 
chambers on each side and then placed between rotating electrodes connected with a 
power pack. Both electrode buffer chambers are filled with anode and cathode buffer on 
each side and a programmed gradient power supply employed. Separation by the 
electric field starts in the rotating separation chamber and the rotation keeps the proteins 
in solution and prevents their precipitation. 
"" ,. 
The use of reducing agent dithiothreitol (OTT) helps to reduce and denature the proteins 
to allow better separation from complex mixtures but should be avoided if the proteins 
are to be used for activity assays after the separation. CHAPS is a zwitterionic detergent 
which binds on the surface of proteins and prevents precipitation during the 
accumulation of proteins at their net charge (called 'pI fallout'). Glycerol used in the 
sample buffer creates a protection seal around the hydrogen atoms of proteins and thus 
prevents aggregation. Urea and thiourea used in the sample buffer also maintain the 
proteins in solution during the separation. But when the proteins are required in active 
fonn without denaturation, all precautionary steps should be taken to reduce damage of 
the proteins. 
Three different types of rotofor chambers are available from Bio-Rad, UK according to 
the needs of researchers. (a) Microrotofor which can be used to separate proteins at 
micrograms to milligram concentrations in a total chamber volume of 3m. 
(b) Minirotofor which can be used to separate proteins at milligrams to gram 
concentrations in a total chamber volume of 18ml. ( c) Rotofor has a total chamber 
volume of 60ml to separate gram quantities of proteins. 
In this research, a microrotofor has been used for the separation of venom proteins. 2mg 
of crude venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros were mixed with denaturing rotofor buffer 
[1M urea, 2M thiourea, 1 % (w/v) CHAPS, 1 %(w/v) DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol and 2.5% 
(v/v) ampholytes (PI 3-10) in Milli-Q water], loaded on to the focusing chamber and run 
under cooling setting II (temperature between 15C and 25C) with the programmed 
electric field (150V/2W/20mA for 15 minutes, 200V/2W/20rnA for 15 minutes, 
300V/2W/20rnA for 20 minutes, 350V/2W/20mA for 20 minutes and 400V/2W/20mA 
for 60 minutes). O.IM orthophosphoric acid and O.IM sodium hydroxide were used as 
anode and cathode electrode buffers respectively. The separated fractions were analysed 
in 10% SOS-PAGE and assayed for activity. 
To collect larger amounts of desired fractions under non-denatured conditions, this 
experiment was repeated several times using non-denaturing rotofor buffer [7M urea, 
2M thiourea, 10% (v/v) glycerol and 2.5% (v/v) ampholytes (PI 6-8) in Milli-Q water] 
with cooling setting I (temperature between 4C and 15C) and with the same 
programmed electric field. The separated fractions were analysed in 10% SOS-P AGE 
and activity was measured for all fractions. 
2.4.3 Quantification of purified proteins 
Purified proteins can be quantified using several methods. We have used two methods 
in our research: Bradford protein assay (Bradford, 1976) and quantitative densitometry 
methods based on gel bands. The Bradford protein assay uses a Bradford reagent which 
is an acidic solution of Coomassie Brilliant blue G250. In the acidic environment of the 
reagent, protein binds to the Coomassie dye. This results in formation of blue colour 
from the reddishlbrown colour of the dye and the intensity of blue colour can be 
measured at 595nm using a spectrophotometer. Comparison of standards with protein 
samples of interest allows estimation of the amount of protein present in the sample. 
Quantitative densitometry analysis was performed using 'Quantity one' software (Bio-
Rad, UK). In this method, SOS-PAGE must be run with known concentrations of 
standard proteins along with the sample of interest. After staining, the gel is scanned 
using a densitometer and the concentration of sample is calculated by comparing the 
standard and sample proteins using 'Quantity one' software. 
Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a standard protein in both methods. 2mglml, 
.. lmg/ml, 0.5mg/ml, 0.25mg/m1, 0.125mg/m1 and 0.0625mg/m1 concentrations of BSA 
were used as standards for the Bradford protein assay. Duplicate samples containing 5J.11 
of standard, 10J.11 of protein to be determined or nothing (blank) were put into a 96-well 
plate. The volume of each well was made up to 800J.11 by adding Milli-Q water. 200J.11 of 
Bradford reagent (0.01 % of Coomassie Brilliant blue G250 in 50ml of ethanol, 100m 
of 85% phosphoric acid and made up to 1000mI with Milli-Q water) were added to each 
well and the plate was incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. The colour 
development was measured at 595nm in an Elisa plate reader. Standard curves were 
plotted to calculate the amount of protein present in the sample of interest. 
For quantitative densitometry, 100J.1g, 50J.1g, 25J.1g, 10J.1g, 5J.1g and 2.5J.1g concentrations 
ofBSA were treated with RSTB along with unknown concentrations of protein samples 
and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained using silver staining and scanned. 
The concentration of protein in samples was calculated using Quantity one software by 
comparing the intensity of sample with bands from various concentrations ofBSA. 
2.5 Immunological methods 
2.5.1 Antibody production 
Any foreign material entering an animal's circulatory system is considered as antigen 
[as it induces antibody production against this molecule]. The antigen induces the 
proliferation of lymphocytes (B-cells), that undergo clonal selection for each specific 
epitope (a specific structure which generate a type of antibodies) of antigen and 
extensive proliferation. Eventually most of the proliferated B-cells become plasma cells 
which in tum produce large quantities of specific antibodies against the antigen and a 
few proliferated B-cells become memory cells which record the antigen specificity in 
the system in order to develop a rapid immune response when the same antigen enters 
again into the system (Goldsby et al., 2002). The primary immune response usually 
reaches maximum production of antibodies within 7 days of antigen introduction but the 
secondary response will reach a maximum in just 2 days due to the presence of memory 
cells. For raising antibodies in e.g. rabbits, a small molecule called an adjuvant is used 
to expose the antigen effectively to the B-cells in the immune system for the production 
of antibodies. 
In this research, O.SmI of IOmglml concentration of purified protein was mixed with 
O.Sm1 of Freund's complete adjuvant and injected into a rabbit through sub-cutaneous 
(intra-muscular) injection. The rabbit was injected with a booster dose mixed with 
Freund's incomplete adjuvant at the same concentration after a week. A fortnight after 
the first injection SOmI of blood were collected by intravenous bleeding and allowed to 
stand for 20 minutes to completely clot the blood. The anti-serum was collected by 
centrifuging the blood clot. 
2.5.2 Western blotting 
Western blotting (Neal, 1981) is a technique used to immobilize the proteins separated 
by polyacrylamide gels on to a solid support such as nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene 
difluoride (PVDF) membrane. There are different methods of blotting: vacuum blotting 
and electro blotting. In the vacuum and electro blotting methods, the vacuum and 
~ electric field are used for the effective transfer of proteins from the gel to the semi-
permeable membrane where all the proteins will be sedimented as they cannot penetrate 
~ the membrane. The proteins are fixed by exposing the membrane to ultra violet (UV) 
light or heat and then used for further analysis. 
Following protein separation, the gel was removed from the glass cassettes and the 
stacking gel was carefully discarded. The resolving gel was sandwiched between PVDF 
membrane (pre-soaked in 100% methanol) and 12 sheets of3mm Whatmann filter paper 
cut to the size of the gel. The filter papers were pre-soaked in one of the following 
buffers; anode I [300mM Tris, 20% (v/v) methanol pHlO.4], anode II [25mM Tris, 20% 
(v/v) methanol pHlOA], or cathode [25mM Tris, 20% (v/v) methanol, 40mM 6-amino-
n-hexanoic acid, pH9A]. The gel, PVDF membrane and filter papers were placed, 
avoiding air bubbles, between the electrodes of semidry Western blotting apparatus 
(Bio-Rad) in the following order from the bottom anode electrode plate; 4 sheets of 
filter paper pre-soaked in anode I buffer, 2 sheets of filter paper pre-soaked in anode II 
buffer, PVDF membrane, resolved SDS-PAGE gel (a small cut is made in a comer to 
orient the gel), 6 sheets of filter paper pre-soaked in cathode buffer. The cassette was 
closed with the cathode electrode plate and a constant voltage of 15V was applied 
across the apparatus for two hours. 
2.5.3 Reversible staining of blotted membrane 
Ponceau S is a sodium salt of diazo reversible protein stain used to rapidly detect 
protein bands in nitrocellulose, PVDF and cellulose acetate membranes (Hassan et al., 
1987). This is an acidic, hydrophilic dye which can easily bind to proteins on the 
membrane surface and can be washed off with water. This dye is mainly used to detect 
protein transfer to the membranes before immunological detections. 
Western blotted PVDF membrane was immersed in a working concentration of Ponce au 
S solution [0.1 % (w/v) Ponceau S in 5% (v/v) acetic acid] for 3 to 5 minutes. The 
protein marker bands were marked with permanent marker pen on the membrane and 
the stain was washed off twice with Milli-Q water. 
2.5.4 Immuno blotting 
The proteins transferred on to the membrane can be detected using specific antibodies. 
The antibodies raised against a specific protein are called primary antibodies. The 
specific antibodies bind to the target protein and stringent washes remove the unbound 
and non-specifically bound Abs. Incubation with antibodies raised against the antibody 
Fc (constant framework) region conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HR.P) (Wilson et 
al., 1978) followed by addition of the HRP substrate diaminobenzamidine (DAB) 
produce a colour spot at places where the antigen-antibody binding occur. 
In this research, the membrane was washed 2 times in Tris buffered saline Tween 20 
{TBSn [20mM Tris, 137mM NaCI, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.6] and blocked with 
5% blocking buffer [5% (w/v) skimmed dried milk: in TBST] for 2 hours. The 
membrane was rinsed with TBST for 2 minutes and incubated with 1: 1000 dilution of 
anti-serum raised against specific antigen (or anti-serum pre-absorbed with specific 
quantity of antigen) in 5% blocking buffer overnight at 4C in a rotary shaker. The 
membrane was washed 3 times in TBST for one hour at 20 minute intervals by 
changing the TBST and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase 
(HRP) conjugate at 1: 2000 dilution for 2 hours at room temperature in a rotary shaker. 
After incubation, the membrane was washed 3 times in TBST for one hour at 20 minute 
intervals by changing the TBST and developed using a HRP substrate solution [0.05% 
(w/v) diaminobenzamidine (DAB) and 25J.11 of hydrogen peroxide (H20 2) in 100ml of 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS)]. The development was stopped by placing the 
membrane in Milli-Q water for a few minutes. 
2.5.5 Glycoprotein detection 
Glycoproteins can be detected by oxidising the carbohydrate moieties of a target protein 
with sodium metaperiodate to form aldehydes which can readily react with hydrazides 
(Murray et al., 1989). Biotin-X-hydrazide is used to attach biotin onto the oxidized 
carbohydrates of proteins. Terminal sialic acid residues are preferentially labelled by 
using a lower concentration of sodium metaperiodate and incubating in the dark. 
Biotinylated proteins are detected by addition of streptavidin conjugated to horseradish 
peroxidase for detection using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents 1 (luminal 
solution) and 2 (peroxide solution) (Whitehead et al., 1979). 
In this research, the proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane after separation by 
SDS-PAGE by semi-dry Western blotting as described previously. The standard 
protocol provided by GE Hea1thcare was used to detect glycoproteins. The membrane 
was soaked in 100% methanol followed by incubation in PBS for 10 minutes. The 
membrane was incubated in a solution of IOmM sodium metaperiodate dissolved in 
100mM acetate buffer (adjusted to pH 5.5 with glacial acetic acid) in the dark for 20 
minutes. The membrane was rinsed 2 times in PBS and then washed well with the same 
buffer three times at 10 minute intervals. Then the membrane was incubated in biotin 
hydrazide solution (4J11 ofO.l25mM biotin hydrazide in 20ml of 100mM acetate buffer, 
pH5.5) for one hour followed by incubation with 5% membrane blocking buffer [5% 
(w/v) skimmed dry milk in PBS] overnight at 4C. The membrane was washed in PBS 
three times at 10 minutes intervals followed by incubation in 20ml of streptavidin HRP 
(I :6000 dilution) conjugate solution in PBS for 30 minutes. The membrane was washed 
three times in PBS at 10 minute intervals followed by addition of the enhanced 
chemiluminescence detection system reagents (equally mixed 1 and 2). Signals were 
recorded and developed on a hyperfilm in a dark room at different time intervals. 
2.5.6 Deglycosylation of proteins 
Most eukaryotic proteins are glycosylated. There are two different types of 
glycosylation; N-glycosylation (most common one) in which the sugar units are added 
to the side chain amide group of certain asparagine residues of proteins and 0-
glycosylation in which the sugar units are added to the side chain hydroxyl group of 
certain serine and threonine residues of the proteins. Glycosylation mainly occurs 
during posttranslational modification of proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic 
reticulum. Glycosylation results in an increased molecular weight of the native protein, 
so to calculate the molecular weight of the amino acids alone, the sugar units need to 
removed. Complete deglycosylation can be performed using endoglycosidase enzymes 
such as N glycosidase. 
In this research, we have used 5 units of N Glycosidase F (gene from Flavobacterium 
~ meningosepticum and produced as recombinant from E.coli) from Roche Diagnostics 
Limited, UK. to deglycosylate 100J.lg of pure protein. The protein and enzyme were 
mixed in 0.02M Tris.CI pH 7.4 and the final volume was made up to 50J,11 with the same 
buffer. The mix was incubated at 37C for 10 hours. 5J,11 of sample were taken at 
different time intervals during incubation to check whether deglycosylation was 
complete using 10% SDS-PAGE. The deglycosylated proteins were run in reducing 
10% SDS-PAGE along with glycosylated pure protein and the molecular weight of the 
native protein was estimated. 
2.6 Protein sequencing methods 
2.6.1 Protein sequencing by MSIMS method 
MSIMS is a technique in which intact sample ions are deliberately broken apart by 
collision with an inert gas, usually argon, to gain structural infonnation from the 
fragment ions created. Usually the protein is digested with trypsin to make several 
smaller fragments which are purified using high perfonnance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) and subjected to mass collision. Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) allows 
peptides to be automatically selected for fragmentation by the software by recognition 
of the peptide's multiply charged states. The fragmented ions migrate according to their 
charged state and mass and can be identified using specific software. The resulting 
spectral data are searched using a mass spectrometry data base (MSDB) called Mascot 
(perkins et aI., 1999) to identify the related peptide fragments or proteins in the 
database. 
In this research, the purified proteins were separated by 10% SDS-P AGE and the gel 
was stained with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant blue G250. Stained bands corresponding 
to the protein to be sequenced were removed with a clean, sterile razor blade and cut 
into small pieces. They were carefully placed into small microfuge tubes and sent to M-
Scan Limited, Wokingham, UK to carry out mass spectrometric based sequencing. At 
M-Scan, the band was destained and the protein component was reduced, alkylated and 
subjected to tryptic digestion according to their protocols. The resulting peptides were 
extracted and analysed by nano LC-ES-MSIMS. Nano LC-ES-MSIMS was carried out 
on the sample using the following conditions: 
HPLC: Dionex Ultimate 3000 
Column: Dionex Pepmap C18, 15cm, 75J.1ll1 in Dia. 
Flow rate: 200nl1minute 
Column temperature: 30C 
UV detection: 214nm 
MS: Q-TOF (Quadrupole Time of Flight) 
Elution was carried out using 0.05% (aq) formic acid (solvent A) and 90% acetonitrile: 
.~ 10%,0.05% formic acid (solvent B) on the gradient described in table 2.1.

Table 2.1 The gradient levels of solvent B at different time intervals. 
Data-dependant acquisition was utilised and peptides eluting from the nano LC colmnn 
were automatically fragmented in the Q-TOF by recognition of their doubly or triply 
charged ion states. Preset charge and mass dependent collision voltages were applied by 
the software, which also allowed simultaneous MSIMS of up to 3 peptides. Processed 
spectral data were used to interrogate the MSDB database, housed locally, using 
MASCOT software. Several spectra were also checked manually in order to confirm 
automated peptide assignments. Glu-fibrinopeptide fragment ions in MSIMS mode were 
used to calibrate the instrument over the appropriate mass range. 
Similar analysis was perfonned at the Functional Genomics and Proteomics Unit, 
University of Binningham, UK with silver stained protein gel slices. 5 J.11 of trypsin 
digested samples were subjected to Q-TOF analysis in a Waters qTOF ULTIMA 
GLOBAL mass spectrometer which combines electro spray and MALDI (matrix 
assisted laser desorption/ionization) sample introduction with high sensitivity MS and 
MSIMS analysis of protein and peptide mixtures. The resulting mass spectrometric data 
were used to search the Mascot MS database. 
2.6.2 Sequencing by Edman degradation method 
Edman degradation method is a way of sequencing proteins from their N-terminal 
amino acids using a chemical called phenylisothiocyanate (pITC) (Edman, 1950; Niall, 
1971). Phenylisothiocyanate reacts with the uncharged tenninal amino group of a 
protein under mildly alkaline conditions to form a cyclical phenylthiocarbamoyl {PTC} 
derivative. Then, under acidic conditions, this is cleaved as a thiazolinone derivative. 
The thiazolinone amino acid is then selectively extracted into an organic solvent and 
treated with acid to form the more stable phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) amino acid 
derivative that can be identified by using chromatography or electrophoresis. This 
procedure can then be repeated to identify the next amino acid. A limitation of this 
technique is that the peptides sequenced cannot have more than 50 to 60 residues. This 
problem can be resolved by cleaving large peptides into smaller peptides before 
proceeding with the reaction. It is able to accurately sequence up to 30 amino acids with 
98% efficiency per amino acid. An advantage of Edman degradation is that it only uses 
10 - 100 picomoles of peptide for the sequencing process. 
Partial sequencing of the purified serine protease was carried out by Mr Antony Willis 
at the protein sequencing facility, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, 
UK. l00J.1g of purified protein were digested with trypsin and the resulting fragments 
were purified using high performance liquid chromatography. The purified fragments 
were reduced, alkylated and used in Edman reaction cycles and the corresponding 
sequence obtained. 
2.7 Molecular biological methods 
2.7.1 Venom gland extraction 
A pair of venom glands in the head of a snake is responsible for the production of 
venom. The venom is stored in the venom duct and delivered during the bite through the 
orifice present in the fangs into the host system. Venom glands contain the genes 
responsible for the venom enzymes. In order to get the complementary DNA (cDNA) 
corresponding to a protein present in the venom, the messenger RNA (mRNA) 
transcribed from the target gene is isolated. The extraction of venom glands during 
maximal expression of genes yields a high quantity of mRNA. 
Venom was extracted from Bitis gabonica rhinoceros LZ7 (from Nigeria) in the 
herpetarium at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the snake was left for 3 
days for maximal expression of venom gland genes. On the fourth day, the snake was 
sacrificed and the pair of venom glands carefully removed without any other muscles by 
Dr Robert Harrison (Head of the Unit of Venom Research). The venom glands were 
frozen in liquid nitrogen. The glands were processed into a fine powder in a pestle and 
mortar using an adequate volume of liquid nitrogen. The powder was stored in liquid 
nitrogen until further use. 
2.7.2 Total RNA purification from the venom gland 
When the celVtissue is broken, its contents are released. These are mainly DNA, total 
RNA [messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA)] 
and proteins. Total RNA is isolated by removing DNA and protein molecules using 
specific reagents. TRI REAGENfrM is an effective chemical reagent used for the 
separation of RNA, DNA and protein in three different phases (Chomczynski et al., 
1987). Chloroform is mainly used to remove the lipid molecules and traces of phenol 
used to remove the proteins. Diethylpyrocorbonate (DEPC) is a potent inactivator of 
RNase which is used to wash the glass-ware and other equipment used for the RNA 
purification. As the RNA is a single stranded fragile nucleic acid, it must be handled 
with care throughout the experiment. 
100mg of ground venom gland tissue were removed from the liquid nitrogen and 
thawed until the last trace of liquid had disappeared. 2ml of 100% (v/v) TRI 
REAGEN'fIM were added to the tissues and homogenized well, and divided into 4 
different diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated l.5ml microfuge tubes. The tubes were 
allowed to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature to ensure the complete dissociation 
of nucleoprotein complexes. After 5 minutes incubation, 100Jll of 100% (v/v) 
chloroform were added to each tube; they were then shaken vigorously, and incubated at 
room temperature for 15 minutes. The tubes were centrifuged at 12,00Oxg for 15 
minutes at 4C. The resulting mixture has 3 phases; a red organic phase containing 
protein at the bottom, an interphase containing DNA in the middle and a clear phase 
containing RNA at the top. The upper aqueous layer containing RNA was transferred to 
another DEPC-treated microfuge tube without disturbing the remaining DNA and 
protein phases. Iml of 100% (v/v) isopropanol was added to the extracted RNA layer, 
mixed well and allowed to stand for 10 minutes at room temperature. The tubes were 
centrifuged at 12,OOOxg for 10 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was carefully removed 
and the RNA pellet was washed with 2m1 of 75% (v/v) ethanol. The pellet was mixed 
well using a vortex and centrifuged at 7,500xg for 5 minutes at 4C. The supernatant 
was removed, the pellet was air dried for 5 minutes and dissolved in DEPC treated 
Milli-Q water. The resultant RNA was quantified using a NanoDropTM 
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). 
2.7.3 mRNA purification 
The mature processed full length mRNA transcribed from a gene will be polyadenylated 
(poly-A tail) at the 3' end for stability during translation. This poly-A tail can be used to 
purify the mRNA from total RNA using an oligo-deoxy thymidine (oligo-dT) column 
(Okayama et al., 1987). An oligo-dT column is made up of cellulose beads covalently 
conjugated with oligo-dT nucleotides. When the total RNA passes through this column, 
the poly-A tail of mature mRNA binds to the oligo-dT column and the remaining 
molecules move through the column without binding. A high salt buffer solution breaks 
the bonds between the poly-A tail and oligo-dT in the column and removes the mature 
mRNA, which can then be collected in pure form. 
The mRNA was purified from the total RNA isolated from the venom gland tissues 
using an oligo-dT cellulose column (Okayama et al., 1987). The column was 
centrifuged at 3S0xg several times to resuspend the cellulose well before the 
purification step. The top and bottom caps were removed from the column, it was 
placed in a ISml falcon tube and the storage buffer was allowed to drain. Iml of high 
salt buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, ImM EDTA and O.SM NaCI) was added to the 
column; it was left to drain and this step was repeated. The falcon tube was emptied and 
the column was put back into the tube. The total RNA (440J.1g) was dissolved in Iml of 
6SoC pre-warmed elution buffer (10mM Tris-HCI pH 7.4 and ImM EDTA) and the 
sample was heated for 5 minutes at 6SOC to dissolve the RNA completely. The sample 
was placed on ice, 200J.11 of sample buffer (IOmM Tris-HCI pH 7.4, ImM EDTA and 
3M NaCI) were added and mixed gently. The sample was applied on top of the cellulose 
column and allowed to move inside the column bed. The column was then centrifuged 
for 2 minutes at 3SOxg. 2S0J.11 of high salt buffer were added followed by centrifuging at 
3SOxg for 2 minutes. This step was repeated with another 250J.11 of high salt buffer. The 
column was washed three times with 2S0J.11 of low salt buffer (IOmM Tris-HCI pH 7.4, 
ImM EDTA and O.lM NaCI) by centrifuging at 350xg for 2 minutes. The column was 
placed into another DEPE treated lSml falcon tube and washed four times with 2S0J.11 of 
6SoC pre-warmed elution buffer by centrifuging at 350xg for 2 minutes. The mRNA 
preparation was placed on ice and quantified using a NanoDrop'Thl spectrophotometer 
(Thenno Scientific, USA). The mRNA was mixed with I00J.11 of sample buffer, 10J.11 of 
glycogen (lOmglml) and 2.5ml ofice-cold 100% (v/v) ethanol and stored at -80C until 
required. 
2.7.4 eDNA synthesis 
Complementary DNA is synthesised by copying the information from mRNA into DNA 
by reverse transcription. The poly-A tail present in mature mRNA at the 3 'end is used 
as a tool to anneal the oligo-dT primers. The reverse transcriptase enzyme continues 
synthesising the first strand of cDNA by using the oligo-dT primer and mRNA as 
template. After the complete synthesis of the first strand of cDNA, the second strand is 
synthesised by cleaving the mRNA in the mRNA:cDNA duplex using the enzyme 
RNase H and nick translation by DNA polymerase I to complete the synthesis of the 
second strand of cDNA (Gubler et aI., 1983). The double stranded cDNA is stable and 
can be used for further analysis. 
The cDNA of the Bitis gabonica rhinoceros venom gland was synthesized using the 
cDNA synthesis kit from Stratagene, USA (Gubler et aI., 1983). Iml of stored mRNA 
was centrifuged at 13,OOOxg for 10 minutes at 4C. The pellet was air dried and 
dissolved in 37J11 of DEPC treated Milli-Q water. The mRNA was quantified using a 
NanoDrop'Thl spectrophotometer. To the 36J11 of mRNA (12J1g) in DEPC water, 5J11 of 
lOX first strand buffer, 3J11 of first strand methyl nucleotide mix (10 mM dATP, dGTP, 
and dTfP plus 5 mM 5-methyl dCTP), 2J11 of linker primer (1.4J.glJ1l) and 1 J11 of 
RNAse block ribonuclease inhibitor (40U/J1I) were added. The contents were mixed 
well and the primer allowed to anneal for 10 minutes at room temperature. 3 J11 of 
AccuscriptTM reverse transcriptase were added to the first strand synthesis mix and the 
reaction volume made up to 50J11. The contents were mixed well and incubated at 42C 
in a water bath for one hour. The mix was kept on ice after incubation. The following 
components were added to the above first strand cDNA mix to make the second strand 
cDNA; 20J11 of lOX second strand buffer, 6J11 of second strand dNTP mixture (10 mM 
dATP, dGTP, and dTfP plus 26 mM dCTP), 114J.1 of sterile Milli-Q water, 2J11 of 
RNase H (1.5U/J11) and IIJ11 of DNA polymerase I (9U/J1I). These were mixed gently 
and centrifuged for a few seconds at 1300Oxg. The mix was incubated at 16C in a 
water bath for 2.5 hours. The tubes were placed on ice after incubation and the double 
stranded cDNA was quantified using a NanoDropTM spectrophotometer (Thermo 
Scientific, USA). 
2.7.5 peR amplification 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a well known technique for rapid amplification of a 
desired segment of DNA into multiple copies using specific primers and thermo tolerant 
DNA polymerase (Mullis, 1990; Saiki, 1985). The DNA polymerase from thermo 
tolerant bacteria Thermus aquaticus (Taq DNA polymerase) has enabled the PCR 
experiments due to its thermo tolerant properties. This amplifies a template DNA in the 
presence of specific flanking primers, deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), and 
magnesium chloride (MgCh)-containing reaction buffer. There are 3 important steps in 
PCR: denaturation at 94C to denature the double stranded DNA into single stranded 
DNA to help the binding of primers, an annealing step to allow the primers to anneal 
with the template DNA and a polymerisation step at 72C where the Taq DNA 
polymerase synthesises the DNA based on the template DNA. 
Specific primers were designed to amplify target genes in the Bitis gabonica rhinoceros 
venom gland cDNA, and were synthesized by Sigma Aldrich, UK. IJ.11 (equivalent to 
200nM) of forward and 1 J.11 (equivalent to 200nM) of reverse primers were used to 
amplify 5J.1g of venom gland cDNA along with IJ.11 of25mM dNTPs, 3J.11 of7.5mM 
MgCh, 0.25J.11 (1.25 units) of GoTaq DNA polymerase (without any proof reading 
activity), 1OJ.11 of PCR buffer (50mM KCI and 10mM Tris-HCI pH 8.4) and the final 
reaction volume was made upto 50 J.11 using Milli-Q water provided with the Promega 
amplification kit. Positive (provided with kit) and negative controls were amplified 
along with the sample amplification mix. A Perkin-Elmer thennal cycler was set up for 
20 or 35 cycles with the following temperature settings; initial denaturation at 94C for 
5 minutes, denaturation at 94C for 30 seconds, annealing at 54C for 30 seconds, 
polymerisation at 72C for 3.5 minutes, final polymerisation at 72C for 10 minutes and 
final hold at 4C. 
2.7.6 Agarose gel electrophoresis 
Agarose gel electrophoresis is a simple technique to separate DNA molecules in 
solidified agarose gel under a constant electric field (Seese et al., 1968). The melting 
and cooling of the agarose fine powder in a buffer solidifies the agarose to form a clear 
gel. Loading of the DNA sample in the well created at the top of the gel followed by 
running under an electric field separates the DNA according to molecular weight, as the 
low molecular weight DNA molecules will move faster than the higher molecular 
weight ones. DNA-interchelating dye-ethidium bromide (added to the gel) will bind to 
DNA and fluoresce during exposure to UV light. Bromophenol blue and xylene xyanol 
FF, two dyes present in the DNA sample loading buffer indicate the movement of low 
and high molecular weight DNA respectively in the gel. 
The required percentage ofagarose was prepared (Sambrook et aI., 2001) in Tris-acetate 
EDTA (TAE) buffer pH7.7 [40mM Tris-acetate, ImM EDTAl, melted by heating in a 
water bath, cooled to around 45C and ethidium bromide at a concentration of 0.5 J.1g1ml 
was added. The gel was mixed well and poured on to the gel plate (the edges sealed 
with sealing tape) and a well-creating comb placed at the top. Prior to loading, 5J.11 of 
samples were mixed with 1,.11 of DNA loading buffer [0.25% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 
0.25% xylene xyanol FF and 20% (w/v) sucrose in TAE]. Electrophoresis was 
performed at 50V in T AE buffer for one hour. Separated DNA fragments were 
visualized under ultraviolet light using a UV long wave transilluminator. Preparative 
agarose gels were prepared in the same way but with larger sample loading wells to 
accommodate a larger volume of samples and run for 1.5 hours at constant voltage 
(IOOV) in TAE buffer. 
2.7.7 DNA elution from agarose gel slices 
Purified DNA for further analysis can be obtained by eluting the separated DNA from 
the agarose gels. The Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System are designed 
specifically to extract the DNA from agarose gels and PCRs. The agarose gel slices 
containing the target DNA must be dissolved by heating in membrane binding solution 
and passed through the mini DNA binding membrane column where the DNA adheres 
to the column and residual particles pass through during washing steps. Finally the 
DNA can be eluted from the column by passing through nuclease-free water. This is a 
rapid procedure to isolate the DNA from gel slices in IS minutes and recovery of up to 
95% can be achieved. 
The target DNA from the gel slices was eluted using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up 
System from Promega, UK. IOmg of gel slices and 10J.11 of membrane binding solution 
(4.5M guanidine isothiocyanate and 0.5M potassium acetate pH 5) were mixed well by 
vortexing and incubated at 65C until the gel slices were completely dissolved. A SV 
mini column was inserted into a collection tube and the dissolved gel solution was 
transferred to the column and centrifuged at 16,000xg for I minute. The flow-through 
was discarded and the column was re-inserted into the collection tube. 700J.11 of 
membrane wash solution [10mM Potassium acetate pH 5, 80% absolute ethanol {to be 
added prior to use) and 16.7J1M EDTA pH 8] were added to the column and centrifuged 
at 16,OOOxg for a minute and the flow through discarded. Another 500JlI of membrane 
wash solution were added and the column was washed twice as above. The flow 
through was discarded again and the column was centrifuged again for a minute to 
allow the evaporation of residual ethanol in the column. The column was then placed in 
a sterile l.5ml microfuge tube and 50J.1I of nuclease free water were added right in the 
middle of the column material. This was incubated for a minute at room temperature 
and centrifuged at 16000xg for a minute. The column was discarded and the DNA was 
stored at -80C until further use. 
2.7.8 TOPO TA cloning of eluted DNA 
Taq DNA polymerase has a non template-dependent terminal transferase activity that 
adds a single deoxyadenosine (A) to the 3' ends of PCR products. The linearized TOPO 
vector supplied with the TOPO T A cloning kit has single overhanging 3 ' 
deoxythymidine (T) residues. This allows PCR inserts to ligate efficiently with the 
vector. Topoisomerase I from Vaccinia virus binds (in one strand) to duplex DNA at 
connecting sites and cleaves the phosphodiester backbone after the 5'-CCCTI of the 
TOPO vector (Shuman, 1991). The energy from the broken phosphodiester backbone is 
conserved by formation of a covalent bond between the 3' phosphate of the cleaved 
strand and a tyrosyl residue at position 274 of topoisomerase I. This bond is 
subsequently attacked by the 5' hydroxyl of the original cleaved strand, reversing the 
reaction and releasing topoisomerase (Shuman, 1994) and thus a backbone will be 
fonned between the vector and a PCR product. The recombinant vectors are 
transfonned into E. coli cells and non-recombinant and recombinant colonies selected 
based on blue and white colour using 5-bromo 4-chloro 3-indolyl B-D-
galactopyranoside (X-gal). 
The gel-eluted PCR amplified products were cloned into a TOPO T A cloning vector 
system (Invitrogen, USA), specifically designed to clone the PCR amplified products. 
3J.1I of the eluted DNA (60ng) were put into a microfuge tube. I J.1I of salt solution (1.2M 
NaCI and 60mM MgCh), 1 JlI of sterile water and 1 J.1l (I JIg) of TOPO vector provided 
with the kit were added. The contents were mixed gently and incubated for 5 minutes at 
room temperature and the tube placed on ice. A vial of TOP 10 E. coli cells (50,.d) was 
thawed on ice. The ligated DNA contents were added to the E. coli cells and mixed well 
and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. The cells were heat-shocked at 420C 
for 30 seconds without shaking and placed on ice immediately. 250,.d of room 
temperature SOC (super optimal catabolism repressive medium, widely used for E. coli 
growth) medium were added to tube and the cells incubated at 37C for one hour with 
vigorous shaking. The culture was centrifuged at 13,OOOxg for 2 minutes and the 
supernatant was removed and the final volume of cells made upto lOOJ,11 by 
resuspension. 20J,11 and 80J,11 of cells were spread on to pre-warmed X-gal and 50J,1g/ml 
ampicillin containing 2 individual LB agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37C 
overnight and blue and white colonies were identified the next day. 
2.7.9 Plasmid isolation from recombinant colonies 
Plasmid DNA isolation is done by using the alkaline lysis method (Sambrook et aI., 
2001). In this method, a lysis buffer containing sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium 
dodecyl sulphate (SDS) to lyse the cell wall and membrane respectively is added to the 
medium. Then the higher molecular weight DNA is precipitated using salt and proteins 
are removed by phenol extraction. Then the plasmid DNA is purified by further 
precipitation steps. The QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, UK) operates with the 
same principle but avoiding the plasmid precipitation using salts. Instead they have 
designed QIAprep spin columns containing a unique silica gel membrane that can bind 
up to 20J,1g of DNA in the presence of a high concentration of chaotropic salt, and allow 
elution in a small volume of low-salt buffer. QIAprep membrane technology eliminates 
time consmning phenol: chloroform extraction, alcohol precipitation and salt 
concentration. 
Plasmid DNAs from the selected recombinant white colonies were isolated using the 
QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, UK) with the standard protocol provided. A single 
well isolated recombinant colony was used to inoculate 3ml of LB (Lysogeny broth or 
Luria broth or Luria-Bertani broth is a widely used nutritionally rich bacterial growth 
medium) broth containing 50J,1g/ml ampicillin. The inoculated medium was incubated at 
37C for 9 hours for optimal growth with shaking at 300rpm in a shaking incubator. The 
cells were pelleted by centrifuging at 13,OOOxg for 3 minutes. The cells were 
resuspended in 250~1 of buffer PI (50mM Glucose, 25mM Tris.Cl pH 8 and 10mM 
EDTA pH 8) and transferred to another clean microfuge tube. 250~1 of buffer P2 (0.2N 
NaOH and 1 % SDS) were added and mixed thoroughly by inverting the tubes 4-6 times. 
350~1 of buffer N3 [5M potassium acetate and 11.5% (v/v) glacial acetic acid] were 
added and mixed well immediately. The contents were centrifuged at 13,000xg for 10 
minutes. The supernatant was transferred to a QIQprep spin column and centrifuged for 
1 minute at 13,OOOxg. The flow-through was discarded and the column was washed by 
adding 750~1 of buffer PE and centrifuging for 1 minute. The flow through was 
discarded and the column was centrifuged for 1 minute at the same speed to remove the 
residual wash buffer. The column was placed in a clean and sterile 1.5ml microfuge 
tube, 50~1 of sterile water were added at the centre of the column and the column was 
incubated for 1 minute at room temperature. The column was centrifuged for 1 minute 
at the same speed and the eluted DNA was quantified and stored at -80C until further 
2.7.10 Restriction digestion to confirm the insert DNA in recombinant 
pJasmids 
Digestion of DNA using restriction enzymes cuts the DNA at the specific recognition 
sites corresponding to the enzymes. Cloning vectors contain multi cloning sites (MCS) 
which have a number of enzyme recognition sites to facilitate the insertion of target 
DNA at these sites. To confirm the presence of insert DNA in the MeS, restriction 
enzymes whose recognition sites are present on both sides of the insert DNA are used to 
digest the vector and release the insert DNA. Analysis of digested DNA in the agarose 
gel shows the inserted DNA band at the known molecular weight along with linearized 
vector DNA while a non-recombinant vector would show only linearized plasmid DNA. 
EcoRI restriction digestion was used to release the inserted DNA from the recombinant 
TOPO plasmids to confirm the correct insertion of target DNA. 5~1 of each plasmid 
DNA with various concentrations were mixed with 15~1 of EcoRI master mix 
[containing 2~1 of buffer H, 12.5~1 of water and 0.5~1 (6U) ofEcoRI] and incubated at 
37C for 3 hours. The digested products were run using 1 % (w/v) agarose gel 
electrophoresis and the separated DNA bands were visualized under a UV 
transilluminator. 
2.8 DNA sequencing method 
The insert confinned recombinant plasmids were sent to Cogenics Limited, Essex, UK 
for sequencing using M13 forward and reverse primers whose sites are present either 
side of the MCS in the TOPO TA vector. For longer sequences, the gel eluted amplified 
product was sent to Cogenics Limited for sequencing using the specific primers 
designed for amplification and by using primer walking methods. Primer walking is a 
technique by which long DNA sequences can be sequenced by designing primers for 
both ends, sequencing partially and repeating the process until the complete sequence is 
obtained. 
2.9 CrystaIlisation and preliminary data collection 
Crystallisation is a method by which macromolecules aggregate in a regular repetitive 
pattern to form crystals. This is essential for obtaining structural infOlmation using x-
ray diffiaction analysis. There are several methods of crystallisation of which the most 
common are hanging drop, sitting drop and sandwich drop methods (Mccoy, 1999). In 
any of these methods, the protein at a concentration usually above IOmglml is dropped 
on a glass support along with a drop of crystallising buffer at an appropriate pH along 
with salt and other crystallising agents. The crystallising buffer creates a crystallising 
atmosphere for the protein. Screening using a large number of conditions is used to find 
the best conditions for crystallising a particular protein. 
Hanging drop crystallisation trials were set up using Wizard I and II, Macrosol I and II 
and SFS I and II crystallisation trial kits. 400J.11 of each of the crystallising solutions 
from the commercial kits were added to the individual wells in 24-well trays and they 
were left for 2 hours to equilibrate the well atmosphere. 2,.11 of the appropriate 
crystallizing solution and 2J.11 of purified protein (at specific concentration for each 
protein) were added to each coverslip. The coverslips were placed on top of the 
reservoir chambers with the crystallisation drop facing the reservoir solution. Vacuum 
grease was placed around the top of the well to produce a sealant. Micro crystals 
obtained in the preliminary screenings were used for micro seeding (seed a new protein 
drop with crushed micro crystals using a thin wire) methods to obtain larger crystals. 
Crystals were taken for preliminary data collection at European Synchrotron Radiation 
Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, Germany by Dr Kim Watson, University of Reading. 
2.10 Bioinformatics analysis 
The following standard bioinfonnatics tools were used for analysis of nucleotide and 
protein sequence data. 
Nucleotide sequences were translated using DNA STAR Lasergene version 7 (Burland, 
2000). 
BLAST (Basic local alignment search tool) (Altschul et al., 1990) was used to identify 
similar sequences in the NCBI (National Centre for Biological Infonnation) database. 
Multiple sequence alignments were perfonned using the ClustalW2 multiple sequence 
alignment tool (Larkin et a1., 2007) with default parameters of KTUP, gap opening 
penalty and gap extension penalty. Alignment files were viewed using the BioEdit 
multiple sequence editor tool (Hall, 1997). The pairwise alignments were performed 
using EMBOSS (the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite) pairwise 
alignment algorithms (Smith et aI., 198 I) to calculate the percentage of identities 
between sequences. 
Sites for post-translational modifications in protein sequences were predicted using a 
number of web-based tools. NetNGlyc (Blom et aI., 2004) was used to predict N-
glycosylation sites. These are predicted according to the presence of the sequence Asn-
X-Serf Thr. O-glycosylation sites were predicted using NetOGlyc (Julenius, 2005), 
which identifies sites according to the presence of Ser or Thr associated with mucin 
type GalNac. Potential serine, threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites were 
predicted using the neural network-based NetPhos (Blom, 1999), which identify the 
phosphorylation sites based on the substrate specificity of protein kinase. 
Phylogenetic analysis was perfonned using various tree-constructing methods. The 
alignment file generated using ClustalW2 was submitted to PhyIip-Protdist (Felsenstein, 
1989) to create the distance matrix. This was submitted to a number of tree-generating 
tools such as Phylip-BIONJ (Gascuel, 1997), Phylip-Fitch (Felsenstein, 1989), Phylip-
Neighbor (Felsenstein, 1989), Phylip-Weighbour (Bruno et aI., 2000), PhyIip-Quick tree 
(Howe et al., 2002), Phylip-Protpars (Felsenstein, 1989) and Tree puzzle (Schmidt et 
~ al., 2002). Trees were visualised using Phylodendron (Gilbert, 1996). 
Functional domains in proteins were identified using InterProScan (Quevillon et al., 
2005) and SMART (simple modular architecture research tool) (Schultz et al., 1998) 
programs. 
Model structures of proteins were generated using SWISS-MODEL operating in 
automated mode (Schwede et al., 2003) and visualised using Swiss PDB Viewer (Guex 
et al., 1997) and Protein Explorer (Martz, 2002). The Ramachandran plot for the 
modelled structure was calculated using Swiss PDB Viewer. Models were 
superimposed on their templates and the RMS deviations calculated using the magic 
and improved fit modes in Swiss PDB Viewer.

3.1 Introduction 
Snake venoms are rich sources of a variety of enzymes which affect the circulatory 
system of their victim and prey. Several endoproteases such as serine proteases and 
metallo endoproteases are found in venoms but only a few exopeptidases have been 
discovered. The exopeptidases are further classified into 2 groups based on their site of 
action; aminopeptidases (act at amino terminal of the protein) and carboxypeptidases 
(act at carboxy terminal of proteins). The aminopeptidases are named according to their 
specificities. Aminopeptidase N (APN) specifically cleaves N-terminal neutral amino 
acids, aminopeptidase A (AP A) cleaves N-terminal acidic amino acids, aminopeptidase 
B (APB) cleaves N-terminal basic amino acids, aminopeptidase M (APM) cleaves N-
terminal methionine and aminopeptidase L (APL) cleaves N-terminal leucines (Ogawa 
et al., 2006). There are also dipeptidyl peptidases (DPP) which cleave terminal 
dipeptides. All these exopeptidases are Zn-dependent metallopeptidases as they contain 
a well coordinated Zn atom at the centre of protein, coordinated by zinc binding amino 
acids (histidine 393, histidine 397 and another specific amino acid) present in the zinc 
binding motif i.e. HEXXH+ X, where X is any amino acid (Rawlings & Barrett, 1995). 
The exopeptidases share a common zinc binding motif i.e. HEXXH but some enzymes 
contain an additional zinc binding amino acid. Rawlings & Barrett (1995) have 
classified Zn-dependant metalloproteases based on their zinc-binding ligands. 
According to Rawlings & Barrett (1995), APN, APA and APB belong to the FI family 
ofmetallopeptidases and the group ofHEXXH+E containing metallopeptidases, which 
contain glutamate as a third zinc binding amino acid 18 amino acids C-tenninal to the 
HEXXH zinc binding motif. Even though DPP IV belongs to the group of HEXXH+E 
containing metallopeptidases, it is included in the F2 family of metallopeptidases. APL 
belongs to the FI7 family of metallopeptidases and APM belongs to the F24 family of 
metallopeptidases. Both APL and APM belong to the group of HEXXH+ 
metalloproteases which contain an unknown metal ligand. Thus APN, AP A, APB and 
DPP N belong to the superfamily of 'gluzincins' as they include a glutamate as a zinc 
binding amino acid in their zinc binding motif (Hooper, 1994). The detailed 
explanations for the classification, clans, families, subfamilies and groups of metallo 
exopeptidases were described in section 1.4 of the introduction. 
Peptidase activity has been demonstrated in the venoms of several viperidae and 
elapidae snakes, such as Gloydius halys blomhofJi and Bungarus multicinctus (Murata et 
al., 1963). Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), aminopeptidase N (APN) and 
aminopeptidase B (APB) activities have been found in several viperidae and elapidae 
snakes such as Naja naja, Crotalus durissus terrificus, Bothrops jararaca and Bungarus 
multicinctus (Faiz et al., 1996). DPP IV activity alone has been detected in the venoms 
of Gloydius halys blomhoffii, Gloydius blomhoffi brevicaudus, Trimeresurus 
j1avoviridis and Crotalus atrox (Ogawa et al., 2006). AP A activity was found in the 
venoms of Bitis arietans (Gasparello et al., 2002), Gloydius blomhoffi brevicaudus, 
Gloydius halys blomhoffi, Trimeresurus j1avoviridis and Bothrops jararaca (Ogawa et 
al.,2007). 
The only known primary structure of AP A in snakes was obtained from Gloydius 
blomhoffi brevicaudus by cDNA cloning and sequencing. The molecular weight of this 
enzyme was found to be 1 IOkDa according to the sequence and I70kDa based on the 
mature protein in reducing SDS-P AGE. This enzyme was predicted to have 17 N-
glycosylation sites. This enzyme has also been purified and characterised (Ogawa et al., 
2007). 
Ji. ,,,..-
This chapter describes the identification of a novel aminopeptidase in the venom of Bids 
gabonica rhinoceros. The enzyme has been purified and characterised. A partial amino 
acid sequence was obtained using mass spectrometry methods and the complete 
sequence was obtained after constructing and amplifying a venom gland cDNA library. 
Sequence alignment tools were used to compare the sequence with related 
aminopeptidase sequences. Crystals have been successfully grown and preliminary x-
ray crystallography has been carried out. 
3.2 Methods 
3.2.1 Protein profiles of venom of Bids gabonica rhinoceros 
Samples of crude venom from Bitis gabonica rhinoceros were prepared in different 
quantities such as 50J.lg, 25J.lg, etc. by serially diluting in RSTB (reducing sample 
treatment buffer) and separated by SDS-PAGE as described in chapter 2. 
3.2.2 Purification of rhiminopeptidase 
50mg of crude venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros were dissolved in 2ml of O.02M 
Tris.CI pH 7.4 and loaded onto a Sephacryl HR 200 gel filtration column. 3ml fractions 
were collected using O.02M Tris.CI pH 7.4 at a speed of Imllminute after 40ml of pre-
elution. lOOJ.lI of randomly chosen fractions were used for SOS and native-PAGE 
analysis. The desired fractions were concentrated using Vivaspin IOOlcDa cut off 
concentrating filters. The purified protein was quantified using the Bradford method 
f (Bradford, 1976). 20J.lg of pure protein were run in 10% SOS-PAGE along with 
molecular weight markers and silver stained to show the purity of the protein. 
3.2.3 Partial sequencing by mass spectrometry 
A colloidal coomassie stained reduced SOS-polyacrylamide gel band obtained from 
10J.lg of pure rhiminopeptidase was sliced into small pieces and sent to M-Scan Limited, 
Wokingham, UK. for mass spectrometric analysis and de novo sequencing as described 
in chapter 2. 
3.2.4 Functional characterisation of rhiminopeptidase 
Aminopeptidase activity was assayed using specific arninoacyl 7-amid0-4-
methylcoumarin (X-AMC, X-specific amino acid) according to the method of 
Moriyama et al. (1983) and Ogawa et al. (2007). Leucyl AMC [Sigma Aldrich (SA) 
code-L2145], arginine AMC (SA code-A2027) and alanine AMC (SA code-A4302) 
were dissolved in DMSO and glutamyl AMC (Bachem code-IlI85) was dissolved in 
o1f 0.02M Tris.CI pH 7.4 to prepare stock 20mM substrate solutions. Various quantities 
such as lOOllg, 7Sllg, SOIlg, 2Sllg, 10Ilg and Sllg of venom or purified protein were 
mixed with each of the substrate solutions at a final concentration of SOnM. The 
reaction volume was made up to 200111 using 20mM Tris.CI pH 7.4. A control 
containing no enzyme was also run. The reaction mixes were incubated at 37C for one 
hour and the fluorescence was measured in a Perkin-Elmer fluorometer using an 
excitation wavelength of366nm and an emission wavelength of 460run. 
3.2.5 Glycosylation detection and deglycosylation ofrhiminopeptidase 
To identify whether rhiminopeptidase is a glycosylated protein, 20f,lg of pure protein 
were run in 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane by semi-
dry western blotting and used for glycosylation detection as described in section 2. 
lOOllg of pure rhiminopeptidase in 0.02M Tris.CI pH 7.4 were mixed with S units ofN 
Glycosidase F enzyme and the reaction volume was made up to SOlll with the same 
buffer. The reaction mix was incubated for 10 hours at 37C. 20f,lg of deglycosylated 
protein were run in 1 ()o1o SDS-PAGE along with 20f,lg of glycosylated protein and 
protein molecular weight markers. The gel was transferred to a PVOF membrane and 
used for glycosylation detection as described in chapter 2. 
3.2.6 Anti-rhiminopeptidase antibody production 
O.Sml (SOOllg) of purified rhiminopeptidase were mixed with O.Sml of Freund's 
complete adjuvant and used for immunizing a rabbit. The booster dose was given by 
mixing the same amount of rhiminopeptidase with the same volume of Freund's 
incomplete adjuvant 2 weeks after the first immunisation. The anti-serum was collected 
2 weeks after the second immunisation and used to detect the pure rhiminopeptidase and 
other cross reacting proteins present in the rotofor fractions (PI 5-7) of Bitis gabonica 
rhinoceros and other poisonous snake venoms as described in chapter 2. In a further 
experiment, 6J.ll (enough volume to make 30m.l of 1 :5000 diluted anti-serum for western 
blotting) of anti-serum were pre-absorbed with 200 Ilg of pure rhiminopeptidase by 
incubating in a rotating shaker for I hour at room temperature. The volume of reaction 
mix was made up to Iml using 5% blocking buffer in order to maximise the fonnation 
of antigen-antibody complexes. The pre-absorbed antibodies can not bind to any 
proteins but allow the binding of contaminating antibodies if there are any with venom 
proteins, and thus it proves the purity of antibody preparation. The immunisation of 
rabbit and collection of blood were performed by Dr Rob Harrison from the Liverpool 
School of Tropical Medicine. 
3.2.7 Complete sequencing of rhiminopeptidase 
The venom gland cDNA synthesis was performed as described in chapter 2. Specific 
primers were designed based on the aminopeptidase A sequence of Gloydius blomhoffi 
brevicaudus to amplify the aminopeptidase gene in Bitis gabonica rhinoceros venom 
gland cDNA. In order to obtain the sequence of the complete gene, primers were 
designed corresponding to the untranslated regions of the gene. The designed primers 
are: upper primer- S'CAAGCAAAAGCAGATGAGAAGGAA3' and lower primer-
S' TCAGAGTGGCGAATATGTGGTTA3'. 5J.lg of cDNA were used to amplify the 
aminopeptidase A gene using these specific primers as described in chapter 2. The 
amplified product was sequenced using the primer walking method at Cogenics, Essex, 
3.2.8 Crystallisation 
Crystallisation trials were performed using purified protein at a concentration of 
9mg/ml. Standard crystallisation trial kits were employed, and micro seeding was used 
in an attempt to increase the size of the crystals produced. The crystals were sent to the 
European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, Germany for preliminary 
data collection. 
3.2.9 Sequence and structure analysis 
The nucleotide sequence was translated and the basic featmes of the protein were 
analysed using DNASTAR Lasergene software version 7 (Burland, 2000). The multiple 
sequence alignment and pairwise alignments were perfonned as described in chapter 2. 
The secondary structme was predicted using various tools [PSIPRED (Jones, 1999), 
Jnet (Cuff et aI., 1999) and SSPro (Cheng et aI., 2(05)] included in Phyre (Bennett-
Lovseyet at., 2(08). The 3-dimensional structme was modelled using the CPHmodels 2 
server (Lund et aI., 2002) and Phyre (Bennett-Lovsey et at., 2(08), and analysed using 
Swiss PDB viewer and Protein Explorer as described in chapter 2. The transmembrane 
helix was predicted using TMHMM server version 2 (www.cbs.dtu.dk) and Phobius 
(KaI1 et aI., 2004). The signal peptide region was predicted using Interproscan 
(Quevillon et aI., 2(05). 
3.3 Results 
3.3.1 Protein profile of crude Bitis gabonica rhinoceros venom 
To identify the protein profile of crude venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros, an SDS-
PAGE was performed. The result of SDS-PAGE is shown in figure 3.1. There are 
approximately 21 prominent protein bands present with varying intensities. The 
molecular weights of these proteins vary from 10kDa to 150kDa. There is a single 
prominent band at a molecular weight of 150kDa which is approximately what might be 
expected for an aminopeptidase as it is consistent with previously characterised 
aminopeptidases.

venom. The band at 150kDa molecular weight might be an aminopeptidase. 
3.3.2 Purification of 150kDa protein 
The protein purification profile of crude Bitis gabonica rhinoceros venom obtained 
from the Sephacryl HR 200 gel filtration column is shown in figure 3.2. 7 clear peaks 
were identified. These are labelled as I to VII as shown in figure 3.2 (A). Elution peak 
III had high UV absorbance. 
14 fractions were chosen randomly from the purification profile for SOS and native 
PAGE analysis [figure 3.2 (B)]. They were labelled CFl to CF14 (CF means column 
fraction). The SOS and native-PAGE of these fractions are shown in figure 3.3 (A) and 
(B) respectively. A protein with molecular weight 150kDa was found in pure fonn in 
CFl. CF2 had this protein along with several other proteins. In the native-PAGE, the 
150kDa protein migrated well indicating that this is an anionic protein. 
There were 3x3m1 fractions between CFl and CF2 and they were labelled CF1.1, CF1.2 
and CF1.3. Together with CFl and CF2, these fractions were analysed in SOS-PAGE to 
find out the number of fractions containing the pure 150kDa protein. The resulting 
SOS-PAGE showed that CFl, CFl.l and CF1.2 contain pure l50kDa protein. Thu.c; 
these 3 fractions were pooled and concentrated using Vivaspin filters. The estimated 
amount of 150kDa protein obtained using 50mg of crude venom was 1.3mg. 
Figure 3.3 C shows a gel of the purified protein, indicating that the protein is pure and 
free from contaminating proteins.

3.3.3 Partial sequencing of 150kDa protein by mass spectrometry 
Mass spectrometric analysis was used to characterise the 150kDa protein. Nano LC-ES-
MSIMS was performed by M-Scan Limited (Wokingham) on extracts from the tryptic 
digestion of the 150kDa gel band. On interrogation of the mass spectrometry database 
(MSDB) with the MS and MSIMS peak lists using MASCOT software, a hypothetical 
protein from Pongo pygmaeus (MSDB accession number: Q5R7D5_PONPY) was 
identified as the only non-contaminant protein. The score for this protein was 5, 
significantly lower than the threshold of 49 required for identity or extensive homology. 
Manual sequencing of an individual MSIMS spectrum which showed good 
fragmentation yielded the sequence shown in figure 3.4. Protein-Protein BLAST with 
this sequence (GFIDDAF ALAR) showed that it is 100% identical to a fragment of 
aminopeptidase A from Gloydius blomhoffi brevicaudus (Ogawa et aI., 2007) and 
similar to aminopeptidase A from several other organisms. 
Furthermore, BLAST searches with the hypothetical protein from Pongo pygmaeus 
showed that it was 99% identical to a fragment of human glutamyl aminopeptidase 
(NCB I accession number: NP _ 001968). 
These results suggest that the 150kDa protein might be an aminopeptidase, possibly 
aminopeptidase A since it matches with an aminopeptidase A from another viper 
source.

3.3.4 Functional characterisation of 150kDa protein 
As the molecular weight and mass spectrometric results suggest that the 150kDa protein 
might be an aminopeptidase, functional assays for the main aminopeptidase activities 
(APA, APB, APL and APN) were performed on the purified protein and on the crude 
venom (figure 3.5). The crude venom has relatively high APA and APN activities, and 
lower APB and APL activities. The 150kDa protein displayed relatively high 
aminopeptidase A and N activities, and very low aminopeptidase B activity. The 
differences in activity between the venom and pure protein are due to the amount of 
150kDa protein present in the taken amount of venom is lower than that of the pure 
protein. These results are consistent with the partial sequence identification and further 
suggest that the 150kDa protein we have purified is an aminopeptidase with AP A and 
APN activities. We have thus named this protein 'rhiminopeptidase'. The presence of 
APL and APB activities in the crude venom suggests the presence of further 
aminopeptidases in the venom.

3.3.5 Glycosylation detection and deglycosylation of rhiminopeptidase 
As the aminopeptidase A from the venom of Gloydius blomhoffi brevicaudus was 
predicted to be glycosylated, glycosylation detection was performed on pure 
rhiminopeptidase to identify whether this is glycosylated. The results show that 
rhiminopeptidase is glycosylated (figure 3.6B lane 1). To obtain the molecular weight 
of the protein without sugar attached, rhiminopeptidase was deglycosylated using N 
Glycosidase and the resulting samples were run in 10% SDS-PAGE along with N 
Glycosidase. Figure 3.6 (A) compares the molecular weights of glycosylated and 
deglycosylated proteins. The estimated molecular weight of deglycosylated protein is 
approximately 102kDa. Thus around 48kDa (32%) of the 150kDa molecular weight of 
the purified protein is due to glycosylation. Figure 3.6 Blane 2 shows the result of 
glycosylation detection on the enzyme after deglycosylation - no detectable sugar 
remains bound to the protein. These data suggest that like the aminopeptidase A from 
Gloydius blomhofji brevicaudus (Ogawa et aI., 2007), rhiminopeptidase is glycosylated.

3.3.6 Affinity of anti-rhiminopeptidase antibody against different venoms 
If specific anti-rhiminopeptidase antibodies were raised, they could be used to identify 
similar aminopeptidases in other venoms using immunoblotting and they could also be 
used in affinity purification of rhiminopeptidase and similar proteins. Thus anti-
rhiminopeptidase antibodies were raised by immunizing a rabbit with pure protein. The 
antibody identified the purified rhiminopeptidase strongly (figure 3.7A) along with 
several other proteins of different molecular weights in the venom of Bitis gabonica 
rhinoceros (figure 3.7C, laneI2). Furthermore the antibody identified proteins at 
molecular weights of around 150kDa in the venoms of Echis pyramidum, Bitis arietans, 
Cerastes cerastes and Calloselasma rhodostoma (figure 3.7C lanes 2, 4, 5 and 7). In 
addition to these, the antibody identified several other proteins in all other viper venoms 
tested but no proteins in the venom of an elapid snake Naja nigriculus (lane 6). This 
suggests that the antibody raised against this viper venom protein might be specific only 
to viper venoms. Venom proteins in elapid snakes are in any case different from vipers, 
as they mainly contain neurotoxins and phospholipases. 
The immunoblotting of membranes containing rotofor fractions (PI 5-7) (figure 3.7D) of 
Bitis gabonica rhinoceros venom with antiserum (figure 3.7E) and antiserum which had 
been pre-absorbed to rhiminopeptidase (figure 3.7F) show that the antibodies which 
bind to several proteins in this venom also binds to rhiminopeptidase. A few bands 
appear in the membrane hybridised with pre-absorbed antibodies, indicating more 
antigen may be required in order to completely saturate this antiserum. Thus it seems 
that the same antibodies which recognise the rhiminopeptidase also recognise other 
proteins in the Bitis gabonica rhinoceros venom. This may mean that rhiminopeptidase 
might have domains or glycosylated moieties similar to other proteins present in the 
viper venoms. Many viper venom proteins in the 37kDa to 75kDa range are metallo 
endoproteases, which contain a zinc binding catalytic domain like aminopeptidases. 
Thus the polyclonal antibody is not specific for the aminopeptidase (rhiminopeptidase) 
and it would be better to use monoclonal antibodies to purify and characterise such 
proteins. However further affinity purification of the polyclonal antibodies might help 
to improve their specificity for aminopeptidases.

3.3.7 peR amplification of aminopeptidase gene in Bitis gabonica rhinoceros 
venom gland cDNAs 
As an aminopeptidase A gene sequence containing 4991 base pairs (bp) from the venom 
gland cDNAs of Gloydius blomhoffi brevicaudus (Ogawa et aI., 2007) has been 
published, we designed specific primers for the untranslated regions of this gene in 
order to obtain the complete sequence of the aminopeptidase A gene in BiNs gabonica 
rhinoceros. The estimated size of the amplified product was 3350bp according to the 
molecular weight markers (figure 3.8). This observation was consistent with the 
expected size of 3337bp (as the designed primers cover only part of the gene) from the 
sequence of aminopeptidase A from Gloydius blomhoffi brevicaudus. The amplified 
DNA was eluted from the preparative gel slices and this and the primers were sent to 
Cogenics Limited for complete sequencing using primer walking.

3.3.8 Sequence analysis 
The resulting complete nucleotide sequence of the aminopeptidase gene (figure 3.9) 
contains 3232 nucleotides and the coding region was between bases 81 and 2945. The 
translated protein contains 955 amino acids (figure 3.10) and has calculated molecular 
weight of 11OkDa. The predicted isoelectric point of this protein is 6.15 which is 
consistent with the rotofor results. The composition of the protein is 10.9% basic amino 
acids (K, R), 12.4% acidic amino acids (0, E), 34.6% hydrophobic amino acids (A, I, L, 
F, W, V), 28.1% polar amino acids (N, C, Q, S, T, Y) and 14% other amino acids (M, 
G, H, P). N-glycosylation prediction predicted that the protein contains 10 potential N-
glycosylation sites, which are indicated by pink letters in figure 3.10. This is consistent 
with the molecular weights of rhiminopeptidase i.e. 150kDa and deglycosylated 
rhiminopeptidase i.e. 102kDa estimated from SDS-PAGE. Though there is a difference 
of around 8kDa between the molecular weight of the deglycosy1ated protein and 
predicted molecular weight from sequence, this could be due to the slight difference in 
the mobility of proteins and molecular weight markers in the gel. Furthermore, 
molecular weights obtained from SDS-PAGE are only approximate. 
The predicted pI (6.15) of the complete protein sequence obtained correlates with the 
anionic behaviour of rhiminopeptidase in the native gel (figure 3.3b) and the partial 
sequence obtained from mass spectrometry for rhiminopeptidase is identical to the 
complete sequence of the protein between amino acids 653 and 663 (underlined in 
figure 3.10), strongly suggesting that the sequence corresponds to the protein we have 
purified. Further, comparison of computer generated tryptic peptides derived from this 
amino acid sequence with the MSIMS data from the purified protein showed matches 
which covered 45% of the amino acid sequence (M-Scan Ltd personal communication, 
figure 3.11). The absence of any other proteins with molecular weights around 150kDa 
in the venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros (figure 3.1) and lack of other isoforms in the 
PCR amplified products further suggests that the gene we have sequenced corresponds 
to rhiminopeptidase. The other aminopeptidase activities in the crude venom such as 
APB and APL indicate the presence of further aminopeptidases. The APB and APL 
might have different untranslated regions and thus would not be amplified by the 
 designed primers for AP A. 
Interproscan (Quevillon et al., 2005) identified several characteristic regions within the 
rhiminopeptidase protein. These include a signal peptide between amino acids 1 and 35, 
a predicted transmembrane region between amino acids 18 and 38 and a metalloprotease 
catalytic domain between amino acids 91 and 477 (figure 3.10). 
Rhiminopeptidase is 93% identical to aminopeptidase A from Gloydius blomhojJi 
brevicaudus and 62-65% identical to aminopeptidase As from human, pig and chicken. 
Figure 3.12 shows the alignment of these sequences. The 3 functionally important 
motifs (zinc binding HEXXHXlSE motif necessary for the binding of the zinc ion, 
GAMEN motif necessary for exopeptidase activity and YXK.G motif necessary for 
stabilisation of the tetrahedral intennediate of the substrate during catalysis) are 
conserved in rhiminopeptidase. The structurally and functionally important residues of 
human aminopeptidase A are conserved in rhiminopeptidase as shown in figure 3.12. 
Residues arginine 228 and aspartate 235 (numbering is based on the human 
aminopeptidase A sequence) are important for the maintenance of the structural 
confonnation of aminopeptidase A (Rozenfeld et al., 2002). 
Glutamate 223 together with glutamate 360 (called the anionic binding site) of the 
GAMEN motif interacts with the N-tenninal amine of the substrate during catalysis 
(Rozenfeld et al., 2003). Asparagine 361 together with glutamate 360 of the GAMEN 
motif is involved in the detennination of exopeptidase activity like asparagine 144 in 
carboxypeptidase A (Iturrioz et al., 2001). Aspartate 221 is a critical residue involved in 
the calcium induced modulation of the enzymatic activity (Goto et al., 2007). Histidine 
393, histidine 397 and glutamate 416 of the HEXXHXlSE zinc binding motif (a 
characteristic feature of the 'gluzincins' subfamily ofmetallopeptidases) are involved in 
tetra co-coordinating the zinc ion in the absence of substrate. Glutamate 394 polarizes 
the zinc coordinated water molecule and promotes the nucleophilic attack during 
catalysis. Glutamate 394 and tyrosine 479 of the YXK.G motif together with glutamate 
360 are involved in stabilization of the tetrahedral intennediate of the substrate during 
 catalysis (Andberg et al., 1997). Glutamate 394 also donates a proton to the leaving 
nitrogen atom of the peptide scissile bond (Iturrioz et al., 2001) .

3.3.10 Structure prediction of rhiminopeptidase 
')t In the absence of experimentally detennined high resolution structural infonnation 
about rhiminopeptidase, a variety of tools were used to predict the protein's structure. 
3.3.10.1 Secondary structure and transmembrane helix prediction 
Secondary structure predictions using PsiPred 2.6 (Jones, 1999) and the secondary 
structure prediction tools used by Phyre (Bennett-Lovsey et al., 2008) suggest that the 
N-terminus of the protein is predominantly B-sheet and C-tenninus is mainly a-helical. 
Transmembrane helix prediction using TMHMM (www.cbs.dtu.dk) and Phobius (Kall 
et al., 2004) predict a transmembrane region between amino acids 16 and 38 
(TMHMM) or between amino acids 18 and 40 (Phobius). This corresponds roughly to a 
single transmembrane a-helix between residues 22 and 35 predicted by Phyre (figure 
3.18). Both Phobius and Phyre servers predict amino acids before this region to be 
cytoplasmic and amino acids after this to be non-cytoplasmic. Phobius was specifically 
designed to distinguish between the hydrophobic amino acids in transmembrane regions 
and those in signal peptides. Interestingly, although Interproscan indicated the first 40 
amino acids constituted a signal peptide, Phobius predicts a transmembrane region 
rather than a signal peptide at the N-terminus of rhiminopeptidase.

transmembrane helix) in this region. Phyre suggests the region from 43 to 85 is 
disordered. Rhimino represents the rhiminopeptidase sequence, PSS represents 
the predicted secondary structure and RN represents the residue number. 
.. 3.3.10.2 Three dimensional structure information 
In order to obtain 3-dimensional structural information a BLAST search was performed 
to compare the rhiminopeptidase sequence with the sequences corresponding to known 
structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The most similar protein of known structure 
is tricorn interacting factor F3 from the archeaon Thermoplasma acidophilum (PDB 
code IZI W, Kyrieleis et al., 2005). The sequence identity of rhiminopeptidase with 
tricorn interacting factor F3 was 30.7%. 
Tricorn interacting factor F3 is a zinc aminopeptidase with a molecular weight of 
89kDa, involved together with other factors in the proteasomal degradation pathway of 
Thermoplasma acidophilum. This protein contains 780 amino acids in its primary 
structure. The detennined crystal structure of this protein has 4 domains: an N-terminal 
saddle-like B-structure domain I (from amino acids 1-170), the catalytic domain II (171-
414), an unique short B-barrel domain III (415-489) and an a-helical domain N (490-
780). The determined structure of tricorn interacting factor F3 is shown in figure 
3.l9(A) along with its zinc binding residues (figure 3.19B) and catalytic domain 
showing the GAMEN, zinc binding and YXKG motifs (figure 3.l9C). The catalytic 
domain contains the zinc binding motif and the other important residues for catalysis 
(Kyrieleis et al., 2005). 
Figure 3.19 (A) Determined crystal structure of tricorn interacting factor F3 (PDB 
code: lZI W) showing 4 domains. The red colour indicates the N-terminal saddle-
like p-barrel domain, blue indicates the catalytic domain, green indicates the short 
p-barrel domain and white indicates the C-terminal a-helical domain. (B) Zinc 
binding amino acids coordinating a zinc ion. (C) Catalytic domain showing the 
GAMEN (yellow), zinc binding (white) and YXKG (red) motifs in a deeper groove. 
The zinc ion in all the figures is indicated by an arrow. These figures were 
generated using Protein Explorer. 
Several approaches were used to try to obtain a 3-dimensional model of the structure of 
t rhiminopeptidase. SWISS-MODEL (Arnold et al., 2006) was not able to produce a 
model, possibly because of the low sequence identity between the rhiminopeptidase and 
the most similar sequence of known structure. Two other methods: CPH models 2 
(Lund et al., 2002) and Phyre (Bennett-Lovsey et al., 2008) were, however able to 
produce models for the structure of rhiminopeptidase. CPH models uses position 
specific iterated (PSij-BLAST to obtain a protein sequence profile in the first instance 
and then uses the profile to search the structure database for a suitable template to 
generate a model. Phyre is a fold recognition server which finds the known structure 
which is most compatible with the input sequence based on PSI-BLAST-generated 
protein sequence profiles together with comparison of real and predicted secondary 
structures. 
In agreement with our BLAST results both servers identified the determined structure of 
tricorn interacting factor F3 as a template (PDB codes lZl W or lZ5H which are 
alternative conformations of the same protein). This is a plausible template as it is also a 
zinc aminopeptidase. Furthermore the secondary structure of F3 matches closely the 
predicted secondary structure of rhiminopeptidase indicating that rhiminopeptidase is 
likely to adopt the F3 fold. The modelled structure as predicted by CPH models is 
shown in figure 3.20. This modelled structure of rhiminopeptidase covers amino acids 
between 100 and 891. 
An attempt was made to fit the modelled structure to the X-ray crystallographic data. 
This was not possible due to the low resolution of the crystal data, which was not 
sufficient even to distinguish between the protein and surrounding water in the crystal. 
Clearly, better crystals are required to enable a true understanding of the structure of 
this protein. 
Figure 3.20 Modelled structure of rhiminopeptidase showing 4 different domains. 
The red colour indicates the N-terminal saddle-like p-barrel domain, blue indicates 
the catalytic domain, green indicates the short p-barrel domain and white indicates 
the C-terminal a-helical domain. The structure was modelled using CPH models 
server 2. This figure was generated using Protein Explorer. 
Based on the sequence alignment of rhiminopeptidase with F3, secondary structure 
prediction and modelled 3-dimensional structure, we have divided the sequence of 
rhiminopeptidase into 5 regions in order to describe the structure and compare with 
tricorn interacting factor F3. 
Region 1 comprises the first 94 amino acids of rhiminopeptidase. This region is not 
aligned with the template sequence either by CPH models or Phyre as the template lacks 
this region. This region includes the predicted transmembrane helix between residues 16 
and 38 (or 18 and 40). PsiPred suggests that this region has no secondary structure. The 
consensus prediction by Phyre (which includes PsiPred) shows 2 B-strands (between 
amino acids 10 and 21) and an a-helix (between 22 and 35) which might be the 
predicted transmembrane helix and suggests that the region between 43 and 85 is 
disordered (figure 3.18). There is no modelled structure available for this region as there 
is no available template. 
Region 2 of rhiminopeptidase (between amino acids 95 and 289) is equivalent to the N-
terminal domain I of tricorn interacting factor F3 (amino acids 1-170). This region was 
aligned with the template sequence by both CPH models server and Phyre. The 
sequence identity between the two sequences in this region is very low i.e. only 19% 
(figure 3.21) that this is effectively unrelated. There are several insertions and deletions 
found in this region of rhiminopeptidase. But several B-strands are predicted in this 
region at positions consistent with the secondary structure of tricorn interacting factor 
F3 (figure 3.22). The modelled structure ofrhiminopeptidase of this region is a B-barrel 
domain like the N-terminal domain of tricorn interacting factor F3 (figure 3.23). This 
region includes 2 structurally important residues (arginine 228 and aspartate 235) and 2 
functionally important residues (aspartate 221 and glutamate 223) as described in

Figure 3.22 The secondary structure prediction of the N-terminal domain of 
rhiminopeptidase compared with the corresponding sequence and secondary 
structure of tricorn interacting factor F3. This structure shows mainly fl-sheet 
structure and is mostly consistent with the template. This structure was predicted 
by Phyre. Rhimino represents rhiminopeptidase, Tricorn represents tricorn 
interacting factor F3, PSS represents predicted secondary structure and RN 
represents residue number. 
Figure 3.23 The modelled structure of N-terminal domain I of rhiminopeptidase 
showing the p-sheet domain. The structurally (arginine 228 and aspartate 235) and 
functionally (aspartate 221 and glutamate 223) important residues are shown in 
white and blue respectively. The structure was modelled using CPH models server 
2. This figure was generated using Protein Explorer. 
Region 3 of rhiminopeptidase (between amino acids 290 and 537) is equivalent to the 
catalytic domain (171-414) of tricorn interacting factor F3. This region has a sequence 
identity of 46.2% with tricorn interacting factor F3 (figure 3.24). Only a few amino acid 
insertions are found in this region of rhiminopeptidase, so the alignment is more reliable 
than that of region 2. The secondary structure also seems consistent with the template 
structure (figure 3.25), with a-helical and ~-sheet regions at the beginning and only a-
helices at the end. All three functionally important motifs (G AMEN , zinc binding 
HEXXHXJsE and YXKG) are conserved in this region. Figure 3.26 shows the modelled 
structure with the functionally important motifs indicated. Compared to other domains, 
the structure of this domain should be more reliable due to the higher identity between 
the sequences and very few insertions or deletions.

Region 4 of rhiminopeptidase (between amino acids 538-628) corresponds to the barrel

of this short region with the template sequence is only 28.7% and 2 large insertions are 
found in the rhiminopeptidase sequence (figure 3.27). Nevertheless the predicted 
secondary structure of this region is still similar to the template as both proteins have 
only p-sheets in this domain (figure 3.28). When the crystal structure of tricorn 
interacting factor F3 was determined, it was suggested that this domain was unique for 
F3 but rhiminopeptidase also seems to have this small p-sheet domain. The modelled 
structure of this domain is shown in figure 3.29.

On the whole, the model gives only a guide to the structure of rhirninopeptidase. The 
sequence similarity is low and regions of the alignment are uncertain. More work based 
on the crystal data we have obtained for rhiminopeptidase crystals using other programs 
might allow development of a more reliable model. Nevertheless the models made by 
both Phyre and CPH models server are consistent with each other and with the predicted 
secondary structure of the rhirninopeptidase. Phyre indicates a confidence in the model 
and gives an estimated precision of 100% suggesting it is confident in the fold of the 
protein. The model suggests that the rhiminopeptidase shares the 4 domain structure of 
tricorn interacting factor F3, with an additional N-terminal transmembrane helix 
connected by a disordered region to the rest of the structure. The most reliable part of 
the structure is the catalytic domain, in which all 3 functionally important motifs are 
positioned both in rhiminopeptidase and tricorn interacting factor F3 . 
3.4 Discussion 
We have purified an aminopeptidase from the venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros 
using single step gel filtration method. The protein, which we have named 
'rhiminopeptidase', has a molecular weight of 150kDa according to its mobility in 
reduced and denatured SDS-P AGE gels. The partial amino acid sequence and functional 
characterisation confirm this protein as an aminopeptidase A with aminopeptidase N 
activity. The abundance of this enzyme in the venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros is 
quite low. This is the first time that an aminopeptidase has been identified in any Bitis 
gabonica. None of the previous publications has reported aminopeptidase activity or a 
protein with a molecular weight as high as 150kDa in Bitis gabonica venom. Neither 
cDNA library analysis of Bitis gabonica (Francischetti et aI., 2004) nor the proteomic 
analysis of venom proteins of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros (Calvete et aI., 2007) identified 
any aminopeptidases. Aminopeptidases are, however, not unknown in snake venom; 
various aminopeptidase activities have been found in other snakes, and an 
aminopeptidase A was recently purified from the venom of Gloydius blomhoffi 
brevicaudus and characterised (Ogawa et aI., 2007). 
Rhiminopeptidase has both aminopeptidase A and aminopeptidase N activities, together 
with low aminopeptidase B activity. This contrasts with the aminopeptidase A from 
Gloydius blomhoffi brevicaudus, which was shown just to have aminopeptidase A 
activity. As no other snake venom aminopeptidases have been purified or characterised, 
it remains to be seen whether this multiple activity is a general feature of 
aminopeptidases or unique to rhiminopeptidase. Our analysis of the Bitis gabonica 
rhinoceros venom suggests that there may be further aminopeptidases in the venom 
which have not yet been identified. In this sense, Bitis gabonica rhinoceros venom 
appears similar to other snake venoms in which multiple aminopeptidase activities have 
been found as described in section 3.1. 
The primary structure of rhiminopeptidase was determined using PCR amplification of 
cDNA and sequencing. The cDNA sequence has 3232 nucleotides and codes for a 
protein of 955 amino acids corresponding to a molecular weight of 110kDa The 
rhiminopeptidase has 93% identity with AP A from Gloydius blomhojJi brevicaudus 
(Ogawa et al., 2007) and 62%-65% identical to AP As from human, pig and chicken. 
Though rhiminopeptidase has APN activity, the best sequence matches are to other 
AP A sequences and thus we have called this an aminopeptidase A. Both APN and AP A 
belong to the family of Fl metallopeptidases containing HEXXHXJsE, a characteristic 
feature of the gluzincins subfamily (Rawlings & Barrett, 1995). 
Rhiminopeptidase contains the HEXXHXJsE zinc binding motif, the GAMEN motif 
which is necessary for the exopeptidase activity (Rawlings & Barrett, 1995) and the 
YXKG motif necessary for the transition stabilisation of the tetrahedral intermediate 
during catalysis (Andberg et al., 1997). The presence of amino acids important for the 
function and for the maintenance of structure suggests that this enzyme will act as an 
aminopeptidase A and may have similar functions to AP As from other animals. 
Rhiminopeptidase was found to be glycosylated and predicted to have 10 potential N-
glycosylation sites. The aminopeptidase A identified from the venom of G/oydius 
b/omhojJi brevicaudus was also found to be glycosylated and predicted to have 17 N-
glycosylation sites (Ogawa et al., 2007). The deglycosylated protein showed the 
molecular weight of 102kDa based on the SDS-PAGE. Thus, glycosylation is 
responsible for the increase of molecular weight in the matured protein after post 
translational modification. This is the reason why the mature protein shows a molecular 
weight of ISOkDa but the translated protein has a predicted molecular weight of 11 OkDa 
and the deglycosylated protein has an estimated molecular weight of I02kDa. 
The crystallisation trials yielded small crystals of rhiminopeptidase and preliminary X-
ray data were collected for these. The crystal data was complete to 7.sA resolution, 
which was sufficient to determine the unit cell and space group of the crystals. As this 
was not enough to determine the structure, further crystallisation trials are in progress in 
an attempt to grow larger and better ordered crystals which might diffract at higher 
resolution. Since we now think this is a multi domain protein, crystallisation methods 
specific for multi domain proteins such as honey comb lattice method (Wen et al., 2008) 
may help to do this. Another major constraint in the crystallisation is the low abundance 
of the protein in the Hitis gabonica rhinoceros venom. 
The structural modelling of rhiminopeptidase using CPH models and Phyre suggests 
that this is a multi domain protein. The overall fold and structure of protein was similar 
to the template which is tricorn interacting factor F3 (PDB code: lZlW), a zinc 
aminopeptidase from an archeaon Thermoplasma acidophilum (Kyrieleis et al., 2005). 
The modelled structure shows 4 domains with various structures. The N-terminal 
domain contain 2 structurally and 2 functionally important residues. The catalytic 
domain has the zinc binding amino acids which are oriented in order to bind a zinc ion. 
Also this domain shows that the GAMEN, zinc binding and YXK.G motifs necessary for 
catalysis are present in a deep groove in order to accommodate the N-terminus of the 
substrate. Although Kyrieleis et al. (2005) suggested that the third short B-barrel domain 
is unique for the tricorn interacting factor F3, this domain was found in 
rhiminopeptidase too. The catalytic domain is the most reliable region of the model as it 
was the region most similar to the template sequence. 
The production of antibodies against rhiminopeptidase identifies similar proteins in 
other viper venoms along with several other proteins in the Bitis gabonica rhinoceros 
venom. Venoms of 5 other vipers contain proteins similar to rhiminopeptidase with 
molecular weights around 150kDa. These proteins might also be aminopeptidases. 
Interestingly these antibodies did not bind to any of the proteins present in an elapid 
Naja nigriculus which has no metalloproteases and this suggests the antibodies could be 
specific to viper snake venoms. The immunoblot with antiserum pre-absorbed with pure 
rhiminopeptidase suggests that antibodies could be recognising a common feature in 
rhiminopeptidase and other viper venom proteins. 
Rhiminopeptidase is only the second aminopeptidase to be isolated from reptiles. The 
only other reptile aminopeptidase known is also from snake venom (Ogawa et a1., 
2007). Our protein has a very similar amino acid sequence to this protein, but it has 
broader amino acid specificity, being able to cleave acidic, neutral and basic amino 
acids. It will be interesting to see whether aminopeptidases identified in the future share 
this broad amino acid specificity. 
Of more intrigue is the role of aminopeptidases in snake venoms. This is still unclear, 
while mammalian aminopeptidases are involved in various physiological processes. 
APN is involved in the degradation of neuropeptides (Ahmad et al., 1992), cytokines 
(Hoffman et al., 1993) and angiotensins (Chansel et al., 1998). APB has been reported 
to participate in prohormone processing (Cohen et al., 1987). AP A has been reported to 
be involved in the catabolic pathway of the renin-angiotensin system by converting 
angiotensin II into angiotensin III which exerts stimulatory actions in the central control 
of blood pressure system by increasing the blood pressure (Rozenfeld et al., 2003). 
Together with tricorn protease of proteasomes, tricorn interacting factor F3, a bacterial 
zinc aminopeptidase A is involved in the degradation of oligopeptides in order to 
maintain the catabolic and anabolic processes, and to liberate free amino acids for 
protein synthesis (Tamura et al., 1998). Thus, rhiminopeptidase could possibly have 
several functions as it has more than one activity. It might be involved in degradation of 
proteins such as enzymes, hormones, other biologically active peptides, etc. in the 
circulatory system in order to activate or inactivate the particular protein. Also it might 
be involved in conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin III and thus increase the 
blood pressure in the prey or victims. This conversion has been proved for the partially 
purified aminopeptidase A from Gloydius blomhofJi brevicaudus (Ogawa et al., 2007). 
As rhiminopeptidase has APN and very low APB activities, it might be involved in 
degradation of neuropeptides, cytokines and prohormonal processing. But it is clear that 
the functions of aminopeptidases in snake venoms are yet to be confirmed.

4.1 Introduction 
Snake venom serine proteases (SVSPs) are responsible for disorders in blood 
coagulation of the prey or victims following a bite (Stocker, 1990). They are mainly 
found in venoms of viperinae and crotalinae with a few occurring in the elapidae and 
hydrophidae families. Viper venom serine proteases (VVSPs) are classified into several 
categories according to the stage of the blood coagulation system which they affect. 
These categories include pro-coagulant enzymes such as thrombin like enzymes which 
clot fibrinogen (fibrinogenolytic), factor V activators, kininogenases, platelet 
aggregators, etc. and anti-coagulant enzymes such as fibrinolytic enzymes, plasminogen 
activators, protein C activators, etc. (Markland, 1998). They belong to the family of S 1 
serine proteases and clan SA, have a chymotrypsin-like fold and contain 230-250 amino 
acids with molecular weights between 28kDa and 38kDa. Member WSPs of this 
family have typically 60-90% sequence identity with each other (i.e. between species) 
(Itoh et al., 1987; Zhang et al., 1995). 
Examples of well characterised venom thrombin like serine proteases are: ancrod from 
the venom of Malayan pit viper (Agkistrodon rhodostoma) (Burkhart et al., 1992), 
batroxobin from Bothrops atrox moojeni (Holleman et al., 1976), flavoxobin from 
Trimeresurus flavoviridis (Shieh et ai, 1988), crotalase from Crotalus adamanteus 
(Markland et aI., 1971), calobin from Agkistrodon caliginous (Hahn et aI., 1996), 
bothrombin from Bothrops jararaca (Nishida et al., 1994), PA-BJ, a platelet 
aggregating enzyme from Bothrops jararaca (Serrano et al., 1995), ACC-C, a protein C 
activator from Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix (Kisiel et al., 1987), two isoforms of 
RVV-V, factor V activators from Vipera russelli (Tokunaga et al., 1988) and TSV-PA, 
a plasminogen activator from Trimeresurus stejnegeri (Zhang et aI., 1995). Some of the 
venom serine proteases have been reported to have more than one function; for example 
crotalase from Crotalus adamanteus (Markland et aI., 1971) has both fibrinogenolytic 
and kininogenase activities. 
Several natural and chemically synthesised serine protease inhibitors can inhibit the 
activities of these enzymes (detailed description in section 1.4). PMSF 
(phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride) is a potent inhibitor for serine proteases but has been 
reported not to inhibit some VVSPs. Benzamidine (BDN) is another inhibitor for serine 
proteases and was found to inhibit a VVSP called ACC-C (protein C activator) from 
Agkistrodon aculus (Murakami et al., 2005). 
The purification of venom proteins is a difficult process as the venom is a complex 
mixture of several enzymes and small peptides with various molecular weights. So there 
are no standard methods to purify the venom enzymes, rather different methods are used 
according to the size and nature of the venom proteins. Thus far several classical 
purification methods such as gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography have been 
employed to purify the VVSPs in snake venoms. For example, three serine protease 
fractions namely EI, Ell, EIII (Viljoen et al., 1979) and gabonase, a clotting serine 
protease (pirkle et al., 1986) were isolated from the venom of Bitis gabonica using gel 
filtration and DEAE (diethylaminoethyl) ion exchange chromatographic techniques. 
Understanding the relationships between sequences, structures and functions of viper 
venom serine proteases is useful for understanding the specificity of these enzymes and 
their effects on prey. Sequence and functional infonnation for about 30 VVSPs have 
been obtained from the purified proteins and for over 100 VVSPs through cDNA 
cloning and nucleotide sequencing. In addition, few sequences have been expressed and 
characterised (parry et al., 1998). Nevertheless, purification of proteins from the venom, 
where possible, has the advantage of allowing study of the native protein rather than one 
expressed in a model organism. It is hard to ascertain whether the functional 
infonnation published for VVSPs is complete as it is possible for these proteins to have 
more than one function, yet, in many cases, only a restricted number of tests has been 
carried out. For example, many proteins are simply characterised as serine proteases or 
thrombin like enzymes. 
.. :"'1 
Structural information about VVSPs is particularly limited. Only 4 crystal structmes 
have been detennined so far: TSV-PA (Parry et al., 1998) from Trimeresurus stejnegeri, 
ACC-C (Murakami et al., 2005) from Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix and serine 
protease I (AaV-SPI) and II (AaV-SPII), fibrinogenolytic enzymes (Zhu et al., 2005) 
from Agkistrodon aculUs. There is a need to obtain structural information for VVSPs 
with other functions to understand their specificity and action. 
A key aim of this research is to increase the known information about sequence, 
structure and functions of VVSPs. To achieve this we have attempted to purify, 
characterise and crystallise serine proteases from the venom of the West African gaboon 
viper Bitis gabonica rhinoceros. Bites from these snakes are rare but there are several 
advantages of using this venom. Firstly there is a high yield of venom per milking. 
Furthermore, research to date on this venom (proteins) is limited and an interesting 
serine protease without a classical catalytic triad has previously been reported from this 
venom (Francischetti et al., 2004). 
In this chapter, I will describe the development of a novel method for purification of a 
serine protease-like enzyme, which we have called rhinocerase, from Bitis gabonica 
rhinoceros venom. The protein has been functionally characterised, partially sequenced 
and preliminary crystallisation trials have been performed . 
4.2 Methods 
4.2.1 Protein profiles of venom of Bids gahonica rhinoceros 
Samples of crude venom from Bitis gabonica rhinoceros were prepared in different 
quantities such as 50Jlg, 25Jlg, etc. by serially diluting in RSTB (reducing sample 
treatment buffer) and separated by SOS-PAGE as described in chapter 2. 
4.2.2 Serine protease assay for crude venom 
Serine protease activity was determined using a fluorescent substrate BAAMC (N-
benzoyl-L-arginine 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin HCL), obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. 
Enzyme solutions were prepared at varying concentrations in O.lM Tris.CI pH 7.4, and 
BAAMC was added at a final concentration of20nM in OMSO (dimethyl sulphoxide) 
and incubated for one hour at 37C in a water bath. Fluorescence was measured at the 
excitation wavelength of 366nm and emission wavelength of 460nm using a time drive 
method in a Perkin-Elmer luminometer. As a control, fluorescence was measured on a 
blank sample with no enzyme present at the same experimental conditions. 
4.2.3 Purification of rhinocerase 
Rhinocerase was purified using a microrotofor followed by gel filtration using a 
Superdex 75 column (16mmx7Ocm). 20JlI of rotofor fractions were used to analyse 
serine protease activity using BAAMC and IOJlI were used for SDS-PAGE to analyse 
the separation pattern. Fractions with serine protease activity from the rotofor 
separations were pooled and loaded on to a Superdex 75 column and run at a speed of 
Iml/min and Iml fractions were collected using 20mM Tris.CI pH7.4. One fraction with 
high absorbance in each peak i.e. PI (pl.l, Pl.2 and PI.3), P2, P3, P4 and P5 (figure 
4.4) was selected for further analysis. The serine protease activity for l00JlI of fractions 
representing each peak in the chromatogram was measured using BAAMC fluorescent 
substrate at a final concentration of 50nM in OMSO. IOOJlI of each of these fractions 
were run on 10% reducing SOS-PAGE and the gel was silver-stained. The fractions 
showing highest serine protease activity were pooled and concentrated using vivaspin 
(30kDa cut oft) protein concentrating :filters. To remove the components of the rotofor 
buffer the concentrated protein was washed several times using 100mM Tris.Cl pH 7.4 
in the concentrating filters by repeating the centrifugation. The amount of rhinocerase 
was estimated using a Bradford assay and a quantitative assay based on SDS-P AGE. 
The purification was repeated several times to increase the quantity of protein obtained. 
4.2.4 Effect of detergents on rhinocerase activity 
looJ.lg of rhinocerase were incubated with various concentrations [0.1 %, 1 %, 2%, 3%, 
4% and S% (w/v)] of CHAPS and SDS at 37C for 30 minutes. After incubation 
BAAMC fluorescent substrate at a final concentration of SOnM in DMSO was added 
and incubation continued at 37C for 1 hour. The fluorescence was measured as 
described in section 4.2.2. 
4.2.5 GJycosyJation detection and degJycosyJation of rhinocerase 
To identify whether rhinocerase is a glycosylated protein, 20J.lg of pure protein were run 
in 10010 SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred to a PVOF membrane by semi-dry western 
blotting and used for glycosylation detection as described in section 2. looJ,1g of pure 
rhinocerase in 0.02M Tris.CI pH 7.4 were mixed with S units of N Glycosidase F 
enzyme and the reaction volume was made up to S0J,11 with the same buffer. The 
reaction mix was incubated for 10 hours at 37C. 20J,1g of deglycosylated protein were 
run in 10% SDS-PAGE along with 20J.lg of glycosylated protein and protein molecular 
weight markers. The gel was transferred to a PVOF membrane and used for 
glycosylation detection as described in chapter 2. 
4.2.6 Anti-rhinocerase antibody production 
O.Sm1 of purified rhinocerase containing homogenized preparative gel slices were mixed 
with O.Sm1 of Freund's complete adjuvant and used for immunizing a rabbit. The 
booster dose was given by mixing the same amount of rhinocerase with the same 
volume of Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The anti-serum was collected and used at the 
dilution of 1 in 5000 to detect the rhinocerase and other serine proteases present in the 
rotofor fractions (PI 5-7) of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros venom as described in chapter 2. 
In order to identify the specific and non-specific binding of the anti-serum against 
several proteins in the venom, 6J.1l (enough volume to make 30m of 1 :5000 diluted anti-
serum for western blotting) of anti-serum were pre-absorbed with 200 J.1g of pure 
rhinocerase by incubating in rotating shaker for I hour at room temperature. The 
volume of reaction mix was made upto lml using 5% blocking buffer in order to allow 
the maximum formation of antigen-antibody complexes. The immunisation of the rabbit 
and collection of blood were performed by Dr Rob Harrison from Liverpool School of 
Tropical Medicine. 
4.2.7 Sequencing of rhinocerase 
100J.1g of pure rhinocerase were used for Edman sequencing as described in chapter 2. A 
silver stained polyacrylamide gel band of rhinocerase was sliced into small pieces and 
sent to the Functional Genomics and Proteomics Unit, University of Birmingham, UK 
for Q-TOF analysis as described in chapter 2. 
4.2.8 Crystallisation of rhinocerase 
Crystallisation trials were set up for the purified rhinocerase as described in chapter 2. 
The grown crystals were stained with Izit crystal dye to confirm them as protein 
crystals. 
4.2.9 Functional characterization of rhinocerase 
Purified rhinocerase was screened to identify its various functions using the following 
methods. All experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated to ensure 
consistency. The liberated fluorescence in each experiment was measured using an 
excitation wavelength of 366nm and an emission wavelength of 460nm using a Perkin-
Elmer flourometer. 
4.2.9.1 Plasma clotting assay 
The plasma clotting assay is based on the method described by Muanpasitpom et al. 
(2007). All samples were prepared in IOOmM Tris.CI pH 7.4. The assay was carried out 
on rhinocerase, crude venom, thrombin as a positive control and buffer as a negative 
control. For rhinocerase and crude venom 100J.lg of sample were used, and a range of 
quantities of thrombin (IOU, 5U, 2U and IV) were used. In each case O.5ml of human 
citrated plasma were preincubated in a clear glass tube at 37C. The appropriate volume 
(to make a final amount of l00J.lglreaction) of samples was added to each tube. 200J.lI of 
20mM CaCh were added to the reaction mix to recalcify the plasma. The mixture was 
incubated at 37C in a water bath until a clot was formed, and the clotting time 
recorded. 
4.2.9.2 Fibrinogenolytic assay 
This assay was perfonned based on the method described by Gao et al. (1998). 400J.lI of 
plasminogen-free fibrinogen prepared in 50mM Tris.CI and lOOmM NaCI, pH 7.8 at a 
concentration of 5mglml were put in a glass test tube. IOOJ.lg of rhinocerase were added 
and the mixture was incubated at 37C in a water bath. 25 J.lI of reaction mix were taken 
at each time interval and mixed with an equal volume of RSTB immediately to stop the 
reaction. The same concentration of fibrinogen was incubated at 37C with O.OOlunits 
of thrombin until 3 hours as positive control. After 3 hours incubation, a small amount 
of thrombin digested fibrinogen clot was taken in a microfuge tube and heat treated with 
RSTB. All samples were run on a 10% reducing SDS-PAGE and stained with 
Coomassie Brilliant blue. The destained gel was analysed for fibrinogenolytic activity. 
4.2.9.3 Fibrinolytic assay 
500J.lI of human citrated plasma were pre-incubated at 37C in a water bath before the 
addition of 2U of thrombin. IOOJ.lI of 20mM CaCh were added and the reaction mix was 
incubated at 37C until the fonnation of a finn clot. The liquid was aspirated carefully 
and the clot was carefully transferred to another clean test tube with sterile forceps. 
lOOJ.lg of rhinocerase were added to the clot and it was incubated at 37C overnight. As 
a control, a plasma clot was incubated with 20J.11 of 100mM Tris.CI pH 7.4. The tubes 
were monitored for the disappearance of the clot at different time intervals. 
Fibrinolytic activity was also analysed with a fluorescent plasmin substrate [A8171 (0-
Ala-Leu-Lys-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin) from Sigma Aldrich, Poole, UK]. Plasmin 
substrate at a final concentration of 50nM in DMSO was incubated with various 
quantities ofrhinocerase for one hour at 37C in 100mM Tris.CI pH 7.4. Fluorescence 
was measured as described previously. 
4.2.9.4 Kininogenase assay 
Kininogenase (kallikrein like) activity was analysed using a fluorescent glandular 
kallikrein substrate [V2763 (O-Ala-Leu-Arg-7-amid0-4-methylcownarin) from Sigma 
Aldrich, Poole, UK]. Kallikrein substrate at a final concentration of 50nM in DMSO 
was incubated with various quantities of rhinocerase or buffer as a control for one hour 
at 37C in lOOmM Tris.CI pH 7.4. The fluorescence was measured as described 
previously. 
4.2.9.5 Plasminogen activator assay 
Plasminogen activator activity was analysed using a fluorescent uP A (urokinase 
plasminogen activator) substrate [C9396 (Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin 
hydrochloride) from Sigma Aldrich, Poole, UK]. uPA substrate at a final concentration 
of 50nM in DMSO was incubated with various quantities of rhinocerase or buffer as a 
control for one hour at 37C in 100mM Tris.CI pH 7.4. The fluorescence was measured 
as descnbed earlier. 
4.2.9.6 Platelet aggregation assay 
Human blood was obtained from a consenting drug-free donor immediately prior to 
experiments. 50ml of blood were drawn into a syringe containing 3m1 of 4% (w/v) 
sodium citrate and 7m1 of acid citrate dextrose (ACD) were added prior to separation of 
the whole blood in 4m1 test tubes by centrifugation at 100g for 20 minutes at room 
temperature to obtain platelet rich plasma (pRP). Platelets were isolated from the PRP 
by centrifugation at 1400g for 10 minutes in the presence of 5Ong/ml of prostaglandin h 
(POI2) to prevent platelet activation. The platelet pellet was resuspended and washed in 
1'. 25ml of modified Tyrodes-HEPES buffer (134mM NaCI, 2.9mM KCI. 0.34mM 
Na2HP04, 12mM NaHC03, ImM MgCh, 20mM HEPES and 5mM glucose, pH 7.3) 
and 3ml of ACD in the presence of 50nglml PGh by centrifugation at 1400g for 10 
minutes. Finally the platelets were resuspended in lml of modified Tyrodes-HEPES 
buffer and the platelet number was determined using a Z2 Coulter particle count and 
size analyser (Beckman Coulter) before being adjusted to the required density. Platelets 
were rested at 30C for 30 minutes prior to the experiment. 
450Jll of platelets at a density of 4x108 cells/ml were pre-warmed at 37C for 90 
seconds prior to the addition of 100Jlg of rhinocerase in a siliconised cuvette in an 
optical platelet aggregometer (Chrono-Log Corporation, Havertown, PA, USA) with 
continuous stirring (1200g). Platelet aggregation was measured as described by Born 
(1962), using light transmission through the sample, which changes corresponding to 
shape change and aggregation. The changes in the light transmission were monitored 
using a chart recorder .

4.2.10 Effect of inhibitors on rhinocerase activity 
4.2.10.1 Effect of PMSF on rhinocerase activity 
Various concentrations (lmM, 2mM, 3mM, 4mM and 5mM) of PM SF in DMSO were 
incubated with IOU of thrombin or 100Jlg ofrhinocerase at 37C for 30 minutes. After 
incubation the fluorescent substrate BAAMC in DMSO was added at a final 
concentration of 50nM and incubated at 37C for one hour and the fluorescence was 
measured. 
4.2.10.2 Effect of benzamidine on rhinocerase activity 
1m of rhinocerase at a final concentration of lmg/m was passed through a 
benzamidine affinity column very slowly (O.lmlImin flow rate) and the elute was 
collected to analyse the binding. Then a gradient salt buffer was used to remove the 
bound proteins from the column and fractions were collected at a flow rate of 
Im1lminute. The chromatogram was monitored to analyse the absorbance of proteins 
during binding and elution. 1 DOJlI of fractions obtained from the column were run on 
I ()O/O reducing SDS-P AGE. 
4.3 Results 
4.3.1 Protein profile of crude Bitis gabonica rhinoceros venom 
SDS-PAGE was used to identify the number of proteins present in the crude venom of 
Bitis gabonica rhinoceros and their molecular weights (figure 4.1). Approximately 21 
bands of varying intensities were identified. The molecular weights of these proteins 
vary between 10kDa and 150kDa. 8 proteins between 25kDa and 40kDa were visible, a 
region where serine proteases have been reported.

4.3.2 Serine protease assay for crude Bitis gabonica venom 
Results of the BAAMC fluorescence assay for crude venom, various concentrations of 
trypsin and a control sample are shown in figure 4.2. As expected, the curve for the 
control sample indicates no fluorescence. Fluorescence measurements for the crude 
venom and for trypsin gradually rise to a constant level. This shows that there is indeed 
serine protease activity in the crude venom. The estimated amount of fluorescence of 
500J..lg of crude venom was calculated as equivalent to 102J..lg of pure trypsin under the 
same experimental conditions. This result indicates the presence of active serine 
proteases in the crude venom of Bitis gabonicQ rhinoceros as this fluorescent substrate 
is highly specific for these enzymes.

4.3.3 Purification of 36kDa protease 
4.3.3.1 Combination of gel nItration and ion exchange chromatography methods 
Separation using a 16mm x 100em Sephacryl HR 200 gel filtration column produced 
fractions containing a protein with an appropriate molecular weight for serine proteases 
(36kDa) along with a number of other proteins. Following further purification using a 
lOmm x 5em DEAE (Diethyl aminoethyl) cellulose column, there were 2 other proteins 
contaminating the 36kDa protein preparation. Attempts to remove the contaminating 
proteins with molecular weight cut-off filters were not successful. Purification using 
DEAE cellulose column followed by Sephacryl HR 200 gel filtration produced similar 
results. 
4.3.3.2 Benzamidine affinity purification 
Benzamidine is a reversible competitive inhibitor of trypsin-like serine proteases, as it 
binds to the catalytic serine of these enzymes. This has been used widely in several 
assays of serine proteases. Benzamidine has also been shown to be a potent inhibitor of 
some VVSPs. For example, benzamidine was shown to bind strongly to a protein C 
activator (ACC-C), a VVSP from the venom of Agkistrodon acutus (Murakami et al., 
2005). A benzamidine affinity column has been designed by GE Healthcare, UK. 
specifically for the purification of serine proteases. We attempted to use a Iml 
benzamidine column to purify serine proteases from Bitis gabonica rhinoceros venom, 
but little or no protein was detected during elution, suggesting that the serine proteases 
in this venom do not bind benzamidine. 
4.3.3.3 Mini-Prep cell purification 
A Mini-Prep cell was designed by Bio-Rad using the principle of preparative tube 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for purification of proteins based on their 
electrophoretic separation. This method was used to try to separate the serine proteases 
from the venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros. As the serine proteases were required for 
further analysis, the non-reducing sample treatment buffer was used to treat the proteins 
prior to loading. But the mobility of proteins under non-reducing conditions was very 
low and a single run of the separation lasted for more than 24 hours. The amount of 
(t. protein which could be loaded per run was only 100J1g and thus yield of specific 
proteins was very low. For all these reasons, we did not proceed further with this 
method. 
4.3.3.4 Rotofor purification 
Liquid phase isoelectric focusing using a microrotofor separates proteins based on their 
isoelectric points. Using this method with ampholytes (PI 3-10) under reducing and 
denaturing conditions, the venom proteins were well separated over 10 fractions (data 
not shown) but the serine protease (BAAMC hydrolysing) activity of these fractions 
were lost completely as the proteins were denatured by using reducing agent in the 
rotofor buffer. But when we used ampholytes with pI 6-8 under non-denaturing and 
non-reducing conditions, proteins were well separated with high serine protease 
(BAAMC hydrolysing) activity in fraction 3 and 4 (figure 4.3). 
Fractions 3 and 4 were pooled and loaded onto a gel filtration column. 5 well isolated 
peaks (PI, P2, P3, P4 and PS) were identified along with a larger peak at the end (which 
may contain the low molecular weight urea and thiourea) (figure 4.4a). For the first 
peak 3 fractions were selected. One fraction (pI.I) as the curve rises, one (pI.2) at the 
top with bigh absorbance and one (P 1.3) as the curve drops. Serine protease activity was 
measured for peaks PI.I-PI.3 and P2-PS. The results show that highest serine protease 
activity was in peak P2 (figure 4.4b). The silver stained gel shows a protein with 
molecular weight 36kDa in pure form in this peak (figure 4.4c). We have named this 
new purified protease with serine protease activity as rhinocerase. 5mg of crude Bitis 
gabonica rhinoceros venom yielded 1.12mg ofrhinocerase based on the Bradford assay 
and 1.3mg based on the quantitative assay using 10% SDS-P AGE.

4.3.4 Effect of detergents on rhinocerase activity 
Detergents are generally used to solubilise complex hydrophobic or lipophilic proteins 
such as membrane proteins. Since CHAPS {3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl) 
dimethylammonio ]-l-propanesulfonate} is used in the microrotofor purification method 
to prevent the precipitation of proteins during separation, we performed a test to 
determine whether CHAPS affects the rhinocerase serine protease activity. CHAPS is a 
zwitterionic detergent with neutral charge and we compared the effect of this detergent 
on activity with the effect of the anionic detergent SDS. CHAPS shows no effect on 
rhinocerase activity but, 1% (w/v) SDS inhibits the activity of rhinocerase completely 
(figure 4.5). Thus we have decided to use CHAPS for any further analysis which 
requires detergents.

Concentrations of detergents

concentrations of these detergents were used to see whether they have any effects 
on rhinocerase activity. CHAPS showed no effect until 5% but SDS completely 
inhibited rhinocerase activity at 1 % concentration. 
4.3.5 Glycoprotein detection 
As it has been reported that several VVSPs are glycosylated (Markland et aI. , 1996; Zhu 
et aI. , 2005), experiments were performed to determine whether the rhinocerase present 
in the venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros is glycosylated. The results of glycoprotein 
detection in pure rhinocerase of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros venom show that it is 
glycosylated (figure 4.68 lane 1). Thus, deglycosylation was performed on pure 
rhinocerase using N Glycosidase and the resulting samples were run in 10% SDS-
PAGE along with N Glycosidase. Figure 4.6 (A) compares the molecular weights of 
glycosylated and deglycosylated proteins. The estimated molecular weight of 
deglycosylated protein is approximately 31kDa. Thus around 5kDa (14%) of the 36kDa 
molecular weight of the purified protein is due to glycosylation. Figure 4.6 (8) lane 2 
shows the results of glycosylation detection on the deglycosylated protein. The lack of 
any visible band indicates that the protein has been completely deglycosylated. These 
experiments show that, like other venom serine proteases, rhinocerase is glycosylated.

PAGE gel containing these samples. 
4.3.6 ImmuDoblotting of rhinocerase 
~ Immunoblotting of glycosylated and deglycosylated rhinocerase with anti-serum raised 
against the gel slices of rhinocerase indicates the binding of the antibody with this 
protein both in glycosylated and deglycosylated fonns (figure 4.7 A). 
Rotofor fractions (PI 5-7) of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros venom (figure 4.7B) were used 
to test whether the anti-serum raised against rhinocerase binds only with rhinocerase or 
also to other proteins. The immunoblot showed that the rhinocerase present in fractions 
2, 3 and 4 bound to this anti-serum (figure 4.7C). In addition to this, other proteins 
present in fractions 5, 6, 7 and 8 also bound to the anti-serum. These proteins had 
molecular weights between 25kDa and 50kDa. In addition one protein with a molecular 
weight of around 15kDa (figure 4.7C lane 3) reacted with the anti-serum. This might be 
a partial serine protease (might have some internal deletions) or an unknown protein 
which is similar to serine proteases present in the venom. No cross-reactivity was found 
with proteins with molecular weights more than 50kDa. 
To test whether the binding of the proteins in rotofor fractions 1-8 is due only to the 
antibodies raised against rhinocerase or to other contaminating antibodies present in the 
anti-serum preparation, the anti-serum was pre-absorbed with pure rhinocerase. This 
would saturate the anti-rhinocerase antibodies but not other antibodies in the anti-serum. 
The pre-absorbed anti-serum was then used to detect bands in a similar immunoblot 
with rotofor fractions 1-9. The only bands present are faint bands corresponding to 
rhinocerase in fraction 4 and additional faint bands due to other proteins (which might 
be serine proteases) in fractions 5 and 7 (figure 4.7D). These results suggest that there 
are few antibodies in the anti-serum which do not bind to rhinocerase. The slight 
appearance of bands in figure 4.7D indicates that more rhinocerase is needed to 
completely saturate the anti-rhinocerase antibodies. However purification of anti-
rhinocerase antibodies from the anti-serum using rhinocerase bound affinity columns is 
needed to properly determine the range of proteins bound by anti-rhinocerase 
antibodies. 
Thus antibody production using polyacrylamide gel slices was successful and produced 
~ antibodies against rhinocerase which also bind to other venom proteins, most of which 
might be serine proteases based on their molecular weights. It is possible that this 
antibody reacts with serine proteases in general in Bitis gabonica rhinoceros venom, 
though the identity of the 15kDa protein remains unknown.

4.3.7 Partial sequencing by Edman degradation 
N-tenninal sequencing of the undigested protein, together with 4 of the digested 
fragments yielded 89 residues, which comprise 38% ofthe mature protein. The resulting 
fragments' sequences were aligned with the Bitis gabonica serine protease 1 (NCBI 
accession number: AAR24534) (BGSP), which is the only serine protease sequence 
published for this venom. The alignment (figure 4.8) shows high similarity between 
these two sequences, though the two proteins are clearly distinct.

not contain the classical serine protease catalytic triad (H57-DI02-S195) and has 
substitutions at positions 57 and 195. 
4.3.8 Q-TOF analysis 
The mass data obtained from the Q-TOF analysis of rhinocerase was searched using the 
Mascot server and the best matched hit was found to be a serine protease Elegaxobin I 
from Trimeresurus elegans. This suggests that the rhinocerase might be a serine 
protease, though we have not obtained the sequence at position 195. The sequence of a 
short trypsin digested peptide was found to be 'TLCAGVLEGGKD' and these residues 
(shown as red in figure 4.8) were the same as part of the sequence identified using 
Edman degradation. 
4.3.9 Crystallisation of rhinocerase 
Crystallisation screening was performed using a protein concentration of 9mg/ml with 
the commercial kits Wizard J and II, Macrosol J and JI, and SFS J and II. A few very 
small (less than Imm in size) rectangular shaped crystals were found in Wizard J nO.20 
(crystallant: 400mM NaH2POJI.6M K2HP04, buffer: 100mM imidazole pH 8 and salt: 
200mM NaCI) after 2 weeks of incubation at room temperature; these were confmned 
as protein crystals using the Izit crystal dye (figure 4.9). Attempts are being made to 
grow larger crystals in order to solve the structure of this protein.

4.3.10 Functional characterization of rhinocerase 
Some VVSPs have been reported to have more than one function. However most of the 
functionally known VVSPs have not been screened for all of the functions, only the 
ones authors have expected. Thus the complete functional infonnation for many VVSPs 
still remains unknown. In order to find out the various functions of rhinocerase, it has 
been screened for all of the known VVSP functions. 
4.3.10.1 Plasma clotting activity 
Plasma was clotted rapidly by all concentrations of thrombin within a few seconds of 
recalcification. The venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros made a weak and easily 
dispersible plasma clot fonned of particulate materials in 9 minutes. No visible clots 
were fonned with rhinocerase or the negative control even after incubating overnight. 
Thus, rhinocerase does not exhibit plasma clotting activity, though there must be 
another component in the venom which has this function. 
4.3.10.2 Fibrinogenolytic activity 
Rhinocerase was found to degrade one (chain A) of the two chains of fibrinogen (figure 
4.10). This might correspond to the Aa chain of fibrinogen. The degradation was 
detectable after 1 hour of incubation with rhinocerase and gradually degraded chain A 
completely. Chain B of fibrinogen was not degraded. Two new protein chains (chain C 
and D) appeared as the incubation time increases. However rhinocerase did not cause 
the fonnation of a fibrin clot even after 3 hours. Thus the role of rhinocerase in the 
venom might be to reduce the amount of fibrinogen by degrading one of the chains in 
order to inhibit the blood clotting at the bite site and to cause continuous bleeding (this 
is one of the symptoms of this snake bite). 
However the gel image of thrombin-digested fibrinogen was found to be completely 
different from that of rhinocerase-digested fibrinogen. Thrombin hydrolysed both 
chains of fibrinogen producing a fibrin clot.

4.3.10.3 Fibrinolytic assay 
Rhinocerase completely dissolved the plasma clot generated by thrombin after 
incubating overnight. The control clot remained undissolved. This shows that 
rhinocerase has fibrinolytic activity. 
Rhinocerase activity on the plasmin substrate confinns the direct fibrinolytic action of 
this enzyme (figure 4.11). Fluorescence increases with the quantity of rhinocerase 
added. No activity was seen in the control sample with no enzyme present. The figures 
are mean values from 2 independent experiments.

4.3.10.5 Plasminogen activator activity 
Rhinocerase did not show any effects on the uPA (urokinase plasminogen activator) 
substrate. But interestingly the crude venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros does show 
low activity on the uPA substrate (figure 4.13). This suggests the presence of one or 
more other serine proteases with plasminogen activator activity in this venom.

4.3.10.6 Platelet aggregation activity 
Rhinocerase was found to be incapable of stimulating platelet aggregation. This assay 
was repeated several times using blood from several donors but no aggregation was 
found. 
The functional characterisation indicates that rhinocerase is a multi functional enzyme 
with a-fibrinogenolytic, fibrinolytic and kininogenase activities. Further to this, the 
venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros displayed plasma clotting and low levels of 
plasminogen activator activities. This suggests the presence of additional senne 
proteases (or maybe other enzymes) with different functions in this venom. 
4.3.11 Effect of inhibitors on rhinocerase activity 
Snake venom serine proteases have been reported to be sensitive to some but not all 
serine protease inhibitors. In order to fmd out the sensitivity of rhinocerase to serine 
protease inhibitors, we tested the effects of two inhibitors. 
4.3.11.1 Effect of PMSF on rhinocerase 
PMSF (Phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride) at a concentration between I mM and 2mM is 
sufficient to inhibit the activity of IOU of thrombin. The assay was repeated with 
concentrations of PMSF between I mM and 2mM and it was found that 1.2mM of 
PMSF was enough to inhibit thrombin activity completely. The 100llg of rhinocerase 
activity was inhibited by PMSF at a concentration between 2mM and 3mM and the 
repeated experiment showed that 2.3mM of PMSF was enough to inhibit the 
rhinocerase activity completely (figure 4. 14). Comparison of thrombin and rhinocerase 
activity shows that 100llg ofrhinocerase activity is equal to only 4.05 units of thrombin 
and thus rhinocerase is less sensitive to PMSF than thrombin.

4.3.11.2 Effect of benzamidine on rhinocerase 
To check the effect of benzamidine on rhinocerase we used a benzamidine affmity 
column. The benzamidine column shows very little affmity towards rhinocerase as the 
protein passed through the column without binding, indicated by the increased 
absorbance (figure 4.15). Fractions were collected when the protein was passing 
through the column. During elution with the low pH buffer gradient, a very small peak 
was observed. The fractions (concentrated to reduce the sample volume and increase the 
protein quantity) were run on SOS-PAGE. The gels indicate no protein during elution 
but the presence of rhinocerase in the eluate collected during binding (data not shown). 
This suggests that benzamidine is not an inhibitor for rhinocerase. This result coincides 
with the result we obtained when attempting to purify the serine proteases from crude 
venom using the same column.

4.4 Discussion 
A novel highly abundant serine protease-like enzyme, rhinocerase, has been purified in 
electrophoretically homogenous form from the venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros 
using liquid phase isoelectric focussing (rotofor) and gel filtration methods. This is the 
first time that a rotofor has been used to purify a serine protease-like enzyme from 
snake venom. Traditional purification methods such as gel filtration, ion exchange and 
affinity chromatography did not yield pure serine proteases. It seems that the serine 
proteases in this venom do not bind benzamidine, thus affinity chromatography was 
unsuccessful. The effect of benzamidine on rhinocerase activity was consistent with 
these results. As the benzamidine did not bind with rhinocerase, it is not clear whether 
the rhinocerase contain serine (position 195) at the catalytic site. However rhinocerase 
was inhibited by PMSF which is another potent inhibitor of serine proteases which 
binds specifically to the catalytic serine. These results show that rhinocerase might have 
serine at its catalytic site but we have decided to name the protein a serine protease-like 
enzyme as it showed serine protease activity and the partial sequence matched with 
other venom serine proteases. Further sequencing is necessary to confirm whether the 
protein in fact a serine protease. 
Gel filtration, used either before or after ion exchange chromatography separates 
proteins based on their molecular weight and charge respectively. As there are several 
closely related proteins with similar molecular weights and charge to rhinocerase, using 
these methods to separate rhinocerase was unsuccessful. The isoelectric focussing 
technique has the advantage of being able to separate proteins even with small pI 
differences and the use of detergents to prevent the precipitation of proteins during 
separation may have helped this purification. The lack of effect of CHAPS on the 
activity of rhinocerase indicates that it is appropriate to use this detergent in this 
purification method. However the yield of protein is very low as the microrotofor can 
accommodate only Img of proteins to be separated. This means that it needs to be 
repeated many times to obtain sufficient protein e.g. for crystallisation. The use of 
detergents and glycerol in this method is also not conducive to good crystallisation as 
they prevent protein aggregation. Thus far attempts to crystallise this protein have 
yielded only small crystals and improvements to the purification method may help in 
our attempts to crystallise and solve the structure of this protein. For example a 
minirotofor or rotofor could be used to purify larger amounts of proteins. 
Rhinocerase is clearly distinct from the serine proteases previously identified in the 
venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros. The molecular weight of rhinocerase was found to 
be 36kDa and this did not match with that of any of the other known Bitis gabonica 
serine proteases. The deglycosylated rhinocerase showed a molecular weight about 
31kDa according to its mobility in 10% SDS-PAGE. 3 serine proteases have been 
isolated from Bitis gabonica venom with approximate molecular weights of 32kDa 
based on gel chromatography (Viljoen et al., 1979). Pirkle et ale (1986) isolated another 
serine protease, gabonase, with an estimated molecular weight of 32kDa based on SDS-
PAGE. As these reports did not mention the subspecies of the snake, it is unclear 
whether they have used Bitis gabonica gabonica or Bitis gabonica rhinoceros as we 
have used. But either way, the rhinocerase is novel as it has a clearly distinct molecular 
weight 
The estimated pI of rhinocerase was approximately 6 and again this did not match with 
the one serine protease sequenced completely from Bitis gabonica which had a pI of 8.5 
(Francischetti et al., 2004). The slightly acidic nature of rhinocerase could playa role in 
its substrate specificities, binding and functions. 
The N-terminal sequence of rhinocerase was obtained by Edman degradation and this 
matches with the partial N-terminal sequences of BG-8 (Francischetti et al., 2004) and 
peptide 21 (Calvete et al., 2007) reported previously. Although not mentioned in their 
paper, these comparisons suggest that Francischetti et a1. (2004) also used Bitis 
gabonica rhinoceros rather than Bitis gabonica gabonica. 
Rhinocerase was found to be highly glycosylated. The molecular weights of venom 
serine proteases seem to vary mainly due to their carbohydrate contents as they all have 
a similar number of amino acids i.e. 230-235 in their primary structure (Castro et al., 
2004). VVSPs are generally found to be highly glycosylated. For example, the 3 serine 
proteases isolated from the venom of Bitis gabonica were reported to have 
glycosylation corresponding to 20-25% of their original (unglycosylated) molecular 
weight (ViIjoen et al., 1979), a coagulant enzyme from Agkistrodon rhodostoma was 
reported to have glycosylation corresponding to 29% of its original molecular weight 
(Hatton, 1973) and a kininogenase from Vipera ammodytes ammodytes was reported to 
have glycosylation corresponding to between 18 and 20% of its molecular weight 
(Baileyet al., 1976). 
Rhinocerase was found to have three functions: fibrinogenolytic, fibrinolytic and 
kininogenase. To our knowledge, rhinocerase is the first enzyme in snake venom to 
have 3 functions. The functions of this enzyme show its broad spectrum specificities 
against various substrates. Clotting activity was previously reported for the purified 
protein gabonase in Bitis gabonica venom (pirkle et al., 1986). Three serine proteases 
(E I to E III) isolated from this venom have showed kinin releasing activity (E I), very 
low kinin releasing and high fibrinolytic activities (E II) and low clotting activity (E III) 
(Vtljoen et al., 1979). Marsh et al. (1974) reported 2 thrombin-like enzymes, one with 
rapid defibrinating activity and another with a weak defibrinating activity. Some VVSPs 
from other snakes have been found to have two functions. For example crotalase, a 
thrombin-like enzyme is reported to have both clotting and kininogenase activities 
(Markland et al., 1982) andjararacussin (Bortoleto et at., 2002), a thrombin like enzyme 
from Trimeresurus jlavoviridis (Komari et al., 2002) and kangshuanmeni from 
Agkistrodon halys brevicaudus (Zhang et al., 200 1) are some of the serine prot eases 
which have both a and B fibrinogenolytic activities. 
The functions of rhinocerase are consistent with the envenomation effects caused by 
Bitis gabonica rhinocerase such as hypotension (related to kininogenase activity), 
clotting disorders (relates to fibrinogenolytic activity) and bleeding disorders (related to 
fibrinolytic activities) though there are many other enzymes (other serine proteases, 
metalloproteases, phospholipases, etc.) present in this venom which could cause any of 
these effects. Marsh et at. (1974) reported that the venom of Bitis gabonica causes rapid 
defibrination together with wide spread haemorrhage, cardiac and pulmonary damage. 
As the venom of Bitis gabonica rhinocerase makes a very weak dispersible plasma clot, 
it could be involved in the reduction of fibrinogen levels in plasma and thus induce 
clotting disorders. Rhinocerase does not make the plasma clot but hydrolyses a chain 
(maybe Aa) of fibrinogen and releases fibrinopeptides. 
We have purified rhinocerase and partially characterised its functions. Further 
functional analysis including factor V, VIII, XIII activator assays, protein C activator 
assay and capillary permeability assay need to be performed to completely characterise 
the functions of this enzyme. The complete sequence of this protein also needs to be 
determined to understand how the multi-functionality relates to the amino acid sequence 
and confirm the presence of serine at catalytic site in order to name this enzyme as 
serine protease. Ultimately the specificity and functions can only be understood once 
the structure is determined. Thus further efforts to crystallise this protein are necessary. 
Several well characterised snake venom proteins have been used to treat haemostatic 
disorders. Rhinocerase may possibly be useful for developing therapeutics for treating 
haemostatic disorders but its multifunctional activity may make this difficult. As this is 
an abundant and active protein in the venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros, it would be 
interesting to explore whether inhibitors designed for this protein might be useful in 
treating snake bites. These inhibitors might be designed based on the structure of PM SF. 
The analysis of other inhibitors such as heparin, hirudin, etc. would also help in 
identifying possible approaches to design the inhibitors for this protein.

from the venom gland cDNAs of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros 
5. 1 Introduction 
In the previous chapter, the purification and partial amino acid sequencing of a protease 
with serine protease activity called rhinocerase from the venom of Bitis gabonica 
rhinoceros was described. Complete amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation or 
mass spectrometry methods is time consuming and expensive, and this was the primary 
reason for attempting to clone the cDNA and amplify and sequence the gene for this 
enzyme. Furthermore the partial amino acid sequence is unreliable for identifying serine 
protease isoforms from the venom of a snake because of the extensive sequence 
conservation between their sequences. A full amino acid sequence would allow 
comparison with the only other known Bitis gabonica serine protease sequence 
published by Francischetti et aI. (2004). This sequence is unusual in that it lacks two of 
the residues of the catalytic triad: histidine 57, which is substituted by arginine 57 and 
serine 195, which is substituted by asparagine 195. Thus it is not known whether it is a 
functional serine protease. 
A molecular biology approach also offers the possibility of identifying and sequencing 
other genes encoding Bitis gabonica rhinoceros serine proteases. Francischetti et aI. 
(2004) reported the presence of 8 different serine protease contigs in the venom gland 
transcriptome of Bitis gabonica, using partial DNA sequencing data Calvete et aI. 
(2007) have reported the presence of 5 different serine proteases through N-terminal 
sequencing of peptides isolated from reverse phase HPLC from the venom of Bitis 
gabonica rhinoceros. As mentioned in the previous chapter, Francischetti et aI. (2004) 
did not specify the subspecies of Bitis gabonica they used but Calvete et aI. (2007), like 
ourselves used Bitis gabonica rhinoceros. 
Many viper venoms contain multiple serine protease isofonns. For example, Zhu et al. 
(2005) isolated, sequenced and crystallised 2 serine proteases from the venom of 
Deinagkistrodon acutus. These enzymes differ in sequence by just one amino acid, but 
have different kinetics of amidolytic and fibrinogenolytic functions. They also differ in 
glycosylation which is known to playa role in their functions and inhibitor binding. The 
results of the previous chapter, together with the work of Francischetti et al. (2004) and 
Calvete et al. (2007), suggest that Bitis gabonica too has more than one serine protease. 
Comparison of nucleotide and protein sequences of the different serine protease 
isoforms present in this snake venom may yield useful insight into the evolution of 
these enzymes. In this chapter we describe attempts to peR amplify, sub-clone, 
sequence and characterise all the serine proteases encoded by the venom glands of Bitis 
gabonica rhinoceros. 
5.2 Methods 
Venom gland extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed as described in chapter 2. 
Specific primers were designed to amplify the serine protease genes in Bins gabonica 
rhinoceros venom gland cDNAs based on the Hitis gabonica serine protease I sequence 
(NCB I accession nmnber; AAR24534) published by Francischetti et ale (2004). In order 
to obtain the complete gene sequences, the 5' primer was designed for the signal peptide 
region and the 3' primer was designed for the 3' untranslated region surrounding the 
gene. The designed primers are: upper primer- 5'TGGTGTfGATCAGAGTGCf3' and 
lower primer- 5' ACAGAAGTACCAATAGAAGAGAA T3'. 
The PCR (20 cycles), agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA elution from the gels, TOPO 
TA cloning, plasmid isolation and sequencing analysis were performed as described in 
chapter 2. 
The number of PCR errors was estimated for every amplified sequence according to 
Cox et ale (1994). The formula used to estimate the number of errors in a sequence is:-
Number of errors = No. of nucleotides x no. of PCR cycles x 5 x 10s 
Nucleotide sequences were translated using DNAST AR Lasergene version 7 (Burland, 
2ooo). Multiple sequence alignment and pairwise alignments were perfonned as 
described in chapter 2. The structure based protein sequence alignment was performed 
using the FUGUE alignment tool (Shi et al., 2001). 
5.3 Results 
5.3.1 peR amplification of serine protease genes in venom gland cDNAs 
To identify and amplify all the serine protease genes in the Bitis gabonica rhinoceros 
venom glands, primers were designed for regions which were unlikely to be conserved 
in all serine protease isoforms. Thus, the upstream primer was designed for the signal 
peptide region and the downstream primer was designed for the 3' untranslated region. 
peR amplification with this primer pair resulted in two distinct bands with differing 
molecular weights (figure 5.1). The estimated molecular weights of these two amplified 
products are around 1200bp for the high molecular weight band and around 900bp for 
the low molecular weight band. All three aliquots (lane 4-6) of reactions with serine 
protease primers were amplified similarly. The amplified products were pooled and run 
in a preparative agarose gel and the bands were excised and cloned into a TOPO T A 
cloning vector system.

5.3.2 Restriction digestion of recombinant plasmids 
In . total 26 ' nigh molecular weight band' and 20 ' low molecular weight band' 
recombinant colonies were isolated and cultured. The plasmid DNAs were purified and 
subjected to EcoRI digestion and the digested products were visualized using 1 % 
agarose gel electrophoresis which confirmed the presence of inserted target DNA 
(figure 5.2). Non-recombinant plasmids were identified as the linearized plasmids 
showing a single band of 4kbp. The remaining recombinant plasmids were sent for 
sequencing using both M13 forward and reverse primers as the TOPO vector contains 
these sites at positions flanking the multi cloning site (MCS).

plasmid seems to have a lower molecular weight compared to other plasm ids (it 
may be coiled or supercoiled). The upper molecular weight band represents the 
plasmid DNA and the lower molecular weight band represents the inserted DNA 
released by EcoRI digestion. 
5.3.3 Nucleotide sequence analysis 
Two isofonns (BGHSP 1 and BGHSP2 - Bitis gabonica high molecular weight serine 
proteases) were identified from the high molecular weight band and seven isofonns 
(BGLSPI-BGLSP7 - Bins gabonica low molecular weight serine proteases) were 
identified and sequenced from the low molecular weight band. 7 identical clones were 
identified and sequenced for BGHSPI and 8 for BGLSPI. For the remaining isofonns, 
only one clone was identified and so this was sequenced twice to confirm the sequence. 
Thus this confirms the presence of two groups of sequences; one from the higher 
molecular weight band representing BGHSP 1 and another one from lower molecular 
weight band represented by BGLSP 1. 
The basic features of the BGHSP and BGLSP cDNAs are shown in table 5.1 and an 
alignment of these sequences is shown in figure 5.3 and 5.4 respectively. All the 
BGLSPs are 906 nuc1eotides in length, except BGLSP7 which has an internal deletion 
of 96 nuc1eotides, so this is only 810 nuc1eotides. The lengths of BGHSPs are between 
1137 and 1179 nucleotides, around 200 nucleotides more than the BGLSPs as we had 
estimated from the agarose gel of the peR products. BGHSPs contain these additional 
nucleotides in the 3' untranslated region (figure 5.3).

Figure 5.4 Nucleotide sequence alignment of BGLSPs obtained using ClustalW 
multiple sequence alignment tool. The stars indicate the conserved nucleotides. 
The conserved residues are shaded to show the substitutions clearly. 
As several clones yielded the sequences for BGHSPI and BGLSPI, these are likely to 
be true sequences without any peR or sequencing errors. But there may be PCR 
induced errors in the other sequences as we have used Taq DNA polymerase which 
doesn't have any proof reading activity. Since some of these differ only slightly from 
each other in sequence, we have estimated the possible number of PCR errors for each 
amplified sequence as described by Cox et ale (1994). The BGHSP sequences were 
compared with BGHSPI (figure 5.3) and BGLSPs were compared with BGLSPI 
(figure 5.4) as BGHSPI and BGLSPI have been confirmed by more than one sequence. 
As BGHSPs have a 3' extension of around 200 nucleotides which has several insertions 
and deletions and some of the nucleotides were not identified clearly due to the 
problems with automated DNA sequencing beyond 800-900 nucleotides, these 
extensions were not included in the PCR error analysis. Thus as for BGLSPs, only 906 
nuc1eotides (to the 3' end of BGLSPs) of BGHSPs were included in this analysis. As 
each sequence was obtained from pooled PCR products of 3 individual reactions each 
amplified with 20 cycles, the total number of PCR cycles was taken as 60 for estimating 
PCRerrors. 
The number of nucleotide substitutions and estimated number of PCR errors for each 
sequence are shown in table 5.2.

Table 5.2 Number of nucleotide substitutions and possible peR errors for each 
sequence of BGHSP and BGLSP isoforms. NI A represents not applicable. The 
number of nucleotide substitutions for BGHSPl is calculated relative to BGHSPI. 
The numben of nucleotide substitutions for BGLSPl-BGLSP7 are calculated 
relative to BGLSPI. 
As BGHSPI and BGLSPI had only 61 % of sequence identity, over 150 substitutions 
and were obtained from different molecular weight bands of peR amplified products, 
they are clearly distinct. BGHSP2 has 37 substitutions relative to BGHSPI which far 
exceeds the estimated number of errors induced by PCR i.e. 3. Thus this sequence is 
clearly distinct from BGHSP I. Similarly BGLSP2 with 20 substitutions is clearly 
distinct from BGLSP I. 
However, the differences between the sequences ofBGLSP3 to BGLSP6 and BGLSPI 
are comparable to the estimated PCR errors, and thus further research (may be the use 
of Pfu DNA polymerase with proof reading activity) is necessary to confirm whether 
these are in fact distinct sequences. Although BGLSP7 has one nucleotide substitution 
which could be an error, it also has a large internal deletion of 96 nucleotides. So it is 
not clear whether this is a unique isofonn or an error caused by slipping of Taq 
polymerase during the polymerisation. Again, only one clone with this sequence was 
identified and thus sequencing of further similar clones is necessary. Other researchers 
identified several VVSPs with very few nucleotide changes in viper venom (Zhu et al., 
2005), so it is possible that all 9 isoforms actually occur in the Bitis gabonica 
rhinoceros venom gland. Further sequencing of clones is necessary to confinn this. 
5.3.4 Amino acid sequence analysis 
A structure based alignment for all of our sequences together with a determined 
structure of protein C activator (PDB code: 2AIQ) from the venom of Agkistrodon 
acutus was created by using the FUGUE sequence alignment tool to show the variations 
in individual sequences with respect to the structure (figure 5.5). 
The predicted molecular weight of the proteins encoded by these genes varies between 
23 and 28kDa (table 5.1). BGLSP proteins have very similar molecular weights, around 
26.3kDa with the exception of BGLSP6, which has a higher molecular weight owing to 
its C-tenninal extension of 14 amino acids (figure 5.5). BGLSP7 has a lower molecular 
weight due to its internal deletion of 32 amino acids (figure 5.5). The molecular weight 
of the BGHSP-encoded proteins is also around 26kDa, since the additional nucleotides 
in their cDNA are in the 3' untranslated region. BGHSPI has a very slightly lower 
molecular weight than BGHSP2 as it has an internal deletion of 2 amino acids. Thus, 
despite differences in the nucleotide number of the PCR amplicons, the basic length of 
mature protein encoded by these genes is 236 amino acids. In addition, gene sequences 
position the same signal peptide sequence of 17 amino acids and the same sequence for 
the 6 amino acid activation motif at the N-terminus. 
All 9 proteins have inferred isoelectric points greater than 7.5 (table 5.1). The BGHSPs 
have higher isoelectric points than the BGLSPs. Consistent with this, they have 
markedly lower acidic amino acid content and higher polar amino acids than the 
BGLSPs. Within the BGLSPs, the pIs are very similar, except for the longer BGLSP6 
which has a slightly higher pI and the shorter BGLSP7 which has a slightly lower pI. 
The hydrophobic and basic amino acid contents are broadly similar in all BGHSPs and 
BGLSPs. All 9 proteins are predicted to have N-glycosylation sites, with a slightly 
higher number of predicted glycosylation sites in BGHSPs. 
The protein sequence of BGLSPI is identical to the previously published sequence of 
serine protease I (BGSP) from Bitis gabonica (Francischetti et aI., 2004) (figure 5.6). 
However the nucleotide sequence of BGLSP 1 shows a single substitution at position 
626 when compared with the sequence of BGSP (figure 5.7). 5 serine protease N-
tenninal sequences were reported by Calvete et al. (2007) from RP-HPLC purified 
fractions. Of these, their partial sequence from fraction 16 is identical with BGLSP 1-
BGLSP7 and BGHSP2 (figure 5.8a), their fractions 17 and 18 are identical with 
BGHSPI (figure 5.8b), their fraction 21 is identical to the partial sequence of our 
previously described rhinocerase (figure S.8c) and fraction 20 does not match with any 
of our sequences (figure 5.8d). Thus, this is clear that all of our sequences are consistent 
with previously published results and prove their consistency. Also these results 
indicate the presence of additional serine protease (s) in this venom as the sequence of 
fraction 20 (Calvete et al., 2007) does not match with any of our sequences.

S.3.S Comparison of amino acid sequences of isoforms 
Pairwise amino acid sequence alignments of BGHSPs and BGLSPs show high degrees 
of similarity between members of the same group (table 5.3). BGHSPs are 92% 
identical and BGLSPs are between 81.9% and 99.6% identical to each other. When 
BGHSPs are compared with BGLSPs' amino acid sequences, the identities are lower, 
varying between 52.9% and 75.7%. 
Variations between the BGHSP mature sequences (without signal and activation 
peptides) are confined to the first 40 amino acids at the N-terminus; beyond that the 
sequences are identical (figure 5.5). In contrast, the N-terminal amino acids in the 
BGLSPs are identical apart from a single histidine 42 into arginine 42 substitution in 
BGLSP3. The alignment shows several substitutions in BGLSP2, an internal deletion of 
32 amino acids in BGLSP7 and a C-tenninal extension of 14 amino acids in BGLSP6 
(figure 5.5). The remaining BGLSPs differ in only one or two amino acids. The 
structure based alignment shows that BGLSP7 lacks parts of 2 loops together with a B-
strand. The alignment shows no information about the C-terminal 14 amino acid 
extension of BGLSP6, as this is not present in protein C activator or in VVSPs in 
general. 
This study suggests that there might be a number of isoforms of serine proteases 
encoded by the Bitis gabonica rhinoceros venom glands, each showing a small number 
of amino acid differences and slightly different features. Furthermore there appears to 
be more than one group of isoforms within the venom glands of the single snake we 
used.

5.3.6 Analysis of amino acids involved in the catalytic and specificity sites 
The catalytic triad of serine proteases is important for providing the charge relay 
network system for catalysis of substrates into products. This consists of histidine at 
position 57 (chymotrypsinogen numbering), aspartic acid at position 102 and serine at 
position 195. The primary specificity pocket of serine proteases is thought to confer 
substrate specificity to the enzyme. Thus, in most venom serine proteases, the primary 
specificity pocket consists of aspartic acid at position 189, glycine 216 and glycine or 
alanine at position 226. These confer specificity towards arginine at the P I site of 
substrates. Thus these enzymes are also called arginine esterases. 
Francischetti et al. (2004) has reported a serine protease (BGSP) from the venom gland 
cDNA of Bitis gabonica with histidine 57 replaced by arginine and serine 195 replaced 
by asparagine. This sequence has been reported based on sequencing of only one clone. 
No functional analysis has been performed to confirm whether or not the protein was 
active. One of the objectives of our cDNA analysis was to identify and sequence a 
number of clones and investigate whether or not the standard catalytic triad is present. 
The protein sequence of our BGLSPI is same as BOSP but their nucleotide sequences 
show a single nucleotide substitution (Francischetti et al., 2004). Like the sequence of 
BGSP (Francischetti et al., 2004), all members of the BGLSP group have the histidine 
57 into arginine and serine 195 into asparagine substitutions (indicated by stars in figure 
5.4). 
At position 189, BGLSPs have aspartic acid (indicated by arrow in figure 5.4), which is 
a primary characteristic feature of arginine esterases, which are the typical thrombin-
like enzymes present in snake venom. As BGLSPs do not contain a classical catalytic 
triad, it is not clear whether these are inactive serine proteases or whether they act as 
arginine esterases using an unknown mechanism (discussed in detail in section 5.4). 
BGHSPs, in contrast, do have the classical serine protease catalytic triad amino acids 
histidine 57 and serine 195 in their primary structure (figure 5.5), indicating that the 
protein would function as a conventional serine protease via the standard catalytic 
mechanism. At position 189 they have glycine rather than aspartic acid (indicated by the 
arrow in figure 5.5). This might confer specificity towards large amino acids. Thus the 
BGHSPs should have serine protease activity but would be expected to have different 
specificity compared to arginine esterases. 
5.4 Discussion 
In this chapter, we have described the venom gland cDNA synthesis and PCR 
amplification of serine proteases from Bitis gabonica rhinoceros. The original aim of 
this research was to isolate and sequence the gene encoding the purified rhinocerase 
(described in chapter 4). But this was not possible by cDNA synthesis and PCR 
amplification with a single pair of primers. Thus, rhinocerase might have different 
sequences in the regions where we have designed the primers i.e. different signal and 3' 
untranslated regions. The lack of venom gland cDNA corresponding to rhinocerase 
indicates that more serine protease amplification should have been performed but this 
was not possible due to time constraints in this study. Our identification of possible 9 
distinct serine protease isoforms from a single PCR reaction with only a single primer 
pair emphasises the extraordinary diversity of the serine protease family in vipers and 
suggests that if we had the time to perform additional PCRs with different primer pairs, 
it is likely that we would have eventually isolated the cDNA matching the rhinocerase. 
We have obtained 9 complete serine protease sequences in this study, 7 from the lower 
molecular weight band (BGLSPs) and 2 from the higher molecular weight band 
(BGHSPs) of the PCR amplified product. As we have used Taq DNA polymerase, 
which has no proof reading activity for the amplification of cDNA and pooled 3 
individual PCR products each amplified with 20 cycles for cloning and sequencing, 
there are possibilities for PCR induced errors in our sequences. The sequences of 
BGHSP 1 and BGLSP 1 have confirmed by more than one clone, so these sequences are 
likely to be reliable, and they are clearly distinct from each other. The numbers of 
nucleotide substitutions in BGHSP2 and BGLSP2 are significantly greater than the 
estimated number of PCR errors, so these are also likely to be distinct sequences. 
BGLSP3 to BGLSP7 have much fewer nucleotide substitutions, so further sequencing is 
necessary to confirm whether these are distinct sequences or the results of PCR errors. 
However, BGLSP7 has an additional difference of a 96 nucleotide internal deletion -
again this may be a real difference or an error caused by slipping of the Taq DNA 
polymerase during the polymerisation. However, Zhu et aI. (2005) reported the presence 
of serine proteases with very few nucleotide substitutions in viper venom. Many viper 
venoms have several serine proteases, so it is certainly possible that the sequences we 
have determined represent distinct serine proteases in Biffs gabonica rhinoceros venom, 
though further sequencing needs to be done to confirm this. 
Like the cDNA sequences, the deduced protein sequences of the 9 serine proteases fall 
into 2 groups: 7 BGLSPs (serine protease homologs with substitutions in the catalytic 
triad) and 2 BGHSPs (serine proteases with classical catalytic triads). The sequences 
within each group have more similarities with each other than with the other group. As 
mentioned above, the BGLSPl, BGLSP2, BGHSPI and BGHSP2 sequences are likely 
to be distinct. However the changes in BGLSP3 to BGLSP5 relative to BGLSPI mayor 
may not be real. BGLSP6 has an extension of 14 amino acids at the C-terminus of the 
translated protein; again this could be a real difference or a PCR error at the stop codon. 
BGLSP7 has an internal deletion of 32 amino acids which could be real or caused by 
slipping of DNA polymerase during polymerisation. However, we have identified and 
sequenced 2 distinct BGHSPs and 2 distinct BGLSPs. For the remaining sequences, we 
need to sequence further clones in order to confirm their sequences. 
This study has confirmed that, as is the case for many snakes, there were several serine 
proteases in the venom of Bitis gabonica. Calvete et al. (2007), using proteomic and N-
terminal sequencing techniques, reported the N-terminal sequences of 5 distinct serine 
proteases in the venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros. Three of these matches to our 
complete sequences, I match with our previously described, partially sequenced 
rhinocerase but 1 of their peptides does not match with any of our sequences. 
Francischetti et al. (2004) have reported the presence of 8 serine protease contigs from 
the venom gland cDNA library of Bitis gabonica and have published the complete 
sequence of one gene: serine protease 1. Although these authors did not specify the 
subspecies of the snake, i.e. whether it was Bitis gabonica rhinoceros or Bitis gabonica 
gabonica, their amino acid sequence of serine protease 1 matches exactly one of our 
more reliable sequences, BGLSPI sequence (with a single nucleotide change which 
could be an error in their sequence as they have obtained the sequence from only one 
clone or it could be a synonymous mutation as it does not affect the corresponding 
amino acid or a peR induced error in our study), suggesting that Francischetti's work is 
also on the Bitis gabonica rhinoceros snake. Despite sequencing 9 serine proteases we 
were unable to obtain the gene sequence corresponding to the rhinocerase protein 
described in chapter 4. All the deduced serine protease amino acid sequences obtained 
in this study have basic pIs, while rhinocerase has an acidic pl. It is clear that there must 
be further serine proteases present in the venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros which 
have not been identified either by ourselves or other researchers. 
The predicted molecular weights of the 9 serine proteases vary from 23kDa to 28kDa. 
Glycosylation prediction tools predict all 9 to be glycosylated at 1 or more sites, which 
would increase the molecular weights of the mature proteins. Several glycosylated 
serine proteases have been reported in snake venoms. For example the determined 
structures of two serine protease isoforms (Aa VSPI and Aa VSPII) from the venom of 
Deinagkistrodon aculUs showed the presence of NAG (N-acetyl glucosamine)-Fucose-
NAG in AaVSPI and only NAG in AaVSPII (Zhu et al., 2005). This glycosylation was 
shown to influence substrate specificity and inhibitor binding of these proteins. In 
general, however, the nature and importance of glycosylation in viper venom serine 
proteases remains poorly understood. 
Many snake venoms have a number of serine protease isoforms in order to confer 
diverse functions towards their prey (Swenson et al., 2005). For example, the isoforms 
(Aa VSPI and Aa VSPII) of serine proteases from the venom of Deinagkistrodon aculus 
differ in only one amino acid substitution together with different glycosylation 
structures. They show different amidolytic activities towards various chromogenic 
substrates (Zhu et al., 2005). Some of the isoforms ofBGHSPs and BGLSPs differ only 
in a few amino acid substitutions, though these might not be real. They may also differ 
in their glycosylation structures in the matured proteins. Thus, even these slightly 
different amino acid sequences together with glycosylation may affect the substrate 
specificity and functions. 
Some of our serine protease sequences differ significantly from other published snake 
venom serine proteases. BGLSP6 has a C-terminal extension of 14 amino acids and 
BGLSP7 has an internal deletion of 32 amino acids. If this is real, it is possible that the 
C-terminal extension may not affect the structure and hence function. But the deletion 
within BGLSP7 would seem likely to have a major effect on the structure of this protein 
as this region comprises large sections of two loops together with a 6-strand if this is a 
real sequence. So it may not fold and hence would not be a functionally active serine 
protease. As BGLSP7 has a predicted molecular weight of 23kDa due to the internal 
deletion, this might be the protein which we have identified using anti-rhinocerase 
antibodies at a molecular weight around 15kDa (described in section 4.3.6). Doley et al. 
(2008) have suggested that truncated transcripts due to unusual deletions, additions and 
substitutions in the nucleotide sequence of three finger-toxin genes of a viper snake 
SistruTUS catenatus edwardsii and nucleotide sequences of neurotoxins, phospholipase 
A2s, C-type lectins, etc of a pygmy copperhead snake (Austre/aps labia/is) would lead 
to the production of functionally inactive toxins in venom glands and suggest that this is 
a part of their accelerated evolution towards new dietary habits. This suggestion could 
also be the case for BGLSP7 which has an internal deletion of 32 amino acids even 
though this is not a truncated transcript. 
BGHSPs contain a classical serine protease catalytic triad and are thus presumably 
functional serine proteases. However they have glycine at the S I site of their primary 
specificity pocket, rather than aspartic acid. This may mean that they do not act as 
arginine esterases, as many viper venom serine proteases do. Instead, they may have 
specificity for larger amino acids and thus may act upon different substrates in the prey 
compared to other viper venom serine proteases. 
BGLSPs, however, have an unusual catalytic triad with arginine 57 and asparagine 195 
instead of histidine 57 and serine 195. They have aspartic acid 189 at the SI site of the 
primary specificity pocket. Other viper venom serine proteases have been reported to 
have substitutions in their catalytic triad. For example VLP2 from Vipera /ebetina also 
has arginine 57 and asparagine 195 (Siigur et al., 2001). These authors suggested that 
generation of such substitutions occurs via trans-splicing of the primary gene transcript, 
.. exon-shuftling or unequal crossing over at the genome level but made no comments on their functionality. 
It could be speculated that the serine protease sequences with unusual catalytic triads 
fail to function as serine proteases. The only researchers to experimentally characterise 
a viper venom serine protease with a catalytic triad substitution are Wu et al. (2008), 
who found no serine protease activity in a protein with a single catalytic triad 
substitution (histidine 57 into arginine). This is an isolated result, and some of the 
experimental conditions used would cast doubt on this result. For example, the 
purification of this protein was performed using a buffer at pH 8.9 which is highly basic 
and might have denatured the protein. They have not neutralised the protein with low 
pH buffer to renature it after purification. The conditions of the functional assays were 
not clearly described and simply suggested that this enzyme is functionally inactive. As 
this enzyme has a single substitution in the catalytic triad, this might not cleave the 
chromogenic substrates (BAEE or TAME) as they are specific for classical serine 
proteases. The functional characterisation of this enzyme was not complete as they have 
not analysed functions such as factor V activation, factor VIII activation, kininogenase 
activity, fibrinogenolytic activity, plasminogen activator activity, etc. 
Beyond this, the only information about serine proteases with non-standard catalytic 
triad comes from other organisms. Wu et al. (2008) named their viper venom serine 
protease a "serine protease homolog" following a series of papers about serine proteases 
homologs in other vertebrates and prokaryotes. These have catalytic triad substitutions 
and no proteolytic activity. Rather, they are involved in several other functions such as 
antibacterial activity: cell adhesion, prophenoloxidase activation, immune function and 
growth induction (Kang et al., 2002). For example, azurocidin and azurocidin-like 
proteins have histidine-serine and serine-glutamate mutations in their active sites and 
are involved in immune functions. Limulus factor D is a serine protease homolog from 
horse shoe crab haemocytes with a serine-glycine active site substitution. It too has no 
serine protease activity, but has antimicrobial activity. Haptoglobin is a plasma protein 
which is involved in the capture of haemoglobin released into plasma during the rupture 
of erythrocytes (Nielsen et al., 2007). Serine protease homologs tend to be longer than 
serine proteases, and to contain additional, non-serine protease domains, although, at 
least in the case of haptoglobin, the binding activity is located in a loop of the serine 
protease domain. Wu et al. (2008) suggested that, like these proteins, viper venom 
serine protease homologs are inactive. 
On the other hand, it is possible for functional serine protease activity to occur in 
proteins without the classical catalytic triad. Paetzel et al. (1997 and 1999; Feldman et 
al., 2006) have reported several bacterial and viral serine proteases which use a catalytic 
dyad mechanism. This involves the hydroxyl group of serine, together with lysine 
acting as a general base. These proteins have been found only in prokaryotes and 
viruses and belong to different sequence families: clans SE and SF and family S41 
compared with the viper venom serine proteases which are in clan SA and family S 1. 
Further more, our BGLSPs do not even have the catalytic serine which is required even 
for the dyad mechanism. 
Neither of these groups, the serine protease homologs, nor the enzymes with catalytic 
dyads fits exactly the sequences we have obtained. It may be possible for our sequences 
to function as serine protease by an entirely different mechanism. George et al. (2005) 
caution against functional annotation of serine proteases with catalytic triad 
substitutions based on sequence-based analysis alone. Expression (or purification) and 
functional characterization of these proteins is the only way to obtain definitive 
functional infonnation. 
All the sequences presented here, with their catalytic triad substitutions and significant 
deletions and insertions represent very interesting variations to the classical viper 
venom serine proteases available to date. It will be really interesting to detennine 
whether or not they function as serine proteases, and it is intriguing to speculate what 
role (if any) they have within the viper venom. 
6. Sequence, structure,function and 
phylogenetic analysis of viper 
venom serine proteases 
6. Sequence, structure, function and phylogenetic analysis of viper 
venom serine proteases 
6.1 Introduction 
As viper venom serine proteases (VVSPs) have several different effects such as anti-
coagulant, pro-coagulant, etc. on human blood, they are potential sources for novel drug 
design. For example, the VVSPs which inhibit blood clotting (anti-coagulant) have 
potential use for the development of drugs for various cardiovascular diseases such as 
myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary emboli, etc., and 
VVSPs with blood clotting activities (pro-coagulant) could be used to develop drugs for 
bleeding disorders such as haemophilia, blood clotting factors deficiencies, etc. One 
example of a drug which has been developed using a VVSP is Arvin (Holleman, 1970; 
Collins et al., 1972; Ewart et al., 1970). Arvin has been suggested for use in ischemic 
stroke patients as it worked better clinically and cost less than existing drugs used to 
treat the same condition (Samsa et al., 2002). The potential advantages of VVSPs for 
drug development are their rapid action on target molecules and their resistance to 
natural inhibitors present in our system. 
On the other hand, the treatment of snakebites worldwide depends mainly on polyvalent 
anti-venom produced from the immunisation of large animals such as horse, sheep, 
goat, rabbit, etc. The anti-venom is produced by immunising the animals with non-lethal 
doses of several snake venoms which are thought to be venomous in a particular region 
or country. There are several disadvantages in using anti-venom, such as the cost of 
anti-venom, anaphylactic reactions in humans, lower efficiency, lack of specificity for 
particular toxins, ethical issues related to using animals in some countries, etc. However 
this is the only method available to date to treat snakebites. To avoid all the issues 
related to the use of anti-venom and to treat snakebites more effectively and rapidly, 
there is a need for an alternative method for the production of more specific antidotes to 
treat snake bites worldwide. 
Inhibitors designed for viper venom proteins could be an effective way of developing 
novel antidotes for viper bites. For example, many common SERPINS (serine protease 
inhibitors) such as thrombin serpins, hepatitis C serpins, elastase serpins, uP A 
(urokinase plasminogen activator) serpins and chymase are already available 
(Abbenante et al., 2005). Likewise, the design of general inhibitors for VVSPs would be 
useful as their sequences and structures are very similar to each other. Synthetic peptide 
inhibitors are particularly attractive as they are easily produced in large quantities using 
peptide synthesisers, the cost of production would be very low and degradation after use 
would also be easy in the host system. Furthermore, the development of similar kinds of 
inhibitors for other major venom enzymes such as metalloproteases, phospholipases, 
etc. could increase the efficacy of treatment of snake bites. A mixture of inhibitors for 
all toxic venom enzymes could be a potent broad spectrum antidote for viper venoms in 
general, as all viper venoms contain similar kinds of enzymes. 
To achieve any of these goals by drug design, we need to understand the basic 
sequence, structure and functional relationships of venom proteins. The original aim of 
our research was to attempt to understand the sequence, structure and functional 
relationships of VVSPs. Our preliminary analysis of VVSPs showed that they are 
widely distributed in snakes, belonging to the family of viperidae with some found in 
colubridae and hydrophidae. Many VVSP sequences have been deposited in the 
publicly available sequence databases such as GENBANK, SWISSPROT, UNlPROT, 
etc. But only 4 crystal structures of VVSPs have been obtained so far. For some of the 
sequences the relevant publications are missing and thus it is not possible to obtain 
further information, particularly about their ftmctions. 
The aim of this chapter is to understand more about the known sequences, structures 
and ftmctions of VVSPs. Here we describe the collection of all existing complete 
amino acid sequences ofVVSPs and related information from various sources; multiple 
sequence alignment and identification of structurally and functionally important 
residues; phylogenetic analysis to analyse the evolutionary relationships ofVVSPs; post 
translational modifications and structural analysis ofVVSPs. 
6.2 Methods 
6.2.1 Collection ofVVSP sequences and their related information 
BLAST (Basic local alignment search tool) (Altschul et al., 1990) searches were 
performed using the amino acid sequences of factor V activator from Daboia rosse/ii 
(RVV-V), plasminogen activator from Trimeresuros stejnegeri and protein C activator 
from Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix to identify similar sequences available in the 
NCBI (National Centre for Biotechnology Information) protein database. To make sure 
that the BLAST search had identified all the VVSPs from the NCBI database, the 
database was also searched with individual viper names and different keywords such as 
"serine proteases" in conjunction with names associated with snakes e.g. "serpents", 
"colubroidea", etc. The Swiss-Prot database was also searched with individual viper 
names to identify any additional serine proteases not found in the previous searches. 
Some published protein sequences, which had not been submitted to any of the 
sequence databases were collected directly from the literature. The data presented 
represent all sequences found in April 2008. 
6.2.2 Development of a comprehensive dataset for VVSPs 
Information about each of the complete VVSPs such as viper name, NCBI accession 
number, name of the protein, alternative names of protein, experimentally identified 
function and literature reference was collected. Where two or more sequences had 100% 
sequence identity as determined by the EMBOSS pairwise alignment tool (Rice et al., 
2000), duplicates were removed. Each sequence was allocated a reference code, 
determined by using the viper's scientific name for the first two letters, followed by two 
(3 in some cases) letters representing the protein name. For example, TSVPA is the 
reference code for a venom plasminogen activator from Trimeresurus stejnegeri. 
6.2.3 Multiple sequence analysis 
A multiple sequence alignment for all the VVSPs was performed using the ClustalW2 
multiple sequence alignment tool (Larkin et al., 2007) with the default parameters of 
KTUP, gap opening penalty and gap extension penalty. To aid comparison of the VVSP 
sequences with other serine proteases, the sequence of bovine a-chymotrypsinogen 
(NCBI accession number: P00766) was included in the alignment. This enabled the 
commonly used chymotrypsinogen numbering pattern to be identified in the VVSP 
sequences. The alignment file was viewed using the BioEdit-multiple sequence editor 
tool (Hall, 1997). In some VVSPs, the N-tenninal signal and activation peptides were 
present and these were identified using ClustaIW2 and removed. The alignment was 
repeated for all VVSP sequences without signal and activation peptides. The alignment 
was manually adjusted slightly in some regions after comparison with the alignment 
generated by the FUGUE structure based sequence alignment tool (Shi et al., 2001). 
6.2.4 Phylogenetic analysis 
Phylogenetic trees for the VVSP sequences were constructed using various tree-
constructing methods. The chymotrypsinogen sequence was used as an outgroup. The 
alignment file generated using ClustaIW2 was submitted to Phylip-Protdist (Felsenstein, 
1989) to calculate the distance matrix. Then the distance matrix was submitted to a 
number of tree generating tools such as Phylip-BIONJ (Gascuel, 1997), Phylip-Fitch 
(Felsenstein, 1989), Phylip-Neighbor (Felsenstein, 1989), Phylip-Weighbor (Bruno et 
al., 2(00), Phylip-Quick tree (Howe et al., 2002), Phylip-Protpars (Felsenstein, 1989) 
and Tree puzzle (Schmidt et al., 2002). Visual images of the trees were generated by 
submitting the tree files to Phylodendron, a phylogenetic tree printer (Gilbert, 1996). 
6.2.5 Posttranslational modifications predictions 
Sites for posttranslational modifications in each of the proteins were predicted using a 
number of web-based tools. NetNGlyc (Blom et al., 2004) was used to predict N-
glycosylation sites. These are predicted according to the presence of the sequence Asn-
X-Ser/Thr. O-glycosylation sites were predicted using NetOGlyc (Julenius, 2005), 
which identifies sites according to the presence of the residue serine/threonine 
associated with mucin type GalNac. Potential serine, threonine and tyrosine 
phosphorylation sites were predicted using NetPhos (Blom et al., 2004), which 
identifies phosphorylation sites based on a neural network method. 
.. 6.2.6 Structure modelling ofVVSPs 
Comparative modelling methods were used to create model structures of VVSPs. The 
protein sequence was submitted to Swiss-Model (Schwede et al., 2003). Swiss-Model 
uses a suitable determined structure as a template to model an approximate structure for 
the query sequence. The Swiss-model predicted structures were visualised in Swiss 
POB Viewer (Guex et al., 1997) and Protein Explorer (Martz, 2002). The 
Ramachandran plot was calculated using Swiss POB Viewer. 
The superposition of VVSPs was performed using the magic and improve fit modes in 
Swiss POB Viewer (Guex et al., 1997). The superimposed structure was saved as a pdb 
file and viewed using Protein Explorer (Martz, 2002). The RMS deviation between the 
template and modelled structures was calculated using Swiss PDB Viewer. 
6.3 Results and discussion 
6.3.1 Collection of VVSP sequences and their information 
The starting point for this research was Russell's viper venom factor V activator (RVV-
V), which was a viper venom serine protease on which I had already done some 
experiments. This protein was characterized by Tokunaga et al. (1988) and shown to 
have three isoforms (l (RVV-VA), J3 (RVV-VB) and y (RVV-VG) which were separated 
under denaturing conditions in HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography). 
Isoforms (l and y have been sequenced, and have only six amino acid differences in their 
sequences (figure 6.1). Isoform J3 has not been sequenced because of insufficient 
quantity of protein obtained during purification.

Figure 6.1 Amino acid sequences of RVV-VG and RVV-VA showing six amino 
acid differences (Blue-RVV-VG, Red- RVV-VA). 
Using RVV-VG as a starting point, we used BLAST to collect sequences and related 
information about all VVSPs which had been completely sequenced by April 2008. 
The top 139 matches from the BLAST search with RVV-VG were all serine proteases 
from viperidae, colubridae and hydrophidae with two synthetic constructs. These 
proteins had 55%-97% sequence identity with R VV -VG (Figure 6.2). Of these, 128 
"d e (v'tpers) with 6 from colubridae (5 isoforms of kallikrein-like were om vtpen a ,

from hydrophidae (from a sea snake, Lapemis hardwickii), 2 from varanidae, a family 
of lizards (2 kallikrein-like enzymes from a spiny-tailed monitor, Varanus acanthurus) 
and 2 synthetic constructs. Beyond the top 139 matches, no further snake venom serine 
proteases were found (figure 6.2). Since our main focus is on VVSPs, the II sequences 
from non-viper sources were removed from the dataset. 2 VVSP sequences were 
identified by BLAST twice for unknown reasons and they were also removed. A partial 
sequence of a platelet aggregating protein (with 163 amino acids) from Bothrops 
jararaca was identified by BLAST and this was also removed. The remaining 125 
VVSP sequences were collected from the BLAST search and used as the basis of our 
dataset. The BLAST search was repeated with other VVSPs such as a plasminogen 
activator from Trimeresurus stejnegeri and protein C activator from Agkistrodon acutus 
in order to confirm these numbers.

Figure 6.2 BLAST search result showing proteins similar to RVV-VG with score 
bits, E value and percentage of similarity. Beyond the top 139 sequences, no 
VVSPs were found. 
Searching the NCBI protein database using individual viper names found 4 further 
VVSP sequences (ancrod, ancrod like proteinl, 2 and 3) which had not been identified 
by the BLAST search. 13 VVSP sequences which had not been submitted to the NCBI 
database were collected directly from the literature. 
In addition to these, we have added the 9 VVSP sequences which we have obtained 
from the eDNA analysis of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros as described in chapter 5. A 
VVSP, serine protease I from Bitis gabonica (Francischetti et al., 2004) was identical 
with our BGLSPI amino acid sequence (though not in nucleotide sequence) and thus 
this was removed from the dataset generated from BLAST, leaving 124 sequences in 
that dataset. The total number of VVSPs collected from various methods is shown in 
table 6.1.

A comprehensive dataset of 150 VVSPs was prepared using the collected data from 
various sources and is shown in appendix 4. This dataset shows that the functions of 
only a few VVSPs have been experimentally determined. Some of the VVSPs have 
been shown to have more than one function and others have not been screened for more 
than one particular function of interest. Some of the VVSPs were just named thrombin-
like enzymes and KN (which we assume means kininogenase) but no information was 
provided about why the authors have named them so. For several of the VVSP 
sequences, there is no associated published paper and thus there is no information about 
their functions and characteristics. The number of VVSPs with known and unknown 
functions is shown in figure 6.4. Structural information is even more lacking; the 
structures of only 4 WSPs are known so far. 
This analysis showed that the collection of VVSP sequences from databases by searches 
using a single key word or sequence is not easy. Our comprehensive dataset of VVSPs 
has been acquired using semi-automated methods and to our knowledge, this is the most 
complete collection to date of VVSP sequences. The absence of some sequences from 
any of the sequence databases makes it impossible to acquire this completely 
automatically. The use of different naming conventions by various authors also makes it 
difficult to obtain the VVSP sequences using keyword searches. The VVSP sequences 
along with other serine protease sequences from reptiles (other snakes and lizard) are 
grouped together at the top of the BLAST results, indicating that VVSPs have higher 
sequence similarities to each other than to other serine proteases.

this information into a web based database to provide complete knowledge about the 
sequence, structure and function of existing VVSPs. This will enable researchers to 
easily retrieve all the sequence and related information about particular VVSPs or about 
VVSPs with particular functions . 
6.3.2 Sequence analysis 
The multiple sequence alignment of VVSPs showed that many sequences occurred in 
precursor form (Siigur et aI. , 2001), containing signal (18 amino acids) and activation 
peptides (6 amino acids) at the N terminal end (figure 6.5). These were removed from 
all VVSP sequences.

Figure 6.5 A VVSP sequence showing the N-terminal signal (blue) and activation 
peptides (red). 
The multiple sequence alignment was performed again using CiustalW2 (Larkin et aI., 
2007) for the mature protein regions of the VVSPs together with bovine -
chymotrypsinogen (NCBl accession number: P00766) and is shown in appendix 5. This 
alignment was slightly adjusted to align the conserved cysteine at position 92 of all 
VVSPs by comparing with the alignment created by the FUGUE structure based 
sequence alignment tool (Shi et aI., 200 I). The bovine -chymotrypsinogen-based 
sequence numbering has been used throughout this chapter. 
Siigur et al. (2001) reported that proteins with activation and signal peptides are present 
in precursor form. Interestingly, these peptides are completely absent in any of the 
VVSP sequences obtained through protein sequencing methods. Thus, it is dear that the 
translated proteins contain these signal and activation peptides, but the mature proteins 
lack these regions. To date no one has reported when the signal and activation peptides 
are cleaved in order to convert the inactive form of VVSPs into the active form. But, as 
for most secreted proteins, the signal peptide is probably cleaved from the protein in the 
endoplasmic reticulum during post translational modification. The activation peptide 
might be cleaved during the activation of a VVSP. For example, trypsinogen, an 
inactivated fonn of trypsin, a digestive enzyme in the gut secreted from the pancreas, is 
in inactive form until it reaches the gut in order to prevent its activity in the pancreas 
(Lodish et al., 2000). A short peptide containing 15 amino acids is cleaved from 
trypsinogen during its activation into trypsin (Lodish et al., 2000). Similarly, the VVSPs 
might be in inactive form in the venom duct and might be activated when the snake 
bites or when the venom is milked. But it is unclear how the activation peptides would 
be removed in the host after suffering a snake bite. It seems more likely that they would 
be removed by autolytic (self cleavage) action rather than by any of the enzymes 
present in the host system as the enzymes are present in activated fonn in venom which 
is directly extracted from snakes. 
6.3.2.1 General sequence features ofVVSPs 
In order to analyse the unique sequence features of VVSPs, the alignment of VVSP 
sequences was compared with other common serine proteases such as 
chymotrypsinogen, trypsin and thrombin. In this section, we discuss several features of 
VVSPs. 
6.3.2.1.1 N-terminal deletion and C-terminal extension 
The sequence alignment (appendix 5) shows that the length of most of the VVSPs is 
between 228 and 236 amino acids except the ones which have internal deletions and C-
terminal extensions. Compared to chymotrypsinogen, all the WSPs lack IS amino 
acids at the N-terminus end of the mature proteins and this indicates the removal of 
signal and activation peptides. All the WSPs have a C-terminal extension of 7 amino 
acids which is not present in chymotrypsinogen, trypsin or thrombin. This contains a 
cysteine which makes an unique disulphide linkage in VVSPs, which offers extra 
stability for maintaining their structures (Parry et al., 1998). BGLSP6 has an additional 
C-terminal extension of 14 amino acids and this was discussed in chapter s. 
6.3.2.1.2 Internal deletions 
One of the serine proteases found in our cDNA analysis, BGLSP7, was found to have 
an internal deletion of 32 amino acids (chapter 5). The sequence alignment perfonned 
here showed two further VVSPs with internal deletions. A thrombin-like enzyme, 
DA VT9 from Deinagkistrodon aculus has an 18 amino acid deletion (between 149 and 
166) and another thrombin-like enzyme, GHTEP3 from Gloydius halys has deletions 
totalling 68 amino acids in two regions (between 16 and 59, and 188 and 211). 
As for BGLSP7 these internal deletions would almost certainly result in loss of 
significant regions of the structures and thus the proteins may not fold properly or be 
functionally active. A structure based alignment of these three sequences with the 
detennined structure of protein C activator from Agkistrodon aculus (PDB code: 2AIQ) 
shows the loss of loop regions together with 6-strands in their structures. To date no one 
has reported the significance of such internal deletions in VVSPs. We mentioned in 
chapter 3 a potential serine protease with molecular weight of around 20kDa identified 
using our anti-rhinocerase antibodies in the venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros. Thus it 
is possible that VVSPs with internal deletions might be synthesised and secreted in the 
venom. But the functions of these enzymes remain unclear. 
6.3.2.1.3 VVSPs with two protein chains 
Lee et al. (2000) identified a fibrinolytic enzyme, brevinase (GBBF) from Gloydius 
blomhofJii with two polypeptide chains. They found that the cleavage occurs between 
arginine 94 and asparagine 95 during post translational modification. The sequence 
alignment of VVSPs showed the presence of these two residues in 5 more VVSPs, 
namely: BJP A, ACC-C, CAC, GBS and GUTUS. However four of these have been 
reported to have a single chain (Henschen-Edman et al., 1999; Murakami et al., 2005). 
Thus it is not clear whether these enzymes consist of one or two chains. Lee et al. 
(2000) is the only report suggesting the presence of a two chain-containing VVSP in 
snake venom so far, but it is possible that residues other than arginine 94 and asparagine 
95 are responsible for the susceptibility to cleavage. 
6.3.2.1.4 GWG motif 
Fehlhammer et al. (1977) reported that a glycine-tryptophan-glycine (GWG) motif 
between residues 140 and 142 in chymotrypsinogen was an important site for the 
conversion of a flexible zymogen structure into a fixed rigid orientation in the activated 
chymotrypsin. This motif is absolutely conserved at the same positions in all VVSPs, 
indicating its important role. 
6.3.2.2 Catalytic triad 
The catalytic triad is crucial for the catalytic action of serine proteases and, in the S 1 
family of serine proteases belonging to the clan SA, it generally consists of the residues 
histidine 57, aspartate 102 and serine 195. The catalytic residues at these positions are 
highlighted at the top of our alignment (appendix 5). 131 VVSPs contain classical 
catalytic triad residues i.e. histidine 57, aspartate 102 and serine 195. However, 18 
VVSP sequences (which includes 7 of our BGLSP sequences) contain substitutions for 
histidine 57 (15 arginine, 2 asparagine and 1 glutamine) and 9 of these have 
substitutions for the catalytic serine (8 asparagine and 1 proline). One VVSP, GHTEP3 
has deletions covering positions 57 and 195. These substitutions are shown as boxed 
residues in the alignment (appendix 5) and also shown in different colours in figure 6.6. 
As discussed in section 5.4, VVSPs containing substitutions in their catalytic triad may 
or may not be functionally active. They might also be involved in other non-proteolytic 
functions such as protein-protein interactions, etc. However, George et al. (2005) 
warned about the prediction of function for the serine proteases which contain 
substitutions in the catalytic triad and definitive function can only be assigned in the 
light of experimental evidence.

6.3.2.3 Specificity of VVSPs 
6.3.2.3.1 Primary specificity pocket 
In serine proteases the primary specificity pocket (also called the S 1 binding site) 
accommodates the side chain of the PI residue (the residue preceding the scissile bond) 
of substrates. The residues which form the primary specificity pocket are 189, 216 and 
226. These confer substrate specificity. For example, the enzymes chymotrypsin, 
trypsin and elastase have similar structures but different substrate specificity. 
Chymotrypsin contains serine 189, glycine 216 and glycine 226 and is specific for the 
large hydrophobic side chains (phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan). Trypsin 
contains aspartate 189, glycine 216 and glycine 226 and is specific for positively 
charged amino acids like arginine and lysine. The same residues are present in 
thrombin. Elastase contains serine 189, valine 216 and threonine 226 and is specific for 
small hydrophobic side chains like alanine (Czapinska et aI. , 1999). 
The sequence alignment shows that 132 VVSPs, like trypsin and thrombin, contain a 
negatively charged aspartate at position 189. In only 17 sequences is this substituted by 
another amino acid; 16 of these mutations are to glycine and 1 to serine. One VVSP, 
GHTEP3 has an internal deletion covering position 189. Similarly, with only II 
exceptions, glycine is present at position 216. This is similar to chymotrypsin, trypsin 
and thrombin. The substitutions for this amino acid are alanine (2), arginine (1), 
threonine (l) and glutamic acid (7). At position 226, like chymotrypsin, trypsin and 
thrombin, 84 VVSPs have glycine, but 62 sequences have alanine instead, and there are 
2 VVSPs with valine, 1 with glutamic acid and 1 with asparagine at this position. The 
substitutions in the primary specificity pocket are shown in figure 6.7.

Figure 6.7 The substituted residues present in the primary specificity pocket of 
VVSPs shown along with the residues present at these positions of chymotrypsin 
and trypsin. GHTEP3 has a deletion at position 189. 
The composition of the primary specificity pocket of 133 VVSPs is most similar to 
trypsin and thrombin (figure 6.7). They contain aspartate 189, which suggests their 
specificity for positively charged amino acids. Aspartate 189 fonns a salt bridge with 
the positively charged residue at the PI site of substrates. The relatively large number of 
proteins with alanine at position 226 may be able to accommodate only arginine rather 
than lysine due to the presence of the methyl side chain of alanine in the pocket. 
A small number of proteins may have quite different specificities. For example, ancrod-
like protein from Calloselasma rhodostoma (CRALP2) contains serine 189, glycine 216 
and alanine 226, more like chymotrypsin (figure 6.7) and may accommodate 
hydrophobic amino acids, possibly smaller in size such as phenylalanine rather than 
tyrosine and tryptophan because of the methyl group of alanine in the specificity pocket. 
The serine 189 cannot form a salt bridge with the PI residue of the substrate. 
Some VVSPs contain glycine at position 189 and thus they too may be unable to make a 
salt bridge with the arginine of substrates. Thus they might be specific for different PI 
residues. As these VVSPs contain glycine at this position, they are not technically 
trypsin-like enzymes, although prediction programs such as Pfam, ProDom, etc. predict 
them to be trypsin-like enzymes or enzymes containing trypsin-like domains. 
Similarly. some VVSPs contain residues other than glycine and alanine at positions 216 
and 226. As these are the main residues lining the specificity pocket, substituted 
residues such as glutamate, arginine, asparagine, etc. might confer specificity towards 
different substrate residues. Ultimately the significance of all these substitutions in 
tenns of specificity towards various amino acids needs to be determined experimentally 
through mutational and structural analysis. 
Massova et al. (1997) reported through his structural modelling studies on crotalase that 
the threonine present at position 190 of crotalase (CAC) was important for the 
fonnation of a hydrogen bond with the P I arginine of the substrate in order to bind the 
P I residue firmly into the primary specificity pocket. The sequence alignment of 
VVSPs shows that threonine is present at this position in 89 sequences. This was 
substituted by serine in 54 sequences, isoleucine in 6 sequences and alanine in one 
sequence. In total 143 VVSP sequences have either threonine or serine at position 190 
and as they both have a hydroxyl group in their side chain, they could form the 
hydrogen bond with the PI residue of substrates. Trypsin and chymotrypsin have serine 
at this position. But it is not clear whether the isoleucine and alanine present at position 
190 could make a hydrogen bond with the PI residue. However thrombin also contains 
alanine at this position. 
6.3.2.3.2 Specificity of SI' binding site 
The S l' -binding site is important in conferring specificity towards the residue present at 
the PI' site of substrates. Massova et al. (1997) reported that this site is fonned by the 
residues present at position 214 and 215 in crotalase, a VVSP similar to thrombin. 
Crotalase (CAC) has phenylalanine at position 214 and tryptophan at 215. Massova et 
al. (1997) reported that these amino acids cause the active site near the histidine and 
serine to narrow slightly compared to thrombin, trypsin and chymotrypsinogen, which 
contain serine 214 and tryptophan 215, and thus crotalase might show increased 
specificity towards small amino acids preferably glycine. So crotalase may show 
increased specificity for fibrinogen, as this is the only known VVSP substrate which 
contains glycine at the PI' position. 
In order to understand the specificity of other VVSPs towards the PI' residue of 
substrates, we studied the combinations of residues at these positions (table 6.2). In 
total, 105 VVSPs contain serine and tryptophan or tyrosine at positions 214 and 215 
respectively. But 12 VVSPs contain either phenylalanine or tyrosine or tryptophan in 
both positions (table 6.2). The remaining VVSPs contain other combinations of 
residues. 
The well known VVSP substrates and their scissile bonds are: fibrinogen (arginine -
glycine), plasminogen (arginine - valine), kininogen (arginine - serine), factor V 
(arginine - serine) and platelet receptor (arginine - serine). Crotalase has been 
suggested to show increased specificity for substrates with glycine at the PI' position. 
This would explain its ability to cleave fibrinogen. However, crotalase also has a 
kininogenase function which would mean that it could also cleave substrates with serine 
at the PI' position. 
The 105 VVSPs with serine at position 214 and bulky residues at position 215 might 
have specificity for a wide range of amino acids at the PI' site similar to trypsin, 
thrombin and chymotrypsin. But the other 12 VVSPs with bulky amino acids at both 
positions might restrict the entry to the S l' site and thus may have increased specificity 
for substrates such as fibrinogen. Indeed, many functionally characterised VVSPs which 
contain large hydrophobic amino acids at these positions (e.g. TATLI, TATL2 and 
LMV A) seem to be specific for fibrinogen .

frequency in our 150 VVSP sequences. 
6.3.2.3.3 S2-binding site 
The S2-binding site of serine proteases accommodates the P2 residue of the substrate. In 
crotalase this site is lined by hydrophobic tryptophan residues at positions 99 and 215, 
along with the catalytic histidine 57, and confers specificity towards hydrophobic 
residues at the P2 position in substrates (Massova et al., 1997). Similarly trypsin and 
thrombin have hydrophobic residues at these positions and thus they prefer hydrophobic 
residues at the P2 site. Tryptophan is present at position 99 in 105 VVSP sequences and 
substitutions in this position are arginine in 5, lysine in 8, threonine in 4, leucine in 23 
and valine in 5 VVSPs. Similarly 101 VVSPs contain tryptophan at position 215. The 
substitutions found at this position are tyrosine in 18 sequences, phenylalanine in 4, 
alanine in 4, glycine in 6, isoleucine in 1, leucine in 1, valine in 9, arginine in 5 and 
lysine in 1. As VVSPs in our dataset contain mostly tryptophan and tyrosine at these 
positions, they may also favour hydrophobic amino acids at the P2 site. But some 
VVSPs contain arginine at one of these positions (e.g. DA VT) and this might create a 
basic environment which might confer specificity towards an acidic amino acid at the 
P2 position. 
6.3.2.3.4 Fibrinogen binding sites 
The fibrinogen binding sites of thrombin include an exosite which is formed by 
positively charged amino acids present in two specific loops: phenylalanine 34 to 
leucine 40 and lysine 70 to glutamate 80 loops (Bode et al., 1992a) and an aryl binding 
site which is formed by hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine 99, isoleucine 174, 
tryptophan 215 and phenylalanine 227. The positively charged amino acids present in 
the exosite loops are involved in binding fibrinogen and the hydrophobic amino acids in 
the aryl binding site are involved in accommodating phenylalanine at the P8 position of 
fibrinogen, which is an important step in fibrinogen binding. In trypsin, the 70-80 loop 
is not rich in positively charged residues; it is referred to as the calcium loop as it 
favours calcium binding due to the presence of several acidic amino acids (Bode et al., 
1 992a). Similarly, kallikrein lacks basic amino acids in the 34-40 and 70-80 loop 
regions as fibrinogen is not a substrate for it. 
Massova et al. (1997) proposed a fibrinogen binding exosite in crotalase which is 
similar to that of thrombin based on structural modelling studies and this comprises 
positively charged amino acids such as arginine 73, lysine 78, arginine 81 and arginine 
82. Pirkle et al. (1998) suggested an alternative fibrinogen binding exosite which 
includes positively charged amino acids such as arginine 60, lysine 85, lysine 89, 
arginine 107 and lysine 110 in crotalase, also based on structural modelling. They also 
showed that the fibrinogen binding and alternative fibrinogen binding exosites act as 
mirror images, fonning a groove which could accommodate fibrinogen. From their 
observations, it was believed that crotalase binds with its substrate fibrinogen through 
the positively charged amino acids present in these two binding exosites which are 
structurally similar to thrombin. Massova et a1. (1997) also proposed an aryl binding site 
in crotalase which is similar to thrombin with amino acids such as tryptophan 99, 
phenylalanine 174A, leucine 176 and tryptophan 215 and suggested that these could 
provide a favourable hydrophobic environment for binding the phenylalanine at the P8 
position of fibrinogen. 
To get a rough idea of which VVSPs are more likely to bind fibrinogen, we looked for 
positively charged amino acids between 60 and 110 (as this region covers both the 
exosites) and hydrophobic amino acids in the proposed aryl binding site. The sequence 
alignment ofVVSPs shows between 5 (e.g. TGSP3 and TFSP3) and 15 (e.g. CRVA and 
TS3P) positively charged amino acids between residues 60 and 110, distributed 
randomly, not particularly in the positions predicted to be exosites in crotalase. Some 
positions such as 82 and 107 in the selected region are absolutely conserved with only 
positively charged amino acids. Tryptophan 99 and 215 in the aryl binding site are 
present in over 100 VVSPs. Position 174A contains phenylalanine in 10 VVSPs and 
tyrosine in 2 VVSPs. However, only these 12 VVSPs, including crotalase, have an 
insertion at this position and thus there is no corresponding amino acid in the remaining 
VVSPs. Position 176 contains leucine in 124 VVSPs, isoleucine in 6, valine in 5, 
methionine in 7, cysteine in 1, tryptophan in 2, phenylalanine in I, arginine in 3 and 
glutamine in I. 
The fact that all VVSPs have at least 5 positively charged amino acids between residues 
60 and 110 and many have hydrophobic amino acids in the proposed aryl binding site 
makes it difficult to use this information to predict fibrinogen binding. For example, in 
total 124 VVSPs have 10 or more positively charged amino acids between residues 60 
and 110. However this includes both a-fibrinogenolytic enzymes such as ABVA and 
LMV A and non-fibrinogenolytic enzymes such as TSVPA and RVV-VG. Thus it is not 
possible for example to conclude that VVSPs with more positively charged amino acids 
along with an aryl binding site are likely to bind fibrinogen. This analysis shows that 
detailed functional studies are required to analyse the important residues involved in 
substrate binding. 
6.3.2.3.5 RGD motif 
The arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) motif acts as a cell adhesion signal and is present 
in cellular signal transduction proteins. It has also been reported that proteins containing 
RGD motifs may induce apoptosis (Buckley et al., 1999). Matsui et al. (1998) identified 
a RGD motif in the enzyme brevinase (GBBF) from G/oydius b/omhojJi and suggested 
that it might be involved in cellular recognition and in inhibition of platelet aggregation. 
In our analysis we have identified the RGD motif at the same position as GBBF 
(between 192 and 194), in three other VVSPs: venombin A from G/oydius ussuriensis, 
GUY A, halystase from G/oydius b/omhojJi, GBH and thrombin-like enzyme from 
G/oydius saxatilis, GSTE. VVSPs containing the RGD motif could be involved in 
inducing apoptosis in order to cause destruction of cells in the host system. They may 
also inhibit platelet aggregation. As RGD motifs were found only in VVSPs from 
venoms of the G/oydius genus so far, this may be a unique feature of these snake 
venoms. 
6.3.2.3.6 Residues important for plasminogen activation activity 
Parry et al. (1998) reported that aspartate 97, arginine 174 and phenylalanine 193 are 
important for the plasminogen activation function of TSVPA (a plasminogen activator 
from Trimeresurus stejnegeri). Aspartate 97 and arginine 174 are present at the 
beginning of the active site cleft and form a salt bridge, which is crucial for the 
plasrninogenolytic activity in TSVP A (Parry et a1., 1998). Here we compare these 
residues with those present in other known plasminogen activators in our dataset. 
Data extracted from an alignment of the 5 known plasminogen activator enzymes 
together with bovine a-chymotrypsinogen are shown in table 6.3. This shows that none 
of these functionally important residues is absolutely conserved in all 5 known 
plasminogen activators. Position 97 contains aspartate or glutamate in 4 plasminogen 
activators, while LMP A has threonine. Arginine 174 is present in just two sequences, 2 
sequences have leucine and 1 has phenylalanine at this position. Phenylalanine 193 is 
present in 2 sequences while the others have glycine at this position. The phenylalanine 
to glycine mutation at position 193 has been shown to increase the catalytic activity of 
TSVP A by 10 fold (Braud et a1., 2000). So this substitution may increase the catalytic 
activity in these 3 proteins.

Table 6.3 Residues present at positions 97, 174 & 193 in known plasminogen 
activators. The abbreviations of VVSPs are plasminogen activators from 
Trimeresurus stejnegeri (fSVPA and TSPA), Gloydius halys (GHPA), Lachesis 
muta muta (LMPA) and Trimeresurus albolabris (TAPA). 
As this analysis shows that the residues reported to be important for plasminogenolytic 
activity in TSVP A are not conserved among all other functionally known plasminogen 
activators, the precise roles of these or other residues needs to be obtained via structural 
and mutational studies. We also found that many VVSPs, even non-plasminogen 
activators, contain glycine at position 193. Harel et al. (2001) reported the importance 
of glycine at position 193 in the fonnation of the oxyanion hole during the catalysis. 
This may be the reason why the catalytic activity of TSVP A increased 10 fold when the 
phenylalanine at 193 was mutated into glycine. Thus glycine 193 may be important for 
the catalysis of the enzymes rather than for conferring substrate specificity. 
6.3.2.4 Specificity of VVSPs against inhibitors 
6.3.2.4.1 Heparin binding site 
Heparin is a potent biological inhibitor for thrombin and thus displays anti-coagulant 
properties. Thrombin has a unique heparin binding site which is fonned of residues 230-
242 (present in a helix) and surrounding basic amino acids (Bode et al., 1992). The 3 
important amino acids at the surface of the helix are arginine 233, lysine 236 and lysine 
240. Massova et al. (1997) reported that crotalase lacks all these 3 basic amino acids 
and has acidic amino acids (233 and 236) and a serine at position 240 instead. Thus they 
concluded that crotalase would not be able to bind to heparin. 
Our sequence alignment shows that position 233 contains acidic amino acids in all 
VVSP sequences except for 5 which have asparagine. Position 236 contains acidic 
amino acids in 130 VVSPs, histidine in 3, asparagine in 3, proline 10, threonine in I, 
alanine in I and valine 1. Only 8 VVSPs contain arginine at position 240 and the 
remaining VVSPs contain non-basic amino acids at this position. This would suggest 
that the VVSPs are not sensitive to heparin as they lack the necessary positively charged 
amino acids. Indeed Markland et al. (1972) experimentally proved that crotalase is not 
sensitive to heparin. 
6.3.2.4.2 Hirudin-binding site 
Hirudin is a peptide extracted from the leech saliva. It is one of the most specific and 
potent thrombin inhibitors. The hirudin binding site of thrombin is mainly comprised of 
hydrophobic amino acids present in the 60A-6OI loop and surrounding basic amino 
acids. The 60A-6OI loop provides hydrophobic interactions with hirudin. Pirkle et al. 
(1998) showed experimentally that crotalase is not sensitive to hirudin and Massova et 
al. (1997) explained this by the absence of the 60A-6OI loop. Our alignment (appendix 
5) shows that this loop is completely absent in all 150 WSPs and thus it seems that 
WSPs will not be able to bind hirudin. 
6.3.2.5 Stabilisation of VVSPs 
6.3.2.5.1 Disulphide linkages 
The trypsin-like serine proteases contain 10 cysteine residues which form 5 disulphide 
linkages. But in the WSP sequences in general 12 cysteine residues are found and they 
form 6 disulphide linkages (Parry et al., 1998). These are Cys22-Cys157, CYS42-Cys58, 
Cys92-245e, Cys136-Cys201, Cys168-Cys182 and CysI91-Cys220. The disulphide 
linkage Cys92-Cys24Se is unique to viper venom serine proteases (Parry et al., 1998). 
In our alignment, although 8 of the cysteine residues (C22, C136, C157, C168, C182, 
C191, C220 and C245e) are absolutely conserved in all VVSPs, 11 VVSPs do have 
mutations for one or more of the other 4 cysteine residues. C42 is present in all 
sequences except 4 (CCSPP, TSI4P, TS6P, and TS5P) where glycine is present instead. 
Similarly C58 is present in all sequences except for one VVSP (DA VT2) which has a 
substitution of arginine at this position. C92 is present in all VVSPs except for one 
VVSP (GBS) which has an arginine at this position. C201 is present in all sequences 
except 2 VVSPs; DA VT7 has an arginine and DADK has a serine substitution at this 
position. GHTEP3 has deletions covering at position 42, 58 and 201. BGLSP7 has 
deletion covering position 136 and DA VT9 has a deletion covering position 157. The 
substituted cysteine residues are shown in figure 6.8. 
This analysis shows that in some of the VVSPs, specific disulphide linkages cannot be 
formed due to the substitutions. For example, DAVT7 and DADK contain substituted 
residues at position 201 and thus they cannot form a linkage between 136 and 201. In 
general, it is not clear how these substitutions and subsequent loss of corresponding 
disulphide linkages would affect the architecture of the VVSP structures.

6.3.2.5.2 Salt bridge 
A common salt bridge in trypsin (Lodish et aI. , 2000) and VVSPs (Parry et aI. , 1998; 
Massova et aI., 1997) was reported between the residues valine/isoleucine 16 and 
aspartate 194. This is formed after the activation of the enzyme from its precursor form 
by proteolytic cleavage and is involved in stabilisation of the active site structure. In 
total 130 VVSPs contain valine and 20 VVSPs contain isoleucine at position 16. 
Similarly all VVSPs contain aspartate at position 194 except one VVSP, TS I OP which 
contains valine. Thus with the exception of TS lOP, all other VVSPs can form a salt 
bridge between the residues in these positions in order to stabilise the active site 
structure of the enzymes. 
6.3.2.6 Sequence analysis of non-viper serine proteases 
As described in section 6.3.1, 9 serine proteases were collected from non-viper sources. 
As they include sequences from both snakes and lizard, we have named them non-viper 
serine proteases (NVSPs). These include 6 sequences from a colubrid snake, Philodryas 
olfersii, of which 5 are isoforms of a kallikrein-like enzyme. One sequence is from a sea 
snake, Lapemis hardwickii and the remaining 2 sequences are isoforms of a kallikrein-
like enzyme from a lizard (spiny-tailed monitor, Varanus acanthuros). The sequence 
codes and relevant information for these sequences are shown in appendix 6. These 
sequences were aligned along with a VVSP, BGLSPI and bovine a-chymotrypsinogen 
to identify similarities and differences between NVSP and VVSP sequences (figure 
6.9). 
As for VVSPs, signal (18 amino acids) and activation (6 amino acids) peptides were 
present in all the sequences from colubrid and lizard. But the sequence from sea snake 
(LHSP) had a longer activation peptide of 15 amino acids. The reason for this 9 amino 
acids insertion between residues 12a and 12i (chymotrypsinogen numbering) in LHSP 
was not explained and it may indicate a unique activation mechanism for this enzyme. 
The presence of activation peptides in all the NVSPs suggests that they might also, like 
trypsin, be synthesised as precursors in the venom gland and activated during the bite or 
milking. 
Some of the common serine protease features such as the GWG motif (between residues 
140 and 142), classical catalytic triad (histidine 57, aspartate 102 and serine 195) and 
salt bridge forming residues (isoleucine 16 and aspartate 194) are conserved in all the 
NVSP sequences. Compared to chymotrypsinogen, extensions at the C-terminus of 10 
amino acids in POSP and 6 amino acids in LHSP were found. These extensions include 
the cysteine 245e which is conserved in VVSPs. However, unlike VVSPs, the other 5 
NVSPs do not have a C-terminal extension, indeed most are truncated even with respect 
to chymotrypsin. The significance of this is unknown. An internal extension of 9 amino 
acids (97a-97i) was found in the sequences from lizard and this may playa specific role 
in these proteins. 
The cysteine residues at positions 22, 42, 58, 92, 136, 157, 168, 182, 191,201 and 220 
are absolutely conserved in all the NVSPs. Thus, the linkages between 22-157, 42-58, 
136-201, 168-182 and 191-220 could be formed in all the NVSPs as for the VVSPs. 
However position 245e, involved in a disulphide linkage unique to VVSPs, is absent in 
7 NVSPs and thus the 92-245e linkage can only be formed in POSP and LHSP. 
The aspartate 189 at the SI site of the primary specificity pocket is conserved in all the 
NVSPs. Position 226 is not present in 3 sequences, but the remaining sequences have 
glycine or alanine at this position. One could say that these enzymes could act as 
trypsin-like enzymes with specificity towards positively charged amino acids at the PI 
position of substrates, with the sequences containing alanine at position 226 perhaps 
preferring arginine. It is not clear what the primary specificity pocket of the 3 shortest 
sequences (pOKPl-3) would look like. 
This analysis showed that the study of NVSP sequences along with VVSPs would be 
interesting as they share some common features. There are, however, some interesting 
differences such as internal extensions (lizard venom) and C-terminal deletions. 
However in order to study the functional relationships of these sequences, more 
sequences, structures and functional information from non-viper sources are required.

Figure 6.9 The alignment of NVSP sequences along with a VVSP, BGLSPI and 
bovine a-chymotrypsinogen. The NCBI accession number for the NVSP sequences 
are V A VK4: AAZ75620, V A VK5: AAZ7562 1 , POKP5: AAZ75629, POKP3: 
AAZ75627, POKPl: AAZ75625, POKP2: AAZ75626, POSP: ABI74694, POKP4: 
AAZ75628 and LHSP: AA V98367. The names of these proteins, source organisms 
and their functions are shown in appendix 6. Important residues were indicated 
with arrows. 'Chymo' represents chymotrypsinogen. The C-terminal extensions 
are shown in boxes. 
6.3.3 Phylogenetic analysis of VVSPs 
Phylogenetic analysis was perfonned in order to analyse the evolutionary and functional 
relationships of VVSP sequences. The phylogenetic tree generated for 150 VVSP 
sequences using Phylip-neighbor is shown in figure 6.10. We have chosen not to 
include the non-viper serine protease (NVSP) sequences in the tree. The sequence of 
bovine a-chymotrypsinogen was used as an outgroup. 
Wang et aI. (2001) generated a phylogenetic tree with 41 VVSP sequences using the 
Phylip-neighbor method. This tree is shown in figure 6.11. For easy comparison the tree 
has been altered by replacing the enzyme names with the codes used in this study. From 
their tree, three categories of VVSPs were identified, which they named kininogenases 
(KN), clotting enzymes eCL) and plasminogen activators (P A). These names described 
the known functions of some members of each of the categories. They also suggested 
that the K.N category might be divided into 2 subcategories, with one representing GBH 
and another representing PMMI-PMM5 and that this division might become more 
apparent if more sequences, particularly from true vipers were added. Hereafter we use 
the term categories to represent the classification of sequences (i.e. PA, K.N and CL) 
defined by Wang et aI. (2001), with subcategories representing the subdivisions of these 
categories. 
Of the several phylogenetic tree developing methods we used, the tree generated using 
Phylip-neighbor (figure 6.10) is the most similar to that generated by Wang et aI. (2001) 
as all the sequences included in their analysis are grouped in a similar fashion to their 
tree, and thus this tree is the easiest to use for comparison with the earlier data. Only 
small differences between the trees generated using different methods were found. 
Our tree groups all the VVSP sequences into three major clusters. The top cluster in the 
Phylip-neighbor tree includes several subc1usters with a small number of VVSP 
sequences in each. These subc1usters correspond to the CL category identified by Wang 
et aI. (2001) as it includes all the members of the CL category in their tree. For ease of 
comparison we have labelled these subclusters CL. The middle cluster includes the 
VVSPs belonging to the KN category of their tree. For example GBH and BJKN were 
found in Wang et a1.'s KN category and are also present in the middle cluster in our 
tree. Similarly the bottom cluster contains sequences such as TSVP A and GHP A in 
Wang et a1.'s PA category. These clusters were named KN and PA by analogy with 
Wang et a1.'s naming scheme. To aid comparison, the sequences in our KN clusters are 
coloured the same colour (yellow) as Wang et a1.'s KN category. Similarly our CL 
cluster and Wang et a1.'s CL category are coloured pink:, and our PA cluster and Wang 
et al.'s PA category are coloured blue. 
Based on the Phylip-neighbor tree, 31 sequences are in the cluster corresponding to 
Wang et a1.'s PA category. Similarly 51 are in the KN cluster and 68 in the CL cluster. 
As suggested by Wang et al. (2001), subclusters of the KN cluster containing GBH and 
PMMI-PMM5 are even more clearly separated, now that more sequences have been 
added. Sequences from true vipers (TV in figure 6.10) seem to be closer to the GBH 
subcluster than to the PMM subcluster. 
The experimentally proved functions of VVSPs are indicated on the tree in figure 6.10. 
Only 5 VVSPs have been experimentally proved as plasminogen activators (P A). 
Similarly, 16 VVSPs were characterised as clotting enzymes (CL) either with a-
fibrinogenase [venombin A (VA)] or 6-fibrinogenase [venombin B (VB)] or a6-
fibrinogenase [venombin AB (V AB)] activities and 4 VVSPs were characterised as 
kininogenases (KN). Many of the enzymes of known function in the CL cluster are VA, 
VB, and V AB. Two of the three platelet aggregators (PLA) are included in this cluster; 
the remaining one, BJP ABJ is included in the P A category. However there are also 
enzymes with different functions in the CL cluster. For example, though a protein C 
activator, ACC-C has a venombin A function: it is a predominant anti-coagulant 
enzyme involved in the negative control of the blood coagulation cascade by degrading 
factor Va and factor VIlla. This cluster also includes a VVSP with defibrase (DF) 
function i.e. anti-coagulant. As enzymes with many functions including anti-coagulant 
functions are included in this cluster it cannot simply be named clotting enzymes (CL). 
Enzymes with plasminogen activator (P A) activity are found only in the PA cluster. 
However, this cluster also includes enzymes with a variety of other functions including 
direct (e.g. TFVA, DAASI and DAASIQ and indirect clotting enzymes (e.g. RVV-V 
and MLFVA), a platelet aggregator (e.g. BJPABJ) and defibrase (e.g. TAAF and 
GUTO) enzymes. Thus this cluster also cannot simply be given the name plasminogen 
activators. 
Similarly, enzymes with kininogenase activity are confined to the K.N cluster with 1 
exception: CAC (crotalase). CAC is found in the CL cluster, which contains mainly 
clotting enzymes. Indeed crotalase also has a clotting function. This highlights the 
difficulty of classifying enzymes with multiple functions. Also the K.N cluster includes 
some VA and VB enzymes which have a clotting function. Thus this cluster also cannot 
simply named kininogenases. 
Broadly speaking many VVSPs do have functions consistent with the KN, CL and PA 
labels given by Wang et al. but the increased dataset size shows that classification is not 
so simple. Thus the naming pattern suggested by Wang et aI. (2001) is not suitable 
when we add more VVSP sequences. It may not be possible to obtain a sensible naming 
for each cluster until we know the complete functional information of members of each 
cluster. If the functions of other VVSPs are reported, the classification should become 
clearer. However the function of VVSPs depend on a few critical residues and detailed 
analysis of these is necessary to correlate sequence and functional relationships. 
The majority (15 out of 18) of VVSPs containing substitutions in their catalytic triad 
cluster together in the K.N cluster, but 2 are found in the CL cluster and 1 in the P A 
cluster. Wu et al. (2008) found that all sequences with substitutions in their catalytic 
triads cluster together in their phylogenetic tree. But they have analysed only a small 
number of sequences. Our analysis, with more sequences included shows that their 
conclusion is not completely true. 
The isofonns of serine protease sequences which we have obtained from Bitis gabonica 
rhinoceros are found in different places. BGHSP 1 and BGHSP2 are in the CL cluster 
along with other true viper sequences such as MLAFP, MLBFP and CCSPP. The 
BGLSP 1-7 isofonns are found in the KN cluster along with another true viper sequence, 
MLSP which also lacks a classical catalytic triad. This further confinns the distinctly 
different features of the BGHSP and BGLSP isofonns. 
To our knowledge this is the largest phylogenetic analysis of VVSP sequences 
perfonned to date. This has showed three clusters which are consistent with the tree 
generated by Wang et al. (2001). Though some of the sequences with known functions 
are included in each of the clusters named as P A, KN and CL, it is not as easy as Wang 
et al. (2001) suggested to name or predict entire clusters to have similar functions. As 
most of the sequences are functionally unknown and some of them are only partially 
characterised, much more experimental work needs to be done to allow a full 
understanding of any relationship between the phylogeny and functions of these 
sequences.

sequences. Their 3 clusters are indicated with different colours (KN-yellow, CL-
pink and PA-blue). The code names for the sequences are the same as in figure 
6.10. 
6.3.4 Predictions of Posttranslational modifications 
WSPs are known to N-glycosylated and the glycosylation has been shown in some 
cases to affect function (Swenson et al., 2005). Furthermore, Wang et al. (2001) 
suggested that the clotting enzymes identified in their phylogenetic tree were more 
glycosylated than other WSPs. In an attempt to test this hypothesis we have predicted 
N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites for all 150 WSPs. As our 
phylogenetic tree (figure 6.10) grouped the WSP sequences in 3 clusters which we 
have named PA, KN and CL by analogy to the Wang et al. (2001) tree, we have used 
the same clusters for the analysis of posttranslational modification predictions. 
Although these labels are not completely functionally meaningful, we have used this 
classification for the analysis and to compare with the Wang et al. (2001) data because 
the clusters do include some WSPs with the relevant functions. 
The range and average numbers of predicted posttranslational modification sites in the 
150 WSPs are shown in table 6.4. 
Post trans. Modification Range Average 
N-Glycosylation 0-6 2.38 
O-Glycosylation 0-6 1.08 
Ser-Phosphorylation 1-9 4.79

Tyr-Phosphorylation 0-5 1.88

in VVSPs. 
Averages of post translational modification predictions for each of the three clusters 
defined in the phylogenetic analysis are shown in table 6.5.

CL 3.33 1.19 4.3S 1.80 1.73 
Table 6.S The predicted average post translational modification sites in each 
category of VVSPs. 
This analysis showed that most VVSPs are predicted to be post-translationally 
modified. The glycosylation of DAASI (9%) and DAASII (4%) have been shown to 
affect the substrate and inhibitor bindings (Zhu et al., 2005). Similarly, the 
glycosylation in the other VVSPs might affect the specificity for substrate and 
inhibitors. But the location, structures and roles of glycosylation moieties in VVSPs 
needs to be investigated. Consistent with Wang et al.'s (2001) results it does seem that 
the VVSPs belonging to the CL cluster are more N- and slightly more O-glycosylated 
than other clusters. Similarly serine-phosphorylation occurs more in the P A cluster 
compared to other enzymes. 
6.3.5 Structural modelling of VVSPs 
Only 4 VVSP structures are available to date in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) though 
141 sequences are available. Modelling is a potential tool to analyse the structures of 
VVSPs whose sequences are known in order to understand their common structural 
features and possible functionally important residues. We plan to include modelled 
structures of all VVSPs in our VVSP database. Here one example of a modelled 
structure is presented: that of a plasminogen activator, GHP A. 
6.3.5.1 Important features of determined VVSP structures 
All determined structures of VVSPs have the typical serine protease fold consisting of 
two anti-parallel B-barrel domains along with a C-terminal a-helix. TSVP A (a 
plasminogen activator), ACC-C (a protein C activator), DAASI and DAASII (isofonns 
of a venombin AB, from Deinagkistrodon acutus) are the only VVSP proteins to have 
been structurally solved. Functional characterisation of TSVP A showed that aspartate 
97 and arginine 174 are important for the recognition of the plasminogen substrate and 
the importance of phenylalanine 193 for the catalytic function. The determined structure 
of ACC-C with three glycosylations on its surface suggested that they restrict access to 
the active site. The structures of DAASI and DAASII have glycosylation molecules on 
the surface and these are suggested to interfere with substrate and inhibitor binding. 
6.3.5.2 Structure modelling 
The modelled structure of GHP A, a plasminogen activator from Gloydius halys 
obtained using Swiss-Model is shown in figure 6.12. Swiss-Model used the determined 
structure of TSVP A as a template. All common features of serine proteases such as 6-
barrel domains, helices, loops and disulphide bridges are seen in the GHP A predicted 
structure. The catalytic triad (histidine-black, aspartate-red & serine-yellow), primary 
specificity pocket (black) and substrate recognition residues (aspartate 97-yellow & 
leucine 174-green) are indicated. The catalytic triad and primary specificity pocket are 
located in the same place as in the template TSVP A. Aspartate 97 is present as in 
TSVP A but arginine 174 is substituted by leucine in GHPA. It is not clear whether the 
leucine would make a salt bridge with aspartate 97 in order to bind the plasminogen 
substrate as leucine is an unlikely salt bridge partner. These two residues are located at 
the entry of the active site cleft. However TSVP A was shown to have only plasminogen 
activator activity so far, while GHPA has an additional fibrinogen clotting function. 
Thus these two proteins may have different modes of binding to their substrates. 
The Ramachandran plot calculated using Swiss PDB Viewer (Guex et aI., 1997) is 
shown in figure 6.13. This plot shows that most of residues in the predicted structure 
fall in the allowed conformational regions indicating the reliability of the modelled 
structure. 
Figure 6.12 The predicted structure of plasminogen activator from Gloydius halys 
(GHP A). The catalytic residues are shown in black, red and yellow to represent 
histidine 57, aspartate 102 and serine 195 respectively in the centre of the protein. 
The primary specificity pocket residues are shown on the left of the protein 
structure as black coloured residues. The residues aspartate 97 (yellow) and 
leucine 174 (green) present at the entry of the active site cleft are believed to be 
critical for the substrate recognition in TSVPA. The disulphide linkages are shown 
as yellow coloured rods. This figure was generated using Protein Explorer (Martz, 
2002).

plotted using Swiss-PDB Viewer (Guex et aI., 1997). 
The structure of GHPA superimposed on the template TSVPA (PDB code: IBQY) is 
shown in figure 6.14. The calculated RMS deviation between the 2 structures was 
O.4IA, indicating that the structures are very similar in most regions.

image was generated using Swiss PDB Viewer (Guex et aI., 1997). 
Modelling studies of further serine proteases would help to understand the relation 
between their sequences and structures. In the future such infonnation could be 
incorporated into our planned VVSP database. More detailed analysis may help to 
understand how small sequence changes can account for the large functional diversity 
of these enzymes. However it is likely that many of these can only be understood with 
experimental functional studies and structures determined by crystallography. 
6.4 Conclusions 
Our efforts have shown that a complete list of viper venom serine proteases of known 
sequences cannot be simply identified by a single key word search in current sequence 
databases. This is due to different naming conversations, sequencing of the same protein 
by more than one author and sequencing of some fragments. Thus we had to use a semi-
automated method to establish our dataset. To our knowledge this represents the most 
complete information about VVSPs available to date. We plan to develop a database 
with this information, in which an automated system could be used by anyone for 
obtaining information about VVSPs. 
VVSPs share features such as catalytic triad, disulphide linkages with other common 
serine proteases such as chymotrypsin. Some features, such as the C-terminal extension 
of 7 residues and an additional disulphide linkage, are unique to VVSPs. However, 
within the VVSP family there are many sequence variations which must be responsible 
for the variation in specificity of these enzymes. We have made a start in trying to 
understand the relationship between sequence, structure and function in these proteins, 
but many aspects are still unclear and there is much more to be done. 
The phylogenetic analysis of VVSPs shows three clusters of sequences which are 
consistent with phylogenetic analysis of Wang et al. (2001). Our analysis showed that 
the naming or prediction of function for each cluster is not as easy as Wang et al. (2001) 
suggested when we include more sequences as most of them are functionally unknown 
and some of them are partially characterised. This analysis shows the need to obtain 
more complete functionally known VVSPs in order to study their evolutionary and 
sequence and functional relationships. 
posttranslational modification predictions showed that all the VVSPs were predicted to 
be N-glycosylated. The functions of these modifications in VVSPs are yet to be clearly 
identified but, in several other proteins it has been proved that glycosylation affects the 
function of the protein. 
Structural analysis ofVVSPs has helped to identify the functionally important residues, 
catalytic triad, primary specificity pocket and disulphide linkages. The modelling of the 
structurally unknown plasminogen activator, GHP A has showed the similarities 
between this and its template TSVP A. The determined structures could be used as 
templates for the modelling of the remaining VVSPs, which might help to understand 
their function and their specificities towards substrates and inhibitors. However only 4 
determined structures ofVVSPs are available to date and thus more crystallisation work 
should be performed in order to solve more structures of VVSPs. 
7. Summary and Conclusions 
7. Summary and conclusions 
In this research, we have described the purification, sequencing, functional 
characterisation and crystallisation of two proteolytic enzymes: a metallo exopeptidase, 
rhiminopeptidase and a serine protease-like enzyme, rhinocerase from the venom of 
Bitis gabonica rhinoceros. In addition, the cDNA cloning, sequencing and in sitico 
characterisation of two groups of serine proteases from the venom gland transcriptome 
of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros were also described. Finally, we have described the 
computational approaches used in order to understand the sequence, structure, function 
and phylogenetic relationships of viper venom serine proteases in general. 
Rhiminopeptidase is a zinc dependent aminopeptidase A with a molecular weight of 
150kDa under denaturing conditions which has been purified using gel filtration. The 
deglycosylated protein had a molecular weight of I02kDa It is a minor component of 
Bitis gabonica rhinoceros venom. A partial internal sequence of this protein was 
obtained using mass spectrometry sequencing. The complete sequence was obtained 
through cDNA amplification with specific primers. Functional characterisation showed 
that it has aminopeptidase A, N and B activities. Aminopeptidases have been reported in 
other snake venoms but the role of these enzymes in snake venom is not understood. 
They could be involved in random activation or inactivation of proteins in the host 
system by removing their N-terminal amino acids. However further studies need to be 
performed in order to understand more about the role of this protein in snake venom. 
Anti-rhiminopeptidase antibodies were shown to bind to several proteins of different 
molecular weight both in Bitis gabonica rhinoceros and in several other viper venoms. 
However they did not bind to venom from the elapid snake, Naja nigricollis. The 
immunoblot of pre-absorbed antibodies with pure rhiminopeptidase suggests the 
absence of any contaminating antibodies which might bind to other proteins in the 
venoms. These results show that the antibody is not specific for rhiminopeptidase, but 
may bind to other metalloproteases, which have a similar catalytic domain or sequence. 
It may be specific for viper venoms, though this would need to be tested further using 
other elapid snake venoms such as those of Bungaros sp which are known to have 
aminopeptidase activity. 
Preliminary crystallisation data were obtained for rhiminopeptidase crystals, though this 
was not enough to solve the structure of this protein. Further crystallisation attempts are 
being made to obtain larger high quality crystals using improved methods such as a 
honey comb lattice which is a specific method for growing crystals of proteins with 
multiple domains (Wen et al., 2008). In the absence of a crystal structure a model 
structure of this protein was made using the complete sequence and an aminopeptidase 
template, tricorn interacting factor F3 from the archean, Thermoplasma acidophilum 
(Kyrieleis et al., 2005). The model showed that, similar to the template, 
rhiminopeptidase has four domains, but only the metalloprotease domain has a known 
function. The additional domains might play roles in the function or substrate binding of 
rhiminopeptidase. Much further research on snake venom aminopeptidases is necessary 
in order to understand their roles in venom and in envenomation. 
Rhinocerase is a serine protease-like enzyme with a molecular weight of 36kDa purified 
using a microrotofor under non-denaturing conditions. The deglycosylated protein has a 
molecular weight of 31 kDa This is the first time that this method has been used to 
purify active proteins from snake venom. The rotofor purifies proteins based on their 
isoelectric points and this is very helpful when purifying proteins from complex 
mixtures such as snake venoms. Even proteins with small pI differences can be 
separated using this method. It is possible that this approach could be used to purify 
other proteins from snake venoms without losing their biological activities. Large scale 
purification would be beneficial and could be achieved by using larger separating 
chambers. 
A partial sequence of rhinocerase was obtained by sequencing the N-terminus of the 
protein and tryptic digested peptides using the Edman method. The N-terminal sequence 
of rhinocerase matches the N-terminal short sequence of a Bitis gabonica serine 
protease obtained in previous research. But to date no one has purified and characterised 
this protein. The complete sequencing of this protein using cDNA amplification using a 
single set of primers was not successful. Further amplification with other primers will 
be necessary in order to obtain the complete sequence. Once the sequence of 
rhinocerase is known, it could be cloned and expressed in micro organisms for further 
studies such as crystallisation. 
The functional characterisation of rhinocerase showed that this is a multifunctional 
enzyme with kininogenolytic, fibrinogenolytic and fibrinolytic activities. Further studies 
to test the effect of rhinocerase on different substrates would allow us to understand 
more about the substrate specificity of this enzyme. Rhinocerase was shown to be 
insensitive to some of the common serine protease inhibitors. Further studies could be 
performed to test the sensitivity of rhinocerase to a wide range of serine protease 
inhibitors. The insensitivity of rhinocerase to naturally occurring inhibitors in the host 
system might allow the prolonged activity of this enzyme and thus increase the effect on 
the host. 
The anti-rhinocerase antibodies produced in this study bound to a wide range of proteins 
in the venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros. These proteins have a similar molecular 
weight to rhinocerase, indicating that there might also be other serine proteases in this 
venom. The immunoblot of pre-absorbed antibodies with pure rhinocerase suggests the 
absence of any contaminating antibodies which might bind to other proteins in the 
venom. Further study to analyse the inhibitory actions of anti-rhlnocerase antibodies on 
the activity of rhinocerase and other serine proteases would help to understand whether 
these antibodies are involved only in binding or also inhibit the enzyme activity. The 
antibodies could also be tested against other snake (vipers and others) venoms which 
contain serine proteases to analyse their specificity and inhibitory activity. It may be 
possible to develop toxin-specific antibodies which might be useful in the treatment of 
snake bites. These would be helpful, as serine proteases are one of the major families of 
enzymes which cause systemic effects after snake bite. However, similar studies would 
need to be performed with some of the serine proteases present in the human circulatory 
system such as thrombin to determine the cross reactivity of these antibodies with the 
host system. These studies could also be performed for the anti-rhiminopeptidase 
antibodies, to analyse the possibilities of using this antibody to inhibit the activity of 
metalloproteases as this is another major family of enzymes causing local effects after 
snake bite. If these two antibodies inhibit only the venom proteases without inhibiting 
host proteases, they could be used together to treat snake bites effectively. 
Further attempts to crystallise rhinocerase with either purified or recombinant protein 
might allow us to solve the structure of this multifunctional enzyme. Crystals from the 
purified proteins would be more useful to study the structures and functional roles of 
glycosylation moieties present on the surface of this protein. Co-crystallisation of 
rhinocerase with inhibitors and substrates or their peptides would help to understand the 
binding specificities of this enzyme. Mutational analysis could help to identify the 
structurally and functionally important residues in rhlnocerase. This information would 
further help in designing inhibitors. 
Information about the structure, substrate specificity, inhibitor sensitivity and 
functionally important residues of rhinocerase would be helpful in designing an 
irreversible inlubitor for blocking the activity of this enzyme. This could be used as an 
antidote for treating viper bites in general as VVSPs are very similar in sequence and 
structure. 
The sequence analysis of the venom gland transcriptome of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros 
showed the presence of two groups of serine protease isoforms (BGHSPs and BGLSPs). 
The molecular weight of amplified DNA from the BGHSP group of serine proteases 
was higher than that of the BGLSP group and had additional nucleotides in the 3' 
untranslated region. In total 9 serine proteases were identified by amplifying the cDNA 
with only one pair of primers. 4 of these are clearly distinct, as there are many 
differences in their nucleotide sequences. The remaining 5 differ from these by only a 
few nucleotides and thus further sequencing is necessary to confirm whether these 
substitutions are real or caused by PCR errors. However other researchers have 
demonstrated the existence of distinct serine proteases with very similar nucleotide 
sequences within the venom of a snake, so it is possible that all 9 sequences correspond 
to distinct Bitis gabonica serine proteases .. The use of additional primer pairs, DNA 
polymerase with proofreading activity (maybe Pfo DNA polymerase), reduced number 
of cycles and individual reactions would help to confirm how many of our sequences 
are real and also identify further serine proteases from the venom glands, in particular 
rbinocerase. 
BGHSPs were shown to have a classical serine protease catalytic triad and a non-
trypsin-like primary specificity pocket. Thus, though these enzymes could act as serine 
proteases, their specificity might be different. Functional analysis of these enzymes 
needs to be performed in order to understand their substrate specificities. BGLSPs were 
shown to have substituted catalytic triads and a trypsin-like primary specificity pocket 
with glutamate at the side (position 216). It is unclear whether these enzymes with 
substituted catalytic triads will act as serine proteases. Some research suggests that 
~- some serine proteases such as haptoglobin and azurodin with substituted catalytic triads 
are proteolytica1ly inactive but are involved in other functions due to the presence of 
other domains. One paper suggests that a serine protease with a substitution at the 
catalytic triad from snake venom is functionally inactive (Wu et al., 2008). However 
this is the only research article which takes this view. An alternative mechanism, 
involving a serine/lysine catalytic dyad mechanism has been shown to operate in serine 
proteases such as viral leader peptidase which belong to the clan SE. However our 
BGLSP sequences do not even have the serine component of this dyad. Thus it mayor 
may not be possible for the BGLSPs to have an enzymatic function. Cloning and 
expression followed by functional characterisation of these proteins is the only way to 
allow an understanding of their roles in venom and any catalytic function. 
One of the BGLSPs has an internal deletion of 32 amino acids. Such large deletions are 
likely to have a major effect on the structure and thus this protein may not fold or be 
functionally active. But it is interesting that the anti-rbinocerase antibodies identified a 
protein with a molecular weight of around 15kDa in the venom of Bitis gabonica 
rhinoceros and this might also be a serine protease with a significant deletion. Further 
studies are required to understand how proteins with internal deletions are synthesised, 
whether they are secreted into the venom and what roles they might play. 
We have collected a dataset ofVVSP sequences and associated data which we believe is 
the most comprehensive to date. This had to be obtained using semi-automated methods 
because not all sequences are published in databases and there is no conventional 
naming system for VVSP sequences. We have attempted to develop a standardised 
naming system and plan to integrate all the sequence and functional information into a 
web-based database to provide complete information of VVSPs to the scientific 
community. This database would need to be kept up to date using similar approaches to 
the one we used. 
The sequence analysis shows that there is a real need to increase the functional 
information about the VVSPs as most of them are functionally uncharacterised at the 
moment. Some VVSPs have only been partially functionally characterised and thus 
complete functional information for these enzymes needs to be obtained. Structures of 
only four VVSPs have been determined so far and thus there is a need to determine 
more structures of VVSPs. Our experimental research has attempted to provide 
additional sequence, structural and functional information about VVSPs. 
The sequence analysis showed that WSPs share some features in common with serine 
proteases in general, such as 5 disulphide linkages and a GWG motif and also have 
some unique features such as 18 amino acid signal and 6 amino acid activation peptides, 
a C-terminal extension of 7 amino acids and an additional disulphide linkage. Most of 
the WSPs have the classical catalytic triads but a few, including the sequences of 
BGLSPs have substitutions in their catalytic triad. There is a need for more 
experimental research to analyse whether these enzymes are functionally active or their 
possible roles in venoms. 
The residues responsible for enzyme specificity vary between VVSPs and this shows 
that they all cannot act as trypsin-like serine proteases as some could have specificity 
for non-basic amino acids of substrates. However it is currently impossible to predict 
function and specificity just based on the sequence information. The presence of several 
VVSPs with different specificities in the same venom may allow the venom to target a 
wide range of host substrates which may help them to target different prey. Venom 
serine proteases might act as digestive enzymes like trypsin and chymotrypsin in order 
to randomly digest the host proteins to disturb or arrest the physiological functions of 
prey or victim. 
The phylogenetic analysis showed three clusters of sequences which are similar to those 
previously found by Wang et al. (2001) using 41 sequences. But, even with the limited 
number of functionally characterised sequences, proteins in the same cluster cannot 
simply be assigned the same function. Thus the true situation is not as simple as Wang 
et al. (200 1) suggested, and it would not be possible to predict the function of a VVSP 
based on its location in the phylogenetic tree. 
Our research has increased the knowledge about sequence, structure and function of 
VVSPs. Clearly this is just the beginning and much more needs to be performed to fully 
understand and exploit this interesting family of enzymes. Understanding of 
aminopeptidases in snake venom is even further behind and thus there is still much 
more work to be performed. Once the complete sequence, structure and functional 
relationships of toxic enzymes from venom is understood, this would help in the 
development of therapeutics for treating snake bites and human haemostatic disorders.
