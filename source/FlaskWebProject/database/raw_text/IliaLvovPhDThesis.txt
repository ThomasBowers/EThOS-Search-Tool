Abstract
Online platforms, transaction processing systems, mobile sensors and other novel
sources of data have shaped many areas of social research. The emerging discipline
of social data science is subject to questions of epistemology, politics, ethics and
responsibility, while the practice of doing social data science raises significant
project management issues that include logistics, team communication, software
system integration and stakeholder engagement. Keeping track of such a multitude
of individual concerns while maintaining an overview of a social data science project
as a whole is not trivial. This calls for provision of appropriate guidance for holistic
project management.
The project management issues in social data science are strikingly similar to
those arising in software engineering. In this thesis, I adapt a particular software
engineering project management tool  the SEMAT Essence model (Jacobson
et al., 2013)  to the needs of social data science. This model offers a holistic
management approach by addressing key project aspects, including the often
overlooked yet crucially important ones such as maintaining stakeholder engagement
and establishing the ways of working. The SEMAT Essence is a progress tracking
model and does not assume any specific work process, which is valuable given the
great diversity of social data science projects.
To achieve this goal, I study the practice of doing social data science through
participant observation of social data science projects and by providing ethnographic
accounts for those. Using the ethnographic findings and the basic content and
structure of the SEMAT model, I develop the Social Science Scorecard Deck  an
agile project management tool for social data science. To assess the Scorecard Deck,
I use the tool in management of a social data science project and then subject the
tool to external validation by interviewing experts in social data science.

1CHAPTER ONEINTRODUCTION
The world of data is going through fundamental changes that concern the sorts of data that
are acquired, the methods and technologies that are applied to them and even the subject of
knowledge that results from these processes (boyd and Crawford, 2012). This can be colourfully
illustrated by the appearance of a range of new terms. Just a few examples are big data
(Jagadish et al., 2014), open data (Janssen et al., 2012) and data science/scientist (Davenport
and Patil, 2012; Dhar, 2013) that captures a notion that data become a subject of expertise on their
own. As Tauberer (2014) argues, while one may try to dismiss those terms as mere buzzwords,
they aid in navigation through the emerging trends in the world of data and indicate changes in
our perception of data, growing interest in them and rising expectations of them.
The changes in the world of data have a potential to provide new insights into the life of societies
and their members. In the academic environment, they allow posing and answering new questions
in social science disciplines. For example, Kitchin (2013) discusses the use of new forms of
data in human geography. Mao et al. (2011) and many others apply computationally intensive
methods to new forms of social data to forecast changes in financial markets. Many actors outside
of academia seek knowledge about people as well  businesses are looking for marketing insights
(Erevelles et al., 2016), journalists produce independent investigations of societal issues with
data-driven methods and seek to present their findings in forms digestible for wider audiences
(Gray et al., 2012), governments employ data for the needs of national security (Kim et al.,
2014), while civic movements, in turn, demand openness of data from the government (Janssen
et al., 2012) and promote unconventional use of these data to improve peoples lives (Baraniuk,
2013). Moreover, as this thesis will later show, new forms of collaboration on the intersection of
academic- and non-academic settings are also emerging.
The scope of the social issues tackled with data-driven methods also varies greatly. For example,
a study by Servia-Rodrguez et al. (2017) looks into the well-being of individuals. Many studies
2 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
look at very specific social groups and populations. For example, much of recent research
studies the behaviour of users of a particular social media platform, with Twitter being the most
frequently studied (e.g. Zubiaga et al., 2016). That being said, some studies are in fact concerned
with questions of society as a whole. For example, Burrows and Savage (2014, p. 3) report on
the experience of the Great British Class Survey  a a hybrid project, which spliced together
a fairly conventional social survey (providing accounts of actions), with a high-profile web
platform hosted by the BBC asking a battery of questions about respondents economic, social
and cultural capital.
Quite often the data employed in the new forms of social research satisfy some quantitative
definition of bigness  for example, the traditional 3Vs of volume, variety and velocity or
any of their extensions (cf. Laney, 2001; Ari et al., 2012; Marz and Warren, 2015; Kitchin,
2013)  however, this is not necessarily the case. For example, Psylla et al. (2017), in their
study of genders impact on social interactions, construct graphs of Facebook interactions
for a limited sample of students that are subsequently contextualised with other data types,
including traditional survey data. The resulting data are by no means big, but the process of their
construction (i.e. systematically gathering records of Facebook interactions, transforming them
into a meaningful dataset and putting the data into context of data from other sources) requires
actions and decisions uncommon for traditional social research.
The example above shows how the new forms of research embrace the emerging world of digital
traces that allow us to navigate back and forth between detailed and aggregated descriptions of
social processes (Latour, 2009; Procter et al., 2015). Some of these traces may be transformed
into data akin to the naturally occurring data known to traditional social sciences  e.g., some
of social media user-generated content is similar to dialogue transcripts studied by sociologists
engaged in conversation analysis (Wetherell, 1998) and some transnational data is familiar to
economics and management (cf. Hallowell, 1996; McInish and Wood, 1992). Other forms of
digital traces (e.g. sensor data) are out of scope of traditional social sciences (a detailed taxonomy
suggesting 26 types of new social data can be found in Kitchin and McArdle, 2016). The value of
data resulting from different digital traces can thus be maximised by interlinking and aggregation
(boyd and Crawford, 2012).
At the same time, as Leek (2013) points out, the issues of data sources and tools involved in
data-intensive research activities often wrongly out-shine those of adhering to the scientific
ethos, which Leek operationalises as making sure that the available data and methods are a valid
means for answering the research questions. Kakati (2017) shares this sentiment and focuses his
criticism on frequent misuse of statistical methods in data-driven studies. Yet, the complexity of
science in data-intensive research transcends mere issues of applying the statistical apparatus  it
1.1. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE DEFINITION 3
gives a new spin to key issues in epistemology (Kitchin, 2014; Burns, 2015). It may not only be
difficult to judge whether the research findings are valid  it is sometimes hard to say whether
the research questions have been correctly posed in the first place. This suggests that the crucial
aspect of scientific ethos in data-driven research should be continuous maintenance of critical,
self-reflective stance towards own research activities, which involves keeping track of- and
accounting for the decisions and operationalisations involved, understanding their limitations
and assessing the validity of the process as a whole and of the derived findings. In the world
of the ubiquitous epistemological crisis that goes way beyond research inquiry1, data-intensive
research, as a new paradigm of knowledge discovery (Tansley et al., 2009), simply cannot afford
to ignore these issues.
1.1 Social Data Science Definition
Reflecting on the discussion of the new opportunities for studying the social, the new actors
emerging in this the field and the new challenges of adhering to the scientific ethos, I would
like to suggest social data science as the key term for this thesis and to provide the following
definition:
Social data science (SDS) is the whole range of activities, both academic and
non-academic, that seek to gain verifiable and robust actionable knowledge about
societies, their groups and individual members through embracing a variety of forms
and types of data and investigating them within a self-reflective research process
using well-informed methods.
This term, while in use in the literature, is not the most popular one among those that aim to
capture the essence of new form of social inquiry. One may quite often see it as a publication
keyword (cf. Margetts, 2016; Gao et al., 2017), but there have been only few attempts to
thoroughly discuss it. Therefore, I would like to motivate my choice of terminology.
First of all, the parental term data science is certainly among the most popular ones. Burrows and
Savage (2014) show that data scientist has become a more frequent search term on Google than
statistician in 2013. At the moment of writing, the frequency of searching for data scientist is
at a historic peak with approximately 5 times more searches per month than for statistician2.
1One example of this crisis is the ongoing discussion of critical thinking and media literacy, cf. boyd (2018);
Doctrow (2018).

4 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
This off-the-chart popularity has led Davenport and Patil (2012) to famously pronounce data
scientist the sexiest job of the 21st century. Cassel et al. (2017) argue that the basics of data
science should be taught to undergraduate students of all disciplines.
Second, social data science is not an obscure term by itself either. Arguably, it is most widely
recognised within the United Kingdom. For example, multiple research initiatives unequivocally
specialise in social data science. Cardiff University hosts the Social Data Science Lab3. The Alan
Turing Institute  a national cross-university research institution in data science  has a Social
Data Science interest group4. One of its participating academic bodies, Oxford Internet Institute
of the University of Oxford, even offers an MSc in Social Data Science5. The international
recognition of social data science as a valid term may be illustrated by the University of
Copenhagens Centre for Social Data Science6 and the Social Data Science lab in Montral 7 
this is not to mention that other organisations may recognise and adopt the term without using it
as part of their title.
The most important reason for choosing the term social data science is its ability to capture the
essence of this thesis subject of inquiry and being a natural match for the suggested definition.
A particular aspect of this definition that is worth mentioning in this regard it the use of the
phrase actionable knowledge. Indeed, this phrase is something of a tautology: according to
the widely accepted Knowledge Hierarchy model (Rowley, 2007), knowledge is by definition
transferable into instructions for further actions. Yet, knowledges potential for action is worth
re-emphasising to strengthen the notion that social data science has direct impact on human lives
and society in general and thus making sure that social data science is done in accordance with
good research principles and practice is of significant societal importance.
1.2 Research Design and Thesis Structure
In this thesis, I argue that the complexity of doing social data science transcends the questions
of methodology and raises significant project management issues that include logistics, team
communication, software system integration, stakeholder engagement and ensuring compliance
with ethical and regulatory frameworks. Keeping track of such a multitude of individual aspects
while maintaining an overview of the project as a whole and ensuring a shared understanding of
the key projects decisions and operationalisations within the team is far from trivial. This calls

1.2. RESEARCH DESIGN AND THESIS STRUCTURE 5
for provision of guidance for holistic project management of social data science projects.
The project management issues in social data science are strikingly similar to those arising in
software engineering. Through decades of existence, software engineering (Sommerville, 2016)
has gone through a number of shifts to increasingly mature project management paradigms that
have led to production of numerous pieces of increasingly robust management guidance. Given
this, I propose a thesis that there is significant value for social data science in adapting the
guidance from software engineering for the needs of holistic project management and design
my research to address the corresponding goal of implementing a successful adaptation of such
guidance.
To progress towards this goal, I set out to achieve the following objectives:
1. to contextualise my work in understanding of the grand challenges that social data science
faces as a discipline;
2. to make an informed decision on what project management guidance from the field of
software engineering can be effectively adapted to social data science;
3. to discover the particular issues that arise in the practice of doing social data science, how
those issues intertwine and amplify each other and how they are dealt with by social data
science project teams;
4. combining the outcomes of objectives 1-3, to implement a tool for holistic project
management in social data science;
5. to use the implemented tool in the management of a social data science project;
6. to subject the tool to external validation.
The main body of the thesis is structured in accordance with these objectives. Chapter 2 addresses
the objectives 1 and 2 through reviewing literature on challenges in social data science (see
Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3) and on relevant project management guidance (see Section 2.4).
Chapter 3 addresses objective 3 through reporting on ethnographic case studies informed by
participant observation of social data science projects. The ethnographies produced stand as a
significant contribution on their own. Chapter 4 addresses objective 4 by discussing the processes
of systematically informing the design of a project management tool for social data science 
the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck. Chapter 5 addresses objective 5 by reporting on an
in-depth case study evaluation of the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck (see Section 5.2)
6 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
and objective 6 by providing an external evaluation of the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck
through interviews with experts in social data science (see Section 5.3).
2CHAPTER TWOKEY CHALLENGES INSOCIAL DATA SCIENCE:LITERATURE REVIEW
The Introduction has provided the definition for social data science and suggested that it is a
highly problematic field of activity. It is thus logical to proceed to a critical analysis of the major
known issues in social data science and to examine how a project management tool that captures
the lessons from software engineering may assist in coping with these issues. Given the social
nature of the discipline, I choose to start with discussion of the problematic relationships between
social data science and society.
2.1 Social Data Science and Society
In the following discussion of the relationship between social data science and society I will
draw heavily on literature in science and technology studies (STS). Indeed, as a discipline
that relies on data generated through new technologies and on methods that are implemented
in new technologies, social data science goes hand in hand with technological development
and innovation (Edwards et al., 2013; Halfpenny and Procter, 2015; Wright, 2014; Jagadish
et al., 2014). The STS frameworks can help to assess the roles of different social groups in the
development of tools and methods for social data science and to discuss the social and political
implications of this division of roles.
8 CHAPTER 2. KEY CHALLENGES IN SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1.1 Social Shaping of Supporting Technologies
As outlined above, social data science is continuously supported by technological development.
These developments do not happen in vacuum  rather, technology and society continuously
interact and shape each other (Williams and Edge, 1996). Therefore, social factors might
influence the prioritisation with which different developments that support social data science
are produced. As such, one important factor for this prioritisation is what perceived advantage a
potential technological development is expected to bring. Such advantages may, for example, be
managerial (McAfee et al., 2012), political (Janssen et al., 2012) or scientific (Raghavan, 2014).
MacKenzie and Wajcman (1999) point out that specifically the economic or business advantage
is commonly the strongest motivation force. Moreover, the technological developments for social
data science are likely to happen in the areas where growing expertise in dealing with new forms
of data leads to increasing returns on adoption (cf. Arthur, 1994) of data science.
The notions above correlate with the history of innovations that support social data science.
In its early days, social data science largely relied on so-called big data technologies
that developed in- and were adopted by large hi-tech companies. For example, the famous
MapReduce computational paradigm for parallel data processing was designed at Google
(Dean and Ghemawat, 2008). It has subsequently received an open-source implementation
in Apache Hadoop whose co-founder Doug Cutting was Yahoos employee at the time and led
the development project in this capacity (Shvachko et al., 2010). Many of the most famous
earliest methodological innovations in social data science also came from the hi-tech industry 
for example, collaborative filtering algorithms for personalisation of recommendations (Linden
et al., 2003; Das et al., 2007) and Googles PageRank algorithm for ranking importance of nodes
in larges-scale networks of linked texts (Page et al., 1999).
In the recent years, the dominance of hi-tech companies specifically in social data science has
started to decrease. First of all, the cutting-edge technical and methodological developments in
data science developments seem to have shifted from studying and predicting human behaviour,
traits and preferences (e.g. from the social side) to progressing the development of artificial
intelligence with the help of deep learning, for example, in the form of advancing speech and
image recognition techniques (LeCun et al., 2015; Dahl et al., 2012; Mordvintsev et al., 2015).
This gives a chance for later adopters (cf. Rogers, 1995) of social data science to catch up and
to critically reflect on how they can bring their experience in traditional forms of empirical social
research to new realities (Levallois et al., 2013). Appearance of new open-sourced computational
frameworks such as Apache Storm and Apache Spark (Oliver, 2014) is also a liberating change 
although those frameworks are still mostly oriented at real-time business intelligence (Apache
Foundation, nd; Oliver, 2014) in alignment with recommendations of Davenport et al. (2012),
2.1. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE AND SOCIETY 9
they are more light-weight than Hadoop, less rigid in terms of suggested data processing pipeline,
provide convenient APIs for many programming languages and thus can be repurposed with
more flexibility.
What is arguably even more important for wider adoption of social data science is the appearance
of technologies specifically for dealing with datasets whose complexity is higher than supported
by standard data analysis software such as spreadsheet software yet not high enough to require a
complex multi-node hardware infrastructure. Voss et al. (2017) refer to such datasets as small
big data. One group of such technologies facilitate parallel computations on a single multi-core
machine. For example, the Streams API for parallel computing was added to Java in version 8 of
the language (Urma et al., 2015). Python and R  Programming languages of ever increasing
popularity in the field of data analysis (Robinson, 2017)  also start supporting parallelism
through dedicated modules and packages (Raschka, 2014; Bengtsson, 2018). Utilising the
computational power of a single workstation or server is relatively straightforward compared to
technologies like Hadoop (and even Spark, cf. Zaharia et al., 2010) that are aimed at performing
computations in connected clusters of multiple computers. While Hadoop and Spark can run on a
single machine, their overheads would be disproportionately high compared to the infrastructure
complexity  and starting up a cluster is often neither feasible nor required (Stucchio, 2013).
Thanks to technological and methodological advancements, social data science has started to be
adopted by a diverse set of social actors such as journalists (Gray et al., 2012), civic movements
(Townsend, 2013), smaller businesses (Coleman et al., 2016) and authorities (Berk et al., 2016).
However, this does not by itself bring true democratisation to social data science due to the
inequalities in access to- and control of the new forms of social data themselves, which by
themselves become a valuable resource of power. The next section will look at these issues
through the prism of politics of data science.
2.1.2 Politics of Social Data Science
Social data science does not simply provide new tools and methods to gather knowledge for its
own sake. It is used by influential social actors, supports their actions and informs their decisions,
and as such it shapes society. For this reason, Green (2018) calls for data scientists to consider
themselves political actors. This idea of social data science being politically non-neutral follows
propositions of politics of technology (Winner, 1980) and the politics of method (Steinmetz,
2005; Savage, 2010). Technologies and methods, according to these schools of though, can serve
political agendas and shape the distribution of power and authority in the society  and social
data science exists on an intersection of technologies and methods.
10 CHAPTER 2. KEY CHALLENGES IN SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE: LITERATURE REVIEW
Data by themselves are also becoming increasingly political, as varying levels of data access
and control create digital divides in the society (boyd and Crawford, 2012; Savage and Burrows,
2007) and raise questions of ownership of data, human rights, and ethics and privacy (Savage
and Burrows, 2007; Ruppert, 2013). The distribution of access to new forms of social data is
strongly skewed in favour of a limited number of big corporations (Trnberg and Trnberg, 2018;
Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, 2018a). This inequality in access to data does
not only mean that other actors in social data science have a hard time competing with the big
players; it also raises questions of whether the owners of large datasets are effectively capable
of public surveillance (Fuchs, 2017, pp. 52-61, 183-207), or at least of knowing more than the
data they own immediately suggest. Indeed, social data science methods allow to use the digital
traces (Latour, 2009) that individuals routinely leave in the form of user-generated-, transaction-
or sensor data to draw reliable inferences about private aspects of human life that individuals do
not directly disclose (Kosinski et al., 2013) and to link disparate anonymised data records with a
persons identity (De Montjoye et al., 2015).
The example of using social data science as a means of gaining power unfairly that has arguably
sparked the biggest public and journalistic outcry thus far is the one related to manipulation
of voter opinions before the US Presidential Election (Rosenberg et al., 2018; Cadwalladr and
Graham-Harrison, 2018) and the Brexit referendum (Cadwalladr, 2017) in 2016. The Leave
referendum campaign and the Trumps presidential campaign were accused of using Facebook
data for micro-targeting, i.e. for selecting individual recipients of promotional messages
and for tailoring the message to the exact social, economic, demographic and psychological
characteristics of each recipient or of small groups (Papakyriakopoulos et al., 2018).
Micro-targeting was not by itself a new technique. It had been known in marketing for almost
a decade (cf. Agan, 2007). In the context of politics, its aspects were employed in Obamas
presidential campaign in 2008 (Franz and Ridout, 2010). The ethical concerns of micro-targeting
were also not new, as they started to appear almost simultaneously with the initial spread of the
technique (Barbu, 2014). Korolova (2010) questioned the ethical and privacy considerations of
using social media data for micro-targeting.
New to the 2016 scandals were the data breaches (Cadwalladr and Graham-Harrison, 2018):
Cambridge Analytica  a data analytics company that provided consultancy for the accused
campaigns  accessed data on at least 50 millions of Facebook users without meaningful consent
(Green, 2018, p. 3) and used them against the platform terms and conditions. Lack of action from
Facebook to prevent Cambridge Analytica from misusing the data further amplified the public
critique, as Facebooks own data-driven algorithms also likely contributed to Trumps victory,
albeit most probably unintentionally. The companys algorithm that compiled the Facebook
2.1. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE AND SOCIETY 11
Trending feature  a chart of the most popular news stories  did not manage to filter out
unreliable news entries, or fake news (Thielman, 2016). While there were political fake news
that supported both Trump and his opponent Clinton, the frequency of the pro-Trump fake news
was much higher (Allcott and Gentzkow, 2017). Thanks to Facebook Trending, the already high
reach of the those articles was further increased.
Interestingly, the topic of the 2016 US presidential elections can also show how social data
science can potentially empower society. Indeed, it provides an example of social data science
being used to oppose another instrument of public opinion manipulation  social media bots
that spread promotional messages while pretending to be human users. Bessi and Ferrara (2016)
use contemporary data analysis techniques to compare tweets by bots and genuine users who
support either Trump or Clinton. The findings of this study may equip those who read political
debates on Twitter with better understanding of how bots behave, so that they could spot bot
tweets in the conversations. To construct samples of bot and human post, Bessi and Ferrara
(ibid.) employ BotOrNot (Davis et al., 2016)  a bot-detection system that also employs
data-driven algorithms. Similar techniques are applied by Narayanan et al. (2017) to Twitter
posts around Brexit. Such studies demonstrate the potential social value of social data science.
The juxtaposition of these studies with the scandals surrounding Facebook, in turn, raise the
questions of responsibility and accountability in social data science.
2.1.3 Accountability and Responsibility in Social Data Science
As social data science may equally bring value to the society and, when misused, pose societal
risks, it is important to consider how the notions of responsibility and accountability can
be incorporated into its practice. Given the strong ties between social data science and
methodological and technical innovation, a natural first step in that is examination of the
responsible innovation principles. Responsible innovation is a relatively new and broad concept.
While its precise scope is a bit ill-defined, its widely cited definition is given by von Schomberg
(2011, p. 50):
A transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become
mutually responsive to each other with a view to the (ethical) acceptability,
sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable
products (in order to allow a proper embedding of scientific and technological
advances in our society).
From a historical perspective, the concept of responsible innovation can be perceived as a
12 CHAPTER 2. KEY CHALLENGES IN SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE: LITERATURE REVIEW
successor of various earlier concepts, including anticipatory governance, technology assessment,
and upstream public engagement (van Oudheusden, 2014, p. 68). The constructive technology
assessment school of thought seems to be of the most direct relevance, at it argues for assessing
technologies not through observing their impact, but through predicting it in advance (Schot and
Rip, 1997) and can help ensure that innovations meet existing societal demands (Genus, 2006;
van Merkerk and Smits, 2008). This notion is closely related to the public engagement with
science movement, which also considers responsible innovation to be its successor (Stilgoe et al.,
2014).
Responsible innovation poses the questions of who exactly is responsible, how they are
responsible and for what (Grinbaum and Groves, 2013; Stahl et al., 2013). Because of this, the
concept can be operationalised in various ways. For example, Stahl et al. (ibid.) attempt to
provide a framework for responsible and ethical developments in ICT. They identify the ethical
issues associated with emerging types of ICTs and suggest some specific institutional measures
to address those such as provision of ethical regulation for ICTs. A more general framework
for responsible innovation is suggested by Stilgoe et al. (2013). They suggest that responsible
innovation should be:
 anticipative: consequences of the developments should be predicted and evaluated in advance;
 reflexive: the steps in the developments that are already performed should be subject to
questioning and critique by the developers;
 inclusive: the developments should be public-oriented and open to public discussions and
engagement;
 responsive: the critique should bring practical actions.
This framework focuses on the core properties of responsible innovation itself rather than some
particular associated issues and measures. This makes it useful as a generic starting point for
tailoring to specific disciplines. Below I attempt to do that by formulating a list of social data
science responsibility principles.
2.1.3.1 Social Data Science Responsibility Principles
Following the lines of Stilgoe et al. (2013), I do not attempt at providing a list of specific
measures that should be taken in a social data science project to ensure responsible approach to
research  rather, I list some of the characteristics that social data science needs to satisfy to be
ethical, considerate of societal- and stakeholder interests and, overall, responsible:
2.1. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE AND SOCIETY 13
Being considerate of biases coming from data, methods and researchers. Responsible data
science should be aware of possible imperfections in data. This is especially relevant in the
modern era of big data. As boyd and Crawford (2012) put it, big does not mean good if data
fail to represent relevant characteristics of the studied phenomenon. Similarly, regardless of how
complex and flexible the methods of data analysis are, they bring along their own assumptions
and hence biases. An example of this is a study by Cannarella and Spechler (2014), who use a
complex data-driven methodology to predict the changes in the number of active Facebook users.
While arguably the most staggering result of their work is the prediction of Facebooks eventual
decline, this outcome, to their own admission, is a property of the underlying statistical model
and not of the empirical evidence. Finally, and especially important for reasoning on socially
sensitive subjects such as predictive policing (cf. Seo et al., 2018), there is a great room for a
researcher to bring their own biases and assumptions into social data science.
Supporting iterative and reflexive use of analytical modes. While the importance of
iterative and reflective use of methods in data science in general  i.e. moving iteratively
between evidence and theory and using results derived with one method to inform the use of
another method  will be discussed in detail later (see Section 2.2.1), it is worth pointing out
its specific importance for social data science from the perspective of responsibility. Iterative
reasoning motivates deeper reflective interpretations of what has been discovered. As an example
from my prior research work in social media analysis (Hutchings et al., 2015; Procter et al.,
2015), the meaning behind the quantitative figures for the most cited users on Twitter becomes
much clearer when one uses these figures to qualitatively study specific tweets by those users.
Being aware of performativity. As discussed above, research into social matters may impact
the reality studied. While this is expected of normative recommendations that can be derived
from such research, this may be an unexpected side effect of the positively stated findings (the
ones that suggest that something does happen  not that something ought to happen). MacKenzie
(2008) calls the latter effect performativity. He discusses how the work of financial theorists
influenced the market actors whose behaviour became better aligned with the positive model
predictions. Conversely, sometimes a discovery of a pattern in social behaviour may destroy it.
An example of that will be discussed later in this literature review in regard to Phillips curve
(see Section 2.2.1.1). While it may be hard to anticipate in advance whether either of the possible
perfomativity effects may take place, social researchers (including social data scientists) may
wish to try to at least anticipate what consequences those effects might bring.
Encouraging dialogue. As responsible data science is aiming at reflexivity and inclusion, it is
beneficial to do it in interdisciplinary teams that closely collaborate together. From the experience
14 CHAPTER 2. KEY CHALLENGES IN SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE: LITERATURE REVIEW
of my prior work, the results of technical data analysis can be very effectively interpreted and
contextualised within the research questions if the analysis steps are discussed and reflected on
by a wider team than includes non-technical specialists (cf. Hutchings et al., 2015). Moreover,
providing stakeholders outside a project team with some modes of feedback and critique can
also be of great aid in doing social data science responsibly. Taylor et al. (2014) show that asking
the wider public about requirements for a data-driven project poses many challenges but also
greatly informs the process.
Supporting accountability and transparency. The implication of the above is the importance
of accountability in social data science, which first and foremost means that a project team
can answer why certain decisions have been made and actions have been taken  and that they
actually provide such answers on a systematic basis (Schedler, 1999). The question of whom a
social data science team is accountable to and what for is inevitable in this context (ibid.). While
the precise answer depends on a project, it is worth pointing out that project team members share
both external accountability  i.e. to the stakeholders  and internal accountability  i.e. to each
other (Fuhrman, 1999). This relates to the notions of research transparency (Miguel et al., 2014),
reproducibility (De Roure et al., 2011; Plesser, 2018; Gent, 2013)  and, most importantly for
this thesis, to the importance of shared understanding within the research team.
As can be seen, ensuring that a social data science project is executed responsibly and supports
accountability is by itself not trivial. The following section will examine how the epistemological
issues of social data science pose an additional layer of difficulty to this problematic endeavour.
2.2 Social Data Science and Epistemology
boyd and Crawford (2012) point out that the recent and ongoing changes in the realm of data
and of their use have been shaping the very perception of what knowledge is. This suggests that
social data science poses significant epistemological challenges beyond those inherited from
the individual disciplines that inform it. Some of these challenges come from the nature of the
employed data (more on those in Section 2.2.2). Other challenges arguably transcend those
associated with data. To see why this is the case, it is useful to take a principal stance that social
data science, as much as research in general, derives (or at least strives to derive) knowledge
through applying research methods to answer research questions. Therefore, if there is a tension
between questions and methods in social data science, the notion of derived knowledge becomes
particularly problematic.
2.2. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE AND EPISTEMOLOGY 15
2.2.1 Tension between Research Questions and Methods
As shown in the Introduction, social data science is an umbrella term for a variety of research
areas. Hence, it is not entirely fair to speak about the types of questions and methods in social
data science in general. Yet, it seems plausible to argue that there is a natural tendency in social
data science to bring together questions pertinent to a social- or human study disciplines  be that
sociology, economics, psychology, HCI, marketing, etc.  and the methods of pattern recognition
in high-dimensional data  whether they go by the name of data mining, machine learning,
artificial intelligence and so forth. These types of questions and methods are in tension with each
other. What this tension exactly is will be examined below, but first it is worth looking at what it
is not to contest common misconceptions.
The tension between the questions and methods of social data science should not be cast as one
between quals and quants. Quantitative methods have a long tradition of being used in social-
and human studies. The field of economics went through a phase of intense mathematization
(Debreu, 1991, p.1) early in the second half of the 20th century. The mathematisation concerned
both the modes of communicating the economic theories (ibid.) and, thanks to the advances in
econometrics, validation of the theories empirical plausibility (Eichenbaum, 1995, p. 1609).
Other fields of social enquiry do not necessarily employ as much mathematical apparatus as a
means for theoretical modelling; however, the use of quantitative methods in empirical work is
rather routine. Data produced in experiments in psychology (and, by extension, HCI, cf. Carroll,
1997) are most often subjected to statistical analysis (Ferguson, 1971). Even in sociology, the
textbooks on empirical research would often make a point on covering both quantitative and
qualitative methods (Neuman, 2014).
Moreover, the tension does not lie between hypothesis-driven versus data-driven approach
to knowledge discovery  or, as it is often recast, between deductive (cf. Popper, 1959) and
inductive (cf. Bacon, 1620) reasoning. The existence of this tension might be partially true
for hard sciences, where deductive reasoning (effectively operationalised as first formulate a
hypothesis and then test it with data, cf. Oldroyd, 1986) appears to enjoy preferred philosophical
status (Kell and Oliver, 2004, p. 100), while the process of inductively finding knowledge
through observing patterns in data is often seen as not robust. Indeed, by the laws of logic, we
can assert effect (data) from cause (the process that generates those data and is captured by
theory), but not vice versa (cf. problem of induction, Vickers, 2014).
Inductive reasoning is common in social sciences, where research (especially qualitative) is often
aimed specifically at discovering hypotheses finding explanations from data Ritchie and Ormston
(2014). Besides, even in hard science, the inductive-deductive dichotomy is a misconception.
16 CHAPTER 2. KEY CHALLENGES IN SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE: LITERATURE REVIEW
First, hypotheses do not come from nowhere. While they can come from pure reasoning, e.g. by
theory synthesis (Whitehead et al., 2016; Tygart, 1988), they also do come from new observations,
i.e. through induction. In fact, the importance of iterative and reflective reasoning  i.e. moving
between evidence and theory and using results derived with one method to inform the use of
another method  is emphasised by many authors (Kell and Oliver, 2004; boyd and Crawford,
2012; Halfpenny and Procter, 2015). Second, as Gigerenzer (2004) points out in his critique
of the null ritual1, the statistical techniques (including hypothesis testing) are all different
attempts to address  not resolve  the problem of induction, which inevitably underlines all
science (p. 604). In fact, the null ritual, so popular among the purists of deductive reasoning,
seeks accepting non-specific (in statistical terminology, alternative) hypotheses that are often as
vague as something is not equal to zero. Such hypotheses are not falsifiable and thus unscientific
(Popper, 1959).
The real epistemological tension in social data science comes from the difficulty of interpreting
the patterns discovered in large multidimensional datasets in terms of the underlying social
phenomena  and it is those phenomena that the questions inherited from traditional social
research are interested in (cf. Ritchie and Ormston, 2014). Even if it is possible in principle, in
practice the models that result from data-intensive social research are steadily becoming black-
boxed for all practical purposes with the growth of computational powers and the complexity of
the analysis methods. This is especially true in case when the research methods involve translating
the data in human-understandable form to feature sets with features of limited interpretability
(e.g. in natural language processing) or when the features in data represent proxies for the
underlying phenomena rather than their direct measurements (more on that in Section 2.2.2).
Being fundamental to social data science, the tension between questions and methods is met by
almost everyone who does it. Therefore, either consciously or unwittingly, social data scientists
make attempts at resolving this tension between questions and methods. Those attempts normally
go into one of the two principle directions  either through re-purposing the methods or through
adjusting the questions. As reader may imagine, both options are problematic. In the following
sections, I will discuss some of the more common modes of social data science that show the
associated problems.
1Gigerenzer (2004) defines null ritual as 1. Set up a statistical null hypothesis of no mean difference or zero
correlation. Dont specify the predictions of your research hypothesis or of any alternative substantive hypotheses.
2. Use 5% as a convention for rejecting the null. If significant, accept your research hypothesis. Report the result as
p < 0.05, p < 0.01, or p < 0.001 (whichever comes next to the obtained p-value). 3. Always perform this procedure.
(p. 587).
2.2. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE AND EPISTEMOLOGY 17
2.2.1.1 Predictive social data science
Predictive social data science poses questions that quite severely differ from the traditional
ones. This mode is arguably the most closely associated with the notion of Big Data. It is
based around a central argument that the questions of causality  and thus of theorising and
explanation  are not relevant as long as correlations are examined sufficiently well for the needs
of prediction (Anderson, 2008; Mayer-Schnberger and Cukier, 2013). This line of reasoning
is akin the positivist outlook at research and has been historically contested in various context,
especially within social studies (McIntyre and Rosenberg, 2017). The revival of this idea is
arguably provoked by the dominance of data science as done by business. As businesses often
use data applications for classification and prediction (Davenport et al., 2012; McAfee et al.,
2012), they may feel relaxed about causality. This view is supported by Lowrie (2017), who
provides the following quote from an interview with a data scientist:
Its an area where its hard to separate out whether you are doing something in the
name of doing good science, or in the name of doing good business, because they
come together. (p. 6)
At least three major problems arise from this stance. Two are related to non-neutrality of social
data science (see Section 2.1) and of responsibility and accountability in this field (see Section
2.1.3). First, if predictive algorithms that emerge out of doing social data science  or rather
decisions based on those predictions  can profoundly affect society and its members, it may
be crucial to understand the why behind those decisions. Otherwise, a decision-maker who
uses a prediction system risks to not anticipate the systematic prediction errors until many false
judgements are made (see discussions of systematic errors in the algorithms used in criminal
justice systems, e.g. Kirkpatrick, 2016). Besides, it becomes harder to assign responsibility for
unjust decisions for any particular actor (Inagaki and Sheridan, 2012).
Second, while considering only correlations and not causality may be sufficient for prediction
tasks, this is not the case for planning interventions. History does know examples of interventions
based solely on empirical correlations to fail dramatically. Arguably the most famous example
of this predates social data science by decades. In the late 1950s a negative relationship between
a countrys unemployment rate and its inflation rate  the Phillips Curve  was empirically
discovered (Phillips, 1958). The US government sought to use this empirical rule to contain
unemployment by increasing the monetary base (printing money). This was done in spite of
the theoretical explanation of the phenomenon by Friedman (1968); that explanation, among
other things, suggested that the effect would wear off in the long run since economic actors
would learn to anticipate high inflation and differentiate the associated changes in salary levels
18 CHAPTER 2. KEY CHALLENGES IN SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE: LITERATURE REVIEW
from real increase in wealth. In line with Friedmans prediction, the USA experienced a major
economic crisis accompanied by simultaneous high unemployment and high inflation in 1973-75
(McNees, 1978).
The other problem with focusing social data science solely on prediction tasks is very different
in nature and has to do with the role of academic research in the face of business orientation
of predictive social data science. Trnberg and Trnberg (2018) argue that the researchers
still [at least should] seek explanation and understanding in contrast to corporate enterprises
that seek prediction and control (p. 9, italics preserved). It is thus hardly surprising that
in the field of predictive social data science the focus of academic activity among scholars
with technical background shifts from substantive research on social phenomena to evaluation
and advancement of the predictive methods themselves (Lowrie, 2017). This observation
is an interesting counterpoint to earlier suggestion by Savage and Burrows (2007) that the
advancements in academic sociology are more likely to be achieved through focusing on the
social implications of the emerging empirical methods. While both issues of accuracy and
applicability of the predictive methods and of their politics are of undoubted interest, I suggest
that there is a moral argument to be made in favour of having a place in academic research for
the more substantive social matters.
2.2.1.2 Exploratory social data science
In contrast to what predictive social data science seeks, exploratory social data science attempts
to apply novel methods to traditional research questions. It tries to employ pattern-discovery
methods and other methods applicable to high-dimensional datasets to study data until findings
that can be interpreted in terms of the underlying social phenomena are derived. In that, they
attempt to arrive at new knowledge basing on a minimum number of prior assumptions and
expectations of what variable relationships would be discovered in the data.
There are several issues arising from this approach. First, for large datasets it is not always
clear how to approach their exploration. In accordance with a prediction by Meehl (1978) that
has empirically confirmed by Waller (2004), if a dataset contains a sufficiently large number of
data points and is gathered through non-experimental research design, a difference in between-
group means for any numerical variable in two samples formed by splitting the dataset by any
categorical variable will mostly likely be shown to be significant by statistical testing. The same
logic can be applied to all relationships in data that a researcher may look at when they first
explore a new dataset, e.g. to correlations between any two numerical variables. In cases of high
dimensionality  and thus a large number of variable pairs to look at  it is easy to get lost in the
forest of all significant relationships.
2.2. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE AND EPISTEMOLOGY 19
This abundance of choices for how to start tackling a large dataset is often compounded by a lack
of prior knowledge about the subject matter. While the advantage of inductive exploration is
precisely in its ability to discover aspects of phenomena that have not been thought of before, a
researchers prior knowledge and beliefs inevitably affect what patterns they may notice in data in
the first place (Silverman, 2011; Ritchie and Ormston, 2014). Unfortunately, those prior beliefs
are not always sufficiently informed either because of insufficient interdisciplinarity of research
teams and thus a lack of subject expertise or because the subject matters are novel by themselves.
For example, Ruths and Pfeffer (2014) show why prior concepts of social relationships do not
perfectly apply to user interactions on social media platforms.
As a result, while doing exploratory social data science requires considerable effort and often
leads to findings that are impressive in statistical terms, their substantive interpretation
sometimes appears to be somewhat underwhelming. For example, Stopczynski et al. (2014)
provides an overview of key findings from a number of exploratory social data science projects
that all relied on data collected from mobile devices belonging to large samples of a human
population. For some of the cited studies, their key findings are as follows:
 People exhibit strong patterns in day-to-day mobility with a small number of frequented
locations (data on 100 thousand people studied).
 Individuals tend to maintain active communication with a limited number of close social
contacts (data on 20 million people studied).
 People with greater network of contacts tend to be presented with more economic opportuni-
ties (data on 65 million people studied).
Arguably, all three findings are expected with the first one being on a verge of obviousness since
most people have to travel to their place of work or study from their home on a daily basis. If
anything, such findings manage to show that the employed data collection methods do not lead to
data that suggest false findings. But then again, a method of studying human mobility arguably
needs to be off by a very large margin not to notice the existence of day-to-day patterns, and
just showing that the method can pick up those is not a strong proof of its reliability. Overall,
while there is value in confirming common knowledge and intuition with data, arguably there is
a mismatch between the scales of the underlying datasets and the substantive significance of the
findings.
20 CHAPTER 2. KEY CHALLENGES IN SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.2.2 Data Sources and Naturally Occurring Data
Another set of epistemological issues result from social data sciences reliance on data that are not
generated for the research purposes and within a controlled research process but occur naturally
as a by-product of human activities. Such naturally occurring data raise multiple concerns as
they are not tailored to a studys research questions and are often not controlled by a researcher.
Even though social sciences have a long tradition of dealing with naturally occurring data and
thus have experience in handling the associated concerns (Levallois et al., 2013), the new forms
of data and the related research questions often elevate the associated problems to a new level.
First of all, in social data science the data often serve as a mere proxy for underlying phenomena
of interest that are not observable (at least not practically). For example, when using social
media data to monitor public reactions, one has to come up with operationalisations for what a
reaction is and how a sentiment of that reaction should be interpreted. Lee et al. (2016) shows
that, depending on psychological characteristics of an individual, pressing a like button on
Facebook may have two distinct meanings  one is showing the appreciation of the posted
content and the other is attempting to get affirmation from others. Moreover, even the forms of
behaviour that do have direct analogues outside the virtual forms of interaction (such as dialogue)
are also shown to be carried out differently online (Bruns and Stieglitz, 2014).
A closely related issue is that of sample self-selection: for social media, the data come only
from the platform users; even for the most ubiquitous mobile devices such as smartphones,
the data come only from those device users who opt into data collection. In both examples,
non-participation is likely to be associated with a certain demographic profile (Ruths and Pfeffer,
2014), degree of technological savviness (Costello et al., 2016) and possibly other personal traits.
Thus, any findings derived from naturally occurring data have to treated with caution when
generalised outside the data-producing environment.
Natural occurring data may also be biased by a researchers attempt to select relevant records.
This problem will be discussed later in more detail within one of the case studies (see Section
3.3.4). In brief, it is a common task to identify the needles in a haystack of data, for example,
posts on a particular topic among all social media posts from the platform studied. Two entangled
problems may arise. First, the concept of a relevant entry is a fundamentally problematic
one. For example, social media data are often conversational, so it may often be desirable to
preserve the entirety of such conversations (Pennock, 2013; Voss et al., 2016). However, it may
happen that only distinct posts within the conversation are on topic. Second, it is not trivial to
operationalise the notion of relevance as a set of practical data selection criteria. For example,
selecting social media data by hashtags has its limitations. Experience from my prior work
2.3. ETHICS IN SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE 21
shows that some hashtags can be used in multiple contexts (Procter et al., 2015). Simultaneously,
Gonzlez-Bailn et al. (2014) show that accidental omission of some less popular topical hashtags
may significantly skew descriptive statistics of the resulting sample of tweets.
Finally, even if some naturally occurring data are justifiably operationalised to the research
questions and are acquired in accordance with appropriate data selection criteria, they still may
pose research problem due to their limited quality. For example, there are severe concerns about
the veracity of health data collected by the Apple smartphones: their built-in pedometers, while
performing quite accurately in laboratory conditions, are shown to have an error margin of more
than 20% in the wild (Duncan et al., 2018). In other cases, data may be accurate but contain
plenty of missing values. For example, Twitter is known for having geolocation coordinates in
only 5% of the platforms posts (Graham et al., 2014).
2.3 Ethics in Social Data Science
While explicitly mentioned only in brief, the theme of ethics in social data science has been
underpinning much of the discussion above, as the notion of ethics is in general deeply intertwined
with those of responsibility (cf. Keenan, 1997; Tauber, 2005; Knights and OLeary, 2006) and
politics (cf. Baron, 2001; Bellamy, 2010; Green, 2018)  not to mention the crucial role of ethics
in modern research traditions. Many ethical issues in social data science have thus been already
mentioned  and a more detailed review of them may be a subject of its own thesis. Yet, it is
still worth to re-iterate that the public discourse around ethics in social data science and the
corresponding ethical guidance and legislation are all in active development, most actively in the
context of privacy. The famous suggestion by boyd and Crawford (2012) that [j]ust because
[data are] accessible does not make [them] ethical (p. 671) immediately poses the question
of what does make them so. As Voss et al. (2016) (citing Cate and Mayer-Schnberger, 2013)
put it, there is a question [of] whether or not ticking a box when signing up [...] constitutes an
acceptable indication of consent (p. 169). Even though some outline solutions  e.g. the one of
social contracts (Martin, 2016)  are being provided, those are hardly definitive.
The changing landscape of actors actively involved in research (see Section 2.1) provides an
additional layer of complexity. The scandal around the study by Kramer et al. (2014) that
involved a mass experiment run by Facebook to manipulate emotional state of the platforms
users showed some of the existing mismatches in assumptions about ethics  mismatch between
the ethical expectations towards industry (and marketing research) versus towards academia
(and non-for-profit research), and in data scientists versus the publics understanding of consent
(boyd, 2014; Felten, 2014). The ethical pressures on the industry are arguably catching up
22 CHAPTER 2. KEY CHALLENGES IN SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE: LITERATURE REVIEW
with those on academia in the face of appearing new scandals such as the recent Cambridge
Analytica one (Cadwalladr, 2017). The fast pace with which the discussion  and the sheer
scope of the actors involved (Crawford, 2014)  unfolds can be illustrated by the fact that even
academics (such as both boyd and Crawford in their respective pieces) often prefer to weigh in
on the conversation in blog posts and opinion pieces rather in peer-reviewed publications.
The evolving nature of discourse on ethics in social data science has ramifications for the
field well beyond moral ones  it affects the way the field is governed, for example through
influencing the legislation. Arguably the biggest recent change in this regard is the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) that significantly increased the rights of European residents and,
at least in principle, gives them control over the data organisations store on them (European
Parliament, 2016). Such changes in legislation impact social data science both directly and
indirectly. Directly, they may affect the logistics of handling the data collected for research. For
example, GDPR forces researchers to track and rigorously record their decisions in regard to
collecting, storing and archiving data (Dickson and Sigala, 2018). Indirectly, the data legislation
changes cause usual external data sources to change their own data sharing policies and license
agreements, which has arguably even more significant consequence for social data science than
the direct legislation effect. For example, Twitter stopped returning user profile timezones via
their public API in the face of GDPR (Piper, 2018).
In addition to formal legislation, there are also guidance sources that are not legally binding
but may still have authority. An example of such guidance at the national level may be the
Data Ethics Framework in the UK (Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, 2018b).
At the international level, the IEEE standard on algorithmic bias considerations (IEEE, 2017),
which is currently under development, is a relevant example. Such guidance may influence the
public discussion of ethics and may raise the bar of expectations towards ethics in social data
science, thus driving more ethical research in both for-profit (through pressure from customers)
and non-for-profit (through pressure from funders) sectors. This forms a system of informal
institutions (Stiglitz, 2000) that govern the ethical landscape.
Overall, it is impossible to simply deal with ethics and be done with it in a social data science
project. If research team members do not continuously ask themselves whether what they do
is ethical  which also includes monitoring the landscape of the public discussion surrounding
social data science and of the relevant legislation  they risk to accidentally dismiss some ethical
dilemma simply because they fail to recognise its difficulty. This may not only negatively impact
those affected by the research, it can also damage the researchers themselves, especially since
they may be subjected to public backlash, to sanctions by their employers or even to legal
consequences for their actions.
2.4. RESEARCH GUIDANCE AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT 23
2.4 Research Guidance and Project Management
The discussion above shows that social data science is an activity performed in a highly
problematic context of political, epistemological and ethical challenges. Those challenges are
amplified by the logistics of social data science  project teams have to manage IT infrastructures,
stakeholders engagement and their own work. Under such circumstances, keeping track of the
research process and maintaining shared understanding within a research team is non-trivial. Yet,
as shown in Section 2.1.3, such shared understanding is central to success in responsible social
data science. This calls for provision of guidance for social data science teams that would help
the teams to incorporate all the core aspects of a social data science project into their collective
consideration.
Different pieces of guidance relevant to social data scientists are indeed appearing. Section 2.3
has mentioned examples in the realm of research ethics. Most of the appearing guidance focuses
on methodology. For example, the book by Krishnan and Rogers (2015) guides businesses on
modern types of social analytics. I have contributed to a handbook for social media research
(Sloan and Quan-Haase, 2017). Finally, some limited guidance on management of social data
science teams also exists. For example, Patil (2011) discusses the key competencies of social data
scientists depending on their area of specialisation and suggests appropriate recruiting tactics.
Being focused on specific aspects of doing social data science, the examples of guidance above
can be of great value when a social data science project faces a particular issue and the team
member responsible for it requires additional advice. However, they are not tailored to observing
the bigger picture of a project. Moreover, if the goal is not only to see this bigger picture but
to share its vision across the whole team, a form of guidance that would spark collaborative
discussions (Bokhour, 2006) would be optimal. Long policy documents and books are arguably
better suited for a focused read than for interactive environments such as team meetings. A
form of guidance that would be more appropriate to the tasks at hand is a holistic project
management tool. Such a tool should provide a common talking point that all team members
can use regardless of their disciplinary background. In that, it can help social data science teams
 consider the potential issues as early on in the project as possible;
 keep track of the project state, of the decisions that went into it and of their provenance;
 ensure that the whole team is aware of changes in project circumstances and of their effects
on key project operationalisations.
24 CHAPTER 2. KEY CHALLENGES IN SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE: LITERATURE REVIEW
While thus far social data science lacks its own systematic project management guidance that
could be turned into such a tool, there are a number of disciplines that have provided substantive
contributions to knowledge in project management and thus may potentially provide a starting
point. For example, project management is (perhaps unsurprisingly) often a focus of management
studies (e.g. Meredith and Mantel, 2012). More discipline-specific guidance appears, for example,
in the field of industrial engineering (Kerzner, 2003). Arguably more directly relevant to social
data science (and data-driven research in general) is project-level guidance from the field of
research data management (Ball, 2012).
Software engineering (Sommerville, 2016) is another field that has been making substantive
contributions to project management over the years, with these contributions being increasingly
accepted across other fields (e.g. Richards, 2007). In the next section I will show that the fields of
software engineering and social data science, despite their differences in the goals and nature of
work, have a very significant overlap in key concerns of both hard (technical) and soft (logistics
and management) nature. This overlap is crucial for successful adaptation of holistic guidance,
as such guidance is meant to tackle multiple core project aspects at once. This makes project
management guidance from software engineering uniquely positioned to be adapted to social
data science. It is worth noting that this does not make project management experience of other
fields irrelevant: the latter may be successfully adapted to tackle specific issues in social data
science as and when appropriate.
2.4.1 Relevance of Software Engineering Project Management Guidance
to Social Data Science
There are multiple reasons why project management guidance in software engineering tends to
address concerns pertinent to social data science. To start with the obvious, doing data science
in general often requires software development. Kim et al. (2016) argues that data scientist
has become a legitimate role for a member of a software development team and points out that
many data scientists write actual production code. However, even when software development
is not required, social data science happens in the context of a projects software- and wider IT
infrastructure (see Section 2.1.1). This is similar to how software engineering mostly involves
extension of preexisting systems and integration with legacy infrastructure (Finkelstein and
Kramer, 2000, p. 6). Furthermore, software engineers do not necessarily seek to make such
extensions through building software from scratch, as an organisations needs may often be
partially resolved through purchasing and integrating software (Daneshgar et al., 2013) and
configuring the resulting system (Sommerville, 2008).
As much as social data science, software engineering requires careful stakeholder engagement
2.4. RESEARCH GUIDANCE AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT 25
since the stakeholder needs inform the software requirements (Harker et al., 1993). The problem
of understanding stakeholder needs and eliciting requirements has been long acknowledged
and supported with extensive discussion (cf. Jirotka and Goguen, 1994). Active involvement of
project stakeholders and recognition of their contributions is known to increase the chances of
a software engineering project success (McManus, 2004) and recent attempts to involve wider
social groups as project stakeholders (cf. Lohmann et al., 2009) only strengthen the parallels
with social data science.
Arguably the most important similarity between social data science and software engineering
is the non-linear process of work and iteration. As much as research questions, design and
methods are iteratively refined in the face of limitations (limited availability of data, high costs
of computation) and incoming evidence (interim findings), modern agile software engineering
methods support continuous refinement of system design and requirements in response to the
development iterations (Vlaanderen et al., 2011; Leffingwell and Widrig, 2000, pp. 225-310).
These modern methods have become prominent in the face of the limitations that older approaches
including the linear waterfall software development model (Aitken and Ilango, 2013). Hence,
using them as a starting point to inform project management in social data science would allow
to capitalise on the maturity of software engineering as a discipline.
2.4.1.1 Limitations of Software Engineering Guidance
The discussion above justifies applicability of software engineering project management guidance
 and especially of the modern tools that adhere to the agile philosophy  to social data science.
With that in mind, it is worth to discuss two characteristics common among the popular agile
models that present a challenge for the process of their adaptation.
First, the models tend to suggest quite a rigid way of working. For example, the DSDM model
(Stapleton, 1999) forces a defined set of roles on team members. SCRUM (Schwaber and Beedle,
2002) is more flexible and supports cross-functional development teams, however it implies a
set of specific events through which the project is managed. Such strict methods may well be
valuable for many social data science projects, especially the ones done in industrial environment
under time pressure. More generally, however, the extreme variety of social data science projects
calls for a project management tool that would be agnostic to such specificities.
Second, popular agile models tend to put less emphasis on the soft issues such as stakeholder
engagement than required in social data science. For example, SCRUM suggests a single
individual to bear the role of the product owner and effectively be responsible for delivering all the
requirements to the development team (Schwaber and Sutherland, 2017). This is hardly possible
in software engineering practice: in fact, Sverrisdottir et al. (2014) show that organisations use
26 CHAPTER 2. KEY CHALLENGES IN SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE: LITERATURE REVIEW
different methods to resolve this issue depending on their individual circumstances. Arguably,
for multi-stakeholder social data science projects having a research artefact owner is even less
sufficient.
In response to the critique above, I suggest that a tool that could potentially be most successfully
adapted to social data science should provide a space of core concepts2 in which software
engineering projects, their core aspects and the associated issues could be described  and should
not try to construct a normative model for the way of running such projects. There is one tool
that matches this description particularly well  the SEMAT Essence (OMG, 2015). Indeed,
according to its underlying vision statement, the mission of SEMATs efforts is to identify
and describe the elements that are essential to all software engineering efforts (Jacobson et al.,
2009, p.2). The following section will introduce this tool in detail and show why it is specifically
appropriate to be adapted to holistic project management in social data science.
2.4.2 The SEMAT Essence
The Essence of Software Engineering (Jacobson et al., 2013) is a series of tools developed by
SEMAT (Software Engineering Method and Theory) Inc. and accepted as an Object Management
Group (OMG) standard (OMG, 2015). Underlying the SEMAT Essence is a formal language
that can be used to describe the generic properties of projects in different fields. The language
suggests to conceptualise project types through their area of concerns that contain core aspects
(called alphas or kernels), suggest a set of activities to undertake (activity spaces) and require
certain competencies to be dealt with. Figure 2.1 employs this language to represent the three
areas of concern in software engineering, their core aspects (alphas) and their relationships.
The basic model of SEMAT Essence, which is also known as Essence Lite (SEMAT Inc., nd),
breaks each of the alphas into a set of consecutive states through which the alpha has to go,
so that the first state is achieved close to the project set-up and the last is (hopefully) achieved
at the time of project completion. In turn, each state is assigned a list of conditions required
for its achievement. This model allows to plan a software engineering project holistically by
considering its many aspects from the start and continuously assess the progress of a project
by tracking the states that different alphas have achieved. The model is particularly powerful
at identifying reverse salients (cf. Hughes, 1993), i.e. relatively weaker progressed project
aspects.
2The use of terminology here is inspired by the work of Grdenfors (2000), who introduces the term conceptual
space. That said, I specifically restrain myself from using the exact term to avoid confusion with Grdenforss
interpretation of conceptual spaces as geometric spaces in which mapping of concepts to their quality dimensions in
human thought process can be represented.

SEMAT implement this model as a set of cards for each alpha (listing their states) and each state
(listing their conditions) that can be printed and filled in as an interactive exercise by a project
team. Figure 2.2 provides examples of such cards.
The SEMAT Essence card deck is an excellent tool to adapt to social data science for two reasons.
First, it is method-agnostic: by focusing on what has to be achieved, it omits the questions of
when (temporal aspect) and by whom (division of labour). By virtue of including the Way of
Working alpha, the Essence insists on adopting some method by a software engineering team 
but what that method should be is project-dependent. Thus, the SEMAT model does not aim to
replace method models  it is aimed to be used in conjunction. For example, there is an initiative
for integrating the SEMAT Essence with SCRUM (Ivar Jacobson International, 2017).
Second, the SEMAT Essence does not simply acknowledge the existence of soft issues in
software engineering project management, but rather puts them on par with the technical ones.
The Customer area of concern contextualise the work on software development in the needs of

the stakeholders who require a software solution. The Endeavour area of concern looks at the
logistics of turning the requirements into the software solution and tackles the issues of team
management and organising the work. The technical aspects still get their representation through
the Solution area of concern.
Overall, the SEMAT Essence model is generic, versatile, holistic and covers many areas of
concern that intersect with those in social data science. It can be adapted to social data science
by borrowing the overall structure (areas of concern  alphas  states  conditions) and, where
appropriate, the content of the cards. I demonstrate the results of this in Chapter 4.
2.5 Chapter Summary
This literature review shows that social data science is an impactful activity performed in the
context of social, political, epistemological and ethical challenges. Given this problematic
context, social data science should be done responsibly. Research teams need to account for
their decisions, as well as for the circumstances that led to them, and to maintain a shared
understanding of those throughout the research process. Therefore, social data science teams
would benefit from a project management toolkit. The SEMAT Essence model employed in
software engineering projects (Jacobson et al., 2013) seems to be a particularly appropriate
starting point to develop a project management tool for social data science, as this model covers
many related areas of concern while not assuming any particular work process. The following
chapter will inform the proposed project management tool through a range of case studies,

with each case representing a single social data science project studied through participant
observation.
3CHAPTER THREEINFORMING THE PROJECTMANAGEMENT TOOL:CASE STUDIES
3.1 Methodology
Following on from the discussion of the need for a holistic project management tool for social
data science, I now report on the fieldwork undertaken to inform the tool. One purpose of this is
to discover previously unknown issues pertinent to social data science projects, to see how issues
manifest themselves in practice, whether different issues are intertwined and if they amplify each
other. The other goal is to study how these issues are dealt with within the parameters of real-life
projects and their constraints  be that time, resources or experience.
The planned work is thus focused on discovering phenomena and describing them rather than on
making testable claims. This strongly suggests using qualitative, exploratory research methods.
The limited scope of the PhD studies implies that I had to make a choice on how much to rely
on breadth-oriented methods that would allow gathering limited evidence from a broad range
of social data science projects (for example, interviews or focus groups with panels of experts
in social data science) and how much to rely on depth-oriented fieldwork methods that would
allow me to observe a limited number of chosen projects. I made a choice to focus on the
depth-oriented option and to employ case study design to inform the tool. The reasons are as
follows:
 the goals of the work suggested a particular interest in the longitudinal aspect  not simply
seeing the issues in social data science, but also how they evolve in time and how project
32 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
teams adapt to them;
 given the complexity and fundamental uncertainties (Grabe, 2005) of research, it seemed
detrimental to rely on participant recall in the process of discovering issues in social data
science projects  to employ an old metaphor, the devil was likely to be in details;
 orientation on breadth would most likely imply relying on the perspective of one particular
project member in regard to every project, while in in-depth studies I could, through
communicating with various project members, harness a more comprehensive picture
especially valuable given the holistic nature of the suggested project management tool;
 ultimately, since I still had to make the final step of transferring the observations into
recommendations embedded into the project management tool myself, I wanted to approach
this step with deep understanding of the discovered issues that could be missed in breadth-
oriented methods.
In this chapter, I describe several case studies, each representing a single social data science
project. For the two primary case studies I provide complete ethnographies (see Sections 3.2
and 3.3), while two additional case studies (see Section 3.4) provide selected fieldwork evidence.
While the details of how the full ethnographies were logistically carried out are provided in the
respective sections, here I would like to start with providing an overarching background to the
ethnographic work.
3.1.1 The Role of Prior Experience in Social Data Science
The ethnographic work I have undertaken as part of this research was supported by my past
experience both in studying the individual disciplines that contribute to social data science and
in participating in actual social data science projects. Being trained as an economist, I was
exposed to almost extreme poles of the quants and quals spectrum of studying the social
world. My undergraduate degree provided a strong background in empirical quantitative methods
through modules such as Econometrics and Economic Statistics. On the other hand, I got
introductory training in empirical sociology and was even exposed to social theory that preceded
the prevalence of empirical method through a full module on Das Kapital (Marx, 1867). My
MSc studies at the School of Computer Science enhanced my technical skills and provided me
with basic training in machine learning (which I subsequently expanded through self-study),
while the work on my MSc thesis found me doing empirical research through surveying and
interviewing experts in the field of data journalism.
3.1. METHODOLOGY 33
Furthermore, in the gap year between my MSc and PhD studies I provided consultancy to a
social data science project where I performed social network analysis of Twitter data around
the 2012 London Olympics (Willis et al., 2015), studying relationships among the participating
actors and between actors on one side and the web content they shared as hyperlinks on Twitter
on the other side. Another short research project reported in Hutchings et al. (2015) exposed me
to doing mixed-methods research using Twitter and Facebook data around the Sochi Olympics
in 2014. Indeed, this work had interrelated components that might separately fit traditional
qualitative or quantitative orientations (Tashakkori et al., 2015, p. 620), as the quantitative
analysis of the data was employed to identify the most influential postings and the most salient
topics that in turn were then analysed through in-depth reading.
Thanks to this prior experience, I could engage in immersive field work combining observation
with participation (Dourish, 2006, p. 542) from day one in each case study. In correspondence
with the ethos of ethnography, I tried to not merely collect data on what I observing, but to
engage in continuous analytical interpretation with an aim of deep understanding of the observed
processes and with an end-goal of expressing that in analytical reportage (Anderson, 1994).
The initial experience provided me with a head-start in understanding contexts of the studied
projects. Additionally, I could be involved as a participant (i.e. a project team member) and
study the work through first-hand experience. Finally, sharing at least some of the professional
language with the rest of the teams facilitated engagement in meaningful conversations, while
being predominantly quantitatively trained helped to quickly spot the language mismatches that
I had with the qualitative analysts in the teams.
3.1.2 Ethnography for Design: Justification
As Anderson (1994, p. 156) points out, ethnographies are often under attack by fundamentalism
from left and right. Some attackers claim a lack of generalisability by denying that the depth and
analytical nature of an ethnography can actually compensate for its inevitably limited breadth.
Other attacks hold intervention and subjectivity against ethnographies: according to them,
an ethnographer distorts the data on the observed social processes first through potentially
influencing them through sheer co-presence (ibid.)  let alone participation  and then through
providing a necessarily subjective account of what was observed (Dourish, 2006). Moreover, the
defenders of ethnographic approach (cf. ibid; Anderson, 1994; Voss et al., 2009) question the
premise of eliciting recommendations from ethnography. Below I provide a response to those
critiques within the scope of this thesis and its goals.
34 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
3.1.2.1 Generalising from Case Studies
The issue of generalisation is relevant to my work. While the ethnographic case studies aim to
stand on their own  i.e. to be valuable analytical reportage on the experience of social data
science projects  they are ultimately used to inform a project management tool applicable in a
variety of social data science projects.
First, the presented research does not claim the findings of the ethnographies themselves to be
fully generalisable or complete. The problem of induction suggests that empirical research is
inherently incremental and relies on the replication of results by independent people and means
(Gigerenzer, 2004; Vickers, 2014). I acknowledge the limitations of this study and and will
be more than happy to see future efforts that could revise and expand its findings. What truly
matters though is that this study does provide new insights into what it takes to do social data
science.
Second, since the case studies serve a particular purpose of informing the project management
tool, it is more important whether this resulting tool has wider applicability and usefulness. I
attempt to evaluate these later in the thesis (see Chapter 5). The combination of the employed
evaluation methods allow for both breadth and depth of the assessment, as the tool is appraised
by a range of interviewed experts in social data science of different levels of seniority and is also
employed for project management in an additional evaluation case study.
Yet, it is still worth discussing why the generalisability concerns did not prevent choosing
the ethnographic approach to inform the project management tool in the first place. First,
given the setup of this research, the tool can draw not on one project, but on a range of case
studies. The case studies represent sufficiently different facets of social data science and thus
take account of probable relevant heterogeneity within the population (Gomm et al., 2009,
pp. 98-115) of projects, while retaining some of the key complexity dimensions associated
with social data science  interdisciplinarity, variety of employed data sources, methods and
infrastructural components, and management of stakeholder interests. Moreover, participant
observation facilitates a very deep level of immersion in the studied projects that suggests a
possibility to compare and contrast the findings from different case studies and determine which
phenomena are caused by particularities of a study and which by the social data science core of
the studied projects. In other words, it is possible to make analytic generalisations (Yin, 2012, p.
18). Finally, the case studies do not inform the project management tool in vacuum but rather
in the context of literature on social data science (see Chapter 2).
3.1. METHODOLOGY 35
3.1.2.2 Intervention and Subjectivity
Anderson (1994) groups the concerns of subjectivity and intervention together, since they both
deal with the purity of the data. As Dourish (2006) points out:
Ethnographic data are not unproblematically extracted from a setting, but generated
through an encounter between that setting and the ethnographer. (p. 544).
Yet, a researcher plays a role in shaping the data regardless of the form of social inquiry. For
example, when conducting closed-question surveys, a researcher influences the outcomes both
through wordings of the questions and simply through the list of questions asked (Dillman et al.,
2014)  and thus by their conceptualisation of the studied phenomena. Within the ethnographic
approach, the influence of a researcher is not left implicit in the data (Dourish, 2006, p. 544),
but is stated openly and critically reflected upon. Thus, when discussing the case studies, I
provide detailed accounts of my relationship with the project and my role in the team (for
example, see Section 3.1), indicate my influence on particular episodes (for example, see Section
3.3.4.1) and show how my perspective may be different from that of the other team members
(for example, see Section 3.2.7.3).
Moreover, my involvement in the projects as part team member and part PhD student doing
fieldwork allowed me to see both the bigger picture and the specifics of being involved in the
projects. I would argue that both components are essential for deep understating. Judging from
my past experience, without the general ethnographic aims in mind I would likely be preoccupied
with my immediate tasks too much to make sense of the projects as a whole. Conversely, without
being a member of the project teams, I would not have so much naturally occurring interactions
with the other team members and would arguably struggle to internalise the motifs behind the
observed work and the way of thinking that someone doing social data science may have.
3.1.2.3 The Issue of Is and Ought
Employing ethnography to formulate advice that should be captured in a project management
tool is problematic in similar ways to using ethnography to gather requirements for software
systems. Anderson (1994) and Dourish (2006), who discuss the value of analytical ethnography
(as opposed to scenic fieldwork (Button, 2000, p. 319) in system design, point out that this
value often does not lie in requirements specification and that the most effective outcome of a
study might be to recommend what should not be built rather that to recommend what should
(Dourish, 2006, p. 545). Voss et al. (2009) pose the problem in terms of is and ought  while
36 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
an ethnography provides a perspective on what the experience of participating in the studied
setting is, by itself it cannot provide recommendations for what ought to be happening.
I do not seek to find a resolution to this conundrum. Rather, I accept the stance that a normative
prescription has to come from an argument rather than direct observation. Still, there are two
reasons why moving from is to ought in this research project is less problematic than in
many others. First, the studied projects involved working in iterations. For some, the length
of an iteration could be several months passing between the rounds of reporting (see Sections
3.2 and 3.4.1), while for one project the iteration length was one week that passed between two
subsequent episodes of a data-driven radio show that the project was informing (see Section
3.3). The iterative work allowed to refine the process and resolve challenges discovered earlier.
Therefore, the fieldwork provided direct evidence on how taking care of a particular project
aspect could improve the overall research process.
Second, as the envisioned project management tool is to be based on the SEMAT Essence model
Jacobson et al. (2013), the required oughts have to take a form of what ought to be achieved
rather than how it ought to be achieved. The lack of specificity on the how side means that,
even if the way a specific challenge is handled in a particular studied project would not be not
optimal in different sets of circumstances, the sheer facts of handling provides a strong idea of
the respective ought.
Now that the ethnographic approach to the fieldwork is methodologically justified, I can turn to
the discussion of the case studies.
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 37
3.2 Evaluation of the Shakespeare Lives Cultural
Programme
This section studies a research project that aimed to evaluate a yearlong Shakespeare Lives
cultural programme led by the British Council. The project was hosted by the Open University
but many of the team members, including myself, were consultants from a variety of UK
institutions. The team evaluated the Shakespeare Lives programme across several dimensions
with an emphasis put on the assessment of the programmes impact and value across different
social media platforms.
Shakespeare Lives was an international programme centred on the commemoration of William
Shakespeare and his legacy in the context of the 400th anniversary of his death. The programme
started in early January 2016 and lasted until the end of that year. It constituted of a variety
of online and offline events and activities including world tours of renowned theatrical troops,
nationwide school competitions and the production of modern takes on Shakespeares heritage
such as short YouTube clips and Instagram picture series.
The programme was led by the British Council with support offered by multiple cultural, funding,
and marketing partners across the globe. The British Council is a UK charity operating worldwide,
whose declared aims include (British Council, 2016b):
 To foster multicultural cooperation in the fields of science, arts, sports and education;
 To provide educational opportunities worldwide;
 To provide engagement with the UKs culture, society, education and arts;
 To contribute to the international knowledge of the English Language and of the UK.
While the British Council is not a state organisation, it receives substantive state funding and
it supports the UKs national interests and priorities (British Council, 2016a; Nye, 2004).
Specifically, the British Council aims to promote the UK as a welcoming country that values
diversity, mutuality, innovation and creativity.
As the centennial of William Shakespeares death reinforced public attention to his art, the
Shakespeare Lives programme offered a one-off opportunity for the British Council to reach 
and potentially influence  new audiences. To seize this opportunity, the British Council decided
to put an unprecedented (by their standards) large emphasis on using social media to host,
disseminate and promote the contents of the programme. This included both creating content
specifically for social media and using social media to raise awareness of the programmes offline
38 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
events. This is an uncommon practice for the British Council, as the organisation most frequently
uses social media in a routine, not event-driven manner, e.g. to maintain educational public
pages (for example, see the LearnEnglish  British Council Facebook page1). The nature of
the Shakespeare Lives programme asked for an external evaluation project. The next section
provides an overview of the project and, through this, sets up the case study.
3.2.1 Case Overview: the Evaluation Project
The evaluation project was commissioned by the British Council, who needed to have an
independent assessment of their performance for internal purposes as well as to report to the joint
funders of the programme, the GREAT Britain Campaign  the UK Governments international
promotional campaign first launched in 20122 (see Section 3.2.3.1 for more details on the
relationship between the British Council and the project team).
The project was run by a team of investigators:
 The principal investigator, who initiated and designed the project and oversaw its overall
execution. She was responsible for administering the project funding and ensuring that the
service agreement between the project team and the British Council was fulfilled ethically
and responsibly. She was actively involved in supervision of all the ongoing work on the
project, contributed to the project reports and directly led and conducted much of the research
work. As will be shown below, some of it was outside the scope of this case study.
 The co-investigator with a background in computer science, responsible for oversight of the
computational aspects of the involved work.
 The co-investigator with a background in political science who oversaw the issues surrounding
soft power (Nye, 2004)  an approach to international relations focusing on establishing a
positive image of a country among the populations abroad.
Aiming at comprehensiveness, the evaluation project included several research strands each
pursuing its own objective. As the work on the three strands was, to a high degree, independent,
the strands provide a useful framework to give a brief introduction to the project. I will outline
the aims of each strand and briefly introduce their core methods and research teams.
However, before looking at each of the strands in detail, it is worth noting that I was deeply
involved in the ongoing research- and reporting work conducted for Strand 1 during the

3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 39
Shakespeare Lives cultural programme itself and shortly after it finished. This work fits the
definition of social data science (see 1) most closely due to the use of novel forms of social data
(primarily social media data) and the associated challenges. It is the subject of discussion within
this case study.
There was much work done for the overall evaluation project as part of the other strands.
Moreover, the project investigators carried a lot of work after the social media analysis team
was adjourned and the cycles of ongoing reporting were finished. All of those are outside the
scope of this case study and are only introduced inasmuch as is required to better understand
the work on Strand 1. Therefore, this case study should not be considered a full account of the
Shakespeare Lives evaluation project, but rather a rich and comprehensive account of one of its
particular aspects3.
3.2.1.1 Strand 1. Qualitative analysis of social media interactions across different
languages
Strand 1 of the evaluation project looked for evidence of the programmes influence on public
perceptions of the British Council, Shakespeare and, ultimately, the UK on social media. For
each of the five studied languages of social media interaction  English, Spanish, Arabic, Russian,
Mandarin  and for interactions with the visual content on Instagram, the strand team investigated
whether the social media users recognised the values that the British Council promotes (mutuality,
diversity, creativity, innovation and welcoming nature). The team also provided an in-depth
assessment of the publics emotional response to the Shakespeare Lives programme and examined
whether the social media users found the programmes content enjoyable, useful and of high
quality.
The key research method that the strands team employed was content analysis actualised
primarily through human coding of social media data and qualitative interpretation of the
findings derived from the coding exercise. On each of the three rounds of reporting, a researcher
coded a sample of social media entries from Twitter, Sina Weibo4 or Instagram via a coding
framework. The framework had been developed before the start of the project by the project
investigators and was subsequently shaped by the strand team at the start of the project. In
addition, the researchers took ethnographic approach to studying two social media platforms
 Facebook and VK.com5. They were observing the public- and group pages relevant to the

40 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
Shakespeare Lives programme and the discussions that were emerging there over time straight
through the platforms web interfaces.
Given the high number of its research outputs, Strand 1 required a significant investment of
labour. Indeed, for each round of reporting, five reports for data in each studied language and one
report for the visual content analysis were produced, and a number of overarching final reports
were prepared later. Data in each language was analysed by a single researcher (hereinafter
referred to as language researchers) with a separate researcher being responsible for the visual
content analysis.
The work of the six researchers was coordinated by a project manager. The project manager
was not one of the project investigators, but rather another team member who provided their
services to the project on a consultancy basis. Within the course of the evaluation project, the role
was occupied by two different researchers of seniority similar to that of the regular researchers.
The project managers oversaw the data collection from the third-party social media monitoring
platforms (see Section 3.2.6.1) and played the key role in development of data acquisition criteria.
In this capacity, they were a point of liaison with the British Council concerning some of the
operational research decisions. At the end of the project, the project manager was responsible
for meta-analysis of the findings derived across different languages.
The eighth and final member of the strand team was the technical coordinator. I took this role
on the team. Within this capacity, I liaised with the analysts (i.e. the language researchers and
the visual content analyst) on quantitative analysis and interpretation of data. I was responsible
for supplying the analysts with data visualisations and for facilitating large-scale data collection
when this needed to go beyond the social media monitoring platforms. The work of the strand
team was supervised the projects investigators, who played the lead role in developing the
methodology.
As mentioned above, due to the nature of Strand 1 and my personal involvement in it, the vast
majority of the discussion on the Shakespeare Lives case study will be dedicated to the work on
this particular strand.
3.2.1.2 Strand 2. Cultural Value of Shakespeare Lives: learning, monitoring and
evaluation
The second strand of the research project aimed to provide an overarching evaluation of the
Shakespeare Lives programme using the Cultural Value Framework previously co-developed by
the Open University, the BBC World Services and the British Council (Gillespie et al., 2014).

3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 41
While the framework was adapted to the project needs, it retained its essence of assessing a soft
power endeavour from the perspective of four groups of stakeholders: funders of the endeavour,
collaborators, delivery teams within the organisation and the audience.
This research strand collated data collected with a wide variety of research methods and from
different sources. The strand heavily relied on secondary data. For example, the audience
component was predominantly informed by the work on Strand 1. Some of the data came from
the British Councils internal reports and evaluations. However, this strand also generated new
primary data  for example, through surveying British Council employees. The bulk of the
research for this strand was done by the principal investigator and a senior consultant who had
both previously led the development of the Cultural Value Framework.
3.2.1.3 Strand 3. Visualising Shakespeare Lives: interactive overview of the programme
The last strand of the project was concerned with creating visualisations to provide a high-level
overview of the social media data that the Shakespeare Lives programme had generated. These
visualisations were mostly aimed to enhance the presentation of the project deliverables and
to support the qualitative findings of Strand 1 with relevant figures derived from larger-scale
quantitative analysis. While playing an important role of illustrative support for the findings of
the other project strands, these visualisations did not generate major new findings by themselves.
The work on the visualisations was done by a contracted third-party commercial organisation
whose co-founder closely liaised with the projects research team. Additionally, sentiment
analysis  i.e. automatic detection of the strength of tone underlying a piece of text (low to
high) and of its direction (i.e. positive or negative) as expressed in a piece of text  of a large
corpus of tweets containing the programmes #ShakespeareLives hashtag was carried out by
one of the project investigators who used a readily available sentiment measurement algorithm,
SentiStrength (Thelwall, 2017). Alongside the projects technical coordinator (myself), the
investigator also lent support to preparation of the visualisations at the later stage of project.
Example visualisations included maps and timeline diagrams depicting the spatial and temporal
distributions of the relevant tweets and of their sentiment, an info-graphic demonstrating the most
actively tweeting users and the most commonly mentioned Twitter accounts and an interactive
calendar of the programme.
3.2.2 Fieldwork Methods
In line with the overarching methodology of the undertaken fieldwork (see Section 3.1), I had
an opportunity to study the work on the project, and specifically on Strand 1, as a participant
42 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
observer. The study took the form of a range of activities in which I witnessed the work on the
project in its naturally occurring settings. Table 3.1 summarises those activities across several
dimensions:
 whether they were carried in physical co-presence with the project team members or distantly
as an online ethnography;
 whether they included an active participatory element from my side or were purely
observational;
 whether they coincided with my direct responsibilities as a member of the project team or
were undertaken specifically for the PhD study.

Table 3.1: Fieldwork activities undertaken to study the Shakespeare Lives evaluation project.
The first type of activity was participation in the project team meetings. In total, I was invited
to, and participated in four meetings. Two meetings with the Strand 1 team members were held
at the start of the project. The first one was mostly dedicated to discussing the key features of
the qualitative data coding frameworks. Those frameworks were subsequently used as the main
analysis tools for Strand 1. I used this meeting as an opportunity to disclose my intention to
use this project as a case study for my thesis and to ask the team for their consent. During the
second meeting the team had an in-depth strategic discussion of the work ahead and pilot-tested
the coding framework. The third and the fourth meetings were held after the first and the second
rounds of reporting respectively. They were used to reflect on the work conducted for the rounds
and, if necessary, to make methodological adjustments and revise project management practices.
The fourth meeting also included the team members who worked on the Strands 2 and 3 to make
a start on merging the strands output into a coherent set of final deliverables. The meetings were
neither audio- nor video-recorded in order to maintain their natural flow and, crucially, to not
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 43
disrupt their productivity. Written notes of the meetings were taken both by me and by the other
project team members, all of which were re-examined for this write-up.
I organised three one-on-one observational sessions with the Strand 1 team members to get a
detailed account of their work and of the issues arising. Two sessions were held with the project
managers (as already mentioned, this role was held by two different people at different stages of
the project). Those sessions were dedicated to selection and acquisition of Twitter and Instagram
data. One session was held with the English language researcher. It was focused on coding the
data using the coding framework. During the sessions, I encouraged the team members to think
aloud and asked them questions to clarify aspects of their work. These sessions also involved
active participation on my side, as the observed team members and I discussed the arising issues
and resolved them together. I took written notes throughout the sessions. The data collection
sessions were also audio-recorded with the consent of the observed project managers.
While the project meetings and the observational sessions required physical co-presence of
the team members and myself, much of work on the Strands 1 and 3 took the form of online
remote collaboration such as email exchanges and Skype calls, which I could observe only
if I was participating in them or at least was copied-in. However, for a significant chunk of
communication the team used an online project management platform Teamwork 6. This platform
supports sharing files and discussing topics among members of a project team. For this study,
Teamwork was an invaluable resource. It did not only allow me to revisit the conversations that I
had taken part in, but also to retrospectively examine the digital traces of collaboration among
the other team members working on the Strands 1 and 3.
Finally, in addition to the highly collaborative forms of ethnographic work discussed above, it is
worth mentioning two other methods used to study this project. First, as I had responsibilities
as a member of the project team, some of the issues that arose in the project could be studied
through self-reflection (Marchal, 2010).
Additionally, to better contextualise the findings, project documentation was examined. This
included the project proposal and the meeting notes taken by the other team members. The latter
were especially valuable because they allowed getting an alternative perspective on the project
meetings compared to my own. They also documented the moments of the meeting when my
participation as a team member was more active and hence my ability to take notes was limited.
The fieldwork undertaken for this study yielded insights into numerous issues that were faced
during the Shakespeare Lives evaluation project and into how the project team managed them
(and with them). The discussion is split into subsections, many of which correspond with the

to social data science  and even to such a relatively software-engineering-free project within it.
Yet, the other issues relate to the project aspects not covered by SEMAT. Those, respectively, can
suggest new alphas for the designed extension of the SEMAT project management model.
3.2.3 Findings 1. Research Goals and Stakeholder
The Shakespeare Lives programme evaluation project can serve as an excellent example of the
importance to understand who the stakeholders are and to ensure that their goals are aligned
with those of the team. I will show how different parameters such as a project setup and the
differences in backgrounds of the project teams members and of the stakeholders may potentially
make this non-trivial. I will also show how our team mitigated these obstacles.
3.2.3.1 Aligning stakeholder interests and team background
The first aspect to look at is the relationship between the British Council and the studied
evaluation project. As is quite often the case in projects such as this one, the key stakeholder
 the British Council  was simultaneously the subject of the independent evaluation carried
by our project team and the body that had commissioned the evaluation. While our team was
deriving the findings that (among other purposes) were meant to be used in reporting on the
British Councils achievements to the organisations funding partners, those further reports were
the British Councils responsibility to prepare, and our team had no relationship (contractual or
otherwise) with those funding bodies.
By the baseline guiding principles of independent evaluation, the British Council had no power
over the findings that our team produced and could not reject our outputs if they satisfied the
agreed level of rigour and quality. Being a publicly funded organisation with a reputation to
maintain, the British Council was interested in outputs that complied with these principles. This
was supported by our team for whom it was crucial to be compliant with good academic practice.
The vast majority of the team members were either academics or doctoral students affiliated with
various universities in the UK and abroad. Therefore, academic rigour was not only a matter of
principle  it was also a matter of reputation and of the ability to subsequently use the findings to
publish academically.
On the other hand, the British Council had had a long history of prior collaboration with the
project investigators (e.g. during the development of the aforementioned Cultural Value Model);
therefore, if the research outputs presented by our team had caused a conflict between the team
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 45
and the British Council, it could have jeopardised a long-established partnership. Additionally,
the British Council could have in principle used some instruments of resistance such as coming
up with formal reasons to not accept the work  even if, based on past experience, the team
did not expect the British Council to do so. Indeed, the issue of pressure from funding bodies
(including the well-minded ones) is not unknown in research. For example, Smith (2010) shows
that UK researchers in health inequality who are funded to contribute to health policies feel
bound to produce ideas compatible with existing policies. The following paragraphs will show
how our team managed to maintain the integrity of the research within the projects setting 
primarily through the efforts of the principal investigator.
The primary challenge faced by the principal investigator was in making sure that the research
outputs were appropriately recipient-designed. Recipient design is a term coined by Sacks et al.
(1974) for the process of formulating the message in a way that is sensitive to its intended
audience. It is a recommended practice in qualitative social research as it helps to avoid losing
the audience (Silverman, 2017). The purpose of recipient design is not to change the essence of
the message, but to make sure that the way the message is conveyed fits the recipients needs. For
example, our team had to make sure that the findings were appropriately contextualised and that
the overall tone of their discussion and presentation was tailored to the non-academic audience
of the British Council representatives who might have been accustomed to less critical tone than
the one often employed in academia.
As a result, the principal investigator often secured meetings with the British Council to
demonstrate preliminary findings and to get their comments and suggestions as to what kinds
of evidence our team might have overlooked in the research or what kind of questions could be
answered in more detail. The meetings with the British Council were held in a close circle of
people: the investigators and the project manager of Strand 1 from the project team side and
the Shakespeare Lives programme manager from the British Council side. While this was not
necessarily done specifically to reduce risks of confrontation between the British Council and
the team, it achieved this as a side effect. The continuous feedback from the British Council
allowed the project to stay relevant to its interests throughout. It was specifically helpful that the
meetings with the British Council were consistently held in short advance of the project team
meetings. Therefore, the principal investigator could communicate the British Councils relevant
feedback to the team members in person and let the team thoroughly discuss it.
The principal investigator always maintained her strict academic integrity and was respectful to
the aspirations of the project team. She never pushed to mask the reported findings  even the
negative ones. Rather than that, she motivated the project team to ensure that those findings were
appropriately framed, so if there were objective obstructions to more successful performance,
46 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
those would have to be discussed. Likewise, she made our team ensure that no evidence that
viewed Shakespeare Lives in a positive light was missed. During the project meetings, she
metaphorically encouraged the team members to put two hats on, referring to the academic
and the consultancy roles respectively. Given that the analysis mostly answered quite open
questions with a support of predominantly qualitative research techniques, effectively the
principal investigator achieved to motivate the team to dig deeper and come up with inventive yet
appropriate research angles. As will be shown further when discussing the research methodology,
this only strengthened the quality of the research (e.g. see Section 3.2.5.1).
3.2.3.2 Interpreting stakeholder needs
The long-term relationships between the project team investigators and the British Council were
rooted in the investigators interest and deep expertise in studying soft power organisations, i.e.
the organisations that strive to establish a positive public image of a particular country among
the populations abroad (Nye, 2004). Soft power organisations often strive to influence their
audiences in indirect and tacit ways that ask for corresponding approaches to evaluation of their
effectiveness. The British Council is a soft power organisation and the investigators ability to
theorise them as such was of extreme value for the Shakespeare Lives evaluation project. For
example, it lay at the core of development of the evaluation framework for Shakespeare Lives,
especially in the context of Strand 2. Therefore, both our team who assessed Shakespeare Lives
as a soft power initiative and the British Council who acted as one attended to their proper
responsibilities.
That said, in addition to having responsibilities (and thus interests) as a soft power organisation,
the British Council had responsibilities as just an organisation. For example, the British Council
had to report back to its funding bodies. The soft power nature of their activities sometimes
made it difficult to pinpoint what their specific contributions were in such external reports. This
occasionally led to potential difficulties of implementing some of the recommendations provided
by our team. For example, during one of the data collection sessions designed to observe the
team members at work, the project manager said the following about the tweets containing the
British Council-initiated #ShakespeareLives hashtag:
There was stuff that wasnt necessarily directly related to the programme, but still
used the hashtag; [the British Council would] be happy to see that, because for them
thats still evidence of impact. All they want to see is that their programme shapes
anything to do with Britain in any shape or form.
As a result, the final reports specifically praised the British Councils collaborations with local
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 47
cultural organisations, as well as the local events and activities that were done with very active
contributions of the local partners. Further development of such activities was also one of
the persistent recommendations across multiple project reports. While the British Council
did not reject this recommendation, the organisations feedback on our reports suggested that
implementing this recommendation to the suggested degree could potentially create difficulties
for external reporting. This example shows the importance of understanding the complexity and
heterogeneity of interests of a single project stakeholder when reporting to them and providing
them with recommendations.
Another point to make in regard to interpretation of the stakeholder needs is that the stakeholders
themselves are heterogeneous. In the case of the studied project, while our points of contact
were within the British Council headquarters in the UK, the list of the real beneficiaries of the
evaluation project also included the local British Council teams across the world. There was
one example of not accounting for the particular interests of such a local team (namely, the
Russian team) in the initial stages of the project design, which was repaired in the early stages of
conducting the research. This example directly links to the subject of data selection and thus is
discussed elsewhere (see Section 3.2.4.1).
3.2.3.3 Expecting stakeholder engagement
Finally, to stress the importance of continuous engagement with the stakeholders, it is worth
mentioning that lack of it once was a reason for miscommunication within the project team. The
original project proposal promised a visualisation representing a macro view on Shakespeare
Lives in the format of a digital calendar that should have been prepared by a third party
contractor for Strand 3. There were no more stated requirements for this digital calendar, so the
contractor expected collaboration with the British Council to elicit and refine those. However,
the British Council focused its attention on the interim reporting done for Strand 1 and on the
on-going work done for Strand 2, leaving Strand 3 out of the loop. This was most arguably due
to the fact that Strands 1 and 2 actually produced output on a continuous basis, and the British
Councils representatives felt more comfortable to engage in providing continuous feedback on
interim results rather than actually participating in planning activities.
Simultaneously, some of the other work done for Strand 3  specifically, the sentiment analysis
performed by one of the project investigators  could also benefit from longitude visualisations,
but in a form of tweet timeline diagrams rather than a digital calendar. The the focus of effort
of the third party contractor naturally morphed into preparation of those visualisations with an
implicit assumption that the timeline diagrams had replaced the calendar. It was quite a surprise
for the contractor when, already after the internal deadline for delivering a working version of the
48 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
project website, they were contacted by the project principal investigator for the digital calendar.
As it appeared, the plan to prepare the calendar always stood intact. The contractor did manage
to deliver the calendar, but at high personal costs and on a hectic schedule.
3.2.4 Findings 2. Research Questions and Data Selection
Despite slight differences in interests and goals between the project team and the project funders
(see Section 3.2.3), the overarching research questions of the project were clear from the start.
These project questions, subject to minor variations in wording, were consistently re-iterated by
the principal investigator during the project meetings. Specifically for Strand 1, from which I
derive the materials for this section, those were:
 RQ1: What was the response to the Shakespeare Lives programme across the online platforms
and languages? Was it positive, negative or neutral? Is there evidence that the social media
users found the programme useful, enjoyable and of high quality?
 RQ2: Did the social media users acknowledge the values of Britain that the British Council
aims to promote: diversity, mutuality, innovation, creativity and welcoming nature?
 RQ3: Is there evidence that the Shakespeare Lives programme affected the publics
perceptions of Britain as a whole?
 RQ4: Which particular events and other efforts within the Shakespeare Lives programme
were the most successful in terms of provoking positive feedback, promoting values and
enhancing the international image of Britain?
While formulating the high-level research questions was straightforward given the goals of the
evaluation project, it was quite a challenge to operationalise them to the level of a valid research
design (De Vaus, 2001)  i.e., a clear understanding what data should be accessed and selected.
In this evaluation project, it was not sufficient to clarify what data were required  we should
have also considered what data existed in principle and what data were available for us. As a
result, our data demands were refined iteratively throughout the three rounds of the Strand 1
research. This section focuses on the refinement of data selection criteria; the implications for
data analysis are discussed further (see Section 3.2.5).
3.2.4.1 Selecting platforms to analyse
The first logical step in operationalising the research questions was determining what which
platforms to use as the data sources. The original project proposal suggested analysing three
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 49
platforms  Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. This choice was primarily driven by the interests of
the British Council and was shaped by the available resources. The British Council headquarters
were strategically interested in Facebook, Instagram and Twitter analysis, as those platforms
were most actively used to post on Shakespeare Lives in English. Two commercial social media
monitoring tools that the British Council was in possession of and made available for our team
also collectively provided access to specifically Twitter, Facebook and Instagram data.
During the first round of the project reporting, it became evident that the three chosen platforms,
while being an adequate choice for analysis of the social media posts in English, Spanish and
partially Arabic and Russian, were not appropriate for analysing the interactions in Mandarin.
Neither Twitter nor Facebook were legally available to Chinas residents (Chiu et al., 2012).
Although the first round of data acquisition was conducted right after the Shakespeares death
anniversary  i.e. after the highest spikes of the Shakespeare Lives-related online activity 
we only identify less than a thousand relevant tweets to analyse. This number only became
lower over time  e.g. only 271 relevant tweets were identified for the second reporting round.
Likewise, there was not public/group page dedicated to the British Council in China on Facebook.
For these reasons, a Chinese microblogging platform Sina Weibo (hereinafter Weibo) was added
to the list of the analysed platforms.
Another social media platform that was added to analysis of the Russian language interactions
was VK.com  the most popular social networking service in Russia. At the moment of this
writing, it is the second most visited website in Russia according to Amazon Alexa rankings,
while Facebook, with which is bears similarities in user interface and supported modes of user
interaction, is only the 17th7. In contrast to Weibo, VK.com was included not due to necessity,
but due to our commitment to improve research quality and usefulness where possible. Omitting
VK.com from the analysis of Shakespeare Lives in Russian, while could be methodologically
justified by the increased consistency of analyses across the studied languages, would have made
the respective language report less useful for one of its key beneficiaries  the British Council
Russia. The British Council Russia had established a very similar presence on Facebook and
VK.com  on both platforms, they had a public page where they often posted synchronously.
However, the VK.com group of the British Council Russia had twice as much followers as the
Facebook group, thus the recommendations derived from the analysis of VK.com were of high
relevance.

50 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
3.2.4.2 Keyword-based and page-based data selection
While the choice of platforms to analyse required only a limited degree of refinement and was
finalised during the first round of reporting, scoping the data selection criteria for each of those
platforms was a continuous challenge throughout the project. For the language reports, the key
factors that the project team had to consider included:
1. Affordances, user interface and structure of social media interaction on each platform;
2. Availability of data to acquire for each individual platform;
3. Specificities of social media interactions in each of the studied languages;
4. Specificities of the British Councils social media presence in each specific language.
Due to (1) and (2), it was decided early on in the research process that the scope of data
selection would be qualitatively different for Facebook/VK.com as compared to Twitter/Weibo:
the Twitter/Weibo data selection was focused on specific hashtags and keywords, while the
Facebook/VK.com data selection was focused on specific public pages. This principle was
maintained throughout the projects course.
Twitter is a microblogging platform with a restriction on the message length and without a
hierarchical structure of pages, posts and comments. Twitter is known to raise questions on
whether it should be considered a social networking service at all, as it is more similar to a short
message broadcasting service (Kwak et al., 2010). Hence, it is appropriate (albeit with caveats)
to treat tweets as individual postings rather than parts of a larger conversation. For this reason, a
keyword-based data selection was deemed more appropriate by the research team. Indeed, such
data selection can corrupt the structure of individual conversations (which is not as important for
individual postings); however, with high level of confidence, it would return relevant data  or
at least the postings that were deemed relevant by the users who used respective hashtags. A
similar argument was made for Weibo due to its similar affordances.
By contrast, Facebook and VK.com are both social networking services that allow creating spaces
for meaningful chained conversations. The pages-posts-comments hierarchy puts restrictions
on visibility of each individual posting, so conversations cannot be hijacked that easily. More
generous permitted post lengths allow for meaningful message exchange. For this reason, it
seemed reasonable for the research team to focus the VK.com and Facebook data selection on
conversations and other interactions happening on the public/group pages of various British
Council country services as a whole, rather than on selecting individual message even if those
likely be more relevant by themselves.
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 51
That being said, the user interfaces and the affordances of each platform were not the only factors
behind the choice between the keyword-based and the page-based data acquisition strategy for
each platform. The transparency and the privacy policies of the selected platforms also played
their role. For example, Twitter is notably more open than either Facebook or VK.com. Both
Facebook and VK.com support a range of privacy settings that limit who can see content and
users do make use of this to limit the distribution of their postings, while Twitter has a simpler
model and more people post their tweets publicly. While the social media monitoring tools
provided to us by the British Council supported keyword-based data collection from Facebook,
the resulting data samples would have suffered from self-selection, as only the posts within
the unrestricted user profile spaces and the public pages would have been acquired. Also, the
provided monitoring tools did not support VK.com data acquisition  and it was methodologically
preferable to keep the data access approaches to VK.com and Facebook similar.
The considerations discussed above were a major factor behind the teams decision to take an
ethnographic approach to studying Facebook and VK.com. Within this approach, the team did
not systematically collect the data before the analysis  instead, the analysts observed how the
conversations unfolded through the platforms user interface and, if and when necessary, took
screenshots as a form of evidence.
Weibo was a special case in terms of technical and legal availability of acquirable data. As
might be expected from a Chinese social media platform, Weibo did not have an API that would
allow performing programmatic systematic data acquisition. Moreover, commercial social media
monitoring tools available to us also did not support any forms of Weibo analytics  let alone
exports of Weibo data. As such, we had to rely on manual scraping of data returned by keyword
search within the user interface of Weibo. Hence, we could not truly warrant completeness and/or
representativeness of the resulting sets of Weibo posts. From this perspective, an account-based
Weibo data acquisition could have been more robust. However, the British Council China did not
have a Weibo account. This made identifying a reasonable set of Weibo accounts to scrape data
from highly unlikely. Combined with the previously discussed methodological considerations,
the keyword-based data acquisition from Weibo through keyword search and manual scraping
was both a benefit and a necessity.
3.2.4.3 Formulating data selection criteria
The specific data selection criteria for Twitter and Weibo data significantly varied throughout
the course of the project and, out of all the data selection parameters, deviated the most from
the initial plan. Not only did the lists of keywords change, but the tactics and approaches to
compiling the keyword lists differed from round to round of reporting, as much as from language
52 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
to language. The following will detail those differences with the focus on Twitter, as most of the
Weibo data acquisition principles followed the Twitter ones.
The initial strategy was to focus each report on a list of specific most prominent events within the
Shakespeare Lives programme that had happened before the respective reporting round and had
provoked a high spike of social media activities in a studied language. We planned to look for
unique tweets that were posted during those spikes and contained the #ShakespeareLives hashtag,
as the British Council coined it specifically for the needs of the programme. We aimed to identify
the spikes by examining the Twitter timeline diagrams produced by one of the available social
media analytics tools. The ultimate goal was to select a random sample of 1000 tweets for
each report so that the language researchers had sufficient yet manageable material for further
qualitative analysis.
For the first round of reporting, we did manage to identify a sufficiently large spike of activity that
happened across all of the studied languages  the aforementioned Shakespeare week-end in
April, i.e. the week-end of the commemoration. Initially, we had a certain degree of confidence
in the plan to use only tweets containing #ShakespeareLives. As the project manager said at the
beginning of the first data acquisition session:
For [the British Council] internally, the key hashtag for anything surrounding this
weekend was [...] #ShakespeareLives. And we knew, like, as soon as we started to
look at it from the kind of observation perspective: [...] there is going to be a lot of
traffic.
There was a lot of traffic indeed. However, it was only the English-tweeting audience who picked
up the #ShakespeareLives hashtag widely enough that we could sample a thousand tweets. The
Spanish language audience also used it to some degree, but they appeared to favour a different
hashtag  #Shakespeare400. That hashtag was not directly linked to the Shakespeare Lives
programme, but was also actively used and promoted by the British Council, so it was included
into the Spanish data acquisition criteria with no hesitation.
For the languages whose writing is not based on the Latin alphabet, it quickly became clear
that our team would either need to broaden the collection criteria in order to acquire the desired
number of tweets or to moderate our appetites. It was primarily the project managers decision
to go for the first option. Prior to data collection, he contacted the Arabic language researcher
with a broad set of English keywords for her to translate to Arabic. In his words:
It all depends on what we want in the end of this  do we want a very accurate
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 53
dataset that might not reflect the full variety of discussion or do we want a very
broad dataset that we can then sample from and get sense of broader conversation. I
prefer the latter, which is why I probably gave [the Arabic language analyst] [...] as
broad [set] of keywords as possible.
This decision of the project manager  and the fact that we as a team did not only agree with
it, but also expanded upon it in the subsequent rounds of reporting  tells something about the
implicit views of our team. Indeed, we could have argued for going with the easier route of
adhering to the initial collection criteria and thus needing to analyse less data in the end. As we
would collect and analyse all the tweets that satisfied the initial strict criteria, the small volume
of tweets would not threat reliability of the analysis, since the acquired tweets would constitute
the whole population-to-study (albeit a small one) rather than a sample.
Why then did we decide to create more work for ourselves? Reflecting of the past work, it seems
that our team implicitly traced back to the initial broad research questions and thus treated the
tweets we studied not as samples of a population of tweets satisfying the collection criteria, but as
a sample of the much wider population of thoughts, opinions and and acts of self-expression of all
the social media users who were affected by Shakespeare Lives. For such a wide population, its
total size is principally indeterminable. Thus, we had a strong motivation to obtain a sufficiently
sized sample. Interestingly, we never specifically discussed this within the team. I can express
and rationalise it only as part of this post-factum analysis. However, the team conversations 
including the project managers quote above  clearly indicated that we all had this tacit shared
understanding.
At the end of the day, the Twitter data collection criteria for Arabic, Mandarin and Russian were
broadened with the word Shakespeare written both in English and in a respective translation.
Also, specifically for Russian, one additional keyword (Shakespereana) was added. This
was the first time when an event-specific keyword was used as a data collection criterion:
Shakesperiana was a series of school competitions in arts and languages. The competition
prompted studying Shakespeares legacy and were sponsored by the British Council.
During the subsequent rounds of reporting, we had to further increase the flexibility of the
data selection criteria in order to retrieve a sufficient number of relevant tweets. While there
were widely resonating events during the subsequent part of the Shakespeare Lives programme
(e.g. Sir Ian McKellens world tour as a Shakespearean actor), the resulting datasets were not
sufficiently big for our goals. The new project manager, who stepped in for the second round of
reporting, told me during a data collection session:
54 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
This time [...] for nearly all of the languages there is gonna have to be a lot more
playing around because its just theres far less obvious data available. [...] English
is pretty much exactly the same as last time. [...] For every other language, there has
to be some kind of cobbling together.
The cobbling together primarily took the form of acquiring multiple tweet datasets for each
language. Each dataset was collected using keywords related to one specific event or a group of
linked events. The smaller datasets were subsequently aggregated into bigger language datasets.
However, each of the smaller datasets could also be used on its own for a more fine-grained
analysis.
For Arabic and Mandarin, the project manager had to also include some deliberately broad data
selection criteria in order to get a reasonable number of tweets. This resulted in a two-stage
data selection practice in Mandarin. The Mandarin language researcher, before performing
in-depth analysis of each tweet, had to go through all of them and select the ones that were, in
her judgement, of relevance to the Shakespeare Lives programme. A similar procedure had to be
applied to the Arabic dataset collected for the third round of reporting. Collection of that dataset
coincided with the last and, arguably, the most drastic change to the data selection strategy.
Due to the principle lack of Arabic tweets, the dataset contained tweets in English that were
identified as coming from the Arabic-speaking countries by the black-boxed algorithms of the
data collection tool. The Arabic researcher had to thoroughly scrutinise these tweets in order
to make a conclusive judgement whether they were relevant to Shakespeare Lives and actually
came from the respective region of the world.
For Facebook and VK.com, data selection was more consistent over time and was not prone so
much to changing circumstances and to trial-and-error. Since a page-based approach to data
selection was chosen for those platforms, the researchers examined the posts on the public/group
pages of the local British Council teams. The only change happened on the last round of reporting.
It was, once again, caused by the shrinkage in the amount of relevant social media interactions to
study: Facebook/VK.com pages of the British Councils local cultural partners were included
into the scope of the analysis.
3.2.5 Findings 3. Research Methods and Data Analysis
The Shakespeare Lives evaluation project provides a valuable example of adapting traditional
social science methods to social media data analysis and thus bringing them into the realm of
social data science. The bulk of work on Strand 1 was content analysis of the Twitter, Weibo and
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 55
Instagram data using pre-defined coding frameworks, while the study of Facebook and VK.com
presented an example of online ethnography (Hine, 2015).
The project employed three different coding frameworks, each designed for a specific dataset
type:
1. A coding framework for text-based social media data.
2. A coding framework for Instagram posts by the British Council.
3. A coding framework for Instagram posts by the wider audience.
Design of the coding frameworks was led by one of the project investigators with assistance
from the principal investigator and the Instagram analyst. For the most part, unfortunately it was
not observable for me. Each coding framework included a list of post attributes that a researcher
should assess (e.g. tone of a social media post), their accepted levels (negative/positive/neutral
tone) and a recommendation on whether this is a single-choice or a multiple-choice attribute
(single-choice in the case of tone).
After the section on data selection, a reader may be surprised that the structure of the coding
frameworks stayed consistent throughout the reporting rounds bar minor changes. This can be
partially explained by the adaptation of previous analytic approaches from previous projects on
soft power. However, another important factor was that the findings obtained through data coding
could be enhanced through other, less structured modes of qualitative analysis such as deep
reading. These findings could also be supported and clarified with example social media postings.
Hence, anytime the coding framework by itself was not a sufficient tool to get a sufficiently
comprehensive insight into the data, it was complemented by other methods. For this reason,
maintaining consistency of this key analytical tool was given a higher priority.
Consequentially, all the fine-tuning of the originally designed structure of the coding frameworks
happened during one of the two early project meetings and throughout the first round of data
acquisition (i.e. before the first round of analysis began). The key issue was balancing the
number of possible levels for each attribute, which is very similar to the bias-variance trade-off:
few levels would mean low analytical precision, while too many would mean a difficulty to draw
a line between different levels. Other issues were more of a technical nature, such as ensuring
that appropriate escape levels (NA, Unclear, etc.) were provided and complex attributes
were split into components.
That being said, the application and interpretation of the coding frameworks was not as set in
stone as their structure. The next section takes an example of arguably the most ambiguous  and
56 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
definitely the most discussed within the project team  multiple-choice attribute in the coding
frameworks: values.
3.2.5.1 Understanding values
As mentioned above, one of the key goals of the evaluation project was to trace evidence (or lack
thereof) of the British Council managing to promote the image of Britain in accordance with
their five core internal values: innovation, creativity, mutuality, diversity and welcoming nature.
Hence, it was almost mandatory to code for those values. As will be shown below, it is much
easier said than done.
First of all, the British Council, while describing these values in their internal documentation,
did not really operationalise them  or, at the very least, the organisation did not provide our
team with operationalised definitions of those. Hence, from the very start, there was some
confusion and ambiguity around the meaning of each value. For example, it was not exactly clear
if the value of innovation was implied in a strictly business sense (i.e. sponsoring Research
and Development, encouraging start-up activities, etc.). The team decided during the project
meetings to interpret innovation broader, i.e. as proneness to using modern technologies. The
welcoming, diversity and mutuality values were not trivial to distinguish. While some
conventions were developed  e.g. that mutuality required evidence of two-sided cultural
exchange  the exact decisions still could vary from researcher to researcher and from context to
context.
Another question was what to consider an appropriate acknowledgement of a value. Considering
the British Councils mission, it might seem that only acknowledgement of a value in regard to
the UK would be appropriate. Yet, no tweets with the #ShakespeareLives hashtag were explicitly
praising the UK. This did not necessarily mean lack of implicit support. In fact, an explicit
praise of the whole country in the context of discussing specifically Shakespeare would only
seem wrong  and such a posting would more likely be sarcastic than genuine. The soft power
influence is meant to be subtle and our team never aimed to limit coding for values only to direct
acknowledgements of the values in regard to Britain.
If no explicit praise of the UK was to be expected, an alternative approach to detecting
acknowledgement of the values had to be devised. One option was to require an explicit
acknowledgement of the values in regard to the Shakespeare Lives campaign itself. We held
a project meeting to discuss this after the first round Twitter data analysis  i.e. after each of
the language researchers had a chance to code their first full sample of tweets. We decided that
strong evidence of implicit mentioning also qualified. This notion allowed establishing shared
understanding for some cases  e.g. that mentioning videos, theatrical performances and other
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 57
cultural outputs of Shakespeare Lives qualified as acknowledgement of the creativity value.
However, for other cases it was still ambiguous what a strong evidence of implicit mentioning
was. For example, it was not clear whether to consider a use of the Twitter emoji that portrayed
Shakespeare an acknowledgement of British innovativeness. Since writing such a tweet involved
using an innovative product designed by the British Council, the team decided to consider it
valid evidence, but the questions was a subject to quite some debate.
The complexity further arose from the fact that the original list of the British Councils
values was further expanded by a short list of values suggested by the principal investigator.
While the British Council values were potentially attributable to Britain, the new values were
potentially attributable to the Shakespeare Lives programme: the extra values asserted whether
the analysed posts recognised the content of the Shakespeare Lives programme as enjoyable,
useful/relevant, and of quality.
As a result, our team had to develop its own practices to manage the risks associated with
inconsistent understanding of coding for values across various researchers  and the risks of
inconsistent understanding between us and the potential report readers. When writing up the
reports, each researcher included a section that explained in detail how the values were interpreted
and what was considered valid evidence of their acknowledgement. To minimise the chance
of confusion, the reporters supported those discussions with representative example posts. By
doing so, the team explicitly warned the potential report readers against comparing value-related
statistics across the reports. However, since it was impossible to completely avoid the risk of
such comparison, the researchers worked on establishing a shared understanding of how to code
for values. The team dedicated much of the discussion time during the project meetings to the
issue of value coding. Additionally, we held collective online discussions using the Teamwork
platform where each researcher shared some examples of their value coding and the rest of the
team gave them feedback. As will be shown further (see Section 3.2.7.2), the team had to limit
their efforts in formal testing of inter-coder reliability  however, the evidence from the project
discussions suggests that the level of shared understanding did increase over time.
3.2.5.2 Identifying bots
If ambiguity in coding for values posed a challenge for a particular aspect of analysing tweets and
Weibo posts, the next discussed issue posed a question of whether some particular tweets should
be considered for coding in the first place. In the very early stages of preparing for the second
round of reporting, the project manager, while trying to collect the data on Shakespeare Lives in
Arabic, noticed an interesting tendency  while some of the peaks in the timeline graphs of the
Twitter activity corresponded with the events of the programme, others seemed to come out of
58 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
nowhere. Upon closer investigation into those random peaks, the project manager discovered a
lot of tweets that did not seem to be created by people authentically interested in Shakespeare
Lives. She had the following to say after all:
I ended up having to exclude some mildly pornographic keywords from the Arabic
search. They were messing up everything. [...] Obviously because I dont speak
Arabic at all it took me a long time to realise that so many of the tweets were
spam-bot links.
This short example leads to a number of interesting observations. First, the methodological
difficulties sometimes come from unexpected angles. I do not think anyone in our team could
initially have predicted that spammers would be interested in hi-jacking such a relatively
specialised topic as Shakespeare and commemoration of his death  yet they did. Second,
critical engagement with data is valuable from the very start of the acquisition process. The
project manager could not read the Arabic alphabet, so the timeline graphs were indeed the only
way to look into the data she was equipped with. Still, this simplistic representation of data
appeared revealing for her thanks to her critical thinking. Third, the team language sometimes
develops tacitly. The use of the word bot in the quote above is not necessarily a correct one.
Our team had no idea whether these hi-jacking posts were indeed a work of computerised bots
or of human spammers. Somehow, the word bots just happened to be used to refer to the
phenomenon  and it stuck for the rest of the project. It is an interesting question whether
using the word bot instead of spammer when discussing specifically social media is a wider
phenomenon. There seems to be a high interest to bots on social media in literature in the year of
the Shakespeare Lives programmes (cf. Ferrara et al., 2016; Davis et al., 2016; Bessi and Ferrara,
2016), although this is hardly sufficient evidence to make strong claims.
While deliberate exclusion of tweets containing certain stop-words from the acquired data did
help to reduce the numbers of the suspicious data points, it could not eliminate the problem
completely. In some cases, the language researchers had to use their judgement informed
primarily by indirect evidence. For example, during a data analysis session with a researcher of
English-language discussions, she had to deal with the following tweet:
Tweet text: William Shakespeare died 400 years ago today #StGeorgesDay
#Shakespeare400 #ShakespeareLives | More: <a hyperlink>
The text of the tweet seems to be on topic. Yet, two factors raised suspicion. The first one was
the suspended status of the users account discovered through our attempts to access the users
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 59
biographic information. The second factor was the hyperlink which proved to lead to some
online chat service instead of anything relevant to Shakespeare. The language researcher and
I deemed the account suspension and the promotional link to be sufficient evidence of the bot
nature of this posting.
3.2.5.3 Interpreting findings
Even after solving (or at least tackling) the major methodological issues met by the data analysis,
in order to produce the artefacts that would be useful for the British Council our team had to
provide a meaningful interpretation to the findings. This proved to be a challenge of its own, since
the terms in which the British Council, as a non-academic subject of evaluation, thought about
the studied questions were quite different from the metrics that the bare analysis produced.
Indeed, our analysis provided quite direct answers to the questions as formulated in the beginning
of 3.2.4. We had quantitative figures and qualitative characteristics for the online engagement
with the programme, breakdowns of the success of individual events and so forth. Yet, what
the British Council ultimately wanted to know was Is it good enough?. Answering such a
question with academic rigour is rather more challenging, since at least some knowledge of
what good enough constitutes is required. Unfortunately, for a one-off year-long international
cultural programme organised by a partially state-funded soft power organisation there simply
were no benchmarks. Even if there were some events that bore a degree of comparability, no
open data were available for those  and again, there were not enough of those to formulate any
kind of reliable statistics.
The way we tried to work through this challenge was by establishing the internal expectations of
the British Council at the early stages of the programme. This was especially relevant for the
Strand 2 of the research  establishing the Cultural Value of the programme  since the Cultural
Value Model (CVM) is comparing different aspects of an evaluated programme with the baseline
expectations. Yet, it quickly became evident that while the British Council had set targets for a
limited number of parameters (arguably the ones their funders from the GREAT campaign had
been most interested in, e.g. return on investment), most of the aspects assessed by the CVM
had no targets. The attempts to motivate the British Council to produce those targets were also
futile. Partially this of course could be explained by the British Councils unwillingness to put
extra commitments on themselves. However, arguably even more so it was that they, as much
as our team, had no idea how high to raise expectations, since Shakespeare Lives truly was a
unique project. At the end of the day, this behaviour appeared to be the right choice for them,
since some of the targets that were formulated were not met, clearly not from lack of effort but
from lack of experience while setting them in the first place.
60 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
The question of What is good enough? was even more difficult due to the soft power nature of
the British Council activity. Even if we could have formulated some targets for the impact of the
Shakespeare Lives programme, we should have also moderated our expectations towards tangible
evidence of achieving those targets. Most of the soft powers impact is by its nature non-tangible
and cumulative. It does not necessarily consist of immediate reactions by the target audiences
(such as approving social media posts) but rather of a gradual improvement or re-affirmation of
attitudes towards Britain.
In the end, this challenge was tackled in two ways. First, as part of Strand 2 work, the notion of
goodness of social media performance measured in Strand 1 was, if not fully operationalised,
then at least broken down to its aspects, such as whether the social media users praised the
programme as enjoyable, uniting, providing learning opportunities, etc. While these better-
defined dimensions of goodness did not eliminate the fundamental underlying issue, they made
making inter-language and inter-event comparisons easier. Those comparisons became the
second part of the answer to the challenge. On the one hand, the analysts could have proposed
a reasonably justifiable suggestions for what the British Council could have done better by (a)
using the most successful parts of the programme as the baseline and (b) making necessary
adjustments for varying scopes in the programmes particular events and in their audiences. On
the other hand, the analysts could estimate how much tangible evidence of positive reactions to
the different aspects of the programme events could have been expected in the best-case scenario
within the programme.
It is worth noting that (b) was quite a challenge in itself. Not all the events were as discussion-
provoking and could generate sufficient amount of evidence by themselves, hence the breadth of
data collection criteria varied significantly from language to language and from event to event.
At the end of the day, we had to assume that the analysts degree of critical engagement with the
data would allow them to mentally separate the effects of data collection from the underlying
audience reactions in each case. Still, as a result, our team derived a competent estimation of
the British Councils overall success with its social media audiences that incorporated multiple
parameters with well-varied individual scores.
Interestingly, some of the analytical metrics derived from our analysis could be challenging
to interpret by themselves. Moreover, if not carefully used or contextualised, they could even
appear misleading. An example of that would be the sentiment/tone metrics. The distribution of
sentiment across the social media posts was of high interest for the British Council, since this
distribution should have, by intention, directly reflected publics attitudes towards the problem.
For that reason, our team employed two methods of sentiment measurement. One was the
above-mentioned automated sentiment analysis performed as part of the Strand 3. It was applied
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 61
to a wide sample of all collected tweets containing the #ShakespeareLives hashtag. While it was
interesting as a first indicator, both our team and the British Council understood the limitations of
the automated sentiment detection. Hence, the project investigators also put a sentiment-related
question into the coding framework for human data annotation. The analysts had to code each
studied tweet in terms of tone with only 3 broad value: positive/neutral/negative. Our implicit
assumption was that combatting inaccuracies of automated sentiment detection with human
annotation was the only required tweak to consider the sentiment analysis results at face value.
As will be shown below, this assumption was not entirely correct.
The results of the tone analysis were, at the first glance, staggering: for many studied events,
the vast majority of the postings were coded to have a neutral tone. This was very frustrating
for the British Council. Such a finding could not tell much about the audiences reactions, and
it also seemed a bit paradoxical, as the common sense suggests that people do tend to react
either positively or negatively. However, a deeper dive into the data allowed to resolve this
paradox. Most of studied postings simply shared information about the prospective events.
Moreover, quite a lot of the studied tweets were generated automatically: some of the website
that announced the programmes events had a share this on Twitter button, which generated an
informative tweet with a link to the page and a short description of the event. For such tweets, the
tone could not be anything else but neutral. Yet, while we understood that reposting information
did not necessarily mean endorsement, mass sharing did indicate positive appreciation of the
programmes events. From this perspective, marking those tweets as neutral did underestimate
the publics sentiment towards the programme. In the later rounds of reporting, the overall tone
figures were always accompanied by tone figures based only on the post that were not purely
informative. This small example shows the importance of understanding that the metrics derived
from social media data (and new forms of naturally occurring data in general) are usually merely
proxies for the desired more tacit variables  and, as with every proxy, one should incorporate
their limitations into the way they are interpreted.
3.2.6 Findings 4. Research Infrastructure
The work on the Shakespeare Lives evaluation project was facilitated by  and thus shaped by 
a range of computer-based tools that formed quite a sophisticated technical infrastructure. While
the infrastructure was continuously evolving to better suit for the changing demands of our work,
the decisions on its key components were made before the start of the project. These decisions
were as much based on the desire to fit the projects goals and questions, as on the resource
constraints and available opportunities to gain elevated access to some of the tools. This section
will mostly assess the role of those key infrastructure components for our work, but will also
62 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
tackle how we used other tools to tackle limitations we encountered.
3.2.6.1 Acquiring data with social media monitoring tools
Our team engaged in the evaluation project under an agreement with the British Council that
the latter would provide us with access to the social media monitoring tools used by the British
Council themselves  Sysomos and Brand24. Such tools are mostly used for the purposes
of online marketing and brand monitoring, and they provide elevated access to social media
data8 and built-in analytic capabilities. The latter were of little interest to our team for two
reasons. First, the analyses offered by those tools tend to be methodologically opaque with the
documentation providing only limited suggestion for how to interpret the findings (Procter et al.,
2015). Second, the British Council were most interested in forms of analysis that they could not
run themselves. That being said, our team did need access to Sysomos and Brand24 to acquire
the social media data. For example, with Twitter, the only real alternative would have been to
collect the data via a publicly available Streaming API. That would have meant having at least a
hardware setup that could be run with minimal interruptions 24/7 throughout the course of the
project with continuous access to the Internet for real-time data collection and, perhaps more
importantly, good ex ante understanding of the required data collection criteria. The former could
be quite a resource stretch for us, while the latter was simply not possible since data acquisition
was iterative and event-driven.
While these tools did allow us to access historic data on tweets and Instagram posts9, we faced
how little control we actually had over those tools. During the first data collection session, the
project manager was dealing with a deluge of #ShakespeareLives tweets in English. To export
these data from Sysomos, he had to break down the retrieval criteria into chunks, since Sysomos
had a cap on the volume of tweets per one export. The fact of this caps existence was not a
surprise by itself  indeed, the manager had recently used Sysomos in a different project. What
he did genuinely not expect though was how low that cap was  only 5000 tweets per single
export versus 30000 at the time of the previous project. Interestingly, I also had had a prior
experience of working with Sysomos at an even earlier moment. At that time, the limit stood at
15000 tweet per export  yet another value for the same variable. Sysomos was simply changing
the level of service that they were providing without much choice for their customers. While
such fluctuations in service did not cause hurdles specifically in the Shakespeare Lives project,
the observation did raise a question of how much the commercial social media monitoring tools
could be relied upon in a long-term research project.
8compared to publicly available APIs.
9For example, Sysomos has full Twitter data for one year.
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 63
The data selection functionality of both Sysomos and Brand24 was also severely limited. For
instance, Sysomos did not allow to explicitly filter out retweets. That was highly desired, since
our team aimed to analyse as broad a set of audience reactions as possible; retweets thus were a
danger for the qualitative scope of the analysis. We did develop a workaround for this limitation
by exploiting Twitters internal representation of retweet texts (starting the retweet text with
RT @<user name>), but this solution was also not optimal since we potentially could exclude
original tweets that happened to start with RT10. Brand24s data selection capabilities were
even weaker, as the tool did not support boolean search (although it did allow access to posts of
a selected account). As the lack of boolean search functionality did not allow for formulation of
sophisticated queries, it kept the team from iterative development of the data acquisition criteria
on Instagram  we simply employed the #ShakespeareLives hashtag throughout the programme.
It is worth to make several remarks regarding the discussion above. First of all, a limited
data selection functionality diminishes the value of social media monitoring tools even more
significantly in their default use case: data analysis (not retrieval). Since our team exported
data for external analysis, we could apply some more sophisticated filtering after exporting.
By contrast, those who use the monitoring systems for data analysis have to accept that their
analyses will be applied to sub-optimal selection of data points. Second, Sysomos currently
claim to have a more powerful selection functionality: the system allegedly allows to query for
specific topics rather than mere keywords (Sysomos, nd). While this may work to some extent,
this even further reduces the users control over what data are fed into the analysis. While one
can argue that the users can eyeball the retrieved data and judge whether they are actually on
topic theyve queried, this does not really work at scale and this does not prevent false negatives.
Besides, if the user did find the retrieved data irrelevant, what could they do besides trying a
different topic name?
Some of the limitations of the data retrieved with the employed commercial tools actually
motivated us to expand the acquisition infrastructure beyond the initial plans. For example,
the Twitter data retrieved from Sysomos lacked users self-stated short profile biographies. A
users bio was of primary importance, for example, to distinguish whether the tweet came from a
member of the programmes audience or from one of the British Councils cultural partners. The
analysts could have manually look up this information on Twitter  Sysomos data did include
all the required links and the profile names  but having to go to Twitter for each new analysed
tweet would have been inefficient. As a result, I acquired user biographies for all the tweets to be
analysed via the Twitter REST API. A similar problem arose with the links shared on Twitter. In
the internal representation of tweet texts, such links are shortened using the t.co domain name.
10We did do a quick analysis that showed that such tweets were practically non-existent.
64 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
Sysomos data contained only such shortened versions of links, so assessing them basing solely
on Sysomos data was impossible. The analyst had to either follow the a link through, access the
original tweet to see the link in full or discard the link.
Finally, at the time of our project, neither Sysomos not Brand24 provided appropriate
functionality to access data from the studied local social media platforms. This was not a
problem for VK.com, since it was studied ethnographically. However, for Weibo, the Mandarin
analyst effectively had to rely on the platforms search engine and to manually scrape the relevant
data. Since the volumes of discussions on Weibo were never overwhelming  and thus the
researcher could exhaust the search and go through all the posts retrieved  we could be confident
in the outcomes. Yet, it was a lot of tedious work.
3.2.6.2 The price of repurposing
As mentioned above, Sysomos is aimed at use in a commercial, marketing context to monitor
a brands success and to gather the aggregate sentiment of its audience. The use of this tool to
export data for other modes of analyses performed at an academic level of rigour was essentially
a case of repurposing  although a very mild one. There was not much for us to do to tailor
the tool to our needs that would go beyond coping with the tools limitations discussed above.
However, there was one particular problem that was very relevant for us as academics  tracking
data provenance, i.e. the decisions and the actions that led to each of the studied datasets.
It was crucial for us to preserve the criteria that fed into each of the analysed samples of social
media posts as the data collection criteria varied drastically from sample to sample among both
languages and rounds of reporting. Moreover, for the sake of research quality and confidence
in our findings, it was equally important to preserve as least some metadata on all the rejected
iterations of data retrieval criteria: at the end of the day, it was the iterative, trial and error process
of appraising different datasets and adjusting the data retrieval criteria that justified what data the
researchers had to analyse. As the first project manager put it:
One thing Im very keen on doing with this project is maintaining [... a] paper trail
of everything I do. [...] It includes date range, keywords searches. It also includes
number of posts in the sample.
As expected, Sysomos did not support any functionality that would aid the project manager in
tracking data provenance. Therefore, he had to develop a format for manually editable metadata
records. He kept the paper trail in a Microsoft Word document, with each single metadata
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 65
record implemented as a small table of a fixed layout. Such tables had to be manually created
and filled in by him each time he queried the data.
The resulting Microsoft Word documents indeed provided quite a comprehensive trace of the
data collection activities. However, as is often the case with manual bookkeeping efforts, the
key problem was having the discipline to record metadata at each and every search. In the first
round of data collection and reporting, it was already tiresome  but not quite as much as in the
subsequent rounds. Indeed, during the later rounds our team faced a lack of data retrievable by
the more obvious data collection criteria. Hence, the acquisition process had to involve even
more iterations. The project manager of the later project stages confessed:
Its very difficult to keep track of [laughs] everything thats going one: what I have
done and what I havent done.
3.2.6.3 Annotating data in spreadsheet software
In contrast to what a reader with a social science background might expect, our team did not use
qualitative data analysis tools such as ATLAS.ti and NVivo for human coding of Twitter, Weibo
and Instagram posts. Instead, three types of coding framework were prepared as stub Microsoft
Excel spreadsheets  i.e. files with all the required columns and data validation, but no data 
that were populated with data from each language / platform for each researcher. This may seem
like a counter-intuitive choice, but it was in fact grounded in a number of good reasons.
1. Reuse and experience. At least one of the coding frameworks used in the project was heavily
based on a framework developed by one of the investigators for an earlier project. That
framework had been implemented in Excel, so sticking to Excel did not only mean an
opportunity to reuse its stub without format conversion, but also to reuse the overall workflow
of that past project.
2. Perceived affordances. Since data coding was meant to strictly follow a predefined framework,
it made sense to create an environment for the researchers that would remind  and motivate 
them to stick to the predefined codes. An Excel spreadsheet with a separate column for each
variable-to-code and strict data validation applied to each value cell arguably was effective
in creating the image of enforcement to play by the rules  even if in practices those rules
could easily be bypassed.
3. Coding granularity. This point is related to the one above. Some of the key advantages of the
qualitative data analysis tools lie in the opportunities to apply coding to extracts of texts on
an arbitrary level of granularity  e.g. to words, sentences or whole paragraphs. However, in
66 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
the task at hand, coding was always applied to the complete social media posting, so tabular
interface was perfectly suited.
4. Format compatibility. The exports from Sysomos and Brand24 were in CSV format. To
effectively present these data for coding in the interfaces of ATLAS.ti or NVivo would have
required representing them in a more readable  yet textual  form. Most likely that would
have meant writing a script to populate HTML files with the data and formatting them with
CSS. Using spreadsheet software eliminated this need.
5. Ubiquity. Even though many analysts on the team came from humanities or qualitative
research oriented branches of social sciences  the disciplines that for the majority of the
time do not require spreadsheet software  everyone to have access to some version of
Microsoft Excel either through personal resources or through the resources of their respective
institutions.
This example shows how tool selection can  and should  be effectively tailored to a projects
needs and circumstances rather than to the default solution associated with a particular research
technique. The use of spreadsheet software did prove to be the best fit for the task at hand, to the
point that our principal investigator retained this practice in her future project that I took part in
3.2.6.4 Automating data visualisation
Arguably the biggest cost of using Excel instead of specialised qualitative data analysis tools was
the lack of automated reporting and visualisation functionality for the coded variables in Excel.
Of course, it was possible to produce very neatly formatted diagrams in Excel and, furthermore,
those diagrams would have covered almost all the chart types required to summarise the results
of human coding. The problem was in producing those diagrams at scale. Indeed, the Twitter /
Weibo data on each round of reporting were coded for 5 languages across 10 variables. Many
of the variables were multiple choice, each choice thus being reflected by a single spreadsheet
column. Considering the fact that some of the charts should have covered not only individual
variables, but also their relationships, the total required number of diagrams could reach several
hundreds for each round of reporting. Producing charts in such quantities using the Excel user
interface was impractical.
Since this was understood early on in the project, it was agreed that as part of my role as a
technical coordinator I would have to come up with a solution for effective plot generation. I
11Evaluation of the InfoMigrants information platform (see Section 3.4.1). We switched to Google Sheets
from Microsoft Excel for collaborative editing and better support of Unicode.
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 67
developed a library for generating relevant plots in R using the popular ggplot2 visualisation
package. Developing that library appeared to not only be of logistical value, but also research
value. Indeed, the library ended up influencing the research workflow and the role that plots
played in the research.
Originally, the plots were supposed to merely illustrate the reports that the researchers prepared
on the data they had been annotating. The analysts provided me with requests for the plot
types that would support their narrative. Generating the plots that were formatted to publication
standards was simplified thanks to the developed library but still not fully automated. However,
the plots that were quick-and-dirty yet still perfectly readable for someone who was familiar
with the underlying data  could be generated fully automatically and at zero extra cost. This led
to an idea of producing an exhaustive list of exploratory plots for each researcher. Those plots
were to represent distributions for all the individual variables, as well as correlations within all
the pairs of variables. The researchers could use such plots to generate further ideas for their
reports  and only then request properly formatted plots when required. This workflow was
especially successful since each researcher was to prepare a report specifically on the data they
had coded and thus had great familiarity with. Thanks to this knowledge, if an exploratory plot
flagged a spurious correlation rather than a substantive relationship, it was confidently dismissed.
3.2.7 Findings 5. Project Team and Collaboration
As is evident from the discussion above, the evaluation of Shakespeare Lives was grounded in data
from different sources and in different languages that required a broad mix of methods to analyse.
Variety of the research tasks at hand implied a broad set of skills and competencies required from
team members. As a result, our team was interdisciplinary (with team members from humanities,
social science and computer science) and international (with team members residing in the UK,
Germany and China). Such a variance of members backgrounds and circumstances is often
thought to be problematic for team collaboration (cf. Klein, 1993; Henderson, 2005; Bracken
and Oughton, 2006; Luthans and Doh, 2015).
On the other hand, the required level of team coordination was high. Even though each team
member was highly autonomous in the tasks they were working on, they all depended on the
tasks perfomed by each other. For example, while each researcher worked on reports for a
specific language on their own, they all required input from the project manager and the technical
coordinator in the form of data and visualisations, and they all had to cross-validate and calibrate
their findings among each other so that their work could be effectively synthesised by the the
project investigators, manager and technical coordinator.
68 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
Given all the above, it may seem to the reader that the team collaboration should have been
difficult to say the least. Yet, against all odds, our team was consistently collaborating smoothly
throughout the course of the project. In fact, the principal investigator and I even had an informal
discussion after the end of the project on the possible underlying reasons of this ease. Some of
those may be:
 The efforts of the first project manager, who, according to the principal investigator, did a
marvellous job in setting the project up. The project managers tasks were originally set
as high-level aims (e.g. to make sure that the researchers have the required data and that
they produce analyses in accordance with the project requirements). He turned those into
a workflow and de-facto ways of working that served us through the subsequent rounds of
reporting and developed the aforementioned provenance tracking system that supported this
workflow.
 Collaboration modes and tools, which we had a big arsenal of. As mentioned earlier, in
addition to the usual modes of remote collaboration such as Skype calls and emails, our team
greatly benefited from a series of face-to-face project meetings and the communication within
the Teamwork project management platform12. The role of each specific communication
mode will be discussed in greater detail below.
 Work ethic of the team members, who all were committed to the idea of doing quality research.
In the project meetings, it was not uncommon for the whole team to critically engage in
challenging discussions. In the observed data collection sessions, both project managers
went the extra mile to collate comprehensive yet relevant datasets. In the observed data
analysis session, the analyst of English tweets took extensive notes about the most interesting
tweets she encountered in addition to coding them. Most analysts at some point initiated new
discussions on Teamwork to share their experiences and establish best practices.
The following sections will go through the most collaboration-intensive aspects of work 
formulating data collection criteria, ensuring inter-coder consistency and selecting modes
for quantitative data representations  and will look both at the most critical obstacles for
effective team collaboration that we had to resolve and how we employed different modes of
communication to do so.
3.2.7.1 Collaboration barriers to data collection
While most of the day-to-day activities in the project were performed autonomously, distance
and time barriers sometimes were a big hurdle for collecting Twitter data. This was arguably
https://www.teamwork.com/
https://www.teamwork.com/
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 69
the most iterative process in the whole project; ironically, it was also the one that required the
closest collaboration between the project manager and each individual language research. Indeed,
both project managers employed over the course of the project were English speakers with little
to no knowledge in other languages for which they had to collect data. Therefore, the input
from language researchers was required. While the project managers did their research into
the Shakespeare Lives events happening in different countries and could use dictionaries to
formulate respective data acquisition criteria, it was quickly established that without feedback
from a respective language researcher those criteria were insufficient. First of all, the project
manager could accidentally omit morphological forms and relevant cognates. Second, some
of the relevant criteria were non-dictionary terms that appeared around the Shakespeare Lives
events, for example the aforementioned Shakesperiana  the name of a Shakespeare-themed
school competition in Russia. Additionally, the acquired data had to be appraised by at least
eyeballing to judge whether they are indeed relevant. This was somethings automated translation
could be of more help with, but an additional oversight by a language speaker was crucial.
In the absence of co-presence, online meetings via Skype were the best way to quickly perform
the required iterative collaborative work. However, since every language researcher had other
study and work commitments, the iterations over data collection criteria often had to go via
asynchronous communication tools such as email or Teamwork. Because of this mode of
communication, a bit of back-and-forth Google Translation was still required. For example,
when sending the updated sets of data collection criteria, the analysts did not always have time
to include the translations for them. It was often quicker for the project manager to double-
check those without the analysts assistance using automated translation. Furthermore, in a rare
occasion of a Skype call between the project manager and an analyst did, the project manager
tried to maximise the utility of the call and make it useful for more than just its immediate
purpose. For example, in a conversation with the English analyst before the third round of
reporting, the project manager tried to not only specify data selection criteria for English, but
also to get some benchmarks for what kind of data to acquire for other languages.
Even in cases of email communication, project manager and language analysts often still agreed
on the date when the relevant data were to be collected, so that the analyst would check their
inbox messages more often and try to provide timely feedback. From this perspective, it was
most problematic to iterate through the data retrieval criteria in Chinese, since the timezone
difference with China often effectively meant getting feedback the next day. This arguably was
an additional tacit reason for why the Chinese researcher mostly switched to Weibo data, which
she collected herself, for coding on the later stages of the research. While she continued to
analyse Twitter data as well, less emphasis on these data allowed her to be a bit less thorough in
70 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
deriving the best possible Twitter dataset, thus reducing the number of required iterations.
3.2.7.2 Collaboration barriers to inter-coder consistency
Another consequence of the language barrier was the difficulty of establishing inter-coder
consistency. While everyone could appraise the efforts of the English-language analyst, the
rest of the languages were opaque. The overall strategy that our team employed to combat this
obstacle was to put more effort into establishing a consistent approach to data coding ex-ante
and into maintaining it throughout the coding exercise rather than into the ex-poste assessment
of each others coding results.
The face-to-face project meeting were the key medium to implement this strategy. Since our
team was geographically spread out and the number of the meetings had to be kept small, it was
very important that each of the meetings was of high value for the team. In accordance with the
selected strategy for assuring inter-coder consistency, in an early project meeting that took place
before the first round of data coding, we all  not only the analysts, but also the project manager
and myself as a technical coordinator  pilot-coded a handful of tweets in English, discussed the
disparities in the outcomes and reached an agreement. This helped to establish a good level of
shared understanding of the coding framework from the start of the project. This was effectively
sufficient to establish a required level of inter-coder consistency for all categories bar the most
challenging ones, such as the aforementioned values of the British Council. The next project
meeting that took place after the first round of data coding was largely dedicated to reaching
agreement specifically on those more problematic categories.
While the two project meetings discussed above allowed to establish the required level of shared
understanding, the team still had to make sure that this understanding was maintained throughout
the project and was put into practice. For this, the project discussion boards on the Teamwork
platform became an invaluable resource. For each of the more problematic coding categories,
the researchers shared their translations of the specific tweets that they either were not sure how
to treat or they thought were the most vivid examples of when a coding value was applied. The
Teamwork discussions were especially good in that they were open to all the team members even
if only some of them participated actively and that they could be revisited as and when required,
thus allowing to retain consensus on the issues of coding.
3.2.7.3 Collaboration barriers to quantitative data representation
In order to prepare high-quality reports, the project researchers required me as a technical
coordinator to produce visualisations and to calculate statistics based on their data annotation.
The overall aim of those plots and figures was to provide an effective representation of the key
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 71
features of the coded social media posts and the most interesting relationships of those features.
While there was a list of key mandatory plot types that each researcher had to include and
interpret in their reports, most of the statistics and plots were meant to play an illustrative and
supportive function for the researchers narratives. In most cases, the researchers noticed patterns
in the data while coding it and then they would ask me to provide some form of quantitative
evidence that could either support or reject their intuition  although, as mentioned in Section
3.2.6.4, occasionally the researchers used the exhaustive exploratory plots to come up with new
narrative elements.
To be effective in my role, I had to clearly understand what aspects of the data a researchers
narrative required to represent. Generally, this was not too difficult since the nature of the data
and the analysis narrowed down the scope for appropriate representations. In most cases, plots of
two types were required: bar graphs that represented a single categorical variable and heat maps
that represented two categorical variables13. Yet, some confusion still arose from the use of the
term correlation. From the early stages of the project, we all used this term as a convenient
jargon word for a relationship between two variables  including categorical ones for which
it was not strictly defined. It became apparent that due to differences in the backgrounds of
the analysts and myself our understanding of to plot a correlation between X and Y differed
subtly.
For me, due to my background in statistics and data analysis, correlation of two variable could
be graphically represented only by a plot that showed what a change in value of one variable
implied for the distribution on another variable. Therefore, the two appropriate plot types were a
joint distribution heat map or a normalised heat map that represented conditional distributions of
one variable depending on each value of the other variable. However, to my surprise, I repeatedly
got requests to plot correlations between a particular value of one variable versus another
variable, such as Tone: Negative vs. Focus  or sometimes even between two particular values,
such as Tone: Negative vs. Focus: Britain.
At first, I ignored the specified variable values and produced standard heat maps in response.
I mistakenly treated such requests as an attempt at excessive specificity on a researchers side.
However, already during the first round of reporting it became clear that such requests came
from most researchers, so I brought the issue up during the subsequent project meeting. As the
discussion revealed, the researchers, who all had a background in social sciences or humanities,
used the word correlation in a looser sense. For them, a correlation of a X with a particular
value y of Y simply meant a conditional distribution of X when Y = y. As a distribution of only
13The main exceptions were the box plots required to support the Instagram analyst who studied the impact of
elements of visual content (categorical) on the engagement metrics (continuous).
72 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
one variable had to be plotted, bar graphs (with appropriate captions indicating the implied
condition) appeared to be a much more effective representation tool. Moreover, a correlation of
two particular values thus implied a simple count of the number of instances that satisfied both
criteria  it could be represented with a single number and did not require a plot at all
Interestingly, without being prompted, the researchers never voiced their concerns about the
unnecessary heat maps. Most likely, I would have still been producing those unnecessary heat
maps until the end of the project had I not raised this issue during a project meeting. This
could be partially attributed to the fact that the heat maps still, in principle, contained all the
information the researchers wanted to represent. The problem was that they also contained much
distracting additional information. Besides, if there is a choice between representing the same
value with either a height of a bar or an intensity of a colour, the height is easier to for visual
inspection and thus should be preferred. Thus, I would speculate that the researchers were silent
about this issue for a different reason. For them, I seemed to have authority on the issue of data
representation due to my quantitative background. They simply trusted my choice of a plot
type even if it was not exactly what they had in mind. This exemplifies how important an open
discussion is in a team and how valuable it may be to encourage others to voice their concerns
even on those matters where they are not the experts in the team.
3.2.8 Summary: Key Lessons
The Shakespeare Lives evaluation project was a truly complex social data science endeavour that
raised both hard methodological issues of making sure that the acquired data and the chosen
analysis methods suit the research questions and soft organisational issues such as maintaining
relationships with the stakeholders and ensuring smooth collaboration among the research team
members. The discussion above goes through those issues and elicits insights that should be
considered when designing the project management tool for social data science. Even though
I will refer back to the detailed accounts of the observations and their analysis given above to
inform the tool, it may be worth to quickly reflect on the experience as a whole and elicit some
of its key lessons:
1. Stakeholder engagement should be maintained continuously throughout a social data science
project. Even if a research team understands the stakeholder interests in principle, there
could be differences in details grounded in assumptions and theories rather than in real
communication with the stakeholders. Plus, even the correct perceptions of stakeholder
demands may diverge from reality over time.
2. When planning data acquisition, equal attention should be given to what the research design
3.2. EVALUATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE LIVES CULTURAL PROGRAMME 73
requires, which data actually exist and whether they are available for acquisition. The initial
data acquisition plans may change as (a) the bulk of data may come from unexpected sources,
(b) different sources may provide varying degrees of access to their data and (c) the planned
data acquisition criteria may fail to return sufficient amount of data.
3. Getting to know the data through exploratory analysis or in-depth examination of a selected
sample is pivotal in social data science. When using novel data sources, a research team may
encounter unexpected problems with the data, such as the prevalence of spam tweets, which
could otherwise easily be ignored and skew the findings.
4. Researchers should pay specific attention to the derived metrics and their interpretation.
Some of the common social data science metrics, such as the sentiment scores, while being
intuitive, simply have not been used for long enough and in sufficient variety of contexts.
Therefore, the research team may need to adjust their expectations of what a good score level
may be.
5. A social data science team may be using third-party tools for acquiring and/or analysing data.
Since the terms and conditions of such tools may change over time, researchers may wish to
consider how sure they are in their ability to run the same acquisition- and analysis jobs in
the future. They should also stay wary of how black-boxed the analyses performed with such
tools often are.
6. The choice of specific tools to analyse data with is context-dependent. Even if a particular
software solution is normally associated with a particular mode of analysis, project
circumstances may override this.
7. If a social data science team predominantly works remotely, the collaboration among its
members may be significantly enhanced by using project management platforms where
they can share the work artefacts and discuss the project, but also by establishing robust,
repeatable collaboration workflows, i.e. the de-facto ways of working.
8. In interdisciplinary teams the members may understand some discipline-specific terms
differently. It should be the responsibility of those team members who have a background in
that discipline to spot such mismatches and to establish correct shared understanding, since
for the rest of the team it may stay an unknown unknown.
As a final remark, the Shakespeare Lives evaluation project provides an example of doing social
data science in a more-or-less traditional stand-alone research setting: while the research was
applied and was meant to really shape actions of its key stakeholders (the British Council),
74 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
its outputs were presented in batches at three discrete points in time and the produced
recommendations had a strategic outlook. This does not affect the value of this case study,
but calls for analysing a case where the research process would be more closely integrated into
the wider context of a business endeavour and would inform its operationally (cf. Davenport
and Patil, 2012; Davenport et al., 2012). The following section does exactly that, as it discusses
production of a data-driven radio show.
3.3. PRODUCTION OF HIT LIST SHOW FOR BBC RADIO 5 LIVE 75
3.3 Production of Hit List Show for BBC Radio 5 live
This section describes a social data science project in data-driven content production. The project
aimed to deliver a weekly radio show for BBC Radio 5 live that presented a the most popular
stories of the week, based on an analysis of online data. The show was produced by the Wire
Free Production company in collaboration with a team of data scientists from the University
of St Andrews and the University of Warwick. This section first introduces and describes the
project and then discusses the issues that the team faced while working on the project.
3.3.1 Case Overview: BBC Radio 5 live Hit List Show
The Hit List14 show was a BBC 5 live radio programme that presented a rundown of the top 40
news, politics, sport and showbiz stories of the week that are making the biggest impact across
social media and online (British Broadcasting Corporation, nd) among the online audience in
the UK. The content of each rundown was based on the outcomes of a weekly data analysis
exercise in acquiring and aggregating data from a number of social media and other online data
platforms. Aside from occasional breaks, the show aired every Sunday evening from November
2014 to November 2016. Two Christmas specials  2015 and 2016  presented the charts of the
most popular topics for their respective years.
A normal episode lasted for 2.5 hours, although on several occasions shorter episodes (either a
top 30 or a top 20) aired due to the BBC 5 lives schedule. Given the fact that BBC 5 live Radio
aired a short hourly news block, the effective length of the show was less and allowed around
3 minutes per a chart entry on average. Such timescales implied that most of the chart entries
were treated very briefly with the shows presenter  Emma Barnett  providing a short summary
of the story. Other chart entries  internally called features  were developed in more detail. In
most cases, Emma conducted phone interviews with people connected to the story covered or
with relevant expertise. Additionally, Emma discussed the features with guest stars who would
be in the studio for the duration of the whole show. Occasionally, Emma played back excerpts
of relevant audio material. The feature stories were spread throughout the show, although their
frequency did increase towards the end of each programme, i.e. in the higher chart positions.
The process of show production was evolving throughout the course of the show with the most
drastic changes happening in the first year. These changes concerned the particular platforms
that data were collected from and the particular ways the data from each platform were treated
and aggregated. However, the overall workflow of an episode production remained constant.
14While the shows title may be spelled as a single word Hitlist, I adopt the spelling suggested by the BBCs
website (British Broadcasting Corporation, nd).
76 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
Each Friday, the teams lead data analyst (hereinafter the analyst) collated data that had been
already acquired for that week and produced the preliminary chart. The preliminary chart was
discussed by the production team in a meeting and topics were assigned to individual journalists
to work on. On Sunday, the cycle of data analysis, team meeting and pre-production repeated to
create the final version of chart. The following paragraphs outline the contents of each stage.
Data analysis. The analyst had to start very early each Friday (around 6am) to prepare the
chart on time. While the specific details of the involved work can be more productively discussed
in conjunction with the issues that arose in the process, the key tasks of the analysis were the
following:
 determine what the most popular individual entities were on each platform in the UK that
week: hashtags for Twitter, posts for Facebook, videos for YouTube or search terms for
Google Trends;
 filter out those entities that were topical rather than background noise (e.g. computer gaming
content on YouTube, spam on Twitter);
 aggregate the individual entities into clusters each representing a single topics;
 based on the popularity scores on individual entities within the cluster, order the topical
clusters into a hit list.
After completing the task, the analyst disseminated the derived chart of topics to all the team
members. The chart was implemented as a Google Spreadsheet. Since the analyst worked
remotely, the dissemination happened via e-mail.
On Sunday the analyst could afford to start around 10 am. They updated the hit list with the data
from Friday and Saturday and disseminated the final chart. The differences between the Friday
and the Sunday versions of a chart were normally small enough not to cause major issues.
Team meetings. The production team consisting of an editor and producers gathered at 10 am
each Friday for a round-table meeting to work through the topic chart collated by the analyst.
The meetings were scheduled to last for 2 hours, but occasionally took just over an hour. The
producers split the weekly topics among themselves and each producer would do some quick
preliminary research on the stories associated with their share of topics. During the rest of the
meeting, the team discussed each topic and made key production decisions:
 which chart entries would be developed into the feature stories;
3.3. PRODUCTION OF HIT LIST SHOW FOR BBC RADIO 5 LIVE 77
 the angle under which each topic would be covered and the implications in terms of
interviewees, studio guests and further research to be done;
 responsibilities for pre-production of the topics.
These discussions were moderated by the shows editor. There were two interchanging people
on the team who worked in this capacity. When neither of them was available, a senior producer
took over this role. Throughout the discussion, the editor was standing in front of a flip chart
and was documenting the decisions made on each topic. Although the decisions were made
collectively, the editor had the final say on all of them, including each producers pre-production
responsibilities. Interestingly, one of the producers on the team was the CEO of WireFree and
thus technically the boss of the team, but he happily delegated his power to an editor since those
were responsible for finalising the content of the forthcoming show.
On Sunday, the teem meetings took place at the BBCs New Broadcasting House in London.
The team started significantly later than on Friday  normally at 1 pm  and usually took no
more than half-an-hour for a meeting, as only few changes to a weekly list had to be discussed.
In those meetings, the producers would jump straight into discussion of their progress in regard
to the tasks allocated on Friday, examine the updated chart produced by the analyst and make
final decisions on the content of the hit list and on the featured stories.
Pre-production. The pre-production took the rest of the production teams day. The work
on pre-production was carried out individually by each team member with minimal interaction
among the producers. The lions share of the work was in securing guests and interviewees for
the feature stories. The producers made use of their extensive contact networks and searched for
available contact details to reach out for potential guests and make the necessary arrangements.
Other forms of pre-production included preparation of playbacks  e.g. cutting fragments of
audio from YouTube videos or pre-recording audio interviews with the guests who would be
unavailable to reach during the show  and writing scripts (text to read during the show) for the
presenter.
Pre-production work did not differ much on Friday and Sunday, other than that on Sunday it
was occasionally a bit more tense. While on Friday each producer could work at their own pace,
Sunday confronted them with, as the show went on air at 7.30 pm. The producers also had to
make sure to submit their scripts, so that the editor cast an eye on the individual scripts and to
put them into the overall script of the upcoming show. Arguably, it was those two factors that
made all the team members to work on Sunday together in one production space in the BBC
Broadcasting House, whilst on Friday some of the producers consistently chose to work from
78 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
home, though office space was available to them in New Broadcasting House.
Overall, the process of working on each Hit List episode was an involved one with the analyst and
the producers having to make numerous decisions on how to deal with the weekly acquired data,
how to interpret them and how to use those interpretations for the benefit of show production.
Those decisions presented an interesting object of study for this thesis and the weekly repetition
of the production workflow made studying them convenient. Below, I outline how I approached
the fieldwork for this case study.
3.3.2 Fieldwork Methods
The methodology of studying the production of the Hit List radio show is similar to that of the
previously discussed Shakespeare Lives case study, as it is rooted in participant observation of
the studied project. However, there are some important distinctions caused by the circumstances.
I did not have an opportunity to join the Hit List team until 13 months into the show. By then, a
lot of the most influential decisions on how the online data that informed the charts were treated
had already been made and the data analysis job had been significantly streamlined. Moreover, I
could not join analyst in their weekly work  as mentioned above, the analyst worked remotely
and not in business hours. On the other hand, I could join the production team meetings and
observe the pre-production work when the producers worked at New Broadcasting House. The
fieldwork methods employed were designed to make the best use of the circumstances outlined
above. The table below summarises the activities that I undertook while studying the project:

3.3. PRODUCTION OF HIT LIST SHOW FOR BBC RADIO 5 LIVE 79
From January to November 2016 I was present at most Friday meetings of the production team.
Those were the key points in time when I could observe the producers making sense of the data
presented by the analyst. While most of my observations were passive, sometimes I took on a
more active role in the production work by taking on a small share of topics to do background
research. This helped both with understanding the mindset of a producer and with establishing
good relationships with the team, since some of my production suggestions were developed
into feature stories on the show. On a couple of occasions the lead data analyst managed to
make their way to London so we could observe the production work together and reflect on that
cooperatively.
In addition to observing and participating in the production work, I took on a role of data
consultant. If the team had questions or concerns about particular entries in a weekly chart, they
asked me to investigate those either by looking deeper into the data and/or by communicating
with the analyst via email or chat software. This role allowed me to make my presence to be
continuously helpful for the production team and thus to further strengthen my relationship with
them. Additionally, by studying the data and having discussions with the analyst I significantly
deepened my insight into the data analysis, its strengths and limitations.
After the end of the Hit List run, I interviewed two producers on the team who participated in
Hit List production throughout the two years of the shows course. These interviews helped to
calibrate some of the fieldwork notes, to elicit the producers own perceptions of the data and
the analysis and also to provide context to the observations  e.g. in how the later months of
working on the Hit List differed from the earlier ones and how the experience differed from other
projects they had participated in.
The analyst and I also had a number of remote and face-to-face meetings in which we reviewed
the methodology of data acquisition, cleaning, quality assurance and analysis. We discussed
possible improvements to the methodology and reviewed the analysis code. For example, once
we discovered and fixed a small bug in the acquisition code for Facebook data. Some of those
sessions were aligned to coincide with a particular analysis challenge that the analyst faced  for
example, charting the topics in a Christmas special episode. Furthermore, the analyst provided
me with additional resources to study their work even deeper. We graphically modelled the data
processing pipelines for three out of the four online platforms used in data collection. In addition,
the analyst gave me access to all the code they had developed for the Hit List so I could review it
at my own pace.
While the wider data science team was involved in the production of the show only sporadically,
they held one collective meeting towards the end of the show run. The meeting had a strategic
80 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
outlook and mostly generated suggestions for future runs of the Hit List that could have happened
if the show had got recommissioned. In that meeting, I actively participated in brainstorming
changes to the design of the new machine learning algorithms for automated topic detection in
the data. Those changes were supposed to improve the algorithm performance and make them
more useful for the analyst.
3.3.3 Findings 1. Data Acquisition and Pre-processing: Linking Large
Datasets
boyd and Crawford (2012) define Big Data through three pillars: technology, analysis and
mythology. While in this thesis I stray from using Big Data terminology, preferring social
data science instead, it is noteworthy how well the three-pillar framework matches some of the
key issues involved in the production of the Hit List. To start with, the technological pillar is
defined as maximizing computation power and algorithmic accuracy to gather, analyze, link,
and compare large data sets. (boyd and Crawford, 2012, p. 663). Linking and comparing
datasets lay at the heart of the process of composing the Hit List chart, as the analyst collated
data from different online platforms. This is by no means an exclusive property of the Hit List
case compared to the other cases studied in this thesis. In the previously discussed Shakespeare
Lives project our team also dealt with data from Facebook, Twitter, VK.com and Sina Weibo.
However, two particular aspects are specific to the Hit List case:
1. The data from different platforms were pre-cooked to different degrees.
2. The analyst had to collate all the data into one and only one hit list.
Both issues are discussed in detail below.
3.3.3.1 How raw the raw data were
After the first several months of the shows run, the list of platforms was firmly established as
Twitter, Facebook, Google Trends and YouTube. The only mode of accessing data from those
platforms that was realistic given the budget constraints and the need to produce the show weekly
was to use automated data acquisition jobs that connected to the platforms APIs or feeds to
obtain the platforms raw data. However, as Gitelman 2013, p. 3 notes, there is no such thing
as truly raw data, since data need to be imagined as data to exist and function as such, and
the imagination of data entails an interpretive base. While all the Hit List data captured one
underlying phenomena  a users interaction with an online platform  the way this essence
was represented in the acquired data varied both due to the specifies of the data sources and the
3.3. PRODUCTION OF HIT LIST SHOW FOR BBC RADIO 5 LIVE 81
decisions of the analyst. As a result, at the very moment of acquisition the data from different
platforms were pre-cooked to a varying degree.
Twitter data were arguably the rawest. The analyst employed the Twitter Streaming APIs Sample
endpoint to continuously acquire a 1% random sample of all the published tweets in the world
in real time. Such data were potentially the richest, however they also required the most initial
treatment from the analyst before the core analysis tasks (identification of which narrow themes
in the data were topical/news-worthy and how wide the boundaries of an individual theme were)
became at all possible. First of all, the data coming from parts of the world other than the UK
had to be filtered out, which is discussed in detail in Section 3.3.3.3. Second, the individual
tweets had to be somehow thematically aggregated. The most straightforward way to do that was
through identifying the most commonly used hashtags and collating the tweet counts for those
that belonged to one topic. Since multiple hashtags were often used in one tweet, the analyst first
derived the list of the most common hashtags and then, for each of those common hashtags, a
list of their co-occurring hashtags. The analyst used their judgement to pick-and-choose from
these lists, thus forming topical hashtag clusters.
In the case of YouTube, the analyst could make use of quite significant data pre-cooking on the
platforms side thanks to YouTubes automatically generated and continuously updated playlists
of most popular videos in each country, including the UK15. While YouTube did not openly
state how often the UK playlist was updated and how long it was, through trial-and-error the
analyst determined that the updates happened approximately every 20 minutes and that the
playlist always consisted of 200 videos. Thus, the YouTube data collection job made calls to
the YouTube API 3 times an hour throughout the week to access the current contents and order
of this playlist. Such use of the playlist made the acquired data pre-cooked on several levels
compared to Twitter:
 Out-of-the-box, the data reflected the interests specifically of the UK public.
 Instead of coming at the level of individual user interactions (posting a tweet), YouTube
data came at the level of individual objects (videos) with which the interactions (watching,
liking, commenting, etc.) could happen. Therefore, no additional analysis stage of reducing
individual interactions to thematic objects (analogous to reducing tweets to their hashtags)
was required.
 The order of videos in each individual playlist gave the analyst a pre-cooked popularity
score for each video. Instead of deriving their own popularity measure (e.g. some integrated

82 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
rating that would take into account views, likes, comments and other metrics), the analyst
could simply assign a high score to the videos at the top of the playlist and a low score
to the videos at the bottom of the playlist. The procedure that YouTube used to order its
auto-generated playlists was completely black-boxed, however it was not that much of a
concern in the case of the Hit List. Moreover, YouTubes playlist ordering was most certainly
better informed than any measure the analyst could design, since the publicly available data
of videos popularity were presumably not as rich as YouTubes internal data. The use of this
pre-cooked popularity score avoided repeated additional API calls to acquire details on each
individual video, which might have led to rate-limiting. The considerations of what data to
use therefore were influenced by other factors, to do with the proprietary nature of the data.
The data from Google Trends were acquired in a similar manner  i.e. repeatedly with a 20
minute interval  from the Google Trends Atom feed. In many ways these data were similar to
YouTube data (presumably since both platforms belonged to the Google product ecosystem).
The data represented a list of the most popular Google search terms in the UK at the moment
that could be treated in a similar manner to the YouTube playlist. The only difference was that
the Google Trends lists of search terms were sorted by only one parameter  the total number of
searches for a term within the reported time frame  and that the data did include an approximate
number of the search requests, for example 100,000+ or 5,000+ with larger numbers having
lower granularity. Having to aggregate such estimates rather than exact values was a typical
example of a limitation associated with dealing with proprietary data. However, since such
aggregates provided insight into at least the order of magnitude to the search term popularity,
using those still gave higher precision than only using their chart positions in the Atom feed. The
subsequent aggregation of weekly data for both YouTube and Google Trends boiled down to
summation of the chosen popularity scores for each video / search term across all the considered
scrapes.
The Facebook data were almost well-done immediately at the point of acquisition. In principle,
the Facebook Graph API allowed to acquire data on an arbitrary level of granularity  e.g., if
there had been such a desire, the analyst could acquire detailed data on each individual like.
However, as the experiments revealed to the analyst, Facebook put severe restrictions on the
number of requests that could be made to the API, as the speed with which Facebook returned
responses to the API requests fell dramatically over time. Because of that and a lack of convenient
methods to collect a random sample of the relevant Facebook data, the analyst had to come
up with an acquisition approach that would be very selective both in terms of the particular
Facebook pages  i.e. either individual user pages or organisational public pages  and in terms
of the acquired data types.
3.3. PRODUCTION OF HIT LIST SHOW FOR BBC RADIO 5 LIVE 83
The chosen approach was to limit the acquisition to weekly posts from the public pages of the
UK news media organisations with substantial following on Facebook and to use post-level
engagement metrics  comments, likes and shares. This approach involved a noteworthy trade-off:
on the one hand, it went a bit against the motto of the show as it did not expand the shows agenda
beyond the items already reported in mainstream news media. On the other hand, the derived
Facebook data were very convenient to work with as by their very nature they represented almost
exclusively news-worthy topics judged to be interesting to the UK public. Minimal moderation
from the analysts side was required. When comparing this back to the complex process of
making the Twitter data workable, it becomes self-evident that calling data coming from these
two platforms equally raw would be a drastic oversimplification.
3.3.3.2 Aggregating data across platforms
While the discussion above shows the complexity of bringing the data to the state when the
popularity of the represented topics could be assessed within each platform, turning those
platform-wise popularity estimations into a coherent integrated rating was a significant issue on
its own. The data from different platforms represented qualitatively different interactions between
the users and the topics and were also affected by the relative popularity of the platforms and the
difference in their demographic profiles (Duggan and Brenner, 2013). It is non-trivial to judge
how much a single Facebook comment in search queries or in tweets. Moreover, the YouTube
score, as discussed above, was based on relative positions of a video in an auto-generated playlist
rather than on raw counts of underlying user interactions.
The approach that the data science team agreed upon was making separate charts for individual
platforms and then aggregating those via assigning each platform a weight. Thus, the 40 most
popular topics on each platform received a platform-specific score distributed from 40 to 1
inversely to the topics position in the platform chart. A weighted sum of those scores across all
platforms then gave a topics overall score.
This approach had profound consequences for the contents of the show. First, it allowed a good
degree of variety in the covered topics. Each platform had its own characteristic trending content
 partially due to the platform mechanics and the demographics of their user-base, partially due
to the way we collected the data from each platform (cf. Ruths and Pfeffer, 2014). For example,
YouTube appeared to be prone to carrying viral, entertaining content, while Facebook, by
the construction of the data acquisition process, was newsy. With the approach taken, the
most popular content from each platform was presented somewhere in the chart even in those
weeks when that platform had not gained high absolute levels of interaction. On the other hand,
a platform-specific topic, no matter how overwhelmingly popular it was within one platform,
84 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
could never take a top spot from a theme that was trending across multiple data sources. This
sometimes led to a more predictable top-5/top-10 (with Brexit and the US Presidential Elections
being at the top of the list for around half of 2016), but gave us additional confidence in the top
slots of the chart.
However, arguably even more important consequence of the approach taken to link the platform-
specific datasets was the ability to weight the platforms differently. The weights fluctuated during
the first year of the programme, but from August 2015 to the end of the show they have remained
constant. The key factors behind the chosen weights were:
 A strive for a diverse and balanced list of topics. Some of the key dimensions to balance
were (a) uniqueness of the topics in a weekly chart vs. coverage of the topics trending across
the mainstream media, (b) UK vs. international focus, (c) hard news vs. entertainment. The
degree to which the balance was achieved was assessed mainly by the show producers, for
whom this balance was a major selling point of the show. As one of the producers said in an
interview, the breadth of the stories [...] from either side of the spectrum and everything in
between was vital to what made [the Hitlist] so good. Moreover, as her colleague observed:
I think [the Hit List] is really reflective of how people digest news. So many
people actually just digest news through social media, so they are looking at one
second a cute panda and the next second Donald Trump. [... Traditional] news,
they havent caught up with this; thats why this is so important.
 Striving for a workable list. One aim in compiling the list was to allow the show producers to
give the topics a proper journalistic treatment. While the producers were up for the challenge
that the data-driven reporting brought and were happy to study topics they would not normally
come across in their work, some topics lacked in substance beyond repair by journalistic
work. YouTube, as the least event-driven and the most content-driven platform, contributed
a lion share to this problem, which naturally led to it being the lowest rated platform. In
addition to using the weightings, informal rules emerged that aimed to exclude content that
did not fit the definition of news for a general audience. Examples were music videos or
gaming videos (see Section 3.3.4 for a more detailed discussion of content exclusion).
 The level of confidence in and experience with processing data from various platform. At the
very start of the show Twitter was the only data source. While its data were in a sense the
most problematic to deal with, the data science team members (including the lead analyst)
had had the most previous experience in dealing with Twitter data out of all online platforms.
For these reasons, Twitter stayed the highest weighted platform for the course of the show.
3.3. PRODUCTION OF HIT LIST SHOW FOR BBC RADIO 5 LIVE 85
By contrast, Facebook was initially added with a low weight, but after several months, when
its high news-value and important role in counter-balancing data from other platforms had
been robustly established, it was advanced to the same highest weight as Twitter.
It is worth noting that the motivation behind the selected weights was very practical and pragmatic.
The weights did not necessarily reflect our perception of the relative importance of the selected
platforms, or our understanding of the overall volumes of interaction on them. Rather than
that, they were used to support the end-goal of the project: production of an interesting and
varied weekly news chart for live radio that would resonate with the audience. This may seem
a bit counter-intuitive given the shows data-driven, evidence-based nature, but arguably is a
common goal for all such attempts at creating trending features  for example, in the case of
the aforementioned YouTube playlist of the most popular UK videos, it is hard to imagine that
Google compiles it for any other reason than engaging audiences.
3.3.3.3 Filtering UK data
The discussion above suggests that most of the data processing that had to be performed beyond
the straight-forward automated data aggregation was done manually by the analyst who exercised
their judgement on the topic boundaries and news-worthiness. However, it has also been
mentioned that the Twitter data were acquired in the form of a real-time 1% random sample.
This motivated the use of machine learning to filter out the tweets that did not come from the
UK. Indeed, when charting the topics discussed on Twitter, the analyst could not afford to only
rely on the tweets that contained geolocation data, as such tweets were extremely sparse. The
geolocation codes are contained in only about 5% of tweets (Graham et al., 2014)  and that
would have been 5% of a 1%. Hence, for the vast majority of data we had to infer their country
of origin using a classification algorithm. The analyst employed a Bayesian classifier that had
been implemented by a different data scientist on the team and had been trained on the tweets
that did have geocodes. A revised version of the classifier is discussed by Zubiaga et al. (2017).
The version of the classifier employed in the production of the Hit List reported on precision and
recall at 85% and 68% respectively, which implied an expected level of 15% false positives in the
filtered data. It is worth examining how the application of an algorithm with known limitations
affected the chart itself, the teams perception of that chart and how it was dealt with.
While the filtering algorithm definitely allowed for a collation of a much more UK-centric list of
topics, it systematically left in a loosely defined set of topics (expressed as hashtags) that the Hit
List team strongly suspected to be false positives. The suspicion was rooted in (a) the absence of
these topics in the charts of the other individual platforms (b) the Hit List teams expectations
and perceptions of what might be of interest for the UK public on Twitter and beyond and (c)
86 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
common features shared by many of those topics. Those topics tended to be US-centric, which
could be explained by the fact the the US sector of Twitter was by far the largest and that the
majority of British and American tweets shared a common language, which could lead to further
confusion for the classifier. Some of those topics were left in the chart (e.g. the highly topical
political ones around the US presidential election and the Black Lives Matter movement), while
others (e.g. related to some of the US-specific TV talk shows) were eliminated manually by
the analyst. Interestingly, if the analyst had not manually discarded those topics, some of them
would have consistently charted for consecutive weeks. Such repeating irrelevant chart entries
could have been specifically annoying to the shows audience.
A closely related concern was in regard to the low recall rate of the algorithm. The time- and
resource constraints of the Hit List production did not allow for studying the unfiltered version
of a chart, so while the analyst did their best to deal with false positives, they were ill-equipped
against false negatives. In principle, since the hashtags/topics were not used as features in
the country classifier, it was not completely unreasonable to assume that a probability of a
UK-originating tweet to be discarded was independent from the tweets topic  however, this
assumption never was actually tested. Potentially, there could have been topics popular in the
UK that were pushed down the list significantly more than others. Since the analyst practically
never looked further down the list of hashtags than the top 100, some of those topics could have
never even got a chance to be noticed. Yet, the Twitter charts were sufficiently varied and by
far and large did not contradict the expectations of the analyst and the production team, so the
pragmatic reasons to investigate this issue were not worth the required resource investment.
The discussions with the analyst also indicate that over time they got accustomed to the systematic
biases of the country classifier (or, more precisely, what the Hit List team perceived as those
systematic biases). In addition to the machine-learned classifier, the analyst trained themselves
to be a better human classifier. Some seemingly odd topics  or rather types of topics 
appeared in the data so consistently, that over time treating them became routine. The analyst
and the production team would agree to either systematically leave in or discard those topics
from week to week. By contrast, the questionable topics that were presented in the data as
a one-off on a particular week could cause hesitation. Most often, the analyst would leave
them in for the production team to decide. The production team would normally come to a
definitive conclusion on their own or after further consulting with me and, if required, the analyst.
On several occasions, making a judgement call was extremely tough. For example, one week
an unexpected hashtag #purple trended in the data on Friday. The team went through some
struggles before identifying that the hashtag corresponded to then-premiering movie Purple
about the Ghanaian music scene. Lack of coverage of the movie in the mainstream media and
3.3. PRODUCTION OF HIT LIST SHOW FOR BBC RADIO 5 LIVE 87
the perceived unexpectedness of the topic raised eyebrows during the team meeting. However, as
Ghana-related topics were not the usual suspects for geographical misclassification, we did not
feel we had enough grounds to exclude the topic from the chart. Ultimately, the topic appeared
to be below the top-40 on Sunday, thus freeing us from the need to decide its fate.
Interestingly, the use of a machine learning algorithm to filter data potentially affected the
human algorithmic treatment of some topics. Indeed, as the analyst worked with the data that
had been pre-filtered by a classifier, they were arguably a bit more reserved in their own data
manipulations. The aforementioned topic of the US elections provides an example. It would
not be unreasonable to assume that its consistent overwhelming popularity according to our
data was at least partially due to misclassification. In fact, this suspicion was shared by the
analyst, the production team and myself and was amplified by the fact that the US elections were
consistently charting as the top-1 topic on Twitter for about half of 2016. To remedy this, we
could have decided that the analyst should penalise the US-related topics when constructing
the chart. However, as we knew that (a) the UK population talked about the major US-related
topics anyway and (b) crucially, the data had already been pre-filtered by a trained classifier, the
decision to penalise these stories was never made and the analyst did not adjust the scores of the
US-related hashtags.
3.3.4 Findings 2. Data Analysis: Identifying Hit List Chart Entries
Determining which data represented topical stories and which boundaries the respective topics
had constituted the bulk of the analysts work. This task also involved the greatest amount of
moderation by the production team. In this sense, it was arguably the most cooperative part of
Hit List production. Each week, when distributing a new chart to the team via email, the analyst
reported on all the core decisions that had went into the chart collation, so that the team could
question those and potentially reverse them. Some decisions, as already indicated in Filtering UK
data, could be applied to data consistently from week to week and thus did not require reporting
every time  however they did require initial coordination and the producers approval. Finally,
there were cases when the analyst did not notice a reason to discarding a topic or for aggregating
/ splitting topics, in which case it was the production teams judgement that would drive the
decision.
Cleaning signal from noise. While most of the weekly data acquired for the Hit List
production indeed corresponded to a particular story happening that week, some of them were
what the production team called background noise. The noise was often caused either by
(a) natural routine activities of platform users and (b) artificial boosting of particular types
88 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
of user-interactions. Gaming-related YouTube videos were a good example of the (a)-type
noise. Those videos are genuinely popular and constitute a large portion of YouTubes content
consumption. In December 2014, it was reported that 15% of all YouTube videos showed the
process of playing video games (Marshall, 2014). At least 6 out of 10 YouTube channels that
have been recently reported to be the most subscribed-to in the world are dedicated to gaming
(Fitz-Gerald and Butkovic, 2018). It is not surprising that the game-play videos frequented the
unfiltered YouTube charts. As these videos usually did not provide anything for the production
team to report on, they were routinely discarded from the very start of using YouTube data.
As an example of the (b)-type noise, Google Doodles skewed Google Trends data. A Google
Doodles typically is an interactive short animation that Google puts on its search engines home
web-page. These animations often correspond to an anniversary of an event that Googles staff
consider significant, but that would often not be of major interest to the general public otherwise.
A recent example is a Doodle that celebrates the 62nd birthday of an Ebola-fighting physician
Dr. Stella Adadevoh16. A days Google Doodle is displayed to everyone who visits Googles
front page. Normally, if a user clicks on a days Doodle they are redirected to a page displaying
Google search results for the person or the event portrayed in the Doodle. These searches, while
arguably being often spontaneous or even accidental, dramatically boost the respective search
terms positions in Google Trends data.
The decision that the analyst should exclude the data on the Google Doodles searches from
consideration was agreed at the early stages of the project. Interestingly, in one of the last
weeks of the Hit List airtime, the analyst accidentally left a Doodle-related data entry in when
compiling a Friday version of a chart. That Doodle was dedicated to an anniversary of the first
edition of Michael Endes best-selling fantasy novel The Neverending Story. One of the teams
producers was so touched by the apparent public response to the anniversary that they suggested
to develop it into one of the weeks feature stories. In turn, I did happen to notice the source of
the anniversarys popularity and, as a data consultant, felt responsible to point it out to the
team. To my great surprise, it appeared that no one on the production team even remembered the
decision to discard Doodle-related data in the first place. And, since the story was very appealing
to the team as a whole anyway, it was left on the chart regardless.
The above-discussed episode highlights two important points. First, the long-term decisions
on how the analyst should treat the data were essentially heuristics. They did not warrant to
always provide the best result  rather than that, they aimed to secure sufficiently good results
on a continuous basis and to also be workable. Second, while implementation (and control of
implementation) of those decisions was routine for the analyst and for me and therefore we were
https://www.google.com/doodles/stella-adadevohs-62nd-birthday
https://www.google.com/doodles/stella-adadevohs-62nd-birthday
3.3. PRODUCTION OF HIT LIST SHOW FOR BBC RADIO 5 LIVE 89
fully aware of those decisions, over time such decisions became effectively black-boxed for the
production team, even though they had participated in making them.
To finish the discussion of the types of background noise in the data, it is worth noting that some
of the discarded themes in the data were background noise of types (a) and (b) simultaneously.
The prominence of hashtags related to popular boy-bands, especially One Direction, in Twitter
data was an example of that. On the one hand, the numerous fans genuinely discussed One
Direction. As such, the hashtags in the data were a by-product of normal routine of UK Twitter
users. However, one aspect of the Twitter interactions around One-Direction and other acts
popular among similar demographic groups provided an additional boost specifically to the use
of hashtags: voting. One of the producers of Hit List recalls this issue in an interview:
Some voting things, MTV music awards and things like that, like American music
awards [were] some things I clearly felt were there because people were voting for
them, and that was like teenagers going mad and clicking things a million times.
Indeed, music award pages, band fan clubs and other public pages on Twitter dedicated to
entertainment for teenagers frequently encouraged their followers to vote for one act or another.
An eligible vote usually had to come in the form of a tweet with a suggested hashtag. Thus,
even those fans who would otherwise prefer not to use hashtags (or would forget to use them),
were helped to reconsider. While over time the analyst did improve in identifying and discarding
poll-provoked data consistently, in the early weeks of Hit List those data did pose a challenge.
3.3.4.1 Questioning essence of news
As the reader can conclude from the discussion above, at least a conceptual understanding of
what constituted background noise in the data was established quite early in the cycle of Hit
List production. However, this did not mean that anything that was not background noise actually
had any reporting value and was genuinely news-worthy. And even if there was some story
attached to a chart entry, it was not necessarily appropriate for nationwide broadcasting. This all
posed the question of what news was and whether something had to be news in the first place
to appear on Hit List. In practice, this question could not be answered definitely and had to be
dealt with on a case-by-case basis with the answer depending on the particulars of the story, on
its wider context and partially even on producers own research and journalistic treatment.
For example, once a viral video that displayed a man sexually pleasing himself with a McDonalds
McChicken burger trended in the data. The videos gross content and apparent lack of substantial
story made it an almost sure candidate for exclusion from the chart. However, it was decided
90 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
during the production team meeting to do additional research into the story to make sure that
pulling the plug was the right thing to do. This research revealed a very interesting background
story to the videos popularity (Thielman, 2016). Not long before the release of the video,
Facebook changed the way the Facebook Trending feature was compiled. The company
switched from manual curation of data (not unlike the one employed for the Hit List production)
to an entirely automated machine-learning solution. The company thus responded to a public
backlash, as its editorial had been accused of left-wing bias. The change to automatic generation
of Facebook Trending subsequently brought a lot of problems, among which was the failure to
filter out the McChicken story. This exposed the video to a large segment of Facebook audience,
providing a positive feedback loop for its popularity. The topic of algorithmic failure in news
curation was so exciting for the Hit List production team that the McChicken story was not only
left in the chart, but also developed into a feature.
Sometimes online content that attracted user interactions was not new by itself, thus begging
the question of whether there was a fresh story attached to those interactions. For example,
a YouTube trailer of a movie Straight Outta Compton trended in September 2016. Trailers
frequently charted high in YouTube data, however this particular trailer was for a movie that
had been more than a year old. As a data consultant, I was asked to investigate the case. The
real story that caused the surge in the trailer views appeared to be the death of Jerry Heller 
an American music manager who had worked with many rap artists and producers whose life
stories were captured in that movie. By contrast, in other cases, the online content that was
seemingly new after further investigation appeared to be merely a new upload of old materials.
Such content often got popular not because of new story developments but because some of the
audience had missed it the first time. Yet again, this was a common case with YouTube videos 
for example, a video of a woman having a mental breakdown in public transport that charted
once in 2016 was a new upload of a video from 2011. Facebook pages of news media, especially
tabloids, also were noticed to reprise old content, presumably for click-bait. For example, the
Daily Mail once reported on an old video of a school boy winning a fight with a bully. In most
cases these uploads of old content were discarded by the production team, however it was always
a decision made with discretion.
3.3.4.2 Defining topic boundaries
Similarly to deciding whether to discard or to consider a particular story, the decisions on the
topic boundaries could be either strategic or ad-hoc. As an example of a case that required
to be handled strategically, during the English Premiere League football season, discussions
about the games and about the football clubs involved were consistently trending in the data.
That posed a challenge. While the ongoing developments within the Premier League were not
3.3. PRODUCTION OF HIT LIST SHOW FOR BBC RADIO 5 LIVE 91
seen as non-topical and thus completely ignored, most of the time they did not involve any
specific stories to report that would go beyond the details of particular games. Furthermore,
BBC 5live aired a lot of sport-related programmes anyway; some of them were right next to
Hit List in the programme schedule. Therefore, featuring sport games on Hit List would have
sounded redundant. From this perspective, it might have seemed reasonable to collate all the
football-related data into one large topic and to talk about it only once during the show. However,
such a topic would have consistently been at the top of the chart and thus it would have suggested
a full feature coverage. By contrast, treating each football team as a topic of its own occupied
more positions in the chart  but those were normally lower than top-10, thus allowing to give
them only a brief mention and to focus the discussion on other stories.
While each football team was treated as a topic in its own, the online discussions often focused on
particular games, thus involving two teams at once. Some of the most highly trending hashtags
in Twitter data had the form of #[team]vs[team], e.g. #MUNvsMCI for a Manchester derby. The
analyst had to decide how to deal with such cases. It was decided early in the programme that
the analyst would split the points for collective hashtags between the mentioned teams. The
splitting could have been either weighted (for example, proportionate to the number of isolated
mentions of each team) or unweighted, i.e. half-and-half. Although both versions were not
difficult to implement, the analyst went with the unweighted split. This helped to further keep
the football lower on the chart as the more popular team could not get a boost from more split
points in its favour. Over time, the practice of half-and-half split became an analysis routine and
started to be applied to other cases when splitting was required. An example of such event was
the Iowa caucuses  a political event in the state of Iowa that essentially represented the first
act of primary (inter-party) elections for both the Democratic and the Republican parties. The
caucuses provoked the use of generic hashtags for two distinct stories, one about each of the two
parties.
On several occasions, a connection between two topics became evident only as a result of in-
depth examination of the related stories. This was especially true for one-off topics that required
ad-hoc treatment. For example, one week Facebook data showed a high level engagement with
the BBCs article profiling Tammy Saunders who had suffered a partial loss of her face. The
same week, a then-recent episode of The Undatables  a dating programme for people with
challenging conditions (Hawkins, 2016)  charted on several platforms due to the appearance
of a popular rugby player. At first glance, the stories seemed to bear no relationship. Therefore,
the analyst, who had limited time to work through the story details, placed them as two different
entries on the chart. Luckily, the production team became really interested in Tammys story.
By digging deeper, they figured out that the reason her story had got spotlight in the first place
92 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
was her participation in one of the previous episodes of The Undatables. This discovered
link allowed to strengthen the coverage of Tammys case by contextualising it in the broader
discussion around the TV programme.
3.3.4.3 Machine learning for topic classification
Since defining topic boundaries was such a big task, an attempt to assist the analyst by the
means of employing a machine learning algorithm was taken. The same data scientist who had
implemented the Twitter country classifier also implemented an algorithm for clustering data
basing on the vocabulary employed in their textual fields. The underlying assumption was that
different topics required different words to be discussed, and therefore the resulting data clusters
would correspond to individual topics. The clustering outcomes were thought to be used as a
starting point for the analysts work, who would then tweak the derived clusters as required.
The clustering algorithm was tested by the analyst in his work on data from Google Trends. This
platform was chosen because of the richness of the textual descriptive metadata that Google
returned for each search term. The Google Trends data included a short textual description for
each search terms plus a list of related news article headlines. Unfortunately, the algorithm
performed significantly below the expectations. There was a tendency for a formation of a giant
cluster whose member terms were often unrelated, while the rest of the search terms tended to
not pair into clusters at all. As a result, while the clustering algorithm continued to be a part
of the Google Trends data processing just in case it would flag up a connection between topics
that the analyst could miss, the analyst effectively had to aggregate search terms into topic from
scratch.
Several factors could have contributed to the algorithms week performance. Some of those had
to do with the specific design decisions that were taken in the implementation of the clustering
procedure. For example, it employed a bag-of-words approach to feature extraction (Zhang et al.,
2010)  essentially, each of the clustered pieces of text was presented as an unordered set of its
individual words weighted by word occurrence in the text. Such a representation significantly
reduced the richness of data and could have been too simplistic to capture the similarities and
differences between textual descriptions of the compared search terms. The clustering algorithm
employed was also designed to make it more likely for bigger clusters to attract new members
than for the small ones, which could partially explain the giant cluster anomaly.
However, there was an arguably even larger conceptual issue involved. In machine learning
terms, the task of identifying topical clusters could only be posed as an unsupervised one. In
unsupervised learning classification tasks, the clusters emerge from the data by themselves
through sheer differences and similarities of the statistical properties of the individual data points.
3.3. PRODUCTION OF HIT LIST SHOW FOR BBC RADIO 5 LIVE 93
This is to contrast with supervised learning where the list of the expected data classes is given
and the expected statistical properties of those classes can be inferred from the gold standard
data. Supervised classifiers are expected to outperform unsupervised ones since the gold standard
data can guide them; yet they, by definition, cannot deal with data where the list of classes is not
known in advance. Since in the task-at-hand a class represented a topic, the algorithm could only
have been supervised if all the same topics had trended each week, which obviously was not the
case.
What the unsupervised learning approach missed out  and what the analyst, by contrast,
successfully used to their benefit  was that many topics did trend each week. The analyst
accumulated the knowledge on the reoccurring topics over time to the point of often effortless
spotting those topics in a weekly portion of data. Moreover, even dealing with genuinely new
topics and search terms became easier for the analyst over time since they got deeper knowledge
of the overall news landscape and better understanding of how the data were structured, what
to expect of them and how to make sense of them. In a way, while the task of identifying the
particular topics continued to be mostly unsupervised for the analyst (bar the usual suspect
topics), the task of identifying those features of the data that were most helpful to determine
new topics was very well supervised by their past experience. Designing a machine learning
algorithm that would be able, like the analyst, to use the historical classification examples to
guide a future unsupervised clustering, was the only real way to match the analysts performance
to any significant degree. Yet, the complexity of the involved work was way above the time that
the machine learning expert on the data science team could afford to invest.
A possible compromise that could have provided at least some real help to the analyst (albeit
limited) while not requiring that much effort to implement was to train a traditional supervised
classifier to identify the usual suspect topics. In principle, it could even have been used in
conjunction with an unsupervised classifier with a condition that the latter would have been
applied only to the search terms that did not fall into any of the common categories with
a sufficiently high probability. I proposed this solution during a data science team meeting.
Unfortunately, that meeting was held closer to the end of the run of the Hit List and was aimed
to suggest changes to the production of Hit List that would be implemented if the show was
re-commissioned. Since the show was taken off the BBCs schedule, due to external factors, the
suggestion did not get a chance to be implemented and tested.
3.3.5 Findings 3. Producers and Data: Establishing Trust
Given how many decisions had to go into collating a weekly Hit List chart and how pragmatic
and driven by journalistic interest some of those decisions were, a reader might think that the
94 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
production team did not consider communicating data honestly as important as producing an
entertaining show. However, in practice, most team members had a very strong ethos of staying
true to the data.
An example of the teams commitment to the charts was once observed on a Sunday, shortly
before an episode of Hit List was scheduled to go on air. That weeks data happened to be
less interesting than average. The shows presenter noticed that and complained about it to the
head of the production team leader, possibly in a hope that some more exciting stories could
be injected into the chart. In response, the team leader advised her to reconsider her stance on
the chart and to treat it like the weather, i.e. like something given rather that as something to
tweak and adjust.
The strict commitment to the data demonstrates the teams trust in the data. The source of this
trust varied across different team members. The following discussion shows how the varying
attitudes of the team members contributed to trusting the data and what role the form in which
the data was presented to the producers played.
3.3.5.1 Attitudes to data
The interviews with the two producers conducted as part of this case study demonstrated very
different attitudes to the data that, nevertheless, both resulted in supporting the staying true to
the data ethos. One of the interviewed producers built her relationship with data based on her
understanding of the ethos of working in a production environment. According to her stance,
trusting the data was almost a prerequisite for the production work to be carried out.
If we are given a chart with the methodology that you [i.e. the analyst and myself
as the data consultant] use, we have to trust that your data collection is correct.
Because [it is a bad idea to] relate this information to the audience [and] bother
them with the science behind. [...] And I am not gonna question how you got there.
Im trusting that you have used your tools and [data science methods to] put it all
together correctly for me to make a value of it.
It is worth noting that she also found weekly charts to usually match her own social media
experience. The combination of this match and the ethos expressed above made her opinion on
sticking to the data very strong. She admitted to hate those rare instances when for practical
reasons the chart had to be bent and strongly disapproved of shortcuts and quick-fixes that
could ease the producers lives but would violate the chart.
3.3. PRODUCTION OF HIT LIST SHOW FOR BBC RADIO 5 LIVE 95
The other interviewed producer had a more critical outlook on the data. She actively reflected on
the analysis involved and had spotted its limitations. For example, she did notice that the charts
were often skewed towards the events that had happened early in the week because they had
had more time to attract user interactions. She also questioned some aspects of methodology
employed by the analyst. For example, she did not particularly agree with the analysts way
of dealing with Facebook data. When ranking the popularity of Facebook posts, the analyst
assigned the highest weight to the number of comments as the most complex interaction and the
lowest  to the number of likes as the least complex interaction. According to the producer, this
was not always the best idea:
Theres one thing I wasnt that happy with. [...] The weighting [the analyst] gave to
things on Facebook that had comments, I thought it was too much. [...] If something
was commented on Facebook, it got more points, [...] while I think this whole chart
should be about quantity not quality of interaction. [...] I thought that it was a bit
disproportionate. Like, sometimes a Facebook video that had been viewed, I dont
know, a thousand times was really high in the chart, but actually, it wasnt... You
know, sometimes you can get a bit of a gut instinct of this as well? I just didnt feel
like it was.
Overall, she confessed to questioning one or two stories on the chart each week, although
in massive quantities  not that often. Interestingly, it does not mean that her trust in data
was much lower than for the first producer. As the show progressed, it changed from a bit
skeptical to critical to quite trusting to very trusting  yet, the latter was achieved not
though accepting the trust in the data as a necessary prerequisite, but through getting to know
the data and [...] the outliers, so that the data could be efficiently understood and quality assured
and the chart could better represent the reality of online discussions around news and topical
stories:
I think we should be allowed to use our brain to discard those [erroneous chart
entries]. [...] You need a brain looking at this, you couldnt just go with this. [...]
When youre making something journalistically and for a programme, you should be
able to speak to [a] person. [...] It wasnt necessary that [the analyst] would change
things [when the production team questioned them], but [the analyst] would explain
why the things were the way they were.
96 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
This is a very different line of thinking compared to that of the first producer, but it can be
seen how it is equally intolerant to making fixes to the chart simply to satisfy the agenda of the
production team and to allow for easier production work.
3.3.5.2 Using chart spreadsheets
Another important vehicle of trust into data was the way the weekly charts were distributed
by the analyst. As mentioned before, the analyst used to collate a weekly chart in a Google
spreadsheet. They would subsequently distribute the chart to the production team by sharing a
link to this spreadsheet with the team members. Each spreadsheet had four tabs  one for the
overall chart and one for each of the 4 contributing platforms minus Twitter. The Twitter tab was
missing since collating a Twitter chat required more work and was done in a separate workbench
specifically developed for the job.
The overall chart tab contained a list of approximately the top-100 topics from the data. This was
somewhat generous considering that only the top-40 topics were presented in the programme,
but sometimes this longer list allowed to produce an interesting bubbling under feature  a
short segment that occasionally aired at the beginning of the Hit List and talked about one story
that the production team particularly liked but that did not make it into the top-40. The longer
chart could also sometimes help the producers to predict which of the stories would make it
into the top-40 next time. This was especially relevant during the Friday team meetings since it
allowed to better prepare for Sunday. Finally, the extended list of stories could also help with
trusting the data  if a producer expected some story to be in the top-40 but did not see it there,
they could look down the list and make sure that the story was not simply forgotten or discarded
by mistake, but rather simply did not make the main chart.
If a chart entry trended on Facebook and/or YouTube, it had a link to the either a relevant
popular Facebook post or a YouTube video. The chart entries coming from Twitter or Google
Trends, unfortunately, did not have a particular piece of content attached. The more detailed
platform-wise tabs allowed to see all the search terms, videos and Facebook posts that went into
each charting topics. Both of the interviewed analysts said they had periodically used those to
familiarise themselves with the topic and to find inspiration for potential angles of covering each
story. Moreover, in the latter months of producing the Hit List, even if the producers did not have
time to study those additional tabs themselves, they would periodically ask me to investigate
those they had doubts about. As such, the spreadsheet was a very useful tool for data mediation,
which of course also helped with establishing trust in the data.
While the spreadsheet interface was quite simplistic, it proved to be sufficient for the vast
majority of cases where further examination of data was required. The most clear exception was
3.3. PRODUCTION OF HIT LIST SHOW FOR BBC RADIO 5 LIVE 97
examination of Twitter data. The detailed breakdown for those data was available for everyone in
the team through a web application that was hosted on the data science teams server. However,
since looking at the Twitter breakdown was only required infrequently and since the interface
of the web-application was not the most user-friendly, in practice the production team always
found it easier to ask either the analyst or me to have a look at it. Other than providing an easier
interface to examine Twitter data, the producers only ever mentioned one feature that could have
been a useful addition for them to further study the data: timeline graphs of user interactions
with various topics. Those could be helpful to search for what was happening outside social
media just before the peaks of user interactions and potentially to combat the aforementioned
beginning-of-the-week bias.
3.3.6 Findings 4. Production Treatment: Turning Data into Radio
The Hit List chart was an unusual format to work with from a production standpoint. First of all,
it presented the challenge of turning the stories that the producers would not normally pick up
themselves into engaging pieces for radio. Second, the sheer format of a weekly news chart was
challenging in its own right. It implied that in 3 days (from Friday to Sunday) the team had to
deal with more than 40 stories, some of which were bound to fall off of the final chart, while
others were known only on the day the programme went on air. One of the interviewed producers
explains that she welcomed this challenge because and that she believed the format of the Hit
List was genius and unlike anything she had heard of prior to the show. According to her, its
an easy way to deliver social media area of interest to somebody who doesnt necessarily know
enough about it.
The below discussion outlines what the production- and the wider Hit List team do to realise the
potential of the shows format and to extract the most journalistic value out of the data.
3.3.6.1 Developing feature stories
The format and the content of the Hit List posed some challenges for developing feature stories.
Occasionally, it was difficult to present a story without giving a glimpse of the original piece of
online content behind it. As the online content is consumed on screens of computers and mobile
devices, it is predominantly visual and not easily transmittable via radio. This was especially
problematic for YouTube videos, since their dynamic was not always easy to capture through
paraphrasing the content. Quite often, the producer would include an audio snippet from a video
into the script. The snippets had to be selected strategically so that they did not require the
accompanying picture to be appreciated.
98 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
However, according to both interviewed producers, in most cases the process of developing a
feature story was not significantly different for Hit List compared to any other radio show they
had worked on, as the best way to communicate a story was still to have an excellent guest (either
as an actual studio guest or as a telephone interviewee) who would be able to deliver value to
the audience in a short time frame allowed for one feature. One of the interviewed producers
believed that an initial list of weekly stories and the guests were of fifty-fifty importance to
how good an episode of the Hit List was deemed to be. The other producer elaborates:
[The feature stories] are just stories, this is no[t] difficult. The transference of
information to radio is about storytelling. [...] Small introduction, really good guests
who are relevant to the story, preferably someone in the story. [...] And keep it
short.
Because of that, when choosing a particular angle for covering a story in the forthcoming
show, the team was rarely concerned whether the angle was suggested by the underlying data 
although, as shown above, the data did occasionally inspire the choice. The primary concern of
the production team was who could be a good telephone interviewee and how to approach them.
A secondary, yet still important, concern was whether the show presenter and the planned studio
guest would be comfortable contributing to the discussion. For example, one week the Making
a Murderer drama series was trending. The producers did not expect the shows presenter to
have prior knowledge of the series, so they decided to invite the showss producers who would
be capable of providing an introduction to the series.
3.3.6.2 Managing timescales
The tight deadlines of the radio production environment required the production workflow to
be significantly optimised. In fact, workflow optimisation started already at the data processing
stage. For example, the data analyst, by their own admission, had to start the heavy initial data
processing jobs the very first thing after waking up on Friday and Sunday accordingly. Those
jobs included filtering out non-UK tweets, reduction of tweets to their hashtags and collating
YouTube and Google Trends. Such a schedule was a compromise in that the data used for chart
collation were not as fresh as possible  they only covered the time period until the end of the
previous day. However, it guaranteed that the analyst would be able to start data analysis as early
as possible in the morning and that therefore the chart would be ready before the production
team meeting.
The production team employed its own methods to meet the deadlines. As each producer
specialised in a set of topics for which they had a wide contact network, a weekly editor
3.3. PRODUCTION OF HIT LIST SHOW FOR BBC RADIO 5 LIVE 99
sometimes had to factor the amount of work one producers could realistically do into their
decision on which topics to develop into features. It was not uncommon to hear them say
something like I do not want to create extra work when there is already enough during the
team meetings. Balancing the producers workload helped with both managing the timescales
and securing the diversity of topics discussed on the show. It is worth noting that despite all
the efforts made, the producers sometimes had to work on their supposedly free day (Saturday),
especially when they aimed to secure guests from other time zones.
The timescales also limited the production teams ability to brief the shows presenter over the
content of the topic. It was once observed on a Sunday how the shows editor was briefing the
presenter while she was in a taxi on her way to BBC Broadcasting House. One of the interviewed
producers claimed that they usually started briefing the presenter on Friday. Given such tight
conditions and the variety and unpredictability of topics covered in Hit List, sometimes the given
briefing was insufficient. Partly for this reason, the show had to be tightly scripted. The script
specified the monologues that the presenter should read to introduce the topic and suggested
the questions for the interview, although the presenter was free to adapt those to the flow of the
conversation. Moreover, an episode script specified technical details such as when to say the
shows catchphrases and when to press buttons to start appropriate pre-recorded segments and
jingles. To make sure that the presenter had all the information she needed, some words in the
script were even written phonetically. For example, for a story on trichotillomania  a medical
condition that creates the urge to pull ones own hair out  the name of the condition was spelled
as Tricho - tillo - mania in the script. This level of detail was imperative for the production of
a show to appropriate journalistic standards.
Finally, the limited time could be a driver behind the very rare  yet still occurring  instances
of tweaking the chart. Sometimes a topic that had been in the primary version of a chart on
Friday dropped off the chart by Sunday. There was one case when a producer had found a very
good interviewee for such a topic on Friday evening. The team had to use their discretion to
nonetheless include that topic as the number 40 into the hit list at the expense of the least newsy
that was meant to be on the chart that week. This was one of the rare cases when the staying
true to the data ethos was overruled by the purpose of making a good entertaining show, the
time limits and the reluctance to waste prior effort.
3.3.7 Summary: Key Lessons
Studying the production of the Hit List show has provided deep insights into the process of
social data science in the non-academic context of data journalism. In this setting, the pragmatic
considerations often outweigh those of doing science in the strict sense of the word. This does
100 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
not mean that the findings of this case study are not applicable to the more traditional research
settings: similar pragmatic considerations exist in any project, as no one operates with unlimited
time and resources. Rather, the Hit List case allows to examine these considerations under
a magnifying lense of nationwide radio broadcasting. In addition, even when practicalities
prevailed, one should not underestimate the amount and complexity of the analytical work
that went into the Hit List production and the insights that can be gathered from studying it as
well, especially since the experience of the project raises many points on the role of human-
and machine data analysis and processing in social data science. The following points briefly
summarise the key findings of the case study into lessons for social data science projects:
1. In social data science, algorithmic and human data processing may intertwine in different
configurations. While the traditional view of a research process often assumes more
human-driven analysis on the initial exploratory steps and more reliance on automated
data processing later down the research pipeline, these two stages may come in reverse
order  e.g., automated data processing being used to prepare the data for subsequent manual
analysis. Moreover, since the results of manual analysis can also inform the automated data
processing on subsequent research iterations, effectively a collaborative human-machine
data processing loop may emerge. The exact proportions and roles of human- and algorithm
involvement should be shaped by project circumstances.
2. Given the notion above, a social data science team should be clear not only about the research
questions that they aim to answer, but also about the ultimate goals of their work, which
stakeholder needs they aim to satisfy and how this relates to the artefacts of the research
work. These parameters are crucial for trading off the priorities for the project such as the
comprehensiveness of the research, its rigour, timeliness of delivery and the need to produce
results serving the intended purpose for the stakeholders given constraints on available data
and research methods. Basic operationalisations such as what is newsy content or what is
UK content have to be made with practical purposes in mind as there is no gold standard
for how they should be made. This is a problem that is not uncommon in the social sciences
that basic assumptions and operationalisations are contested (Jarvie, 2011; McIntyre and
Rosenberg, 2017).
3. When acquiring data from different sources, a social data science team has to consider that
even if the underlying processes that produce the data (e.g. platform users sharing/liking
content) and the internal representations of those within the sources are comparable, the
sources may return this data to a researcher through different modes of access, thus leading to
a variation in the levels to which data are pre-cooked  aggregated, filtered and otherwise
processed. These differences have to be factored into any comparative analyses or subsequent
3.3. PRODUCTION OF HIT LIST SHOW FOR BBC RADIO 5 LIVE 101
data aggregation.
4. The research questions answered in social data projects may not necessarily have a specific
correct answer. In the Hit List production, such questions may be relatively innocent 
what stories to consider topical and where to draw boundaries between two topic  but this
is not always the case. A social data science team should remember that an absence of a
specific correct answer is inherent to such questions  not to the methods of answering them.
This notion challenges the false assumption that the answers derived algorithmically are
more objective than the ones derived through human judgement and thus frees the team
from a perceived need to develop purely algorithmic solutions at any cost.
5. If a social data science team wants to develop a machine learning algorithm  for example,
text classification  it is crucial for the team members to consider what they would themselves
rely on when solving the task they plan to delegate to a machine, especially which prior
assumptions and knowledge they would employ. This can help not only with choosing the
specific details of an algorithm (e.g. feature selection), but also with a bigger picture of
the algorithm design  e.g. whether a task should be posed as a purely unsupervised one or
whether it might have supervised components.
6. If a certain research task gets performed routinely by a certain member (or group of members)
within a social data science team, over time some this process may effectively get black-
boxed from the rest of the team through forgetting. This forgetting did not produce significant
negative consequences for the Hit List production, but in other research settings it might: for
example, some team members may misinterpret a pattern observed in data as a substantial
finding whereas it is actually a product of prior data manipulations performed by other team
members. From the Hit List experience, having whole-team meetings and team members
who work closely with different sub-teams helps with overcoming such forgetting.
7. In interdisciplinary teams, technical specialists often systematically work on processing
the data while the substantive field specialists only employ high-level data representations
(be that for substantive interpretation, journalistic treatment or other purposes). This may
disconnect the field specialists from the data and hinder their trust in the data. To restore this
trust  and also to facilitate meaningful critique of the data  the technical specialists should
provide the field specialists with data overviews that allow zooming into particular bits of
evidence and moving to lower layers of abstraction when required. The Hit List experience
shows the effectiveness of a multi-tab spreadsheet interface for these needs, but the exact
choice is likely to be project-dependent.
102 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
8. The Hit List production teams ethos of staying true to the data when collating the list of
stories for a weekly show and then relying on their own journalistic experience rather than
the content of online discussions to determine an angle to cover each story from illustrates
that the final artefacts of a social data science endeavour may transcend the pure research
outputs and may be informed both by the undertaken research and through other means. A
social data science team has to decide how exactly their artefacts should incorporate the
research findings.
The experience of the Hit List production case study, in combination with that of the Shakespeare
Lives evaluation project, provides the bulk of the evidence used to inform the project management
tool for social data science. However, there are still selected project aspects  most notably, that
of ethical and legal compliance  for which additional observations are valuable. The following
section briefly discusses two other social data science projects that were studied for this thesis.
3.4. ADDITIONAL FIELDWORK EVIDENCE 103
3.4 Additional Fieldwork Evidence
This short section discusses the social data science projects that provide evidence for some
specific aspects of the designed project management tool rather than systematically for the tool
as a whole. As a consequence, they are given a brief coverage. The first one of them  the
evaluation project for the InfoMigrants initiative  is very similar in nature and in the work
involved to the Shakespeare Lives evaluation project (see Sections 3.2). A full discussion of the
project would thus be a bit redundant, while some specific observations are of high relevance.
The second one  the study of resilience of Dark Net hosted cybercriminal marketplaces  is only
discussed briefly here because the primary role of this project was not to inform the designed
project management tool but to evaluate it. A more detailed discussion of the project can be
found in Section 5.2.
3.4.1 Evaluation of InfoMigrants Initiative
As mentioned in the Shakespeare Lives case study (see Section 3.2), the research projects team
leader has a long track record of collaborations with cultural- and media organisations. Running
evaluation projects like the one our team performed for the British Council is business-as-usual
for her. Therefore, it would not be surprising for a reader that soon after completing the work
on Shakespeare Lives, she started to assemble the team for a new evaluation project  this time,
for InfoMigrants: a multi-platform news and information resource for those seek asylum in the
European Union or are in the process of migration to the EU (Gillespie, 2017). InfoMigrants is a
collective effort of three international media organisations  France Mldias Monde, Deutsche
Welle and ANSA  that delivers its content through a multi-language website and a number of
public Facebook pages, Twitter accounts and WhatsApp channels.
The circumstances of the InfoMigrants case mirrored that of Shakespeare Lives in many respects.
Not only did the project have similar objectives (such as the Cultural Value assessment, see
Section 3.2.1.2) and employed some of the same data sources (e.g. Facebook public pages, see
Section 3.2.4.1) and analysis methods (such as content analysis and online ethnography, see
Section 3.2.5)  the teams of the two projects also had four people in common (aside from the
PI and myself, another investigator and the lead qualitative analyst). The relationships with the
key stakeholder (InfoMigrants being simultaneously a funder and a subject of the evaluation,
see Section 3.2.3) were the same. Due to this overlap, many observations made during the two
project overlap. Such purely congruent observations are not discussed in this section, although
some of them are mentioned directly when discussing the contents of the designed project
management tool (see Section 4.3). However, the InfoMigrants evaluation case study did bring
some qualitatively new insights that came from the benchmarking excercise (as our team got
104 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
to call this process), which is discussed below.
3.4.1.1 Benchmarking exercise: introduction
As outlined in Section 3.2.5.3, one of the greatest challenges in the Shakespeare Lives evaluation
project was lack of benchmarks  i.e. other similarly scoped international cultural programmes
 to compare the programmes performance with. Therefore, when assessing the level of the
programmes success, the project team had to construct baseline expectations rather than infer
them from the data. While the team succeed in doing that, additional assumptions had to be
made and the analysis required careful comparison of performances of the programmes own
events across different countries and events, which was often non-trivial. Overall, the lack of
benchmarks was something that arguably everyone on the team would have preferred to avoid if
there had been a chance.
The issue of benchmarking arose again in the InfoMigrants evaluation project, but this time there
was more that we could do. To begin with, the representatives of InfoMigrants provided us (as
well as the funding organisations) with target values for several key quantitative indicators of
online success such as the number of website visits and reach on social media platforms (cf.
Stephen et al., 2015). For most modes of quantitative analysis, our team used exactly those
figures as the benchmarks. However, in an attempt to further increase the rigour of our research,
we decided to complement our core analysis with some form of external comparison of the
InfoMigrants performance  even though, given the modest resources of the project, that had to
be done on a limited scale. Conducting this piece of research raised several interesting issues,
especially in relation to research design and data acquisition.
3.4.1.2 Designing the exercise
From the research design perspective (cf. De Vaus, 2001), the benchmarking exercise required
our team to obtain comparable data on online performance of comparable entities, i.e. other
initiative groups, organisations and campaigns that provided information support to asylum
seekers and migrants from economically disadvantaged territories and that operated in the same
languages as InfoMigrants. As some of the analysts of the team had prior knowledge of the
field, identifying a long list of candidate peers for InfoMigrants was relatively straight-forward.
However, upon closer examination, all of them differed from InfoMigrants in one or more
fundamental ways:
 Many peers targeted narrower groups of migrants and asylum seekers (e.g. those in refugee
camps specifically in Greece);
3.4. ADDITIONAL FIELDWORK EVIDENCE 105
 Many peers offered information to migrants as part (and often as a by-product) of other
services (e.g. help in getting asylum);
 Some peers did not only have offline presence in addition to the online one (which
InfoMigrants did not), but specialised on offline activity (e.g. on volunteering in the refugee
camps);
 Some peers, who, like InfoMigrants, distributed information in several languages, did not keep
their presence in different languages separate (e.g. InfoMigrants had a different Facebook
page for each language, while others would post in multiple languages).
This dimensions of variability could influence the differences in online performance of
InfoMigrants and its peers. For example, one may expect a long, sustained engagement (and
thus repeated interactions) with an organisation that offers direct help to specific migrants and
refugees that would come from those who receive the help. This is quite different compared to the
sporadic engagement often observed in the media sector. Our team dealt with these discrepancies
in two ways. First, using formal (a non-zero intersection in the proposed mission of a candidate
benchmark peer and that of InfoMigrants) and informal (expert judgement of the team members)
criteria, we shortlisted a fraction of InfoMigrants peers for whom the online performance data
were to be analysed. Second, for each short-listed organisation we provided our stakeholders
with a summary that highlighted their differences with InfoMigrants and included appropriate
caveats while reporting on our analysis, thus accounting for potential sources of performance
discrepancies.
3.4.1.3 Data availability
Our proximity to InfoMigrants provided us with elevated access to their online performance
data  some of those data could be obtained from the administrators of their website and of their
social media profiles, while others  from their marketing team who used commercial analytical
software focused on internal evaluations. While these data were of great help for the bulk of
our teams research, most of those data were of little value for the benchmarking exercise since
comparable data on the InfoMigrants peers could not be obtained with this tool set. Our team
could only rely on publicly available benchmark data. For example, this implied discarding such
a crucial measure of InfoMigrants success as website visits, since only crude estimates of that
metric such as an approximate Alexa Ranking17 without elevated access to some proprietary
data.
17For example, see https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/infomigrants.net
https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/infomigrants.net
106 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
After much consideration, it was decided to focus the benchmarking exercise specifically on
the Facebook engagement. With the exception of the website itself, the Facebook presence
was the one into which InfoMigrants invested by far the most efforts and resources. Moreover,
specifically with Facebook, our team was confident in our ability to estimate one of the key
success metrics from publicly available data: engagement (cf. Stephen et al., 2015) of individual
posts on the Facebook public pages  i.e. a number of interactions Facebook users make with a
post. We could operationalise this metric as a summation of reactions, comments and shares that
a post had received  something observable through Facebooks user interface and accessible
programmatically through the Facebooks Graph API  the publicly available programming
interface for reading and writing Facebook Data 18.
It is worth mentioning that our initial plan was to only use the publicly available routes to access
the benchmark pages data, since a more convenient (and allegedly at least as complete) access
to the post engagement data for InfoMigrants was available with Facebook Insights  a set of
monitoring tools that Facebook provided to administrators of its public pages (cf. Spiliopoulou
et al., 2014). However, the Insights data appeared to be inconsistent with those available publicly,
with the interaction metrics received through Facebook Insights being systematically higher. To
the best of our knowledge, Facebook had never documented the definitive source of this disparity.
However, our sporadic observations suggested that the engagement metrics obtainable through
Facebook Insights were strictly non-decreasing and thus arguably represented all interactions a
post had ever received, while the publicly available ones represented only the currently active
post engagement  i.e. these metrics would decrease if someone, say, removed their like or a
comment. Thus, for a fair comparison, it was instrumental to treat the InfoMigrants own public
pages the same way as the benchmark sample and to acquire the respective data using the same
methods.
3.4.1.4 Data acquisition
Given the set-up of the benchmarking exercise, it was a straightforward decision to develop a
web application that would connect to the Facebook Graph API to acquire the data. Compared to
scraping, it was more reliable and returned data in a conveniently structured JSON format that
did not require much post-processing. The practice of using the Graph API for research had
also been well-established over the years of the APIs existence. There were only two practical
limitations. First, the same data were available to a developer through the API and through
the user interface  so, for example, no data from users who had hidden their profiles from
non-friends could be accessed. Second, judging from my prior experience, after a number of
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview
3.4. ADDITIONAL FIELDWORK EVIDENCE 107
consecutive requests the Graph API tended to start delaying its response. Therefore, the time
required to obtain a dataset grew faster than the datasets size19. Both limitations were acceptable
for the benchmarking purposes, since only a limited number of organisational public pages were
studied.
Our data collection application successfully acquired data through the Graph API for the first
round of benchmarking exercise in late 2017. However, in spring 2018, when the application
was used again, the Graph API only returned error messages instead of data. As it turned out,
on March 21, 2018 Facebook put access to the platforms data via the API on hold, unless the
requested data belonged to a Facebook user who had used the data collecting web application
in the past three months (Xu, 2018; Facebook, 2018a). This condition arose from the default
scenario that Facebook implied for the use of the Graph API: i.e. developing applications that
allowed third party web-services to leverage their user interactions by connecting to a users
Facebook profile. Examples of such enhancements might include providing a sign in with
Facebook functionality or providing a customer with promotional deals in exchange of posting
something on their Facebook timeline. All such interactions require explicit interactions between
a Facebook user and the third-party web-app. Thus, the Facebooks decision effectively rendered
research-purposed data collection through the Graph API temporarily impossible20  unless
the research was done privately by an entity that had active app users. Facebooks decision
was motivated by the then-recent scandal around the Cambridge Analytica data leakage and
seemed quite surprising to our team. Indeed, even if restricting API access to the individual
users data could be considered consequential to the scandal, this was at least questionable for
the organisational public pages data, especially given that such pages often explicitly sought
wider exposure and access to their content.
While this posed difficulties for our research it also taught us an important lesson about data
acquisition: one should be not operate under an implicit assumption that a publicly available
method of data collection would remain accessible indefinitely in the future. Relaxing this
assumption means approaching data acquisition strategically, planning the data needs ahead and
trying to collect data as soon as they get available rather than when the research actually calls for
them.
Overall, the InfoMigrants evaluation project improved our teams understanding of the issues
related to designing social data science studies, dealing with inconsistencies of different
19To the best of my knowledge, this was never officially documented or tested.
20In May 2018 Facebook announced launch of a new version of the Graph API that required web application to
through a review process in order to access Facebook data; it is worth noting that no specific procedure for reviewing
academic apps was provided (Papamiltiadis, 2018). Later Krishna (2018) reported that Facebook had put additional
restrictions on data access again.
108 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
representations of the same data and planning data acquisition routines, all of which is valuable
for designing the project management tool for social data science.
3.4.2 Study of the Criminal Marketplaces on Dark Net
The final social data science project that I observed and participated in as part of the work on
this thesis focused on studying the socio-economic structures of cyber-criminal marketplaces 
online platforms that facilitated trade in illicit goods (hereinafter I will refer to it as the Dark Net
project or the Dark Net study).
The case study was conducted when the vast majority of the project management tool for social
data science had already been informed and completed. Hence, its primary role was not in
informing the project management tool but in providing formative evaluation of the tools first
version. These two roles were kept as separate as possible. The evaluation was performed
through a series of project management sessions where the project investigators and I used
the designed tool to track progress and plan further activities. During those session, we only
superficially discussed those project aspects for which prior fieldwork evidence was lacking.
By contrast, to inform the missing bits of the project management tool, I used observations of
routine work on the project and of those team meetings that did not involve the use of the tool 
specifically of the meeting dedicated to the issues of ethics and compliance, as those were the
least well-informed issues covered by the project management tool at that moment. In inevitable
rare cases when one exercise did affect the other, appropriate cross-references are provided.
The evaluation is discussed in Section 5.2 after the project management tool and its content are
properly introduced (see Chapter 4). That section also provides a more thorough introduction
to the projects background and setup, while the discussion below touches specifically on the
primary evidence collected to inform the tool.
3.4.2.1 Ethics and compliance: introduction
Of all the studied research project, the Dark Net case study dealt with the the most sensitive
subject matter: we were planning to study evidence of criminal activities. Hence, it is hardly
surprising that this project raised the largest number of compliance considerations. The following
discussion touches on many of them and shows how they postulated on the levels of both strategic
considerations that were almost philosophical in nature and concrete practices that had to be
adopted.
3.4. ADDITIONAL FIELDWORK EVIDENCE 109
3.4.2.2 Stakeholder interests and ethics of cyber-criminal marketplace research
Most typical ethical problems in social research are related to securing interests- and managing
risks of the research subjects and participants  these are the main topics covered in standard
ethics textbooks (cf. Diener and Crandall, 1978). In studies of criminal communities, this implies
considering the interests of criminal groups. This may seem to be a futile endeavour since
criminals are arguably expected to oppose any attempts at research into their activities. However,
in reality there are criminal communities who tolerate and even foster such research. For example,
the BlueLight online forum for users of drugs, including the illegal ones21, has a Drug Studies
subforum22. This subforum is a platform for the researchers in the field to disseminate their
findings and to recruit participants for further studies.
In the case of criminal marketplaces, it is arguably more difficult to design research that would
be tolerable for platform participants since distribution of illicit goods is usually considered
to be a more serious crime than possession or use. Furthermore, various groups of platform
participants have different reasons to participate which can lead to different attitudes towards
research (Martin and Christin, 2016). That said, some of the previous research into criminal
marketplaces performed by the Dark Net projects PI, Dr Angus Bancroft (cf. Bancroft and Reid,
2016), was hardly harmful for the markets. It focused on the ways market participants engaged
in discussions on the associated forum of one of such marketplaces and did not attempt any
analysis that could contribute to revealing the market participants identities or to anyhow else
disrupt their operations. In line with the practice suggested by Barratt (2011), Dr Bancroft even
attempted to contact the market administration for a permission to collect data  and even though
he did not get any response, his attempt shows how firmly he believed in acceptance of his study
by the illicit trade community.
That being said, the Dark Net project was funded by an ESRC Impact Grant and its declared
impact component was in establishing collaboration with a law enforcement body. Although in
practice communication with this law enforcement body was minimal, it was still recognised as
the projects key stakeholder. Balancing between satisfying the key stakeholders interests and
staying ethical towards the market actors thus became a major challenge for the project.
Strategically, the challenge was resolved through the recognition that striving for overall harm
reduction was something that law enforcement and market participants might all agree on, even if
the operationalisation of this notion might differ between these two broad groups  and, actually,
within the groups as well. This recognition and the according shift in the research focus was
largely a product of using the Scorecard Deck and is thus discussed later in the thesis (see Section

5.2.1). However, our developed stance can be summarised as follows:
 Our project is a response to the low efficiency of usual law enforcement interventions in
a form of either shutting down a particular cyber-criminal market place or capturing and
incarceration of significant market players (administrators or big vendors). Such interventions
are focused on disrupting the online trade in illicit goods, but manage to do so only for a very
short term and do not lead to harm reduction.
 While the shift of illegal trade to the online sphere may have negative consequences (making
the illicit goods more available than before), it may also be a vehicle for harm reduction by
reducing street violence and providing customers with fuller information about the purchased
goods.
 Ergo, our research should help the law enforcement- and other professional bodies with
designing and executing alternative types of interventions that would attempt to steer the
trade in illicit goods into a less harmful direction. Such interventions may be disruptive for
specific criminal activities (such as selling impure or otherwise overly dangerous drugs), but
not necessarily for ordinary market participants such as buyers of drugs for personal use.
One decision that we had to make was concerned with dealing with data that revealed identities
of market participants. In principle, such data were not expected to be found. Judging by prior
evidence found by Bancroft and Reid (2016), criminal market actors tend to be technologically
and otherwise savvy and take the required precautions to retain their anonymity. However, there
were known cases of such mistakes  in fact, one of them had led to identification and subsequent
capture of Alexandre Cazes, the creator of one of then-biggest cyber-criminal marketplaces
AlphaBay (Bellemare, 2017).
Given the overarching ethical stance of our team, it was easy for us to decide to discard and
immediately delete any data that were known to potentially disclose the participant identities
 unless those were of the types that we would be obliged by law to report on. What seems
interesting though is that, in my prior experience of clear net research (be that a study of social
media- or any other user-generated data), I had never been involved in making a decision on
this matter  even though nothing guarantees an absence of unexpected disclosures in the clear
net data. The issue of such disclosures is well-known in traditional social research  Guillemin
and Gillam (2004) even argue that it is the primary source of ethical dilemmas. Yet, in modern
research branches this issue still seems under-appreciated. This highlights the importance of
considering the existing traditions of ethics thought in wider disciplinary context when doing
social data science.
3.4. ADDITIONAL FIELDWORK EVIDENCE 111
Another aspect that we had to decide upon was that of research consent. We rejected the idea of
contacting marketplace actors or administration for permissions to scrape their data, as, given the
involvement of law enforcement, we did not feel that we could actually create trust relationship
between us and the market  not to mention that it relieved us of potential legal concerns
associated with contacting criminals. Besides, Martin and Christin (2016) argue that a consent
for scraping marketplace data is meaningful only if it is received from all actors whose data are
scraped. This renders recieving such consent practically impossible. In the absence of participant
consent, we also decided to only scrape data from the publicly accessible marketplaces  i.e. the
ones that did not require invitations to join. While we could attempt to obtain such an invitation,
we recognised that participants of closed markets may have reasonable expectations of privacy
(Crowther, 2012). Thus, scraping data from such markets without consent would violate our
internal ethical standards. By contrast, with publicly accessible marketplaces, it seems fair to
assume that the market actors would anticipate scraping attempts to be made at least by law
enforcement  compared to that, any academic data collection should be of marginal concern to
them.
3.4.2.3 Management of researcher risks
Given the nature of Dark Net research, our team also had to develop procedures to manage the
risk for the researchers. Indeed, the discussion above shows that the cyber-criminal marketplace
administration should anticipate attempts of data scraping from actors with competing interests 
first and foremost, law enforcement bodies, but also maybe competing marketplaces. Therefore,
there is no reason to assume that markets would not try to defend themselves against scrapers,
including in the form of counterattacks. The most straightforward of such counterattackes
would be to attempt making the scraping machines executing malicious code to disrupt the
scraping process. Even worse would be something harmful for the technological infrastructure
of the project as a whole  e.g. something disruptive on a level of the organisational network. In
the worst case scenario, the malicious code may help the marketplace to reveal the identities of
the scrapers and provide them with means for personal retaliation. This implies the importance
of protecting the scraping machine against being compromised  but also of protection of the rest
of the project infrastructure and of the researchers identities in the case the scraping machine
does get compromised.
To respond to such risks, we used several layers of protection. As an initial layer of protection,
we accessed the scraped web-pages through a Tor browser with JavaScript turned off, so that
the pages we visited could not trigger malicious client-side code to be executed. This is a
fairly standard practice on Dark Net; from our research experience, most of the marketplaces
do not have dynamic content to start with specifically to make the websites usable without
112 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
JavaScript. As an additional layer of protection, we developed and executed our scraping code on
an anonymous remote machine hosted in the Google Cloud. We adhered to a policy not to store
any personal identifiers there. For example, we never actually pushed changes to the scraping
code directly from the Google Cloud machine to a BitBucket repository that we used for version
control and code management  rather, we first triggered a secure copy of the code on a server at
the University of St Andrews from the Google Cloud machine to that server. To further protect
outselves, we stored all the data on the same server and analysed them remotely.
It is interesting to observe that, while anonymising connections through Tor was necessary from
the start as the marketplaces were not accessible outside of the Tor network, we also came to
rely on it for managing our own risk as researchers. We extended this even to scraping clear net
websites such as Deep Dot Web23  a portal that posts news about illicit goods and their trade,
lists hyperlinks to the Dark Net marketplaces and provides a discussion space for those. As Deep
Dot Web by itself is not a platform for conducting criminal activity  only for discussing it  it is
made accessible outside the Tor Network. Still, as our risk management practices prescribed
hiding our identities from the administrators of scraped websites, we still used the Tor network
for this  even though using it slowed down the connection.
Another risk that we had to protect ourselves against was accidentally scraping data that would
by themselves be illegal. While this risk, as much as the risk of accidental disclosures discussed
above, could not be eliminated, we did take some measures to minimise it. For example, we
specifically did not scrape any visual content since that could depict illegal scenes. Additionally,
we did not scrape marketplaces or forums that dealt with specifically sensitive product categories
such as weapons.
A final point that has to be made is that our identities would still have to be revealed should
we ever publish our work (or about our work, as is done in this thesis). What allowed us to
feel comfortable with this risk was, again, the overall ethical stance of our team and a lack of
desire to fundamentally disrupt criminal marketplace operations. In our assessment, our intent
would not be evident from the process of data collection, but would be from the published
results. Additionally, we considered the experience of previous research that had not shown
cyber-criminal marketplace actors to be unhappy with research into their activities (Bancroft and
Reid, 2016). Yet, this example reminds us that some risks cannot even be significantly minised 
it is only possible to account for them and to make an informed decision on whether to accept
them or not.

3.4.2.4 Institutional ramifications
While the discussion above focuses on the substantive concerns that our team had to address, we
also had to comply with the formal policies and procedures of our universities. As shown below,
those proved to add a layer of complexity and gave an impression that the UK institutions are
still ill-equipped at regulating conduct in social data science.
Any ethical review at the University of St Andrews starts with filling it an Ethics Application
Form. This form is standardised across all academic schools and types of research projects
with an exception of the projects that pose risks not only for humans (e.g. the projects that
involve animal testing). Applying such a standardised form to the Dark Net project (and arguably
many other social data science projects) was sometimes problematic. For example, most of
the questions were formulated in such terms as project participants, locations of research
and others that were not really applicable to mass-scale online data collection, but to traditional
research. As a result, we decided to leave many questions without an answer and to provide
a several-page long free-form ethical statement instead. While the ethical complexity of the
Dark Net project would oblige us to provide us with some free-form statement anyway, it could
arguably be cut in short quite significantly if there was a better-suited form to begin with  not to
mention that the decision to leave questions without a response also came with hesitation and
thus took some time to be made.
Another instance when the institutional policies appeared to be ill-equipped for our project
revealed itself when, after the initial ethics review, our team was recommended to run the data
acquisition code on a specific universitys web server that was delegated for Dark Net research.
This suggestion went against our ideas of protecting the project- (and the wider university-
) infrastructure by acquiring data on a virtual Google Cloud machine. As it appeared, the
universitys policy had been tailored for a particular type of Dark Net research  terrorism studies.
The usual methods of such research do not include massive data collection and thus do not
cause a high risk of counterattacks from the studied Dark Net platforms. On the other hand, the
data that are acquired in such studies are often illegal to be in possession of  thus, by obliging
its staff to use a specific university machine for terrorism data collection, the University of St
Andrews makes sure that the researchers, in the case of suspicions from the law enforcement,
have a chance to make the case of collecting the data for professional use. As can be seen, the
circumstances of our study were significantly different to that in terrorism research. Luckily, the
university proved to be sufficiently flexible to recognise this difference in circumstances and
allow us to adhere to the plan. However, if we had known about this university policy in advance,
we could have included this bit into our ethical statement from the start and thus potentially get
an approval earlier.
114 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
3.4.2.5 Learning about compliance
As a brief final piece of commentary, the compliance issues raised by this project were not
only multidimensional  for our team, many of them were novel. Of us all, only the principal
investigator had substantive prior experience in researching the Dark Net (cf. Bancroft and
Reid, 2016). Moreover, his prior research in this area only employed traditional sociological
methods that could not raise the issues associated with large-scale data acquisition and were better
governed by the existing traditions of research ethics overall. The generic social data science
experience that the computer scientists on the team had, as well as their prior limited work on
compliance (cf. Ethics and legal compliance in Voss et al., 2016), could partially compensate
for that. However, there were still questions of the possible interactions between these two
sources of compliance issues: our team lacked a framework to think about the compliance
systematically and to communicate our stance to the hosting universities. A remedy came in the
form of the paper by Martin and Christin (2016) on ethics in cryptomarket research. It discussed
four dimensions of the Dark Net research ethics thus helping us to shape our thinking on ethics
and the corresponding ethical statetemnt into a self-consistent and comprehensive form. As
such, it helped us cope with our known unknowns in ethics of crypromarket research (i.e. the
issues we understood we had but were not entirely sure how to cope with). It also exposed us to
our unknown unknowns. For example, prior to reading the paper we had not quite recognised
that different actors active on cyber-criminal marketplaces may have different attitudes towards
research and ethics that had to be taken into consideration.
Two points can be carried away from this. First, given the complexity and diversity of social
data science, it may be valuable to do literature review and wider context survey specifically of
compliance issues in the field of undertaken research. While this idea may sound self-evident, it
is actually not uncommon to see prior review being focused exclusively on the already obtained
findings and on the employed methods, but not on compliance. More broadly, the discussion
above shows that the understanding of what the ethical issues are in a social data science project
and what the appropriate and practical responses are will often be evolving. Social data science
is a young discipline of extreme diversity and thus there cannot be a ready-made template for
identifying and dealing with ethical issues. This implies that social data science teams should
do ethics as continuous reflection on ever-evolving research activities. This also suggests that
insititutions should support equally iterative ethical review processes for social data science that
do not assume full up-front ethical clearance. The lack of such processes is a practical problem
that social data scientists are forced to cope with.
Plus, the context survey on compliance should not necessarily be limited to the same corpus
of work a research team would get acquainted with anyway  it may involve various forms
3.5. CHAPTER POSTFACE 115
of guidance and policy documents. Second, while this is not an observation directly about
compliance, it is interesting to note that what Martin and Christins paper has done for our
team is similar to what the designed project management tool aims to do for social data science
projects as a whole. The helpfulness of this paper further motivates the relevance of the tool.
3.5 Chapter Postface
The brief account of the additional evidence from the InfoMigrants evaluation project and the
Dark Net study concludes the discussion of the fieldwork undertaken to inform the project
management tool for social data science. To reflect on the analysis above, I would like to
highlight that the core recurrent issues threading through the case studies appear to have a dual
nature. On the one hand, they come from the practical complexities of doing social research with
the new methods and the new forms of data. This is particularly true for the issues associated with
accessing the data  be that the limitations that the platforms pose on the publicly available data
acquisition modes or even the mismatch with the implied scenarios of use for the commercial
data access software. However, in many cases the discovered issues could be tracked down to
the fundamental problems in studying the social  the same problems that pose the questions of
how much the social studies are actually a science (and by what criteria, cf. Jarvie, 2011) and
raise the tension between the desire to cast them as a such and the liberties that may come from
abandoning the notion of scientific nature (Wilde, 2010).
Large datasets and the alleged rigour they allow for cannot (even in principle) resolve the need
for making decisions that reflect a researchers (or a teams) stances and beliefs rather than being
informed by a scientific process. To the contrary, the new forms of data motivate a whole new
round of such decisions: should a like be weighted lighter than a comment? What is a UK
tweet? Should the audiences of a soft power organisation be expected to explicitly praise the
organisations country in their naturally occurring interactions? What are the valid criteria of
success on social media? Is the knowledge exchange by drug users facilitated by the Dark Net a
good or a bad thing?
From this perspective, the term social data science defended early in the thesis (see Section
1.1) may also be considered a bit of a misnomer  but a useful one, as its data science part is a
reminder of where the new analysis modes come from  it is just that the methodological
and philosophical implications that come with the social bit should not be disregarded.
And accordingly, the designed project management tool should be both a reminder of those
implications (by explicit representation of the underlying principles of a social data science
project and of their operationalisation) and the mechanism of navigation through them (by
116 CHAPTER 3. INFORMING THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL: CASE STUDIES
giving members of a social data science team a common artefact to structure their discussion of
those issues around and to keep reminding themselves of the agreed stances). The next chapter
introduces the tool and explores its contents.
4CHAPTER FOURSOCIAL DATA SCIENCESCORECARD DECK: THEPROJECT MANAGEMENT
The previous chapter has discussed several social data science projects that I studied as a
participant observer. Now I will use the experience of these projects and the lessons drawn from
them, as well as the review of relevant literature presented in Chapter 2, to inform the Social
Data Science Scorecard Deck, a project management tool that adapts the SEMAT Essence model
(OMG, 2015; Jacobson et al., 2013) to social data science. Section 4.1 provides an overview of
the Scorecard Deck by exploring the areas of concern and the core project aspects (alphas) of
a social data science project that are covered by the Scorecard Deck (4.1). Then I discuss the
process of using the tool, the contexts in which it might be done and how this is affected by its
implementation as a Google Spreadsheet (4.2). In section 4.3, I go through each alpha, discussing
its respective scorecards and relating their content to the fieldwork and, where relevant, to the
literature.
It is worth noting that while the chapter presents the finalised design and contents of the
Scorecard Deck, in practice its development was iterative. Most importantly, some specifics of
the scorecards were designed only after the first round of evaluation discussed in Section 5.2.
Such cases will be clearly indicated.
118 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK: THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL
4.1 Essence of Social Data Science
I would like to start the discussion of the Scorecard Deck (or simply the Deck from now on) in
a manner that parallels the SEMAT approach  i.e. by providing a conceptual overview model
that specifies the key areas of concerns in a social data science project (for discussion of the
corresponding SEMAT model, see Section 2.4.2). For each area of concern, this model lists its
core aspects (i.e. alphas) and depicts the relationships between the alphas and areas. Following
SEMATs tradition, the conceptual model is called the Essence of Social Data Science. It is
represented in Figure 4.1.
Out of the five represented areas of concern, the Demand, Response and Endeavour areas
are in direct correspondence with the three areas of the Essence of Software Engineering. Each
of them represents one of three fundamental components of any project in any field  the need
that motivates the project, the outcomes of this work and the process of work itself. Two other
areas  Analytics and Resources  are unique to the Essence of Social Data Science model.
The following sections will examine the five areas one by one, discussing the respective alphas
and their relationships.
4.1.1 Demand Area of Concern
The Demand area of concern captures the need for running a social data science project. The
area contains two alphas  Research Goals and Stakeholders. The area is analogous to
the Customer area in the SEMAT model. A different name is employed since the notion of
a customer is a problematic one and may be misleading. In its everyday meaning, this term is
not always directly applicable to a social data science project. The term customer arguably is
normally associated with a person or an organisation that purchases a good or a service for their
own benefit. In case of project-based activity, this implies being simultaneously a funder and a
lead beneficiary. In the non-for-profit sector, including academia, those are often two different
roles. While the funder always has a stake in a projects success, it is not necessarily their needs
that have the biggest impact on the direction of a project. For example, the Dark Net project (see
Section 3.4.2) was funded by an impact grant from the Economic and Social Research Council
(ESRC), yet our works primary objectives were focused on satisfying the needs of our a law
enforcement body that we planned to collaborate with. Although by succeeding in that we would
have also satisfied the expectations of the ESRC, those expectations were almost never explicitly
discussed in the project meetings. Given this, Demand seems to be a more appropriate generic
term.
The Research Goals alpha represents what, in principle, needs to be achieved by the research.

120 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK: THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL
It corresponds to the Opportunity alpha in the SEMAT Essence model. Research goals motivate
the social data science project and provide it with a direction. They justify the projects existence
by capturing the needs of the stakeholders and the underlying problem that the project tries to
solve. They also help to determine the scope of the project so that its impact is valuable while
carrying it out is feasible.
The fieldwork shows that the most high-level goals of a social data science project are not always
formulated in research terms and require more than just the scientific process to be achieved. For
example, the ultimate goal of the work discussed in the Hit List case study (see Section 3.3) was
not to simply find which topics had been the most discussed online in the UK within each week
(something that can be straight-forwardly adapted into a research question)  it was to produce a
high-quality weekly radio show based on those topics. The Research Goals alpha represents
both pure research- and overarching project goals, as those are very deeply intertwined and go
through similar states.
The goals inform the questions that the research aims to answer. Some of the prior work in which
I participated before this PhD demonstrates the problems that may arise should the link between
the questions and the goals weaken. It is quite illustrative that almost a half of the methodological
paper that discussed that work is devoted to its limitations (Dennis et al., 2015). By contrast, all
the case studies discussed in this thesis treated their goals with respect  be that the attention to
the stakeholder needs in the Shakespeare Lives- and the InfoMigrants evaluation projects (see
Section 3.2 and 3.4.1) respectively) or the highly collaborative work towards producing the Hit
List show.
The Stakeholders alpha represents the potential beneficiaries of a social data science project,
the users of the artefacts and, in accordance with Freemans (1984) ethical strategic outlook
on stakeholder engagement, other parties affected by a social data science project and thus are
affected by how compliant with ethical and legal standards the project is. Stakeholders may
support the project team through funding, guidance, participation in research activities and other
means. It is the stakeholders who are interested in the achievement of the research goals, and
thus they are the final judges of their completeness. The stakeholders also consume research
artefacts, which can, for example, explain the increase in the frequency of stakeholder meetings
towards the end of the project observed in the Shakespeare Lives case study. Even when the pure
research component of a social data science project is complete, the project can still go through
iterations to make the final product  in that particular case, a website presenting the research
outcomes  as useful and digestible for the stakeholders as possible.
4.1. ESSENCE OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE 121
4.1.2 Response Area of Concern
The Response area of concern captures the attempt to fulfil the need in a social data science
project. The area contains two alphas  Research Questions and Artefacts. The area
corresponds to the Solution area of concern in the SEMAT Essence model. The change of term
to an (again) broader one is driven by the realisation that in social data science, as much as as in
science in general, it is not always possible to arrive at a complete solution to the posed problem.
For example, while in the Shakespeare Lives evaluation project our research team managed to
go one step beyond the findings and to provide recommendations on running similar cultural
programmes to the British Council, by no means can we claim that this list of recommendations
is exhaustive and can guarantee the best possible online performance. Moreover, in a more
academic research context where social data science projects face even higher level of uncertainty,
there is always a risk to arrive at non-findings and essentially not to solve the research problem
at all.
The Research Questions alpha represents the questions that the research aims to answer.
This alpha loosely corresponds to the Requirements alpha of the SEMAT model. The bulk of
the work on a social data science project is done to answer the research questions, so they guide
the work on the project from start to finish  in a similar manner to the requirements, which
guide the process of software engineering. Moreover, as much as the requirements, the research
questions are iteratively refined throughout the course of a social data science project. This
quality of the research questions is discussed later when introducing the respective scorecards
(see Section 4.3.3).
The Artefacts alpha represents the outputs of the project that embed the answers to the
research questions, i.e. the research findings. The complexity of embedding the findings depends
on the type of artefacts  this may be more straightforward for the usual research outputs such
as academic papers, but gets trickier when the raw findings have to be balanced with other
considerations such as the quality of journalistic work, as in the Hit List case study. This notion
emphasises that artefacts help to achieve the project goals. From this perspective, the Artefacts
alpha loosely corresponds to the Software System alpha in the SEMAT model.
That being said, the differences between the social data science artefacts and software systems
in engineering projects are also profound. First, the types of social data science artefacts are
numerous: while they may take a form of apps and software modules, especially in an industrial
environment, they may also be reports of various forms (report documents, papers), media
artefacts, and others. Second, a software system can be metaphorically named the alpha and
omega of a software engineering process  the vast majority of the work directly feeds into
122 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK: THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL
it from the start of the project (the work iteratively goes from designing and early prototyping
to implementing and testing the components of a system). In contrast, in social data science
a lot of work goes not into the artefacts themselves, but into informing the artefacts with the
projects analytical work. The artefacts, in turn, are often developed at the end of the research
cycle. This was the case in the Shakespeare Lives evaluation, as the work on the final project
artefact (evaluation website) commenced only during the last round of project reporting. In the
Hit List case study, the artefacts (shows episodes) were released each week; however, the work
on each particular episode started only when the list of the most popular topics for its week had
been collated (see Section 3.3.1).
4.1.3 Analytics Area of Concern
The Analytics area of concern captures the substance of the research process that is required
to answer the research questions and to inform the artefacts. This area of concern is unique to
the Essence of Social Data Science and does not have a counterpart in the SEMAT model. It
could be loosely compared to the Work alpha of the SEMAT model, since both, in a sense,
represent what has to be done to achieve the goals. However, the Essence of Social Data Science
makes a distinction between the logistics aspect of the work involved (planning, task distribution,
monitoring, communication, as well as tying up the research activities within a project with other
activities that are required to produce the artefacts) and its actual research substance. The former
is still represented with the Work alpha inherited from the SEMAT model, while the rest is
represented by the alphas within the Analytics area of concern. This distinction allows to more
specifically guide a social data science project through the research process.
A reader may argue that Analytics should be represented as an alpha within the Response area
of concern rather than a separate area of concern by itself. Indeed, the areas loose counterpart in
the SEMAT model is an alpha rather than an area of concern. Treating Analytics as an alpha
is, in principle, possible since one may talk about the progress of a projects research process
as a whole. However, treating Analytics as an area of concern allows to look separately at its
core components by treating those as alphas. The Essence of Social Data Science distinguishes
two such alphas  Data and Analysis Methods. Treating them separately allows for a more
detailed guidance of what is arguably the central aspect of a social data science project.
That being said, the Analytics area maintains a property that is typically associated with
an alpha: as the Essence diagram depicts, this area has direct relationships with other alphas
(outgoing to Research Questions and Artefacts, incoming from Compliance). These
relationships are intuitively clear and are confirmed by fieldwork. For example, in the Hit List
case study, both inclusion of new data (i.e. data from new data sources) and changes in the data
4.1. ESSENCE OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE 123
aggregation methods tangibly affected the contents of the radio show. In general, a connection
in the Essence model that has an area of concern as one of its nodes should be interpreted as
if every individual alpha within this area of concern had such a connection  it is just a tool to
compress redundant information. This annotation does not perfectly align with the the SEMAT
formal language (see Section 2.4.2). However, since the end-goal of this thesis is to produce
a managerial tool for social data science projects rather than to formally model such projects,
practical utility and ease of representations becomes a higher value than full compliance with the
details of the standard.
The Data alpha represents all the data that are available for the project. Data may come from
both external and internal data sources and may be produced by the project interim work. For
example, in the InfoMigrants evaluation case, the data on the initiatives social media performance
came from external sources (the platform APIs and proprietary third-party analytical tools),
while the data on website visits were available internally to the organisations that carried out the
initiative. In the Hit List case, the data analyst produced a chart of popular news topics which in
itself became data for further journalistic treatment of the shows producers.
Data are a vital core aspect of a social data science project and often a problematic one. In
all case studies examined in this thesis, the teams had to deal with data that were less than
ideally tailored to answer the research questions. Not all social media posts studied to produce
the Hit List were news-related (see Section 3.3.4); not all tweets that the Shakespeare Lives
evaluation team studied to estimate publics emotional reaction towards the cultural programme
were of types that could display any sentiment other than neutral (see Section 3.2.5.3); in the
InfoMigrants evaluation project, the openly available data on social media engagement that
had to be used for benchmarking needs could only approximate to the complete engagement
metrics available through Facebook Insights and employed for the other analyses (see Section
3.4.1.3). While there is no universal recipe for how to deal with such problems, they at the
very least indicate the kinds of questions that research teams should ask themselves about what
data they need, what they can realistically have and how to close the gaps. Those questions are
incorporated into the respective scorecards (see Section 4.3.1).
It is worth noting that the Data alpha specifically treats research data as one of the components
that feed into the analysis performed within a social data science project. In practice, data are
also often one of the project artefacts. For example, the UKs Economic and Social Research
Council (2018) encourages data sharing and expects its funded researchers to do so unless ethical-
or other justifiable circumstances do not allow it. If this is the case in a social data science project
managed with the Scorecard Deck, it may be useful to treat the project data as subject of both
the Data- and Artefacts-related scorecards.
124 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK: THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL
The Analysis Methods alpha represents the particular analytical procedures and techniques
that are applied to data to derive knowledge from them. Social data science allows for various
modes of analysis and may include but are not limited to qualitative analysis techniques, data
visualisation techniques, descriptive statistics, classical inferential statistics and machine learning.
The issue of choosing and applying those techniques can be contrasted with the wider issues of
research design reflected in the Data and Research Questions alphas and with the issue of
data acquisition modes and methods reflected in the Data Sources alpha. Since in practice these
issues are deeply intertwined, it presents a challenge to representing the Analysis Methods alpha
in the Scorecard Deck. More on that challenge  as well as on the reasoning why specifically the
analysis methods are considered as a separate alpha, rather than research methods in general 
can be found in Section 4.3.4.
4.1.4 Resources Area of Concern
The Resources area of concern captures the resources necessary to run a social data science
project. Three alphas belong to it  Data Sources, Compliance and Infrastructure.
The original SEMAT model does not delegate a separate conceptual entity to project resources
(neither an area of concern nor an alpha). The issues of resourcing are instead attributed to
the alphas to which the respective resources are related. Thus, the Opportunity alpha covers
the financial resources, as this alpha stresses the need to evaluate the financial feasibility of
exploiting the opportunity. The Team alpha cover the human resources required to carry out a
project. Finally, the Software system alpha represents not only the solution to the opportunity,
but also the required infrastructural (software and hardware) resources.
For social data science, reducing resourcing issues to other alphas is not always possible. The
aforementioned example of infrastructure  a system of software and hardware components
that underpins the research process  is the prime example of that. Infrastructure proves to be
a vital resource for all sorts of social data science projects almost in every context. Even the
InfoMigrants evaluation project, which relied on very limited use of computational methods,
required a complex infrastructure, for example, for data acquisition (see Section 3.4.1.4). The
human coding of qualitative data discussed in context of the Shakespeare Lives case study also
relied on the use of specific software despite being a labour intensive rather computationally
intensive analysis mode (see Section 3.2.6).
Another reason to distinguish resources as a separate area of concern is the specificity of their key
types: a social data science projects depends on its data sources  as they feed the project with
data  and its technical infrastructure  as it allows to harvest and process these data. Compliance
4.1. ESSENCE OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE 125
with ethical, legal and licensing norms and permissions thus becomes a meta-resource that
governs the use of the two main resource types and constrains what they may be employed for.
On the other hand, non-compliance may, in the worst case, render project artefacts unusable by
the stakeholders; from this perspective, compliance may be viewed as a positive, risk mitigating
resource. Consequently, Data Sources, Infrastructure and Compliance are considered as
the three alphas of the Resources area of concern.
The Data Sources alpha relates to any system that (a) motivates and facilitates the creation
and/or storage of data and (b) provides a mode of access to these data that is available to the
research team. The data sources for social data science are as varied as the data themselves
 for example, they include social media-, search engine-, web marketplace- and other online
platforms, mobile and sensor devices, and transaction recording systems. Many observations
made within the case studies point at the complexities of working with various data sources. This
results in one of the most detailed sets of respective scorecards specifically for this alpha (see
Section 4.3.2).
The Infrastructure alpha, as already mentioned, is a multi-component system facilitating
the research process. Components of the infrastructure are primarily software and hardware. The
infrastructure is used to access the data sources, to acquire and store the research data and to
execute the research methods. In terms of the actual progression throughout the course of a social
data science project, the infrastructure goes through very similar states to those of the Software
System alpha in the SEMAT model, as both may be based either on software development
or on construction by configuration (Sommerville, 2008). For this reason, the content of the
Infrastructure scorecard set is almost in full inherited from the SEMAT model.
The Compliance alpha represents all the available compliance resources which normally
take the form of ethical and legal clearances, permissions and agreements. Compliance governs
the legal and ethical acceptability of accessing the data sources, storing the data and subjecting
the data to analyses using the selected methods.
The Compliance alpha does not have an analogue in the SEMAT model. Moreover, the
coverage of compliance-related issues in SEMAT is very limited even within other alphas. This
may seem counter-intuitive, since at least legal compliance is undoubtedly relevant to software
engineering  the issue of licensing external software components may be critical in determining
the cost structure of running a software system and thus in the buy-build decisions (Daneshgar
et al., 2013). Since construction by configuration (Sommerville, 2008) is a prominent model in
todays software engineering, those decisions play a crucial role.
There are at least three reasons that justify having a separate Compliance alpha. First, in social
126 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK: THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL
data science, compliance is not simply ensured once at a certain point in a project when license
agreements are read, understood and put into practice. Instead, monitoring and maintaining
compliance is a continuous task (see Section 2.3). Second, the interests of stakeholders are often
competing (see Section 3.4.2.2). Third, the social data science teams have to be proactive in
their treatment of compliance questions. That is, they should try to anticipate potential changes
(crucially, restrictions) from the compliance side and have a plan of action (see Section 3.4.1.1).
As an overarching theme for all three conclusions, it may be very beneficial for all team members
to have a strong and well fleshed-out shared understanding of the compliance issues involved in
a project and of the teams stance on how to deal with those issues, so having the compliance
issues represented in the Deck may be of great help for that.
4.1.5 Endeavour Area of Concern
The last area of concern covered in the Essence of Social Data Science model is Endeavour.
The area is concerned with the practicalities of carrying a social data science project.
This area inherits all of the alphas and the vast majority of properties from the corresponding
area of concern in the SEMAT model. The reason for this is that the SEMAT model captures
this area in a way that is arguably applicable to all projects, not only software engineering ones.
The Team alpha is in one-to-one relationship with it SEMAT counterpart. It represents the
people who are occupied with the project and perform the required work. The Work alpha
represents all the tasks that have to be performed within the project and thus the process of
addressing the project goals. The Ways of Working alpha represents the guiding principles
that the team adhere to when deciding how to plan, distribute and perform the work. Given the
highly adaptive, iterative nature of doing social data science, I decided to use the word ways in
plural as compared to way in the SEMAT model.
4.2 Using the Scorecard Deck
Like the SEMAT Essence model (see Section 2.4.2), the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck
is meant to be compatible with any process model of organising and managing a social data
science project. As a tool that captures the progress of a project, it should help social data science
teams to see how far they have progressed on different key aspects of their projects and suggest
potential further steps without requiring any particular process of implementing those steps.
As a holistic project management tool that puts equal consideration on hard and soft issues
involved in social research, the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck supports the principles of
social data science responsibility (see Section 2.1.3.1):
4.2. USING THE SCORECARD DECK 127
 The Deck helps social data science project teams to achieve shared understanding of their
work by providing a convenient talking point about the core aspects of a social data science
project and their relationships (see Section 5.2.1).
 The Deck supports research transparency by helping social data science teams to structure
their external reporting (see Section 5.2.1.3).
 The Deck supports reproducibility by helping research teams to track and record their
decisions and by encouraging them to preserve their data, practices and infrastructure (see
Tables 4.5, A.35 and A.19).
 The Deck supports iterative and reflexive use of analytical modes through suggesting how
data demands, research questions and analysis methods are critically refined (see Sections
4.3.1, 4.3.3, 4.3.4). The Decks spreadsheet interface (see Section 4.2.2) makes it easy to roll
back to earlier project states and iterate through those.
 The Deck supports combating research biases by helping researchers to put together
varied portfolios of analytical methods and data sources that allow for triangulation and
complementation (see Tables 4.6, 4.7 and 4.17) and by tracking decisions involved in research
operationalisations (see Table 4.2).
 The Deck supports social data science teams in assessing performativity through recognition
of the stakeholder groups, assessment of their needs and understanding what impact research
artefacts might have on them (see Section A.2).
4.2.1 Process and Context of Use
The process of using the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck is almost identical to that of the
SEMAT Essence model. Each of the core project aspects (alphas represented in Figure 4.1) is
represented by a top-level scorecard that shows a number of states tracking its progress. Each of
these states has its own card. Each state card has a number of conditions a project has to satisfy
for a state to be achieved.
One innovation compared to the SEMAT model is that states also have prerequisites: the
suggested states of other alphas that have to be achieved before the assessed state can be
considered achieved. Prerequisites interlink the sets of scorecards for different alphas and allow
to better judge the state of a project as a whole.
To use the Scorecard Deck, one has to select an alpha whose progress they would like to assess.
They would need to consider the conditions and the prerequisites on each of the state cards
128 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK: THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL
comparing them to the projects status. This provides an indication as to where some activity
might be required to progress the project. In principle, the conditions can be ticked off as satisfied
in any order, but the idea is that for the most part a state can only be reached if all previous states
The Social Data Science Scorecard Deck can be used in multiple environments:
 During the project team meetings, the Deck can be used to track the progress of all the critical
aspects of a social data science project and to identify the aspects that fall behind the others.
It can also be used to plan further activities and their timespans. Furthermore, the scorecards
can serve as a map to distribute responsibilities among the individual team members.
 The Deck can be used in the routine work of individual team member. A team member can
use the alphas, states and conditions that they are responsible for as a convenient structure for
documentation of their work and for their progress reporting. The project manager or a team
leader can use the scorecards for continuous assessment of the project state.
 The Deck can be used outside of the scope of a particular project as a way to classify and
organise best practices and ways of working that a team or an organisation has developed and
to store pointers to relevant guidance.
Depending on the complexity of a project, the Deck can be used in the context of the project as a
whole, of a particular branch of the project and of a particular iteration.
4.2.2 Spreadsheet Interface
While the original SEMAT model comes in the form of paper artefacts  actual physical cards 
the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck is presented as an interative Google Spreadsheet. While
tangible cards do have an advantage in that it is possible to use them in engaging interactive
activities within the project meetings, in the case of social data science those are overshadowed
by the advantages that the electronic form brings:
 Opportunity for remote collaboration. From the experience of the case studies, social data
science teams are often geographically disperse. This is arguably especially common in
the academic context, with team members from different universities working together. As
Google Spreadsheet allows concurrent collaboration on the same document, it becomes
possible to interactively use the Scorecard Deck in remote team meetings.
 Opportunities for revision. Doing social data science is a highly iterative process. A condition
that seems achieved today may cease to be so tomorrow due to previously undiscovered
4.2. USING THE SCORECARD DECK 129
methodological considerations, adjustments to research goals and questions, newly discovered
data sources and so forth. An opportunity to tick on / tick off the same condition as many
times as required is thus crucial.
 Granularity in progress tracking. A consideration related to the previous one  with electronic
artefacts, it is easier to implement intermediate states of achievement for particular conditions.
For example, the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck allows to mark a condition to be in
progress, achieved subject to further revision or achieved definitely.
 Opportunities for annotation. Spreadsheets are very flexible tools. Users of a Social Data
Science Scorecard Deck spreadsheet may benefit from this flexibility by using the space near
the scorecards to put more detailed notes on their progress, to provide their operationalisations
to the assessed states and conditions or to insert hyperlinks to related project files and
documentations. In the latter case the Scorecard Deck effectively becomes a table of contents
for the research project.
 Opportunities to adjust the scorecards. If a project team feels that a certain component of
their project is either misrepresented on not represented at all in the existing scorecards, they
may always make changes to the tool itself.
 Automation. Since the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck introduces the concept of
prerequisites that tie together scorecards for different alphas, there is scope for automating
navigation, representation of progress and cross-referencing in general.
 Ease of export. The assessment of conditions, as well as the supporting notes, can be easily
exported from a spreadsheet, for example to be included into project reporting.
 Sharing. If a new member joins a social data science project team, it is easy to share the
projects scorecards with them. This can be a useful measure to introduce the newcomer to
the current project state.
In the spreadsheet representation, each tab is dedicated to one alpha. The alpha card is at the top
of the sheet, with the state cards stacked vertically beneath it. Figure 4.2 presents an example
alpha (Research Questions) and state (Research Questions 1/5 : Outlined) scorecard from
the Google Spreadsheet representation. In this imaginary example, a user has worked through
the state scorecard. For each condition, they assessed its accomplishment from a predefined
set of options (No, In progress, Yes (to be revised), Yes (definitively), N/A). Similarly, for the
prerequisites (two bottom rows), they chose whether to consider or discard those in assessment of

the states progress. The percentage values of the state progress (30%) and of the alpha progress

As the content of the scorecards were revised throughout the work on this thesis, I stored the
scorecards content as a JSON file and developed a Google App Script app that could generated
an automated spreadsheet from the data. Storing the contents of the Scorecard Deck as a separate
JSON file is valuable in itself, as this allows for development of alternative interfaces.
4.3. CONTENT OF THE SCORECARDS 131
4.3 Content of the Scorecards
This section examines the individual scorecards that have been developed as part of this research.
It is focused on justifying the content of those scorecards with respect to the evidence from the
case studies the literature. Most relevant bits of evidence are discussed in detail elsewhere in
this thesis and thus only summarised and cross-referenced here. In rare cases when the relevant
evidence does not fit the overarching narrative of other chapters, it is provided in this section
in full. The discussion of the scorecards that are directly adapted from the original SEMAT
Essence model is relegated to the appendices as it does not report on substantive research work,
mostly outlines insignificant changes to the original cards and, by its nature, is very repetitive
(see Appendix A).
As much as the original SEMAT cards (see Section 2.2), the new scorecards represent the
progression of the project core aspects (alphas) through their consecutive states. It is worth
noting that in practice such progress is iterative  data acquisition and selection criteria evolve
over time and involve trial-and-error, findings motivate new research questions, new data sources
get added and the infrastructure has to be adjusted accordingly. Yet, one still can elicit observable
states within each iteration, and while an alpha can be returned to one of its previous states
before completing the iteration (e.g. if quality assurance of data shows that the acquired data are
not of sufficient quality for a meaningful analysis, data would have to be re-operationalised and
re-acquired), the alpha would still have to go through the previously achieved states again.
The following discussion tackles the developed scorecards by going through the alphas one-by-
one. As the alphas represent concurrent project aspects and thus are tackled in an arbitrary order.
Within each alpha, the individual state scorecards are discussed. The discussion thus starts with
the first state of the Data alpha.
4.3.1 Data
4.3.1.1 State 1. Envisioned
The idea that data must first be envisioned is inspired by De Vauss (2001) discussion of research
design. He argues that the issue of which subjects and which of their features data must
represent precedes that of particular data acquisition practices and data analysis methods. From
this perspective, research design is a combination of the broad research questions (given as
a prerequisite in Table 4.1) and the initial vision of data that would support answering those
questions conclusively. Following De Vauss logic, the initial vision of data is vital regardless of
whether data are generated in a controlled environment or are naturally occurring, whether they
are qualitative or quantitative, big or small. Therefore, envisioning data is as vital for social data
132 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK: THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL
science projects as to more traditional forms of research.
The conditions of this state are derived from a combination of the fieldwork evidence and De
Vaus (ibid.) thinking on research design. Under such views, social research is often interested
in studying particular aspects (primary attributes) of a particular real-world entities (primary
research subjects). For example, in the InfoMigrants and ShakespeareLives evaluation case
studies, among other research tasks, studied the strength of online audience engagement (the
attribute) shown by the InfoMigrants and ShakespeareLives audiences (the subjects). In line
with De Vaus logic, the strength of the conclusions that we could make about their levels of
engagement (whether they were low, high or normal) depended on our ability to identify other
comparable programmes and initiatives (secondary research subjects), and to make comparisons
with the levels audience engagement those managed to provoke.
In the Shakespeare Lives evaluation, we faced a principle inability to do so, as the that cultural
programme was unique in many regards. This caused significant struggles for interpretation of
findings, as discussed in Section 3.2.5.3. In the subsequent InfoMigrants evaluation, we did
identify comparable initiatives. However, since no one of the compared initiatives performed
exactly the same activities as InfoMigrants, we had to elicit their secondary attributes (qualitative
differences such as focus on specific group of immigrants, provision of specific types of services,
etc.) that could interfere with the primary attribute of our interest (see Section 3.4.1.2).
DATA: ENVISIONED There is a tentative idea of what kind of data are required
for the project needs.
Primary subjects

The real-world entities that are the subject of the research
questions and that must be represented in data are deter-
mined.
Secondary subjects
of research interest
determined
If relevant, secondary groups of real-world entities that
should be covered by data for the needs of baseline /
benchmark comparison are determined.
Primary attributes
of research interest
determined
The characteristics of the objects of interest, of their relation-
ships and of their interactions that are of direct concern for
the research questions and that must be represented in data
are determined.
Secondary attributes of
research interest deter-
mined
If relevant, secondary characteristics of real-world entities
that should be studied in conjunction with the primary ones
are determined.
Research Questions:
Outlined
The research questions are formulated as a broad framework
that sets the direction for the project.
Table 4.1: Data: Envisioned. Conditions and prerequisites.
4.3. CONTENT OF THE SCORECARDS 133
4.3.1.2 State 2 Operationalised
The fieldwork shows how close examination of data sources and a corresponding refinement of
research questions (reflected in both prerequisites and conditions in Table 4.2) help to progress
from a vision of data to an operational understanding of the required data. In the Hit List
production example, the particularities of each online platform and of their data acquisition
modes helped to establish the features that must be represented in the data and the level of
granularity of the acquired data records (i.e. data demands), as well as the precise criteria of
data acquisition formulated as queries to a platforms API or feed (i.e. data boundaries) (see
Section 3.3.3.1).
Table 4.2 also highlights the role of the compliance strategy in operationalisation of data demands.
It is worth noting that in the studied projects compliance never actually limited how a team
had to operationalise data. However, a match between data demands and compliance had to be
ensured when studying the Dark Net. It resulted in an elaborate self-evaluation of ethical and risk
management compliance of the teams data collection strategy with a complex risk-assessment
framework suggested by Martin and Christin (2016).

134 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK: THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL
4.3.1.3 State 3. Acquired
After the data demands and boundaries are defined to an operational level, data can get acquired
from active data sources into a working project infrastructure (hence the prerequisites in Table
4.3). The specific conditions suggested for this alpha follow the discussion in our chapter on data
curation (Voss et al., 2016). The fieldwork positively confirms the importance of these conditions.
For example, new restrictions to the Facebook Graph API that were faced in the second year
of the InfoMigrants evaluation project show that data cannot always be easily reacquired as it
may seem (see Section 3.4.1.1). The Shakespeare Lives evaluation project shows that keeping
an extensive paper trail of data characteristics may be the best way to track provenance of
the research decisions and thus ultimately have confidence in the findings (see Sections 3.2.6.2
and 3.2.5.3). An appropriate data storage structure was especially important for the Hit List
production as some of the data pre-processing had to be applied automatically to newly arriving
data for the production cycle to finish on time (see Section 3.3.6.2).
The importance of storing the original data rather than only a cleaned and processed version was
reaffirmed in one of the subsequent studies of cryptomarkets. As data were acquired through
scraping HTML pages to JSON files, the acquisition outcomes relied on our knowledge of
the pages DOM trees and on the consistency of those DOM trees over time. Sometimes we
would randomly encounter special cases when the DOM structure was different  e.g. banned
cryptomarket traders had an additional HTML element on their profile page, which we did not
know about for the first several months of scraping and thus had not factored it in the scraping
procedure. The only way for us to repair this omission in the earlier scraping iterations was to
apply the reviewed scraping approach to the original raw HTML source files which we luckily
stored alongside the processed JSON.
4.3.1.4 State 4. Quality Assured
The name of this state could be interchanged with such synonyms as Cleaned and Pre-
processed, however Quality Assured sound more inclusive than the former and shows a
clearer intention than the latter (at the end of the day, the line between pre-processing and
processing is quite thin). The contents of the states scorecard (see Table 4.4) mostly follow
the experience of Hit List collating. Before the analyst could perform the core data analysis,
selection had to be applied to Twitter data and aggregation had to be applied to data from all
studied platforms bar Facebook (see Section 3.3.3.1). As these quality assurance activities were
done to facilitate the core analysis task, they were designed with this task in mind (hence the
Analysis Methods: Selected prerequisite). On the other hand, the lack of bringing the Twitter
data to a unified schema with data from other platforms was what caused low visibility of Twitter

data for the production team compared to the other studied platforms (see Section 3.3.5.2).
The importance of dealing with data veracity issues seems self-evident. The Shakespeare Lives
project showed that, interestingly, even interim project data created by the research team poses
veracity issues. I encountered those when visualising human data coding (see Section 3.2.6.4).
Even though the Excel spreadsheets that the researchers had used to annotate the acquired social
media postings had data validation rules applied, somehow several researchers still managed to
make spelling mistakes in the names of the variable levels. Furthermore, it was quite common
among the researchers to accidentally skip a question and thus create a missing value. Finally,
one researcher once changed the ordering of the columns in her spreadsheet which caused my
code, hardwired to a precise data schema, to swap values of two variables in the resulting
visualisations. This bug was easy to repair, but hard to notice. Luckily, I corrected the mistake
before the researcher had time to use wrong plots for her analysis.
The need to take compliance measures when performing quality assurance of data was never high
in the studied projects. I decided to include the respective condition as a logical next step from
136 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK: THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL
the compliance-related conditions in the previous states and as an extra precautionary measure.

In its final state, data are utilised for the project needs. The conditions suggested for this state
(see Table 4.5) are trivial. They add an extra layer of confidence in that the measures that should
have been already taken to bring the Data alpha through some of its earlier states (such as data
documentation and preservation) are in place. As such, they are informed by the same episodes
in the fieldwork. They also suggest archiving the data where possible to strengthen research
reproducibility and to support future studies (Potthast et al., 2016).

4.3. CONTENT OF THE SCORECARDS 137
4.3.2 Data Sources
4.3.2.1 State 1. Identified
As the Essence of Social Data Science (see Section 4.1) treats data sources as a resource for
research, the Social Science Scorecard Deck suggests that envisioning data is a prerequisite to
the Identified state of the Data Sources alpha (see Table 4.6). Putting Data: Envisioned as
a prerequisite does not lead to assuming a particular linear process of doing social data science
where the search for appropriate data sources strictly follows designing the research. In fact,
the example of the Hit List production suggests that social data science projects can be first
motivated by an opportunity to harness data from some source rather than by any preconceived
research question. Arguably, the same may happen in academic work as well.
Rather, this prerequisite tries to convey the idea that it only makes sense to talk about the
appropriateness and completeness of the identified list of candidate sources when there is a
defined purpose for them. This corresponds well with the aforementioned idea of Gitelman (2013)
that data are not data unless they are imagined as such. To follow on the Hit List production
example, until the initial idea of using online platforms to learn whats buzzing turned into a
vision for data on popularity of stories among the UK public online (see Section 3.3.1), it was
not possible to claim with confidence that, say, Google Trends was a relevant data source while
VK.com was not. By contrast, in the Shakespeare Lives evaluation project, VK.com was very
relevant for demographic reasons (see Section 3.2.4.1), while Google Trends was not since the
analysis focused on audience engagement on social media and therefore search counts were not
a relevant data type (see Section 3.2.1.1).
Be it to cross-validate findings across audiences in different countries (Shakespeare Lives)
or to cover a broad spectrum of popular topics from hard news to viral social media content
(Hit List), both these projects had to identify and employ a multitude of sources to allow for
triangulation and complementation. Data sources with privileged access played a key role in the
two studied evaluation projects. For example, when evaluating InfoMigrants, some members
of our team were given editor rights to their public Facebook pages so that we could access
Facebook Analytics.
The data sources and the resulting data, according to the definition of the alpha, are primarily
(born) digital but not necessarily so. As the fieldwork shows, social data science projects
sometimes use traditional social science data sources: interviews, surveys, focus groups, etc.
For example, these were heavily incorporated into the work on the Cultural Value Strand
of the Shakespeare Lives study (see Section 3.2.1.2). Using traditional social science data
sources may involve trade-offs in effort and expenses with the new data sources. Also, thinking
138 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK: THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL
about traditional and data-driven components of the research simultaneously (be it data sources,
analytic methods, analysis infrastructure, etc.) can lead to a greater synergy between the two. For
example, the traditional methods may prove to be especially valuable for finding explanations of
the social phenomena that can be observed using the naturally occurring digital data.
DATA SOURCES:
IDENTIFIED

The identified data sources allows acquiring data that cover
different aspects of the studied problem and cross-validate
each other.
Data: Envisioned There is a tentative idea of what kind of data are required
for the project needs.
Table 4.6: Data Sources: Identified. Conditions and prerequisites.
4.3.2.2 State 2. Evaluated
The Social Data Science Scorecard Deck puts a huge emphasis on evaluation of potential data
sources as their diversity means that they have varied limitations and particularities. As suggested
by the fieldwork, these limitations and particularities can, in turn, have profound consequences
for methodology and for the employed infrastructure. This leads to quite an elaborated system of
conditions in the respective scorecard (see Table 4.7).
The issues of degree of access and level of control are related to each other. It is tempting to
think about them in terms of a dichotomy between the internal (and thus fully-accessible and
well-controlled) versus external, problematic data sources. The fieldwork, however, suggests
that this is not the case and, in fact, different modes of acquisition allow for a trade-off between
the two. While the commercial tools employed in the Shakespeare Lives evaluation study to
acquire data from Twitter and Instagram provided privileged access to the data, the control over
4.3. CONTENT OF THE SCORECARDS 139
the export functions of those systems and, therefore, over the ability to subject the accessed data
to our teams own analysis methods, was quite limited (see Section 3.2.6.1).
Different data sources may lead to different levels of data veracity that have to be considered.
As already mentioned, two of the studied projects (evaluations of Shakespeare Lives and
InfoMigrants) used both traditional sources of data alongside digital platforms. The veracity
issues obviously differ between these two groups. However, even within digital platforms,
data veracity strongly depended on the available modes of acquisition. For example, as there
were restrictions to accessing the Facebook Graph API in the second year of the InfoMigrants
evaluation (see Section 3.4.1.4), some limited scope scraping had to be performed. Since
Facebooks website is highly dynamic, the scraping outcomes were not always as expected and
had to be partially manually repaired, which would have been problematic had the scope of
scraping been higher.
Considering the mode of acquisition thus becomes an overarching issue for all the ones discussed
above. Another reason why an acquisition mode matters is that it may pose its own compliance
restrictions that must be considered. For example, some platforms strictly prohibit scraping.
What particular ramifications not adhering to this rule may have and whether it changes depending
on the scope of scrape is a separate question  yet it is a question a researcher should be prepared
to answer.
The idea of source-wise biases is informed by Ruths and Pfeffer (2014) who outline how
different platforms attract varying demographic groups and, through the platform mechanics,
foster different kinds of behaviour; although the issue of platform-specific bias is tackled in
numerous literature (Sloan, 2017; Cihon and Yasseri, 2016; Morstatter et al., 2014). The fieldwork
strongly supports this idea, with the systematically repeating difference of dominating topics
across the studied platforms discovered during Hit List production being a primary example
3.3.3.2. Behavioural biases caused by the platforms were also one of the reasons why, within the
Shakespeare Lives evaluation, data from Twitter and Sina Weibo platforms were acquired with
keyword-based criteria and were studied through human data annotation as individual postings,
while data acquisition for other platforms was focused on particular accounts and the data were
studied through online ethnography (see Section 3.2.4.2).
Having feasible infrastructural requirements to data acquisition from each data source were
critical in every studied project. For example, the work on the Hit List was only possible since
there were multiple servers located in different universities and thus connected to different
university networks in the teams possession. The network-independence and physical dispersion
of the servers were crucial to achieve a sufficient level of redundancy in acquiring data from
140 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK: THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL
the sources that required continuous access, such as the Twitter Streaming API and the Google
Trends feed. It is worth noting that the relationship between the data sources and the infrastructure
can go both ways  i.e. architecture may be selected to meet the data acquisition requirements.
As will be shown further, this is represented in the Infrastructure alpha (see Appendix A.3.1.1).
Finally, the mapping to the research questions condition is left in mostly to guarantee that this
crucial match, which has already been discussed above (see Section 4.3.2.1) is maintained.

that sets the direction for the project.
Table 4.7: Data Sources: Evaluated. Conditions and prerequisites.
4.3.2.3 State 3. Selected
This state represents the finalisation of the choices that emerge from identification of potential
data sources and evaluation of their merits and limitations (see Table 4.8). For example,
as discussed above, the specialisation decisions can naturally follow the differences in the
represented demographics and in the platform-provoked user behaviour. The prioritisation of
4.3. CONTENT OF THE SCORECARDS 141
sources can be clearly observed in the Shakespeare Lives project. The Chinese researcher used
data from two platforms  Seana Weibo and Twitter  for content analysis. Treating Twitter as
a secondary source in this scenario allowed her to be a bit less meticulous in iterating through
data acquisition criteria, which was very liberating from the logistics perspective (see Section
3.2.7.1 details). On the other hand, not neglecting Twitter completely allowed to satisfy the
operationalised data demands in terms of quantities of data for analysis.
The scorecards also reminds that some of the identified and evaluated data sources may be
completely discarded, yet it suggests that there must be convincing reasons for that. The
experience of the case studies shows that if a source has been identified as clearly bearing relevant
data, a research team would do their best to employ this source in some shape or form, even if
a convenient mode of access to data was absent or the available data were incomparable with
data from other sources and not perfectly tailored to the research questions. As has been shown
above, instead of simply rejecting a source, the research teams in the studied projects would more
likely assign a lower priority to such a source and consider its particularities when interpreting
findings. This seemingly stubborn desire to keep the previously selected data sources in the
scope of a project actually is not by itself methodologically harmful and tends to make the
projects stronger. Even if some data sources are especially problematic, it does not that others
are at all not  at the end of the day, most social data science sources bear naturally occurring
data, which are inherently not tailored specifically to the research questions. Having the need to
deal with different sets of limitations and methodological pitfalls for different sources leads to
better triangulation of findings and to levelling out the systematic noise in the data related to the
properties and imperfections of each individual data source.
DATA SOURCES: SE-
LECTED
A firm decision on the use of each data source is made.

142 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK: THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL
4.3.2.4 State 4. Supported
The Data Sources alpha progresses to this state when everything is ready for data acquisition
(see Table 4.9). Having an obtained access to the sources is thus a self-evident condition.
The conditions of understanding risks and having alternatives are related to each other, as
the alternatives have to be put into correspondence with the potential problems that can occur.
The aforementioned infrastructure architecture that allowed to acquire the Twitter 1% sample
redundantly is a good example. If the main project server had crashed or there has been a
power/network outage, the data would still have been acquired in a different university. A
risk that a data acquisition mode associated with any particular platform would at all become
unavailable was diversified by relying on data from multiple platforms.
It is of course true that some risks cannot be foreseen  and even if they can, they seem sufficiently
unlikely and a temporary interruption in data acquisition would not pose a huge challenge anyway.
In such cases, it may not be worth to design alternative data collection procedures in advance.
For example, this was the case with the terminated access to the Facebook Graph API in the
second year of the InfoMigrants evaluation project  this had not seemed as a likely scenario at
least until the Cambridge Analytica scandal emerged. It is up for a research team who uses the
Scorecard Deck to figure out which situation is more applicable to them.
Regarding the prerequisites, having an infrastructure ready to acquire the data (or at least to
store it if the data are purchased) and securing the compliance to access the data sources (i.e.
getting relevant ethical permissions, licenses, data access rights) seem to be self-evident. Having
a collaborating team may seem to an overkill  in principle, data acquisition may be started
by a sole data scientist who plans to form a team to analyse these data later. Yet, the fieldwork
suggests that having collaborating team members at the data acquisition stage is hugely beneficial,
as the data selection decisions are likely to be made iteratively and, while sometimes they can
be made post-factum (e.g. while working on Hit List  see Section 3.3.4), it is not always
possible. Yet again, the collaborative process of formulating Twitter data acquisition criteria in
the Shakespeare Lives project is a good example of that (see Sections 3.2.6.1 and 3.2.7.1).
4.3.2.5 State 5. Active
Many prerequisites and conditions of the Data Sources: Active state are logical next steps of
those discussed alongside the earlier states of this alpha (see Table 4.10). This includes the issues
of compliance, infrastructure, maintaining redundancy and monitoring. The last condition  a
warrant of continuous access  is left specifically for cases of using modes of acquisition that
may have an upper bound on the time of their use due to the terms of conditions. In the studied
projects, such modes were presented by the aforementioned commercial social media analysis

of re-use is added on top. This mostly relates to the infrastructural component of data acquisition
 for example, the Twitter data acquisition for the Hit List was performed with the tools and on
servers that had already been employed to connect to the Twitter Streaming API by some of the
data scientists on the team. However, this also relates to the specific practices and procedures
of data acquisition. For example, in the Shakespeare Lives project data acquisition had to be
re-invoked for each round of three rounds of reporting. When, after the first round, a new project
manager joined the team, she could reuse the data documentation standard developed by the first
project manager, which significantly eased keeping track of the data acquisition progress (see
Section 3.2.6.2).

4.3.3 Research Questions
4.3.3.1 State 1. Outlined
The Scorecard Deck distinguishes research questions posed in a broad form of more open
questions formulated in terms of the subject domain and their subsequent refined version posed
in terms compatible with the imagined data and methods. For the first state of the Research
Questions alpha to be achieved, the former is sufficient (see Table 4.12).
Translating the outlined research goals into specific knowledge demands was a crucial bit for
all the studied research projects, yet the difficulty of it was different from project to project.
For the Hit List production, this translation was quite straightforward, as the goal of creating a
weekly chart of stories based on their popularity online in the UK contains a question in itself.
By contrast, for the Shakespeare Lives evaluation, this translation was significantly more difficult.
The goal of assessing the online performance of a cultural programme does not specify neither
the particular subjects of interest neither the success criteria. To make this translation, the project
investigators had to rely on their past experience of similar evaluations, on their understanding
of the priorities of a soft power organisation and on further communication with the stakeholder 
i.e. the British Council. As can be seen, the list of broad research questions for Shakespeare
4.3. CONTENT OF THE SCORECARDS 145
Lives evaluation (see Section 3.2.4) is, while not straight-away operational, really manages to
capture what should be known by the end of the project.
The need of doing the background research and understanding the scope of existing knowledge
was not something that was really encountered in the key case studies undertaken as part of the
fieldwork, as the studied projects aimed to generate knowledge for very narrow and specific
purposes. Rather, this condition naturally emerged from the general understanding of research
process. Subsequently, when evaluating the Scorecard Deck while studying the crypto-criminal
marketplaces on the Dark Net, this condition proved to be very relevant, as the background
knowledge brought to the team by the projects principal investigator was crucial to correctly pose
the research questions on the resilience of such marketplaces to law-enforcement intervention in
terms of the social structures and relationships between buyers and sellers that these marketplaces
facilitate.

Table 4.12: Research Questions: Outlined. Conditions and prerequisites.
4.3.3.2 State 2. Refined
The fieldwork suggests several conditions the research questions have to met to be considered
refined. First, the questions have to be scoped. For example, in the Shakespeare Lives case study,
the broad research question on the sentiment of response to the cultural programme, the notion of
response had to be scoped. Some of the considered issues were whether the response had to come
in a form of separate social media postings or as a reaction (e.g. liking) on other posts; whether
the response should be about the cultural programme as a whole or about its particular events; in
the latter case, whether there must be evidence that the commenting person understands that the
event is part of a wider Shakespeare Lives campaign. This scope was actually refined iteratively
146 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK: THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL
within the project (see Section 3.2.4.3), yet understanding it and its implications on each stage of
research was crucial to framing the emerging findings correctly.
Specifying variables and their values for the coding frameworks (see Section 3.2.5) employed in
the Shakespeare Lives and InfoMigrants evaluations is a great example of extracting specific
questions. The frameworks are in correspondence with the nature of the envisioned acquirable
data (isolated social media postings of topic of Shakespeare Lives / isolated articles on the
InfoMigrants website) and are to be used in the suggested mode of analysis (content analysis).
The specific research questions can thus be asked in terms of the distributions of the coded
variables and of their relationships (see Section 3.2.6.4). The ability of the team to answer
those questions has to rely heavily of common understanding shared by the team members.
For example, in the Shakespeare Lives project, one of the key questions the researchers had to
answer in regard to every analysed post was whether it acknowledged the values of Britain
that the British Council aimed to promote. Understanding what such an acknowledgement must
constitute of was an involved process (see Section 3.2.5.1).
The coding variables discussed above quite straightforwardly informed the proxies and metrics
for answering the refined research questions. Since each variable had a limited number of possible
values, demonstrating the empirical distributions of those values was sufficient, provided that a
researcher gave an interpretive commentary alongside representation of those distributions (see
Sections 3.2.6.4 and 3.2.5.3). In other cases, when the involved analysis included reducing the
data to a particular metric, its choice could be debated. For example, the metric used by the
analyst to measure a topics popularity on Facebook when producing the charts for Hit List show
 a weighted sum of comments, likes and shares  did not seem like the best choice to at least
one producer on board who would have preferred a plain, unweighted sum instead (see Section
3.3.5.1). Yet, what is important in the context of this particular state of the Research Questions
alpha is that the principle possibility to derive a metric in response to the posed question from
the data was there.
4.3.3.3 State 3. Matched
This state of the Research questions alpha in the Scorecard Deck plays a bridging role and
serves as a reminder for a research team to reflect on their research decisions thus far and to
make sure they are consistent and aligned with each other. The importance of some of the
conditions  e.g. of checking the match between the research questions on the one hand and
data and compliance on the other hand (see Table 4.14)  is thus trivial and follows from the
discussion of previous states of the alpha.
The notion that refined research questions may lose connection to the original broad questions is

motivated by some of my prior work, e.g. one reported in Willis et al. (2015). In that project, our
team performed social networking analysis for the BBC World Service. While that project did
come to a successful end, part of the social network analysis performed by out team was rejected
by the stakeholders as not relevant to their needs and to the broad questions that the proposal had
promised to answer. Working as a more-or-less independent team of social network analysts and
occasionally allowing ourselves to pursue what we personally thought were the most interesting
aspects of the data was the primary reason for that.
Finally, the issue of relationship between research questions and research artefacts is probably
best demonstrated by looking at the attempts to use an unsupervised learning algorithm to cluster
Google Trends search terms into topics. Indeed, that classifier essentially was designed to answer
a particular question of how we could group the search terms by the vocabulary used in related
news headlines. While this question corresponded well with the broad question of when two
separate themes can be considered one, it was still not the right research question specifically for
producing the Hit List, since radio show production is inherently not agnostic of past experience
(i.e. the work on previous episodes  and the contents of those episodes), while such a classifier
is (see Section 3.3.4.3).
4.3.3.4 State 4. Answered
The key issue that the Scorecard Deck tries to emphasise in regard to answering research
questions is considering limitations of the employed methods and data sources (see Table 4.15).
While this issue is by no means new or unique to social data science, the discussion of the Data
Sources and the Analysis Methods alphas (see Sections 4.3.4 and 4.3.2) shows just how much
their role matters  and how it may be different to that of traditional social science empirical

methods of data collection and analysis. For example, in the Shakespeare Lives evaluation, our
team encountered tweets that had been almost certainly posted by bots (see Section 3.2.5.2).
While such clear cases of spam equipped out team with greater consciousness towards this issue,
they also meant that there might be other cases when we would make a false judgement one way
or another. The risk of spam influencing the analysis findings is something hard to imagine in
traditional social science.

4.3.3.5 State 5. Utilised
The last state of the alpha is distinguished from the previous one to remind that simply arriving to
answers to the research questions does not end their journey. The answers have to be (embedded)
into project artefacts  be those numerous project reports and an interactive website for the
visualisations as in the case of Shakespeare Lives or as a weekly topic chart and then a radio
show based on it as in case of Hit List. Second, the experience of the fieldwork shows that if
there was a stakeholder who evaluates the project outcomes (and there arguably almost always
is  e.g. in purely academic research that would be peer reviewers), the answers to the research
questions would go through iterative refinement even after the team is happy with them. This
was especially clearly seen in the Open University projects, since both the British Council in one
of them and the InfoMigrants team plus the European Commission in the other, challenged the
presented reports and suggested new angles to look at. Finally, each round of answering research
questions often led to extending them for further research. For example, the online ethnography
of the British Councils public pages Facebook and VK.com led to a futher question of how the
discussions around Shakespeare Lives evolve on the pages of the British Councils local partners
in each country. This question was investigated on the last round of reporting.

4.3.4 Analysis Methods
The Analysis Methods alpha is the one that is the hardest to conceptualise and represent
in the Scorecard Deck, as the underlying concept is an involved one. It is worth reiterating
that the alpha is referring to analysis methods, as the word method by itself is used in a
variety of contexts, for example as part of scientific method; this understanding would include
analysis per se as only one of the methods stages, which comes in a lot later than, for example,
proposing verifiable (Cohen and Nagel, 2013, p.215)  or falsifiable (Popper, 1959, pp.57120) 
hypotheses. Using the expression research methods to refer to different ways of generating
knowledge about the world  including those that do not prescribe to a strict scientific process,
e.g. grounded theory (Strauss and Corbin, 1990)  aims at a similar scope.
150 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK: THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL
The Analysis Methods alpha here refers to the particular techniques that are applied to the
acquired data to derive knowledge from them. It is, yet again, in line with the ideas of De Vaus
(2001) that research design, acquisition modes and data analysis are agnostic to each other.
For example, a researcher may employ experimental research design in that they formulate a
hypothesis on an effect of some intervention and then they collect data on two groups of subjects
(the treated group and the control group) before and after the treated group was subjected to
this intervention. Yet, instead of using statistical analysis methods, which are stereotypically
associated with such research, the research may opt for acquiring qualitative data (e.g. through
interviews with the participants) and analyse it with qualitative methods (e.g. by identifying the
themes emerging in those interviews with open coding).
This is a very powerful idea that is, as the fieldwork shows, very relevant to social data science
(see further discussion on the alphas states for details). Yet, the problem is that a lot of analysis
methods are defined with a particular grander research method  and, as Janert (2010, p.221
235) argues, even a particular research designs  in mind. For example, even when doing
predictive regression modelling in an iterative, data-driven manner without explicitly formulating
a prior hypothesis about the form the final model should take, the processes is likely to involve
significance testing and, by this, hypothesis testing under the hood.
For this reason, the line between the Analysis Methods alpha and other alphas is not always
that clear to a potential confusion for a user of the Scorecard Deck. For example, when the
Research Questions alpha achieves the Refined state (see Section 4.3.3.2), if the study is
hypotheses-driven, the questions would be formulated in terms of the hypotheses. Likewise, if
the Data alpha achieves the Envisioned state (see Section 4.3.1.1), this would mean that the
research is designed. This confusion was indeed noticed in the case study that evaluated the
Deck (see Section 5.2.3)  and because of that, the related scorecards were very significantly
reworked. Yet, this confusion is likely to not be fully remediable and can be observed elsewhere
 not only in the process of using the Scorecard Deck. A great example of that is the use of
terms classifier in Statistics circles and hypothesis in Computer Science circles for the same
concept (Wasserman, 2004, p.15).
Hence, instead of aiming at unachievable, the scorecards for the Analysis Methods alpha try to
foster thinking about the analysis methods in terms of research questions and research design
and to make some of the decisions that would otherwise go explicit and unnoticed implicit.
4.3.4.1 State 1. Selected
The first state of the Analysis Methods alpha is achieved when the methods are informed
to a point of possibility to make an initial selection (see Table 4.17). Informing the methods
4.3. CONTENT OF THE SCORECARDS 151
with the analysis design was of absolute importance in all the studied project, but most of all
in the evaluation of Shakespeare Lives. As discussed in Section 3.2.5.3, the research design of
that project was characterised by a mismatch between the overarching question of the British
Councils interest ("Is our performance good?") and the practical impossibility to find or construct
benchmark data against which the programmes performance could be evaluated. The use of
content analysis as a method to analyse social media posting about the programme  and the
way in which this mode was used  was, partially, a response to this mismatch. By analysing
big samples of postings through the lens of a detailed, rigid, closed coding framework that
nevertheless focused on qualitative aspects of the response, it was easier to draw comparisons
between responses to the programme in different countries and at different points in time and
thus use those as internal benchmarks without being distracted by the a priori varying volumes
in reaction to event of different types. This example also shows that the qualitative analysis
methods from traditional social science  such as content analysis in this case  can be perfectly
applicable to new forms of data if align with the research purposes.
Regarding the trade-offs between labour-intensive and computationally-intensive analysis,
another good example comes from the same project. As discussed in Sections 3.2.5 and
3.2.1.3, analysis of tone of the social media posts was performed both computationally through
sentiment analysis using SentiStrength (Thelwall, 2017) and through manual coding of data. The
distributions of sentiment shown by both methods were quite similar. From this perspective,
using a computationally-intensive method offered a better value-for-effort. However, if only
the sentiment analysis was used, the team would likely not discover the reason why in many
postings the tone had to be neutral, or weak on both positivity and negativity if using the
sentiment analysis terminology (the reason is discussed in Section 3.2.5.3). Besides, other
categorisations of data that were coded by analysts alongside tone would not be there, so the
depth of insight available from data would be questionable. There is no universal solution for
what is better or worse in this trade-off  it will depend on the research purposes, size of data and
available resources  yet the option of using labour-intensive analysis, even if similarly purposed
and sufficiently accurate computational analysis methods are available, should still be at least
considered. As a side note, the use of SentiStrength was an example of infrastructure suggesting
analysis modes  if there was no ready software solution for sentiment analysis tailored to social
media data, this analysis method would not be tried at all.
4.3.4.2 State 2. Piloted
The fieldwork suggests that refinement of the particularities of the analysis methods in social data
science projects happens iteratively in the process of analysis itself, hence the next state of the
Analysis Methods alpha is achieved when the outcomes of pilot analysis are evaluated to further

ANALYSIS METHODS:
SELECTED
Candidate analysis methods are identified and selected.
Research design consid-
The analysis methods are informed by what kinds of answers
the outlined research questions seek and what the envisioned
data aim to represent.
Background research
Experience of similar research projects and relevant method-
ological advice have been studied.
Relevant techniques con-
sidered
The analytical techniques  either specific ones or families
of techniques  that correspond with the research questions
are identified.
Qualitative analysis
methods considered
It is established if pure qualitative methods are appropriate
for some of the analysis.
Human/computer trade-
offs considered
For the planned analytical pipelines, it is considered which
parts would most benefit from being labour intensive vs.
computationally intensive and what is the role of human-in-
the-loop.
Infrastructural
resources considered
Feasibility of setting infrastructure to execute each method
is considered.
Triangulation and com-
plementation considered
The analysis methods allow cross-validating and enhancing
the findings derived with each other.
Evaluation criteria
agreed
It is known how to measure the level of confidence in the
results produced by each method.
Research Questions:
Outlined
The research questions are formulated as a broad framework
that sets the direction for the project.

for the project needs.

inform the analysis methods and the relevant adjustments are made (see Table 4.18). An example
of refinement that focused on method validity can be found in the Shakespeare Lives project,
as on the early stages of the project the team had to continuously adjust how the researchers
coded social media postings for whether their authors acknowledged the British values  i.e.
the image of the UK that the British Council aimed to promote (see Section 3.2.5.1). Another
example of a validity concern, which was not really tackled, is found in the experience of Hit
List production. One of the interviewed producers did not agree with the employed way to chart
the posts of news media on Facebook, as, according to her, the weighted sum approach taken by
analyst to aggregating different engagement metrics was not perfectly valid to the underlying
question of which stories caused the largest number of social media interactions (see Section
3.3.5.1).
Ensuring sufficiency of the research methods was something that did not require that much
4.3. CONTENT OF THE SCORECARDS 153
iterative refinement in the observed case studies  presumably due to the past experience of the
involved members in similar work. For example, in an earlier Open University research project
that I had participated in as a quantitative analyst (Willis et al., 2015) and that was partially
funded by the BBC, our sub-team tried to assess the role of BBCs Twitter accounts in the overall
Twitter conversations surrounding London Olympics 2012 using the social networking analysis
methods. While in our analysis we did manage to arrive at some relevant findings, the question
of what could be done differently was left largely unanswered because we did not combine the
social network analysis with qualitative content analysis methods that could shed a light on the
kinds of Twitter behaviour that caused the most response.
Finally, while in the observed projects I did not encounter situations when the resource load
chosen analysis modes created was prohibitively high (presumably because the employed
methods were relatively computationally cheap to begin with and the labour-intensive methods
did not require to be executed within short time frames), there were cases when the involved
computational methods required accurate planning and scheduling to be exercised on time  the
initial data aggregation and analysis in the Hit List production being the primary example (see
Section 3.3.6.2). Should the designed methods have been a bit more computationally involved,
it would have most likely required to either simplify them or to invest in higher performance
infrastructure.
ANALYSIS METHODS:
PILOTED
The methods are pilot-tested and necessary adjustments are
implemented.
Validity assessed It is assessed whether the outcomes of method applications
are valid for the research question they aim to address.
Sufficiency ensured It is made sure that all research questions are addressed by
at least one method.
Resource load estimated It is seen if execution of some methods consumes too much
computational or labour resources.
Adjustments made Reflecting on the observed results, the method selection and
implementation are adjusted.

4.3.4.3 State 3. Executed
This state of the Analysis Methods alpha is achieved when a certain iteration of analysis of
quality assured data is finished, with all the required efforts applied and the required outputs
stored. It was normally accompanied by documenting the the analysis process. In the Hit List
project it was relevant because the Hit List had to be produced on a weekly basis. Therefore, if an
analyst got ill or otherwise could not perform their responsibilities on a particular week, without
154 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK: THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL
proper documentation finding a temporary replacement would be hard. In the Shakespeare Lives
and InfoMigrants project the documentation was first and foremost used in reporting, as the
projects key stakeholders should have had an opportunity to challenge the teams methodology.
The evaluation of outcomes took various forms depending on project and analysis method. In
the Hit List production, the goodness of the supervised classifier used to for filtering UK tweets
in Twitter data was measured using a procedure typical for machine learning  the classifier was
applied to test data not used for training the classifier but containing the country labels. Since the
classes were highly imbalanced (i.e. there were much less UK tweets than non-UK tweets), a
simple accuracy measure did not make the cut. Thus, precision and recall were used instead. As
discussed in Section 3.3.3.3, the derived metrics implied that the analyst could not be confident in
the classification outcomes enough to use the filtered list of hashtags without critical judgement.
In turn, the quality of this critical judgement  i.e. of additional filtering out the non-UK topics 
could not be formally evaluated, so it was instead sanity-checked by the production team.
The method reproducibility condition is derived from Goodman et al. (2016). The specificity of
the term is to avoid confusion with many other R-dimensions (De Roure et al., 2011), three of
which  reproducibility, replicability and repeatability  are known to cause the most confusion
(Plesser, 2018). Method reproducibility implies the possibility to rerun the same analysis over
the same data to test whether this leads to the same research results  in other words, it requires
research workflow preservation (De Roure et al., 2011). The suggested scorecard condition
retains the gist of this definition.
Assuring method reproducibility, in principle, implies that methodologically stronger forms
of reproducibility can also be tested for, provided that there is sufficient documentation of
the analysis process (which is warranted by a different condition). By combining a preserved
workflow with an informed judgement on what each of its steps achieves and how it is motivated,
it is possible to configure other similarly purposed research pipelines, for example, to test whether
the specific implementations of the analysis methods or the specific analysis techniques chosen
influence the analysis outcomes. For this reason, no separate conditions concerning other forms
of reproducibility are listed in this alpha.
Finally, it is worth noting that the interest in reproducibility beyond that of method reproducibility
may often be limited in social data science as many social data science projects do descriptive
rather than inferential research (see De Vaus (2001) for further discussion of the difference)
 new forms of data allow to characterise researched subjects in an unprecedented manner
and thus are valuable for reach descriptions. Descriptive research was at the core the studied
project as well and took form of characterisation of topic popularity in the Hit List project and
4.3. CONTENT OF THE SCORECARDS 155
characterisation of engagement in the Shakespeare Lives and InfoMigrants evaluation projects.
Even when inferences were derived in the form of recommendations for stakeholders in the
latter two projects, those were programme- or initiative-specific and not meant to be necessarily
applicable to larger populations (i.e. to other similar programmes and initiatives should they ever
occur).

4.3.4.4 State 4. Extended
As much as research questions, new analysis methods also got proposed after critique on the last
iteration was formulated (see Table 4.20). For example, in the InfoMigrants evaluation after the
first year it became clear that the interpretation of the quantitative findings on the engagement
with the programme that our team provided did not add much value to what the InfoMigrants
own marketing team could obtain with commercial software  and, crucially, it was not very
revealing about what had been done good and what not so good. Hence, in the second year
the team went for discourse analysis of the comments on the InfoMigrants Facebook pages in
addition. Interestingly, a new research question was also posed alongside, since it could be
conveniently addressed by discourse analysis instead  the team was tasked to access the quality
of debate (Habermas, 1991) unfolding on those pages.

4.3.5 Artefacts
4.3.5.1 State 1. Outlined
The first state of the Artefacts alpha is achieved when there is understanding of the form that
project artefacts can take, but not necessarily what their contents would be. For example, the
artefacts outline may take a form of agreement between the project team and the key stakeholder
(either the funder or the beneficiary). In the Shakespeare Lives evaluation project, such an
agreement included the description of responsibilities delegated to the three project strands (see
Section 3.2.1) in terms of type of desired artefacts  language reports, visual analysis reports, a
Cultural Value report, infographics and data visualisations, and a single web-site that would serve
as a platform to host the other artefact types. The Wire Free Production company concluded a
similar agreement with the BBC Radio 5 live in terms of delivering a weekly episodes of the
Hit List show. Each of the artefacts mentioned in those two agreements reflected a particular
research goal  be that informing British Council on the public engagement that their programme
had provoked in different countries or informing the British audience on the most discussed
stories.
4.3.5.2 State 2. Envisioned
By contrast with the previous state, the artefacts can only be considered envisioned if there is a
specific vision both for form and content. For example, for the language researchers reports in
Shakespeare Lives, this vision could be described as follows: a report should include a section on
content analysis (based on Twitter and/or Seana Weibo data) and online ethnograpgy (based on
observing Facebook/VK.com). Specifically for the content analysis section, it should go through
the key human-coded variables, showing their distributions and displaying their relationships
(thus not only reflecting project goals, but also providing findings in response to the research
questions) and providing example tweets / Weibo posts to illustrate the key point. Such specified
vision thus poses requirements for the artefacts  although these requirements cannot always
be very precisely formulated. The detailed vision for artefacts can also include the vision for

artefacts of interim use  e.g. in the Hit List production, it would specify the contents of chart
spreadsheet prepared by the analyst for the production team (see Section 3.3.5.2). Finally, the
envisioned artefacts should strive to capture interests of multiple stakeholder groups, including
the underrepresented ones. For example, the sheet inclusion of VK.com into consideration while
working on the Shakespeare Lives project was motivated by the desire to satisfy local branches
of British Council  in this case, the British Council Russia in particular (see Section 3.2.4.1).

4.3.5.3 State 3. Supported
The Supported state is achieved when the social data science project as a whole can support
the actual process of creating the artefacts. As such, the primary practical purpose of considering
this state separately is in making sure that all the prerequisites of artefact creation, including
the understanding of how to create them, are in place and that the resources are sufficient (see
Table 4.23). The specific list of prerequisites is quite natural  understanding how to achieve
the artefacts means that the work must be prepared, the resource base in terms of team, sources
of data and infrastructure should be in sufficient state and the the understanding of how it all
falls under ethical and legal compliance must be firm. In a way, the precise list of prerequisite
alphas and their particular states may be flexible, but I believe it is important to have those points
in the project when the team member is forced to remind themselves about all the aspects of
the project together  and it is more dictated by the SEMATs philosophy of kernel approach to
project management (Jacobson et al., 2013) than necessarily particular episodes in the fieldwork.
ARTEFACTS:
SUPPORTED
The team is ready to engage in the research work that
ultimaly results in the artefacts.
Path to artefacts estab-
lished
It is clear how the work planned for the project can lead to
the artefacts.
Resources are sufficient The available research resources (data sources, infrastructure
and compliance) are sufficient for the planned work.
Team: Formed There is a sufficient number of engaged team members to
progress towards the teams goals.
Work: Prepared The conditions required for the work to start are met.
Compliance: Strategised The team members share a clear understanding of how they
can achieve ethical and legal compliance.
Data Sources: Selected A firm decision on the use of each data source is made.
Infrastructure: Demon-
strable
A prototype executable version of the infrastructure is avail-
able and demonstrates that the architecture is fit for purpose
and supports testing.
Table 4.23: Artefacts: Supported. Conditions and prerequisites.
4.3.5.4 State 4. Iterated
The fieldwork suggests that in a project with high degree of stakeholder involvement artefacts
may get into a cycle of many iterations after the main analytical work is already done. In
Shakespeare Lives and InfoMigrants projects, the draft reports that the teams had prepared
got scrutinised by the British Council and the InfoMigrants editorial team respectively. They
would provide feedback, question particular findings and suggest additional angles for their
interpretation.
4.3. CONTENT OF THE SCORECARDS 159
Prerequisites of this state may again seem quite self-explanatory in that a team is likely not to
get to this state without performing and being in control of the work they have to complete. It
is noteworthy that prerequisites include execution of analysis methods rather than answering
research questions. There are two reasons for this: (a) research questions can hardly be considered
answered until the interpretation of findings is agreed by all key involved parties  and this is a
property of the next state of the Artefacts alpha and (b) not all analysis outcomes represented
in artefacts necessarily answer any particular research question. For example, the outcomes on
Strand 3 of the Shakespeare Lives were illustrative (and thus enriched the artefacts), but could
hardly be considered findings by themselves (see Section 3.2.1.3).

4.3.5.5 State 5. Released
The last state of the Artefacts alpha is achieved when the finalised project artefacts are made
available to the project stakeholders (see Table 4.25). The artefacts should meet the requirements
 although, as the fieldwork suggests, in social data science the requirements are often quite
broad and open; therefore, meeting them in practice means that the stakeholders are happy with
a particular artefact iteration and do not provide more feedback. The finalised artefacts must
incorporate the answers to research questions. Within the studied projects, the answers were
included in numerous ways  from being postulated as findings and recommendations in the
Shakespeare Lives project reports to being presented as the Hit List show on radio. Beyond
the fieldwork, a crucial form of incorporating answers into project artefacts takes a form of
decision-support systems and applications, with recommender systems being one of the most
common examples.

4.3.6 Compliance
The Compliance alpha was informed by the experience of all case study, including (and
predominantly by) that of the project on studying the Dark Net criminal markets (see Section
3.4.2). As already mentioned, this project was also used for the internal evaluation of the
Scorecard Deck (see Section 5.2). To keep evaluation as separate from gathering primary
evidence as possible, no drafts of the Compliance scorecards were presented in the Dark Net
project. To compensate for the omission of formative internal evaluation for this alpha, I have
heavily grounded the scorecards in literature.
4.3.6.1 State 1. Considered
The first state is achieved when the ethical and compliance issues associated with a social data
science project and informed by its goals are identified (see Table 4.26). The types of research
risks are derived from Martin and Christin (2016), who identifies groups of risks associated with
various parties involved with the project. The Dark Net project team used this paper to distinguish
key areas of concern that had to be dealt with. Some of those risks had legal implications, as
accessing data from Dark Net implied needing to take precautions that no of them would contain
materials possession of which is illegal by itself (e.g. images of child abuse). But even when
dealing with legal data, there still are applicable legal frameworks. For example, the General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) limits researchers rights to store their data on European
residents on servers outside Europe (European Parliament, 2016).
Compliance with the terms and conditions of the selected data source and elements of the
4.3. CONTENT OF THE SCORECARDS 161
technical infrastructure was relevant for most studied projects. Indeed, the online platforms
whose data were employed in the projects all had policies restricting use of acquired data 
e.g. the Twitter Developer Policy (Twitter, 2017) and the Facebook Platform Policy (Facebook,
2018b). The same can be said about the employed data analysis tools. For example, Sysomos
sets limits on dissemination of data visualisations that it provides to limited and insignificant
excerpts (Sysomos, 2015)  although in practice these limitations did not affect the work on
the Shakespeare Lives evaluation, as the project only employed Sysomos for data acquisition
(see Section 3.2.6.2). As will be shown further (see Section 4.3.6.3), practical implementation of
terms and conditions of data sources and technologies is often a compromise (Voss et al., 2016).
Finally, as shown in Section 2.3, the public discussion of ethics and compliance in social data
science is ever evolving, and a researcher could be advised to follow it not only to comply with
public expectations, but possibly also to discover ethical implications of their work that they
have failed to think about themselves.
4.3.6.2 State 2. Guided.
To progress a projects compliance to this state, the team members should inform themselves
on the relevant best practices, guidelines and advice that should be applicable to their project
given the scope of its compliance issues (see Table 4.27). The guidance may be professional,
such as the currently developed IEEE standard on Algorithmic Bias Considerations (IEEE, 2017)
or governmental or intergovernmental, such the Universal ethical code for scientists in the UK
(Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, 2017). The guidance may also come
from the organisation(s) hosting the team and from the project stakeholders. For example, in the
Dark Net project, even though the team members were thorough in their consideration of the
compliance issues on their own, knowledge of the institutional requirements could have allowed
for a quicker project start (see Section 3.4.2.4). Besides, in one of his earlier projects, the PI of
the Dark Net study employed good compliance practices suggested another researcher team in
the field, Barratt (2011) (see Bancroft and Reid, 2016).
4.3.6.3 State 3. Strategised
Strategising compliance in a social data science project involves elaborating on concrete measures
that have to be in the project (see Table 4.28). In the Dark Net study, this required balancing
complex interests of explicit and tacit stakeholders who represented different groups of society
 from law enforcement to cryptomarket participants (see Section 3.4.2.2). Additionally, we
had to develop risk management procedures to protect ourselves and out project infrastructure
from possible reactions from the marketplaces in response to our scraping attempts (see Section

COMPLIANCE:
CONSIDERED
It is identified which ethical and legal concerns the project
raises.
Research risks identified There is an initial understanding of how achieving research
goals may cause harm for the studied groups and individuals,
for the research team and for the key stakeholder groups.
Data sources compliance
considered
For the identified potential data sources, there is an un-
derstanding of the conditions on which the researchers
may acquire, use and share the data, and disseminate data
products.
Technologies compliance
considered
For the identified candidate technologies, there is an under-
standing of the conditions on which the team can deploy
them, share access to them and disseminate products of their
deployment.
Legal requirements con-
sidered
Common law context relevant to social data science projects
and to the specific topic (e.g. data protection acts) is
considered.
Current discourse con-
sidered
The team is familiar with the recent ethical and other
compliance controversies, scandals and generally hot topics
in the fields related to their proposed research topic and
research methodology.

lated
Potential goals of the social data science project are formu-
lated.

3.4.2.3).
As can be seen, the developed policies required strict, disciplined following on behalf of the team
members. That could not be achieved without a shared understanding of them. To achieve it, our
team had many meetings specifically on the compliance issues. Those meetings allowed us to
both discuss these issues conceptually and coach each other on the particularities of implementing
them. We wrote down the instructions or using the emerging compliance infrastructure and went
through several iterations of ethical statements, thus forming a corpus of compliance statements.
As mentioned above, compliance with license agreements was a concern in all studied projects.
However, the project teams often made a decision to follow the spirit of those license agreements
rather than the letter, especially when considering terms of conditions of online platforms that
were used as data sources. The license terms were arguably often written with particular use of

Table 4.27: Compliance: Guided. Conditions and prerequisites.
data in mind. For example, the Twitter Developer Policy (2017) forbids any transformations of
content received via any Twitter API, including translation. For the Shakespeare Lives project,
where the Twitter data analysts formed a multilingual team with each researcher focusing on a
particular language, this term effectively forbade the researchers to translate the user biographies
that had been collected with the Twitter REST API (see Section 3.2.6.1). If the team had adhered
to the Policy, some of the qualitative findings could have not been shared neither within the
team nor with the stakeholders. Yet, this term rather seems to be aimed at developers of web
applications that who display Twitter content to their users, as Twitter may be interested in
preserving the original look of its content. Therefore, the Shakespeare Lives team members did
not abstain from translating a user bio when required; however, they took a screenshot of its
original version and put a textual translation nearby.
Following the license terms is often also practically impossible. The same Twitter Developer
Policy prescribes to delete data if they represent content that has been deleted or otherwise taken
164 CHAPTER 4. SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK: THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL
out of public access on Twitter as soon as reasonably possible. Within the Hit List production
this effectively meant never. Indeed, the tweets were collected in real time through the Twitter
Streaming API as part of 1% sample (see Section 3.3.3.1). Therefore, the tweets that would
later be deleted or by users whose accounts would later be suspended had equal chances to be
acquired as those tweets that would remain intact forever. Tracking the fate of the individual
acquired tweets would have meant sending repeated requests to the Twitter REST API that had
been empirically found severely rate-limited. Hence, the only measure that was taken in Hit List
production to comply with this policy element was to only use individual tweets for usual modes
of analysis that based on aggregation of data. If the Hit List presented was ever to read a tweet
during the show and if the tweet was publicly unavailable at the moment, she would make such a
caveat.
COMPLIANCE:
STRATEGISED
The team members share a clear understanding of how they
can achieve ethical and legal compliance.
Guidance internalised The team has critically assessed the available guidance and
adapted it to their views and to the projects curcumstances.
Legal and license
requirements factored in
The team has worked out how the legal requirements and
license conditions can be met within the project.
Society interests factored
The team has made sure that the project is sufficiently aligned
with the wider society interests.
Need in consent evalu-
There is understanding of whether the project will at any
moment require explicit consent to participate from the
studied individuals.
Understanding shared The team is not only in a principle agreement over the project
compliance, but actually shares understanding of how to deal
with specific compliance issues.
Compliance statements
formulated
All the required compliance statements such as the ethical
statements and the internal compliance policies are formu-
lated, strongly preferably in writing.
Table 4.28: Compliance: Strategised. Condition. No prerequisites specified.
4.3.6.4 State 4. Progressed
This state of the Compliance alpha effectively represents taking initial actions on all the
decisions made while developing compliance strategy (see Table 4.29). If a project team has
formulated an ethical statement, the team has to submit this statement for ethical review. If they
have designed a compliance infrastructure, they have to construct this infrastructure. In practice
surely progression towards these two states often happens simultaneously. As mentioned above
(see Section 4.3.6.3), the Dark Net project team put the infrastructure and the models of its use

together simultaneously. However, conceptually Strategised and Progressed are two distinct
states, and it is valuable to remind researchers who use the Scorecard Deck to act upon their
decisions. Additionally, the to achieve this state a research team may have to actually adjust their
activities and align research practices with the developed compliance strategy. For example, in
the Dark Net project we decided to use Tor to scrape clear net website data, even though it was
not technically necessary, to protect our identities (see Section 3.4.2.3).

4.31). This state is mostly informed by the same background research that has informed Section
4.3.6.1. If the public discourse on compliance and ethics of doing social data-driven research is
continuously morphing and the legal and license requirements are adjusting accordingly  the
change to terms of use of Facebook Graph API because of the Cambridge Analytica scandal
is an example (see Section 2.1.2)  being compliant with the norms at the moment does not
automatically imply maintaining compliance consistently.
At the moment of writing, it seems like many changes in discourse on ethics and their practical
implications could have been forecasted and appropriate responses could have been developed.
However, this may be hindsight bias (Christensen-Szalanski and Willham, 1991). It is still
undeniable though that some other changes to compliance norms can be anticipated. For
example, the GDPR European Parliament (2016) came into effect only in 2018, almost 2 years
after it had been developed and published. Therefore, any research team whose data treatment
were affected by GDPR should have had enough time to prepare for the changes.

5CHAPTER FIVEEVALUATION OF SOCIALDATA SCIENCESCORECARD DECK
In the previous chapter I provided an overview of the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck and
linked its contents to the fieldwork discussed in Chapter 3. In this chapter, I would like to report
on the evaluation of the Scorecard Deck, which constitutes the last piece of research undertaken
for this thesis.
Borrowing the terminology from the field of performance measurement in education, the
evaluation seeks both summative and formative assessment (Wholey, 1996; Taras, 2008) of the
Scorecard Deck. As discussed in Section 3.1, the process of informing a tool with ethnography
is often met with a range of certain criticisms. Summative feedback would allow to see whether
the associated limitations have been surpassed so that the scorecards actually generalise to other
social data science projects and are capable of adding value to those. Formative feedback, in
turn, would play an even more important role of helping to make the Scorecard Deck better.
The Scorecard Deck provides scope for future iterations  its content can be easily expanded by
addition of new alphas and revision of their states and conditions. There are multiple strands
of further work on the Scorecard Deck that lie beyond the scope of this thesis (see Section 6.1).
The evaluation can provide direction to such further developments. Given these considerations, I
can proceed to introduce and justify the chosen evaluation methodology.
170 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
5.1 Methodology
Conducting an evaluation of the Social Data Science Deck requires paying attention to several
specific features of the subject matter. By its very nature, the Scorecard Deck is a multi-
component tool that is designed to provide long-term benefits for social data science projects.
Those benefits may be, amongst others, a shared understanding in an interdisciplinary team,
increased research quality, ethical and responsible research conduct and greater consideration
of needs of various stakeholder groups including the tacit ones. All of these are problematic
constructs that are not always directly observable. An attempt to reduce them to a set of
measurable variables and to generally base the evaluation on quantitative measurements would
therefore inevitably lead to low construct validity (Smith, 2005)  the findings would not represent
the phenomena of interest. It is a lot more productive to instead ask the questions of how the
potential benefits of the Scorecard Deck may be manifest in practice, how the specific context of
a social data science project may affect the scorecards value, and how the scorecards can be
further improved. All this calls for qualitative research methods.
Furthermore, an attempt to evaluate the Scorecard Deck in a highly controlled environment, e.g.
using some predefined scenario for how a social data science project unfolds will lead to low
external validity (Siegmund et al., 2015), i.e. a lack of transferability of findings to often very
different settings (Polit and Beck, 2010). First, using a standardised scenario would understate
the variety of social data science project. Second, even if a set of different scenarios is employed
instead, those would bear a high risk of being too schematic. Uncertainties are a fundamental
component of a research process (Grabe, 2005) and it is hard to represent those in an artificially
constructed  and reasonably (for the purposes of a controlled evaluation) short  scenario.
The evaluation should instead seek to apply the scorecards in the context of naturally evolving
real-world social data science projects.
The considerations above suggest that a traditional experimental evaluation design, despite their
strong internal validity would not be appropriate for the task at hand (Lazar, 2010). Instead,
arguably the most robust approach to evaluating the Deck would in principle be employing a
number of in-depth case studies with each case being a thoroughly studied social data science
project that is managed with the help of the Deck. If the number of the cases is sufficiently
large and their settings are sufficiently varied, the findings can have strong construct validity
as they would lead to deep understanding of the Decks merits and limitations while retaining
both internal validity through triangulation of results received with different methods and
from different setting (e.g. team meetings versus individual use) and external validity and
generalisability through cross-case synthesis of findings (Yin, 2013; Diefenbach, 2008).
5.1. METHODOLOGY 171
That said, practical feasibility of such an approach is questionable, as social data science projects
often take months to years. Moreover, in the face of a very unlikely, but still existing chance
the Scorecard Deck could turn out to be detrimental to social data science projects, it seemed
irresponsible to suggest to use it in a large number of real-world research projects until its value
is somehow validated. As a result, I opted instead to use two different evaluation modes that
are each feasible to execute and, when used in conjunction, harness most of the benefits of the
multiple case study approach.
The first round of evaluation was depth-oriented and consisted of a single case study (see
Section 5.2). Similarly to the case studies discussed earlier in this thesis, I took part in this
project as a participant observer. During my three months in this capacity, our team used the
Scorecard Deck for different purposes (to clarify the project goals, to identify key gaps and to
track progress) and in different settings (in a team meeting, solely by the principle investigator
and solely by myself). This allowed me to triangulate observed effects of the scorecards in
various contexts and also to capture the how the use of the Deck was evolving as the project was
progressing and as the team members were getting more experienced with the tool. I was also
able to clarify and validate the findings through a final interview with the principal investigator.
The feedback gathered through the case study demonstrated the value of the Scorecard Deck in a
project that was significantly different in its goals and set-up from the ones used to inform the
Deck. The findings also suggested a range of improvements to the tool that were implemented
in-between the evaluation rounds.
The second round of evaluation was breadth-oriented and consisted of a series of nine
interviews with experts in social data science. This round compensates for the limitations of
the single case approach. It shows the Decks applicability to- and potential value for social
data science projects that take place in a wider variety of settings. During the interviews,
the respondents were asked to retrospectively apply the scorecards for one or more alphas to
one of their past social data science projects, or to generally talk about the aspects of one of
their past projects that were covered by the Deck. In that, the interviews, while sharing some
structural similarities, were highly reactive to an interviewees responses and as such fitted the
bill of being an adaptive qualitative research method. This allowed me to harness the value
of probes (Boyce and Neale, 2006, p. 5)  questions that ask a respondent to reflect more
deeply and critically on a previously raised point. It also allowed me to use the experience of
past interviews to inform subsequent ones. Such continuous question refinement, while it may
be seen as a methodological flaw within quantitative evaluation methods, becomes a sign for
progress [towards] an increasingly better and deeper knowledge in qualitative data collection
(Diefenbach, 2008, p. 877). Finally, the approach taken allowed to make use of real-world
172 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
scenarios of social data science projects that stemmed from the respondents themselves and thus
did not suffer from sketchiness and oversimplification.
Now that the two evaluation modes are introduced and their complementary nature is discussed,
I will proceed to discuss each of those, starting chronologically with the in-depth evaluation.
5.2. IN-DEPTH EVALUATION: APPLYING THE DECK IN A SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE PROJECT 173
5.2 In-depth Evaluation: Applying the Deck in a Social Data
Science Project
The first round of the Scorecard Deck evaluation was performed through studying the use of
this tool for managing a social data science project studying the resilience of cyber-criminal
marketplaces. Some aspects of this project have already been covered in Section 3.4.2. In
accordance with the terminology introduced in that section, I will further call it the Dark Net
study (or the Dark Net project. The project was hosted in the University of Edinburgh and was
led by Dr Bancroft  a social scientist with a long-standing research interest in the social life of
substance users (cf. Bancroft, 2009) and a more recent interest in online trade in illicit goods (in
particular, but not exclusively, drugs, cf. Bancroft and Reid, 2016). Besides Dr Bancroft, the
project team included Dr Alex Voss (the supervisor of this thesis) and myself from the computer
science side.
The project had been funded by an ESRC Impact Grant several months before I joined the
research team. According to the grant application form, the projects primary objectives were to
study how cyber-criminal marketplaces react to law enforcement interventions (e.g. marketplace
shutdowns or major vendor arrests) and other disruptions (e.g. large-scale scams), to elicit the
social and technical factors that allow such marketplaces to be resilient to the interventions (i.e.
to quickly restore the total volume and frequency of trade across the popular marketplaces) and
to ultimately aid law enforcement in prioritisation of their investigations. The work on the project
was planned to be carried out in close cooperation with a particular partnering law enforcement
body that provided a letter of support for the grant application with a promise to aid the project
both in cash through financing the research activities and in kind through investing time of one
the bodys employees.
Unfortunately, the impact partner failed to follow up on their initial promise of support. As a
result, even though some pilot development work on the tools for acquiring data from the Dark
Net was carried out, the start of the substantive research work had to be shifted by the project
investigators several times in anticipation of resuming contact with the law enforcement body. At
a certain moment of time, the pressure of the reporting deadlines imposed by the Impact Grant
motivated the investigators to initiate the research in absence of the partners involvement. At
that time, among other things, the investigators included me into the team as a part-time research
assistant and, as I had had a chance to briefly advertise the idea of scorecards to Dr Bancroft and
to attract his interest, agreed to attempt using the Scorecard Deck to manage the project. The
challenging project circumstances made the Dark Net study an excellent case for evaluation of
the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck. Indeed, they allowed us to use the Scorecard Deck not
174 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
only in tracking the ongoing progress, but also in setting up the work. Our team had to effectively
redesign the study so that we could progress towards impact even if the partner organisation
would not join us, while also being constrained by time scales and budget.
Another factor that contributes to the value of the Dark Net project as an evaluation case study is
that it significantly differed in its key characteristics from the projects employed to inform the
Scorecard Deck. The relative flexibility of the Dark Net projects goals can be juxtaposed with
quite a clear direction that the previous projects enjoyed: in those, the work had to contribute to
the creation of specific artefacts (be that multiple evaluation reports or a weekly radio show) and
to address the needs of specific key stakeholders (be that consultancy customers or a broadcasting
company). The subject matter by itself is a substantive difference: studying evidence of criminal
activities raises many specific issues, some of which have already been covered in Section 3.4.2.
The nature of the data and what interactions they represented were also different: the other
projects mostly focused on social media data that reflected user interactions with some online
content. The Dark Net project, in contrast, focused on marketplace data (such as transaction
counts and reviews) that reflected the markets buyer interactions with particular buyers and
products. The Dark Net project also employed forum data that represented extended, tightly-
connected conversations. Given all the above, if the Scorecard Deck was to be found an effective
tool in the Dark Net case study, that would strongly suggest that the scorecards do not overfit to
the projects that informed their design.
NB: before starting the discussion, I would like to remind readers that the scorecards were
refined after the Dark Net study. The interesting major changes will be discussed in detail, while
the minor and trivial ones such as changes to wording or splitting/merging consecutive states
within an alpha may be left without a mention for brevity and narrative consistency. Either way,
readers should not be surprised if they encounter a mention of an alpha, state or condition that
do not entirely match the contents of the Deck presented in Section 4.3 and Appendix A.
5.2.1 Shaping the Research Goals
Even though throughout the course of the Dark Net case study our team systematically worked
through the scorecards for most alphas, it was the Research Goals alpha whose associated
scorecards provoked the most extensive discussions and to which we returned most often. The
scorecards associated with this alpha were initially worked through at the first team meeting that
I participated in. At that time, I had only a vague understanding of the research area in general
and of the project state. I had an impression that its overall design and goals had been already
firmly set and expected the investigators to quickly talk through the scorecards for several key
alphas and thus introduce me to the project. Counter to my expectations, the discussion that was
5.2. IN-DEPTH EVALUATION: APPLYING THE DECK IN A SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE PROJECT 175
inspired by the Research Goals scorecards took almost an hour and a half of that team meeting
and involved making several crucial research decisions.
5.2.1.1 Research problem and stakeholder interests
As the first scorecard  Research Goals: Idenfied  suggested, we started the discussion by
spelling out the problem that the research aimed to solve. Dr Bancroft suggested:
I think the problem and is with that [...law enforcement bodies] can assess the
financial size of different operations [of the cybercriminal marketplaces], but that
doesnt really tell them much about the actual social dynamics [...such as] trust
relationships [that shape the] responses to law enforcement intervention.
As can be seen, this perspective closely matches that expressed in the Impact Grant proposal. It
is focused on the interests of the law enforcement partner and it suggests to solve specifically
their problem. As will be shown, the subsequent discussion did not completely change this
perspective, but it shaped and enhanced it. Another condition of the Research Goals: Identified
scorecard  identification of other stakeholder groups  came to play an important role in that.
Dr Voss contributed the first suggestion:
[W]e have some awareness of other stakeholders, which is the market participants.
You know, those are the ones I would [...] list for now.
Arguably, we (or at least Dr Bancroft and Dr Voss) had indeed implicitly recognised the market
participants as a stakeholder group and had acknowledged their interests at the back of our minds.
However, only after pronouncing this seemingly trivial idea explicitly and in the context of
working with the Research Goals scorecards, that we, as a team, actually started to consider
the interests of market participants as a major factor underpinning our research plans. This
is strongly indicated by the suggestions by Dr Bancroft and Dr Voss that followed almost
immediately:
I think wed also want to focus on reducing harm. So our findings will be about
reducing harm, rather than necessarily reducing the operation of the markets as such.
[...Law enforcement bodies] want evidence of the effect of their operation, so what
were doing isnt going to guide their operations. (Dr Bancroft)
Theres a recognition that the law enforcement have been good at disrupting, [but]
less good at assessing the impact of disruption. [...] The impact on disruption [and]
176 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
the impact on reduction [of harm are] two different things. [...] [Law enforcement]
are very good at doing one thing, but may be unsure whether theyre actually
achieving the latter. (Dr Voss)
One may notice that the latter quote resembles the earlier statement of the research problem, but
with an important change in focus: rather than casting the problem as the law enforcements
difficulties in preventing online trade, we cast it as difficulties in reducing harm.
It is worth noting that harm reduction, at least under the assumption of good policing, is an
explicit goal of law enforcement (Ratcliffe, 2015). Hence, this shift of focus did not suggest
abandoning the interests of the the impact partner whom Dr Bancroft and Dr Voss still expected
to resume contact with at that time. Moreover, it did not imply abandoning the objective of
modelling the social relationships exhibited by cryptomarket participants. For example, later
in the meeting, when discussing the Research questions outlined condition of the Research
Goals: Evaluated state, Dr Voss brought in the issue of operationalising the trust relationships:
We certainly have to find ways of describing trust relationships and how they
manifest themselves. So, I think that the link between trust and observable behaviour
will certainly be part of [...] the research questions. (Dr Voss)
That said, the shift of research problem interpretation towards harm reduction had several
interrelated consequences. The first one was in strengthening the common ground and shared
understanding of the proposed research. The ethos of harm reduction was something everyone of
us could (and was happy to) subscribe to. Moreover, Dr Bancrofts track record of research into
communities of drug users strongly hints at a chance that our research would have eventually
converged on harm reduction even if we had not had this project management session with the
scorecards. However, even if this is the case, establishing the focus on harm reduction without
the help of the scorecards would arguably have taken a longer time and it would possibly never
have been made explicit. Therefore, a lack of common understanding might have hindered
progress and project success. Incidentally, Dr Bancroft expressed a similar point of view in the
interview at the end of the case study:
I think it would be a lot more difficult to manage [this project] without this [tool].
[...] In my experience of any kind of team  even ones where [the members are
from] basically the same discipline but have got different elements to work on  its
really hard to coordinate [...] across the different parts of it. [...] It would be more
5.2. IN-DEPTH EVALUATION: APPLYING THE DECK IN A SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE PROJECT 177
difficult [...to understand] why particular priorities are being set. [...] I think having
something a bit more structured definitely helped.
Recognition of harm reduction as a priority early on in the team meeting allowed us to broaden the
scope of what we could consider good research outcomes. For example, Dr Bancroft suggested
that we could help law enforcement with modelling trust in cyber-criminal communities in such
a manner that would allow law enforcement to use trust to transmit harm reduction information
to people visiting the markets [...] early on [in their visits]. By that, he outlined the possibility
for our research to support non-disruptive law enforcement interventions. This line of discussion
reached its conclusion when we, in correspondence with the suggestions of the Research Goals:
Evaluated scorecard, attempted to formulate what the potential societal value of the Dark Net
project could be. We decided that the best-case achievement of our work would be a contribution
to a shared agreement among different stakeholders on the priorities in harm reduction activities
and, consequently, in interventions against cybercriminal marketplaces. In accordance with the
harm reduction ethos, such an agreement could potentially be useful for many stakeholder groups
 even the ones who could not be included in it:
I think, [...] realistically the agreement would be between [...] law enforcement
and the government, or between different parts of law enforcement. But the benefit
would also be for market participants. [...] It might give some guidance [...] to
platform operators as to [...] what to do not to get into the focus of law enforcement.
[...] They might change the rules under which their markets operate to avoid [...] the
complete take-down. (Dr Voss)
5.2.1.2 Public-facing impact
As far as focus on harm reduction broadened our the research goals and desired research
outcomes, it could also suggest a broader spectrum of ways to achieve impact. Given the
uncertainty regarding the impact partners involvement, identification of alternative impactful
activities was a priority for the Dark Net project. In the discussed team meeting, one idea on the
alternative pathway to impact initially stemmed from the continued discussion of the stakeholder
groups. Specifically, Dr Voss observed that the society as a whole were also a stakeholder in the
Dark Net project:
Society in general has got the interest in [...] good policing and reduction of
harm. And [since] we would claim that this is an impactful project, [...] its worth
[considering] this.
178 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
Although by itself this observation did not seem to require specific actions, the subsequent
discussion of the scorecards provoked some actionable suggestions. One condition of the
Research Goals: Demanded state required us to envision research artefacts that could be of
value for the stakeholders. At this moment, Dr Voss followed up on his prior observation by
suggesting to produce an impact report, which is different [...] from [both] the academic project
report and the report for law enforcement. Dr Voss suggested to use such an impact report
to kick-start dissemination of findings to the general public and Dr Bancroft supported this
suggestion:
Im thinking about [...making an] appearance [in regional media], where we [could]
talk about the project [and] tell the general public [...] what great things we have
achieved that make them safer. So, I think the impact report is not just a report [] it
should actually be a, well, kind of working document that prepares us [...] to achieve
and measure impact. (Dr Voss)
We need an impact case study, so we need some kind of documents to trace impact.
(Dr Bancroft)
Even though no particular details on how the impact report should look were discussed, Dr Voss
felt that the idea was valuable by itself:
Having that kind of thought planted earlier, I think, will then help us to [...] generate
impact and be prepared for [dissemination activities].
5.2.1.3 Reflecting on the research goals discussion
Before moving on to the analysis of scorecard use in other environments, I would like to reflect
on the overall experience of shaping research goals with their help.
First of all, it seems that the scorecards provoked the biggest sparks of creativity when the
discussed conditions were interlinking different alphas: even though we talked through the
Research Goals set of cards, the crucial conditions asked about artefacts and stakeholders. One
explanation for why such conditions were so effective is that they allowed to bring different
project aspects together and truly think about the project holistically. This is an important
notion, since some of the later observations showed the flip side of such conditions: annoying
redundancy (see Section 5.2.3.1). The need to balance these two concerns ultimately led to
introduction of the concept of prerequisites. Most cards in the current version of the Scorecard
Deck (see Section 4.3) have separate prerequisites and conditions.
5.2. IN-DEPTH EVALUATION: APPLYING THE DECK IN A SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE PROJECT 179
Second, it is interesting how gentle the learning curve of using the scorecards was, considering
that for both investigators it was the first time they actually used the tool. For example, the first
crucial suggestions about the stakeholders were made about 15 minutes into the meeting. This
observation is reflected by Dr Bancroft in the final interview:
I remember thinking back when I looked at [the Scorecard Deck], I got an instant
sense for what it is about. [...] It was very user-friendly from my perspective.
This does not mean that the scorecards require no introduction  at the end of the day, I was
actively involved in that first session and could thus steer the discussion when the investigators
showed hesitation. Yet, as the discussion progressed, this effectively became unnecessary. Again,
this observation is in line with Dr Bancrofts assessment:
I think, [...] you would need at least a session to go over, in some form, what [the
process of using the scorecards is] about, [...] which is totally acceptable. [...] Now
I would have had confidence in using [the scorecards on my own].
Third, in relation to the idea of producing an impact report, I would argue that the sheer process
of using the scorecards would be immensely useful. As Dr Bancroft pointed out in the interview:
Possibly the most enticing thing [about the scorecards] for me is [using them
to] translate qualitative research into a form that can be easily transmitted to
different audiences. [...] Theres a certain kind of subjective vagueness in a lot of
qualitative research. [...] I think that [...] a real problem [is] in how we translate and
communicate that there is actually some rigorous process. [...] Scorecards can be
very useful in that because they break down whats often a[n involved] process into
specific achievable points. [...Scorecards] can be used particularly to communicate
at the end of the project [...] what has actually being done there.
To further emphasise the value of scorecards for impact reporting, I would argue that the process
of using the scorecards in their spreadsheet implementation produced an important project artefact
by itself. Throughout the Dark Net project, we did not only use the scorecard spreadsheets to
assign progress scores to the conditions, but also provided interpretations for those conditions
and indicated what specifically had been achieved and what required further work. A quick skim
through these spreadsheets could therefore provide a reasonable overview of the project state.
Figure 5.1 shows an example spreadsheet from the projects scorecard deck.
180 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
5.2.2 Assessing Project State
The next session of using the scorecards in the Dark Net project was focused on assessment of the
projects overall state by working through several alphas. In this exercises, Dr Bancroft effectively
worked through the suggested scorecards alone: Dr Voss was absent in that meeting, and I
deliberately took an observational stance. This does not mean that I kept silent throughout the
process: if Dr Bancroft asked me to clarify the formulations of certain conditions or questioned
the logic of the scorecards, I discussed those issues with him. However, I restrained myself from
directing Dr Bancroft in his choices of alphas and states to evaluate and in his assessment of
projects progress towards particular conditions.
Within a one hour session, Dr Bancroft easily managed to revise the scorecards for the Research
Goals alpha and to go through the scorecards for the Research Questions, Data and
Research Methods alphas for the first time. Not only did he assess as many conditions as was
reasonable at that stage of project progression, but also talked through his thinking process, so
that I could then summarise it as notes. Figure 5.1 displays a screenshot of the filled-in scorecards
for two states of the Research Methods alpha and the marginal notes.
The commentary that Dr Bancroft provided to the scorecards was quite detailed and demonstrated
critical examination of the project circumstances. This suggests that even when used individually
by a project manager rather than as a discussion point in a team meeting, the scorecards can
foster reflexive thinking. For example, when revising the Research Goals alpha, Dr Bancroft
offered the following detailed account of risks associated with the project and enhanced it with
acknowledgement of potential countermeasures:
Primarily, the risks [are] interruption the data collection. [...] I think [thats a]
major risk of a darknet market being shut down. [...] If this happens what we have
to do probably either switch to a different market, or [...] go to the kind of secondary
evaluation by looking at the data [that is already scraped by] somebody else [and]
applying [...] our methods to that [data]. So, we would be looking more at the kind
of resilience modelling aspect of it. So, so there is a risk there, but its manageable.
The ease with which Dr Bancroft used the tool suggests that the logic of the Scorecard Deck
fitted his own conceptualisations of the research process. The feedback that Dr Bancroft provided
at the completion of the exercise confirms this and indicates that Dr Bancroft acknowledges the
value of the Deck as specifically a holistic management tool:
[The tool] nicely fits the kind of logic model that I use for designing research.
5.2. IN-DEPTH EVALUATION: APPLYING THE DECK IN A SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE PROJECT 181
182 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
I think it clarifies it quite well. [...] Overall I think [that] the splitting of [the
conditions] into the different components is quite logical and theres a clear rationale
for it, and theres fairly clear progression through the different stages as well. [...]
Its been a very useful process. I think it is particularly useful when we have
multidisciplinary interests at work and when weve got outside stakeholders, who
have to be coordinated with it. I think its [...] very helpful for envisaging the whole
project.
That being said, in the final interview of the case study Dr Bancroft provided an interesting
critique of how that particular exercise was set:
I think if you have a team project, they should be using [the scorecards] in [a] team
setting. [...] If you have a manager filling them in, it just seems rather didactic and
certainly alienating for people. [...] If its used in a team setting, it creates team
agreement.
This last point indicates that, in Dr Bancrofts assessment, the value of the Social Data Science
Scorecard Deck may transcend that of establishing mere shared understanding within a research
team and provide the sense of shared ownership of the research process. This is important at
the very least because the sense of ownership is linked to that of responsibility (Blau and Caspi,
2009) and thus may promote responsible research.
5.2.3 Identifying Issues for Revision
The use of the scorecards in the Dark Net project suggested a number of changes to the Scorecard
Deck. While most of the changes were trivial (e.g. changes in wording for particular conditions),
others significantly affected the contents of the Scorecard Deck and even some aspects of their
use. The following discussion will describe and provide motivation for those changes.
5.2.3.1 Introducing prerequisites
The version of the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck used in the Dark Net project, as much
as the original SEMAT Essence model (see Section 2.4.2), identified the state which each core
project aspect (alpha) has achieved solely by checking whether the states conditions are achieved.
Therefore, the only way to tie together different alphas was through introducing interlinking
conditions. Such conditions were not my invention and are in the SEMAT model as well. For
5.2. IN-DEPTH EVALUATION: APPLYING THE DECK IN A SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE PROJECT 183
example, the state Opportunity: Identified has a condition The other stakeholders who
share the opportunity have been identified (OMG, 2015, p. 30).
Section 5.2.1.3 suggests that, when working through the scorecards of a single alpha, the
interlinking conditions allow seeing this alpha as a part of the project as a whole and thus are
valuable. However, in the project assessment session, when Dr Bancroft went through multiple
alphas, the interlinking conditions gave raise to mild annoyance. For example, during that session
he encountered the Data alpha whose first condition was Research questions outlined, the
Research Methods alpha whose first condition was Broad research questions considered and
the Research Questions alpha that had an Outlined state  and all of those had already been
discussed to some degree during the first session with the scorecards, as the Research Goals
alpha also had a questions-related condition Encountering the same condition multiple times
leads to mechanical answering, while encountering a state that has been already considered as
a condition in a different alpha (as indeed happened with the Outlined state of Research
Questions) may lead to frustration in regard to whether the earlier discussion has been detailed
enough.
Dr Bancroft found this confusing. For example, when he encountered the Infrastructural
resources considered condition in the second state of the Research Methods alpha, he seemed
perplexed:
Infrastructural resources... (pause) So this [is] more asking about the practical
feasibility of it, [...but] its not under Infrastructure though. [...] My immediate
response is that it feels a little redundant [...], but I can see [why] you want to flag
it. [...] My instinct would be not to have it [as a condition], but maybe just cross-
reference that top-level text [from the Infrastructure card deck]. [...Because when
working through methods] people [would] think [...] more about the relationship
between their data and their questions obviously. And I think thats kind of a different
[...] thinking and a different mood.
In the interview after the case study, the issue of redundancy was the only serious criticism that
Dr Bancroft expressed and hinted at what would become the solution to it:
I think there is a little bit of redundancy and I didnt get a sense of it linking things.
[...] I wasnt sure why it was there. [...] A think that [...] a sense of project as a
whole could come from cross-linking in other ways potentially. [...] [For example,]
when youre off the Research Questions, [...] another category like Data [gets
updated]  like a traffic-light kind of system.
184 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
This traffic-light system takes the form of prerequisites, i.e. explicit requirements of achieving a
certain state in a different alpha in order to progress the current alpha. The majority of states
in the current version of the Scorecard Deck have prerequisites (see Section 4.3). In a printed
version of scorecards, the benefit of prerequisites is in explicit pointing out that this is not merely
a condition but a state of a different alpha. In a digital version (e.g. the interactive spreadsheet
implementation), the benefit is in that the scores for prerequisites can be automatically updated
and a user of the tool does not have to answer the same question twice.
One positive side-effect of turning redundant conditions into prerequisites was exposing the
states in the Scorecard Deck that did not produce sufficient numbers of conditions independent
from other alphas. For example, the old version of the Data: Envisioned state had only three
conditions to start with, and one of them, as hinted above, was actually a prerequisite. This
motivated me to engage with the fieldwork evidence again and to tease out the less obvious, but
truly independent conditions for many states. This made the Scorecard Deck even stronger.
5.2.3.2 From Research Methods to Analysis Methods
When developing the Research Methods alpha in the early version of the Deck, I had a feeling
that it was somehow weaker than the rest, but could not specify why exactly that was the case.
The realisation came from Dr Bancrofts critique that he expressed after working through the
first state of the alpha (see Figure 5.1). He was concerned with the use of terminology, as he
expected to see conditions more related to designing the study as a whole and making sure that it
was valid for the research questions, while instead he saw conditions regarding the choice of
analytical techniques to which data can be subjected:
Theres a slight difference between research design and method[s] and data
collection. [...] There [are] preliminary questions about the research design that
might be ones to add in. [...] So, you might want to have maybe a question about
[...] internal validity or external validity and with reference to underlying object is
studying. [...] Thats perhaps distinct: youve got those questions, and then youve
got [the] more practical questions about the methods, and then the process of data
collection itself.
This suggestion, coupled with the existence of a validity-related condition in the next state, made
me realise that the Research Methods alpha tried to be two things at once. It did put emphasis
on specifically the analysis methods, but also incorporated some conditions in relation to the
research design and validity  the ones Dr Bancroft referred to. However, most of the conditions
5.2. IN-DEPTH EVALUATION: APPLYING THE DECK IN A SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE PROJECT 185
in relation to those overarching issues, within the Decks model of research, naturally belonged
to either the Data or Research Questions alpha. As a result, I made a decision to reduce the
methods alpha to specifically the analysis methods and to give it a corresponding name, while
making sure that the questions of research design and validity appear earlier on in regard to more
appropriate alphas.
5.2.3.3 Allowing for more flexible progress tracking
Given my knowledge of the literature and the fieldwork, from the start of the Scorecard Decks
development I fully expected that this instrument will be used iteratively and with revisions of
already progressed conditions and states as and when appropriate. For this reason, I went one
step further than the original SEMAT model an intermediate level of condition achievement
between Yes and No  In progress. However, the Dark Net project showed that even that
was not enough. As evident from Figure 5.1, our team exhibited a strong tendency to answer
Yes to those conditions of which we had sufficient grasp. However, what exactly sufficed did
change over time. As a result, in a brief progress tracking session closer to the end of the case
study we revised many conditions that had already been ticked off, which did not seem quite
right. However, the idea that we should have been ticking those conditions as In progress did
not seem right either, since at the prior moment of marking them with a Yes we did not plan any
immediate activities for progressing them and could move on to further states of the respective
alpha. For this reason, the updated version of the Scorecard Deck distinguishes between the
levels of completion Yes (definitively) and Yes (to be revised)1.
5.2.4 Case Conclusions
The trial use of the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck was by and large a success, as it showed
to be a useful tool for establishing team agreement both in terms of overarching goals and the
particular actions to take  something of a particular difficulty in interdisciplinary projects. As
Dr Bancroft points out:
[Scorecards] can be used as a [...] workable document across different disciplines,
which is [...] something very hard to monitor and keep up with [...] because of that
problem of project fragmentation that happens a lot just because people go back to
their comfort zone.
1Additionally, an opportunity to dismiss a condition as Non/Applicable was added to current version of the
Deck. This is not informed by any particular fieldwork observation, but rather by common sense and good practice
186 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
Contrary to my initial expectations, the Scorecard Deck appeared to provide the most value not
in tracking project progress and thus making sure that all key aspects are getting progressed, but
in establishing what those aspects would be in the first place. As Dr Bancroft characterises the
later, progress-tracking sessions, those were useful, but we kind of prefigured [a lot of that and
simply] ticked the boxes. One possible explanation to that is the short span of the case study. If
the project had the time to be developed more, there could potentially appear more interesting
aspects to track. Another explanation is that we were a small team, so it was relatively easy for
us to maintain close collaboration and common ground once the initial parameters of the project
were set.
The spreadsheet implementation of the scorecards was very helpful, with arguably the biggest
advantage being the ability to quickly add (and edit) notes regarding the discussed conditions.
Besides, given the remote character of collaboration, using a physical version was not an option
to start with. From my experience in social data science, remote collaboration in many areas is a
rule rather than exception:
Having [the scorecards] physically located somewhere would be quite good for
project management. [...] My thing is  Im so unphysically located in my work that
I find them in a virtual work much-much better. (Dr Bancroft)
The case study also showed that the Scorecard Deck is reasonably intuitive in use and that the
scorecard approach to social data science project management can be adapted quickly. That said,
there is still a requirement for development of guidance that could help social data science teams
to kick-start the use of scorecards.
People are obviously used to [...] narrative time-line. [...So showing how the
individual alphas] are all linked together, but [...] not linear in the way [one] might
expect  that would be very helpful. [...People would need guidance on] how you
would return to things and update them. (Dr Bancroft)
Development of such guidance is part of the future work that follows up from this thesis (see
Section 6.1).
Finally, the case study provided evidence that allowed to make several major improvements to
the Scorecard Deck. The finalised version of the tool is assessed through broad evaluation in the
following section.
5.3. BROAD EVALUATION: EXPERT INTERVIEWS 187
5.3 Broad Evaluation: Expert Interviews
This section reports on the second stage of the evaluation  interviews with experts in social data
science. The recruitment of the interview participants was done under two key considerations.
First, the chosen evaluation mode put restrictions on the number of participants. The process of
interviewing takes a lot of time, so a significant portion of those who expressed their interest in
the Scorecard Deck as a tool to potentially consider in the future had to decline an invitation to
participate due to schedule constraints. Besides, the population of social data scientists is still
quite limited in size, as the discipline is relatively new and is arguably not as popular as some
more computationally intensive and less interdisciplinary areas of data science (for example,
computer vision and speech recognition as indicated in Section 2.1.1). Second, the qualitative
nature of the evaluation asked for qualitative representativeness (Diefenbach, 2008, p. 879)
of the findings  i.e. focusing on representing the qualitative variety of perspectives rather than
on mimicking the distribution of perspectives in the whole population of social data science
experts. Given the rapid developments in social data science, qualitative representativeness is
more important than the statistical one, as what is peripheral to the field today may become
mainstream tomorrow.
Most of the potential respondents were identified and approached systematically through relevant
research associations (the Oxford Internet Institute and the Alan Turing Institute) and publication
targets (the Big Data & Society journal and the SAGE Handbook of Social Media Research
Methods  cf. Voss et al., 2016). Some potential respondents were contacted based on their
wider knowledge of the field, which allowed to invite social data scientists who are employed
outside academia (e.g. representatives of CASM  dedicated digital research hub2 of the
Demos think-tank). Finally, one particular respondent was a member of the a banks data science
team, as their colleague had expressed interest in a demo version of the scorecards presented at a
SICSA DemoFest (SICSA, 2017).
Every potential respondent, including those identified as part of systematically approached
groups, were contacted through personal emails rather than trough bulk invitations. While this
approach limits the number of people who can realistically be contacted, it is also known to
increase the response rate (Sahlqvist et al., 2011) and has a significant advantage in control
over respondent profiles. While the nature of the considered academic groups already assured
some related expertise, additional respondent selection had to be made. For example, some of
the identified academics did not actually do data science, but studied the process (e.g. through
non-participatory fieldwork) or its implications (e.g. ethical or political). Others did data science,
but not social data science. To ensure that only the respondents with first-hand experience in

188 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
doing social data science were interviewed, I screened persons publications, research projects
and their stated research interests (provided that the latter are described in sufficient detail).
The level of participant seniority was another concern. Indeed, the proposed research exercise
is an expert evaluation, and the notion of expertise, in its lay sense, may be necessarily
associated with long-standing presence in the field and some indication of high position within
it. Yet, expertise is a challenging concept (Fischer, 1990; Ericsson and Smith, 1991; Jasanoff,
2003). Collins (2013) demonstrate the dimensions in expertise and argues that its key aspect is
immersion in the community of other experts. In the case of social data science, as a relatively
new discipline, the junior community members may be no less immersed in it than the senior
ones. Moreover, less senior team members may have more hands-on experience in doing the
research work, while the more senior team members might focus on management. Finally, the
anecdotal evidence of the case studies suggest that it is not unusual to have social scientists as
senior members to define the project direction and junior members with technical backgrounds to
implement the required analyses. This can give varying perspectives, both valid for the evaluation
needs. That being said, the experts should have experience sufficient to critically reflect on
their work, to argue about the causes of its successes and challenges. For this reason, all the
potential interviewees in academia were at least PhD students in the last year of their study or
had demonstrable prior industrial experience.
5.3.1 Relevance of the Scorecards
The respondents, who across all of them have worked through- (or been asked open questions
motivated by) the contents of the scorecards in relation to every alpha in the Essence of Social
Data Science model (see Section 4.1), have uniformly agreed that the points suggested by the
scorecards can be relevant in a social data science project. In most cases, when reflecting on a
suggested point, a respondent came up with a relevant example from a project they had chosen
as a scenario. For example, John3, who worked through the Data Sources alpha using his
prior project in data-driven epidemiology as an example, offered a lot in regard to the conditions
suggested in the first state of the alpha  Data Soures: Indentified  reflecting on the suggestions
to consider demographics, triangulation and use of traditional methods (see Table 4.6):
We wanted to gather the age of people as one of the parameters, wealth the people
one of the parameters, [and the] geographic location is the fundamental thing. We
got interviews. We actually had a parallel project that we didnt conduct but there
were a psychology group who did interviews with people in [a different university].
3Hereinafter, all the names are pseudonyms.
5.3. BROAD EVALUATION: EXPERT INTERVIEWS 189
[They were] studying the sort of same demographic [groups] but doing it with
classical social science to see what people do to avoid catching flu [and to avoid]
places [where, as] they heard, other people had it. [...] So [what] we were doing is
directly measuring that via proxy [of] location [and] they were doing it by going
around interviewing individuals and groups.
When switching to the next state  Data Sources: Evaluated  whose conditions and
prerequisites suggest different points of critique for the identified sources (see Table 4.7),
John could offer just as much and was appreciative of the fact that compliance-related issues
were defined as a prerequisite:
Level of control, access, accuracy of data are all fundamental. [...We] really needed
to know about the veracity of the data. How to assure that was not obvious because
of quite an early experiment in using smartphones for the for epidemic tracking. [...]
And then compliance  [the senior] medical ethics people obviously required [that
from] us, you know, because this was part of a medical epidemiological study we
had to we had to have very good privacy.
As much as John acknowledges the value of complementing new data sources with the traditional
ones, Joseph does the same for analysis methods (as suggested in Table 4.17). In particular, he
explains how qualitative analysis of interview data helps him to design quantitative analysis of
the mobile device logs (i.e. times, lengths and directions of mobile phone calls and text messages
between participating individuals):
When you actually talk to people, they say things that perhaps you havent expected
and so what I do you in a more qualitative approach to that data is read through all
the interviews, read through the coding of the interviews [to] get a sense of, like,
well, what types of relationships would [...there be]: something about the type the
nature of relationship, [...] about the context in which this relationship exists in terms
of where people are located  physically at home, or work and so on. I go through
all that process. I would sort of take out different types of relationships depending
on that general overarching interest [...]. What I want to do [...] then is sort of like a,
some of the quantitative aspects of the calls and texts [...]. I would go to the log data
and I would compare that to the other types of ties more broadly within the particular
respondents call and text log. And then I would also potentially, if I thought it
would be useful, compare those patterns in the much larger national dataset.
190 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
Some points suggested by the Scorecard Deck provoked extensive discussions with different
evaluation participants, thus further affirming the relevance of those points. For example, the
condition of envisioning proxies and metrics resonated with Jane and Nina who both chose to
work through the Research Questions alpha (see Table 4.13). Interestingly, while both Jane and
Nina talked about projects that had employed machine learning for a predictive analysis problem,
the challenge of metric choice had been most pressing for them in different circumstances  Nina
had to choose a salient proxy to represent an obscure variable, while Jane had to choose a metric
to evaluate the quality of her models:
The second part [of the discussed project was] analyzing the image content and
then basically try[ing] to see whether we can actually match it with  well, I would
say the number of protests that [are] happening around the world, but there is no
database, so we use[d] proxies for ground truth, which is the Guardian articles.
[...So,] proxies and metrics envisioned  yeah [, that was important]. (Nina)
In the dataset [...], we have one majority class [...]. Therefore, if youre training
[a] model [and] it strikes for high accuracy, then the model that always chooses
majority class is doing pretty well [...]. Therefore, like, the choice of metrics was
quite important to this project and we indeed actually compared several choices.
(Jane)
Some respondents also commented on the relevance of the suggested states as a whole rather
than only on that of individual conditions. For example, Phillip recognised the Team: Seeded
state (see Table A.20), as in his project there was an initial set of people who were the kind of
backbone of the team, however those people also knew that [the] initial team didnt have the
necessary skills to do everything that [the] project would involve. Similarly, Vassiliy, while
discussing the project of adapting the tools for graph analysis available on the market to prevent
credit card fraud, recognised the stage of formulating the research questions as a broad framework
(see Table 4.12):
We do a foundations work [...] when we would look at [...] a number of tools. We
wanted to look at Neo4j4. [...] We ended up looking at a Python Graph Model and
we did research around that subject.
In many cases, the points suggested by the scorecards seemed to make the respondents
conceptualise some of the process that were happening tacitly during the work on their project as
https://neo4j.com/
https://neo4j.com/
5.3. BROAD EVALUATION: EXPERT INTERVIEWS 191
a by-product of the collaboration rather than as a result of a focused effort. For example, Phillip
explained how in his project the selection of a management model (suggested in Table A.20)
had never been explicitly done, yet effectively a flat hierarchy model (cf. Carzo Jr and Yanouzas,
1969) had been employed:
We never thought of it, I guess, as a management model, [...] that was perhaps
putting it a little strongly for us. But we had this idea of there are the leaders, [...]
there are the PIs and [the] Co-Is of the research, and the research associates. But the
research associates are effectively proposing projects to the PIs and Co-Is and then
in [...] face-to-face meetings we all kind discuss what the value of these projects
were, we would refine them together. So, there was a leadership in that we took
guidance from the PIs and the Co-Is, but it was a little bit flatter than [otherwise
possible].
These suggestions in the scorecards that aid in conceptualisation of project aspects may be of
value even if they do not motivate the users to achieve something completely new. Indeed, simply
by making something explicitly, it may be easier to manage this aspect and also to pass on the
derived practices to new projects and/or team members.
In some cases, the respondents acknowledged relevance of the conditions suggested by the
scorecards with a caveat that in practice achieving such conditions is difficult or even impossible.
For example, Juan, when discussing the Analysis Methods alpha and commenting on the
suggested condition of knowing how to evaluate the confidence in the results produced by
each of the selected methods (see Table 4.17), had to assume a very cautious position. In his
judgement, to truly estimate the confidence in the findings derived with modern analysis methods
and from new data sources, a wider culture of- (and a corresponding compliance framework for-)
reproducibility in social data science is required:
Im not so sure about that. I think theres an assumption that if someone else has
already used those methods and [they] have been socially validated  and by social
I mean the results and the articles have been published in peer-reviewed journals
 you have confidence. But I dont think that we have enough in history  or even
any experiences in digital humanities our data-[driven] social sciences  [...] related,
for instance, to the replicability of results. So, I dont know of many studies in,
which people have gone back use the same data set and come up with a different
conclusion. We dont do that yet. [...] I mean, in many cases still there are not so
192 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
many datasets published. [For example, the often used] Twitter data, in most cases,
precludes you in its terms and condition from republishing the dataset.
One particular point that most participants acknowledged as relevant only in a hypothetical case
rather in the project they used as a scenario was stakeholder engagement. This point appeared in
discussion with many respondents, as stakeholder engagement in some shape or form appears
as a prerequisite across states of different alphas in the Scorecard Deck, e.g. for outlining the
research questions (see Table 4.12) and for envisioning and iterating the artefacts (see Tables 4.22
and 4.24). A common reaction to this among the respondent was to think of their project funders
and claim relative independence. For example, see the following two quotes from different
participants5:
In my case with this particular grant the language [of] the funding is that as long as
the project is in the general spirit of the proposal thats fine. [...] Id be quite honest
and frank with you [...], but this is how research, I think, goes for a lot of people.
We were told [by the funders that] this [project] was about trust online and kind of
how trusted feed into conversations [across] various online domains, but [...] we had
full control over what those domains were. So one of them was to do with welfare
and poverty and social media, one of those to do with kind of more traditional media
forms. [...]. So, we had a lot of choice and even though, this was a funded project
by a combination of funding bodies, [...] but the stakeholders didnt really have any
kind of say in what we chose to look at.
Sometimes I directly asked the respondents about stakeholder groups beyond funders that may
be less obvious in the context of the term, but included in Freemans (1984) definition. For
example, I asked Nina whether she, when planning her research, considered how to make it more
valuable for other academic stakeholders  e.g. social scientists who also study protests. She
said that this was something she would like to do in the future and that she had proposed in
[her] thesis that one potential expansion would be including a social scientist. However, even in
this case, as she rightfully acknowledged, that would actually be a collaborator [...] on board.
Such an attitude can be partially explained by the fact that many respondents only saw the
stakeholder-related prerequisites in other alphas but did not interact with the Stakeholders
alpha itself. The only respondent who did work through this alpha, John, commented: Thats
definitely [relevant], that list [of conditions] like tacit stakeholders accounted, [...] getting people
5These quotes are specifically sensitive and thus are not attributed to specific respondents.
5.3. BROAD EVALUATION: EXPERT INTERVIEWS 193
involved. Partially this may be caused by the nature of Johns research project  epidemiology
is a sensitive field and at the very least the interests of the patients have to be accounted for.
However, arguably another reason is that the Stakeholders alpha is another one that helps to
conceptualise otherwise hidden concerns. Therefore, only through engaging with the unexpected
points suggested by this alpha (e.g. inclusion of tacit stakeholders) it is possible to appreciate its
importance.
Furthermore, even if the Stakeholders alpha is not applicable to every social data science
project, I would argue that its inclusion is still valuable as sometimes it is very important. For
example, Chris talked about how for four consecutive years, he had been recruited as part of a big
social data science team for several days every summer to provide real-time data-driven analytics
for a major annual music festival in Europe with the aim of improving customer experience. For
him, stakeholder-related issues were of major importance, as their requirements would often
fluctuate:
I often have this picture [about this project] that you walk into a forest and you
have no idea what youre going to find. [...] I think its kind of natural that it is [a bit
chaotic], but [it is] also the unpredictable nature of the stakeholders. [...] Depending
on whats happening on the journey inside the forest, [...] its quite unpredictable to
say [...] what they want to dig into in one or two or three days.
All in all, the evaluation shows that the content of scorecards is relevant in different kinds of
social data science projects. The scorecards do indeed point at explicit and tacit project aspects
that are worth managing and suggest conditions that are beneficial to achieve  even though
some of those conditions are applicable only in subset of projects (e.g. those where the role
of external stakeholders is high) and others are almost impractical to achieve at this day and
age, but arguably may become possible in the future (e.g. thorough evaluation of confidence in
outputs of different social data science research methods).
5.3.2 Clarity of the Scorecards
By and large, the respondents did not face any significant issues in understanding the contents
of the scorecards. The conditions proved to mostly be formulated sufficiently clearly for the
respondents to swiftly get their gist, yet sufficiently flexible to be successfully interpreted in the
context of different social data science projects. For example, within a standard hourly interviews,
Jimmy easily worked through all states of the Data Sources alpha. John only worked through
the earlier states of his alphas, but he managed to consider three of them  Stakeholders,
194 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
Data Sources and Compliance. Juan, who only had 15 minutes to actually work through the
scorecards, managed to fully cover the first state of the Analysis Methods alpha.
Occasionally, the respondents experienced difficulties with making sense of the alphas that had
been out of scope of their involvement in the discussed projects. For example, this was the
case with Jane who chose to talk about the Research Goals alpha as a logical place to start
rather than because it was the most familiar project aspect for her (Oh, well, should we start
with research goals  like, from the beginning?). Her project was focused on using a particular
research technique (conversation modelling) to achieve one well-defined objective  to improve
classification of stance towards rumours (belief versus doubt) in Twitter discussions. In her work
she did not need to put much consideration to what the real-world problem that motivated her
work was, what the interests of the stakeholders were and to other similarly higher level issues.
This was not because she did not believe those were important  in fact, she eventually talked
about those and contextualised her work accordingly:
if we [...] kind of zoom out and abstract a bit, [...] the problem is rumour spread
online. [...] And we want to tackle it, so we ideally want mathematical methods that
will assist in rumour verification. But we started to looking at stance [...] This was
motivated by previous research that has shown that [...] rumours that attract a lot of
scepticism [...] are more likely to be proven false.
However, according to Jane, the wider problematics of her research were relevant on the level
beyond her project and rather on the level of a whole strand of work of her research group. For
her, the research goals were given rather than worked through.
Several respondents experienced slight confusion when trying to distinguish between consecutive
states within an alpha. For example, when looking at the Research Questions alpha, Vassiliy
found the first two states  Identified and Refined  to not be completely discrete. According
to Vassiliy, in a research project [questions rather] evolve. This, however, is not necessarily
a pitfall of specifically the Scorecard Deck. Indeed, any project management tool that tracks
progress offers abstractions for stages (be that states of project core aspects, steps in a process
pipeline, etc.). These abstractions have to be discrete and thus cannot fully reflect the continuity
of reality  hence, some overlap between the consecutive ones would be inevitable. It is thus more
important to make sure that separating two consecutive states actually adds value. In Vassiliys
mind, that was the case. Indeed, he could distinguish between the two overlapping states by
pointing out how the initial broad question of his project (whether graph[s can be] helpful in
understanding common point[s]-of-compromise) was refined to the level of the specific graph
5.3. BROAD EVALUATION: EXPERT INTERVIEWS 195
analysis methodologies that his team had looked into. Moreover, after reading the individual
conditions suggested in the state-level scorecards, Vassiliy agreed that all of those would be
included into consideration within the project work.
Yet, some other participants felt a bit stronger about the overlap between consecutive states,
especially when their respective conditions also represented progress in overlapping issues. For
example, Jane felt that the Artefacts alpha has, across its states, too many related conditions:
I think I am overwhelmed by the amount of questions [presented as conditions in
the scorecards] and that [...] sometimes, when you answer, you feel like you have
already answered it for certain questions. [...] [For example], I guess identifying
artefacts in advance is [...] a good thing. [But], I mean, Im not sure you need, you
know, like, a thousands [questions on] identifying artefacts. You just say to yourself:
well, I wanna publish a paper, [...] and maybe these are my venues Im going to
publishing in, and these are my deadlines.
To an extent, this feeling of being overwhelmed by overlapping conditions is related to the
design of the evaluation. In reality, the states of the scorecards are meant to be filled in alongside
the managed social data science project actually getting progressed, whilst in the evaluation
interview a respondent has to fill the cards in retrospectively. Thus, it may be quite natural for a
respondent, even when they see the conditions related to the earlier states of an alphas progress,
think of the later states. Under this scenario, when this respondent arrives to the cards of the later
states, the new conditions may seem redundant. Actually, Jane also felt this way, and said that
she might be interested in actually in [...] reading the questions and see[ing] if that helps in an
ongoing project that she had at the moment.
However, as suggested by Nina, the confusion between the overlapping states may come from the
different ways in which the Scorecard Deck suggest to represent the progress of an alpha and the
progress of its particular conditions. Indeed, progressing an alpha is intended to be represented
by going through the alphas states and filling its conditions one-by-one, while progressing a
certain condition is meant to be represented by selecting different states of achievement for them
(Not achieved, In progress, etc.). According to Nina, a user may get confused when to select
each one:
I think [...] the [Research Questions:] Outlined and Refined part had a lot of
overlap. [...] It kind of [...] makes sense, but the reason I think the overlap is a bit
confusing is because you have this [...] In progress [as an option for how strongly
196 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
a condition is achieved]. So, yes, you kind of come up with an outline and then you
refine it and then your [...] In progress becomes Yes (definitely). And too much
overlap basically kind of overkills that Yes (to be revised) or In progress in the
Outlined part.
I plan to address this critique in further work. A simple brute-force approach to it would be
to cut on the number of states and their respective conditions. However, such an approach is
sub-optimal. There is a value in overlapping conditions since in more complex social data science
project the subtle differences between similar conditions may appear to be of critical importance.
Moreover, they allow for a more flexible and rigorous progress tracking. For example, Phillip
was very appreciative of this continuity in conditions and how elaborated they are:
I think if I was kind of using [the Scorecard Deck] at the start of [our project]  so,
like, four years ago  [...] wed be able to see the [conditions] that we couldnt [even
start to] get addressed. And that would be useful for us as well. So the fact that we
wouldnt be able to answer some of these questions [would] kind of [give] us ideas
on Where should we go? what should we do? By the next time we have meeting in
six months, lets try and fill in those gaps. And so that in itself will help give shape
[to the project].
What, however, can be suggested to remedy the critique of redundancy without corrupting the
value of the the Scorecard Deck, is to allow further customisation of the deck for the needs of
a particular project. In the current implementation of the scorecards as an interactive Google
Sheet, a user can only customise the list of alphas they would like to consider in their project.
This can be further extended by allowing users to either completely de-select particular states of
certain alphas from consideration  or to blanket-select a certain state to be completely achieved
without looking in detail at its individual conditions. The latter would be especially useful for
such project as the Janes one  when there is enough set-up information at the very start of the
project. In such a project, for example, broad research questions may already be defined, so the
project members can jump straight into their refinement.
Additionally, development of a lighter version of the Scorecard Deck can be proposed. This
version would take a form of simple checklist of the most pertinent and qualitatively distinct
conditions from the Scorecard Deck. Under such approach, the conditions could still be grouped
by alpha, but the individual states of each alpha would arguably collapse. Such lighter version
of the Scorecard Deck would thus not be suitable for tracking progress of a social data science
project, but can still be valuable as starting discussion point when planning a social data science
5.3. BROAD EVALUATION: EXPERT INTERVIEWS 197
project. It also can be a good introduction to the lingo and contents of the scorecards and thus
may be advised to use alongside the full deck when first using it.
Finally, in very rare instances the respondents seemed to misinterpret the very gist of some of the
suggested conditions. The only explicit example of this comes from Nina who did not interpret
some of the earliest conditions in the Research Questions alpha as intended. For example, she
interpreted the Demand Understood condition (see Table 4.12) as that a project team has all
the sufficient knowledge to conduct research, while the intended meaning was much weaker 
that there is an understanding what kind of new knowledge the research project aims to produce.
While I would like to re-iterate that such misinterpretation was a rare case displayed by just
one participant, it is still something to consider in further work. One specific action that can be
suggested is to revise the language of those points in the scorecards that have caused confusion.
More systematically, a glossary for the terms used in the scorecards that would provide more
detailed definition for each condition, possibly with some examples, would be of great value.
Overall, the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck proved to be an easy-to-comprehend project
management tool. It only caused confusion with some selected respondents, it was never
confusing to the level that actually made it unusable or pointless, and some of this confusion
would most likely disappear in a real-world scenario of an ongoing project, especially if the tool
was used continuously and thus the team could go up the learning curve. That being said, the
fact that some confusion is still there suggests that further guidance for the use of the deck  e.g.
a user manual  should be compiled. In fact, this idea is supported by Juan, who assessed the
comprehensibility of the Scorecard Deck as follows:
I think that for someone who has used before [any] project management tool, [the
scorecards] would be very intuitive. For people who have not  they will need some
clear instructions.
5.3.3 Comprehensiveness of the Scorecards
So far the discussed respondent feedback had been focused on whether the contents of the
scorecards clearly relate to their own work and to social data science in general. The question
that is still open though is how complete the Scorecard Deck is  i.e. whether making sure to
fulfil the conditions suggested by the Scorecard Deck is enough to be confident in successful
completion of a social data science project. A relevant analogy would be that to precision and
recall (cf. Buckland and Gey, 1994)  while the former is already assessed, the latter requires
further discussion.
198 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
Unfortunately, reliably assessing the scorecards recall without actually applying the tool in
a large portfolio of research projects is problematic. Indeed, it requires thinking of the types
of issues that have not been identified neither during the fieldwork nor in the literature, which
may be difficult without actually facing these issues in practice. The expert evaluation allows to
partially achieve the same effect, as the respondent may bring up the unconsidered issues from
their own experience. However, if a respondent is asked to simply work through a particular set
of scorecards (which was the case with most evaluation interviews), it creates a risk that this
respondent would be distracted from the issues not covered in the scorecards. To compensate
for that, I conducted the interview with Joseph differently. While I still asked him some seed
questions inspired by the alphas of the Deck, no focus on the Decks particular conditions was
put. I encouraged Joseph to drive the conversation with the help of appropriate probe questions
(discussed in Section 5.1).
By far and large, the accounts of doing social data science provided by Joseph highlight the issues
that are captured by the Scorecard Deck. In fact, Josephs project presents an excellent example
of how the issues captured in the conditions of the Data, Data Sources and Compliance
alphas (see Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.2 and 4.3.6) postulate themselves in a social data science project,
and how these project aspects affect each other and the project infrastructure (see Appendix A.3)
in accordance with the prerequisites of their alpha states.
As Josephs project was concerned with discovering patterns in human mobile communications
(i.e. calling and text messaging), he required data on numbers of calls/texts between different
participants, their frequency and directionality. To contextualise those, he also required data on
the type of relationship between communicating sides (friends, classmates/colleagues, relatives
etc.) and on the participant demographics:
[I wanted to look at] how adolescents use mobile phones and whether or not their
use of mobile phones tends to result in [...] forming these insular small group
relationships  one or two close friends [who spend] all their time texting and no
time doing anything enriching for their lives. [...] Or if, in fact, theyre texting a lot
but they [are] having a series of intense relationship, [...which is] quite different than
what adults experience.
This presented a challenge of accessing publicly unavailable data and satisfying the participants
privacy concerns. This was done by developing an Android app:
[We developed] an Android application that allows us to collect non-identifying
calling and texting log data  [...] just hash identifiers associated with phone numbers,
5.3. BROAD EVALUATION: EXPERT INTERVIEWS 199
time and dates of calls and texts  but also to be a research tool. [...] Respondent,
[when] installing it, [...] knew exactly what it was doing and it could be woven into
onscreen surveys where during the survey [the app would], say, choose the most
texted person from their address book and ask them a question about [the recent
call] or about that person.
Joseph and made sure that no contacts, no text messages  nothing of specifically high
sensibility were accessible to the research team  for example, numbers were hashed on the app
side so that they would never leave the device. As Joseph characterised the process:
It was almost overly precautious, but I think it was important.
As can be seen, in accordance with the conditions of the Data: Enivisioned state (see Table 4.1),
Joseph required evidence on primary (e.g. number of texts between participants) and secondary
characteristics (e.g. the demographics of the texters) of the studied phenomena. As shown in the
Data Sources: Identified state (see Table 4.6), this could affect initial selection of data sources 
and indeed, the qualitative difference in data on primary and secondary characteristics motivated
motivated him to consider traditional data sources (surveys) alongside modern ones (call logs)
and the private nature of the data motivated him to think of sources with leveraged access  all
in accordance with the states conditions. In his thinking about data acquisition, Joseph had to
account for compliance considerations in accordance with the next state of the Data Sources
alpha (see Table 4.7). The resulting solution came in form of adding an extra element to the
project infrastructure architecture  a mobile app  the development of which was tailored to the
considerations around the data sources as suggested in Table A.14.
One of the leitmotivs in Josephs narrative is how his work is not simply iterative  it is in a
sense never-ending, with new projects stemming out of the old ones:
[After my current strand of work] I have a book proposal that Im putting together,
which will really tie all of that data [I am studying currently] together. [...And] I
think Im going to be harvesting, so to speak, this [type] of data for years to come.
I think can get number a of other [...] papers out of this data that are significantly
different than what I put in a book. So, its sort of like, in a sense, [this work] isnt
over.
While the scorecards do pick up on this permanent continuity, as the latter states of some of the
alphas explicitly talk about planning further research (for example, see Tables 4.20 and 4.16)
200 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
and about assuring the possibility to reuse of the data, tools and ways of working (see Tables
4.5, 4.11, A.19 and A.35), there is a specific detail that emerges from Josephs narrative that
is not explicitly covered in the Scorecard Deck. When Joseph talked about what specifically
could spark the new work, he stressed the importance of communication with potential future
collaborators:
[Me and a colleague] [a]re talking at a conference and [...] he mentioned that he
had, you know, some survey data that hed be interested in [...] working on with
me. [...] And I, at that time, had been thinking a lot about [mobile phone] log data,
and digital trace data and sort of advantages and disadvantages as compared to more
typical types of measures of this particular media use within social science. [...] I
[was] just talking at a conference, that [idea] just came about  so it wasnt really
premeditated in any real way.
Even though the process of arriving to a research idea discussed in the quote above is spontaneous,
the key steps that lead to it  networking, discussing ideas with other professionals in the field 
can be taken systematically and thus can potentially be incorporated into a project management
tool. Specifically to the Scorecard Deck, related conditions can be added to the early stages of
the Research Goals (e.g. Input from other researchers in the field received) and Team (e.g.
Networking with other professionals in the projects field performed) alphas.
It is worth noting that unforeseen issues that are caused by unique circumstances of a particular
social data science project may still arise. For example, one the interviewees6 discussed how his
project team decided to collaborate with a certain public figure who was a convicted and how
this collaboration backfired in an unpredictable way. For a reader, it is arguably clear that a case
like this is specific to the project and not characteristic of social data science in general. The
Social Data Science Scorecard Deck does not only fail to deal with such issues  it cannot be
expected to do so. Therefore, regardless of how complete it is, it still cannot replace the informed
judgement of a project team on how complete their project is.
5.3.4 Helpfulness of the Scorecards
Most of the researchers suggested that the scorecards are likely to be especially useful when the
team is interdisciplinary and large, because there are more relationships to manage (which make
a project management tool more desirable to start with) and because the Scorecards can serve as
a point of common lingo. Even Joseph, despite his remarks on potential detrimentalism of using
6Due to sensitivity of the issue, neither attribution to a particular respondent nor direct quotes are provided.
5.3. BROAD EVALUATION: EXPERT INTERVIEWS 201
project management tools in research work, thought that the Scorecard Deck can be a valuable
talking point:
I have worked with other people from different disciplines and theres often a
disconnect in terms of language. [...] So having something thats tangible that
you could both discuss...  I mean, you still want to make sure that [...] the team
members really discuss each point thoroughly. I think that would be very critical to
[the Deck] being successful. If team members are just like, Okay, I got this covered,
you do that one over there, then youd have these misunderstandings quite a lot. But
if the team members all together sat down and went through each one [scorecard]
at a time, then I think it could help provide sort of common language and avoid
misunderstanding. So, in that situation, I can see [the usefulness].
Nina shared the same stance and suggested that when a social data science team is relatively small
and tech-focused then, a generic project management tool such as the Scorecard Deck may be an
overkill for tracking the projects progress. According to her, if you are writing code together
with the entire group, then probably I would switch to GitHub 7 because it would be much easier
to track [progress...] with GitHubs project timelines, while in a more mixed background team,
some of the members wont understand GitHub. They wont find it user-friendly and thus the
scorecards would be handy.
It is worth noting that an instrument where a project team has to define its timelines, milestones
and deliverables (including that provided by GitHub) is only useful to manage an already
operationalised project, but not to design a project. The Scorecard Decks ability to provide
guidance to a project team cannot be replaced with such tools. In some circumstances, this
may not be required: the limited evidence provided by Vassiliy suggests that in an industrial
setting data science projects are often quick and straightforward, e.g. refitting old models with
new data. Moreover, as Vassiliy says, he does not believe that Tesco Bank does out-and-out
research projects, as most of the projects have clear outcomes and the primary concern of
pretty much all of them is looking for financial benefit. Yet, even the Tesco Bank data science
team frequently faces more open-ended challenges in the form of proof of concept projects
where the financial expectations or the outcomes are less clear. Such project most often study
the efficiency and effectiveness of the employed data science methods. It is the open-ended
projects where Vassiliy suggests that the Scorecard Deck is especially useful.

202 CHAPTER 5. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL DATA SCIENCE SCORECARD DECK
Jimmy takes a balanced approach by suggesting that the Scorecard Deck can be valuable in both
individual and team work, but in the team setting it can add value in more ways:
I can see it being very useful for individuals because I would bet that no single
[researcher] put[s] [all relevant point] in the list. [...] So, if I were in the beginning of
the project [that had been discussed during the interview], honestly, [the scorecards]
would already kind of help me get a very8 detailed understanding of kind of things
to cover. [...] But for teams I find that [the deck] can be a very useful learning tool.
So, if I showed this to my political science friends, they would probably look at
them and think, Oh, Id never think of that Just like I would go through and [find
a] side [that] didnt cross my mind.
This last property is a good response to Johns critique that only part of the scorecards content
is specific to social data science  a lot of issues are common for social science in general.
This is hardly a problem if the scorecards are able to teach social data scientists with technical
background on the common problems that come from the social science side and vice versa. In
face, because of this last property, Jimmy suggests another context for using the Scorecard Deck
 education:
[For the] future students of mine, [the deck] would be useful, [as they would]
understand what a social data science projects involved and particularly how [they
are] different from regular data science. [Regarding the] Masters course in Social
Data Science in our department [...], a lot of [...] computer scientists [in] the
programme [have] never worked with human data or with any kind of, like, more
solid data. And the people who come from the social sciences, they probably wont
think of things like monitoring and kind of API access, [...] restrictions and even the
computational needs of a project. [...] Im gonna be supervising some students next
year. I think Ill show [the Scorecard Deck] to them.

6CHAPTER SIXCONCLUSIONS
This thesis meets the objective set out in the Introduction and adapts a project management tool
from software engineering, the SEMAT Essence model (see Section 2.4.2), to social data science.
In regard to objective 1, I establish several dimensions of challenges that social data science
faces. First, the technological innovations that underpin social data science originate in a close
circle of big hi-tech companies. Even though some means for doing social data science are
getting increasingly available for a larger number of actors, the drastic inequality in access to
data about people and their behaviour and to technological means of their analysis still persists.
This makes social data science an instrument of political power and raises significant issues of
ethics and responsibility in social data science. These issues are amplified by the epistemological
challenges that arise from the mismatch of contemporary data analysis methodologies with the
research questions typical to social studies, as well as from the nature of the data sources.
In regard to objective 2, I make a choice in favour of adapting the SEMAT Essence model. This
tool does not assume or suggest any particular work process and rather focuses on objectives.
This is desirable given the variety of social data science projects. Moreover, the SEMAT model
provides holistic guidance that covers both hard (technical) and soft (managerial) issues and
addresses concerns common for social data science such as stakeholder engagement and team
management.
In regard to objective 3, I conduct four case studies in social data science. Each case presents
a single social data science project. Together, they cover a broad spectrum of areas within
the discipline: impact-oriented academic work (cf. the Dark Net project, Sections 3.4.2 and
5.2), social media research consultancies (cf. the Shakespeare Lives evaluation project and the
InfoMigrants evaluation projects, Sections 3.2 and 3.4.1) and production of a data-driven radio
show (see Sections 3.3). The case studies were done at different points in time within my studies.
204 CHAPTER 6. CONCLUSIONS
They serve different purposes and are treated differently in the write-up. The two case studies
presented in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 are complete ethnographies. They provide a holistic picture
of what it takes to be doing social data science and provide account of all significant issues
that I observed and, as a team member, experienced. While the write-ups of the other two case
studies are not as fully-fledged, they report on the observations that provide significant added
value. Overall, the four case studies present a contribution to understanding of the challenges
involved in doing social data science.
In regard to objective 4, I develop and present the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck, a holistic
project management tool for social data science that borrows the basic structure and content
from the SEMAT Essence model, but reworks it in three significant ways. First, the Scorecard
Deck adds six sets of scorecards for the core aspects of social data science projects that are
systematically informed by the fieldwork and the literature. The other six sets that are based on
the SEMAT model are appropriately modified. Second, the Scorecard Deck adds a new structural
element that is absent in the SEMAT model: the prerequisites. They represent how different
aspects of a social data science project are related and how progression in one project aspect may
rely on progression in some other aspect. As such, they truly support holistic project management.
Third, the Scorecard Deck abandons the paper representation of the scorecards in favour of a
digital one as a Google spreadsheet. Through argument and, subsequently, in-depth evaluation
I show that digitisation of the scorecards is more than a mere change in their presentation  it
actually affects the way the scorecards can be used and makes them a significantly more powerful
tool specifically for managing social data science projects. As such, the developed project
management tool contributes to good research practice in the field of social data science.
In regard to objective 5, I take part in a social data science project whose investigators agreed
to use the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck for project management. I foster the use of the
Scorecard Deck in different settings and for different purposes. Throughout the resulting series of
participant-observation exercises, I establish the value of the Scorecard Deck for shaping project
goals, for establishing and maintaining shared understanding and team agreement and for making
sure that the team members with different disciplinary backgrounds work towards a common
goal. I also establish several issues with the Scorecard Deck. Some of these issues  for example,
the tension between linking scorecards and their partial redundancy  only become evident when
results of multiple exercises are considered together. Thus, I contribute the methodology that
can be used for further fine-tuning of the Social Data Science Scorecards Deck.
In regard to objective 6, I subject the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck to an external
validation through interviews with experts in social data science. By asking the interviewees
to retrospectively apply the Scorecard Deck to one of their past projects, I make sure that the
6.1. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK 205
applicability of the scorecards is assessed in respect to qualitatively different research projects.
The assessment confirms the value of the scorecards, however suggests that modes for easier
customisation of the tool are required, as the comprehensiveness with which the scorecards go
through often overlapping points may appear excessive for many studies.
6.1 Limitations and Future Work
While I believe that my work is substantive in volume and robust in methodology by standards
and reasonable expectations that can be applied to a PhD thesis, it is necessarily limited by the
number of case studies  especially since only one of them was used for in-depth evaluation 
and the number of interviewees who participated in the broad evaluation. Furthermore, I think
that the Scorecard Deck in its current version may overfit to social data science as done by
academics. Again, this is in the nature of a PhD and the opportunities for doing non-academic
case studies. Even though the informing case studies were not academic projects in terms of their
research goals and produced artefacts, they all included academics on their respective teams. Out
of the interviewed experts, only one is employed outside academia.
Consequently, further research will need to address these limitations by further validating the
tool in other contexts. This includes exploring the possibility of adoption of the tool in contexts
such as industrial work or, for example, in civic hacking or data journalism. Further case studies
or other forms of validation will no doubt generate more changes to the tool and its contents.
Another aspect that could not be developed as part of this PhD was to interact with the SEMAT
team. As mentioned in Section 2.4.2, the original SEMAT model is published as an OMG
standard (cf. OMG, 2015). In the future, it may be valuable to contact the SEMAT team to
explore whether the Scorecard Deck can be incorporated into the standard as an extension.
Finally, further dissemination of the Scorecard Deck would require development of accompanying
usage guidelines and other educational materials in order to make the tool fully usable without
external supervision.
AAPPENDIX ASCORECARDS ADAPTEDFROM THE SEMATKERNEL MODEL
The scorecards for each alpha in this group derive their content from some alpha in the SEMAT
model  in most cases, it is that alpha whose role in the SEMAT Essence model corresponds to
the role of the informed alpha in the Essence of the Social Data Science model. For example, as
discussed in Section 4.1.1, the Research Goals alpha in the Essence of Social Data Science
corresponds to the Opportunity alpha in the Essence of Software Engineering  and thus
the scorecards for the former are informed by the contents of the latter. An exception is the
Infrastructure alpha. It belongs to the Resources area of concern, so there is no similar-role
alpha in the SEMAT model. The only exception is the Infrastructure set scorecards which is
informed by the Software System SEMAT alpha.
Most times, the contents of the scorecards simply paraphrases those found in the SEMAT model.
It is worth to note, however, that the original SEMAT model does not introduce a concept of
prerequisite states  i.e. representation of required progress in one alpha to facilitate further
progress in another alpha. In SEMAT, the states of different alphas reference each other only
through conditions. In the Scorecard Deck, such cross-refence conditions are translated into
prerequisites.
In cases when the contents of SEMAT and the Scorecard Deck match each other well, the
fieldwork evidence  or other forms of additional evidence  is usually omitted. The evidence is
however provided in cases of large deviations from the SEMAT model or when the fieldwork
contains particularly illustrative examples of the importance of a particular condition or state.
208 APPENDIX A. SCORECARDS ADAPTED FROM THE SEMAT KERNEL MODEL
A.1 Research Goals
This alpha is informed by the Opportunity alpha of the SEMAT model, which is defined as the
set of circumstances that makes it appropriate to develop or change a software system (OMG,
2015, p. 27).
A.1.1.1 State 1, 2 and 3. Problem Identified, Research Goals Formulated, Research
Goals Demanded
States 1, 2 and 3 (see Tables A.1, A.2 and A.3) are based on two first states of the respective alpha
in the SEMAT model  Identified and Solution Needed. While initially the states of two
corresponding alphas had one-to-one mapping, Problem Identified has been since considered a
separate state as a result of internal evaluation of the Scorecard Deck in the Dark Net study. That
project brought a realisation that one particular problem (low effectiveness of law enforcement
interventions into cybercriminal marketplaces) can lead to multiple research goals (understanding
the factors of resilience of those marketplaces and assessment of changes in trade dynamics after
disruptive events). As problem is defined in looser terms than opportunity in the SEMAT
model, a separate condition that warrants relevance of social data science to the solution of the
problem is added. The other conditions from the SEMAT model are slightly redistributed across
the states in the Scorecards to better match the 3-state representation.

A problem that can be addressed with the help of social data

A.1.1.2 State 4. Evaluated
This state (see Table A.4) is closely based off the Opportunity: Value Established state of
the SEMAT model. It relaxes some of the strict conditions that SEMAT poses on the notion
of value. In SEMAT, the value has to be quantified either in absolute terms or in returns or
savings per time period (p. 30). This is not always applicable to social data science. As the
fieldwork suggests, even the evaluation projects that the Open University hosted and that were
to benefit a specific funding stakeholder did not aim to bring direct financial gain  rather, they
could help a funder to make better investments in the future. Therefore, a more relaxed notion

of a benefit for key stakeholders is introduced instead. Furthermore, the Scorecard Deck also
introduces the concept on wider impact, i.e. social effects beyond the key/direct stakeholders.
The Dark Net study informed this condition, as that study could have wider societal impacts
that go beyond affecting the operations of the key stakeholders (law enforcement organisations).
Finally, a condition on the SEMAT model that tied opportunity and requirements is translated
into a prerequisite for the research questions, as the Research Questions alpha in the Scorecard
Deck functionally corresponds with the Requirements alpha in the SEMAT model (see Section
4.1).

This state closely follows the equivalent state of the SEMAT model paraphrasing its conditions
and translating some of them into prerequisites (see Table A.5). Prerequisites for achievement of
early state for Team, Infrastucture, Data sources and Compliance alphas are added
since having at least a rough idea about the first three is crucial for costing a social data science
project and severe compliance issues may damage a projects viability.

A.2 Stakeholders
This alpha is informed by the equivalent alpha of the SEMAT model, which is defined as the
people, groups, or organizations who affect or are affected by a software system (OMG, 2015,
p. 23).
A.2.1.1 State 1. Recognised
This state closely follows the equivalent state of the SEMAT model (see Table A.8). Additionally,
recognition of tacit stakeholders is acknowledged. Tacit stakeholders are individuals and groups
who do not directly interact with the project, its findings and artefacts, but are affected by
extension. In the Dark Net study, some of those tacit stakeholders are drug users and their
families. To an extent, the distributors of illicit goods were also tacit stakeholders  this
illustrates the point that an effect that a social data science project can have on its stakeholders
does not necessarily need to be positive.
Human participants are also recognised as a specific type of stakeholder group. Indeed, if a
study involves participants, their interests and concerns have to factored in at the very least for
the ethical reasons. The infamous study of emotional contagion on Facebook (Kramer et al.,
2014) is an example of no consideration for participants is stakeholders  and the backlash it
caused was massive.
It is worth noting that, since social data science projects often have wide impact, involvement
(and even identification) of all stakeholder groups is unfortunately sometimes impractical or
impossible. For example, in the case of the Hit List case study, our team had limited access
to audience research data and no resources to conduct audience surveying ourselves. For this
reason, the quality of work was mainly assessed through the professional judgement of the
producers involved and through examining occasional feedback left by social media users. While
the shows team did put much effort and reflection into how the shows production (and the
social data science behind it) were approached, it is impossible to eliminate the probability that
systematic audience research could have shaped the process.
A.2.1.2 State 2, 3 and 4. Represented, Involved and In Agreement
These states closely follow the equivalent states of the SEMAT model while adding conditions
in relation to the aforementioned tacit stakeholders (see Tables A.9, A.10 and A.11). The
condition of stakeholders supporting ways of working is shifted from State 2 to State 4. The
fieldwork shows that the ways of working develop throughout the course of the project. For
example, Section 3.2.7.2 shows how the team collaboration modes naturally evolved with the
A.2. STAKEHOLDERS 213
STAKEHOLDERS:
RECOGNISED
Stakeholders and their potential modes of engagement are
identified.
Groups identified All the different groups of stakeholders that are, or will be,
affected by the research project are identified, including tacit
stakeholders.
Involvement system es-
tablished
It is known which stakeholder groups will actually have
representatives specifically appointed to interact with the
project and its team. At least the funders and the beneficiaries
are considered.
Human participants con-
sidered
If the research involves human participants, those are con-
sidered stakeholders represented via participation in the
research activities.
Roles defined The roles that representatives of each stakeholder group
should play in their interactions with the project team (e.g.
superintendence, consultancy, assessment) are defined.
Research Goals: Prob-
lem Identified
A problem that can be addressed with the help of social data
science is identified.

teams understanding of how complex it was to ensure inter-coder reliability for some of the data
annotation variables. Thus, it may be impossible for the stakeholder representative to make an
informed judgement about the teams ways of working early on in the project.
In regard to State 3, the fieldwork illustrates the difference between stakeholder feedback and
stakeholder engagement. The British Council provided sufficient feedback on interim results of
the Shakespeare Lives evaluation project. This allowed to progress such areas of the project as
social media analysis, since the project team could plan the early stages of work basing on their
research experience, so that the British Councils feedback could be used to steer the direction of
research rather than to provide fully detailed requirements. Yet, lack of the British Councils
engagement beyond giving feedback led to a skewed perception of their priorities over some
illustrative data visualisations, most notable the interactive calendar of the Shakespeare Lives
programme (see Section 3.2.3.3).
A.2.1.3 State 5. Satisfied with Progress
The state corresponds to the Stakeholders: Satisfied for Deployment state of the SEMAT model
(see Table A.12). The second condition in this state is more relaxed than the original SEMAT
condition The stakeholder representatives confirm that they agree that the system is ready for
deployment. This is done to represent the iterative nature of work on artefacts and stakeholder
feedback on them. The fieldwork experience of the Open University based evaluation projects

strongly suggests that, as the project reports went through many drafts before being accepted.
A.2.1.4 State 6. Satisfied with Artefacts
The state corresponds to the Stakeholders: Satisfied in Use state of the SEMAT model (see
Table A.13). A condition of wider groups involvement is added. In social data science, depending
on the type of an artefact, it may be hard to judge how widely the artefact is used among
the stakeholders  for example, it is not necessarily clear what it means to use a report or a
publication. Therefore, making an extra check for this condition may be worthwhile. In addition,
the last condition is relaxed from explicit positive feedback from stakeholders to some sort of
evidence of stakeholder satisfaction. This is again mostly caused by tacit stakeholders and other
stakeholder groups who are not necessarily directly approachable, but whose impression of the
project artefacts is of importance.

Table A.11: Stakeholders: In Agreement. Conditions and prerequisites.
A.3 Infrastructure
The scorecards for this alpha are informed by the scorecards for the Software System alpha
of the SEMAT model, which is defined as a system made up of software, hardware, and data
that provides its primary value by the execution of the software (OMG, 2015, p. 38). As
seen, this definition is inclusive of all infrastructure components  not only software per se 
and thus is directly applicable to the Infrasturcture alpha. This is not to contradict Section
4.1.2, which claims that the SEMAT Software System alpha corresponds to Artefacts in the
Essence of Social Data Science. The correspondence stated in Section 4.1.2 is in terms of the
role that these alphas play in their respective types of projects. Indeed, a software system aims
to satisfy the project requirements and serve the stakeholder needs in a software engineering
project; similarly, research artefacts aim to contain answers to the research questions and be of
value for the stakeholders in a social data science project. By contrast, the match between the
Scorecard Decks Infrastructure scorecards and the SEMATs Software System scorecards

is in terms of the specific real-world objects that these scorecards are concerned with  and,
crucially, of the states that these objects go through within the course of a project.
The SEMAT model provides some of its most rigorous and detailed advice to management of
specifically the Software System alpha. This is not surprising, since the model is developed
by software engineers and for software engineering teams. The Essence of Social Data Science
model retains this approach. While a social data science project can occasionally do with little
software engineering in its traditional form of designing and implementing own code, they
extensively rely on what Sommerville calls construction by configuration (Sommerville, 2008) 
building a system that satisfies the needs of the project by reuse of software components (external
and previously-built internal). The emphasis on reuse in construction by configuration suggests
that employing proper software engineering practices is no less important than in traditional
software engineering. In social data science, the benefits of reuse are quite self-evident when
the reused software components facilitate some form of advanced data processing functionality.
However, the experience of the studied project suggests that even in case of more trivial data
A.3. INFRASTRUCTURE 217
operations, reuse can bring research advantages that go beyond saving human effort for more
creative tasks. For example, in the InfoMigrants projects the data visualisation library that
was originally built during the Shakespeare Lives evaluation (see Section 3.2.6.4) was reused.
The reuse of the library led to (a) better stakeholder communication due to more effective final
editing of reports in the context of approaching deadlines, and (b) better research flow when data
visualisations were used for exploratory analysis during the rare (and thus especially valuable)
brainstorming team sessions: high quality charts produced on the spot proved to be a powerful
tool for generating and testing idea.
For the reasons outlined above, the Infrastructure alpha in the Scorecard Deck close follows its
SEMAT prototype and all its the states correspond to their homonyms in SEMATs Software
System alpha. Yet, there are some deviations caused by a supportive role infrastructure plays
in the social data science project (instead of being the direct artefact of such project) and the
project scope of the alpha. Below these deviations are discussed in detail.
A.3.1.1 State 1. Architecture Selected
Compared to the SEMAT prototype, a condition for defining boundaries of the software system
is removed (see Table A.14). This condition is only relevant when a software system by itself
is the promised outcome of a project, as in such cases the level of the commitment has to
be scoped. This is indeed the case in software engineering projects; however, in social data
science infrastructure plays a supporting role and addresses the needs of a team  not of project
stakeholders. Furthermore, hardware platforms are split into readily available on the on hand
and relevant and potentially available on the other. The fieldwork suggests that the hardware
component of infrastructure in a social data science project is often assembled ad-hoc with a
priority given to existing pieces of hardware even if they are not best-suited for the work. For
example, the computations for the Dark Net study were made on a server that just happened to
be in possession on one of the project investigators and otherwise stood idle.
A.3.1.2 State 2. Demonstrable
The scorecard closely follows its SEMAT prototype, although the conditions again stress that
a project infrastructure should satisfy the needs of its teem  not of its stakeholders (see Table
A.15).
A.3.1.3 States 3 and 4. Usable and Ready
Since infrastructure is not by itself an artefact of a social data science project, the need to
understand its value (as suggested as a condition for the Software System: Usable state of the

SEMAT model) can be relaxed  instead, understanding the appropriateness of the infrastructure
is suggested. For similar reasons, the SEMATs condition of desiring to use a software system is
not reflected in the scorecard of the Infrastructure: Ready state at all, as using infrastructure is
not voluntary in a social data science project (see Table A.16).
A.3.1.4 State 5. Operational
This state closely follows its SEMAT prototype, however it puts a strict condition of fully
supporting a social data science endeavour (see Table A.18). Indeed, here the infrastructure of a
whole project is implied, while a software system can be scoped arbitrarily.

A.3.1.5 State 6. Retired
Since the Infrastructure alpha  as all alphas in the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck 
is scoped to the level of an individual project, additional conditions on satisfaction of project
needs and on possibility of reuse are put onto its Retired state compared to its prototype in the
SEMAT model (see Table A.18). Ensuring Recomputability is listed as an additional condition
as well. It is inspired by the Recomputation manifesto (Gent, 2013) that states that sometimes
preserving research workflows is not enough to rerun the data processing jobs. This is confirmed
by Glatard et al. (2015) who show that even minor differences in system configuration may cause
reruns to fail. Gent (2013) therefore suggests to strive to recomputability instead  i.e. for
capturing the whole infrastructure in a form of a virtual machine thus creating a virtual copy of

A.4. TEAM 221
A.4 Team
This alpha is informed by the equivalent alpha of the SEMAT model, which is defined as a
group of people actively engaged in the development, maintenance, delivery, or support of a
specific software system. (OMG, 2015, p. 48). The alpha follows its prototype almost verbatim
and the progression of states is exactly the same in both models. Such close match is possible
since issues of team management transcend those of specifically software engineering or social
data science and are equally applicable to any kind of project. This manifests, for example,
in existence of widely recognised field-agnostic team leadership guidelines, best practices and
theories (e.g. Kozlowski et al., 1996; Zaccaro et al., 2001). The minor discrepancies that still
exist between the Scorecard Decks and the SEMATs representation of the Team alpha are
discussed below.
A.4.1.1 State 1. Seeded
The scorecard closely follows its SEMAT prototype, but further specifies a couple of conditions.
(see Table A.20). The condition of understanding the constraints on the team work is reformulated
into understanding the principal mode of team collaboration, i.e. whether the team will be co-
located or work remotely. The experience of all studied projects suggest that the issue of
co-location is of crucial importance and transcends the issues of ways of working. In the
Shakespeare Lives project, the choice of Sina Weibo as the primary source of Chinese data was
partially caused by the difficulties of collaboration on Twitter data acquisition criteria between a
project management located in England and a researcher located in China (see Section 3.2.7.1).
In the Hit List case study, my role of data consultant for the production team was motivated
by the fact that the analyst worked remotely and could not be that easily questioned above the
particularities of weekly data in real-time (see Section 3.3.2).
Another significant change is that the condition on understanding team commitment is clarified
in terms of time and effort each team member commits to put. In all the studied project, the
team members had other professional or study responsibilities. For example, most analysts in the
Open Universitys evaluation projects were either PhD students or early career researchers doing
consultancy work, the data science team (including the lead analyst) on the Hit List projects
were all academics in British Universities and the most producers were freelancers.
A.4.1.2 State 2. Formed
The state follows its SEMAT prototype with little to no deviations (see Table A.21).
222 APPENDIX A. SCORECARDS ADAPTED FROM THE SEMAT KERNEL MODEL

It is known whether the team will be co-located or col-
laborate remotely, and which degree of collaboration is

will be implemented (i.e. ways of working) do not need to
be known.

Table A.20: Team: Seeded. Conditions and prerequisites.
A.4.1.3 State 3. Collaborating
This states adds an additional condition of awareness of wider team progress compared its the
SEMAT prototype (see Table A.22). In bigger social data science projects, it is unfortunately
not uncommon for sub-teams that work on different strands to effectively lose touch with each
other. This effectively happened at one moment of time in the Shakespeare Lives project, as
the work on the Cultural Value strand was isolated from the work on the strand studying digital
engagement (which I participated in) until later on in the project. A more collaborative approach
could have potenrially made interpreting the findings of the digital engagement strand in the
terms of the Cultural Value Model a bit easier (see Section 3.2.5.3).

the scope of further work and the involved complexities.
Ways of Working: In-
formed
The principles, policies, tools and practices that inform,
facilitate and shape the way of working are selected.
Table A.21: Team: Formed. Conditions and prerequisites.
A.4.1.4 State 4. Performing
The only significant deviation from the SEMAT prototype that this states scorecard bears is the
absence of a condition on eliminating wasted work (see Table A.23). In social data science, as
in research in general, the work that is wasted in the sense that it does not contribute to the
final artefacts or do not add much value to them may still inform better, refined questions or
methods. In this sense, it is actually useful. The aforementioned example of switching to more
qualitative analysis in the InfoMigrants project in its second year after seeing low added value of
some previously taken strands of research is a great example of that (see Section 4.3.4.4).
A.4.1.5 State 5. Adjourned
The state follows its SEMAT prototype (see Table A.24). It omits the condition that team
members should be free to move on work on other projects, since, as mentioned above (see
Section A.4.1.1), in social data science team members are often free to work on several projects

alpha, as they aim to reflect the higher level of uncertainty involved in doing research.
A.5.1.1 State 1. Initiated
The state is informed by its homonym in the SEMAT model, although it removes the condition
of understanding the priorities in work (see Table A.25). In the studied projects the priorities
shifted quite significantly and evolved naturally. For example, in the Dark Net study, it seemed
initially that the focus would be on developing data acquisition code for as many marketplaces
as possible and on creating visual representations of the data. However, the work was soon
re-prioritised to building tools that would support analysis of the acquired data, as such analysis
was not trivial while even evidence from one platform was already very rich.

226 APPENDIX A. SCORECARDS ADAPTED FROM THE SEMAT KERNEL MODEL
A.5.1.2 State 2. Piloted
This state is absent in the SEMAT model and stems from the fieldwork observation (see Table
A.26). All studied project have included a pilot stage in some shape of form. In the earliest
weeks of the Hit List show only Twitter data were acquired and analysed, as this was the platform
with which the data science team had had past experience. Restricting the work to Twitter
analysis allowed to get a taste for the complexity of issues associated with the work  both
methodological such as separating news from noise and topics from each other (see Section
3.3.4) and organisation such as communicating remotely with the production team during their
meetings  and yet to do that in a lite mode, i.e. without needing to solve the hard task of
aggregating evidence from multiple platforms.
In the Dark Net study, the pilot work involved developing an early version of scraping code
for a particular marketplace for a limited-scope test scrape. This allowed to identify and scope
the risks associated with data scraping  interfering captchas, low uptime of markets, slowness
of Tor network and others. By the time the core work on the project started, the marketplace
for which the pilot code had been developed was shut down by law enforcement and thus the
code could not be reused. However, the lessons from the pilot work was still valuable not only
because the identified risks did translate to other marketplaces, but also because it motivated us
to consider the compliance issues early on in the project and thus have more time to formulate a
coherent compliance strategy for the main body of work.
As seen in both examples above, the pilot work was not trivial. It involved dealing with a subset
of the same tasks that the main body of work would subsequently include. Thus, it could be
considered taking first steps and it did require enabling  at least in the way of putting together
preliminary infrastructure and having some team members available.
A.5.1.3 State 3. Prepared
The state is informed by its homonym in the SEMAT model, but with many adjustments. Some
of the conditions (such as understanding risk exposure) are removed because they are already
covered by the introduced Work: Piloted state (see above). The previously omitted condition
of understanding work priorities (see Section A.5.1.1) is returned here since the pilot work may
allow to set those (see Table A.27). Finally, some are reformulated in terms of prerequisites
 for example, Acceptance criteria are defined and agreed with client. (p. 55) is changed to
Artefacts: Envisioned, since a valid vision for artefacts already includes the requirements for
those (see Section 4.3.5.2).
A.5. WORK 227
WORK: PILOTED The very first steps of work undertaken to better understand
the scope of further work and the involved complexities.
First steps enabled There is a good understanding of the initial chunks of work
that the seed team members could and should perform.
First steps taken The seed team members have made an attempt at the initial
chunks of work.
Complexity understood The initial steps of work further inform the complexity of
the work ahead.
Risks known There is an understanding of the risks that may hinder
the work. As far as possible, the magnitude of adverse
consequences and the chance of happening are estimated for
these risks.
Effort re-scoped The scope of the effort required for the work is better under-
stood and put into correspondence with what is practically
available.
Infrastructure: Demon-
strable
A prototype executable version of the infrastructure is avail-
able. It demonstrates the fit of the architecture for the project
purposes and for required testing.
Team: Seeded There are initial (seed) team members and the mechanisms
of expanding the team.
Compliance: Considered It is identified which ethical and legal concerns the project
raises.
Table A.26: Work: Piloted. Conditions and prerequisites.
A.5.1.4 State 4. Started
This state follows its SEMAT prototype and adds an extra condition of documenting the work
(see Table A.28). The importance of documenting the work has been shown above several
time  be that documentation for the compliance procedures (see Section 4.3.6.3) or for data
provenance (see Section 4.3.1.3). Also, the requirement of merely monitoring the work replaced
with a stronger one on iterating on the works intermediate outcomes. The importance of critical
reflection and iteration on work outcomes can be seen in the context of Hit List work, as over
time the analyst and the production team were getting progressively better in knowing the
idiosyncrasies of the collected data and could handle them more efficiently (see Sections 3.3.3.3
and 3.3.5.1).
A.5.1.5 State 5. Under Control
The SEMAT prototype is closely followed by this state (see Table A.29). Some conditions to the
quality of performance are omitted as they are effectively captured by the Team: Perfroming
prerequisite. Also, while the SEMAT model suggests having measure (p. 55) for progress,
228 APPENDIX A. SCORECARDS ADAPTED FROM THE SEMAT KERNEL MODEL
WORK: PREPARED The conditions required for the work to start are met.
Funding ready The funds are ready to be disposed on the work.
Priorities set If the project involves multiple questions to answer and / or
artefacts to produce, those are prioritised.
Overall plan established There is a feasible plan for the work to be undertaken, which
is still sufficiently flexible to account for the uncertainties
associated with research work.
Infrastructure: Ready The infrastructure is acceptable to be continuously deployed
in the project.
Team: Formed There is a sufficient number of engaged team members to
progress towards the teams goals.
Artefacts: Envisioned There is a clear, valid and agreed vision of the final artefacts.
Ways of Working: In-
formed
The principles, policies, tools and practices that inform,
facilitate and shape the way of working are selected.
Compliance: Progressed The team has taken the steps necessary to secure the compli-
ance resources and is ready to actively engage in the main
bulk of research subject to secured ethical clearances.
Table A.27: Work: Prepared. Conditions and prerequisites.
here the condition is relaxed to qualitative understanding of progress to reflect the open nature of
research work.
A.5.1.6 State 6. Concluded
The state strictly follows its SEMAT prototype (see Table A.30).
A.6 Ways Of Working
This alpha is informed by the Way-of-Working alpha of the SEMAT model, which is defined
as the tailored set of practices and tools used by a team to guide and support their work.
A.6.1.1 State 1. Informed
The scorecard for this state is heavily informed by the Way-of-Working: Foundation Established
state in the SEMAT model, but it suggests more possible sources to inform ways of working (see
Table A.31). They are analogous for those that can be used to inform compliance practices (see
Sections 4.3.6.1 and 4.3.6.2). One of the conditions implicitly suggests having a repository for
past practices. This does not reflect any particular fieldwork finding, but rather is a suggestion
that reflects one of the assumed uses of the Social Data Science Scorecard Deck, as different
A.6. WAYS OF WORKING 229
WORK: STARTED The team has started to put its required efforts into achieving
the projects goals.
Research started The work requires to answer the research questions is started.
Preliminary findings iter-
The initial findings start to emerge. Even if not being directly
useful for the artefacts by themselves, they at least provide a
direction for further work.
Work broken into
chunks
Possibly with the help of interim findings, the work starts
to get iteratively broken into manageable and actionable
individual pieces.
Progress tracked The progress of the work is routinely tracked and assessed.
Team members engaged The members of the team take on the appearing tasks and
progress them.
Documentation initiated The team has started to document the research- and overall
work process to a degree that at least allows traceability of
the works results and appropriate level of accountability
towards stakeholders.
Compliance: Secured The compliance resources required for the project are se-
cured to the degree that the team can fully engage in the
main body of the research work.
Table A.28: Work: Started. Conditions and prerequisites.
alphas and states in the deck can be used as a glossary to classify emerging practices, thus
naturally giving a convenient way to store and navigate them.
A.6.1.2 State 2. Employed
The scorecard for this state is heavily informed by the Way-of-Working: In Use state in the
SEMAT model, although it also suggests to note discrepancies between the ways of working
and the involved work (see Table A.32). One example of such discrepancis could be found in
the Shakespeare Lives project. In that project, a project management platform TeamWork was
employed to strengthen team collaboration (see Section 3.2.7). The platform was immensely
useful, however at the early stages of the project it did require the team members to adjust their
practices. For example, it took the team members a bit of time to actually switch to posting
on TeamWork instead of writing emails. What took even longer was developing habits on
inform relevant people within the team about new posts. When a researcher posted something
on TeamWork, they could choose whom to send an email notification to. At the beginning of
using TeamWork there was a strong tendency to notify an excessive number of people, since
including all was the default but over time we developed unwritten laws on whom from the
project managers and investigators to notify about each type of posting.
230 APPENDIX A. SCORECARDS ADAPTED FROM THE SEMAT KERNEL MODEL
WORK: UNDER CON-
The work goes productively and in a risk-managed environ-
ment.
Tasks handled There is a routine progress over the core tasks of the project.
The research questions are getting their answers.
Uncertainties managed There is a working system of practices oriented at managing
risks and uncertainties that, to an acceptable level of confi-
dence, does not allow unforeseen circumstances to prevent
further work.
Expectations managed The requirements for the desired artefacts and to the research
findings are revised to better match the practicalities of the
involved work.
Time constraints are
The work progresses with a tempo within the allowed time
constraints.
Progress firmly under-
stood
There is a robust system of progress tracking that allows the
team to firmly understand the degree of work progress and
to communicate it to the stakeholders.
Documentation managed The team makes sure that the documentation is constantly
updated and satisfies the requirements of accountability and
provenance traceability.
Infrastructure: Opera-
tional
The infrastructure is in continuous operational use.
Team: Performing The team is efficient and effective at progressing its work.
Compliance: Maintained The team works on the project while reactively and proac-
tively maintaining compliance.
Table A.29: Work: Under Control. Conditions and prerequisites.
A.6.1.3 State 3. Adapted
The scorecard follows the Way-of-Working: In Place SEMAT state and, in line with the
adjustments to the previous state, adds conditions on making corrections to the employed ways
of working to better fit the work and seeing improvements to the work (see Table A.33). In the
aforementioned example of using TeamWork for communication and notifying relevant team
members about new posts, over time we got progressively less communication were someone
expressed being annoyed with too much notifications. Simultaneously, useful brainstorming
discussion threads where whole sub-teams participated started to appear (such as the one on
intercoder reliability, see Section 3.2.7.2).
A.6.1.4 State 4. Optimised
The state follows the Way-of-Working: Working well SEMAT state and adds a condition on
minimising overheads caused by the ways of working (see Table A.34). An example of such
A.6. WAYS OF WORKING 231
WORK: CONCLUDED The team has finished its work on the social data science
endeavour.
Tasks fulfilled The tasks of the work have been fulfilled and their outcomes
can be demonstrated.
Work accepted The key stakeholders agree that the work may be considered
finished and accept its outcomes.
Archiving completed The results of the work, the documentation and any support-
ing evidence are properly achieved to the degree allowed by
the compliance requirements.
Stakeholders: Satisfied

The expectations of the stakeholder representatives have
been achieved.
Research Goals: Ful-

minimisation was my inclusion onto the Hit List team as a data consultant (see Section 3.3.2),
which allowed for more rapid investigations into the data if such an investigation was required
by the production team and for more seamless dialogue about the data.
A.6.1.5 State 5. Preserved
This state does not have a direct prototype in the SEMAT model. Rather, it again follows the
intention of the Scorecard Deck to foster preservation of practices that emerge in research work
(see Table A.35). The importance of practice preservation is evident in studied project. For
example, the practices for establishing inter-coder reliability developed in the Shakespeare Lives
project  pilot coding, sharing examples of coding with the team, working through some coded
entries with a project investigator  were reused in the InfoMigrants evaluation project. In this
case it was not difficult to do without formally storing the practices since the projects went one
after another with a short time gap. Yet again, since there was no formal storage of practices, it
is hard to judge whether some other useful practices were not reused. It is also not unreasonable
to suggest that should the gap in time be longer some of the reused practices could have been
forgotten.
