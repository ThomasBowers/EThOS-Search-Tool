ABSTRACT 
A revision of the genus Entada was made using data from gross morphology, seed 
and seedling morphology, palynology, anatomy and phytochemistry. 
A study of seed morphology allowed delimitation of closely-related species in this 
genus while seedling morphology enabled recognition of species even by first leaf 
morphology. Entada exhibits two germination patterns; climbers show epigynous 
germination, while trees and shrubs have hypogynous germination. Entada has 
tricolporate pollen grains with uniform morphology within sections. Pollen morphology 
exhibited by Entada shows links to the Caesalpinioideae. 
Among the vegetative characters studied were: habit, form, size and surface of the 
leaf, rachis and stem. Vegetative morphology. was found to be useful in delimiting 
species in the genus. Reproductive characters separated species very well even those 
that could not be separated vegetatively. 
A literature survey and fieldwork reveal that all the species in the genus are 
known to have economic importance of one kind or another: they have medicinal value, 
have a number of ethnobotanical uses as well as being used as food substitutes in some 
cases. 
The genus has been recognised to consist of 30 species (out of which 21 occur in 
Africa, 6 in Asia and 2 in America while one of them occurs in all three continents) and 
3 subspecies. These are classified into 8 sections of which section Suffruticosa is newly 
described. The genus has been split into two subgenera.

INTRUDUCTION 
1.1 THE LEGUMINOSAE 
The Leguminosae (Fabaceae) to which Entada belongs is a large family of 
herbs, shrubs and trees with a great variety of habit, including aquatics, xerophytes and 
climbers (Cronquist, 1968; Heywood, 1993). Many species are of enormous importance 
to man. The family is divided into three subfamilies viz. Mimosoideae, 
Caesalpinioideae and Papilionoideae, which are sometimes treated as discrete families. 
All the Leguminosae characteristically have a single carpel which forms a 
single superior ovary and is surmounted by the style and stigma. The ovules vary in 
number from two to many and are inserted in two alternating rows on a single placenta. 
Typically the fruit is a one chambered pod (legume) which may be constricted between 
the seeds (lomentum). It is sometimes indehiscent as in groundnut (Arachis) or it may 
open explosively, as in Brachystegia where the two walls of the pod twist up violently 
to throw out the seeds. The legumes may be dry or fleshy, inflated or compressed, 
winged or not, greenish or brightly coloured and range greatly in size. The seeds vary 
in number from one to many and often possess a tough coat. 
Classification 
The chief characteristics of the three subfamilies of the Leguminosae according 
to Heywood (1993) and Takhtajan (1958) are: 
Mimosoideae (Mimosaceae), mainly tropical and subtropical trees, shrubs and 
some herbs approximately 56 genera and 500-3000 species, leaves often 
bipinnate and the flowers regular with the petals valvate in bud, and with 10 or 
more stamens; 
Caesalpinioideae (Caesalpiniaceae), mainly tropical and subtropical trees and 
shrubs approximately 180 genera and 2500-3000 species, leaves usually 
pinnate but sometimes bipinnate and the flowers usually more or less irregular 
with lateral petals (wings) covering the standard in the bud, stamens 10 or 
fewer, free or monadelphous; 
Papilionoideae (Papilionaceae), temperate, tropical and subtropical in 
distribution, mostly herbs but some trees and shrubs amongst its 400-500 
genera and upwards of 10000 species, leaves usually pinnate but sometimes 
simple, flowers irregular with the lateral petals enclosed by the standard in the 
bud, stamens 10, usually diadelphous but sometimes monadelphous or free. 
1.2 MIMOSOIDEAE 
The distribution of species among the 56 genera recognised by Hutchinson 
(1964) is very uneven. Almost two thirds of the known species fall into three genera: 
Acacia, with 1200 species, Mimosa with 400-500 species and Inga with 350-400 species 
(Hutchinson, 1964; Elias, 1974). Many of the genera are small; nearly one-half of those 
recognised by Hutchinson (1964) are monotypic, and most of these are African. 
Present centres of greatest diversity of taxa are tropical America, Africa and 
Australasia. In tropical America, most species occur in Central and South America with 
fewer representatives in the West Indies. Several genera, Parkia, Pentaclethra, 
Newtonia, Entada, Albizia and Calliandra are native not only to Central and South 
America, but also West tropical Africa serving to link the floras of these two continents. 
Many of the African genera are monotypic (Tetrapleura, Fillaeopsis, Xerocladia, 
Amblygonocarpus and Cylicodiscus) or contain only a few species as in Pseudoprosopis. 
Although several genera are present in Asia and Australia, few (Adenanthera and 
Indopiptadenia) are restricted to that region (Elias, 1981). 
Members of the subfamily are common in lowland tropical rain-forests, 
especially near rivers and lakes. They have also successfully adapted to drier savannas, 
scrub or thorn forests and desert regions in tropical Africa and America. Mimosoid 
legumes are absent at higher elevations. 
Some species are tall canopy trees, while most are understorey trees and 
shrubs. Lianas are rare and there are very few herbs. The sole aquatic member of the 
subfamily is Neptunia oleracea, although N. plena can either be terrestrial or aquatic. 
The Mimosoideae are more closely linked to the Caesalpinioideae than to the 
Papilionoideae (Heywood, 1993). According to Elias (1981) the apparent link is 
between the caesalpinioid genus Dimorphandra and the mimosoid Pentaclethra. Both 
Dimorphandra and Pentaclenthra have similar bipinnate leaves, elongated spikes or 
often paniculate inflorescences, and small, regular bisexual flowers. The flowers have 
imbricate sepals, five fertile, free alternisepalous stamens and five or more staminodia 
(Elias, 1981). Pollen is shed as single grains in both genera. 
Traditional tribal classification 
The tribes of the Mimosoideae, according to the four most frequently used 
classification schemes are given in table 1.1. They are listed in order of appearance 
within each work. 
Table 1.1. Tribes of Mimosoideae (adapted from Elias, 1981) 
Bentham 
Taubert 
Schulze-Menz 
Hutchinson 
Parkieae Ingeae Ingeae Mimozyganthereae 
Piptadenieae Acacieae Acacieae Parkieae 
Adenanthereae Eumimoseae Mimoseae Acacieae 
Eumimoseae Adenanthereae Adenanthereae (including Mimoseae 
Piptadenieae) 
Acacieae Piptadenieae Mimozyganthereae Adenanthereae (including 
Piptadenieae) 
Ingeae Parkieae Parkieae Ingeae 
The order of tribes shown represents the authors' opinions on the relative advancement of each 
tribe: those at the top being primitive and those at the bottom, advanced. 
Bentham and Hutchinson considered that Ingeae, with its numerous stamens and 
occasional multiple carpels, contains the primitive extant members. Taubert and 
Schulze-Menz on the other hand expressed opposite views on the advanced versus 
primitive state, probably reflecting the differences in the English and German schools of 
floral evolution. 
According to Elias (1981), the tribe Adenanthereae has been distinguished 
from the Mimoseae solely on the presence of glands on the apex of the anthers. Other 
characters of the flower and pollen did not support this, hence he included the tribe 
Adenanthereae (including Piptadenieae) in Mimoseae therefore recognising only five 
tribes in the subfamily Mimosoideae. 
The tribes Acacieae, Ingeae and Mimoseae are the three principal groups of the 
mimosoid legumes. Elias (1981) considers that Mimozyganthereae and Parkieae should 
be recognised as highly specialised off-shoots. 
Within the Mimosoideae, the tribe Mimoseae is considered the extant base 
group, the Acacieae and Ingeae each displaying a greater level of specialisation and thus 
more recent evolution. 
1.3 MIMOSEAE 
The tribe Mimoseae, according to Eames (1981), to which Entada belongs, 
includes Bentham's Adenanthereae and Piptadeniaeae. The two latter tribes were 
separated from the Mimoseae by the usual presence of an anther gland which is 
generally lacking in Mimoseae (Eumimoseae), and from each other by endosperm in 
Adenanthereae but not in Piptadeniaeae (Lewis & Elias, 1981). 
With less reliance on the traditional characters of endosperm and anther-glands, 
the classification has become more dependent on fruit characters. In many cases the 
fruits and seeds seem to provide excellent generic markers (Brenan, 1955,1966), and it 
seems likely that once the more marked modifications, such as winged seeds, have 
arisen, such features will have persisted in that evolutionary line. 
Dependence on features from one organ can easily lead to artificial genera 
based on deceptively convergent modifications that can only be detected from a broader 
consideration of the variation pattern. Thus Brenan (1966) divided Entada into two 
subgenera, one of which, subgenus Acanthentada, includes the segregate Pseudoentada 
of Britton & Rose (1928). Subgenus Acanthentada has prickly branches, foliage glands, 
compound pollen grains, pubescent ovaries and the style tapering to a porate stigma, 
which, taken with the overall appearance, seems to place it with the Piptadenia group of 
genera rather than with the Entada group. Nevertheless the fruits are closely similar to 
those of Entada sect. Porphyrostachys, and Brenan was understandably uncertain about 
its status (Lewis & Elias, 1981). 
Because the classification has been dependent on fruit characters to the extent 
that species have been described in a wrong generic group, it is difficult to reorganise 
the genera without revision of all the species. 
Considering various features together, there seem to be a number of relatively 
small groups of genera in Mimoseae, a majority of which seem to have some 
representatives with a degree of similarity to the Dimorphandra group of the 
Caesalpinieae (fig. 1.1). 
The relationship of the Entada group is evident, especially when Entada sect. 
Porphyrostachys is compared with some species of Pseudoprosopis. The two genera, 
Elephantorrhiza and Entada, both have fruits breaking up to leave a persistent replum, 
mostly opposite leaflets, generally a stemonozone, simple pollen grains and a tubular 
style-tip. Plathymenia, from South America has flowers and disintegrating fruits like 
the Entada group, but there is no persistent replum, the seeds have a continuous 
pleurogram, and the base chromosome number is x=13 rather than x=14.

1.4 THE GENUS ENTADA 
1.4.1 Historical review of the genus 
The history of Entada dates back to 1763 when it was described by Michel 
Adanson (Lawrence, 1951). Infrageneric classification was established in the 19th 
century (Bentham, 1825) although after the revisions of the genus in the 20th century 
(Harms, 1915; Gilbert & Boutique, 1952; Torre, 1954; Brenan, 1955,1959,1966,1970) 
most of these species names became synonyms. 
Harms (1915) described 2 sections: 
1. Euentada, with the pod woody, broad and very large, under which E. 
scandens (L. ) Benth. was the only species mentioned. This section is now 
correctly known as Entada based on E. monostachya DC. the type of the 
genus. 
2. Neoentada. This was described as having pods small to medium-sized, and 
thinly woody, leathery or membranaceous. It includes, apparently, all the 
African species except those with giant pods. 
Britton & Rose (1928), recognised three genera in the affinity of Entada as follows: - 
Stout, unarmed, climbing vines, rarely shrubby; legume chartaceous or woody, 
very large. 
Legume woody; leaves terminating in tendrils; spikes solitary, 2 or 3 
Legume chartaceous; leaves mostly ecirrhiferous; spikes in terminal 
Slender, clambering, woody, ecirriferous vine; legume thin, not very 
Brenan (1955,1959) and Torre (1954) were the main workers on the genus 
throughout the 1950s. White (1959) described E. bacillaris as a new species found in 
Zambia and Tanzania for which he wrote a detailed description of the sites where the 
specimens were collected. 
Brenan (1966) discussed the subdivisions of Harms (1915) who recognised two 
sections: subgenus Entada and Acanthentada. 
Brenan (1966) selected E. abyssinica Steud. ex A. Rich., a common species 
prominently mentioned by Harms, and representative of the largest group of the African 
species, as the lectotype of the sect. Neoentada. 
In the same work Brenan (1966) further subdivided Entada into two subgenera 
and six sections (table 1.2). 
Ross (1975) discussed four species of Entada which occur in South Africa of 
which three were known to Harvey (1894) when he wrote his account of the genus: E. 
pursaetha DC.; E. wahlbergii Harv., and E. natalensis Benth. The fourth species which 
Ross discussed is E. arenaria which he split into subsp. arenaria and subsp. 
microcarpa. The earliest collections of this taxon, Germain 6130,6295 and 6509 were 
originally determined as E. flexuosa Hutch. & Dalz. (i. e. E. wahlbergii Harv. ) which 
they superficially resemble, but from which they very clearly differ in the raised 
venation on the lower surface of the leaflets. In Flore du Congo Belge (Gilbert & 
Boutique, 1952) they were included under Entadopsis flexuosa. 
E. phaneroneura was newly described by Brenan in 1978 to add to his earlier 
survey published in 1966 and this is now included in section Porphyrostachys. 
Later, Brenan (1986) removed all five species from Entada subgenus 
Acathentada (table 1.2) and put them in a closely related genus Adenopodia Presl.

Malesiana which includes five species:. E. borneensis Ridley, E. parvifolia Merr., E. 
phaseoloides Merr., E. rheedii Spreng., and E. spiralis Ridley. 
1.4.2 Description of the genus 
According to Allen & Allen (1981), the name "Entada" is presumed to come 
from the Portuguese word, "d'entada", which means toothed, in reference to the prickles 
on the stems and the leaves of some species. They are woody lianas, often tall 
climbers, shrubs or trees, armed with prickles or unarmed. The leaves are bipinnate; 
pinnae pairs several, the uppermost pair sometimes modified into a forked tendril; 
leaflets large and few or small and numerous; stipules small, setaceous. The flowers are 
small, sessile, creamy yellow, green, red, or purple, hermaphrodite, in slender, axillary, 
spiked racemes or terminal panicles, calyx campanulate; teeth 5, equal, narrow, short; 
petals 5, longer than the calyx, free or slightly joined, valvate; stamens 10, free or 
joined at the base, short-exserted; filaments linear or filiform; anthers with a deciduous, 
apical gland; ovary subsessile, many-ovuled; style one, filiform; stigma truncate, 
concave. Pods subsessile or long-stalked, straight or curved, often very large, flat, thin 
and woody; sutures thickened, persistent, continuous; valves transversely jointed, 
breaking away at the sutures into 1-seeded, indehiscent segments; endocarp persistent 
and separating from the exocarp. Seeds flat, large, round (Bentham & Hooker, 1865; 
Baker, 1930; Gilbert & Boutique, 1952a; Brenan, 1959). 
Members of the genus are native to the tropics. There are about 18 species in 
Central and East Africa and Madagascar, 10 species in Asia and 4 in America (Brenan, 
1970). They occur in lowland rain- and streamside forests, coastal thickets, riverine 
areas, savannas, and sandy soil (Allen & Allen, 1981). 
Frequent mention is made of the enormous size of the fruits of these species. 
Menninger (1967, cited in Allen & Allen, 1981) credits Entada vines with having the 
largest leguminous pods; those of E. phaseoloides (L. ) Merr. (referred to as E. scandens 
(L. ) Benth. in the text), the St. Thomas tree, measure over a metre long by 12.5 cm in 
width. Quisumbing (1951) described the angled, twisted, and slightly curved stems of 
this woody climber as being as thick as a man's arm and the pendant pods as measuring 
30-100 cm long by 7-10 cm wide. 
At maturity the valves of Entada pods split transversely into 1-seeded 
segments. The exocarp of the pod peels away, and the endocarp remains around the 
seed as an envelope. The seeds are mahogany brown and smooth, elliptic, flat, and 
vary in number from 10 to 15. The large round seeds of E. phaseoloides are known as 
`ai lavo' by Fijians; this is now their term for money, a word unknown to them when 
exchange was entirely by barter (Allen & Allen, 1981). Because each valve segment of 
the broken pod of E. polystachya (L. ) DC. is the size of a calling card, this climber is 
called the `Calling Card Vine' (Allen & Allen, 1981). 
Large seeded section Entada particularly species like E. gigas and E. rheedii 
have world wide distribution. This could be linked to seed dispersal. These species are 
principally found to grow along or around water bodies (rivers, lake or sea shores) and 
their seed are dispersed by water (Betharn-Jutting, 1977; Hurtley, 1982; Reddy, 1990; 
Rushton, 1988). This is therefore presumed to be an explanation for its worldwide 
distribution. 
1.5 TAXONOMIC TREATMENTS AND SPECIES DESCRIPTION 
The taxonomic treatment is principally built on major works by Brenan (1959,1966, 
1970), in Africa, and Nielsen (1985,1992), in Asia. A few descriptions have been 
translated and modified from the original descriptions (Brenan, 1978; Ridley, 1898; 
Villiers,, 1982).

several, the uppermost pair sometimes modified into a forked tendril; leaflets large and 
few or small and numerous. Inflorescences of spiciform racemes or spikes, which are 
axillary or supra-axillary, solitary or clustered and often  aggregated. Flowers small, 
sessile or pedicellate, creamy, yellow, green, red, or purple; male or bisexual. Calyx 
cupulate, gamosepalous, with 5 teeth, equal, narrow and short. Petals 5, longer than the 
calyx, free or slightly joined, valvate, separated from ovary-base by very short 
perigynous zone composed of stamens adnate to an apparent corolla tube. Stamens 10,

with a usually very caducous apical gland. Pollen grains single, usually tricolporate. 
Ovary subsessile, many-ovuled; style one, filiform; stigma truncate, concave. Pods 
subsessile or long-stalked, woody or coriaceous, straight or curved, flat or rarely spirally 
twisted, sometimes very large; at maturity the valves (but not the margins) splitting 
transversely into 1-seeded segments from which the outer layer (exocarp) of the pod- 
wall often peels off, the inner layer (endocarp) persisting as a closed envelope around 
the seed; the segments falling away from the margins, which persist as a continuous, but 
empty, frame. Seeds  compressed, mostly elliptic or subcircular, flat, small or large,

proposal to conserve the genus. In 1988 Panigrahi's proposal was accepted 
(ICBN, 1988) placing formally the type of the genus, E. monostachya DC. into 
nomenclatural synonymy as it shares same basionym; Mimosa entada L..

woodland and Combretum-Acacia vlei among rocks. It is also common in 
riparian thickets in river valleys such as the Luangwa. 
DISTRIBUTION: Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Madagascar. 
NOTE: Specimen Astle 1740 (SRGH) is densely pubescent, which makes it 
doubtful if it belongs to E. chrysostachys and hence the need for further studies. 
I tentatively propose it to be a variant of E. arenaria although there have 
been no known E. arenaria with a tree habit.

1.6 OBJECTIVES 
The objectives of the study are to compile a taxonomic revision of the genus and 
explore the economic uses of the various species known. Species relationships and 
delimitation were investigated by examination of. seed morphology; seedling 
morphology; pollen morphology; anatomical structure; phytochemical analysis; and 
general plant morphology. 
Chapter Two 
ECONOMIC BOTANY 
2.1 Importance of plants 
Plants are fundamentally important to the life of man. Legumes are particularly 
important as a rich source of nitrogen to man both directly, through seeds, and 
indirectly as forage crops and green manure. 
In recent years various economic problems with agriculture have become 
increasingly important. Most agricultural problems are physical, rather than economic, 
in nature, and are concerned more with productivity than production. The practice of 
farming necessarily brings about the destruction of the natural vegetation, which has a 
protective function; this induces conditions that result in the deterioration of the soil. 
This deterioration may consist of the exhaustion of the mineral nutrients, which is not a 
serious matter since it can be compensated for by the use of fertilizers, or it may 
comprise the permanent loss of the soil through erosion. 
Corrective measures to agricultural production may require replanting of suitable 
plants (often leguminous) in a farming system -a process called agroforestry. 
Leguminous tree species have therefore been found to be suitable in correcting soil 
productivity since they are believed to nodulate and fix nitrogen which has been 
identified as one of the major limiting nutrients to crop production. 
2.2 Uses of some species of Entada 
Entada phaseoloides (L. ) Merr. produces the largest legumes. The bark contains 
saponin; used in oriental countries for washing the hair. It is used in South Africa as 
soap. It is sold in bazaars. Young leaves are eaten as a vegetable and the beans are 
consumed roasted. The plant is a source of fibre; used in some countries for fishing 
nets, sails and cords (Uphof, 1968; Usher, 1974). In Sumatra and Java seeds are eaten 
cooked like chestnuts and pods furnish food in the West Indies. In Jamaica, it is 
reported that the beans after being soaked in water for a long time, are boiled and eaten 
by some Negroes (Hendrick, 1972). 
The seed is used for infants to bite during teething and also as a remedy in 
cerebral haemorrhage. The seed has on occasion been substituted for that of 
Physostigma venenosum Balf. in commerce (Marloth, 1913 cited in Watt & Breyer- 
Brandwijk, 1932). The roasted pods and seed are a coffee substitute, and are said to be 
purgative. The taste of the seed is bitter and acrid. In Queensland it is thought to be 
very poisonous and in both South Africa and the Philippines the plant is used as fish 
poison. The seed also contains saponin. In Europe the seed, according to Watt & 
Breyer-Brandwijk (1932) was said to have been used as snuff, tinder and matchboxes. 
A strong decoction of the root of E. wahlbergii Harv. is taken for sharp pains in 
the chest (non-tubercular). The bark is also used as a remedy for colds in horses. In 
some parts of South Africa, the natives use the plant as a syphilis remedy by eating the 
ground-up cooked root and smearing the powdered leaf over the affected parts. The 
Zulus use an infusion of the root as an emetic and they also feed the dried powdered 
root to goats to fatten them (Watt & Breyer-Brandwijk, 1932). 
A resin from the trunk of E. polyphylla Benth. is used for dyeing leather black 
(Usher, 1974; Uphof, 1968). 
The tough stems of E. polystachya (L. ) DC., a large scandent shrub, are used as 
cordage in tropical America and when crushed in water they are used as a soap 
substitute (Usher, 1974; Uphof, 1968). 
Young leaves of E. phaseoloides Merr. are eaten steamed or raw. Seeds are 
consumed after long cooking (Tanaka, 1976). 
The beautiful seeds of E. rheedii Spreng. are largely employed for crimping 
linen in certain parts of India, especially in Bengal and the United Provinces; they are 
also hollowed out into boxes and other articles. They are reputed to have emetic 
properties, but the white kernels on being steeped in water and after roasting are 
sometimes eaten by local people (Chopra et al., 1940; Tanaka, 1976). These authors 
have been informed that absence of this precaution produces deleterious effects of a 
narcotic nature. 
The seeds are used as a fish poison in some parts of India, South Africa and in 
the Philippine Islands, and it is recorded that the juice of the leaves is employed in 
Ceylon for stupefying fish (Chopra et al., 1940). 
The seeds contain two toxic saponins which were biologically tested for their 
poisonous properties on fish; they are also said to contain a glucoside which is 
hydrolysed by emulsin. The wood and the bark also contain toxic saponins, but these 
are absent in the leaves (Chopra et al., 1940). 
The bitter roots of E. wahlbergii Harv. are sometimes eaten in Africa during 
famine (Hendrick, 1972; Tanaka, 1976). 
The root of E. abyssinica A. Rich. is said to contain a saponin and an alkaloid, 
both active. Some tribes in Zambia use the sap, introduced under the eyelid as an 
ordeal poison. The powdered seed is used as an eye remedy, the bark for chronic 
coughs and abdominal pains, the leaves as a fever remedy, dressing for sores and a rain 
making charm (Lungu, 1992). The roots are a remedy for madness, fits in children, 
fever, rheumatism, chest pains and also used as a hunting charm (Fanshawe, unpubl. 
cited in Lungu, 1992). 
E. africana Guill. & Perr. yields a small amount of rotenone and an inferior gum 
consisting of about 10% gum tragacanth and 90% gum arabic (Howes, 1949 cited in 
Allen & Allen 1981). 
A decoction of roots of E. dolichorrhachis Brenan is used to treat diarrhoea and 
is also used for treatment of gonorrhoea (Lungu, 1993). Roots are also used for fish 
poisoning. 
A bitter root decoction of E. bacillaris F. White is used to treat diarrhoea and 
general stomach pains (Lungu, 1993), while a decoction of E. bacillaris var. plurijuga 
Brenan is also used as a cleansing agent in cases of poisoning in a village. A victim is 
given a small quantity of the root infusion to induce vomiting. 
A steam bath from the leaf decoction is used to treat fits especially in children. 
The soft leaves of E. arenaria Schinz. are used as a substitute for toilet paper in 
villages (Lungu, 1993) while the powder from dried roots is used to treat persistent 
sores, called "Sibongola" in Lozi languages. In the absence of this medicine, these 
sores do not heal and the only option is to remove the affected limb. 
A root decoction of E. nudiflora Brenan is used for treatment of stomach ache 
and severe diarrhoea (Lungu, 1993). For diarrhoea the patient is made to sit in a root 
decoction to get rid of rectal infection. Powder made from the tuber is used in beer, tea 
or any other foodstuffs as an aphrodisiac. 
The plant also has magical uses whereby a fisherman will use it to make other 
people catch fish for him at night while he is sleeping. 
The root infusion of E. gigas (L. ) Fawc. & Rendle is administered to a 
premature baby or it is bathed in it to make it strong (Lungu, 1993). The fibre is used 
for building and making traps for animals. 
The bark of E. chrysostachys (Benth. ) Drake is used as fibre and it is also used 
for fish poisoning (Lungu, 1993). 
Chapter Three 
SEED MORPHOLOGY 
3.1 INTRODUCTION 
The ovule from which the seed develops shows a great range of structural 
variation, not only in external shape but also in internal anatomy (Sporne, 1974). This 
range of structural variation is also seen in the seeds. Seed size has been considered as 
perhaps of phylogenetic importance (Eames, 1961) but gross and micro-morphology 
have more often been used. Seeds may vary in form, size, colour and arillar investment 
and it is the microscopic structure of the seed-coats which supplies the critical detail for 
systematic purposes (Corner, 1976). Seed characters are known to be linked to 
microhabitat requirements for germination but are in general considered to be highly 
conservative. It is for this reason that seed morphology has been considered an 
important taxonomic character worth investigation. 
3.2 MATERIALS AND METHOD 
Seeds of Zambian species were mostly collected during 1992 (Lungu, 1993), 
further species were obtained from other sources (table 3.1). They were observed under 
low magnification with the light microscope and photographs taken. Measurements 
were taken of the seed length, width and thickness with a vernier calliper. 
For observation under the scanning electron microscope, the seeds were stuck 
to stubs with silver paint. They were left for 10 minutes to dry. They were then coated 
to 30nm with gold and were scanned on a JOEL JSM 35R Scanning Electron 
Microscope (SEM). Measurements of seed shape and comparative morphology were 
taken as shown in plate 3.1. 
3.3 RESULTS 
Seed length, width and thickness measurements are shown in table 3.2. Light 
micrographs are presented in plate 3.1.

could easily be confused (seed features) with E. abyssinica (SL 004, SL 005, SL 012) 
but the most distinguishing feature tends to be an areole which is heart shaped and 
become more diffuse near the hilum while it forms aC shape in E. abyssinica (see fig. 
3.2). 
Most of the seeds collected have an oval shape with a length to width (L/W) 
ratio of 1: 1.3 with an exception of SL 028 which had a ratio of 1: 1. A narrower shape 
is observed in SL 022 with IJW ratio of 1: 1.7.

3.4 DISCUSSION 
The seed morphology of Entada falls into two major categories; small and 
areolate, or large and exareolate. These categories distinguish the sections Entada and 
Neoentada respectively. 
The shape, size and position of the areole was seen to be constant within a 
species but variable among species and was proved to be a valuable feature for 
identification. Field collections of Entada (SL 010 and SL 031) which appeared to be 
of different species, based on morphology in the dry season, appeared conspecific on 
the basis of seed morphology. This was later proved on the basis of vegetative 
morphology of these plants in cultivation. In this case, seed morphology was more 
valuable than field observation of the adult plant when out of leaf. 
In the T-test analysis (Appendix IV), seed characters in combination 
distinguish E. abyssinica from E. chrysostachys and E. camerunensis, though no 
individual character alone groups all four samples of E. abyssinica. Seed width is the 
only character which groups E. camerunensis and E. chrysostachys. This implies that 
ssed characters when treated as a whole are diagnostic. 
The exareolate species sampled so far can also be distinguished on basic 
morphological features. The length versus width (90 to length on flat surface of seed) 
ratio and the shape of the edges of the seed (tapered or blunt) proved reliable in 
distinguishing E. gigas from E. phaseoloides. More extensive sampling of this group of 
species may exhaust the fairly low number of characters available from this seed type.

SEEDLING MORPHOLOGY 
4.1 INTRODUCTION 
A dicotyledonous seedling consists of a root, a hypocotyl, cotyledons, and 
plumular bud. Stems and leaves are formed through secondary development, which, in 
some seedling types occurs in the seed where a first internode or first internodes and 
two or more first leaves may already be present in the form of a plumule. After 
germination this plumule enlarges, after which growth of the epigeal parts halts 
temporarily, for a certain, often specific period (de Vogel, 1980). This is followed by 
continued growth. 
Seedlings have mostly been classified into two main groups, epigeal and 
hypogeal, based on the position of the cotyledons and whether or not the testa and fruit 
wall are shed (de Vogel, 1980). 
Differences in seedling morphology have sometimes been a basis for re- 
arrangement of classifications (de Vogel, 1980). It has been assumed, sometimes 
tacitly, that, in natural genera, the seedlings must be similar. 
In agroforestry land use systems the major component is the woody species 
planted as tree hedgerows. Before these hedgerows can be established, seedlings are 
raised in the nursery where it has often been observed that the stand is not pure. The 
construction of keys for such species at the seed and seedling stage will facilitate 
identification at this early stage. This study aims to produce keys to predominantly 
Zambian Entada Adans. species that can be used by a wide range of people. 
4.2 MATERIALS AND METHOD 
Seeds of Zambian species were mostly collected during 1992 (Lungu, 1993), 
further species were obtained from other sources (table 2.1). 
One set of seeds was soaked in water at room temperature for 24 hours. They 
were then transferred to plastic boxes with moist tissue paper. They were covered with 
another moist tissue paper to keep the seeds moist for a longer time. A second set of 
seeds was put in hot (95C) water which gradually cooled while the soaking continued 
for 24 hours. They were then transferred to plastic boxes with moist tissue paper. 
They were observed on a daily basis to check on germination. Entada gigas and E. 
phaseoloides did not germinate in either case, therefore they were scarified and acid 
treated for 10 minutes. Hot water soaking overnight was done in each case except for 
these gigantic seeds, where soaking was done for two weeks. Except for E. gigas and 
E. phaseoloides, 20 seeds were soaked in each experiment and observed for 
germination. 
When a radicle appeared, the seeds were planted at 5 mm depth in pots filled 
with John Innes No. 1 compost with extra sand and their emergence and subsequent 
growth observed. 
4.3 RESULTS 
Germination results are shown in table 4.1. Photographs of seedlings are 
presented in plates 4.1 - 4.6.

4.4 OBSERVATION AND DISCUSSION 
From the seedlings raised, four species have been recognised. Given below are 
the descriptions of the four species in their representative groups. 
4.4.1 Entada "2" (Pseudoprosopisfischeri (Taub. ) Harms) - SL 003 
Germination is easy; 45% in 7 days under cold water soaking. The need 
for hot water treatment was not felt, as germination was sufficient after cold 
water treatment. The seedling is epigeal with the first 3 leaves in a whorl. The 
seedlings take 10 or more days to emerge. 
The first eight leaves that developed are once pinnate leaves. Pinnae 
pairs range from 2-8 with successively more pinnae pairs being observed in 
younger leaves (plate 4.1 a. ). 
The 9th and 10th leaf were bipinnate with 2 pinnae pairs and 5-7 pairs of 
pinnules. From the 12th leaf, pinnae pairs increased from 2-3 with pinnule pairs 
being 5-9. There was no change in pinnae pairs until the 16th leaf which had 4 
pinnae pairs and 6-9 pairs of leaflets. 
After seven months of observation, P. fischeri had put on 16 leaves. 
Growth was very slow (<50cm high and root collar diameter (RCD) of 4mm in 
seven months) as compared to other species of Entada which were growing 
under the same conditions but had attained more than 100cm. 
4.4.2. Entada abyssinica Steud. ex A. Rich. - SL 004,005,008,012 
Germination varied according to provenance. SL 004 did not germinate 
at all under cold water soaking while it was 10% for SL 008 and 012 in seven 
and nine days respectively and 25% in seven days for SL 005 under the same 
conditions. Germination was improved greatly, 65% in seven days and 80% in 
10 days with hot water soaking for SL 004 and 005 respectively, while it went 
down to zero for SL 008 and 012. 
E. abyssinica seeds take 7-15 days to emerge when planted at 5mm 
depth. The seedlings are hypogeal with leaves arranged alternately. 
The first 3 leaves are pinnate with 7-12 pinnae pairs (plate 4.1. b., 4.4 
and 4.5). The lower half of the 4th leaf is bipinnate, 2 pinnae pairs with 5-7 
pinnule pairs and the upper half continue with 6-8 pairs of simple pinnate 
leaflets (see plate 4.4). The 5th leaf has 1-2 pinnae pairs with 7-15 pinnule pairs 
but no simple pinnate leaflets. With the development of the 6-9th leaves, 2-3 
pinnae pairs are observed with pinnule pairs increasing to 8-16. The 10-11th 
leaves were bipinnate with 2-3 pinnae pairs and 8-12 pairs of pinnules. 
After the 11th leaf, pinnae pairs varied from 3-5 with 15-24 pairs of 
pinnules. Pinnae pairs increased from 4-8 after the 15th leaf with 12-24 pinnule 
pairs. At the 20th leaf, E. abyssinica had 5-12 pinnae pairs and 21-30 pairs of 
pinnules. 
The seedlings of E. abyssinica seemed to have attained mature leaf 
characters at seven months after the 28th leaf which had 9-16 pairs of pinnae 
and 25-31 pairs of pinnules. 
4.4.3. Entada chrysostachys (Benth. ) Drake - SL 010 
Germination was 15% after seven days with cold water soaking but was 
75% after eight days under the hot water treatment. 
Seedlings take five days to emerge when planted to 5mm depth and are 
epigeal with the first two leaves in an opposite arrangement. 
The first 2 leaves are pinnate with 14-17 pinnae pairs. The third leaf has 
the lower half bipinnate with 2 pinnae pairs and 5-8 pinnule pairs while the last 
half has a simple pinnate form with 6 pairs of simple pinnae (see plate 4.2). 
The fourth leaf is bipinnate with 2 pinnae pairs and 6-7 pinnule pairs. From 
14th March when the 4th leaf was observed, there was no additional leaf 
development for six weeks. 
The seedlings of E. chrysostachys were in a resting stage for six weeks 
before they resumed growth. The 5-7th leaves were bipinnate with 2 pinnae 
pairs and 8-12 pairs of pinnules. The 8th leaf was bipinnate with 3 pinnae pairs 
and 8-12 pairs of pinnules. The 9-11th leaf was bipinnate with 2-3 pinnae pairs 
and 7-13 pairs of pinnules. 
After the 11th leaf, growth became rapid and within 2 weeks the plants 
had put on an average of 3 leaves with 4-5 pairs of pinnae and 10-14 pairs of 
pinnules. During the following 2 weeks, they put on 4 leaves (14-19th) with 4-6 
pairs of pinnae and 11-17 pairs of pinnules. 
The 20th leaf showed modification of the petiolules for climbing. The 
leaves had 4-6 pairs of pinnae and 13-17 pairs of pinnules. It was assumed that 
at this stage, E. chrysostachys seedlings had attained adult characters. 
4.4.4. Entada "5" (E. camerunensis) - SL 022 
Germination was low, 10% in 12 days under cold water soaking. It 
improved to 85% in 10 days with hot water soaking. 
Seedlings took seven days to emerge when planted 5mm deep. The 
seedling is epigeal with the first 2 leaves in an opposite arrangement (see plate 
4.3). 
The first 2 leaves are simple pinnate with 4-11 pinnae pairs. The third 
leaf is bipinnate with 1 pinna pair and 8 pinnule pairs. The fourth leaf is 
bipinnate with 2 pinnae pairs and 6-7 pinnule pairs. The 5th and 6th leaves have 
2 pinnae pairs but with an increase in pinnule pairs to 7-9. The 7th leaf has 3 
pinnae pairs with 7-10 pinnule pairs and the 8th leaf is bipinnate with 4 pinnae 
pairs and 4-10 pinnule pairs. The 9-12th leaf is bipinnate with 4 pinnae pairs 
and 10-14 pinnule pairs. The 13-19th leaves are bipinnate with 4-5 pinnae pairs 
and 9-14 pinnule pairs after which the number of pinnae pairs varied between 4 
and 5 and pinnule pairs 9-14. After the 25th leaf development, petioles were 
modified for coiling. 
After the 25th leaf, E. camerunensis seedlings seemed to have assumed 
mature characters. The time for the plants to reach this stage was six months. 
During the first 2 months, the plant had 2 pinnate leaves. The appearance of the 
third leaf at the end of the second month showed a change to bipinnate division. 
The bipinnate division started on the proximal end with one pinna pair with 8 
pairs of pinnules while the rest of the leaf was simply pinnate. From the fourth 
leaf E. camerunensis had bipinnate leaves. 
After seven months of growth, E. camerunensis produced axillary 
inflorescences but the first flowers set were dropped before anthesis.

PALYNOLOGY 
5.1 INTRODUCTION 
The study of pollen grains started in the 17th century with Nehemiah Grew 
and Marcello Malpighi (Nair, 1977) and advanced little until the major works of 
Wodehouse (1935) and Erdtman (1943,1952). 
The tetrad stage is very important in pollen grain development as this is the 
stage where the final shape and position of apertures is determined. These are the 
characters which are most useful in distinguishing different pollen types and are 
consequently important in taxonomy (Ferguson, 1979). 
The mature angiosperm pollen grain is normally a regular rotation ellipsoid 
with a polar axis and equatorial plane (Ferguson, 1979). The shape of pollen grains 
varies greatly from spheroidal to semi triangular in outline, to boat shaped and even 
pear-shaped. The apertures also vary in number, position and type. The commonest 
types are pores (porate) and furrows (colpate or sulcate or colporate) (Erdtman, 1952; 
Ferguson, 1979; Sporne, 1974; Wodehouse, 1935). 
5.2 MATERIALS AND METHOD 
Mature unopened flower buds were taken from specimens collected in Zambia 
and herbarium material on loan from Kew herbarium and elsewhere (see table 5.1). 
Some specimens did not have unopened buds, in which case an open flower was used.

The flower bud was placed in a watch glass and one or two drops of water 
were added and heated to soften the flower. When the flower was fully softened, it was 
teased open with fine forceps and a mounted needle under the dissecting light 
microscope to release the pollen. In cases where the flower was already open and it 
was difficult to find pollen, anthers were put in the middle of the watch glass and teased 
open with mounted needles or crushed with a glass stirring rod to release the pollen. 
Finally the anther fragments were drawn to the side of the watch glass leaving just 
pollen in the middle. 
A. Light microscope samples 
A watch glass containing pollen was put on a hot plate to evaporate the water 
to complete dryness. After the pollen was dry, 6 drops of acetolysis mixture (made by 
mixing 9 parts of acetic acid and 1 part of concentrated sulphuric acid) was added and 
the watch glass was put back on the hot plate. The mixture was observed until it turned 
straw-brown and then the watch glass was removed from the hot plate and left to cool 
for 5 minutes. 
After the watch glass was cooled, 9 drops of industrial methylated spirit were 
added drop by drop from a bulb pipette to the centre of the remaining acetolysis 
mixture causing it to migrate to the rim. The displaced acetolysis mixture was wiped 
from the rim of the watch glass with tissue paper. At this point a micropipette was 
used to take out pollen for SEM. When all the acetolysis mixture was wiped out and 
the methylated spirit evaporated, a small block of glycerine jelly with safranin was 
added to the pollen with a fine scalpel. 
The glycerine jelly was rolled over the pollen in the watch glass until all, or 
most, of the grains had adhered to it. The block of glycerine jelly was transferred to a 
glass slide on a hot plate at 60C. When the glycerine jelly had completely melted, 
bubbles were drawn to the side with a mounted needle and a warm cover glass was 
lowered onto the glycerine jelly. The slide was removed from the hot plate and left to 
cool. 
The slides were viewed under a compound microscope to confirm presence of 
pollen grains. After the slide was confirmed good, it was sealed with nail varnish. 
Pictures of pollen grains were taken at x100 magnification under oil immersion. 
B. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) samples 
A cover slip was cut with a diamond pencil to the appropriate size. It was 
stuck to the SEM stub by a piece of double sided sticky tape. This gave a neutral, 
smooth, background. A drop from a micropipette containing pollen was put on the 
cover slip on the stub. The stub was then put in a petri-dish, covered, and left to dry 
overnight. 
The stubs were sputter-coated to 30nm with gold. The pollen was scanned on 
a JOEL T-20 SEM.

5.4 DISCUSSION 
Among the pollen grains observed only Pseudoprosopis fischeri (Taub. ) Harms 
was found to be a polyad. The rest of the pollen grains observed were tricolporate or 
triporate (plates 5.1,5.2,5.3,5.4,5.5 and 5.6). This is in line with Guinet (1981) who 
said that the colpate pollen type does exist in the Mimosoideae. 
Pollen grains of Entada are basically simple, mostly tricolporate. They show 
variation in the nature of colpi and pores. The shape is mostly spherical, but they vary 
greatly in size. The pollen surface is perforate in all Entada species unlike the granular 
or baculate surfaces which Guinet (1981) said are often encountered in Mimosoideae. 
E. arenaria has a scabrate-perforate sculpture while E. dolichorrhachis has a perforate 
tectum like the rest (plate 5.4 fig. D). 
The pollen grains of Entada are similar to those of the tribe Caesalpinieae 
(subfamily Caesalpinioideae) to which the genus Dimorphandra belongs. Pollen grains 
of the tribe Caesalpinieae have either perforate, scabrate-perforate, finely reticulate or 
reticulate sculpture (Graham and Barker, 1981). 
The pollen surface morphology of Elephantorrhiza (SL 009) is very similar to 
that of Entada. Similarly, the pollen surface morphology of Erythrophleum has same 
features as those of Entada. It represents the characteristic sculpture of pollen grains 
often encountered in the subfamily Caesalpinioideae. The difference which this grain 
possesses lies in the shape. The pollen grain of Erythrophleum has a longer polar axis 
than equatorial (fig. 5.5 fig. F), which in Entada are almost the same. 
Guinet (1981) stated that pollen grains of Pseudoprosopis have asymmetric 
tricolporate or triporate forms of aperture. But in the specimen of P. fischeri which I 
studied, I did not see any apertures. Light micrographs show the dispersal unit to be a 
polyad (fig. 5.1 j) while the SEM image does not reveal it very well (fig. 5.5 e) though 
it could easily be deduced that there were a number of grains (16) closely stuck to one 
another. 
In the Mimosoideae, Entada pollen grains suggest that this taxon is at the 
primitive end of the evolutionary tree compared to other members of the sub-family. 
Pseudoprosopis fischeri with pollen grains in polyads is therefore more advanced than 
Entada. Elephatorrhiza goetzei with the same pollen morphology as Entada is therefore 
at the same evolutionary level as the Entada species studied. 
It is evident that the tree and shrubby species of African Entada have smaller 
grains than the Asian and Far Eastern lianas (plate 5.2 fig. A- H). This was confirmed 
with more data obtained from material from other herbaria (plate 5.6 fig. A-F). 
To some extent the pollen results obtained so far allow the species to be 
separated into groups, but there is not enough variation to separate the specimens 
precisely to the species level. Species with large pollen grains (46.7-56.0m) include E. 
glandulosa, E. pursaetha, E. phaseoloides, E. rheedii, E. spiralis and E. zeylanica; the 
small pollen grain group included E. abyssinica, E. africana, E. bacillaris, E. 
chrysostachys, E. dolichorrhachis, E. leptostachya, E. phaneroneura, E. polyphylla, E. 
polystachya, E. spinescens, E. stuhlmannii and E. wahlbergii.

GENERAL MORPHOLOGY 
AND ANATOMY 
6.1 INTRODUCTION 
A morphological character, is one inherent in, or manifested by a structural 
component of the plant (Lawrence, 1951). The value of the morphological character is 
measured by its constancy. The more constant the character, the greater is the 
reliability that can be placed upon it. As Lawrence (1951) stressed, a character that is 
reasonably constant among the members of one group may be inconstant among 
members of another group. 
The vegetative characters of plants (i. e., those of leaves, stems, buds and habit 
of growth) are readily apparent to the eye and have an appeal to the beginner and field 
taxonomist. Their observation generally does not require the use of a microscope or a 
high powered lens nor the employment of a razor blade or dissecting needles. 
However, their use as taxonomic criteria is limited for two basic reasons: the total 
number of characters available is few as compared with the number of species of 
vascular plants and, too often, the vegetative characters are not particularly constant 
(Lawrence, 1955; Radford, 1986). 
The number of species of woody plants of any flora is usually fewer than the 
number of species of herbaceous plants of the same flora. For this reason, most genera, 
and sometimes the species, of these woody plants may be separated largely and almost 
exclusively by vegetative characters. Keys to woody plants are popular for this reason. 
However, even among the genera of woody plants, vegetative characters often lack the 
necessary variability of type, stability, and constancy necessary for the identification of 
species. As a rule, the greater the number of species in any genus of woody plants, the 
more difficult is their identification by means of vegetative characters (Lawrence, 1951). 
In preparation of keys to woody plants it is frequently desirable to use 
vegetative characters to as great an extent as practicable. Characters of leaf form, leaf 
apex, leaf base, whether the leaf is petiolate or sessile, and pith characters of the twig or 
stem are useful in separating genera. Characters of vestiture (pubescence), surface, 
coloration, and size of plant or leaves (Lawrence, 1951) are generally useful only in the 
separation of species or their variants. 
Reproductive structures are those associated with the flower and fruit. The 
number of organs in these structures, and the number of components of these organs is 
very great and ordinarily exceeds the number of species to be differentiated. In addition 
to being so abundant, reproductive characters in general are much more nearly constant 
than are vegetative characters. The reliability of any single reproductive character 
selected for taxonomic use must be determined individually, however, for each 
particular group of plants (Lawrence, 1951). 
Anatomical studies have proved rewarding in the task of defining families and 
clarifying relationships between taxa of the same family (Metcalfe & Chalk, 1950). 
However, anatomical characters often do not serve as a basis of the classifications 
themselves, but, are rather regarded as extending or supplementing the characters 
provided by external morphology (Metcalfe & Chalk, 1950). 
Anatomy of vegetative organs of plants can be taxonomically useful in the 
identification of families and genera (Davis & Heywood, 1963). Metcalfe (1943) 
suggested that the anatomy of both leaf and stem gives numerous characters which in 
combination are reliable for diagnostic purposes. He considered one of the more 
important of these characters to be the structure of the petiole. 
6.2 MATERIALS AND METHOD 
6.2.1 Collection and preservation 
The materials used in this study were collected in Zambia during a field work 
trip. Stems, leaves and flowers of 27 accessions representing 16 taxa were collected 
(table 6.1). 
They were fixed in FAA (formaldehyde: acetic acid: 70% ethanol, 7: 3: 90) and, 
after three days, they were preserved in 70% ethanol (EtOH). 
6.2.2 Embedding, Sectioning and Staining (details in appendix III) 
The specimens were embedded in paraplast and sections cut at 20pm thickness 
using a rotary microtome. The sections were dewaxed and then stained using Alcian 
blue and Safranin before examination and photography using a light microscope. 
6.3 RESULTS 
Transverse sections of the flowers are illustrated in figs. 6.1-9 while that of 
stems is presented in fig. 6.10 and of petioles in figs 6.11-12.

6.3.1 Comparative floral anatomy 
6.3.1.1 Observations 
Entada dolichorrhachis Brenan 
Fig. 6.1 a shows a transverse section of a pedicel. It shows a circular ring of 
vascular tissue which was composed of an inner band of xylem and an outer band of 
phloem. The vascular tissue surrounded a pith of parenchyma. On the outer side of the 
vascular tissue is the cortex composed of parenchymatous cells and a single layered 
epidermis on the periphery of the flower. 
Further up in the pedicel, the circular appearance became increasingly irregular 
(fig. 6.1 c, d and e) as tips of vascular tissue become discrete and traverse the cortex to 
become the vascular supply of firstly sepals (fig. 6.1 e) and petals and then stamens. 
As each floral part received a portion of vascular tissue (fig. 6.1 f and g), a 
space appeared between gynoecium and staminal and petalous tissue and at the same 
time between the calyx and the corolla (fig. 6.1 h). The C-shaped space between 
gynoecium and other floral parts increased (fig. 6.1 h) and finally formed a ring to 
separate the vascular system of the gynoecium from those of the other floral parts (fig. 
6.1 i), at the same stage a space appeared between the staminal ring and the petals (fig 
6.1 j). As the petals separate from the staminal ring, individual stamens separated from 
the main ring (fig. 6.1 k and 1). Fig. 6.1 m shows vascular tissue in the calyx, 5 petals, 
10 stamens and the gynoecium a developing embryo. 
The stamens of Entada dolichorrhachis are short as indicated by the fact that 
anther tissue is observed quite early in the progression of sections (fig. 6.1 n). They are 
divided into 2 length categories as fig. 6.1 o and p showed the appearance of 5 anthers 
and figures 1q and r showed the disappearance of the first set while fig. 6.1 s showed 
the appearance of the second set, manifested in fig 6.1 t. At the same stage as the 
second set appeared, sepal teeth also appeared (fig. 6.1 t, u, v and w). Figure 6.1 x 
shows that sepals and petals are of similar length. 
Entada chrysostachys (Benth. ) Drake 
A circular ring of vascular tissue is present in the pedicel (fig. 6.2 a and b). The 
vascular tissue was composed of an inner band of xylem and an outer band of phloem. 
The vascular tissue surrounded a pith composed of parenchyma. To the outer side of 
the phloem was a 'Parenchymatous cortex, bordered by a single layer of epidermal cells. 
Further up in the pedicel, the vascular ring gives rise to a vascular trace (fig. 6.2 
c) which traverses the cortex to become the vascular supply of the sepals. The ring 
reappeared (fig. 6.2 d) and became lobed (fig. 6.2 e) while at the same time a space 
appeared between the calyx and the rest of the floral parts (fig. 6.2 f). This space 
increased in size (fig 2g and h) to separate the calyx from the other floral parts (fig. 
6.2 i). While the sepal ring was separating from the other floral parts, vascular tissue 
was organising for the gynoecium (fig. 6.2 h). The petals and the stamens were the last 
to separate. Five lobes of vascular tissue were observed (fig. 6.2 j) and spaces appeared 
around them (fig. 6.2 k and 1) to give rise to stamens and petals. 
Immediately the stamens appeared, they started coiling or bending over (fig. 6.2 
m and n) indicating that the stamens of E. chrysostachys were longer than the petals. 
The stamens were still lying at an angle when the anthers started to appear (fig. 6.2 o, p 
and q). At this stage sepal teeth were disappearing suggesting that the sepals were 
shorter than the petals, stamens and pistil. At the time when the first set of 5 anthers 
appeared (fig. 6.2 r and s), the sepals were disappearing. When the first set of anthers 
disappeared (fig. 6.2 u), another set of 5 appeared (fig. 6.2 v and w). 
Entada bacillaris F. White var. bacillaris 
A transverse section of a pedicel showed a similar tissue pattern to that of E. 
dolichorrhachis. 
Further up in the pedicel (fig. 6.3 d) the circular shape of the vascular bundle 
changed to a more irregular outline as the strands of vascular tissue become discrete and 
traverse the cortex to become the vascular supply of firstly sepals (fig. 6.3 e) and petals 
and then the stamens and the gynoecium (fig. 6.3 g). 
As each of the floral parts received the vascular supply (fig. 6.3 g), a space 
appeared between the gynoecium and the other floral parts (fig. 6.3 h). When the 
gynoecium completely separated from the other floral parts, another space appeared 
between staminal and petalous tissue with that of the calyx (fig. 6.3 i) which increased 
(fig. 6.3 j and k) to give rise to a sepal ring and a petal/stamen ring while at the same 
time stamens started separating from the petals (fig. 6.3 1). Fig. 6.3 m and n show 
vascular tissue in the perianth, 3 traces on the lower side of each of the 5 petals with 
the largest in the middle, 10 stamens and the gynoecium with developing embryo. 
Five stamens give rise to 5 anthers (fig. 6.3 p and q) which disappear from 
higher sections (fig. 6.3 r) and the other remaining set of 5 stamens gave rise to another 
set of 5 anthers (fig. 6.3 s and t). At this stage sepal teeth began appearing (fig. 6.3 t). 
They are completely seperated (fig. 6.3 v) just at the end of a flower. Thus fig. 6.3 v 
and w show that the sepals and petals of E. bacillaris are of approximately same length. 
There was no evidence of stamen coiling indicating that stamens were not longer 
than petals. 
Entada gigas (L. ) Fawc. & Rendle 
A transverse section of a pedicel has a circular ring (fig. 6.4 a) of vascular tissue 
which is composed of an inner band of xylem and an outer band of phloem. Tissue 
arrangement in the pedicel was similar to that in all other species observed. 
A circular ring of vascular tissue became irregular further up in the pedicel (fig. 
6.4 b) and the tips of the vascular tissue become discrete and traverse the cortex to give 
rise to the vascular supply of sepals (fig. 6.4 c) and then petals, stamens and 
gynoecium. 
The sepal ring is the first part to separate from the other floral parts as the C- 
shaped space which appeared at the receptacle (fig. 6.4 c) increased and formed a 
complete ring (fig. 6.4 d) isolating it completely. At the same stage, stamens started 
forming as the petals also separated. A space also appeared which separated the 
staminal ring from the gynoecium (fig. 6.4 e). As stamens separated from the 
gynoecium, they coiled (fig. 6.4 g, h, i, j, k and 1) and sepal teeth appeared and were 
visible in fig 6.4 f but had disappeared by fig. 6.4 p. A unique feature is that stamens 
congregate in the centre (fig. 6.4 1) as anther tissue is appearing and the coiling of 
stamens make them appear as though there are two sets of 10 stamens (fig. 6.4 q). A 
first set of five anthers disappeared (fig. 6.4 s) as another set reappeared (fig. 6.4 u). 
Sepals of Entada gigas are shorter than petals and the coiling of stamens is an 
indication that the stamens are longer than the petals. It is also evident that the anthers 
are arranged in two sets (see fig. 6.4 s and 4 u). 
Entada abyssinica Steud. ex A. Rich. 
The transverse section of a pedicel of E. abyssinica (fig. 6.5 a) shows a similar 
tissue pattern as E. dolichorrhachis and other species observed earlier. 
Further up in the pedicel, the circular ring of vascular tissue becomes irregular 
(fig. 6.6 c) and the tips (fig. 6.5 d) of the vascular tissue become discrete and traverse 
the cortex to give rise to the vascular supply of the sepals. 
A space appeared between the sepal ring and the other floral parts in a C-shape 
(fig. 6.5 e). The C-shape increased (fig 6.5 f), at the same stage another C-shaped 
space appears between the staminal/petalous ring and the gynoecium. Both C-shaped 
spaces increase to separate the sepals, staminal/petalous ring and gynoecium (fig. 6.5 g). 
Fig. 6.5 h shows vascular tissue in the sepal ring, five petals, 10 stamens and 
gynoecium. 
As soon as the first set of five stamens separated from petals (fig. 6.5 j), they 
appeared in a staminal ring (fig. 6.5 k) and separation completed (fig. 6.5 m) and sepal 
teeth appeared (fig. 6.5 n) which later disappeared (fig. 6.5 p). A set of five anthers 
appeared (fig. 6.5 q and r) and disappeared (fig. 6.5 s) as another set of five (fig. 6.5 t- 
The sepals of E. abyssinica are shorter than the petals as is evidenced in fig. 6.5 
p-x which had no sepals. The coiling is also evidence that stamens are longer than 
petals. The anthers are also arranged in two sets of five. 
Entada arenaria Schinz subsp arenaria . 
In a transverse section of a pedicel, a circular ring of vascular tissue was 
observed (fig. 6.7 a). The arrangement of tissue was the same as in other species 
discussed earlier. 
Further up in the pedicel, the vascular ring became irregular (fig. 6.7 c) and the 
lobes become discrete and traverse the cortex to give vascular supply for the sepals. 
Two spaces appeared, one between the calyx and the staminal/petalous tissue 
and the other between staminal/petalous tissue and the gynoecium (fig. 6.7 d). The 
spaces increased and the gynoecium separated first (fig. 6.7 e) and later the sepal ring 
from the androecium/petalous tissue. Fig. 6.7 f showed vascular tissue in the sepal ring, 
5 petals, 10 stamens and gynoecium with an embryo developing (fig. 6.7 g). 
As in other species, anthers are present in 2 sets of five (fig. 6.7 i and j). The 
sepals are not as short as in other species and stamens seem to be same length as the 
petals. 
Elephantorrhiza goetzei (Harms) Harms 
As in Entada species, a vascular ring was observed in a transverse section of a 
pedicel of Elephantorrhiza (fig. 6.8 a). It was composed of an outer band of phloem 
tissue and an inner band of xylem tissue which surrounded a pith of parenchymatous 
cells. On the outer side of the phloem was the cortex with some lignified cells. A 
single layered epidermis was present (fig. 6.8 a and b). 
Further up in the pedicel, the vascular ring appeared fragmented as it gave rise 
to traces of vascular tissue to the sepal ring (fig. 6.8 c and d). It reformed as an 
irregular ring (fig. 6.8 e) and fragmented again to supply petals, stamens and gynoecium 
with vascular tissue (fig. 6.8 i). A C-shaped space appeared between the gynoecium 
and the other floral parts. When the gynoecium completed separating, another space 
appeared which separated the sepal ring from stamens and petals (fig. 6.8 i). Stamens 
separated from the petals. - Fig. 6.8 1 shows vascular tissue in sepals, 5 petals, 10 
stamens and the gynoecium. 
The stamens of Elephantorrhiza seem to be relatively short as anther tissue 
appeared close to the receptacle (fig. 6.8 m) and there was no coiling. The stamens in 
this species seem to be divided into two sets as had been observed in Entada. Fig. 6.8 
p shows the disappearance of the first set while fig. 6.8 q and r show the appearance of 
the second set. Sepal teeth were no longer present after the first pair of anthers (fig. 6.8 
p). Though sepals are shorter than petals (fig. 6.8 q), the difference was slight. 
Pseudoprosopis fischen (Taub. ) Harms 
Fig 6.9 a is a transverse section of a pedicel. It shows a circular ring of 
vascular tissue which was seen to be composed of an outer band of phloem tissue and 
an inner band of xylem tissue. The vascular tissue surrounded a pith of parenchymatous 
cells (fig. 6.9 b). On the outer side of the phloem was the cortex composed of 
parenchyma cells bordered by a single layered epidermis. 
Further up in the pedicel, the vascular ring became irregular with five lobes 
which supplied to the midribs of the sepals. 
When the sepals got their supply of vascular tissue, a C-shaped space appeared 
(fig 9 f) which increased (fig. 6.9 g-i) to separate the sepals from the other floral parts. 
Difficulties in sectioning made it difficult to compare the lengths of stamens to 
that of petals but fig. 6.9 k showed that the anthers are also displayed in sets of five. 
6.3.1.2 Discussion 
In a transverse section of the pedicel of all Entada species studied and those of 
the close relatives studied, Pseudoprosopis fischeri and Elephantorrhiza goetzei, a 
circular ring of vascular tissue was found. The vascular tissue was composed of an 
inner band of xylem and an outer band of phloem. The vascular tissue surrounded a 
pith composed of parenchyma. To the outer side of the phloem was a parenchymatous 
cortex bordered by a single layered epidermis. 
Further up in the pedicel, the circular appearance became irregular as tips of 
vascular tissue became discrete and traversed the cortex to become the vascular supply 
of firstly sepals and petals and then stamens and gynoecium. 
As each floral part got a portion of vascular tissue, a space appeared between the 
gynoecium and other floral parts. This was observed in flowers of E. bacillaris var. 
bacillaris and Elephantorrhiza. In other species such as Entada abyssinica, E. gigas, E. 
chrysostachys and Pseudoprosopis fischeri, the sepal ring is the first to separate from 
the other floral parts while separation of the sepal ring and gynoecium from the 
staminal/petalous ring is at the same stage in the suffrutices: Entada dolichorrhachis 
and E. arenaria subsp. arenaria. 
Anthers are displayed inside the petals in two sets of five in all Entadas and 
those species of their close relatives studied. 
The coiling of stamens in Entada abyssinica, E. chrysostachys and E. gigas is an 
indication that the stamens in these species are longer than the petals. On the other 
hand, there was no coiling of stamens in flowers of E. dolichorrhachis, E. bacillaris 
var. bacillaris, E. arenaria subsp. arenaria and Elephantorrhiza. 
Sepal length is variable but they were evidently shorter sepals than petals in 
Entada abyssinica, E. chrysostachys and E. gigas. They were classified as the same 
length as petals in E. dolichorrhachis, E. bacillaris var. bacillaris, E. arenaria subsp. 
arenaria and Elephantorrhiza. 
A correlation is therefore observed in the length of sepals and stamens. Species 
with short sepals had long stamens while those with the same length as petals had 
relatively short stamens. 
There is no correlation of these features with the sections discussed by Brenan 
(1966). Species from different sections portrayed same features while those from the 
same sections could have different features. It was noticed that Elephantorrhiza, despite 
belonging to a different genus, shares many features with Entada dolichorrhachis, E. 
bacillaris var. bacillaris and E. arenaria subsp. arenaria. Therefore anatomical features 
do not seem to be good characters for taxonomical purposes at this low level. 
6.3.2 Stems 
6.3.2.1 Observations 
In the stem of Entada, there was a single layer of epidermal cells. On the inner 
side of the epidermis, there was a cortex composed of collenchyma cells separated from 
the pith by a ring of vascular tissue. The pith was composed of primarily of 
parenchyma cells. 
The vascular ring is collateral with the phloem on the outer side and the xylem 
on the inner side. In all stems of Entada species a vascular cambium is evident (fig. 
6.10). It is also present in the stem of Pseudoprosopis fischeri (fig. 6.10 c). 
6.3.2.2 Discussion 
Apart from Entada arenaria subsp. arenaria, all stems observed were 5 lobed. 
The arrangement of tissue is similar in all the specimens studied: a single layer of 
epidermal cells, collenchymatous cortex, vascular cambium with phloem on the outer 
side and xylem on the inner side, and a pith composed of ground parenchyma cells. 
The stem of Pseudoprosopis fischeri is 6 lobed. 
Other than E. chrysostachys and E. camerunensis, all the species studied (fig. 
6.10) had trichomes. 
6.3.3 Petioles 
6.3.3.1 Observation 
The tissue arrangement in the petioles was similar to that of the stems (see fig. 
6.11), but in addition there are rib traces of vascular tissue which give a vascular supply 
to the petiolules. 
6.3.3.2 Discussion 
The petiole vascular tissue type exhibited by Entada species is classified as 0- 
shaped according to Hare's (1953) classification. The presence of traces makes it not fit 
very well in Howard's (1979) classification though it is closest to the open vascular 
system with lateral traces which he observed in Actinidia. Entada abyssinica, E. 
chrysostachys, E. bacillaris, E. arenaria and E. gigas all show O-shaped vascular tissue 
with rib traces. Pseudoprosopis fischeri has a U-shaped vascular system with rib traces. 
Entada dolichorrhachis and E. camerunensis do not have rib traces. 
The vascular system observed in the petiolules (fig. 6.11 k) is the same as that 
seen in the corresponding petiole. 
The leaf node of E. bacillaris is trilacunar (fig. 6.11 g) and this was also 
observed in other species. 
Three traces leading into a petiole are observed at a leaf attachment point of 
Entada chrysostachys (fig. 6.12 a) proving that it has a trilacunar node, they fuse 
together at a higher level of sectioning (fig. 6.12 b) and are eventually arranged in an 
O-shape (fig 6.12 c and d). Rib traces appear on the ventral side.

PHYTOCHEMISTRY 
7.1 INTRODUCTION 
7.1.1 FLAVONOIDS 
Flavonoids constitute one of the largest groups of naturally occurring phenolics 
(Harborne, 1973; Smith, 1976). They are sometimes coloured, such as the commonly 
occurring anthocyanins whose colours range from pink and scarlet to mauve and blue 
and occur mainly in flowers. Chalcones and aurones are yellow, most flavones and 
flavonols are faint yellow, while others are colourless, such as flavanones and 
leucoanthocyanidins (Harborne, 1966). 
The principal phenolic constituents are not present in a free state in nature but 
in the form of esters or more generally, as glycosides (Riberean-Gayon, 1972). The 
most common monosaccharides detected in flavonoid glycosides are glucose, xylose, 
arabinose, and glucuronic acid. Rutinose (6-a-rhamnosylglucose), neohesperidose (2-a- 
rhamnosylglucose), sophorose (2--glucosylglucose) and robinobiose (2-a- 
rhamnosylgalactose), have been reported to be common among the oligosaccharides 
(Harborne, 1973). 
In plants, flavonoids occur in a variety of forms (Markham, 1982). Of all the 
various classes of the naturally occurring compounds based on the flavonoid skeleton 
(fig. 7.1), the flavones and flavonols are the most abundant groups. All contain 15 
carbon atoms in their basic nucleus and these are arranged in a C6-C3-C6 configuration 
(Harborne, 1973; Markham, 1982; Smith, 1976). For convenience the rings are labelled 
A, B and C and the individual carbon atoms are referred to by a numbering system 
which uses plain numerals for the A- and C- rings and "primed" numerals for the B- 
ring (Markham, 1982). 
The distinction between flavones and flavonols is an arbitrary one, since 
flavonols are simply a class of flavones in which the 3- position is substituted by a

hydroxy group (fig. 7.2) (Harborne, 1967). This affects their UV absorption, 
chromatographic mobility and colour reaction so that flavones can be distinguished from 
flavonols on these bases. With regard to the hydroxylation pattern of flavonols, the 
distribution of quercetin and kaempferol is very common, while myricetin is less 
common in occurrence. Luteolin and apigenin are the common flavones, while tricetin 
is relatively rare (Ranabahu, 1992). 
7.1.2 CHROMATOGRAPHIC AND SPECTRAL PROPERTIES OF FLAVONOIDS 
Most flavonoids are not visible on paper chromatograms, except anthocyanins 
(orange to purple colours turning to blue with ammonia) and chalcones, aurones and 6- 
hydroxyflavonols which are yellow. But they are all visible when viewed under long 
wave UV light (366nm). Mostly, the flavones and the flavonol glycosides appear as 
dark purple spots on chromatograms in UV light and turn yellow or yellowish green 
with ammonia. 
The UV-visible flavonoid spectrum usually consists of two absorption maxima 
in the range 240-285 nm (band 1) and 300-550nm (band 2). Typical spectra of major 
flavonoid types are described in fig. 7.3. 
7.1.3 DISTRIBUTION AND THE CHEMOSYSTEMATICS OF FLAVONOIDS 
Flavonoids normally occur in plants as glycosides and each aglycone may 
occur in association with a number of different sugars. The wide range of structural 
types has meant that flavonoids have lent themselves particularly well to 
chemotaxonomic studies in higher plants (Harborne, 1971). Other advantages of 
flavonoids lie in their relative stability, their ease of detection and identification, and 
above all, their universal occurrence in all higher plant groups, both gymnosperms and 
angiosperms.

equivalent hydroxylation patterns (adapted from Markham, 1982). 
250 300 350 400 450 500 \ nm 
The common flavonols and flavones are of special systematic interest because 
they occur in combined form as glycosides and the nature of sugars present and the 
positions of their attachment to the nucleus is often specific to a particular group. 
The Leguminosae, compared to most other plant families, are particularly rich 
in flavonoid content. A special feature of legumes is their ability to accumulate series 
of structurally and biosynthetically inter-related substances at different levels of 
oxidation or other substitution. From a chemotaxonomic point of view, such richness 
and complexity in structure provides many characters for systematic purposes 
(Harborne, 1971). 
The common flavonols, myricetin, quercetin and kaempferol and the two 
common flavones, luteolin and apigenin, are widely distributed in leaves and flowers of 
the family Leguminosae (Bate-Smith, 1962). These are phylogenetic markers in that 
flavonols (especially myricetin) are characteristic of leaves of woody plants, being 
replaced by flavones in leaves of herbaceous species. The presence of myricetin is 
considered as a primitive character which slowly disappears during the evolutionary 
advancement of the angiosperms (Harborne, 1971). 
The purpose of chemosystematics is therefore to provide evidence on the 
phylogeny of taxonomic groups and in combination with the characters obtained from 
the other disciplines to improve existing classification (Hegnauer, 1986).

7.2.2 Extraction 
One gram of fresh leaves, bark and root from the greenhouse were put in 
separate test tubes. Methanol (80% MeOH) was added to just cover the samples and 
the solvents were boiled in a water bath for 5 minutes to stop enzymatic reactions. The 
same process was repeated for herbarium materials. They were then left at room 
temperature to extract for 24 hours. The extract was put on a watch glass to evaporate 
in a fume cupboard. 
7.2.3 2-Dimensional Paper Chromatography (2-D PC) 
The whole extract obtained above was dissolved in 70% EtOH and spotted on 
a 23 cm square piece of Whatman No. 1 paper. Rutin was used as a marker. The 
chromatograms were run in n-Butanol/Acetic acid/Water, 4: 1: 5 upper layer (BAW) for 5 
hours (first direction). They were removed, dried and rutin spotted again, this time on 
the sample source, turned 90 and run in 15% Acetic acid (HOAc) for 2 hours (second 
direction). They were dried and observed under long wave UV light (366 nm) 
(Harborne, 1984). The distances travelled by the solvent front and the spots were 
measured and the Rf values calculated. 
7.2.4 Separation of individual compounds 
A larger quantity of fresh leaves were put in conical flasks and extracted as in 
7.2.2. The extract was put in a round bottomed flask and concentrated by use of a 
rotary evaporator. Chlorophyll was precipitated off by adding dichloromethane and 
centrifuging. Each sample was redissolved in 70% MeOH and spotted on six Whatman 
No. 3 papers and run in BAW and HOAc as in 7.2.3. 
7.2.5 Hydrolysis 
An equal volume of 2M HCl was added to the eluent obtained above and 
heated for 40 minutes in a water bath. The eluent was cooled and extracted with an 
equal volume of ethyl acetate and the extracted layer put in 5 ml beakers. The ethyl 
acetate was then evaporated in a fume cupboard 
7.2.6 Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), identification of aglycones 
The samples obtained in 7.2.5 were redissolved in 95% EtOH and spotted on 
cellulose plates without a fluorescent indicator. Myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, 
luteolin and apigenin were used as markers. The chromatograms were run in Forestal 
(acetic acid: water: HC1= 30: 10: 3), 50% HOAc, CAW 2: 1 (chloroform: acetic acid 
saturated with water (2: 1: 0.13) and BAW. After drying, they were observed under UV 
light. Where the colours were too weak, the plates were sprayed with Naturstoffreagenz 
7.2.7 Identification of sugars 
The aqueous layer left after decanting in 7.2.5 was evaporated to dryness in a 
round bottomed flask by use of a rotary evaporator. Then it was redissolved in 2 drops 
of water and spotted on Whatman No. 1 papers 23 x 46 cm. A sugar mixture 
consisting of glucose, galactose, xylose, arabinose and rhamnose was used as a marker. 
The chromatograms were run in TBPW (toluene : n-butanol : pyridine : water, 1: 5: 3: 3) 
for 30 hours and Phenol (phenol: water = 4: 1) for 48 hours. After drying, they were 
dipped in Aniline hydrogen phthalate and heated in an oven at 105C for 10 minutes. 
7.2.8 Rotenone test (TLC) 
The extract obtained in 7.2.2 was redissolved in 80% MeOH and spotted 
against rotenone as a marker on four cellulose plates with fluorescent indicator. The 
plates were each run in the following solvents: 
HEM (Hexane-Ethyl acetate-Methane 60: 40: 2) 
CM (Chloroform-Methanol 98: 2) 
TA (Toluene-Acetic acid 5: 1) 
TE (Toluene-Ethyl acetate 9: 1) 
They were removed from the tanks, dried and observed under UV light. 
7.2.9 High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) 
The compounds (both glycosides and aglycones) which were not identified by 
TLC were tested against authentic markers on a Waters HPLC (600) multidelivery 
system with a Waters Bondapak (C18) Phenyl (reverse phase) column, 3.9cm ID x 
30cm long. The solvent system used was A, 5% aqueous acetic acid; and B, 
methanol/acetic acid/water 18: 1: 1 (in the ratio 40% A to 60% B) isocratic system. The 
eluent was detected with a Waters 994 Photodiode Array set at a wavelength of 260nm. 
The samples were redissolved in 80% MeOH and filtered and then injected in the 
HPLC. 
7.2.10 Flavonone colour test 
One drop of sample SL 034L was put in a sample bottle and 70% EtOH added 
to dilute it. Magnesium powder was added followed by 3 drops of 5M HC1. The 
colour changed to pink. The experiment was repeated using Zinc powder in place of 
Mg powder to see whether it was a flavonone rather than a flavononol which also reacts 
with Zn. 
7.2.11 Flavanone glycoside identification by TLC 
The glycoside was spotted on cellulose plates without fluorescent indicator and 
co-chromatographed with Naringin. 
7.3 RESULTS 
Two-dimensional paper chromatograms of fresh material extracts are presented 
in fig. 7.6.4-7. The Rf values for flavonoids in fresh material extracts, and their colours 
in UV light before and after fuming with ammonia are presented in table 7.3-5 for 
glycosides and table 7.6 for aglycones. Myricetin and Myricitrin test results for SL 
003L fresh material aglycones are presented in tables 7.7 and 7.8 respectively. 
The rotenone test proved negative for all the samples tested. However, it is 
possible that the plates used did not show rotenone, as a repeat of the experiment 
showed that even the rotenone standard was not visible, which suggested that the TCL 
plate was faulty. 
The Rf values for herbarium material glycoside spots on 2-D chromatograms 
are presented in table 7.9 while aglycone Rfs of the same materials on TLC are 
presented in table 7.10. Identification results for aglycones are presented in plates 7.1- 
3. Eriodictyol and Naringenin tests are shown in tables 7.11 and 7.12 respectively. 
The HPLC results for hydrolysed SL 025L are presented in fig. 7.9. The 
absorption spectrum for Apigenin from Entada nudiflora (SL 025) extract, and those of 
its derivatives are presented in fig. 7.10 A-C. Apigenin was confirmed by an authentic 
marker spectrum in fig. 7.10 D. 
Absorption spectra of Quercetin and Kaempferol are presented in fig. 7.11 A 
&B respectively. A flavanone spectrum from Entada bacillaris var. plurijuga (SL 034) 
is presented in fig. 7.11 C and its identity is confirmed by an authentic Naringenin (see 
fig. 7.11 D). 
In table 7.13 a summary is given of all flavonoid glycoside spots found in the 
extracts of leaves, bark and root of the investigated species of Entada, Elephantorrhiza 
and Pseudoprosopis. The aglycones which were found are also shown.

7.4 OBSERVATIONS 
Besides the banding patterns at the solvent front of HOAc, the extracts of 
Entada camerunensis (SL 022) showed the presence of flavonoids. The leaf extract 
revealed two compounds separated by 2-D paper chromatography both of which had a 
low Rf in BAW but a high Rf in 15% HOAc. The aglycone results in table 7.6 
identified them as quercetin and unknown 1. Fig. 7.8 shows that both compounds have 
the sugar, glucose, attached to them. 
Both specimens SL 014 and 017 of Entada bacillaris var. bacillaris had one 
flavonoid compound of Rf = 60 in BAW but Rfs = 36 and 37 respectively, in 15% 
HOAc (see table 7.9). This confirmed that the two specimens belonged to the same 
species. The compound was later identified as quercetin (table 7.9), and the original 
compound must have been a quercetin glycoside. 
Compounds separated from Entada bacillaris var. plurijuga (SL 034) could not 
be related to rutin and were clearly very different from specimens SL 014 and SL 017 
which were morphologically the closest to it. Although two major compounds were 
observed on 2-D chromatograms (table 7.9), more compounds were observed after 
hydrolysis. Quercetin and kaempferol were the major compounds though there was 
another compound which showed strongly (table 7.10) an olive colour under UV light 
after spraying with Naturstoffreagenz A. 
After several runs of the unknown aglycone on the HPLC with authentic 
markers, it was later keyed out to be naringenin (see fig. 7.11 C& D). Both the 
glycoside and the aglycone sample also gave a peak for apigenin and its derivatives (fig. 
7.11 A& B) which were confirmed by the apigenin spectrum in fig. 7.11 D and TLC 
data in table 7.10. 
Entada bacillaris specimen SL 013 is closer to Entada bacillaris var. bacillaris 
but it is chemically different as it has two flavonoid compounds showing strongly after 
2-D chromatography (table 7.9). Both of these compounds appear dark purple under 
UV light and change colour to yellow when fumed with ammonia. They move almost 
the same distance in BAW (Rf = 50 and 60 respectively) but spot C is slower than spot 
A in 15% HOAc (Rf = 50 and 30 respectively). The main compound in SL 013 is 
quercetin derived (table 7.10). Another compound was also found after hydrolysis but 
was not identified. 
Three compounds were observed in the extract of Entada nudiflora (SL 025) 
which were evenly distributed in BAW but all have a low Rf in 15% HOAc. All the 
three spots appear dark purple under UV light but change to yellow with varying 
intensities when fumed with ammonia. The lowest running compound in BAW (Rf = 
39) changes from dark purple to deep yellow while the intermediate one (Rf = 60) 
changes to weak yellow and the highest running in BAW (Rf = 81) changes to yellow 
when fumed with ammonia. In 15% HOAc the Rf values are 14,21 and 31 
respectively. 
The acid hydrolysis of glycosides gave rise to five spots which were identified 
as quercetin, luteolin and apigenin (see table 7.9 and figures 7.10 A-C) while the other 
two spots could possibly be the unhydrolysed glycosides. The apigenin and its 
derivatives in SL 025 were confirmed by means of HPLC by comparing them with an 
authentic marker. The peak gave the same retention time and UV-spectrum (see fig. 
7.11 D). 
Entada dolichorrhachis specimen SL 026 extract has two main flavonoid 
compounds. They both had a high Rf in BAW and HOAc. Spot L (Rf = 61 and 66 in 
BAW and HOAc respectively) appeared dark purple under UV light and changed to 
yellow when fumed with ammonia. The other spot was high in both BAW and HOAc 
(Rf = 76 and 72 respectively) and also appeared dark purple and changed to yellow 
when fumed with ammonia but with weaker intensity. 
After hydrolysis the two compounds in E. dolichorrhachis extract were 
identified on TLC and after spraying with naturstoffreagenz A as quercetin- and 
kaempferol-based (see table 7.10). 
The extract of Entada arenaria var. arenaria (SL 030) showed one compound 
after separation in 2-D chromatography. The compound moved half way both in BAW 
and 15% HOAc. On TLC, the compound was identified as quercetin-based after 
hydrolysis. The TLC run in BAW showed another compound after being sprayed with 
naturstoffreagenz A which was identified as kaempferol. 
The extract of Entada gigas (SL 028) did not separate very well in BAW but 
did in 15% HOAc. The Rf values for the three (3) compounds in BAW were 63,54 
and 52 for spots B, A and K respectively. Spots B and A were invisible under UV light 
but changed to yellow when fumed with ammonia. Spot K appeared dark purple under 
UV light but changed to weak yellow when fumed with ammonia. 
No aglycones were found on a TLC plate after hydrolysis apart from one spot 
on a plate run in BAW, this was likely to be apigenin (Rf = 91 see table 7.9). 
Two flavonoid compounds were observed from the extract of Entada 
chrysostachys (SL 031) on the 2-D chromatogram. Spot A (Rf = 51 in BAW and 50 in 
HOAc) appeared dark purple under UV light and changed to yellow when fumed with 
ammonia. After hydrolysis two compounds were identified: quercetin and kaempferol. 
7.5 DISCUSSION 
At the time this work was carried out, it was difficult to be certain about 
identification of specimens SL 004,005,008 and SL 012 but the results in tables 7.3-5 
show that they have identical patterns and hence are probably specimens of the same 
species. 
All the root extracts of Entada exhibited a characteristic pattern of LY, LB and 
I-B spots around the origin in 15% acetic acid and half way between solvent front and 
origin in BAW (see fig. 7.7). Because the material available was inadequate, they were 
not identified. The Rf values are however presented in table 7.5. The changes 
observed were mainly invisible to blue or deep blue and faint yellow to yellow when 
fumed with ammonia. Pseudoprosopis fischen had a dark purple spot which did not 
change colour after fuming with ammonia. This different flavonoid pattern indicates 
that flavonoids support the generic distinction. The pattern observed in root extracts 
seem to suggest that Entada roots have a very homogeneous pattern for the compounds 
regardless of species. 
The flavonoid pattern from the leaf extract observed in climbing Entada 
species was unique to this group. This suggests that the flavonoid pattern can be used 
to split species at this level to probably subgenus or section. However, differences are 
evident at the species level, e. g. SL 010 and SL 022, both of which are climbers, but 
show different flavonoid patterns. 
Specimens SL 010 and SL 031 were thought to be the same species on 
morphological grounds but their chemical constituents were different and hence there is 
the need to investigate them further. 
E. nudiflora showed a totally different flavonoid profile from all the other 
Entada species, because it contains a flavone (see table 10) rather than flavonol 
glycosides. 
According to Harbome (1971), flavonoids are phylogenetic markers in that 
flavonols are more common in leaves of woody plants, being replaced by flavones in 
leaves of herbaceous species. Therefore, E. nudiflora seems to be an advanced species, 
chemically, when compared with other species in the genus. 
Elephantorrhiza goetzeii (SL 009) belongs to the same tribe (Adenantheraeae) 
as Entada and it was also observed to have one spot of a flavonoid compound. The 
compound appeared dark purple and changed to yellow when fumed with ammonia. It 
moved the same distance as rutin in both BAW and HOAc (see table 8). On TLC the 
aglycone of this specimen's extract was identified as quercetin. 
The pattern of flavonoids in P. ftscheri was specific for this species as 
compared to flavonoids found in species of Entada studied. This supports the 
morphological characters which delimit the genus and separate it from Entada. 
Of all the specimens studied, quercetin seems to be the most commonly 
occuring flavonoid compound in Entada and its relatives. Kampferol is also common 
but occurs in lower concentration than quercetin. Luteolin is rare and was only found 
in E. bacillaris. Contrary to the three flavonols mentioned above, the only flavonone 
found in the genus was naringenin found only in the advaced member of the genus E. 
nudiflora. The concentration of flavonoid compounds was found to be higher in the 
leaves than in the bark and/or roots.

NUMERICAL TAXONOMY 
8.1 INTRODUCTION 
Numerical taxonomy is the grouping by numerical methods of taxonomic units 
into taxa on the basis of their character states. This includes the drawing of 
phylogenetic inferences from the data by statistical or other mathematical methods to 
the extent to which this is possible (Sneath & Sokal, 1973). These methods require the 
conversion of information about taxonomic entities into numeric quantities. 
The fundamental position of numerical taxonomy may be summarised in the 
following principles according to Sneath & Sokal (1973): 
1. The greater the content of information in the taxa of a classification 
and the more characters on which it is based, the better a given 
classification will be. 
2. A priori, every character is of equal weight in creating natural taxa. 
3. Overall similarities between any two entities is a function of their 
individual similarities in each of the many characters in which they 
are compared. 
4. Distinct taxa can be recognised because correlations of characters 
differ in the groups of organisms under study. 
5. Phylogenetic inferences can be made from the taxonomic structure of 
a group and from character correlations, given certain assumptions 
about evolutionary pathway and mechanism. 
6. Taxonomy is viewed and practised as an empirical science. 
7. Classifications are based on phenetic similarity. 
Estimation of resemblance is the most important and fundamental step in 
numerical taxonomy. It commences with the collection of information about characters 
in the taxonomic group to be studied. The units in the taxonomic group are referred to 
as Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU's). For each of the OTUs, taxonomic characters 
are assigned based on comparison. 
Classification in numerical taxonomy is generally based on a matrix of 
resemblances, in which taxa are constructed (Sneath & Sokal, 1973). The computation 
method for clustering will process the data efficiently and provide some numerical 
evaluation of the taxonomic relationships. Resemblance is expressed by coefficients of 
similarity usually ranging between unity and zero, the former for perfect agreement, the 
latter for none whatever, or by coefficients of dissimilarity (distance) usually ranging 
between zero and an undefined positive value, the former for identity, the latter for 
maximal distance or disparity. 
8.2 MATERIALS AND METHOD 
The data used in this analysis were generated from the data sheets used to 
make the species descriptions in Chapter 8. The characters used in generating the 
matrix, with their corresponding variable number, are listed in table 8.1. Fig. 8.1 shows 
diagramatic illustration and description of terms used in table 8.1. The character matrix 
for the OTUs used in the preliminary analysis is presented in table 8.2 while that for the 
main analysis is presented in table 8.4. Table 8.3 shows the coding of OTU's in table 
In a preliminary analysis, unidentified specimens collected in Zambia were run 
together with authenticated specimens from Kew herbarium. Table 8.1 shows characters 
used in the analysis of which the first 23 of them (designated a-v in table 8.2) were 
used in the preliminary analysis while the main analysis made use of all the 34 
characters (designated a-z, 1-8). These characters are of three types, viz. binary, 
multistate qualitative and quantitative values. Binary state characters were represented 
as presence or absence of a character or as two states of a character. Multistate 
characters were represented as integers from 1 up to the maximum number of the states

recognised in each character. In binary and multistate qualitative characters, the 
difference between any two states was treated as equal. Out of 34 characters scored, 22 
were binary, 5 were multistate qualitative and 7 were quantitative values. Diagramatic 
illustration of characters used in the analysis is presented in fig. 8.1. 
The program used was "CLUST" of Reading Taxonomy Programs designed and 
written for taxonomic purposes by R. M. Wadsworth of the Botany Department, 
University of Reading. A dissimilarity matrix was calculated using the agglomerating 
strategy and used in Nearest Neighbour, Furthest Neighbour and Group Average 
clustering techniques from which dendrograms were drawn. 
The preliminary analysis was done to group specimens to species, while the main 
analysis was done to examine overall variation among the species. 
Character choice and coding 
Plant habit (extracted from notes on herbarium sheets), which is character 1, 
(designated as "a" in data matrices) was expressed as tree, shrub, liana, scandent shrub 
and suffrutex coded 1,2,3,4 and 5 respectively. 
Pubescence characters (2(b), 5(e), 15(o), 19(s), 20(t), 24(x) and 28(2)) were each 
coded as 0 for glabrous and 1 for any level of pubescence visible using dissecting 
microscope. 
Characters involving measurements, character 3 (rachis length), 4 (pinnarrhachis 
length), 6 (length to first pinna), 7 (length to first pinnule), 12 (leaflet length), 13 
(leaflet width) and 14 (petiole length) were recorded absolute values in millimeters. 
Leaf and leaflet arrangement appeared as opposite or alternate. Character 8 and 9 
were coded as 0 and opposite and 1 for alternate. 
Leaflet shape for character 16 was either ovate, obovate, oblong or elliptic and 
was were coded 1,2,3 and 4 respectively. The leaflet-base shape (character 17) also 
varied between species. The shapes were: truncate, obtuse, cuneate, oblique and acute 
coded as 1,2,3,4, and 5 respectively. Character 18 (leaflet-apex shape) was coded 1, 
2,3,4,5 and 6 for obtuse, retuse, acute, mucronate, emarginate and acuminate 
respectively. 
Stipules (character 21) and tendrils (character 22) were recorded either as absent 
or present and were coded 0 and 1 respectively. Tendrils were only observed in 
climbing species mainly from Asia. 
Inflorescence position in Entada is either axillary or terminal. Character 23 was 
therefore coded 0 and 1 for axillary and terminal respectively. 
Purple/red flower colour is only observed in species of the section 
Porphyrostachys. To separate species of this section from the rest, I decided to classify 
flower colour broadly into cream/green and purple/red. Character 25 was coded 0 and 1 
for cream/green and purple/red colour respectively. 
Flowers were either sessile or pedicellate. In literature on Entada, pedicel length 
of 0.5mm or less is considered sessile while that greater than 0.5mm is pedicellate. 
Character 26 was hence coded 0 and 1 for sessile and pedicellate flowers respectively. 
Calyx tooth length was used to separate species with inconspicuous calyx lobes 
from those which were (>0.2mm) lobed. Character 27 is coded 0 for inconspicuous 
lobes and 1 for lobed calyx respectively. 
Petal length ranged from 2.5-4mm. The groupings were observed for species with 
0.3mm or less and another for lengths longer than 0.3mm. I considered lengths of 3mm 
or less as short and those >3.0mm as long. Hence character 29 is coded 0 and 1 for 
their respective lengths. Similarly stamen length was also short for <5mm and long for 
>5mm and therefore character 30 is coded 0 and 1 for their respective lengths. 
The pod (character 31) was either straight or falcate. The coding is 0 for straight 
and 1 for falcate respectively. The other character of the pod was flatness or twisting 
and character 32 is coded 0 for flat and 1 for twisted. 
Seed coat was either areolate or exareolate and the coding for character 33 is 0 
for areolate and 1 for exareolate. 
Pod size was variable among the species, but two groupings were observed: small 
and large. Small pods did not exceed 40cm in length while large ones varied from 40- 
200cm. I therefore split small pods from large pods based on the length. Character 34 
was therefore coded 0 for small and 1 for large pods. 
8.3 RESULTS 
The phenograms for the preliminary analysis are presented in fig. 8.2-4 while 
those for the main analysis are presented in fig. 8.5-7. 
8.3.1 Preliminary analysis 
The Group Average phenogram shows that SL 028 grouped together with E. 
gigas while SL 013,015,017,014,019,020 clustered with E. bacillaris (KEW 22). 
KEW 27 and KEW 37 are confirmed to be one species namely E. arenaria; while SL 
023 and 026 are E. dolichorrhachis; KEW 26 and 34 clustered together as E. 
abyssinica. 
Specimen SL 006 (= Erythrophleum sauveolens) was separated from the rest of 
the clusters (see fig. 8.4). 
In all the phenograms, the OTUs were observed to cluster into species except in 
the Nearest Neighbour where most of them did not cluster as expected. 
8.3.2 Main analysis 
In the main analysis (fig. 8.5): nearest neighbour - E. parvifolia, E. reticulata, E. 
pursaetha, E. monostachya, E. gigas and E. zeylanica clustered together. Another 
cluster observed comprised of E. chrysostachys, E. arenaria, E. wahlbergii, E. 
phaneroneura, E. stuhlmannii, E. tuberosa, E. mossambicensis and E. nudiflora. 
In the furthest neighbour (fig. 8.6), E. spiralis, E. gigas, E. glandulosa, E. 
borneensis, E. pursaetha, E. phaseoloides, E. zeylanica, E. reticulata, E. parvifolia and 
E. monostachya clustered together. In this cluster, E. reticulata was closely related to 
E. parvifolia. Another close relationship is between E. spiralis and E. gigas followed 
by E. reticulata/parvifolia and E. zeylanica. 
The Group Average phenogram (fig. 8.7) divides the genus into two major 
groups. Group one comprises of E. spiralis, E. gigas, E. pursaetha, E. zeylanica, E. 
reticulata, E. parvifolia, E. monostachya, E. glandulosa, E. borneensis and E. 
phaseoloides while group two is comprised of E. africana, E. arenaria, E. 
chrysostachys, E. stuhlmannii, E. phaneroneura, E. wahlbergii, E. tuberosa, E. 
polystachya, E. leptostachya, E. nudiflora, E. mossambicensis, E. bacillaris, E. 
dolichorrhachis, E. abyssinica, E. hockii, E. polyphylla, E. camerunensis, E. mannii and 
E. spinescens.

8.4 DISCUSSION 
In the preliminary analysis, phenograms were used to confirm identification. In 
this analysis, furthest neighbour and group average were found to confirm the identity 
of the species. 
In all phenograms E. phaneroneura and E. stuhlmannii came out together. This 
confirms the statement made by Brenan (1978) that "in the key to the African species in 
Brenan (1966), E. phaneroneura will come down to E. stuhlmannii, to which it appears 
to be closely related, " but, according to him with which I totally agree, it differs in the 
more numerous narrow leaflets which are more asymmetric at the base. Other species 
in the nearest neighbour phenogram were very different from one another. 
The clustering in furthest neighbour (fig. 8.6) represents a link between the small 
globose or subglobose seeded exareolate species from the large circular or subcircular 
flat seeded exareolate species: forming distinct sections of the subgenus Entada. 
Other clusters (which supported a taxonomic decision based on morphological 
characters) in the Furthest Neighbour phenogram (fig. 8.6) are those between E. 
africana, E. arenaria, E. chrysostachys, E. stuhlmannii, E. phaneroneura, E. wahlbergii, 
E. tuberosa, E. leptostachya, E. polystachya, E. nudiflora, and E. mossambicensis as one 
group; and E. bacillaris, E. dolichorrhachis, E. abyssinica, E. hockii, E. mannii, E. 
spinescens, E. polyphylla and E. camerunensis as another. Even in this phenogram, E. 
phaneroneura and E. stuhlmannii came out together. The closest relationship is 
observed between E. stuhimannii/phaneroneura and E. wahlbergii. 
The two groups in the group average phenogram (fig. 8.7) show there to be a 
single major division in the genus which should be represented by two subgenera. 
The closest relationships observed in group average are E. phaneroneura and E. 
stuhlmannii followed by the previous pair with E. wahlbergii then E. reticulata with E. 
parvifolia and then E. stuhlmannii, phaneroneura, wahlbergii together with E. tuberosa

mention. 
Brenan's classification in table 8.5 shows his subgeneric classification of Entada. 
His classification divided the genus into subgenus Entada and subgenus Acanthentada. 
After he (Brenan, 1986) removed all the species in subgenus Acanthentada to a separate 
genus Adenopodia, the genus Entada remained with six sections. Brenan's section 
Entada is recognised in the analysis as a group, but the other six sections are mixed 
together in a second group. Based on the two major groupings in the phenograms I 
have divided the genus into two subgenera viz subgenus Entada and subgenus 
Neoentada. 
There are sufficient characters to warrant subgeneric classification (which I have 
discussed in Chapter 9) to support the numerical analysis; among the important ones 
being leaf shape, pod size, and areole on the seed coat. Table 8.6 shows my 
classification of the genus. I have recognised two sections in subgenus Entada while 
there are six sections in subgenus Neoentada. From Brenan's section Neoentada, I have 
recognised a new section Suffruticosa of which description is presented in Chapter 8. 
The classification outlined in table 8.6 has been supported by data analysis at 
least at the subgeneric level. Though sections in subgenus Entada were clearly 
separated, they were not very clearly so in subgenus Neoentada. The reason for this is 
that there is a lot of character overlap making it difficult for sections to come out so 
clearly in the analysis. However, in the group average analysis, some sections clustered 
well except for the section Entadopsis which had E. polystachya clustering with species 
in section Neoentada while the other member of the section, E. polyphylla clustered 
with members of the section Porphyrostachys. I consider the position of the 
inflorescence important, therefore species with terminal inflorescences (Entada

The classification of sections have also been supported by geographical 
distribution: Entadopsis being only found in Americas, Neoentada and Porphyrostachys 
in Africa, Apadenia in Madagascar while Sphaerospermae is found only in Asia. Large 
seeded section Entada particularly species like E. gigas and E. rheedii have world wide 
distribution. This could be linked to seed dispersal. These species are principally found 
to grow along or around water bodies (rivers, lake or sea shores) and their seed are 
dispersed by water (Betham-Jutting, 1977; Hurtley, 1982; Reddy, 1990; Rushton, 1988). 
This is therefore presumed to be an explanation for its worldwide distribution. 
Chapter Nine 
TAXONOMIC TREATMENTS 
9.1 INTRODUCTION 
The genus Entada has not received worldwide treatment since Bentham's 
revision of the suborder Mimoseae (Bentham, 1875), but there are separate floristic 
treatments of Entada for some regions. African species were revised by Brenan (1959, 
1966,1970) and Asian species by Nielsen (1985,1992). A key to the whole genus has 
never been prepared. In this chapter, I will present a taxonomic treatment and key to 
all species, worldwide. 
9.2 MATERIALS AND METHOD 
Specimens of Entada species were received from 11 herbaria listed in table 9.1. 
Visits to Kew herbarium and occasional visits to Meise, Oxford, British Museum and 
Wageningen herbaria increased the number of specimens examined. A list of specimens 
examined is presented in Appendix I. 
After preliminary examination of the specimens, a series of characters to be 
studied were identified and a data sheet was constructed (see Appendix II a and b). 
Among the characters considered useful for a morphological study were: habit, mainly 
taken from the collectors notes; leaf structure, form, size (length and width); vestiture 
(whether the leaf is pubescent or glabrous) of leaf; rachis and stem indumentum. 
Measurements of rachis length, pinnarrhachis length, leaflet length and width and 
petiolule length were made with the help of a dial calliper (micrometer). The number 
of pinnae and pinnule pairs was established for every specimen. The shape of the leaf 
base and apex and entire leaf was described.

SUMMARY/GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 
AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
10.1 SUMMARY/GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 
Seed morphology was useful in that some characters could be used to delimit 
species. Among the characters useful is the presence or absence of an areole. Species 
in the section Entada are all exareolate while species in the other sections are areolate. 
The form of areole is a particularly reliable character. Some species such as E. 
chrysostachys have a closed areole while other species such as E. dolichorrhachis have 
an open areole. The distance between areole `arms' in open areoles is also diagnostic. 
Entada camerunensis has a shorter distance between the arms than E. dolichorrhachis. 
To some extent, seed size is also useful in delimiting species though there is 
quite some variation in seed size within one species from different provenances as was 
observed in E. abyssinica. Exareolate seeds of species such as E. gigas, E. 
monostachya, E. phaseoloides, E. rheedii and E. spiralis are generally considerably 
larger than areolate seeds. 
Two seedling types were observed though they did not correlate well with seed 
types. Generally the climbers were observed to have epigeal germination while the 
trees and shrubs have hypogeal germination. The argument could be that the climbing 
plants need the cotyledons for food supply and manufacture before true leaves develop. 
The food reserve is essential for vigorous growth of the seedling in search of sunlight. 
During field work, 'this observation was clear and was further supported in the 
greenhouse where it was observed that climbing plants grew faster than the trees and 
shrubs. 
Pollen grains of Entada are basically simple, mostly tricolporate. They show 
variation in nature of colpi and pores. The shape is mostly spherical but they vary 
greatly in size. The pollen surface is punctate in all the species of Entada. 
The results of pollen morphology show that species of Entada can be 
separated into two major groups based on size, but there is not enough inter-specific 
variation to separate specimens to species. Species from Australasia, mostly lianas, 
have larger pollen grains than the African species. 
Chemical compounds elucidated and analyzed were mainly flavonoids. 
Common flavonoids in Entada species are quercetin and kaempferol. These two 
compounds were found in all the species studied. The distribution of these compounds 
was mostly in leaves as most root and bark extracts did not show strongly these 
compounds and they were particularly absent in roots. 
The speed at which these compounds moved during chromatography and the 
concentrations of these compounds differed from species to species, implying that the 
position of the compound on the chromatogram and its intensity could be used to 
delimit species from one another. The difference in speed is attributed to the sugars 
which a compound carries and the position at which it is attached. It was observed that 
the concentration of quercetin was low in Entada dolichorrhachis while it was high in 
E. bacillaris. 
Other compounds also found in Entada species were luteolin and apigenin 
though these were not common. They were only found in Entada nudiflora. According 
to Harborne (1971), flavonoids are considered as phylogenetic markers in that flavonols 
are more common in leaves of woody plants, being replaced by flavones in leaves 
herbaceous plants. Hence, E. nudiflora is considered as an advanced species 
chemically. 
A much rarer compound found in Entada is a flavonone called naringenin. It 
was absent in all samples studied except in leaves of Entada bacillaris var. plurijuga. 
Therefore this was found to be a useful compound in distinguishing var. plurijuga from 
var. bacillaris. 
Tissue composition in the stems of Entada is basically the same in all species. 
It comprises of a single layer of epidermal cells; a cortex composed of collenchyma 
cells separated from the pith by a collateral ring of vascular tissue; and a pith composed 
of primary parenchyma cells. A vascular cambium was found in all the specimens 
studied. 
The structure of the petiole is also basically the same and similar to the stems, 
but in addition, there are rib traces of vascular tissue which give vascular supply to 
leaflets. Leaf traces were not found in petioles of Entada dolichorrhachis supporting its 
infrageneric classification. The composition of tissues in petiolules is arranged in the 
same manner as that found in the petioles in all species of Entada. 
In a cross section of a pedicel of all Entada species, a circular ring of vascular 
tissue was found. The vascular tissue is composed of an inner layer of xylem and an 
outer layer of phloem. The vascular tissue surrounds the pith composed of parenchyma 
cells. To the outer side of the phloem is a parenchymatous cortex bordered with a 
single layer of epidermal cells. 
The arrangement and organisation of vascular tissue in the floral parts is of 
significant value, though one could not make taxonomic decisions based on these 
characters alone. However, they could be used in combination with morphological 
characters to arrive at good taxonomic decisions. 
A correlation has been observed between lengths of sepals and stamens. 
Species with short sepals have long stamens while those with sepals the same length as 
the petals had relatively shorter stamens. Floral anatomical observations did not show 
any correlation with the sections proposed by Brenan (1966) indicating that they could 
not solely be used to make taxonomic inferences. 
A molecular approach was attempted but due to inadequate material and time 
constraint, no conclusive results were obtained (see appendix V). 
From general morphological measurements and observation, the genus has 
been split into two subgenera, and eight sections are recognised, five of which had 
previously been proposed by Brenan (1966) while one is new and two changed status. 
The subgenera recognised are Entada and Neoentada. Two sections in Subgen. Entada 
are sect. Entada and sect. Sphaerospermae while those recognised in subgen. Neoentada 
are: Neoentada, Suffruticosa, Apadenia, Entadopsis, Dolichorrhachis, and 
Porphyrostachys. The following is the summary of sections with their respective 
species.

10.2 RECOMMENDATIONS 
The specimen from Botswana near Ngami, fr. 18.12.1941 Hornby 2353 (PRE) 
did not fit in any protologue of the recognised species and hence is probably a new 
species. The specimen is in such a poor state that it is not possible to construct a 
meaningful description from it. I therefore recommend collection around Ngami in 
order to obtain specimens for the description of this new species.

Appendix III. Histological procedures 
Embedding 
Fixed samples were dehydrated through an alcohol series of 70%, 90% and 100% EtOH for one 
hour at each step. They were then treated with two changes of 100% EtOH 
for an hour each and 
transferred to a mixture of 100% ethanol: histoclear (1: 1) for one hour before transferring them to pure 
histoclear where they remained for another hour. After two further changes of histoclear. the tissue was 
just submerged in histoclear and paraplast added to double the volume. The sample tubes were then put 
in an oven at 60C overnight. 
At the same time as the samples were put in the oven, a 200 ml beaker half full of paraplast was 
also put there. The next day, the paraplast/histoclear mixture in the sample tubes was replaced with fresh 
molten paraplast from the beaker and left for 24 hours after which it was changed a second time. and left 
for a further 24 hours. 
The samples were then transferred to paper boats and more hot paraplast added to make up a 
block of not less than 10mm thickness (and at least 10mm between samples). With the help of a mounted 
needle, pieces of the samples were positioned to allow for sufficient cutting distance. Paper boats were 
then removed from the oven and put on the bench at room temperature until the paraplast became turbid 
or almost opaque (3 minutes) before transferring them to cold water to complete solidification. 
Sectioning 
Sections were made at 20m thickness with a rotary microtome. Transverse sections of the 
flower were made in series from the pedicel to the apex. A drop of water was put on a glass slide coated 
with Haupt's adhesive (see over page for recipe). A ribbon of sections was put on the water drop and the 
slide put on a warm plate (40C) to straighten the sections. Slides were left on the warm plate until the 
water dried out. 
Staining 
Slides were loaded into staining dishes. Histoclear was added gently and left to stand for 15 
minutes to dissolve the paraplast from around the sections after which it was replaced with fresh 
histoclear for 2 minutes to wash out the remaining paraplast. Slides were put in a 1: 1 mixture of 
histoclear and 100% EtOH for 5 minutes, then hydrated through an alcohol series of 100%. 90%. 70%, 
50%, 30% and water for 2 minutes in each. 
Sections were stained with Alcian blue (lg Alcian blue in 100ml distilled water, 2m1 
formaldehyde, 3 drops glacial acetic acid) for 2 minutes and washed with water for one minute before 
putting them in 30% EtOH for another minute. They were then stained with Safranin in 50% EtOH for 2 
minutes and then washed for 2 minutes with 50% ethanol. 
After staining, sections were dehydrated through an alcohol series of 70%. 90%, 95% and 100% 
EtOH for 2 minutes in each. They were passed through a 1: 1 mixture of 100% ethanol and histoclear for 
2 minutes before changing them twice in histoclear for a further 2 minutes each time. 
From histoclear the slides were removed one by one on to the hot plate (50C) and 2 drops of 
Canada Balsam added before putting a cover slip on. They were left there to dry for 24 hours. 
Slides were observed under the light microscope to select sections for photography. Photographs 
were then taken under the light microscope. 
Preparation of Haupt's adhesive 
100 ml of distilled water was heated to not more than 30C and Ig of gelatine dissolved in it. (Gelatin 
requiring a high temperature for aqueous solution is not satisfactory. If the gelatine does not dissolve 
quickly, it will start to decompose). 
When, and not until, the gelatine was completely dissolved, 2g of phenol crystals (using safety gloves) 
and 15 ml glycerol were added and stirred. Finally the solution was filtered and stored in a stopped bottle 
at 4C. 
Note: Phenol (crystals) are TOXIC in contact with skin (causing burns) and if swallowed.

Appendix V. MOLECULAR SYSTEMATICS 
INTRODUCTION 
A preliminary study of variation in the rpoC region of cpDNA was carried out following work 
by Liston (1992). Liston studied 14 species of the genus Astragalus L. (Fabaceae) for variation in the 
chloroplast genes rpoCl and rpoC2. Phylogenetic analysis of the cpDNA data indicated close relationship 
among six species in his survey. The only phylogenetically informative cpDNA character he found in 
cismontane annuals was the 10-bp insertion/deletion in A. clarianus and A. pauperculus. Based on 
Liston's (1992) findings, it was considered potentially useful to apply the technique to Entada. 
MATERIALS AND METHOD 
1. Materials 
The materials used in this study were collected in Zambia during the Entada collection expedition 
(Lungu, 1993). During the collection, leaf samples were silica gel dried and stored under vacuum for ten 
months before use (table V. 1). Seeds collected during this expedition were also grown and leaves 
harvested from them (table V. 2).

The CTAB was prepared a few hours before the extraction was started to allow the PVP-40 
enough time to dissolve. It was warmed up in a water bath at 60C for at least 10 minutes before 
extraction started. 
3. DNA extraction 
All DNA extractions were carried out according to the shortened cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide 
(CTAB) method of Doyle & Doyle (1987). 
Approximately 1. Og of fresh material was collected on ice and placed in a mortar. For silica gel 
dried samples, 0.5g was used. In a fume cupboard, liquid nitrogen was added and while the liquid 
nitrogen was boiling away, the plant material was crushed to a fine powder with a firm rocking motion of 
the pestle. 5m1 CTAB buffer was poured on the still-frozen powder and stirred with a plastic spatula to 
mix thoroughly. The grindate and buffer was decanted into a screw-top plastic centrifuge tube and the 
cap replaced. The mixture was incubated at 60C for 15-40 minutes with regular gentle swirling. The 
volume of the above mixture was doubled with chloroformliso-amyl alcohol (24: 1) and mixed by gently 
rocking the tube for 10 minutes. The mixture was then spun at 800-1200 rpm for 2 minutes to improve 
phase separation. The aqueous phase (top layer) was pipetted off to a clean screw-top plastic centrifuge 
tube. The nucleic acids were precipitated by gently mixing with 2/3 volume of ice-cold isopropanol and 
left in a freezer for between one hour and overnight. 
Where the DNA formed a visible lump, the supernatant was decanted off and the pellet 
transferred to an eppendorf tube, but, where there was no visible or very loose DNA, an aliquot of the 
solution was transferred to an eppendorf tube, spun gently (usually 1 minute) to pellet and the supernatant 
decanted off. The procedure was repeated until all the solution had been pelleted into one eppendorf. 
The nucleic acids were washed in 1 ml wash buffer (76% ethanol, 10 mM ammonium acetate) for 15-30 
minutes with gentle movement on a rocking platform. The pellet was spun down and the supernatant 
decanted. The DNA was air dried until the smell of ethanol was gone. 90 pl of resuspension buffer (10 
mM ammonium acetate, 0.25 mM EDTA) was then added to the eppendorf to dissolve the pellet. Where 
dissolution of the pellet was difficult; samples were left in a fridge overnight. The DNA was diluted with 
2 volumes (180 pl) of distilled water, then 1/2 volume (135 pl) ammonium acetate (7.5 M ammonium 
acetate) was added and mixed gently by swirling. 2.5 volumes (1000 pl) of ice-cold ethanol was then 
added, the solution was gently mixed and left in a freezer overnight for the nucleic acids to precipitate. 
The DNA was spun down and the supernatant drained off, removing any remaining drops of solution by 
dabbing with paper towels. The pellet was then air dried until the smell of alcohol had gone (10 minutes 
to overnight). The dried pellet was dissolved in 90pl of TE buffer (10mM Tris-HCI pH 8.0,1mM EDTA 
pH 8.0). 
4. Checking the yield of DNA 
5 pl of the DNA extract was mixed with 1 p1 of loading buffer (0.25% bromophenol blue, 40% w/v 
sucrose in water) and run on a 0.8% agar, 0.5x TBE gel at 100V for 3-5 hours. The gel was stained with 
ethidium bromide and bands visualised under long wave UV light. 
5. Study of variation in the rpoC region of cpDNA 
DNA was diluted 1: 100 in autoclaved nanopure water before use in the PCR reactions. 
lox PCR stock solution was made with the following formulation: 
100 mM Tris-HCI pH 8.3 1 ml 
500 mM KC1 5 ml 
15 mM MgCI 0.15 ml

0.05% NP 40 0.05 ml 
0.01% Gelatin 0.10 ml 
Water 3.65 ml 
Total volume 10 ml 
Test tubes were labelled 0-4 according to the concentration of DNA which was to be used i. e. 0, 
1,5 and 10 times. The mixtures were made according to the following set-up.

When the temperature reached 70C, DNA was added (0,1,5 and lop to tube 1.2.3 and 4 
respectively) and the program allowed to proceed to the next step. Reactions were run overnight. 
On the following day molecular weight marker was made to the following formulation.

10 pl of each PCR reaction was pipetted out to a clean eppendorf and 1 p1 of loading buffer 
added to each tube. The eppendorfs were shaken gently to mix the PCR reaction and the loading buffer, 
spun briefly and the mixture loaded on 0.7% agar gel. The electrophoresis was run for 3.5 hours and the 
gel photographed under long wave UV after staining with ethidium bromide. 
RESULTS 
DNA yield is shown in plate V. 1 a, b and c; products of the polymerase chain reaction are 
presented in plate V. 1 d. 
DISCUSSION 
The DNA yield in all the specimens was generally good. The amplification of the rpoC region 
was chosen because it shows few structural rearrangements (Liston, 1992) and universal primers were 
therefore available. The amplified rpoCl-rpoC2 region is within a single operon and only two land plant 
chloroplast rearrangements occur within operons (Parmer, 1991). In the case where one of the above 
separates rpoB-rpoCl from rpoC2, this primer pair would not function (Liston, 1992). 
The results obtained above were not conclusive because of insufficient material and time 
constraints. Amplification of such large DNA fragments (4.1kb) made the PCR technique unusually
