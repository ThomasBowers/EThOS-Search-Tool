Abstract 
Research suggests that in order to be creative and weather organisational changes, employees need 
to feel psychologically safe (Edmondson, 1999). And yet today, many organisations operate in such a 
way as to confound this: constant change, matrix structures, poor leadership and job insecurity 
undermine mechanisms that can create Psychological Safety.  
Psychological Safety has been considered a group construct (Edmondson, 1999). This study adds to 
the field by investigating the role of Psychological Safety at an individual level, hypothesising that the 
greater the individuals psychological resources, the greater their levels of Psychological Safety.    
The study measured psychological resources using three models: Kahns (1990) Psychological 
Dimensions, Goods (2009) Cognitive Flexibility and the Psychological Capital (PsyCap) model 
(Luthans & Church, 2002). Extant research suggests that resilience is a result of the leveraging of 
resources, therefore the role of resilience in the Psychological Capital model was hypothesised to sit 
outside of the Psychological Capital model. 
Focus groups, a student pilot study (N=40) and an employee study (N=160) supported the hypothesis 
that resilience sits outside the Psychological Capital model. Results showed that attitudes of 
Optimism and Hope predicted Psychological Safety and Self-Efficacy, Hope and Attentional Control 
predicted Resilience. Underlying each of these were emotional resources, cognitive resources, 
openness and self-consciousness. The greater the level of psychological resources, the more positive 
the attitude and the greater the Psychological Safety and Resilience scores.  A mixed methods 
longitudinal study demonstrated skills that enable Hope, Optimism and Self-Efficacy as well as 
openness could be developed within a half day workshop.  
This research recognises that employees have a role to play in their own Psychological Safety and 
resilience. Implications of the research and recommendations based on these findings are then 
suggested for organisations and employees. Students were found to have less psychological 
resources than employees though this requires further research. 
Keywords: Psychological Safety, resilience, psychological resources, self-efficacy, hope, optimism, 
cognitive flexibility.

Acknowledgements 
My heartfelt thanks go to my two supervisors, each of whom added their own unique gifts to the 
process. 
Professor Patricia Riddell, thank you for your guidance, wisdom and statistical drawings. Your 
expertise and ability to challenge my thinking has led to a depth of learning I never could have 
imagined.  
Dr Dorota Bourne (and Clara), thank you for the alternative viewpoints: for keeping it real Your 
ability to identify whats important (in writing and life) has helped me keep focus. 
To you both, thank you for the opportunities and the support during the tough times.  And of course, 
the laughs  it was fun and I will miss this 
My sister Karen. Studying at the same time, feeling each others pain has brought us even closer 
together, so no matter the outcome of this thesis, it has been worthwhile. 
Finally, to my friends and family who have supported me through this, at times even financially  
thank you, I know I owe you more than a few drinks.

1. Background and Rationale 
1.1 Introduction  
Todays fast moving and competitive environment in which organisations operate has been termed 
VUCA: an American military term referring to Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous situations. 
In response, to remain competitive, organisations have changed the way in which they operate. The 
need to remain agile and responsive to changing and dynamic markets had led to flexible, project 
based organisational structures (Popova, Shynkarenko, Kryvoruchko, & Zman, 2018), remote 
working and more flexible employment contracts (CIPD, 2019c). This can create an increased level of 
uncertainty for employees (CIPD, 2013; Li, Liang & Farh, 2018).  Simultaneously, demands on 
employees have risen; demands on their time, their interpersonal skills, their cognitive skills, their 
flexibility and ultimately their mental health (CIPD, 2013, 2019b; Quelch, & Knoop, 2018). Such 
demands can deplete employees psychological resources to such an extent it can result in emotional 
exhaustion (CIPD, 2019b; Sijbom, Lang, & Anseel, 2019; Vammen et al., 2019). 
In conditions of complexity and uncertainty feeling psychologically safe is especially 
important (Edmondson et al., 2016 p.80) as it enables individuals to put their energies into problem 
prevention and solution creation, rather than into self-preservation (Schien, 1993). Psychological 
Safety has been associated with the ability to be creative and innovative (Gong et al., 2012; Kark & 
Carmeli, 2009), increased engagement at work (Kahn, 1990), performance (Carmeli, Tishler & 
Edmondson, 2012; Schaubrook, Lam & Peng, 2011) and importantly in the VUCA environment, the 
ability to establish new routines (Edmondson & Lei, 2014 p.34).  
Psychological Safety has been considered a group level phenomenon (Edmondson & Lei, 2014 
p.30) and extant research has been in the context of teams in non-VUCA organisations. However, 
teams in todays organisations are more geographically dispersed, remote and often with temporary 
membership, (Cartwright, 2003; Edmondson & Harvey, 2017; Faraj & Yan, 2009; Gibson & Gibbs, 
2006; Heerwagen, Kelly & Kampschroer, 2016; Mohrman, 1999). Therefore, the central research 
question is whether we can continue to rely on teams or organisations to provide us with 
mechanisms that create Psychological Safety? Should we be looking to intrinsic personal resources 
for our Psychological Safety? If so, which personal resources are key to Psychological Safety? The 
following chapter describes the rationale and context for this research, identifying the gap that it 
intends to address and the benefits of doing so. Finally it will provide an overview of the subsequent 
dissertation structure.

1.2 The Environment Has Changed 
Driven by globalisation, economic and political instability, social and cultural shifts and rapid 
technological change (Asongu, 2015; Baard, Rench & Kozlowski, 2014; Griffin & Hesketh, 2003;  
Haskel & Martin, 2001; Ployhart & Bliese, 2006; Truce, 2017) todays VUCA environment is 
synonymous with new and unexpected challenges. Due to the many interconnected, sometimes 
global, variables both within and outside of organisations the relationship between cause and effect 
may not be known. Consequently organisations are dealing with unknown unknowns (Bennett & 
Lemoine, 2014b, p.27) resulting in ill-defined problems and novel situations (Chan, 2000). These are 
described as problems that are difficult to define or even to know which information is relevant to a 
potential solution, of which there may be many (Mumford et al.,  2000). Leveraging past experience 
or historical data to address these no longer provides the competitive edge needed (Cousins, 2018; 
De Meuse, 2010). In such dynamic, fast moving and uncertain environments, to remain competitive, 
organisations need to be able to adapt quickly and innovatively to meet environmental demands 
(Cartwright, 2003; Griffin & Hesketh, 2003; PrezBustamante, 1999; Schuler, Jackson & Tarique, 
2011). 
The agility needed to meet these demands, requires changing organisational norms, processes, 
operational models, structures and technology (Cartwright 2003; Chan, 2000).  Indeed, change and 
its increasing pace, has become the norm in organisations (Beechler & Woodward, 2009; Weick & 
Quinn, 1999; Worrall & Cooper, 2012). The consequence of such rapid and continuous change is that 
organisations are less predictable and stable (Beechler et al., 2009; McArthur, 2016) resulting in 
increased ambiguity and uncertainty (McArthur, 2016).  
As organisations experience pressure to change, so do the employees within them (Ployhart & Bliese, 
2006).  A new breed of employee is needed. One who is technologically, culturally, globally and 
change literate with the skills and resources to be able to cope in todays increasingly delayered, 
disaggregated organisations (Chambers et al., 1998 p.47). To succeed in this dynamic and uncertain 
business environment organisations demand a high level of employee adaptability (Beechler & 
Woodward, 2009; Chan, 2000; Griffin & Hesketh, 2003; Ployhart & Bliese, 2006; Wanberg & Banas 
2000). Changes in organisational structure, technology and job assignments require workers to be 
flexible in adopting new roles, modifying existing work behaviours, acquiring new skills, moving jobs 
or even careers with increasing frequency (Chan, 2000; Ployhart & Bliese, 2006; Wanberg & 
Kammeyer-Mueller, 2000). The pace of technological change means that existing knowledge soon 
becomes obsolete (Shaffer, 2011). Employees are expected not only to gain the skills and knowledge 
needed but to be able to apply them in innovative and creative ways in order to create competitive 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  29 
advantage (Hill & Davis, 2017; Kark & Carmeli, 2009; Kroon, van Woerkom & Menting, 2017; Nelson 
& McCann, 2010; Sharkie, 2005).  
This has resulted in a demand for more highly educated workers, particularly across OECD 
(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries (Michaels, Natraj & Van 
Reenen, 2014). In the UK the CIPD predicts knowledge intensive industries will increase the demand 
for high-skilled labour, relying less on low- and middle-skilled employees (CIPD, 2015). The 
dichotomy is that as the demand for such talents increases, globally there is a supply shortage 
(Beechler & Woodward, 2009; Chambers et al., 1998; Jamrog 2004; Nelson et al., 2010; Schuler, 
Jackson & Tarique, 2011). McKinsey and Companys phrase The War on Talent is as relevant today 
as it was in 1998. An aging population (Cracknell, 2010) is reducing the talent pool from which 
organisations can draw.  In 2011 the McKinsey Quarterly Review (Manyika et al., 2011) estimated 
that by the end of 2020 the US will have a shortage of up to 1.5 million workers with degrees or 
higher that will be needed to fill the skills profiles of future jobs. In the UK, 30% of the workforce is 
over the age of 50 (CIPD, 2015), and  while one-in-six of the UK population is currently aged 65 and 
over, by 2050 this figure is estimated to be one in-four, posing a risk of critical knowledge loss in the 
next 30 years.  So the competition is high for the best talent who, if dissatisfied, can confidently take 
their skill and knowledge and walk out the door at any time (Mohrman, Finegold, & Klein, 2002 
p.140)  possibly straight into a competitors organisation.  
Therefore, not only do organisations need to attract talent into roles that demands creativity, 
research, and the abilities of the mind (Amar & Hlupic, 2016 p.240), they need to create 
environments that enable these talents to generate outputs that are transformative and innovative 
(Baer & Frieze, 2003; Greenspan, 1997). Therefore, creating an environment that encourages 
innovation and creativity is becoming a critical organization competency (Nadler & Tushman, 1999; 
Nelson & McCann, 2010; Schuler, Jackson & Tarique, 2011). Such an environment is one in which any 
potential personal risks that may be associated with innovation-generating behaviour such as 
learning from mistakes, voicing new ideas or challenging the status quo are minimal (Baer & Frese, 
2003; Claxton, 2001; Edmondson, 1999; Edmondson & Mogelof, 2006; Hodgkinson et al., 2009;  
West, 2000).  Free from the fear of interpersonal risk taking (Edmondson, 1999 p.350) employees 
are able to channel their cognitive and emotional resources into their role and workplace (May, 
Gilson & Harter, 2004; Wanless, 2016a, 2016b). It is in this environment that employees feel 
Psychologically Safe (Baer et al., 2003; Edmondson, 1999; Kahn, 1990; May et al., 2004).

1.3 Psychological Safety 
Psychological Safety has been defined as feeling able to show and employ ones self without fear of 
negative consequences to self-image, status or career (Kahn, 1990, p708). Extant research has 
identified the organisational mechanisms that contribute to Psychological Safety. These include 
organisational structure (Bunderson & Boumgarden, 2010), work design (Hackman & Oldham, 1976), 
role clarity (Frazier, Fainshmidt, Klinger, Pezeshkan & Vracheva, 2017) and job enrichment (Maslach, 
Schaufeli & Leiter, 2001; May et al., 2004).  Leadership styles have been shown to positively impact 
Psychological Safety (Edmondson, 1999; Kahn, 1990)  such as transformational leadership (Detert & 
Burris, 2007), ethical leadership (Walumbwa & Schaubroeck, 2009), servant leadership (Schaubroeck, 
Lam & Peng, 2011), leadermember exchange (Coombe, 2010), trust in ones leader (Madjar & Ortiz-
Walters, 2009) and the provision of a supportive work context (Frazier et al., 2017; Maslach et al., 
2001). The interaction with peers has also been shown to contribute to Psychological Safety 
(Edmondson, 1999; Kahn, 1990) such as support from team members (Schepers et al., 2008), team 
caring (Bstieler & Hemmert, 2010), and trust in team members (Zhang et al., 2010). Indeed, current 
Psychological Safety definitions and measurements refer to the cognitive, motivational, and affective 
state of a team at certain point in time as a result of team interaction (Edmondson & Mogelof, 2006; 
Faraj & Yan, 2009; Marks, Mathieu & Zaccaro,  2001;  Mayfield, Tombaugh & Lee,  2016), 
And yet paradoxically, the consequences of the VUCA environment appears to confound these 
mechanisms (De Meuse, 2003; Mumford et al., 2000) as organisations human resource strategies 
strive to stay lean and agile (Direnzo & Greenhaus, 2011). Traditional employment relationships are 
changing (Sharkie, 2005) resulting in a rise in the gig-economy, zero hour contracts and temporary 
employment (De Witte, Pienaar & De Cuyper, 2016; Guest, 2017).  Job descriptions and role clarity, 
the bedrock of workers stability (De Smet, Lund & Schaninger, 2016 p.3), are now replaced with 
blurred boundaries and fluid job assignments (Buhler, 2011; Cartwright, 2003; McArthur, 2016; 
Mohrman, 1999). The security of team membership may now be replaced by virtual and multiple 
team membership (Cartwright, 2003; Edmondson & Harvey, 2017; Faraj & Yan, 2009; Gibson & 
Gibbs, 2006; Heerwagen Kelly & Kampschroer, 2016) which can create conflicting priorities and/or 
communications (Mohrman, 1999).  Organisational structures are becoming flatter (Ashkenas, 2012; 
Craig 2016; Heerwagen et al., 2016), norms, processes and operational models are all changing 
(Cartwright, 2003). And the change is constant (Bawany, 2016; Beechler et al., 2009; Cartwright, 
2003; Greenspan, 1997; Heerwagen, Kelly & Kampschroer, 2016). The VUCA environment has led to 
a pattern of worsening work environments (Kallaith & Kallaith, 2012) with increased pressure 
(Mumford et al., 2000; Ployhart & Bliese, 2006) and uncertain goals or the means to achieve them 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  31 
(Mumford et al., 2000). All of which has a moderating effect on Psychological Safety (Faraj & Yan, 
2009).  
Increasing insecurity at work (Chan 2000; Direnzo & Greenhaus 2011; De Witte et al., 2016) can 
result in an employees cognitive and emotional resources being invested into self-protection 
mechanisms (Bradley et al., 2012; Christian, Garza & Slaughter, 2011; May, Gilson & Harter, 2004; 
Ruttan & Nordgren, 2016; Schien 1993) rather than innovation, creativity or problem solving. 
Increased stress levels can compromise an employees ability to adapt, innovate and perform, as 
stress-induced hormones have a detrimental effect on the brains pre-frontal cortex the area 
central to intelligent, goal-directed behaviour (Miller, Freedman & Wallis 2002 p.1123) and needed 
to deal with complexity and adaptation (Arnsten, 1999 p.221). The workplace in which employees 
have the time and space to invest their psychological resources in innovation-generating behaviour 
seems further away than ever.   
The rise of globalisation and technological advancement is not likely to slow down, at least not in this 
authors lifetime, so the need for organisations to remain lean and agile remains paramount to 
survival in the VUCA world. In addition, organisations need employees who are adaptable, flexible, 
smart thinking and innovative. The dichotomy seems to be that the former need seems to thwart the 
latter. 
In continuing to look to organisations and teams to be the sole provider of Psychological Safety 
mechanisms, employees may be found wanting. Kahns (1990) definition of Psychological Safety 
refers to being able to show and employ oneself.. (p.705). However using extrinsic organisational 
mechanisms to create Psychological Safety will at best create an environment whereby the employee 
is willing to show and employ oneself.  Even if the perfect organisational mechanisms or team were 
in place to create Psychological Safety, the reality is that Psychological Safety is a subjective concept 
that is determined by individuals beliefs or perceptions of their environment (Baer et al., 2003; 
Baltes, Zhdanova & Parker, 2009;  Edmondson, 1999; Rousseau et al., 1998; Siebert, Wang & 
Courtright, 2011; Wanless 2016;  Zinsser & Zinsser,  2016). Despite working in the same environment, 
employees may attach different meanings to events and interactions depending on their individual 
state and trait-like characteristics, past experiences and their available psychological resources 
(Wanless, 2016). The extent to which an employee is able to show and employ oneself may depend 
on more intrinsic psychological and emotional processes (Holtom, Mitchell & Lee, 2006; Stajkovic, 
2006) than organisational mechanisms. 
Kahns (1990) Psychological Dimensions model identifies three dimensions needed for workplace 
engagement. The Meaningfulness and Safety dimensions of his model refer to the extrinsic 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  32 
mechanisms for engagement such a meaningful work and relations with colleagues. However, to be 
able to fully employ oneself at work, the individual also needs a sense of possessing the physical, 
emotional and psychological resources (Kahn, 1990 p.714).  This he refers to as the Availability 
Dimension which includes emotional resources, insecurity (cognitive resources) and outside (work) 
life. 
Resource theories suggest that individuals navigate their world by adapting and leveraging their 
intrinsic and extrinsic resources to maintain a sense of personal equilibrium and to deal with lifes 
challenges (Carver, 1998; Masten et al., 1999; McEwen, 2016; Richardson, 2002; Tusaie & Dyer, 
2004). Consistent with resource theories, Luthans, Avey, Avolio and Peterson define personal 
resources as measurable characteristics that predict positive outcomes and adaptation to adverse 
circumstances (2010, p.47).  Obtaining, retaining, and deploying personal resources protects 
individuals from situations that might otherwise adversely affect psychological or physical wellbeing 
(King et al., 1999). Those rich in personal resources are able deploy these to cope and adapt to both 
work and life challenges (Egeland, Carlson & Stroufe, 1993; Masten, Best & Garmezy, 1990; Taylor, 
1983; Van Den Heuvel et al., 2010).   
This suggests that in addition to extrinsic mechanisms, organisations need to ensure that employees 
have the personal resources without which positive psychological outcomes may be undermined 
(Hobfoll, 2002 p.311) which can lead to stress and depression (Kobasa, 1979; Hobfoll, 1989; Holahan 
et al., 1999). Personal resources, such as those identified by Kahn include extrinsic non-work related 
resources such social support and family. However, the personal resources to which this study refers 
are the psychological resources an individual has available for Psychological Safety. 
1.4 This Research 
This research aims to address Psychological Safety from the perspective of the individual. To be able 
to leverage psychological resources to maintain ones Psychological Safety may help contribute to 
employee performance and resilience in VUCA environments. Given the increasing awareness in 
employee wellbeing and mental health in the workplace, this research could not be timelier. In 
understanding whether psychological resources can create the Psychological Safety necessary for 
both organisations in terms of innovation, creativity and performance as well as employee wellbeing, 
provides a new perspective on Psychological Safety as an individual as well as a group construct. This 
research does not aim to exonerate organisations from their responsibilities in providing a 
Psychological Safe environment. Indeed, organisations need to develop an environment that will 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  33 
create the willingness to employ the self at work. Perhaps it is the intrinsic psychological resources 
that determine the ability to do so. 
As this thesis will discuss, there are a plethora of proposed psychological resources and associated 
models in the literature. As the literature review in this study discusses, the focus for this research is 
on three psychological resource models.  
The first is the Psychological Capital model (Luthans & Church, 2002) created as part of the Positive 
Organisational Behaviour movement (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000) identifies four 
psychological resources needed for workplace performance: Hope, Optimism, Self-efficacy and 
Resilience. The research will evaluate this model, arguing that resilience is better positioned as an 
output of Hope, Optimism and Self-efficacy rather than input to the Psychological Capital model. 
Hypothesised to replace resilience in the Psychological Capital model is Cognitive Flexibility. Cognitive 
Flexibility is the ability to shift avenues of thought and action in order to perceive, process and 
respond to situations in different ways (Eslinger & Grattan, 1993, p.17).  This enables an awareness 
of new environments, the suppression of habitual or automatic responses and the creation of new 
thinking. Research suggests that those with cognitive flexibility are able to deal with complexity and 
ambiguity, finding novel solutions to the new problems organisations face. This ability is also 
associated with resilience to stress (Genet & Siemer, 2011). The Cognitive Flexibility model 
developed by Good (2009) identifies the cognitive resources needed for this: openness/mindfulness 
and attentional control. This study evaluates these as a key psychological resources for inclusion in 
the Psychological Capital Model.  
The final resource model is the Availability dimension of Kahns model. This includes cognitive and 
emotional resources, self-consciousness and outside support. 
In total, 10 psychological resources are studied initially in the context of Psychological Safety and 
eventually resilience.  
The research methodology is mixed method triangulation, using both qualitative and quantitative 
methods. Focus groups provide the validation of the hypothesis that the individual has a role to play 
in the creation of Psychological Safety. This is followed by two quantitative studies (one student, one 
employee) using the existing measures of the psychological resources and well known tests of 
divergent thinking and attentional control. Analysis on this data includes Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and regression analyses. Finally data from the focus 
groups and quantitative analysis is brought together in a longitudinal training study in which 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  34 
participants were tested before and 4-6 weeks after training from which both quantitative and 
qualitative data is drawn.  
The outputs of the methodology are discussed both generally and in terms of the implications for 
organisations and employees.

2. Literature Review  
2.1 Psychological Safety 
Psychological Safety is defined as being able to show and employ ones self without fear of negative 
consequences to self-image, status or career (Kahn, 1990 p.708). Psychological Safety is thought to 
be a necessary cognitive state for learning and adapting (Edmondson, 1999; Edmondson & Lei, 2014; 
Frazier et al., 2017) as when feeling safe from interpersonal risk (Edmondson, 1999 p.354) it is 
considered that employees are more likely to challenge, make mistakes or even fail without incurring 
negative consequences (Schien & Bennis, 1965). As such, Psychological Safety has been widely 
attributed to improved employee engagement (Kahn, 1990; May, Gilson & Harter, 2004), vitality 
(Dutton & Heaphy, 2003; Kark & Carmeli, 2009) and employee voice (Ashford, Rothbard, Piderit & 
Dutton, 1998; Detert & Burris 2007). Psychological Safety has also been associated with improved 
performance at employee, team and organisational levels. Employees who experience Psychological 
Safety have been shown to feel less anxious (Hackman & Oldham, 1976) and demonstrate increased 
creativity (Kark & Carmeli 2009; Bradley et al., 2012; Gong et al., 2012), decision making (Bradley et 
al., 2012) and proactivity (Gong et al., 2012). Team collaboration (Edmondson, 1999, 2014), 
information exchange (Gong et al., 2012, Frazier et al., 2017) and conflict mitigation (Bradley et al., 
2012; Carmeli, Tishler & Edmondson, 2012; Schaubrook, Lam & Peng, 2011; Tucker, Nembhard & 
Edmondson, 2007)  have also been shown to improve in environments where Psychological Safety is 
perceived as high.  At an organisational level a psychologically safe environment has been shown to 
be related to quality improvement (Nembhard & Edmondson, 2006) and increased acceptance of 
change (Schien & Bennis, 1965; Schien 1993). To survive todays uncertain and complex 
environments, such attributes are considered particularly relevant (Edmondson, 1999; Hall, Dollard & 
Coward, 2010; Edmondson, Higgins, Singer & Weiner, 2016). Research into the sources of 
Psychological Safety has primarily focused on organisational resources. Zinsser and Zinsser (2016) 
found in their qualitative research with staff of two pre-schools, organisational policies and practises 
can generate different degrees of psychological safety. Hackman and Oldhams Job Characteristics 
Theory (1976) proposes that the design of work can impact Psychological Safety, specifically the level 
of autonomy, role clarity and interdependence. Relationships with leaders provide employees with 
cues as to organisational norms (Kahn, 1990).  Consequently, research into the impact of leadership 
styles on Psychological Safety have included transformational leadership (Detert & Burris, 2007), 
ethical leadership (Walumbwa & Schaubroeck, 2009), servant leadership (e.g., Schaubroeck, Lam, & 
Peng, 2011), leadermember exchange (Coombe, 2010), leadership trust (e.g. Madjar & Ortiz-
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  36 
Walters, 2009). However, it is at the team level where most Psychological Safety research has 
focused, in particularly relationships between team members (Bstieler & Hemmert, 2010; Bunderson 
et al., 2010; Edmondson, 1999; Schepers et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2010).  Indeed, Psychological 
Safety has been described as a group-level phenomenon (Bradley et al., 2012; Edmondson & Lei 
2014; Idris et al., 2012; Parker et al., 2003), described by Edmondson as a shared beliefthat the 
team is safe for interpersonal risk taking (Edmondson, 1999 p.350). Furthermore, despite significant 
changes in organisation and team environments over the 20 years since the Edmondsons 
Psychological Safety questionnaire was devised, it remains the standard for the measurement of 
Psychological Safety.  (See Appendix A for summary of studies).   
However, in VUCA organisations, 
teams may not only be remote and 
virtual but temporary with fluid 
membership (Gibson & Gibbs, 2006; 
Faraj & Yan, 2009; Heerwagen et al., 
2016; Edmondson, 2017).  As a 
member of multiple teams, often 
with multiple reporting lines 
(Mohrman, 1999), employees may 
struggle to answer questions 
referring to a single team (see 
Edmondsons Psychological Safety 
Questionnaire: table 2.1). One of the 
fastest growing flexible working 
trends is that of working from home; 
between 2011 and 2018 the number 
of employees working from home had increased by 51% (CIPD, 2019c, p.14). Consequently, the 
increase in virtual teams has resulted in interactions between both colleagues and bosses being 
virtual and more perfunctory thanks to email, IM and texts resulting in less of a social connection 
(Mohrman, 1999; Cartwright, 2003). The traditional construct of a team has changed since the 
development of Edmondsons questionnaire.  
Furthermore Edmondsons questionnaire has been challenged around its approach in averaging 
scores across multiple team members to create a single score for team Psychological Safety which 
becomes sensitive to team size (Schepers et al.,  2008). If Psychological Safety is the extent to which 
one believes that another will give you the benefit of the doubt (Edmondson, 1990) and an 
Psychological Safety Questionnaire (Edmondson, 
1999) 
Scale: Strongly Disagree /Disagree/Neutral/ Agree /Strongly Agree 
1. When someone makes a mistake in this team, it is 
often held against him or her (R). 
2. In this team, it is easy to discuss difficult issues and 
problems. 
3. In this team, people are sometimes rejected for 
being different (R). 
4. It is completely safe to take a risk on this team. 
5. It is difficult to ask other members of this team for 
help (R). 
6. Members of this team value and respect each 
others' contributions.

individuals belief about how others will respond (Carmeli & Gittell, 2009) [author italics], it is an 
individuals perception that determines their Psychological Safety (Carmeli & Gittell 2009; Frazier et 
al., 2017; Kahn, 1990; Schein, 1993; Schein & Bennis, 1965). Although a team may share the same 
mechanisms to create Psychological Safety, research into cognitive schemas, suggest that each 
individual has their own program for decoding and interpreting external information in ways that are 
meaningful for them (Roussin, 2008; Walsh, 1995). Within the same team, members may have 
different levels of Psychological Safety.  This suggests that as well as being a team construct, 
Psychological Safety is also an individual construct. 
2.1.2 Psychological Safety at the Individual Level 
There is recognition that employee perceptions (Jones & James 1979; Schuler, 1975), emotional 
reactions (Lodahl, 1964) and psychological states (Hackman & Oldman, 1976, p.250) can impact 
employee performance. An extensive study by Jones and James (1979) involved measuring the 
characteristics of 4315 men from the US Navy. Based on previous research of psychologically 
meaningful measures of the work environment, 35 a priori composites were measured. These are 
shown grouped into four categories:  Job or Role, Leadership, Workgroup and Subsystem/ 
Organisation (see table 2.2).

A principal components analysis of the 35 a priori composites using varimax rotation led to a 5 factor 
solution. The resulting dimensions were labelled: 1) Conflict and Ambiguity, 2) Job challenge, 
importance & variety 3) Leader facilitation and support, 4) Workgroup co-operation, Friendship and 
Warmth 5) Professional and Organisational esprit de corp (Jones & James, 1979, pp.218-219). A 
comparison of these five dimensions with data from other samples: 398 firemen and 504 exempt 
employees of a private health care program (52% were women), confirmed these findings. This 
supported research both prior to and since the study on the elements of work on which perceptions 
of climate are based, namely: task and role characteristics (Bray & Brawley, 2002; Hackman & 
Oldham, 1976; Lawler & Hall, 1970), leadership (Hu et al.,  2018; Rao-Nicholson et al., 2016; Vroom & 
Mann, 1960), the team or workgroup (Brayfield & Crockett, 1955; Edmondson, 1999) and 
organisational operations (Burke & Litwin, 1992; Mann & Williams, 1962; Porter 1963). Thus there 
appears to be agreement as to what employees base their perceptions of climate on. However, all of 
these are extrinsic organisational mechanisms.  
Two measures of individual intrinsic mechanisms used by Jones and James (need for 
acceptance/approval and self-confidence/ability) were used in a correlation analysis with the five 
dimensions.  This showed that Ego needs correlated positively with Job Challenge, Importance and 
Variety and Professional esprit De corps. Self-esteem/confidence correlated with Job Challenge, 
importance and variety and Workgroup co-operation, friendship and warmth. No further analysis 
was reported therefore causal relationships between these variables are unknown. However, Jones 
and James recognised the role of the employee as both perceiver and cognitive processor (1979, 
p.20) of the psychological climate. 
Psychological Safety has been recognised as an intrapsychic state (Edmondson & Mogelof, 2006 
p.112); the individual has a role to play in the creation of their Psychological Safety, (Schein & Bennis, 
1965; Edmondson, 1999, 2006; Kahn, 1990; Schein, 1993; Carmeli & Gittell, 2009; Frazier et al., 
2017). Edmondson herself has called for more research into the impact of dispositional factors on 
psychological safety (Edmondson et al., 2016). Using the Costa & McCrae (1992) NEO Personality 
Inventory, Edmondson & Mogelof (2006) researched the relationship of personality with 
Psychological Safety.  Twenty-six project teams (N=228) involved in innovative work were measured 
daily on the NEO Personality Inventory and at the beginning, mid-point and end of their projects for 
Psychological Safety. No significant differences in means for Psychological Safety were found 
between t1, t2 or t3.  Extraversion was shown not to be a predictor of Psychological Safety. At the 
mid and end-points of the study, Openness positively predicted Psychological Safety and Neuroticism 
negatively predicted Psychological Safety (see table 2.3).  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  39 
Although the greatest correlation with Psychological Safety in this study was Team Interaction 
(t1=r.55 p<.01; t2, r=.44, p<.01) these results might suggest that the personality elements of 
Openness and Neuroticism may influence the level of Psychological Safety. However, the measure of 
Psychological Safety used in 
this study was the 
Encouragement items 
from the KEYS survey tool, 
designed to assess 
organisational climate for 
creativity (Amabile et al., 
1996). As discussed above, 
most Psychological Safety studies use Edmondsons questionnaire.  Therefore the results in this 
study should be treated with caution as to whether the same construct is being measured.  
Furthermore, the teams were measured at the beginning, mid and end point of their projects. 
However, as the projects were between 6 weeks and 10 months long, measures were taken at 
different intervals.  Teams also varied in size from 3  20 people. As measures were aggregated to 
create team level results, the variances in team size may impact results.  
To date, there has been little further research into the intrinsic mechanisms within the individual that 
contribute to Psychological Safety. Work by Kahn (1990) acknowledged the role of both 
organisational mechanisms and individual resources in creating the environment that shape the 
processes of people presenting and absenting their selves at work (Kahn, 1990 p.694). These he 
called the psychological dimensions of engagement (see table 2.4).   
Kahns (1990) studies were qualitative, beginning with studies of 16 counsellors at a summer camp, 
average age 25.5 years, 9 men and 7 women.  The second study was with 16 employees of an 
architecture firm, average age 34.3 years, 10 men, and 6 women. Data collection was in the form of 
observation, document analysis and 40-90 minute in-depth interviews that were recorded. In 
particular, Kahn asked participants to recall situations where they had felt:(1) attentive, absorbed, 
or involved in their work, (2) uninvolved, detached, or distracted from their work, (3) differences 
between how they responded to a work situation and how they would have responded if they had 
not been at work, and (4) no differences from non-work behaviour to how they reacted to a work-
related situation (1990, p.698).

Table 2.4 Kahns Dimensions of Psychological Conditions (1990, pp705) 
In total, Kahn gathered 186 unique experiences. Analysis involved identifying moments of personal 
engagement and disengagement and categorising them.  Although this study was small and 
exclusively from white, middle class participants, Kahns identified three dimensions of engagement, 
each of which reflects extant research.  
1. Meaningfulness whereby there is a sense of return on investments of self in role 
performance (1990, p.703). This reflected task and role characteristics as well as 
interactions at work that generated a sense of it being worthwhile. This dimension reflects 
the work of Hackman and Oldham (1974, 1976) whereby the design of the job is critical to 
motivation.  
2. Safety, i.e. Psychological Safety. Hackman and Oldham recognised the importance of 
psychological states (1976, p.256) on work performance, however Kahn provides details as 
to how this can be achieved: through interpersonal relationships, group and inter-group 
dynamics, management style and organisational norms. Edmondsons (1990) work on 
Psychological Safety as a team construct reflects this. 
3. Availability  Kahn identified that individuals need a sense of possessing the physical, 
emotional and psychological resources (1990 p.714) needed to be able to fully engage at 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  41 
work. The demands on individuals both in and out of work impacted their physical energy, 
emotional energy, levels of insecurity (about themselves) and outside life. This recognises 
that an individuals intrinsic resources have a role to play in performance and in doing so 
reflects extant resource models. 
Hackman and Oldmans (1976) resource model, the Job Demand-Resources (JD-R) model, focuses on 
the role of job-related resources such as participation, job security, rewards, feedback and supervisor 
support in mitigating the stress and reduced energy levels that the demands of a job can bring,  such 
as work overload. They define resources as aspects of the job (Demerouti, Bakker, Nachreiner, 
Schaufeli, 2001a p.501). The provision of sufficient job-related resources has been found to be 
motivational (Hackman & Oldman, 1976) as through these employees achieve the psychological 
states of meaning, accountability and satisfaction through their performance.  
Bakker, Demerouti and Euwema (2005), in their study to determine the resources that can prevent 
burnout, 1012 employees of a Dutch Education institution completed questionnaires on burnout, job 
demands and the job resources of autonomy, social support, relationship with supervisor and 
performance feedback. Those employees that reported having high job demands and low resources 
had the highest levels of fatigue and demoralization.   Similarly, Demerouti et al. (2001b) found that 
the absence of job resources correlated with disengagement. 
However, the JD-R model was developed using jobs that were carried out individually and did not 
address group working or any interpersonal or situational moderators.  The job characteristics 
required to create positive psychological states when there is a team, or indeed multiple teams, 
involved in the execution of a task may be different. Furthermore, although Hackman and Oldman 
recognised a role for individual intrinsic resources, the model focuses on the provision of extrinsic 
resources to counteract job demands. Such resources are reflected in Kahns Meaningfulness and 
Psychological Safety Dimensions.  
And yet not all resources have equal value.  As Hobfoll (1989, 2002) recognises, a resource is that 
which is valued by the individual or that serve as a means for attainment (1989 p.516).  What one 
person values, another may not. For example job security has been found to be a more valuable 
resource to older employees than younger ones (Cheng & Chan, 2008). Merely deploying extrinsic 
resources is not necessarily sufficient to have the desired effect of engagement, performance or 
Psychological Safety. It is how individuals perceive and appraise these external resources that will 
determine their effects (Jones & James, 1979; Xanthopoulou et al., 2007).  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  42 
This paper does not suggest that the external organisational mechanisms are not important in the 
creation of Psychological Safety.  However, for employees to rely only on external Psychological 
Safety mechanisms places the responsibility of Psychological Safety solely on the organisation, 
potentially positioning the employee in a passive, and in todays climate, precarious position. Many 
of the traditional antecedents to Psychological Safety such as work design characteristics and group 
dynamics (Kahn, 1990; Frazier et al., 2017) have changed. Todays teams are more permeable 
(Faraj & Yan 2009 p.605), and virtual (Gibson & Gibbs, 2006) with blurred boundaries (Heerwagen et 
al., 2016). The ability to answer Edmondsons Team Psychological Safety questionnaire with one 
simple answer becomes almost impossible given that employees are now members of multiple and 
changing teams (Mohrman, Cohen & Mohrman, 1995; Faraj & Yan, 2009).    
If Psychological Safety is a construct at organisational, group and the individual level (Kahn 1990; 
Baer & Frese, 2003; Hudson, 2004; Gong et al.,2012), the Meaningfulness and Safety dimensions of 
Kahns model point to the organisational and group level extrinsic resources that create an 
environment in which an employee would be willing to show and employ self at work. Perhaps it is 
the Availability dimension that identifies the individuals own internal psychological resources that 
provide the cognitive capacity to perceive and appraise these external resources positively. To what 
extent is Psychological Safety determined by intrinsic psychological resources: perceptions, 
characteristics, filters and circumstances (Baer & Frese, 2003; Carmeli & Gittel, 2009). And if 
psychological resources are important, is the Availability dimension of Kahns model able to 
determine whether an employee is not just willing but able to show and employ self (1990, p.708) 
fully at work? 
2.1.3 Psychological Resources 
The Availability dimension of Kahns model refers to the physical, emotional and psychological 
resources (Kahn, 1990, p.705) needed to be able to fully engage in work. Psychological resources 
are contained within the self and are what people draw upon to help them withstand threats posed 
by events and objects in their environment (Pearlin & Schooler, 1978, p.5). 
Spanning various industries such as healthcare, clinical psychology, social care, and education, 
resource models such as the Transactional Stress model (Lazarus & Folkman, 1987), the Conservation 
of Resources model (Hobfoll, 1989) and the Job Demand - Resources model (Bakker & Demerouti, 
2007) all refer to the importance of personal resources in dealing with stressful situations in order to 
maintain mental wellbeing.  Appendix B provides a summary of key resource theories.   
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  43 
Despite the sheer number of differing resource theories there is general agreement that personal 
resources enable individuals to cope with situations that are perceived as adverse, threatening or 
challenging (Luthans et al., 2010; Pearlin & Shooler, 1978; Van den Heuvel et al., 2010). Furthermore, 
there appears to be consensus that excessive demands deplete personal resources thereby reducing 
the ability to manage lifes demands (Baumeister et al., 1998; Hobfoll, 2002; Holahan et al., 1999; 
Keinan et al., 1999; King et al., 1999; Norris & Kaniasty, 1996). However how excessive demands 
deplete resources is much debated. 
One school of thought suggests that we have finite resources (Baumeister, Muraven & Tice, 2000; 
Muraven & Baumeister, 2000; Muraven, Shmueli & Burkley, 2006) therefore excessive demands on 
our resources will lead to their depletion, known as ego depletion (Baumeister et al., 1998; Hobfoll, 
2002; Hobfoll et al., 2003; Holahan et al., 1999; Keinan et al., 1999; King et al., 1999; Norris & 
Kaniasty, 1996).  
However, this strength model, is not without its challengers. Job, Dweck and Walton refer to this as a 
limited resource theory (2010, p.1687) demonstrating in 3 studies on college students (N=183) that 
those who had a non-limited resource mind-set displayed less evidence of ego-depletion. Students 
were measure on their belief about resources using six questions such as After a strenuous mental 
activity your energy is depleted and you must rest to get it refuelled again (limited-resource theory) 
and Your mental stamina fuels itself; even after strenuous mental exertion you can continue doing 
more of it (non- limited-resource theory) (2010, p.1687). Ego depletion was also measured using the 
Stroop Test, identifying all the es in a document and 8 challenging IQ questions respectively. 
Findings indicated that (self-control) willpower was able to moderate ego depletion. A subsequent 
longitudinal study with university students (N=41) to measure the ability to self-regulate during times 
of stress using three time points during a term: the first at the start of term in April, the second in 
May and the last in June during final exam week. Self-control or regulation has been used for 
experiments in this field as this requires effort thereby placing increased demands on psychological 
resources. However, this is an indirect measure of resource capacity (Hagger, 2010). Self-regulation 
was measured by consumption of unhealthy food, procrastination instead of studying and personal 
goal striving. Analyses revealed that a limited-resource theory mind-set at time 2 predicted worse 
self-regulation on all three measures at the stressful time point, time 3; consumption of unhealthy 
food,  procrastination rather than studying and self-regulation with respect to personal goal striving. 
Together, these results suggest that ego-depletion may be a result of a belief about whether 
resources are finite or not.  Of course, what the study does not reveal is whether the belief about 
whether you have limited resources depends on the amount of psychological resources you have at 
the time. Perhaps a limited-resource mind-set is a result of ego depletion in itself.  Furthermore, it is 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  44 
possible that those with a non-limited mind-set feel fatigue and experience ego-depletion, but either 
dont notice or react to it while those who have a limiting mind-set, heed the ego depletion and 
choose to preserve their energies (Francis & Job, 2018).  
Research has also posited that the extent to which we can exercise self-control is not a product of 
the amount of psychological resources available but of how the brain allocates glucose (Beedie & 
Lane, 2012), in particular for cognitive processes that are effortful (Gailliot et al., 2007).  In one 
research study, glucose levels were measured in 110 students before and after watching a video. In 
this study, half the participants were asked to focus their attention on a specific aspect of the video 
(attentional control group) and half were instructed to watch the video normally (control group). 
Blood glucose levels were significantly lower for the attentional control group after watching the 
video than before watching the video.  For the control group, glucose levels were not statistically 
significantly different before and after the video viewing.  Other experiments which measured 
whether cognitive efforts decrease glucose levels have had mixed results (Inzlicht, Schmeichel & 
McCrae, 2014; Kurzban, 2010; Molden et al., 2012) with some researchers concluding that ego-
depletion is not energy dependant. 
For example, Inzlicht, Schmeichel and McCrae (2014) argue that from an evolutionary perspective, 
being able to apply self-control to manage hard-wired responses such as fear, in order to eat, to find 
shelter, to procreate etc. is an advantage. Having a limit to this capacity therefore would threaten 
survival. They explain ego depletion in the context of motivation and attention. In this model, the 
apparent loss of energy after self-control tasks is the result of changes in motivational priorities. 
Muraven & Slessareva (2003) found that incentivising performance by adding a financial reward for 
performance resulted in greater self-control despite resources having depleted in a previous task. 
In one experiment students were asked to suppress their emotional responses whilst watching a 
funny video. They were then required to drink a bitter tasking beverage as a further test of their 
motivation. When students were well paid for this task, they drank more of the bitter tasting drink 
that the group who were not paid, and the same amount as those in a group which was well paid but 
had no depletion task. This study demonstrated that providing a motivator enabled those who were 
depleted to perform as well those who werent.  Inzlicht et al., (2014) consider depletion as 
indicating that motivation, emotion and attention are reduced for have to tasks and increased for 
want to tasks. An example of this would be after physical activity, when motivation moves from 
exercise to rest. Fatigue they argue is less about low energy and rather a signal to change ones 
activities. Baumeister et al., (2016, 2018) challenge this, arguing that the motivation/attention theory 
rests on the assumption that it is beneficial to disengage from have-to activities in favour of want-to 
ones.  This, they argue, would be counterproductive if not dangerous.  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  45 
Despite the conflicting theories, a meta-analysis of 83 experiments with 198 tests of ego-depletion by 
Hagger (2010) found some commonalities across experiments. Specifically the analysis showed that 
the more complex the task, the more cognitive processes were required leading to greater ego-
depletion (as measured by self-control). This suggests that, while self-control draws from a single, 
common psychological resource, task performance is also impacted by perceptions of fatigue, 
difficulty and effort required. Incentives can therefore reduce the impact of ego-depletion on self-
control. Hagger (2010) argues that Baumeister et al.,s (2000) Strength Model, Job et al.,s (2010) 
Limited Resource Model and Inzlicht et al.,s (2012) motivational model may be reconcilable, 
however until a more objective measure of ego-depletion is found, alternative hypotheses will 
continue to exist.  
It is not within the scope of this thesis to conclude this debate, but rather to examine particular 
psychological resources in the context of Psychological Safety.  
There are many suggestions as to which psychological resources are important in managing and 
engaging with the challenges of our environment. These include: personal hardiness (King et al., 
1999; Kobasa, 1979), control (Cozzarelli, 1993;  Judge et al.,  2005; Kobasa, 1979; Maier & Seligman, 
1976; Taylor, 1983), self-esteem (Cozzarelli, 1993;  Rini et al., 1999; Rosenberg, 1965; Stajkovic, 2006; 
Taylor, 1983; Thoits, 1995), creativity and wisdom, (Luthans & Youssef, 2007c ; Seligman & Steen, 
2005), humour, (Carver et al., 1993; Luthans & Youssef, 2007; Seligman & Steen, 2005), authenticity 
(Luthans, Youssef & Avolio, 2007b), EQ, (Luthans & Youssef 2007c; Seligman & Steen, 2000), 
optimism (Carver, Scheier & Segerstrom, 2010; Peterson 2000) and courage (Luthans & Youssef 
2007c). This suggests that there are multiple resources available from which individuals can draw to 
help them cope with environmental challenges. However, research supporting the possible benefits 
of specific personal resources is not always consistent.  
One challenge results from the difficulty in defining personal resources. For example, although social 
support has been cited as a personal resource (Cohen & Hoberman, 1983; Holahan et al., 1999; King 
et al., 1999; Norris & Kaniasty 1996; Sarason, Sarason & Shearin, 1986; Thoits, 1995) what constitutes 
social support is debated. In particular, social support has been differentiated by the perception that 
individuals have of the social support available versus the actual support they receive (Barrera, 1986; 
Cohen & Hoberman, 1983; Lakey & Bennett-Cassady, 1990). Indeed, Barrera (1986) argues that 
social support is a complex process and therefore the researchers need to consider carefully which 
aspect of social support they wish to measure. 
A further challenge relates to how psychological resources should be measured.  An example of this 
comes from research by Makikangas and Kinnunens (2003) into the role of optimism in moderating 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  46 
work stressors amongst 457 employed individuals in Finland.  Using the six item LOT scale (Scheier, 
Carver & Bridges, 1994) they found a significant negative relationship between optimism and the 
work stressors of time pressures, lack of control and organisational climate was found. However,  
Xanthopoulou, Bakker, Demerouti & Shaufeli (2007) also used the LOT to measure optimism,  
combined with a  range of other personal resources including self-efficacy, organisational based self-
esteem and optimism found that these measures did not moderate the perceptions of job demands 
but did mediate between job resources and exhaustion or engagement.  
The challenge in understanding personal resources is in the variety of resources that might be tested, 
their definitions, the difference in measurements and how data is analysed. It is also not clear 
whether there is overlap between some personal resources. For example, Smith et al. (1989) in their 
study with 156 undergraduate students, argued that optimism was contaminated with neuroticism 
(p.646). However, in a larger study of 4309 undergraduate students, Scheier, Carver & Bridges (1994) 
found that optimism accounted for a smaller variance than in the Smith et al. (1989) study.  
There is however, some consensus in the literature over the main psychological resources needed to 
enable individuals to deal with lifes stresses. These are Meaningfulness, Self-Efficacy/Mastery and a 
Positive Outlook.  The research supporting these three resources is discussed below. 
2.1.3.1 Meaningfulness 
Meaningfulness or purpose (Baumeister & Vohs, 2002; Kobasa, 1979; Taylor, 1983) is 
considered a key resource in maintaining a sense of stability (Bauermeister & Vohs, 2002). A 
qualitative study by Taylor (1983) investigated how 78 women with breast cancer adjusted to 
this life-threatening event. One important factor was found to be their search for meaning: 
their need to understand why they developed cancer, or a way to attribute their cancer to 
specific causes. The hypothesised causes provided by the women were not correlated with 
adjustment. Nor did any specific attributional explanations contribute more to adjustment or 
acceptance than another. The cognitive processes involved in finding meaning were shown to 
aid adaptation and coping. As a comparison, Taylor interviewed the spouses of cancer suffers. 
This group were significantly less likely to provide causal attributions for the cancer although 
affected by their partners cancer.  
Meaning becomes a narrative that we construct, using our filters, cognitive schemas and past 
experiences (Singer, 2004). And herein lies the challenge in measuring meaningfulness; it is a 
subjective measure (CIPD, 2019b) and definitions vary.  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  47 
Further attempts have been made to measure meaning in the context of the workplace. 
Kobasa (1979) studied 86 high stress/low illness executives and 75 high stress/high illness 
executives in order to understand the characteristics that create hardiness. Those with high 
stress but low illness demonstrated a sense of meaningfulness (as opposed to nihilism) as 
measured by the Nihilism versus Meaningfulness scale in the Alienation Test (Maddi, Hoover & 
Kobasa, 1982).  While this scale measures cognitive control, Kobasa equated this with the 
ability to find meaning in stressful life events (1979, p.5). Others have used a more job-related 
approach such as Hackman and Oldhams Job Diagnostic Survey (1974: see Appendix C), 
defines meaningfulness as task significance.  The Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire used 
by James and James (1989) measures job satisfaction and job importance. In recent research 
into workplace trends, the CIPD define meaningful works as having a sense of pride and 
achievement at a job well done (CIPD, 2019b p.28).  However, there are only a handful of 
published measures of meaningful work (Steger, Dik & Duffy, 2012). Even fewer exist in the 
context of Psychological Safety.  
Brown and Leigh (1996), created their own measures of Psychological Safety and 
Meaningfulness in order to determine how these factors contributed to job involvement, 
effort and performance. In two studies of employees (N=147 and N= 161) across 3 companies, 
Psychological Safety was measured using 5 questions on Supportive Management, 3 questions 
on Clarity and 4 questions on Self Expression. For meaningfulness, 4 questions concerning 
contribution, 3 questions about recognition and 2 questions about job challenge were created. 
Analysis performed at individual variable levels rather than at Psychological Safety and 
Meaningful level 
demonstrated that all 
variables were 
correlated (see table 
2.5 for correlations). A 
confirmatory factor 
analysis was used to 
model the contribution 
of each of these 
variables to the higher 
order factor of Psychological Climate.  The model indicated that each Psychological Safety and 
Meaningfulness dimension had a statistically significant path to Psychological Climate (see 
Table 2.5 Correlation between Meaningfulness and 
Psychological Safety (Brown & Leigh, 1996) 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  48 
figure 2.1). Although this work began to 
operationalise Kahns theoretical model, it 
provided little clarity as to the relationship 
between Psychological Safety and 
Meaningfulness.  
One assumption of these measures is that 
meaning is related to the characteristics of the 
job, however this does not necessarily hold 
(Arnold et al., 2007). Piccolo and Colquitts 
(2006) research into the job characteristics 
needed for organisational citizenship 
behaviours with 217 employees and their 
supervisors, found that it was relationships 
with inspiring, intelligence and influential 
leaders that created meaning, more than the perceived characteristics of the job. More recent 
definitions and measures of meaning have focused on meaning as a construct: Martelas 
(2018) study defines meaning as having three components: significance, self-realisation and 
broader purpose. This is reflected in Steger et al.,s (2012) Work as Meaning Inventory. Using 
370 employees from a research university, Steger et al., (2012) developed the measure to 
move beyond job specific elements. They considered three factors: Positive meaning, Meaning 
Making through Work and Greater Good Motivations (see table 2.6). Using confirmatory factor 
analysis, the resulting 10 
item questionnaire 
achieved a significant good 
 Ashmos and Duchons 
(2000) Workplace 
Spirituality scale was 
developed using 696 
employees of four US 
hospital systems. The 66 
survey questions loaded on six factors of: conditions of community, meaning at work, inner 
life, blocks to spirituality (in the workplace), personal responsibility and positive connections 
with other individuals. However, the challenge with such measures is that without measuring

factor of Meaningfulness and Psychological Safety 
(Brown & Leigh, 1990. p.364). 
Table 2.6 Items from the Work as Meaning Inventory (WAMI) and Factor 
Loadings (Steger, Dik, & Duffy (2012)

workplace performance, it is difficult to quantitatively measure the bottom line benefit of 
meaningfulness at work.   
There is much to suggest that meaning is a key psychological resource to deal with life and 
work stresses.  An international study of 15000 employees across 8 countries in the early 
1980s indicated that work ranked either the most, or second most important aspect of the 
respondents life (Harpaz & Fu, 2002). Those who said their work was meaningful and/or 
served some greater social or communal good report better psychological adjustment and 
well-being (Arnold, et al., 2007). 
Perceiving ones work to be meaningful or purposeful and to serve a higher purpose are key. 
The CIPD argue that those who find their work meaningful have higher well-being (CIPD, 2016) 
and that this is therefore critical for future job design (CIPD, 2015).  
2.1.3.2 Mastery/Self-efficacy 
Unlike meaningfulness, there is a significant body of research on self-efficacy. This has been 
defined as a belief in ones belief in ones capability. Mastery and Self-Efficacy have been 
demonstrated to be key to coping (Pearlin & Schooler, 1978; Thoits, 1995), stress and 
psychological adaptation (Rini et al., 1999; Thoits, 1995) and exercising control (Bandura, 1997) 
In one study, Judge, Locke and Durham (1998) expanded Banduras model of task specific self-
efficacy to create a new 10 point generalised self-efficacy scale: this was thought to measure 
core self-evaluations (CSE) of the perceptions of an individuals ability to cope with life.  Their 
study of 3 sample groups and their significant others: 165 Doctors and their significant others, 
158 Business college graduates and 132 Israeli students and their significant others showed 
that self-efficacy correlate significantly and positively with life satisfaction. The four 
component CSE model was tested using CFA and showed positive relationships with job and 
life satisfaction for all groups.  
Given that Psychological Safety has been considered primarily a team construct, research 
investigating the relationship between individual self-efficacy (SE) and Psychological Safety has 
been scarce.  Work by Roussin et al. (2018) with 129 nurses and physicians in a hospital in 
Spain used Edmondsons Psychological Safety questionnaire,  the Occupational Self-Efficacy 
scale and a self-measure of participative performance to investigate the relationship between 
Psychological Safety and self-efficacy (Schyns & Von Collani, 2002). Using a regression analysis 
they found that Psychological Safety was a strong predictor of speaking up when colleagues 
made a mistake, with self-efficacy contributing little to the regression analysis. In contrast, 
Psychological Safety accounted for 19% of the variance, in a measure of when speaking up if 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  50 
unclear about something and self-efficacy added a further 11% to this variance. This provides 
an interesting perspective, suggesting that self-efficacy may only affect employee voice in 
particular types of scenarios for speaking up. However, this study measured hypothetical 
responses to scenarios.  This should be treated with caution as there is debate as to whether 
hypothetical scenarios provide accurate representation of actual intent  
The presence of strong employee voice, or the willingness to speak up infers that the 
individual feels psychologically safe enough to voice their opinions (Avey, Wernsing & Palanski, 
2012).  In their study into ethical leadership and employee voice, Wang et al. (2015) 
demonstrated that Self Efficacy was significantly related to Employee Voice.  An interesting 
study tested the hypothesis that managers with low self-efficacy would not solicit or 
implement the outputs of employee voice (Fast, Burris & Bartel, 2014).The five-point 
Solicitation of Voice scale and a measure of perceived self-efficacy (Chen, Gully & Eden, 2001) 
was used to assess managerial efficacy.  Results showed that managerial self-efficacy was 
positively related to solicitation of employee voice. The role of the leader has been recognised 
as being a key element in team Psychological Safety (Detert & Burris, 2007;  Edmondson et al., 
2016; Schaubrook, Lam & Peng, 2011), however this study suggests why leaders may resist 
employee voice and how the leaders own self-view can impact individuals Psychological Safety.  
A further study particularly relevant for todays uncertain environments tested 78 employees 
on a measure of self-efficacy, role ambiguity and levels of stress (Thompson & Gomez, 2014). 
Results indicated that self-efficacy moderates the relationship between role ambiguity and 
levels of stress. 
Although research investigating the specific relationship between self-efficacy and 
Psychological Safety is limited, there is research which suggests that self-efficacy is a key 
personal resource for dealing with either life or work challenges. One explanation for the 
current findings is that self-efficacy may contribute to Psychological Safety by moderating the 
environmental uncertainties, encouraging leaders to listen to others and creating job 
satisfaction. However, in these studies there is a lack of consistency around the measurement 
of self-efficacy which will be further discussed in this thesis.  
 2.1.3.3 Optimism  
Having a positive outlook has been cited as being key to dealing with lifes stresses. The belief 
that good things will happen is referred to as optimism (Carver & Scheier 1990, 2002; 
Cozzarelli 1993; Rini et al., 1999) and has been linked to happiness, perseverance, achievement 
and health (Cozzarelli, 1993; Peterson, 2000; Segerstrom et al., 1998; Snyder et al., 2001; 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  51 
Taylor et al., 2000).  However, to date, there have been no studies specifically exploring the 
role of optimism in Psychological Safety. Once again most likely this is due to Psychological 
Safety having been seen as a team construct.  
Research has been presented to suggest that meaningfulness, self-efficacy and optimism may be 
important resources for Psychological Safety. The construct of meaningfulness in this study is that 
defined by Kahn (1990) and used by May et al., (2004) measuring extrinsic mechanisms of 
meaningfulness such as task importance and supervisor relations. This research aims to determine 
the relationship (if any) between an individuals intrinsic psychological resources and Psychological 
Safety. Thus the focus will be on intrinsic resources such as self-efficacy and optimism.  Kahns s 
model defines psychological resources in his Availability Dimension, which has four categories: 
1. Physical Energies: Existing levels of physical resources available for investment into role 
performances.  
Kahn identifies the need to have the physical energy to carry out your role. His initial research 
demonstrating this was based on physically demanding roles, but later research with office 
based employees suggested that physical exhaustion could be present as a result of long hours. 
Rest and sleep have shown to restore personal resources (Barnes et al., 2011; Baumeister, 
Muraven & Tice, 2000; Zohar et al., 2005). Without sufficient sleep or rest, energy and 
emotional resources are depleted, therefore reducing their availability when dealing with 
challenge or adversity (Zohar et al., 2005). 
2. Emotional Energies: Existing levels of emotional resources available for investment into role 
performances. 
In emotionally charged situations expressing or suppressing emotions at work requires the 
deployment of cognitive resources (Xanthopoulou, Bakker & Fischbach, 2013). The Conservation 
of Resources model (Hobfoll, 1989) and the Job Demand-Resource model (Bakker, 2011) suggest 
that having plentiful cognitive resources would enable better management of emotional 
resources. 
3. Insecurities: Levels of confidence in own abilities and status, self-consciousness and 
ambivalence about fit with social systems that leave more or less room for investment of self in 
role performances 
Kahn noted that employees who felt insecure did not engage fully in the workplace. Insecurities 
about their self led to inner debates that resulted in little room for engagement in external 
activities (Kahn, 1990, p.716).  Psychological resources were spent on concerns about being 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  52 
judged, their abilities, their status, their role or managing values dissonance. The management, 
suppression or avoidance of such self-talk or negative automatic thoughts have been shown to 
deplete available cognitive resources (Baumeister et al., 1998; Mikulincer, Dolev & Shaver, 
2004). 
4. Outside life: Issues in peoples outside lives that leave them more or less available for 
investments of self during role performances. 
Having a perceived social support network has been found to be a coping resource through the 
provision of emotional or experiential support (Carmeli, 2007; Sarason, Sarason & Pierce, 1990; 
Thoits, 1995; Werner, 1993). However, more recently, research has produced data to suggest 
that social support had no modifying effect on workplace stress (Vammen et al., 2019) or 
emotional demands (Huynh, Xanthopoulou & Winefield, 2013).  
The rise of the Positive Organisational Behaviour movement has resulted in further research into the 
psychological resources required for performance in the workplace (Bakker et al., 2005, 2008; 
Luthans et al., 2007c, 2010; Luthans, Avey & Patera, 2008a; Luthans & Avolio, 2009a; Peterson et al., 
2011).  Historically,  research on intrinsic psychological resources was focused on dysfunctional 
human behaviour: thus personal coping resources were framed in the context of psychiatric 
symptoms (Wheaton, 1983); internal resources in the context of schizophrenia (Kohn, 1972); 
generalised resistance resources in the context of health and disease, later referred to as sense of 
coherence (Antonovsky, 1993); resources for cognitive adaptation in the context of health (Taylor, 
1983); psychological resources  in the context of physical health (Taylor et al., 2000)  and personality 
characteristics as coping resources for stress (Aldwin, Sutton & Lackman, 1996).  In the organisational 
context, this would suggest that researchers are attempting to find new ways to improve people, by 
finding the faults in and shortcomings of performance (Luthans et al., 2007a; Seligman & 
Csikszentmihalyi, 2000; Sheldon & King, 2001).  The Positive Organisational Behaviour (POB) 
movement looked to change this by moving away from repairing the worst things in life to also 
building positive qualities (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000, p.5). POB has been defined as the 
study and application of positively oriented human resource strengths and psychological capacities 
that can be measured, developed, and effectively managed for performance improvement in todays 
workplaces (Luthans, 2002 p.698). It aimed to study the positive traits and characteristics of 
managers and employees, to shift some of the organisational emphasis from some of the worst 
things in life, to the best things in life (Luthans & Church, 2002 p.58). In doing so, this aims to 
enable both the individual and organisations to thrive and prosper (Luthans & Church, 2002 p.58). 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  53 
In order to operationalise this, Luthans (2002) identified the positive psychological capacities (p.59) 
required of employees, creating the construct of Positive Psychological Capital.  
2.2 Positive Psychological Capital  
2.2.1 The Origins of Psychological Capital 
The psychological capacities to which Luthans refers are also referenced as capabilities (Luthans, 
2002 p.699), positive capacities (Luthans, Youssef & Avolio, 2007b, p.6),   psychological resources 
(Avey, Luthans & Youssef, 2010 p.431; Wang et al., 2017,p.4) constructs (Luthans et al., 2007a, 
p.542; Peterson & Luthans, 2003, p.26)  positive concepts (Luthans & Jensen, 2002, p.304)  
positive states (Luthans et al., 2005, p.249), factors (Luthans et al., 2006a, p.388) and psychic 
resources (Hmieleski & Carr, 2007 p.1). For the purpose of this thesis, these will be referred to a 
Psychological Resources.  
The process by which Luthans and Church (2002) selected the final Psychological Capital resources is 
not documented. Of the 61 articles published by Luthans and colleagues between February 2002 and 
January 2020 on the topic Psychological Capital, its four components are presented as a fait 
accompli.  Youssef-Morgan (2014) states that the final components were drawn from the positive 
psychology literature, the principles of which are to focus on the positive qualities than make life 
worth living (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000, p.5). Organisational behaviour theories and 
practises often stem from psychological research on human failings and weaknesses with a view to 
fixing the dysfunctional.  Positive Psychology looks to understand the strengths that enable 
performance, growth and achievement.  
In identifying the psychological resources for employee performance, Luthans was keen to ensure 
that their characteristics should be applicable and relevant for organisations, meeting specific 
criteria. These criteria were: 
 The psychological resources should reflect the Positive Organisational Behaviour movement 
by reflecting positive states (Luthans et al., 2013). Indeed, this criterion has been used 
synonymously with positivity (Luthans, Youssef & Avolio, 2007b; Story et al., 2013). 
 The psychological resources needed to be grounded in theory with valid measurement and 
discriminant validity. 
 Importantly they needed to be related to performance improvement, and therefore be 
state-like to enable continued development (Luthans, 2002).  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  54 
 The psychological resources should be relatively unique to the field of organisational 
behaviour (Luthans, 2002, p.699; Luthans, Youssef & Avolio, 2007b, p.11).  This is defined by 
Youssef-Morgan (2014) as ensuring the psychological resources identified were work-related 
and set within a positivist paradigm, with an emphasis on tangible results and quantifiable 
performance outcomes (p.132).  
 Early work on Positive Organisational Behaviour identified the resources that were considered 
appropriate to meet the selection criteria. These included Confidence (or Self-Efficacy), Hope, 
Optimism, Subjective Wellbeing and Emotional Intelligence (Luthans & Church, 2002). However, by 
2004 Subjective Wellbeing and 
Emotional Intelligence had been 
replaced with resilience. Although 
Luthans and Church (2002) argued 
that emotional intelligence had 
problems with measurement (p.70) 
no explanation for the replacement 
of Subjective Wellbeing was given. 
Ultimately it was concluded that the 
resources that best meet the POB 
criteria and are currently most 
relevant and can be most readily 
managed for competitive advantage 
(Luthans & Youssef, 2004 p.154) 
were hope, optimism, self-efficacy 
and resilience. In their book of 2007, 
Luthans et al., consider a further 5 
resources for possible inclusion in the 
model and a further 6 for possible 
future inclusion (see table 2.7). 
However in the most recent studies 
using Psychological Capital,  the 
original four resources of Hope, 
Optimism, Self-Efficacy and Resilience are used (Chatterjee & Mohanty, 2020; Gu, Tang & Wang, 
2019; Miao et al., 2020; Morgan, Parker & Roberts, 2019; Sun & Huang, 2019).

2.2.2 The Components of Psychological Capital 
These four unique and yet associated constructs (Avey et al., 2011) together created the higher order 
construct of Psychological Capital (Luthans, 2002; Luthans & Youssef, 2004; Luthans, Youssef, & 
Avolio, 2007b). The following section will review each of these resources individually. 
2.2.2.1 Optimism  
Based on the work of Scheier & Carver (1985), optimism refers to an individuals 
expectations and beliefs about outcomes. Optimism is the belief that good, rather than 
bad things will happen and that things will go your way (Scheier & Carver, 1985, p.219). 
Considered to reflect a belief about the nature of the world (Rotter, 1966 p.10) optimism 
was thought to be a general, trait-like concept referred to as dispositional optimism 
(Scheier & Carver, 1985, 1992).   
Optimism has been linked to happiness, perseverance, achievement and health (Cozzarelli, 
1993; Peterson, 2000; Segerstrom et al., 1998; Seligman, 1998; Snyder, Sympson & Michael, 
2001; Taylor et al., 2000). Indeed, early studies into optimism focused on its role on both 
physical and mental health outcomes (Fibel & Hale, 1978; Mulkhana & Hailey, 2001; Scheier 
& Carver, 1985; Tiger, 1995). Building on research around expectancy for success (Fibel & 
Hale, 1978; Phares, 1957; Rotter, 1966) Scheier and Carver explored the effects of 
situation-specific expectations, determining that expectation for success resulted from a 
general self-regulatory mechanism that manages discrepancies between current and 
desired state. Research on optimism and methods of coping led them to consider optimism 
a strong predictor of behaviour (Scheier & Carver, 1985). In a study of 290 undergraduates, 
published in 1986, Scheier and Carver measured optimism using the Life Orientation Test 
(Scheier & Carver, 1985) and Ways of Coping Checklist (Folkman & Lazarus, 1980, 1985).  
Optimism was shown to be positively associated with the use of problem focused coping 
and positive reinterpretation in controllable situations. For uncontrollable situations, 
optimism was positively correlated with acceptance/resignation. This study was repeated 
several weeks later providing the students with hypothetical situations. Responses were 
written by participants, then coded for analysis. Partial correlations (controlling for the 
number of words) confirmed the findings of the quantitative study: significant positive 
correlations were found between optimism and problem focused coping and positive re-
interpretation.  
While research by Carver and Scheier has primarily focused on emotional and physical 
health, studies in the workplace context suggest that optimism is a predictor of job

satisfaction and performance. Jensen et al.  (2007) issued 90 bank employees (managers 
and tellers) with the LOT, amended to measure sate hope and Hackman and Oldhams 
(1980) scale for job satisfaction. Participants were asked to rate their performance, 
however their supervisors also provided information as to participants performance, based 
on organisational competencies. A significant positive relationship was found between 
optimism and job satisfaction for both and managers. Similarly, significant positive 
correlations were found between optimism and self-rated job performance.  However 
when the relationship between optimism and supervisor rated performance was tested, 
managers data showed a strong positive correlation but the relationship was not significant 
for tellers. 
Other studies on the relationship between optimism and job performance have been less 
conclusive. Wanberg and Banas (2000) study on 130 Housing Association officials found 
that correlations between optimism (measured using the LOT) and job satisfaction 
(measured using the Michigan Organizational Assessment Questionnaire: Cammann et al., 
1983) was not significant. However, in a study with call centre employees (Tuten & 
Neidermeyer, 2004) a strong negative correlation was found between optimism (LOT) and 
both a nine item job satisfaction questionnaire devised for the study and self-reported 
performance. Additionally, optimists were shown to have lower perceptions of stress and 
work-conflict than pessimists. Interestingly a key difference between these studies was that 
where the trait LOT measurement was used (Tuten & Neidermeyer 2004; Wanberg & 
Banas, 2000), correlations between optimism and work variables were low. The study using 
a state measure of the LOT, showed positive correlations between these variables (Jensen 
et al., 2007). Indeed, work by Kleumper, Little and DeGroot (2009) explored the difference 
between state and trait optimism on job related outcomes such as job satisfaction and 
performance. Using state LOT and trait LOT in addition to Hackman and Oldhams job-
satisfaction scale (1975) and an internal organisational measure of task performance as 
rated by the participants supervisor, 118 workers of a residential youth treatment facility 
were surveyed. Traits were 
assessed upon joining the 
organisation, and 3 
months later.  As table 2.8 
shows, the correlations 
between job satisfaction 
and task performance

Performance and Job Satisfaction (Kleumper, Little & DeGroot, 2009)

were stronger for state optimism than for trait optimism. A hierarchical regression analysis 
indicated that for job satisfaction, trait optimism was a stronger predictor than state 
optimism although for task performance state and trait optimism were significant 
predictors.  
Further research has investigated the role of state in levels of optimism. Fibel and Hale 
(1978) noted that an individuals evaluation of a particular situation could alter the 
expectation of success.  Kavussanu and McAuley (1995) observed the positive impact of 
exercise on optimism. Carroll, Sweeny and Shepperd (2006) noted that changes in 
environmental conditions, in this case anticipating personal feedback, resulted in a decline 
in optimism levels. These findings suggest the importance of a more state-like aspect to 
optimism. While the research evidence supports the theory that optimism is both trait and 
state like (Kluemper, Little & De Groot, 2009; Luthans, 2002; Luthans & Youssef, 2007; 
Seligman, 2006) these might have different impacts on behaviour. Peterson (2000) uses 
big optimism and little optimism to define trait and state elements respectively. Big 
optimism, or trait optimism, enables people to be positive without any specific 
expectations  free floating optimism (Peterson, 2000 p.45). For example, One day I will 
travel abroad. This reflects the motivational and emotional aspects of Optimism. There is 
no specific plan or action to this. State optimism however, includes a cognitive element: 
which adds a reality check to optimism.  As such, situations or context may override the 
more general trait optimism; I cant travel abroad at the moment because I dont have 
enough money, but I will one day (Carver & Scheier, 1990; Kluemper et al., 2009; Peterson, 
2000).   
State like optimism appears to enable individuals to focus on outcomes that are most likely 
to be successful.  Aspinwall, Richter and Hoffman (2001) observed that when provided with 
(unsolvable) anagram tasks, participants high in optimism disengaged from activities that 
would not reap success sooner than those low in optimism. However, where success was 
possible, those high in optimism outperformed those low in optimism. This suggests that 
those who are high in optimism are able to evaluate tasks that are unlikely to achieve a 
successful outcome and switch away from them, reallocating cognitive resources to tasks in 
which they could achieve success sooner than those with low optimism. Those high in 
pessimism have been found to spend longer in denial and disengagement (Carver et al., 
1993; Klein & Helweg-Larsen, 2002; McKenna, 1993; Scheier, Weintraub & Carver, 1986).   
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  58 
Optimism may be particularly important when working in a VUCA environment. Changes 
can be imposed as a result of external forces or internal decisions. Being high in optimism 
may enable acceptance of the change given that it is not possible to control this.  In support 
of this, a study with 197 directors or CEOs of Small  Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in 
Singapore was designed to understand the factors that enable successful organisational 
change. The results demonstrated a correlation between successful organisational change 
and optimism about the organisation (Tan & Tiong, 2005). However, the direction of this 
relationship is not clear.  
Volatility and ambiguity may scupper efforts to understand the future and plan ahead. A 
lack of understanding as to the cause and effect of an issue may diminish confidence in 
outcomes (Bennett & Lemoine, 2014a, b). However, the optimist may still believe that 
whatever the outcome, it will be positive.  That is not to advocate blind optimism, always 
believing in a successful outcome may be unrealistic. Even when made aware of increased 
crime, Tyler and Cook (1984) discovered that although individuals acknowledged the 
increase in crime at a societal level, they still did not believe it would happen to them. 
Indeed, in this day of increased awareness of internet fraud and identity theft, most users 
of IT still select weak passwords and use the same password multiple times (Yan et al., 
2004). Optimism needs to be balanced to mitigate against the naive setting of unrealistic 
goals, the ability to have dreams but not fantasies (Peterson, 2000 p.51). The 
Psychological Capital model mitigates the risk of blind optimism with the inclusion of Hope. 
2.2.2.2 The Hope Component of Psychological Capital 
There have been challenges as to whether Hope and Optimism describe separate factors 
(discussed further in the Results section). Certainly they both work from the same premise - 
that human behaviour is goal directed. However, Carver and Scheier (2002), Snyder et al. 
(1996) and Luthans (2002) seek to differentiate them. Whereas Optimism refers to the 
individuals belief or confidence in successful outcomes, hope refers to action; the belief 
that goals can be achieved despite any potential obstacles through agency i.e. goal directed 
energy and pathways, and means to meet the goals. Hope and optimism are considered 
separate because there are times when belief that a goal can be reached is less about how 
the goal is achieved (hope), and more of a belief that it can be (optimism). Scheier and 
Carver (2002) use the example of recuperating cancer patients. They remain optimistic that 
the cancer will not return. Whether it does may be out of their control. There may be no 
personal agency involved (hope), just a belief and confidence that it wont. Hope and 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  59 
Optimism have a symbiotic relationship. Optimism provides the belief in a successful 
outcome, while Hope provides the belief in the means to the outcome. If optimism is the 
wish, then hope is the willpower and the waypower to a successful outcome (Youssef 
& Luthans, 2007 p.778). 
Research into hope has provided evidence that higher hope is related to increased self
esteem, sporting and academic achievement (Cheavens, Michael & Snyder, 2005; Curry et 
al., 1997; Snyder et al.,1991), improved recovery from ill health or injury (Barnum et al., 
1998; Callan, 1989), recovery from mental illness (Elliott et al., 1991; Irving et al., 2004; 
Snyder et al., 1991), management of pain (Snyder et al., 2005) and psychological wellbeing 
(Wrobleski, & Snyder, 2005). In the workplace, higher hope has been linked with higher 
performance, satisfaction and retention rates (Luthans & Jensen, 2002; Peterson & Luthans, 
2003) and engagement (Ouweneel et al., 2012). Leaders with higher hope were shown to 
create higher quality solutions to work problems (Peterson & Byron, 2008). This has 
implications for organisations, because if hope has a state like component, then these skills 
may be able to be developed in leaders, thereby improving performance.  
Snyder, Irving & Anderson (1991) defined Hope as having two distinctive cognitive 
components:  personal agency (goal directed energy) and pathways to goal achievement. 
These were initially considered to be, and measured as, dispositional traits. However, hope 
has been recognised as a state that can be developed through educational interventions 
(Luthans et al., 2006a; Snyder et al., 1991; Valle, Huebner & Suldo, 2006). As such, Snyders 
Adult Hope Scale, the most widely used measure (Scioli et al., 2011, p.82), has also been 
developed as a State Hope Scale (Snyder et al., 1996).  
There is criticism that the conceptualisation of hope as an expectation of goal achievement 
is too narrow (Herth, 1992; Scioli et al., 2011). Herth (1992) argues that as well as the goal 
achievement expectation, hope also contains the elements of time-orientation and future 
focus. He used this conception to develop a 30 item Herth Hope Scale and a 12 item 
abbreviated version, the Herth Hope index accordingly. However this was developed for the 
clinical context using qualitative data from chronically ill patients which might make it 
unsuitable for use in workplace settings.  
Scioli et al. (2011) also define hope as multi-dimensional, arguing that it consists of 
biological, psychological and social resources which includes mastery, attachment, 
survival and spiritual systems (p.79). A six factor, 56 item Comprehensive Trait Hope Scale 
(CHS-T) and 4 factor, 40 item Comprehensive State Hope Scale (CHS-S) were developed. 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  60 
However, the factor most relevant to POB criteria is the 8 question mastery factor, which 
mirrors Snyders Hope scale, measuring goals and pathways, the remaining 5 factors not 
being work related. 
Defining hope as a positive motivational state (Snyder, Irving, and Anderson, 1991 p.287) 
in which there is agency and pathways to goals, might increase the risk of setting unrealistic 
goals.  False hope syndrome has been posited by Polivy and Herman (2000). In their work 
with dieters, they find that more often than not, people set unrealistic goals in terms of 
time taken or impact of goal achievement, creating False Hope Syndrome. This they 
believed was due to participants over-confidence in managing the physical and mental 
obstacles that come with weight loss and thus not revising their expectations after failure 
to achieve their target weight.  
Despite the findings of Polivy and Herman (2000), there has been much criticism of the 
construct of False Hope (Corrigan, 2014; Lowe, 2003; Snyder & Rand, 2003). Extant research 
has found that those with high hope were able to review goals, set and achieve challenging 
goals and were able to manage cognitive and physical obstacles to goal achievement 
(Snyder, Cheavens & Sympson, 1997; Snyder, 2002; Irving et al., 2004). Garland (1983, 
1985) found that even unattainable goals or stretch goals led to improved performance 
from the pre-goal target.  This suggests that those in Polivy and Hermans (2000) study had 
particularly low hope. In a dieter study, those who failed blamed themselves rather than 
the program but credited the programme, rather themselves for success (Polivy, 2001), the 
exact opposite of the expected explanatory style of an optimist. This suggests that these 
dieters may also have been low in optimism. Interestingly, the dieters, having described 
their ideal weight (often unrealistically at up to a third of their body weight), were 
described in the study as having failed to achieve this, even if some weight was lost 
(Polivy, 2001). The research by Seek Lee et al (2016, 2018) on the relationship between 
growth mind-set and hope, might suggest that this binary fixed mind set of failed weight 
loss may have impacted on levels of Hope. In their research with both workers (N=368) and 
mothers (N=290), hope was shown to be positively related to a growth mind-set (Seek Lee 
& Jang, 2018; Seek Lee, Ui Park & Kyoung Hwang, 2016). However, as Polivy & Hermans 
(1999) study measured neither hope, optimism or growth mind set it is not possible to 
determine the impact of each factor. 
Unlike optimism, hope is considered a solely cognitive process through which realistic and 
yet challenging goals are set. Any emotions are considered a consequence of this process 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  61 
rather than an input to the process (Luthans, Youssef-Morgan & Avolio, 2015; Snyder et al., 
1991). Luthans et al., (2015) argue that hope is more than just goal setting. It is opening 
ourselves up to new possibilities and experiences beyond what we thought was possible 
(p.100). Goal setting leads to learning, growth and creative problem solving. This is 
particularly important in a VUCA environment whereby organisations are dealing with 
unknown unknowns (Bennett & Lemoine, 2014b p.1) resulting in ill-defined problems and 
novel situations (Chan, 2000). Employees are expected to be able to adapt and learn (Prez
Bustamante, 1999; Griffin & Hesketh, 2003). To develop innovative and creative ways to 
solve unfamiliar problems (Hill & Davis, 2017; Kark & Carmeli, 2009; Nelson & McCann, 
2010). Optimism can offer a positive view of outcomes. Hope offers the pathway and 
agency to achieve this. However our employee needs to have the belief that they have the 
capability to follow hopes pathway to goals. Self-Efficacy is required. 
2.2.2.3 The Self-Efficacy Component of Psychological Capital 
Self-Efficacy is defined as a belief in ones capabilities, either generally (trait level) or to 
execute a specific task within a given, specific context (state level), (Bandura, 1986, 1997; 
Stajkovic & Luthans, 1998a) and is based on the work of Banduras social learning (1977) 
and social cognition theories (Bandura & Wood, 1989).  Note, self-efficacy is not ability per 
se but the individuals perception or cognitive appraisal of their ability (Bandura 1977, 
1982a; Luthans 2002; Stajkovic 2006).  
Self-Efficacy (or mastery) has been associated with coping and resilience. Studies by Thoits 
(1994), Werner (1993), Rini et al. (1999) and Rutter (1987) identify self-efficacy as being a 
key mechanism in dealing with life challenges such as relationships, childhood adversity, 
pregnancy and parental loss, respectively.  Banduras work on self-efficacy originated in the 
clinical context of dealing with fears and phobias (1977, 1982a).  However, research has 
extended this to the workplace and has demonstrated significant relationships between 
self-efficacy and performance (Bandura & Locke 2003; Cervonne, 1991; Stajkovic & Luthans 
1998a, b; Tierney & Farmer 2002; Wood, Bandura & Bailey 1990). Those with high self-
efficacy have been shown to be more accepting of challenging goals (Eden & Ravid, 1982) 
show more perseverance and effort towards high or challenging goals (Locke & Latham, 
1990) and have improved quality of analytical thinking and problem solving (Bandura & 
Wood, 1989; Wood & Bandura, 1989; Wood, Bandura, & Bailey, 1990). In their meta-
analysis of self-efficacy and work performance, Stajkovic and Luthans (1998a) 
demonstrated that self-efficacy was positively related to work performance. Particularly 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  62 
relevant for todays environments, Thompson and Gomez, (2014) studied the role of self-
efficacy in moderating workplace stressors such as role ambiguity. Findings showed that 
self-efficacy moderated the relationship between role ambiguity and depression. In highly 
role ambiguous situations, those with low levels of self-efficacy showed increased levels of 
depression.  
Banduras work measured the magnitude and strength of an individuals self-efficacy (1977, 
1982a, 1982b) identifying four sources of self-efficacy: performance accomplishments, 
vicarious experience, persuasion by others and physiological environment which 
acknowledges the affective element in perceived efficacy (1977). 
Performance accomplishments: research suggests that the more successes we have, 
the more our perception of our efficacy increases. Bandura, Blanchard and Ritter 
(1969) in their work with snake phobias, found that having mastered their fear of 
snakes in the laboratory, participants were able to apply this in subsequent 
encounters with snakes outside of this environment. Research by Lane, Lane and 
Kyprianou (2004) on 205 postgraduate management students found that perceived 
past academic success was positively correlated with self-efficacy to pass the post-
graduate qualification. Lanes (2002) work with boxers indicated that self-efficacy 
scores were predicted by perceived performance. 
Perceived successful performance not only develops our resilience against any 
failures (as long as they dont outnumber the successes), but also increases our 
perception of efficacy, but only in other similar activities (Bandura, 1977).  
Self-Efficacy can vary in magnitude depending on the complexity of the task. Despite 
their findings that self-efficacy was correlated to work performance, Stajkovic and 
Luthans (1998a) acknowledged that that task complexity moderated self-efficacy.  
Self- efficacy can be high for simple tasks, but lower for tasks that are perceived as 
more complex, although what is determined as complex is subjective (Campbell, 
1988).  The strength of self-efficacy is also dependant on the duration of experiences 
of success and thus the extent to which self-efficacy has been reinforced (Bandura, 
1994).  
Vicarious Experience:  Seeing those around you succeeding in achieving a task 
without negative consequences may increase the strength of your self-efficacy. 
Bandura et al. (1969) noticed that levels of fear towards snakes dropped after having 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  63 
watched just 2 videos of people successfully handling snakes. The more videos 
watched, the greater the drop in fear levels. An interesting study on attitudes 
towards police based on vicarious experiences (someone you know/dont know has 
had a positive/negative experience of the police) showed that negative vicarious 
experiences unsurprisingly increased negative attitudes toward the police, while 
positive vicarious experiences were associated with a reduction in negative attitudes 
toward the police (Rosenbaum et al., 2005). 
There is little research into vicarious experience in organisations, although vicarious 
learning had been recognised as a valuable both between and within organisations. 
Kim and Miner (2007) studied vicarious learning between 2,696 US banks over five 
years noting that failure, or near failure, produced valuable learning for remaining 
banks. Manz and Sims (1981) argues the importance of vicarious learning in 
establishing behaviour change in employees. Employees observing successful 
behaviours in others may imitate or model such behaviours. Certainly in the context 
of Psychological Safety, the team leaders behaviour in particular sets the tone for 
what behaviour results in success or failure (Edmondson, 1999).  
However, vicarious experience relies on a comparison process between the individual 
and the others who they see succeeding. This affective process of self-evaluation 
may not necessarily improve self-efficacy. Langer (1979) observed that the presence 
of another superior individual led to a reduction in performance of a task in which 
there was previous success. Therefore, self-efficacy might also be dependent on the 
perceptions of the person being observed, their judgements and values about others 
and what they are doing. 
Persuasion by others: Bandura (1977) acknowledged the weakness in the effect of 
persuasion by others on self-efficacy, since the process of someone merely telling 
you that you can do something, does not make it so. As he found in his study with 
snakes: merely learning the facts about snakes did not change the negative attitude 
towards them (Bandura et al., 1969). The value here, Bandura suggests, is around the 
others encouraging achievement. Although the relationship between parties and 
associated affective processes such as trust and Psychological Safety will impact the 
effectiveness of the persuasion. This is particularly relevant in the workplace where 
persuasion may lead employees to be suspicious of agendas (Edmondson & Harvey, 
2017; Schabracq & Cooper, 2000). 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  64 
Physiological environment (emotional arousal). This acknowledges the role of the 
individuals affective and psychological processes on perceptions of self-efficacy. 
Bandura refers to the emotional arousal created by the environment. Where the 
environment is perceived as threatening or generating fear, this debilitates 
performance (Arnsten, 2009; Ball et al., 2013; Bandura, 1977; Figueira et al., 2017) 
ultimately impacting perception of efficacy. 
Optimism and Self-Efficacy share a commonality. Bandura (1977) describes self-efficacy as 
consisting of two expectations: Efficacy Expectation he defines as what an individual 
believes they can do and Outcome Expectations he defines as what they believe the likely 
outcome of what they can do will be. The outcome expectation relates to Optimism: the 
confidence that the outcome or goal can be achieved (Bandura, 1997; Carver, Scheier & 
Segerstrom, 2010). 
Confidence refers to having certainty about the 
output of ones efficacy (Stajkovic, 2006 p.1208) 
and can be derived from self-efficacy. Bandura 
illustrates the relationship between ones self-
efficacy and outcome judgement (confidence) in 
a four box model (see table 2.9), illustrating that 
an individual may be assured of their 
capabilities but give up trying because they 
expect their efforts to produce no result 
(1982a, p.140). 
Relationships between confidence and self-efficacy as separate constructs have been 
identified.  Leganger, Kraft and Rysam (2000) measured 421 Norwegian Smokers on their 
self-efficacy at giving up smoking and their outcome expectancies of doing so (positive or 
negative). A regression analysis indicated that self-efficacy, negative outcomes and positive 
outcome expectations accounted 33% of the variance in intention to quit. This suggests 
that that self-efficacy is as important as outcome expectations in changing smoking 
behaviour. 
Stankov et al. (2012) measured confidence and self-efficacy in maths (N=1940 15 year old 
students) and English (N=1786 15 year old students). Defining confidence as being certain 
about the success of a particular action (p.747), students were measured on their self-
Table 2.9 Self-Efficacy Mechanisms in 
Human Agency (Bandura, 1982a, pp140) 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  65 
efficacy, asked to perform English and Maths tests and then asked to rate their confidence 
of their answer being correct. 
 For English and Maths accuracy and confidence were highly correlated, but correlations 
were lower between self-efficacy and accuracy, and self-efficacy and confidence (see table 
2.10). 
Regression analysis showed that of 
the seven predictors of English and 
Maths achievement, confidence was 
the highest predictor for both English 
and Maths (see table 2.11).  
 However, in a similar study, (Pajares 
& Miller, 1994) self-efficacy was 
established to be the greatest 
predictor of maths performance. 
Pajeres and Miller argued that beliefs regarding confidence are part of an individuals self-
concept and represent different phenomena (p.194). Working with 350 undergraduates, 
self-efficacy concerning maths was tested using Dowlings (1978) maths self-efficacy scale 
and the maths performance using his Mathematics 
Problems Performance scale. Perceived importance 
of maths was tested using a measure adapted from 
Shell, Murphy and Brunning, (1989) while maths 
self-concept was tested using the Self-Description 
Questionnaire (Marsh, 1992). Correlations between 
maths self-efficacy and maths performance, maths 
self-efficacy and maths self-concept and maths self-
concept and maths usefulness were high. Path 
analysis confirmed that self-efficacy significantly 
predicted maths and self-concept. However, using 
self-concept to measure confidence, even at a 
specific level of maths, may be erroneous as by 
their own admission, confidence is only part of self-concept. Shavelson, Hubner and 
Stanton (1976) argue that the variety of definitions of self-concept make measurement 
Table 2.10 Correlations between Accuracy, confidence 
and self-efficacy in Maths and English (Stankov, Lee, 
Luo & Hogan, 2010).

Luo & Hogan (2012)

S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  66 
imprecise (p.408) and their research identified 17 different conceptual dimensions that 
could be considered self-concept. 
In todays environment, where jobs are broader and more complex (Chen, Gully & Eden, 
2001 p.77) and change rapid, discrepancies between performance and self-efficacy 
expectations are more likely (Bandura, 1977). The rise of unexpected and new problems 
can create confusion and uncertainty as to what to do despite years of experience (Jentz & 
Murphy, 2005). Role ambiguity, role conflict and workplace uncertainty have been shown 
to undermine self-efficacy (Jackson & Schuler, 1985; Jex & Gudanowski, 1992; King & King, 
1990; Li & Bagger, 2008; Thompson & Gomez, 2014). Addressing todays problems with 
yesterdays solutions will not always work (Petrie, 2011). As a result, the building blocks of 
self-efficacy have the potential to be eroded.  Past performance accomplishments or 
vicarious experience cannot be relied upon to increase perceptions of efficacy.   
Self-efficacy is still an important personal resource. However, in the VUCA context, its 
definition may need to be modified. The skills of todays employee are cognitive, knowing 
what to do, when you dont know what to do (Sepielli, 2014 p.1), testing new ideas and 
risk taking (Wilson & Lawton-Smith, 2016), problem solving and adapting (Pulakos et al., 
2000) and self-awareness (Petrie, 2011). 
2.2.2.4 The Resilience Component of Psychological Capital 
Early studies of resilience were in the context of mental health with the aim of identifying 
the antecedents to the development of competent or maladaptive behaviour (Garmezy, 
1986 p.501). Resilience research focused on children or adolescents deemed at high risk 
from adverse factors such as poverty (Cicchetti & Garmezy 1993; Cicchetti & Rogosch 1997; 
Egeland et al., 1993; Masten et al., 1990; Werner, 1993), low social economic status and 
family instability (Masten et al., 1990; Werner, 1993),  parental mental health  (Beardslee & 
Podorefsky,  1988;  Garmezy, 1987;  Masten et al., 1990; Werner, 1993), abuse and neglect 
(Cicchetti et al., 1997; Egeland et al., 1993) and more recently the impact of war (Masten & 
Narayan, 2012; Werner, 2012). These studies in developmental psychology share a 
common view that despite adversity or threats to normal development (Masten, 2001) 
resilience leads to good, or at least better than expected, outcomes (Windle, 2011).   
While research into resilience has almost exclusively studied children, some longitudinal 
studies have followed these children into adulthood: examples include the Oakland Growth 
Study, the Berkley Guidance Study and the Berkley Growth Study from the 1920s and 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  67 
1930s, Project Competence (Garmezy, Masten & Tellegen, 1984), the Kauai Studies by 
Werner (1993) and the Mother-Child study by Egeland Carlson & Sroufe (1993). By 
comparing those who ultimately achieved good outcomes in life despite early or continuing 
adversity, with those who did not, researchers identified factors that contribute to 
resilience. These included perceived social support (Gordon & Coscarelli 1996; Garmezy 
1991; Hauser & Allen 2007; Luthar et al., 2000; Masten, et al., 1990; Masten & Narayan, 
2012; McEwan, 2016; Rutter, 1987; Ryff & Singer, 2003; Tusaie & Dyer, 2004; Werner, 
1993), social skills (Jowkar, Friborg & Hjemdal, 2012; Masten & Narayan, 2012), intelligence 
(Werner, 1993) and the environment (Garmezy, 1991; Gordon & Coscarelli,1996; Luthar et 
al., 2000; Masten et al., 1990).  Such contributors to resilience have been termed  
protective factors (Garmezy, 1991; Richardson, 2002; Werner, 1993, 1995, 2012), assets 
(Bardoel, 2014; Fergus & Zimmerman, 2005; Richardson, 2002;) resources (Britt, 2016; 
Cicchetti & Rogosch, 1997; Cohn et al., 2009; Egeland et al., 1993; Fergus & Zimmerman, 
2005;  Gordon & Coscarelli, 1995;  Masten, 2001; Masten & Narayan, 2012; Shin, Taylor & 
Seo, 2012; Staudinger, Marsiske & Baltes, 1993; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003), energy 
(Richardson, 2002) and strengths (Cicchetti & Garmezy, 1993; Luthar & Brown, 2007). 
Adult research on resilience has primarily been in the context of psychological challenges 
such as bereavement and loss (Bonanno, 2004; Stroebe & Schut, 1999), post-traumatic 
stress syndrome (Fikretoglu & Liu, 2012; King et al., 1999; Maguen et al., 2006), depression 
(Dykman, 1998; Hobfoll et al., 2003; Holahan et al., 1999) and aging (Jeste et al., 2013; Ryff 
& Singer, 2003; Staudinger et al., 1993). Unlike research with children, studies with adults 
appear to suggest that adult resilience is a result of personal attributes such as 
mastery/self-efficacy/competence (Elder, 1998; Glantz & Sloboda,  2002; Hauser & Allen, 
2007; Sutcliffe & Vogus 2003), optimism (Chang & Sanna 2001; Gillespie, Chaboyer & 
Wallis, 2007b; Gillespie et al., 2007a; Luthans, 2002; Scheier & Carver, 1985), planning 
(Masten et al., 2004; Rutter, 2012), self-enhancement (Bonanno, 2004), personal  agency 
(Glantz, 2002; Hauser & Allen, 2007) as well as the individuals value or belief systems 
(Coutu, 2002; Masten et al., 2012). By drawing on intrinsic and extrinsic personal resources, 
individuals are able to cope and maintain equilibrium in performance and functioning 
(Bonanno, 2004; Cicchetti & Garmezy, 1993; Egeland et al., 1993; Glantz & Sloboda, 2002; 
Masten et al., 1990; McCubbin, 2001; Rutter, 1987; Staudinger et al., 1993; Van Den Heuvel 
et al., 2010).

However, the definition of resilience is still an illusive concept (Kumpfer, 2002 p.180). 
Most definitions of resilience are based on the work of Gamezy (1991), Masten (2001) and 
Rutter (2006) and refer to maintaining equilibrium or returning to pre-adversity functioning 
after a challenge (Bonanno, 2004; Zautra & Reich, 2010) (see Appendix F for definitions of 
resilience). Considered to be a result of normal, basic human adaptation systems (Bonanno, 
2004; Glantz & Sloboda, 2002; Luthar, Cicchetti & Becker, 2000; Masten, 2001; McEwan, 
2016; Staudinger et al., 1993; Wagnild & Young, 1993), they defined resilience as the 
process of, capacity for, or outcome of 
successful adaptation despite challenging 
or threatening circumstances (Masten, 
Best & Garmezy, 1990 p.426). However, 
not all researchers agree over how the 
process of resilience should be defined (see 
table 2.12).  
Like Gordon (1995), Luthans (2002) 
broadens his definition of resilience,  going 
beyond simple adaptation (p.702) 
defining it as: in simple, but accurate 
terms, resiliency is the psychological 
capacity to rebound, to 'bounce back' from 
adversity, uncertainty, conflict, failure or 
even positive change, progress and 
increased responsibility (p.702). Youssef 
and Luthans (2007) propose that resilience 
enables growth and learning. Indeed it has 
been suggested that resilience includes the 
ability to not just survive adversity but to 
thrive (Beltman, Mansfield & Price, 2011, 
p.186), flourish (Nswall et al., 2015 p.1) 
and achieve positive growth (Compas, 
2006 p.226). There is certainly evidence to 
suggest that people do grow and learn as a 
result of trauma of challenge. For instance,

the changes in outlook of survivors of a ferry disaster (N=35) and found that the survivors 
no longer took people or things for granted (91%), were more tolerant and understanding 
(71%) and 50% were more determined to succeed in life. 
This supports work by Tedeschi & Calhoun (1996, 2004) showing that positive personal 
change is higher in those who have experienced severe trauma.  However, there is also 
evidence which fails to support this, finding instead that growth does not follow a trauma 
or challenging situation (Bensimon, 2012; Frazier et al., 2009; Videka-Sherman, 1985).  For 
instance, in their research, Frazier et al. (2009) tested 1281 undergraduate students twice 
with 8 weeks between each testing.   Measures included the Traumatic Life Events 
Questionnaire (Kubany, 2004) and the Post Traumatic Growth Index (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 
1996) which measured both actual and perceived growth after trauma. 338 students 
experienced a traumatic event between time 1 and time 2 that caused considerable to 
extreme distress (p.917). The change in perceived growth as a result of trauma was 
positively correlated with coping at time 2 (r-.52, p<.001) however, the change in actual 
growth showed a weak correlation with coping at time 2 (r=.12) suggesting that people 
merely perceive that they experienced growth as a result of trauma. Frazier et al. (2009) 
acknowledged however that studies on Post Traumatic growth are not usually performed 
on undergraduates and that any growth from trauma may not materialise within 8 weeks.  
Comparing research on resilience-based growth is challenging. What constitutes growth 
differs between study and includes behaviours such as stopping drinking (Park, 1998), 
deeper religious beliefs (Pargament & Park,1995), not taking life for granted (Joseph, 
Williams & Yule, 1993) and psychological changes such as sense of personal strength and 
increased spirituality (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004; Wortman, 2004). Consequently, the 
manner in which growth is measured also varies.  
Nevertheless, Luthans broader definition of resilience refers to recovery (or bouncing back) 
and subsequent progression. There is no reference to the deployment of internal or 
external personal resources to maintain equilibrium. If being resilient is the ability to 
manage despite trauma or challenge (Levine et al., 2009) at the point when bouncing back 
is required, the deployment of personal resources has already failed; resilience has failed. 
As Bonanno (2004) observes, if someone were able to maintain their resilience, they would 
have nothing from which to bounce back. Furthermore, if growth was inherent to 
resilience, every person who exercised resilience would grow from the experience, which 
does not appear to be the case (Bensimon, 2012; Bonanno, Boerner & Wortman, 2008; 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  70 
Helgeson, Reynolds & Tomich, 2006; Wortman, 2004). In an 18 year study of resilience in 
disadvantaged children Egeland, Carlson and Stroufe (1993), found that adverse situations 
had a cumulative negative effect on competency rather than providing opportunities for 
growth beyond equilibrium. For the few that did successfully bounce back they achieved 
what society would consider normal functioning. Given the background of the 
participants, was this evidence of growth or merely reaching an acceptable level of 
equilibrium and functioning?  
The error proponents of adversity leading to growth might be making is to combine two 
different motivational mechanisms and labelling them resilience. The drive to protect 
ourselves against harm, often triggered by an emotional event, is a defensive motivational 
system that draws on our resources to return us to homeostasis (Cacioppo, Gardner & 
Berntson, 1999; Lang, 1995; Lazarus & Folkman, 1987; Zautra & Reich, 2010). Growth 
derives from an appetite motivational system whereby self-efficacy and reflection enable a 
greater understanding of ones self. (Cacioppo et al., 1999; Lang, 1995; Richardson, 2002; 
Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004; Zautra & Reich, 2010). Resilience and recovery are discrete and 
empirically separable (Bonanno, 2005 p.135). Caza and Milton (2012) support this view, 
arguing that resilience is the ability to remain competent during adversity but it is 
afterwards that learning and development takes place.  
Recent neuroscience research suggests that learning and growing whilst dealing with 
adverse situations may be a challenge. The term allostatis (McEwen, 2001, 2016) is used to 
describe the brains adaptation processes needed to maintain equilibrium in functioning. 
Increase in allostatic load is the result of repeatedly activating these adaptation processes, 
for example when experiencing chronic stress. Stress hormones such as cortisol and 
adrenaline, activated during emotional or adverse events, compromise the effectiveness of 
the executive functioning of the brain and cognitive function (Girotti et al., 2018). Areas 
that are needed for learning such as the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus 
(Arnsten et al., 2015; Compas, 2006; Kalisch et al., 2019; McEwen, 1995) are deprioritised 
thereby impairing function. In addition, the increase in cortisol reduces dopamine uptake, 
an essential neurotransmitter for learning (Hohnen & Murphy, 2016; Willis, 2010). Kloet 
(2004) found that mice exposed to chronic stress showed reduced spatial learning in 
response to high cortisone levels. 
McEwen (2016) argues that the goal of interventions that build resilience is to mobilise 
both internal and external resources to enable adaptation and growth. In the context of 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  71 
resource theories discussed above, those experiencing stressful demands will be deploying 
their resources to maintain equilibrium. It is therefore, only when the stress diminishes, 
that resources become available to focus on growth and development (Bakker et al., 2007; 
Hobfoll, 2002).  In the context of VUCA, levels of Psychological Safety may be reduced if 
ambiguity, uncertainty and unpredictable environments are considered threatening (May 
et al., 2004). Consequently, employees psychological resources are being invested in self-
preservation and maintaining equilibrium. Conversely, when feeling safe, employees can 
engage in new experiences and learning without fear or threat (Wanless, 2016b).  
Anecdotally, there is support for the notion that having psychological resources leads to 
resilience (Britt, 2016; Gordon & Coscarelli, 1996; Kumpfer, 2002; Meredith et al., 2011; 
Park 1998; Ryff & Singer, 2003; Sommer, 2016; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003). Which resources 
are thought to increase resilience 
varies from Authenticity to Wisdom 
(see table 2.13). Thus when trying to 
develop and build resilience, there is 
little clarity on which psychological 
resources to focus. 
 It would be of particular interest to 
determine the personal resources that 
are key to resilience in todays 
workplace. However, despite 
considerable past research on 
resilience, there has been less 
research into resilience in the context 
of todays organisations (King, 
Newman & Luthans, 2016).  Studies of 
resilience in the workplace have 
primarily researched extrinsic 
resources such as support and feedback (Kuntz, Connell, & Naswall, 2017), supportive 
leadership and co-worker support (Cooke, Wang & Bartram, 2019), organisational 
inducements and social exchange (Shin et al., 2012) and leadership styles (Nguyen et al., 
2016). These give no insight into the intrinsic psychological resources that lead to resilience. 
Table 2.13 Summary of psychological resources 
identified as resulting in resilience.

The Healthcare industry appear to be the pioneers in understanding how employee 
resilience is created. Gevaux & Petty (2018) used a card sorting exercise to identify the 
resources that 25 healthcare professionals felt were the most helpful/unhelpful and 
abundant/scarce resources available to aid with their resilience. The identified resources 
were categorised into organisational resources (tangible and cultural), personal resources 
such as positive ways of working, outlook or attitudes, coping strategies and tangible 
resources (e.g. sleep, massages, alcohol).  The most helpful and available resources 
identified for resilience were personal outlooks and attitudes (keeping an open mind; 
humour) and positive ways of working (building on personal experience and expertise; 
maintaining sense of control over work responsibilities).  A potential limitation of this study 
might be the technique of card sorting. Cards were provided with resource options 
gathered from a focus group. Therefore only those identified resources are sorted. There 
may have been other resources not represented on the cards. Furthermore, card sorting 
has been criticised as providing anecdotal evidence (Wood & Wood, 2008, p.5).  
In their concept analysis of resilience, Gillespie et al. (2007b) studied 50 papers from a 30 
year period. They identified three defining attributes of resilience: self-efficacy, hope and 
coping. Coping they defined as Lazarus 
and Folkmans (1987) problem-focused 
coping; the process of reappraising the 
situation in such a way that adjustment 
can occur and emotions regulated. 
Gillespie et al. (2007a) in their work to 
understand the attributes of resilience 
in theatre nurses, tested three resource 
constructs: belief that the goal can be 
attained (hope); self-efficacy and 
coping, hypothesising them to be 
antecedents to resilience. Seven 
hundred and seventy-two nurses 
completed a questionnaire measuring 
twelve variables (see table 2.14). 
Regression analysis indicated that the independent variables accounted for 58% of the 
variance in resilience. However, it was hope and self-efficacy that had the strongest 
relationship with resilience.

al., 2002a).

When designing and implementing training to develop Psychological Capital, Luthans 
acknowledges that resilience is developed through the building of personal assets (2010 
p. 66). These assets he describes as the development of several pathways to accomplish 
the goal (hope), increasing [the participants] efficacy to accomplish the goal (self-
efficacy) and increasing positive expectations of goal accomplishment (optimism) (p.52). 
These are defined as the strengths or psychological capacities needed for performance 
(Luthans & Church, 2002 p.59). Psychological capacities are defined as an accessible 
psychological resource that contributes to the achievement of adaptive intrapsychic and 
interpersonal functioning" (Zilberg et al., 1991, p.321). In other words, these are cognitive 
resources that allow us to adapt and function, a definition that parallels resilience.  
The POB criteria, required the four components of Psychological Capital: Hope, Optimism, Self-
Efficacy and Resilience, to be state like and therefore develop-able. In fact, Luthans at al. (2007) 
argue that they are both trait like and state like. Not as hard-wired as personality traits, but also 
not so state-like that they are transient, such as moods or emotions (Youssef-Morgan et al., 2015) 
(see figure 2.2). For example, Snyder et al., 
have developed both state (1991) and trait 
hope scales (1996), recognising that people 
have both a dispositional hope as well as a 
state hope that reflects current 
circumstances. The creation of the state 
hope scale has allowed a measurement of an individuals current goal-directed thinking in a 
particular context (Snyder et al., 1996). State self-efficacy refers to an individuals beliefs about their 
abilities to perform a specific task (Stajkovic & Luthans, 1998b). Being a state-like domain enables the 
development and management of Psychological Capital components within a context, in this case the 
workplace (Luthans & Church, 2002; Youssef-Morgan & Luthans, 2015).   
Thus Luthans and colleagues identified four apparently unique yet associated state-like resources 
(Avey et al., 2011) which, when combined,  create the higher order construct of Psychological Capital 
(Luthans, 2002; Luthans & Youssef, 2004; Luthans, Youssef, & Avolio, 2007). This they defined as 
an individuals positive psychological state of development that is characterized by: (1) 
having confidence (self-efficacy) to take on and put in the necessary effort to succeed at 
challenging tasks; (2) making a positive attribution (optimism) about succeeding now and in 
the future; (3) persevering toward goals and, when necessary, redirecting paths to goals

and Youssef (2007) in Dawkins and Martin (2013, p.18)

(hope) in order to succeed; and (4) when beset by problems and adversity, sustaining and 
bouncing back and even beyond (resiliency) to attain success (Luthans et al., 2007a, p.3). 
The next section will explore the research into establishing the four resources as unique and the 
subsequent validation of Psychological Capital as a higher order construct.  
2.3 Validation of the Psychological Capital Model 
Early investigations into Hope, Self-Efficacy and Optimism as predictors of general wellbeing were 
carried out by Magaletta and Oliver (1999) using the same measures as Luthans later used in his 
Psychological Capital Questionnaire (PCQ).  These were: the Life Orientation Test (LOT) to assess 
Optimism (Scheier & Carver, 1985), the Adult Hope Scale (AHS) to test Hope (Snyder et al., 1991) and 
the Self-Efficacy Scale (SES) to test Self-Efficacy (Sherer et al., 1982). Measures were administered to 
204 psychology students between the ages of 17  50 years old, 97% of whom were under the age of 
25. A Maximum likelihood factor analysis was performed specifying the SES, the LOT and the two 
components of Hope: Agency and Pathways. The resulting four factor solution demonstrated that 
Self-Efficacy, Optimism and the Pathways component of Hope each loaded onto the first three 
factors. The Agency component of hope loaded onto the fourth factor along with three Self-Efficacy 
questions. It was concluded that hope, optimism and self-efficacy were related but not identical 
contrasts (1999, p.548). 
Carifo & Rhodes (2002) found similar results in their small study of students at risk (N=78). The study 
aimed to determine the relationships between optimism (LOT), hope (AHS), self-efficacy (Academic 
Self-Efficacy Scale: Owen & Froman, 1988) and locus of control (Multi-dimensional-Multi-
attributional Causality Scale, 
MMCS: Lefcourt et al., 1979).  
They concluded that LOT and 
AHS measured independent yet 
complimentary constructs. The 
four subcomponents of Locus of 
control; self-confidence, effort, 
ability and luck showed little or 
no correlation with Hope, 
Optimism or Self-efficacy (see 
table 2.15).  Bryant and Cvengros 
(2004) confirmed the findings of

Carifio and Rhodes (2002) in their research to determine whether Hope (AHS) and Optimism (LOT) 
were separate constructs or whether they reflected the same underlying trait. Undergraduate 
psychology students (N=351) from two universities completed the questionnaires anonymously. A 
Confirmatory Factor Analysis supported Snyder et al.s (1991) theory that Hope consists of two 
dimensions: Agency and Pathways, and that Optimism also consisted of two dimensions: positively 
framed optimism and negatively framed pessimism (Dember et al., 1989a, 1989b) with a four factor 
model (Agency, Pathways, Optimism and Pessimism) providing a stronger fit than a unidimensional 
model. This suggests that although related, Hope and Optimism are separate constructs. Using the 
same participants, Bryant et al. (2004) tested whether Hope (AHS), Optimism (LOT) and Self-Efficacy 
(Self-Efficacy Scale: Sherer et al., 1992) are interchangeable concepts. The strongest model fit was a 
three-factor model, suggesting that Self-Efficacy is a separate construct from Hope and Optimism. It 
should be noted that the optimism and hope scales used in these studies were dispositional  testing 
trait rather than state.  
Thus there is research to suggest that Hope, Optimism and self-efficacy are separate, although 
related, constructs. However, this is contrary to the findings of Cozzarelli (1993) who researched self-
efficacy in the adjustment of 291 women undergoing abortions. Measures were made of self-efficacy 
(using a self-efficacy scale for use with abortion studies: Major et al., 1985) optimism (LOT), self-
esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, 1965), chronic perceptions of control (Self-Mastery Scale: 
Pearlin & Schooler, 1981) and depression (Centre for Epidemiological Studies  Depression Subscale 
(CES-D): Radloff, 1977). The measures of self-esteem, optimism and control were highly correlated. 
Furthermore, each variable accounted for no more than 20% of the variance in self-efficacy but all 
three variables together accounted for 27%. This led Cozzarelli to conclude that optimism, self-
esteem and control were similar constructs.  However, as the measures used in this study were 
different to those used by Carifo and Rhodes (2002), it is difficult to compare results. 
Luthans et al. (2007a) concurred that although the four factors of Hope, Optimism, Self-Efficacy and 
Resilience are individual components in themselves, there are relationships between them; for 
instance, individuals with high self-efficacy demonstrated greater resilience (Bandura, 1997), and 
individuals with high hope showed more self-efficacy and resilience (Snyder et al., 1991). It was 
hypothesised that together the variables create a higher order factor of Psychological Capital.  
To test this hypothesis, Luthans et al. (2007a) used an online survey with four samples: sample 1: 167 
management students (average age 22.5 years, SD=1.41), sample 2: 404 management students from 
a different university (average age 21.10 years, SD=2.66); sample 3: 115 engineers and technicians of 
average age 44.83 (SD=7.31 and sample 4: 144 employees of an insurance services firm, average age 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  76 
33.79 (SD=10.85). The measures used were Snyders State Hope scale (1996), LOT, Parkers Self-
Efficacy scale (1998) and Wagnild and Youngs (1993) Resilience scale. To ensure each variable had 
equal weight, the best 6 items from each of the measures were selected by a research group 
(Luthans email, 2017) and reworded to ensure they were state-like and workplace relevant. Each 
measure had a 6 point Likert-type scale (strongly disagree  strongly agree). This formed the 
Psychological Capital Questionnaire (PCQ: See Appendix E). Cronbach alphas for each adapted 
measure across the four samples were: hope .72, .75, .80, .76; optimism .74, .69, .76, .79; self-
efficacy .75, .84, .85, .75 and resilience .71, .71, .66, .72. For the entire Psychological Capital 
questionnaire alphas were .88, .89, .89, and .89 which Luthans et al. felt mitigated the poor results 
for optimism and resilience in their second and third samples.  
A Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) using maximum likelihood estimation was performed on the 
student and employee data separately. One, three and four factor models were tested (see table 
2.16).  The four-factor model demonstrated 
the strongest fit. This suggested that the four 
variables of hope, optimism, self-efficacy and 
resilience together formed the higher order 
model of Psychological Capital. 
However, the model for Self-Efficacy + 
Resilience, Optimism and Hope was omitted 
from the three factor models tested. Given 
the literature concerning the relationship 
between self-efficacy and resilience, this omission is surprising.  
The statistical reliability of Psychological Capital as a construct has been challenged. Studies by other 
researchers on Psychological Capital show less positive results. For instance, a large South African 
study by which surveyed 1749 participants found that the Cronbach alpha value for optimism was a 
low  (Grobler & Joubert, 2018). This the researchers attributed to the two reverse scoring items in 
the optimism scale.  Additionally, a CFA using the four components of Psychological Capital did not 
demonstrate a conclusively strong model fit.  
Similarly, Lorenz et al. (2016) found that when testing the Psychological Capital model, their CFA 
results also fell short of the acceptable levels, finding that instead their own trait based Compound 
Psychological Capital Scale produced a better fit.  However, Lorenz et al. deviated from Luthans 
Psychological Capital model by using different measures for self-efficacy and resilience.

The self-report nature of the PCQ has been criticised on the basis of the risk of common method 
variance (CMV) and social desirability response bias (Dawkins & Martin, 2013; Hackman, 2009; 
Newman et al., 2014). Clearly, the same criticism could be levelled at other self-report measures: it is 
a common limitation of many research studies. To address this, increasingly, research using the PCQ 
involves reports from others such as team colleagues, managers and subordinates (Avey, Wernsing 
& Luthans, 2008; Hmieleski & Carr, 2007; Petersen & Youssef-Morgan, 2018) or longitudinal studies 
(Luthans et al., 2010; 2013).  
Luthans and Church designed the Psychological Capital model to represent human resource 
strengths and psychological capacities that can be measured, developed, and effectively managed for 
performance improvement in today's workplace (2002 p.59). However, todays workplace has 
changed, and this has altered the demands on employees. Perhaps then the psychological capacities 
needed to maintain performance have changed too. One such capacity that may be essential today is 
cognitive flexibility. 
2.4 Cognitive Flexibility 
The rapid and IT driven change that organisational environments are exposed to (Haskel & Martin, 
2001; Schuler et al., 2011) require new competencies (Hobfoll 2002; Kark & Carmeli 2009; Rich, 
2010). Employees need to be able to adapt and innovate at speeds that confound the competition 
(Pulakos et al., 2000; Ryff & Singer, 2003, Collins & Smith 2006).  Creative behaviours are essential 
for addressing new and changing demands in the workplace (Kark & Carmeli 2009 p.787) in addition 
to the ability to create, analyse and transform information (Greenspan 1997 p.4). If the Psychological 
Capital model aims to represent the psychological capacities (Luthans & Church 2002 p.59) needed 
for workplace performance, then perhaps these new capabilities should be reflected. It seems that to 
be resilient in an ever-changing environment employee adaptation is key; the ability to change ones 
mental paradigm to embrace, rather than resist, change.  Resources such as control, hardiness, open-
mindedness, learning orientation, and curiosity (Kobasa, 1979; Good, 2009; Lepine, Colquitt & Erez 
2000; van Dam, 2013; Navarro, Newell & Schulze, 2016) have been cited as key personal resources 
for adaptation. However, a key resource proposed to enable performance in todays environment is 
cognitive flexibility. This section will firstly define what is meant by cognitive flexibility, then explore 
the research findings relevant to VUCA environments and finally, its potential role as part of the 
Psychological Capital model.

2.4.1 Defining Cognitive Flexibility  
Definitions of cognitive flexibility, fluid cognitive ability and cognitive agility refer to the ability to 
change thinking in order to adapt (see table 2.17). 
The cognitive agility model was developed by Good (2009) to support real time fast-changing 
environments in which adaptive and dynamic decision making was required; a context in which 
change, novelty and ambiguity and complexity were prevalent (Brehmer, 1992; Good, 2009). In later 
works he refers to this as ambidexterity (Good & Michel, 2013). While this model refers to the 
components of cognitive flexibility, it has chosen to use the term cognitive agility; drawing from 
the definition of agility: to move quickly or think quickly and easily.  
Despite Goods choice to use the term agility, for the purpose of this dissertation, the term cognitive 
flexibility will be used for three reasons. Firstly in recent times the term agile has been adopted by 
the Project Management community, particularly in the context of software and digital 
Table 2.17 Summary of Definitions of Cognitive Agility, Cognitive Flexibility and Fluid Cognitive Ability

S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  79 
transformation. Secondly, the cognitive flexibility model refers to two components, each of which are 
defined as types of flexibility, specifically reactive flexibility and spontaneous flexibility, thus is seems 
appropriate to refer to cognitive flexibility. Finally, it is possible that cognitive agility is the 
consequence of cognitive flexibility.  
Before investigating the role that cognitive flexibility may play in Psychological Capital, each of these 
types of cognitive flexibility will be explored.  
2.4.2 Reactive Flexibility 
Reactive Cognitive flexibility refers to an individuals willingness and capability to change their focus 
of attention and consciously choose behaviours rather 
than just responding habitually (Eslinger & Grattan, 1993; 
Shipstead, Harrison & Engle, 2016). 
To achieve this, having identified a need to change, 
individuals need to firstly inhibit any previously learnt 
responses or reactions (Schmitt, Borzillo & Probst, 2011). 
A second process requires shifting attention to the 
relevant tasks or demands (Miyake et al., 2000) and 
finally a process of unlearning needs to take place; 
discarding old irrelevant information and retaining the 
new relevant information (De Meuse, 2010; Dajani & 
Uddin, 2015; Schmitt et al., 2011: see figure 2.3) In doing 
so, individuals can channel their focus and control 
priorities (Posner, 1980). Of course there is a risk here of 
throwing the baby out with the bath water by assuming that new learning is better than old 
knowledge (Brook et al., 2016). However if one adopts Antonacopoulous (2009) perspective that 
unlearning is a process of asking new questions that embrace the unknown (p.428) then this will 
enable employees to identify difference, manage responses and recognise the need to adapt and 
shift attention as needed (Van Dam, 2013).  
However, in itself, recognising there is a need to focus elsewhere or adapt is meaningless (Ionescu, 
2012). Having recognised a need to inhibit habitual thinking and do something different, the 
employee now needs to generate new solutions using uninhibited thinking.  Research by Star and 
Seifert (2006) on the flexible solver (flexible problem solving) is particularly relevant for VUCA 
environment. It refers to being able to identify both many and diverse solutions to new problems 
Figure 2.3 Diagram illustrating the 
process of reactive flexibility as described

Rende (2000) and Schmitt et al., (2011),

(Eslinger et al., 1993; Ionescu, 2012; Rende, 2000; Star & Siefert, 2006). This requires Spontaneous 
Flexibility.  
2.4.3 Spontaneous Flexibility 
Where reactive flexibility enables focus, spontaneous flexibility enables the reinterpretation of 
information in a new mental context to create multiple and diverse solutions (Shipstead et al., 
2016 p.784). Good (2009) refers to this as Cognitive Openness (see figure 2.4).  
2.4.3.1 Cognitive Openness 
Openness is usually associated with the Big Five personality trait Openness to Experience 
(Costa & McCrae, 1995), which itself is described in many ways;  as intellect (Fiske,1949), 
the need for variety (Maddi & Berne, 1964), absorption (Tellegen & Aitkinson, 1974), 
sensation seeking (Zuckerman, 1984), intellectance 
[sic] (Hogan, 1986) and culture (Tupes & Christal, 
1992). Consequently Good (2009) seeks to 
differentiate the personality trait of Openness to 
Experience from the construct of Cognitive 
Openness. Defined as the process of gathering 
new information (2009, p.14), cognitive openness 
requires firstly a wide breadth of perceptual 
attention (2009, p.15) to ensure data or stimuli 
are not overlooked (Mendelsohn, 1976). Secondly 
it involves conceptual attention, i.e. a willingness 
to follow new threads of data (Good, 2009 p.15). 
These, Good argues, require creativity and 
curiosity, underpinned by divergent thinking.  
2.4.3.2 Divergent Thinking  
Divergent thinking is defined as the ability to generate multiple novel problem solutions or 
ideas (Guilford, 1950; Parkhurst, 1999; Wallach & Kogan, 1965). Similarly, creativity is 
defined as the ability to produce novel and appropriate solutions to problems (Amabile, 
1982; Benedek et al., 2014; Guilford, 1950). These two processes have been associated with 
each other (Baer, 1996; McCrae, 1987; Scratchley & Hakstian, 2001; Wallach & Kogan, 
1965).

process of spontaneous flexibility as

Research in schoolchildren suggests that divergent thinking involves cognitive processes 
that can lead to creativity (Wallace & Kogan, 1965). For instance, Plucker (1999) used 
structural equation modelling to reanalyse data from Torrances (1992) elementary school 
longitudinal study. Measures of divergent thinking and intelligence in children were used to 
predict their creative achievement as adults. Results showed that the path co-efficient from 
divergent thinking to creative achievement was three times larger than from intelligence. 
However, in a similar study developing creativity in 157 12 year old school children, the 
divergent thinking tasks did increase creativity, but only in the tasks relevant to the 
divergent thinking training, in this case, poetry writing (Baer, 1996). 
The rationale that divergent thinking is synonymous with creativity remains controversial 
(Kim et al., 2008). It has been suggested that creativity is made up of both divergent 
thinking and convergent thinking (Guilford, 1950; Nusbaum & Silvia, 2011). Indeed, the 
creative process is considered to be a result of attentional control; executive functions 
managing interference (Nusbaum et al., 2011). Gillhooly et al. (2007) in research with 102 
students, two groups performed the Alternative Uses test; a silent group and a thinking 
aloud group. The outputs from each group were broadly similar. Analysis of the thinking 
aloud group, demonstrated that fluency (quantity) of output was determined by memory 
while novelty was determined by the strategy of disassembly (disassembling the item and 
reusing or recombining parts). This suggested that the process of creativity began with early 
memory recollection and only once automatic retrievals were exhausted did participants 
switch to novelty producing strategies. As such, those with greater executive capacity 
produced more new ideas.  
Vincent, Decker, & Mumford, (2002) used structural modelling to determine the 
relationship between divergent thinking, intelligence, expertise, idea generation and idea 
implementation (N=110). In their final model, intelligence and expertise contributed to 
divergent thinking. In turn, both divergent thinking and expertise contributed to idea-
generation. This suggests that rather than being synonymous with creativity, divergent 
thinking represents one aspect of creativity. One interpretation of these analyses is that 
divergent thinking indicates a potential for originality, a key, but not unitary component of 
creativity (Cropley, 2000; Runco & Acar, 2012).  
It should be noted that many of the tests used to assess test creativity are also used for 
divergent thinking (Cropley, 2000; Runco & Acar, 2012; Silva, Martin & Nausbaum, 2009). 
The measures often relying on subjective views of creativity.  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  82 
Creativity was rejected by Luthans et al. (2007b), as a possible component of Psychological 
Capital since it was deemed an outcome of the integration of multiple constructs and 
therefore difficult to define and measure; a criterion for Psychological Capital inclusion. The 
process of divergent thinking may lead to novel ideas but not necessarily translate into 
creative behaviour (Guilford 1950; Cropley 2000; Runco & Acar, 2012. This would therefore 
fail to meet the criteria of providing tangible results and quantifiable performance 
outcomes (Youssef-Morgan, 2014 p.132). 
Cognitive openness also requires an attitude of curiosity in that the individual is open to 
and seeks new information and novelty (Bishop, et al., 2004; Bodner, 2000; Langer, 1989; 
Pirson et al., 2012; Sternberg, 2000). Curiosity leads to broader environmental scanning 
(Weick & Sutcliffe, 2006 p.516) expanding information searches to beyond known data to 
that which is new. In turn this can lead to the development of multiple perspectives 
resulting in diverse solutions and alternatives (Fiol & OConnor, 2003; Good, 2009; Langer & 
Moldoveanu, 2000; Runco & Acar, 2012). In the context of cognitive flexibility, openness 
does not refer to a personality dimension, but a way of thinking that encompasses novelty 
and curiosity. 
2.4.3.3 Attentional Control 
Together, reactive and spontaneous flexibility form Cognitive Flexibility (see figure 2.5), 
whereby individuals are able to, on the one 
hand, exercise purposeful attentional control, 
focusing on the relevant and specific stimuli 
whilst on the other maintaining  a broad span 
of attention to be open to new information 
and novelty. Together these abilities enable 
the generation of relevant and novel 
solutions. However, in environments 
perceived as challenging, exercising such 
attentional control may not be easy.  
Early theories as to why this is derive from 
the premise that humans have two core 
motivations; the first is a defensive system to 
minimise threats, the second an appetitive 
system to maximize reward (Bradley, 2009; Cacioppo, Gardner & Bernston, 1999; Lang, 
Figure 2.5 Diagram illustrating the relationship 
between Spontaneous and Reactive Flexibility and 
their components as described by Good (2009) 
and Rende (2000) 
University of Reading

1995; Rock, 2008).  Research suggests that we are hard-wired to place greater attention on 
threat stimuli as a survival mechanism (Derryberry & Reed, 2002b; hman, 2007; Rock, 
2008). This attentional bias (AB) has been researched primarily in the context of mental 
health issues such as anxiety, PTSD and depression (Bar-Haim et al., 2007; Bar-Haim et al., 
2010; Broomfield & Turpin, 2005; Derryberry & Reed, 2002b; Eysenck et al., 2007).  Bar-
Haim et al., (2007) performed a meta-analysis of 172 studies of attentional bias to threat 
and anxiety. Across all studies, the combined effect size of threat-related bias, measured 
using the emotional Stroop, probe detection (or dot-probe) task, or a version of the 
emotional spatial cuing task was significant in anxious participants but not in non-anxious 
participants.  A later study by Bar-Haim et al. (2010) with 131 Israelis living within rocket 
range of the Gaza strip, assessed threat bias using a dot probe task and situational stress, 
measured as time to seek shelter in the event of a rocket attack. Results showed that 
situational stress increased attentional bias. 
However, recently, this premise has been questioned. The attentional bias to threat has 
been shown to diminish when cognitive resources are being deployed on goal relevant 
tasks (Pessoa et al., 2002; Vogt et al., 2013; Yates, Ashwin & Fox, 2010). In one study to test 
the effect of stimuli on aversive and appetitive attention a loud noise was used as the 
unpleasant outcome and a money reward as the pleasant outcome (Austin & Duka, 2010). 
Students attention was measured using eye tracking. Results showed a main effect of 
stimulus with attentional bias being greater for pleasant stimuli compared with unpleasant 
stimuli. Similarly, Vogt et al. (2013) demonstrated that attention was deployed to pictures 
that were relevant to a goal rather than to pictures that were threatening or neutral. This 
finding was replicated in both non-anxious participants and those high in trait anxiety, as 
measured by the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al., 1983). 
Although these studies were small they do suggest that in focusing cognitive resource 
capacity on goal achievement, the tendency to become distracted by threat responses 
reduced, unless the threat was relevant to the task-goal (Hahn & Gronlund, 2007; Stein et 
al., 2009).   This was even the case in high-anxiety individuals (Vogt et al., 2013). 
Furthermore, Peers and Lawrence (2009), used neutral or threatening affective stimuli 
finding that individuals with high attentional control were able to regulate their attentional 
responses and so did not demonstrate attentional bias to threat. However a closer look at 
the sample size and effect were small.  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  84 
Although these findings are weak, they support those of Derryberry et al. (2002b): 
individuals with the ability to overcome an automatic attentional response in favour of a 
considered response are less biased towards negative events thereby creating resilience. 
Genet and Siemer (2011) tested 59 students to measure the relationship between cognitive 
flexibility, as measured by a task switching exercise, and resilience. A regression analysis 
suggested that cognitive flexibility significantly predicted resilience scores.  
Although it could be argued that the threats of angry faces or loud noises in these 
experiments are not comparable with the threat of job changes or job loss, they do suggest 
that individuals are able to focus on goal achievement rather than threat.  Attentional 
control involves both automatic (bottom up) and controlled (top down) cognitive processes 
which enable attention to be shifted and focused as required.  Doing so may enable the 
management of attentional bias to perceived threat.  Good (2009) suggests that the 
successful attentional control that comes from reactive and spontaneous flexibility could be 
what has now been popularised as mindfulness.  
2.4.3.4 Mindfulness 
There are multiple definitions of mindfulness and for each there are both protagonists and 
opponents. The aim here is not to debate these but rather to define mindfulness in the 
context of cognitive flexibility as defined above. There are two elements upon which 
researchers agree. The first is that mindfulness, in any model, involves purposeful 
attentional control or regulation (Langer & Moldoveanu, 2000; Sternberg, 2000; Bishop et 
al.,  2004; Wieck & Sutcliffe, 2006; Brown, Ryan & Cresswell, 2007; Evans, Baer, & 
Segerstrom, 2009; Pirson et al., 2012). In a study to test the impact of mindfulness training 
on attentional control, 40 participants attended a 10 day meditation course. Half of these 
received additional mindfulness training (Chambers, Lo & Allen, 2008).  Each group was 
tested before and 7-10 days after course completion. Measures included the self-report 
Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS- Brown & Ryan, 2003) and an Internal 
Switching Task designed to test reaction time, attention and switching effects. The 
mindfulness group showed improved performance on the MAAS and internal switching 
task. This mirrored the findings of Jha, Krompinger and Baime (2007) who compared three 
groups: one attending an 8 week mindfulness training (N=17), a group attending a months 
meditation retreat and a control group (N=17). Attentional control was measured before 
and after events using the Attention Network Test (Fan et al., 2002). Results showed that 
the mindfulness training group improved their voluntary attentional selection. However, a 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  85 
similar study of an 8 week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program, although 
demonstrating an increase in self-reported mindfulness and wellbeing failed to 
demonstrate any changes in attentional control relative to the control group (Anderson, et 
al., 2007). Of course one of the challenges with Mindfulness is the nature of the measures 
which are based on self-report. 
The second element upon which researchers agree is that mindfulness requires curiosity in 
that the individual is open to new information and novelty (Langer, 1989; Sternberg, 2000; 
Bodner, 2000; Bishop et al., 2004; Pirson et al., 2012).  Theories of Western based 
mindfulness relate to conscious information processing (Krieger, 2005 p.137), learning to 
switch modes of thinking, noticing new things and disrupting routines (Weick & Sutcliffe, 
2006 p.516). Langer (1989) refers to this as not being mindless (p.7), Wenk-Sormaz (2005) 
as deautomatization [sic] of habitual responses (p.43). 
Levinthal & Rerup (2006) point out that mindfulness is about being able to respond to 
diverse, changing stimuli resulting in the conversion of experience into reconfigurations 
as assumptions, frameworks and actions (p.505, p.507). This requires the ability to be 
engaged sufficiently with your environment to notice changes, to be able to produce new 
and novel solutions through exploration (Langer, 1989; Yeganeh, 2006) rather than merely 
exploiting existing sources of knowledge or experience.   
2.4.4 Cognitive Flexibility and VUCA 
In the context of the VUCA organisation, the drive to explore the new is key to being able to enable 
innovation and adaptation for the future (Laureiro-Martnez, Brusoni, & Zollo, 2010; OReilly III & 
Tushman, 2011). To do so will require openness and divergent thinking (spontaneous flexibility). 
However, concurrently, leaders also need to exploit existing (usually limited) resources to maximise 
efficiency (reactive flexibility). In doing so, leaders are able to shift avenues of thought and action in 
order to perceive, process, or respond to situations in different ways (Eslinger & Grattan, 1993 
p.17). Thus cognitive flexibility has been associated with individual adaptability (Ionescu, 2012; 
OReilly 2013; Stawski et al., 2010). 
Good (2009) developed an online game Network Fire Chief (NFC) to test dynamic adaptive 
performance. Participants (N=181 undergraduates) in a study by Good and Michel (2013) were ask to 
put out online fires using the resources they had. Fire location and resources changed throughout 
the game, requiring individuals to adapt their performance and strategy. Cognitive agility was 
measured using the Alternative Uses test (for a brick or a paper clip) to test divergent thinking, the 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  86 
Go/No go paradigm to test focused attention (McClure, Gilzenrat & Cohen, 2005), crystallised and 
fluid intelligence as measured by a vocabulary test and card rotations test respectively and finally the 
Stroop test to measure cognitive flexibility. Divergent thinking, focused attention and cognitive 
flexibility all correlated positively with adaptive performance.  Regression analysis using Adaptive 
performance as the dependant variable indicated that measures Divergent Thinking explained 3.0% 
and Cognitive flexibility showed 6.0% unique variance over and above the measures of intelligence. 
The findings suggest that although intelligence was the largest predictor of adaptive performance, 
cognitive flexibility also contributed.  
Good & Michels (2013) study found that focused attention accounted for 2% of the variance in 
adaptive performance. The self-regulatory processes of cognitive flexibility, such as inhibiting and 
refocusing attention has been cited as necessary to enable performance related behaviour change 
(Ferris et al., 2011; Vohs et al., 2008).  In a large adult study by Stawski et al. (2010) participants who 
had taken part in a health and well-being survey in the US kept a daily diary of positive and negative 
moods for 8 days. Fluid Cognitive Ability (FCA) was assessed using the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by 
Telephone (BTACT, Lachman & Tun, 2008) which measures key fluid cognitive domains including 
episodic verbal memory, working memory span and executive function, reasoning, and speed of 
processing. Results indicated that not only are individuals with higher levels of fluid cognitive ability 
more likely to report experiencing daily stressors but also the days on which they reported stressors 
were characterized by greater numbers of stressors than individuals with lower ability. However, 
despite this, high fluid cognitive ability moderated any negative mood. Stawski et al., (2010) posited 
that this may be due to those with high fluid cognitive ability being willing and/or able to take on 
more at work, thereby increasing the number of stressors. However their cognitive ability enabled 
them to manage any emotional response to these. This is supported by the results of a longitudinal 
study of 101 undergraduates that demonstrated successful adaptation was linked to emotional 
flexibility (Bonnano et al., 2004) Emotional flexibility accounted for 7% of the variance in distress at 
time 2. Other studies have also suggested that emotions can be controlled by exercising cognitive 
flexibility (Genet & Siemer, 2011; Pulakos et al., 2002).  
The ability to exercise cognitive control and deal with stressors is what is thought to stop the threat 
response from compromising adaptability (Monsell, Sumner & Waters, 2003). Environments whereby 
problems are new or ill-defined and existing knowledge needs to be reappraised, cognitive flexibility 
may be of an advantage (Davis, Eisenhardt & Bingham, 2009; Good, 2009; Good & Michel, 2013). 
Therefore, perhaps given todays organisations, cognitive flexibility should be considered as one of 
the psychological resources necessary for performance.

2.4.5 Cognitive Flexibility  Meeting the POB Criteria 
To be included in the Psychological Capital model, Cognitive Flexibility will need to meet the POB 
criteria in that it must reflect a positive state, be grounded in theory, state like (develop-able) and be 
work related. This section looks at each of the three aspects of cognitive flexibility: attentional 
control, divergent thinking and mindfulness in the context of the POB criteria. 
2.4.5.1 Attentional Control 
As discussed above, the ability to control ones attention has been shown to help manage 
emotion (Derryberry et al., 2002b; Stawski et al., 2010) and anxiety (see Appendix G for a 
summary of studies of attentional control on anxiety). Although Derryberry & Reed (2002b) 
posit that there is a general personality dimension representing sensitivity to threat 
(p.232), training interventions on attentional control have shown to be beneficial for anxiety 
training. Gillham et al., (2007) carried out a longitudinal study to assess the impact of six 90 
minute cognitive behavioural training sessions on depression and anxiety for 22 children, a 
further 22 children were the control group. All children were tested with the Childrens 
Depression Inventory (CDI: Kovacs, 2001)and the Revised Childrens Manifest Anxiety Scale 
(RCMAS; Reynolds & Richmond,1985), 1 month prior to the intervention then 2 weeks (post-
intervention), 6 months and 12 months following the intervention. ANCOVAs showed that 
the effect of the training sessions on depression was not significant at 2 weeks after the 
event, but was significant at the 6 month and 12-month followups. Similarly, ANOVA 
revealed that the effect of the training sessions on anxiety was not significant at 2 weeks 
post-assessment but was at the 6 month and 12-month followups.  
Further studies with adult populations have demonstrated that the ability to recognise and 
manage emotion through attentional control can improve wellbeing at work (Buruck et al., 
2016).  In this study, 45 nursing home staff took part in emotional regulation training of 8-9 
sessions of 1.5 hours each, which consisted of attentional awareness, modification of 
emotion and acceptance of emotions when required. Emotion Regulation Skill Questionnaire 
(ERSQ, German version: Berking & Znoj, 2008) and the Well-being Index (WHO-Five et al., 
2003) were used as measures. A control group of 44 who did not complete the workshop 
also completed the measures. Measures were taken pre-workshop and 6 months post-
workshop. A repeated measure MANCOVA demonstrated that performance on emotion-
regulation and well-being showed significant Time x Group effect. The nurses who were 
trained demonstrated greater emotion-regulation skills and well-being after training when 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  88 
compared to the control group. It should be noted however, that the small effect size is likely 
the result of the low completion rate at t2 for both the test group and the control group. 
These findings suggest that attentional control is state like, developable and creates a 
positive state for the individual. If as Vogt et al. (2013) suggest, attentional focus is less about 
attentional bias to threat and more goal dependant, then a change of goal may mean a 
change of attentional focus thereby also suggesting that attentional control is state like.  
Attentional control has also been shown to be relevant to the workplace: Research has 
shown the contribution of attentional control to adaptive performance and resilience (Genet 
et al., 2011; Good, 2009; Good et al., 2013) Therefore, attentional control appears to meet 
the POB criteria. 
2.4.5.2 Divergent Thinking 
The most common test for divergent thinking is the Alternative Uses test (Batey et al., 2009; 
Brophy, 2001; Gilhooly et al., 2007; McCrae, 1987; Nausbaum et al., 2011) which is also used 
for creativity measures, despite, as discussed above, divergent thinking being only one of the 
elements of creativity. There are few studies on the extent to which divergent thinking can 
be developed over time, however there are for creativity.   
Scott, Leritz and Mumford (2004), suggest that evidence accrued over the last 50 years does 
suggest that divergent thinking, as assessed through open-ended tests  does represent a 
distinct capacity contributing to both creative problem solving and many forms of creative 
performance  (p.363) but concede that divergent thinking is only one component of creative 
thought.  
In an assessment of three creativity courses in the UK public sector (Birdi, 2005), 71 
participants were asked 3 questions about their improvement in work-related idea 
generation as well as questions concerning the management and divisional support for 
innovation. The participants were also asked to describe in their own words the impact of the 
training.  Regression analysis showed the strongest predictor of improvements in idea 
generation was the number of workshops that were attended, irrespective of grade or 
tenure. There is a lot to fault with this study. There was no before and after measure 
therefore participants were comparing themselves retrospectively, nor was there a control 
group.   
A meta-analysis of 70 studies of creativity training found that the largest contributors to 
creativity training were divergent thinking and problem solving (Scott et al., 2004). 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  89 
Furthermore, that creativity training was effective in both academic and organisational 
settings. From this evidence, it was concluded divergent thinking can be developed through 
well designed training courses, in particular those that focus on analysis of novel and ill-
defined problems that are structured and task-relevant (Wallach & Kogan, 1965). 
These studies suggest that divergent thinking is developable and beneficial for the workplace 
thereby meeting the criteria of POB. Measurement of divergent thinking may prove more 
challenging. As McCrae observes divergent thinking measures cannot be objectively scored 
(McCrae, 1987 p.1260). However, indirect measures may be possible.  Benedek et al. (2012) 
found that cognitive control, measured by means of  a Random Motor Generation test,  
facilitated the fluent generation of new ideas  as measured by five divergent thinking tests to 
test idea fluency and originality (N=104). Structural Equation modelling demonstrated that 
the relationship between inhibition and divergent thinking was mediated by intelligence. This 
was attributed to the need to suppress irrelevant information and focus on the relevant. 
Thus, measures of cognitive control may also contribute to divergent thinking. 
2.4.5.3 Mindfulness  
Mindfulness training has become popular over the last few years:  a search for mindfulness + 
training + uk on google produced 28 400 000 results. Considered a form of self-regulation 
(Evans, Baer & Segerstrom, 2000), being mindful (as opposed to mindless), increases 
awareness and engagement with the environment (Polak, 2009).  This enables individuals to 
be cognisant of changes in their situation and adaptively respond (Langer, 1989; Weick & 
Quinn, 1999).    
Often, mindfulness studies are conducted in the context of Mindfulness Based Stress 
Reduction (MBSR) programs, operationalised using meditation (Lindsey & Cresswell, 2017).  
However, as observed above, for every study that finds a positive impact of mindfulness on 
attentional control (Chambers, Lo & Allen, 2008; Jha, Krompinger & Baime, 2007; Moore & 
Malinowski, 2009) there are those that did not: Research has demonstrated that although 
participants had a greater sense of wellbeing and awareness as a result of mindfulness 
through meditation there was no evidence of improvement in attentional control following 
meditation training (Anderson et al., 2007; Polak, 2009). Not all mindfulness training is 
meditation based. Programs and training courses such as the Monitoring and Awareness 
Training that focuses participants to attitude and behavioural choices also train attentional 
control (Lindsey & Cresswell, 2017).

In terms of the POB criteria, it seems that there is a positive benefit of being mindful, 
although, as will be discussed in the Methods section, measurement of mindfulness is usually 
self-reported. If mindfulness is a form of attentional control, as discussed above, this has 
been shown to be develop-able.  
2.4.5.4 Cognitive Flexibility  
Attentional control, divergent thinking and mindfulness are mechanisms to operationalise 
cognitive flexibility which, as discussed above, has been shown to enable positive behaviours 
such as adaptability, novel thinking and the ability to deal with situational demands (Caas, 
Fajardo & Salmerton, 2006).  
The state like nature of cognitive flexibility may be surmised from experiments that suggest 
mood impacts cognitive flexibility. Murray, Sujan, Hirt and Sujan, (1990) tested the 
performance of 41 undergraduates on a similarities and differences tests after instigating a 
positive or neutral mood by focusing on positive or neutral statements. Positive mood 
participants, as compared with neutral mood participants, performed better in the 
similarities and differences tasks.  Dreisbach and Goschke (2004) supported these findings. In 
their study, 32 undergraduates rated their mood at the beginning of the experiment and 
again at the end of the experiment. Performance on a task was measured using letter and 
digit categorisation requiring focus on specific stimuli and switching between stimuli to 
focusing on new stimuli. Results showed a significant increase in the reaction times for the 
neutral group compared to the positive affect group and a significant three-way interaction 
of affect, interval, and switch condition, suggesting that affect impacts cognitive flexibility. 
This supported their hypothesis that positive affect leads to increased cognitive flexibility. 
However Schwarz (2002) argues that positive feelings are a reflection of our environment, in 
that when we feel safe we are more likely to take risks, experiment and explore. However, 
irrespective of the source of positive feelings, affect appears to impact cognitive flexibility, 
therefore we can conclude that it is state-like.  
Finally, as discussed above, the constructs of attentional control, divergent thinking and 
mindfulness can be developed and trained each of which contributes to cognitive flexibility. 
As with Goods (2009) work recent experiments using video games have demonstrated that 
cognitive flexibility is trainable.  Glass, Maddox and Love, 2013 demonstrated that 40 hours 
of gaming on an online strategy game, increased cognitive flexibility (as measured by ANT, 
Stroop test, task switching and operating span tests) compared with a control group (Bayes 
factor of 6.77).   
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  91 
Whether taken as a whole, or as individual components, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that 
Cognitive Flexibility has a state-like element and is developable, thereby meeting the criteria for 
Psychological Capital. 
2.4.6 Cognitive Flexibility and Psychological Capital 
The nature of the VUCA environment has, I believe, made the inclusion of Cognitive Flexibility into 
the Psychological Capital model critical as it may strengthen each of the other resources. Attentional 
control provides an ability to focus on the relevant and to switch focus as the environment dictates, 
which may be useful for Hope, Optimism and Self Efficacy (see figure 2.6) 
 Awareness of changes in the environment enables a decision about whether to adopt an exploit or 
explore approach to goal achievement (Caas, Quesada & Fajardo, 2003; Frith, 2013). When 
problems are ill defined or solutions are not immediately clear, identifying and seeking novelty could 
support finding new goal pathways in Hope. Being able to identify new solutions and manage 
emotions may support self-efficacy beliefs through emotion management.

Overall the ability to allocate and control cognitive resources flexibility and efficiently (Glass et al., 
2013) may result in greater resilience as one becomes more mindful of the environment and any 
subsequent affective responses (Anderson et al., 2007).  Optimism may improve cognitive flexibility 
through the creation of positive affect (Dreisbach & Goschke, 2004; Isen, 2000; Nijstad et al., 2010). 
The role of experience and knowledge that can result in self-efficacy has been shown to be key to 
divergent thinking (Batey, Chamorro-Premuzic and Furnham, 2009; Caas et al., 2006).   
Innovative and adaptive behaviours are essential for addressing new and changing demands in the 
workplace (Kark & Carmeli, 2009 p.787) in addition to the ability to create, analyse and transform 
information (Greenspan, 1997 p.4). If the Psychological Capital model aims to represent the 
psychological capacities (Luthans & Church, 2002 p.59) needed for workplace performance, then 
perhaps Cognitive Flexibility should be included. 
2.5 Psychological Capital: Old Wine, New Bottles? 
Psychological Capital is not without its critics. 
Hackman (2009) argues that the POB movement has failed to recognise the concept is not new. As 
far back as 1947, Haldane wrote of the importance of aligning employee attributes to the job in 
order to improve productivity.  Hackman (2009) argues that the new concept of POB is actually 
grounded in historical research. In fairness, Luthans & Church (2002) do not argue that Psychological 
Capital is a novel idea, instead explaining that it leverages existing research and measures.  
Nevertheless, they maintain that the construct of Psychological Capital is an addition to the field. 
However, Dawkins and Martin (2013) argue that Psychological Capital replicates Judge and Bonos 
Core Self Evaluation (CSE) model (2001). Like Luthans Psychological Capital model, Judge and Bonos 
model consists of four measurable and unique traits to form a higher order construct of CSE which is 
defined as the assessments that people make about their worthiness, competence and 
capabilities(Judge et al., 2005, p.257).   The construct is made up of: self-esteem, generalised self-
efficacy, locus of control and emotional stability (low neuroticism).  
Psychological Capital has been found to have a strong, positive correlation with CSE (Luthans et al., 
2007a). Luthans et al. (2007a) also claimed that Psychological Capital predicted a unique variance in 
job satisfaction beyond that of CSE. However results show that when Psychological Capital was 
added to the regression analysis after CSE, the change was small. A subsequent longitudinal study 
(N=174 students) measuring Psychological Capital and CSE three times at 7-10 day intervals ( T1, T2 
and T3) demonstrated both commonalities and differences between the two constructs.  The 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  93 
commonalities in components within each construct have also been noted by Dawkins and Martin 
(2013). Specifically, they identify overlaps between locus of control and optimism, emotional stability 
and resilience and general self-efficacy and self-efficacy.   
CSE: Locus of control  
Locus of control is often assumed to be synonymous with self-efficacy however this is a 
misconception (Stajkovic et al., 1998b). Locus of control is a cause-and-consequence belief 
system which relates to the extent to which your actions will influence an outcome (Bosman & 
Buitendach, 2005; Stajkovic et al., 1998b). Optimism is a belief that a good outcome will occur 
although in this case does not attribute this to ones own behaviour.  However, Hope refers to 
the agency and pathways to a goal. Combined, optimism and hope create a belief that the goal 
can and will be achieved and self-efficacy adds to the belief that one has the ability to achieve 
the goal. Thus, these concepts are related in some ways. Research supports this, for instance  
Bosman and Buidentendach (2005) in their study of 603 employees from 2 financial services 
organisations in South Africa, found a moderate positive correlation of between the Optimism 
(LOT-R) and the Work Locus of Control Scale (Spector, 1988).  
CSE: Emotional Stability  
The emotional stability component of the CSE model has been described as representing the 
trait of Neurotisicm (Ferris et al., 2011; Judge et al., 2002; Stajkovic, 2006) and as such is 
considered trait based (Judge & Bono, 2001; Judge et al., 2003; Stajkovic, 2006). Indeed, Costa 
and McCrae (1992) suggested that it was largely heritable.  Emotional stability (Neuroticism) and 
resilience are related in the sense that those high in Neuroticism are more likely to hold a 
negative view of themselves and their resources and abilities (Bardoel et al., 2014; Ferris et al., 
2011; Judge et al., 2005). A study (N=282 undergraduates) to test the role of neuroticism, 
resilience and positive affect on life satisfaction supported this (Lui, Wang & Li, 2012). Results 
showed a moderate negative relationship between neuroticism and resilience, moderately 
positive relationship between trait resilience and positive affect and a moderately negative 
relationship between trait neuroticism and positive affect. The overall model showed a good fit. 
This suggests that, those with high neuroticism may have a reduced ability to be resilient, 
supporting Bonanno (2004) and Hobfoll (1989. 2002).  
However, neuroticism is trait like but resilience may also depend on how the situation and 
context is perceived and is therefore state-like. 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  94 
CSE: General Self-efficacy  
Finally, general self-efficacy and specific self-efficacy share a commonality in that they both 
concern an individuals belief in their ability. Initially the concept of self-efficacy was defined in 
relation to specific domains (Bandura, 1997; Hobfoll, 2002; Scholz et al., 2002; Sherer et al., 
1982) but this has since been broadened to a trait like sense of personal competence (Schwarzer 
& Jerusalem, 1995; Sherer et al., 1982). Scholz et al. (2002) measured general self-efficacy across 
25 countries and used their results to suggest that the scale is a universal construct. However, in 
Psychological Capital, self-efficacy can be domain specific and is defined as a measure of state. It 
is this that differentiates general self-efficacy and self-efficacy. And this is the key difference 
between CSE and Psychological Capital.  
CSE is, by definition, broad in scope. Its component traits reflect evaluations of the self in general 
rather than in a particular context or at a particular moment in time (Judge et al., 1998). As such they 
are stable. Research by Judge et al. (2000) showed that core self-evaluations measured in childhood 
correlated with job satisfaction some 30 years later. Therefore, CSE is not designed to be applied to a 
specific context since this would no longer measure core self-evaluation (Chang et al., 2012).  
Longitudinal studies demonstrated the greater stability of CSE than Psychological Capital over time 
(Luthans et al., 2007a, p.563). Peterson et al. (2011) found that Psychological Capital levels changed 
over a 7 month period.  However, the stability of core self-evaluations are not as strong as that of 
Costa & McCraes (1994) Big Five personality traits suggesting that there may be some part of CSE 
which is more state like.   
Essentially both models define a relationship to goals. CSE are considered to be antecedents to self-
concordant goals; it determines the nature of the goals that people choose (Judge et al., 2005). It 
provides the impetus for goal achievement. Ferris et al. (2011) describe this in the context of 
approach or avoid: we may have the same goals, we may have the same beliefs in our ability to 
execute the goals. However you may be doing so to gain something (approach), whereas I may be 
doing so to avoid any possible risks (avoid). Psychological Capital on the other hand, reflects the 
individuals beliefs about the execution of and the outcome of a specific, usually work-related goal.  
So, is Psychological Capital old wine in new bottles? I think rather it is old wine decanted from an 
old bottle, for use in a new and specific way.

2.6 Hypotheses 
As suggested above, organisations in fast moving VUCA environments may no longer be able to 
provide the stable mechanisms traditionally used to create Psychological Safety and an environment 
in which an individual would be willing to show and employ ones self without fear of negative 
consequences.  Therefore, perhaps organisations and employees should be looking to develop 
individual personal resources such as those in Kahns availability dimension (1990) so as to 
strengthen their own psychological capital.  This would be expected to lead to the development of 
the psychological resources to be able to show and employ ones self without fear of negative 
consequences (Kahn, 1990, p.708) 
This chapter has argued that in todays organisations, Psychological Safety is critical to employee 
performance in an environment in which dealing with the new and unknown, feeling safe to explore, 
innovate and even get things wrong is necessary to be able to remain competitive (Hill & Davies, 
2017; Luengo-Valderrey & Moso-Diez, 2017). Furthermore, given the increasing physical and 
emotional demands on employees, psychological resources are needed to be able to explore and 
innovate.  
The contribution that this research aims to add to the field is in the individual lens through which 
Psychological Safety is examined. Although it has been recognised that Psychological Safety is subject 
to individual perceptions (Baer & Frese, 2003; Carmeli & Gittel, 2009; Edmondson & Mogelof, 2006) 
most research on Psychological Safety has been in the context of groups and teams. As these become 
progressively more dispersed, remote and transient understanding the individuals role in the 
creation of Psychological Safety becomes increasingly important. The line between Kahns availability 
and Psychological Safety dimension is becoming blurred. 
This research does not seek to exonerate the organisation from continuing to provide mechanisms 
for engagement or Psychological Safety.  Kahns Meaningfulness dimension has been supported by 
many studies, particularly in the context of motivation (Hackman & Oldham, 1976; Herzberg, 
Mausner & Snyderman, 2005; Pink, 2009). The scope of this study is the intrinsic psychological 
resources of the employee.  
Hypothesis 1: Individual employees have a role to play in creating their own Psychological Safety. 
Hypothesis 2: Employees with higher levels of intrinsic psychological resources, as measured by 
Kahns Availability dimension and Luthans the Psychological Capital model, will have 
higher levels of Psychological Safety.  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  96 
Hypothesis 3: Resilience is redundant in the Psychological Capital model as Resilience is an output of 
Hope, Optimism and Self-efficacy. 
Hypothesis 4: Employees with higher levels of intrinsic psychological resources, as measured by 
Kahns Availability dimension and Luthans Psychological Capital model will have higher 
levels of Resilience 
Hypothesis 5: Cognitive Flexibility, a new component of Psychological Capital will replace resilience, 
creating a new model of Hope + Optimism + Self-Efficacy +Cognitive Flexibility. 
Hypothesis 6:  Given that both Resilience and Psychological Safety are hypothesised to be outputs of 
personal resources, there will be a positive relationship between Psychological Safety 
and Resilience 
Hypothesise 7: Interventions to develop personal resources will increase levels of Psychological 
Safety and Resilience. 
2.6.1 Proposed Model 
The following chapter will discuss the research strategy to test the above hypotheses and model.

3. Methodology 
3.1 Introduction 
The purpose of this research is to explore the construct of Psychological Safety by building upon 
existing models proposed by Kahn (1990), Edmondson (1999) and Luthans (2002).  In doing so, new 
cognitive phenomena are being explored thereby extending our knowledge of this issue. In 
particular, this thesis will consider Psychological Safety as a construct of the individual not the team. 
The research aims to explore the psychological resources needed by an individual for Psychological 
Safety.  
Given the psychosocial aspect of this research, multiple methodologies are recommended (Clarke & 
Hoggett, 2018; Flick, 2004; Mathison, 1988; Modell, 2009). Quantitative measures may result in 
correlations and enable the application of statistical models, but do not provide deeper causal 
information (Modell, 2009). Meanings and values that drive responses to quantitative measures are 
not understood (Giorgi, 2005). Furthermore, by using existing measures, the topic is researched from 
the same perspective as previous studies (Flick, 2004). Therefore, particularly when creating or 
developing theories, multiple methods are considered a means to enable deeper exploration of a 
topic (Clarke & Hoggett, 2018; Denzin, 2012; Flick, 2004; Mathison, 1988; Modell, 2009).   
This study aims to apply a convergent methodological approach, using both quantitative and 
qualitative methods. Such an approach is also referred to as Mixed Methods (Harden & Thomas, 
2005), integrative review (Whittemore & Knafl, 2005) and Between-Methods Triangulation (Denzin, 
2015).  
Data will be collected concurrently although analysed separately providing different perspectives on 
the topic (Mathison, 1988). Subsequent convergent analysis of both methods in relation to each 
other aims to provide a deeper understanding of the research (Flick, 2004; Modell, 2009). This 
approach has been suggested as a means to counteract methodological weaknesses and biases 
(Rohner, 1977; Spencer, Pryce & Walsh, 2014). For example, there is research to suggest that 
quantitative methods such as surveys are not absent of respondent bias (see Krumpel, 2013; van de 
Mortel, 2008). 
This is not to say that the weaknesses of one method will be countered by the strengths of another 
(Jick, 1979; Mathison, 1988). Nor is the purpose to acquire consistent and congruent data (although 
this would be nice). Modell (2009) argues that congruence may be required when looking to replicate 
existing research, but is not necessary when looking to extend knowledge (Flick, 2004; Modell, 2009). 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  98 
Data outputs of multiple methods may be inconsistent or even contradictory (Jick, 1979; Mathison, 
1988). Indeed, in the context of organisational psychology research, a positivist approach whereby 
there is an objective right answer is unlikely (Cox & Hassard, 2005). When working with cognitive 
traits such as Psychological Safety, reality and fact is that which is interpreted by the individual.  
Furthermore, this reality may be reappraised in the light of new information or relevance. 
It is in the inconsistent and the different where value lies. It provides the opportunity to identify new 
perspectives and patterns above what is already known (Jick, 1979; Mathison, 1988; Strauss & 
Corbin, 1994). This reflects that which is required within the V.U.C.A. environment; a pragmatic 
approach whereby problems are solved using the most useful method, which may result in the use of 
mixed methods. (Feilzer, 2010). The depth of meaning that can only be determined through multiple 
data (Clarke & Hoggett, 2018; Cox et al., 2005; Modell, 2009) can help us better define and 
subsequently analyse organisational problems (Jick, 1979).  
Thus, a convergent approach, using both quantitative and qualitative methods will be used for this 
research.  The following chapter outlines the research strategy of the first two studies:  focus groups 
and a quantitative survey data that were run simultaneously.  All studies were approved by the 
University Ethics Committee. 
3.2 Qualitative Research Methods 
The hypothesis that the individual employee has a role to play in Psychological Safety was formed 
through personal experience of working in a global VUCA organisational environment. As a 
technology company, this was innovative, fast moving and constantly changing. However, the 
company culture was also highly politicised, competitive and ruthlessly results-focused.  Being 
responsible for the development of leaders, I was able to observe those who flourished within the 
environment and those for whom the environment led to acquiescence: just doing what they were 
told and keeping their heads down. Through interaction and coaching with a cross section of the 
employees, I became aware of individuals who were un-willing to speak up or challenge the status 
quo through fear of the consequences. And yet they were operating in the same environment, even 
in the same team, as those who were willing to be heard. Thus, the hypothesis that there are 
individual differences that contribute to Psychological Safety was formed. However, this was only my 
perspective. Therefore, in order to determine whether this was a viable research topic, employee 
focus groups were established.  
Researching Psychological Safety at the individual level is new to the field. The suggestion that it is 
related to an individuals internal cognitive resources is, at this stage, conjecture. Preliminary data 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  99 
was required in order to explore this as yet uncharted topic. Focus groups are considered ideal for 
such a purpose (Byers & Wilcox, 1988; Longhurst, 2003; McLafferty, 2004; Vaughn, Schumm & 
Sinagub, 1996) as they provide a forum to test ideas and understand other peoples views and 
opinions (Krueger et al., 2002). Through discussion, challenge and critique a focus group can begin to 
establish different perspectives on narratives around a new topic not previously considered (Patton, 
2002; Wilkinson, 1998) helping to generate new ideas (Breen, 2006 Gibbs, 1997).  
The purpose of the focus groups was to gather the opinions of others working in VUCA environments 
in order to determine whether the hypothesis was worth further quantitative research. The focus 
groups were designed to answer the questions Do individuals have a role to play in the creation of 
their Psychological Safety and if so, what are the intrinsic resources the individual needs to do 
this? The focus groups therefore needed to ascertain the current mechanisms used by the 
participants organisation to create Psychological Safety, what was felt to be missing and where the 
responsibility for creating these mechanisms lay. Finally, if the group identified the individual 
employee as having a responsibility for Psychological Safety, the focus groups would be used to 
determine what the individual needed to be or do to create Psychological Safety for themselves? 
3.2.1 Focus Groups 1 and 2 
3.2.1.1 Sampling 
The manner in which groups were to be accessed was through individual organisations 
providing a group of colleagues who, although not necessarily working directly together, 
were all working in the same company, the same industry and importantly the same VUCA 
environment. This commonality can aid disclosure and conversation thereby providing richer 
data and a broader range of opinions (Byers & Wilcox, 1998; Gill et al., 2008; Kitzinger, 1995; 
Krueger et al., 2002; Wilkinson, 1998).    
In order to encourage open conversation, a decision was made by the HR department to 
have separate management and non-management sessions. UK staff were emailed about the 
research in which a link was embedded to enable participants to book on the session (see 
Appendix I). In addition, flyers were posted around the office (see Appendix J). Volunteers 
were asked to sign up for a 2-hour lunchtime focus groups with lunch provided.  
3.2.1.1.1 Focus Group 1 
The first focus group consisted of four males and one female from a small to medium 
sized international IT company. They did not hold management positions.  Two 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  100 
participants identified as being between the ages of 25-39 years, the remaining between 
40-53 years old. One participant identified as Asian, the remaining participants were 
White. Two participants had been at the company less than 1 year, one between 1-3 
years and the remaining between 3-6 years. 
3.2.1.1.2 Focus Group 2 
The second focus group consisted of six managers, four male, from a small to medium 
sized international IT company.  Four were between the ages of 40-53 years and two 
between 54-64 years. All participants identified as White. Three had been with the 
company for between 1 and 3 years, one for between 3-6 years and two for between 6-
9 years. 
3.2.1.2 Procedures and Measures  
It is recommended that the environment in which the focus group takes place is relaxed and 
informal to encourage sharing and, ironically, so that the participants feel psychologically 
safe. However, such groups may be intimidating to some, thereby limiting discussion and 
challenge (Gibbs, 1997; Kitzinger, 1995; Wilkinson, 1998). In order to minimise such risk, all 
participation was voluntary, the three focus groups were run with known peers with no 
direct managers in the room. To ensure the right environment and that all participants were 
heard, focus groups were to be held in their own office, with lunch provided, facilitated by a 
facilitator with over 20 years experience facilitating sometimes challenging conversations, 
among leaders of blue chip organisations. 
One to one interviews were considered. However, given the nature of the topic, it was felt 
that the questions may be seen as accusatory. When looking at Psychological Safety at the 
individual level, the participant may have felt that the question was about what they 
personally should be doing to create their own Psychological Safety thereby triggering a 
defensive response. Furthermore, in creating a discussion over lunch, the aim was to create a 
more relaxed and safe environment. 
This data needed to be gathered in no more than two hours in order to minimise the impact 
on the business, thus the decision to hold the session over lunch time and to provide food.   
A session plan for the focus group was created (see Appendix K) although it was recognised 
that these questions may only be asked if the conversation moved in an appropriate 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  101 
direction. However, it provided a framework upon which to build the conversation. The 
session was divided into four parts: 
1. Pre-Introduction 
The introduction began with the completion of three forms. The first was a consent form 
as required by the ethics committee (see Appendix L). The second was a demographic 
questionnaire (see Appendix M). This included questions about gender, age group and 
race in order to 
measure the diversity 
of the focus group 
participants. Two 
questions were asked 
about personal living 
circumstances as 
research has shown 
that stress in work 
and family domains 
can spill over into 
each other (Demsky, 
Ellis & Fritz, 2014 
p196). Finally, three 
questions were asked 
about the 
participants role in 
the organisation; tenure, level and job title as these are have been shown to effect 
Psychological Safety (Nembhard & Edmondson, 2006; Ramos, Jenny & Bauer, 2016).   
The final form was used to determine the existing Psychological Safety mechanisms 
perceived to be present in the organisation (figure 3.1). This consisted of 25 questions 
with a yes/no answer, designed around Kahns Psychological Safety Dimensions 
(1990). 
2. Introduction 
Upon completion of the questionnaires, a formal introduction was provided using 
PowerPoint Slides (see Appendix N).  This included introduction to the facilitator, her 
experience, background and the nature of the study. The process of data gathering is

existing Psychological Safety mechanisms in their organisation.

shared, specifically in the context of focus groups and confidentiality assured. The 
definition of Psychological Safety is then introduced followed by the key question for 
discussion Given the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) environment 
in which we are all working, how Psychologically Safe do you feel and why? 
3. Discussion 
The discussion began with an interactive question. Having been provided with a 
definition of Psychological Safety, participants were asked to respond to the question 
Generally, how psychologically safe do you feel working here on a scale of 1-10, 1 being 
not at all, 10 being completely safe?  Answers were written on an A4 piece of paper 
and held up. The actual scores were not relevant, since the exercise was to prompt 
discussion. Two follow up questions enabled the development of the discussion. 
- OK, so the lowest score is X.  So, what are the specific things that make you feel 
psychologically safe? 
- What would need to happen to make the score a full 10 out of 10? 
Responses to each question were written on a flip chart. Subsequently, a 
discussion allowed reflection on the ownership of these mechanisms.  
- OK, for these mechanisms that need to be in place, whos responsibility is it to 
put them in place? 
- Is the responsibility for Psychological Safety purely that of the organisation? 
YES  NO 
 OK, so what barriers might 
organisations face when 
putting these mechanisms 
 How might these be 
overcome? 
  Who else is responsible? 
 What do they need to enable 
their Psychological Safety? 
The creation of a set questions might be considered the process followed for a 
structured group interview rather than a focus group discussion.  However, in designing 
the focus group as semi-structured (Gill et al., 2008), it allows definition of the areas to 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  103 
be explore through the provision of key questions (Kreuger et al., 2002).  Discussions 
began around an initial posed question and as themes emerged, further clarification 
questions were asked (Charmaz & Belgrave, 2001; Glaser & Strauss, 1967).  
4. Close 
The final part of the focus group summarised the findings allowing for final 
comments/questions. Participants were provided with a debrief letter (Appendix O) 
which detailed the next steps and any further reading should the participants be 
interested. 
Both sessions were audio recorded then subsequently transcribed (see Appendix P). 
3.2.2 Focus Group 3 
3.2.2.1 Sampling 
Focus group 3 was run as part of a 2-hour module on Psychological Safety as part of an 
Applied Neuroscience Programme. There were 34 participants between the ages of 25-50 
years, of which 12 were male.  Participants were predominantly white. 
3.2.2.2 Procedure 
Participants were divided into groups of 5 or 6 and asked to answer the following questions 
by documenting their thoughts on flip charts using post-it notes (see Appendix Q).  
1. What do you need to feel Psychologically Safe at work? 
2. Whose responsibility is this? 
3. What do you need in addition if you are in a remote/agile team? 
4. Which of these are external resources, which are internal (I.e. from within the 
individual) 
5. What else do people need within themselves to feel psychologically safe, given we 
cant always rely on the organisations to provide us with the external resources  
For each question, responses were in different coloured pen/post-it notes in order that 
responses per question could be recorded. All flip charts were collected at the end of the 
session for transcription and analysis.

3.2.3 Qualitative Data Analysis Strategy 
Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) recognises that outputs of qualitative studies are 
products of the participants own experiences and perspectives. As such, IPA is concerned with how 
participants make sense of the experience and therefore is interpretative as well as descriptive 
(Jeong & Othman, 2016; Smith, 2004). In order to explore the hypotheses of whether Psychological 
Safety is an individual construct, a pragmatic approach to grounded theory was applied. The analysis 
involved the development of in vivo codes in order to perform a thematic analysis. 
For the question What do they (the employees) need to enable their Psychological Safety? the 
outputs of the two transcriptions and eight flip charts were collated. From the three focus groups, a 
total of 205 resources were identified (see Appendix R). 
Of these, 89 resources were extrinsic, defined as being created by factors outside the control of the 
individual, for example leadership style, culture or aligned organisational goals. These were mapped 
against existing models of Psychological Safety such as Kahns (1990) Meaningful dimension and 
James and James Components of Psychological Climate (1989).  
The remaining 116 resources were determined to be intrinsic, in that they can be created by the 
individual themselves. The number of times each resource was mentioned was recorded by group or 
flip chart. The most commonly mentioned resources were: Learning Ability (20 times), Experience (18 
times), Emotional Management (17 times), Trust (16 times) and Values, Vision or Purpose (13 times). 
Duplicates and synonyms were then removed or amalgamated leaving 75 unique intrinsic responses 
(see Appendix R: Analysis from All Focus Groups for full process). These were then mapped against 
Kahns Availability dimension. However, 35 were unable to be mapped, suggesting that Psychological 
Safety at an individual level required further resources than those identified by Kahn (1990).  
In order to identify superordinate themes across the data, each of the 75 intrinsic resources were 
written on a post-it note. The post-it notes were then grouped according to like statements. For 
example, emotional intelligence and emotionally alert/aware and competence and expertise.  
This exercise was repeated with a further two researchers. Four key themes for individual 
Psychological Safety were identified. 
3.2.4 Limitations 
The challenge of focus group discussion is whether the opinion or views were held before the event, 
or constructed collectively through discourse (Smithson, 2000). The latter may result in a lack of 
diversity in responses. The topic of Psychological Safety as an individual construct was new to the 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  105 
literature and thus unlikely to have been previously considered.  However, the researcher needs to 
consider their own role in guiding discussion impartially in order to avoid confirmation bias. 
3.3 Quantitative Research Methods 
3.3.1 Sampling 
3.3.1.1 Students 
A pilot of the survey was run with University students. The questionnaire was distributed in 
the Psychology Department of the University of Reading using SONOS, students were offered 
a course credit for completion of the survey. Forty-two responses were received. However, 
two were excluded as they did not complete the survey. 
Of the remaining 40 student respondents, 11 were in their 1st year, 2 in their 5th year, the 
remaining in their 2nd year of study. The age range fell between 17 and 29 (SD=1.964). Only 
three participants were male. The majority described themselves of White ethnic origin 
(78%), 10% described themselves as Asian, 10% as other. Only 1 participant was of African 
origin.  
3.3.1.2 Employees 
Participants were accessed through the researchers network, leveraging LinkedIn to 
communicate the purpose of the study and how to complete it. The survey was also posted 
on the CIPD forum and the Henley MBA Alumni groups. Fifty participants were recruited 
using Prolific (www.prolific.co). This resulted in 183 participants. Of the 183 participant 
responses, 23 were incomplete. Most of these (14) stopped the survey at the first exercise: 
Task Switching, at which point the survey was only 24% complete. Of the remaining 160 
completed data sets, participant ages ranged between 20-65 years (Mean= 35.86, SD = 
9.973). The gender balance of respondents was 52.5% male and 93.8% of all respondents 
described themselves of white ethnicity.  Participants were predominantly degree educated 
or higher (76.2%).  
3.3.2 Measures 
Further to the extant work on Psychological Safety and resilience, the purpose of the data collection 
was to test the a priori hypothesis: Individuals that intrinsic psychological resources contribute to 
Psychological Safety. As such the target population was those currently in employment in a VUCA 
http://www.prolific.co/
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  106 
environment. First, a pilot study was run with students in order to test the survey results and data 
collection process using an online questionnaire.   
The aim of this study was not to develop a new measure for any of the variables being measured. 
Therefore, existing measures were used, with some minor changes.  
Opening questions were used to gather demographic and work related information and designed for 
this study. The first questionnaire used was May, Gilson and Harters (2004) questionnaire, based on 
Kahns (1990) qualitative research. This measures the psychological dimensions of engagement. In 
itself this consisted of a number of existing research questionnaires. Luthans Psychological Capital 
(2002) questionnaire was used to measure the components of Psychological Capital; Hope, Optimism 
and Resilience. The Self-efficacy measure was replaced with Jerusalem and Schwarzers Efficacy Scale 
(1995). Finally, Goods measure of Cognitive Flexibility was measured. Justification for use of these 
measures follows.   
3.3.2.1 Demographic Data 
The purpose of this data was to determine the extent to which the respondents were a 
representative sample. 
Standard demographic information was gathered in order to be able to determine the nature 
of the participant population. Categories were defined as per the UK Governments Office of 
National Statistics and for gender, as per advice from Stonewall UK (Pasterny, 2016), 
alternatives beyond male or female were provided offering five options. In addition, seven 
categories of ethnicity were offered. Employees were asked to indicate their educational 
level, students their year of study and whether full time or part time. All participants were 
asked to input their age (see table 3.1).

Table 3.1. Demographic Questions for both Employees and Students 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  107 
A further question was asked concerning mental health. 
The survey included question such as: I feel 
overwhelmed by things going on here (Availability  
cognitive Resource) and if something can go wrong for 
me here, it usually will (PsyCap- Optimism). Given the 
universitys commitment to the provision of mental 
health support, participants were asked if they had a 
mental health issue and provided information about places to seek help at the end of the 
survey.  From a research perspective, it was important to understand if any outliers may have 
been a result of current mental health issues (see figure 3.2). 
3.3.2.2 Work Data (Employee Only) 
Rapid technological changes are considered to be a primary cause of the VUCA environment 
(Bawany, 2016; Cartwright, 2003; Parker, 2008).  For this reason, the survey was initially 
designed for those working in the IT industry. However, research indicates that other 
industries are also experiencing the challenges of the VUCA environment such as Financial 
sector (Bawany, 2016), Education sector (McArthur, 2016), Healthcare (Lees, 2015; Spitz, 
2017), FMCG (Pasmore, 2010), transport and logistics (Popova & Shynkarenko, 2016) and 
large corporations and workplaces in general (Nash, 1994; Parker, 2008). 
In turn this impacts the functions within these industries such as HR (Johansen & Voto, 
2014), marketing (Paa-Kerner, 2016) and nursing (Cohen, 2014). Given the complex, 
interconnected world in which organisations are operating (Held, 1997; Kobrin, 2015; 
Lagarde, 2013), changes in one sector can impact another. 
Therefore, the questionnaire was restructured to be relevant to all industry sectors. 
Participants were asked to select the industry in which they were working.  Industry 
categories were based on the UK government Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Codes 
(2007) and an other option was provided (see table 3.2) 
Detert and Burris (2007) suggest that Psychological Safety is likely to be higher when the 
employee is more skilled, although, as their study did not measure performance, it provides 
no data to support this. Recent studies on temporary and permanent workers by Plomp et al. 
(2019) found no correlation for either group between work experience and Psychological 
Safety. 
Figure 3.2 Additional Mental Health 
Question for Student Sample 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  108 
It is possible that skill is acquired through experience. Indeed, data from Bienefeld and 
Grotes work (2014) with airline crews shows a small positive correlation between experience 
and Psychological Safety. Nembard and Edmondson (2006) found professional status and 
Psychological Safety to be significantly positively correlated and Bienefeld and Grote (2014) 
also found this correlation to be stronger the higher the employee is within the 
organisational hierarchy. However, these studies were carried out in organisations where 
hierarchy determines experience and status. Therefore, the questionnaire asked for Time in 
Industry to determine experience levels and Role Type to determine the nature of their 
work.  
Finally, the type of team in which the participant worked was identified. To date, 
Psychological Safety has been researched as a team construct.  Team membership and leader 
relations have shown to have strong positive correlations to Psychological Safety 
(Edmondson & Mogelof, 2006). However, team working is increasingly remote leading to a 
rise in virtual teams (Dulebohn & Hoch, 2017; Ford, Piccolo & Ford, 2017). The research is 
limited on how this might impact Psychological Safety. Of 60 studies researched (see 
Appendix A), there were only two that identified remote teams. Although these studies 
showed a positive significant correlation between Psychological Safety and remote team 
learning satisfaction (Ortega, Snchez-Manzanares & Rico, 2010) and a significant negative 
relationship with self-consciousness (Zhang et al., 2010), the studies involved students who 
only had face to face interactions with each other outside of the study and the opportunity 
to socialise offline.  
A more recent study by Swain (2018) found that leader humility significantly predicted 
psychological safety.  While initial studies required participants to imagine they were part of 
a virtual team, a subsequent study involving 147 members of assigned virtual teams 
demonstrated that teams with a humble leader felt more psychological safety than those 
with a non-humble leader (Swain, 2018).  
3.3.2.3. Kahns Meaningfulness Dimension 
The Meaningfulness dimension measures the level of meaningfulness the participant finds in 
their work. It includes measures of job enrichment, work role fit and co-worker relations.  
3.3.2.3.1 Job Enrichment 
May et al. (2004) used Hackman and Oldhams (1974) Job Design Survey (JDS) to 
determine participants overall level of satisfaction with their job.  The full JDS consists of 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  109 
8 sections and 87 questions measuring the design of jobs, the affective reactions an 
employee has to his or her job and the readiness of individuals to respond positively to 
enriched jobs (Hackman & Oldham, 1974 p.4). The 15 questions selected for the Job 
Enrichment subscale were those measuring five key job characteristics as defined by 
Hackman and Oldham: skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy and 
feedback ( = .85, May et al., 2004 p.21: see Appendix H for questions used).  
Some wording was amended, specifically to change the job to my job in order to 
make the questions more personal and removal of outdated phrase such as that is to 
say which was replaced by i.e.  
3.3.2.3.2 Work Meaningfulness 
The Work Meaningfulness subscale measured the degree of meaning that individuals 
discovered in their work-related activities. Three questions from the meaningfulness 
subscale of Spreitzers Empowerment Measure (1995) were used along with an 
additional 3 from an unpublished manuscript by May (2003:  =.90). 
3.3.2.3.3 Work Role Fit  
The Work Role Fit subscale was designed to measure the extent to which a role fits with 
an individuals identity. Research has shown that the better the fit between a role and 
the employees self-concept, the greater the sense of meaningfulness and ability to 
express themselves (Brief & Nord, 1990; Shamir, 1991). May et al. (2004 used 4 items 
measuring Work Role Fit (=.92; May et al., 2004 p.21). Slight grammatical amendments 
were made in the Work Role Fit questionnaire: the word with was included in 
questions 1 and 4 to improve readability.  
3.3.2.3.4 Rewarding Co-Worker relations 
Rewarding Co Worker relations subscales consisted of 10 items (= .93, May et al., 2004 
p.21) measuring how rewarding interpersonal interactions were for the employee, in 
particular respect and value they felt from colleagues.  Research has found a 
relationship between rewarding interactions and meaningfulness (Kahn, 1990; Lock & 
Taylor, 1990). 
The Subscales were totalled to provide an overall score for the participants Meaningfulness 
dimension.

S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  110 
3.3.2.4 Kahns Psychological Safety Dimension 
As discussed in the literature review, the Edmondson Questionnaire most commonly used to 
measure Psychological Safety is team based, narrow in focus and does not reflect the current 
reality of teams in VUCA environments.  Furthermore, it does not take into account the 
context provided by other elements of psychological dimension, as Kahn (1990) and May et 
al.,s (2004) work do. Therefore, for Psychological Safety, Mays questionnaire was used to 
measure the components of Psychological Safety (2004). This comprised of three section; 
Supportive Supervisor Relations, Co-Worker Norm Adherence and Psychological Safety.  
3.3.2.4.1 Supportive Supervisor Relations 
Whitener et al. (1998) identified five categories of behaviour that engender an 
employees perception of trust in managers. These were behavioural consistency, 
behavioural integrity, sharing and delegation of control, communication and 
demonstration of concern (p.516). May et al. (2004) addressed four of these using a 
combination of 6 items from the supportive supervision section of Oldham and 
Cummings Supervisor Style questionnaire (1996) and 4 items from Butlers (1991) 10 
Conditions of Trust Index (see table 3.3).  
The Oldham and Cummings questionnaire was originally designed to assess creativity at 
an individual level in a manufacturing business context (Oldham & Cummings, 1996).  
However, in doing so, it also measures the extent to which the environment is 
supportive. Creativity requires a safe environment in which employees can fail without 
fear, thereby creating opportunities to experiment (Kahn 1990 p.711).  Therefore, 
these 6 questions were adopted to measure the extent to which supervisors contributed 
to Psychological Safety.  The overall reliability of this Supportive Supervisor section was 
reported as .= 86 (Oldham & Cummings, 1996: p617).  
The final category of behaviour in the Whiteners et al. (1998) Trustworthy Behaviours 
questionnaire was that of behavioural consistency. To measure this, May, et al. (2004) 
used the 4 items of overall trust from Butlers (1991) Creation of Trust Index (=.97, 
N=380; =.91, N=147). This resulted in a total of 10 questions measuring supportive 
supervisor relations ( = .95, May et al., 2004, p21). For this study, some rewording was 
carried out in recognition that in todays project and matrix environments an individual 
may have more than one supervisor who may not necessarily be their hierarchical senior 
(see table 3.2). 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  111 
3.3.2.4.2 Norm Adherence 
Kahns research found that adherence to organisational and co-worker norms provided 
a greater sense of Psychological Safety. In the research reported here 3 questions 
devised by May et al., (2004) for their research were used. ( = .61).  
3.3.2.4.3 Psychological Safety 
Although Edmondsons questionnaire has been used extensively for measuring 
Psychological Safety, it is designed for use with teams. Therefore, May, et al. (2004)

created their own individual-based questions measuring a participants perceived level 
of inter-personal at work and their level of comfort in being themselves at work. There 
are three questions for this measure ( = .71).  
3.3.2.5 Kahns Availability Dimension 
Availability refers to the perceived physical, cognitive and emotional resources available to 
the individual for investment into their work role. This was measured using four measures: 
Resources (Cognitive Resources), Psychological Availability (Emotional Resources), Self-
consciousness and Outside Support. 
3.3.2.5.1 Resources (Cognitive Resources) 
Stress, created by having too much to do is commonly referred to as role overload. It 
results from the perceptions that the demands of the job exceed the individuals 
perceived available psychological resources. (Brown, Jones & Leigh, 2005; Hobfoll, 2002; 
Reilly, 1982). Brown et al. (2005) surveyed 172 commission only sale representatives, 
finding that role overload had a negative impact on self-efficacy and performance. When 
role overload was low, self-efficacy and performance were significantly related whereas 
this was not the case when role overload was high. High job demands were also shown 
to have an impact on Psychological Safety in a study of 126 Australian employees and 
180 Malaysian employees from diverse industries (Idris et al., 2012).  For both samples, 
job demands had a negative impact on Psychological Safety.  For the Malaysian sample 
only, there was a significantly negative relationship between psychological demands and 
Psychological Safety. This suggests that culture may have an impact on psychological 
demands and Psychological Safety.  
May et al., (2004) developed 5 questions ( =0.85) measuring perceived cognitive 
resources at work, based on Kahns qualitative study. These each began with I feel 
confident (See Appendix H). 
3.3.2.5.2 Psychological Availability (Emotional Resources) 
Emotional resources are used particularly when having to manage emotions at work. 
Emotional dissonance leads to the depletion of emotional resources resulting in 
exhaustion (May et al., 2004).  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  113 
May et al. (2004) constructed 8 questions to measure the Psychological Availability (or 
emotional resources) individuals perceived themselves to have in the workplace ( 
=0.91) which were used in this study.   
3.3.2.5.3 Self-Consciousness 
May et al. (2004) based their three questions on Selfconsciousness on Fenigstein, 
Scheier & Busss (1975) theory of Self-consciousness. While Fenigstein et al. (1975) 
proposed two types of Self-consciousness: the private and the public, May et al. (2004) 
only used three questions from the public self-consciousness scale ( =.83).  When 
revising their model, they eliminated this path since they claimed it did not have 
significant impact on the models degree of overall fit (2004, p.27). Solberg Nes et al. 
(2011) would concur with this, having been unable to find any support for the role of 
self-consciousness in goal engagement or self-regulatory behaviour in 50 female 
patients suffering with Fibromyalgia Syndrome and/or temporomandibular disorders.  
Self-Consciousness had no significant impact on either persistence or self-regulation 
(Solberg Nes et al., 2011). Froming and Carver (1981) assessed the impact of public and 
private self-consciousness on compliance, finding that public self-consciousness did not 
correlate significantly with compliance. However, contrary to this, there has been 
research that has shown a relationship between high public self-consciousness and 
group conformity and identity (Cheek & Briggs, 1982) and suppression of behaviour 
(Carver & Scheier 1981; Froming & Carver, 1981). Tunnel (1984) measured public self-
consciousness with the Jackson Personality Inventory that measures aspects of the 
personality such as conforming, affiliation and self-monitoring. Those with high public 
self-consciousness were higher on self-monitoring, conformity and affiliation needs. 
If public self-consciousness can influence conformity and a need to belong, this may 
influence Psychological Safety. Therefore, despite May et al.s (2004) findings, it was felt 
that the three self-consciousness questions ( =0.83) should remain. This was included 
in the employee survey and no rewording was required. 
3.3.2.5.4 Outside Activities 
To understand the extent to which outside activities depleted or enriched an individuals 
available resources, May et al. (2004) asked the question How many hours per week do 
you participate in organizations other than (the companys name) (2004 p.22). 
However, the answer to this question is meaningless. If the answer was 8 hours per 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  114 
week this tells us nothing as to whether those 8 hours enriched or depleted resources. 
Furthermore, this may vary between individuals.  What was required here was whether 
work enabled the individual to partake in outside activities for the time they felt they 
needed. Therefore, the question was reworded to: 
I feel work allows me the time to invest in outside interests and activities such as 
sports, hobbies, family activities, religious or spiritual pursuits.  
A strong social support system is considered a key contributor to personal resources 
(Barrera, 1986; Cohen & Hoberman, 1983; Holahan et al., 1999; King et al., 1999; Norris 
& Kaniasty, 1996; Sarason et al., 1986; Thoits, 1995) therefore the following question 
was also asked:  
I feel I have someone outside of work to talk to if I need to 
A summary of the questions for the Psychological Dimensions Questionnaire is shown below in table 
3.3 below. See Appendix H for the full set of questions.  
3.3.2.6. Psychological Capital 
A key criterion for the components of the Psychological Capital model was that that they 
could be measured (Luthans & Church 2002). In developing the Psychological Capital 
questionnaire (PCQ -See Appendix E), Luthans Avolio, Avey & Norman (2007a) utilised 
existing measures resulting in a 24-item questionnaire consisting of 6 questions on each of 
the four elements of Psychological Capital: Optimism, Hope, Resilience and Self-Efficacy.

University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  115 
3.3.2.6.1 Optimism  
To measure Optimism, 
Luthans et al., (2006) selected 
Scheier & Carvers Life 
Orientation Test- Revised 
(1985) (see figure 3.3). 
Scheier and Carver describe 
optimism as an indicator of an 
individuals perception of the 
outcome of goal directed 
behaviour when facing 
difficulties. In other words, it 
is optimism, the general belief 
that good things will happen in the future that keeps you working towards a goal. (Burke 
et al., 2000; Kavussanu & McAuley, 1995; Peterson, 2000; Scheier & Carver, 1985).   
When looking to measure optimism, Scheier and Carver found that many of the 
assessments measured the causes of optimism such as self-efficacy, morale, wellbeing 
etc. (Carver, Scheier & Segerstrom, 2010). They however, wanted to find a pure 
measure of expectation (Peterson, 2000 p.48) irrespective of the source. As a result, 
the Life Orientation Test (LOT) and its successor the LOT-Revised (LOT-R) were 
developed. 
The LOT-R consists of 10, questions to assess dispositional optimism: 3 positive 
questions, 3 negative and 4 filler questions, identified by brackets in figure 3.1, ( = .80, 
Scheier & Carver, 1994).  The LOT and the LOT-R have been built on the concept of 
optimism and pessimism being polar opposites on a single continuum (Burke et al., 
2000; Chiesi et al., 2013; Herzberg, Glaesmer & Hoyer, 2006; Scheier & Carver, 1985; 
Schou-Bredal et al., 2017) and this has drawn much criticism. 
Evidence has been found to support the proposal that optimism and pessimism are two 
separate constructs (Dember & Brooks, 1989a, b; Herzberg, Glaesmer & Hoyer, 2006; 
Peterson, 2000). Optimism is not simply the absence of pessimism (Peterson, 2000), nor 
are optimism and pessimism simply opposites (Marshall et al., 1992). As separate

constructs, an individual can demonstrate both optimism and pessimism (Burke et al., 
2000; Peterson 2000).  
Sheier and Carver (1985) found that a principal factor analysis (N=624) responses to the 
LOT questions resulted in a two-factor solution in which the reversed scoring items 
loaded onto the first factor, and the remaining items onto the second factor. However, a 
confirmatory factor analysis found that both a single factor model and a two-factor 
solution provided acceptable fits. However, the high factor loading onto the first factor, 
and the high correlation between the two factors (r=.64), led to Scheier and Carver 
(1985) to conclude that the LOT was unidimensional, thereby better fitting their concept 
of optimism and pessimism being on a continuum. However, they did concede that 
there is justification for examining the two halves of the scale separately (p.227). 
Carver (2013) states that those using the LOT-R wishing to test potential differences 
between affirmation of optimism and disaffirmation of pessimism should calculate the 
subtotals separately. 
However, there is also research that argues that the LOT-R is bi-dimensional. Principal 
component analysis by Marshall et al. (1992) indicated that the LOT loaded onto two 
factors, and a confirmatory factor analysis by Chang, D'Zurilla, and Maydeu-Olivaries 
(1994) found that the two-factor model was a better fit. More recently, CFA modelling 
by Cano-Garca et al. (2015) indicated that of the 7 models tested on LOT-R completion 
responses two were the best and identical fit: optimism and pessimism as two 
correlated factors and as a second order factor life orientation which consisted for 
optimism and pessimism.  It was the high correlation between the two factors in the 
first model (r=-0.79) that led to their conclusion that it was a single dimension.  
A further criticism of the LOT/ LOT-R has been the use of extreme adverbs such as 
always and never (Segerstrom, Evans & Eisenlohr-Moul, 2011). McPherson and 
Mohr (2005) created an alternate version of the LOT-R, the LOT-M, moderating the 
adverbs for example substituting usually for always and sometimes for never. 
However, this did not impact the dimensionality of the LOT-R (McPherson & Mohr 2005; 
Segerstrom et al., 2011) although CFA confirmed this measure as being unidimensional. 
Overall the LOT-R has been found to be accurate in the assessment of optimism and 
pessimism (r= .76 and test reliability of .79 over 4-week interval) (Scheier & Carver, 
1985). It correlates with the Fibel and Haless (1978) General Expectancy for Success 
Scale (r=.51 -.63) and with problem solving (r=.22) (Scheier, Weintraub & Carver, 1986). 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  117 
Chiesi et al. (2013) in their study into the validity of the LOT-R found item discrimination 
of above the cut off of 1.35 (Baker, 2001) with the exception of item 1, falling slightly 
below ( for items was between 1.29  .13 and 2.04  .20). This attest[ed] to the 
precision of the [LOT-R] scale (Chiesi et al., 2013 p.528) 
A possible source of such confusion may be the way in which optimism and pessimism 
are defined (Chang et al., 1994; Peterson, 2000). These can be described at different 
conceptual levels; a personality disposition (Scheier & Carver, 1987) or situational 
(Burke et al., 2000; Dember et al., 1989a, b; Marshall et al., 1992; Peterson, 2000).  The 
mechanisms that link optimism to outcomes may vary according to the type of optimism 
in focus (Peterson, 2000). Petersons big optimism and little optimism (2000, p.49) 
reflects the state-trait nature of optimism.  In doing so it shows the possibility that a 
person can be both generally optimistic, but pessimistic about specific events or 
outcomes, or vice versa (Burke et al., 2000; Peterson, 2000). The requirement for 
Psychological Capital is that the construct is malleable and open to change, therefore 
the LOT-R needed to be adapted to measure the state-like element of optimism. To do 
this, Luthans reworded the questions from the LOT-R to make them more workplace 
relevant. Finally, the four filler questions were removed leaving 6 questions in the PCQ 
measuring optimism (see Appendix E). These questions were used in this study. 
3.3.2.6.2 Hope  
Like optimism, hope is considered to be both dispositional and state like (Snyder et al., 
1996; Valle, Huebner & Suldo, 2006). Consequently, two versions of the Hope Scale 
were developed  a Dispositional Hope Scale and a State Hope Scale (correlation 
between scales = .79: Luthans & Jensen 2002; Snyder et al., 1996). 
The goal directed behaviour of hope as is considered bi-directional, having two 
components; agency or the willpower, and pathways or the waypower (Luthans & 
Jensen, 2002). The Adult Hope Scale was therefore devised with three items measuring 
agency and three measuring pathways. In testing its validity, Snyder et al.  (1991) 
administered the questionnaire six times between autumn 1897 and spring 1990 (N=955 
 339). Each time, a factor analysis confirmed the two-factor model and the factors were 
found to have a strong correlation (between r=.38  46, p<.001). The internal 
consistency of the total State Hope score ranged from a low of  = .74 to a high of  =.84 
(Snyder et al., 1991). 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  118 
The State Hope scale consists of 12 items, 4 measure of agency, 4 of pathways and 4 
filler questions (see figure 3.4). Luthans et al., (2006) chose to use only 6 of these, 
though how the final 6 used in 
the PCQ were determined is 
not explained. However, over 
4 samples, (N=167, 404, 115, 
144) the 6-question scale 
(three agency and three 
pathway questions) had an 
overall reliability of  = > .72. 
3.3.2.6.3 Resilience  
The PCQ has taken 6 questions 
from Wagnild and Youngs 
(1993) 25 question resilience 
scale (RS).  In their 2006 
review of resilience scales, 
Ahern et al. (2006) considered 
Wagnild and Youngs resilience 
scale the most appropriate 
instrument to study resilience 
in both adolescents and adults 
due to its psychometric robustness and use across wide audiences.  In addition, its 
positive tone reflects the principles of positive psychology from which Psychological 
Capital was born. 
The purpose of the Wagnild and Young (1993) resilience scale was to identify the 
degree of individual resiliencethat enhances individual adaptation which was 
considered a personality trait (p.167). From qualitative research, Wagnild and Young 
(1993) identified five characteristics of resilience: equanimity (a balanced perspective 
of ones life and experiences), perseverance (persistence despite adversity or 
discouragement), self-reliance (belief in oneself and ones capabilities), and 
meaningfulness (realization that life has purpose), and existential aloneness (realization 
that each persons life path is unique) (Broyles, 2005 p.64). However, a principal 
components analysis loaded onto two factors with a correlation between the factor

Factor 1 encompasses the elements of perseverance and self-reliance characteristics of 
resilience. Factor 2 has the elements of equanimity, meaningfulness and existential 
aloneness which together is entitled Acceptance of Self and Life (Wagnild & Young 1993) 
(See table 3.4).

Table 3.4 Wagnild and Youngs (1993) resilience scale (RS) showing the questions loading onto two 
factors. The six questions in bold and underlined indicate those selected for the Psychological Capital 
Questionnaire and reworded to be relevant for the workplace. 
Luthans used 6 questions from the resilience scale, four taken from Factor I and 2 from 
Factor II sections of the resilience scale (see table 3.5).  The literature does not clarify 
the criteria used to decide upon these six questions, merely they were determined by 
an expert panel (Luthans et al., 2007b p.211). Communication directly with Luthans 
uncovered that the panel was made up of colleagues and doctoral students (email 
Luthans, 2018  see Appendix D). The expert panel was also used to reword the 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  120 
questions to ensure that the measure was of the state of resilience rather than the trait 
by making them relevant to the workplace. 
Finally, as discussed in the previous chapter, Luthans et al., incorporates the process of 
bouncing back or the need to go beyond the normal, to go beyond the equilibrium 
point (Luthans, 2002; Luthans et al., 2006; Youssef & Luthans, 2007) into his definition of 
resilience. And yet none of the 6 resilience questions selected for the PCQ measure 
growth achieved from setbacks. The resilience measured in the PCQ is more aligned with 
the traditional definition of resilience: the ability to adapt and leverage resources to 
maintain homeostasis or 
to return to normal 
functioning (Bonanno, 
2004; Carver, 1998; 
Masten, Best & 
Garmezy, 1990; 
McEwen, 2016;

Staudinger et al., 1993; 
Tusaie & Dyer, 2004).  
3.3.2.7 A Challenge to 
PCQs Self-Efficacy 
Measure 
Bandura defined self-efficacy 
as a task- and context-
specific state-like variable; the belief regarding ones capabilities to execute a specific task 
within a given, specific context (1986, 1997).  
The six questions in the PCQ that measure self-efficacy are taken from a 10-item 
questionnaire devised by Parker (1998: see figure 3.5). However, Parkers questionnaire was 
devised to measure role breadth selfefficacy for employees involved in a company briefing 
initiative in which strategic information could be cascaded down, as well as an opportunity 
for employees to discuss local issues (Parker, 1998 p.838). The purpose of the questionnaire 
was not to establish whether the individual had performed the task but whether they felt 
confident that they could if it were asked of them, having completed the briefing.

S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  121 
There are two key issues with the use of this questionnaire: the nature of the question 
content and the assumption that confidence and self-efficacy are synonymous. 
3.3.2.7.1 The Question Content  
The premise of Parkers questionnaire aligns well with the expectations of employees in 
todays VUCA environments; that they are able to carry out a range of activities that 
are more proactive, interpersonal and integrative in their nature (Parker, 1998 p.836) 
and feel confident in their ability to carry out a broad range of roles. Parkers 
questionnaire measures non-technical abilities and considered exemplar elements of 
an expanded role (Parker, 1998 p.839). These are problem solving, collaborating with 
those inside and outside the company and discussing company strategy. Bandura 
recommended that the measurement of self-efficacy is contextual (Bandura 1978, 
1986). In order to meet the Positive Organisational Behaviour criteria, self-efficacy 
measurement should be work relevant and state like to enable development (Luthans et 
al., 2007; Stajkovic & Luthans 1998a).  
Certainly, Parkers questionnaire was relevant, having been designed for a specific 
workplace initiative. However, these questions reflect more of a Level 2 training 
evaluation (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2006, p.21) than testing a level of self-efficacy. 
However, Luthans uses these same questions with no specific roles in mind (Luthans 
email 2018  See Appendix D). In applying such specific questions to workplace roles in 
general, they may become inappropriate as they cannot be applied to all roles. For 
example, because an employee may not feel efficacious about contributing to 
discussions about the organisations strategy (Parker, 1998 p.839) does not mean they 
have low self-efficacy for their own role or tasks. If you were to ask an air steward his or 
her self-efficacy about flying a plane, the answer would not be indicative of their efficacy 
of deploying the safety slide when needed. Thankfully.  In IT, some of the most highly 
efficacious programmers may be the least likely to feel capable of highly social activities 
such as presenting information to a group of colleagues or contacting people outside 
the company (Chen, Frolick & Muthitacharon, 2003; Collins, 2014; Felicetti, 2018; 
Zawacki, 1992). Therefore, the self-efficacy questions used as part of the PCQ are not 
structured in a way to establish an individuals self-efficacy about the domain relevant to 
them  that of their current job in their current organisation.  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  122 
In short, self-efficacy scales must be tailored to activity domains.  Efficacy scales must be 
linked to factors that determine quality of functioning in the domain of interest 
(Bandura 2006 pp.310  311). The self-efficacy questions in the PCQ do not do this.  
3.3.2.7.2 Confidence and Self-Efficacy 
All six questions for the self-efficacy section of the PCQ, begin with I feel confident as 
Luthans has chosen to treat confidence and self-efficacy interchangeably (email, 
2018). Although at times Bandura uses confidence and self-efficacy synonymously 
(1977b, 1994, and 2006) he explains, that although related, self-efficacy and confidence 
are not the same (1997). He differentiates between what an individual believes that 
they can do and what the individual believes the likely outcome of what they can do will 
be (Bandura et al., 2003). He refers to this as Efficacy Expectation and Outcome 
Expectation. While outcome expectancies refer to the perception of the possible 
consequences of ones action, self-efficacy expectancies refer to personal action control 
or agency (Schwarzer, Muller & Greenglass, 1999 p.146). Scheier and Carver (1987) 
argue that self-efficacy and confidence are different as outcome expectancy (or 
confidence) is not just a product of personal causation (p.200). but can also be derived 
from other sources: e.g. cognitive appraisal (Bandura, 1982a p.127), cognitive bias 
(Harvey, 1997; Koriat, Lichtenstein & Fischhoff, 1980), strength and extremeness of 
evidence (Griffin & Tversky, 1992, p.412), luck, being favoured by God (Scheier et al., 
1987 p.171), self-esteem (Tang & Reynolds, 1993) and self-concept (Bandura 1986; 
Pajeres & Miller 1994; Swann, Chang-Schneider, & McClarty, 2007). Stajkovic (2006) 
argues that confidence is a higher order construct, its components being hope, 
optimism, self-efficacy and resilience. However, if Psychological Capital is actually 
confidence, then the self-efficacy measure is measuring confidence in order to measure 
a higher order construct of confidence. 
As homogenous concepts, confidence could be improved by increasing self-efficacy, and 
vice-versa. However, research has found this not to be the case. In Banduras (1977) 
experiments involving participants with animal phobias, although the participants 
developed confidence that handling the animal appropriately would prevent being 
bitten (outcome expectancy) they were still uncertain of their ability to do so (efficacy 
expectancy). Work by Tang & Reynolds (1993) showed that for individuals with low self-
esteem, although their efficacy at the task may have been the same as those with high 
self-esteem, their confidence in predicting the outcome of their performance was lower 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  123 
for longer (N=52). The main effect on performance of self-esteem and goal difficulty 
were significant, suggesting that the participants actual performance had no effect on 
their certainty. Indeed, I can be extremely confident that I will fail at flying a plane.  
Similarly, I may rate my self-efficacy at filling in my tax return as high (given I am still on 
the correct side of the tax man at the point of writing) but may not feel confident about 
doing so.  
Thus, although there is a strong consensus that there is a relationship between 
confidence and self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977, 1982a; Brockner et al., 1988; Leganger, 
Kraft and Rysam 2000; Luthans et al., 2007b; Pajares & Miller, 1994; Scheier & Carver, 
1987; Schwarzer et al., 1997; Sherer et al., 1982) there are clearly other factors at play.  
In Luthans Psychological Capital model, the two self-efficacy expectations, outcome and 
efficacy, are combined, with Luthans defining self-efficacy as belief or confidence in 
dealing with challenging situations (Luthans, 2002; Stajkovic, 2006). However, the flaw in 
amalgamating the two self-efficacy expectations, particularly in todays organisations, is 
illustrated by the first self-efficacy question in the Psychological Capital Questionnaire 
(see Appendix E). The question I feel confident in analysing a long-term problem to find 
a solution measures both efficacy expectations and outcome expectations. Given the 
pace of change and the challenges prevalent in todays organisations in anticipating the 
future, (Friedman, 2005) an employee might have high self-efficacy in analysing a long-
term problem but may not be confident that the outcome would be a good solution. Nor 
does not finding a solution mean they are any less efficacious at analysing a problem. 
Solutions may not be that obvious in the complex VUCA world (Cousins, 2018). 
Conversely, an employee may not have high efficacy about analysing a problem but 
remain confident that they can find a solution given the diverse teams of knowledge 
workers which they have access to in their organisation (Beechler et al., 2009). 
In todays organisational environments and uncertain and ambiguous world, we may 
have high levels of self-efficacy about what we can do, but may not have confidence in 
the outcomes (McArthur, 2016; Nadler & Tushman, 1999).  In such environments 
performance requirement may be unclear resulting in discrepancies between efficacy 
and confidence in outcomes (Bandura, Adams & Beyer, 1977b). Indeed, it is when 
performance requirement and situational circumstances are ill-defined that 
discrepancies between the two are most likely to occur (Bandura et al., 1977b p.138). 
University of Reading

In the context of this study, the expectancy measure is Optimism and the confidence 
measure is the cognitive resource measure in availability. Therefore, a measure that 
focuses only self-efficacy was needed.  
3.3.2.7.3 The Jerusalem and Schwarzer Self Efficacy Scale 
The Jerusalem and Schwarzer General Self Efficacy Scale (Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995) 
is a well-used internationally valid scale for adults that has been translated into 33 
different languages. Across a variety of samples, it has demonstrated high reliability 
across languages ( = .76 - .90), the majority in the high .80s (Leganger, Kraft, & 
Rysamb, 2000; Luszczynska, Scholz & Schwarzer 2005; Schwarzer, Mueller, & 
Greenglass, 1999). In addition, the psychometric properties of the scale have been 
proven for online completion (Schwarzer et al., 1999).  
Each of the 10 items relate to perceived success at coping and measure the trait of self-
efficacy. Therefore, in order to meet with Banduras requirement of self-efficacy being 
contextually based, and the requirement of Psychological Capital constructs being state 
like, amendments were made to the questions to make them applicable to the 
workplace (see figure 3.6).  
Question 4 of the scale asks participants to rate their response to; I am confident that I 
could deal efficiently with unexpected events.  In addition to providing context to the 
sentence by adding at work, given the discussion above, I am confident has been

S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  125 
changed to I believe. The question now reads I believe that I could deal efficiently 
with unexpected events. This questionnaire was used in the research reported here. 
3.3.2.8 Cognitive Flexibility 
Cognitive flexibility is an indicator of the ability to be cognitively ambidextrous; to be able 
to flexibly adapt within a dynamic context. It is made up of four variables; Focus, Flexibility, 
Openness and Divergent thinking. For each of these, a self-rated questionnaire was provided 
as well as an experiment to test cognitive skills.  
3.3.2.8.1 Attentional Control: Focus & Flexibility 
Attentional Control is positively correlated with the adaptive strategies of cognitive 
emotional regulation (from .14 to. 41, p < .001) and negatively with maladaptive 
strategies (from -.34 to -.46, p < .001: Fajkowska & Derryberry, 2010). Good (2009) used 
Derryberry and Reeds (2002) Attentional Control Scale (ACS) in order to assess the 
ability to focus on, and flex toward, relevant information.  
This 20-item questionnaire measures both Attentional Focus ( = .80) i.e. the extent to 
which one holds attention on one thing, resisting distractions and Attentional Shifting ( 
= .65) i.e. being able to intentionally change your focus as required (flexibility). Scales 
were positively correlated with each other (r = .54) and negatively correlated with fear 
(r= -.26 and - .40 respectively) and negatively correlated with sadness (r = -.17 and -.16 
respectively) (Derryberry & Rothbart, 1988).   
Fajkowska & Derryberry (2010) tested the validity of the ACS through a principal 
components analysis specifying a 1, 3, 4, and 5 factor solution (N= 218 undergraduates).  
The one-factor solution explained 35.4% of the variance (KMO = .88). The three-factor 
solution 47.8% of the variance (KMO = .87). The three-factor solution consisted of 
Attentional Focusing, Attentional Shifting and Divided Attention. However, Fajkowska 
et al. concluded that the factors do not contain enough markers in them to support 
internal consistency (2010, p.7) and therefore concluded that the one factor solution 
was more valid. 
However, Olafsson et al. (2011) surveyed 728 university students and found that a 
principal components analysis resulted in a two-factor solution:  Nine items loaded onto 
factor 1 representing attentional focusing and 10 items onto factor 2 representing 
attentional shifting. One item, question 9 When concentrating I ignore feelings of 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  126 
hunger and thirst, was excluded from the factor analysis due to poor correlations with 
other items. A confirmatory factor analysis provided support for the two-factor solution 
although a further two items with factor loadings below 0.30 were removed. A similar 
analysis by Judah et al.  (2014) (N=198) also resulted in a two-factor model without the 
need for removing items. A more recent study published in 2019 by DeVito et al. 
analysed the ACS on a sample of older adults (N=366) confirming a two-factor solution: 
Focusing Attention and Shifting Attention. However, when comparing factor loadings 
between groups, 7 items loaded onto different factors. These were removed and a 
confirmatory factor analysis was performed on the remaining 13 items, generating a 
good fit. Devito et al. (2019) also re-ran a CFI on Olafsson et al.s (2011) 19 item model, 
finding a good fit.   
Overall the Attentional Control Scale is considered to be a useful and robust measure for 
assessing attentional control (Fajowska et al., 2010; Judah et al., 2014). Despite some 
studies removing questions, for this study, all 20 questions have been retained for 
completeness (Good, 2009).    
 In addition to the self-rating questionnaire, behavioural measures were used to assess 
attention control and cognitive flexibility. Specifically, the ability to select and focus on 
the right information by dealing with conflict (interference), to suppress previous 
actions or routines and then switch to do this again with different information was 
tested. This is discussed below. 
3.3.2.8.2 Attentional Control Behavioural Measure 
Attentional control requires inhibition, shifting and updating (Rende, 2000). Posner 
(1990) and Petersen (2012) when researching the anatomy of attention defined the 
three processes of attention as alerting i.e. maintaining an alert state, orienting i.e. 
selecting and prioritising information and executive control i.e., resolving the conflict 
that occurs when required to withhold a response to stimuli (Botvinick et al., 2001; Fan 
et al., 2002; Posner, 1990; Peterson, 2012). Measures of attentional control that test 
these processes include Eriksens (1995) Flanker Test (Botvinick, et al., 1999) anti-
saccade tasks (Judah et al 2013; Fanet al., 2002), the Stroop test (Thompson, Foreman, 
& Martin, 2000) and Task Switching (Keele & Hawkins, 1982; Derryberry & Reed, 2002b; 
Good, 2009; Fan et al., 2002). Such tasks require the participant to identify pre-
determined stimuli (alerting) amongst other distracting stimuli (orientating) and then 
inhibit a relatively automatic response (executive control) through attention suppression 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  127 
or inhibition. The stimuli change so that the participant also needs to be able to shift 
their attentional resources when required (Derakshan & Eysenck, 2009).  
When selecting the measurement protocol for this research, the Stroop test was 
excluded as an option due to its increasing familiarity in the public realm. Anti-saccade 
tests were also excluded as there are questions as to whether the relationship between 
eye movements and attention is as close as previously thought (Posner, 1980; Miyake et 
al., 2000). In addition, the practicalities of measuring eye movements for the essentially 
remote participants excluded this option. The remaining options, the Flanker test and 
Task Switching both ask the participant to respond to relevant stimuli whilst being 
provided with irrelevant stimuli. As the relevant stimuli change throughout the 
experiment changes in response times as the exercises become more complex, allows 
the switch cost to be measured. 
There are differences in opinions as to the causes of the switch cost. This has been 
proposed to be due to the time taken to mentally reconfigure the task set (Monsell et 
al., 2003; Pashler, 2000), the inhibition of control processes (Allport, Styles & Hsieh 
1994; Allport & Wylie, 2000), memory retrieval (Monsell & Driver, 2000; Pashler, 2000; 
Vandierendonck, Liefooghe & Verbruggen, 2010) or conflict-control mechanisms (Brown 
et al., 2007). It is not for this research to decide between these mechanisms and it is 
likely that the switch cost involves multiple control mechanisms (Goschke, 2000; 
Monsell et al., 2003; Brown et al., 2007; Vandierendonck et al., 2010) which include both 
inhibition (interference) and reconfiguration processes. (Monsell et al., 2003, Brown et 
al., 2007).  
Rogers and Monsell (1995) designed the alternating-runs procedure, in which 
participants have the opportunity to practise the tasks thereby preconfiguring the 
tasks beforehand. In addition, in order to measure switch costs a measure is taken of 
performance on a non-switching task to compare with performance on a switching task. 
Rogers and Monsell (1995) suggest that in doing so any switch costs can be 
unambiguously attributed to the need to change tasks (Rogers & Monsell, 1995 
p.228). 
Rogers and Monsells Alternative Switching task was used in this research to test the 
focus and flexibility element of cognitive agility (1995). The tasks require 
participants to respond to number and letter combinations. There are three blocks: in 
the first block participants are asked to respond to the letters only, indicating whether 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  128 
the letter is a vowel or a consonant. The second block is a task repeat trial which this 
time requires a response to numbers only, indicating whether the number is odd or 
even. The final mixed block is the switch task which requires the participant to 
respond to either the number (indicating whether its odd or even) or the letter 
(consonant or vowel) depending on where on the screen the stimulus is located.   
Although Miyake et al. (2000) and Judah et al. (2014) used task switching to measure 
attentional shifting the task requires all three elements of attentional control as 
described by Posner (1980, 1990). Task switching requires individuals to reconfigure 
their cognitive resources (Monsell & Driver, 2000 p.10) in a way creates what Goschke 
(2000) refers to as the Stability-Flexibility dilemma (p.351).  This refers to having enough 
cognitive control to be able to focus on the required tasks whilst also having enough 
control to be able to change attentional focus if required. Similarly, Goschke (2000) 
refers to the Selection-Orientation dilemma (p.350)  choosing between focusing on 
the relevant and disregarding the irrelevant. Attentional control involves being able to 
manage this cognitive conflict.  
3.3.2.8.3 Openness/mindfulness 
Mindfulness is increasing in popularity and is often considered in the context of 
meditation. Acceptance, curiosity and openness are all considered elements of 
Mindfulness (Baer et al., 2006; Bishop et al., 2004; Brown & Ryan, 2004). Langer (1989) 
defines western mindfulness (p.78) as; 1) creating new categories, 2) being open to 
new information and 3) awareness of more than one perspective (p.62). This ability for 
adaptive thinking to embrace and deal with the novel has also been referred to as fluid 
intelligence (Au et al., 2015; Jaeggi et al., 2008; Shipstead et al., 2016). Considered by 
some as a trait (Pirson et al., 2012; Sternberg, 2000) and even hereditary (Cattell, 1963; 
Gray, Chabris & Braver, 2003), others see the elements of being open to novelty, or 
mindful as a cognitive style or ability (Sternberg 2000 p.11), being in a flexible 
cognitive state (Haigh et al., 2011 p.23) that can fluctuate with mood and stress levels 
(Friedal et al., 2015; Stawski et al., 2010).   
Good felt that there were no suitable performance measures to measure explicitly, the 
cognitive aspects of being open (2009, p.719). Brown and Ryans Mindfulness Attention 
Awareness Scale (2003) primarily measures attentiveness and does not measure 
openness or curiosity (Kroon, van Woerkom & Menting, 2017). The open-ness section 
of the BFAS appears to measure an individuals propensity for aesthetic appreciation 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  129 
and mind-wandering rather than conscious information processing and the disruption 
of routine involved in the Western definition of mindfulness. Consequently, Good 
(2009) looked to the Langer Mindfulness Scale (LMS) to measure openness.  
At the time of Goods work, the LMS consisted of 46 items across 4 subscales: Novelty 
Seeking and Engagement, reflecting the awareness element of mindfulness and 
Novelty Producing and Flexibility reflecting the information processing element. Since 
then work by Pirson et al. (2012) reduced the LMS to three subscales; the flexibility sub-
scale having been dropped due to unreliability and a history of poor fit with the model 
(Bodner, 2000; Pirson et al., 2012). Pirson et al.,s (2012) large study of adults (5 
samples, total N=3104) explored the components of the LMS using an exploratory factor 
analysis (EFA) with principal axis factoring.  Factors below .4 were removed. A 
subsequent EFA resulted in a three-factor solution. CFA using the remaining 14 items 
resulted in good fit for a three-factor model (see table 3.5).

Table 3.5 The Three Subscales of the Langer Mindfulness Scale by Pirson, Langer, Bodner and Zilcha-Mano 
(2012) (R) denotes a reverse scoring item. 
In his research, Good used only the Novelty Seeking sub-scale of the four-factor model. 
However, Western based mindfulness is thought to involve information processing 
(Krieger, 2005 p.137), learning to switch modes of thinking, noticing new things and 
disrupting routines (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2006 p.516). Levinthal and Rerup (2006) point out 
that mindfulness requires being able to respond to diverse, changing stimuli (p.505). 
To do so, one must be engaged and aware of the environment in order to notice 
changes, which in turn results in the need for the learning and curiosity of the Novelty 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  130 
Seeking element and finally the Novelty producing element to generate novel solutions 
(Langer, 1989; Yeganeh, 2006).  Therefore, in order to assess mindfulness, as the 
Openness element of Cognitive Agility all three sub-scales of Langers Mindfulness Scale 
(LMS) are required and so were included in this study. 
As with Goods cognitive agility research, behavioural measures were included to test 
for divergent thinking. These tests are also used to test for fluid intelligence. 
3.3.2.8.4 Divergent thinking 
To test divergent thinking, Good (2009) used the Guilford Alternative Uses Test (AUT) 
(Wilson, Guilford & Christensen, 1953) and the prototypical divergent task (Gilhooly et 
al., 2007). Participants are required to generate as many uses for an object that they can 
think of with a view to assessing their creative or novel outputs (Dippo & Kudrowitz, 
2013; Silvia, Nusbaum, & Beaty, 2017). The outputs are evaluated against four elements 
of Divergent Thinking: fluency is measured by the number of responses: originality is 
measured by the by the number of responses that are not provided by other 
participants:  flexibility is a measurement of the number of different categories that the 
responses group into and elaboration is a measure of how descriptive each response is 
(Sawyer, 2011 p.47) 
There are limitations to this method.  
There is no way of knowing if the original idea was genuinely divergent, spawned from 
fluid intelligence, or whether the individual has seen or heard the idea before, thereby 
leveraging crystallised intelligence. Silva et al., (2017) developed a strategy to ask 
participants whether the ideas that they generated in the test were old or new and 
found that most initial outputs were based on convergent thinking.  Dippo et al., found 
that participants listed approximately nine ideas before arriving at ideas thought of by 
less than 10% of the participant group (2013, p.432). Therefore, it is likely that the AUT 
tests convergent thinking initially and then divergent thinking latterly and that both are 
necessary for creativity (Runco & Acar, 2012; Silvia et al., 2017; Vincent, Decker & 
Mumford, 2002) 
It is possible that the test could be more efficient in identifying creative ideas if 
participants were explicitly asked to be creative with their answers. Thus, when clear 
instructions on creativity were provided, the quality of participants creative responses 
improved (Harrington, 1975; Runco, Illies, & Eisenman, 2005; Silvia et al., 2008). In 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  131 
addition, Harrington found that such transparent test instructions and marking criteria 
improve the quality of creative outputs (1975). Harrington does acknowledge the risk 
that asking someone to be creative may generate anxiety thereby reducing 
performance. He therefore suggests that instructions and marking information should 
be provided in a non-threatening and possibly encouraging manner (p.451) 
The variety of methods used to mark the Alternative Uses Test (AUT) can make it 
difficult to compare results. Ratings have based on cleverness (Wilson et al., 1953) or 
uniqueness. However, the challenge with measuring uniqueness of idea was that as 
sample group sizes increased, ideas that less than 10% of other participants have 
thought of become increasingly scarce (Nusbaum & Silvia, 2011; Silvia et al., 2008; 
Wallach & Kogan, 1965). Measuring both fluency and originality has been described as 
confounding resulting in the test becoming nothing more than a verbal fluency test 
(Nusbaum & Silva, 2011 p.38). Indeed, quantity does not equate quality; Sawyer argues 
that not only should the ideas be unique but contextually relevant to be of value (2006). 
Therefore, it is essential that the test checks originality rather than simply production. 
Determining originality has been criticised as being a subjective process that cannot be 
objectively marked (McCrae, 1987 p.1260). It requires multiple markers to agree 
originality (Amabile, 1982). Silva et al. (2008) discuss the challenges of weak internal 
consistency (2008 p.68) of divergent thinking tasks that results from this. However, 
Amabile (1982) demonstrated that in fact, when assessing creativity, inter-judge 
reliabilities were high. McCrae (1987) also found high reliability between judges and 
suggested that a consensual assessment technique (CAT - Hennessey & Amabile, 1988 
p.14) should be considered (Silva et al., 2008). 
In testing divergent thinking, the AUT assesses the ability to generate multiple 
alternative problem solutions (Vincent et al., 2002 p.163) which results in the use of 
both convergent and divergent thinking. This is considered useful for testing the ability 
to cognitively flex, as the participant moves from one chain of thought to another, 
exploring new approaches to the item (Guilford, 1950, 1956). However, particularly in 
the context of the VUCA environment, in order to be able to adopt adaptive behaviour, 
what is required is the ability to solve novel problems independently of previously 
acquired knowledge (Barbey et al., 2014 p.486), also described as fluid intelligence (Gf).  
Over the past 70 years, the Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices (RPM) have been 
used extensively as measure of Gf (Barbey et al., 2014; Colom et al., 2004, 2009, 2013; 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  132 
Jaeggi et al., 2010; Schweizer et al., 2007; Stephenson & Halpern, 2013; Sternberg, 2008; 
Van der Meer et al., 2010; van der Ven & Ellis, 2000). The RPM uses abstract problem-
solving tests which require reasoning rather than previous knowledge (Horn & Cattell, 
1966; Stephenson & Halpern 2013; Shipstead, Harrison, & Engle, 2016) and this is 
considered the prototypical measure of fluid intelligence (Shipstead et al., 2016 
p.773).  
Pearsons RPM Technical Manual (2011) state that the RPMs internal consistency (in the 
US) as  =.85. Results are not impacted by mode of completion and have found to be 
globally applicable with internal consistency reliability scores across countries of rsplit = 
.79-.85. 
However, it has been suggested that the success at completing the matrices is not 
purely a result of Gf. The participants visio-spatial abilities (Schweizer, et al., 2007; 
Stephenson et al., 2003) and, due to its relationship with attentional control, working 
memory capacity (Carpenter, Just & Shell, 1990; Gray et al., 2003; Halford, Cowan & 
Andrews, 2007; Kane & Engle, 2002) are considered to contribute to completion success, 
particularly for the more difficult matrix problems (Schweizer et al., 2007). 
Both Gf and spatial representations in working memory depend on the same area of the 
brain  the frontal and parietal regions (Barbey et al., 2014) and so it is no surprise that 
Colom et al. (2004) found that completion of the RPM is a result of a combination of spatial 
ability and fluid intelligence.  Schwietzer et al. (2007) looked to identify how much of the 
completion of the RPM was a result of reasoning and spatial abilities. Although spatial 
ability showed strong correlations with RPM (visualisation: r=0.34, P<0.05, mental rotation: 
r- 0.27, p<0.05) reasoning demonstrated the highest correlation with RPM (r=0.68, p<0.05).  
This study followed that of Good (2009) and included RPM as well as AUT to test divergent 
thinking. 
In total, for employees, the questionnaire consisted of 124 Likert scale questions and three 
behavioural measures (See table 3.6).

Survey questions from the meaningfulness dimension questions were removed as they were not 
relevant for students. Similarly, for Psychological Safety, the 10 Co-Worker questions were 
omitted. This removed 32 questions. 
Finally, where the word work was mentioned in questions, this was replaced with here. For 
example, I am confident I can handle the physical demands at work was changed to I am confident 
I can handle the physical demands here. References to employees were replaced by the word 
students and supervisors by tutors.  Thus, for students, the final questionnaire consisted of 89 
data questions and two behavioural measures. 
The employee questionnaire consisted of 124 Likert scale questions and three behavioural measures. 
The Alternative Uses test was added with the instructions: In the next 2 minutes, write down as 
many uses you can for a ping pong ball (table tennis ball). You can be as creative as you like A timer 
was shown counting down and the participant was unable to move on until the timer was complete.  
The self-consciousness measure as described in section 3.3.2.5.3 was added to this survey. 
The questionnaires and behavioural measures were created in an online assessment tool PsyToolkit 
(https://www.psytoolkit.org/) designed specifically for psychological research studies (Stoet, 2010, 
2017).  The link to the questionnaire was provided in emails and communications. All participants 
were required to explicitly agree to take part in the survey.  
The responses were exported from psytoolkit into and Excel data file, which in turn was exported in 
SPSS version 22 for analysis. 
3.3.4 Quantitative Data Analysis Strategy 
Data was exported to IBM SPSS v22 
3.3.4.1 Question Responses 
Question answers were totalled, reverse scoring where required, creating the following 
variable LMSTOTAL, ACSTOTAL, PSTOTAL, AVAIL-1 (Availability minus self-consciousness), 
PSYCAPTOTAL (which included the totals of Hope, Optimism, Self-Efficacy and Resilience). 
Additional variables were calculated: 
 CFLEX: total cognitive flexibility score: LMSTOTAL +ACSTOTAL 
 HOSE: As one of the hypothesis was that resilience was an output of Psychological Capital 
this variable was created that included, Hope, Optimism and Self-Efficacy, but excluded

3.3.4.2 Task Switching Data 
Task switching data was exported into an Excel file and formulas used to calculate the time 
each respondent took to complete the letters section, the numbers section and the mixed 
section in microseconds.  These were then added as a variable in SPSS as TS Letters, TS 
Numbers and TS Mixed.   For each participant, the difference between their average 
completion time on the letters and mixed section and the numbers and mixed section was 
calculated and created as a percentage of original score. Finally, the average percentage 
difference was calculated. 
3.3.4.3 Ravens Advanced Matrices Data 
Scores for the Matrices were calculated as the number of correct answers.  
3.3.4.4 Alternative Uses Data 
The Alternative Uses Test results required some preparation. Of the 160 respondents who 
completed this task, there were over 881 individual suggestions as to possible uses for a ping 
pong ball.  Initial analyses involved calculating the number of ideas generated (fluency) and 
the level of uniqueness of the idea (Dippo & Kudrowitz, 2013; Wallach & Kogan, 1965). This 
approach required the identification of common categories across 890 responses. Unique 
responses were also noted: of the 890 responses, 24 were considered unique in the sense 
that they had not been identified by other participants. (See Appendix U) However, this 
resulted in several problems. 
Uniqueness as Hocevar (1981) points out, is a subjective construct. The boundary between 
unique and random is often fuzzy (Silvia et al., 2008 p.69).  Like Silvia et al. discovered 
bizarre, glib and inappropriate responses (2008 p.69) proved difficult to measure and 
score. Some were so left field that they were unique but the level of relevance was 
questionable, for example: 
 A ping pong ball can be used in frontline politics as its arguably no less articulate than Boris 
Johnson or Jeremy Hunt.  
Also, the nature of the unique ideas did not necessarily provide an indicator as to Gf or 
divergent thinking. Although the unique responses were only mentioned once, this did not 
necessarily mean they were creative.  For example, strap to the back of a car at a wedding 
to make noise or camera flash softener, although unique responses, both of these uses 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  136 
may have been experienced by the participant previously therefore generated from 
crystallised intelligence, i.e. what has been known and experienced rather than gf . If a person 
provided 25 answers and came up with one unique answer, in terms of originality, would 
this score be ranked as a better result than then person who was able to generate a unique 
answer after only 4 non-unique ideas?  
Measurement of the Alternative Uses was reconsidered, returning to the purpose of the 
exercise: to test divergent thinking, the ability to generate creative ideas by exploring many 
possible solutions. In the context of cognitive flexibility, divergent tasks involve executive 
cognitive process in order to manage interference from the default stereotypical uses of the 
object (Gilhooly et al., 2007; Nusbaum & Silvia 2011). Therefore, the extent to which an 
individual can come up with different types of uses may provide an indicator of divergent 
thinking. Troyer, Moscovitch and Winocur (1997) refer to this as switching, defined as how 
often someone switches between categories of use. Nausbaum and Silva demonstrated that 
those with higher gf  made significantly more category changes during the divergent thinking 
tasks although they also found that the same participants did not necessarily have more 
ideas per category (2011 p.40).  
 Therefore, the responses to alternative uses was re-measured using the number of 
categories of ideas rather than ideas themselves (Batey, Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 
2009; Hocevar, 1981).  For example, for a respondent who provided three ideas: table 
tennis, beer pong and tossing game; these would all be classed in one category; games.  
Analysis resulted in 37 categories, one of which was entitled Unique Responses. This 
provided each participant with a number that indicated the range of divergent categories of 
ideas generated in two minutes.  
3.3.5 Limitations 
In additional to the limitations of the behavioural measures discussed above, online survey 
completion is not without its challenges. Compared with surveys performed face to face, online 
surveys have a low response rate (Rice et al, 2017). Being online, surveys are easy to leave when 
distracted or interest wains (Buhrmester, Kwang & Gosling, 2011). Samples may not be 
representative of a general population (Wright, 2005), being accessible to only those who view a 
particular media or website. 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  137 
The quality of data from self-report surveys may be compromised as respondents answer according 
to what they believe the desired answer is, either deliberately or otherwise. Alternatively, responses 
are selected without reading the question in order to complete the task quickly. 
This survey utilises multiple existing measures all of which are based on Likert scale scoring. Although 
probably the most commonly used type of data gathering tool (Hartley, 2014; Jamieson, 2004; 
Nemoto & Beglar, 2014; Sullivan & Artino Jr, 2013) this is not without limitations. Specifically, for this 
study, a selection of existing 
questionnaires have been 
compiled together resulting 
in four different scales (see 
table 3.7). This has the 
potential to confuse 
respondents (Hartley, 2014). 
Furthermore, there is an 
assumption that the intervals 
between the scale values are 
equal (Carifio & Perla, 2007; Jamieson, 2004; Norman, 2010; Sullivan & Artino Jr., 2013). In using 
different scales, the interval between them will be different; a jump from 1 -2 in a four-point scale 
is a greater change than in a 7-point scale. Therefore, in comparing changes between each scale may 
compromise results. Of the four scales used, two have a neutral centre point which some 
researchers discourage on the grounds that it can compromise data validity (Johns, 2005; Nemoto & 
Beglar, 2014). However, there are also those who believe that the removal of the mid-point, thereby 
forcing answers, can itself compromise validity (Garland, 1991; Jamieson, 2004; Johns, 2005). 
Nevertheless, some scales effectively provided the opportunity for the participant to opt out of 
agreeing or disagreeing. 
All scales, with the exception of self-efficacy and hope, contain reverse items, a practise some frown 
upon, given that it may cause confusion (Hartley, 2014; Maeda, 2015). However, there are also those 
who believe that reverse scoring improves validity (Carifio & Perla, 2007). As the scope of this 
research was not to develop or test a new scale, scales were kept as they were, with the exception of 
some wording (see study design section) however the challenges of having a variety of scales was 
recognised. 
Common method variance (CMV) may occur while using self- report measures, particularly if the 
same respondent was used to obtain the data for the dependant and independent variables,

(Podsakoff et al., 2003). This can create inaccurate correlations between variables as participants 
attempt to maintain consistency between their responses. Where there are overlaps in constructs

4. Qualitative Study Analysis: Focus 
Groups  
The pre-assessment questionnaire (see figure 4.1) used in focus groups 1 and 2 was analysed, and 
results from the managers and non-managers compared (see figure 4.2). 
There were three questions in which 
all managers and non-manager 
answered Yes:  
 Question 5: My role provides 
interesting variety 
 Question 10: I am recognised 
for good work. 
 Question 18: I am happy to 
speak out in my team(s). 
The positive answer to question 18 
suggests that these participants 
generally felt psychologically safe. 
The questions with the largest 
difference between managers and 
non-managers were: 
No. Question

9. I feel I am appropriately rewarded for my role 40% 100% 
15. I am a member of more than one team 20% 50%

all just be ourselves.

S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  141 
In particular, the non-managers all agreed that there is no game playing we can all be ourselves. 
Overall, the non-manager responses suggest a more psychologically safe environment with more 
time outside of work than the managers. Only 50% of the managers felt there was no game playing 
and were more likely to be a member of more than one team and feel exhausted at the end of the 
day. Compared with the non-managers, they felt more competent and appropriately rewarded. 
The answer to the question Is the responsibility for Psychological Safety purely that of the 
organisation? was unanimously no. All groups agreed that it was a joint responsibility of the 
organisation, leader/manager and the individual employee. 
Outputs of all three focus groups were collated using the transcripts from focus groups 1 and 2 (see 
Appendix P) and the flip charts from focus group 3 (see Appendix Q). A summary of these outputs is 
shown in table 4.1 and table 4.2 below.

Focus Group 1: Non Managers Focus Group 2 : Managers 
element of trust towards your manager, if you know you are going to fail, you know, you 
say I dont think this is going to work and your manager actually believes you and says, yeah, 
we can do something else what do you suggest." 
Being a remote person is not easy, not easy because you dont have the same contact, so 
you dont have the same safety, you dont have the same support in many cases, you gotta 
be much more self- confident 
and youve got the old xxxx about knowledge being power, trust is about what they then 
do with that power. Whether its used against you, that, that would be a negative in related 
to trust. 
I get, just going to those, I get the feeling that we can, theres the time to talk, and there is 
plenty of meetings where we can talk so that, that makes me feel more comfortable umm, 
its more,  so its more open 
are power dynamicsit, you, know,  could be that, you know,  is what I am going to say 
gonna be a career limiting move 
Yeah I think you know you feel safe if someones got your back and you can reach out 
you tend to feel less safe if you dont see goals on a roadmap being accomplished That they are being listened to 
a better manager being a person of their word. If they say they will do something, if they 
say a position is protected, holding to that. If they offered a defence if you like to hold to it. 
Frequent contact I think for the remote members and thats definitively something we 
need to work on 
you might have terribly bad psychological relations in your team but very good ones with 
your manager, or visa versa or it might be that you feel psychologically safe around most of 
your team members except this one member who you dont trust as far as you can throw 
him, 
we do organise events, we organise meetings and things and it is about trying to break 
down inhibitions and get people to build relationships I mean thats why we do those events 
is cos we do want people to get to know each other a bit so they are not feeling concerned 
about the interpersonal relationships 
time I am not sure that will make you feel very Psychological Safe in that environment if 
you dont agree with that vision 
, there are teams or people in the company that have a higher weight in deciding an 
argument than others. Not necessarily always the right people , but mostly the right people 
definitely 
 I think its the culture cos Ive been in companies whereby if you do something wrong they 
would fire you. They will do anything they could to find a scape goat. 
INTRINSIC RESOURCES 
Focus Group 1: Non Managers Focus Group 2 : Managers 
 your self-esteem, your esteem your, your, self-respect Mental..capable of change 
persona They need to have that confidence, confidence in themselves 
lot of experience in their own ability They have to learn new stuff and they may not even want to anymore 
self-reliant person they dont get bogged down in old ways, same ways. 
They cant make themselves feel safe, the only thing they can do is arm themselves against 
the consequences of not being safe. Greater psychological robustness. 
Ive been in teams before this company where very carefully  on what you say because the 
people, the slightest criticism could set them off 
its kind of helpful when you have got people who can listen to each other, learn from each 
other. 
because its its not about whether somebody is you knowat a higher grade or a lower 
grade, it is their reaction to the information that, I mean if they attach emotion to that, 
sometimes that emotion is great cos its positive and somethings that emotion is 
detrimental because you either inadvertently threaten someone or their PS is in question 
Confidence comes from the fact that you cant really be a successful contractor and be 
incompetent 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  143 
they often have a lot of tenacity, a lot of staying power. and therefore it brings out you know scratch cat and box and you then have to work out 
how you are going to cope with that and I think everybody makes a judgement about that 
before they start a conversation 
so its airing an idea in front of lots of people is, is about getting those different 
perspectives, its a way of bringing together all that knowledge 
I think everybody assesses things on on whether the person that is receiving the message 
is adult. And thats, thats, psychologically adult rather than you know, age adult. 
was errm their ability to take management and be directed to improve upon it and to 
accept external input and a number of other interpersonal factors 
some traits not just knowledge, you are looking for ability to learn, to communicate you 
are looking for intelligence, you are looking for problem solving, you are looking for go to 
attitudes, 
they dont have the emotional engagement, they know that if they work for, if they are in 
an organisation that they find toxic or difficult, they know they only need to be there for 6 
months they dont have to make any kind of long term commitment to an organisation. 
Its very interesting because I think not everyone born in this world has the same capability 
for change some people are able  to take change in their stride, some people are much 
slower to adapt 
they might have unpredicatable reactions but they tend to be in a certain category or 
about a certain thing, whereas what you are worried about really more is personal volatility 
you know, you dont know what to expect 
well well, some people have to be in control or they need to feel in control of whats going 
on, whats happening to them whereas other people are a bit more like oh yeah you know, I 
get, I get the fact that I cant control everything and theres a big world out there that gonna 
happen to me and I have to learn how to deal with it. 
  I think you want people who can deal with those unexpected things artfully. you gotta be much more self- confident 
mean the adapting and changing is kinda critical in this environment to be able to turn 
around, adapt and change 
you definitely need people who are open minded and it comes back to that willingness to 
make mistakes or be prepared to make mistakes and willingness to learn and recognise that 
you dont know everything 
you ask if thats psychological robustness, Im not sure it is. I think its evolution. the ability to think through problems in different ways lateral thinking 
someone who is capable of synthesising new knowledge Sometimes not knowing,  they have to find the answer out 
You need somebody that, that xxxx evolves. Learning ability Id add emotional intelligence to that as well 
I think thats the talent shortagethe ability to synthesize new knowledge. To learn, to 
experiment, to discover things. 
To me the more experience you gain in the work environment or work in generally, the 
safer you feel in yourself 
or it could be a humility able to understand consequence and not be frightened of them 
I think thats a question of confidence Yeah but what he learns with that is agility 
Flexible really its problem solving and sort of logical thinking. 
  if they are still having the attitude of yeah I know everything, it should be my way, theyre 
not open minded, theyre not listening to everyone else they are not reacting, the agility 
you know 
 I think to me its ability to adapt to situations, unknown situations. 
 how can you adapt to a situation you know nothing about

Table 4.3 Table Showing Extrinsic And Intrinsic Resources That Result In Psychological Safety, As Identified By All Focus 
Groups; Duplicates And Synonyms Removed. 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  151 
Next, the identified resources were counted by the number of groups in which the resource was 
mentioned as a measure of the importance of each resource across individuals (see Appendix R).    
Twelve resources were mentioned in 50% or more of the groups (See table 4.4).  
4.1 Extrinsic Resource Analysis 
Although extrinsic resources are not the key focus of this study, for all focus groups, the response to 
the initial question What do you need to feel Psychologically Safe at work? resulted in participants 
first looking to extrinsic organisational resources.  Thus, those identified were mapped against Kahns 
Psychological dimensions model (1990).   All extrinsic resources from the focus group fell into the 
Meaningfulness or Psychological Safety dimensions (See table 4.5). Kahn does not mention 
Reassurance and Praise in his research although he recognises that feeling appreciated and 
receiving positive feedback are essential parts of work interactions, therefore this could also be 
mapped in the Meaningfulness Dimension. Group think not tolerated was not referred to in Kahns 
work, however, seeing criticism as constructive was indicative of an open and supportive climate and 
therefore could be mapped within the Psychological Safety dimension.

Organisational Flexibility was not mapped, although this could be considered a sub-component of 
Organisational Culture, shown in the Meaningfulness dimension. Food and Sustenance and Outside 
Support and Interests, although relevant for the Availability Dimension, are not cognitive resources 
and therefore were not mapped. The extrinsic resources identified by the focus groups also reflect 
the findings of James and colleagues (James & James, 1989; Jones & James, 1979) who, when 
working with the American Military, identified four determinants of Psychological Climate; Role 
Stress and Lack of Harmony, Job Challenge and Autonomy, Workgroup Co-Operation, Friendliness 
and Warmth and Leadership Facilitation and Support. Each of the outputs of the focus groups were 
mapped to these four determinants (see table 4.6). 
In being able to map the extrinsic resources to both Kahns Meaningfulness and Psychological Safety 
dimensions as well as James and James (1989) model of Psychological Climate, suggests that the 
organisation and leaders still have a key role to play in the provision of Psychological Safety. This 
supports extant research on Psychological Safety that Organisational and Management support are 
key contributors to Psychological Safety (Detert & Burris, 2007; Edmondson, 1999; Frazier et al., 
2017; Idris et al., 2012; Kahn, 1990; Nembhard & Edmondson, 2011). However, when participants 
were then asked if this meant that Psychological Safety was solely the responsibility of the 
organisation, all groups unanimously disagreed and felt it was a joint responsibility, the individual 
also having a role to play in their Psychological Safety.

Therefore, an alternative grouping was explored. 
Using the thematic analysis approach described in Chapter 3, the first theme that was identified 
across all researchers was that of demonstrable skills. Items one might put on a CV. For example, 
experience, expertise and communication skills. Initially this group included items such as creativity, 
innovation and problem solving.  A further group was created that was given a working title of 
Personal Attributes. This included confidence, self-esteem, humour and independent. The final 
group was referred to as Cognitive Skills and contained 57 of the intrinsic resources. 
This section was further divided by creating a group specifically for emotional regulation which 
contained 25 items. The remaining were labelled Cognitive Agility, defined as being able to think 
flexibility and in different ways. Having created four themes, it was clear that there were overlaps 
between them. For example, helpful beliefs could sit in both Cognitive Agility and Emotional 
Regulation. Self-Reliance in both Capabilities and Personal Attributes. 
Therefore, a Venn diagram was created and with overlaps between categories indicated. To 
determine a category, the question was asked, for this item, what is required? and Does an 
individual need cognitive agility, emotional regulation, a sense of self or skills to achieve this item? 
This resulted in the renaming of personal attributes to sense of self.  
Eight resources were identified as being common to all four groups (see figure 4.3 below) Two items 
were uncategorised: Life outside work/work life balance, which was debated as a extrinsic resources 
and no emotional investment in company, which was a comment specific to an organisation but it 
was felt it was covered generically in the term low emotional engagement.

Findings from these focus groups support Hypothesis 1 that individual employees have a role to play 
in the creation of their own Psychological Safety. Analysis from the output of the focus group 
suggest four key areas of intrinsic resources needed for Psychological Safety: Capabilities, Sense of 
Self, Emotional Regulation and Cognitive Agility.   
4.3 Limitations 
These focus groups were semi-structured to enable exploration and discussion. As a result, there 
was some time spent discussing less relevant topics. Managing this was the role of the researcher, 
who was able to refocus the discussion. However, this may have been seen as leading the group to 
support a confirmation bias.  
The relatively homogenous nature of the groups does not represent all professions or industries. 
Although the gender split was 45% male, 55% female, participants were predominantly white and 
well educated. The common responses in these focus groups did enable confirmation of hypotheses 
1, providing a justification for further quantitative research.

It may be argued that the self-selecting nature of participation would result in attendees who felt 
psychologically safe enough to participate. However, often examples given were from past 
experiences of feeling unsafe rather than in their current role, although this poses the risk of recall 
bias or response bias. 
All participants were reassured that their input would be confidential. For focus group three, the 
participants were attending a training course by choice and the environment considered a safe 
space. 
4.4 Discussion 
These findings support extant research that components of the employees environment such as 
trust (Butler, 1991; Payne & Clark, 2003) and being a team player (Bell, 2007; Driskell et al., 2006) 
are required for Psychological Safety. The results of studies of Psychological Safety in the workplace 
have shown improved employee resilience (Gordon & Coscarelli, 1996; Glantz & Sloboda, 2002; 
Kumpfer, 2002; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003; Staudinger et al., 1993; Vogus & Sutcliffe 2007), 
empowerment (Spreitzer, 1995) and team adaptation and learning (Burke et al., 2006; Edmondson, 
1999).   
Research has recognised that how the individual perceives and interacts with extrinsic mechanisms 
will affect their perceptions of Psychological Safety. In their meta-analysis on psychological climate, 
Baer and Frese (2003) found that perceptions of the organisation and leader had stronger 
correlations with psychological climate than with job perceptions. A similar finding by Edmondson et 
al. (2016) showed little relationship between Psychological Safety and job type in the healthcare 
sector. Perceptions of leadership effectiveness however were found to correlate significantly with 
Psychological Safety..  
Interestingly, although the literature has cited higher status and hierarchy in organisation to 
correlate with higher Psychological Safety (Bienefeld & Grote, 2014; Nembard & Edmondson, 2006) 
in some aspects of Psychological Safety, the managers in the focus groups scored lower than the 
non-managers. Perhaps being in a management position exposes you to information that may 
reduced your Psychological Safety.  
The findings of this focus group study support this research; that extrinsic organisational 
mechanisms are important to the creation of Psychological Safety. However, to date, there have 
been no studies to identify which are the intrinsic psychological resources required for Psychological 
Safety.

The outputs of these focus groups suggest that intrinsic resources that contribute to Psychological 
Safety are recognised by individuals and are important to them. Therefore, a more detailed, 
quantitative analysis was performed.

5. Quantitative Study Analysis 
5.1 Test for Power 
An a priori power anlaysis was performed using G*Power v 3.1 (Faul et al, 2007) to test the required 
sample size to perform a linear multiple regression analysis (R2 increase) for 8 predictors (Hope, 
Optimism, Self-Efficacy, LMS, ACS, Cognitive Resources, Emotional Resources, Outside Support). For 
Employees, the power calculation was performed using 9 predictors as self-conciousness included in 
their survey. A medium effect size (f2=.15), an alpha of .05 and  error of 0.80 was used.  Results 
showed that a total sample of 109 participants were required for the student study and 114 
participants for the employee study in order to have the desired probability of detecting and 
increase in R2.

5.2 Student Survey Analysis  
The survey was implemeneted as described in Chapter 3.   
5.2.1 Descriptives  
Of the 40 student respondents, 11 were in their 1st year, 2 in their 5th year, the remaining in their 2nd 
year of study. The age range fell between 17 and 29 (SD=1.964). Only three participants were male. 
The majority described themselves of White ethnic origin (78%), 10% described themselves as 
Asian, 10% as other. Only 1 participant was of African origin.

5.2.2 Test for Normality 
Descriptives and frequency analysis was run on the variables of LMS, ACS, Psychological Safety, 
Availability, Resilience and Psychological Capital and HOSE (see Appendix S).  The 5% Trimmed Mean 
for all variables were within acceptable suggesting normal distribution.  
Three possible outlier were identified: Participant 96 for LMS, participant 102 for Resilience and 94 
for HOSE. However, the removal of these three participants made an insignificant difference to the 
means as shown in table 5.2.

5.2.3 Behavioural Measures 
5.2.3.1 Task Switching 
Task switching data was exported into an Excel file and formulas used to calculate the time 
each respondent took to complete the letters section, the numbers section and the mixed 
section in microseconds.  These were then added as a variable in SPSS as TS Letters, TS 
Numbers and TS Mixed (see table 5.3).   For each participant, the difference between 
their average completion time on 
the letters and mixed section and 
the numbers and mixed section was 
calculated and created as a 
percentage of original score. Finally, 
the average percentage difference 
was calculated (see table 5.4).

5.2.3.2 Ravens Advanced Matrices 
The minimum score was 1 achieved by 3 (7.5%) of 
participants. The maximum score of 8 was achieved 
by only 1 person (2.5%). The mean score was 4.03 
(SD=1.834). 
5.2.3.3 The Alternative Uses Test 
Only three students completed this section, one of 
which filled the answer space with random letters. 
Therefore, the data was excluded. 
5.2.3 Correlation Analysis  
A correlation analysis was conducted to determine whether 
the predicted relationships between variables were present. 
Bonferroni correction adjusted the p value to p=.006. Significant correlations with Psychological 
Safety were Psychological Capital (r=.445, p=.004) and HOSE (r=.431, p=.005).  
Psychological Capital showed significant and strong positive correlations with Resilience (r=.816, 
p<.000), Availability (r=.784, p<.000) and as expected HOSE (r=.979, p<.000). 
HOSE was significantly correlated with resilience (r=.683, p<.000) and Availability (r=720, p<.000)  
CFLEX strongly positively correlated with resilience (r=.610, p=.000) and moderately positively with 
Psychological Capital (r=.546, p=.000), HOSE (r=.478, p=.002) and Availability (r=.466, p=.002). 
However there was no significant correlation with Psychological Safety.  
None of the results from the behavioural measures correlated significantly with any of the variables.

Correlation analysis was performed using the subcomponents of Psychological Capital and 
Availability. Bonferroni correction adjusted the significant p value to .005. As a result, the 
only significant correlation for Psychological Safety was with Optimism (r=.505, p=.001).  
The components of Psychological Capital, moderately and positively correlated with each 
other with the exception of Resilience and Hope (r=.394, p=.012).  
The cognitive flexibility measures correlated with self-efficacy (LMS, r=517, p=.001: ACS, 
r=407, p=.001) and resilience (LMS, r=579, p=.000). 
See table 5.6 below and Appendix T for full sized text. 
The significance of relationships between 
Psychological Capital and other variables 
was little changed when resilience was 
removed (variable HOSE) (see table 5.7). 
Furthermore, Availability had a high

This raises two areas for further consideration. Firstly, are Availability and HOSE or 
Psychological Capital measuring the same construct and secondly does resilience 
contribute to Psychological Capital? 
In order to explore whether Availability and HOSE measure the same construct in this 
population, an exploratory factor analysis was performed. 
5.2.4 Exploratory Factor Analysis 
An exploratory factor analysis using principal components analysis and direct oblimin rotation was 
performed. 
All 42 of the HOSE and Availability questions were input into the analysis.  However, the analysis was 
inconclusive as the matrix was not positive definite; 9 of the 42 questions were found to have a 
negative eigenvalue. This error may be due to insufficient observations for the number of variables 
put into the factor analysis. Therefore, the analysis was split, performing an EFA on the items of 
HOSE and Emotional Resources, HOSE and Cognitive Resources and finally Resilience and Availability. 
The first analysis consisted of all HOSE questions and the 8 emotional resource questions were 
added to the principal components analysis (29 
questions in total). The resulting KMO was .487 
(see table 5.8) which suggests is low sampling 
adequacy (Field, 2016, p877).  Pallant (2016) 
suggests that the KMO should be .6 or above in 
order to have adequate sampling adequacy. Therefore, the size of the student sample was 
inadequate to perform an EFA on this number of items. 
The remaining EFA analyses all produced low KMOs suggesting an inadequate sampling size: HOSE 
and Cognitive Resources (26 items, KMO = .511), Resilience and Availability (21 items, KMO = .590) 
and Resilience and HOSE (21 items each. KMO = .531)  
5.2.5 Regression Analysis 
5.2.5.1 Psychological Safety 
Regression analysis was performed to test the hypothesis that psychological resources 
predicted Psychological Safety. A standard linear regression analysis was performed using 
the Enter method and probability of F between .05 and.10 as recommended by Field 
(2016).  Each variable was added to enable comparison. When Psychological Capital and

University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  167 
HOSE were used as independent predictors of Psychological Safety, there was little 
difference in variance explained (see table 5.9).  
Psychological Capital and HOSE demonstrated small but significant variances in 
Psychological Safety. Psychological Capital accounted for 18% of the variance in 
Psychological Safety (R2adj =.177, p=.004). HOSE accounted for 17% of the variance in 
Psychological Safety (R2adj=.165, p=.005). This suggests that the inclusion of resilience in 
the Psychological Capital model accounts for only 1% of the variance. However, as 
Psychological Capital accounted for the greatest variance in Psychological Safety, a 
stepwise regression was performed on the variables of Psychological Capital to determine 
which components of Psychological Capital predicted Psychological Safety.

The Stepwise Regression demonstrated that only the Optimism component of 
Psychological Capital accounted for 24% of the variance in Psychological Safety (R2adj 
=.235, p=.001) (See table 5.10).  
This analysis suggests that for students, only Optimism is a predictor of Psychological 
Safety (see figure 5.1). 
A scatterplot shows a positive linear relationship between Psychological Safety and 
Optimism, suggesting that as hypothesised, the greater the psychological resource of 
optimism, the greater the Psychological Safety (R2linear = .277; see figure 5.2).

5.2.5.2 Resilience 
The hypothesis that the HOSE model (Hope, Optimism and Self-Efficacy combined into one 
measure) would be a strong predictor of Psychological Safety with resilience as an output 
was unable to be tested due to the small data sample. However, correlation and regression 
analysis have indicated that resilience adds little statistically to HOSE. As resilience is 
hypothesised to be an output of psychological resources, a regression analysis was 
performed to determine the predictors of resilience with HOSE, Cognitive Flexibility and 
Availability as independent variables. 
Regression analysis using the Enter method indicated that HOSE, Cognitive flexibility 
(CFLEX) and Availability were significant predictors of Resilience and that, in combination, 
these variables explained 67% of the variance in resilience (p<.000). (See table 5.11). 
To determine which components of HOSE, Cognitive Flexibility and Availability were the 
strongest predictors of Resilience, a stepwise regression analysis using Resilience as the DV 
and the components of HOSE (Hope, Optimism, Self-efficacy), CFLEX (LMS and ACS) and 
Availability (Outside Support, Emotional Resources and Cognitive Resources) as the IVs, 
was performed. This indicated that cognitive resources account for 54% of the variance in 
resilience (R2adj=.536 p <.000) and LMS, Emotional Resources and Self-efficacy accounted 
for a further 22% of the variance (see table 5.12).

5.2.6 Limitations 
Clearly the limitation with this study is the low number of participants, achieving only 37% of the 
required numbers identified in the power analylsis in section 5.1. A post-hoc power analysis using a 
medium effect size (f2=0.15) and an  error probability of.05 indicated a power (1- error 
probability) of 0.28.  Power results less than .80 (Field, 2016) are considered insufficient for 
statistical significance. Therefore, the results of this study should be treated with caution. 
 5.2.7 Discussion 
Despite the small cohort, this is the first study that has evaluated the individual psychological 
resources that contribute to Psychological Safety and it suggests that for students, Optimism 
accounts for 24% of the variance in Psychological Safety.  
The regression analysis suggested that Resilience contributes little to Psychological Capital as the 
difference in variance between HOSE (with no measure of resilience) and Psychological Capital 
(includes resilience) was significant but small. When analysed as a DV, Cognitive and emotional 
resources predicted resilience as well as the openness element of cognitive flexibility and the self-
efficacy component of HOSE. Combined they accounted for 75% of the variance in resilience. This 
supports extant research that resilience is a result of a combination of psychological factors (Egeland 
et al., 1993; Glantz & Sloboda, 2002; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003).  
Although a small sample of those not in employment, it has raised questions for future research 
which are discussed in Chapter 7. Furthermore, the study had demonstrated the useability of the 
Psytookit software enabling the progression of the employee study.  Thus, the next study focused on 
employee participants to determine whether the same patterns were found in a more mature 
working sample. 
5.3 Employee Survey Analysis 
The survey was administered as described in Chapter 3. 
However, one question in the attentional control survey (ACS) needed rewording as this 
questionnaire was devised for a student population: It is difficult for me to co-ordinate my 
attention between listening and writing/typing when taking notes during lectures was amended to 
It is difficult for me to co-ordinate my attention between listening and writing/typing when taking 
notes in meetings.

5.3.1 Descriptives 
Of the 160 completed data sets, participant ages ranged between 20-65 years (Mean= 35.86, SD = 
9.973). The gender balance of respondents was 52.5% male and 93.8% of all respondents described 
themselves of white ethnicity.  Participants were predominantly degree educated or higher (76.2%).  
Although the IT industry was not specifically targeted, in fact this proved to be the largest industry 
type (34 respondents, 21.3%).  Initially 25 respondents indicated that they worked in Other 
industries. However, some of these were reallocated, for example Insurance to Financial Services 
and Oil & Gas to Construction/ Engineering/Mining. A new category was created: Manufacturing, 
which 11 respondents had indicated as their industry. This resulted in 5 industries being combined in 
the Other category: Fashion, Childcare, Publishing, Logistics and Automation and a German 
participant individual who had written Technischer Leiter (technical manager) (See figure 5.5) 
In response to the question asking how long the participant had worked in their industry, 30.6% had 
worked for more than 10 years, 26.3% between 1-3 years. The type of role represented was 
overwhelmingly Sales/Marketing both for those in the IT industry (78.8%) and those in other 
industries (21.3%). (See figure 5.6). 
Not surprisingly, given the high proportion of participants from the IT industry, over 74% indicated 
that they were in at least one remote team (103 participants), short term team (31 participants) or 
Figure 5.5 Bar Chart Indicating Percentage of Employee Respondents by Industry. 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  174 
multiple teams (52 participants). Only 42 
participants indicated that they work in none of 
these. Given the demographics of the participants, 
it appears to be representative the Knowledge 
Industry: experienced and qualified individuals, 
working in fast moving industries and primarily 
remote teams. However, there is poor ethnic 
diversity. This reflects the situation in the UK 
technology industry where only 15% of technology 
jobs are filled by those from Black, Asian and 
Ethnic minorities (ONS, National Population 
Survey, 2017 
https://technation.io/insights/report-2018/jobs-and-skills/).  
5.3.1 Test for Normality 
As before, the variables of Psychological Capital (Hope+ Optimism+ Self-efficacy + Resilience) and 
HOSE (Hope+ Optimism+ Self-efficacy) and CFLEX (LMS + ACS) were checked for normality. All 
variables except one were within -0.5 and 0.5 of Skewness indicating the data was within the 
suggested range for symmetry. Similarly, Kurtosis for all variables fell within the -1 to +1 range (see 
table 5.13).

participant 27, appeared as a consistent outlier across all variables and as an outlier in box-plots.

(See figure 5.7). Removal of this participant made insignificant impact on either correlations, 
skewness or kurtosis. Therefore, this participant remained in the dataset.  
5.3.2. Correlation Analysis  
This study sought to assess the relationships between Psychological Safety and psychological 
resources. A correlation analysis is a useful technique to test hypothesised relations between 
variables. Therefore, as an initial analysis, correlation was performed on the variables measuring 
Cognitive Flexibility (CFLEX), Task Switching results (AvTSPCDiff), Ravens Matrices Results 
(RAVENTOTAL), results from the Alternative Uses Test (ALTUSESTOTAL), Meaningfulness total, 
Psychological Safety  totals, Availablity Totals and resilience totals. Both HOSE and Psychological 
Capital totals were input into the analysis. (see table 5.14). A Bonferroni calculation adjusted the p 
value to .005. 
As with the student data, all correlations for the Ravens Matrice Scores and Task Switching were 
weak at best and in all but three cases statistically non-significant (see table 5.14). Therefore no 
further analysis took place.  
The Alternative Uses correlations were statistically significant but correlations were weak.  The 
maximum number of categories an individual identified was 14. Most participants identified 
between 3 and 6 categories (91, 57%). The mean was 4.92 (SD=2.548).

The measure of Psychological Safety, correlated significantly and positively with all psychological 
resources and with Meaningfulness. This suggests that both intrinsic and extrinsic resources 
contribute to Psychological Safety. Interestingly, the correlation between Psychological Safety and 
HOSE is very slightly stronger than the full Psychological Capital variable that includes resilience (r= 
.565 vs r=.535, p<.000). Again, correlations with psychological resources and HOSE did not differ 
significantly from the correlations with Psychological Capital, suggesting a low contribution of 
Resilience to this factor (see table 5.15).  
Once again, Availability and HOSE were highly and 
positively correlated (r=.720, p <.000) suggesting a 
strong linear relationship between them.  
As with the student data, Psychological Safety and 
Resilience was weakly correlated (r=.281, p<.000). 
However, resilience had a strong positive 
correlation with HOSE (r=.632, p < .000), 
Availability (r=.524, p<.000) and CFLEX (r=.511, 
p<.000) suggesting that there may be a relationship between the psychological resources of 
Availability, LMS, ACS and HOSE and resilience.   
A further correlation analysis was performed on the sub components of the cognitive resource 
variables; HOSE, Availability, resilience and Psychological Safety.  The experiment data was excluded. 
Psychological Safety had the strongest correlation with Hope (r=.551, p<.000) and Optimism (r=.543, 
p<.000).   (See table 5.16).

S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  179 
 The strong correlation between Availability and HOSE appeared to be a result of cognitive resources 
and emotional resources being highly positively correlated with all the variables of HOSE (see table 
5.17). 
The correlation between Resilience and HOSE 
was predominately driven by self-efficacy 
(r=.630, p<.000) and hope (r=.560, p<.000). 
Resilience also was highly correlated with the 
cognitive resources component of Availability 
(r=.594, p<.000). There was a moderate (and 
identical) correlation between resilience and 
the two CFLEX components of openness (LMS: 
r=.426, p<.000) and attentional control (ACS: r=.426, p<.000).  
5.3.3 Confirmatory Factor Analysis 
Hypothesis 3 challenges Luthans Psychological Capital model, arguing that resilience should be 
excluded from the model. As with the original Psychological Capital model (2007a), the CFA was 
performed on the data from questions for hope, optimism, self-efficacy and resilience with AMOS 
version 22 using Maximum Likelihood extraction method. The SRMR and CFI were both measured, 
reflecting the analysis used by Luthans et al. (2007a). The acceptable level for SRMR varies from 
below .05 (Hooper, Coughlan & Miller, 2008) to below .08 (Hu & Bentler, 1999; Kline, 2005). The 
closer to zero the better the fit. In contrast, for CFI the closer the value to 1, the better the fit. 
Acceptable levels are cited as above .95 (Hu & Bentler, 1999), .90 (Kline, 2005) or .80 (Bollen, 1989, 
in Moss, 2016). Luthans et al., (2007a) also used RMSEA, however, for smaller samples such as this, 
the Chi-squared statistic is considered a more acceptable measure (Kenny, 2015). 
Mirroring Luthans et al.s (2007a) analysis, a CFA was performed on the four components of 
Psychological Capital model including resilience. This demonstrated a fit of 2 = 12.732, (2/.002), 
SRMR of .0423 and CFI of .954. Both the CFI and SRMR fell within acceptable levels (see figure 5.8).

The model was run again, this time placing resilience as a separate construct. This proved to be a 
stronger fit model, with a higher Chi-square (2 = 76.750, (26/.000), CFI = .894, SRMR = .0640,) (see 
figure 5.9).

Hypothesis 5 was that Cognitive Flexibility should be included as part of the new HOSE model was 
tested, again using CFA. The addition of ACS and LMS to HOSE increased the strength of the model 
(2 = 21.378, (5/.001), CFI = .933, SRMR = .0543) (see figure 5.10) 
The results of this CFA suggested that the model HOSE plus LMS and ACS is stronger model than 
Psychological Capital model.   
5.3.4 Exploratory Factor Analysis 
The correlation analysis had shown strong relationships between some variables, specifically the 
relationship between Availability and HOSE (r=.720, p=.001) and Resiliences correlation with the 
HOSE component of self-efficacy (r=.630, p<.000), hope (r=.560, p<.000) and cognitive resources 
(r=.590, p<.000) 
Further analyses took place to provide more information on the relationship between variables, 
specifically whether they were measuring separate constructs. To do so, an exploratory factor 
analysis was performed. To ensure the data were measuring separate constructs, an exploratory 
factor analysis (EFA) was performed using principal components analysis. Given the strength of the 
correlations between the variables, direct oblimin was used as the rotation method.

HOSE and Two Cognitive Flexibility Variables: (LMS and ACS) 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  182 
An EFA was conducted to determine whether the strong correlation between Availability and HOSE 
was the result of these questions measuring one factor. The questions from each variable were 
added (44 questions in total) to the EFA.  This 
produced a KMO Measure of .862, suggesting the data 
was suitable for rotation (see table 5.18)  
The EFA produced an 11-factor model (see table 5.19) 
with a break at factor 4, accounting for 50% of the 
variance (see figure 5.11).  
Four Cognitive Resource items loaded onto 
factor 1. Factor 2 contained all of the Self-
efficacy items. Factor 3 consisted of the three 
self-consciousness questions.  The four agency 
questions in hope and one reversed scored 
optimism question loaded onto factor 4. (See 
table 5.19). Overall, the outputs of the EFA 
suggest that the questionnaires are measuring 
separate constructs.

5.3.5 Regression Analysis 
5.3.5.1   Psychological Safety 
Hypothesis 1 was that those with more psychological resources would have higher 
Psychological Safety, Hypothesis 4 was that those with more psychological resources would 
have higher levels of Resilience. To explore the resources that predicted Psychological 
Safety and Resilience regression analyses were performed.  
As with the student data, a linear regression analysis was conducted using the Enter 
method and probability of F between .05 and.10 was used, as recommended by Field 
(2016).  
Using Psychological Safety as the dependant variable, a stepwise regression analysis was 
performed on the high level variables of CLFEX, Meaningfulness, Availability, HOSE and 
Resilience. 
This showed that the external resource of Meaningfulness is still the primary predictor of 
Psychological Safety, accounting for 41% of the variance (R2adj=.411, p<.000). (See table 
5.20). 
The regression analysis was repeated using the intrinsic resources of HOSE and CFLEX (see 
table 5.21).

 In order to determine which of the HOSELA components best predicted Psychological 
Safety, a stepwise regression was then performed using the sub-components of HOSE, LMS 
and ACS (see table 5.22) 
This indicated that Hope accounted for 30% of the variance in Psychological Safety, with 
Optimism adding a further 7% (R2adj=.365, 
p<.000).   
Self-Efficacy and the cognitive flexibility 
variables did not predicate any further variance 
in Psychological Safety.   
This suggests that for Employees, the 
Psychological Capital components of Hope and 
Optimism are the key predictors of 
Psychological Safety (see figure 5.12). .  
5.3.5.2 Resilience 
Extant research suggests that resilience is a consequence of multiple resources (Bonanno, 
2004; Cicchetti & Garmezy, 1993; Egeland et al., 1993; Glantz & Sloboda, 2002; Masten et 
al., 1990; McCubbin, 2001; Rutter, 1987; Staudinger et al., 1993; Van Den Heuvel et al., 
2010). Now removed from the Psychological Capital model, in order to identify which 
psychological resources predicted Resilience, a regression analysis was performed using 
Resilience as the DV.   
 Regression Analysis using the Enter method demonstrated that HOSELA accounted for 
43% of the variance in Resilience (R2adj=.431, p <.000) (see Table 5.23)

A stepwise regression on the HOSE, LMS and ACS variables resulted in the exclusion of 
LMS. The Availability variable was added to a stepwise regression analysis, but was also 
excluded demonstrating that HOSE and ACS accounted for 43% of the variance in resilience 
(see table 5.24).  
In order to test which psychological resources best predicted resilience, the components of 
HOSE, LMS and ACS were added to a stepwise regression analysis (see table 5.25). 
The strongest predictor of resilience for employees was self-efficacy (R2adj = .393, p<.000), 
with hope adding a further 5% and ACS a further 2%. Thus the model for employees is shown 
in figure 5.13.

5.3.6 Predictors of HOSE & ACS 
Data modelling had indicated that the Psychological Capital model was stronger with the inclusion of 
LMS and ACS. And yet LMS was not shown as a significant predictor for Psychological Safety or 
resilience and ACS accounted for only 2% of the variance in Resilience. However as shown in section 
5.2. 5.1 correlations did suggest positive linear relationships between each of the resource variables 
and Hope, Optimism and Self-efficacy and a negative linear relationship with self-consciousness as 
predicted.  This confirms the resource model theories, that those with higher resources have higher 
hope, optimism and self-efficacy (Hobfoll, 2002; Holahan & Moos, 1991; Holahan et al.,., 1999; 
Lazarus & Folkman, 1987).To further test this a stepwise regression analysis was run on each of the 
HOSE variables as DVs and the remaining psychological resources as independent variables. 
Using Hope as the DV, a stepwise regression analysis was performed using the remaining intrinsic 
psychological resources as IVs: Optimism and Self-efficacy, cognitive resources, emotional

resources, self-consciousness, ACS and LMS. In total optimism, self-efficacy and cognitive resources 
predicted 51% of the variance in Hope (R2adj=.513, p<.000). (See table 5.26). 
The variables of emotional resources and hope predicted 50% of the variance in Optimism 
(R2adj=.501, p<.000). (See table 5.27). 
For self-efficacy, there were four predictors accounting for 52% of the variance (R2adj=.515, p<.000) 
(see table 5.28). 
Finally, Cognitive Resources and Self-efficacy accounted for 23% of the variance in ACS. (See table

As before, scatterplots were run to illustrate relationships between these variables.  A positive linear 
relationship was indicated between all variables with the exception, as expected, of self-

The findings of this analysis resulted in a three layer model for employees (see figure 5.18) 
5.3.7 Limitations 
A post hoc power analysis analysis using a medium effect size (f2=0.15) and an  error probability 
of.05 indicated a power (1- error probability) of 0.94.  This suggests that, unlike with the student 
sample, the employee sample was sufficient to achieve statistical significance.  
However, all analysis was performed on self-rating questionnaires, therefore there is a risk of 
participant bias. Using the same participants to measure all variables offers a risk of common 
method variance. However, a PCA indicated that the questions were measuring different constructs. 
Furthermore, as recommended by Tehseen, Ramayah and Sajilan (2017), the Harmans single factor 
test was performed on the data set.  The test indicated that the un-rotated principle components 
analysis resulted in 69 factors accounting for 70% of the variance. The first un-rotated factor 
generated 22% of the variance in data. Thus, no single factor emerged and the first factor did not 
capture most of the variance. Therefore, this suggests that CMV was not an issue in this study. 
However future research might benefit from the compilation of data from other sources such as 
managers, team members and peers to improve data quality.

The participants in the employee were relatively homogenous in ethnicity and were almost all at 
least degree educated. This reflects the stiituation in the UK technology industry where only 15% of 
technology jobs are filled by those from Black, Asian and ethnic minorities (ONS National Population 
Survey, 2017. https://technation.io/insights/report-2018/jobs-and-skills/).  However, the findings in 
this study cannot be presented as representative of other ethnicities or occupations that require 
fewer educational qualifications.  
5.3.8 Discussion 
This study explored the relationship between psychological resources (as defined by Luthans 
Psychological Capital model and Kahns Availability model) and Psychological Safety.  
For students, Psychological Safety was predicted Optimism (R2adj=.235, p=.001).  However, for 
employees, Psychological Safety was predicted by Hope and Optimism (R2adj=.365, p<.000).  Hope 
was predicted by cognitive resources and self-efficacy (R2adj=.513, p<.000).  
As psychological resources were shown to predict Psychological Safety, H1 was also supported: 
Individual employees have a role to play in creating their own Psychological Safety.  This does not 
suggest that Edmondsons work on Psychological Safety as a team construct is not valid: Edmondson 
concedes the individual has a role to play, stating that Psychological Safety is both an intra and inter-
personal construct (2003). Edmondson et al. (2016) also argued that individual and self-regulatory 
processes need to be considered in the context of Psychological Safety. Findings suggest that 
particular psychological resources can contribute to an individuals Psychological Safety and these 
change with age or maturity. 
Results also demonstrated that the greater the levels of cognitive resources and self-efficacy, the 
greater the level of hope. Optimism was predicted by emotional resources. This supports H2: 
Employees with higher levels of intrinsic psychological resources, as measured by Kahns Availability 
dimension and Luthans Psychological Capital model, have higher levels of Psychological Safety.  
Luthans Psychological Capital model includes Resilience. However, extant research defines 
resilience as the process of leveraging resource, thus the relationship of resilience the Psychological 
Capital model was examined. Comparison of correlations between Psychological Capital and 
Psychological Safety and the resource variables of Availability and CFLEX showed little statistical 
difference to that between HOSE, Psychological Safety and the resource variables, raising the 
possibility that resilience contributed little to the results. A CFA analysis demonstrated that the 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  195 
Psychological Capital model produces a better fit when resilience is excluded as an input to 
Psychological Capital. These findings support H3: Resilience is redundant in the Psychological Capital 
model as Resilience itself is an output of Hope, Optimism and Self-efficacy.  
Supporting extant research, for both studies, resilience was predicted by multiple resources and at 
least once component of Cognitive flexibility. H5, that Cognitive Flexibility a new component of 
Psychological Capital to replace Resilience, was supported, creating a new Psychological Capital 
model of Hope + Optimism + Self-Efficacy + Cognitive Flexibility. The inclusion of LMS and ACS with 
HOSE reduced the strength of the model compared with only the HOSE variables but was a stronger 
fit than the original Psychological Capital model.  
Analysis using resilience as a dependant variable showed support for H4: Employees with higher 
levels of intrinsic psychological resources, as measured by Kahns Availability dimension and Luthans 
Psychological Capital model will have higher levels of Resilience. 
For employees, the key resources for resilience were self-efficacy and hope with ACS adding a 
further 2% to the variance. These findings reflect research by Gillespie et al. (2007a) on the resilience 
of nurses (N=772). Using the same measures as this study they showed a strong association between 
resilience and Hope and Self-efficacy.  
Self-Efficacy was predicted by Hope (R2adj=.344, p<.000), Cognitive Resources, Self-Consciousness 
and LMS accounted for a further 18% in the variance of Self-Efficacy (R2adj=.515, p<.000). ACS was 
predicted by Cognitive Resources and Self-Efficacy (R2adj= .233, p<.000).   
Although Resilience and Psychological Safety were shown to be predicted by psychological 
resources, H6, a positive correlation between Psychological Safety and Resilience was only partially 
supported. Correlations between Psychological Safety and Resilience were weak for both employees 
(r= .281, p<.000) and students (r=.377, p<.016).  
This apparent lack of relationship was a surprise but may be accounted for by having different 
psychological resources as predictors: Hope predicting 30% of Psychological Safety and self-efficacy 
predicting 39% of Resilience. Although for employees Psychological Safety and resilience share a 
predictor in the form of Hope, it accounts for only 5% of the variance in Resilience. This is interesting 
for organisations as it suggests mechanisms to develop resilience may not be the same as for 
developing Psychological Safety.  
In order to test Hypothesis 7: Given the state-like nature of Hope + Optimism + Self-Efficacy + 
Cognitive Flexibility interventions to develop these skills will increase levels of Psychological Safety 
and Resilience a longitudinal training study was performed.

6. Training Study 
The antecedents of Psychological Safety and Resilience in this study have been demonstrated to 
include the attitudes of Optimism and Self-Efficacy. Attitudes can be formed implicitly through 
parental relationships (DeHart, Pelham & Tennan, 2006; Sinclair, Dunn & Lowery, 2005), socialisation 
(Sinclair et al., 2005) and cultural environment (Banaji, Nosek & Greenwald, 2004) and are 
considered to be formed both spontaneously, with limited awareness and as a result of conscious 
consideration (Devos, 2008; Olson & Fazio, 2001). 
Implicit attitudes were once considered to be stable and resistant to change (Bohner & Dickel, 2011; 
Devos, 2008; Gregg, Seibt & Banaji, 2006; Petty & Brinol, 2010) however there are those who argue 
that implicit attitudes are flexible and can be changed (Blair, 2002; Devos. 2008; Gawronski & 
Bodenhausen, 2006; Govan & Williams, 2004). Research has shown that implicit attitudes can be 
influenced by the need to maintain self-image (Fein & Spencer, 1997; Sinclair & Kunda, 1999; 
Spencer et al., 1998) and the context such as referent social groups attitudes (Fiske, 1998; Sechrist 
& Stangor, 2001).   
A longitudinal study was designed to determine whether the attitudes of Optimism and Self-Efficacy 
could be increased through the provision of a training workshop, and if so, whether this would have 
any impact on Psychological Safety or Resilience.  As attitudes are evaluative processes, the 
workshop aimed to provide participants with the tools develop sufficient psychological resources to 
be able to consciously select their attitude. For example, focus of attention has been shown to affect 
the automatic formation of attitudes: where there is a lack of attention, attitudes are more likely to 
be formed automatically (Blair, 2002; Fiske, 1998).  
6.1 Sample 
Participants were managers from a variety of sectors who were attending a three-year BA in Applied 
Management as part of an apprenticeship program with Henley Business School. The half day 
workshop was included as part of the Personal Effectiveness module and was taught at the end of 
year 1. The workshop was run with three separate cohorts which included a total of 64 delegates.  
The average age of the participants was 36.31 years (SD= 7.727) 56.9% were females and 78.4% 
described themselves as of White ethnicity.

6.2 Procedures and Methods  
The study was designed to gather data from employees about their optimism, self-efficacy, 
Psychological Safety and resilience via an online questionnaire before attending a half day workshop. 
The questionnaire was repeated 4-6 weeks later to determine if there were any changes in 
Psychological Safety, resilience or their antecedents.  
In order to encourage completion, a shortened version of the questionnaire from study 2 was used 
(see Appendix W).  As the purpose of the longitudinal study was to measure psychological resources 
only questions from LMS, ACS, Psychological Safety, Availability and the four Psychological Capital 
variables were used. This resulted in a total of 105 questions. The average completion time was 
14.09 minutes. 
A link to the questionnaire was added to the Henley Learning Portal for participants to complete as 
part of pre-work for the workshop. The purpose of the questionnaire was made clear and that 
completion was voluntary. Before beginning the questionnaire, participants were required to 
provide explicit consent to proceed.   
The four-hour workshop was delivered as designed and detailed in the lesson plan, with one 15 
minute break half way through. The purpose of the workshop was to enable participants to manage 
their attitudes of optimism, self-efficacy and hope. To do so, tools and techniques to develop or 
maintain the cognitive resources needed to be able to consciously evaluate their attitudes were 
provided.   
Four weeks after the workshop a link to a second questionnaire was distributed via the learning 
portal. This was shorter questionnaire as no demographic information was required. This reduced 
the average completion time to 12.38 minutes. A unique identifier created by the participant at t1 
was used to match up the data. 
Reminders were sent out 5 and 6 weeks after the workshop to maximise completion rates. 
All 64 delegates were sent the questionnaire before the workshop and a total of 51 completed at 
time 1 (79.7%) and 27 completed at time 2. In addition, as part of the degree requirement all 
participants wrote a reflective piece about the entire years module from which qualitative data was 
drawn.

6.2.1 Workshop Content 
The Penn Resilience Program run at the University of Pennsylvania, focuses on emotional and 
cognitive fitness, strength of character and strong relationships 
(https://ppc.sas.upenn.edu/resilience-programs/resilience-skill-set). In addition to strength of 
character, connection and optimism (which, as above, have been defined as attitudes), the skill 
sets are divided into self-awareness, self-regulation, and mental agility. These align well with the 
resources identified in Study 1 as being important for Psychological Safety. However, the Penn 
Resilience Program requires 18 hours of training and is designed for school level students. 
The target audience for this workshop was full time 
employees therefore the design of the workshop 
needed to be work relevant, engaging and take no 
more than half a day. Therefore it was not possible to 
provide training on all the topics identified in the 
focus groups.   
The previous study showed Psychological Safety and 
Resilience to be a result of evaluative processes and 
that the more psychological resources a participant 
had, the more positive their evaluations. Therefore 
the workshop was designed to enable participants to 
develop and maximise their psychological resources. 
The resources identified in the focus group were considered, in particular those sitting in the 
overlaps between the outputs categories of the focus 
groups (see figure 6.1). The obvious area to focus on was 
the central intersection. However, upon reviewing these, 
it became apparent that the content of the centre of the 
model were consequences of intrinsic psychological 
resources (see figure 6.2). 
Therefore, the resources in the remaining intersections 
were reviewed. Each of these were assessed against 
research available on the benefit of each resource and 
what could be meaningfully trained in half a day. In doing 
so, the processed identified the resources that would 
impact as many elements in the model as possible. For example, the ability to reframe limiting

groups and the relationships between them.

centre of the focus group output Venn

beliefs may be a useful technique to positively impact perspective and self-confidence. The 
topics in the overlap between Cognitive Agility and Emotional Regulation (i.e. Growth Mind-set, 
Locus of Control, Mindfulness and Training Brain) were considered to be trainable in half a day and 
based on research, had the potential to develop the resources in the three remaining areas of the 
model. This analysis is summarised below in table 6.1.

Table 6.1 Summary Of Analysis Of Resources Identified By Focus Groups, Identifying Research And Potential  Impact 
6.2.1.1 Growth Mind-set 
Mind-sets provide frameworks through which individuals evaluate and make judgements 
of their own experiences and those of others (Dennis, 2016; Dweck & Leggett, 1988). 
People who have a predominantly growth mind-set judge themselves and others less 
negatively (Chiu, Hong & Dweck, 1997; Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Vandewalle, 2012) and are 
more open to altering perceptions of others in the light of new information (Chiu, Hong & 
Dweck, 1997; Vandewalle, 2012). The majority of growth mind set research has been with 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  201 
children or students (Han et al., 2018), however research by Heslin and Vandewalle (2008) 
replicated this finding in the workplace. Managers who had a predominately fixed mind set 
were less likely to change their initial appraisal of staff performance over time.   
Being open to revaluating ones judgement about the self and others enables the 
management of your own judgements. Those with a growth mind-set have been found to 
hold positive self-cognitions, positive affect (Dweck & Leggett, 1988) and a flexible sense of 
self (Kashdan & Rottenberg, 2010). Dweck and Leggett (1988) found that children with a 
growth mind-set saw difficulties and setbacks as challenges rather than judging them to be 
reflections of their own capability. By not using external challenges or failures as a means 
of self-validation, children were more resilient and persevered more in tasks. In turn, this 
was related to higher self-efficacy, optimism and the seeking of alternative pathways to 
goals (Hope) (Dennis, 2016; Dweck & Leggett, 1988) and resilience (Moser et al., 2011).   
Such perseverance in exploring new and alternative solutions has also been shown to lead 
to motivation to learn (Dweck, 2016; Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Ng, 2018), problem solving 
(Dweck & Leggett, 1988), risk taking (Dennis, 2016) and innovation (Dweck, 2016; 
Stoycheva & Ruskov, 2015). These meet the focus group outputs categorised as 
capabilities/cognitive agility. 
6.2.1.2 Locus of Control 
Locus of control (LOC) refers to the extent to which people interpret events as being either 
a result of their own actions or external factors (Rotter, 1966). In their work with 
employees of an institution for disabled people, Dijkstra, Beersma and Evers (2011) found 
that an internal locus of control moderated the impact of conflict on psychological strain 
suggesting that those with high internal locus of control suffer less psychological strain as a 
result of workplace conflicts and have a high problem solving conflict management 
strategy. In her longitudinal study of nursing students Parkes (1984) found that those with 
higher internal locus of control had higher levels of coping as a result of more positive 
cognitive appraisals of the situation. Similarly Johnson, Batey and Holdsworth (2009) found 
a moderately positive correlation between work locus of control and health/wellbeing. 
Aspinwall and Taylor (1992) also demonstrated a positive correlation between Locus of 
Control and optimism and in addition Roy and Gupta (2012) found that those with an 
internal Locus of Control were self-determined, believing that hard work would result in 
positive outcomes (optimism). In turn, they found this lead to creativity.  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  202 
The research supporting a relationship between Locus of Control and creativity is mixed.  
Several studies have shown found that teams with members who were measured as having 
external locus of control were more creative than teams with members who had internal 
locus of control or mixed teams (Bolen & Torrence, 1978; Pannells & Claxton, 2008; 
Richmond & De La Serna, 1980).   
Evidence of a link between creativity and locus of control is sparse. If there is a causal link it 
would predict that development of Locus of Control may increase lateral thinking and 
problem solving (a resource shown at the intersection of Capabilities and Cognitive Ability 
in the focus group output diagram). If not, the value of locus of control might be more 
important for improved wellbeing, self-awareness through improved cognitive appraisals 
(Parkes, 1984) and problem solving to cope with conflict (a resource shown at the 
intersection Emotional Regulation  Sense of Self outputs). 
6.2.1.3 Mindfulness 
Mindfulness, although a relatively new area of study, has recently been associated with 
cognitive flexibility, enabling individuals to be able to response positively to changing 
environments and improved psychological wellbeing. 
Many studies of mindfulness have been used in a clinical context, exploring the impact of 
Mindfulness on depression (Teasdale et al., 2000),  eating disorders  (Kristeller & Hallett, 
1999),  wellbeing (Brown et al., 2007) and  chronic pain (Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth & Burney 
1984). Non clinical studies are scarce, although the benefits of mindfulness are beginning 
to seep into the organisational context. Studies of the use of mindfulness in organisations 
have been primarily in the context of health and well-being (Carter, Tobias & Spiegelhalter, 
2016). However more recent studies have positively associated mindfulness with 
leadership (Reb et al., 2018; Verdorfer, 2016), prosocial behaviour (Donald et al., 2019; 
Kreplin, Farias & Brazil, 2018) and improved individual performance (Dane & Brummel, 
2014; Zhang & Wu, 2014) and team performance (LePine et al., 2008). However findings 
are inconsistent. There are studies that failed to demonstrate an effect of mindfulness on 
workplace performance (Hafenbrack & Vohs, 2018) and implicit learning (Stillman et al., 
2014), both of which are considered key process for attitude formation (Lewicki, Czyzewska 
& Hoffman,1987; Lewicki, Hill, & Czyzewska, 1992) and social interaction (Lieberman, 
2000).  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  203 
Moore and Malinowski (2009) in their small study of Buddhist meditators, used 
professionals from a credit management company as the control group. A high positive 
correlation of was found between a mindfulness measure (KIMS- Kentucky Inventory of 
Mindfulness Baer et al., 2004) and concentration performance as measured by the d2-
concentration and endurance test (d2-test, Brickenkamp, 1962). They demonstrated that 
mindfulness correlated positively with attentional performance and cognitive flexibility. 
Chambers, Chuen Yee Lo, & Allen (2008), in another small study demonstrated that 
Mindfulness levels (as measured by the MAAS  Mindfulness, Attentional Awareness Scale, 
Brown & Ryan, 2003) increased for the group who attended a 10 day mindfulness training 
course. Although there were limited changes in self-reported measures of depression and 
only small changes in the PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Scale) for either group 
before and after mindfulness training, participants in the mindfulness group did 
demonstrate improved performance on the DSB and the Internal Switching Test (IST-Lo & 
Allen, in Chambers et al., 2008) which Chambers et al., (2008) suggest indicates an 
improvement in working memory capacity and attentional focus. No significant 
improvement in attentional switching was demonstrated.  
Attentional focus could be related to Langers definition of mindfulness in that the state of 
mindfulness can be considered as not being mindless (1989, p.1). It enables individuals to 
be attentive to their environment and thus increasing the ability to choose how to respond 
(Weick & Sutcliffe, 2006). It enables resilience and flexibility (Levinthal & Rerup, 2006), 
openness to novelty (Langer, 1997; Sternberg, 2000), increases flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 
1990) and cognitive resources and improves decision making (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2006), 
problem solving (Baer, 2003; Pirson et al., 2012), increases self-awareness (Brown et al., 
2007; Sutcliffe, Vogus & Dane, 2016: Tangney, Baumeister & Boone, 2004) and self-
regulation (Brown et al., 2007; Moore & Malinowski, 2009). 
The increased awareness of the self and ones needs and values that mindfulness brings can 
lead to an increased ability to self-regulate and make conscious behavioural choices rather 
than relying on automatic habitual responses (Bishop et al., 2004; Langer, 1989; Plant & 
Ryan, 1985; Ryan & Brown, 2003). Awareness of and alignment to ones goals and values 
have been shown to aid cognitive balance and thereby improve well-being (Wallace & 
Shapiro, 2006). 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  204 
6.2.1.4 Training Brain  
The context of training brain in the focus group was related to being able to manage 
thoughts and reactions. Growth mind set, Locus of Control and Mindfulness will contribute 
to this, however a section on the physiology of the brain, limbic system and work on 
controlling automatic thoughts was also included in the workshop. 
6.2.2 Workshop Delivery 
The workshop was designed to be delivered using a variety of methods: videos, group work, 
discussion and practical activities. For each topic, participants performed an exercise which was 
then debriefed and participants were provided with an opportunity to reflect on its application 
outside of the classroom. 
6.2.2.1 Growth Mindset 
Within the workshop, growth mindset was taught by providing each participant with a 
growth mindset questionnaire to complete (see table 6.2).  
1 Your intelligence is something very basic about you that cant change much. 
2 No matter how much intelligence you have, you can always change it quite a bit. 
3 You can always substantially change how intelligent you are. 
4 You are a certain kind of person, and there is not much you can do to really change that 
5 You can always change basic things about the kind of person you are 
6 Music talent can be learned by anyone 
7 Only a few people will be truly good at sports  you have to be born with it. 
Maths is much easier to learn if you are male or maybe come from a culture who values 
maths. 
9 The harder you work at something, the better you will be at it. 
10 No matter what kind of person you are, you can always change substantially.  
11 Trying new things is stressful for me, I usually avoid it. 
12 Some people are good and kind, and some are not. Its not often people change. 
13 I appreciate being given feedback about my performance 
14 I often get angry when I get feedback about my performance. 
All human beings without a brain injury or birth defect are capable of the same amount of 
learning. 
16 You can learn new things but you cant really change how intelligent you are. 
You can do things differently, but the important parts of who you are cant really be 
changed 
18 Human beings are basically good, but sometimes they make terrible decisions. 
19 An important reason why I do my work is that I like to learn new things.

Participants were not asked to reveal their scores. The results were less important than the 
discussion which began with a question as to what the participants thought of the exercise 
and whether there were any surprises. Discussions took place around some of the 
statements. For example, question number 6 Music talent can be learned by anyone 
often prompted discussion. For example, one participant argued that they were not 
musical having tried the recorder at school and was no good. The facilitator challenged 
the participant as to what would need to be different for them to learn the recorder, what 
the difference was between them and someone who had learnt to play the recorder and 
finally how would it feel if they adopted a growth mindset about music talent. 
Discussion led to a slide on the difference between fixed and growth mindset.

Participants were then asked to consider an event or experience about which they had a 
fixed mindset. Working in pairs, they discussed how it would feel to adopt a growth 
mindset. What impact would this have on their self-belief, emotions and feeling of self-
efficacy? 
Finally, participants returned to the main group and the facilitator asked if anyone would 
share their learnings. This exercise proved to be quite emotional for some participants as 
they realised that a fixed mindset had held them back, writing in their reflection 
assignment that: I can recognise instances where I have fallen into a fixed mind-set, which 
has perhaps impaired my ability to continue to grow 
6.2.2.2 Locus of Control 
Developing locus of control required providing tools and mechanisms to enable 
participants to be able to focus their attention on that which is important and that they can 
impact.  
Figure 6.3 Powerpoint slide introducing comparing fixed and growth mindsets 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  207 
Participants were asked what their purpose was. Many responded by providing their job 
title or role at work. The facilator asked, what would happen if you lost your job? When 
participants responded lose my purpose the facilitor asked how does that feel? How 
does that make you feel about your role? A discussion took place as to the anxiety this 
causes. Students were introduced to the concept of Ikigai, meaning life worth living (Sone 
et al, 2008). The purpose was to detatch individual purpose from goals and to enable 
individuals to focus on that which is their Ikigai (see figure 6.4). 
A discussion was had as to how their current job roles contributed to their purpose rather 
than their job roles being their purpose. 
In order to help partipants recognise the difference between values and goals, they were 
then provided with a sheet of paper (see figure 6.5) and asked to write their life goals in 
the centre, using the popular acronym SMART (Specific, Measureable, Attaintable, 
Realistic and Time-Bound).  
Figure 6.4 Workshop slide showing an illustration of the concept of Ikigai

Many of these were career focused 
and achieving wealth and happiness. 
The facilitator then asked the 
question, if your goal is wealth, why 
are you engaging in more financially 
lucrative activities such as selling 
drugs, employing child labour or 
improving your career prospects by 
killing your boss? If you are looking 
for happiness, then why not give up 
work and pursue your favourite 
hobby? 
The purpose of the question was to enable discussion about the how goals are achieved 
and the values and morals we apply to ourselves. 
Each participant was provided with a list of 28 values, with two blank boxes (see figure 
6.6). Participants were asked to select 14. They were invited to rewrite definitions or even 
to write their own if they wished. Having identified 14, they were then asked to select the 
top 7. Finally, working with partners, each participant was asked to compare their values 
with others, and their learnings from the process. 
Accomplishment 
To achieve my personal objectives 
with a sense that I have done 
something as well as, if not better 
than someone else would have: to 
experience self satisfaction when I rise 
to a challenge, accomplish a task or a 
job or solve a problem. 
Growth 
To advance, to expand my life 
through the improvement of my 
status at work or in the community, 
to increase my work and non-work 
related knowledge/skill to find 
fulfilment in the groups in which I

Figure 6.6 List of values provided to workshop participants. 
A discussion took place with the premise: if we assumed we only have finate cognitive 
resources, how do we choose where to invest them. 
A slide was provided to demonstrate how values and purpose provide a a compass to 
life, providing a sense of what feels write or wrong and thereby modifying how we 
achieve our goals in life and helping us make decisions.

Finally, participants were asked to add their chosen 7 values to the wheel and re-write 
their SMART goals accordingly. In doing so this provided the areas to which we need to 
focus our attention: that 
which is important and we 
can do something about. 
To illustrate this point, the 
facilitator drew two 
concentric circles on a flip 
chart. Participants were asked 
to shout our all of the things 
that may stop them getting to 
work on time. The facilitator 
wrote each suggestion on the 
flip chart, placing each one in 
one of the circles or on the 
outside of the circles.  When the suggestions were complete, the facilitor asked what do 
you notice about how I have grouped your suggestions? Then the circles were labelled as 
that which you can control, that which you can influence and out of your control as 
shown in figure 6.9.

The facilitator allowed the 
inevitable discussion as to 
whether traffic was something 
you can influence, the 
conclusion was we are able to 
anticipate some things and 
therefore increase our influence. 
A light hearted 2-minute video 
by Gaur Gopal Prabhu was 
shown to illustrate this and 
where we focus our attention.

After a coffee break, the question was asked for the things we cannot control or influence, 
what can we do? The answer was choose our response.

A brief introduction to the concept of stimulus-response and how neurons are formed that 
create automatic responses. The concept of the Triune Brain (MacLean, 1988) was 
introduced using David Rocks SCARF model (Rock, 2008) to explain the role of the limbic 
system and its impact on attitude evaluation. A video on Automatic Thoughts was shown 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2zRA5zCA6M). It was explained that the video was 
designed for college students, but that participants would be provided with an opportunity 
to apply the concepts to their own experiences. The video explains types of automatic 
thoughts such as assuming the fairy tale, over-generalising and catastrophing, 
suggests a method of reflecting using three Rs (see figure 6.11). The participants were 
then asked to spend 10 
minutes reflecting on a 
past experience that had 
resulted in an automatic 
thought. Then the 
participants paired up 
and shared how they 
applied the three Rs and 
how they now felt about 
the event. 
This led into the section on mindfulness. 
6.2.2.4 Mindfulness 
Mindfulness was positioned as the need to be aware of when a fixed mindset, automatic 
thoughts or the focus of attention was unhelpful.  Using an example, Kolbs (2007) learning 
cycle was drawn on the board to illustrate the importance of reflection in learning and 
changing negative thoughts.  Two further models for reflection were introduced, The Five 
Whys (Pojasek, 2000) and the Gibbs Reflective Cycle (Gibbs, 1988). Working in pairs, 
participants were then asked to apply these models to past automatic thoughts or events 
in which they had had an emotional response.  
When returning to the plenary session, the facilitator asked: What went well, what was 
challenging and what did you learn in order to promote discussion. In response to the 
inevitable challenge that its difficult to manage your thoughts and emotions, the closing 
section was introduced.

The healthy brain platter by Rock (2011) was used to illustrate ways to maximise physical, 
emotional and cognitive resources. Each element was discussed in turn and ideas 
generated by the group as to how these could be achieved.  
A lesson plan was created to determine the running order and ensure consistency of delivery 
(see table 6.4).

6.3 Quantitative Analysis  
6.3.1 Test for Power 
An a priori power anlaysis was performed using G*Power v 3.1 (Faul et al, 2007) to test the required 
sample size to perform an ANOVA repeated measures (within and between) for 8 predictors 
(Psychological Safety, Resilience, HOSE, LMS, ACS, Cognitive Resources, Emotional Resources). A 
medium effect size (f=.25), an alpha of .05 and  error of 0.80 was used.  Results showed that for 
two groups, a sample size of 16 participants were required. A post hoc power analysis indicated that 
having 27 participants gave a power (1-  error probability) of 0.0945. This suggests the sample was 
of sufficient size for statistical significance. 
6.3.2 ANOVA Analysis 
A repeated measures ANOVA was performed on LMS, ACS, Psychological Safety, Resilience, HOSE 
and Psychological Capital variables to explore the impact of time. Since the previous study had 
indicated a role for the two key availability resources of Emotional Resources and Cognitive 
Resources in predicting Psychological Safety and Resilience, these variables were also included in the 
analysis.

The Wilks Lambda test of within-subject effects indicated that there was no overall statistical change 
in performance before and after the training (F=1.695, df=7, p=.167). Descriptive statistics indicated 
that the means of each measure between t1 and t2 did demonstrate a small increase for each 
variable (see table 6.5). However, Pairwise comparison indicated that only the increase in LMS was 
statistically significant (see table 6.6).   
Tests of within-subjects contrasts indicated that only LMS had a statistically significant linear 
relationship with time: LMS F(1, 27)= 4.532, p=.043.  
A further repeated measures ANOVA on the individual components of HOSE once again indicated 
small increases of less than 1% in the mean between t1 and t2 (see table 6.7).

6.4 Qualitative Analysis 
All attendees of the BA in Applied Management were required to write an end of year reflective 
assignment on the topics covered throughout the year (see figure 6.12). There was no explicit 
requirement to reflect on this specific 
intervention. However, of the 64 delegates, 
36 reflected on an aspect of this workshop 
(56%).  
Comments were read and comments for each 
topic were recorded; i.e. Locus of Control, 
Attentional Control & Automatic Thoughts, 
Limbic System & SCARF, Values & Ikigai, 
growth mind-set, reflection, the healthy mind 
platter and openness. A summary of the 
comments are shown in table 6.9. The full 
comments are shown in Appendix Y.   
Write a structured reflection on the learning 
achieved throughout the year. Use a selection of 
personal journal entries as a starting point to 
discuss the concepts and theories which you 
studied in this module which have particular 
relevance to your role and organisation. Quote 
and develop your original journal entries using 
the principles of reflexive writing. Engage in a 
critical evaluation of the concepts raised 
supporting your discussion by the relevant 
literature

Healthy Mind 
Platter 
Openness 
I need to follow 
Prabhus (2016) 
philosophy in that if 
I can do something 
about it, then I 
should not worry 
about it as I can 
change it. 
More importantly 
though, not worrying 
about things I cannot 
influence or change. I 
also need to stop 
creating automatic 
negative thoughts and 
instead need to grow a 
positive mind-set. 
Triggers being 
stimulated and so 
they activate the 
limbic part of my 
brain. If the limbic 
part of the brain 
continues to be 
stimulated, then 
this will cause the 
neocortex part of 
the brain to shut 
down, which is the 
part of the brain 
used for reasoning. 
I have learnt so 
much about myself.  
Understanding the 
way I think, the way 
I feel, why I feel that 
way, what I want 
and why I want it 
has been somewhat 
of an epiphany to 
Growth vs Fixed 
Mind-set 
I will look to adopt 
the 3Rs approach 
Round the Healthy 
Mind Platter and 
how the seven 
boxes need aligned 
to ensure optimal 
wellbeing. Indeed 
Gray (2015) has 
even suggested that 
the Healthy Mind 
Platter may be 
beneficial rolled out 
across whole 
organisations. As 
discussed earlier, 
my work/life 
balance is suffering, 
as also touched on 
within my journal: 
I need to make 
sure that I continue 
to focus on sharing 
my thoughts and 
feelings with the 
team in order to 
encourage an 
environment of 
trust and sharing 
(Personal Journey, 
December 
There are many 
things out of our 
control and what is 
the point of 
upsetting myself 
when there is 
nothing I can do 
about it 
Currently I 
catastrophize too much 
so need to rationalize 
these thoughts. 
Limbic system - This 
has been highly 
prominent in recent 
weeks given the 
return of my line

maternity leave. I 
have faced into 
certain situations 
where I felt 
threatened by her 
presence

me realise that I 
have to find that 
balance in life again, 
where every comes 
together in 
harmony, 
I definitely have 
been very much in 
the Fixed Mind-set 
since I returned to 
the UK in 2014, 
whereas before I 
lived my life 
according to the 
Growth Mind-set. I 
written this down as 
one of my 
development 
opportunities, I 
want to change it. 
I reflected and I 
understood that I 
have started to shift 
my thought process, 
which is positive. It 
was because of 
realization of areas 
that I need to change 
and work on, 
because I kept 
reflecting. 
Looking at the 
Healthy Mind 
Platter (Rock & 
Siegel 2011) I 
struggled to find 
one area on the 
platter that I 
actually allowed 
myself to spend any 
time on.  I have 
come to the 
conclusion 
throughout the last 
6 months that I am 
a workaholic and 
that I need to 
seriously take some 
time out for myself 
and my family.   
This has made me 
make sure that I 
keep an open mind 
and dont make any 
assumptions

theory was the that

The process involves 
considering what 
you love, what the 
world needs, what 
you can be paid for

Reflection had 16 mentions, Values & Ikigai had 15 mentions each, Attentional control-automatic 
thoughts and growth mind set both had 9 mentions each.  
However, this does not reflect the quantity of discussion for each topic. Therefore, all the 4290 
words of the comments were analysed to determine what percentage of the total word count could 
be attributed to each topic. 
Analysis was carried out by dividing paragraphs into topic sections. An example is shown below: the 
first 11 words of the paragraph referred to self-awareness of emotions, therefore these 11 words 
were attributed to the AC-AT topic. The following 29 to the Limbic System (LS) and the final 20 to a 
reflection technique that was taught in the workshop (RRR). 
Self-awareness of my emotions has been paramount in learning achieved. An understanding 
of our brain has various areas, particularly the limbic system with specifically the amygdala 
[sic] holds all the emotional memory and hold out flight or fight mode.  Using the RRR 
concept has changed how I now deal with these overcoming thoughts I face and help me

The result confirmed the analysis of number of mentions in that Ikigai/Values and Reflection were 
the most mentioned and had the most written about them with 33% and 25% respectively. Both 
Growth Mind-set and Attentional control-Automatic thoughts had 9 mentions but 13% of the word 
count was discussing Growth Mind-set, only 6% Attentional control- Automatic thoughts (see table 
6.10). 
Of the 4134 words, 537 (13%) were not allocated to any category as they were discussing non-
relevant topics.

6.5 Summary of Results  
The quantitative analysis suggests the workshop had no significant impact on the measures of 
Psychological Safety or Resilience between t1 and t2. The increases in Hope, Optimism and Self-
efficacy were less than 1%. Only LMS showed a statistically significant increase of 3%.  
In contrast the qualitative comments suggested that the workshop added great value to participants 
and in some cases, there were some profound learnings and realisations. For example, one 
participant wrote: 
 looking at the Healthy Mind Platter (Rock & Siegel 2011) I struggled to find one area on the 
platter that I actually allowed myself to spend any time on.  I have come to the conclusion 
throughout the last 6 months that I am a workaholic and that I need to seriously take some 
time out for myself and my family.   
Another described the workshop as: 
I have learnt so much about myself.  Understanding the way I think, the way I feel, why I feel 
that way, what I want and why I want it has been somewhat of an epiphany to me.   
6.6 Limitations 
The mimimal increase in measure scores may be a result of a number of different limitations which 
are discussed below. 
It is possible that the workshop increased awareness of the trained skills but that 4 weeks 
between testing may not have been sufficient for application. Changing ones automatic 
thoughts requires time and habitual change to rewire often hard-wired habits in order to 
develop new ways of thinking. Recognised as enabling resilience, the necessary brain 
plasticity can be enhanced through exercise, mindfulness and gaining meaning and purpose 
in life (McEwen, 2016). Although qualitatively, the workshop appeared to have an impact 
on purpose and meaning, exercise and mindfulness require changing physical and cognitive 
habits.  
The Nature of Attitudes 
This research has suggested that Psychological Safety and Resilince are predicted by 
attitudes. As will be discussed in chapter 7, the formation of attitudes is a complex process 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  227 
argued to be a result of stored memories (Bohner et al , 2008; Fazio, 2007; Petty et al, 
2007), motivations (Fazio, 2007), accessible information (Gawronski, 2007; Schwarz, 2007), 
frequency of use (Higgins, 1996) and other evaluative processes (Petty et al 2007). Thus, to 
be able to create significant shifts in attitudes such as Hope, Optimism and Self-efficacy 
within 4 hours is unlikely. The aim of the workshop was to provide tools to enable an 
increase in the psychological resources that predict these attitudes. 
Environment 
Returning to a work environment after the workshop, puts the delegates to the same 
contextual environment in which habits were formed. To change habits and enable new 
practises, as suggested in the transtheoretical model of behaviour change (Prochaska, 
DiClemente, & Norcross, 1997) no matter how strong the intention to change, the stimulus 
provoking the original behaviour needs to change: for example the environment 
(Prochaska, Redding & Evers, 2015; Wood, Tam & Witt, 2005). 
Furthermore, research suggests that in order to transfer learning into the workplace, in 
addition to motivation, an employee requires the opportunity to perform and apply the 
knowledge (Addy & Blanchard, 2010; Stes, Coertjens & Van Petegem, 2010),  supervisors 
support (Dixon & Scott, 2003; OHara & Pritchard, 2008; Stepp-Greany, 2004) and peer 
support (Chitpin, 2011; Fedock, Zambo & Cobern, 1996; Gallos, van den Berg & Treagust, 
2005; OHara & Pritchard, 2008). However, research by Holton III, Chem and Naquin (2003) 
demonstrated that mechanisms for learning transfer depended on the type of organisation. 
For those in private sector organisations, linking the opportunity to apply new learning and 
the application of learning to performance outcomes led to learning transfer. However, for 
non-profit organisations it was supervisor support that was the most important element in 
creating change.  
Workshop content 
Although the attitudes of HOSE appear to have improved, it may be that the content of the 
workshop was not practical enough for application into the workplace. Transferring 
learning from the classroom into the workplace is not a new challenge (Baldwin & Ford, 
1988; Griffin, 2011).  In their review into the required variables for transfer of learning in 
educational environments, every one of the 30 studies researched identified practise and 
feedback as a required variable for transfer of learning (De Rijdt et al., 2013). Kauffeld & 
Lehmann-Willenbrock (2010) suggest that learning be spaced out with breaks in between in 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  228 
order to maximise learning. Recent studies demonstrating the importance of the role of 
sleep in learning, (Fattinger et al., 2017; Nusbaum et al., 2018) suggest that the break 
should be sufficient to allow an opportunity to sleep (Nusbaum et al., 2018). The 
intervention workshop was half day, therefore focused on the participant as an individual 
rather than an employee or manager with no opportunity for practise.  
Measures 
The aim of the workshop was to develop Psychological Capital, Psychological Safety and 
Resilience indirectly by helping change mind-sets and attitude through topics such as 
growth mind-set, purpose and understanding the limbic system. As such the measures 
used, although consistent throughout the study, did not directly measure the content of 
the workshop. Had levels of growth mind-set, locus of control or self-control been 
measured before and after the workshop, the statistical change between time 1 and 2 may 
have been greater. 
Participants 
For the longitudinal study, all the employee participants were all professionals in 
managerial positions. They were attending a part time degree program to improve and 
ratify their leadership skills. Their attendance on this three year program was being paid for 
by their companies. The participants may therefore already be optimistic with hope, given 
the investment in them by their employers. Given organisations are most likely to make 
such a financial investment in good performers, those taking the study may also be the 
most self-efficacious.  
6.7 Discussion 
The purpose of the longitudinal study was to test the hypothesis that the psychological resources 
identified in studies 1 and 2 could be developed. This hypothesis has been partially supported as 
although increases were shown in every measure, these were statistically non-signficant, with the 
exception of LMS. However, the quantitative results do not seem to reflect the qualitative data. 
There may be several reasons for this.  
The nature of the workshop content focused on the tools to enable attitude shift: indeed the most 
discussed topics were around understanding your purpose and context (offering a sense of hope and 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  229 
optimism) and growth mind-set to reframe success or failure into a continuous learning mind-set 
(Hope, Optimism and Self-Efficacy).  
Reflection was a key element of the overall program and therefore there was an awareness of 
reflection and its benefits for learning about the self and capabilities (self-efficacy). Furthermore, the 
assignment was a reflection piece, forcing the application of the process. 
 Overall the findings from this study have potential implications for organisations, employees and 
even the education sector. The following chapter discusses these along with the potential further 
research.

7. General Discussion 
This study aimed to explore Luthans & Churchs (2002) Psychological Capital model and its 
relationship with Psychological Safety and Resilience, hypothesising that the addition of Cognitive 
Flexibility would strengthen any relationship.  In doing so, the research aimed to add to extant 
research by determining whether individual-level intrinsic cognitive resources can enable 
Psychological Safety and Resilience in todays organisation.  
7.1 Summary of Findings 
There were a total of seven hypotheses tested, the findings for each are summarised below.  
Hypothesis 1: Individual employees have a role to play in creating their own Psychological Safety.  
During focus groups, when asked what what it that created Psychological Safety in the 
workplace, all groups began by describing extrinsic mechanisms such as trust, leaders 
and organisational vision. When asked whether Psychological Safety was therefore the 
responsibility of the organisation only, the answer was unanimously no, all groups 
recognising that the employee themselves had a role to play. Intrinsic mechanisms 
that were subsequently identified fell into four categories: Capabilities, Cognitive 
Agility, Emotional Regulation and Sense of Self. Therefore, this hypothesis was 
supported. 
Hypothesis 2: Employees with higher levels of intrinsic psychological resources, as measured by 
Kahns Availability dimension and Luthans the Psychological Capital model, will have higher levels 
of Psychological Safety. 
All resources showed a positive linear relationship with Psychological Safety with the 
exception of Self-Conciousness which as expected had a negative linear relationship. 
This suggest that where psychological resources are higher, so to is the level of 
Psychological Safety. Therefore, this hypothesis was supported. 
Hypothesis 3: Resilience is redundant in the Psychological Capital model as Resilience is an output 
of Hope, Optimism and Self-efficacy. 
When comparing correlations between variables and Psychological Capital (resilience 
included) with correlations between variables and HOSE (resilience excluded) there 
was very little difference, and in one case no difference. This suggested that resilience 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  231 
contributed little to the construct of Psychological Capital. Confirmatory Factor 
Analysis confirmed that a three-factor model of hope, optimism and self-efficacy had a 
stronger fit than when resilience was included. As a result, Resilience became another 
dependant variable alongside Psychological Safety. Therefore, this hypothesis was 
supported. 
Hypothesis 4: Employees with higher levels of intrinsic psychological resources, as measured by 
Kahns Availability dimension and Luthans Psychological Capital model will have 
higher levels of Resilience 
As with Psychological Safety, all resource variables showed a positive linear 
relationship with Resilience with the exception of Self-Conciousness which as expected 
had a negative linear relationship. This suggest that where psychological resources are 
higher, so to is the level of Resilience. Therefore, this hypothesis was supported. 
Hypothesis 5: Cognitive Flexibility, a new component of Psychological Capital will replace 
resilience, creating a new model of Hope + Optimism + Self-Efficacy +Cognitive 
Flexibility. 
The variables of LMS and ACS were added to the HOSE model and a confirmatory 
factor analysis indicated that indeed, the model was stronger with the addition of 
these two cognitive flexibility measures. This created a new variable HOSE-LA. 
Therefore, this hypothesis was supported. 
Hypothesis 6:  Given that both Resilience and Psychological Safety are hypothesised to be outputs 
of personal resources there will be a positive relationship between Psychological 
Safety and Resilience 
Surprisingly there was a weak relationship between Psychological Safety and Reslience. 
This was considered to be due to the different variables that predicted each 
dependant variable. Therefore, this hypothesis was only partially supported. 
Hypothesise 7: Interventions to develop personal resources will increase levels of Psychological 
Safety and Resilience. 
Four to six weeks after four-hour workshop to develop skills to help participants 
maximise their cognitive and emotional resources, only the variable of LMS had 
increased by only 3%.  Therefore, this hypothesis was only partially supported.

Figure 7.1 summarises the findings, demonstrating that for employees, the relationship between 
cognitive and emotional psychological resources and Psychological Safety or Resilience is filtered 
through the components of HOSE and Attentional Control.  This chapter will firstly discuss the 
implications of these predictors for Psychological Safety and Resilience, and then will discuss the 
implications for Organisations and Leaders as well as Employees. Although students were not the 
target populations for this study and the sample was small with limited power, some potential 
implications for Education is discussed. Finally, the limitations of this study are explored and 
suggestions made for potential future areas of research. 
7.1 Psychological Safety, Hope and Optimism  
This research suggests that having a goal and being able to see the pathways to achievements of the 
goal contribute to feeling psychologically safe. Hope, a construct consisting of the will and way to 
goal achievement, accounted for 30% of the variance in Psychological Safety. This supports the work 
of Faraj and Yan (2009) who showed the importance of goals in creating Psychological Safety in their 
work with teams. Common team goals create Psychological Safety (Carmeli & Gittell, 2009) by 
establishing boundaries for expectations and responsibility thus decreasing the uncertainty of 
outcomes and accountability (Faraj & Yan, 2009).This can therefore impact trust (Simpson, 2007) 
which in turn has a moderating effect on Psychological Safety. Similarly, experiencing goal conflict 
Figure 7.1 Diagram Illustrating the Predictors of Psychological Safety and Resilience for 
Employees. 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  233 
(achievement of one goal undermines or compromises the achievement of another) and goal 
discrepancy, (when achievement of a goal runs counter to ones sense of self or personal needs) have 
been shown to lead to poor emotional wellbeing (Carver, Lawrence & Scheier, 1999; Kelly, Mansell & 
Wood, 2015; Strauman & Higgins, 1988). This research may go some way to explain this. A goal that 
compromises ones own needs may be evaluated as having a negative outcome on self (irrespective 
of the success of the work outcome) and therefore diminish the will (agency) to achieve the goal.  
Recent work in organisations has supported these findings, demonstrating a relationship between 
goals and employee burnout (Sijbom et al., 2019) and between goal conflict and occupational 
wellbeing (Hyvnen, Rantanen & Huhtala, 2015).   
Optimism was also a predictor of Psychological Safety. 
Snyder et al., (2001) agree that there are many shared aspects of hope and optimism. Correlations in 
this study suggested this was the case and Optimism accounted for 36% of the variance in Hope.  
After all, being optimistic that the pathways to a goal will lead to a positive outcome is likely to 
increase the will to follow these paths.  
This reflects extant research.  Desrumaux et al. (2015) in their research with school teachers, 
identified a positive correlation between job climate and optimism. Additionally, Kluemper et al., 
(2009) found that state optimism in the workplace was negatively correlated with burnout and 
distress symptoms. Avey et al. (2008) described Psychological Capital as a significant negative 
predictor of cynicism although this was measured as a single construct and the specific contribution 
of optimism is unclear. In combination, this research suggests that for Psychological Safety, 
employees require clarity on goals, how to achieve them and that the goals will result in a positive 
outcome. 
There is evidence to suggest that Hope and Optimism are complementary resources. Optimists have 
been shown to demonstrate plan-full behaviour (Scheier, Weintraub & Carver, 1986). However, 
optimism has also been shown to reduce the evaluation of risk (Sheppard et al., 2015) which can lead 
to a Pollyanna view of the world: an un-realistically favourable evaluation of future outcomes 
(McKenna, 1993; Shepperd et al., 2015; Tenney, Logg & Moore, 2015). Hope may mitigate this by 
providing realistic goals and pathways to achieve successful outcomes. In support of this, Hope has 
been shown to be positively correlated with positive thinking and affect (Scheier, Weintraub & 
Carver, 1986). For instance, in one study, those scoring high on a Hope scale had a tendency to focus 
on more positive affirming statements (Snyder et al., 1996, 1997). 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  234 
The results of the studies reported in this thesis suggest that emotional resources predict Optimism 
for employees. Since optimism was also related to Hope, it is possible that the causal effect of 
optimism Psychological Safety is moderated by the cognitive resources and self-efficacy that 
predicted Hope. 
This study suggests that for Psychological Safety, an employees needs to have goal which they 
perceive as achievable and will result in a positive outcome.  Both Hope and Optimism are evaluative 
processes: they evaluate the extent to which a goal is achievable with a successful outcome.  This 
suggests that Psychological Safety might be a product of an employees evaluative processes; their 
perception of an outcome of a conversation with a peer, a meeting with a manager or an 
organisational initiative. Employees assign both positive and negative meaning to events and 
interactions (James & Sells, 1981): For instance, a negative behaviour by a colleague could either be 
the result of something you have done (negative attribution) or due to other external factors 
(positive attribution). It is possible to make similarly negative or positive attributions about events in 
a VUCA environment; the resulting constant change could, for instance, be the result of necessary 
adaptation to the environment (positive attribution) or leadership incompetence (negative 
attribution).  The chosen attribution will contribute to Psychological Safety in that positive 
attributions are more likely to increase this while negative attributions could undermine it. 
Thus for employees, Psychological Safety might be an evaluatory process that requires both cognitive 
and emotional resources.  Interestingly, neither hope nor optimism predicted Psychological Safety 
for students. For students levels of emotional resources determined how psychologically safe they 
felt. 
7.2 Resilience, Self-Efficacy, Hope and ACS 
This research suggests that resilience is a result of a belief that there is a means to achieve a goal 
(hope) that you have the capability to achieve it (self-efficacy) and you are able to focus your 
attention appropriately (ACS). 
This research therefore supported the hypothesis that resilience is an output of the psychological 
resources of HOSE, specifically self-efficacy and hope, with optimism contributing explanatory 
variance to Hope. This finding supports extant research that resilience is a combination of factors 
(Egeland et al., 1993; Glantz & Sloboda, 2002; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003) , the most strongly evidenced 
being self-efficacy (Gillespie, 2007b; Rutter, 2012; Sommer, 2016; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003, Vogus & 
Sutcliffe, 2007).  Sutcliffe and Vogus (2003) suggest that self-efficacy resides within resilience, and 
indeed self-efficacy and resilience were strongly positively correlated in this study. However, results 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  235 
of an EFA in this study negated the possibility that self-efficacy and resilience measures were 
assessing the same construct since these questions loaded onto separate factors. 
Since resilience was found to be an output of HOSE, it is of interest to determine which components 
of HOSE contribute to resilience. Hope, Self-Efficacy and ACS all were found to contribute to variance 
in resilience. This supports the findings of Gillespie et al. (2007b) and Snyder and McCullough (2000) 
that resilience stems from goal orientation (i.e. hope) and achievement (i.e. self-efficacy). Although 
self-efficacy has been attributed to resilience in coping with stress (Bandura, 1982; Werner 1993) 
hope has been shown to be positively correlated self-worth in college athletes (Curry, Snyder & Cook, 
1997).  Snyders Hope Theory argues that those who have demonstrated high hope see stressors as 
motivating challenges, whereas those with low hope lack the confidence that they are able to attain 
their goals (OSullivan, 2011; Snyder, 2002).  
In this study, attentional control as measured by the ACS questionnaire (Derryberry & Reed, 2002b) 
accounted for a significant variance in resilience. The ability to control ones focus of attention has 
been shown to be a differentiator between those who experience low anxiety and those who 
experience high anxiety (Derakshan & Eysenck, 2009; Derryberry & Reed, 2002b). When evaluating 
thoughts, people or objects, an individual might choose to focus on negative aspects or threat. The 
inability to disengage ones attention to reframe and focus on something more positive, can lead to 
anxiety, which in turn reduces our psychological resources (Eynsenck et al., 2007). Furthermore, the 
processes of attentional control, shifting, updating and inhibition have been shown to contribute to 
executive thinking tasks (Miyake et al., 2000) suggesting cognitive resources may be enabled through 
attentional control. However, this study found that the primary predictor of ACS was cognitive 
resources suggesting that cognitive resources enable attentional control.  
It is interesting that Optimism was not a direct predictor of resilience, although optimism did account 
for 36% if the variance of Hope. Perhaps it is the absence of Optimism that differentiates the 
resilient. Those who are resilient continue to try to succeed even when they do not hold positive 
expectations about the outcome. For example, during an organisational restructure an individual 
may not be optimistic about the outcome for themselves and their role, however with self-efficacy 
and the ability to create pathways to goals, they have the resilience to withstand what may prove a 
challenging time ahead. Indeed, the lack of optimism in a positive outcome may create the agency to 
seek alternatives and construct new possibilities.

7.3 The HOSE Model 
The results of this research support the theory that the constructs of Hope, Optimism and Self-
Efficacy are related (Carver & Sheier, 2002; Luthans et al., 2007; Magalleta & Oliver, 1999; Snyder et 
al.,  2001). This is in agreement with research that found that Hope supports Optimism and Self-
efficacy (Magaletta & Oliver, 1999). In the research presented in this thesis, for employees, Hope 
accounted for 34% of the variance in Self-efficacy and 8% of the variance in Optimism. The 
relationship was shown to be reciprocal: self-efficacy contributing 48% of the variance in Hope and 
Optimism 36% of the variance. As Luthans and Jensen (2002) explain, the agency component of Hope 
shares a commonality with optimism concerning expectations about outcomes. The pathways 
component of Hope also appears to share commonality with self-efficacy: being able to identify ways 
to achieve goals (see figure 7.2).  
This research supported the hypothesis that resilience should be excluded from the Psychological 
Capital model. One explanation for this is that while the resources that compose of HOSE are 
considered evaluative processes, resilience is considered a descriptive construct (Glantz et al., 2002).  
Resilience is a response to, or consequence of, an evaluation as to whether ones capability is able to 
meet demands (Rutter, 1987; Staudinger et al., 1993). Thus, resilience appears to be an output of 
evaluative processes and, as the results of this study suggest, it should not be a component of the 
Psychological Capital model but an output of this construct.

In theory, changing ones evaluation of a measure or stressor should maintain resilience. This idea is 
supported by the work of Coutu (2002), McCubbin (2001) and Werner (2003) who refer to the act of 
reconceptualising and reframing stressors as a means to moderate the effects of stressors. Similarly, 
Dweck & Leggett (1988) in their research on growth mind-set have suggested that reframing 
capabilities as learning, an ability that requires attentional control improves resilience (Aditomo, 
2015; Ng, 2018). It seems appropriate then that attentional control is likely to be a predictor of 
resilience.   
A further challenge to the current Psychological Capital model concerns the construct of self-efficacy. 
Bandura (1994, 1997) stated that self-efficacy and confidence were separate constructs, however 
Luthans (email, 2018) considered them to be the same in that they used a measure of self-efficacy 
that measured confidence. However, by using the Jerusalem and Schwarzer self-efficacy questions 
and Mays confidence questions for cognitive ability an EFA in this research was able to show that the 
constructs of self-efficacy and confidence were indeed separate (see table 5.22). 
7.3.1 Predictors of HOSE 
The components of HOSE are often cited as key psychological resources, however there has been 
little research into what predicts them. This study performed regression analysis into what resources 
predicted the components of Hope, Optimism and Self-Efficacy. These were emotional resources, 
cognitive resources, self-consciousness, and mindfulness and openness:  
7.3.1.1 Emotional Resources 
The ability to regulate or control ones emotions was key resource identified by the focus 
groups as required for Psychological Safety. This study measured the extent to which 
individuals felt they had emotional energy left at the end of the day, or whether they felt 
at the end of their rope or emotionally drained from work. Results from this study 
showed that the participants with greater emotional resources had higher levels of 
Psychological Safety.  
Emotional resources accounted for 42% of the variance in Optimism. This supports research 
suggesting that presence of a positive mood may be a signal that one's current resources 
are sufficient to deal with the task at hand. Positive mood has been associated with higher 
dopamine levels (Ashby, Isen, & Turken, 1999). Increased dopamine levels are associated 
with processing differences attributed to greater flexibility in the executive attention 
system, such as the ability to "switch set," or change one's understanding of a problem, 
enabling increased flexibility in judgment and behaviour (Isen, 1983, 2000; Isen et al., 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  238 
1987). It is possible that similar benefits accrue to optimists because of their 
characteristically more favourable mood. If this is the case, optimists might be better able 
to adjust their understanding of situations and problems to reflect new information, a 
processing difference that may impact their perceptions of Psychological Safety. 
Indeed, previous research has shown that those experiencing emotional exhaustion view 
their colleagues and the organisation through rust coloured glasses (Maslach, 2003, p.5) 
displaying cynicism and depersonalisation (Atouba & Lammers. 2018; Maslach, 2003; 
Maslach, Schafeli & Leiter, 2001). Atouba and Lammers (2018) found a significant 
correlation between emotional exhaustion and cynicism in their study of IT workers in a US 
IT Company. Baumeister et al.s (2007) ego-depletion theory would suggest that those who 
feel emotionally drained may not have the emotional resources to invest in broader and 
flexible thinking to go beyond an emotional response.   
This research supports the view that emotional resources contribute significantly to 
Optimism, which was shown to predict both Psychological Safety and Hope. 
7.3.1.2. Cognitive Resources 
Cognitive resources accounted for 4% of the variance in Self-efficacy and 3% of the variance 
in Hope. These measured the extent to which individuals felt they were able to deal with 
the physical and mental demands of work. Cognitive Agility and Capabilities were identified 
by the focus groups as being required for Psychological Safety.  Results of this study showed 
that employees with more cognitive resources had higher levels of Hope and Self-efficacy. 
This suggests that in having greater cognitive resources, individuals have the cognitive 
capacity to be able to identify pathways to goals and positively evaluate their ability to 
achieve them. This supports the work of Aspinwall, Richter and Hoffman (2001) who 
identified that those with greater cognitive resources were better able to process (possibly 
negative) facts but in a systemic way, creating more positive attitudes to their environment.  
7.3.1.3 Self-Consciousness 
Self-consciousness, added 1% to the variance in self-efficacy for employees.  
As expected, the correlations between self-consciousness and other psychological 
resources measures were negative. Self-consciousness involves evaluating how others may 
perceive or judge you and is a process of directing attention to ones self (Fenigstein et al., 
1975). If resources are considered to be finite, then directing them to ones self, would 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  239 
suggest that there are fewer to invest in other evaluatory processes: for instance, those of 
the environment, goals, outcomes etc. Furthermore, Duval and Wickland (1973) argue that 
self-consciousness is a product of where ones attention is focused.  
7.3.1.4 Mindfulness and Openness (LMS) 
Cognitive Flexibility was identified as a key resource for Psychological Safety by the focus 
groups. For this study, there were moderate positive correlations between both cognitive 
flexibility measures, the HOSE components, resilience and the cognitive and emotional 
resources. Scatterplots illustrate a positive linear relationship between cognitive flexibility, 
and attitudes to Psychological Safety and Resilience. Openness (LMS) accounted for 12% of 
the variance in self-efficacy.   
The LMS is a mindfulness questionnaire, and mindfulness concerns attentional focus and 
switching (Bishop et al., 2004) or the stability of attention (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2006, 
p.519). Research into improvements in attentional control through mindfulness have been 
mixed. Some studies finding Mindfulness programs led to improvements in attentional 
control (Jha, Krompinger & Baime, 2007; Malinowski, 2013). In contrast to this, Anderson, 
Lau, Segal and Bishop, (2007) found no change in participants attentional control after 
attending a mindfulness program, although the study measured attentional control using 
the Stroop test. In this study a similar task switching exercise had a statistically insignificant 
relationship with cognitive flexibility measures. Nevertheless, being mindful enables both 
attentional focus as well as maintaining a broader awareness of the environment in such a 
way as to be open to novelty. It is then conceivable that this will increase your self-efficacy. 
In believing you are able to come up with different ideas or solutions, you may in turn feel 
you are able to deal with whatever may come your way. 
In summary, the model resulting from the questionnaire data suggests that Psychological Safety and 
Resilience are predicted by evaluative processes underpinned by psychological resources. 
7.4 Attitudes 
The components of HOSE have been described as cognitive sets (Magalleta & Oliver, 1999), 
emotions (OSullivan, 2011) and resources (Bockorny & Youssef-Morgan, 2019; Luthans et al., 
2010, 2013, 2017). In terms of Hobfolls definition of resources, they could indeed be considered 
centrally valued or the means to obtain centrally valued ends (2002 p.307). However, definitions 
of Hope, Optimism and Self-Efficacy have consistently referred to expectations or belief systems: 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  240 
Hope as a motive derived from a belief in successful agency and pathways (Snyder, 1989), Optimism:  
an expectation for the future (Carver & Scheier, 2010) and Self-Efficacy as an expectation or a 
conviction (Bandura 1977 p.141). Such beliefs are evaluative processes:  Hope, Optimism and Self-
efficacy are the outputs of the evaluative processes of the goals achievement, outcomes and ones 
capability respectively. Attentional Control is a process of selecting what to focus attention on.  The 
meanings derived from these processes form attitudes (Greenwald, McGhee & Schwartz, 1998; 
Sweldens, Corneille & Yzerbyt, 2014; Walther, Nagengast & Trasselli, 2005) about a person, an object 
or even a thought and may subsequently determine behaviour (Olson & Kendrick, 2006; Reid, 2006; 
Walther et al., 2005).  
There is debate as to how attitudes are formed and the extent to which they consciously created. 
Staats and Staats (1958) demonstrated how attitudes could be formed unconsciously using positive 
and negative word parings as conditional stimuli.  Evidence from Neuroscience has identified the role 
of the amygdala in creating automatic responses to emotional stimuli and implicit learning (Stanley, 
Phelps & Banaji, 2008).  Research on implicit learning (Lewicki, Czyzewska & Hoffman, 1987; Lewicki, 
Hill & Czyzewska, 1992) and classical conditioning (Olson & Fazio, 2001) suggests that learning can 
occur despite the participants having no knowledge of it; known as evaluative conditioning. Here 
an unconditioned stimulus becomes conditioned through implicit learning, often produced 
experimentally through the use of picture pairing (Baeyens et al., 1992; Levey, & Martin, 1975; 
Walther et al., 2005). This process of automatic and quick processing is referred to as peripheral 
processing (Bohner, Erb & Siebler, 2008; Petty & Briol, 2015; Sweldens, et al., 2014) or associate 
processing (Gawronski & Bodenhausen, 2006), requiring few cognitive resources, relying existing 
patterns of knowledge (Gawronski & Bodenhausen, 2006). 
However, Petty and Cacioppo (1986) challenged this with their Elaboration Likelihood Model of 
Persuasion which posited that attitude creation could also be a result of a conscious cognitive 
process, referred to as systemic or central processing (Bohner et al., 2008; Petty & Briol, 2015; 
Sweldens et al., 2014) or propositional processing (Gawronski & Bodenhausen, 2006) requiring 
cognitive processing for reflection, evaluation and value attribution. This suggests that the source of 
attitudes may vary. Where there is little cognitive thought employed (low elaboration), attitudes can 
be influenced by emotions, whereas the application of cognitive thought (high elaboration) may 
mediate emotions creating a more cognitive based attitude (Petty & Briol, 2015). The extent to 
which an individual employs cognitive resources in the creation of attitude is dependent on the 
importance of the information as well as the availability of cognitive resources needed to evaluate 
the information (Cacioppo, Cacioppo & Petty, 2018; Wheeler, Briol & Hermann, 2007). Indeed, 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  241 
results of this research show a positive relationship between the amount of psychological resources 
and attitudes of Hope, Optimism and Self-efficacy.  
For organisations, this might suggest that if employees are given enough time and space to consider 
organisational events, logic will prevail.  Not necessarily.  Research has shown that individuals use 
affect as information (Albarracin & Kumkale, 2003; Schwarz & Clore, 1983).  Individuals evaluate 
information against what is already known or believed. The resulting affect has shown to impact the 
extent to which individuals process information.  If positive feelings are generated, then the 
individual deems the information valuable, and therefore motivated to expend cognitive resources 
on further processing resulting in more global processing enabling the individual to see the bigger 
picture with widened attention (Albarracin & Kumkale, 2003; Clore & Huntsingerm, 2007; 
Huntsinger, Isbell & Clore, 2014).  The reverse is true: for those experiencing negative affect, further 
cognitive processing is inhibited and therefore individuals adopt a narrower view (Albarracin & 
Kumkale, 2003; Clore et al., 2007; Huntsinger et al., 2014).  
Emotions therefore impact judgements and beliefs formed from evaluative processes.  Experiments 
with accounting students who were asked to judge the culpability of an accountancy firm in an 
organisations bankruptcy demonstrated that the more emotive and negative the consequences of 
the bankruptcy was, the more the accountancy firm were deemed liable. Many experiments have 
replicated these findings: suggesting that positive moods result in big picture thinking, whereas those 
in a negative mood focus on the minutiae (Bodenhausen, Kramer, & Ssser, 1994; Clore & 
Huntsinger, 2007; Isbell, Burns, & Haar, 2005; Isen, Daubman, & Nowicki, 1987).  
This may account for why organisational attempts to improve resilience through wellbeing and stress 
management initiatives, as with this training study, are not always successful.  Extrinsic mechanisms 
including those provided to create Psychological Safety will only succeed if the resulting mechanisms 
and messages create a positive affect and the employees have sufficient psychological resources to 
evaluate them, thereby enabling the formation of positive attitudes. This supports the findings from 
the focus groups that Psychological Safety is not solely an organisational or team construct. 
Participants agreed that the responsibility for Psychological Safety lay with both employee and the 
organisation.  Individual employees attitudes were cited as determinants of whether Psychological 
Safety is perceived; in particular sense of self and self-efficacy.   
So how do organisations manage or change attitudes? Although Bassili (2008) believes that strong 
attitudes are stable and resistant to change, changing already established attitudes has been shown 
to be possible (Bohner & Dickel, 2011; Petty & Brinol, 2010).  However, to change attitudes or over-
ride automatic thoughts self-control and attentional focus need to be applied in order to be able to 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  242 
reconfigure mental resources (Kashdan & Rottenberg, 2010 p.866) and consider alternative 
information and view. However, this requires psychological resources (Baumeister et al., 1998, 2007). 
Psychological resources are considered to positively contribute to health and well-being (Schaufeli & 
Buunk, 2003; Schaufeli & Taris, 2014), not only because they enable employees to better respond to 
the demands that consume or deplete their energy, but also because they promote positive 
psychological states (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007; Desrumaux et al., 2015).  
In one experiment participants were divided into groups, one of which was distracted by music or 
noise, thereby reducing their ability to engage psychological resources. They were all provided with a 
message that was either relevant or not relevant to them (providing high motivation or low 
motivation to process). Findings showed that when either motivation or ability (high distraction 
conditions) were low, participants used affect to determine attitude towards the message. However, 
when both were high, emotions had no influence on attitude, suggesting that although emotion may 
have been recognised by the participant, it could be overcome by a cognitive process that was 
employed to determine attitude (Albarracin & Kumkale, 2003).  
Results of this study indicated that only one resource increased between t1 and t2: LMS. The LMS 
questionnaire measured engagement, novelty seeking and novelty producing. This may be a useful 
resource when consciously forming attitudes. Engagement indicates a conscious awareness of ones 
environment, noticing changes and the new. This suggests a conscious gathering of environmental 
information. Even if those changes may potentially be threatening, an increase in ones ability to 
produce novel solutions may enable a more positive evaluation of the situation. Indeed, LMS was 
shown to account for 13% of the variance in self-efficacy, the predominant predictor of Resilience.   
These findings were supported by this research that indicated that the greater the cognitive and 
emotional resources available, along with increased openness, the more positive the attitudes of 
Hope, Optimism and Self-efficacy. This suggests that in order to apply conscious thinking to manage 
workplace emotions and attitudes employees need sufficient psychological resources to do so. 
Therefore, for employees to have the positive attitudes needed for Psychological Safety and 
Resilience, organisations and leaders need to ensure employees have the psychological resources 
needed to be able to form attitudes cognitively. 
7.5 Implications for Organisations & Leaders 
In defining Psychological Safety as a team construct, extant research has firmly placed the 
responsibility for an employees Psychological Safety in the hands of the organisation. Although 
Edmondson (2003) recognised the intrapersonal aspect of Psychological Safety, little research has 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  243 
been conducted in this area. This research supports the work of other studies in that the greatest 
contributor to Psychological Safety is the Meaningfulness.  Therefore, the organisation still has a 
primary role to play in Psychological Safety. Where this study adds to the research is recognising that 
in addition to providing extrinsic mechanisms for Psychological Safety, for the mechanisms to be 
effective and well received, the organisation needs to operate in such a way as to ensure the 
development and maintenance of employee psychological resources. 
Certainly organisations are making great strides into providing the means to ensuring employees 
have the psychological resources that can enable the positive attitudes needed for Psychological 
Safety and Resilience. However, creating an environment in which personal resources are preserved 
requires more than a well-being initiative; a holistic systematic approach across all functions of the 
organisations is needed, from the vision to processes, leadership to reward systems.  A well-
researched diagnostic model is that of the Burke-Litwin Causal Model of Organisational Performance 
and Change (Burke & Litwin, 1992). In defining transformational versus transactional mechanisms 
and including the external environment, the model is considered more comprehensive than the 
Galbraith STAR model (Kates & Galbraith, 2010) or McKinseys seven S model (Peters & Waterman, 
1982) whilst as the same time being simpler than a model such as the Nadler-Tushman Congruence 
model (Martins & Coetzee, 2009). In showing the cause and-effect relationships between the internal 
and external environments the model aids with both organisational effectiveness and change 
analysis (Burke & Litwin, 1992). Plotting the organisational implications of this study onto the model 
illustrates the holistic nature of creating an environment for the maintenance and development of 
employee psychological resources, the benefits of which this study has shown to be higher levels of 
Psychological Safety and Resilience.  The following section is structured around the Burke-Litwin 
model (see figure 7.3). Findings from thie research will be applied to each level of the model.  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  244 
7.5.1 Transformational Level 
The Transformational Level of the model refers to cultural characteristics. These include Vision and 
Mission, Leadership and Organisational Climate. Findings in this research provided evidence for 
organisations of the importance of a clear and credible vision and mission. A vision (future aspiration) 
and mission (current raison detre) together create a strategic gap from which the purpose and 
strategic goals of the organisation fall. Many organisations have one, or both of these, although often 
they are confused (Alegre et al., 2018; Bowen, 2018; Hurth, Ebert & Prabhu, 2018).  
This research has shown that meaningful work is still the primary predictor of Psychological Safety. 
Employees who experience meaningful work and purpose have been shown to have improved 
psychological wellbeing (Hurth et al., 2018) and motivation (Hackman & Oldham, 1976).  In creating a 
climate that is perceived as psychologically safe organisations should consider the role of Meaning 
when designing roles, articulating vision and societal contribution. It is meaning that helps create 
stability (Baldoni, 2011; Baumeister & Vohs, 2002: Quinn & Thakor, 2018) through the provision of a 
bigger purpose: a stable and consistent horizon that remains so no matter how choppy the sea. 
Meaning is particularly relevant given the findings that millennials (those born between 1981 and 
2000) who are now entering the workplace seek meaningful work (Hoffman, 2018; Manuti, Curci & 
Van der Heijden, 2018). Since Hope and Optimism were also shown to predict Psychological Safety 
Figure 7.3 Organisational Mechanisms for the Maximising of Employee Psychological Resources Using the Burke-
Litwin Model of Organisational Effectiveness (1992) 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  245 
this suggests that providing clear, realistic and achievable future outcomes are also important. Thus 
leaders need to be able to communicate vision and mission in a way that resonates with each 
employee.  
Great leaders are able to tell stories, create meaningful connections with tasks and goals (Ready, 
2002). Storytellers are able to articulate messages in a way that engages hearts and minds garner 
trust (Auvinen, Aaltio & Blomqvist, 2013; Harris & Barnes, 2006). The creation of a compelling 
narrative generates buy in (Denning, 2006) and influences others (Auvinen, Aaltio & Blomqvist, 2013) 
and increases the formation of positive attitudes (Hovland, Harvey & Sherif, 1957). 
Organisations will likely argue that there is a plethora of communication occurring, however often 
communication is conflicting. Effective communication can reduce ambiguity, confusion and increase 
an employees sense of efficacy (Maslach et al., 2001). Thus messages need to be consistent and as 
well as providing facts, be constructed to create positive affect (Greenwald et al., 2002). Of course, if 
employees lack the psychological resources to evaluative communication cognitively, responses are 
more likely to be based on emotion rather than consciously considered.  
As discussed in Chapter 1, in the VUCA environment, it is innovation that differentiates the successful 
from the unsuccessful (Tushman & Nadler, 1986).  An organisational climate free from threat is key 
to innovation and growth (West, 2000). To be able to see mistakes as a positive outcome requires 
an environment of learning which is both an antecedent and result of Psychological Safety.  More 
than organisational learning which refers to processes or activities that provide new information or 
knowledge and is individual-focused (Tsang, 1997), an environment of learning refers to the way in 
which an organisation is run: a culture or mind-set, applicable to all employees (Kontoghiorghes, 
Awbre & Feurig, 2005). Such environments have been shown to lead to improved organisational 
performance (Goh, Elliott & Quon,  2012) through increased innovation and effective change 
(Kontoghiorghes et al.,  2005),  job satisfaction (Rose, Kumar & Pak., 2009) team relationships 
(Carmeli et al, 2009a, b; Edmondson, 1999, 2003) and employees self-efficacy (Li & Yan, 2009). How 
the organisation is structured and operates is key to achieving this. 
7.5.2 Transactional Level 
7.5.2.1 Structure 
In their drive to maintain flexibility, organisations are striving to be boundary-less 
(Direnzo et al., 2011; Welsh, 2001). In doing so, boundaries become deliberately blurred 
(Direnzo et al., 2011): be they between structures, geographies, teams or roles. Research 
has shown that loose boundaries lead to poorer team performance (Faraj & Yan, 2009; 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  246 
McNeil, Mitchell & Parker, 2013). Without clear boundaries, employees can face increasing 
work-load, conflicting priorities and task uncertainty (Faraj & Yan, 2009).   Furthermore, 
studies in healthcare have shown that when roles overlap, employees perceive a threat to 
their professional identity and the resulting conflicts impede team performance (McNeil et 
al., 2013). Porous boundaries risk task uncertainty in terms of outcomes and accountability 
which can have a negative effect on Psychological Safety (Faraj & Yan, 2009).  
Therefore, organisations have a challenge: provide enough structure and clarity to offer a 
sense of security, a home for employees (De Smet et al., 2016 p.4) with a clear role, 
whilst also remaining flexible enough to meet the demands of a changing market.  
7.5.2.2 Management Practise  
How an organisation operates will influence the extent of innovation and learning.  The 
principles of Dwecks Growth Mind-set (Dweck & Leggett, 1988), which promotes the 
benefits of seeing failures as learning and feedback rather than a reason to punish, sends a 
message that it is safe to try new things. This does not include failing repeatedly at the 
same thing: indeed if this is happening no learning is taking place Growth mind-set culture 
acknowledges that everyone can learn and grow, but that not everyone is the same. 
Learning is measured and rewarded with the same importance as the outcome or result 
measuring the individual against themselves rather than others.   
This does not suggest a Pollyanna soft and fluffy organisation. As Schuitema (2000) 
argues, the leaders role is to care and grow the individual, team and organisation. If an 
individual is compromising the growth of another, a team or the organisation, then the 
right thing to do is to manage that individual; providing an opportunity to grow and change. 
Schuitema (2000) acknowledges that the growth needed by an individual may need to take 
place outside of the organisation and thus removed from the organisation. 
As part of the learning organisations specific mechanisms can be established to enable 
employees to practise skills and importantly reflect on the results and their learning 
(Edmondson, 2003; Senge, 1990). The process of reflection is considered key to learning 
(Argyris, 1994: Kolb, 2007). Organisations might consider structuring meetings or training 
events to enable reflection: creating spaces for reflection; enabling all employees to coach 
each other through a reflective process.  Of course, in order to reflect, employees need 
time, space and psychological resources. 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  247 
7.5.2.3 Organisational Systems 
Systems such as processes and policies can be designed to develop and maximise employee 
psychological resources. However, recent trends in organisational operating models may 
inadvertently fall foul of this.  
Flexible working is proving a popular benefit for employees. And yet the greatest barrier to 
flexible working is cited as the negative attitudes among senior managers, line managers 
and supervisors (CIPD, 2019c, p.30). Legislatively, in the UK, there have been great strides 
in the rights of employees to request flexible working. Although there are many ways to 
implement flexible working, recent report by the CIPD (Jan 2019c) indicates that it is most 
often considered to be part time work or working from home. Of all the different types of 
flexible working, the only arrangements that have increased over time have been zero hour 
contracts and working from home (CIPD, 2019c). For every type of flexible working, it is 
women with children who utilise them most. 
This does however raise the issue of structures and in particular remote or virtual teams. 
Not all employees are keen to work from home alone, finding it isolating (Hunsaker & 
Hunsaker, 2008). The introduction of remote working has reduced social opportunities, 
including corporate social responsibility projects, albeit formally. Developing relationships 
and being part of a social group is beneficial to mental health (Thoits, 1995). Interestingly, 
findings from a four-day-week flexible working study by Henley Business School (Walker & 
Fontinha, 2019) showed that the extra day off was spent with family or friends. For those 
that need interaction, organisations and leaders need to provide mechanisms to connect 
regularly with others and feel part of a team. There is also research to suggest that 
operating remotely can cause retention issues (Weymouth et al., 2007).   
Many remaining office locations are now open-plan which has been shown to cause 
distraction and stress (Haapakangas et al., 2018). As this research has demonstrated, 
attentional control is important for Resilience. Persistent distractions and noise can reduce 
our ability to focus. Thus, organisation should consider providing spaces where employees 
are able to focus without interruption. This can also promote opportunities for reflection, a 
key enabler for learning (Kolb & Kolb, 2005).  
Long working hours are detrimental to our mental resources and mental health. A culture 
of long hours whereby sleep is compromised can reduce psychological resources (Sakamoto 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  248 
et al., 2013; Tassi et al., 2006). More recently Nakata (2017) researched the impact of long 
hours (12+ hours) finding that those working long hours had a greater chance of displaying 
depressive symptoms and reduced job satisfaction.  
Recent research by Henley Business School, surveyed 505 C suite business leaders and 2, 
063 employees to determine the impact of the implementation of a four-day working week. 
Their findings showed that the reduced hours from a four-day week resulted in improved 
employee satisfaction, aided with retention, created cost savings whilst also maintaining 
quality and productivity (Walker & Fontinha, 2019). This suggests that when it comes to 
working hours and workplace performance, less means more.   
The extent to which an individual can grow and develop both in terms of job related skill 
and personal development should be given as much importance as performance goals. For 
organisations to develop and grow, their people need to do the same. Establishing reward 
processes that only measure output rather than growth can create a workforce who merely 
apply 1 years experience over many years, never growing or developing. Furthermore, 
many reward policies create fear (e.g. commission) or uncertainty (e.g. bonuses) the 
consequence of which is employee insecurity. Rather than investing psychological resources 
in developing, growing and innovating, these incentivise their deployment for self-
preservation. 
7.5.2.4 Individual Level: The Role of Goals 
Given that Hope and Optimism predicted Psychological Safety, feeling positive about 
achievable outcomes appears to be key. Edmondson (2003) refers to interpersonal 
consequences (2003, p.8) of actions determining levels of Psychological Safety. Schulman 
(1999) recommends organisations recruit for optimists who have been shown to have 
lower neuroticism (Scheier, 1994; Smith et al., 1989), more resilient (Scheier et al., 1986), 
persevere more (Seligman, 1998) and have greater self-esteem (Wanberg & Banas, 2000). 
However, Schulman (1999) does concur that this alone is not sufficient (or ethical). Even for 
those with high trait optimism can at times be pessimistic as state optimism is a process of 
evaluating a particular event or situation (Kluemper et al., 2009; Peterson, 2000). And, as 
Kleumper et al.,s (2009) research demonstrated, state optimism rather than trait optimism 
appears to be the greater predictor of task outcomes job outcomes. Therefore, to feel 
psychologically safe, employees need to be optimistic about consequences of a specific 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  249 
event or interaction, even when a mistake is made (Carmeli et al., 2009a, b; Edmondson, 
2003). This implies that goal setting is important in creating the hope, optimism and self-
efficacy needed for Psychological Safety and Resilience. When setting goals, managers need 
to ensure that the employee is clear not only about what the final outcomes should be, but 
that they are able to identify pathways to achieving the goals and have the agency, the will 
and belief in their ability to achieve the goal. In developing such goals, employee attention 
on potential threats can be reduced (Vogt et al., 2013).  Indeed, this research both supports 
and adds to the literature on goal setting theory (Locke et al., 1981).  
Locke and Latham broke down goals into two main characteristics: Content (the outcome of 
the task) and Intensity (the resources required to achieve it).  Thus, goals are considered to 
provide a sense of purpose and direction, clarity as to what is expected and the effort 
needed to motivate action (Locke et al., 1981). These elements could be represented by 
Hope: the agency and the pathway to achievement of a goal and Optimism about reaching 
the outcome. Goals provide a measure or standard against which an individual can appraise 
their capabilities and therefore their self-efficacy (Bandura, 1986; Wood & Bandura. 1989).  
Employees performance is improved with clear achievable goals and self-efficacy 
(Cervonne, 1991). As goals form a central commonality between Hope, Optimism and Self-
efficacy (see figure 7.4) it is apparent why Luthans defined these components as critical to 
workplace performance.  
Locke and Latham (1990) maintain that self-efficacy is the antecedent to the setting of high 
personal goals although Garland (1983, 1985) disagrees, arguing that goals are an 
antecedent to self-efficacy. Research in this thesis supported Eden and Ravids (1982) 
findings of a reciprocal relationship between them: Hope accounting for 34% of the 
variance in Self-efficacy and Self-efficacy accounting for 48% of the variance in Hope. If the 
key to goal setting theory are attitudes of hope and self-efficacy then this research argues 
that the achievement of goals is a result of the psychological resources that enable the 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  250 
evaluative processes of Hope and Self-efficacy. Bernecker, Herrmann and Brandsttter 
(2017) recognise the role of 
mind-set in determining 
whether to pursue or abandon 
a goal, referring to a 
deliberate mind-set (2017, 
p.525) through which the cost-
benefit of goal pursuit is 
evaluated against desirability 
and attainability. As suggested 
in this research, the formation 
of deliberate mind-sets require 
psychological resources.  
Locke and Latham argue when dealing with the new or complex, the setting of high or 
difficult goals will motivate people to search for new knowledge (2006, p.265).  In todays 
environment looking for new knowledge is critical. However, it has been found that this is 
only the case for those who are already experiencing high self-efficacy and have the 
resources available to achieve the challenging goal (Stajkovic & Luthans 1988; Thompson 
Hochwarter & Mathys, 1997). The ever- popular SMART approach to goal setting can lead 
to a narrow focus (Locke & Latham, 2006) whereby employees (and leaders) fail to notice 
the ever-changing environment and consequently when to disengage from a goal. When 
psychological resources are low, attentional focus narrows (Petty & Briol, 2015) including 
the ability to engage with the environment, focus attention on the relevant and seek novel 
solutions. A challenging goal without the necessary psychological resources may lead to 
lower self-efficacy and consequently, as this research shows, lower resilience.  
As Scheier and Carver point out, situational factors can influence our assessment of our 
capabilities (1983). Goal Setting Theory does not consider the VUCA environment. Most 
goal-related research has been performed in controlled environments using students 
(Bandura & Wood 1989; Cervone, 1991; Earley & Lituchy, 1991; Locke et al., 1984; Wood & 
Bandura, 1989; Wood et al., 1990.), army recruits (Eden & Ravid, 1982) those experiencing 
mental health issues or heart attack survivors (Bandura, 1977). In these studies, the goals 
provided were clear and the outcome well defined. During experiments, there were no 
significant consequences of failing to meet the performance standards. Garland states that 
the research environment within which a participant (usually an undergraduate student) is 
Figure 7.4 Diagram Illustrating The Integral Role 
Of Goals In Hope, Optimism And Self-Efficacy. 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  251 
assigned a task by a superior (the researcher) is little different from a real subordinate and 
a real supervisor (1983 p.21). However, the consequence of failing to meet performance 
standards in an organisational setting has far greater consequences when the supervisor is 
your immediate boss. The importance of others view of your self-efficacy can impact your 
own view (Bandura, 1982) as shown in this research, self-consciousness predicting self-
efficacy. Thus the experimental environment does not always reflect the current complex 
organisational environment in which goals are less clear and sometimes competing 
(Mohrman, 1999) and the pathways to achievement are muddied.  
The manner in which goals are set can impact psychological resources. Autonomy in goal 
setting has been found to have a positive effect on self-efficacy (Locke et al., 1984). This 
might be somewhat counter-intuitive since Baumeister et al. (1998) suggest that in having 
to make a choice or decision can use up psychological resources (ego-depletion). However, 
Moller, Deci and Ryan (2006) were able to demonstrate that those who made their own 
decision autonomously persisted longer at a task than those assigned the same task, thus 
demonstrating that autonomy moderated psychological resource loss. However, autonomy 
is often lost when organisations impose stretch goals in line with the shareholder agenda, 
not those of the individual employees (Markovitz, 2012). As a result, employees may not 
have optimism that they will achieve a successful outcome. However, the outcome is only 
part of the formula for success. When setting goals, managers should consider ensuring 
that the employee is clear not only about what the final outcomes should be, but that they 
are able to identify pathways to achieving the goals and have the agency, the will and belief 
in their ability to achieve the goal.   
Stajkovic and Luthans (1998) recommend that managers provide accurate descriptions of 
the task employees are asked to perform and that employees are instructed how to 
execute the task (p.255). However, this is contrary to the need for autonomy in goal setting. 
Also, it assumes that the manager knows what needs to be done and how. This is not 
always the case as managers deal with new challenges and problems in fluid environments.  
Goals are ever changing, unclear, (Li & Bagger, 2008; Schabracq & Cooper, 2000) or may 
change unexpectedly (Pulakos, 2015). Some may be team or departmental goals as 
organisations increasingly require their employees to work with broader, dispersed teams 
(Cartwright, 2003; Nash, 1994; Pulakos, 2015) and therefore the achievement of a goal is 
not always solely the responsibility of one employee. Consequently, the employees belief 
in their ability to action the goal may be compromised (Darnon et al., 2007; Li & Bagger, 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  252 
2008; Schabracq & Cooper, 2000) possibly depriving the employee of a sense of mastery 
and [increased] efficacy (Earley & Lituchy, 1991 p.83). 
The Goal Setting Theory does not take account of the VUCA environment in which 
employees are working, the impact of employee affect or mindset and takes a fixed 
mindset approach to goal achievement. This research can begin to address these 
limitations thus building on Goal Setting Theory.  The relationship between Self-Efficacy and 
Hope (goals) was supported. This suggests that setting higher more difficult goals without 
ensuring the employee has the psychological resources available may reduce Hope and 
Self-Efficacy which in turn may reduce Resilience and Psychological Safety.  
Applying the findings of this research to the Burke-Litwin (1992) model has demonstrated that there 
are organisational mechanisms for maximising employee psychological resources that enable the 
attitudes required to support Psychological Safety and Resilience. This is important for organisations 
as it suggests that it is not only the processes provided that create Psychological Safety, it is how they 
are perceived and interpreted by employees. Indeed, a criticism of Edmondsons questionnaire 
(1999) may be in the aggregating of individual team members scores which creates one measure for 
all. However, the meaning of organisational processes are the result of individual perceptions and 
cognitive processes (Baer & Frese, 2003; Glick, 1988; Jones & James, 1979).  Organisational 
mechanisms for Psychological Safety may be perceived differently for different employees (Detert & 
Burris, 2007; Frazier et al., 2017; Jones & James, 1979; Parker et al., 2003; Zinsser & Zinsser, 2016) 
resulting in different impacts on individual employee beliefs and behaviours (Wanless, 2016a; Zinsser 
& Zinsser, 2016). Therefore, the success of organisational mechanisms for Psychological Safety and 
Resilience requires input from the organisation and its leaders and, as this research has shown, the 
employee themselves.  
7.6 Implications for Employees: A Proposed 
Model  
The provision of mechanisms to create Psychological Safety and Resilience are only part of the story. 
Using the leading a horse to water metaphor, organisations can provide the best trough on the 
market, which contains the purest water and is set in the most perfect environment in which to drink 
from the trough. The organisation can communicate about the quality of the water. Furthermore, 
our horse may even receive training on how best to drink from this nirvana-like trough, or have 
drinking from said trough set in its annual goals. However, none of these initiatives will guarantee 
our equine friend will indulge. Output from the focus groups agreed that the employee had a role to 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  253 
play in creating their own Psychological Safety. So, what can employees do to help assure their 
Psychological Safety and Resilience in the context of VUCA environment? 
Based on the findings from the focus groups, the questionnaires and the training intervention 
feedback, five key techniques are identified to enable employees to create and maintain their 
Psychological Resources. These are then constructed into a proposed model. 
7.6.1 Self Care 
There is no great revelation in the advice to sleep well, exercise and have down time. And yet, 
unless the individual takes responsibility for ensuring this, other activities such as work will encroach 
upon the time needed for these. That which is not gained within the workplace, the employee could 
seek elsewhere: If an employee is not gaining the social interaction they require from work, then find 
it outside of work. Take time to reflect, whether that be via mediation, mindfulness or merely 
reviewing the days activities: not just to reflect on what happened during the day and what you 
intend to do about it but reflect and learn about the self thereby becoming more self-aware.  
Research shows that exercise improves cognitive processes such as executive function and memory 
(Sanders et al., 2019), particular aerobic exercise (Sez de Asteasuet al., 2017) although ten-Brinke et 
al. (2019) only support the improvements found in executive function, but not memory function.  
Organisations are recognising the importance of exercise in well-being, offering benefits such as gym 
membership. Of the 1078 respondents of the latest CIPD/Simplyhealth Well-Being at work survey 
(2019a), 33% offer of gym membership or exercise classes as an employee benefit.   
7.6.2 Self-awareness 
Being self-aware was a popular output of the focus groups. If Psychological Safety and resilience is a 
product of psychological resources, then gaining self-awareness to understand what replenishes and 
depletes our resources can aid our mental well-being. Being aware enough to recognise fatigue, 
stress or unhappiness is the first step in managing this. Regular reflection (mindfulness) and gaining 
feedback from others can help achieve self-awareness. 
7.6.3 Self-Regulation 
Being able to manage ones thoughts, to be able to focus attention on the positive rather than 
ruminate has been shown to maintain mental health (Derryberry et al., 2002b; Eysenck et al., 2007).  
Recognising that what we think about and how we feel is a choice, something that can be managed, 
was cited as an important contributor to Psychological Safety in the focus groups. Certainly, the 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  254 
qualitative feedback from the training study also indicated that understanding this and managing 
automatic thoughts was one of the more useful aspects of the workshop.  
Learning to apply the circle of influence also enables individuals to control where their attention 
goes. Worrying about that which is outside of the locus of control merely depletes resources and can 
cause stress or anxiety (Sandler & Lakey, 1982). Being able to identify the areas in which it is worth 
investing psychological resources in, helps focus thoughts and feelings towards that which is within 
ones locus of control.  
7.6.4 Self-Fulfilment 
Having meaning and purpose at work has been shown to improve motivation and commitment to 
work (Hackman & Oldham, 1976; Kahn, 1990; May et al., 2004). However, understanding your 
purpose in life, why you do what you do, had the greatest impact on the workshop participants. 
Understanding values, needs and motivations not only increased self-awareness but provided 
meaning. 
Ironically, an important realisation for participants was to detach ones purpose from the job. Studies 
show that loss of job either through redundancy or retirement can lead to a sense of loss, feeling 
useless (Pinquart, 2002) or having no purpose (Sharpley, 1997). Yet it is not what we do that fulfils 
us, its why we do it (Sinek, 2011). If an individuals purpose or identity is tied to a specific role, it is 
no surprise that fear of loss of the role can result in defensiveness and resistance to change.  By 
understanding that your purpose and who you are is bigger than your job may help create a sense of 
freedom. Your job is a means to achieving your purpose and identity (thus the need for meaningful 
work). It is not your purpose or who you are.  
7.6.5 Self-Improvement 
A limited mind-set results in taking a binary approach to evaluating situations or ourselves; right 
and wrong or good and bad, which may impact our self-esteem and self-efficacy. However, a 
growth mind-set has been shown to improve motivation, perseverance and self-efficacy in students 
(Aditomo, 2015; Dweck, 2009; Ng, 2018). Believing that we are not the finished article, that learning 
is lifelong enables us to choose to see mistakes as opportunity for learning rather than 
punishment.  
This research suggests that these five aspects of the self are required to maintain psychological 
resources which was shown to lead to positive attitudes that contribute to Psychological Safety and 
Resilience. Although statistically, none of these were significant in the training study, qualitative 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  255 
support was shown for each of these. In the focus groups, all of these were cited as intrinsic 
resources needed for an individual to maintain Psychological Safety.  
Of course, the skills needed to improve ones own psychological resources, such as meditation, self-
regulation etc. may need to be developed. Whether it be for students or employees, mechanisms to 
provide the techniques and tools to manage and maintain psychological resources may need to be 
offered.  Organisations and some schools are already teaching resilience and well-being classes. 
However, alone they are not sufficient. As this research demonstrated, training would be futile if the 
individual does not have the 
psychological resources available to learn, 
process and change attitude. 
This research suggests that these five 
self aspects may be mechanisms to 
help employees build their psychological 
resources. The longitudinal study 
demonstrated an increase in HOSE by 
teaching the topics within each of the 
self aspects (see figure 7.5). However, 
the changes were small and further 
research is needed here. 
Attentional control was placed in the 
centre of the model. There is much 
literature that refers to the importance of attentional control for psychological resources. The ability 
to select and control where ones attention is focused can enable each of these five aspects. Current 
literature provides support for the role of attentional control in achieving self-awareness (Chung, Su 
& Su, 2012; Duval & Wicklund, 1973; Evans et al., 2009; Silvia & Duval, 2001), Self-regulation or 
control (Chung et al., 2012; Derryberry 2002a; Duckworth & Steinberg, 2015; Kashdan et al., 2010; 
Stawski et al., 2010), learning (or unlearning) to be able to deal with the new or novel (Brook et al., 
2016; Ionescu. 2012. Stawski et al., 2010) and values based behaviour (Kashdan & Rottenberg, 2010). 
The development of cognitive flexibility, particularly attentional control, has been shown to enable 
employees to adapt to new roles, tackle new tasks and problems (Brook et al., 2016; Ionescu. 2012; 
Kashdan et al., 2010; Louis & Sutton, 1991) and cope with negative stimuli (Derryberry, 2002b). 
Employees that demonstrate cognitive flexibility have been shown to be able to inhibit negative 
feelings and attitudes thereby creating less resistance to change (Chung et al., 2012). Finally, Stawski 
Figure 7.5 The Self-Model  Mechanisms For Individuals To 
Develop And Maintain Their Own Psychological Resources 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  256 
et al.  (2010) provided support for the hypothesis that cognitive flexibility enables adults to regulate 
their emotions, balance multiple roles, make quick decisions, use good judgment and reasoning, and 
navigate complex and novel tasks and situations (p.340). 
It seems that employees today, and in the future, would be more likely to maintain and even 
replenish their psychological resources if they were cognitively flexible so as to control their 
attention.   
7.7 Implications for Education 
An interesting and significant finding from the student data (although limited) was the difference in 
the quantity of resources between students and employees; employees having significantly more 
than students. Clearly this study on students was too small to draw any firm conclusions, however it 
has raised some questions. Specifically, when and how, during the transition from school/university 
into the workplace are these skills learnt? If these skills are what enables an individual to maintain 
their psychological resources, then leaving it to chance as to whether an individual will learn them 
seems a risky strategy. Indeed, some never learn these skills: many of us have known a person who is 
unable to control their emotions, or someone with a totally fixed mind-set. Perhaps it is worth 
considering what this might mean for our educational system.  Should we be building the means of 
Hope, Optimism and Self-Efficacy into the school curriculum to ensure that building and maintaining 
psychological resources become a life skill. The principles of a growth mindset is being taught in 
some schools, however the measurements and standards of pass or fail to which students are 
expected to conform confound this. Personal progress and growth is not recognised as a success. As 
such the skills of reflection are rarely taught: even in this PhD, there is no requirement for reflection 
as to the personal learning and growth gained over the three-year study.  
Clearly this size of this study is insufficient upon which to make such bold statements about the 
educational curriculum, however given the benefits of maintaining and developing psychological 
resources, perhaps it may be an area for further study. 
7.8 Limitations and Further Research 
To the authors knowledge, this study has been the first to research the individual psychological 
resources needed for Psychological Safety and has added to the literature on resilience. In doing so it 
has identified areas for further research. The following section will identify the limitations of the 
studies and opportunities for further research. 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  257 
An overall assumption upon which this study is based is that psychological resources are limited. As 
discussed in the literature review, there is debate concerning this, and taking this approach may be 
considered a limitation of the study. However, given the increasing demands on employees and the 
awareness of mental health issues in the workplace, this worst case scenario approach was taken. 
Naturally, future research into achieving limitless psychological resources, and importantly how to 
leverage this would be welcomed. 
7.8.1 Measures 
As none of the behavioural measures demonstrated statistical significance, all data in this study was 
based on a selection of established self-report questionnaires. As well as the challenge of respondent 
bias and the Kruger-Dunning effect (1999) a potential issue with the use of different questionnaires 
was the variety of measurement scales. 
This research measured specific psychological resources from three models. However, there may be 
other psychological resources that better predict either Psychological Safety or Resilience. Although 
Self-Efficacy, Hope and Optimism are often cited as key psychological resources, there has been little 
research into what predicts them. This research begins to look at what is needed for the HOSE 
resources. Future research into the relationship between psychological resources may expand our 
understanding of the key resources and how to develop them, in particular the role of cognitive 
flexibility and mastery.  
However, this research found the measurements of cognitive flexibility to be anomalous. Firstly, the 
practical experiments designed to measure attentional control and divergent thinking showed no 
significant relationship with any of the variables including the ACS and LMS measures. One may 
argue that the LMS and ACS are self-report and therefore the impartial tasks experiments may be 
the more objective measure. Alternatively, it may be that these experiments do not measure the 
same construct as the questionnaires.  
Understanding the construct of a psychological resource may be key.  For example, sense of humour 
has been associated with positive orientation to life (Kuiper, Martin & Dance, 1992), leadership 
performance in women (Schnurr, 2008) and health (Boyle & Joss-Reid, 2004). There are initiatives to 
develop humour such as the 7 Humour Habits Program based on the work of McGhee (1974) and the 
Humour to Cope and Connect Workshop (Baisley & Grunberg, 2019), however each of these develop 
humour by enabling cognitive skills such as emotional regulation, cognitive flexibility and cognitive 
mastery. Self-consciousness, a predictor of self-efficacy has been shown to be a consequence of 
attentional focus on the self (Duval & Wicklund, 1973; Fengistein et al., 1975). This raises a potential 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  258 
for future research into the extent to which cognitive flexibility and cognitive mastery underpin other 
psychological resources.  
As demonstrated when designing the workshop for the longitudinal study, developing the HOSE 
attitudes requires providing participants with a toolkit of strategies (Luthans et al., 2008a) which 
develop the proximal outcomes of Hope, Optimism and Self-efficacy (Luthans et al., 2010 p.50). 
Thus the workshop was designed to increase the psychological resources that were thought to 
contribute to these attitudes: the growth mind-set, purpose, managing automatic thoughts and 
locus of control. Had these been measured directly by using scales such as Dwecks Growth Mindset 
questionnaire (2000), Rotters Locus of Control Scale (1966) and The Meaning of Life Questionnaire 
(Steger et al., 2006) perhaps results may have been more significant.  However, the purpose was to 
increase attitudes for Psychological Safety and Resilience. Although there was an increase in HOSE 
and LMS results post workshop, in future it may be beneficial to measure the topics taught directly as 
well as attitudes and psychological resources in order to determine the most powerful tools for 
developing positive attitudes. Furthermore, as well as a greater number of participants, a 
longitudinal study may be useful over longer periods of time.  A potential area for future research 
may be in understanding how and when employees learn or acquire psychological resources so that 
this can be proactively taught to students prior to joining the workplace. Given the rise in mental 
health issues for young people (Bethune, 2019) proactively equipping students with the skills for 
Psychological Safety and Resilience may offer a proactive solution.  A longitudinal study of 
psychological resources and attitudes of 16 year olds through to early transition into the workplace 
and later workplace experiences may offer insight into the Psychological Safety and Resilience for 
both organisations and educational establishments alike.  
7.8.2 Participants 
Responses to questionnaires were low. Completion of questionnaires was most likely when they 
were completed as part of an exercise in a workshop. Remote completion impacted the return rate 
despite incentivisation. Future initiatives may wish to consider, face to face measurement at each 
completion time. A further tactic to increase response rates and sample sizes may have been to 
reduce the length of the questionnaire. For employees, Kahns meaningfulness dimension was 
surveyed, adding a further 25 questions. Given the purpose was to assess intrinsic resources, this 
could have been omitted. However, its inclusion was able to confirm that traditional mechanisms of 
job significance and importance are still key to Psychological Safety, thus re-enforcing the role of 
organisations in Psychological Safety. 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  259 
The extent to which the participants of both student and longitudinal study represent the general 
population may also be in question. Students were sourced from a prestigious private girls school, 
privately educated pupils representing only 6.5% of UK school aged children (Independent Schools 
Council, 2019). The employee respondents in the longitudinal study were attending a degree in 
Business and Leadership, paid for by their employers. Given the investment involved by employers, it 
could be argued that having been selected for the program, these employees had already 
demonstrated self-efficacy, optimism and ability to meet goals. This may account for the lack of 
change in results between t1 and t2.  
The inclusion of a control group for employees would provide a better indication of magnitude of 
effect and future longitudinal research might consider both increased diversity of participants and 
the inclusion of a control group to add further rigour to the studies. 
Although students were not the primary target group for this student, the results indicated that 
students had fewer psychological resources as predictors of Psychological Safety and Resilience than 
employees. Given these findings it may have been useful to have included the sections of the 
Availability and Psychological Safety questionnaires that were omitted for students. The Availability 
measure for students omitted the three questions relating to self-consciousness. For employees 
this accounted for 10% of the variance in availability.  Similarly, the 10 co-worker questions omitted 
from the student Psychological Safety questionnaire, accounted for 14% of the variance in 
Psychological Safety for employees. To have reworded the self-consciousness and co-worker 
questions to be student-relevant may have provided an insight as to the extent to which students 
expend psychological resources in their relationships with peers.   
Future research into the systematic implementation of growth mind-set and cognitive flexibility on 
both student and organisational performance, if shown to be positive, may change the experience of 
school for students and teachers as well as work for leaders and employees. Some schools are 
already teaching the concept of growth mindset, however the challenge is that how they are 
measured at school (in terms of pass or fail) and later within the workplace (win/lose, meet goal/fail 
to meet goal) falls foul of the principles of the growth mind-set.  However, for organisations, a more 
relevant measure of a growth mind-set may be needed as Dwecks questionnaire is designed for 
children. Further research and development of a measure for employee growth mind-set may enable 
quantitative research into organisational performance.  
An interesting observation posited early in the focus groups was that permanent employees felt no 
more psychologically safe than contractors, indeed sometimes less so. If Psychological Safety is a 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  260 
product of organisational mechanisms such as secure jobs, investment in career development, 
relationship with team members, then what are the mechanisms for contractors, who may forgo 
these mechanisms, to feel safe and resilient?  Without the organisational mechanisms, a contractors 
Psychological Safety may be more intrinsically driven. Given the increasing propensity of VUCA 
organisations to use contractors (Moreno, 2019; Wakabayashi, 2019) this may be a useful area of 
future study.  Similarly, the rise of remote working may impact Psychological Safety, given that 
relationships with team members and leaders remain key to Psychological Safety. Understanding 
differences in Psychological Safety of remote teams may also benefit leaders and how they manage 
dispersed teams.

8 Conclusion  
Todays VUCA organisations strive to be lean and agile in order to maintain competitiveness. 
Employees are expected to be able to deal with the unknown, innovatively problem solve and adapt. 
A key requirement to do so is Psychological Safety. And yet, the traditional mechanisms of creating 
Psychological Safety, such as job descriptions, role clarity and stable team membership are now more 
fluid, agile and boundary-less to enable organisations to rapidly respond to changing environments. 
As such, for employees to rely solely on the organisation for the provision of their Psychological 
Safety may be fruitless.  This study demonstrated that employees can develop psychological 
resources to enable their own Psychological Safety. 
This research has also added to the literature by developing Luthans Psychological Capital model. 
Resilience was shown to be a consequence of psychological resources, in particular attitudes, and 
therefore is better placed as an output of the model. Cognitive Flexibility, a key psychological 
resource for todays organisations was shown to be a worthy replacement for resilience. 
Finally, an importantly to organisations, the research demonstrated that the psychological resources 
identified for Psychological Safety (and resilience) could be developed through the use of a face to 
face workshop.  
8.1 Contribution to Knowledge and Practise 
This study makes several contributions to the field of knowledge.  
Firstly, the removal of resilience from the Psychological Capital model supports the extant literature 
arguing that resilience is a result of a combination of factors (Egeland et al., 1993; Glantz & Sloboda, 
2002; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003). Furthermore, the poor contribution of resilience in regression analysis 
does add to the opacity surrounding the inclusion of resilience in the Psychological Capital model 
(see chapter 5).   Prior to this study, evidence of increased personal resources leading to increased 
resilience was anecdotal, particularly in the context of the workplace (Britt, 2016; Gordon & 
Coscarelli, 1996; Kumpfer, 2002; Meredith et al., 2011; Park, 1998; Ryff & Singer, 2003; Sommer, 
2016; Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003). However, this study has shown that greater psychological resources 
lead to greater resilience.  
The results of this study also contribute to our understanding of the constructs of Psychological 
Safety and Resilience from an individual perspective. Data suggested that it is attitude that predicts 
Psychological Safety and Resilience: how one chooses to interpret the environment and interactions

within in and where one chooses to focus attention. In doing so, this adds to the research on both 
Psychological Safety and Resilience that the individual has a role to play in their creation and are not 
solely products of organisational or group mechanisms. Psychological resources were shown to 
predict attitudes. An interesting addition to the field is the different predictors of Psychological 
Safety and Resilience. Resilience was predicted by cognitive resources, whereas Psychological Safety 
was a combination of cognitive and emotional psychological resources. This is an important 
differentiation for organisations when considering how to develop Psychological Safety and 
Resilience in employees. 
Finally, the cognitive flexibility measures were shown to predict self-efficacy and resilience. This adds 
to the relatively new literature on the role of cognitive flexibility in the workplace, in particular the 
role of western mindfulness; i.e. awareness of ones environment, focusing ones attention and being 
open to novelty, particularly relevant in the context of VUCA organisations.  In addition, this research 
had added to the literature by beginning to look at the relationship between psychological resources: 
what predicts self-efficacy, hope and optimism.  
Although the premise of this study was that employees have a role to play in the creation of their 
Psychological Safety, the research has implications for both employees and organisations. Indeed, it 
has re-enforced the importance of how organisations manage their employees. For organisations, 
the availability of wellbeing programs and initiatives may not necessarily improve employees 
Psychological Safety or Resilience. If attitudes determine Psychological Safety and Resilience, 
organisations should focus on ensuring that employees have the psychological resources available to 
be able to evaluate their environment cognitively rather than emotionally. At best this will help 
create positive attitudes, at worst an acceptance of events and the rationale for them.  Having 
available psychological resources may enable negative events to be addressed with hope, optimism 
and self-efficacy.    
Rather than relying on well-being programs to support employee mental health, manage so that the 
need for such programs is the exception rather than the rule. Management practises that proactively 
allow the maintenance and replenishment of psychological resources enabling Psychological Safety 
and Resilience may be more beneficial for both organisational and employee performance. Leaders 
can encourage learning and growth in a safe environment to improve self-efficacy, collaboratively set 
realistic goals that results in a reasonable and manageable workload, be clear on purpose, vision and 
communications. 
The findings have implications for organisational training: often used as part of resilience or stress 
management. If resilience is a product of attitudes and psychological resources, then resilience per se 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  263 
cannot be trained. It is the components that create resilience that need to be developed. However, 
traditional training courses, although providing useful techniques, may only be of benefit if the 
employee already has the psychological resources to be able to learn new information. Perhaps 
psychological resources may be better maintained or replenished through interesting purposeful 
work, time out and trusting relationships.  
This research confirmed that employees also have a role to play in their Psychological Safety.  To look 
solely to organisations for their own Psychological Safety and Resilience seems a passive approach to 
ones own mental health. Attitude is a choice. Employees can implement their own mechanisms to 
ensure they have the psychological resources to feel hopeful, optimistic and self-efficacious. 
Adoption of a growth mind-set, learning to focus attention on the constructive not the destructive 
and understanding ones purpose is not the same as ones job were shown to improve these 
elements.  Organisations can provide information and teach these techniques, however it is up to the 
employee to choose to apply them. 
Findings that may be of interest to educators were the results from the student data. Although the 
student cohort was small, the data indicated that the same attitudes as the employees predict 
Psychological Safety and Resilience. However, there was a noticeable difference in the number of 
psychological resources deployed for students. This raises questions as to how and when the 
resources and attitudes for Psychological Safety and resilience are formed and whether they can be 
developed before entering the workplace. 
8.2 Study Limitations and Further Research 
Opportunities  
A limitation of this study is the small sample sizes. Student responses were too small on which to 
perform a robust analysis, particularly the longitudinal study and for employees, although analysis 
was possible, gaining the numbers of participants proved challenging. Focus groups were small and 
planned sessions were repeatedly cancelled as, ironically work demands were too pressing. However, 
even as a small sample, the findings provide sufficient information to develop a business case for 
future in-house organisational studies. 
The self-report nature of all the measures may have resulted in common method variance although a 
PCA suggested otherwise.  However, the extent to which the participants represented the general 
population may be a limitation: for the longitudinal study, students were public school girls and the 
employees were those selected to attend a fully funded degree program. The general questionnaires 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  264 
were randomly completed by an almost even split between male and female students and 
employees alike, although ethnicity of participants was almost entirely white. Further longitudinal 
studies that include diverse participants, data from multiple sources and a control group would add 
scientific rigour to future studies. 
Several questions still remain to be answered. 
The difference between students and employee resources levels was, although unsurprising, was an 
interesting area for future study. Where and when are psychological resources gained?  How does 
one learn the skill of cognitive flexibility? To understand this may provide insight into preventative 
measures needed for stress-resilience for both students and employees. Particularly in the context of 
an aging workforce and the skills shortage, young employees who are already enabled with the 
resources and cognitive skills to thrive will be of benefit to organisations and economies. 
An interesting area of future research is the specific working arrangements and how they influence 
psychological resources, Psychological Safety and Resilience. For example, what is the impact of 
remote or home working on levels of psychological resources? Does working from home improve 
resources or lessen them? If your boss is on a different continent, is your Psychological Safety greater 
or less than those working near her?  
The nature of the employees contractual relationship with the organisation was an aspect that was 
raised in the focus groups: what are the levels of resilience and Psychological Safety of contractors 
versus employees. What determines this? How does contracting and having a zero hour contracts 
differ and why? 
In conclusion, this study has added to the body of knowledge on Psychological Safety, Resilience and 
Psychological Capital. To date defined as a group construct, this work contributes to existing 
knowledge by enhancing our understanding of Psychological Safety as an individual construct that 
can be achieved through the provision of psychological resources. In doing so, this creates the ability 
to show and employ oneself in the workplace (Kahn, 1990). The research also indicated that 
organisations still have a role to play to create the environment in which the individual is willing to 
show and employ oneself fully at work.  
Finally, the study supports extant work on resilience as an outcome of the leveraging of psychological 
resources which can be improved through training interventions. However organisational practise 
should include a more holistic approach to the implementation of that taught in the workshop, such 
as growth mind-set, clear purpose and goals and ensuring robust mechanisms to enable employees 
to maintain and replenish their psychological resources.

Appendix B: Summary of Resource Models 
Model Creator Key Concepts 
Sense of Coherence Antonovsky (1979) 
(a) the sense that one can usually predict ones future, 
(b) the ability to derive meaning from important aspects of ones life, and  
(c) and the sense that powerful forces tend to serve ones benefit 
Not well proven though 
Personality Hardiness Kobasa (1979) 
(a) a sense of control over lifes vicissitudes,  
(b) a sense that stressors represent challenges rather 
than threats, and 
(c) a sense of commitment to life tasks. 
The Job Strain Model  
Demand  Control Model (DCM) 
Karasek, (1979, 
1998) 
Psychological strain results not from the joint effects of the demands of a work situation and 
the range of decision-making freedom (discretion). These represent work load demands, 
conflicts or other stressors and constraints. The individual's job decision latitude is the 
constraint which modulates the release of "stress into action. Thus, this is a stress-
management model of strain which is environmentally based. 
The Resource Fit Model 
French, Rodgers, & 
Cobb,(1974)   
French, Caplan & 
Van Harrison, (1982)  
Saw resources as beneficial to the extent they saw the degree of fit, or lack of fit, between 
demands and coping abilities as a determinant. Their contribution was the concept that 
resources existed within an ecological backdrop  
Cognitive Adaptation Theory Taylor (1983) 
Individuals who are able to adjust well to stressful life events are those who are high on 
optimism, self-esteem and personal control. Process of adaptation: 
1. Search for meaning in the experience 
2. Attempt to gain control of the situation in order to gain sense of mastery over life 
3. Restoring self-esteem through self-enhancing evaluations 
Mainly used in health studies (Helgeson 1999,2003) but also in org change (Wanberg and Banas 
2000 cited in Van Den Heuvel, Demerouti, Bakker and Schaufeli 2010 pp129) 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  325 
Transactional Stress Model 
Lazarus &  Folkman 
(1984) 
The state in which resources were overtaxed or lacking as creating stress, leading to 
mobilization of appraisal and coping processes. Emphasis on appraisal and coping: they 
recognised the role of peoples personal and social resources to enable this. 
SOC (Selective Optimisation with 
compensation) 
Baltes (1987) 
Baltes & Baltes, 
(1990) 
People possess resources (mental, physical, social, and environmental) that are limited at any 
specific point in time. During the life span, people face opportunities (e.g., education, 
promotion) and demands (e.g., illness and physical deterioration) that require choices about 
the allocation of these limited resources. To do so, people apply management strategies of  
(1) selecting the goals to pursue 
(2) optimizing and using goal relevant means 
(3) using compensatory means to maintain goal attainment when previously employed 
resources are no longer available or blocked.  
SOC theory has been applied to research on career success (e.g., Wiese, Freund, & Baltes, 
2002), and recently used to examine workfamily conflict and facilitation (e.g., Baltes & 
Heydens-Gahir, 
Conservation of Resources Hobfoll (1989) 
COR theory posits that people seek to obtain, retain, and protect resources and that stress 
occurs when resources are threatened with loss or lost or when individuals fail to gain 
resources after substantive resource investment. This places the acquisition and facilitation of 
resources as a central motivational construct. 
Resource loss is central to the stress experience. Resource gain, in turn, becomes 
more salient in the face of resource loss 
Resources are depicted as largely sociocultural framed rather than individual and hence most 
perceptions are seen as common among members who share a cultural niche (Hobfoll, 1988, 
1998). 
Resource caravans:  resources, or their lack, tend not to exist in isolation, but rather will 
combined  for example, individuals with high self-esteem will also possess a stronger sense of 
mastery and have better functioning social support systems (Cozzarelli, 1993; Rini et al.,., 1999).  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  326 
Holahan & Moos, 
(1991) 
Holahan, Moos, 
Holahan & Cronkite 
(1999) 
A large body of evidence supporting this. Studies over 10 years. Their findings strongly suggest 
that the contribution of resources is causal, as well as the fact that resources tend to generate 
other resources. Furthermore, their results clearly indicate that lack of resources tends to 
undermine resource stability and positive psychological outcomes. 
Effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model  Siegrist(1996) 
It refers to the reward, rather than the control structure of work. The ERI-model assumes that 
job strain is the result of an imbalance between effort (extrinsic job demands and intrinsic 
motivation to meet these demands) and reward (in terms of salary, esteem reward, and 
security/career opportunities  i.e. promotion prospects, job security and status consistency). 
The basic assumption is that a lack of reciprocity between effort and reward (i.e. high 
effort/low reward conditions) will lead to arousal and stress (cf. equity theory; Walster et al.,., 
1978), which, in turn, may lead to health risks. Thus, having a demanding, but unstable job, 
achieving at a high level without being offered any promotion prospects, are examples of a 
stressful imbalance (De Jonge et al.,., 2000). ERI-model introduces a personal component : Over 
commitment is defined as a set of attitudes, behaviours and emotions reflecting excessive 
striving in combination with a strong desire of being approved and esteemed. According to the 
model, over commitment may moderate the association between effort-reward imbalance and 
employee wellbeing. Thus, personality is expected to be able to further qualify the interaction 
between effort and reward.

Subject: PsyCap Questions 
Dear Dr Luthans 
Firstly, thank you for your work on positive psychology and in particular PsyCap. It is 
beginning to form the basis of my PhD study, particularly how PsyCap applies in 
todays "VUCA" organisations. Specifically I am looking at how it may (or may not) 
contribute to an employee's sense of Psychological Safety, given that we can no 
longer rely on organisations to provide us with traditional mechanisms of safety. 
 I would like to ask two questions in relation decisions about the questions in your 
PCQ if I may. 
1. Six questions were selected from Wagnild and Youngs Resilience questionnaire by

2. I note when measuring Self -Efficacy, the questions begin with "I feel 
by  yourself and Stajkovic seem to use self-efficacy and confidence interchangeable. I 
would argue that a questions such as "I feel confident contributing to discussions 
about the companys strategy" or "I feel confident contacting people outside the 
company (e.g., suppliers, customers) to discuss problems" may have the answer "no" 
but would not necessarily mean they feel any less able to do their job. Were these 
questions designed with specific roles in mind? 
I would appreciate any clarity you can provide me on these questions. 
Many thanks for your time.

Resilience and recovery are discrete and empirically separable outcome trajectories following 
a dramatic event such as the death of a spouse. In contrast, resilience is characterized by 
relatively mild and short-lived disruptions and a stable trajectory of healthy functioning across 
time. 
Carver 1998 
Carver distinguished between resilience and thriving, defining the former as a homeostatic 
return to earlier levels of functioning. Thriving, however, is more than recovery of homeostatic 
maintenanceit is being better off after the traumatic experience. The person who 
experiences thriving comes to function at a continuing higher level than was the case before 
adverse event

Cicchetti  1997 
Resilience has been conceptualized as the individuals capacity for adapting successfully and 
functioning competently despite experiencing chronic stress or adversity, or following 
exposure to prolonged or severe trauma (Cicchetti& Garmezy, 1993; Luthar, 1993; Masten, 
Best, & Garmezy, 1990; Rutter, 1987).

The theoretical definition of resilience is one's ability to bounce back or recover from 
adversity. It is a dynamic process that can be influenced by the environment, external factors, 
and/or the individual and the outcome. 
Garmezy,  1991  
Resilience provides metaphorically the dictionary definition of the properties in the emergent 
area of research: the tendency to rebound or recoil, to spring back, the power of 
recovery.  
 "the capacity for recovery and maintained adaptive behavior that may follow initial retreat or 
incapacity upon initiating a stressful event"  
Gordon  1995 
Resilience is the ability to thrive, mature and increase in competence in the face of adverse 
circumstances To thrive, mature and increase competence a person must draw upon all of 
his or her resources: biological, psychological and environmental  
Glantz  2002 
Resilience defined as the process of, capacity for or outcome of successful adaptation despite 
challenging or threatening circumstances  (Masten, Best and Garmezy, 1990 pp 426)  
Luthans 2002 
in simple, but accurate terms, resiliency is the psychological capacity to rebound, to 'bounce 
back' from adversity, uncertainty, conflict, failure or even positive change, progress and 
increased responsibility (pp702). 
Luthar et 
Resilience refers to a dynamic process encompassing positive adaptation within the context of 
significant adversity   
Masten & 
Wright 
 Human resilience refers to the processes or patterns of positive adaptation and development 
in the context of significant threats to an individuals life or function.  
Masten 2001 
Resilience appears to be a common phenomenon that results in most cases from the operation 
of basic human adaptational systems. (pp227)

threats to adaptation or development pp228). 
Masten

Garmezy 
Resilience refers to the process of, capacity for, or outcome of successful adaptation despite 
challenging or threatening circumstances. Psychological resilience is concerned with behavioral 
adaptation, usually defined in terms of internal states of well-being or effective functioning in 
the environment or both.

Psychological resilience refers to the process of coping with or overcoming exposure to 
adversity or stress.  
Naswall et 
Employee capability, facilitated and supported by the organisation, to utilize resources to 
continually adapt and flourish at work, even if/when faced with challenging circumstances.   
Rutter 
resilience can be defined as reduced vulnerability to environmental risk experiences, the 
overcoming of a stress or adversity, or a relatively good outcome despite risk experiences  
For Rutter (1987), resilience describes "the positive pole of individual differences in people's 
response to stress and adversity" (p. 316).

Appendix G: Role of Attentional Control in Anxiety- A Summary of Studies 
Authors, Date Summary Comments 
Cisler. & Koster (2010) 1. Facilitated Attention (Attention drawn to threat) 
2. Difficulty in Disengaging 
(Threat captures attention thereby impairs switching attention away) 
3. Attention Avoidance 
Emotional regulation strategy that directs attention away from threat. 
Beck, Emery & 
Greenberg (1985) 
1. Automatic Threat Registration (Orientation model) 
2. Primal threat mode (Automatic and strategic schema processing. Also stimulus 
appraisal) 
3. Secondary Elaboration (Effortful reappraisal of stimulus, context and personal 
resources) 
Anxiety is due to poor effortful 
processesing. Verbal mediation 
interventions promote more 
constructive cognitive modes 
Williams et al., 
1988/97 
1. Affective decision mechanism (automatic assessment of threat) 
2. Resource Allocation mechanisms (determines attentional focus  towards vs away) 
3. Task Related Effort (override of AB by focusing more on a task) 
But as valence of threat stimulis 
increases, less likey to be able to 
focus on task. 
Ohman, 1993/4 1. Stimulus Analysis: (automatic, subconscious) 
a. Feature detector  biologically fear relevant stimuli (spiders etc) 
b. Significance evaluator  influenced by expectancy system 
(memories/experiences). Also activated by arousal system. Expectancy + 
Arousal = conscious perception system 
Work on Automatic detection 
processes have been influential. 
Wells & Matthews

Self Regulatory Executive Function (S-REF)

1. Low level automatic processing 
2. Controlled processing (conscious appraisal and attention control)(S-REF)

Authors, Date Summary Comments 
Eysenck (1997) Four sources of information contribute to anxiety: 
1. External Stimuli 
2. Physiological activity 
3. Behaviour action tendencies 
4. Cognitions (e.g.worries) 
Anxiety differences are a result of 
attention and interpretation biases 
which are guided by schema.  
Mogg & Bradley 
(1998) 
Anxiety vulnerability is not from direction of AB but from bias in automatic threat 
evaluation.  
1.Valence evaluation system (automatically evaluates value of threat) 
2. Goal Engagement System (in the absence of threat focuses on goal relevant stimuli 
3. Vigilance-Avoidance (a controlled attention strategy to reduce discomfort or danger). 
Note this may also result in maintenance of attention on negative information in depression 
(Bradley, Mogg & Lee, 1997). 
model proposes that attention is 
automatically directed to 
stimuli that are evaluated as having 
high subjective threat salience for 
the individual, and it differs from 
Williams et al.,.'s (1997) model in 
predicting that both high and low 
anxious individuals show greater 
attention to highly salient threat 
than mild threat stimuli 
Derryberry & 
Rothebert 1997 / 
Lonigan, Vasey, Phillip 
and Hazen, 2004 
Effortful control is a trait which depends on attention and inhibitory control processes that 
support effortful regulation of emotional and motivational functions but allowing individuals 
to allocate attention flexibility, decrease attention to negative cues and increase attention 
to positive cues. 
BUT conditions have to be right to allow and enable attentional control 
Matthews & 
MacKintosh, 1998 
High level threats will impact both high and low anxious individuals. 
Anxiety can sometimes be suppress AB by task-related effort. 
Task and threat stimuli are competing for processing resources, The ability, particularly 
under stress etc to refocus efforts onto task will reduce threat 
Symptoms of anxiety may be due to failure to suppress AB 
Like Williams model.

3. Disengagement (anxiety associated with increased attentional dwelling on threats) threat rather than dwelling on it 
(Yiend et al., 2015). 
Eysenck, Derakshan, 
Santos, & Calvo, 2007 
Attentional Control Theory: 
Anxiety increases attention to threat and impairs attentional control 
Core Executive Functions: (Miyake et al., 2000) 
1. Inhibition 
2. Shifting (task switching) 
3. Updating  
But Anxiety strengthens stimulus driven attention system which reacts to threat 
Impairs goal directional attentional system which controls inhibition and switching. 
Suggest poor attentional control makes it difficult to disengage from task irrelevant threats. 
Also may result in working memory storing ask-irrelevant information (Stout, Shackman, & 
Larson, 2013; Stout, Shackman, Johnson, & Larson, 2015) 
Bar-Haim et al., 2007 Anxiety is a result of impairement oin one or more of the following: 
1. Preattentive threat evaluation (may overestimate threat value) 
2. Initial Resource Allocation system (may be oversensitive and therefore interrupts 
ongoing activity to alert of a threat 
3. Guided Threat Evaluation System (analyses stimulus, experience, coping resources) 
4. Override mechanism (system that reappraises threat as a low threat) 
Cilser & Koster, 2010) 1. Facilitated Attention (Attention drawn to threat - orienting) 
2. Difficulty in Engaging (depending on how the threat has captured the stimulus and 
extent to which switching has been impaired) 
3. Attention Avoidance (emotional regulation strategy)

Working as we do for a fast moving technology company, you will no doubt agree that things are 
constantly changing  and fast. Known as the VUCA environment, meaning Volatile, Uncertain, 
Complex and Ambiguous, organisations such as ours are increasingly having to move quickly into new 
and unchartered territories as technology and markets change. 
This being a relatively modern day phenomenon, there has been little research into understanding 
how working in such an environment impacts employees mental health and wellbeing. 
We have an opportunity to contribute to the latest research into how this fast moving, ever changing 
environment impacts our psychological health and wellbeing by actually being part of the research. 
In collaboration with the University of Reading, we are running two focus group sessions here at 
Pannell House for which we are looking for volunteers. 
The sessions will be approximately 2 hours, run over lunchtimes (lunch will be provided), during 
which PhD student Sam Mather will be asking you to share your thoughts and discuss what resources 
you feel you need to feel psychologically safe at work.  
The focus groups have been approved by the Reading Research Ethics committee and as such all 
information provided will be confidential and coded therefore maintaining anonymity. 
Please feel free to volunteer to attend a lunchtime focus group. To do so, simply click on the link

Appendix O: Focus Group Debrief Letter 
Thank you for your attendance at the research focus group today. I hope you found the 
discussion interesting and engaging. 
The purpose of this focus group was to help inform further research on how organisations can 
increase employee psychological safety, which has been shown to improve individuals 
performance and engagement. Past research was carried out on teams in stable organisations 
with traditional structures. We are revisiting the research to look at whether traditional means 
of creating Psychological Safety can still be relied upon in the context of fast moving knowledge 
based organisations operating in VUCA environments and the extent that the individuals 
personal resources plays in contributing to Psychological Safety.  
The model that the discussion and questionnaire was based upon was that of Kahns 
Psychological Dimensions for engagement. Should you wish to read more about Kahns work, 
there are three seminal papers: 
 Psychological conditions of personal engagement and disengagement at work Kahn 
 Psychological Safety and Learning Behavior in Work Teams - Edmondson, A. (1999).  
 The Psychological conditions of meaningfulness, safety and availability and the 
engagement of the human spirit at work - May, Gilson and Harter 2004.  
The process now is that the recordings from all focus groups across all organisations researched, 
will be transcribed and any reference to names or people will be removed and replaced with 
initials or job title. The recording will then be destroyed.  The outputs from the focus groups will 
be summarised and analysed to identify the findings and the direction of future research. From 
this a report will be produced. 
If you wish to have a copy of the report and/or would be willing to participate in any further 
research, please do contact me on s.a.mather@pgr.reading.ac.uk 
Once again, thank you for your valuable time, I really do appreciate it.

Focus Group 1  Non Managers 
FOCUS GROUP NON MANAGER TRANSCRIPT 
21st November 2017 
Participants: 5 
F Ok,  just a little erm.. bit of an introduction about me, I am Sam Mather,erm.. I 
have for the last twenty-something years I have been erm working in blue chip 
organisations primarily technology, erm across the world, and erm last year 
I decided to err fulfil a lifelong ambition and study a PhD at the university of 
Reading. Umm.. I am based in the Psychology department but I also have a 
supervisor who is based in Henley Business School because I am looking at 
Psychology in the context of organisations. I am not looking to become a 
clinical psychologist, and nor am I ok, so I wont be asking you to tell me about 
your childhood. I wont be going that route. Youll have my contact details if 
there is anything that you want to follow up with. 
F So as I said you will be known as participants erm. 1 to whatever, so  umm  
errr,, I am handing out err a little participant pack that we will be going 
through cos the first thing I would like you to do, is complete,  there are two 
questionnaires in there  a demographic questionnaire and a work 
questionnaire. I just want you to take a few minutes before we start the 
discussion to complete those questionnaires. 
P? Question asked about handouts 4.27 
F Yeah, its just the two sheets, we will be using this one for something else in a 
moment 
P2 This one?  
F And there should be a demographic questionnaire as well  5.39 
P2 Oh yeah.  
F So its one work and one democratic, err democraticdemonGRAPHIC 
questionnaire, and thats just 2 sides of A4 and thats it. The rest well be 
playing with now. 
P2 Theres no option in between yes and no 5.53 
F Yeah, deliberately so, yeah. Most of the time. Most of the time. 5.58 
P2 Can we leave it  
P# = Participant number 
F = Facilitator 
PS =Psychological Safety 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  361 
F You can leave it, yeah. You dont have to complete or do anything. If you cant 
decide you can leave it. 
F OK. Well thank you for completing that, they are, emm..and  I did them 
deliberately before we start talking about this so there was no influence or 
bias. 
So the discussion today erm.. is going to be erm.in the format of a focus 
group. Now the purpose of a focus group is really just about collecting data, its 
not about its not about coming to consensus, its not about to make any 
decisions and it doesnt matter if you guys disagree with each other, it doesnt 
matter, its just collecting data, different datas. As I said before, all your 
responses will be anonymised and coded so you can say what you like. I will be 
putting some stuff on the flip..on the whiteboard, Ill be photographing it for 
my purposes and then Ill be getting rid of itcovering my tracks. 
 So the discussion today is around a topic called Psychological Safety. OK, so 
what do I mean by PS? Well its defined erm by Kahn erm who first came up 
with this as being willing and able to show your true self and, and speak out 
without fear of any negative consequences to your, to yourself, to your image, 
to your status or your career. Thats how its defined as. 
Do you feel you can be yourself? Do you feel that you can say whats on your 
mind without any fear of repercussion?  
Its also how you view the environment. Do you feel that the environment is 
conducive to, to saying something which might be contrary to whats been.. 
what the discussion is. How comfortable do you feel that environment is? 
And its how, the extent to which you can take interpersonal risks, emotional 
risks really. With talking to your colleagues and the people around you without 
any negative repercussions. So thats the definition of PS. Errmm and up until 
now, most of the research has been done within the context of a team. What 
Im looking at is very much around what does it mean for an individual because 
teams are kind of a loose concept these days. 
F Edmondson picked it up much later to look at errmm how safe you feel to low 
and grun.low and grungrow and learn errm and errm within this crazy 
rapid, rapidly changing world. 
Any questions about what, the definitions on PS? 
F So..todays discussion, so given this VUCA, youve heard term VUCA, Volatile, 
Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous, its a US military term thats been adopted 
by organisations to describe the craziness that is going on particularly in the 
technology industry. Things are changing, technology is moving very quickly 
and as a result, we have to change and we have to flex. The question is, how PS 
do you feel? 
F So what I would like you to do, there are some felt-tip pens around the room 
Id like you to write a number on this,  in this square box to say how 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  362 
Psychological safe do you feel in the environment in which you are working. Is 
it a 1, is it a 2, is it a 6 is it a 7. If you could write it on that sheet of paper for 
me. And theres pens there.  
P2 Can you go back to the definition?  
F Yes of course. I have gone backthere we go.theres a lag. 10.02 
P4 My feeling is that safety, in my world, that number can change depending on 
whats happening and .. 
10.16 
F Uh huh  
P4 what you are doing. If you are with  
F Uh huh   
P4 a new client and theres high expectations, then that safety wont be there if 
its something you have done before, and youve got some exposure to and 
experience that safety is going to be higher 
F Yeah  
P3 The other interesting thing is of course is that there is a very significant 
variation on safety depending on the relations between individuals so it might 
be for instance that very characteristically you might have, you might have 
terribly bad psychological relations in your team but very good ones with your 
manager, or visa versa or it might be that you feel psychologically safe around 
most of your team members except this one member who you dont trust as 
far as you can throw him, 
10.38 
F Yeah, yeah. Absolutely and youre, youre exactly right. Those are the things, it 
it is a fluid, it is a fluid erm concept. So let me build on that then before you 
write your numbers down. Let me build on that and say then what is it that 
determines whether you feel psychologically safe? Or whether you dont. What 
are the elements, if it is, if it is situational, what are the elements in that 
situation that make you feel safe or slash unsafe? 
11.05 
 silence 11.36 
F It might be easier to say what would make you feel unsafe, look at it that way. 12.00 
P3 Umm obvious ones are power dynamicsit, you, know,  could be that, you 
know,  is what I am going to say gonna be a career limiting move. 
12.07 
F But why would it be a career limiting move, in the sense of what, what is it 
about the manager that would make you think this might impact my career? 
P3 Ummm..the degree of .. combination of degree of effectiveness,  to what 
degree they are authoritarian, i.e.to what degree they want to control the way 
something goes 
12.23 
F Uh huh  
P3  theres the degree to which they tolerate disagreement and That can make a 
difference. Umm other aspects are the degree of sensitivity, if I am going to say 
what I am going to say, how, would, would it be perceived as insensitive, erm 
would it be perceived as ummmas inappropriate or umm potentially offensive 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  363 
to the person I am saying it to. That you are making a value judgement about 
them is what you are saying. 
F Uh huh. In their view? 13.00 
P3 Yes  
F Ok, so its very much, what, what I am hearing you say is whether you feel safe 
or not is very much dependant on the person that you are talking to 
13.01 
P3 Yes  
F OK, any other thoughts  
P4 I think thats.I thinks thats an xxxxxxx.personally one to one level. 
Ermm I am thinking more along the lines of being exposed to the clients. You 
know, your confidence in front of erm a blue chip client as opposed to a smaller 
client who you can baffle more that you cant with the bigger ones. That would, 
that would change your safety.  
13.20 
P3 Yes, thats true about clients.but I, I do find clients quite easy to deal with 
because of the fact that basically any any dealing with a client effectively 
requires you to adopt a particular persona anyway. Effectively theres a whole, 
you know,  in a sense, because of the fact that you not representing yourself in 
front of a client, you are representing the company. Lets just say its relatively 
straightforward to adopt a company related persona which means that I am 
now representing <company name>. Of course there is possibly a certain 
psychological danger in that because you might feel erm that your erm that 
there is a certain conflict. For instance you would like to be able to tell a 
customer, no seriously you cant do this but the sales guys is telling them 
something completely different. And youre not sitting in a position where you 
dont want to be disagreeing in front of a customer but your probably gonna 
have to take them to the side afterwards and kind of clarify that what you have 
just proposed really is not going to work. 
13.40 
F But is that persona not the same whether its a large blue chip company or a 
smaller one? 
P3 No, of course not, you might be, depending on the relationship you have with 
the customer, you might need to adopt different personas. You might have a 
slightly friendlier less aggressive persona in some environments, and in other 
environments, you have to be very you know, if you have a customer who is 
renowned for the fact that they throw lawyers at everybody, just on first 
principles  you tend to adopt one that is more formal, more restrained you try 
to avoid making too many direct statements of fact, that might be used err  
context, out of context at a future, err  future stage, try to be woolly, try to be 
definite but only on things that you are actually certain of.  
14.39 
F So, so when differentiating, to go back to your point, when differentiating 
between some clients that you feel safe with and some that dont, I am hearing 
risk is one element. What other.. 
15.14 
P4 Youre definitely right. You gotta have a risk. You gotta be concerned that you 
may say something negative that wasnt intended to be negative or might be 
construed as negative. I think sometimes you may get exposed to a lot of 
technical people and therefore if youre not a technical person that might 
15.26 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  364 
become a bit daunting or where do you engage with the technical people is it 
honest, is it OK to be honest and say thats, that maybe I dont understand. 
Thats sort of thing is about safety. 
F And how does, if I then extrapolate that then back to the workplace within 
(company name>,then, errm  I mean youve raised a couple of things here 
around the person you need to be, the level of risk and your, your your 
capability, your technical ability, are they not elements that also would raise 
your level of PS in the workplace? And if not, why not? 
P4 I dunno..yeah, I see thats the same. I suppose when you refer to client it 
could be outside client, could be an internal client  
16.28 
F True  
P4  you know. So the same, you gonna identify the same risks at errm gains .?? 
And I think youll find it depends on where you work If youre working in xxxx 
and somebody in that group knows your capabilities, or whatever, when you 
take them out of that and expose them to somebody else within the 
organisation then there might be a little bit of uncertainty there.  
16.35 
F So its almost,  its not so  
P4 You gotta gauge the situation, You gotta gauge the situation, I think gauge the 
situation and then you will have an idea of what your level of psychological 
safety level is for that, whether you withdraw or you step forward. 
17.07 
F So what do you use to gauge that situation? What measures are you using in 
yourself  saying, weighing it up whether it is a safe or not safe situation. What 
what sort of things do you use?  
P1 Intuitive judgement based on experience I think.  17.37 
F So there is a piece about experience  
P1 Yeah, you get the measure of people and thats, thats something thats learned 
over time. You see behaviours exhibited in the past and one behaviour,  
somebody who exhibits a behaviour one behaviour, tends to exhibit other 
behaviours so if you see one behaviour happening, you know can expect the 
other behaviours to  happen at some point and that will inform your level of, I 
suppose trust in them to be a straight dealer. 
17.42 
F OK, any other thoughts on that? 18.15 
P5 I was going to say a bit of familiarity. So you know if you are familiar with the 
situation, you know, something you have been in before, it probably comes 
back to experience. And also a little bit like the mood of the day, you know, 
people you are dealing with, like, body language you know, people have 
different moods every day, you know, people have a bad day which will 
probably influence my psychological safety in terms of you know bringing up 
something tricky or 
18.17 
F So what about, what about where your erm team is perhaps remote. How do, I 
mean, how do you get familiarity, know what their mood is or whatever. I 
mean, how safe do you feel with your remote teams, with the guys in America 
or wherever it is that you work.  
F4  Tone of voice I suppose 19.09 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  365 
F Tone of voice  
P4 Hesitancy to speak, or rather speak too much, says the man who is talking a lot 
<laughter> 
F Thats fine.its fine  
P1 It takes longer with a remote team erm  
P3 You dont get the feedback that your get from body language, facial 
expressions and so on and so forth. Even on video conference its actually 
pretty limited and you dont, you know, you know just the way somebody 
moves into a room you can tell whether theyre in a good mood, you know,  or 
whether they are feeling stressed or whatever, whereas you dont get a lot of 
that, you dont get a lot of that cue when you are dealing remotely and even 
less so if you mainly communicate with them via email because it really 
depends on the ability, the ability to communicate with email depends on on 
how good the other person is at writing or how good they are at expressing 
themselves. And errEven IM wouldnt give youits much more informal, so 
dependent on structure you dont necessarily get a feel for how theyre 
reacting, so in a sense you are dealing with a much blanker, blinder 
environment Sorry Tom I interrupted you.. 
19.28 
P1 No, no no, I agree. When I have worked for remote teams its been much, much 
more emotionally distant with those people erm its a very dry, cold 
professional interaction as obviously Ive never met them before so then 
theres more caution, err you dont,  it takes time and presence to build that 
rapport that allows you to feel safer and therefore more unguarded.  
20.21 
F OK, so one of, one of the key requirements for PS then is almost a familiar and 
personal connection. 
20.52 
P3 Yes having the personal familiarity or having the personal relationship 
whatever, whatever form with that individual, knowing them individually, 
knowing things about them, erm and having regular experience of what they 
are like is really really important for most people, I think for most people, 
psychological safety because otherwise your effectively the people you 
are working who is a  stranger and you cant necessarily predict their reactions 
in every circumstance. 
21.07 
F No, no, its about, so thats an interesting point as well, its about predicting 
their reactions. Ummthe unpredictabledont let me put words in your 
mouth but therefore the unpredictable equals possible unsafe 
21.34 
P3  Well, yes, err theres a, theres an element.It depends on the nature you 
know, you know someone who a bit of a artistic maverick or whatever, they 
might have unpredicatable reactions but they tend to be in a certain category 
or about a certain thing, whereas what you are worried about really more is 
personal volatility you know, you dont know what to expect, you dont know 
for instance is this person going to be helpful would they, would they prefer 
not to be helpful, ummm yeah. Are they, are they deliberately going to make 
things difficult because you are asking them to do something ummm you know 
the classic, I think, you know,  in terms of unpredicatablity, one of the things 
umm you know, you know in terms of often there could be cultural 
boundaries. 
21.55 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  366 
F Yeah  
P3 The classic example in my experience.many years ago I worked with an 
outsourced team in  Russia ermm they were very good, they were excellent 
engineers but they were used to a typical Russian culture were basically they 
were you know, as long as you did what the boss said, everything was fine and 
it took me a while to get them used to the idea that I actually wanted them to 
do things independently and tell me about it and I wouldnt judge them if I 
thought the decision was wrong but anyone else could correct it and it took 
quite a while to get the level of trust. Initially they would just do exactly as I 
said and I eventuallyl I had to explain to them that sometimes I am perfectly 
open to interpretation and always doing exactly what the boss said is not 
necessarily the right approach here.  
22.38 
F So I am hearing trust coming through, errrm but there are different levels of 
trust.  So, umm, theres the trust which is  I trust my manager is going to do 
the best for me and, and the, the there doesnt necessarily need to be a 
personalbility or a likeability, you dont need to go for a beer with them. Or do 
you need that emotional trust, that emotional connection, or can you do it at 
professional level? Do you see what I mean, there are two different levels  
theres one hes my boss, and thats his role and thats what I do I and trust 
him to do that or is it more of a heart thing? 
23.21 
P3 Umm its not necessarilyfor me its not a heart thing. One of the worst bosses I 
ever had was somebody I was actually quite good friends with ummthat was 
actually very challenging because essentially the friendship came into conflict 
with the relationship, with the professional relationship, erm and err the other 
situation that I can think of in that respect is thats its often, obviously if you 
have no personal relationship with that person erm it can be more difficult but 
erm its, its actually  more about demonstrated behaviours a lot of the time 
than about the degree of emotional connection, of course if you dont have a 
great deal of emotional connection with that person, it might not be a big 
problem provided their behaviours have been consistently fair or professional 
towards you 
24.11 
F Uu huh,. Uh huh 25.00 
P3  but if for instance, the reason that there, if you can tell that the reason they 
are adopting this professional behaviour towards you is because they actually 
really really dont like you, and dont wanna.  they are being professional 
because they have to be professional, eventually, obviously xxxxxxxxx most 
people can get clued in eventually as to whether somebody really dislikes them 
or not and its you know, that will be quite off putting, if you have somebody 
that, you know, is very very professional but at the same time you can tell if 
theres a manifest dislike or no relationship at all ummmm but at the same time 
its probably sufficient in some cases provided you dont have a significant 
negative impression for them to treat you professionally in some ways thats 
easier than if you have a very close and heartfelt relationship certainly from a 
work perspective. I heard of businesses where everyone turns up and they are 
all friends but when that goes wrong, it tends to go wrong much worse than if 
you have a professional relationship in the first place and you are reasonably 
friendly otherwise.   
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  367 
<unintelligible>  
You dont have to be friends with someone  to respect them 
25.54 
P4 Just have to trust them  
F You dont actually have to like them to respect actually as long as you respect 
what they do 
P3 As long the situations with a friendship can get in the way of a professional 
decision, lets face it, it really depends on the situation 
F OK, Any other thoughts on this from any other..  
P1  Weve talked about trust weve not particularly expanded on what that trust 
means..and  and for me it seems that the more you show of yourself the 
more knowledge you give somebody else of yourself, and youve got the old 
xxxx about knowledge being power, trust is about what they then do with that 
power.Whether its used against you, that, that would be a negative in related 
to trust. If it was used to your benefit that would foster trust, even if its used 
neutrally, so some of the things you say might be discarded for your own good 
almost  intemperate things you might say to somebody you trust, that person 
has earned trust because they wont repeat those intemperate things, they 
wont use them against you, they will just file those things as  oh its just that 
person being that person so it. It, it I think for me, part of it is how they use 
the knowledge they gained about you.  
26.31 
F Yeah, because there is a piece about being willing to share yourself 27.30 
P1 Yeah  
F OK. What about able? Able to show and employ yourself. What do you need to 
be able to do that? Is that the same, is that different? 
P3 Well you need to have some sort of idea of what you want to show, in some 
ways, you know.  Some people arent terribly sure, you know, terribly sure of 
who they want to be and they find it very difficult to do that. Otherwise, some 
people arent very extroverted, some people have difficulties with 
interpersonal communications they dont find it easy to, you know, 
independently of who the, who the person is that they are with,  there is 
definitely an ability on how emotionally alert somebody is, how good they are 
at reading other peoples body language, gestures,  faces ummm there is a lot 
of the things, the able is also again, the ability for instance, of remote teams, 
there is a big ability thing, you cant really show how.my classic reaction was 
you know, some people simply dont have that mechanism for reading, ummm 
arent terribly good at reading umm emotional engagement out of your voice.  
And its really quite interesting, I remember getting, I remember I was really 
really annoyed, really annoyed about something, a colleague of mine asked me 
if I was stressed and I responded to him rather intemperately along the lines of 
AM I STRESSED?? sort of kind of along those lines and for whatever reason he 
just didnt pick up on it you know, I was being too flat toned or something, but 
it was just funny. At the time I was quite upset with him because of course I 
was stressed, but ummm in retrospect it was funny because it was a completely 
neutral reaction to something that should have obviously kind of triggered a 
27.58 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  368 
ping you know.Dirk is obviously on the warpath today,  Ill leave him alone. 
Ermmm. But it was one of those classic examples of dont assume people can 
read your tone, or read you know,  read anything you dont make explicit. And 
its of course  even worse with remote people if youre trying to talk on the 
telephone,  you lose  a lot of emotional register that goes and that means if it is 
very very hard to read. Also people tend to adopt a telephone voice  a 
particular voice or particular turn of phrase that they use in that sort of 
environment, and you cant necessarily read what the emotional content that 
Certainly that sort of thing, the modus effects the ability, and also you know, 
peoples personal development and conditions, you know it might be easier to 
communicate ability,  it can be cultural difference, cultural differences in 
different groups,  differences in shared experience, shared experiences are 
really really important, but if you dont know very much about the kind of 
experiences the other person has had or you cant really relate to any of them, 
then its quite difficult to communicate with them because you cant 
necessarily, you cant identify the emotions that are related to that experience, 
especially if the experiences are more unusual or more out of line. 
F Uh huh 30.49 
P3 The classic example of that is again, sort of  I guess I call best or worst 
managers, some of,  like some of the best managers I have had are ex MOD, 
some of the worst managers I have had are also ex MOD so it seems to me 
that army training, I get this really weird impression that the army seems to 
partition people into two groups where one of them was that they are actually 
very good people managers and the other group was absolutely abysmal, you 
didt seem to get anything in between and I dont know whe ther that is a 
universal experience or whether thats something that army training produced 
that effectively the people who were the ex-army people who are useless 
obviously rely very heavily, rely very heavily only on line authority to get things 
done and relied on the competence of juniors to make sure they do do things 
P4  Yeah, it depends on the skills of the person really cos from my experience, like I 
say, people with military experience, some have been fantastic and some have 
been poor. The fantastic ones are the ones who can adapt and change very 
quickly in the environment. 
31.34 
F Right  
P4 The ones who simply can follow the rules, can simply follow rules and possibly 
shouldnt  be in that position to. 
P3 Yeah  
F So how do they, I mean the adapting and changing is kinda critical in this 
environment to be able to turn around, adapt and change 
32.00 
P4 Yeah  
F .. so what do they need to give you, these good managers, what do they need 
to give you, to make you willing to adapt and change without feeling unsafe, 
nervous, scared, threatened etc etc 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  369 
P4 I think it goes back to what Dirk was saying about colleagues in Russia, I think if 
you micro-manage people you are not gonna get anything from them. if you 
are encouraging, have the participation conversations or with a  view of what 
they are doing without negative..youve gotta do reviews, you know you got 
to look at the negatives and the positives in order to get better at something 
but it cant be negative feedback its got to be a critique of something. This was 
good, this wasnt good that needs improving. Everybody wants a constructive, 
if you just say to somebody that doesnt work there is only so far you can kick 
somebody up the backside before they stop taking it. And that, that behaviour, 
I think is micro-managing and thats probably the worst, certainly in this 
industry its changing, we need people to think. We want them thinking all the 
time. 
32.21 
F Now, youre,  youre right about we need people to think, we need to be able 
to, to get the most out of people in this innovative and, and driven 
environment. Errm, I mean how easy is it to do that if you are feeling unsafe?  
33.12 
P4 Yeah, very  hard  I would have thought  
P2 You can do whatever you want to get things doneits working  
F Yeah, so that individuals should do it that way.  
P4 Yes, umm I think its also probably  to do with erm I suppose its also to do with 
to what degree you are dependent on the , on the err esteem of your 
managers, your peers because if you are an incredible self-confident person, 
that can kind of go two ways, on one side it can mean ermm that you are just 
gonna do what you are gonna do  and errm if it goes well you will probably get 
a great deal of praise and people will be impressed with you and err but the 
disadvantages of course that if you are very very self-confident but dont 
actually have a great deal of ability to back it up,  you can be an extraordinary 
nuisance to everyone else because you basically dont make decisions on their 
behalf that are,   that would make their life very very difficult.  Ummm, and err, 
its an interesting one because of course an absence of self-esteem can have 
two consequences, one of them is inability to, you know inability to listen to 
criticism, because somebody you know, somebody with too much self-
confidence might ignore criticism but somebody with too little might actually 
treat every possible criticism, you know professional criticism, might treat it as  
personal, tend to take any kind of criticism personally and be very very, you 
know,  it might be very very difficult, you know, it might be very very difficult 
not to be very intrusive very round-about in suggesting how they should 
change something that they do because you might actually hurt their feelings 
more than you actually manager to correct what they are doing. 
F Hmmmm hmmmm 35.15 
P3 Thats a classic oneyeah, um.  
F Tom?  
P1 On the trusting for me its a better manager being a person of their word. If they 
say they will do something, if they say a position is protected, holding to that. If 
they offered a defence if you like to hold to it. 
35.21 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  370 
Ermm on the word able, you talk then about being different teams being able 
to read ermm your persona, but thats about them receiving transmitted 
information for me the word able is about the ability to transmit the 
information. How able are you to project yourself 
F Uh huh  
P1 .and the word able there, well the opposite, inable implies paralysis, that the 
situation is very hostile  for me to be inable, incapable of expressing your self, 
implies a very harsh paralysis, would be low the very low end of that scale, one, 
two. 
F Yeah  
P1 ..ummm, to be to be able to be yourself implies that is not so oppressive that 
you can exhibit your own characteristics, you might not necessarily feel safe in 
doing so, you just dont feel so completely cowed by the situation that you 
withdraw totally. 
F Ya. I mean I think this is, so all this is err, I think this is great stuff and you are 
absolutely right, I think theres my question would be, if we looked at these 
sorts of things, the ones above there,  whose responsibility is it to provide 
safety through these things? 
(whispercan I just have a different coloured pen please,  thanks) 
Whose responsibility for example about to, about the management style, and 
about the risk, and the trust and the familiarfamil..famili.this one, and EQ, 
the emotionalI mean whos responsibility is itthe organisation,  is it the team 
, is it your manager, is it youwhos responsible for that? 
36.32 
P2 Collective responsibility . 37.25 
F Bit of everything.  
P1 But it cascades  
P5 Culture..suppliers as well.  
P3 Theres two elements. Theres the one, the interpersonal one you know. If you 
work with a bunch of people who know to be untrustworthy, its obviously 
never going to you know, its going to be very difficult, but for instance there 
may be very different relations within a team than outside of that team. You 
also get a lot of team competitions in some companies where, you know, 
organisation x is really, errr I used to work many years ago, many years ago I 
used to work for Nortel and I used to say that Nortel, the greatest problem I 
ever perceived with Nortel was that you were far too busy actually fighting off 
the internal competition for products that you didnt really have any time to 
react to what the customer wants. 
37.29 
F Yeah, yeah Ive heard that before, I mean Ive come from an organisation 
exactly like that. 
P3  Its not completely accurate, it was an exaggeration, but there were definitely 
elements of that 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  371 
F ..but you felt like that.  
P3 It was umm you know, and sometimes you kind of see this kind of silo-ing, 
where xxxx here but this, this err, This lack of trust within different.you might 
trust everybody within your organisation, within your part of the organisation,  
but those guys over there, thats a shifty bunch of bastards. What are you going 
to do 
P4 Can I just say, does Psychological Safety change with the size of the 
organisation and the maturity of the organisation? As a smaller organisation 
where there are less people were interacting with one another on a daily 
basis..as the organisation gets bigger, you are going through different 
transitions, you are going find different problems. When you get to the big 
conglomerates, then, then theres gonna be infighting you know,  somebodys 
been promoted ahead, for whatever reason, youre gonna have that, youre 
gonna have that competition. Its very easy to say well it needs to come from 
the top down, traditionally systems are all hierarchical where you, you, the 
decision comes from the top and you push it down.. 
38.37 
P3 Yeah but that kind of  conflict in a larger organisation little else than top down  
P4 Its trying to push it down the system, its very difficult to get an idea and then 
force it back the other way. In development environments, seeing things 
differently where there is a flat line structure where you have these technical 
heads and they may not be involved in writing the code  but they very much 
understand what needs to be done and therefore there is an open environment 
to discuss 
F And thats why I am really interested in technological environments, because as 
technology moves on, it used to be the old way where the managers were the 
boss and they knew more because they had been here longer and they knew 
everything and youd go to the manager and the manager would tell you what 
to do. Doesnt work like that anymore. Now a manager manages people who 
are, who are, you know, propeller heads, they know all these things, more than 
they do and its about collaborating and bringing them together 
39.50 
P4 Cos we are getting more and more information and being given more and more 
information and there is stuff available whether it be online xxx, xxx,xxx you 
are constantly being reminded of something all the time so you are trying to 
keep abreast, and thats quite difficult even for an organisation thats quite well 
structured,  for the top to be abreast of everything xxxxx make decisions 
????????????????????? 
40.14 
F Yeah  
P1 In terms of a culture that can engender PS. I do think it flows down. its possible 
for a middle manager to set their own agenda and run their own departmentI 
have experienced that when I worked for another company.we had a 
fantastic director of our division who variably set his own management style, 
his own culture and it was quite different from the rest of the companys and I 
think it was only possible because he was very very strong  and so he was able, 
well two things, one he was very very strong, very very able to fight for that 
freedom but also because he produced results at the end of the day. If he had 
not been successful he would not have had the latitude to get his own way. 
40.38 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  372 
Without that massive energy it wouldnt have been possible to.and he 
didnt succeed in forcing the change upwards.  He only succeeded in running 
his division the way he wanted it run. 
F So what I am hearing is a lot about,  in terms of willing and able, a lot of this is 
extrinsic to you as an employee, this is all stuff around you, this is all stuff that 
happens to you or around you or whatever, etc.  If we wanted to take control 
of our PS, irrespective of all this that goes on cos you get power and politics in 
every organisation, you get difficult clients wherever you go and you are going 
to get people with different experience and  different trust etc - is there 
anything you as an individual can do to maintain your PS while all this 
maelstrom is going on? I mean you mention self esteem and confidence, is 
there anything else that you would like, or have that would make you able to 
had PS? 
41.35 
P1 Adopting a persona, when you go and speak to a customer you adopt the 
<company name>s persona so you distance  the person you are there from the 
person you are yourself, that comes at a cost  
42.31 
F It does  
P1 Its a great way of putting up a defence for that meeting or indeed for all 
customer interactions but I think what you do by doing you invest your own 
personality in the company so now your own . 
P3  your self-esteem, your esteem your, your, self-respect an so and so forth 
becomes intrinsically to the value of the company.so if the company isnt doing 
well you feel bad about yourself because you think you might be contributing. 
P1 That and also if the company values deviate from yours . 43.15 
F definitely  
P1 . then part of you is being denigrated. So, that person, persona comes at a 
cost. 
F Yeah, it takes effort and energy to be a persona that is very much different 
from who you naturally like to be. And what this is saying is its about being 
yourself 
43.30 
P4 But some of that is down to the culture of the business and the power and 
experience. If you havent strated to implement that sort of culturecos if you 
imagine if you didnt have, you PS was low, you really have to change the 
culture of the business for it to increase, Cos it isnt a case of switching 
something on an it happens, it takes time and it takes participation to change 
the culture.  
43.41 
F So, I agree, I think culture, definitely errm  its huge I mean thats, how do you 
feel at work, is the culture encouraging you to be yourself, I absolutely agree.. 
44.12 
P4 I think it does in this company  
F Yeah, great And thats good to hear. If you were in an organisation whereby 
that was less the case, are you going to change it, well like you said its going to 
take a long long time, so what can individuals, can individuals do anything to 
equip themselves,  to feel safe irrespective of whats going on around. 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  373 
P1 They cant make themselves feel safe, the only thing they can do is arm 
themselves against the consequences of not being safe. Greater psychological 
robustness.  
44.52 
P3 Also, its effectively how safe do you feel in the rest of your life. If for instance 
you have lots of hobbies, lots of friends errm  very engaged in other aspects of 
your life,. The amount, if you feel very PS  in the rest of your life, then the 
chances are that you know, if work turns out, work isnt that great, you may not 
feel entirely safe at work it doesnt matter though, you know, if worst comes to 
worst I can change jobs, I can do something else, if you have a degree of self-
confidence you have a long term social social. 
45.07 
P4 external sources, better balance, works hard and you have a better balance 45.45 
P3 Also the armouring aspect. Its also a question of personal security you know. If 
you, you know, Youll probably feel a lot more willing to be yourself if you know 
you have a years salary in the bank and could, you know could, you know you 
take some time off or you have alternatives available you know. If you 
regularly.the more people feel that they are backed financially or 
organisationally into a corner, the classic one being people been with the 
company for 20 years, nearing retirement now, dont want to rock the boat 
because   that makes a very big difference. 
45.56 
P4 Do you think theyve become institutionalised  46.34 
P3 Yeah, they dothere is an element of that, institutionalisation if you have been 
with the same organisation, its certainly something thats visible 
F But does that not make them feel safe  institutionalisation? 46.45 
P3  No, no, often it doesnt  
P1 I challenge that, you mentioned large companies as well, so in small companies 
I think there is more scope for xxxxx personalities, in a large company tends 
towards optimisation, because xxxx  mass market appeal which tends to be 
grander, so I would have thought a long serving staffer 20, 30 years I would 
have thought that if they have survived that long they would have become 
institutionalised and aligned to the prevailing group think whether it was them 
30 years ago or not is a different question, but I think they probably, if they 
have been there that long, they have gotten used to it. 
46.51 
F So they have developed some sort of psychological robustness to deal with the 
peaks and troughs 
P4 Some sort of defence mechanisms xxxx but I agree with Tom. If you put 
someone in a job thats institutionalised, and you asked them to change jobs, 
they couldnt do it, and they couldnt do it because of the safety net that 
theyve got in their role 
P3 In a lot of org, these people are often, once they have adapted themselves to 
the org, they are often quite successful, they often have a lot of tenacity, a lot 
of staying power. But if there are significant sudden changes they are often the 
people who just you know, they are the people who are least able to cope, just 
because their particular psychological armoury has basically made sure. 
48.26hasnt made them very flexible. They have put on so much armour they 
are not flexible they can barely move. 
47.58 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  374 
P1 Yeah.you ask if thats psychological robustness, Im not sure it is. I think its 
evolution. I think they have actually changed. So, for me Psychological 
robustness is the ability to withstand things which are not to your mental liking. 
I think these people have actually changed so that now is to their liking its now 
an environment where, if not thrive, they, they succeed, survive. Maybe its 
come at some personal cost in terms of losing part of who they are, for  me its 
slightly different to being robust. 
48.25 
F So when it comes to evolving and flexibility you said, being flexible, or being 
able to evolve, what do you think they have that makes them able to do that? 
Cos like you say when you take somebody out of institutionalised environment, 
they are the ones, that you know, if you think about it, I mean,  I dont know, 
Ive come from a huge organisation where people have been there for 20 years 
and sudden life is changing like that <fingers clicking> and their level of 
flexibility, they are very insecure, so what do we need to give those people to 
say, you know what, youve survived this long, what do we need to pull out of 
them, or given them or help them to say lets get you flexible, lets get  you 
evolving. What do you think stops them doing it? 
49.01 
P3 Because a lot of the time they feel its, they feel that this is an imposition. That 
basically once they got comfortable in one position, because of the fact that it 
feels like its outside of their own control, the locus of control is somewhere else 
in other words I am being told to do this, not I think this is a good idea, you 
know,  I am being told to do but I agree it is a good idea.  
49.48 
P4 I would say actually, I would say some organisations, I personally dont like to 
be micro-managed and when I manage people I dont like to micro-manage 
them but some people actually like that, some people actually want to be told 
what to do every step of the way. 
50.14 
F Yep, they do  
P4  . And erm so if they get any responsibility for decision making no matter how 
minimum that is, and some people ??????some of these questions I dont 
know how they would be posed against contractors who come in and out of the 
business who see cultural changes all the time. 
F So, OK, well thats a good point, so contractors, you ask them, although they 
dont, they are really not part of this infrastructure, they usually feel quite 
psychologically safe do they not. 
50.48 
P3 Yes, because they have no long term gig? They know they are doing the 6 
months or 3 months or 6 months at a time, ok Ive got two weeks notice but 
they are not somebody who is expecting, there is no expectation, they expect 
to be there for 6 months and then be gone. And they also have the expectation 
that whenever they roll away they are looking for the next contract or next 
role. 
So effectively they are psychologically prepared for this change, they know that 
anywhere in the next 3  6 months there is going to be a completely different 
And the other reason, they feel relatively safe is that obviously if they are going 
contracting, theyve obviously made the decision that they can financially 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  375 
afford not to work for x number of weeks, or x number of months they have a 
degree,  they must have a degree of financial security they understand that 
they get paid better on the proviso that its not guaranteed. 
And the other thing is they dont have the emotional engagement, they know 
that if they work for, if they are in an organisation that they find toxic or 
difficult, they know they only need to be there for 6 months they dont have to 
make any kind of long term commitment to an organisation. 
F But neither does an employee  they could resign. Cos what I am hearing is two 
things. So I am hearing that if you are an employee you need that emotional 
engagement and connection to feel safe, but if you are a contractor, you dont. 
Its the lack of emotional connection that makes you feel safe. So how does 
that work? 
52.13 
P4 I think If you look at the experience of contractors, contractors tend to have a 
lot of experience in their own ability and that will compensate for some of the 
other. They realise the difference .With a contractor you expect them to hit 
the ground running, You possibly dont expect that from an employee. A 
contractor in my opinion you would expect to come in and hit the ground 
running 
P3 Contractor isnt expected to get trained, they are expected to get familiar with 
certain processes but they usually come in cos they already know something. 
Confidence comes from the fact that you cant really be a successful contractor 
and be incompetent at whatever you are hired to do. You get the revalidation 
because somebody else pays you to do the same job to fix some specific thing 
or to use your skills. 
52.52 
 So, if..go on..  
P1 Personality type; a contractor is a self-reliant person much more than a person 
who chooses to be a permanent employee. So the permanent employee makes 
the emotional investment as part of the way they like to structure their life. The 
contractor chooses not to make the emotional investment, or benefits from not 
having the emotional investment as part of who they are. 
53.21 
F Interesting thing you raised about, they hit the ground running, they have 
confidence in their ability, capability  all of those things, so if an employee had 
all those things, plus the emotional engagement, would that not make them 
feel incredibly safe, like the safest of safe. 
P4 Yeah, I suppose it would 54.10 
F OK, lets put it another way. If they had all that, what would need to be in place 
for them still to feel unsafeso they are good at their job, they are emotionally 
engaged but they still feel unsafe? Why, what would it be? 
54.12 
P4 It would be a threat from somewhere. 54.25 
P3 External threats, either in their personal life or something about the culture of 
the organisation. 
P4 It would have to be the culture. And the reason I would say that is because if its 
your personal life, you would be coming to work to get away from it. 
P3 Yeah, thats true  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  376 
P4 Whereas if you are at work, it could be the person above you, the person 
beside you. But if there is something that makes you unhappy, it doesnt 
matter how engaged you are, you can have all the experience in the world. 
F But they can still so its not just about emotional engagement, its not just 
about being really good at your job, there is definitely something thats  the 
organisation responsibility around culture.  
Do you consider yourself in a large organisation or a small organisation. 
P1  Medium  
 Laughter..  
P3 Yeah, medium I think when Tom  and you joined he would have called it a small 
organisation 
P1  I still would 100  people to me is small, 1000 is medium and 10 000 is large  
P5 It depends if you have worked for an organisation that had 3 employees  
F Yeah, yeah  its relative  
P4 If you look at the numbers there is also a level of how the business has adapted 
itself and  changed over the short period of time its more a medium sized 
business. I said to somebody the other day, its got a different mentality you 
know as the business grows, to some extent its a small organisation but the 
way the products work its medium so you have this cross over happening 
within the business. Most organisations of this size that I have seen would 
struggle to have this level of engagement. 
F It is, its a critical point in a organisation when you go from being small to 
medium, medium to large, these are big..cos theres a point when you are a 
small organisation where you need to fish or cut bait where you either need to 
stay small and boutique or we have to grow and there will be change thats 
associated with that. So you mentioned you think there is still a good level of 
engagement, so what did they do during that transition that change that 
enabled people to still stay safe and engaged, compared with say other 
companies that you might have worked with? What did they do differently, or 
what did they do well? 
P2 Delegate 57.17 
F So they delegate from .  
P2 Yeah  
F And what sort of things did they delegate during the change?  
P2 Management  
F Uh huh. And what does that allow you to feel.when you have been delegated 
to how does that feel?? 
P3 Really gives you a sense of trust, because theyre saying hey, Ive given you a 
target, Ive given you some deliverables, now Ill let you go away and do it. 
57.44 
F Yeah, so its back to your  micro-management type of thing  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  377 
P3 In the same way  its one of the things I have noticed actually, specifically 
within TE teams its happened a couple of times. We know perfectly well that 
when we hire people they are not going to be productive on day one because 
they dont know the product, they dont know anything so basically we say tell 
us what you think you can do and we let them go and do some useful work 
until such time that they are familiar enough with the product. But on 
occasions, especially I am thinking here with Usman here, OK, you go away and 
do your xxxx thing and it turned out to be really useful. We tried that on a 
number of occasions and it tended to work.Of course when it didnt work it 
tended to make a bit of a mess but those people arent  there  anymore.  
57.55 
F Well thats quite interesting cos they have done something a little bit risky, it 
didnt pay off and now those people have gone. So what is the view around 
risk? You know,  if you tried something new and different and it went wrong, 
whats the consequences? 
58.41 
P1 I think it depends on why it went wrong as well 59.00 
P1 I think the person you are thinking of there, if we are thinking of the same 
person they didnt leave cos what they did went wrong 
59.07 
F Oh right OK 59.13 
P3 No, the two things are not related  - in a sense it wasnt a problem that they 
went wrong, but they had, what you describe I think we are probably talking 
about the same person. 
59.15 
P1 So the technical solution wasnt great, but that wasnt, wasnt great it could 
have been improved and built upon, the problem was the, was errm their 
ability to take management and be directed to improve upon it and to accept 
external input and a number of other interpersonal factors.  
59.26 
F Ah, OK.  
P1 So in terms of trying and failing I think thats well tolerated if good efforts have 
been improved,  are used and accepted input. What one of the criticism is we 
spend too much time talking and getting consensus but thats a protection.if 
something is tried and failed lots of others have had a chance to get their eyes 
on it and say yes to it so if its failes, its a collective failure.   
59.53 
F  But is that not one of the parts of the armour that you are talking about in 
saying, I dont want to put my name to this new thing because if it goes wrong 
its going to be the sword of Damocles that comes down on me but if we all 
agree, I can go well everyone else said yes  you know is that not an armour? 
1.00.26 
P1 It could be, or it could be a humility  
F It could be  
P3 It kind of depends on whether your saying look, you are trying to protect 
yourself as a consequence or maybe you genuinely think that your colleagues 
might have something to say..they think that this is a good idea or a bad idea 
1.00.45 
 Or both  
P3 Or both. On one side you are seeking collective responsibility i.e. everyone 
contributed and agreed or at the same time you really did want the input 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  378 
P1 And that relates to what you said about ummm that that no man can know 
everything, that no longer is the manager manager because they know 
everything, thats thats not the case, so its airing an idea in front of lots of 
people is, is about getting those different perspectives, its a way of bringing 
together all that knowledge so that the,  its an informed decision thats made 
by somebody who doesnt understand it 
1.01.07 
F Yep  
P1 Sounds a bit dumb when put like that  
F Yeah but its drawn from the specialists  
P1  Yeah they have been well advised.  
F Right.. Ok. So there is something about the ability to do new things without 
having negative consequence and the ability to work with your team and draw 
ideas and this sort of collectiveness as well. 
1.01.43 
P3  And there is also the element of trust towards your manager, if you know you 
are going to fail, you know, you say I dont think this is going to work and your 
manager actually believes you and says, yeah, we can do something else what 
do you suggest. Or hey, I dont think what we are doing is going to work can 
you, can you change thisyou actually have enough of a relationship with the 
people you work for rather than work with to be able to be able to, to be able 
to, sort of, indicate to them that whatever we are doing here isnt working and 
that, that maybe we need to change it. 
1.02.04 
F And what if the manager said, I hear what you are saying, but we are going to 
do it anyway and you dont believe its gonna, gonna  work. How does that 
feel? 
1.02.32 
P3 Really depends on, on one side your kind of it really depends on, your own 
level you know if.some people find it very distressing, sometimes it 
like.some people have the ability to say, well fine, I have been told I ought to 
do that Ill go and do it and Ill work with the.the degree to which you feel 
threatened by that kind of situation is really how safe do you feel 
otherwise.you know, are you going to get blamed if it doesnt work. Theres 
an element. 
1.02.41 
P4 Sometimes, sometimes you are up against the, if you are up against time  
sometimes if you are up against time, sometimes its safer to say, we are going 
to have to do that, thats it.. 
1.03.05 
F Yeah  
 We havent got time to discuss it ..  
P3 yeah, were just gonna do this  
P4  .itll take far too long, we need to do something. Sometimes doing nothing 
runs a risk, err I just think you know that there is that element ..And it is a 
business, its going to change all the time and, and.with the best will in the 
world you know, we have requirements that should be met and so a so forth 
but I can guarantee that right up to the day we are releasing it were still 
changing it. 
1.03.20 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  379 
P1  It also depends how certain you are if its going to fail I think ..if you see a risk 
then continuing with executive cover is fine, if you see a certainty that its going 
to fail continuing regardless of the cover feels futile.    
1.03.44 
P4 Well, that again that comes with some experience as well, a, a, a newer person 
in the business wouldnt necessarily be able to gauge it that well because they 
havent got the experience 
1.03.59 
P5 I think if someone gets knocked back again and again, xxxx then he will stop. He 
will feel demotivated and he will probably stop making suggestions, and it 
makes him feel unsafe I would say because he would then feel he cant talk, 
speak their mind, you know, bring ideas you know 
1.04.11 
F Yes, exactly. So from a , theres still a massive onus on organisation and culture. 
Theres a responsibility on the manager I am seeing in terms how they manage 
you, micro managing, whether they delegate to you, their own personality or 
erm moods, or whatever you want to call them  ermmm and there is a piece 
here about the individual has a responsibility as well umm in terms of err, self-
esteem, identity, robustness, , I love that, psychological robustness umm and 
umm more of a sort of holistic view around how are they  feeling. What have I 
missed? 
What else.maybe a question might be. Is there anything that this organisation 
can make you feel more safe, and if so, what is it. What would you like to see? 
1.04.34 
 1.05.42  1.06.14 silence..  
F Its a good sign 1.06.15 
P1 Either that or no-one feels safe enough to say what theyd like to see change  
F Either that or everyone is terrified  
 <laughter>  
F Yeah, um  
P4 Its difficult,  its difficultin, in the way businesses are today its difficult to 
guarantee safety for anybody 
1.06.29 
F Umm it is  
P4 Its very. We had a quarterly review the other month that said how the 
business was doing.  I suppose that level of engagement lets us as employees 
realise whether we are good, bad or indifferent, I suppose if they stopped 
doing them and then turned around and said, this is where we are, we are 
down here then you wouldnt feel so safe. 
1.06.39 
F Yeah  
P3 I think, another isnt really the reviews, actually having..you, know, but 
actually you know, its it its a very changing business but its till useful to have a 
roadmap even if it keeps on changing. 
1.07.03 
F Of course, of course, yeah  
P3  the issue is that   when you basically have..you tend to feel less safe if you 
dont see goals on a roadmap being accomplished . You see amazing shiny 
1.07.16 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  380 
sitting on the hill over there, actually we havent built the road yetbut we 
might build it next month 
Umm and I think thats a question of confidence, how confident you are feeling 
with the direction of the businessthat that I think sometimes you kind of 
want somebody who gives you gives you a very strong, you want somebody 
who gives you a very strong direction because that you knoweven if you 
dont necessarily believe every element of it. 
P4 .. if you disagree with that, with that roadmap, then how would that make you 
feel?  
If you said well actually the company needs to do this, but were going 
here.you might think actually, the competitors are doing that but were doing 
this.unless you can buy in to what youre doing is the best thing since sliced 
bread, you might feel unsafe 
1.07.56 
P3 I suppose its a question of do you feel more safe in an environment where 
things could be changed quickly and easily or do you feel safe in an 
environment where somebody has some grandiose vision.which you know 
forward  onward Christian soldiers and we all go marching on towards it. Some 
people prefer the visionary environment where somebody has come up with 
this overall idea ummm  but at the same time I am not sure that will make you 
feel very Psychological Safe in that environment if you dont agree with that 
visionyou know its the  classic if you hear stories about Balmer or Steve Jobs, 
if you, sort of have this  wonderful vision but its not necessarily a good idea 
to disagree with any of them 
1.08.19 
F Well no, Steve Jobs was renowned for that, yeah, yeah.  
P3 You know that kind of environment where somebody is very visionary or very 
clear on what their vision is,  but they werent necessarily very tolerant of 
dissenting ideas then obviously, you know,  that could be a very difficult 
position 
1.09.06 
P1  But that gives you a clarity at least. Which if youre completely at odds with a 
clearly stated vision of the company, it, it makes it clear that you should have 
no emotional investment and at that point, the only.that should allow you to 
have should make you feel safer, in the sense that you  know you dont fit in 
so you know you need to be somewhere else and those external factors we 
talked about like employabilityumm financial stability come into play and if 
those are in place then you can get another job ummm so you, you dont need 
to care about the fact that they are going the wrong way as you perceive it . I 
think when its a smaller difference between the stated direction and your view 
of what the best direction is,  then youve got sheer, sheer forcesand thats 
hard because you dont want to let go of  what you think could be good if only 
they changed this and changed direction somewhat  thats probably harder 
than a complete, discrete view. 
1.09.18 
F So its like when you say there is a value thing as well there  do I see it going 
the right way, in the right manner etc. I suppose its a trade-off like you were 
saying, between the hard view that says theres where we are going and well 
these the roadmap, it might change in six months  you know, it might change 
1.10.22 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  381 
this way or that way you know so its about ummm, and lets be honest you 
need that fluidity in this kind of environment and the question is how do 
people weather that quite frequent change. Does it, if having a clear view 
makes you feel safe and they go, well thats where are going and then six 
months later they say no, we are going over there, then its like well 6 months 
ago we were going over there, and now were going here  is that a good 
thing, is that a bad thingyou know. 
P1 It that the difference between details and principles, so if you have visionary 
principles which are stuck,  adhered to, even if the direction flexes then that 
seems like a good thing 
1.11.12 
F Yeah. Yeah  
P1  If its,  if the underlying goals that are forever shifting thats a good sign to get 
1.11.25 
P3 And specifically when the shifting goals are really happening, mainly because 
the previous goal completely failed, thats usually a bad indication, you know, 
when the reason that shift is taking place isnt an adjustment because, you 
know different priorities now but where its obvious that what you are saying 
different priorities last time didnt work, lets try another one. 
Now it doesnt matter, iterating isnt a bad thing you know, any engineer knows 
that any 1.0 prototype is going to have some problems, it might not even work. 
The point is you do a proof of concept, the proof of concept works, it doesnt 
you know 1.0 can just be, you know it might be somewhat failure prone you 
know, there is nothing wrong with failing but if you get the impression that the 
business is basically lurching from one failure to the next  thats very different 
from an iterative improvement process 
1.11.32 
F Fair enough, yeah. And I, and I  think you are right in saying in todays, today, 
you know, I dont think anyone can be guaranteed a job for life. 
1.12.19 
P4 No, you know, you talk about people being in a job for 20 years thats 
something of the past, things are changing all the time. 
1.12.28 
F Unless you are in the governmentor the university  
P4 I think most peoples, most peoples jobs change, there is too much instability, 
theres bigger competition that there was before, you are not getting.??? 
1.12.41 
F And apparently there is a talent shortage, a talent shortage  
P4 Talent shortage?  
F Yeah, apparently, a global talent shortage  worldwide talent shortage and 
apparently 
P4  Its very difficult to judge sometimes, it takes people, certainly in technology 
and Ive thought about this as a business in the company, this is the first 
company Ive worked for where you dont have a training department, how 
would you put a training department together? The requirements are different 
for every floor you go to and different segments within the floor. You cant 
have,  you could have a research and development type things but thats 
different from training and. and but you still have to have a mechanism in place 
1.13.05 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  382 
to bring people in  with little experience and bring them up to the xx with a lot 
of experience. 
F Yeah, yeah, umm 1.13.43 
P4 Or bring someone in with a  lot of experience who can add extra to whats 
already in place and share,  
F And then keep them  
P4 The original <company> way was was, the swimming lesson by immersion 1.13.54 
F Oh, yeah yeahin you go.  
P4 .yeah, you know, if you managed to blow bubbles of the right colour we 
might actually fish you out if you are sinking. If not we wouldnt bother. There 
was very much in the early days there was definitely an element of that we did 
tend to select though, select for people who were self-starting and capable of 
picking things up as they went along but it also meant that you tended to get, 
umm,  it wasnt, it meant that basically there was kind of a lack of internal 
consistency because you kind of picked it up and invented the job as they went 
along 
1.14.02 
P4 And how much damage are we seeing in the business now.  
P3 We are certainly still dealing, we are only now dealing with the legacies from 
that period.  
1.14.38 
F But there is an interesting point there, to use your swimming analogy, umm 
you threw them all in and the ones that sunk to the bottom and drowned 
disappeared, but the ones that had something in them who were able to cope 
with that environment, the managed, they learnt to swim, they somehow 
learnt to swim despite having none of the extrinsic training support that 
perhaps they should have had, what, and you just said the most self-reliant go, 
sort it out them-selves-type-of-people. Are they the sort of people who make 
their own Psychological safety? Are they the ones that make their own rubber 
ring and they can float? 
1.14.45 
 Ummm.From an engineering perspective, I think everyone prefers self-
tapping engineers, as in yes training is useful but the important thing about 
training is that you have a consistent form of training the important thing is, I 
remember the first company I worked for, you know, Id learned on the job and 
one of my colleagues said something very very important to me, it was just a 
single sentence, it was just about,  the internal structure of the programs, 
dont,  you know, this is not a programming language, its a messaging engine  
it was that kind of statement, it really was quite abstract, but because it 
explained the fundamentals of what was going on, we are always looking for 
individuals, certainly from an engineering perspective,  who are capable of 
being, well not necessarily self-taught cos there is the old adage about if you 
are, you know,  self-taught youve had a fool for a teacher type of thing but, 
ummm  but the ability to absorb or develop knowledge, theres an element as 
an engineer, you really want somebody who is capable of performing 
experiments, say you have an API definition, set programming functions right,  
it would be nice if you could ask a colleague, what does this one do, the 
alternative is someone who is capable of formulating an experiment to see if I 
put this slightly weird values in, whats going to happen, does it blow up, does it 
1.15.25 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  383 
do what I expect it to, does it, how does it behave? If I dont know how 
something works, is there something I can do to try and find out how it works 
and... 
P4 You need somebody that, that xxxx evolves  
P3 Yeahevolves   
P4 Flexible really  
P3 Learning ability  
P1 Yeah, someone who is capable of synthesising new knowledge  
F Yeah, I dont think that just applies to engineering though as well though, if you 
are in sales, or markeing or HR, if the environment in which you are working in 
is evolving then you may need to learn new things laws are changing, 
customers are changing. 
P1 I think thats the talent shortagethe ability to synthesize new knowledge. To 
learn, to experiment, to discover things. You talked about the swimming pool 
methphor, in the early days the only people who could survive were the people 
who could figure out how to swim for themselves, as the company evolves, 
there is benefit in spending the time to codify swimming, umm because it 
means those who are, even though you still want those who are capable of 
learning to swim.ummm 
1.17.28 
F You are running out of metaphor there arent you  
 <laughter>  
P3 You want everybody to be able to do the crawl rather than   
F Yes  
P1 Thats right yes,   
F  so you put a life guard to make sure and  
P1 Absolutely because there will still be new types of water to swim in  
F Yeah, keep going, keep going with itlets see how far we can go.  
P4 I was having a discussion today with xxx about some of the code  and we write 
code in different ways and what we have got to get into the habit of is, is 
revealing what they say is the best way of doing it is, so were at the end, we 
are all finishing the swim if you like but some are faster than others and we 
have got to get them doing the best technique that we can and that, thats 
what Im saying is how do we pass that knowledge across? 
1.18.25 
P3 And how do you do it without hurting somebodys ego by suggesting that their 
code is kind of rubbish anyway, youve got to be able to bring those ideas 
across, explaining why you have to be able to do that but you also need to 
allow people a certain degree of leeway so that you are not, hurt their feelings. 
Egoless programming is, obviously a wonderful thing except 
1.18.54 
F The ego gets in the way of everything  
P3 but it doesnt work that way. Certainly.admittedly there is probably nothing 
worse that self-created prima donnas who all disagree with each as to what 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  384 
they do, as to how to do things, at the same time, its kind of helpful when you 
have got people who can listen to each other, learn from each other. 
F See, youve got degrees there, youve got on one hand you want everyone 
swimming the crawl and on the other hand you are say you dont want to 
micro-manage people, you want them to do their own thing and be innovative 
etc. There a lack of.a dichotomy there in terms you want both. 
1.19.41 
P3 On one side you would like to do everything that is structured engineers like to 
do everything by the book but you would like to be able to change the book. 
1.19.56 
P1 You can have a plan but there will always be unexpected things that come in, I 
think you want people who can deal with those unexpected things artfully. 
1.20.08 
F Good. It is coming up to quarter to the, two. Let me just check I have done 
everything that I need to do. Ermm, Yup, good. What do you think? How did 
you find the discussion? 
1.20.17 
P1 Very interesting  
P5 Intriguing  
F Yeah. OK, thank you. Its been great. Really interesting observations. Yes, some 
of it aligns with what some of the research is saying, so what I have got for you 
guys is a debrief letter and in the debrief letter it tells you, if you are interested 
in what we have been talking about today, there is some, err, documents and 
articles you can have a read about it. So, yeah, some of the stuff you have 
talked about aligns, other stuff is new and coming up and I am hearing it in 
other technology organisations, so I am sensing that there is some trends 
coming along, umm.  
The process from now is I have got a few more of these focus groups to do both 
here at <company name> and also in other IT organisations, errm and then 
once I have done all those, I will be producing a report  with no names in, it 
will just be, these are the trends, this is what I am hearing, this is what aligns, 
this is what doesnt align, this is what I am now going,  this is how it forms my 
hypothesis and of course you will , err, I will be sending that to Inga, and you 
will more than welcome to read it if you wish, or at least just look at the 
pictures, or just completely ignore it Whatever you prefer to do. But I really do 
appreciate your time on this..let me give you the debrief letter. 
Here it is..so basically this is a summary of what we have done, what we have 
talked about and erm some interesting reading if you wanted to follow up. My, 
erm, Ive given you my email address, I should have perhaps popped it on this 
letter, I will take the  documents away with me and if you have any questions, 
or youd like to follow up, feel free to drop me a line. Im on linked in as well 
umm if you want to go that way. 
Thank you.

FOCUS GROUP MANAGER TRANSCRIPT 
23rd November 2017 
Participants: 6 
F Semafone Focus group 2  
P1 You want us to do both forms? 0.08 
F Yes please 0.20 
 Silence as questionnaires completed  
F So, questionnaires, tick,  weve done the first bit already.  Errm I am going to do a 
little bit of an introduction, who I am, why I am doing this, what this is all about, 
and then we will go into the discussion for today. 
So, errmm,  as you know my name is Sam Mather, Ive worked for over 20 years 
in blue chip organisations across the world primarily in the field of talent 
development, err, umm and leadership development. Errr As I mentioned earlier, 
I was made redundant a year ago err from an IT organisation and I decided to 
fulfil a lifelong ambition to do my PhD full time. So I am now a student, and 
urrmm this is, this is part of the beginning of my research journey here in terms 
of the focus groups. So, umm I am being err supervised by two faculties, so, 
Psychology and Neuroscience because I am looking at the brain and how the, 
how the environment impacts the brain but I am also doing it with a very 
business focus so I also have a supervisor from Henley,  err, Henley Business 
school. So err I kind of straddle both camps, so I am surrounded by people doing 
clinical psychology, but actually I am not doing, doing any of that, I am focusing 
very much on organisations, and you will be given, feel free to contact me any 
time if you have any questions, about any of this and I am also on Linked-In.  
So the purpose of today is just about collecting data and thoughts. We dont 
have to come to a consensus, we dont even have to agree with each other, its 
really just the start of the collection process and as I said all your responses will 
be anonymised and coded anyway - I have that joy of ten hours of coding for 
every 1 hour of conversation <laughter> so, errm I have all that to come, so 
please, please be as open as you like ummm and it will eventually go into a big 
pot with other IT companies that I am running focus groups with, and at the end 
of it, once Ive got them all, Im, Ill produce a report which will talk about trends 
and whats come out and youll be more than welcome to have that, I will be 
sending that, sending that through to, through to Tim and Inga and it will be 
available for you. And dont worry, you wont see your name in there

P? Dam 5.44 
 <laughter>  
F Tim said  
P? You want royalties? 5.49 
F So the topic I would like to talk about today is Psychological Safety. So, its 
defined as being willing able to show your true self without any fear of negative 
consequences, whether those negative consequences are on you personally, o 
your identity, on your emotions or on your status and career. Kahn was the first 
guy who came up with the idea that there are some psychological dimensions to 
enable people to engage at work. 
Errmm emotionally, its about interpersonal behaviours, do you feel, do you feel 
ever at risk or there are any threats like, and the key, the key,  question people 
ask is do you feel you can speak up and say your mind. Its kind of like a litmus 
test  how do people feel about that. So for example if you work in the white 
house right now, that might not be as Psychologically safe an environment as it 
was perhaps previously.  
Now Edmondson, she umm, Edmondson umm was the lady who picked up and 
run with it in the late 1990s the challenge I have is she has focused very much on 
team, and how do you feel within a particular team, umm, but in this sort of.as 
organisations are changing from the 90s, we have many many teams, we are not 
just a member of one team and its not as stable as it used to be in the old, 
olden days when I started out. So, this is why we are starting to look at it from 
an individual piece. And its important because if people feel safe, their brain, 
their limbic system of their brain is not being stimulated, so therefore they can 
use the clever part of the brain, their pre-frontal cortex, which allows them to 
be innovative and creative. If youre too busy worrying about whats going on 
and your your limbic system has been activated, your putting your energy into 
protecting yourself as opposed to contributing positively to organisations. So this 
is why its important, particularly for IT organisations, we need people to be 
smart, we need them to, to come up with clever ideas.  
So the discussion today is given this volatile, the VUCA environment, volatile, 
uncertain, complex and erm ambiguous. Its a military term, a US military term 
which has been adopted umm, how psychologically safe do you feel and why? 
So lets start with opening by asking you on a number from 1  10, 1 being feeling 
I am not going to say a word, 10 being, yeah I feel really comfortable, where 
would you be and why. 
P5 Its this in our teams or in the organisation? 8.41 
F Good question. So, what I am interpreting by that question is that your PS differs, 
in depending on where you are. 
P5 Errrryes, yes, I suppose it does, yes. 8.53 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  387 
F Great, So then my question is, so what determines, when its at one end or the 
other? 
P1 The num.Well, for me the number of people in the room would make a 
difference, or actually I guess the people that you are with. 
P1 There are certain people that you probably feel  9.15 
P2 ..thats it.  
P1 . safer with cos you know them better or whatever.  
P2 .probablyits gonna be ok, you can say pretty much whatever you need to say 
but if you are not sure of what the repercussions will be, you more reticent  
P1 reserved  
P2 to speak your mind  
F OKso.. 9.35 
P1 It also depends on how much alcohol youve drunk as well  
 <laughter>  
F  Yes  there is an underlying assumption here that alcohol is not involved  
P1 Ah, okalright  
F Any studies go out the window.  
 Thats why the Christmas party would not do here.  
 So, putting alcholol to one side, what I am hearing you say is, its about ummm 
the people that are around you and h..you said knowing their reactions 
P2 Yeah, so there may be disproportionate reactions to what you say to  people, or 
unintended consequences, outcomes whatever, so basically you have to 
measure that against, you know, its a trade off. You can say what you want but 
its best to ensure that what you say is said in the right terms in a given 
environment 
P3 I think everybody assesses things on 10.34 
P2 ..tactics  
P3 on whether the person that is receiving the message is adult. And thats, 
thats, psychologically adult rather than you know, age adult. So if you feel that 
the person that you are speaking to or communicating with is going to receive 
your message, even if they dont like it, they are going to receive it in an adult 
fashion. 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  388 
P2 Yes  
P3 the likelihood is you are going to have a more sensible conversation  
P1 Youre going to feel more comfortable with it  
 if you feel that person is not going to perform in an adult fashion and has some  
pre-disposition towards  
P1 Yeah, yes you start to think a bit more carefully about how they are going to 
react 
P3  I mean childish is possibly the wrong word if you have an immature reaction to 
a set of events then you are far more reticent to decide whether youre are going 
to, to communicate and quite often within the first 5 or 10 mins of meeting 
someone, thats what youre actually weighing up decide whether to have that 
communication in the first place, so..Tims example of maybe talking to 
customers I am sure there is a reservation there before you even start isnt 
there. 
11.17 
P1  Yeah yeah  
P3 For you guys, its you know,  in your in your very close knit teams its probably not 
so bad where you know your teams.. 
11.48 
P2 Nonotheres  
P1 Its sort of the importance, the the,  you. Youre yourre,  are assessing the 
importance consequence of saying the wrong things or doing the wrong thing 
arent you in that customer environment, its like you dont want to mess up 
you dont want to say the wrong thisoh god, Ive missed  that opportunity or 
they have gone off and and iI suppose is that what I care about what they think 
about mea little bitbut its also that I care about the outcome, I want them to 
become a customer of <company name>, or you want, you want them to spend 
money with us, so there is an outcome that I am after ummm I, I, think you 
know, it would be crazy to think that is it not somehow associated with their 
potential judgement of me as a person, I mean, I ,I,  you know would say that 
yes, there is always going to be an element of that to those interactions. 
11.56 
F Uh huh  
P2 I think this varies widely, Ive been in teams before this company where very 
carefully  on what you say because the people, the slightest criticism could set 
them off.and this can go on for week, weeks 
12.43 
F So what do you mean by set them off  
P2 They will go, basically they will do this antagonism basically and they will go off 
and try to prove themselves to you, and particularly if they are a peer or over 
you in terms of the hierarchy, it can be difficult to manage. 
13.00 
P1 I mean thats a great.Frankies point about that, the immature reaction  
P2 Ive seen thatit can be quite dramatic.  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  389 
P4 It might change the position depending on where you are in that team job? ???  
the team then you are much more confident than if you are actually in the team 
erm people <inaudible> actually what you two are saying makes more sense that 
you judge the audience. 
13.24 
P3 Yeah, Im finding it hard to understand what I mean by adult, because its its not 
about whether somebody is you knowat a higher grade or a lower grade, it is 
their reaction to the information that, I mean if they attach emotion to that, 
sometimes that emotion is great cos its positive and somethings that emotion 
is detrimental because you either inadvertently threaten someone or their PS is 
in question and therefore it brings out you know scratch cat and box and you 
then have to work out how you are going to cope with that and I think everybody 
makes a judgement about that before they start a conversation and it doesnt 
matter, it certainly doesnt matter to me anyway if it happens at Tims level or 
one of my reports, you still judge everybody as if they were accountable on the 
idea of how they are going to urm emotionally react to the information or the 
statement and stuff that Ive got to make..um so I think it is PS versus PS if you 
like. WE all have a pecking order for that and we all make judgements about it 
and decide how we are going to feel and how that informs our own PS. 
13.45 
P1 Dyou know, I mean for theres always an element of the subject matter thats in 
the information or communication, how confident do I feel about it,  
15.10 
P3 By delivering bad news for example, thats quite often a situation where most of 
us would feel slightly Psychologically Unsafe ourselves or under confident cos its 
never a nice thing to do and you never know how someone-else is going to react 
15.18 
P1 Yep I was thinking particularly in <company name>, well in any technology 
company technology is always an area where, some people will.well there is 
always a pecking order  who knows most about, right, so I mean you know, if I 
was to come to George and sort ofif I was going to have a technical 
conversation with George I would naturally be, probably quite reserved in my 
opinion cos I would wantyou know I know he knows more about it than me, so 
I would errrr. 
15.36 
P2 I think its natural, seriously in my team, I think most of the team know much 
more about it than I do 
15.50 
P1 Yeah  
P2 They have had many more years that I have its a thing. But in terms of the team, 
thinking about what Les said before, I think the team lead gives the, gives the err  
actual signals, right. if they speak, if the team lead speaks openly that gives, you 
know  the right, perceived as given the right for team members to do the same, If 
they are very errr forcing heirachy, that gives them less of the option 
P3 I think what Tim is trying to bring out is that there are also dogmas associated 
with that, son if somebody has a particularly passionate view shall we say. 
16.32 
P1 Yes, yeah  
P3 To be kind, umm then that can be considered a threat to someone who might 
not have quite that same way, so you end up in situations where you might 
violently agree, run with the definition that its violently in its delivery 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  390 
P1 An I, and I think youre your point about when you go in for a conversation, if 
you know, you know its gonn, its with somebody, it is one of those people with 
those strong opinions, you naturally approach that conversation in a more 
sensitive careful way. 
17.12 
P3 Particularly in an IT environment or any technical team there is quite a lot of that 
because people have worked hard to get to the knowledge bases that theyve 
got they have an opinion about how things should be done, you know, they do 
these things because  
17.28 
P1 and you get these deep domain experts dont you, who really do know a subject 
super well 
P3 And thats important, its not money. Its not status. Its not anything else, you are 
actually attacking them as an individual. 
17.51 
P2 I agree, I think, I think, that in a sense there is a knack to managing people by the 
right conversations. If you want to get the message across you cant speak to the 
same people the same way, you might try a different approach 
17.59 
P6 You might ask their advise, mightnt you,  try to make them feel important to 
begin with  
17.15 
P2 You might even try to propose it or try to get them to buy in to whatever it is you 
are proposing, so its, its, kind of a game,. 
P6 Well its like game of chess, isnt it really, it can be,  
P3 But the outcome of that is you are trying to make them feel PS in order to  
P6 Yeah, in order to get the best out of that conversation.  
F Chantal raised two issues about the team and youve talked a lot about 
interpersonal relationships between two people, but, you mentioned, do I feel 
safe in my organisation as wellyou mentioned, so if we are talking about 
organisation as well, what is it about an organisation that makes an organisation 
feel safe to work for? 
18.46 
P2 Theres an overall..am looking for the right word, there is an overall look and 
feel to the organisation, which makes, you know, you you get it quite quickly 
when you join a company, Im here just over a year and from day 1 I felt safe, in 
other companies not so much.  
19.10 
F So what are the differences between those who do you or you dont what is the 
thing. 
P5 I think its the culture cos Ive been in companies whereby if you do something 
wrong they would fire you. They will do anything they could to find a scape goat. 
This company isnt like that. You make a mistake, we learn from it and thats the 
whole point of it. Errm it makes you feel like you can contribute and you are part 
of the organisation, so you feel more secure. More trust 
19.33 
F  Right, so it makes you feeltrust so theres  atrust there and almost like an open 
attitude to failure.  
19.58 
P5 Yep  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  391 
F For want of a better word.  
 <laughter>  
F Theres no such things as failure, only feedback Its just feedback thats all. 
Ok. So you are feeling safe there. Any other mechanisms that organisations can 
put in place to make people feel safe 
P3 Its almost like, because theres departments and teams, theres a  ??? between 
departments and teams that varies depending on how a team is structured or 
the culture of the team which is slightly different to other teams, ??? objectives, 
whatever. 
20.23 
F Yes 20.37 
P3 So its like, its almost like when you approach one team, you speak in one way, in 
another team you speak slightly different way. I dont think its bad, I dont think 
its something that needs fixing but its a fact that not all teams work in the same 
P3 Could some of that be due to that fact though that we are very dedicated to our, 
I know its a horrible word, but our silos  you know, what our, our teams do and 
the intensity with which they do them and sometimes if those silos arent quite 
aligned up with those same strategic goals in mind and they feel like they are 
pulling away from each other because their goals are slightly different you 
get.. 
20.53 
P5 If you go upstairs is really quiet, whereas I make a great effort to make sure 
people are talking to each other  it can be about anything, nothing to do with 
work cos you are at work 8 hours a day so 
21.22 
P1 There needs to be a bit, a bit of fun and actually if you went up to the sales team 
in London there is, there is, you know chat all the time. 
21.34 
P3 But that doesnt mean there is PS though is that just the preference?  21.41 
P1 Its just the type of, is it sort of the personality type, the type of individuals in a 
certain team. 
21.46 
P3 Developers think, thats what they do. 21.50 
P2 Developers talk all the time, thats absolutely true,  they can talk, well about the 
work anyway. Um but yeah, I, I,  
21.52 
P3 I dont see the fact that they are quiet as an issue thats associated with them 
feeling psychological safety 
21.58 
P5 No, <inaudible> ..very different  
P1 Yes so somebody from the outside trying to have a conversation or to think 
about kind of communicating something that wall of, of silence can be, 
potentially be 
22.05 
P5 quiet intimidating 22.15 
P1 Yeah, potentially yeah  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  392 
P5 I mean you wouldnt go out an employ someone who.. 22.19 
P1 Do you??? What?? HR  
 <laughter, lots of talking>  
P6 So if I need to get a message across 22.28 
 <lots of laughter>  
P6 ..lets change the title  
F There is kind of a pre-requisite that you are physically safe to get onto being 
psychologically safety 
P4 I would say one of the things that on a smaller scale that makes you, or me feel 
more comfortable there is a bunch of meetings, we regularly get together, 
whether its in front of another group, we have weekly meetings to assess about 
risk and If we werent having those weekly meetings umm but we were having 
them remote, I think people would get pretty bored of them, they just switch off. 
So there is that, I get, just going to those, I get the feeling that we can, theres 
the time to talk, and there is plenty of meetings where we can talk so that, that 
makes me feel more comfortable umm, its more,  so its more open 
22.48 
F So how does that dynamic change, or does that dynamic change if your team, or 
the meeting that you are having is with people who are remote? 
23.25 
P1 I was going to say,  youve hit on a great.we have sort of virtual relationships 
via email and instant messaging and things, and then we have real relationships 
were we have face to face and I have to say that they can, they can be binary 
actually in terms of the complete opposite in the way that you umm, you interact 
with somebody on, on  in that virtual world than the real one 
23.34 
F I mean we are globalising and your boss might be in a different country, or your 
teams or whatever, so,  I mean, what do you need from them in order to feel PS. 
How does it impact it being remote? 
23.55 
P5 It becomes a very big switch to objective based relationship because they need 
to know, what, because they are left, I mean we have teams in Austin. I spend a 
lot of time,  I have weekly chats with them to make sure they know we are still 
here but their sort of down days are based on objectives, its more, its more 
structured as such than here because here you know what people are doing,  and 
over there you dont know what they are doing and theres a time difference . 
24.09 
P2 In a previous company we had a team not based in the office, everyone their 
own house and we were probably at least as in contact as we are here in the 
office because we used Skype  but we were in the same time zone so being a 
different time zone is actually a big switch.. I ended up in the other company 
with teams across the global with 24 hours difference, 12 hours difference and 
that is really difficult to manage. 
24.43 
F Yep. And, I mean if you are in a team that is dispersed like that, what do you 
need to feel safe, over and above what we have already talked about.Is there 
anything different? 
25.13 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  393 
P2 Frequent contact I think for the remote members and thats definitively 
something we need to work on. But, yeah you cant apply the same principles for 
people who only have 2 hours, one and a half hours overlap in time zone to 
someone sitting next to you. 
P1 I am sure you guys would agree that if youve got, I mean we,  you have to spend 
a lot more time reassuring the people who are remoteso anyone who is 
working remote you thinkoh goshof course they will have misunderstood 
that.arrhg you know,  so you spend way more time giving reassurance to the 
people who are remote whether its necessarily about trying to make them feel 
safe or not, but it is just about making sure they understand whats going on and 
they havent misunderstood and they are  not sitting there dwelling on 
something that happened a week ago, whereas actually somebodys, when you 
are face to face with somebody you can pick it up, see it straightaway, you can 
see it,  oh that person looks a bit down, you can go and say whats going on. 
Whereas you know,  I mean I find that all the time, its amazing, if you, if you 
dont think about the boss in Austin or Phil down in Australia or whatever you 
can suddenly go a talk to them and three or four weeks go by and  Christ you 
guys are miserable as hell, whats gone on, whats happened, cos you havent just  
been reassuring them that they are doing right and everythings ok soummm 
Ive got no experience of being that remote person actually, I think most of us 
are kind of all spend most of our time here 
25.41 
P2 Being a remote person is not easy, not easy because you dont have the same 
contact, so you dont have the same safety, you dont have the same support in 
many cases, you gotta be much more self- confident, much more selfwhat is 
the word.. 
26.48 
P2 Yeah, exactly, than someone in an office with other people, so it is very difficult, 
very difficult. 
F And yet that is often the way we are going, in the way of remote teams and err 
so the mechanisms we have talked around, you know being able to walk up to 
someone and saying hi, and having the fun bit, and the cake in the kitchen and all 
sorts of stuff they dont have that, so that is a, if thats the way we are going, 
how do we make these people feel safe. And you are saying communication, 
communication.anything else? 
27.17 
P2 Communication is fine,  I think its the overlap thats really important in terms 
ofwe have skype, we have so many ways,  we have email, we have IM, we have 
so many ways of speaking to each other even on the road, Ive had that for many 
years with people being on Skype 5, 6 hours a day with each other in view of 
everyone, next to each other but if you only have two hours or four hours with a 
person and you are in meetings or whatever, its, thats thats more delicate to 
manage. 
P3 There is a curiosity with that though cos, ermm, upstairs in development, people 
would much rather email than stand up and talk to each other so thats.. 
28.20 
P1 Again it comes back to that, there is a diffthere is a virtual relationship going on 
isnt there and a real one 
28.30 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  394 
P3 to some extent they seem to feel safer  
P1 On IM  
P3 ..Than communicating in the way that is you know more social and there is 
something intellectually, you know or in the brain somewhere that makes them 
feel safer to just pop their little fact out, and thats their. <inaudible> 
P1 Write it down, they are controlling the message, theyve thought about it theyve 
been able to. 
P3 Yep  
P2 Dont under estimate the fact that when you join a team, I dont know how often 
that happens today, when you join a team, you fall in line with whatever 
methods are.. 
29.05 
P1 Hmmmyou accept the norms that are there 29.16 
P3 If someone wants to communicate verbally, but you fall in line.. 29.16 
P3 This is, this isnt by any means peculiar to <company name> 29.19 
P2 OK  
P3 Absolutely not.  
F Let me just turn that on its head and challenge that for a moment. To what 
extent is the reason they write it down and email mail it because they may feel 
Psychologically unsafe and they may feel safer to write it down, maybe copy 
everyone, I dont know, to what exIs that indicative of a safe person, or an 
unsafe person? 
29.27 
P3 I, I couldnt say, I dont know, but I do notice that its a trait in development and 
engineering institutions 
29.46 
F Yep  
P5 Errrrr.. Ive had teams that are developers and havent done that.. 29.58 
P3 There are, and Im not, Im not saying that doesnt happen but there are a lot 
that operate in that way 
30.01 
P2 Well thats what I was saying, I think, I think youre right but I also think its how, 
how the team 
30.08 
P5 Absolutely.  
P2 kind of start communicating with each other, if they, if they, if they learn to 
make it by email and they join a team that communicates speaks by email, you 
are not going to sit up and stand up and start talking to the other..youre gonna 
do the same thing so it depends, I mean, errm yeah,  .a number of teams quite 
vocal quite fun, others are much more formal possibly too formal in some cases, 
everything works, documented but it depends on the company of the team a lot 
30.13 
P3 I dont disagree. 30.39 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  395 
P6 Also based on the manager then as well 30.41 
P1 Fair observation yeah 30.42 
P3 ..it is a trend and it is quite prevalent in a quite a number of engineering 
communities 
30.43 
P4 I I think it gives those people ??? because you can take control you can say Ive 
done this, Ive documented it, I can prove that I have done it - if they come back 
to me in two weeks time I dont have to go oo er, oo-er so I think errm for me I 
think thats thats  the way of keeping control and with that control, you get 
more comfortable. 
30.50 
P3 Yeah but it the question Samantha? 31.15 
F Sam, sam is fine  
P3 Is it because of track and trace basically to see, to see what has happened, or is it 
to.which is good because you can review information about projects or is it is it 
to err  cover ourselves. 
P4 Probably a bit of both, if we are to be seen as doing our job properly and 
professionally, then may that be one of the things to be able to evidence that I 
have done x, y, z.  they have been tasked with an objective and I know I have 
done that because here is the evidence 
31.39 
P1 So given the environment we work in which I appreciate has peaks and troughs 
for all of us, there is a high paced, theres lots of things going on.youve all got, 
everyone has a task list as long as your arm kind of thing, there is always things 
to do, so you are right, it is noticeable, we do. 
P5 I hate emailsI get thousands of emails  
P1 Yeah but we do use it dont we, everybody does use it the this is my way of 
knowing that Ive done a task and its recordable, and its done and I can 
32.15 
P6 And someones <inaudible> 32.22 
P5 But I have too many, I cant read them  
P4 But if you had that many people coming up to you saying by the way Chantal, Ive 
done this dont forget this, dont forget that 
32.28 
P1 Arrrghhhh  
 <laughter>  
P2 This is actually important because in a previous company I had something which I 
thought was completely useless and pointless, actually very useless effective 
email communication becasue I see you know, email strains basically that go on 
forever, thats not a conversation. Either get off the email or IM and talk to each 
other rather than have endless emails talking about yes, no, whatever, its just 
used wrong. 
32.37 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  396 
P4 Yeah, For me thats like Email etiquette but that doesnt erm, that doesnt, that 
doesnt give them anymore confidence, if its documented than I know I have 
done my job properly. 
33.03 
P1 And even actually, having been privy to some of the stuff you guys have done 
over the years with customers where you are on a bridge and your all 
investigating an issue, umm if it was all verbal you wouldnt have a record of 
some of the things you are trying cos Ive seen this, you guys have said well look 
heres the transcript from the IM session we have just had youll see up here at x 
point we did this and you know, so actually again, its using, there is sort of a 
record there of what youve been doing as a collaborative team. 
33.18 
P5 Its got a measure of control and you can understand whyso you know whats 
going on 
33.48 
P1 <laughter> I think to some of the more uncertain, complex and ambiguous 
customers that we have to deal with its so, in fact I am thinking certain people 
<company name> over the years, really sort of antagonistic bridges, I mean 
youve been on more than anybody that, having that, taking it away from the 
verbal haggling having it written down helped I think, or seemed to help.. 
33.55 
P6 To give Sam an idea, how long were those conference calls that you were on 34.26 
P5 Days  
 <laughter>  
P1 What was the worst, 18 hours I think you were on 34.33 
P2 18 hours? Oh you smashed my record by a lot  
P3 I joined this session for training but before I even got there, there was this 
disaster and I think I ended up on the bridge for 18 hours. 
34.40 
F Yeah, I mean the reason, the reason I threw that in there is quite often where 
you  where you are inundated with umm emails, that if you took away the ones 
you ccd on and all that, quite often it can be symptomatic of people covering 
their backs 
34.51 
 Yeah <Multiple participants>  
F . and why are they doing that, well cos there is a lack of trust therethings 
wont get done etc etc. Thats the only reason I pushed back, I am not suggesting 
that thats the case but I was just challenging  
P3 No, I think thats, I think thats perfectly valid, its very easy to bully via email and 
you know, you see again when people feel passionately about some sort of 
technology or something  you very soon get the but  but  but and it gets 
copied and then it gets copied again and before you know it the whole 
companys involved about a ridiculous argument about the kind of technology 
they are using 
35.18 
 <laughter>  
P3 and then so   you know, we seem to use email to protect but equally we use it 
to attack 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  397 
P1 as a weapon sometimes  
F Its an easy medium  
P3 It is an easy medium to do that because you dont have face to face  
P1 Yes  
F I mean what would be the consequences, I mean having come from a technology 
company myself, I mean, what would be the consequences of somebody not 
winning that argument cos I know its very much, you know, its very knowledge 
based.I know this much, but I know this much but I want this technology duh 
duh duh I mean what are the consequences of somebody not winning that in 
the context of PS? 
36.04 
P2 I dont think its as clear cut as that but lets put it this way, there are teams or 
people in the company that have a higher weight in deciding an argument than 
others. Not necessarily always the right people , but mostly the right people 
definitely, yeah umm so I have heard stories in many companies about things like 
that, its nothing new, its nothing unusual, you have people who have 
personalities who want their way and they will do whatever they can to get to 
that point. 
36.26 
P5 But for the person who has lost the argument, it depends on their personality 
really, if theyve a mind to be really upset about it because they are passionate 
about it, or whether they think, Oh Well, Ive put my bit in. 
37.10 
P1 Yeah somebodys has made a decision 37.22 
P5 theyve made a decision so it really depends   
P2 For some people its really important that they can.. 37.26 
P1 I suspect thats probably the key isnt it  has somebody made a decision on turf 
that you felt was your responsibility you know, youre accountable for that 
therefore you should be the ultimate decision maker. If somebody is imposing 
their decision on you, you probably feel a bit pissed off actually 
P5 ..yeah absolutely   
P3 whereas actually if you have contributed to a discussion and its gone to I 
dunno, Tom cos its a big architecture thing, youve all had your say and Tom 
goes,  in his ultimate wisdom this is the way we shall go, then Ok  cool,  he 
listened, he heard what I had to say 
P3 I wonder whether some if it is to do with the fact that you dont feel as though 
you were listened to as opposed to whether the argument is right or wrong 
P1 Yeah  
P3 ..and I can think of a number of people, erm both here and elsewhere who 
become extremely demotivated disengaged and eventually left because they feel 
that  erm there is too much dogma on one particular side and the opportunity to 
exchange and even be listened to,  never mind whether you win or lose the 
argument is not there and I think  technical teams in particular do.suffer from 
38.21

S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  398 
P1 Yeah they har.yes, they,  which is why, its a trite thing to say and way too 
simplistic but the number of times that you can get one of these email exchanges 
bubbling up as you say with the world and his dog getting copied in and its like 
ok, lets all get in a room and have a conversation and maybe the two key 
protagonists or maybe 4, 5 people but thats when you solve it, you dont ever 
get , you are less likely to get the  resolution if the email thread continues 
38.50 
P3 But even if you solve it . 39.13 
P1 We are stillharbouring of  
P3 There is still a harbouring of unsafeness with the people who dont feel that 
their argument was at least acknowledged and that, if that persists with 
dominate characters thats when you do you know what, Ive had enough,  Im 
out here.Im gonna change my. 
39.16 
P1 Yeah, yeah  
P3 And then they take.  
P2 Its bound to happen, its bound to happen in organisations. It depends how often 
it happens. 
39.38 
P1 I mean youre right, We all sat here in a nice open place and we enjoy it and we 
put a lot of effort into I mean alcohol is part of it, we do organise events, we 
organise meetings and things and it is about trying to break down inhibitions and 
get people to build relationships I mean thats why we do those events is cos we 
do want people to get to know each other a bit so they are not feeling concerned 
about the interpersonal relationships maybe even ummm even we have had at 
times quite high turnover in certain parts of the business and I think Frankie is 
spot on, its invariable because those people dont feel they are being listened to 
and it almost gets to a point where its too late you cant suddenly start switching 
that on and say, hey Im listening, Im listening now, well you should  
39.43 
P5 They are disengaged  
P6 They are disengaged and they effectively ..exit interviews.  
F They have mentally left but not physicallyit just follows.. 
Let me just, if we go back to the, in a minute well go back to the definitions, and 
what we have talked about is a lot is the environment, so being heard, being 
confident, interpersonal relationship etc  and these are all quite extrinsic things 
which encourage us to be WILLING to share and, and, be ourselves. What about 
the able piece. What does an individual need? If they are in a remote team and 
they cant go for a drink with everyone else and they umm, their manager is 
remote and all of these extrinsic things are not available to them, what can, if 
anything, can individuals do to be ABLE to feel PS? What do they need? 
40.40 
P2 The need to be able to communicate more, or attempt to communicate more 
with the remote team 
41.37 
P5 They need a lot of praise, that they are doing a good job more so than you would 
probably give somebody 
41.46 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  399 
P2 Thats not what they need to do.what do they need to dothey need to be 
more, let me give you an example, if if if theres a decision thats to be made, and 
no ones available, you have  to document that and then discuss later what is the 
right thing to do for example, it is really difficult for  someone to actually make a 
decision and then discuss it but thats a fact of people not being able to find the 
right person to discuss it with when  you have a situation 
41.51 
F So what do they need to be able to make that decision? 42.29 
P2 They have to be more knowledgeable in some areas because they have to be 
more independent, and thats the selection process which we have in place 
already. 
42.32 
F So, ummm they need to know stuff about the decisionbut there are people 
who still know STUFF but they dont make the decision 
42.46 
P4 They need to have that confidence, confidence in themselves   
P2 And the authority yeah.. 43.03 
P4 that they can, they can do  thatand how do they get thatummm manager 
<inaudible> 
P1 I think they also they also do need the capability of getting on the phone, pick up 
the phone,  get on IM, get hold of somebody if you are unsure or uncertain about 
something 
43.19 
P4 But thats just a confidence thing..  
P1 I think you are absolutely right, yes theres a sort of is a tool set, they have to 
access to the toolset set 
P5 Sometimes not knowing,  they have to find the answer out  
P2 My point was they will be in a situation when they dont have anyone on the 
otherside to help, they wont be sure about what to do next, they have to make a 
decision, to make a call because its a crisis, they have to do something on the 
spot. 
43.40 
P1 .it must happen to your guys you know, they get woken up in the middle of the 
night..on the phone2 in the morning. 
43.55 
P5 Yes Les gets woken up in the middle of the night   
 <laughter>  
P1 Actually your guys are all very PS cos they know theyve got Les there at the end 
of a phone any time of the day 
44.06 
P4 Yeah, hopefully they have the confidence that they get the time never mind the 
time I can ??? I can time 
P3 Thats a High degree of self-management thats really. It comes with experiences  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  400 
F Yeah, experience Im hearing that a lot. you  just make, I know its a joke, they 
know they have Tom there on the end of the phone but maybe there is 
something about having support, the right support, whatever that looks like 
P6 Yeah I think you know you feel safe if someones got your back and you can 
reach out 
44.46 
P2 Its not always possible with your team it is, with mine it may not always possible 44.51 
P3 Its very rare though that you get somebody who operates solely as an island 45.01 
P2 Well we have a few cases  
P1 Well thats why, I mean, you talked about your weekly meetings and your daily 
scrums is the chance, people get the chance to kind of 
45.03 
F But does that make them feel safer or less safe being, operating as an island..  
P2 I dont think they will feel safe, as safe as we do here. 45.15 
P3 I think thats what I am sayin..I cant envisage that there are situations where you 
could set that up so they are totally an island.. 
45.17 
P5 We have team members that are 8 hours behind, or in front, one or the 
other.there is a very small amount of the day when they can feel confident, and 
then it becomes night time and everybodys left  so they spend most of their day 
as an island and that is very true. 
45.30 
P1 Yes  
P3 But ultimately they can still communicate. Whether there is a delay in that 
communciation. 
45.47 
P1 I mean Stu, Stu, hes left so we can talk about him, Stu had that same issue, being 
8 hours behind on the West coast he I mean, the relationship just died over a 
long period of time. 
45.54 
P3 Yeah but what he learns with that is agility 46.08 
P2 You cant rely.  
P3 So if your, if your job, and you feel PS is dependent on agility then thats where 
that situation becomes difficult 
F So tell me what you mean by agility, just unpick that for me 46.11 
P3 If you have to respond to something quickly and you have no support mechanism 
within your 8 hour window thats when youre Psychologically unsafe. 
46.20 
P1 Correct  
P3  if you can pre-plan your work so that you can work in an environment where 
you follow the sun, and that is done quite often. Then there is no issue here. 
46.31 
P1 Yeah yeah yeah  
P3 before when we just followed the sun and we have a hand over process and we 
keep going and it doesnt matter than somebody was in Japan earlier and your 
46.43 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  401 
now in the UK. You could still get your work done. So the PS mechanisms there is 
how much you need to plan and how reactive you need to be 
P1 Is there something I mean you talk about the 8 hour, its almost as if, is there 
something about the fact that youre able to handover stuff at the end of the day 
and your not, not having to go. 
47.03 
 No (Multiple replies)  
P5 It doesnt work like that.  
 Well I just wondered is that an issue thought, is it an issue because he is almost 
having to go to sleep on the fact that he hasnt resolved stuff because he is 
waiting for you to get up in the next day. 
47.15 
 For example well do a design, and he may have be two variations that he could 
do, quite equal over the design and he doesnt know where to go with it, he has 
8 hours then to wait til he can bounce it off somebody on which way to go, which 
means he is unproductive in his view of that day, erm so for him, he must feel 
pretty 
47.24 
P2 We have a measure of that, we can measure it the, the level of anxiety because I 
occasionally get panic emails from everybody in the team right, the frequency 
from the remote members, ???  the most furthest away,  is far more prevalent 
because he doesnt have, if there is panic in the customer,  project, support or 
whatever or there is a decision to make he knows hes got a very small window to 
get people to support him with things he is not necessarily familiar with. 
47.49 
P3 So what thats telling me is that the agility with which we need to respond to the 
work that youve got to do doesnt make remote working a viable option for 
people to feel safe 
48.20 
P5 Errrrrrrr no. I would say that time difference was too much compared to the 
other time difference, we had a lot more overlap time 
48.32 
P2 Its an extreme 48.41 
P5 Because I have calls at 11, 12pm, 10pm if something has gone horribly wrong and 
George has as well 
48.43 
P3 So there is a window of time whatever that is beyond which it becomes difficult 48.50 
P5 Yeah but I think they procrastinate over it because they know its late for us to a 
point to of where they are in a state. They wouldnt contact you when they were 
a bit like wooooo cos they think itll be alright but then it just goes and then isnt 
alright 
48.52 
P2 Yeah we have to deal with the time, its not perfect, we dont deal with it 
perfectly 
49.12 
P3 Not if you are individual  
P2 Yeah but the point is its a real issue, its not something we can avoid. We cant 
follow the sun in every single line of. 
49.21 
P1 No  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  402 
P3 No, No No, I am suggesting that PS comes from..  
P1 ..comes from the fact that you are able to offload it almost at the end of the day 
or the end of your shift. Actually, actually I notice that with sales people, are 
ummm can be , I guess they operate in a world in which PS can be sort of a bit 
up and down in a day cos they are getting yes no decisions all the time, umm and 
having, whenever I am managing a sales person directly, will always ring them 
first thing and at the end of the day that is the best way that you can keep a sales 
guy Buoyed up and kind of ready for the next day because you leave it overnight 
they will sit and dwell on the fact that they didnt win that deal or they got a bad 
email or theyve not progressed something, so if you dont catch them at the end 
of the day, the next day is a much harder job to get them back up again and get 
them out and, pick up a boxer -  get out there, come onumm so yeah its that 
touch point at the beginning of the day and the end of the day that makes a big 
difference and I guess thats what you miss with Kirk in that you cant you can 
do it at the beginning of the day but at the end of the day hes there going 
hmmmm 
49.36 
P5 Weve tried to alleviate that by putting somebody in Boston so he has somebody 
to bounce  but its still hard 
50.41 
P1 Its still hard yeah  
P4 So its different forms of communication, so whether its 8 hours, every 12 hours, 
every 8 hours or every 4 hours it just having somebody to talk to  ..????? 
50.51 
P5 I think ?????  teams especially designers want to bounce things off people  
P2 And we are all geared up to be very ??? we  encourage. We cant say that these 
people can bounce ideas and these cant, we cant do that. 
F Look, what I am hearing you say, especially with your sales analogy there, that 
the responsibility for PS is almost entirely in the hands of the manager, agree, 
disagree? 
51.18 
P2 Primarily but not entirely, I think that yes it is predominantly the managers role 
but there is certain aspect of what the other person is like, does he seek support 
in the right ways, communication in the right ways 
51.32 
P1 Yeah I mean, your first word there, willing, any of us, youve gotta be willing to 
show and do this stuff, so if you are not willing to do that stuff it doesnt matter 
how enabling your manager is or what a good job your manager is doing at 
making you feel able to do it, if you are not willing to do it. 
51.50 
F So why would you not be willing to do it? 52.13 
P6 Cos they dont feel psychologically safe  
P2 Yes, thats probably it.  
F So if the willing is making the environment such that that the individual is willing 
to come to you or phone you at 11 at night or reach out and they are willing to 
do it because the environment is safe for them, what do they need to be ABLE, 
what skills set do they need to be ABLE to help themselves feel PS as well. 
Because can it all be in the hands of the manager/organisation? 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  403 
P5 You have to be able to understand consequence and not be frightened of them, 
consequence so some people are naturally more err nervous than others when it 
comes to have I met my goal, have I not met my goal umm and the older you get, 
the more you ask the question, actually, you know, what does this matter to the 
price of fish and  experience allows lots of us to go, actually it isnt as frightening 
as I might of thought it was previously and if youve got people who are anxious 
because they are imposing their own standard of measure on that then theyre 
going to impose a level of fright on themselves 
52.51 
P1 Yeah paralysing kind of thing 53.39 
P5 Yeah and if they dont have the confidence then to, to work out how to address 
that and they dont have the tool kit to go actually no-body died 
P1 The sun still came up  
P5 The sun still came up in the morning you know, so its as much about your own 
reactions to events as it is about what the manager can do, what the process can 
do what the procedure can do  
53.52 
P2 It is your reactionChantal picked that up nicely, it, it is the environment you 
work in basically. Ive been in blame environments where mistakes is punished 
straightway and I think thats the worst environment 
54.04 
P4 Yeah but it was your fault 54.16 
 <laughter>  
P6 That why he left  
P2 So this is one, er  or the ???? one,  so thats, thats my view, I mean, if, if you 
make the environment, if you make the environment, the work environment, the 
culture a blame culture in the team, the ???? wherever, then you wont get 
happy people. 
54.23 
P5 I get that but the question was about what could the individual do. 54.41 
F ..So assuming that you guys  
P1 ..Some people, some people wear that responsibility greater dont they..  
P5 .On the assumption that we have created a safe environment, what does and 
individual bring to that equation was how I understood 
F Yes, so you have articulated beautifully all of the environmental aspects that 
would make somebody willing, so you are creating safety by communicating with 
people, supporting them, being there for them all those great things. So youve 
come here..so what does the individual need to do? Now I am hearing 
experience, agility, you mentioned self-confidence, so when you are looking to 
bring somebody in to your wonderfully safe environment, what do you need 
them to have to flourish and be able to show themselves? 
P2 Good Question I would say not to be afraid to make mistakes and learn from 
them, I dunno if thats the only thing but thats.. 
55.34 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  404 
P1 That is something that kind of need to learn, you know, you dont not everyone 
has that naturally in them, oh yeah I can make mistakes and well all be fine, Ill 
learn from them. Actually the human reaction, I see this in Harriet actually my 8 
year old, its like, you criticise her, floods of tears and its like..awwww you know, 
but actually even if you do it in the most constructive positive way, and say hay 
you know, lets learn from this no-one is cross she still kind of wells up and thats 
the sort of, there is a human instinct there which is dont want to be perceived to 
55.43 
F But does that go back to your adult statement? 56.15 
P1 Well yeah maybe yeah  
P3 To me it does  
F Cos that could be a defence mechanism 56.19 
P1 Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean.  
P5 To me the more experience you gain in the work environment or work in 
generally, the safer you feel in yourselfmistakes will happen period. Youve got 
to learn from them rather than oh my god what did I do. 
56.23 
F  So its taking your experience and when, when, you trip and fall its about 
learning from that erm and building on your, your experience as well. OK. Umm 
in the people who, when we were talking about the guys who were having these 
discussions, everyone wants to be heard, errrmm, are there any, ermm  I am 
trying the phrase the question..erm are there anywhat do they need to think 
or believe when they are contributing?  
56.44 
P3 That they are being listened to 57.25 
F That they are being heard  
P2 That their opinion matters that their view matters, but not just a monkey ??? 
????? 
so you need to you need to drive forward for that sort of interaction  
57.29 
P3 They need to understand that they have respect 57.46 
P1  No one wants to be ridiculed. Laughter  
P5 I think they also need to know what they should give you for you to believe they 
are succeeding. Cos a lot,  I have various members, some that gookfor me to 
.. some literally dont ring you at all and you are forever chasing them, other 
ones are like OK for you to feel confident that I am doing stuff what do you 
need? And if you start ???  its a lot easier than having to chase them what you 
done duh duh duh  err as opposed to the one that says what do you need from 
me and then I have the others who literally come in and go bleurghOK so 
youve got bleurgh so what do you want me to do with it. They dont want me 
to do anything with it they  just wanna go bleugh. And this can happen every 
day. And you, so you vary what you do with various individuals 
57.58 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  405 
F So from your perspective the preference is out of the ones you have to chase and 
the ones that come to you and go this is what Ive done, what is the ones that 
say this is what Ive done have or do that is different from the ones you have to 
chase,.  What do you think theyve got. What makes a difference? 
58.48 
P5 I think they are more confident in their role of what they should deliver,   
F So what do we do about the new starters, the youngsters coming in cos we do 
have a challenge globally around talent, that a lot of.essentially we are all 
getting older, and we having to bring in new talent who maybe dont have that 
experience so what do we need to look for. They havent got the experience so 
what do we need? 
59.19 
P2 So, OK,  in my view, the first thing is when you select a candidate, you look for 
some traits not just knowledge, you are looking for ability to learn, to 
communicate you are looking for intelligence, you are looking for problem 
solving, you are looking for go to attitudes, you are looking for a number of 
things that is not necessarily what the CV says and there is no easy ways to 
assess it but there are ways 
59.40 
F There are  
P2 So you are looking for the type of person, if that new starter has those traits its a 
lot easier to put them in the team and you know start them up as team members 
basically. With other individuals who may have all the technical abilities but less 
the attitude it may be more difficult. They could be very valuable to the team but 
it might what you are going to get productive in part, members of the team 
basically, so it does depend a lot on how you select those individuals but theres 
always, I mean obviously not about training, but they need training to 
understand what the job is, what the product is, what theyre expected etc etc  
but its not just that, I think some individuals have talents that not everyone has 
P3 Its making Individuals like that feel safe and it used to be called apprenticeships 
in my day. 
1.00.59 
F They are coming back  
P3 And I am very glad to see that because thats,  that is the way you harness and 
bolster the soft side  of peoples ability, so you have the ability side of it which is 
absolutely right, but they dont know how to apply that until, and and it is a 
process of learning in the same way weve all had to learn it and some of us have 
learnt it through hard knocks and some of us have learnt it because we have 
been part of an apprenticeship . 
1.01.04 
P5 So weve been interviewing graduates recently whove had no work experience 
and its a, its a very different process because you look for something that they 
are engaged in to see if they are errmm passionate about something so that then 
you can go, OK, so can I put that elsewherethey dont know how to answer 
interview questions so you might end up talking about football because thats 
what they know. 
1.01.36 
P1 Yes, but thats what you want to hear about isnt it  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  406 
P5  Yeah. So its a very different process, so you know theyve got some sort of 
educational background but you need to bring out their characteristics cos 
ultimately you wanna, can I work with this person, erm are their 
characteristicswhen they talk about something that they are passionate, is it 
engaging or is it just arrogant and there are a very fine line so thats what were 
looking for at the moment. Not the arrogant 
1.02.09 
 <laughter>  
P2 I was wondering  
P5 To me is a very, its a  weird interview compared to the normal one which are 
skilled based 
1.02.36 
P1 Which is skills based  
F Yeah, yeah. And you mentioned intelligence there, you mentioned intelligence 
umm, what do you mean by intelligence, because it,  from a psychological 
perspective thats a gamut of stuff 
1.02.44 
P1 Yeah  
P2 Intelligence is, is, is very difficult to pin down, I think to me its ability to adapt to 
situations, unknown situations. When I evaluate someone who doesnt 
necessarily have the the knowledge base, but how can you adapt to a situation 
you know nothing about, what are,  whats your chain of thought, how would 
you think about, attack that situation, resolve that problem  
1.02.55 
P5 For me its problem solving and sort of logical thinking. 1.03.25 
P2 I think we are saying the same thing  
P5 Cos thats sort of my team area  
P3 Id add emotional intelligence to that as well 1.03.34 
P2 Ah, yeah, yeah  
P5 They cry during the interview 1.03.37 
P3 You know, it has been known  
 <laughter>  
F Yeah, this um its intersecting cos you were saying one of the earlier you were 
saying about being able to plan, and if you could plan your day yet at the same 
time, we, whos day ever goes to plan and now your saying, right your saying well 
actually what you want is somebody who can adapt depending on what the day 
throws at you. 
P2 Yeah exactly,  I mean the best, the best, those that we took on board as new 
starters in a team work the best are those who have the ability to think through 
problems in different ways lateral thinking kind of people that didt get bogged 
down in if that doesnt work, lets trybrand new approach to a problem. 
Maybe we should do something a bit different. Those are the ones who always 
seem to have the best contribution to the company even 
1.04.06 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  407 
F Uh huh, Yeah. So the are bringing new thoughts, new ideas ,, 1.04.44 
P2 Yes, they dont get bogged down in old ways, same ways. 1.04.48 
P3 I think they reap success quicker perhaps as well umm because theyve got 
brains that allow them to back out of an alleyway and try another one whereas 
there are others who will just bang their heads against a brick wall and then cry. 
P5 The precondition is the environment that they work in has to allow them to do 
that 
F  Thats right  
P3  Correct  
P5 and it doesnt always work that way 1.05.15 
F No it doesnt and I think you are right, theres been a a I mean theres been a lot 
of work done over the years around the environment, I mean starting with 
Maslow and Hertzberg, I mean long time that we need the environment for, to 
get innovation, we need to feel safe and have a supportive managerall those 
things we have talked about absolutelyl. There has been less research done on 
how far does the, what do we need from the individual to meet the.because 
you could have the fantastic safe environment who is intelligent but what I am 
hearing you say its not just about being smart, or intelligent its about being 
smart, agile, adaptable. So to out that together with the environment then you 
are going to get quite a powerful productive employee. And yeah, the 
organisation has a part to play but so does the individual and there has been less 
research on that individual piece. 
P5  I IT companies there is a hell of a lot of change, constantly and I think thats very 
new to organisation for all of us, big massive organisation change where they 
split divisions, we have is almost daily weekly.. 
1.06.15 
P1 Yeah the organisation almost reforms every day almost  depending on what 
todays challenge is and thats, thats how it should be as thats how we will 
succeed. Some people love it .. 
1.06.31 
P5 .Some people thrive in that, some people hate it  
P1 ..Yeah some people hate it  
F So whats the difference between the two, the people who thrive and the people 
who hate it because its not going away 
1.06.43 
P I suspect its something to do with erm people feeling err confident and 
happiness with the way things are and people who are pushing for change for 
good reasons. Not everyone likes change, not everyone wants to rock the boat as 
much. They want the boat to go faster, but they dont want to change direction 
necessarily rather ??? the thing is how much will the company let or allow them 
to change direction or rock the boat. In terms of objectives and how things are

Ive been in companies where thats the way you do it, dont care about your 
ideas, do it that way because everyone else does it that way the company says 
thats the problem, go fix it now that way 
F But those are, I mean from a research perspective, those kind of organisations 
are gonna struggle in this changing environment because as an organisation you 
need to be agile and what worked in the past may not work in the future 
because we are coming up with new stuff all the time, new technology is the big 
driver which is why we are focusing on this. So if youve got this changing 
environment, if you use your boat analogy, you know, some people are gonna 
like roll with the waves and other people are gonna get really really sea sick  
1.07.46 
P1 You definitely, I mean you definitely need people who are open minded and it 
comes back to that willingness to make mistakes or be prepared to make 
mistakes and willingness to learn and recognise that you dont know everything, I 
mean generally people that havent thrived over at <Company name> the years 
are ones who come in thinking that, you know,  they know everything, it needs 
to be their way, theyre the best and everyone should follow them kind of thing. 
And its like that works on day 1 or 2 when actually we need their skillset,  then 
stuff changes and a week or two later, if they are still having the attitude of yeah 
I know everything, it should be my way, theyre not open minded, theyre not 
listening to everyone else they are not reacting, the agility you know and all that 
sort of stuff and so the people who thrive here tend to be more, well, I dont 
know everything, this situation, Ive never been in this situation before Ok, who 
do I need to help me solve this, or lets find a way to get round this 
problemermm  
1.08.14 
P2 Its a fine line cos many people think that we are paid to design by committee 
and those people will think that the only right way of doing it is actually 
collecting good ideas and then distilling it into something 
1.09.07 
P1 Yeah youre right, you cant all, you cant spend all day in a big room with 
everybody you know, its not a democracy, you cant all, if we all said, right, how 
do we make a decision lets all vote on it 
1.09.19 
P2 You cant do that but then you have to make sure its a forum to get people to 
contribute ideas 
1.09.30 
P1 Yeahtheres a ???  problem, how do we solve it, what options have we got, lets 
try and get as many options onto  the table as we can 
1.09.37 
P2  And someone has to make a decision at some point because thats the way it 
works. Its taking in views, its understanding that theres not just one way of 
doing things thats important for a company 
1.09.42 
P3 I think we need to look at their skills sets as well and make sure they are brought 
along  because  we, you know they come with a certain amount and if we are are 
changing constantly they may ??? and become obsolete 
1.09.54 
P1 Yep, and where they might feel PS for a while, suddenly its whoa.. 1.10.06 
P5 YeahI dunno how to use this.  
F And thats happening all the time in technology yeah 1.10.13 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  409 
P2 All the time, all the time.  
F You were an SME you know, in this, now we are not using this and so you are just 
minion like everybody else and that causes people to, you know their status has 
gone, you know thats a real wobbler for people 
1.10.15 
P5 Absolutely 1.10.28 
F a huge wobbler  
P1 Yeah  you can imagine people being quite defensive as they see that happening, 
they become more and more defensive with their decision making to protect 
1.10.30 
F So what could that individual do, again there are things that the organisation can 
do, train them, support them etc but what could that individual do, in order to, 
where they feel they are becoming less safe because of this scenario, what do 
you think they could do to, to get themselves up 
1.10.39 
P Its counter intuitive, but what they need do is to give, to give, you know dedicate 
time to retraining or training right and thats not easy to do in a development 
environment. They have to learn new stuff and they may not even want to 
anymore 
1.10.55 
P4 Its beeing able to say I am not adding value anymore 1.11.09 
P1 Thats the first thing. Recognising it isnt it 1.11.12 
P4 A very brave thing to say  
 Yeah  
P2 I am useless  
 <laughter>  
P1 I  off to the dump, off to the compost heap  
P4 The individual has to have the confidence in themselves I have to do this,  I 
recognise that when I joined the company of this size I added value, it now this 
size, it changed, I dont add much value now so I.. 
1.11.23 
P1 So again its the relationship isnt it between the organisation and you as an 
individual cos  you would hope the organisation, as soon as you start making 
those noises, would say hey come on, dont worry about it, lets, you can do this, 
there is an opportunity over here, we are growing, opening up all the time  
1.11.38 
P5 We need some people stand up and say, Ok this is new. Id like to be involved in 
this if they dont have skills set 
1.11.54 
P1 Oh ok yeah yeah you right, them willing to volunteer at least   
P3  What if they dont have the skill set?  
P5 We can help that  
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  410 
F Yes cos that again thats meeting the organisation half way rather than dragging 
them through this new training 
1.12.12 
P5 Yeah its always better to retrain somebody than bring somebody totally in again, 
its far much more effort making sure they fit with the culture, make sure they 
have all background, its far easier to train somebody if they are willing 
1.12.17 
P2 Its very interesting because I think not everyone born in this world has the same 
capability for change some people are able  to take change in their stride, some 
people are much slower to adapt I dont  
1.12.33 
P3 Is that a capability or an appetite? 1.12.49 
P5 No, ability I have an example of a person who is actually very intelligent but just 
cant adapt he cant accelerate his way of life, he cant do more than small 
strides  
P3 Yeah, my question is, is that because they have less of an appetite for change 
rather than 
1.13.04 
P1 ..a particular skill  
P3 Whether they are capable of change  
P5 I cant answer that directly, indirectly I can see, I can see how much they suffer 
because of they because  are not able to follow what others are doing because 
they are not able to you know, react in the same way, they are not able to go as 
far they are not able, they just feel miserable in some cases 
1.13.12 
P3 But it would be interesting to understand whether that that thing is due to the 
fact that they dont feel that they have a skill set or they dont want to make a 
commitment for a skill set or just dont understand how to fit in  
1.13.37 
P5 This is second information, but the person in question whos in our greater family  
went to a psychological and was told, I am not an expert so I dont know I am just 
repeating information here is that not everyone has the same abilities to, I mean, 
the example the person gave is if you are going from London to Glasgow by car, 
right, you  may just be able to go that far in the car, you are the car going all the 
way to Glasgow you may be another car that may not be able to reach Glasgow 
basically because you dont have that stamina you may have to stop over, sleep, 
so I dont know how true that is but thats the response 
1.13.52 
P1 But actually something, a physical capability of, of. 1.14.38 
P2 mental, mental more than physical  
P1 Mental..capable of change  
P2 Is it becausehes not young so maybe because he learned through his life that 
thats what you have to do 
1.14.47 
P1 ??? under their control, well well, some people have to be in control or they 
need to feel in control of whats going on, whats happening to them whereas 
other people are a bit more like oh yeah you know, I get,  I get the fact that I 
cant control everything and theres a big world out there that gonna happen to 
me and I have to learn how to deal with it. 
1.14.57 
University of Reading 
S.A.Mather Student No:bq105606  411 
P5 The fact that some people take it as a personal insult so the fact that youve 
moved technology is obviously your fault, we didnt want you getting in the 
technology, its nothing to do with you 
1.15.15 
F But again youve got a very child response there, I dont know if you are familiar 
with the work of Eric Berne, Parent, Adult, Child, transactional analysis 
1.15.25 
P6 We did it in ??? very recently 1.15.33 
F Yeah, so any, that that defensiveness is a very child response and it happens. 
Absolutely, 
Interesting, thank you.any final contributions. 
1.15.35 
P5 Has two hours gone? 1.15.52 
F No, its half past but I am wrapping up now, we are going to start to wrap up.  
P2 Any other contributions <reference to food>  
F Get stuck in, anything that doesnt get eaten will be tossed out to the masses  
P2 Oh, we dont want that then.  
P5 Get choffing then  
F Um, in return I thought, I might share something with you, I tell you what Ill 
close the focus group and then Ill share something that is relevant, I think its 
relevant. 
So thank you for that, I have ermm some really great stuff there and what I have 
for you is a debrief letter which is basically a thank you and if you are interested 
in what we are talking about, there are some articles here that you can have a 
look at particularly from Kahn and Edmondson. None of them did work in these 
VUCA environments,  this is why I think a lot of the models that we use are kind 
of outdated now umm, Edmondson worked in healthcare, she did something in 
an office supplies company, but it was mainly healthcare and Kahn did his in an 
architectural firm in the 1990s. so no one has done this of research in these kind 
of fast moving environment, so maybe in two years time you can add my name 
to that as well so, umm but it just tells you really what the process is < take one 
and pass it one>  and how,  if you wanted to contact me how you could and I will 
keep in touch with the report section.

1 For Section A, in attempting to put things into perspective, I need to follow Prabhus (2016) 
philosophy in that if I can do something about it, then I should not worry about it as I can 
change it. More importantly though, not worrying about things I cannot influence or change.  
I also need to stop creating automatic negative thoughts and instead need to grow a positive 
mind-set.  
1 1 1      
2 Currently I catastrophize too much so need to rationalize these thoughts.  According to Rock 
(2008, cited in Aiken/University of Stellenbosch Business School, 2018) my catastrophizing 
thoughts are a result of my SCARF triggers being stimulated and so they activate the limbic 
part of my brain. If the limbic part of the brain continues to be stimulated, then this will 
cause the neocortex part of the brain to shut down, which is the part of the brain used for 
reasoning. If this is shut down, this will result in you not being able to think rationally, which 
is clearly the case why I start catastrophizing my thoughts. 
3 In order to stop catastrophizing, I will look to adopt the 3Rs approach (WatchWellCast, 2012) 
so if I am feeling stressed, I will record these events or talk about them with someone, 
rationalise these thoughts and then replace them with a rational thought. This should mean 
that the outcome will be a more limbic and rational response. Pedlers et al.,. (2013b, p136) 
catastrophic contingencies is another model I could use.  Effective use of the models will 
then contribute to improved resilience, happier thoughts and a more developed individual.

4 The 3 models that we went through that I think have given me the biggest moment of 
reflection are Ikigai, (Garcia and Miralles, 2017) Growth vs Fixed Mindset and The healthy 
mind platter (Siegel, 2011). With these in mind and looking what I wrote back then Im aware 
my life is out of balance at the moment, Im not open minded and I havent lived my live 
according to the healthy mind platter.

5 In addition having not heard about the Ikigai model (Garcia and Miralles, 2017) before and 
through this module being introduced to us, has genuinely made me realise that I have to 
find that balance in life again, where every comes together in harmony, but to do that I have 
to work out in my own head where that happy place is in my life, through honest self-
reflection and really looking inwards to get to know myself better again. 
6 One other item we went through as part of the module is Fixed vs. Growth Mindset. I 
definitely have been very much in the Fixed Mindset since I returned to the UK in 2014, 
whereas before I lived my life according to the Growth Mindset. I written this down as one of 
my development opportunities, I want to change it. 
7 my appreciation of Ikigai and the fact that true growth comes from the personal desire to 
achieve not from my direction to them. Overall I have found this module very rewarding and 
it is one that will benefit both my personal and professional life as well as that of the 
members of my team.  
8 Having a Growth Mind-set has allowed me to understand that intelligence isnt something 
you are born with but something you can teach. To fail is simply the First Attempt in 
Learning. (Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam.) 
9 The material I have outlined has given me a greater understanding of who I am and why I 
respond the way I do. It has allowed me to manage my emotions better and feel more in 
control of my development 
10 To give an example looking at the Healthy Mind Platter (Rock & Siegel 2011) I struggled to 
find one area on the platter that I actually allowed myself to spend any time on.  I have come 
to the conclusion throughout the last 6 months that I am a workaholic and that I need to 
seriously take some time out for myself and my family.

11 I need to review my Values and think about myself and what is important to me in life, what 
drives me, challenge my beliefs that drives my behaviour (Material presented in Henley 
Business School on Personal Effectiveness Module on 21 May 2019). If I would have used 
Ikigai, I would have had much better set and more meaningful Purpose. Ikigai for me seems 
like a happy and meaningful life formula. I will need to spend time reflecting and analysing 
myself to understand my values, my beliefs and if I get this right, my behaviour should reflect 
it and should be able to set better goals and actions. I reflected and I understood that I have 
started to shift my thought process, which is positive. It was because of realization of areas 
that I need to change and work on, because I kept reflecting. I started to reflect after a 
negative feedback by my team, about me being negative. I was able to control myself and 
responded quite differently. I took in everything that has been said, I listened and then 
reflected as I spoke before in this essay why I was acting in this way (Peters, 2012). 
 1 1 1  1   
12 I can recognise instances where I have fallen into a fixed mindset, which has perhaps 
impaired my ability to continue to grow. it was not something I had done before out of fear 
that the team would have less respect for me if they knew I had development areas, and 
indeed what those areas were. Deeper questioning has led me to understand that this feeling 
stemmed from my own belief that in order to be a good leader, one must portray only 
strength and not weakness. This I feel originates from my early days of education where 
success and accomplishment were rewarded, whereas poor performance was almost 
shameful. I realise that whilst I carry the belief that weaknesses are a stigma and should 
not be publically acknowledged, I will never be able to develop an environment of 
celebrating success and failure, as in my improved PDP goal. I need to change my way of 
thinking, and actively compel myself to be more open so that it becomes easier over time. 
This will need reinforcement as I already note in my Personal Journal I need to make sure 
that I continue to focus on sharing my thoughts and feelings with the team in order to 
encourage an environment of trust and sharing (Personal Journey, December

13 I have been able to see growth in my thinking. However, no more so than within the area of 
mindsets. What has been interesting to discover is how I, at the time, applied the mindset 
thinking to situations in which I faced

14 The theory around mindsets and in particular the Limbic system by Rock (2008) provided a 
detailed overview of a suggested protection mechanism the brain will process when faced 
with a situation that may provoke a response. In one example called out within my journal I 
have stated: The SCARF framework discussed by Rock (2008) outlines how Status, 
Consistency, Autonomy, Relatedness and Fairness can play a role as we assess a given 
situation. This has been highly prominent in recent weeks given the return of my line 
manager from maternity leave. I have faced into certain situations where I felt threatened by 
her presence. I stopped at this point and did not explore this further. Having explored and 
assessed my own values, it is clear my feeling of being threatened is in part due to my sense 
of independence and accomplishment. I felt as though my role was being taken away from 
me and put up a guard against that.

15 Another aspect of mindsets that resonated within my personal journal was that of Automatic 
Thoughts (Watch Wellcast, 2012) where it was suggest that to overcome overthinking and 
creating disasters in your mind that the 3Rs should be used. Record, Rationalise and Replace 
are suggested as the best way to simplify the problems faced and almost normalise them 
into smaller tasks to ensure less fear. Within my journal I have touched on this I am 
currently on secondment into my role and I am exceptionally nervous about having to return 
to my old role as it is not my desire to move back. That said, the future of my current role is 
also uncertain given budget stretches. This short exert is a critical insight into how I am 
building problems within my head and not thinking clearly around my future career paths 
with clarity and confidence. This again links into findings by Bandura and Locke (2003) 
around a loss of engagement due to doubt. The whole argument around mindsets links into 
the wider research by Rock et al., (2011) around the Healthy Mind Platter and how the seven 
boxes need aligned to ensure optimal wellbeing. Indeed Gray (2015) has even suggested that 
the Healthy Mind Platter may be beneficial rolled out across whole organisations. As 
discussed earlier, my work/life balance is suffering, as also touched on within my journal: 
My working time has increased markedly since I started covering for my manager who left 
for maternity in 2018. I feel a commitment to my managers to ensure I am on top of 
everything. It may be beneficial for me to start recording my feelings via the Gibbs (1998) 
reflective model. Indeed, Gibbs even suggests that additional competence can occur through 
using the reflective mode. The Gibbs (1998) study is reinforced by Sherwood et al., (2018) 
who comments that reflective models may even add confidence and help colleagues find 
meaning to their work. Grey (2015) comments leaders must learn to value downtime as 
essential and goes on to comment that companies should actively encourage downtime to 
ensure colleagues have coping mechanisms. A similar study of workplace stress was 
completed at EY (Wachman, 2011) and discovered downtime was essential as part of the 
Healthy Mind Platter (Rock et al., 2012). This would strengthen the argument that to 
succeed, my work:life balance needs addressed and it also needs the full support of my lune 
manager.

16 One assessment that I used for the initial three goals was based around the Japanese 
concept of Ikigai, which is explained by Miralles & Garcias (2017) book, also called Ikigai. 
The process involves considering what you love, what the world needs, what you can be paid 
for and what youre good at. I found this to be a useful method which helped to identify that 
a prior career goal would be likely to impact other areas important to me. 
17 I would have loved for the Values topic to have been moved further forwards in the 
curriculum.  I believe this learning would be invaluable and powerful if it were to be 
discussed alongside emotional intelligence.  I have learnt so much about myself.  
Understanding the way I think, the way I feel, why I feel that way, what I want and why I 
want it has been somewhat of an epiphany to me.   
18 Ikigai is a Japanese concept meaning a reason for being and is something I found useful 
when thinking about improving my PDP. When assessing what I love alongside what I am 
good at versus what the world needs and what I could be paid for, it became easier to 
identify some key areas I want to move towards within my PDP.  To discover your Ikigai, you 
must first find what youre more passionate about. Then, you find the medium through 
which you can express that passion. (Myers, 2018) I find this way of describing it very 
thought-provoking and really related to it. My purpose in life has always been very clear to 
me  to help people. It is something that comes naturally to me. Without consciously doing 
so, I naturally take the position of leader, of using my skills of persuasion, negotiation and 
communication. This feeds my passion and desire to help others and to make things better 
for others. 
19 that I have found useful in thinking about is you cannot always change a situation but you 
can change how you react to it. There are many things out of our control and what is the 
point of upsetting myself when there is nothing I can do about it. Sams reference to being 
stuck in traffic at the last session was a great example.

20 I competed my own Ikigai. I found that by doing this that I realised that I was good at my job, 
and I get paid for it, but I am not passionate about it, and I certainly do not love it. My job 
provides for my family who I do love.  The only thing I really I do love about my job is the 
feeling of being valued by my manager, who is often full of praise towards me (although I 
often dismiss it and do not see in me what he does).   I have had to ask myself;  Did I/Do I 
have Ikigai if I was doing something that I am good at and paid for, even though I do not love 
it. What I get out of it provides for, and helps pay for some of the things that I do love? When 
all was considered, my answer was no, I am not quite at my Ikigai. I felt I was somewhere 
between satisfaction but feeling of uselessness and comfortable, but feeling of 
emptiness At this point in my life, I had never even considered mission or vocation.  
21 The next area of interest for me was the Ikigai model which broadly means purpose or 
reason for being.  This also intrigued me as a tool for self-reflection.  I am a big believer in 
balance.  Whilst the path of life can often be bumpy, if you are lucky enough to really care 
about the profession you find yourself in or indeed feel that you are making a difference to 
the things that are important to you, then you will naturally perform to higher standard.  I 
believe the Ikigai model helps cut through some of this uncertainty and provide an anchor 
point to really hone in on effective reflection, and probably more importantly allows for the 
start of a possible new direction in which both personal and professional fulfilment which 
can be applied to both my trajectory and that of others.  
22 In addition I have spent more time working on Ikigai. Ikigai is about finding joy, fulfilment, 
and balance in the daily routine of life (Forbes, Feb 23, 2018).I truly enjoy my job but I 
cannot say its my passion, I still do not know what my passion is however I do know I am 
truly passionate about helping others and I have strong interest in the environment. To this 
extent perhaps my adventure in self-employment should centre around helping others and 
the environment so perhaps my business will be one of training and consulting on helping 
business be more aware of environmental impact and how they can improve. 
23 I focused on the outputs of the Growth Mindset quix [sic] - it was an interesting outcome for 
me. I actually scored quite low and only just scraped through into the Growth mindset with 
some fixed ideas. This was a revelation to me.

24 Self awareness of my emotions has been paramount in learning achieved. An understanding 
of our brain has various areas, particularly the limbic system with specifically the amigdala 
[sic] holds all the emotional memory and hold out flight or fight mode. Using the RRR 
concept has changed how I now  deal with these overcoming thoughts I face and help me 
rationalise.  
 1 1   1   
25 This journey of learning has been life changing: first determining and knowing what my 
values are and where this stems from and how this has come through to my beliefs and 
behaviours, then having the tools to further self-analysis. This has given me the confidence to 
not be afraid to ask for help.  
26 I have been able to see the growth in my thinking; no more so that within the area of mind-
sets.  What has been interesting to discover is how I, at the time, applied the mind set 
thinking to situations in which I faced. However in hindsight I would tackle the situations 
differently. 
27 . I now understand what my life career and {name} do actually fit all 4 aspects of my Ikigai. 
This was a profound moment for me when I saw the frameworks and thought actually I am 
right to feel driven and care about my career for that is my vocation. In my reflective journal 
I wrote for this light bulb and its ok. 
28 Prior to completing the growth mind set questionnaire I would have said I was someone who 
was very open to change and actually embraces it  a live work example being the 
introduction of robotics into my team this year. When I completed the questionnaire I scored 
the lowest on my table of four peers in growth, it wasnt a particularly low score but I was on 
the cusp and this surprised me, I also felt surprised I was the lowest of all five colleagues sat 
around the table. I have given this some thought over the last few months and re-visited my 
questionnaire to analyse where my mind set is perhaps more closed. There was specifically a 
few areas that I did mark myself lower and now recognise they areas need to continue to be 
a focus so I can to grow and be the best leader possible. I found the exercise so thought 
provoking that I reached out to the tutor at Henley to gain a copy so I could complete the 
exercise with my six team managers. I want that to go on the same journey that I did and 
hope they find the exercise thought provoking too with a view if perhaps they are of a fixed

mind set this personal exercise will open their eyes to that so with the support of me we can 
try to develop them into a new evolving growth mind set.  
29 A theory that resonated with me was the Gibbs (Davies 2012) reflective theory, I like that this 
theory gives structure to learning from feelings and experiences. As mentioned previously 
reflecting is something that neither I nor wider team do well; we always seem to jump to the 
next initiative or thing on our task list. In my reflective journal when discussing Gibbs I wrote 
down Know I should do this, but do I? At the time of writing this in my reflective journal I 
already knew the answer  I dont take time to reflect and I dont follow the structure of the 
Gibbs theory. I like Gibbs theory as I appreciate you must reflective in order to do something 
better the next time and to be constantly learning. In my day job I do want to be the best I 
possibly can be and now recognise I need to proactively reflective whether that be post a 
challenging conversation with a colleague or on something bigger such as a project. 
Regardless of the situation to truly be the best I can be I need to ensure I introduce reflecting 
into my career and chose to follow the gibbs reflective theory as it is my favourite and the 
one which I have found to resonate the most with me personally.  
30 Ikigai & understanding my values: Ikigai as outlined was a real eye opener for me, previously 
objectives were based around development  often what you didnt enjoy doing. With my 
purpose in mind, I can take forward the concept into how I progress my career, how I 
interact with others and my team. Understanding my values will also be incorporated into my 
day to day reflection 
31 Self-Management  If you are controlled by words then those who speak those words will 
have a degree of control over me. The three circles model by Covey was something I had 
heard of yet to my regret not explored . For me it rightly sets parts of my life into or in some 
cases straddling the lines between Concern, Influence and Control. Staring to map my work 
and outside life into this model has demonstrated to me that surprising those in the direct 
control of me are fewer than those on the outside of concern where I have little control. That 
said a positive mindset and good focused attitude are within my control and can quickly have 
a disproportionate positive effect on say what people think of me, how I gain their trust and 
collaborate with them.

33 the whole reflection process which was required as part of this essay, has made me truly 
consider and accept the person and leader I am today and actions I need to undertake to 
allow me to achieve the leader I strive to be.  
34 the Gibbs Reflective model (Gibbs, 1989) was brought to mind this week when I had an 
interaction with my line managers manager, the area director who was visiting my branch 
for the first time  At the time I was really frustrated with the feedback, and in fact quite 
angry. But as I work through the steps in the Gibbs Reflective model as quoted above, I found 
that I could make sense of his approach to the conversation and in fact if I were to have 
noticed this earlier and done something differently, the conversation would never have 
needed to happen. Upon this reflection I have now put in place an action plan which, if 
successful, should take me all the way through the model with what I hope will be a good 
result. Something else that really inspired and interested me as part of my learning was 
Evolution Theory of the Three Brains. This was formulated by neuroscientist Paul D. MacLean 
(The Triune Brain in evolution, 1990) in the 1960s. His theory was the that brain has 3 
distinctive structures. I think for me what I found fascinating about the above is how all of 
this is interlinked and how you can train yourself to be more logical by trying to control your 
Limbic System (or inner chimp as it is sometimes called  can be like the naughty part of the 
brain). I will definitely consider this going forward and will reflect on this as part of my 
learning. I feel this has already opened my eyes and showed me that it is not just key skills 
from information that can help you move forward as a manager, but also training your brain

to react to different situations / scenarios or learning skills as coping mechanisms can also 
enhance your development.  
35 My values will change this year and become more family orientated as others will be relying 
on me. Figuring this out has helped me understand what is truly important to me, how I see 
success and what items should therefore be on my development plan. 
36 There are several learnings I have taken and would adopt into the workplace.  
My first would be around understanding how you assess yourself to find out whats important 
to you. To do this, you need access to the right tools and techniques and time away from the 
day job to adequately think about whats important. You need the right time and 
environment to think through why you are here and what you want to achieve. These two 
questions can underpin your whole development journey. 
The second task I would implement is finding your value. This was a really important piece of 
learning for me and I think it would help colleagues focus in on what their current values are 
and which value they can use to help shape their PDP. 
The third assessment style learning I would introduce is around Ikigai. Do people really know 
what their purpose is? Do they know what skills and capabilities they have? How can I help 
them with this? 
The fourth learning is reflection. I have learnt that I have not been taking enough time to 
reflect and I havent been doing it properly. I would encourage my peers and colleagues to 
do this at least monthly and I would facilitate this implementation by sharing my own story 
of reflection and how it helped me re-write my PDP and re-focus my life goals.
