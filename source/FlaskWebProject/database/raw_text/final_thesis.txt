PHENOMENOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF BEYOND THE STANDARD MODEL
THEORIES AT THE LHC - IN SEARCH OF DARK MATTER,
SUPERSYMMETRY AND OTHER NEW PHYSICS
Patrick Bernhard Schaefers
In this thesis, we study the phenomenological implications of different Beyond the Standard Model
(BSM) theories at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with a focus on the anomalous magnetic
moment of the muon a and dark matter (DM). We consider two Grand Unified Theory (GUT)
scale models, namely a Pati-Salam model with A4Z5 family symmetry as well as an SU(5) with
A4 family symmetry. After both models break down to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM), we study their capabilities of explaining a, DM and further collider and
non-collider constraints. We find that both models comprise a viable set of parameters leading
to distinctive solutions, provided the gaugino masses are non-universal. We also explore the
capability of models with extra vector resonances Z  to account for DM when combined with
a coloured vector-like top partner sector. We find that the presence of a Z  boson may greatly
improve the sensibility of the LHC to such models, especially in regions where non-collider searches
are considerably less sensitive. Finally, we study the potential of current and future hadron
colliders to narrow down the nature of the 2012 discovered scalar particle at the LHC, which
matches the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson astonishingly well so far. To further determine
whether this scalar may belong to a different BSM theory, we use an effective field theory to
study the unitarity violations arising from Higgs couplings to vector bosons slightly different as
compared to the SM. We find that triple Higgs production substantially benefits from non-SM
couplings and can be probed effectively at a 100 TeV future collider with high precision.

2.4 Viable scenarios in the a- (top) and a-M1 (bottom-left) as well as a-M2
(bottom-right) planes. Dark blue and red diamonds correspond to scenarios with
bino-like DM, whereas light green and orange triangles as well as turquoise and
salmon circles correspond to scenarios with mainly wino and partially higgsino-like
DM. The reddish points correspond to a separate scan around the isolated dark
blue point at small  in the top panel. The input parameters are shown in table 2.2. 30
2.5 Correlation between (Q) and M1. The left panel holds points satisfying the exper-
imental constraints from section 2.4, where the dark blue and red diamonds fulfil
both the relic density and a constraints, turquoise and salmon circles only have
the relic density in bounds (but not a), and light green and orange triangles
refer to points with neither the relic density nor a in bounds. The panel on the
right shows the same data, but with colour-coded LSP mass m01 for the inclusive
scan (blue points, see table 2.1) and the small  scan (red points, see table 2.2). . 31
2.6 Lightest neutralino mass vs. smuon masses. All dark blue diamonds are bino-like,
whereas the light green triangles and turquoise circles are wino-like. The orange
pentagons represent the benchmark points defined in table 2.3. . . . . . . . . . . . 32
2.7 Mass gaps between the smuon and lightest neutralino masses, mL/R and m01 . All
dark blue diamonds are bino-like, whereas the light green triangles and turquoise
circles are wino-like. The orange pentagons represent the benchmark points defined

the loop functions fN,C (x, y). The colour scale indicates the total value value of
a. The orange pentagons represent the benchmark points defined in table 2.3. . 35
2.9 Individual contributions a(i) with i = {A,B,C,D,E} of equation (2.13) versus
(Q). The colour scale indicates the total value value of a, while the black bars
in the top left panel show the 1 bound of a. The orange pentagons represent
the benchmark points defined in table 2.5. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37
2.10 M1(Q) vs. M2(Q) (left) and a smaller excerpt of it (right). All dark blue diamonds
are bino-like, whereas the light green triangles and turquoise circles are wino-like.

2.11 Mass gaps between the smuon and lightest neutralino masses, mL/R and m01 . All
dark blue diamonds are bino-like, whereas the light green triangles and turquoise
circles are wino-like. The orange pentagons represent the benchmark points defined

2.12 Mass differences between the LSP and NLSP compared to the LSP mass. In the
top left panel, the relic density is too small, whereas it is in bounds in the top right
panel. In the bottom panel, the relic density as well as a are in bounds. For the
entire figure, the LSP always is the lightest neutralino 01. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 41
2.13 a vs. h2. The top left panel holds the full parameter spectrum while the top
right panel holds a smaller excerpt of it with the grey shaded area being the 1
bound of a and h2. All dark blue diamonds are bino-like, whereas the light
green triangles and turquoise circles are wino-like. The orange pentagons represent
the benchmark points defined in table 2.5. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42
2.14 Vacuum stability analysis for a set of points in the large- region fulfilling all
experimental constraints. Orange and red points correspond to the final benchmark
points, for which the desired vacua are either stable or long-lived. Light blue points
(labelled Minimum at two-loop) lead to the desired vacuum only when two-loop
corrections are included and thus could not be studied with current tools. Black
points show CCB minima deeper than the desired vacuum with the latter having
a survival probability of < 1 %. Grey points (labelled inconclusive) show CCB
minima at 1-loop, but the desired vacua appear only after two-loop corrections are
included. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43

comparison, the non-universal points were gathered with Atri = 6 TeV instead of
Atri = 5 TeV as shown in figures 3.3 - 3.7. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 61

1 | Introduction
Whenever scientists discover a new physical phenomenon, they are eager to explain it in accordance
with already existing theories and observations made before. In the not-too-uncommon case where
this is not possible, the existing theories have to be modified or completely new theories need
to be developed in order to yield an explanation for the new phenomenon. Additionally, any
new theories of course need to comprise the well studied and verified parts of older, until then
established theories.
A historical event of such kind worth mentioning took place in the 19th and early 20th century.
Isaac Newtons theory of gravity was well established and able to describe many astrophysical
phenomena precisely, among others also the trajectories of planets in our solar system. However, in
1846 the French astronomer Urbain le Verrier discovered an irregular movement of the Uranus that
disagreed with the prediction Newtons theory gave for its orbit. Instead of enhancing or falsifying
Newtons theory of gravity, le Verrier postulated a yet unobserved planet to be responsible for
his observations. This planet was observed later the same year and should become known as
Neptune. Around the same time, le Verrier also studied the anomalous orbit of Mercury and
suggested once again a yet unknown planet (called Vulcan) to be responsible for the disagreement
with the Newtonian orbit prediction [1]. This time, le Verriers postulate turned out to be false
with Vulcan never being found and eventually not being the reason for the anomalous orbit of
Mercury. The solution to this problem had to wait for more than 25 years, until Albert Einsteins
theory of general relativity (GR), which comprises Newtonian gravity as a limit of weak gravity
and small velocities, was finally able to predict the precessive movement of Mercury correctly.
A century later, the game is still the same, only the theories and experiments have changed.
With the rise and triumph of quantum field theory (QFT) in the 20th century, describing the
Chapter 1. Introduction
physics of subatomic scales and particles, we now have a powerful and experimentally well tested
theory to describe three of the four fundamental forces of nature simultaneously (electromagnet-
ism, the weak force and the strong force). This theory is known as the Standard Model of Particle
Physics (SM) and to this day, there is almost no experimentally observed phenomenon in particle
physics the SM cannot explain. However, it is not all roses and there are some significant flaws in
the SM which seem to demand for more than just a modification to compensate for. For example,
one of the more obvious flaws of such kind lies in the fact that the SM is not describing gravity.
Modifying the SM to include gravity also seems unlikely due to the highly different natures of the
SM as a QFT and GR as a classical theory. With several more such issues of the SM, the game
repeats and new theories addressing them are in high demand. Fortunately, a variety of most
diverse theories have already been developed, with some of them probably (and hopefully) at the
brink of discovery (or exclusion) in the upcoming years.
Before focussing on these new theories, let us briefly review the SM and its aforementioned
flaws.
1.1 The Standard Model of Particle Physics
The SM currently is one of the best tested physical theories in the world and describes the
electromagnetic, weak and strong forces relativistically at quantum level. As a gauge theory, the
SM is based on the gauge groups SU(3)C  SU(2)L  U(1)Y , where the SU(3)C describes the
quark sector (quantum chromodynamics, QCD) and the SU(2)LU(1)Y describes the electroweak
interactions before eventually breaking down to the U(1)EM. The SM has been developed over
several decades in the 20th century before reaching its current form in the 1970s. An essential
part in validating the SM experimentally thereby came from the Large Electron-Positron Collider
(LEP) at CERN. After the discovery of the W [2, 3] and Z [4] bosons in 1983 by the UA1 and
UA2 collaborations at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron, LEP measured their masses and
further electroweak parameters with an outstanding accuracy (see Ref. [5] for a summary of all
LEP experiments and results). Thanks to this data, the electroweak theory and its high-precision
predictions based on radiative corrections e.g. to the Z boson mass were tested and beautifully
validated and marked a major success in establishing the SM. Furthermore, the lower mass limit
1.2. Problems of the Standard Model
LEP set on the then undiscovered Higgs boson mass, mh  114.4 GeV [6], was just slightly below
the mass of the Higgs boson discovered in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the
CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [7, 8]. Together with the Higgs boson, all of the particles
predicted by the SM have been found, with other noteworthy discoveries being the discovery of
the tau neutrino in 2000 by the DONUT collaboration [9] and the top quark in 1995 by the
D0 collaboration [10] at Fermilab. It should be stressed, however, that even though the 2012
discovered Higgs boson matches the SM Higgs boson quite well so far, its properties are not fully
determined yet and it might still be based in theories other than the SM.
The reason to expect all of these particles in the first place usually is to either not lose
certain (gauge) symmetries of the theory or due to observations in nature requiring or suggesting
such particles. Exemplarily, the charm quark was predicted as a consequence of the so called
GIM mechanism, named after Sheldon Lee Glashow, John Iliopoulos, and Luciano Maiani [11].
The GIM mechanism successfully describes the suppression of flavour changing neutral currents
(FCNC) in weak interactions and implies that quarks should be arranged in SU(2) doublets.
This, in turn, had further consequences, as the discovery of the bottom quark in 1977 by the E288
experiment at Fermilab [12] strongly suggested the existence of a sixth quark, the top quark,
which eventually was found eighteen years later.
Besides just predicting physical phenomena, the SM can also be extremely accurate. For
example, the SM prediction of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron matches the
experimentally measured value up to 10 decimals [13]. For completeness, the particle content of
the SM together with some basic particle properties is given below in table 1.1.
1.2 Problems of the Standard Model
While the SM is able to explain a variety of observations with incredible accuracy, there are
still numerous problems the SM is not able to resolve. These problems are of very different
nature, including observations made in nature the SM cannot explain, theoretical considerations
not compatible or explainable within the SM and a general arbitrariness of SM parameters and
assumptions. A general overview over some of the problems the SM is currently facing is given
below.

Table 1.1: Particle content and some of their properties in the Standard Model.  In the SM,
neutrinos are predicted to be massless. However, experiments have shown that neutrinos are
actually massive (see also section 1.2 below).
Arbitrariness of SM parameters and assumptions: While the general idea of the SM and
most of its assumptions are very well motivated, it still remains a mystery why e.g. there
are exactly three colours. Or why there are three different quark and lepton families. Might
there be even more? Why are the particles arranged in multiplets and why are they arranged
in these multiplets just the way they are? The SM offers no solution to any of these
fundamental questions and most likely never will.
Hierarchy Problem: The hierarchy problem, sometimes also referred to as fine tuning problem,
addresses the large discrepancy between the value of a fundamental parameter of a theory
and its effective, experimentally measured value. In case of the SM, this usually relates
to the vast discrepancy between the Higgs mass (mh  125 GeV) and the Planck Mass
(MP  1019 GeV). Due to radiative corrections (see Appendix A), the Higgs mass in the
SM is expected to be around the Planck mass, but experiment has shown otherwise with
the discovery of a particle consistent with the SM Higgs boson in 2012 [7, 8]. Now the
1.2. Problems of the Standard Model
only way to resolve this mismatch is to either require a large amount of fine tuning of the
radiative corrections to the Higgs mass and its bare mass, or to have some new physics
arising at a scale much lower than the Planck scale and not much larger than the Higgs
vacuum expectation value (vev), i.e. at the order of a few TeV. While the first solution is
usually disfavoured, the second solution offers a more general (and possibly more natural)
perspective to solve the hierarchy problem.
Dark Matter: Dark matter (DM) is a form of matter first mentioned in the 1930s by astronomer
and physicist Fritz Zwicky [14]. While examining the Coma cluster, he noticed a much
bigger velocity dispersion of the cluster than was expected at that time, leading to a mass
of the cluster much larger than what gravity alone would be able to hold together. As a
solution, Zwicky suggested some form of invisible or dark matter to be responsible for this
discrepancy in mass. Over the following decades, evidence of dark matter was found in
many more astronomical observations, e.g. in observations of the Bullet cluster [15] or via
gravitational lensing. The amount of dark matter present in the universe was estimated by
the Planck experiment to be 26.8 %, whereas all matter and antimatter ever observed by
humans make up only 4.9 % [16]. Despite the large amounts of dark matter out there in
the universe, no dark matter has ever been observed directly. This is mainly due to the fact
that dark matter must be neutral, massive and non-baryonic (like neutrinos) and is mostly
of non-relativistic nature (unlike neutrinos), while the latter characteristic is important to
explain the structure formation in the universe as we observe it today. This type of dark
matter is often referred to as cold (or warm in case of semi-relativistic) dark matter [17].
The only possible DM candidates the SM could provide are the neutrinos. However, since
neutrinos would not be cold but hot dark matter due to their relativistic nature, they cannot
be the major part of dark matter and therefore render the SM unable to explain dark matter.
Dark Energy: Similar to dark matter, there seems to be a yet unknown form of energy present
in the universe, called dark energy. It is expected to be responsible for the accelerated
expansion of the universe and is consistent with having a nonzero cosmological constant
in the Einstein field equations. Dark energy makes up for the remaining 68.3 % of our
universe [16] and, if the SM is assumed to be valid up to the Planck scale (see Hierarchy
Chapter 1. Introduction
problem), it would overestimate this energy by a factor of 10120.
Neutrinos: While the SM actually contains neutrinos, all of them are constrained to be massless.
However, experiments such as the Super-Kamiokande for example have shown that neutrinos
oscillate [18], which is only possible if they are massive particles. The SM is neither able to
explain these oscillations nor any neutrino masses.
Gravity: Gravity and the SM are not and cannot be combined simply based on the Einstein
field equations. This is due to the fact that general relativity as a quantum theory would be
unrenormalisable. Different approaches to make GR a renormalisable quantum theory have
been attempted with the more famous ones being string theory and loop quantum gravity.
These theories, however, follow different concepts of quantisation and are not merged with
the SM. Therefore, it is safe to say for the time being that the SM is incapable of explaining
gravity.
Strong CP Problem: The SM allows for a term in its Lagrangian proportional to
GaG
,a (1.1)
that breaks CP symmetry. Although experiments on the electric dipole moment of the
neutron suggest  < 109 [19], the SM is not able to give any prediction about whether 
should be zero or nonzero at all.
Inflation: Very shortly after the big bang, the universe was undergoing a massive expansion,
increasing in size by at least a factor of 1026 [20]. This expansion is what is known as
inflation and different models exist describing inflation successfully. For example, inflation
can arise as a consequence of discretised spacetime in loop quantum gravity, whereas other
theories suggest a new scalar field responsible for inflation, usually called the inflaton (field).
None of the SM scalars has properties as required by an inflaton to explain inflation, and
neither does the SM have a discretised spacetime, therefore rendering the SM incapable of
giving an explanation for inflation.
Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry: In the early stages of the universe, matter and antimatter
1.2. Problems of the Standard Model
should have been produced in identical amounts. Nowadays, however, we only observe
matter  be it on earth, the milky way or even beyond. It is unknown what has caused this
asymmetry in matter and antimatter, but it is at least possible to specify when baryogenesis
occurs thanks to the so called Sakharov conditions [21]. The three Sakharov conditions
require
1. at least one baryon-number violating process,
2. C as well as CP violation,
3. particle interactions outside the thermal equilibrium.
Without further specifying conditions 1 and 3 and besides the unobserved and heavily
constrained strong CP violation discussed above, the SM features another source of CP
violation in the electroweak sector, first observed in Kaon decays in 1964 [22]. However, the
amount of CP violation coming from the SM is small and therefore insufficient to explain
the full matter-antimatter asymmetry regardless of the first and third condition.
Anomalous Magnetic Moment of the Muon: Charged elementary particles have a magnetic
moment ~M , given as
~M = g
~S (1.2)
with the gyromagnetic ratio g, the spin ~S, the charge q and the mass m of the corresponding
particle. Non-relativistically, the gyromagnetic ratio of any charged particle with semi-
integer spin equals exactly two1, but quantum corrections change this value. While for the
electron, the SM prediction of ge including quantum corrections matches the experimentally
measured value with unrivalled accuracy, there is a tension of roughly 3 between the SM
prediction of g and its experimental value. This discrepancy exists for several decades
already and, provided that it persists, is unresolvable by the SM.
While some of the above mentioned issues are of fundamental nature and it is uncertain how, when
or if it all any of these issues will be solved, other problems can be and are already addressed by
1This is a prediction by the Pauli equation, which directly emerges as the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac
equation under the presence of an electromagnetic field. Therein, a term  e2m~  ~B with charge e and mass m
of the fermion as well as the magnetic field ~B and the Pauli matrices  appears. Identifying the Bohr magneton
B = e2m and the spin of the fermion ~S =
2~ results in the above term to read ~  ~B = g B ~S  ~B with g = 2.
Chapter 1. Introduction
a variety of theories. These theories are usually denoted as Beyond the Standard Model (BSM)
theories and we will give an overview on some of the more relevant theories for this thesis in the
following section.
1.3 Going Beyond the Standard Model
While there exists a plethora of highly diverse BSM theories addressing different issues of the SM,
they all include the SM as some limit in order to reproduce its well tested predictions. For a large
class of theories, the SM reappears as the low energy limit of the BSM theory, which typically
lives at an energy scale close to the Planck mass, however it can also live very well just a few
orders of magnitude above the SM or, in fact, anywhere between the electroweak and the Planck
scale. As an example, a class of BSM theories usually situated at very large energy scales are the
so called Grand Unified Theories or Grand Unification Theories (GUT), which unify all forces of
nature but gravity at the so called GUT scale, typically around MGUT  1016 GeV.
Most BSM theories simply extend the SM by additional fields or symmetries, which makes
it comparatively easy to recreate the SM in some limit. However, there are also approaches
developing or relying on completely different mathematical frameworks beyond QFT, such as
string theory and loop quantum gravity. In this thesis, we will not focus on such new frameworks
but instead focus mainly on two sets of BSM theories known as supersymmetry (SUSY) and
effective field theories (EFTs). The latter one, however, is rather a framework suitable to do BSM
physics than an actual BSM theory, as EFTs can also be used to describe the SM, just parts of it
or completely different areas of physics.
1.3.1 Supersymmetry
Before considering supersymmetric models in detail, it is worth to briefly recap the history of
SUSY, which is closely related to the S-matrix2 and the Poincare group. The full symmetry of
the S matrix consists of the direct products of the Poincare group and all internal symmetries,
where internal means that a symmetry transformation does not act on the spacetime coordinates
2The S-matrix denotes the scattering matrix, given as S = 1  i(2)4 (4)(p  p)M with the scattering
amplitudes collected in the matrix M.
1.3. Going Beyond the Standard Model
x. The SM gauge group SU(3)C  SU(2)L  U(1)Y is such an internal symmetry under the S
matrix. Now in case one wants to extend the symmetry of the S-matrix in a non-trivial way 
e.g. to include gravity, which clearly acts on x and thus cannot be an internal symmetry 
the Coleman-Mandula theorem has to be taken into account. This theorem mainly states that
all new generators of a new symmetry of the S-matrix must commute with the generators of
the Poincare group [23], which is only possible if the Poincare group and the new symmetry are
connected trivially, i.e. via a direct product. While this first seemed to be the end of the story,
there actually is a way to non-trivially extend the symmetries of the S-matrix, namely by relaxing
Coleman and Mandulas assumption of considering only commuting (or bosonic) generators and
also allow for anticommuting (fermionic) generators Q. This idea of anticommuting or fermionic
generators was picked up and realised by Haag,  Lopuszanski and Sohnius [24] and allowed them
to embed the Poincare group in a larger, not trivially connected symmetry group. The new
fermionic generators thereby have the property of transforming a boson into a fermion and vice
versa, schematically depicted as
Q |fermion = |boson , Q |boson = |fermion . (1.3)
Altogether, the regular spacetime with its four coordinates x is extended to the so called super-
space, which contains an additional fermionic spacetime with four Grassmann coordinates  and
 with ,  = 1, 2. This extension of the spacetime to superspace further allows us to construct
supermultiplets or superfields3, which contain a bosonic, a fermionic and an auxiliary field. The
latter, unphysical field can be removed via the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion4.
With the ability to construct superfields, we can now successfully build supersymmetric Lag-
rangians and therefore supersymmetric models or theories. Almost regardless of the particular
model, SUSY is able to address and solve a variety of problems of the SM (see section 1.2) which
are worth showing again, but this time with the respective solution SUSY may offer.

particle (sparticle) loops contributing to the Higgs self energy. In particular and if SUSY
is exact (or unbroken), for each loop with SM fermions f , there is also a loop with its
supersymmetric scalar partner f , leading to a perfect cancellation between the two and
thus a naturally light Higgs mass without the need of fine tuning (see figure 1.1 below).

partners (right).

whereas the stop quark appearing in the diagram on the right contributes

therefore perfectly cancelling both contributions. If SUSY is broken (see section 1.3.1.1
below), the cancellation is not perfect any longer due to mt 6= mt and instead logarithmic
divergences proportional to

arise. However, compared to the quadratic divergences, the logarithmic divergences are
much smaller, as long as the respective sparticle masses (in this case mt) are small enough.
5The minus sign for fermionic loops is a consequene of the spin-statistics theorem.
1.3. Going Beyond the Standard Model
Dark Matter: The supersymmetric partners of the neutral gauge bosons and the Higgs boson
mix and form the so called neutralinos. The lightest of these neutralinos is weakly interact-
ing, massive and can be stable, thus making it a viable DM candidate.
Anomalous Magnetic Moment of the Muon: The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon
can be partially or even fully resolved in supersymmetric theories, as new SUSY particles
provide further one-loop contributions, accounting for the large observed deviation. This
topic will be discussed in far more detail in chapters 2 and 3.
Additionally, SUSY allows for gauge coupling unification at about 1016 GeV (which is desirable
for naturalness reasons) and SUSY is necessary for the description of fermions in string theory.
In the next subchapter, we will focus on a particularly well studied SUSY model, namely the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM).
1.3.1.1 The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is the minimal supersymmetric extension
to the SM, such that each SM particle has exactly one superpartner. This is not true for the Higgs,
however, as two Higgs doublets (rather than just one as in the SM) are required. One of the main
reasons for a second Higgs doublet is that the superpotential needs to be holomorphic, hence the
complex conjugate of the Higgs field cannot give mass to the up-type quarks, as realised in the
SM. Additionally, a single Higgs doublet would result in a triangle gauge and Witten anomaly
caused by its superpartner (called higgsino). This anomaly can be cancelled by the higgsino of a
second Higgs doublet with opposite hypercharge. The full particle content of the MSSM is shown
in table 1.2 below. To fully specify the MSSM, the aforementioned superpotential still needs to
be chosen. With R-parity conserved (see below), the superpotential reads
W = yiju U
iQjHu  y
iQjHd  y
iLjHd + HuHd (1.7)
with the fields being the left-chiral superfields from table 1.2 and suppressed colour indices. The
Yukawa couplings are organised in 3 3 matrices y with components yij and the indices i and j
running from one to three, labelling the respective generation.  is the higgsino mass parameter.

The second, third and fourth column refer to the gauge transformation properties and the weak

It is worth noting that all fermion masses are generated by W, as a fermionic mass term in the
Lagrangian would explicitely break SU(2)L.
The superpotential in equation (1.7) is not complete in the sense that more gauge-invariant
and renormalisable terms exist, namely

Here, the superfield Q carries baryon number B = +13 , U
c and Dc carry B = 13 , L carries lepton
number L = +1 and finally Ec carries L = 1. By counting B and L, it becomes apparent that
1.3. Going Beyond the Standard Model
these terms all violate baryon and lepton number conservation by one unit. This is problematic,
as such terms would give rise to proton decay and further introduce B- and L-violating processes,
which are not observed experimentally6. A possible solution to this problem is to introduce a new
symmetry, commonly denoted as R-parity. R-parity is multiplicatively conserved and is defined
R = (1)3B+L+2s , (1.10)
with s being the particles spin. Inserting the quantum numbers quickly shows that all SM
particles have R = +1, whereas all SUSY particles carry R = 1. Furthermore, the superpotential
in equation (1.7) conserves R-parity, whereas equations (1.8) and (1.9) do not, thus forbidding
these terms in the superpotential. Additional important features of R-parity arise, when noting
that each vertex in the superpotential (1.7) features an even number of SUSY particles. As a
consequence, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is absolutely stable and SUSY particles
can only be produced in pairs at colliders.
Down to some energy scale, each supersymmetric particle has the same mass as its corres-
ponding SM particle. However, we never observed any SUSY particle, thus indicating that SUSY
is not an exact symmetry but must be broken at some energy scale larger than the electroweak
scale of the SM. SUSY breaking is considered to happen spontaneously, however the exact mech-
anism is unknown and presumably intricate, as the massless (fermionic) Goldstone mode  the so
called goldstino  of spontaneous SUSY breaking is not observed and therefore has to be evaded
somehow. This can be achieved e.g. by assuming a flavour-blind hidden sector, in which SUSY
is broken spontaneously and which couples to the chiral superfields. In practice, it turns out to
be convenient to parametrise our ignorance of this hidden sector and simply add terms to the
Lagrangian that explicitely break SUSY. The SUSY-breaking couplings of these terms thereby
should have a positive mass dimension (so called soft couplings, or soft SUSY breaking), as oth-
erwise the hierarchy problem would be reintroduced [25]. With soft SUSY breaking, the quadratic
divergences still cancel and the much smaller logarithmic corrections become dominant.
6Apart from some non-perturbative electroweak effects which are non-negligible only at energy scales as in the
early universe, no B- and L-violating processes were observed.

The parameters M1, M2 and M3 correspond to the bino, wino and gluino masses respectively,
whereas au, ad and ae are complex 33 matrices in family space. Q, u, d, L and e are the SUSY
partners of the quarks and leptons as defined in table 1.2 in form of family triplets. Subsequently,
m2Q, m
u, m
, m2L and m
e are 3 3 Hermitian matrices in family space. Hu and Hd correspond
to the scalar up- and down-type Higgs fields, while the last line of equation (1.11) is responsible
for the soft SUSY breaking of the Higgs potential.
While the unbroken MSSM may seem attractive due to its comparably small number of free
parameters, the softly broken MSSM drastically changes this picture by adding a total of 105 new
paramters in the form of masses, mixing angles and phases [27]. Although this looks discouraging
at first, a large fraction of these parameters is heavily constrained or has to be zero in order to be
in agreement with experimental observations. As an example, some of the softly broken MSSM
parameters introduce FCNC or CP -violation at levels already ruled out by experiments (see
e.g. [28]). Lastly, many phenomenological studies involve more constrained versions of the MSSM
with just a few free parameters. As an example, the models known as minimal Supergravity
(mSUGRA) or constrained MSSM (cMSSM) are very popular and one of their core features is
the gauge coupling unification at the GUT7 scale. As a consequence, only five free parameters
remain, namely
m0 , M1/2 , A0 , tan  , sgn , (1.12)
with m0 being the unified soft scalar mass, M1/2 the unified gaugino mass and A0 the unified
trilinear coupling. tan  = v2
is defined as the ratio of the Higgs vevs and sgn is the sign of the
higgsino mass parameter.
7GUT stands for Grand Unified Theory or Grand Unification Theory.
1.3. Going Beyond the Standard Model
In this thesis, we will consider two GUT scale models breaking down to the MSSM with a
specific set of parameters  less constrained than in the cMSSM, but more constrained than the
full MSSM  in chapters 2 and 3.
1.3.2 Effective Field Theories
In nature, different physical phenomena are observed on extremely small distances (as small as
1018 m, corresponding to high energies), but also on incredibly large distances (such as e.g.
1010 m, corresponding to low energies). As we can see from everyday life and the history of
physics, we do not need to know about all effects on all scales to describe a given phenomenon
with precision. In fact, to explain a phenomenon of interest, it usually is sufficient to focus on
just the energy scales small enough to comprise the phenomenon  without any knowledge of
other possible high energy effects. This is the basic idea of what is called an effective field theory
(EFT): to describe given quantities at some low energy scale without having to know or care
about possible high energy effects. In terms of quantum field theories, the high energy effects are
considered to take place at some energy scale  and refer e.g. to the mediation of some heavy
particles with masses around , whereas the low energy phenomena involve only particles with
masses much smaller than . To get rid of the high energy effects in the action of the EFT,
the heavy particles will be integrated out and replaced by an infinite series of local interactions
between the light particles, expanded in powers of 1. While just integrating out the heavy
particles results in the action to be non-local, further developing the infinite series restores the
locality of the action. Hence, apart from kinetic terms and mass terms, the general Lagrangian
of an EFT can be written as
LEFT 
Did
Oi , (1.13)
where Oi is an operator of the EFT consisting of local combinations or interactions of the low
energy fields, Di is the mass dimension of Oi, d is the number of spacetime dimensions8, ci are
the so called Wilson coefficients (containing information about the high energy effects, see also
below),  is the cut-off scale up to which the EFT is valid and the sum runs over the amount i
of all possible operators. While in general an EFT is not renormalisable, in practice only some
8Usually, but not necessarily, d = 4.
Chapter 1. Introduction
terms of the infinite series are considered, up to some desired accuracy.
An important property of an EFT is that all high energy effects that are relevant once the
energy of a given process E is similar to the cut-off scale, E  , are contained within the Wilson
coefficients ci. Therefore, as long as models describing the high energy effects both contain the
same low energy particle spectrum and symmetries, they share the exact same EFT with the
only difference being different values for the ci. In reverse, this means that just one EFT is able
to provide limits for a variety of high energy models, if the ci are constrained experimentally
e.g. by LHC searches. This feature is also reflected in the way EFTs can be constructed. In
the so called top-down approach, the theory at the high energy scale  is fully specified. The
EFT is then constructed by first integrating out the high energy particles and then developing
the infinite series shown in equation (1.13). Regarding the latter, first the desired accuracy of
any computation is chosen and then all operators O that are necessary to achieve this accuracy
are constructed. The advantage of the top-down approach on the one hand is that the Wilson
coefficients ci are known due to the knowledge of the full high energy theory and, on the other
hand, lead to a simpler Lagrangian for further calculations.
The more commonly used bottom-up approach is independent of any high energy theory, as
here the EFT Lagrangian based on equation (1.13) is constructed up to some desired accuracy
without any knowledge on possible high energy effects or the ci, but only based on a chosen set
of symmetries and the particle content at the considered low energy. Together with experimental
searches constraining the Wilson coefficients in a model-independent way, this approach is very
often favoured due to its ability to set limits on several high energy models at once.
EFTs are also important tools in studying BSM physics. As such, the unknown BSM physics
is taken to be the high energy theory with its low energy limit being the SM. The SM is incredibly
well tested and its particle content and symmetries precisely known, thus the Wilson coefficients
of various EFTs can be strongly constrained. When further focussing on experiments, this implies
that e.g. the LHC phenomenology of theories with particles too heavy to be produced during
collisions can be explored with an EFT. It should be noted, however, that even though the SM
is very well tested and it is likely that any new physics arise at energy scales much larger than
the ones directly testable at the LHC, there is still the possibility of yet undiscovered light, very

weakly interacting particles existing at about the same energy scale as the SM. These particles
cannot be described by an EFT, as a necessary requirement for an EFT to be valid is the existence
of a scale hierarchy.
For the work carried out in Chapter 5, we use an EFT based on a bottom-up approach to
explore the potential of colliders to test the Higgs couplings to other gauge bosons.
1.4 Aim and Structure of this Thesis
With the issues of the SM raised in section 1.2, new physics clearly become a necessity to suc-
cessfully explain what we observe in nature. Various theoretical models and frameworks have
been proposed to address these issues and it is nearly impossible to study all of them at once.
Furthermore, some models and frameworks make predictions out of the scope of current exper-
iments such as the LHC. In this thesis, we will not focus on yet untestable theories (or theories
with very little phenomenological implications for current experiments), but will focus on two
classes of models that might be discovered (or excluded) by current or future LHC searches. In
particular, we consider two models involving supersymmetry and two models based on an EFT.
The first model involving supersymmetry is a GUT scale Pati-Salam model with an A4Z5 fam-
ily symmetry, which breaks down to the MSSM with special constraints on the soft GUT scale
masses. We study the capabilities of this model to account for the anomalous magnetic moment
of the muon, dark matter and further experimental constraints in the next Chapter 2 based on
work published in Ref. [29]. Additionally, we perform an analysis on the vacuum stability for a
given set of benchmark points, as this is necessary for some (but not necessarily all) solutions we
find.
In Chapter 3, we explore similar BSM aspects for the well studied GUT scale model SU(5),
however also considering an A4 family symmetry, as was done in Ref. [30]. While the SU(5)A4
also breaks down to the MSSM, the newly imposed GUT scale constraints differ from the Pati-
Salam ones and allow us to perform a completely different explorative study with a larger focus
on LHC phenomenology. In particular, the SU(5)  A4 provides an excellent opportunity to in-
vestigate the influence of gaugino mass universality and non-universality on the model predictions
for both cosmological and collider searches.
Chapter 1. Introduction
In Chapter 4, we study the phenomenological implications of theories such as Composite
Higgs (CH) models as an alternative to SUSY. In such theories, the electroweak (EW) symmetry
is broken by strong dynamics in analogy to QCD and the Higgs boson arises as a bound state
of these strong dynamics. In particular and based on Ref. [31], we provide a simplified effective
model containing a heavy vector resonance Z , a coloured vector-like top partner sector and a
possible DM candidate. We study the coverage of the model parameter space by various LHC
searches with a special focus on the expected model-specific signature of a top quark pair and
missing transverse energy, tt+ /ET . Furthermore, we investigate whether such a model is able to
successfully describe DM.
Due to the yet unknown nature of the Higgs boson and the resulting fact that it may still
be part of a BSM theory (such as a CH model) rather than the SM, we explore the potential
of current and future hadron colliders to determine the nature of the Higgs by using an EFT
based on a non-linear  model in Chapter 5. In this model, the couplings of the Higgs boson to
other gauge bosons may differ by a multiplicative factor (anomalous Higgs couplings), therefore
potentially leading to a violation of unitarity, which in turn marks the beginning of new physics.
The unitarity violation is expected to be visible in form of a large increase in cross section, which
we study in detail for different LHC final states containing W and Higgs bosons. Finally, we
investigate the capability of the LHC to observe such new physics by comparing the predicted
signal to the estimated background for various collider energies and anomalous Higgs couplings.
This chapter is based on Ref. [32].
Lastly, we summarise and conclude the findings of this thesis in Chapter 6.

scale Pati-Salam
2.1 Introduction
An attractive theory for BSM physics is SUSY (for a review, see e.g. [28]), even if to date no
evidence for it was found at experiments, especially not at colliders such as the LHC. However,
SUSY remains an attractive BSM theory for several reasons worth repeating here. Not only
allows SUSY for gauge coupling unification, which is absent in the SM, but also provides viable
DM candidates such as the R parity stable lightest neutralino and it also addresses the hierarchy
problem of the SM. Even if no evidence for SUSY has been found yet (including the lack of
non-standard flavour signals in the LHCb detector), there remains one puzzling experimental
discrepancy in the SM that exists for more than two decades. This discrepancy comes from
the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, which is often neglected or ignored for different
reasons. Contrary to the SM, SUSY is able to fully account for this discrepancy in case light
sleptons and charginos are provided. While this condition alone is not in tension with current LHC
constraints on new coloured supersymmetric particles, it remains an exciting question whether
a well motivated unified SUSY model is able to account not only for the anomalous magnetic
moment of the muon, but also for various more collider and non-collider constraints including
DM. Addressing this question is the aim of this chapter.
The discrepancy between the SM and experimental values for the anomalous magnetic moment
Chapter 2. MSSM (g  2) and DM from GUT scale Pati-Salam
of the muon1, a, is given by
a = aexp  a
 = 288(80) 10
11 , (2.1)
which is a 3.6 tension. In case a does not vanish when measured more precisely by upcoming
experiments and/or once improvements to the SM (hadronic)contributions are available, it may
become a sign of new physics beyond the SM.
As mentioned before, SUSY is able to account for a, however the situation can be very tricky
depending on the particular SUSY model considered. For example, it is known that within the
framework of the constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (cMSSM), it is difficult
to achieve a due to the few soft mass parameters available [3335]. In the full MSSM with its
many parameters, however, a can be accounted for more easily (see e.g. [36,37]). There is also
the possibility to only partially account for a with supersymmetric effects and thus making
simple Grand Unified Theory (GUT) models viable (see e.g. [38,39]), however these models then
are no more attractive for explaining a than the SM.
Other possible SUSY GUT models to explain a are models with normal mass hierarchy
and non-universal scalar masses for the first two and the third generation of sfermions [40] as
well as the phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM) [41], which is based on the following simplifying
assumptions:
 First and second generation universality for low energy soft masses mQi ,mUi ,mDi ,mLi ,mEi
with i = 1, 2
 Separate low energy soft masses for third generation scalar masses mQ3 ,mU3 ,mD3 ,mL3 ,mE3
 Separate low energy gaugino masses M1,M2,M3
 Separate trilinear parameters At, Ab, A
The model cosidered in this chapter is a conceptually different MSSM model based on a GUT
scale Pati-Salam gauge group together with an A4  Z5 family symmetry [42]. While the initial
purpose of the model was to describe the quark and lepton masses and mixings (which it does
1It is also common to refer to a as (g  2) or in less common cases just g  2.
2.2. The Model
excellently) with a focus on the neutrino sector, here the capabilities of the model to additionally
explain a as well as further experimental observations are studied. The model is set up by the
following GUT scale parameters:
 A universal high energy soft scalar mass for all left-handed squarks and sleptons of all three
families m0 = mQi = mLi for i = 1, 2, 3
 Three high energy soft mass parameters for the right-handed squarks and leptons, one for
each family mi = mUi = mDi = mEi for i = 1, 2, 3
 Separate high energy gaugino masses M1,M2,M3
 Separate trilinear parameters At, Ab, A
We will show that this model is able to fully explain a while simultaneously providing a viable
DM candidate, a stable vacuum and being in agreement with all remaining dark matter and
collider constraints.
The remainder of this chapter is organised as follows. In section 2.2 we describe the model
with a focus on phenomenological aspects. In section 2.3, we highlight some key aspects of the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and clarify its leading contributions. We will discuss
experimental constraints, including collider constraints and those on the dark matter relic density,
in section 2.4. We present our results, including some example scenarios, in section 2.5. Finally,
we investigate the vacuum stability for these example scenarios in section 2.6, before concluding
in section 2.7.
2.2 The Model
The model we consider is based on the Pati-Salam (PS) gauge group SU(4)C  SU(2)L  SU(2)R
together with an A4  Z5 family symmetry and has been proposed in Ref. [42]. In a PS model,
leptons are considered as a fourth colour (historically denoted as lilac) and unify quarks and

where the subscript i (= 1, 2, 3) denotes the family index and the SM multiplets Qi, Li, uci , d

and eci arising after PS breaking are also shown. When the PS model also comprises an A4  Z5
symmetry (see Appendix B), the left and right-handed sectors transform differently under them.
The full representations together with their A4 structure are shown pictorially in figure 2.1.
The left-handed quarks and leptons form an A4 triplet F , whereas the right-handed fields F ci

Therefore, the model contains four different matter multiplets at the GUT scale, namely F , F c1 ,
F c2 and F c3 , which acquire soft masses labelled with m0, m1, m2 and m3 respectively.
The beforementioned breaking of the PS gauge group to the SM at the GUT scale is initiated

To maintain supersymmetric gauge coupling unification, the PS Higgs fields acquire vacuum
expectation values (vevs) close to the GUT scale 2  1016 GeV in the direction of cH , i.e.
Hc = cH = Hc = 
H  2  10
16 GeV, (2.6)
Besides the PS Higgs, the model involves three kinds of Higgs bi-doublets: hu, hd and h3.
While hu (hd) is responsible for the up-type (down-type) quark and neutrino (charged lepton)
Yukawa couplings, h3  which is also an A4 triplet  gives rise to the Yukawa couplings of
the third family. After PS and A4 breaking, the majority of these bi-doublets will get high-scale
masses and therefore does not appear in the low-energy mass spectrum. The only doublets with
masses in the TeV range are Hu and Hd, which are linear combinations of hu and h3 or hd and
h3 respectively. Hu has a hypercharge of Y = +12 and couples to up-type quarks and neutrinos,
whereas Hd has a hypercharge of Y = 12 and couples to down-type quarks and charged leptons.
With this, the model reduces to the usual MSSM below the GUT scale, however with novel
boundary conditions for the soft scalar masses. In particular, we have four different soft masses,
namely m0 for the left-handed fields of all generations and m1, m2, m3 for the right-handed fields
for each generation. These boundary conditions result in the model being more constrained than
the general MSSM, but less so than the cMSSM.
Although the initial focus of the model is set on neutrino physics2, we shall see that, thanks
to the just explained new boundary conditions, it is also able to explain several phenomenological
aspects, including a, the Dark Matter relic density as well as a variety of collider constraints,
and also leads to a distinctive and novel low energy sparticle mass spectrum with characteristic
signatures at the LHC.
2Among other features, it predicts a normal neutrino mass hierarchy with 13  9, 23  45 and   260 [42].

2.3 The Anomalous Magnetic Moment of the Muon
2.3.1 Overview
The magnetic moment of the muon (or any charged massive particle) is related to its spin ~S by
~M = g
~S , (2.7)
where g is the gyromagnetic ratio. In the non-relativisitc limit, g equals two exactly for any
massive charged particle with semi-integer spin. Deviations from this classical value emerge once
quantum level effects (loop corrections) are considered, where  besides SM corrections  new
physics contributions may also be relevant. The corrections to g can be parametrised by the so
called anomalous magnetic moment
g  2
(2.8)
and a is one of the most precisely measured quantities in modern particle physics. In 2006, the
E821 experiment at the Brookhaven National Laboratory measured a with an accuracy of 0.54
ppm [43,44] to
aexp = 116592091(63) 10
11 (2.9)
and future experiments at Fermilab [45] and J-PARC [46] aim to improve this result by a factor
of four. On the other side, there is the SM theory prediction for a of similar accuracy (for
useful reviews, see [4750]), consisting of QED corrections up to five loops [51] (see also [5255]),
electroweak corrections up to two loops [56,57] and hadronic corrections [5868] (for lattice QCD
evaluations, see also [6973]). Due to varying theoretical uncertainties between the authors for
the hadronic corrections, the difference a = aexp  aSM ranges from

There are various theories that can account for the discrepancy in a and we shall focus on a
supersymmetric approach within this chapter, explained in detail in the following section 2.3.2.
2.3.2 MSSM One-Loop Contributions
In supersymmetric models, a can fully or at least partially be attributed by smuon-neutralino
and sneutrino-chargino loops [36,37,74103], shown in figure 2.2 below. The respective analytical

where we use the superscripts (A,B,C,D) and (E) as a short notation to allow omission of the
mass ratio arguments. Both fN and fC are monotonically increasing for all 0  x, y <  and
are defined in 0  fN,C  1 [37]. Figure 2.3 shows contour plots of fN (x, y) (left) and fC(x, y)
(right) and it is worth noting that, for most x and y, fN (x, y) < fC(x, y). E.g. for x = y = 0.2,
fN is roughly ten times smaller then fC . The importance of this behaviour towards explaining
a will become relevant in section 2.5.
While investigating equation (2.13) in detail, it is apparent that major contributions to a
come from the prefactors in brackets on the right-hand side. Thus, having large, positive 
together with light smuon masses mL/R greatly enhances diagram (A) while simultaneously
suppressing diagrams (B) to (E). Also, as long as M1 does not get too large, the loop functions
are nearly neglegible within this setup.
The solution for large  is not unique, however, and small values of  can also lead to the

desired a. Now, large contributions arise from diagrams (B) and (E) or (C) and (D) (depending
on sgn()), while diagram (A) is suppressed. In this scenario, the loop functions become important
and may distinguish the dominant contributions among diagrams (B) to (E).
2.4 Experimental Constraints
Any successful high energy theory completing the SM should also comprise all known low-energy
experimental constraints. In particular, we require our model to be in conformity with the dark
matter relic density, limits coming from DM direct detection (DD) experiments, the Higgs boson
mass and the branching ratios for BR(Bs  +) and BR(b  s). The current combined
best fit of the DM relic density to data from Planck and Wmap is h2 = 0.1198 0.0026 [104].
However, we also consider the possibility that our model only partially accounts for the relic
density, thus opening up the bound to h2  [0.06, 0.1224]. Regarding the DM DD limits,
we consider data from the Lux collaboration on the 90 % upper confidence level cross sections
for spin-independent models. At a WIMP mass of 33 GeV, the limit reads DD-SI  7.6 
1046 cm2 = 7.6  1010 pb [105]. For smaller or larger WIMP masses, the limits are weaker,
therefore making our choice conservative. Concerning the Higgs mass mH , the current best
combined measurement was performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, yielding mH =
Chapter 2. MSSM (g  2) and DM from GUT scale Pati-Salam
(125.090.21 (stat.)0.11 (sys.)) GeV [106]. However, due to much larger theoretical uncertainties
arising in the computation of radiative corrections to the Higgs mass in the current state of the
art spectrum generators, we relax this constraint to mH = (125.09  1.50) GeV. The branching
ratios Br(b s) = (3.29 0.19 0.48) 104 [107] and Br(Bs  +)= 3.0+1.00.9  10
9 [108]
are directly applied to our results.
While the above experimental constraints are fixed, we still have the possibility to further
adapt our model parameter space in order to aim for some useful features. Light sleptons and
especially light smuons are one such feature due to the consequent large contribution to a(A)
(see equation (2.13a)). Additionally, light smuons provide a suitably higher possibility to explore
them in experimental studies as currently performed at the LHC because of their comparably
clean muonic signals. The smuon masses mL and mR are controlled by m0 and m2 respectively,
and in order to get both smuons to be light, both m0 and m2 have to be light. Another useful
feature related to the smuon masses is a large mass gap between at least one of them and the
LSP (denoted by ). This prevents muons coming from smuon decays     to be soft and
hence nearly undedectable by any collider. Finally, having a bino-like LSP is desirable as it helps
providing the correct DM relic density. Light LSPs can be aimed at by choosing M1 < M2, , but
not controlled directly. Therefore, different scans with different such parameter choices need to
be performed for an ideal choice of the gaugino mass parameters.
Lastly, we verified that none of our proposed benchmarks violate any of the 8 TeV ATLAS
and CMS analyses. This step is necessary as one set of our solutions, namely the small  scenario,
includes light 01, 02 and 
1 with comparatively low mass splittings (of order 100 GeV), leading
to potential di or tri-lepton signatures unobserved at the LHC and thus ruling out the respective
parameter space. The verification was done using MadGraph 5.2.2.3 [109] to generate events
for all relevant combinations of chargino-neutralino pair production, PYTHIA 6.4 [110] linked
to MadGraph to perform the parton3 showering4 and hadronisation, DELPHES 3.0 [111] linked
to CheckMATE 1.2.1 [112] for fast detector simulations and CheckMATE itself for the final event
3Historically, partons were the then unkown constituents of hadrons. Nowadays, we know hadrons consist of
quarks and gluons and the name parton can be used to address both.
4Showering or parton showering is the process of simulating initial and final state radiation for some underlying,
usually hard scattering event. Partons participating in this scattering can radiate gluons, for example, which
themselves can emit further radiation. This eventually leads to a cascade of particles, hence the name showering.
2.5. Results
analysis. The event analysis relies on the data provided by both ATLAS and CMS and is validated
against it in CheckMATE. Furthermore, the same experimental cuts as used by either collaboration
are applied, thus allowing us to establish whether a point in parameter space is ruled out or still
unexplored.
As a result, we found that tri-lepton signatures explored in Refs. [113, 114] are the most
constraining ones for the small  region. Di-lepton signatures, although turning out to be less
constraining for the parameter space under study, are also worth mentioning.
2.5 Results
To begin with, a point in parameter space is chosen by setting all relevant model parameters
(cf. section 2.1 and 2.2). Next, SoftSUSY 3.5.2 [115] is used to generate the associated mass
spectrum and any point with a Higgs mass out of the bounds chosen in section 2.4 is discarded. If
the Higgs mass is in bounds, micrOMEGAs 3.6.9.2 [116] is employed to compute the relic density
as well as all remaining constraints described in section 2.4.
2.5.1 An Inclusive Scan
Due to the lack of evidence for any strongly interacting SUSY particle at the LHC, the masses
of gluinos and squarks of the first two generations must be & 1.5 TeV and thus be rather heavy.
However, the electroweak searches are much less sensitive and consequently, less stringent bounds
on the sleptons and gauginos arise. As a benefits from light smuons and gauginos, we perform
a first inclusive scan taking this as well as the stronger bounds on coloured sparticles into account.
An overview of the parameter space we consider is shown in table 2.1, where for simplicity we
assume Atri  At = Ab = A . In particular, we allow the SU(3)C gaugino mass, M3, and the third

generation right-handed scalar mass, m3, to be very heavy so that the stop loops may provide a
significant contribution to the Higgs mass. Also, the smuons, controlled by m0 and m2 are kept
rather light to enhance a contributions. All other parameters remain fairly unconstrained.
In figure 2.4, we present viable portions of parameter space in the a- (top), a-M1
(bottom-left) and a-M2 (bottom-right) planes. Here, the light green and orange triangles have
too low relic density, the turquoise and salmon circles have only the relic density in bounds and

as well as solutions with large  (the two blue bands with || & 2 TeV). Additionally to a large
SUSY-preserving mass parameter || & 2 TeV, these solutions also prefer the bino mass paramter
|M1| & 100 GeV and at first glance do not differentiate between sgnM1 or sgnM2. For the
solutions with small , the situation is different, as viable a can only be achieved if sgnM1 = 1

In figure 2.5, we show the -M1 parameter space with points where the lightest neutralino
01 is predominantly composed of the bino component. In the left panel, the colour-coding is the
same as in figure 2.4, while in the right panel, brighter colours correspond to heavier m01 . As can
be expected, it turns out that smaller values of the U(1)Y gaugino mass M1 at the GUT scale
strengthen the bino character of the LSP.

In this section, we investigate the solutions with small  from the narrow band in figure 2.4.
For this, a dedicated scan was performed with the GUT scale parameters chosen as shown in
table 2.2 below. In figure 2.6, we show an overview over the scan results in the m01-mL/R plane,

above this stripe and the entire bulk for left-handed smuons then corresponds to the situation
where DM co-annihilates with non-smuonic next-to-lightest supersymmetric particles (NLSPs).
In figure 2.7, we show the same data, however this time for the mass differences mL/R m01
versus the LSP mass. As could already be estimated from figure 2.6, the mass difference in case of
left-handed smuons is quite large and never deceeds 200 GeV. For right-handed smuons, this is not
the case and mass gaps as small as 1 GeV or less are possible, although not exclusively. If there
were only such small mass gaps, any muons arising from smuon decays would be nearly invisible
at the LHC. To allow for harder muons and thus possibly detectable signatures at the LHC, we
chose benchmark points with a mass gap to either smuon & 100 GeV (see orange pentagons in
figure 2.7).

Due to the smallness of  in this scenario, contributions to a are expected to arise from
diagrams (B), (C), (D) and (E)  1 of equations (2.13b) to (2.13e), whereas only minor con-
tributions from diagram (A)   of equation (2.13a) are expected. As mentioned earlier, in
case of small  the loop functions f (A,B,C,D)N (x, y) and f
C (x, y) can have a significant impact
on the overall contributions to a. We therefore analysed each individual loop contribution
from figure 2.2 (or equation (2.13) respectively) to understand how the total a is put together
in this situation. This is shown in the following figure 2.8, where we plot each contribution
a(X) for X = A,B,C,D,E versus the corresponding loop function fN,C(x, y) with the total

value of a for each point being colour-coded. It turns out that the only relevant positive
contributions are coming from diagrams (B) and (E). By noting that we chose M1 negative
and  and M2 positive (see table 2.2), this makes perfect sense, as only equations (2.13b) and
(2.13e) yield positive contributions to a under these assumptions. Both diagrams (B) and (E)
also contribute the major part to the total a, as a closer look at the loop functions reveals.
Since, in this scenario, the left-handed smuon is always heavier than the right-handed smuon, the
loop functions for diagrams (C) and (D) are suppressed compared to the one from diagram (B):
(C,D)
M21,2
 f (B)N
. With this reasoning, one could expect that diagram
(E) is also suppressed, as the muon sneutrino and the left-handed smuon are similar in mass and
both loop functions fN,C(x, y) share the same asymptotic limits. This is not the case, however, as
for fixed (x, y), fC(x, y) fN (x, y) (see discussion in section 2.3.2 and figure 2.3 therein.). Thus,
diagram (E) is driven mainly by its loop function f (E)C
, which allows for a significant
contribution to the total a.
Based on the above findings in the small  scenario, we provide a set of benchmarks listed in
table 2.3.
2.5.3 Large  Solutions
The second set of solutions for viable a we found requires a quite large higgsino mass parameter
|| & 2 TeV. Analogue to the small  scenario, we performed a dedicated scan around the points
with the correct a from figure 2.4 with a GUT scale parameter choice as shown in table 2.4
below. As  now is large, we expect major contributions to a only from diagram (A) (see
equation (2.13a)) due its proportionality to , whereas contributions from diagrams (B) to (E)
(see equations (2.13b) to (2.13e)) should be suppressed due to their proportionality to 1. Ad-
ditionally, diagram (A) benefits greatly from having small smuon masses due to their appearance
in the prefactor of equation (2.13a). Analogue to figure 2.8, we show each contribution a(X) for
X = A,B,C,D,E versus (Q) in figure 2.9, which confirms our above assumptions.
Regarding the relic density, it is possible to fully account for it in the large  scenario in case
dark matter is entirely bino-dominated. There are several points fulfilling this condition, which
we show as dark blue diamonds in figure 2.10.

In figure 2.11, we show the mass gaps between both left and right-handed smuons and the
lightest neutralino, which always is the LSP in this scenario. Other than in the small  scenario,
the mass gaps for left-handed smuons now can be as light as 50 GeV (if both the relic density and
a are required to be viable), whereas the mass gap between the right-handed smuons and the
LSP ranges down even further up to 0.01 GeV. As mentioned before, mass gaps that small would
render muons from smuon decays nearly undetectable, thus we aimed for choosing benchmarks
with larger mass gaps. While this is always possible for left-handed smuons, some right-handed
smuons are degenerate in mass with the LSP up to 10 GeV, however as long as at least one smuon
offers a larger mass gap, this is not problematic.

All dark blue diamonds are bino-like, whereas the light green triangles and turquoise circles are

Next, we examine the various possible NLSPs arising in this scenario by analysing the mass
gaps between the NLSP and LSP versus the LSP mass for different experimental bounds on a
and the relic density in figure 2.12. In the top left panel, the relic density is too small, which is
characterised by a first chargino NLSP, which is almost exactly mass-degenerate with the LSP. In
case the relic density is required to be in bounds, but not necessarily having the correct a, we
observe the NLSP spectrum in the top right panel. The chargino NLSPs almost entirely vanished
and the right-handed smuon took its place instead, however the 1 and  -sneutrino also appear
as NLSPs in non-negligible amounts. All R, 1 and  thereby can be mass-degenerate with
the LSP up to about 10 GeV. In case both the relic density and a are required to be correct
(bottom panel), the picture does not change much in terms of NLSP distributions and is just
a subset of the top right panel. A noteworthy change however is that for right-handed smuon
NLSPs, the LSP mass is now favoured to lie between 200300 GeV instead of 100400 GeV. In
case of stau or tau-sneutrino NLSPs, the LSP mass range is only slightly reduced.
Lastly in figure 2.13, we show the a-h2 plane and the respective experimental 1 bounds
as grey shaded rectangle. There a numerous points in the vicinity of the desired relic density and
still several points in both the relic density and a 1 reference bounds. From these points, we
chose the most interesting ones for a second set of benchmarks, listed in table 2.5 below.

2.6 Vacuum Stability
To ensure elecrtoweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) is caused by the Higgs vevs, SoftSUSY applies
two-loop tadpole contributions in its minimisation conditions. These are then used to fix theory
parameters such that the desired vacuum is a minimum of the scalar potential. While this ap-
proach in general is convenient, it usually does not take into account all possible solutions to the
minimisation conditions and hence there might exist solutions lying lower in the scalar potential
of the theory. Additonally, charge and colour-breaking (CCB) vevs, which might also lie lower
than the desired vacuum, are typically ignored as well.
To exclude the possibility of providing benchmarks that suffer from CCB minima, minima
lying lower than the desired vacuum or vacua that are not long-lived (meta-stable), we performed

a numerical analysis of the tree and one-loop effective potential for a set of handpicked possible
benchmarks5 using Vevacious [117]. Although approximate analytical conditions for the avoid-
ance of CCB minima exist for the MSSM, a full numerical study of the one-loop effective potential
is often needed as the conditions are neither sufficient nor necessary to ensure the absence of such
minima [118]. Additionally, such analytical rules are based on a tree-level analysis and are thus
irrelevant for points where the symmetry breaking occurs only at one-loop.
The numerical analysis showed that the points considered can be classified by mainly two
different aspects. First, quite often the EWSB minimum appears only after two-loop contributions
to the effective potential have been considered6 and for such points, Vevacious is not able to
investigate the vacuum stability due to its current restriction to one-loop effective potentials.
Second, there are also several points where the EWSB minimum develops at tree or one-loop level
and Vevacious can be used to investigate the stability of these points.
In the small  scenario (see section 2.5.2), all studied points had the desired vacuum matching
the global minimum of the one-loop effective potential. We then picked five of these points as
benchmarks, shown in table 2.3. In the large  scenario, the situation is not as clear as in the
small  case and different points yield different minima. An overview of the studied points and
5A point is considered a potential benchmark if it satisfies all constraints from section 2.4.
6This can be attributed to the fact that the desired vacuum arises as a solution of two-loop minimisation
conditions.

Additionally, points that have a stable or long-lived vacuum tend to larger values of |At| (left
panel) as well as larger A0 and lower tan  (right panel). This is due the fact that larger tan 
result in smaller m2R , thus increasing the probability for  vevs. In return, lower values of tan 
allow for higher A0 and |At|, making this a combination that satisfies both all constraints from
section 2.4 as well as vacuum stability. The points for which the desired vacuum is either the
global or long-lived minimum (red and orange points in figure 2.14) correspond to the benchmark
points shown in table 2.5.
2.7 Conclusions
The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is still a prime target of study for new physics
at a relatively low mass scale due to its large tension with the SM. One of the most promising
theories to explain these new physics is the MSSM with light sleptons as well as light charginos
Chapter 2. MSSM (g  2) and DM from GUT scale Pati-Salam
and neutralinos, which is able to fully account for the experimentally measured a at one-loop
level. A SUSY spectrum as light as the one required to explain a contrasts the absence of
coloured sparticle discoveries (squarks and gluinos) at the LHC and hence leads to strict bounds
on such sparticles with their masses typically required to be at the TeV scale. Furthermore, the
Higgs mass also requires at least some stop masses in the multi-TeV range within the scope of the
MSSM.
Although spectra with light sleptons and gauginos together with strong constraints on coloured
sparticles may navely look inconsistent, there actually are not many experimental limitations on
such spectra. This is due to the LHC being significantly less sensitive to colour singlets than to
coloured particles. Simultaneously, from the theory side, accomodating light sleptons together
with heavy squarks for all generations at the weak scale is highly challenging within the cMSSM
or mSUGRA models with universal sfermion masses at the GUT scale. This task gets even more
difficult if several collider and non-collider constraints such as the DM relic density are taken into
account as well.
Due to this tension, MSSM models with non-universal sfermion masses at the GUT scale are
strongly favoured, as long as they do not introduce excessive flavour changing neutral currents
or a plethora of new parameters (like the MSSM with its more than 100 parameters). While
the pMSSM falls into this category, it still contains 19 SUSY parameters and is not particularly
well theoretically motivated. In this chapter, we use a more constrained model than the pMSSM,
but less constrained than the cMSSM. In particular, we consider a model with four scalar soft
masses at the GUT scale, namely m0 (a universal left-handed scalar mass) and mi for i = 1, 2, 3
(a universal right-handed scalar mass for each family i) together with non-universal gaugino and
trilinear soft masses. This enables us to have the first and second family sleptons light in order
to successfully explain a while at the same time having m3 large enough to provide enough
mass for the Higgs boson and to keep the agreement of further observables such as Br(b  s)
and Br(Bs  +) valid.
In a comprehensive scan over the soft parameter space of the model, we confirmed the exist-
ence of viable points in two distinguishable regions satisfying both a as well as dark matter
constraints , i.e. in regions of small  and regions of large , which we subsequently investigated in
2.7. Conclusions
detail separately. For both regions, we were able to understand the dominant contributions lead-
ing to a as well as the characteristics of the DM candidate, all while being in conformity with
all other experimental constraints. Exemplarily, we pinned down the responsible SUSY particle
for the effective co-annihilation by investigating the NLSP and also investigated the LSP-NLSP
mass splitting, which is of high importance e.g. for collider experiments. For each solution scen-
ario, we then proposed a set of benchmarks and checked their vacuum stability, which is especially
important in the large  scenario due to possible two-loop effects.
In case  is small ( . 400 GeV), the LSP is a bino-like neutralino annihilating in the early
universe either resonantly, if its mass is around half the Z or Higgs boson mass, or via co-
annihilation with the higgsino states, if  is approximately 15 GeV larger than the LSP mass.
All benchmarks provided are chosen with a large mass gap of about 100 GeV between the LSP
and the right-handed smuon. This allows for hard muons arising from smuon decays at the
LHC, resulting in comparably clear signals. For all points with small , a is dominated by
diagrams (B) and (E) of figure 2.2. In case of large  . 3 TeV, the LSP again is a bino-like
neutralino, co-annihilating in the early universe with NLSPs either 1,  , 2 or  depending on
the precise parameters. a, in contrary, comes entirely and dominantly from diagram (A) of
figure 2.2. Both scenarios contain heavy gluinos (above 2 TeV), which result in heavy squark
masses satisfying current LHC bounds. Likewise, both scenarios contain light smuons (100 
300 GeV), which can be accessible via leptonic signatures at the LHC. In addition, the small 
scenario comprises light and almost mass-degenerate charginos and next-to-lightest neutralinos,
which exhibit di or tri-lepton signatures that can be accessible in the near future as well.
In conclusion, the MSSM with a Pati-Salam gauge group broken at the GUT scale and flavour
symmetries A4 and Z5 unifying the soft masses of the left-handed (but not right-handed) squarks
and sleptons, provides a well motivated framework with a relatively low number of input soft
masses. The model is capable of accounting for a and provides a well suited bino-like neutralino
as dark matter candidate, all while being consistent with all other experimental and theoretical
constraints. It is also very worth stressing that the A to Z of Pati-Salam model was not designed
to explain a (unlike some other models), but focussed on flavour mass and mixing of quarks
and leptons, but especially neutrinos. Nonetheless, the model is very well capable of explaining
Chapter 2. MSSM (g  2) and DM from GUT scale Pati-Salam
the experimentally observed a and provides characteristic SUSY spectra different enough to
be distinguished from other less well motivated models such as the pMSSM.
3 | LHC Implications of MSSM (g  2)
and DM from SU(5) A4
3.1 Introduction
While the Pati-Salam model studied in chapter 2 offers viable solutions for a and DM, its
LHC signatures are currently not being probed. This is not a problem in general, however there
exist other variations of the MSSM explaining a and DM that may lead to signatures the
LHC is more sensitive to, as will be discussed below. In particular, such models could comprise
light gauginos and light sleptons (especially smuons, if a shall be explained), however with
a sufficiently large mass gap between the LSP and the next heavier particles in order to avoid
soft particles arising from NLSP decays. It is possible to account for these features in models
with non-universal gaugino masses, e.g. in GUT scale models (such as SU(5) and SO(10)),
where the non-universality can be achieved by non-singlet F -terms or a linear combination of
such terms [119126]. In the most general situation of having all gaugino masses as independent
parameters, a recent work showed that it is possible to explain both a as well as DM successfully
within an SU(5) framework [127]. Apart from the independent gaugino masses, two soft masses
mF and mT accommodating the 5 and 10 representations respectively, were considered therein,
while the soft Higgs masses were set equal to mF .
In this chapter, we also consider an SU(5) model, but with an additional A4 family symmetry.
This results in the three 5 representations to form a single triplet of A4 with mass mF , whereas
the three 10 representations are singlets of A4 with soft masses mT1, mT2 and mT3 instead of
Chapter 3. LHC Implications of MSSM (g  2) and DM from SU(5)A4
one universal mass mT . We will show that even with such family-non-universality, a cannot
be explained with universal gaugino masses. Fully non-universal gaugino masses (M1,M2)M3,
on the other hand, may lead to viable a with  ' 300 GeV, while further providing a stable,
bino-dominated neutralino as DM candidate and fulfilling all other experimental constraints. We
will also provide a set of benchmarks this region of parameter space and explore their LHC
phenomenology, which is more exciting compared to Chapter 2 due to the respectively lighter
mass spectra comprising a right-handed smuon around 100 GeV and all other neutralinos and
charginos below about 300 GeV. All other masses lie in the multi-TeV range.
The layout of the remainder of this chapter is as follows: In section 3.2, we present the
SU(5)  A4 model and its symmetry breaking to the MSSM. In section 3.3, the MSSM one-
loop contributions to a are briefly summarised and we give first predictions for viable regions
of parameter space of the model. Any experimental limits we consider from both collider and
cosmological side are listed and explained in section 3.4. Scans of the model parameter space for
universal, partially non-universal and fully non-universal gaugino masses are shown in section 3.5.
Lastly, we draw our conclusions in section 3.6.
3.2 The Model
The model under study is an SU(5) with A4 family symmetry. The former is a rank 4 group and
comprises 24 gauge bosons, which transform in the 24 adjoint representation. Left-handed quark
and lepton families are neatly accommodated into the 5 and 10 representations (which we label
as F and T respectively) and read


, T =

0 ucg ucb ur dr
. 0 ucr ub db
. . 0 ug dg
. . . 0 ec
. . . . 0

(3.1)
3.2. The Model
with r, b, g being the quark colours, c denoting CP conjugation and T being antisymmetric as
expressed by the dots in the lower triagonal part.
The SU(5) gauge group may be broken to the SM by a Higgs multiplet in the 24 representation,
SU(5) SU(3)C  SU(2)L  U(1)Y . (3.2)
The 5 and 10 representations then transform as
5 dc(3,1, 1/3) L(1,2,1/2) , (3.3)
10 uc(3,1,2/3)Q(3,2, 1/6) ec(1,1, 1) , (3.4)
and (Q, uc, dc, L, ec) corresponds to a complete quark and lepton SM family.
Furthermore, the electroweak symmetry can be broken by Higgs doublets Hu and Hd (as
appearing in two Higgs doublet models), which may arise from the SU(5) multiplets H5 and
H5, if their colour triplet components can be made heavy. This is known as the doublet-triplet
splitting problem.
Once the A4 is combined with the SU(5), it is common to unify the three families 5  F 
(dc, L) into a triplet of A4 with mass mF . The three 10 representations Ti  (Q, uc, ec)i, on the
other hand, are singlets of A4 and have independent soft masses mT1,mT2,mT3 [128132]. The
Higgs doublet masses mHu and mHd are unconstrained, however we will assume for simplicity
mF = mHu = mHd .
Finally, we have the following soft scalar masses in the SU(5)A4 model:
mF = mDc
= mLi = mHu = mHd ,
mT1 = mQ1 = mU1c = mE1c ,
mT2 = mQ2 = mU2c = mE2c ,
mT3 = mQ3 = mU3c = mE3c , (3.5)
where it is worth mentioning that e.g. the stop masses are completely contained in mT3 and the
right-handed smuon mass comes from mT2.
Chapter 3. LHC Implications of MSSM (g  2) and DM from SU(5)A4
3.3 MSSM One-loop Contributions to a
Since the SU(5)  A4 breaks down to the MSSM, the one-loop contributions to a are the
same as already explained in section 2.3.2 and no new contributions arise. For convenience and
comparability, we will therefore take over the same short notation as introduced in section 2.3.2,
i.e. referring to equations (2.13a) to (2.13e) as diagrams (A) to (E).
Even though the Pati-Salam model from chapter 2 and the SU(5)  A4 model both break
down to the MSSM, they feature completely different GUT scale boundary conditions and hence
may lead to entirely different phenomenological implications. In the following, we qualitatively
estimate the relevant contributions to a coming from the SU(5)  A4 with its different GUT
scale boundary conditions and motivate the different sign choices of the higgsino mass parameter
One of the most important parameters in any MSSM scenario to provide viable a is , or
rather sgn. Positive  results in positive contributions from diagrams (A), (C) and (E), whereas
negative  results in diagrams (B) and (E) positively contributing to a. The particular case of
negative  thereby is especially hard to accommodate in models such as the cMSSM and it has been
shown that the cMSSM cannot account for a and further experimental limits simultaneously,
regardless of sgn (see e.g. [36, 37, 83]). If the cMSSM is extended or its constraints relaxed, the
above statement is not true any longer and new solutions without the need for fine tuning arise
 all while being in conformity with all other low energy observations [29,36,37,74103].
In this chapter, we have found regions in the model parameter space that lead to viable a
with a particularly light mass spectrum for negative , whereas solutions with large positive  ' 2
5 TeV are possible in general, but with a slightly heavier mass spectrum (see e.g. Ref. [102]). With
negative , at least one of the smuons (either left or right-handed) is required to be light to provide
the desired a from diagrams (B) and (D) while keeping the gaugino mass parameters positive
and small as well. Contributions from diagrams (A), (C) and (E) yield negative contributions to
a, so they need to be small or suppressed in another way to provide the correct a. The
suppression of diagram (A) and (C) can be achieved by having a heavy L, however at the cost
of also suppressing diagram (D). This is fine as long as the right-handed smuon can be made

by two different GUT scale parameters, mF and mT2 respectively. Choosing a heavy mL based
on a heavy mF effectively suppresses diagram (E) as well, as the muon sneutrino mass appearing
therein (see equation (2.13e)) is also controlled by mF and will acquire a mass similar to mL .
Overall, to fully account for a we therefore desire negative , light mR , light gaugino mass
parameters M1/2 (or M1 and M2 in case of non-universality) and heavy mL . Finally, before
actually scanning the parameter space for such solutions in section 3.5, we briefly summarise the
experimental constraints considered for this chapter in section 3.4 below.
3.4 Experimental Constraints
In analogy to the Pati-Salam model studied in chapter 2, the SU(5)  A4 model also needs to
explain any low-energy observations coming from various experiments. These include all observa-
tions listed in section 2.4, but with updated DM DD limits coming from the Xenon1T experiment.
In particular, the Xenon1T data provides the current best limit on DM direct detection with
DD-SI  7.641047 cm2 = 7.641011 pb [133] for spin-independent models and a WIMP-mass
of 36 GeV. WIMP masses smaller or larger than 36 GeV lead to weaker limits, hence making this
choice conservative.
For convenience, all considered experimental limits are summarised once more below in table 3.1,
while a more detailed explanation can be read again in section 2.4. Regarding the relic density,

we allow the possibility of our model not fully accounting for it, thus choosing h2 . 0.1224. The
Higgs boson again is plagued by theoretical errors in the radiative corrections to its mass inherent
in the existing state of the art SUSY spectrum generators and we therefore allow Higgs masses of

Lastly, we also take into account several 8 and 13 TeV ATLAS and CMS searches at the
LHC, which will be discussed in detail in the following section 3.5 below.
3.5 Results
Based on the previous thoughts in section 3.3 on enhancing a with the available GUT scale
parameters, we desire the following parameter choices:
 mF large for large mL and mL ,
 mT2 small for light mR ,
 mT1 and mT3 large for large squark masses,
 M1 small for light 01,
 tan  large (affects all diagrams).
All other parameters are in principle unconstrained, but in practice will be constrained by the
experimental constraints from section 3.4 and from further LHC searches.
The data for this work was acquired as follows: First, a GUT scale input point was chosen
either randomly or on a fixed grid (with variable grid spacing) and its corresponding mass spec-
trum and decay table were computed using SPheno v4.0.3 [134, 135]. In the next step, we used
micrOMEGAs v3.6.9.2 [116] to compute a and all low-energy constraints listed in section 3.4.
Other than in chapter 2, we did not discard points not fulfilling certain constraints, but kept all
data in order to also acquire some information on possibly excluded parts of the parameter space.
In the following two subsections, we present scans where the above considerations have been
taken into account. In particular, subsection 3.5.1 refers to the case of universal gaugino masses
(commonly labelled as M1/2) and subsection 3.5.2 refers to the case of partially non-universal
gaugino masses, i.e. M1,2 and M3. The last case of fully non-universal gaugino masses M1, M2
and M3 is addressed in subsection 3.5.3.

As it turns out, the vast majority of the mT3-M1/2 plane leads to either no radiative EWSB
or charged DM, leaving only a narrow stripe of physical solutions at the low scale. This stripe is
characterised by increasing a and a narrower cone of solutions when followed to larger mT3 and
smaller M1/2. Around (mT3,M3) = (5.3, 1.3) TeV, the points leading to non-zero a vanish and
Chapter 3. LHC Implications of MSSM (g  2) and DM from SU(5)A4
the region of no radiative EWSB is entered. When having a closer look at a, we observe that
it ranges from 0 to a maximum of 1.8 1010 in the bottom right peak, which is about 1020 times
smaller than experimentally observed. This behaviour is actually expected and can be explained
by the structure of the a one-loop contributions from equation (2.13) and the assumptions
made earlier in section 3.3. With negative , diagrams (B) and (D) yield the only positively
contributing terms to a and differ only in the exchange of M1 and M2 as well as mR and mL
(the difference of the fine structure constants 1 and 2 is negligible for the following argument).
The loop functions (2.14), defined only between 0 and 1, are also rather a factor of suppression
than an enhancement to a and will be irrelevant for the following argument. For a moment,
we therefore make the conservative assumption of all loop functions equalling 1  independent of
their arguments x and y. In this particular case, we see that a is governed by the prefactors of
equations (2.13b) and (2.13d), which are proportional to M11 and M
2 respectively. Now with
universal gaugino masses at the GUT scale, the low scale M1 and M2 will not be much different,
therefore allowing us to focus on just one diagram, e.g. diagram (B). Suitable a now can only
be achieved if M1 is small and of order 200 GeV. This, however, is in strong tension with current
ATLAS [136] and CMS [137] gluino searches at the LHC, excluding gluino masses below about 1.6
TeV and thus requiring a large gluino mass parameter M3. With M1  O(200) GeV at the GUT
scale, however, M3 at the low scale will be larger, but not large enough to escape the gluino mass
limits, hence leading to a contradiction and eventually to the statement that universal gaugino
masses (in case of negative ) cannot lead to viable a. A supporting, but secondary argument
lies in the observation of too light M1/2 preventing radiative electroweak symmetry breaking from
occuring, as can be seen in figure 3.1.
While the discussion above already is enough to rule out universal gaugino masses when
requiring a and collider and non-collider constraints to be fulfilled, it is nevertheless worth to
have a look at the DM aspects (i.e. the relic density h2 and the DM DD limits) and the 
dependence of a. This is shown in the following figure 3.2.
The relic density, shown in the left panel of figure 3.2, is well situated compared to the
experimental limit and exceeds it only for very small a close to zero. With increasing a, the
relic density slightly converges to some value between its minimum and maximum reach, which

is spread out by at most two orders of magnitude. While this shows that the relic density is
not an issue and can be easily accounted for with universal gaugino masses, the picture changes
drastically when including the DM DD limits (see colour-coding in figure 3.2). For any point
in parameter space and any relic density, DD-SI  1010 pb and thus fully excluded by the
Xenon1T data. This is no surprise, as dark matter in this setup is dominantly higgsino-like (due
to M1/2) and couples significantly to the Higgs boson, further resulting in large DM DD cross
sections. The latter is true, since DM can interact with nuclei only via squark or Higgs exchange
in case of spin-independent direct detection. While the squark contributions to DD-SI are small
due to the large squark masses, the Higgs contributions are much larger due to the comparably
much lighter Higgs mass. Therefore, the stronger the DM coupling to the Higgs, the larger DD-SI
becomes.
In the right panel of figure 3.2, the change of a as a function of  is shown. As anti-
cipated, smaller values of || lead to an enhancement of a, while the relic density decreases
simultaneously due to DM in form of the lightest neutralino 01 becoming more higgsino-like.
In summary, we did not find a region in the model parameter space explaining both a as
well as all other experimental constraints with universal gaugino masses M1/2. On the other hand,
relaxing this unification by allowing for partially non-universal gaugino masses M1 = M2 M1,2

and M3 may lead to viable results, as then the gluino can be made heavy enough to escape LHC
bounds while keeping M1,2 sufficiently light to provide the desired a. This setup is studied in
detail in the following section 3.5.2.
3.5.2 Partially Non-Universal Gaugino Masses
With partially non-universal gaugino masses, we can fix M1,2 to some value light enough to
enhance a while keeping M3 heavy to escape gluino mass bounds. In particular, we scanned
over the mT3-M3 plane with
mT3  [500, 7000] GeV ,
M3  [500, 7000] GeV
and all other parameters fixed as shown in table 3.3 below. To be able to compare the two cases

Table 3.3: Input parameters at the GUT scale in GeV for non-universal gaugino masses M1,2 and
of universal and partially non-universal gaugino masses more easily, we first present the mT3-M3
plane (analogue to figure 3.1) in figure 3.3 in case of split gaugino masses.
While the overall shape of solutions for non-zero a in parameter space looks similar, there
are far more solutions yielding small a in the band around and especially below the elliptic
stripe (purple area). The characteristic stripe itself now ends at (mT3,M3) ' (4.5, 2.48) TeV with
a  3  109 at its peak, hence perfectly matching the experimental observation. This can be
seen in detail in the right panel of figure 3.3, which shows a zoomed excerpt of the left panel. In
this excerpt, we also note that the stripe with large a extends slightly into the unphysical
region without radiative EWSB or where DM is charged. These points however are excluded by
LEP searches due to too light charginos or smuons [138]. A second set of solutions now shown in
figure 3.3 arises for M3 & 3 TeV and mT3 & 6.5 TeV, however with vanishingly small a.
Comparing these results to figure 3.1 with universal gaugino masses, we see that splitting the

gaugino masses indeed allows us to achieve the desired a. However, we still have to check the
other experimental constraints such as the relic density and DM DD limits. In figure 3.4, we
therefore show the relic density-a plane with colour-coded DM direct detection cross sections,
analogue to figure 3.2, left.
Unlike with universal gaugino masses, where due to the smallness of DM was mainly higgsino-
like, it predominantly consists of the bino component now. The relic density also is distributed
similar, while at the same time being about one order of magnitude larger. The direct detection
cross sections on the other hand have been reduced significantly, but they decrease with increasing
a, which in general is in tension with what would be desirable. To further investigate DD-SI,
we show a zoomed excerpt of the rectangle in the left panel of figure 3.4 in its right panel. Also
note that the logarithmic scaling of DD-SI was removed and values with DD-SI > 10  1011 pb
are also shown in red to enhance comparability with the experimental reference bound (reading
DD-SI = 7.64  10
11 pb). It turns out that most points in the 1 reference bounds of a and
h2 are excluded by the DM DD limits and only a small fraction of points with a at the bottom
of the 1 bound survives.
While the tension between a and DD-SI already becomes clear from figure 3.4, it is worth
showing DD-SI directly as a function of a, which corresponds to replotting figure 3.4 with

switched relic density and DD-SI. This is shown in figure 3.5 below and it becomes clear again,
that larger values of a lead to massively increasing DD-SI. The main reason for this is that with
increasing a,  acquires smaller and smaller negative values (approaching zero, see figure 3.6
below) and hence DM is not dominantly bino-like any longer, but contains a significant higgsino
component again. This in turn leads to a larger relic density and also a larger DM DD cross section
due to larger couplings of DM to the Higgs boson and subsequently an increased probability of
DM recoiling of a nucleus via Higgs boson exchange.
The aforementioned dependence of a on  is shown in figure 3.6 below, where it turns out
that viable a requires   [300,100] GeV. Having  even closer to zero will result on the
one hand in the just explained large higgsino component of DM  leading to an unwanted large
relic density and DM DD cross section  and on the other hand will eventually lead to too light
charginos already ruled out by LEP searches [138].
In figure 3.7, we show the mR-m01 plane with colour-coded relic density. As can be seen for
the benchmark BP1 (introduced later in table 3.4 below), it sits well above the line where the
right-handed smuon and LSP are mass-degenerate. This together with a non-vanishing higgsino
component of DM results in the correct relic density, since in addition to contributions from
the dominant R-01 co-annihilation (which just by itself would lead to too small h2), the relic

Next, in figure 3.8, the Higgs mass mh is shown as a function of a with colour-coded relic
density (left) and DM DD cross sections (right). Within this fixed set of GUT scale parameters as
defined in table 3.3 and free mT3 and M3, a peaks for Higgs masses around 126.5 GeV. Smaller
values of a open up the Higgs mass window, however it should be noted that the behaviour
depicted in figure 3.8 only represents one fixed set of GUT scale parameters. Different choices
of these parameters will lead to very similar distributions, but shifted along the mh-axis, thus
allowing for further Higgs masses to be accessible at large a.
To finish this discussion, we compare our findings with respect to a in figure 3.9 in case of
partially non-universal gaugino masses (orange squares) with those of universal gaugino masses
(purple diamonds). The lower horizontal axis thereby shows M3 at the low energy scale, whereas
the top horizontal axis refers to the gluino mass mg. It becomes obvious that universal gaugino
masses do not lead to viable a and would potentially violate exisiting gluino mass bounds,
if a were to somehow be increased any further. On the other hand, partially non-universal
gaugino masses lead to a good amount of points in the 1 reference bound of a (grey band)
and also exhibit a slightly squeezed a spectrum with respect to M3.
After the above discussion, we see that partially non-universal gaugino masses allow for points

fulfilling both a as well as all other experimental constraints as listed in table 3.1. The next
step therefore will be to check whether these points can be or already are probed at the LHC. To
do so, we first chose a set of characteristic benchmark points for that region of parameter space,
listed in detail in table 3.4 below. Therein, BP2 differs from BP1 mainly in having tan  = 28
and Atri = 0, whereas BP3 has a non-vanishing negative Atri and split mF and mT1.
Further characteristics of the benchmark include a bino-dominated 01 LSP being the DM
candidate with mass below about 100 GeV, a right-handed smuon R a few GeV heavier and
wino-dominated 02 and 
1 with mass gaps between them and the LSP of less than the Z or
W boson masses. The heavier neutralinos and charginos 03 and 
2 are higgsino-dominated and
feature masses below 400 GeV, while the remaining SUSY particle masses lie in the multi-TeV
range.
A SUSY spectrum with such a light electroweak sector usually predicts some characteristic
signals at the LHC. In our case, this will be a di- or tri-lepton signal coming from chargino
and second-lightest neutralino decays, i.e. from 1 
2 and 
1 -pair production. The neutralino
decays as 02  
 with the smuon decaying R  01 . The chargino, on the other hand, will
decay dominantly via virtual W bosons as 1  ff 
1. Due to a non-zero mixing between the left
and right-handed smuon, however, smuonic decays 1  
R  are almost as likely and therefore
cannot be neglected. The signal strength strongly depends on the mass gap m(R, 01) 
R-01 and can be comparably small, if m(R, 01) is small and thus the muons arising from
smuon decays are soft. The 02 decays are expected to yield a better signal strength, as they will
dominantly decay to smuons and muons with a large mass gap m(02, R)  02  R and thus
at least one not-so-soft muon.
To study these considerations for our benchmarks at the LHC, we performed a CheckMATE
2.0.11 [139] analysis including all implemented 8 and 13 TeV ATLAS and CMS analysises on
chargino and neutralino searches with light smuons. First, MadGraph 5.2.3.3 [109] linked to

the events. The fast detector simulation was perfomed using Delphes 3.3.3 [111] linked to

CheckMATE itself was used to analyse the prepared events and state whether the benchmark under
study is ruled out by experimental searches or still allowed. The rate of exclusion or potential
discovery thereby is given as the so called r-value, defined as [139]
S  1.64 S
where S is the number of predicted signal events with its uncertainty S and S95 is the exper-
imental 95 % upper limit on the number of signal events1. In case r  1, the signal is excluded,
whereas r < 1 indicates that the signal is not excluded or probed yet.
All three benchmarks are strongly excluded by the 8 TeV ATLAS search ATLAS 1402 7029 [113],
which is aimed at three leptons plus /ET . The reason why this 8 TeV analysis sets stronger bounds
on our signal than the respective 13 TeV analysis is due to well designed asymmetric pT cuts for
the final state leptons, allowing for a sensitivity to a second or third lepton with pT as low as 10
GeV. To the best of our knowledge, such low pT leptons are currently out of reach for analogue
13 TeV searches.
A summary of this benchmark study including the r-values and further properties of the
chargino and second-lightest neutralino is given below in table 3.5.
While it seemed that with partially non-universal gaugino masses, we would be able to find
physical spectra obeying all experimental constraints, the predicted light electroweak sector of
the model leads to a strong exclusion by corresponding LHC searches2. However, this is not
necessarily the end of the story, as we still have the freedom to further split M1,2 into M1 and M2
separately. The idea then is to slightly increase M2 and hence get heavier winos (02, 
1 ) while
keeping M1 constant. This idea is studied in detail in the following section 3.5.3.
3.5.3 Fully Non-Universal Gaugino Masses
Based on the previous results, we found that viable a and DM require a light neutralino 01
of order 100 GeV together with a slightly heavier right-handed smuon. This scenario, however,
stands in tension with universal GUT scale gaugino masses due to LHC gluino mass bounds
1Potential k-factors from next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections have not been taken into account.
2In case of solutions with large, positive , the 8 TeV LHC is not sensitive to such points due to the heavier
mass spectrum [102]

and also stands in tension with partially non-universal GUT scale gaugino masses due to lighter
wino-dominated charginos and neutralinos than allowed by several 8 TeV di and tri-lepton LHC
searches.
By further relaxing the gaugino non-universality to M1 < M2  M3, we will show that
the chargino and second-lightest neutralino can be made heavy enough to satisfy current LHC
constraints. As a side effect, M2 now can be larger than ||  300 GeV, hence resulting in
higgsino-dominated charginos and second-lightest neutralinos. Since this change of parameters
has only minor effects on the physics as shown in figures 3.3 to 3.8, we will not show further
scans, but limit ourselves to the more interesting LHC phenomenology by providing three new
benchmarks with M1 < M2 M3. These benchmarks, listed as BP4, BP5 and BP6 in table 3.6,
are very similar to the benchmarks BP1BP3 from table 3.4, however differ in now having higgsino
dominated 02 and 
1 with masses governed by ||  300 GeV and wino dominated 
3 and 
with masses governed by M2.

3.5. Results
Comparing the low scale mass spectrum to BP1  BP3 from table 3.4, we note that the main
difference lies in the now heavier 1 and 
2 due to the larger M2, as was anticipated. The
respective 1 and 
2 masses thereby cannot be increased much further, as they are governed by
||  300 GeV, which is necessary to account for a. Therefore, both 1 and 
2 remain in
target range for the LHC.
To study the actual reach of the LHC regarding the benchmarks BP4  BP6, we again per-
formed a CheckMATE analysis exactly as described at the end of section 3.5.2 and a summary of
this study is shown in table 3.7 below (analogue to table 3.5 for partially non-universal gaugino
masses).

In contrast to the results for partially non-universal gaugino masses, we now observe that all
benchmarks BP4  BP6 satisfy current LHC bounds, however it is worth noting that BP4 is on
the verge of exclusion with an r-value of 0.88. BP5 and BP6 are safer due to r  0.12, hence
requiring a significant increase in luminosity to be probed. The most sensitive analysis now is not
the 8 TeV analysis ATLAS 1402 7029 [113], but its 13 TeV successor ATLAS CONF 2016 096 [141]
aimed at chargino and neutralino production resulting in two or three leptons and /ET . Reasons
Chapter 3. LHC Implications of MSSM (g  2) and DM from SU(5)A4
for this loss of sensitivity lie in the overall smaller cross sections due to the larger neutralino and
chargino masses (see table 3.7), but also in the highly different branching ratios of 02 and 
1 . Due
to the large mass gap between the right-handed smuon and 02 as well as 
1 , decays to on-shell Z
and W bosons are now possible and especially the 02 can decay as 02  h 01 with a significant
branching ratio of more than 50 %, thus further reducing the LHC sensitivity.
While BP5 and BP6 are currently farthest from being probed at the LHC, future colliders
with a total integrated luminosity of about 3 ab1 will be able to effectively probe also these
parts of the model parameter space with di and tri-lepton signatures from higgsino production.
Furthermore, with the expected increase in sensitivity by a factor of two of DM direct detection
experiments in the next few years, the model parameter space under study can be probed entirely
and independently of any LHC constraints.
3.6 Conclusions
In this chapter, we explored a region in parameter space not studied before, which is characterised
by a small, negative higgsino mass parameter  ' 300 GeV. In this region, we argue that the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, a, and dark matter can only be accommodated in
GUT scale models breaking to the MSSM at the high scale in case of non-universal gaugino masses
M1 ' 250 GeV < M2 M3. Furthermore, a light right-handed smuon of order 100 GeV slightly
heavier than the lightest neutralino 01 (which is also the LSP) is required to satisfy current LHC
searches. The bino-dominance of the LSP together with the almost mass-degenerate R make the
01 a good DM candidate, as it thus can effectively co-annihilate in the early universe and provides
the observed relic density. The DM direct detection limits by Xenon1T, on the other hand, set
strong constraints on this scenario.
The particular model we considered was the well studied SU(5), together with an A4 family
symmetry. The three 5 representations of the SU(5) form a single triplet of A4 with a unified
soft mass mF , whereas the three 10 representations are singlets under A4 with independent soft
masses mT1, mT2 and mT3. While it is possible to have light R based on light mT2, a further
requires M1 ' 250 GeV. This is in contrast to LHC searches for gluinos and gauginos and hence
we extended the SU(5)  A4 model parameter space to include non-universal gaugino masses,
3.6. Conclusions
which is theoretically possible by having non-singlet F -terms in the SU(5). With this, it is worth
noting that the SU(5)A4 stands representative for a larger class of GUT scale models comprising
similar non-universal MSSM scenarios, where the left and right-handed sfermions are split and
where an especially light right-handed smuon is allowed.
After explicitly showing that universal gaugino masses M1/2 at the GUT scale are excluded
by LHC gluino searches, we performed benchmark studies on the cases of partially and fully
non-universal gaugino masses to find that the former case is excluded by LHC gaugino searches,
whereas the latter is still unprobed. However  and independent of the non-universality of
the gaugino masses  the model inevitably predicts   300 GeV, which leads to higgsino-
dominated gaugino masses of the same order posing an attractive target for future LHC searches.
In particular, di and tri-lepton searches with missing transverse energy are expected to fully ex-
plore this region of parameter space, once the LHC or another future collider reaches a luminosity
of about 3 ab1. The wino-dominated gauginos are expected to be slightly heavier than the
higgsinos, while the rest of the spectrum lies in the multi-TeV range and hence evades current
LHC bounds. Completely independent of the LHC searches, DM direct detection experiments
also provide an excellent way to further explore the model parameter space. If the current limits
are enhanced by a factor of about two (which is expected to happen in the following years), the
entire parameter space of the scenario we studied can be probed.
In conclusion, if the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon persists, we expect the SU(5)
A4 to comprise a right-handed smuon with mass around 100 GeV and a bino-dominated neutralino
01 only a few GeV lighter, thus representing a good DM candidate. Furthermore, the higgsino
mass parameter in this scenario is expected to be   300 GeV, leading to a light gaugino mass
spectrum that may be probed entirely and independently in the near future by the LHC and DM
direct detection experiments.
4 | DM Signals from Vector Reson-
ances and Top Partners at the LHC
4.1 Introduction
After exploring the phenomenology of two supersymmetric models in Chapters 2 and 3, we now
turn towards an alternative set of BSM theories addressing the issues of the SM discussed in sec-
tion 1.2. In particular, we focus on models able to explain DM that also agree with the requirement
of a 125 GeV Higgs boson. As explained in the first Chapter 1, it is not completely known yet
whether the discovered Higgs boson really is the SM one and hence, this discovery opened up
a window in the exploration of BSM physics. As such, the Higgs boson can be a fundamental
particle as in SUSY or the SM, but can also arise e.g. as the bound state of new fundamental
particles with some new strong dynamics, as realised in a theory called Technicolor (TC) [142,143].
These strong dynamics then are responsible for breaking the electroweak symmetry (analogue to
QCD) and, although the nature of the Higgs boson here is completely different as compared to
SUSY, its properties can be similar to the SM Higgs and consistent with LHC data [144]. Be-
sides TC, another class of theories addressing the issues of the SM with a fundamentally different
Higgs boson are Composite Higgs (CH) models [145147] (see also recent developments start-
ing from [148]), where instead of electroweak symmetry, a global symmetry of the high energy
model is broken by the new gauge dynamics1. Further alternatives include Randall-Sundrum
models [150, 151], Little Higgs models [152154], as well as Twin-Higgs models [155], also known
1It should be noted that CH models require UV completion with some new strong dynamics and therefore, TC
and CH models can appear as different limits of strongly coupled theories [149].
Chapter 4. DM Signals from Vector Resonances and Top Partners at the LHC
as neutral naturalness [156].
An important aspect of both TC and CH models is the prediction of integer spin bound
states, which we will minimally incorporate in our model in form of a Z  boson. Besides these
BSM resonances (typically lying at the TeV scale), many models apart from SUSY also include
a top partner sector, which can be important to keep the model technically natural. In case of
TC and CH models in particular, the top partners are bound states of new strong dynamics and
thus provide an attractive solution to the hierarchy problem without the use of supersymmetry.
Lastly, these models usually also address DM together with a parity (or a larger symmetry group)
keeping dark matter stable as well as a parity-odd dark matter sector.
In this chapter, we consider a simplified model incorporating the above mentioned ingredients,
i.e. both a vector resonance Z  as a consequence of the TC and CH predictions of integer spin
bound states, a fermionic vector-like coloured partner of the top quark T  as well as a scalar dark
matter candidate  arising via minimal gauge-invariant Yukawa interactions2 T t. We explore
the phenomenology of this model with a focus on the process pp Z   T T   tt, which gives
rise to a tt + missing transverse energy signature (tt + /ET ) signature due to the Z  decays into
two top partners T T . This signature has not been studied before when initiated by Z  decays
and we show that due to the extra Z , different kinematical distributions as compared to sole
QCD production of T T  (see Refs. [157159]) emerge. Another effect of the Z  is a  potentially
even dominant  enhancement of T T -pair production without conflicting with existing bounds
from Z  searches with di-jet3 and di-lepton final states. A similar observation has been made
before in the context of pair production enhancement of charge 5/3 top partners through SU(2)
triplet vector resonances [160]. We will show in this chapter that the Z , T  and DM masses can
be probed well beyond the reach coming only from QCD production, if the tt + /ET signature is
considered.
The remainder of this chapter is organised as follows. In section 4.2, we present the model and
2As a consequence of this coupling and the desired DM stability, both  and the top partners have the same
parity, which we assume to be negative DM parity.
3A jet in particle physics is a set of hadrons travelling along the same direction in a narrow cone. The jet forms
as a consequence of quark (or colour) confinement, which states that isolated quarks (or colour charges) cannot
exist freely, but are bound into colourless states. For example, after some high energy scattering process, partons
escaping the scattering center will undergo parton showering and eventually start to form colourless hadrons, which
is also known as hadronisation. The newly created hadrons travel in a similar direction as the initial hard parton
and therefore lead to a spray of hadrons within a narrow cone, which is what is referred to as a jet.
4.2. The Model
discuss its parameter space in detail. In section 4.3, we first describe the analysis setup and present
a parton-level analysis as well as study gluon-Z  interference effects. We then explore the model
constraints from di-jet and di-lepton LHC searches before eventually investigating the potential
of the LHC to probe our model parameter space via its typical signature tt + /ET , which arises
once Z , top partners and DM are considered simultaneously. Lastly, we draw our conclusions in
section 4.4.
4.2 The Model
The model under study is a simplified effective model containing a vector resonance Z , a fermionic
vector-like coloured top partner sector and a neutral scalar dark matter candidate . The Z  can
couple to both SM quarks and leptons as well as to top partners T s (SU(2) singlet) or Q = (T d, B
(SU(2) doublet)4. DM and the top partners are further assumed to carry negative DM parity and
MT  > m, whereas all SM particles and the Z  carry positive DM parity. This results in  being
a stable DM candidate coupling to both top quarks and top partners. For completeness of the
model, the remaining renormalisable DM couplings consist of a so called Higgs-portal coupling
HH2 and DM self-interactions 4. The full Lagrangian for this model (which we abbreviate as
ZP-TP-DM model) then reads
L = LSM + Lkin + LZq + LZ` + LZQ + LQ  V , (4.1)

In general, the Z  must not necessarily be associated to a gauge symmetry, in which case its
couplings are current-couplings unrestricted by gauge-invariance. For this reason, we treat the
Z  couplings to quarks, leptons and top partners as free parameters. Regarding the DM mass m,
we write the DM interaction with the Higgs doublet such that the electroweak contribution to m
is absorbed and m is the physical mass of . We would like to stress here that the DM-Higgs
interactions do not affect the tt+ /ET signature at the LHC in any way, however they are important
when considering constraints on the model coming from the relic density, DM direct (DD) and
indirect (ID) detection experiments as well as LHC constraints coming from invisible Higgs boson
decays H  .
Although even this simplified model comprises a wealth of parameters, we shall show in the
following that the number of actually relevant parameters for the LHC and DM experimental
studies is much smaller.
4.2.1 The Model Parameter Space and Analysis Setup
In this chapter, we focus on the tt+ /ET final state, which can be produced via T -pair production
through QCD interactions or through resonant Z  decays. In case of just QCD interactions, the
relevant parameter space to fully describe the tt+ /ET signature reduces to MT  and m. If also
the Z  is considered, its mass MZ as well as the Z  couplings to SM quarks, leptons (which we
will choose equal to the Z -quark coupling to be able to infer the results for other coupling ratios)
and the top partners further become relevant. Since the phenomenology between the top partner
singlet and doublet states is expected to be similar5, we consider only the singlets for this work,
5As a main difference to T s-pair production, T d-pair production also gets contributions from Z
  T dT d, which
however is highly suppressed. The kinematical distributions are nevertheless expected to be almost identical. As
4.2. The Model
i. e. T s.
As we will show in section 4.3.1 below, the effects of the chiralities of the Z  couplings are
negligible when studying the tt + /ET signature, thus allowing us to choose just one specific set
of chiral couplings. In particular, we choose all left-handed couplings, i.e. Zqq,L and ZT sT s,L
(abbreviated as LL), to be non-zero and all other chiral combinations to vanish.
The entirety of model parameters relevant to our study of the tt+ /ET signature at the LHC
hence comprises the following five parameters:
MT s , m, MZ , Zqq,L, ZT sT s,L .
(4.3)
The DM phenomenology  with a focus on the DM relic density as well as DM direct and indirect
detection  depends on two more parameters
H and T st , (4.4)
whose effects in combination with the top partners and Z  boson within this new model will
be illustrated below. Before doing so, however, we give a full description of our analysis setup
used to gather all results within the scope of this work. In particular, we used LanHEP [163
165] and FeynRules [166, 167] to implement the model described by the Lagrangian (4.2) in
CalcHEP [168] and MadGraph5 aMC@NLO [109], respectively. Both implementations have been cross-
checked against each other for scattering and decay processes and are available at HEPMDB [169]
under hepmdb:0717.0253 [170] for CalcHEP and hepmdb:0717.0253 [171] for MadGraph. Among
other features, HEPMDB allows to generate events using nothing more than the web-interface.
All respective parton level analyses have been carried out using MadGraph5 aMCNLO 2.3.3 and
CalcHEP 3.6.27 with the NNPDF2.3QED PDF [172]. The QCD renormalisation and PDF factor-
isation scales were set to Q = MZ .
After the event generation, we use Pythia v8.219 [140] for parton showering and hadronisation
a side note, it is also worth mentioning that the T d comes along its doublet partner B
d, which has a charge of 
and can also be pair-produced via QCD or Z interactions. The expected signature then is bb+ /ET and is similar
to jj + /ET , which has been studied in the context of QCD production of vector-like quarks followed by their decay
to light quarks and DM [162].
Chapter 4. DM Signals from Vector Resonances and Top Partners at the LHC
and subsequently perform a fast detector simulation using Delphes 3 [111] as well as FastJet
v.3.1.3 [173, 174] with a cone radius R = 0.4 for the jet reconstruction. The final detector
level analysis to probe the tt + /ET signature against current
s = 13 TeV ATLAS and CMS
constraints [175186] was performed using CheckMATE 2.0.0 [112,139].
To study the DM phenomenology at an illustrative level, we use micrOMEGAs v4.3.5 [116,187,
188] (together with the directly read-in CalcHEP model file) to compute the relic density h2 and
the DM direct (DD) and indirect (ID) detection cross sections. Regarding the latter, micrOMEGAs
computes the spin-independent cross sections SI for DM scattering off a proton at one-loop level.
The cross sections are then compared to the latest and currently strongest bounds for DM DD
limits, coming from the Xenon1T experiment [133]. As this data was not available in digitised
form, we digitised the limits ourselves and uploaded them to the PhenoData database [189].
In figure 4.1, we present LHC, DM DD and relic density constraints on the parameter space
of the ZP-TP-DM model in the
MT s
-m plane without Higgs portal couplings (H = 0), i.e. for
the case in which the relic density is fully determined by co-annihilation of  with the T s. The
current reach of the LHC for tt+ /ET coming from both Z  and QCD mediated T s-pair production
is shown as green area and will be discussed in detail in section 4.3.4. The thin dashed lines
with the respective labels indicate the iso-levels of MT s in GeV. While the green exclusion area
quantitatively agrees with the one from Ref. [159], we observe a larger exclusion range for small
T s due to the fact that we not only considered the ATLAS search ATLAS CONF 2016 050 [185], but
also considered limits coming from ATLAS 1604 07773 [177], which is more sensitive to smaller
mass gaps between the T s and DM. Besides the LHC limits, in figure 4.1 we also show the exclusion
limits from the Xenon1T data for T st = 10 as grey-shaded area. It should be noted that with
smaller values of T st (e.g. 0.3, 0.5 or 1.0), the Xenon1T data does not set constraints on the
parameter space yet, due to the DM DD cross sections scaling quadratically with T st and hence
becoming too small. Lastly, the blue, red, grey and yellow contours correspond to the T s and
DM masses resulting in a relic density of h2 = 0.12 as observed by PLANCK [104, 190] for
T st = 0.3, 0.5, 1 and 10, respectively. Any mass choices lying above these contours yield a relic
density larger than 0.12 and are thus excluded.
In summary, from figure 4.1 it becomes obvious that the LHC plays an important and com-

plementary role to the dark matter constraints in covering the m > mt region, which is not fully
constrained by non-collider experiments, especially not for larger values of T st.
As a side note, it should be mentioned that the available parameter space can be greatly
enhanced if a Higgs portal is considered (i.e. H > 0). In this case (and depending on the actual
value of H), the relic density gets contributions from DM annihilating through the Higgs boson
and thus larger T s masses (also for smaller m) remain allowed. Furthermore, a Higgs portal
also leads to a change of the DM DD cross sections, as now interactions of DM with nuclei via
Higgs exchange are possible. Finally, a non-zero H also results in Higgs decays to DM, if DM
is sufficiently light, and hence provides further limits on the parameter space from LHC Higgs
measurements.
Chapter 4. DM Signals from Vector Resonances and Top Partners at the LHC
In figure 4.2, we show the influence of an active Higgs portal on the parameter space for
H = 0.1 (top) and 0.3 (bottom) and with fixed T st = 1.
It turns out that even for non-zero T st, the narrow region around m =
2 is unconstrained
by non-collider searches due to the relic density being strongly reduced by a resonant DM anni-
hilation to the Higgs. The DM DD cross sections are also suppressed due to the rescaling with
the relic density, therefore rendering non-collider searches incapable of constraining the parameter
space at m ' mH2 . At the same timer, however, the LHC is able to effectively probe this region.
Exemplarily, the pink-shaded area corresponds to the LHC limit on invisibly decaying Higgs bo-
sons coming from ATLAS [191], which excludes BR(H  invisible) < 28 % at 95 % CL. The limit
itself is relevant only for m  62.5 GeV and for sufficiently large H & 0.015.
As mentioned earlier, these non-collider constraints are meant for illustration purposes only
and a more detailed discussion on this topic can be found in Refs. [159,162], where a similar model,
but without a Z , has been studied. Comparing these results to ours is still possible, however, as
the Z  does not affect the non-collider DM phenomenology.
4.3 Analysis of pp Z   T sT s  tt for the LHC
The relevant physics of our model with a Z  decaying to a T s-pair further decaying to a top quark
and DM, i.e. tt  can be summarised by the Feynman diagrams in figure 4.3. The same final
state can also be produced from QCD alone without a Z  boson, which we will study later in
section 4.3.4 in detail. Before that, we perform several short studies to investigate the impact
chiral couplings will have on kinematic distributions, possible interference effects between the Z 
and QCD induced final states as well as the validity of the Narrow Width Approximation (NWA)
or finite width effects of the Z . To briefly summarise the findings of these pre-studies already
here, we first find that the couplings Zqq, ZT sT s and T s t only have minor influence on the
kinematics at parton level, thus allowing us to choose one specific chiral combination for all further
studies, which will be Zqq,L and ZT sT s,L . Further, the aforementioned interference effects turn
out to be negligible and the NWA remains acceptably valid up to a ratio of 5 % of the Z  width
over its mass MZ ,
After these pre-studies, we determine the constraints on our model parameter space coming

via di-jet and di-lepton resonance searches in section 4.3.5 and finally for the full model based on
the process pp Z   T sT s  tt  in section 4.3.6. In section 4.3.7, we then perform a detailed
benchmark analysis.
4.3.1 Impact of Chiral Couplings on Kinematical Distributions
Since the Z  couplings appearing in the Lagrangian (4.2) are chiral, different coupling combinations
could lead to different kinematics of the involved particles. To determine the influence of these
coupling choices, we have used MadGraph5 aMCNLO 2.3.3 in conjunction with MadAnalysis to
generate and analyse several parton level distributions shown in figures 4.4 and 4.5 below. Therein,
we refer to the four possible chiral combinations as LL, LR, RL and RR, where the first letter
indicates the chirality of Zqq and the second letter indicates the chirality of ZT sT s . Furthermore,
we fix the couplings to Zqq = 0.25 and ZT sT s = 2.5 and the respective masses to MZ = 3 TeV,
MT s = 1 TeV and m = 500 GeV. Lastly, all events were generated based on a Z
 decaying to a
T sT
s-pair.
At first glance, all distributions (regardless of the coupling choices) appear to be nearly
identical. On closer inspection, this remains true for the largest part of the di-top invariant
mass (top left panel), the /ET spectrum (top right panel, evaluated for DM only) and the pT
distribution of the top or anti-top quark respectively (bottom right panel) with slight differences
only in the high-energy tails. As we shall show later in section 4.3.7, the difference between the
most extreme cases LL and RR is just about 12 %, therefore quantitatively justifying our point
of choosing just one chiral coupling combination for the remainder of this chapter. Regarding

the pseudorapidity  distributions of the top and anti-top quark6, LL and LR lead to similar dis-
tributions as do RL and RR. However in case of left-handed Zqq, the distributions are slightly
smaller and broader compared to the case of right-handed Zqq.
Although the distributions in figure 4.4 are not directly observable, they nevertheless define
and shape the distributions of the observable top quark decay products, shown in figure 4.5 below.
As an example, the lepton pT from W boson decays of a decaying top quark varies depending on
the top quark polarisation (see e.g. Ref. [158] and figure 4.5, bottom right panel).
In case the W bosons arising from the decaying top quarks further decay leptonically, we
observe slightly different pT distributions for different ZT sT s , but independently of the choice of

Zqq. In other words, RR and LR show a different behaviour than RL and LL. In particular, the
*R distributions are slightly harder, which has been observed previously (see Ref. [158]) and is due
to the influence of the polarisation of the top quark on the transverse momentum of its subsequent
decay products. However, this difference in pT only occurs for large pT and thus is not influencing
the efficiency of the cuts for the signature we study. The same observation can be made for the
M`` and /ET distributions, while it is also worth noting that the /ET distribution before and after
the top quark decays are quite similar. The ` distribution shows the same characteristics and
differences as the t distribution.
Based on these findings, in the following we will consider for simplicity the case where both
4.3. Analysis of pp Z   T sT s  tt for the LHC
Zqq and ZT sT s are left-handed (LL). This choice is also reasoned by the slightly softer lepton
pT , which results in turn in slightly lower cut-efficiencies compared to LR and RR and hence
makes this choice conservative.
Besides the influence of the chiralities, it is also instructive to explore the impact of the T 
production channel on the kinematics, i.e. when the T -pairs are produced via QCD mediation
alone or when produced via QCD and Z  mediation. This difference directly relates to the main
point of this chapter: the role of a Z  boson in exploring the tt + /ET signature at the LHC. In
figure 4.6, we present similar kinematical distributions as before for the cases of no Z , a Z  with
mass MZ = 2.5 TeV and MZ = 3 TeV. The couplings (which always are left-handed from now
on, i.e. LL) are chosen as Zqq = 0.25 and ZT sT s = 2.5.
One can observe that for `, the pT distributions are identical no matter whether a Z  is
included or not. For `+, however, the pT distribution is harder when a Z  is included in the
theory, especially for larger pT . The same holds for the /ET distribution, which benefits from the
Z  especially the larger /ET gets.
4.3.2 Interference Effects
T s-pairs can not only be produced via Z  bosons, but also via QCD interactions (see figure 4.3).
This results in possible interference effects, which we determine by comparing cross sections for
each production channel alone as well as for the combined channel, where the T s-pair can be
produced via either Z  or QCD interactions. We computed the cross sections using MadGraph5
2.3.3 [109] while thereby trying to maximise the interference effects by choosing the couplings
and masses such that the Z -mediated and gluon-only cross sections are nearly identical. Lastly,
the Z  width might also affect interference effects, and we take this into account by studying
two parameter points: one with a narrow Z  width (MZ = 2.5 TeV, MT s = 1 TeV, Zqq = 0.3,
ZT sT s
= 0.58) and one with a very broad Z  width (MZ = 2.5 TeV, MT s = 1 TeV, Zqq = 0.21,
ZT sT s
= 4.7). The results are summarised in table 4.1. Overall, we find the interference effects
to be small with a 2.5 % (3.6 %) gain in cross section for the case of a narrow (broad) Z  width
respectively and the interference is always constructive.

4.3.3 Narrow Width Approximation and Corrections
The NWA is a powerful tool to estimate cross sections for different model parameters quite
precisely, as long as the relevant resonance width is small. To be able to give precise predictions
based on the NWA also for larger widths, the NWA needs to be corrected. In figure 4.7, we show
the cross sections for pp Z   T sT s7 in the NWA (black line) and computed with CalcHEP [168]
(red +) for MZ = 3 TeV, MT s = 1.2 TeV, Zqq = 0.1, Z`+` = 0 and varying ZT sT s . The
relative difference between the two (normalised to the CalcHEP result) is shown as blue crosses.

increasing Z/MZ up to about 5 %, the NWA gets less accurate and the estimated cross section
only matches the real cross section up to a 10 % difference. Increasing Z/MZ even further results
in leaving the scope of application of the NWA and an exponentially fast increasing difference in
cross sections. As such, Z/MZ of about 20 % results in a difference in cross sections of roughly
40 %. It should also be noted that the NWA always overestimates the real cross section, which
Chapter 4. DM Signals from Vector Resonances and Top Partners at the LHC
would lead to over-optimistic limits. However, this issue can easily be tackled by adapting the

4.3.4 QCD-induced T s Pair Production
With the preliminaries in place, we now move on to study the 13 TeV LHC limits on QCD-
induced T s-pair production, i.e. without considering the Z  boson. We use CheckMATE to simulate
50000 events for the process pp T sT s  tt  which are compared to current ATLAS and CMS
analyses [175186]. The majority of these searches focusses on SUSY-like final states with jets and
/ET , thus matching our proposed sigature tt+ /ET . Furthermore, the limits for T s-pair production
only depend on the top partner and DM masses MT s and m, as these parameters fully fix the
relevant kinematics and cross sections. The limits themselves are computed by CheckMATE in form
of the r value from equation (3.6), where again k-factors from NLO corrections have not been
taken into account. Rearranging equation (3.6) allows to estimate the experimental limit in form

in fb without Z  mediation in dependence of MT s and m. m is given in GeV.
As it turns out, most limits come from the analysis ATLAS CONF 2016 050 [185], which aims
at top squarks in final states together with one isolated lepton, jets and /ET at
s = 13 TeV. The
most sensitive signal regions therein are tN high and SR1, where the first (latter) one is aimed
at high (low) mass splittings between t1 and 01. A large mass split results in highly boosted top
quarks, whereas a small mass split is responsible for all decay products to be fully resolved [185].
If this mass split gets very small such that the top quark coming from the T s decay is just on-shell
(i.e. when MT s & mt +m), ATLAS 1604 07773 [177] yields the best limits.
The first thing to note is that for MT s & 1.1 TeV, the experimental limits are nearly constant
at about 20 fb, which is due to the top quarks now always being heavily boosted. At the same
time, the signal cross section drops well below this limit due to the high suppression in cross
section coming from the heavy T s-pair. For top partner masses smaller than 1.1 TeV, an exclusion
window that heavily depends on the particular DM mass opens up. Smaller DM masses result in
Chapter 4. DM Signals from Vector Resonances and Top Partners at the LHC
a larger exclusion range, whereas for DM masses & 450 GeV, the exclusion window vanishes. The
window also closes once MT s & mt + m, whereas even smaller top partner masses would result
in off-shell top quarks with highly different kinematical distributions not studied in this thesis.
As a side note, the small portions of non-excluded MT s for m = 400 and 450 GeV in the
otherwise excluded area have no physical meaning, but correspond to a gap (or missing overlap)
between the signal regions tN high and SR1 from ATLAS CONF 2016 050. As an example, SR1 is
most sensitive to m = 400 GeV and MT s . 920 GeV, whereas for MT s & 920 GeV, tN high
immediately becomes most sensible. Due to the missing overlap between the two signal regions,
a kink or step is visible in the eperimental limits.
Based on the above findings, we will investigate the current experimental di-jet and di-lepton
limits in the
ZT sT
, Zqq
plane for MT s  1.1 TeV, which are generally safe for any m.
4.3.5 Di-jet and Di-Lepton Constraints
To determine the LHC di-jet and di-lepton limits on the
ZT sT

coupling space, we have
to extract and isolate the theoretical expression e.g. for Zqq. This can be done via the Z  width,
which reads

Finally, plugging equation (4.11) into (4.9) and (4.10) yields a combined upper bound on Zqq,
ZT sT
and Z`+` . Together with the experimental limits from ATLAS and CMS for di-jet [192,
193] and di-lepton [194, 195] searches, we show this bound in figures 4.9 (Z`+` = 0) and 4.10
(Z`+` = Zqq) for various combinations of MZ and MT s . The limits for ZT sT s > 0 were

It can be seen that the di-jet bounds already put rather strong limits on Zqq, however when
also considering the di-lepton limits, the latter clearly become dominant. While this observation
is nearly independent of MT s , going to smaller MZ will increase the experimental limits quite
visibly. In case MZ is close to 2MT s (see figure 4.9 and 4.10, top left and bottom right), the
parameter space opens up in the direction of 
ZT sT
and hence allows larger values of 
ZT sT
be realised without being in conflict with perturbativity. This is reasoned by the fact that AT s
becomes smaller the closer 2MT s approaches MZ (see equation (4.11)), thus allowing for larger

In summary, the di-jet and di-lepton limits alone already constrain large portions of para-
meter space, however mainly in the Zqq direction. Nevertheless, the fraction of parameter space
surviving, especially in the 
ZT sT
direction, is still large enough to motivate further studies.
4.3.6 LHC Reach Including Z  Bosons
The next step after investigating the di-jet and di-lepton bounds is to check our model para-
meter space against the proposed tt+ /ET signature. Before doing this for the full set of possible
Feynman diagrams, we focus on the Z  mediated part (left diagram of figure 4.3). We gener-

CheckMATE to analyse these events. As a result, the vast majority of points is constrained by the
search ATLAS CONF 2016 050 [185] in the tN high signal region and only a small set of points is
constrained by marginally stronger limits coming from ATLAS 1605 03814 [178] in the 2jt signal

a large fraction of parameter space with large 
ZT sT
, whereas for small 
ZT sT
, the di-jet and
di-lepton bounds become strong again. In general, the tt+ /ET limit abruptly starts and steeply
grows before very soon after hitting its maximum. Then, the limit slowly gets weaker with the
slope of this decrease depending on the mass gap M = MZ  2MT s . If M is small, the limit
is almost saturated and only slowly decreases with increasing 
ZT sT
(see top left and bottom
right panels of figures 4.11 and 4.12). If it gets larger, the limit decreases faster and the overall
shape of the exclusion lines gets smoother. While this behaviour for large 
ZT sT
can be reasoned
by the fact that BR(Z   T sT s)  BR(Z   qq) and therefore the production of a sufficient
amount of T s-pairs surviving the experimental cuts is ensured, the fast drop for small ZT sT s is
due to BR(Z   T sT s) . BR(Z   qq) and the subsequent suppression of T s-pair production.
Lastly, the tt + /ET limits decrease substantially with increasing MZ and for MZ & 4 TeV, the
limit becomes weaker than the di-jet and di-lepton limits (not shown here). As long as MZ . 3
TeV, however, the tt+ /ET limits are the strongest in terms of parameter space coverage and yield
complementary limits to the di-jet and di-lepton limits.

4.3.7 Detailed Benchmark Analysis
Based on the above studies, we now choose a specific benchmark point for further detailed in-
vestigation. This benchmark is set in the
ZT sT
, Zqq
plane and includes all T s production
processes as shown in figure 4.3. After a quantitative analysis of this benchmark, we will also
provide a qualitative discussion for other coupling choices. The benchmark we choose has
Zqq = 0.25 , ZT sT s = 2.5 , Z`+` = Zqq , (4.14)
and is chosen such that it covers all interesting states of exclusion depending on the chosen Z 
masses. This means being fully excluded, excluded only by our tt+ /ET signature and not excluded
at all.

An overview of the related cross sections for a variety of Z  and T s masses is shown in fig-

experimental limits for m = 10, 300 and 600 GeV respectively, whereas the number in the center
corresponds to our signal cross section coinciding with the colour coding. The various exclusion
limits can be cross-checked by pinning down the benchmark-couplings in the
ZT sT
, Zqq
plane
from figures 4.11 and 4.12 and then comparing with the numbers from figure 4.13. Exemplarily,
the mass pairs (MZ ,MT s) = (2.5, 1.2) TeV and (3, 1.2) TeV are strongly excluded, even without
the QCD contributions to T s-pair production, while (3.5, 1.7) TeV is currently not being probed
by neither limit due to its small cross section coming from the large Z  and T s masses.
To make the above picture more clear, we show the same data as in figure 4.13 again in
figure 4.14, however this time for constant MZ as well as variable MT s and m up to 600 GeV.
The red curves resemble the signal cross section, whereas the black symbols correspond to the
experimental cross section for m = 10, 300 and 600 GeV, respectively.
The advantage of the one-dimensional representation of the cross sections is the ability to spot

Chapter 4. DM Signals from Vector Resonances and Top Partners at the LHC
the signal exclusion easier and more precisely for each MZ . E.g. for MZ = 2.5 TeV, T s masses
up to 1.3 TeV lead to an exclusion of the signal and hence for the entire regime of on-shell T -pair
production. Increasing MZ to 3 TeV leads to similar results and the excluded region now starts at
MT s  1.51 TeV  just slightly after off-shell T
s-pair production starts. Further increasing MZ
to 3.5 TeV changes the exclusion range and now most of the on-shell T s-pair production regime
(starting from MT s = 1.16 TeV) remains unexcluded. For even heavier Z
, the Z  contributions
are too small to yield any new exclusion limit and all signal curves are excluded for MT s = 1.08
TeV, the limit from pure QCD T s-pair production as shown in figure 4.8.
While the analysis performed above is only true in that detail for the particular benchmark
coupling choices of equation (4.14), it is nevertheless possible to give qualitative statements for
other coupling choices. On the one hand, we can expect the influence of 
ZT sT
to be small, as the
di-jet and di-lepton bounds weaken fast for increasing 
ZT sT
and the tt+ /ET limit also weakens
with increasing 
ZT sT
, although not that fast. On the other hand, changing Zqq only slightly
can change the situation significantly, as increasing Zqq lead to rapidly growing cross sections
and hence also a rapid change of the limits.
Apart from the different Z  couplings, we can also estimate the influence of the Z  contributions
on the excluded MT s range for different MZ . To do so, we can use the fact that we observe
positive and negligible interference between the Z  and QCD-induced T s-pair production channels
(see section 4.3.2) and thus can simply add up the QCD signal cross sections and the Z  signal
cross sections. Regarding the former, we see from figure 4.8 that for MT s & 1.2 TeV, the QCD
signal contributions make up at most half of the experimental bound. However, when including
Z  bosons with masses  3 TeV, we observe the signal to be excluded (see figure 4.14, top row),
therefore indicating that the respective Z  contributions are dominating the signal cross section
by far. Additionally, this behaviour would only be reinforced by increasing Zqq. Once MZ gets
heavier, the Z  contributions shrink drastically and for MZ  4 TeV are too small to lift the signal
cross section over the experimental bound. This effectively results in a return to the QCD-only
exclusion picture from figure 4.8, as if there were no Z  boson at all.
The argument stated above is also true for MT s & mt+m up to MT s  mt+m+O(50 GeV)
(see figure 4.8, left ends of coloured lines), as long as m . 450 GeV and MZ  3 TeV. For the
4.3. Analysis of pp Z   T sT s  tt for the LHC
remaining MT s between mt + m + O(50 GeV) and 1.2 TeV, it is hard to give any qualitative
statement, as the signal strongly depends on m and a dedicated benchmark analysis as the one
we performed earlier needs to be done.
While this concludes the qualitative discussion of possible benchmark scenarios, let us return
once more to the benchmark from equation (4.14) and put all our findings in context with the dark
matter bounds presented in section 4.2. We do this by providing the exlcuded region of
MT s
parameter space when including the Z  boson in analogy to the green shape from figures 4.1 and
4.2. This is shown together with the relic density in the following figure 4.15 for the case of no
Z  at all (same as the green shape in figure 4.1) as well as for a Z  of mass 2.5 TeV (red shape)
and 3 TeV (blue shape). The respective DM couplings are H = 0 and T st = 1.

indicate the iso-levels of MT s in GeV.
Chapter 4. DM Signals from Vector Resonances and Top Partners at the LHC
While the limits without Z  bosons (green) already cover a large fraction of parameter space
up to m = 450 GeV, including the Z  contributions extends this range up to DM masses of 800
or 900 GeV for MZ = 2.5 or 3 TeV respectively. This in turn allows us to completely close the
gap between LHC and relic density constraints along the m axis. Once MZ  3.5 TeV, the Z 
contributions are too small to enhance the limits visibly (see paragraph above and figure 4.14,
middle and bottom row) and the QCD-only limits become maximal again.
Before concluding the benchmark discussion, we provide four more benchmarks in tables A1
and A2 in appendix C in order to get a better understanding of the kinematics of different
(MT s ,m) mass pairs. The CheckMATE cutflow in the lower part of the tables shows the fraction
of events surviving the respective cut (normalised to 1), while the last row in the cutflow section
(bold) corresponds to the overall efficiency. The impact of the Z  can then be estimated by
comparing the efficiencies between benchmarks. Supplementary, we also present in table A1 the
cutflow efficicency for the BP2-RR benchmark, which is analogue to the BP2 benchmark, but with
the RR Z  chiral coupling combination. It turns out that the overall efficiencies for BP2 (LL) and
BP2-RR differ only by about 2 %, which confirms our initial claim from section 4.3.1 about the
independence of the kinematics from the chiral coupling choices. Also, the overall efficiency when
including a Z  (see table A1) is about 10  15 % larger compared to the case of pure QCD T s-pair
production (see table A2) and thus non-negligible. One reason for this increase in efficiency is the
larger rapidity increase of a T sT s-pair coming from a Z  originating from qq-fusion as compared
to QCD-produced T sT s-pairs. Furthermore, the /ET distribution is harder when Z  bosons are
present and gets harder the heavier the Z  gets. Lastly, top partners coming from Z  decays will
be more boosted, resulting in more energetic but less isolated final state leptons.
4.4 Conclusions
In this chapter, we explored the phenomenology of a simplified, effective model comprising a
vector resonance Z , a fermionic vector-like coloured partner of the top quark T  and a scalar DM
candidate . We refer to the model as ZP-TP-DM model9 and its particle content appears in a

(CalcHEP) and hepmdb:0717.0253 [171] (MadGraph).

variety of models, including Composite Higgs models (if they provide a candidate for DM).
In particular, we studied the process pp Z   T T   tt  at the LHC, which to the best
of our knowledge has not been studied previously. The expected final states resemble SUSY stop-
pair production final states and we recasted existing ATLAS and CMS searches implemented in
CheckMATE to determine the level of coverage or exclusion of the ZP-TP-DM model. As it turned
out, the predicted tt+ /ET signature via Z  bosons provides important and complementary results
to those without Z  bosons (i.e. for pure QCD T -pair production).
Another key difference between QCD and Z -induced T T -pair production are the underlying
kinematics. In case of Z  mediation, more /ET as well as larger pT for any final state leptons
can be observed, especially for heavier Z  bosons. The final state leptons also show a larger
rapidity as compared to the QCD-induced final states. While larger lepton pT and /ET increase
the detector efficiency at colliders, the larger lepton rapidity decreases it. Overall, however, we
observe an increase in efficiency of about 10 % when including the Z . These efficiencies are
approximately identical for all possible chiral coupling choices, since we were able to show that
they only marginally affect the kinematical distributions. Lastly, the interference between the
QCD and Z -induced final states is essentially independent of the Z  width and constructive, but
also negligible at a level of just +3 %.
We have found that the presence of the Z  can provide an additional and even dominant
contribution (about one order of magnitude larger than the QCD one) to the tt  signature
without conflicting with existing bounds from Z  searches in di-jet and di-lepton final states. We
further showed that the tt+ /ET signature at the LHC acts complementary to non-collider searches
in setting limits on the ZP-TP-DM parameter space, thus making it a highly valuable tool for
its further investigation. Moreover, the tt + /ET signature allows to probe all new masses of the
model (MZ , MT  , m) well beyond the reach of QCD-induced T T -pair production alone without
conflicting with existing Z  searches from di-jet and di-lepton bounds. Exemplarily, a 3 TeV Z 
allows to access DM masses up to 900 GeV and T  masses up to about 1.5 TeV at the LHC (see
figure 4.15)  a quite remarkable increase by a factor of 2 for both masses as compared to QCD
production alone. Due to these largely improved reaches, Z -mediated top partner-pair production
may play an important role in future phenomenological studies and experimental searches.
Chapter 4. DM Signals from Vector Resonances and Top Partners at the LHC
As an outlook, there is another interesting fraction of model parameter space worth studying
in the future, characterised by MT  m < mt. This corresponds to the case of off-shell decaying
top quarks and exhibits highly different kinematics than the process we studied in this chapter.
However, it is worth stressing that such a scenario can in principle be studied analogously to the
SUSY scenario with degenerate stops and neutralinos.
5 | Precision Tests of Higgs Proper-
ties via VBF at Future Colliders
5.1 Introduction
In the last Chapter 4, we saw that BSM theories may very well explain a variety of issues of the
SM while simultaneously providing a 125 GeV Higgs boson with a completely different nature as
compared to e.g. SUSY or the SM itself. This is possible, since some of the Higgs properties
have not been measured with great accuracy yet and therefore allow for a variety of different
interpretations, as we have seen. Narrowing down these properties (and thus the nature) of the
Higgs boson is the task of experiments, such as those performed at colliders like the LHC, and it
will be the aim of this chapter to explore the potential of the LHC and possible future colliders
to narrow down the properties of the Higgs boson.
One way to further specify the Higgs boson affiliation is to simply increase the collision energy
of the particles colliding. This happened exemplarily in June 2015 at the LHC, where the collision
energy was increased almost by a factor of two from
s = 8 TeV to
s = 13 TeV. While this
increase already is anything but small, even higher energies might be necessary for various high
precision measurements, such as the ones to distinctly identify the Higgs boson. For this purpose,
future circular colliders (FCC) with collision energies up to 33 TeV (High Energy Large Hadron
Collider, HE-LHC) or 100 TeV (Very High Energy Large Hadron Collider, VHE-LHC) are being
planned [196]. Although these colliders do not exist yet, a variety of prospects and predictions for
a large number of theories have been made already  including Higgs physics and supersymmetry
Chapter 5. Precision Tests of Higgs Properties via VBF at Future Colliders
(see e.g. [197202]).
In this chapter, we work with an effective field theory (EFT) based on a non-linear  model
(NLM), where the Higgs boson arises as a field expansion in the EFT. As a consequence, the
Higgs couplings to itself and the gauge bosons differ from the SM couplings by a multiplicative
factor and can therefore take non-SM values. In that case, it is highly likely that the cross sections
for various processes increase by a substantial amount due to the lack of unitarity cancellations
at high energies. We study this potential increase in cross section based on the (non-SM) Higgs
couplings for several final states containing Higgs and gauge bosons at the LHC, HE-LHC and
VHE-LHC (i.e. for 13, 33 and 100 TeV respectively). After confirming that triple Higgs production
benefits most from anomalous Higgs couplings (as was shown previously in Ref. [203] for 14 and 33
TeV), we perform a detailed analysis on the degree and onset of unitarity violation in the case when
the three Higgs bosons arise via vector boson fusion. This together with a dedicated background
analysis shows that only a 100 TeV FCC is sensible to triple Higgs production, however on the
other hand with an accuracy ranging down to the permille level, provided the luminosity is large
enough.
In section 5.2 of this chapter, we introduce the non-linear  model and estimate the respective
unitarity bounds. In section 5.3, we present the influence of anomalous Higgs couplings on vari-
ous processes, before performing a more detailed study on triple Higgs production with a focus
on unitarity violation. After further computing the expected signal strengths for triple Higgs
production in dependence of the anomalous Higgs couplings and collision energies, we estimate
the respective background for this signal in section 5.4. Eventually, we draw our conclusions in
section 5.5.
5.2 Unitarity and the Non-linear  Model
One of the most important quantities to describe scattering processes in particle physics are
cross sections. While scattering processes with larger cross sections are more likely to occur, cross
sections cannot grow arbitrarily large, but are limited by unitarity as an upper bound. For a 2 n
particle scattering with collision energy s, the unitarity bound reads [204, 205] (see Appendix D
5.2. Unitarity and the Non-linear  Model
for a brief derivation)
(2 n) <
. (5.1)
On the other hand, the most general cross section for a 2 n scattering is proportional to
(2 n) 
|A|2(s) sn2 (5.2)
with 1
being the flux factor, |A|2(s) being the squared scattering amplitude and sn2 giving the
energy dependence of the phase space integral [204,206]
Rn(s) =
(2)3 (2Ei)3
(2)4 4
(2)43n(2 )
(n 1) (n 2)
sn2 (5.3)
for massless particles in four dimensions. By comparing equation (5.2) and (5.1), we find that the
scaling of the scattering amplitude A with respect to s has to fulfil
A(2 n)  s1
2 (5.4)
to not violate unitarity.
The above considerations are model-independent1, hence allowing us to compute easily whether
a scattering process violates unitarity. Consider now the Lagrangian of a non-linear  model
(NLM), which in terms of the CallanColemanWessZumino (CCWZ) [207, 208] formalism is
given by
LNLM =
, (5.5)
with v = 246 GeV the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking and
U = e

with massless Goldstone bosons ~ of the (Higgs-less) theory. Via the equivalence theorem [209
214], these can be identified as the longitudinal vector bosons in the high energy limit. With nave
1It is worth noting that equation (5.4) is in fact true for the SM, if it contains a Higgs boson, however not generic
for other models.
Chapter 5. Precision Tests of Higgs Properties via VBF at Future Colliders
power counting, the growth of scattering amplitudes in the NLM can be estimated to be linear
in s,
ANLM(2 n) 
. (5.7)
As a result, any cross section in the NLM can grow arbitrarily large and eventually will violate
unitarity. The scaling of cross sections with the energy s thereby occurs much faster, the more
particles n are produced, as can be seen from equation (5.4). While a 2  2 scattering requires
a constant scattering amplitude, it grows as 1
for a 2  4 scattering. Since the NLM always
grows as s, the cross sections will scale faster with s the more particles are produced. This rapid
grow in cross section can be utilised to study the beginning of new physics with respect to the
energy scale and is explained in detail below.
To recover unitarity, the NLM must be completed in the ultraviolet (UV) region. In the
simplest case, this can be achieved by the addition of a scalar field to the model. If this scalar
then is identified as the Higgs boson with SM couplings, the newly arising Feynman diagrams
cause large cancellations between amplitudes and therefore fully restore unitarity. In case the
scalar does not exhibit exactly SM-like couplings, e.g. when it arises in a theory as a composite
particle of a strongly coupled sector, the cancellations between amplitudes are not complete and
unitarity is only partially restored. The NLM together with such a Higgs boson can be described
by an EFT, where we expand around the Higgs field. The respective Lagrangian then reads [215]
Leff =
1 + 2a
+   
(h)2 
2  d3vh3  d4
h4 +    , (5.8)
where a, b, b3, d3 and d4 are dimensionless parameters changing the overall coupling strength of
a certain term. From this Lagrangian, the UV-complete SM can be restored by setting a = b =
d3 = d4 = 1 and b3 = 0 as well as redefining the Higgs field. For other values of the a, b and d
parameters, the aforementioned cancellations cannot entirely be accounted for by the Higgs field
and unitarity will be violated again. Since this violation of unitarity is linked to some energy
scale , we can infer that our EFT approach is valid only up to this scale   or in other words,
the EFT is valid up to the beginning of unitarity violation. This can be used as an indication for
5.3. Results
the presence of new physics, since at or close to , the effects of the true theory (which the EFT
approximates in the low energy limit) start to become visible, e.g. in form of some resonance
unitarising the scattering amplitudes.
Before performing collider phenomenology with the above introduced model to explore the
beginning of new physics, one needs to be aware that the Lagrangian (5.8) contains only longit-
udinally polarised gauge bosons. These are experimentally hard to separate from the transversely
polarised gauge bosons and thus it is important to understand how the large longitudinal contri-
butions can influence the full, unpolarised cross section of real vector boson scattering. This has
previously been studied in Ref. [203] for a variety of final states containing Higgs and gauge bosons
and we will revisit and extend their research also for possible future 100 TeV colliders in the fol-
lowing section. To achieve comparability and for reasons of simplicity, we choose b = d3 = d4 = 1
and b3 = 0, but leave a as a free parameter. This corresponds to the SM with a modified coupling
between one Higgs and two gauge bosons.
5.3 Results
5.3.1 Cross Sections for Multiple Higgs and Vector Boson Production with
Two Jets
With several final states consisting of Higgs and gauge bosons benefitting from anomalous Higgs
couplings, it is important to study which one benefits most of it and therefore limit the later LHC
phenomenology to the dominant final state. In particular, we study the process pp jj+X with
X being W+W, W+Wh, hh or hhh. We compute the cross sections for the SM case (a = 1)
as well as a non-SM case with a = 0.9. Furthermore, we compute these cross sections with and
without applied vector boson fusion (VBF) cuts, which are designed to increase the gauge or Higgs
boson signal and are defined in table 5.1 below. In particular, we expect the vector bosons to be
radiated off by high energetic quarks (one from each proton). Due to the high energy of the quarks
(reflected in Ej), they will be nearly unscattered and continue their way back to back (reflected
in large ) and close to the particle beam. From the technical side, we compute any cross
sections using Madgraph5 aMCNLO 2.2.3 [109] together with the parton density function (PDF)

Table 5.2: Cross sections in pb for different Higgs and vector boson final states with variable a,
s and VBF cuts.
As expected, all cross sections grow with the collision energy
s, independently of a or VBF
cuts. In case of SM-like couplings (a = 1), an increase in cross section of two to three orders of
magnitude is visible when going from 13 to 100 TeV. The same is true with applied VBF cuts,
although their impact can be quite different for different final states. As such, the cross sections
for processes involving W pairs decrease by two to three orders of magnitude when VBF cuts
are applied, whereas final states containing only Higgs bosons only decrease by a factor of about
30 (3) for 13 (100) TeV. This can be explained by the fact that the pure Higgs final states are
produced dominantly via VBF, whereas final states involving W bosons can be produced by a
larger variety of processes, e.g. via Higgs radiation from charm quark jets.
When leaving the SM and considering the case of a = 0.9, we note that triple Higgs production
5.3. Results
clearly benefits most from this change. This is on the one hand due to the tri-Higgs signature
being created dominantly via VBF and hence the VBF cuts do not remove much of the signature
(VBF cuts decrease the a = 0.9 cross sections by factors of 12, 1.8 and 1.1 for 13, 33 and 100 TeV
respectively), and on the other hand due to the impressive gain in cross section when increasing
s. While at 13 TeV, the change from a = 1 to a = 0.9 results in a cross section after VBF
cuts about 400 times larger, the cross section at 100 TeV increased by almost a factor of 104.
This is quite remarkable and it is worth noting that none of the other processes exhibits a similar
effect. In fact, all other processes gain or lose only negligible contributions as compared to their
SM cross sections. The reason for triple Higgs production standing out is the low transversal
pollution of the signal, whereas for the other final states, transversal contributions to the cross
section dominate over the longitudinal contributions [203]. E.g. for W+W production, there
are only a few Feynman diagrams involving a coupling of two W bosons to a longitudinal W
boson and therefore the cross section stays nearly constant when moving from a = 1 to a = 0.9.
In summary, triple Higgs production benefits by far the most from an anomalous Higgs coupling
a and therefore offers great potential to further explore the characteristics of the Higgs boson such
as its couplings to other gauge bosons (or itself) using an EFT framework. The large increase in
cross section for non-SM-like couplings a could result in unitarity violations, which could be used
as an indication for the beginning of new physics near the cut-off scale  of the considered EFT
(see section 5.2).
While triple Higgs production seems to be the channel to consider for further studying the
Higgs properties, it should not be forgotten, however, that the cross sections for triple Higgs
production are very small as compared to the other final states and reach only a few fb, even at
large collision energies. Therefore, it is of high importance to investigate the possible background
for triple Higgs production and estimate the respective signal-to-background ratio. Before doing so
in section 5.4, we first examine the impact and influence of different anomalous Higgs couplings a
and collision energies
s on the unitarity bounds for triple Higgs production alone in the following
sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3.

5.3.2 Unitarity Violation for Triple Higgs Production with Anomalous Higgs
Couplings
The final state with two jets and three Higgs bosons is mainly produced by VBF as shown in the
schematic diagram in figure 5.1. While this is the final state produced at colliders, it is nevertheless
worth to also study only the VBF part of this process, i.e. V V  hhh with V = Z,W. Here,
Figure 5.1: Schematic diagram for triple Higgs production with two jets via proton-proton scat-
tering. The grey blob in the centre represents the vector boson fusion of two vector-bosons

vector boson interactions.
the invariant mass of the three Higgs bosons, Mhhh, equals the VBF (denoted by a hat) center-
of-mass (CM) energy
sVBF,
Mhhh =
sVBF , (5.9)
which poses a powerful identity for two reasons. First, it allows us to compute the unitarity bound
at VBF level with high accuracy by plugging in the cross section (V V  hhh) into equation (5.1)
and rearranging for
sVBF, which is the minimum collision energy for which unitarity is violated.
Second, equation (5.9) connects the V V and qq scatterings. Since the computed Mhhh at hadron
level will not be a narrow peak, but a distribution easily ranging over several TeV, it is likely that
parts of this distribution exceed the bound for unitarity violation. This happening is equivalent
to the presence of new physics, in this case some resonance unitarising the scattering amplitudes.
Before performing this analysis at qq level, let us come back to V V level to first determine the
lower limit of unitarity violation in terms of
sVBF as a function of a. To do so, we computed
the cross sections for V V  hhh for various a using CalcHEP 3.6.23 [168]. Together with the

Solid coloured lines correspond to values of a > 1, whereas the coloured dashed lines correspond
to a < 1. The SM case, a = 1 is shown as a black dotted line and the region of unitarity violation
appears as a grey shape in the top right corner. For a non-SM coupling a just 1 % different
to its SM value (a = 0.99 and a = 1.01), unitarity violation starts at about
sVBF = 8.4 TeV.
When increasing the difference in coupling to 20 % (a = 0.8 and a = 1.2), unitarity violation starts
earlier at about
sVBF = 3.5 and 2.8 TeV respectively. Lastly, for SM couplings (a = 1), unitarity
is not violated, as the Higgs boson enables an exact cancellation between scattering amplitudes.
This is also reflected in the overall size of cross section, as the SM cross section lies several orders
Chapter 5. Precision Tests of Higgs Properties via VBF at Future Colliders
of magnitude below the cross sections for non-SM-like couplings, as explained earlier.
5.3.3 Triple Higgs Production in the SM with Anomalous Higgs Couplings
After focussing on the VBF part from figure 5.1 in the last section, we will now investigate the
full process including the two hard jets. We first estimate the influence of a and
s on the full
cross section (pp  jjhhh) computed with MadGraph in figure 5.3, before continuing to study
the unitarity violations in this scenario, visible in the Mhhh distributions.

from the left panel. The vertical dotted thick black lines at a = 0.98 and a = 1.02 correspond to
the 100 TeV sensitivity based on figure 5.7.
For the SM case (a = 1), the cross section is extremely small and ranges from 108 pb over
to 106 and 105 pb for
s = 13, 33 and 100 TeV respectively. If a is just slightly different than
1, however, the cross sections grow approximately quadratically in a for |a  1| . 0.1. E.g. for
a = 0.98, the 13 TeV cross section increased by more than one order of magnitude compared to
the SM one, and by more than two and three orders of magnitude for 33 and 100 TeV respectively.
While moving a even further away from the SM, the increase in cross section eventually starts
to peak for a  0.6 before then decreasing again. For large a > 1, the cross sections just keep
growing since they scale with powers of a and the multiplicative nature of a becomes dominant.
However, too large deviations from the SM are already excluded experimentally and we therefore
limit ourselves to changes not bigger than 20 %, i.e. for values of a  [0.8, 1.2].

To better visualise the increase in cross section compared to the SM, we show the ratio

to the grey highlighted segment with a  [0.9, 1.1] from the left panel. The vertical dotted thick
black lines at a = 0.98 and a = 1.02 correspond to the 100 TeV sensitivity based on figure 5.7.
It becomes apparent that the dominant increase in cross section happens for small changes of
a  [0.9, 1.1], as can be seen in detail in the right panel. Regarding the collision energy
s, it
also becomes obvious that larger energies lead to much larger cross sections. For a 1 % change of
the SM coupling, we already see an increase by about 1, 1.5 and 2.5 orders of magnitude for 13,
33 and 100 TeV respectively and especially for 100 TeV, cross sections can grow by one order of
magnitude for couplings deviating from the SM one by less than 0.5 %.
This large gain in cross section does not come without a price, however, and with larger a and
large
s, we also expect large amounts of unitarity violation due to the increasingly worse Higgs
cancellations in VBF processes. This is not necessarily bad, however, as the loss of unitarity is
equivalent to the (slow) breakdown of the underlying EFT and it is now our goal to investigate
this impact of unitarity loss on our signal. Therefore, we remind ourselves of the connection
made in equation (5.9) and that we already know the energies for which unitarity is violated with
respect to a. What remains now is to compute the full hadronic invariant mass of the three Higgs
bosons, Mhhh and apply the unitarity bounds. To do so, we computed the full cross section for
Chapter 5. Precision Tests of Higgs Properties via VBF at Future Colliders
pp jjhhh using MadGraph and subsequently used ROOT 5.34.25 [217] to calculate Mhhh. This
is shown for a = 0.9 and a = 0.99 together with the unitarity violating region in grey in figures 5.5
and 5.6 respectively.

At first glance, the distributions for Mhhh do not depend much on a and peak both at about
1.8 TeV for
s = 13 TeV, 3.5 TeV for
s = 33 TeV and 7 TeV for
s = 100 TeV. A more
obvious difference between = 0.9 and a = 0.99 lies in the number of observable events. The
closer a approaches 1, the less observable events are predicted. Another difference between the
distributions is that they smear out with increasing
s and their tail gets longer and flatter for
very large Mhhh, which indicates the non-unitary behaviour of the scattering amplitudes as Mhhh
increases. Apart from this, values of a closer to 1 result in larger unitarity bounds. For a = 0.9,
the unitarity bound starts at Mhhh  4 TeV, whereas for a = 0.99, it starts at about 8 TeV.
This has severe consequences, as for a = 0.9, even the 13 TeV distribution violates unitarity
by a non-negligible amount and for 33 and 100 TeV, the majority of events lie in the region of
unitarity violation. For a = 0.99, on the other hand, unitarity is restored completely for the
13 TeV distribution, therefore indicating that the EFT is valid in this region. For 33 TeV, the

amount of events falling into the region where unitarity is violated appears large and at 100 TeV,
an even larger fraction of events exhibits unitarity violation.
Apart from comparing different values of a and the corresponding fractions of events in the
unitarity violating regions, it is also worth comparing them to the SM (a = 1). Of particular
interest thereby is the value of a, for which the SM predicts only a single event before unitarity
violation starts. This is shown for
s = 100 TeV and a total integrated luminosity of 30 ab1 in
figure 5.7 below. It turns out that a deviation from the SM coupling by 2 % (corresponding to
a = 0.98 or a = 1.02) leads to a SM prediction of just a single event before unitarity violation
occurs. In case of a = 1.02, a total of about 3000 events is predicted2, indicating that if a is
different from 1 by not less than 2 %, a future collider with a collision energy and luminosity as
stated above should be highly sensitive to this coupling.
To make the predictions of figures 5.5 and 5.6 not only qualitative but also quantitatively
appealing, we count the number of events in the unitarity violating region and all available events
2The case of a = 0.98 behaves nearly identical and is therefore not shown here.

For practical reasons, however, it will be more convenient to use U = 1U rather than U directly,
where U refers to the amount of unitarity restored rather than violated.
In table 5.3, we show U with respect to a and
s for an assumed total integrated luminosity of
Lint = 100 fb1 for all energies. This way, comparing results for different energies and comparing
with other studies is simpler.
For the current LHC with
s = 13 TeV, U stays above 90 % for |a1| < 0.2 and above 99 %
for a change of a not larger than 10 %, indicating that the EFT is almost perfectly valid for this
energy. The small degree of unitarity violation that exists, however, will be nearly impossible to
detect at the current LHC, as for the entire range of a considered here, not a single event within
the region of unitarity violation is expected and altogether, a maximum of only two events in the

Chapter 5. Precision Tests of Higgs Properties via VBF at Future Colliders
rather extreme case of a = 1.2 is expected.
s = 33 TeV, the situation changes as deviations in a from the SM of only 1 % already
lead to 4 % unitarity violation and moving a further away from 1 leads to unitarity violations up
to 80 %. However, the expected number of events is still rather small and exceeds 100 again only
for the extreme case of a = 1.2. An (expected) increase in luminosity by at least a factor of 10
may be helpful here, however if a differs by less than 10 % from the SM coupling, chances are
small to detect such a signal.
s = 100 TeV, lastly, unitarity violations up to 90 % are expected for a 20 % deviation
of a from the SM coupling and a minimum of about 50 % is expected even for deviations of
about 1 %. This is a clear sign that the considered EFT based on the NLM cannot be valid
at collision energies at or beyond 100 TeV, indicating that at such energies new physics should
become visible. Whether this can be observed with the triple Higgs signature depends on the
number of expected (signal) events, which is comparably high3 for 100 TeV. In the extreme case
of a = 1.2, 39000 events are expected in total, of which 2745 events are expected to fall into the
region where unitarity is violated. In more realistic scenarios where a differs from 1 only by a few
%, e.g. for 1 %, still a total of 54 events is expected. Also, a future 100 TeV collider is expected to
gather more than just 100 fb1 of data, but already an increase by one order of magnitude may
be enough to be sensible to such a signature, provided the expected background is small enough.
Estimating this background for the triple Higgs signature at a 100 TeV collider is subject of the
next section 5.4.
5.4 Background Estimation
The main signature we found to benefit from anomalous Higgs couplings between a Higgs and two
gauge bosons is triple Higgs production via vector boson fusion at
s = 100 TeV. The expected
background therefore consists of two high-energetic back-to-back jets with a large rapidity gap
and the decay products of the three Higgs bosons, which we assume to decay each as h  bb.
While estimating the background, we also estimate the expected signal cross section. This differs
from the cross sections listed in table 5.3, since colliders will not observe the Higgs bosons, but
3Tagging efficiencies and Higgs branching ratios will be applied in the next section.
5.4. Background Estimation
their decay products, and this only with a certain efficiency. The bb-pairs are expected to lie in a
narrow cone due to the large boost of the Higgs bosons, even for deviations to the SM coupling
as small as 1 % and smallish Mhhh ' 1 TeV, which represents the lower edge of the distributions
in figures 5.5 and 5.6. In particular, the cone size Rsig
is expected to be of the order
Rsig
125 GeV
1000 GeV
' 0.2 . (5.11)
To find the efficiency of identifying the three Higgs jets, we make use of the work done in Ref. [218].
Therein, the authors computed the efficiency of identifying two boosted Higgs bosons coming
from Kaluza-Klein graviton decays including b-tagging efficiencies to be hh ' 15 %, if the Higgs
momentum is large enough. This efficiency can be related to our work and we estimate
hhh = (
3 ' 0.058 . (5.12)
Furthermore, the branching ratio BR
h bb
' 0.58 also has to be taken into account when
estimating the proper signal cross section.
Putting all of the above together, we can estimate the signal cross section sig(pp  jjhhh)
as a function of a to
sig(pp jjhhh) (a) = (pp jjhhh) (a) hhh  BR
h bb
' (pp jjhhh) (a) 0.0113 . (5.13)
Regarding the background, we assume the major part to come from QCD mediated 6 b quark
final states due to the large BR
h bb
' 0.58 dominating over the other Higgs decay channels.
For this reason, we assume other processes (containing e.g. bb bb  in the final state) to provide
only negligible contributions to the background. Hence, the particular process we study here
is pp  jj bb bb bb, however computing this process with eight particles in the final state is a
challenging task and actually technically unfeasible at this time, especially if additional cuts on
the phase space will be applied. Thus, neither MadGraph nor CalcHEP or other tools such as
Chapter 5. Precision Tests of Higgs Properties via VBF at Future Colliders
ALPGEN [219221] were able to compute the respective cross section or simulate events. For this
reason, we relax our assumptions regarding the background and only estimate an upper bound
on its cross section, which will be conservative. In particular, we leave the two back-to-back jets
aside and instead focus solely on the 6b final state, which to compute is still a highly challenging
task, as again none of the above tools is able to compute the cross sections when certain cuts are
applied. However, it is possible to compute the cross section and generate events for pp  bb bb
with certain cuts, and we will be able to use this cross section to estimate the cross section
including three bb-pairs in the final state. Before doing so, let us focus on the computation of the
4b final state.
To reduce any background coming from combinatorial miscalculations, we apply a mass win-
dow cut M ibb Mh  iMh  cutMh = 15 GeV (5.14)
for i = 1, 2, 3, where M ibb represents the two bb or bb combinations with the lowest 
cutMh is chosen to be consistent with the jet energy resolution of less than 10 % as achieved by
both ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the LHC. This resolution is expected to be roughly at
the same order at future 100 TeV colliders. Besides this mass window cut, we apply the b-jet
acceptance cuts
pbT  50 GeV and |b|  2 , (5.15)
as well as a cut on the invariant mass of all bb-pairs, M4b. This cut is intended to further reduce
the background and is set to
M4b  1 TeV , (5.16)
due to the steep drop of background4 with increasing M4b ( see also the left panel of figure 5.8
below). The last cut we apply takes into account the boosted nature of the Higgs bosons and sets
an upper bound on the b quark separation Rbb with
Rbb =
bb + bb  R
= 0.5 , (5.17)

shown in figures 5.5 and 5.6.

where, again, the signal remains unaffected by this cut due to Rsig
being smaller (see equa-

Figure 5.8: The M4b (left) and Rbb (right) distributions for pp bb bb. The distributions were
generated with the cuts from equations (5.14) to (5.15) applied at parton level.
Finally, the cross section for pp bb bb as well as a set of 100k events can be computed using
CalcHEP while taking into account the cuts defined in equations (5.15) to (5.17) and reads
(pp bb bb) = 19.0 fb . (5.18)
The next step now is to use this result to estimate the background cross section for pp 
bb bb bb. To do so, we shower the 100k events for pp  bb bb using PYTHIA 8.2.30 [140] several
times and compute the probability of an additional bb-pair (with properties as defined by the
cuts (5.15)  (5.17) and the QCD scale set to M4b) being produced via initial (ISR) and final state
radiation (FSR). We validated this approach by simulating the bb bb (4b) background as given by
equation (5.18) based on a bb (2b) starting set of events and estimated it to be accurate up to 20
 30 %. This is sufficient to estimate the full 6b background up to about an order of magnitude.
In particular, we showered a total of 500k events and estimated the probability bb with an
uncertainty at percentage level for different values of Rcut
, shown below in table 5.4. It becomes
apparent that the background can be further reduced by reducing Rcut

For completeness and convenience, the signal cross section from equation (5.13) is printed here
again
sig(pp jjhhh) (a) ' (pp jjhhh) (a) 0.0113 .
Before actually comparing signal and background, we can make use of equation (16) of
Ref. [203] to give predictions also for sub-% deviations from the SM coupling of a Higgs to
two gauge bosons. Equation(16) of Ref. [203] states that the signal cross section scales quite well
as (1  a)2  2a for |a|  1 and (pp  jjhhh) (a)  SM(pp  jjhhh) (a = 1). Using this
scaling on the signal cross sections from equation (5.13) with (pp  jjhhh) (a) from table 5.3,
we can extend the range of a down to about one permille.
In the left panel of figure 5.9, we finally compare the signal as a function of a and the
background for a  [0.01, 0.01], which corresponds to a maximum deviation from the SM
coupling of 1 %. The right panel holds information on the sensitivity of a 100 TeV FCC to a.

fb1, 1 ab1, 10 ab1 and 30 ab1 of total integrated luminosity.
It turns out that the signal clearly dominates over the background if |a| is larger than about
0.5 % and becomes comparable to the background only for very small |a| in the low permille
range or below. It is worth mentioning at this place once more that the background rate we
computed is conservative and acts as an upper bound, since the two omitted back-to-back VBF
jets would further decrease the background by about two orders of magnitude. Therefore, it is
safe to argue that the background is negligible once |a| & 103 and whether such small couplings
will be probable is only a question of luminosity. Exemplarily, we show the sensitivity of a 100
TeV FCC to the triple Higgs signal as a function of a for the total integrated luminosities 100
fb1, 1 ab1, 10 ab1 and 30 ab1 in the right panel of figure 5.9 as red, blue, black and grey
lines respectively. Using two standard deviations as a criterion (dashed horizontal black line
at 2, discovery limit at 5 shown as horizontal black line at 5), the 100 TeV FCC can probe
|a| ' 2.5  102, |a| ' 7.5  103, |a| ' 2.5  103 and |a| ' 1.3  103 for 100 fb1, 1 ab1, 10
ab1 and 30 ab1 respectively. In summary, triple Higgs production via VBF therefore qualifies
as an excellent signature to study the Higgs to two vector boson coupling with permille accuracy
at a 100 TeV FCC. We find this accuracy especially remarkable, since the sensitivity of the LHC
Chapter 5. Precision Tests of Higgs Properties via VBF at Future Colliders
to this coupling is about two orders of magnitude smaller.
5.5 Conclusions
In this chapter, we explored the potential of current and future hadron colliders to narrow down
the properties of the Higgs-like scalar discovered in 2012. In particular, we investigated the
coupling of one Higgs boson h to two gauge bosons V in a non-linear  model combined with
a Higgs boson, around which we performed a field expansion within the framework of an EFT.
With this approach, the aforementioned coupling of a Higgs to two gauge bosons is extended by
a multiplicative factor a and a = 1 restores the SM.
As was shown in the past, values of a other than 1 lead to a large increase in cross section of
vector boson scattering, since the Higgs boson cannot fully account for the required cancellations in
the longitudinal scattering. An important role among the possible vector boson scatterings plays
triple Higgs production, which receives extraordinarily large contributions due to the absence
of transversely polarised vector bosons in the final state. However, even though triple Higgs
production benefits the most from anomalous Higgs couplings a 6= 1, the cross sections at a
collision energy of
s = 13 TeV are in the sub-fb region and lead to a nearly undetectable signal.
The situation is similar when increasing the collision energy to 33 TeV, but changes once 100 TeV
are considered, as is planned for future pp colliders. In particular, we found that with a 100 TeV
FCC, the Higgs to two gauge boson coupling can be probed effectively via triple Higgs production
from vector boson fusion up to permille accuracy.
We therefore evaluated the cross sections for pp jjhhh as a function of a with and without
VBF cuts and estimated the expected background for triple Higgs production, consisting of 6
b jets. The latter turns out to be smaller than the signal if a differs not less than about one
permille from its SM value a = 1. Furthermore, we found that a future 100 TeV FCC is sensitive
enough to probe such couplings with high precision in the permille range of deviations from a to
1 (summarised in figure 5.9). This high accuracy together with the fact that the LHC with its
currently operated 13 TeV collision energy is about two orders of magnitude less sensitive and
therefore unable to probe such anomalous Higgs couplings, highlights the importance of future
colliders with large collision energies.
6 | Conclusions
While the SM is astonishingly well tested and so far seems to be completed with the Higgs boson,
the strong demand for BSM physics remains unbroken for several good reasons. On the one
hand, the list of issues the SM cannot explain is long and undoubtedly requires BSM physics. On
the other hand  and despite the fact that the Higgs boson discovered in 2012 so far matches
the SM Higgs  some of its properties are still widely unconstrained and leave reasonable room
for accommodating it in theories other than the SM. In this thesis, we addressed both of these
reasons by exploring a broad range of phenomenological aspects of several BSM theories. Due to
the vast amount of existing BSM theories, we focus mainly on those predicting signatures that
may be observed in the near future by the LHC. In particular, we considered two supersymmetric
theories (arising after symmetry breaking of a respective GUT scale model), an effective theory
with particle content e.g. as in CH models, and eventually an EFT in combination with a respective
simplified model.
Starting with a supersymmetric model in Chapter 2, we explored the potential of a Pati-Salam
GUT scale model with distinctive A4  Z5 family symmetry to account for a, DM as well as
further experimental constraints. After breaking the Pati-Salam symmetry, the model reduces to
the MSSM with novel constraints on the scalar masses. In particular, the model predicts four
scalar soft masses at the GUT scale, namely m0 (a universal left-handed scalar mass) and mi for
i = 1, 2, 3 (a universal right-handed scalar mass for each family i) together with non-universal
gaugino and trilinear soft masses. With such soft masses, it is possible to have light smuons in
order to successfully explain a, but also heavy stops, which ensure that the Higgs mass will
be large enough. We found two sets of solutions providing the desired a and a viable DM
candidate. These two sets are characterised by large  in the TeV range as well as small  . 400
Chapter 6. Conclusions
GeV respectively. While for both scenarios, the DM candidate is a bino-like neutralino 01, the
relic density constraint is satisfied for large  via co-annihilation with the NLSPs and for small 
via resonant annihilation, if m01 
2 , or co-annihilation with higgsino states for larger
m01
. The model further predicts gluinos with a mass above 2 TeV, which results in heavy squarks
that satisfy current LHC searches. More relevant signatures could arise from the decays of light
smuons with masses around 100  300 GeV. We performed a CheckMATE analysis on the 8 TeV
ATLAS and CMS searches looking for di- and tri-lepton signatures, but found them unable to
probe such signals. However, the (at that time unavailable) 13 TeV LHC searches might effectively
constrain the model parameter space, especially for very light mass spectra as they arise in case
of small .
In Chapter 3, we picked up this idea and investigated the capabilities of a GUT scale SU(5)A4
(also breaking down to the MSSM, but with different GUT scale conditions) to explain a, DM
and further experimental constraints. This time, however, we mainly aimed at solutions with
lighter mass spectra in order to reach further into the regions where the 8 and 13 TeV LHC
searches are sensitive. The soft GUT scale masses we obtain after breaking the SU(5)A4 differ
from the ones in Chapter 2 and, as a main difference, do not unify the left and right-handed
sectors separately any longer. With these conditions, we were able to show that the desired a
in harmony with DM and other constraints can only be achieved, if the gaugino masses are non-
universal and  ' 300 GeV. Additionally, a right-handed smuon with a mass around 100 GeV
just slightly heavier than the DM candidate (which again is a bino-like LSP 01) is required to
satisfy current LHC searches and to provide the correct relic density via R-01 co-annihilation.
Due to the small , DM DD experiments also set strong constraints on the model parameter space.
The key finding of this chapter, however, is the requirement for gaugino mass non-universality,
if a is to be explained simultaneously with DM and current LHC data. After showing that
universal and partially non-universal gaugino masses are excluded by LHC gluino and gaugino
searches, we performed dedicated benchmark analyses for the case of fully non-universal gaugino
masses, i.e. M1 < M2  M3. This case is still allowed if M1 ' 250 GeV < M2  M3 and leads
to higgsino-like 02 and 
1 due to the inevitable model prediction of  ' 300 GeV. Together
with the almost mass-degenerate LSP and right-handed smuon, the LHC may be able to explore
this parameter space entirely via di- and tri-lepton signatures, once its luminosity reaches about
3 ab1. Lastly, we found that DM DD experiments may also explore the entire model parameter
space independent of the LHC searches, once their sensitivity is increased by a factor of about
two, which is expected to take place in the next few years.
As an alternative to SUSY, we studied the BSM phenomenology of a simplified model with a
heavy resonance Z , top partners T  and DM  in Chapter 4. Such a particle content is typical e.g.
for CH models, where the Higgs boson arises as the bound state of some new strong dynamics.
The most interesting process of our proposed model is T T -pair production via Z -mediation
with the top partners further decaying as T   t, resulting in the final state signature tt+ /ET .
After determining the LHC constraints on this model for QCD-induced T sT s-pair production as
well as di-jet and di-lepton searches, we found that the presence of the Z  can greatly improve
the tt + /ET signature without conflicting with existing Z  bounds and may even provide the
dominant contribution to it. Additionally, we found that the tt+ /ET signature covers parts of the
model parameter space widely unconstrained by non-collider searches, therefore making it a highly
valuable addition to constrain models involving Z  bosons, top partners and DM. Furthermore,
the presence of the Z  allows to probe the masses of the Z  boson, the top partner T s and DM with
the tt + /ET signature well beyond the limits coming from QCD-mediated T T -pair production
alone, which by itself already seems quite remarkable. Lastly, the model parameter space can be
further explored by considering off-shell top quark decays, i.e. when MT m < mt. In this case,
the underlying kinematics are completely different, but nevertheless can in principle be studied
with similar methods as in the SUSY scenario with degenerate stops and neutralinos.
Finally, in Chapter 5 we addressed the potential of current and future hadron colliders to
determine the nature of the Higgs boson by investigating its coupling to two gauge bosons (labelled
hV V ) via a non-linear  model. The Higgs field is added to the NLM as a field expansion in an
EFT and results in an extension of the hV V coupling in form of a multiplicative factor a, hence
restoring the SM coupling for a = 1. If a 6= 1, we confirmed that such anomalous Higgs couplings
greatly increase the cross sections of vector boson scattering due to the lack of cancellation between
scattering amplitudes of longitudinal vector bosons. Eventually, if either a or
s becomes large
enough, the cross sections start exceeding the unitarity bound, indicating that the EFT reached its
Chapter 6. Conclusions
limit of validity and the high energy theory, which can be any new physics, has to be considered.
A secondary aim of this chapter therefore was to identify when and to what degree unitarity
will be violated in dependence of the anomalous Higgs coupling a and the collider energy
For both this and the question whether the hV V coupling is SM-like or not, we investigated the
process pp  jj hhh (triple Higgs production via vector boson fusion), which stands out with
an especially large growth in cross section due to the complete absence of transversely polarised
gauge bosons in the final state. We found that while the LHC with
s = 13 TeV is not sensitive
to such a signal, a 100 TeV FCC on the other hand can be sensitive to anomalous Higgs couplings
differing only by a few permille from the SM coupling. To reinforce this argument, we estimated
the respective background for a triple Higgs signal (6 b jets) and found that it becomes comparable
to the signal only when a differs not more than a few permille from its SM value a = 1. Lastly,
we found that already 1 ab1 of total integrated luminosity is sufficient to probe anomalous Higgs
couplings with a permille accuracy, which highlights the importance of developing and upgrading
experimental setups in the search for new physics.
Overall, in this thesis we studied the phenomenology of several BSM theories at the LHC.
We found that supersymmetric as well as Composite Higgs or Technicolor theories provide viable
explanations for several issues of the SM, such as dark matter or (g2), and lead to new physics
predictions that may be probed experimentally in the near future. Due to the vastly different
origins of the Higgs boson in these BSM theories, we further explored the capability of the LHC
and future colliders to determine its nature by precisely measuring its couplings to gauge bosons
and hence provide another option to shed light on new physics. We found that future colliders
have great potential to address this question with an accuracy to a change in couplings in the
permille range. Hence, in the (hopefully very unlikely) case that no sign of new physics will be
found in the current era of the LHC, its successors will clearly have the potential to change this.
Appendix
A Details about the Hierarchy Problem in the SM
In this appendix, we exemplarily show the hierarchy problem in the SM based on the Higgs-loop
Higgs self energy, as depicted in figure A.1 below. Before computing the contribution of this

spontaneous symmetry breaking. Minimising V yields the vacuum expectation value (vev)

 v (A.2)
A. Details about the Hierarchy Problem in the SM
with v  246 GeV. Since v is related to all masses in the SM, one could say it sets the general mass
scale of the theory. For example, the Higgs and electron mass read mh = v
2 and me = gf
with gf being the coupling of a Higgs to a fermion anti-fermion pair ff . So far, all considerations
took place at tree level and loop-induced contributions were neglected. If taken into account, the
picture changes drastically. Consider now the one-loop self-energy of the Higgs boson shown in
figure A.1, which is proportional to
  d4k
k2 m2h
(A.3)
with k being the internal loop momentum and  being some cut-off scale up to which the SM is
valid1, e.g. the Planck scale MP . This integral diverges quadratically in k and yields a positive
correction to 2 proportional to [222]
2  . (A.4)
With this correction, the physical mass now reads
2phys  
2  2 (A.5)
instead of just the bare mass 2.
Reminimising the Higgs potential V with phys then leads to equation (A.2) with phys instead
of just , connecting phys and  as follows
phys 
  123 GeV . (A.6)
This implies phys  O (100) GeV in order for a perturbative treatment of the Higgs boson to be
possible. However, since   MP  1019 GeV, equation (A.5) implies phys to be of order 1019
GeV. Now the only way to retain a  small enough for perturbation theory to still work is to
either have 2 M2P , or to have some new physics arising at a scale much lower than the Planck
scale and not much larger than v, i.e. at the order of a few TeV. While the first solution is usually
disfavoured for its large amount of fine tuning necessary, the second solution offers a more general
(and maybe more natural) perspective to solve the hierarchy problem.
1Since the SM is renormalisable,  could go all the way up to infinity, implying that the SM remains valid for
all energy scales. This, however, is a highly uncommon belief among physicists.
B. The Groups A4 and Z5
B The Groups A4 and Z5
B.1 The Alternating Group A4
The group A4 represents the alternating group on four letters (or of degree 4), which corresponds
to the orientation-preserving rotations of a tetrahedron. These rotations comprise angles of 2 and
3 , and a total of two generators is sufficient to generate the group. The two generators, commonly
denoted as S (for the 2 rotations) and T (for the
3 rotations) can be written explicitely in block-
diagonal form as

1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1

, T =

1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0

. (B.1)
The generators satisfy S2 = T 3 = 1 as well as (ST )3 = 1 and result in a total of 12 group
elements. Due to the block-diagonal structure of S and T , an irreducible representation of A4
consists of a singlet and a triplet, 4  1  3. This can also be understood geometrically, when
rotating the tetrahedron around a fixed vertex. The fixed vertex then represents the singlet,
while the remaining three vertices correspond to the triplet. Lastly, due to T 3 = 1, there are two
more singlets denoted as 1 and 1, which do not have a geometric interpretation in terms of a
tetrahedron.
B.2 The Cyclic Group Z5
Cyclic groups are generated by a single element g. All other elements of the group can be obtained
by repeatedly applying the group operation or its inverse to g. Exemplarily, the roots of unity
zn = 1 , (B.2)
with z  C and n  N form the cyclic group Zn under multiplication and a specific representation
of the generating group element is e.g.
g = e
n . (B.3)
C. ZP-TP-DM Benchmark Cutflows
In this manner, the group Z5 therefore contains the five elements (sometimes also referred to as
charges) 1 = 0,  = 1, 2, 3, 4, given by
k = e
5 . (B.4)
with k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

Table A2: QCD benchmarks (see figure 4.3, centre and right) together with the CheckMATE cutflow
efficiencies (fraction of events surviving a certain cut, normalised to 1). The couplings for all points
read Zqq = Z`+` = 0.25, ZT sT s = 2.5, H = 0 and T st = 0.1. The cutflow corresponds to
the SR tN high from ATLAS CONF 2016 050, which yields the best limits.
D Derivation of the Unitarity Bound
The below derivation of the unitarity bound closely follows the reasoning in Ref. [204]. The
unitarity bound is a consequence of the unitarity condition of the S matrix, SS = 1. Expressing
S = 1 + iT leads to T T = 2 ImT . When taking the matrix element of both sides between
identical two-body states and inserting a complete set of intermediate states into the left-hand
D. Derivation of the Unitarity Bound
side, one gets
dPS2 |Tel(2 2)|2 +
dPSn |Tinel(2 n)|2 = 2 ImTel(2 2) (D.1)
with the n-body phase space dPSn and the sum runs over all inelastic intermediate states with
n  2. Now define the 2 2 elastic scattering amplitude via the partial wave expansion as
Tel (2 2) = 16
(2j + 1)Pj (cos ) aelj (D.2)
aelj =
d cos  Pj (cos ) Tel (2 2) , (D.3)
where Pj(x) are the Legendre polynomials,  is the scattering angle and the incoming and outgoing
particles are assumed to have the same helicities. With equations (D.2) and (D.3), one can
compute 
dPS2 |Tel (2 2)|2 = 32
(2j + 1) |aelj |
2 (D.4)
and further rephrase equation (D.1) to
(2j + 1)
Re aelj
Im aelj 
dPSn |Tinel(2 n)|2  0 . (D.5)
Since the right-hand side of equation (D.5) is positive, there exists a consistent solution for each
value of j, (
Re aelj
Im aelj 
, (D.6)
leading to
Re aelj   12 , (D.7)aelj   1 . (D.8)
Lastly, by assuming s-wave dominance (i.e. the j = 0 contribution to be dominant in the elastic
channel), an upper bound for the inelastic cross section inel (2 n) can be derived using equa-

tion (D.5),
inel (2 n) 
, (D.9)
which is the desired unitarity bound.
