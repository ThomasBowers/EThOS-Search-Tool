Abstract 
The current general economic and food crises have generated an unsettled future 
for food and feed production and prices in general. Increasing demand, prices and 
fluctuations in supply in world markets for fishmeal, fish oil, soybean meal, maize and 
wheat meal emphasize the need to reduce the dependence of the fish feed industry on 
these ingredients by increasing choices among a wider range of raw materials. Legume 
seed such as peas, chickpeas and faba beans are promising ingredients for aquafeeds 
due to their high protein compared to cereals but also for their energy content. The 
objective of the present study was to investigate the use of these legumes in both high 
and low inclusion level in diets for the two main species farmed in the Mediterranean 
countries namely, European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) and gilthead seabream 
(Sparus aurata L.). 
In Chapter 3 the effects of different processing conditions were examined on 
whole seed flours of tested ingredients with respect to both nutritional and 
antinutritional factors and physical characteristics of the experimental diet pellets 
including high and low levels of each legume. Extrusion of raw material resulted in a 
clear reduction in trypsin inhibitors (TI) with chickpeas showing a decrease of up to 
90% and complete inactivation for wheat flour, while for peas and faba beans reduction 
was less than 50% in most cases. Extrusion processing was less effective in the 
reduction of phytic acid and total tannins, occasionally reaching 22% and 18% 
respectively. Oligosaccharides and total NSP were not drastically affected by 
processing, however faba bean NSP showed greater reduction. A redistribution of 
soluble and insoluble NSP fractions was noted for chickpea and pea flours after 
extrusion. Physical characteristics of the pellets were not negatively affected for any of 
the tested diets. 
In Experiment I the effects of total or partial wheat substitution by legumes were 
investigated on nutrient digestibility, gastrointestinal evacuation rate and serum glucose 
response of European seabass. Use of legumes in seabass and seabream diets resulted in 
an overall increase in gastrointestinal evacuation time and a delay in glucose load. 
Specifically, gastric evacuation time was greatly delayed when seabass was fed a diet 
with high levels (30%) of chickpeas, while foregut evacuation time was mostly delayed 
by the diet including a high level (30%) of faba beans. In addition, glucose levels in 
seabass serum were also affected by the type of carbohydrates ingested with wheat 
starch showing more rapid increase and decrease of glucose compared to fish fed pea 
and chickpea diets, while faba bean starch resulted in a lower glucose peak. 
In Experiment II growth, digestibility, hematological parameters, histological 
effects and fillet organoleptic characteristics and the interaction between starch 
inclusion level (8% and 16% or 17% and 35% of legumes respectively) and legume 
type were estimated when tested legumes replaced wheat in European seabass diets. 
Digestibility coefficients were satisfactory for all nutrients (>93%) while legume diets 
at a low level had beneficial effects on growth parameters when compared to the control 
diet, with chickpeas showing a significant improvement in SGR (P<0.05). High level 
legume diets did not result in any negative effect on growth. HSI was increased with 
increasing starch/legume inclusion in the feed and serum glucose also increased for fish 
fed high levels of faba beans and chickpeas. Carcass proximate composition was not 
affected by replacement of wheat in the diets, excluding the increase of fat content in 
fish fed chickpeas. Sensory analysis showed no differences between fish fed the control 
and high legume inclusion diets. 
Lastly in Experiment III growth, hematological parameters, histological effects 
and the interaction between starch inclusion level (low and high) and legume type were 
evaluated when tested legumes were included in gilthead seabream diets. Decreased, 
but not significantly so, growth was observed for all diets including legumes compared 
to the control. Poorer SGR were observed for pea and faba bean diets when these 
legumes were included at high levels. Liver glycogen increased with increasing starch 
level, but HSI did not differ significantly for any of the diet treatments. 
Histological examination of hindgut did not show pathological effects, such as 
enteritis, for in either species or for any of the diets. Increased absorptive vacuoles were 
found for control and pea diets (high level) only for seabass. 
The findings of this thesis showed that the two important species cultivated in 
Mediterranean countries responded differently to the same raw materials used at high 
levels in the diets. Overall legumes had a strong effect on gastrointestinal evacuation 
reducing the rate of feed or digesta passage. Peas, chickpeas and faba beans 
successfully replaced wheat in seabass diets resulting in improved growth coefficients. 
However, when the same legumes included in seabream diets growth performance was 
not improved compared to the wheat based diet.

Chapter 1. General Introduction 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Carbohydrates in fish nutrition 
1.1.1 General 
Numerous investigations have detailed the role of carbohydrates in the nutrition of 
farmed fish species (Wilson, 1994; Jauncey, 1998; Dabrowski and Guderley, 2002; 
Hemre et al., 2002; Krogdahl et al., 2005). Carbohydrates are non-essential in fish diet 
as the energy they supply can be replaced by protein or lipids and glucose requirements 
can be met by gluconeogenesis (Hemre et al., 2002) however, carbohydrates and 
especially starches can be generally utilized well (Wilson, 1994) and they can also 
enhance protein sparing effect for growth (Jauncey, 1998). Their digestion and 
utilization is species dependant with carnivorous fish being less able to utilise them than 
omnivorous and herbivorous (Krogdhal et al., 2005). Carbohydrates are intrinsic 
components of feedstuffs, most especially those of plant origin and in that context some 
dietary content is unavoidable. In addition their low cost per kJ and the beneficial effect 
on physical properties of the diets make carbohydrate important constituents of fish 
diets (Jauncey, 1998; Krogdhal et al., 2005). 
1.1.2 Carbohydrate fractions 
Carbohydrates can be classified into a number of categories according to their 
chemical structure and properties and these vary considerably amongst different 
carbohydrate types (Knudsen, 1997). The main carbohydrate classes of interest in 
animal feeds are starch, dietary fibre (DF) and low molecular weight sugars (LMW-
sugars) or oligosaccharides (Knudsen, 2001). 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
Starch consists of two glucose crystalline polymer structures: amylose and 
amylopectin, with amylopectin being dispersed in amylose (Gallant et al., 1992). 
Amylose is a linear molecule in which the glucose units are connected with (14) 
glycosidic bonds and the degree of polymerization ranges between 600-6000 glucose 
units. Amylopectin is a branched helical crystalline molecule in which the glucose units 
are connected with (16) bonds for the branch point and (14) bonds for the linear 
parts, and polymerization for a single molecule may exceed 106 single glucose units 
(Bornet, 1993).  
Starch can also be classified according to the digestive response, as readily 
digestible starch, slowly digestible starch and resistant starch, and resistant starch in 
turn can be divided into physically inaccessible, resistant starch granules and 
retrograded starch (Cairns et al., 1996). Starch digestibility in fish is variable ranging 
from 25% to 95% (Wilson, 1994; Shiau, 1997) depending on the fish species, the 
botanical origin and complexity of the starch, inclusion level in the diet, feeding 
strategy and processing methods such as cooking or extrusion (Wilson, 1994). In 
general processed starch is better digested than raw starch (Peres and Oliva-Teles, 
2002; Venou et al., 2003).  
DF can be categorized as lignin and non starch polysaccharides (NSP) (Knudsen, 
1997) and these are commonly found in plant cell walls (Knudsen, 2001). Lignin basic 
units are phenylopropanes built in a branched network and NSP are divided into water 
soluble NSP (S-NSP) and water insoluble (I-NSP) (Knudsen, 1997; Knudsen, 2001). S-
NSPs include pectins, hydrocolloids and some hemicelluloses, while I-NSP include 
cellulose and some hemicelluloses. The most common single molecules included in 
both NSP fractions to build the polysaccharide polymers are arabinose, xylose 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
(pentoses), mannose, glucose, galactose (hexoses), rhamnose, fucose (6-deoxyhexoses) 
and uronic acids (glucuronic and galacturonic acids) (Knudsen, 1997). 
Animals including fish typically lack the enzymes needed to degrade NSP in the 
digestive tract that can be only fermented by intestinal flora (Dabrowski and Guderley, 
2002). The presence of the S-NSP reduces the evacuation rate and increases the 
evacuation time of the digesta in the intestine (van der Klis and van Voorst, 1993; 
quoted in Choct, 1997), while the insoluble polysaccharides cause the opposite effects 
(Kirwan et al., 1974). Pectins and gums tend to increase the viscosity of the digesta in 
chicken resulting in lower digestibility and absorption (Choct et al., 1995), probably by 
obstructing the ability of enzymes to act in the bulk of digesta. NSP (guar 
galactomannans and alginates) inclusion in salmon (Salmo salar) diets resulted in 
reduced availability of diet nutrients (Storebakken, 1985; Storebakken and Austreng, 
1987). Some NSP bind with bile acids, lipids and cholesterol causing increases in bile 
acid production from the liver with possible effects on the absorption of fats and 
cholesterol from the gut in rats (Levrat et al., 1996; Favier et al., 1997). 
Finally, oligosaccharides are composed of raffinose, verbascose and stachyose as 
basic units. The oligosaccharides are often present in legume seeds causing flatulence 
or diarrhoea in monogastric animals due to a lack of the enzyme -galacosidase which 
is necessary for breaking the sugar bonds (Siddhuraju and Becker, 2001; Vinjamoori et 
al., 2004). Oligosaccharides can be metabolised in the intestine of carp (Cyprinus 
carpio) by microbes, liberating short chain fatty acids, carbon dioxide and methane gas 
(Kihara and Sakata, 2002), a procedure that is known to exist in the hind gut of 
monogastric animals (Smiricky-Tjardes et al., 2003), however, in fish these studies are 
very scarce. Hung et al. (1990) found increased water and osmolality values in the distal 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
intestine of white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) when fed high levels (27%) of 
sucrose, lactose or fructose compared to glucose, dextrin and raw corn starch. 
1.1.3 Carbohydrate metabolism in fish 
The ability of fish to utilize dietary carbohydrate varies among fish species, due to 
anatomical and functional differences of the gastrointestinal tract and the digestive 
associated organs (Krogdahl et al., 2005). In general fresh- and warm-water fish have 
much higher intestinal amylase activity than marine and cold-water fish, and 
herbivorous and omnivorous fish utilize carbohydrates better than carnivorous fish 
species (Dabrowski and Guderley, 2002). 
Teleost fish are considered to have a high glucose tolerance compared to 
mammals, as wide fluctuations of blood glucose levels are normally found (Dabrowski 
and Guderley, 2002), with carnivorous species showing more persistent hyperglycaemia 
(Peres and Oliva-Teles, 2002) than omnivorous fish (Furuichi and Yone, 1981). Fish 
have been characterised as resembling higher animals with insulin dependent diabetes 
mellitus (Kelley, 1993) because they exhibit similar symptoms (Shimeno, 1991), 
however the persistent hyperglycaemia generally coincides with transient 
hyperinsulinemia (Moon, 2001).  
There are digestive enzymes that function to break down nutrients in foods into 
compounds that can be absorbed across the brush border membrane of the enterocyte. 
These enzymes are mainly excreted into the lumen. The location in which these 
enzymes act characterizes this as extracellular digestion, membrane linked digestion or 
intracellular digestion (Rust, 2002). Carbohydrate digestion is an extracellular 
procedure that involves hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates in the stomach, intestine 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
and caecae as well as in the brush-border section of intestines where enzymes such as 
maltase and sucrase are present (Rust, 2002; Harpaz et al., 2005). 
The major enzymes required for carbohydrate digestion are apparently present in 
fish (Rust, 2002) and also the enzymes for the major carbohydrate metabolic pathways, 
such as glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, pentose phosphate shunt, gluconeogenesis 
and glycogen synthesis, have also been demonstrated to be present (Hemre et al., 2002). 
Even though the various enzymes and metabolic pathways for glucose metabolism have 
been detected, the overall role and contribution of dietary carbohydrates to the total 
energy requirements of fish remains unclear (Krogdahl et al., 2005). 
Enzyme distribution and concentration in the gut varies with the different 
intestinal morphologies and feeding habits of fish (Lunstedt et al., 2004). It is reported 
that carnivorous fish are characterized by higher trypsin and chymotrypsin activity 
(Eshel et al., 1993), while herbivorous and omnivorous fish are characterized by higher 
amylase activity (Hofer et al., 1982; Munilla-Moran and Saborido-Rey, 1996; Hidalgo 
et al., 1999). Changes in the type of diet, the source or the quantities of nutrients 
present, may change the enzyme concentrations, which in turn can affect the digestion 
and absorption of nutrients (Deguara et al., 2003). 
Hormones related to glucose metabolism, apart from insulin, such as glucagon, 
glucagon-like peptides, insulin-like growth factors, growth hormone, somatostatins, 
cortisol and catecholamines are also present in fish (Moon, 2001). The hormonal 
control mechanisms of teleosts sometimes resemble those of mammals, such as the 
targets and mechanisms of actions of glucagon, but generally there are many 
differences between them (Hemre et al., 2002). 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
1.1.4 Effects of dietary carbohydrates in fish  
Excessive amounts of carbohydrate in fish diets have been associated with 
increased glycaemia (Wilson, 1994; McGoogan and Reigh, 1996) and feed intake in 
rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) 
(Hilton and Slinger, 1983; Perez et al., 1997). Increased hepatosomatic index (HSI) has 
also been associated with dietary carbohydrates in trout (Kim and Kaushik, 1992) and 
European seabass (Lanari et al., 1999; Perez et al., 1997), but no such effect was found 
for salmon (Arnesen et al., 1995). Excessive glycogen deposition in liver is also related 
to the presence of carbohydrates in diets for both salmon (Arnesen et al., 1995) and 
trout (Kim and Kaushik, 1992), while fat deposition in liver is associated with high 
carbohydrate content in diets for European seabass (Lanari et al., 1999). In addition, 
different morphological changes in liver tissue have been found in European seabass 
fed different starch sources (Russell et al., 2001). 
Excessive fibre in aquaculture diets may also lead to a decrease in feed utilization 
by obstructing the action of digestive enzymes and diluting nutrient density (Booth et 
al., 2001). Non-starch polysaccharides may reduce utilization of other nutrients as they 
can bind water and minerals and absorb compounds such as sterols and acids (Krogdahl 
et al., 2005). There are cases that these properties can be beneficial to the animals, but 
most commonly they have negative impacts on nutrient utilization (Krogdahl et al., 
2005). 
1.2 World and Mediterranean aquaculture 
1.2.1 General 
Aquaculture production has been growing at an average annual rate of 10.5% per 
year worldwide for marine fish species and 8.8% for all aquaculture since 1970, 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
compared with 2.8% for terrestrial livestock and 1.2% for capture fisheries (SOFIA, 
2006). China is the biggest world producer, contributing 69.6% of aquaculture 
production by quantity and 51.2% of world aquaculture value (SOFIA, 2006). 
Aquaculture quantities by category and their respective values for 2004 are shown in

1.2.2 Mediterranean Aquaculture 
In 1985, Mediterranean fish farming was estimated to produce 374t of European 
seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax Linnaeus, 1758) and gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata 
Linnaeus, 1758), where Spain, Greece and France provided the initial impetus for 
production (FAO, 2008a). By 1990, production had increased to 3,876t where Greece, 
Spain and Italy had emerged to dominate with nearly 80% of all production. Five years 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
later production had increased twelve-fold to over 47,000t while, in 2000, combined 
Mediterranean production exceeded 130,000t, and in 2006 it was more than 190,000t 
(FEAP, 2008).  
Currently, the production leaders are Greece with nearly 41% (79,000t) of total 
production, while the other important producing countries are Turkey (28% - 53,000t), 
Spain (15% - 28,000t) and Italy (9.3% - 17,800t). More than 90% of this production 
sector is thus focused on 4 Mediterranean countries (Aquamedia, 2008). 
1.2.3 Seabass 
France and Italy were the pioneers of reliable mass-production techniques for 
juvenile seabass in the late 1960s and by the late 1970s these techniques were dispersed 
and developed in most Mediterranean countries (FAO, 2008a). European seabass was 
one of the first marine non-salmonid species to be commercially cultured in Europe and 
at present is a very important commercial fish widely cultured in Mediterranean areas, 
with the most significant producers being Greece, Turkey, Italy and Spain (FAO, 
2008a) as demonstrated in Figure 1.2.

European seabass belongs to the family Moronidae (Superorder Teleostea, Order 
Perciformes, Class Actinopterigii), it is a euryhaline fish which is found in subtropical 
climates (66-13N) in the eastern Atlantic (from Norway to Morocco, the Canary 
Islands and Senegal) and also in the Mediterranean and Black Seas (Fishbase, 2008a). 
Seabass inhabits the littoral zone on various kinds of bottoms in estuaries, lagoons and 
occasionally rivers, and enters coastal waters and river mouths in summer, but migrates 
offshore in colder weather and occurs in deep water during winter in the northern range 
(Fishbase, 2008a). Seabass is a gonochoristic species with spawning taking place from 
December to March in the Mediterranean Sea and up to June in the Atlantic Ocean 
(Haffray et al., 2006). The eggs and larvae are greatly dispersed in the first 3 months of 
their life and adults migrate over several hundreds of kilometres (Haffray et al., 2006). 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
Seabass are predators and their natural diet consists mainly of shrimps, molluscs 
and fishes (Smith, 1990). Other common species detected in seabass stomachs are 
nekton including zoobenthos (amphipods), benthic copepods, crabs, insects, fish eggs 
and larvae, other planktonic invertebrates, mysids, cladocerans, planktonic crustaceans 
and copepods (Fishbase, 2008b)  
Despite the commercial importance of seabass, there are no official tables for the 
nutritional requirements of this species, but there are numerous studies in this area as 
indicated in Table 1.1. The optimum dietary protein level for juvenile or fingerling 
seabass has been reported by Hidalgo and Alliot (1988) and Peres and Oliva-Teles 
(1999a) to be around 50%. Perez et al. (1997) observed optimum growth with 45% 
protein for fingerlings and Dias et al. (1998) with 43% compared to 52% protein 
inclusion level for 6g seabass.

CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
Data for the quantitative requirements for the indispensable amino acids (IAA) for 
seabass are available from Kaushik (1998) and presented in Table 1.2. These results are 
based on determination of whole body IAA composition as this is considered to be 
representative of the IAA requirement profile (Mambrini and Kaushik, 1995). Results 
from other authors agree with these values concerning arginine (Alexis, 1997), lysine 
(Abd El-Hady and Habiba, 2003), methionine (Thebault et al., 1985) and threonine 
(Tibaldi and Tulli, 1999).

Optimal dietary fat level for European seabass fingerlings was estimated by Alliot 
et al. (1974) to be 12.5%. More recent studies (Peres and Oliva-Teles, 1999b) found no 
differences in growth performance of seabass fed diets ranging from 12 to 24% lipids, 
while with 30% lipids growth was depressed. On the contrary Lanari et al. (1999) 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
obtained better growth performances when the dietary fat was 19% compared to 11 or 
15% in ongrowing seabass diets and similar results were observed by Dias et al. (1998) 
with 18% lipid (compared to 9%) in fingerling diets. 
Starch rich grains are commonly included in feed formulations for substituting 
part of the protein and fat as an energy source and to improve the mechanical properties 
of the pelleted feed (Lanari et al., 1999). Pregelatinised starch is sufficiently digested by 
seabass (Spyridakis et al., 1986; quoted in Lanari et al., 1999) while Perez et al. (1997) 
found no significant differences in growth of seabass fed diets with 16 to 28% 
gelatinised starch, but depression occurred with 33% gelatinised starch. 
Available data on vitamin and mineral requirements of marine species are very 
scarce. For seabass a requirement for vitamin C was demonstrated but not quantified 
(Alexis, 1997; Henrique et al., 1998). Fournier et al. (2000) showed that seabass require 
120mg of ascorbic acid per kg diet for maximum growth to maintain normal skin 
collagen concentration and hepatic ascorbic acid saturation.  
The digestible protein (DP) to digestible energy (DE) ratio of the diets also affects 
growth rate and feed utilization efficiency (Oliva-Teles, 2000). According to Dias et al. 
(1998) optimum protein to energy ratio of diets for seabass should be 19mgkJ-1 in diets 
with at least 20kJ DEg-1. Lupatsch et al. (2001) determined the efficiencies of 
utilization of DE and DP for maintenance and growth in D. labrax, by feeding fish of 
various sizes at increasing feeding levels, from zero to maximum voluntary feed intake. 
The relationship between DE intake and energy gain was found to be linear and was 
independent of feed intake and body weight (BW). The requirement for DE for 
maintenance was calculated to be 43.6kJ BW (kg)-0.79 day-1 and for DP 0.66g BW (kg)-
0.69 day-1. The partial efficiency utilization for growth was 0.68 and 0.52 for DE and DP, 
respectively. 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
1.2.4 Seabream 
Traditionally, seabream was extensively cultured in Italy and Egypt in coastal 
lagoons and salt water ponds taking advantage of the natural migration of juveniles 
from the sea into the coastal lagoons (FAO, 2008a). Intensive rearing systems were 
developed in early 1980s in Italy, and large-scale juvenile production was achieved in 
the late 1980s in Spain, Italy and Greece (FAO, 2008a). This species shows high 
adaptability to intensive culture conditions and nowadays Greece, Turkey, Spain and 
Italy are the main producers as demonstrated in Figure 1.3.

Gilthead seabream, belongs to the family of Sparidae, (Superorder Teleostea, 
Order Perciformes, class Actinopterigii). S. aurata is a euryhaline fish, which is found 
along the eastern Atlantic coasts from Great Britain to Senegal and also in the 
Mediterranean Sea. The species inhabits seagrass beds and sandy bottoms as well as the 
surf zone, commonly to depths of about 30m but adults may occur to 150m depth. Due 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
to its euryhaline and eurythermal habits it is found both in sea and brackish water 
including lagoons and estuaries especially during the early stages of its life cycle (FAO, 
2008a). Gilthead seabream is a protandrous hermaphrodite and the females can lay 
20,000-80,000 eggs per day for a period of up to 4 months (FAO, 2008a). 
Gilthead seabream is mainly a carnivorous fish and accessorily herbivorous 
(Bauchot and Hureau, 1990). The most common feed items reported in seabream 
stomach are phytoplankton, zoobenthos items including amphipods, benthic copepods 
and crustaceans, ostracods, molluscs, annelids, polychaetes, fish eggs and larvae, other 
planktonic invertebrates, cladocerans, planktonic crustaceans and copepods (Fishbase, 
2008b). 
Despite the commercial importance of seabream, there are no official tables for the 
nutritional requirements of this species, but there are a number of studies in this area 
listed in Table 1.3. 
Sabaut and Luquet (1973) estimated the optimum protein requirement for 
maximum growth of juvenile seabream using semi-purified diets to be 40%, but more 
recent research reevaluates this percentage with practical diets to be 45-46% (Vergara et 
al., 1996a; Nengas et al., 1997). Similar results were observed when growing fish were 
fed 47 and 51% protein level when the fat level was also high (21%) (Santinha et al., 
1999).

In table 1.4 the requirements for the IAA for seabream are shown with the values 
representing the whole body IAA of seabream (Kaushik, 1998) as it is considered to be 
representative of the IAA requirements profile (Mambrini and Kaushik, 1995). Similar 
results from other authors were observed for arginine (Tibaldi et al., 1994) and lysine 
(Tibaldi and Lanari, 1991).

CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
Gilthead seabream have been reported to require a minimum of 6.5% cod liver oil 
in the diet in order to maintain best growth and feed utilization (Kalogeropoulos et al., 
1992). According to the same author, seabream juveniles require 0.9% highly 
unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) in the diets and best growth performance was obtained 
with an eicosapentaenoic/docosahexaenoic fatty acid ratio (EPA/DHA) of 2/1 (Ibeas et 
al., 1997). Marais and Kissil (1979) observed best growth with a 9% lipid diet, the 
lowest value tested (9-16%) but according to Vergara et al. (1996b) best growth for 42g 
seabream was observed with a diet including 15-16% fish oil and no improvement in 
growth was found by raising the lipid percentage to 21% (Santinha et al., 1999). 
As mentioned above, fish do not use carbohydrates efficiently. Seabream seems to 
have a ratio of amylolytic to proteolytic enzymes higher than rainbow trout and this 
may influence the carbohydrate digestion capability of these species (Hidalgo et al., 
1999). 
Available data on vitamin and mineral requirements of marine species are very 
scarce. For seabream a requirement for vitamin C was demonstrated but not quantified 
(Alexis, 1997; Henrique et al., 1998) and some limited data for pyridoxine are available 
(Kissil et al., 1981). Preliminary results showed a dietary phosphorus requirement 
around 0.75% of the diet (Oliva-Teles and Pimentel-Rodrigues, 2004). 
1.3 Feed formulation  
1.3.1 General 
Successful fish culture depends on supply of diets containing optimal levels of 
energy and nutrients for growth. Diet preparation is in fact a compromise between the 
ideal situation and practical considerations (Hardy and Barrows, 2002). The main 
objective when formulating a fish diet is to provide a nutritionally balanced mixture of 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
ingredients to support the maintenance, growth, reproduction and health of the animal at 
an affordable cost (NRC, 1993). As feed is one of the principle costs in feed production 
(Lupatsch et al., 2001), formulations must be based on our knowledge of nutritional 
requirements for them to be economically viable.  
In intensive aquaculture, fish feeds are formulated to be dense in nutrients and 
energy, based mostly on ingredients of marine origin, particularly fish meal and fish oil 
(Kaushik, 2000). When the requirements of certain fish species are known, it is not 
difficult to formulate a diet that contains all nutrients at an appropriate level. However, 
there are practical matters to consider that make this task complicated. The most 
important of these are the price and the availability of the ingredients, diet acceptability 
to the farmed fishes, pelletability of the formulation, pellet storage and handling 
requirements (NRC, 1993). What is also crucial with regard to the aquatic environment, 
is that the pellets should remain intact in water until fish consume them, while the 
nutrients should be highly available to the fish (NRC, 1993) to minimize excretions and 
therefore avoid settlement of organic matter on the bottom with possible impacts on the 
sediment under and around sea cages (Mente et al., 2006) 
1.3.2 Commonly used ingredients and the limitations 
The ingredients that are used in fish feed are either by-products of human food 
technology or products produced directly for fish consumption. Ingredients used in 
commercial fish diets can be classified as sources of protein (amino acids), fats (EFA), 
carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals (NRC, 1993). It is also very important to cover 
the energy requirements of fish, although energy is not considered to be a nutrient in an 
independent sense. 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
The main protein source that is used in fish feeds is fishmeal. When prepared from 
good quality, whole fish it is one of the highest-quality protein sources. Depending on 
the fishmeal quality, protein level ranges from 56% to 76%, it is also a rich source of 
energy, EFA and minerals and is highly digestible and palatable to most fishes (NRC, 
1993). Fishmeal availability is limited due to somewhat stable production and increased 
demand (SOFIA, 2006) and thus it is an expensive ingredient (Josupeit, 2008) that 
contributes greatly to the final cost of fish feeds. 
Soybean meal is an available ingredient with high protein content and one of the 
best amino acid profiles among protein-rich plant feedstuffs for meeting most of the 
essential amino acid requirements of fish (Mohsen, 1989; quoted in NRC, 1993). It has 
long been used as a substitute for animal protein in aquaculture feeds. The 
antinutritional factors (ANF) that are present in soybean seeds and the considerable rise 
in soybean price over the last year (Josupeit, 2008) are restricting factors for their use in 
fishfeeds. In addition, the strict rules of EU countries adopted in 2003 relating to the 
release of genetically modified seeds into the environment, their traceability, labelling 
and their use in animal feeds (Euractiv, 2006) also proved to be a limiting factor in their 
use in fishfeeds. 
Many other plant protein sources are used, proteins that are extracted from 
oilseeds such as rapeseed and sunflower, or proteins from cereals like wheat and maize 
gluten (Aslaksen et al., 2007). Their availability is high, but their use is limited either 
due to ANF (Aslaksen et al., 2007) or due to imbalanced amino acid profile; for 
example the lysine deficiency of glutens (Davies et al., 1997; Pereira and Oliva-Teles, 
2003). 
Fats and oils are the main sources of energy but they also provide the EFA, with 
marine fish oils containing 10-25% HUFA (NRC, 1993). Marine oils are obtained from 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
processing of marine animals and are classified as fish oils, fish liver oils and marine 
mammal oils (Hertrampf and Piedad-Pascal, 2000). Their use in fish feeds is restricted 
by the availability, the high prices (SOFIA, 2006) and the possible contaminants present 
like dioxins or dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls that can be transferred to, and 
accumulated in, the edible parts of farmed fish (Bell et al., 2005). Plant oils such as 
soybean, canola (Glencross et al., 2003), linseed (Bell et al, 2004), rapeseed and palm 
oil (Karalazos, 2007) can be used as substitutes for fish oil, although their fatty acid 
compositions differ significantly, with vegetable oils containing lower levels of n-3 
fatty acids (particularly HUFA) than fish oil. The use of vegetable oils in fish diets can 
differentiate the fatty acid composition of the produced fish (Bell et al., 2001; 2003), 
but this effect can be largely overcome after a finishing fish oil diet before harvest (Bell 
et al, 2004).  
Carbohydrate sources such as cereals are present in fish diets as a binder as well as 
an inexpensive energy source (Davis and Arnold, 1995). Cereal whole grains contain 
62-72% starch and this is an important binding agent in steampelleted and extruded 
feeds (NRC, 1993). Many by-products of grain industry as for example wheat, oat, 
corn, rice, milo or rye by-products are valuable ingredients for animal feeds and 
subsequently for fish feeds (Hardy and Barrows, 2002). Legumes such as peas, beans 
and chickpeas contain also considerable amounts of starch that could be utilised by fish 
as energy source (Booth et al., 2001). The use of these plant ingredients could be 
limited when their fibre content is high (Nengas et al., 1995) or when they are not 
processed, as raw starch is considered a poor energy source (Peres and Oliva-Teles, 
2002). However, digestibility of raw starch can be enhanced considerably by 
gelatinization through heat treatment (Peres and Oliva-Teles, 2002) which is a common 
practice in commercial feeds. 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
Other materials that are used in fish feeds in lower quantities are vitamin and 
mineral premixes, feed binders, carotenoid supplements, drugs and antibiotics, 
probiotics, enzyme supplements, antifungal agents, antioxidants, fibre, colourings, 
flavourings and water (Hardy and Barrows, 2002). 
1.3.3 The need to identify new/novel feed ingredients 
The current general economic and food crisis brought about by increasing oil 
prices as well as the expansion of the bio-ethanol and bio-diesel industry have 
generated an unsettled future for food and feed production and prices in general. 
Increasing demand, prices and fluctuations in supply in the world markets for fishmeal, 
fish oil, soybean meal, maize and wheat meal, emphasize the need to reduce their 
incorporation in feeds and at the same time increase the range of raw material sources. 
Fishmeal and fish oil production have been more or less stable over the last few 
decades (SOFIA, 2006), while events such as the El Nin in 1997-1998 have shown 
that fish oil and meal can become unpredictable raw materials for aquaculture 
production in specific years. 
Furthermore, since European production of soybean is extremely limited, due 
mainly to climatic and geographical constraints (P.E.A., CLAIR, Programme, 1993; 
quoted in Gouveia and Davies, 1998), it is considered worth exploring the possibilities 
of using other plant sources which are cultivated in European and Mediterranean 
countries, thus limiting the expense of importation. Peas, chickpeas and faba beans with 
their protein and starch inclusion levels could successfully replace wheat and partially 
replace other plant or animal proteins.  
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
1.4 Legume seeds 
1.4.1 General 
Grain legumes are the harvested seed of leguminous crops, which includes beans 
and peas and other closely related species within the family Fabaceae. Legumes play an 
important role in the traditional diets of many regions around the world because of their 
high nutritional value for humans. They are low in fat content and they are an excellent 
source of protein, dietary fibre and a variety of micronutrients and phytochemicals 
(Messina, 1999). Legumes are also traditional sources of plant proteins for ruminants 
and monogastric animals and can provide a range of benefits both for farms and feed 
manufacturers (FAO, 2002). Soybeans are the most extensively evaluated and most 
commonly used plant protein source in fish diets. The nutritional value of legumes such 
as lupins, field peas (Burel et al., 2000) have been evaluated in rainbow trout and turbot 
(Psetta maxima), faba beans in salmon (Aslaksen et al., 2007), while cow peas, 
chickpeas and vetch (Allan et al., 2000) in silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) as potential 
protein or/and energy sources. Legumes usually contain more lysine than cereals but 
they have lower digestibility of sulphur amino acids (Allan et al., 2000). 
The EU is the major producer of peas (2.8mmt) grown essentially for animal feed, 
while Canada has significantly increased production (2.1mmt) since 2000 (Grain 
legumes, 2007). The major producer of faba bean is China (1.8mmt), but important 
harvests are also produced in Australia, the United Kingdom and France. Chickpeas are 
mainly produced in India (5.3mmt) (Grain Legumes, 2007).  
Field pea is the main cultivated arable protein crop in the EU with spring type, 
white-flowered, low-tannin varieties being the most popular (Grain legumes, 2006). 
Faba beans have been used for decades for human consumption in the south and for 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
cattle or pigeon feed in the northern part of Europe, while currently areas of cultivation 
are expanding ranking this crop as the second most cultivated legume in Europe (Grain 
legumes, 2006). Chickpea is cultivated exclusively in the south of Europe and is mainly 
destined for direct human consumption. The kabuli type (large white seeds) is the 
most popular type for both cultivation and consumption in Europe (Grain legumes, 
2006). The areas cultivated with each legume in E.U. are represented in Figure 1.4.

1.4.2 Field peas in aquaculture feeds 
Field or feed or green pea (Pisum sativum L.) is a legume with potential due to the 
fact that it has been used in livestock feeds for a long time as a source of energy and 
protein, but has only recently been evaluated in feed for aquatic species (Davis et al., 
2002). The average protein content of whole peas is around 21% which is low 
compared to soybean and lupins, but it is high compared to cereals, and it is rich in 
starch (around 45%) and has an energy content of 15.8kJg-1 (Sauvant et al., 2004). Field 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
peas have been evaluated as potential feed ingredients, whole or dehulled, raw or 
processed, for several aquatic species including European seabass (Gouveia and Davies, 
1998; 2000), Australian silver perch (Allan et al., 2000), Atlantic salmon (Carter and 
Hauler, 2000), rainbow trout (Gomes et al., 1995a), turbot (Burel et al., 2000) and blue 
shrimp, Litopenaeus stylirostris (Cruz-Suarez et al., 2001) and other species as 
presented in Table 1.5. 
In general most studies indicate that dehulled peas and extruded pea seed meal 
have higher Apparent Digestibility Coefficients (ADCs) for energy and crude protein 
than whole or raw peas respectively (Booth et al., 2001; Booth et al., 2002; Davis et al., 
2002; Thiessen et al., 2003; Allan and Booth, 2004).

CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
1.4.3 Chickpeas in aquaculture feeds 
Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is grown in tropical sub-tropical and temperate 
regions as an annual plant and it is considered drought tolerant (Bhardwaj et al., 1999). 
Based on seed colour and site of origin, chickpeas are classified into two types, the 
kabuli and the desi type that differ in their nutrient composition, with kabuli types 
having a lower fibre, higher starch and fat content than desi types (Gill et al., 1996). 
The average protein content of the Mediterranean kabuli type seed is 20%, starch 
content 45% and energy 17.5kJg-1 (Sauvant et al., 2004). 
Research on this plant material as an ingredient in aquaculture feeds is very scarce. 
Chickpeas have been evaluated as a potential fish feed ingredient by Allan et al. (2000) 
and Booth et al. (2001) for silver perch (Table 1.6).

1.4.4 Faba beans in aquaculture feeds 
Faba beans (Vicia faba L.) are also known as field beans, broad beans and horse 
beans and the varieties can be divided into summer and winter (Hertrampf and Piedad-
Pascal, 2000) or white and coloured flower varieties with low and high tannin contents 
respectively (Sauvant et al., 2004). The average protein content of faba beans is 26%, 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
the average starch content is 38% and energy content is estimated to 16.2kJg-1. Faba 
bean is a common human food in developing countries and it is also used as animal 
feed, mainly for pigs, horses, poultry and pigeons in industrialized countries. The 
nutritional value of faba beans is high and it is considered in some regions to be a good 
substitute for meat or skimmed milk (Duke, 1981). 
Research on this plant material as an ingredient in aquaculture feeds is scarce. 
Both digestibility and nutritional value of faba bean meal have proved favourable for 
rainbow trout and common carp (Grabner and Hofer, 1985) and they have also been 
tested in more recent studies in silver perch (Allan et al., 2000; Booth et al., 2001), in 
Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (Fontainhas-Fernandes et al., 1999) and in rainbow 
trout diets (Gomes et al., 1995b) as listed in Table 1.7.

CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
1.4.5 Challenges and limitations 
1.4.5.1 Potential of peas, chickpeas and faba beans 
As mentioned before peas, chickpeas and faba beans are all legumes and they are 
good sources of both protein and starch. In this respect these three legumes offer 
flexibility to the feed manufacturer as they can replace partially both energy (cereals 
like wheat that is also used as binding agent) and protein (such as soybean or other plant 
and animal protein) (Fraser, 2005). These replacements could be very important if they 
do not have a negative impact on fish growth, fish health and final product quality. 
Green issues, environmental impacts and sustainability are all of considerable 
current concern and these legumes may have advantages in this respect. Their 
cultivation is suitable for climate conditions in southern Europe. This coincides with 
regions where European seabass and gilthead seabream are also farmed, potentially 
reducing transport costs and also soybean imports. In addition, cultivations of legumes 
may decrease nitrogen pollution through their ability to naturally fertilize poor fields 
that for years have been cultivated with cereals and they can also increase total yields 
through rotation (Grain legumes, 2006). After harvesting legumes a substantial amount 
of nitrogen is left in the field through incorporation of the plant residues adding at the 
same time the needed organic matter to maintain and improve soil health, long term 
fertility and sustainability of the ecosystem (Gaur et al., 2008). Chickpeas have an 
additional advantage over peas and faba beans that they can be cultivated in a wide 
range of different soil qualities (Davies et al., 1985) and they have low water demand 
(Loss and Siddique, 1997), as in their normal growing season they do not depend on 
rainfall water, considering that they cultivated on non-irrigative fields (Gaur et al., 
2008). 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
1.4.5.2 Antinutritional factors  
Plant materials are commonly used in fish feeds but their inclusion level is often 
limited due to lower levels of available protein and palatability issues compared to 
animal products as well as due to the presence of ANF (Tacon, 1993). As already 
mentioned before, some important ANF of relevance include protease inhibitors, 
phytates, tannins, lectins, oligosaccharides and non-starch polysaccharides (Francis et 
al., 2001) and their inactivation includes a variety of methods such as dehulling, 
germination, soaking and enzyme addition or heat treatment such autoclave, roasting 
and extrusion (Francis et al., 2001). Indicative contents of ANF in peas, chickpeas and 
faba beans are presented in Table 1.8.

CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
1.5 Feed processing and extrusion 
1.5.1 General 
Most commercial fish feeds are processed by compression pelleting or extrusion 
and other manufactured forms include moist and semi-moist, microencapsulated and 
micropulverized feeds (NRC, 1993). Processing techniques such as heat treatment, 
solvent extraction, flaking and grinding can improve the nutritional value of the diet 
ingredients and this in turn could be very beneficial for several fish species (Gouveia 
and Davies, 2000) 
1.5.2 Processing Methods 
Processing of the feed mixture through grinding, steam conditioning and extrusion 
is currently a big issue for fish feed companies, as these processes inevitably affect both 
the physical and chemical characteristics of a feed (Hilton et al., 1981). These 
characteristics include water stability and durability, pellet hardness, nutrient 
availability and digestibility (Hardy, 1989). Other factors influenced by processing such 
as the palatability and organoleptic properties of a diet may affect the amount of feed 
consumed by a target species (Mackie and Mitchell, 1985). 
Since the method of pelletisation has a major influence on the nutritional 
characteristics of feeds it is important to ensure that ingredients identified as having 
potential in aquaculture feeds are incorporated into experimental diets that reflect 
current commercial processing (Oliva-Teles et al., 1994). There are a lot of different 
processing methods to produce pellets, but there are just few general techniques (Hardy 
and Barrows, 2002) described below . 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
1.5.2.1 Pelleting 
Cold pellet extrusion involves no thermal activity and the wet mixture is forced 
through a plate with holes drilled into it. The resulting noodles are cut into appropriate 
lengths by an external cutting blade as they leave the die (Hardy and Barrows, 2002).  
Compressed pelleting is a process which forces a feed mixture through holes in a 
metal die by the action of a roller located inside the die. Before this, the mixture can be 
exposed to dry steam for some seconds to increase the temperature to about 85C and 
the moisture to about 16% (Hardy and Barrows, 2002), but compressed pellets can also 
be produced without any steam as well (Thomas et al., 1997).  
Extruded pellets are made in the same general way as compressed pellets, but the 
use of different dies and physical conditions results in a very different product (Hardy 
and Barrows, 2002) as described below. 
1.5.3 Extrusion 
Extrusion requires more elaborate equipment and higher inputs of moisture, heat 
and pressure than simple pelleting. Usually, mixed ingredients are finely ground before 
entering the pre-conditioner where steam treatment takes place until the mixture is 
converted into a mash that may or may not be pre-cooked (pre-conditioning) before 
entering the extruder. The mash, which contains around 25% moisture, is compacted 
and heated to 104 - 148C under pressure in the barrel of the extruder. As the material 
is squeezed through die holes at the end of the barrel, and external pressure decreases, 
part of the water in the superheated dough immediately vaporizes and causes expansion 
of the feed particles (NRC, 1993) leaving a large number of air-filled interstices. The 
extruded particles have high moisture content and require external heat for drying. 
Thus, after extrusion the particles must pass through a drying process to reduce 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
moisture to a safe level for storage (NRC, 1993). The air trapped inside the particles 
enables, when needed, the coating under vacuum with oil and other heat-sensitive 
materials giving an important advantage to this method. 
Extrusion processing can impart a wide range of different physical characteristics 
to the final product due to the different settings in pre-conditioning, the types and 
number of screws (single or twin-screw) in the extruder, the screw speed, the 
temperature, the mechanical shear and the duration of every application (Thomas et al., 
1997). This manufacturing method has the advantage of short cooking time and high 
productivity, but high operating costs. 
1.5.3.1 Effects of extrusion on feed nutrients 
Manufacturing processes can influence the utilization of nutrient ingredients and 
feed intake in fish (Booth et al., 2000). The effects of processing can differ for different 
species and it is important to apply the appropriate processing technique to maximize 
production efficiency at the lowest possible cost (Tacon, 1990). The use of extrusion 
increases nutrient availability of plant meals especially in relation to the amount of DE 
available through starch gelatinization. Dias et al. (1998) reported that inclusion of 
extruded wheat in the diet had an advantage over raw wheat improving energy 
digestibility of the diet for European seabass. More specifically extrusion processing 
gelatinizes starch and improves the digestion of starch in salmonids (Thodesen and 
Storebbaken, 1998).  
Mild extrusion processing usually enhances the digestibility of plant proteins 
(Hkansson et al., 1987), while Booth et al. (2002) found increased feed efficiency and 
DP of extruded diets compared with cold and steam pelleted diets for silver perch. 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
Extrusion seems not only to improve protein and carbohydrate digestibility, but 
also lipid digestibility. The influence on lipid digestibility could be related to a decrease 
in indigestible carbohydrates (Storebakken et al., 1998). 
Extrusion effects have been investigated in some ingredients, and resulted in 
increased nutritional value of rapeseed and peas for rainbow trout (Gomes et al., 1993), 
improvement of digestibility of canola meal for chinook salmon Oncorhynchus 
tshawytscha (Satoh et al., 1998), and increased nutritional value of dehulled pea seed 
meal for European seabass (Gouveia and Davies, 2000). However, Oliva-Teles et al. 
(1994) reported that extrusion had no effect on the nutritional value of full fat soybean 
in rainbow trout diets and, according to Sorensen et al. (2002), differences in extrusion 
temperatures (100, 125 and 150C) caused no significant differences in ADC of crude 
protein, individual amino acids or energy in fish meal and wheat meal based diets for 
rainbow trout. 
While processing techniques can improve the nutritional and physical qualities of 
diet ingredients, the heating process can also have detrimental effects. Damage to 
proteins and losses in nutritional value with destruction of IAA and reduction in amino 
acid availability, with lysine being the most sensitive, may be observed during 
processing (Papadopoulos, 1989). Allan et al. (2000) also reported that excessive heat 
during the rendering process could reduce the digestibility of proteins and amino acids, 
damage lysine and contribute to low nitrogen digestibility in animal meals. Generally, 
severe heating in combination with low moisture content have resulted in reduction of 
digestibility of most amino acids in fishmeal (Ljokjel et al., 2000). In addition, heat 
labile vitamins can also be lost at elevated temperatures, for example ascorbic acid had 
been shown to be unstable during heat treatments such as steam conditioning and 
extrusion (Slinger et al., 1979). 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
1.5.3.2 Effects of extrusion on feed ANF 
Various processing procedures can decrease levels of a number of ANFs and, 
concurrently, increase the protein and starch availability of the plant seeds as has been 
shown by several authors (Gomes et al., 1993; Oliva-Teles et al., 1994; Pfeffer et al., 
1995; Abd El-Hady and Habiba, 2003; Wang et al., 2004). Specific protease inhibitors, 
lectins, antivitamins and -amylase inhibitor are heat labile factors (Abd El-Hady and 
Habiba, 2003; Wang et al., 2004), which means that extrusion processing can reduce or 
minimize their activity. According to the same authors, saponins, non-starch 
polysaccharides, antigenic proteins, phytoestrogens and some phenolic compounds that 
are classified as ANFs are heat resistant. 
Legume extrusion cooking may allow reduction of ANF and therefore improve the 
nutritional quality at a cost lower than other heating systems (baking, autoclaving, etc.) 
due to more efficient use of energy and better process control with greater production 
capacities (Alonso et al., 2000a). The digestibility coefficients of legumes increased 
after extrusion, compared to raw legumes both in vitro and in vivo, namely in rats 
(Alonso et al., 2000b), but also in rainbow trout (Cheng and Hardy, 2003a; Cheng and 
Hardy, 2003b) and silver perch (Allan and Booth, 2004). 
CHAPTER 1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
1.6 General objectives 
The objective of the present study was to investigate peas, chickpeas and faba 
beans as potential feed ingredients for European seabass and gilthead seabream in 
extruded commercial-type diets. Each one of these legumes were used up to an 
inclusion level of 35% as an energy source replacing wheat and as a protein source 
replacing partially different protein sources in each experiment. Specifically the 
objectives were: 
1) To elucidate the effect of different processing conditions on the whole seed flour 
of the tested ingredients with respect to both nutritional and antinutritional 
factors and to examine the physical characteristics of experimental diet pellets 
including high and low levels of each legume. 
2) To investigate the effects of wheat substitution in high fish meal diets on both 
digestibility, gastrointestinal evacuation rate and glucose load of seabass. 
3) To estimate growth, digestibility, haematological parameters, histological 
effects and fillet organoleptic characteristics when the tested legumes replaced 
wheat and also the interactions between inclusion level of starch (low and high) 
and legume type in European seabass diets. 
4) To estimate growth, haematological parameters and histological effects when 
the tested legumes replaced wheat and also the interactions between inclusion 
level of starch (low and high) and legume type in gilthead seabream diets. 
Chapter 2. General Materials and Methods 
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.1 Experimental diets 
2.1.1 Processing system 
Extrusion processing of raw legumes and diets took place at the BioMar 
TechCentre (Brande, DK). A CLEXTRAL BC 45 twin-screw extruder was used, with 
screw diameter of 55mm and an overall active length of 800mm. All legumes and 
wheat were ground to fine flour (1.5mm) just before heat processing. Legumes and 
diets were treated in a home made single-screw preconditioner before entering the 
extruder. The temperature at the first part of the extruder, at the middle part and at the 
outer die of the extruder was constant for each treatment. The extrudates were 
conveyed into a 6 level GEELEN dryer. After drying the pellets entered into a 
GEELEN cooler to cool quickly to room temperature. 
2.1.2 Diet production conditions 
When feeds were manufactured the extruder was operated at approximately 
340rpm and the feeder was set to deliver approximately 130-135gmin-1. Water 
addition was adjusted in the preconditioner and on the extruder barrel using metering 
pumps with variable settings (calibrated in kgh-1). Extrusion temperature at the outer 
die was 70C. Experimental diets for experiments I, II and III (described in section 
3.2.3) were produced as practical-type extruded pellets under the same conditions.  
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.2 Experimental animals and husbandry 
2.2.1 Experimental fish 
The experimental animals used in this study were European seabass for 
experiments I and II and gilthead seabream for experiment III. All in vivo experiments 
took place in the facilities of the Institute of Aquaculture of the Hellenic Centre for 
Marine Research in Athens (HCMR, Helliniko, Athens, Greece). 
2.2.2 Facilities 
Fish for experiments I and II, with respect to digestibility trials, were held in 
enclosed tanks at the aquarium facilities of HCMR. Fish for experiments II and III, 
with respect to growth trials, were held in small cages placed in cement tanks. All 
trials were carried out in triplicate. 
2.2.2.1 Digestibility tanks 
Digestibility trials were carried out in 15 cylindroconical fibreglass tanks of 
250L in two groups in order to test all 7 diets in triplicate; in the first group 5 diets 
were tested and in the second group three diets were tested including in both groups 
the control diet. The conical bottom of each tank ended in a horizontal pipe and this 
pipe ended in the faecal trap (Figure 2.1). Water inlet was via a pipe placed vertically 
at the water surface. The pipe had several holes on the same side and the 
unidirectional water flow set up a gentle circular current. The current moved faeces to 
the bottom of the tank immediately after they were voided into the water. The inflow 
rate was approximately 150Lh-1 and water was pumped continuously from the sea via 
a mechanical filter (5m) before entering the tanks. One airstone diffuser was located 
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
in each tank to provide sufficient oxygen, especially in the case of failure of the water 
supply. 
2.2.2.2 Growth tanks and cages 
Growth trials were carried out in 2 cement tanks in the outdoor facilities with 
dimensions 5m x 6m x 1.50m. Into the 2 cement tanks were placed a total of 21 small 
cages (Figure 2.2). The cage dimensions were 1m x 1.5m and 1.3m height and they 
were suspended about 20cm from the tank bottom. 400Lh-1 were pumped continually 
from the sea via a mechanical filter (5m) to each tank. Stone diffusers were placed in 
the tanks to provide sufficient oxygen as assurance, especially in the case of failure of 
the water supply. 
2.2.2.3 Water quality 
Oxygen concentration was approximately 81mgL-1, pH ranged from 7.8 to 8.0 
and salinity was 38ppt. Temperature of the water is defined for every experiment in 
the respective chapter. 
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Figure 2.1. Digestibility tanks and faecal trap 
Figure 2.2. Cages for growth trial 
2.2.3 Feeding  
Fish in experiments I, II and III were carefully hand fed to make sure no feed 
escaped from the cages. European seabass were fed to satiation for digestibility and 
growth trials, while one specific meal (1% of the wet bodyweight) was given to the fish 
before measuring gastrointestinal evacuation time and rate. Restricted feeding was 
applied to gilthead seabream in experiment III to avoid overfeeding as seabream is 
known to be voracious especially at high temperatures. The feed consumed was 
recorded daily. 
2.3 Sampling procedures 
2.3.1 Feed sampling 
At the beginning of each experiment sufficient amounts of the diets were collected 
to complete the analyses under investigation. Diets were thoroughly milled and kept 
refrigerated at 4C until analysed. 
2.3.2 Faeces sampling 
Faeces were collected in a trap using a modification of the Guelph method (Cho et 
al., 1982). The faecal trap was surrounded with ice during faecal settlement to minimize 
bacterial degradation. Faecal samples were removed every morning, prior to feeding, in 
centrifuge tubes. Faeces were centrifuged and kept at -20C until they were freeze-dried 
and subsequently analysed. 
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.3.3 Fish sampling 
Prior to any experimental procedure (e.g. weighing and blood sampling) all fish 
were anaesthetized using phenoxyethanol/ethanol (1:1, v/v) in a concentration of 
0.4mlL-1 (Ekmann, personal communication). After the experimental procedure the fish 
were placed in clean aerated sea water and allowed to recover before being returned to 
the experimental tanks. Measurements of fish weight were made at the beginning and 
throughout growth experiments.  
In growth experiments (II and III) fish were fasted for 40 hours and blood samples 
were taken prior to any other sampling procedure. Fish were killed with a sharp blow to 
the head. Two pools of 5 fish per cage were taken for whole body proximate 
composition analysis, 2 pools of 4 fish for fillet analysis, 8 fish for blood sampling, 
liver and viscera weight, 2 pools of 3 livers for glycogen and fat analysis and the 
internal organs of 3 fish per cage for histological analysis.  
Where fish were sacrificed for tissue sampling they were first anaesthetized and 
then killed with a sharp blow to the head such that death was instantaneous. Whole fish, 
tissue, intestine contents and blood samples were immediately stored as described in the 
methodology of the appropriate chapter for each experiment. All samples were placed 
in appropriate containers i.e. plastic tubes, centrifuge tubes, beakers, plastic bags etc 
and stored as required until further analyses.  
2.4 Proximate analysis of diets, tissues and faeces 
The chemical compositions of the experimental diets, fish tissues and faecal 
samples were determined by proximate analyses based on methods described in AOAC 
(1990). 
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.4.1 Lyophilization or freeze-drying  
During freeze-drying samples are quickly frozen onto the walls of a vessel that is 
then attached to an ice trap that is kept at -40C and a vacuum is applied. The water in 
the frozen sample sublimes and is deposited in the trap. Samples are left undisturbed 
until all the ice has sublimed and the sample container is no longer cold. Then air is 
slowly admitted to the system, and the vessels are removed. 
2.4.2 Moisture 
Approximately 1.5g of ground sample was placed in a pre-weighed porcelain cup. 
Moisture content was determined as the loss in weight on drying at 105C for 24 hours.  
2.4.3 Ash 
After moisture determination samples were placed in a furnace and ash content 
was determined as the residue after ignition at 550C for 12 hours.  
2.4.4 Crude protein 
Crude protein content was determined by Kjeldahl analysis (nitrogen x 6.25) using 
a Kjeltec Autoanalyser (Tecator). Crude protein is determined by estimating the total 
nitrogen content of a material, assuming that all nitrogen is proteinaceous in origin. 
Approximately 200mg of sample was added to the digestion tubes. A tablet containing 
7.5mg selenium as a catalyst was added to each sample together with 3 glass balls to aid 
boiling. Samples were then digested for 1 hour at 410C with 6ml concentrated H2SO4 
and 1ml of H2O2 was added to assist clarifying the sample. After cooling, 20ml of 
distilled water was added to each tube and the samples were distilled in Kjeldahl 
apparatus and titrated.  
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.4.5 Acid hydrolysis 
Extruded samples were hydrolysed using a Soxtec System 1047 hydrolysis unit 
(Tecator Application note 92/87). Approximately 1g of sample, 1g of celite and 100ml 
of HCl (3M) were added to each tube. All tubes were placed in the hydrolysis unit in a 
fume cupboard and boiled gently for 1 hour. The solutions in the tubes were then 
filtered through glass thimbles, which were then dried in an oven at 60C overnight. 
The following day the samples were extracted with petroleum ether according to 
Soxhlet method as described in 2.4.6. 
2.4.6 Crude fat 
Crude fat was determined by exhaustive Soxhlet extraction using a Soxtec System 
HT6 (Tecator application note 67/83). Approximately 3g of sample were added to a 
thimble and placed in the extraction unit. Samples were boiled for 30min. in petroleum 
ether and rinsed for 2 hours and the extracted lipid was completely collected in the 
extraction cups. After extraction the solvent was evaporated and the extracted material 
weighed. Total lipid content was estimated by the weight difference of the cups before 
and after the extraction. 
2.5 Lipid determination according to the phosphovanillin method  
The phosphovanillin method of Nengas et al. (1995) is a micro method appropriate 
for faeces analysis where total sample quantities are very low (approximately 70mg). 
Lipids were extracted from the faeces using chloroform/methanol 2/1 solution. The 
solvent was then evaporated and the remaining lipids oxidised with hot concentrated 
sulphuric acid. The resulting pink colour produced by reaction with the phosphovanillin 
reagent was measured in a spectrophotometer at 530nm. 
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.6 Lipid determination according to Folch method  
Folch is a gravimetric method appropriate for analysis of samples with high 
moisture contents (Folch et al., 1957), such as livers. The lipids are extracted in 
chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). 
250-300mg of homogenized liver sample stored at 20C, was weighed and added 
to test tubes. 5ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) were added to each tube and 
homogenized carefully in a bath of iced water. Dilutions were filtered under vacuum in 
a new pre-weighed tube. To the filtered solution 1ml of NaCl 0.9% was added, the 
contents vortex mixed and centrifuged at 2000rpm for 5min. The upper phase was 
discarded and approximately 1ml of Folch reagent (chloroform/methanol/NaCl 0.9%, 
3:48:47) was added. The upper phase was discarded again and the remaining solution 
was evaporated with nitrogen and put in the oven for 1h at 60C. Samples were left to 
cool and weighed. The fat content of the samples was calculated by the weight 
difference of the tubes before and after the extraction. 
2.7 Glycogen determination in liver tissue 
Glycogen was extracted from liver tissue using citrate buffer and quantitavely 
hydrolysed to glucose by amyloglucosidase and then glucose was measured 
colorimetrically with the Human kit (cat. No. 10260, HUMAN). The method is 
described by Murat and Serfaty (1974). 
100-120mg of frozen homogenized liver was weighed into test tubes and placed in 
ice. 5ml of citric acid buffer (0.1M, pH 4.3) were added to each tube. Samples were 
homogenized carefully and 100l of the amyloglucosidase enzyme solution were added 
to each tube followed by vortex mixing. Samples were incubated for 24h at room 
temperature and then centrifuged at 3000rpm for 10min. Supernatant was diluted (1/10) 
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
in citric buffer and 100l of the last dilution were pipetted to new tubes and 2.5ml of 
the HUMAN reagent were added. Tubes were incubated for 10min at room temperature 
and absorbance measured at 500nm. Glycogen content was calculated as: 
Glycogen, %=Glucose Standard (mg) 100
1.005.0
Where, mg of glucose standard=0.02mgml-1, Absstd is the absorbance of standard, 
Abss is the absorbance of sample, 5/0.05 the 1st dilution and 0.5/0.1=the 2nd dilution. 
2.8 Determination of Yttrium oxide (Y2O3)  
Yttrium oxide was included in the tested diets as a marker and was determined in 
diets and freeze-dried faeces according to Refstie et al. (1997). Approximately 150
200mg of sample was weighed and combusted at 550C overnight in glass scintillation 
vials. When cooled 5ml of HCl/HNO3 (2:1 v/v) was added and the samples were boiled 
until colourless. When cooled a few drops of water were added, the sample was 
dissolved in 1.25ml HNO3 (concentrated) and diluted to 25ml with distilled water. The 
concentration of Yttrium was measured using an ICAP spectrometer. Analysis took 
place in the labs of Plymouth University and at Stirling University with the support of 
technical staff. 
2.9 Carbohydrate determination  
2.9.1 Determination of Starch 
This method is used to determine starch according to the directions of the 
commercial kit; Megazyme Total Starch Assay Kit (Megazyme International, Ireland) 
(McCleary et al., 1992). Starch hydrolysis proceeds in two phases; in phase I, starch is 
partially hydrolysed and totally solubilised and in phase II, the starch dextrins are 
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
quantitatively hydrolysed to glucose by amyloglucosidase. For diet samples, complete 
solubilisation of starch was achieved by cooking the sample in the presence of 
thermostable -amylase. However, for legume samples that contained high levels of 
resistant starch, complete solubilisation and dextrinisation required pre-treatment with 
dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) at 100C. 
2.9.2 Determination of free glucose, sucrose and raffinose-series oligosaccharides  
This method is used to determine three different oligosaccharides; glucose, 
sucrose and the sum of raffinose series oligosaccharides (RSO) (raffinose, verbascose 
and stachyose), followed the directions of the commercial kit; Megazyme Raffinose/D-
Glucose Assay Kit (Megazyme International, Ireland). This method is applied to raw 
and extruded legumes after very fine grinding (ball milling). 
RSO are hydrolysed to galactose, glucose and fructose using -galactosidase and 
invertase. The glucose is then determined using glucose oxidase/peroxidase reagent 
spectrophotometrically. Raffinose, verbascose and stachyose are determined as a group 
and not each one separately. The results are expressed on a molar basis, since RSO 
contain one mole of glucose. 
2.9.3 Determination of total non-starch polysaccharides  
Determination of DF as NSP with spectrophotometric measurement of constituent 
sugars was carried out according to Englyst et al. (1994) with a modification. NSP 
content was calculated using the equation of a standard curve derived from a standard 
sugar solution. At the first stage starch present in the sample was completely removed 
enzymically, and the NSPs were broken into simple sugars under acidic hydrolysis and 
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
measured as a single value for total sugars by spectrophotometry. Values were obtained 
for total, insoluble and soluble NSP. 
The samples were treated with DMSO and consecutively with different enzymes; 
heat stable amylase (Termamyl 120L Type L, Novozyme), pancreatin (Sigma, 
Cat.No.P-1750), pullulanase (Promozyme 400L, Novozyme) and pectinase (Sigma, Cat. 
No. P4716-10KU). After NSP isolation by enzymatic hydrolysis, they were precipitated 
and washed repeatedly. Different precipitating and washing procedures were followed 
for the measurement of total and for insoluble NSP. The colour of the samples was 
obtained with 3,5- dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) and the absorbance measured at 530nm. 
The amount of S-NSP was calculated as the difference between total and insoluble 
2.10 Antinutritional factors determination 
2.10.1 Determination of total tannins 
Tannins were extracted from samples according to Budini et al. (1980) and 
determination was based on a formation of the Prussian Blue method (Graham, 1992). 
Tannins were extracted by gently refluxing the samples for 35min in 2N HCl. The 
contents were filtered while still hot into a 250ml volumetric flask and made up to 
volume with distilled water. The extract was incubated with K3Fe(CN)6 (0.016M) and 
FeCl3 (0.02M in 0.1N HCl) and then treated with 6M H3PO4  and 1% gum acacia. The 
colour was measured spectrophotometrically at 700nm and the measurement of tannins 
derived from the equation of a catechin standard curve. 
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.10.2 Determination of phytic acid  
Determination of phytate was carried out according to Latta and Eskin (1980) 
using anion-exchange column (AEC) with resin (AGI-X4, 100-200 mesh chloride form, 
Bio-Rad Laboratories). Determination of phytate is based on its precipitation as 
insoluble ferric phytate in acid solution. Phytate was extracted from the samples with 
dilute HCl and then the extracts were eluted through the AEC to separate inorganic 
phosphorus and avoid overestimation of phytate in the sample. Phytate was eluted with 
0.7M NaCl solution and determination of phytate was based on its reaction with Wade 
reagent (0.03% FeCl3 6H2O and 0.3% sulfosalisylic acid) and a phytic acid standard 
curve. 
2.10.3 Determination of trypsin inhibitors 
Trypsin inhibitors (TI) were determined according to the method of Smith et al. 
(1980) with some modifications. The method involves extraction of the inhibitors from 
the sample at pH 9.5 and mixing unfiltered suspensions with bovine trypsin. The 
activity of the remaining trypsin was then measured on BAPNA substrate (N-benzoyl-
DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide hydrochloride) under standard conditions. The p-nitroaniline 
released was measured spectrophotometrically at 410nm. This provided a linear 
measure of the residual trypsin activity (within the limits of the method), so that the 
amount of pure trypsin inhibited per unit weight of sample can be calculated.  
2.11 Serum analysis 
2.11.1 Determination of chemiluminescence 
Chemiluminescence was determined according to Marnila et al. (1995). The 
procedure took place in the Pathology & Immunology lab of HCMR under the 
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
supervision of Dr. Morgane Henry. Blood serum is separated from erythrocytes by 
centrifugation for 10min at 17000rpm. In quadruplate wells of a white flat-bottomed 96 
wells microplate (Nunc), 10l of 10mM luminol were added to 265l of diluted blood 
and kept for 10min at room temperature to allow the background chemiluminscence to 
stabilize. Then, 25l of non-opsonised zymosan at 5mgml-1 were added to each well 
and chemiluminescence was read every 3min for 2 hours in a GeniosPro luminometer 
(Tecan, Austria). Results were expressed as the peak chemiluminescence in relative 
luminescent units (rlu). 
2.11.2 Determination of glucose in blood serum 
The glucose oxidase method, GOD-PAP, was used for glucose measurement, 
without extracting the protein (cat. No. 10260, HUMAN). 10l of the serum was added 
to a 10ml tube and 1ml of the monoreagent added. Samples and the standards were left 
for 10min at 20-25C and the absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 
500nm. Serum glucose was calculated as: 
mgdLC = 100, 1   or 
mmolLC = 55.5, 1  
Where Abss is the absorbance of sample and Absstd the mean absorbance of 
standards. 
2.11.3 Determination of total protein in blood serum 
Serum protein was measured with the photometric method of Biuret, (cat. No. 
10570, HUMAN). 20l of serum was added to a 10ml tube and 1ml of monoreagent 
added. Samples and the standards were left for 10min at 20-25C and absorbance 
measured spectrophotometrically at 546nm. Serum protein was calculated as: 
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
C, gdL-1
= 8   or C, gL-1
= 80  
Where Abss is the absorbance of sample and Absstd the mean absorbance of 
standards. 
2.11.4 Determination of triacylglycerols in blood serum 
Serum triacylglycerols were measured with the enzymatic method L.C.F., 
Photometric method GPO-PAP (cat. No. 10724, HUMAN). 10l of serum was added to 
a 10ml tube and 1ml of monoreagent added. Samples and standards were left for 10min 
at 20-25C and absorbance measured spectrophotometrically at 546nm. Serum 
triacylglycerols was calculated as: 
C, mgdL-1
= 200  or C, mmolL-1
= 28.2  
Where Abss is the absorbance of sample and Absstd the mean absorbance of 
standards. 
2.11.5 Determination of cholesterol in blood serum 
Serum cholesterol was measured with the enzymatic method L.C.F., Photometric 
method GHOD-PAP (cat. No. 10028, HUMAN). 10l of serum was added to a 10 ml 
tube and 1ml of buffer solution added. For standards, 10l of standard solution was 
added to a 10ml tube and 1ml of monoreagent added. Samples and standards were left 
for 20min at 20-25C and absorbance measured spectrophotometrically at 546nm. 
Serum cholesterol was calculated as: 
C, mgdL-1
= 200   or C, mmolL-1
= 17.5 , 
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Where Abss is the absorbance of sample and Absstd the mean absorbance of 
standards. 
2.12 Histology of internal organs 
Tissues from organs related to digestion were dissected from European seabass 
and gilthead seabream in experiments II and III. Liver, anterior and posterior intestine, 
spleen and kidney were collected. The samples were fixed in formalin until processing. 
All formalin fixed tissues were routinely dehydrated in ethanol, methanol and 
embedded in paraffin according to standard histological techniques. Sections of 4m 
were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Histological examination was 
performed by light microscopy. Histology procedures took place in the histology lab of 
HCMR and Dr. George Rigos assisted with examination of the sections. 
2.13 Determination of physical characteristics of the pellets  
2.13.1 Texture analysis 
For texture determination of the pellets the Stable Micro Systems TA-XT2 
Texture Analyser was used and calibrated every several samples with a 5kg weight. For 
sample examination a blade (knife edge) was placed on the texture analyzer and cut 
through the sample at a speed of 1mms-1 from a distance of 5mm. The blade approach 
was applied by pressing the blade through the pellet vertical to the flat surface of the 
pellet cylinder. The shear force (Newton, N) was measured as the maximum force 
required cutting through the samples that was equal to the pick height of the given 
curve on a force (N)time (s) diagram. 
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.13.2 Water activity 
For the determination of water activity a Rotronic Hygrometer A3 was used. 
Extruded feed samples were examined using this device in a simple appliance. This 
parameter is very important for extruded products their possible storage time. This 
device can measure the relative humidity of the space around the sample. The principle 
of the method is based on the change of conductivity of the ingredients when moisture 
is present. The sample (15-20g) is placed in a small plastic container and when 
temperature and relative humidity of the sample space are stabilized the device gives 
the final value. Each measurement lasted for approximately 5min and all measurements 
took place at 23C with no replicates. 
2.13.3 Pellet density  
Pellet density d was measured by the formula d=m/V, where m is the mass 
determined in an analytical balance and V the cylinder volume of the pellet. 
Dimensions of 12 pellets, chosen to have the shape of a well formulated cylinder, were 
determined with a calliper. 
2.13.4 Water absorption  
Water absorption of the pellet was measured by immersing 15 pellets in sea water 
in triplicate groups for 5s and then determining moisture as described in section 2.4.2. 
The final value was calculated by subtracting the initial moisture content of the diet 
from the measured value. 
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.13.5 Pellet settling velocity  
In a volumetric cylinder of 1L and 34cm height, sea water, of salinity 38, and 
temperature at 20C, was added and pellets left to fall through the water and reach the 
bottom of the cylinder. The time (t) needed for each pellet to pass through 34cm of the 
cylinder was measured and the velocity (v) of the pellets of each diet determined 
according to the formula v=34/t cms-1. 
2.14 Calculations 
Calculation of digestibility coefficients 
ADCs for control and test diets were calculated according to the formula: 
ADC % = 100 x [1- (F x Dy)/(D x Fy)] 
Where F=nutrient or energy concentration in faeces, D=nutrient or energy 
concentration in diet, Dy=yttrium concentration in diet and Fy=yttrium concentration in 
faeces.  
Energy in diets and faeces was determined according to the formula (Blaxter, 
1989): 
Energy (kJg-1) = 23.6xP+17.3xS+39.5xF 
Where P=% protein in faeces or in diet, S=% starch in faeces or in diet, F=% fat in 
faeces or in diet.

of the sampled fish; P0 and P1 are the initial and final protein concentrations of the fish; 
PF is the protein concentration of the feed on a dry matter basis; cumulative feed intake 
was determined in grams on a dry matter basis. 
2.15 Statistics 
All the data are presented as meansSD (n=3). The statistical analyses for all 
experiments were performed using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc) and Statgraphics Plus 2.1. 
Gastrointestinal evacuation models in experiment I were plotted in Excel (Office 
Microsoft) and regressions were performed using the statistical program Statgraphics. 
The linear fits and the comparison of slopes were tested at a significance level P=0.05. 
CHAPTER 2. GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Significant differences between dietary treatments were determined by one-way or 
two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA, General Linear Model) depending on the 
case. Post-hoc tests were used to rank the groups and the main effects respectively at a 
significant level (P=0.05), while Tukey post-hoc test applied for one-way ANOVA and 
Bonferroni for two-way ANOVA. 
The experimental designs for the experiments I, II and III were factorial with 2 
factors (2 inclusion levels x 3 different legume types). A control diet that was 
absolutely comparable to 3 out of 6 experimental diets was also tested. Hence, the 
effects of the one factor were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, but also one-way 
ANOVA applied for all seven diets. The effects of two factors and their interactions 
were analysed by two-way ANOVA. When significant interactions of the two factors 
were observed, multiple comparison testing was performed to look at the simple main 
effects (instead of the main effects), that is the main effect of one factor at a given level 
of the other (Zar, 1999).  
Data were tested for their normality by One-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test 
and Homogeneity of Variances by Levene test in experiments I, II and III. Data that 
were identified as non-homogeneous (Levenes test) were subjected to square root, 
exponential or log transformation before analysis.  
Possible differences among the different dietary groups for their organoleptic 
characteristics were checked by non Parametric Kruskal-Wallis test (SPSS, 13.0) in 
experiment II.

Chapter 3. Effects of extrusion on peas, chickpeas and faba 
beans and evaluation of pellet physical properties 
CHAPTER 3. EXTRUSION OF PEAS, CHICKPEAS & FABA BEANS 
3.1 Introduction 
Legumes like faba beans, chickpeas and field peas are valuable potential sources 
of both protein and energy for European seabass and gilthead seabream feeds. All 
these crops are cultivated in Mediterranean countries as well as in the rest Europe. 
This could be an advantage with a positive effect on the final price of the product due 
to minimization of transport costs, and also in development of agricultural production 
with vertical integration between seed and fish feed production. It is, however, well 
known that the use of legumes, especially for carnivorous species, is limited due to 
the presence of various ANF. 
To overcome this problem, a variety of techniques have been already examined 
in plant materials like soaking (Frias et al., 2000), boiling (Marquez and Alonso, 
1999), autoclaving (Mansour et al., 1993), microwaving (Marconi et al., 2000), 
roasting, dehulling, germination, fermentation (Chitra et al., 1996), supplementation 
with enzymes (Riche and Garling, 2004) and extrusion cooking (Abd El-Hady and 
Habiba, 2003). To destroy or eliminate the effects of ANF and to improve the 
physical (texture and palatability) and chemical (starch gelatinization) characteristics 
of feeds, modern fish feed technology applies extrusion processing (Sorensen et al., in 
press). Extrusion processing, as described in section 1.5.3, includes a series of 
different pieces of apparatus such as grinder, preconditioner, extruder, drier and 
cooler that have a wide range of abilities and which can differentiate the final product 
depending on steam and water quantity, pressure, mechanical shear, temperatures, 
duration of application and die dimensions (Thomas and van der Poel, 1996; Thomas 
et al., 1997). 
CHAPTER 3. EXTRUSION OF PEAS, CHICKPEAS & FABA BEANS 
Regarding ANFs, TI is a crystalline globular protein that has been shown to 
depress the growth rate of mammals, chickens and fish and also to cause pancreatic 
hypertrophy (Hendricks, 2002). Phytic acid is the hexaphosphate of myo-inositol and 
is a constituent of all cereals and oilseed meals and has the capacity to tightly bind 
divalent cations present in seeds, such as calcium, magnesium and zinc rendering 
them unavailable to animals when ingested (Hendricks, 2002). Tannins are secondary 
compounds of various chemical structures widely occurring in the plant kingdom and 
are generally divided into hydrolysable and condensed tannins. Their antinutritional 
effects include interference with digestive processes by binding enzymes or by 
binding to feed components such as proteins or minerals (Liener, 1989). Tannins also 
reduce the absorption of vitamin BB12, while they are known to interact with other 
antinutrients. For instance interaction between tannins and lectins seems to reduce the 
inhibitory action of tannins on amylase (De Boer and Bickel, 1988) and their 
interaction with cyanogenic glycosides reduces the deleterious effects of the latter 
(Bromley, 1994). 
Oligosaccharides are low molecular weight carbohydrates containing -
galactosidic and -fructosidic linkages. Sucrose, and RSO (raffinose, stachyose and 
verbascose) have been indicated as the causative factors of osmotic effects in the 
intestine and anaerobic fermentation of these sugars results in increasing gas 
production (Van Barnevelt, 1999). NSP are important constituents of grain legumes 
and cereals (Grabner and Hofer, 1985), and their negative effects in fish may be due 
either to binding to bile acids or obstructing the action of digestive enzymes and 
movement of substrates in the intestine (Storebakken et al., 1998). The NSP, and 
particularly the S-NSP, are more detrimental to growth of fish than the 
oligosaccharides (Refstie et al., 1999) because they have the ability to trap water and 
CHAPTER 3. EXTRUSION OF PEAS, CHICKPEAS & FABA BEANS 
form gum-like masses in the intestine which increase the viscosity of intestinal 
contents and obstruct digestive enzyme activity as explained in section 1.1.2. 
Extrusion is effective in the inactivation of TI (Aslaksen et al., 2007), while 
temperature does not seem to improve bioavailability of minerals bound by phytic 
acid (Francis et al., 2001). The positive effect of extrusion on digestibility of all 
nutrients in plant feedstuffs could be attributed to a partial degradation of NSP 
(Francis et al., 2001). However, this degradation is not sufficient to consider NSPs as 
heat-labile ANF (Alonso et al., 2001). 
Plant materials can affect the pelleting properties of feed mash when included in 
fish diets (Thomas et al., 1998). Hardness, durability, water absorption, settling 
velocity and density are the main physical characteristics and some of these could be 
affected when new feedstuffs are included in diets, whilst different type of starch (e.g. 
amylose/amylopectin ratio, starch granules) and fibres (soluble or insoluble) in 
combination with processing conditions can also differentiate the final product 
(Thomas et al., 1998). The legumes tested in the present study have high starch 
contents and NSP (Englyst and Hudson, 1996; Knudsen, 1997) and were included up 
to 36g100g-1 in diets. It was thus essential to investigate the effects of their 
incorporation on the physical properties of the pellets. 
The aim of the present research was to investigate the effect of two different 
preconditioning temperatures and three different drying temperatures in combination 
on the chemical composition and some key ANF of peas, chickpeas and faba beans. 
Proximate composition, TI, total tannins, phytic acid, oligosaccharides and NSP were 
determined, before including whole seed flours in seabass and seabream diets using 
commercial pellet manufacturing conditions. The same batches of legume seeds were 
CHAPTER 3. EXTRUSION OF PEAS, CHICKPEAS & FABA BEANS 
contained in the experimental diets, for seabass and seabream in the in vivo trials 
(Experiments I, II and III).  
3.2 Materials and Methods 
3.2.1 Tested ingredients 
Three different legumes were used for the present experiment: 1) middle size, 
kabulitype chickpeas (CP) and 2) an early-middle season and low tannin variety and 
light beige seed colour peas (P), both cultivated, in the area of Thessaly in central 
Greece and 3) a common faba bean (horse beans) variety (B), cultivated in Denmark. 
3.2.2 Processing of tested ingredients 
Extrusion processing of raw materials took place at the BioMar TechCentre 
(Brande, DK) using the system described in detail in section 2.1.1. Pea, chickpea and 
faba bean whole seeds were ground to fine flour (1.5mm) and processed separately. 
Wheat (W) was only tested for one processing treatment and for two different 
grinding sizes (1.5mm and 0.2mm).  
Flours were first treated in the preconditioner at temperatures below, above and 
standard for commercial processing procedures before entering the extruder. The 
temperature was approximately 70C for the low (Lp), about 90C for the standard 
(Sp) and 100C for the high (Hp) temperature preconditioner treatment. One sample 
was taken of each material during the standard preconditioner treatment (Sp/-), at the 
extruder exit, without being dried. These samples contained more than 20% moisture 
and they were freeze dried before the analysis (P6, CP6, B6). 
The extruder was operated at 380rpm and the feeder was set to deliver 107-
116gmin-1. Moisture contents were consistent in both barrels with a water flow of 
CHAPTER 3. EXTRUSION OF PEAS, CHICKPEAS & FABA BEANS 
12.5kgh-1 in the extruder barrel. The extrudates were conveyed into a 6 level dryer 
and the temperature lowered from 120-90C for the standard (Sd) and from 150-
120C for high (Hd) drier treatment. Processing conditions are presented in summary 
in Table 3.1.

3.2.3 Diet formulation 
All diets were manufactured at the BioMar TechCentre (Brande, DK) using a 
twin-screw extruder as described in section 2.1. Legumes were ground to pass a 
1.5mm screen. All diets contained 0.1% yttrium oxide (Y2O3) as an indigestible 
marker. Processing of the tested diets was decided to be the common commercial 
procedure. The extruder was operated at approximately 340rpm and the feeder was set 
CHAPTER 3. EXTRUSION OF PEAS, CHICKPEAS & FABA BEANS 
to deliver 135gmin-1. Mass moisture content was maintained in both barrels with a 
water flow of 6kgh-1 in the extruder barrel while the temperature in the outlet die was 
approximately 70C. The dryer temperatures on the different levels ranged from 110-
90C and the cooler was set at 11 C. 
3.2.3.1 Diets for Experiment I 
Chickpeas, field peas, and faba beans were included in diets that were 
formulated to be isoenergetic (20kJg-1) and isonitrogenous (42g100g-1 protein) 
containing 15g100g-1 (CP15, P15 and B15) or 30g100g-1 (CP30, P30 and B30) of 
each legume plus a wheat based (23%) control diet. In diets containing 15g100g-1 of 
legumes, half of the wheat was replaced compared to the control, whilst in diets 
containing 30g100g-1 of legumes wheat was completely replaced (excluding 1g100g-1 
of wheat in CP30 diet). The pellet diameter was intended to be 4.5mm (Table 3.2). 
3.2.3.2 Diets for Experiment II 
The same legumes were included in the experimental diets of Experiment II. Six 
practical type extruded diets were formulated containing approximately 17g100g-1 (L 
diets) or 35g100g-1 (H diets) of each legume plus the control diet (Table 3.3). All diets 
were intended to be isoenergetic (20kJg-1) and isonitrogenous (40g100g-1 protein) and 
were formulated to include similar levels of fishmeal (26g100g-1) and high levels of 
plant protein sources (soybean meal, high protein sunflower and corn gluten). In L 
diets, legumes completely substituted wheat compared to the control diet. However, to 
formulate H diets it was necessary to reduce plant proteins (soybean and high protein 
sunflower) by half, to maintain the protein and energy content. The diameter of the 
pellets was intended to be 4.5mm. 
CHAPTER 3. EXTRUSION OF PEAS, CHICKPEAS & FABA BEANS 
3.2.3.3 Diets for Experiment III 
Six practical type extruded diets were formulated containing approximately 
17g100g-1 (L diets) or 35g100g-1 (H diets) of each legume (P, CP, B) plus the control 
diet (Table 3.4). All diets were intended to be isoenergetic (19kJg-1) and 
isonitrogenous (42g100g-1 protein) and were formulated to include equal levels of 
fishmeal and plant protein sources (soybean meal, high protein sunflower, corn gluten 
and the tested legumes). In L diets, legumes completely substituted wheat compared 
to the control diet. However, H diets were formulated as practical, low cost and 
sustainable diets and thus it was necessary to reduce plant proteins differently 
(soybean and high protein sunflower and gluten), to maintain the protein, energy and 
IAA content. The pellet diameter was intended to be 4mm. 
3.2.4 Chemical analysis 
Proximate analysis was based on methods of AOAC (1990) as described in 
section 2.4. ANF (total tannins, phytic acid and TI) were determined by the methods 
described in section 2.10. Starch, total, soluble and insoluble NSP were determined 
according to the chemical methods described in section 2.9. All ingredients were ball-
milled prior to analysis for the materials to be more consistent, especially for the 
enzymatic methods. 
3.2.5 Physical characteristics of the diet pellets 
Texture analysis to determine the pellet hardness, water activity, pellet density, 
water absorption and settling velocity were determined as described in section 2.13.

CHAPTER 3. EXTRUSION OF PEAS, CHICKPEAS & FABA BEANS 
3.3 Results 
3.3.1 Proximate composition and ANFs of tested ingredients 
Statistical analysis was not performed between the treatments because each set 
of processing conditions was applied only once. Mean values of replicates of both 
chemical and physical analysis would only support ANOVA with respect to analytical 
precision, while tests comparing values without replicates (e.g. Friedman test) were 
not appropriate for the present data (Dytham, 1999). Additionally, the identity of the 
carbohydrates, variances among seed varieties (Saini and Knights, 1984), differences 
in ANFs chemical methods and in processing equipment and temperatures (e.g. 
single or twin-screw extruders) make quantitative comparisons to similar studies 
difficult. Nevertheless, some useful conclusions can be drawn.  
Proximate composition, S-NSP, I-NSO and total NSP, F-glucose (free glucose), 
sucrose and RSO and ANFs of raw and extruded faba beans are presented in Tables 
3.5 and 3.6, of chickpeas in Tables 3.7 and 3.8, peas in Tables 3.9 and 3.10 and wheat 
results are presented in Tables 3.11 and 3.12. 
Higher protein content was found for the raw faba beans with 31.4g100g-1, 
followed by chickpeas (27g100g-1), peas (24.4g100g-1) and wheat (17.7g100g-1), fat 
content was very low and similar for faba beans, peas (ca. 1.6g100g-1) and wheat 
(1.8g100g-1) and higher for chickpeas (5.5g100g-1). Faba beans had higher ash content 
(4.3g100g-1) compared to chickpeas, peas and wheat (3.5, 3.3, and 2.3g100g-1) 
Starch content was highest for raw wheat 66.2 g100g-1 followed by peas and 
chickpeas (ca. 42g100g-1) and faba beans (36.9g100g-1) and extrusion generally 
increased starch values of the processed materials. 
CHAPTER 3. EXTRUSION OF PEAS, CHICKPEAS & FABA BEANS 
Faba beans included highest levels of total NSP (18.3-23.7g100g-1), followed by 
peas (14.0-16.4g100g-1) and chickpeas (12.9-13.8g100g-1), while the ratio I-NSP/S-
NSP (I/S) in raw materials was similar for peas and chickpeas (3.7) and higher than 
faba beans (2.1). Faba beans contained the highest levels of phytate (3.2g100g-1) and 
tannins (1.3g100g-1) and raw chickpeas contained the highest levels of TI (14.7mgg-1), 
but after heat treatment non linear changes were observed for these parameters. 
Chickpea and field pea NSP values do not seem to be much affected by 
processing, with only a small trend of reduction in total and I-NSP, whilst similar 
results for faba beans were found only for Sp/- processing. For all the other 
processing methods in faba beans total NSP, S-NSP and I-NSP seem to be slightly 
reduced.  
Total oligosaccharide values were higher for raw peas (6.6g100g-1) followed by 
chickpeas (5.1g100g-1), faba beans (3.9g100g-1) and wheat (1.7g100g-1), free glucose 
amounts were negligible. However, higher values were obtained for faba beans 
(0.2g100g-1). Sucrose values were similar for raw chickpeas, peas and wheat (ca. 1.1-
1.4g100g-1) and lower for faba beans (0.9g100g-1), RSO were higher in raw peas 
(5.3g100g-1), 3.7g100-1 in chickpeas, 2.8g100g-1 for faba beans and only 0.5g100g-1 
for wheat. Heat processing slightly reduced total oligosaccharides in most of the cases 
in peas and increased them in faba bean and chickpea.  
TI were reduced for all processed products with the highest effect for the 
legumes to be in chickpeas (86-92%) while TI in wheat were not detected after heat 
treatment. Overall, phytate and total tannins were affected to a lower extent or they 
were unaffected by processing. Phytate values were reduced up to 22% for B, 16% for 
CP and 18% for P, while total tannins reduced by up to 11% for B, 18% for CP and 
12% for P.

3.3.2 Physical characteristics of the diets used in experiments I, II and III 
Physical properties of diet pellets for Experiment I were examined (Table 3.13) 
and it was found that among the seven diets CP30 pellets were the hardest (13.8N), 
while B30 pellets were less hard (11.1N). Seawater absorption in 5s was lower for B30 
(2.5% total moisture) and higher for B15 (6.8%). Settling velocity was slower for CP15 
(6.7cms-1) and faster for control (11.2cms-1). Density was significantly higher for the 
control and lower for the diets including chickpeas. Pellet diameters varied from 4.8-
5.3mm. 
Differences were found for diet pellets produced for experiment II (Table 3.14) for 
hardness after texture analysis. BH (16.4N) and CPH (16.0N) gave the highest values 
and CPL (11.1N) the lowest. Seawater absorption in 5s was lower for CPH (3.7% of 
total moisture) and higher for control (5.7%). Settling velocity was slower for BH 
(4.8cms-1) and faster for CPL (9.1cms-1). Pellet density was lower for diets CPH and 
BH (0.94gcm-3) and higher for diet CPL (1.10gcm-3). Measurements of pellet diameters 
showed that the pellet sizes among the diets varied from 4.5-4.9mm. 
Hardness and values were very similar among the pellets of diets tested for 
experiment III (Table 3.15). Water absorption was lower for diet BL (2.8%) and higher 
for PH (5.1%). Settling velocity was slower for the control (7.3cms-1) and faster for 
CPH (9.5cms-1) and PH (9.3cms-1). Pellet density ranged from 0.99gcm-3 for the control 
to 1.16gcm-3 for diet PH. Measurements of pellet diameters showed that the values for 
the diets varied from 4.1-4.3mm. 
Water activity (aw) values of the diets used in all three Experiments ranged from 
0.44-0.61.

CHAPTER 3. EXTRUSION OF PEAS, CHICKPEAS & FABA BEANS 
3.4 Discussion 
3.4.1 Raw materials and processing 
Small differences in the ash, protein and fat composition of legumes and wheat 
among the processing treatments could be attributed to normal variations in the 
analytical methods. Extrusion did not affect either pea or faba bean protein values in 
other studies (Alonso et al., 2000a; Alonso et al., 2000b) or ash and ether extract of 
extruded peas (Alonso et al., 2000b). Protein and ash were also measured in raw and 
extruded peas, chickpeas and faba beans by Abd El-Hady and Habiba (2003) and no 
differences were found again for any of the legumes before and after processing, while 
the absolute concentration of protein and ash was slightly higher in the present study 
only for faba beans. 
Starch analysis showed an overall increase in the processed materials that could be 
related to composition changes in the resistant starch. Resistant legume starch 
corresponds to physically inaccessible starch that is entrapped in the cellular matrix 
(Englyst et al., 1992) that in most cases is destroyed by processing (Gonzalez-Soto et 
al., 2006). Thermal processing such as cooking has been proven to cause a significant 
reduction of resistant and poorly digestible starch and an increase in rapidly digestible 
starch in peas (Periago et al., 1996), chickpeas and common beans (Marconi et al., 
2000). However, in some cases (potato and banana starch) amylose retrogradation may 
occur resulting in resistant starch when raw materials are either freeze dried or 
autoclaved (Gonzalez-Soto et al., 2006). In this respect, highly digestible starch may 
have increased and this is possibly reflected in the final starch values, while resistant 
starch formation is less likely to occur in legume starches. The increased values 
CHAPTER 3. EXTRUSION OF PEAS, CHICKPEAS & FABA BEANS 
observed for total starch in processed legumes could be possibly attributed to the easier 
breakage of extruded starch granules by amylase during analysis.  
Total NSP were reduced in all extruded faba beans and peas compared to 
respective raw product values. Extruded chickpeas also had lower values but the 
reduction was smaller and these results are in agreement with the results of Alonso et al. 
(2000b) for extruded peas. A redistribution of S-NSP and I-NSP has been found in rice 
after press cooking (Sagum and Arcot, 2000) or in cooked chickpeas and common 
beans (Marconi et al., 2000) with increase of S-NSP and decrease of I-NSP (reduction 
of ratio I/S-NSP) after treatment. This may be comparable to the results for the extruded 
chickpeas and peas in the present study although total NSP were not affected in the case 
of pressure cooking (Marconi et al., 2000). Anguita et al. (2006) also noted that 
extrusion can increase solubilization of pea NSP, however, solubilisation is less and 
absolute numbers are higher in the present study and this may be attributed to 
differences in field pea variety. The redistribution of S-NSP and I-NSP fractions could 
be attributed to the partial solubilization or depolymerization of hemicellulose and 
insoluble pectic substances (Vidal-Valverde et al., 1992). Faba bean and wheat flour 
that underwent drying processing in the present study showed decreased values of S-
NSP as opposed to peas, chickpeas and the results of the aforementioned authors but, 
when faba bean flour was not dried, S-NSP increased. Different behaviours amongst 
legumes could be attributed to differences in the synthesis of the NSP fraction; for 
example pea uronic acids and mannose seem to increase, while xylose does not change 
under extrusion and rhamnose and arabinose are stable (Alonso et al., 2000b). Different 
results were reported by Periago et al. (1996) between raw and cooked peas NSP 
fractions, indicating that differences could be expected in the results. 
CHAPTER 3. EXTRUSION OF PEAS, CHICKPEAS & FABA BEANS 
Alonso et al. (2000b) found that pea sucrose, raffinose and verbascose were 
increased after extrusion processing, but significant differences were only observed for 
verbascose values, while stachyose values significantly decreased. In a later work the 
same authors (Alonso et al., 2001) found that pea and kidney bean sucrose, stachyose 
and verbascose did not differ before and after extrusion, while raffinose significantly 
decreased in kidney beans. In addition, autoclaving rapeseed for 1.5 hours resulted in 
decreased levels of sucrose and stachyose (Mansour et al., 1993). In this respect the 
result of extrusion on total oligosaccharides could also be dependent on the fraction 
composition that could be variable among different pulses or seed parts such as hulls, 
dehulled seeds or protein concentrates (Knudsen, 1997). 
Phytic acid values in processed ingredients vary in the literature. For instance, 
Alonso et al. (1998; 2000a; 2000b; 2001) found significant reduction in peas (5.9%), in 
faba beans (29%) and kidney beans (4%) after extrusion at 150C (in outer die). 
However, according to Abd El-Hady and Habiba (2003) findings much lower reduction 
of phytate was observed between raw and extruded legumes at 140C or 180C (barrel 
temperature). Gualberto et al. (1997) showed that extrusion did not affect cereal bran 
phytate content. In the present study extruded peas, chickpeas and faba bean phytate 
values either remained the same or decreased up to 17.5, 17.5 and 22.5% respectively 
compared to the raw legumes. The reduction of phytate though was not consistent for 
the different processing methods and thus further investigation is imperative. 
Francis et al. (2001) in their review of antinutrients mentioned that the effect of 
thermal treatment on substances like tannins is still not clear. Total tannins in the 
current study did not seem to be affected drastically, with most of the values in 
processed legumes being slightly lower than the values in raw materials. In some cases 
though that was not the case. In this respect the results are partially in accordance with 
CHAPTER 3. EXTRUSION OF PEAS, CHICKPEAS & FABA BEANS 
those of Abd El-Hady and Habiba (2003) who found a slight decrease in tannins in 
peas, chickpeas and faba beans after different extrusion temperatures. Nonetheless 
Alonso et al. (1998, 2000a, 2000b) presented significant reduction in both tannins and 
polyphenols in peas and faba beans when extruded at 150C and this reached 92% when 
compared to the raw legumes. Reduction of condensed tannins was also observed for 
peas and kidney beans by Alonso et al. (2001) under the same extrusion conditions. 
Differences in tannin reduction could be attributed to higher temperatures or to the 
duration of processing methods and these are not always clear especially for the 
extrusion appliance. It has also been suggested that heat treatment possibly reduces 
extractability by increasing polymerisation of tannins and thus showing lower values 
after analysis (van der Poel et al., 1991). 
TI are known to be heat sensitive (Francis et al., 2001) and they can be reduced or 
completely destroyed in different plant materials and under different processing 
methods (Marquez and Alonso, 1999; Frias et al., 2000; Romarheim et al., 2005). High 
values of TI in raw chickpeas, similar to the present study, have also been reported from 
other authors (Abd El-Hady and Habiba, 2003). The highest reduction of TI among 
legumes was noted in chickpeas reaching 92%, while for faba beans it was up to 44%, 
for peas up to 59% and in wheat TI was not detected in the extrudates. Reduction of 
95% in peas was found by Alonso et al. (2000a; 2000b) and 99% in faba beans (Alonso 
et al., 1998), while in another study (Abd El-Hady and Habiba, 2003) no TI was 
detected in any of the tested legumes after extrusion processing no matter the initial 
quantity of the ANF in the raw seeds or the temperature applied. Complete inactivation 
of TI in the present study was only observed for wheat flour, even though no high 
temperatures were applied to this material. 
CHAPTER 3. EXTRUSION OF PEAS, CHICKPEAS & FABA BEANS 
3.4.2 Pellet physical characteristics 
Experimental diet pellets were not affected negatively by the addition of low or 
high levels of legumes with respect to hardness, settling velocity, water activity and 
pellet density. The pellets did not crumble in the sacks, while transferring or stored, 
however, a disadvantage of BH diets and to a lesser extent of CPH diets for both 
Experiments II and III was a small percentage of floating pellets that was not 
quantified. Pellet physical properties are dependent on the ingredients and the nutrient 
composition (Briggs et al., 1999; Thomas et al., 1998), on the pellet size (Chen et al., 
1999; Vassalo et al., 2006) on the processing techniques (Schwertner et al., 2007) as 
well as on carbohydrate binders such as cellulose (Hansen and Storebakken, 2007) and 
chitosan (Santos et al., 2002). 
Water activity values were within the safety limits (Schwertner et al., 2003) for all 
diets indicating that long storage even at room temperature is possible without 
microbial development and spoilage of the pellets. Although Schwertner et al. (2003) 
found a good correlation between water content and water activity comparing different 
pelleting methods, it is not necessary for this correlation to exist (Water activity, 2007). 
In the present research this fact is justified as no correlation between the two parameters 
was found. 
Settling velocity was obviously positively related to the density of the pellets. The 
pellets used in the Experiment I had higher average velocity (9.26cms-1) and density 
(1.12gcm3) than the values observed for diets of experiments II (7.41cms-1 and 
1.01gcm3) and III (8.55cms-1 and 1.06gcm3). Although bigger pellets are related to 
higher sinking rates (Chen et al., 1999; Vassallo et al. 2006), the small difference in 
pellet size was possibly less important than the density difference. Higher density levels 
CHAPTER 3. EXTRUSION OF PEAS, CHICKPEAS & FABA BEANS 
of pellets manufactured for Experiment I could be related most possibly to the high 
level of fishmeal included in this diet (51-59g100g-1) in comparison to the rest of the 
diets (25-28g100g-1) (Sorensen et al., in press). 
Concerning hardness, diets for Experiment I showed lower average values 
(12.30N) than diets for Experiment II (14.17N) and III (13.95N). Higher values were 
observed for H diets compared to L diets in both Experiments II and III. This could be 
related to the high inclusion levels of legumes and their carbohydrate properties as 
Sorensen et al., (in press) found increasing hardness when fishmeal was replaced by 
soybean meal. This result can be considered a positive effect on pellet quality as harder 
pellets are possibly also more durable (Sorensen et al., in press) and could be used in 
automatic feeders with less losses. 
3.5 Conclusions 
From this study it could be concluded that peas, chickpeas and faba beans are raw 
materials that could potentially be used in seabass and seabream diets without causing 
negative effects on the pellet physical characteristics. Levels up to 35g100g-1 of each 
legume are acceptable for producing pellets that could be manufactured, transported and 
stored. ANF in these materials are not prohibitive for their use in feeds, as total tannin 
levels are comparatively low compared to those known to affect fish growth 
performance (Francis et al., 2001), phytate problems could be possibly overcome by 
mineral supplementation (Porres et al., 2004) and trypsin inhibitors are significantly 
inactivated under extrusion. In vivo studies in the following chapters will provide more 
information about the use of peas, chickpeas and faba beans in seabass and seabream 
diets. 
Chapter 4. Experiment I - Effects of peas, chickpeas and faba 
beans on nutrient digestibility and gastrointestinal evacuation 
in European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) 
CHAPTER 4. LEGUMES & GASTROINTESTINAL EVACUATION IN SEABASS 
4.1 Introduction 
Wheat is an important source of carbohydrate in aquafeeds for Mediterranean 
species included at levels up to 200gkg-1 (Campbell, personal communication). Wheat 
starch is a good binder and is also considered a good source of energy (Hertrampf and 
Piedad-Pascal, 2000). However, recent expansion of global biofuel industries has led to 
increased demands for starch and sugar-rich feedstocks with consequent price increases 
for such crops (Runge and Senauer, 2007). Indeed, wheat is expected to undergo further 
price increases in the future (Runge and Senauer, 2007). Furthermore, limited European 
production of soybean (Grain legumes, 2006) and the general position of EU countries 
with respect to genetically modified soybeans reinforce the importance of plant sources 
other than soybean in aquafeeds (Euractiv, 2006).  
Legumes represent a significant constituent of global grain production (Grain 
legumes, 2007) and are highly valued feed components for both ruminants and 
monogastric livestock due to their relatively high protein and energy values compared 
to cereals (Peterson and Mackintosh, 1994). Several legumes, including field peas, 
chickpeas and faba beans, may be able to replace wheat carbohydrates since they are 
characterized by high carbohydrate content (Knudsen, 1997). Moreover, the protein 
content of legumes may enable partial replacement of fishmeal (Gouveia and Davies, 
1998), which has been consistently high in price over the last few years (Josupeit, 
2008). 
Many nutritional deficiencies in legumes (e.g. limiting levels of sulphur amino 
acids and tryptophan) can be overcome by the complementary use of cereal grains or 
the addition of low cost synthetic amino acids (Booth et al., 2001). Allan et al. (2000) 
have reported that cystine and glycine availability was relatively low in field peas and 
CHAPTER 4. LEGUMES & GASTROINTESTINAL EVACUATION IN SEABASS 
faba beans respectively, while limited availability of several amino acids was found in 
chickpeas in the same study. A further drawback to the use of legumes in fish diets is 
the presence of a variety of endogenous ANF including protein inhibitors, amylase 
inhibitor, phytic acid, tannins and lectins that adversely affect enzyme action or the 
absorption of minerals and other nutrients (Tacon, 1993). The indigestible carbohydrate 
content of plant ingredients has often been considered an ANF (Hilton et al., 1983). 
ANF in legume seeds can be partially or totally inactivated by heat processing methods 
such as roasting, autoclaving, extruding or cooking or by other processing methods such 
as soaking, germination or enzyme addition, prior to inclusion in fish feeds (Francis et 
al., 2001).  
Gelatinized wheat is known to be highly digestible by seabass (Peres and Oliva-
Teles, 2002), while legume starches are known to be digested at a slower rate in 
humans (Tharanathan and Mahadevamma, 2003). The rapidness of starch digestion can 
be reflected in the glucose loading in blood after each feeding (Hemre and Hansen, 
1998). The period needed for the fish to recover from glucose loading depends on the 
starch level and the water temperature (Hemre et al., 1995). However, the glucose curve 
of European seabass has only been investigated after glucose injection (Peres et al., 
1999), but not after feeding different starch sources. 
Gastrointestinal evacuation indicates the rate profile of the time needed for an 
animal to digest a meal and is affected by the physical and chemical composition of the 
diet (Jobling, 1987). Gastrointestinal evacuation rate has proven to be a very important 
parameter for modelling daily feed intake (Jobling, 1981) as it is partly responsible for 
control of appetite in fish (Riche et al., 2004). However, pelleted fish feeds have not 
been thoroughly investigated in farmed fish in this respect, since most of the pertinent 
literature deals with prey type feeds, either experimental or natural (Bromley, 1994; 
CHAPTER 4. LEGUMES & GASTROINTESTINAL EVACUATION IN SEABASS 
Andrade et al., 1996), feeding frequency (Ruggerone 1989; Zarate et al., 1999), 
restoration of appetite (Riche et al., 2004) and gastric modelling for prey feed (Salvanes 
et al., 1995; Andersen and Beyer, 2005). 
The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the effect of partial or total 
replacement of wheat by whole grain flours of field peas, chickpeas and faba beans, on 
diet digestibility and to determine gastrointestinal evacuation time for extruded diets 
containing these raw materials at 30% level fed to European seabass. 
4.2 Materials and methods 
4.2.1 Feed ingredients and feed formulation  
Chickpeas, field peas and faba beans were included in the experimental diets 
containing 15g100g-1 (CP15, P15 and B15) and 30g100g-1 (CP30, P30 and B30) of each 
legume plus a control diet as described in detail in section 3.2.3.1.  
4.2.2 Fish and experimental design 
Three hundred fish of initial weight 152.312.1g were transferred from a 
commercial farm (located in Epidavros, Greece) to the facilities of the laboratory of 
Fish Nutrition and Pathology, Institute of Aquaculture, Hellenic Centre for Marine 
Research in Athens. A total of 20 fish were stocked randomly into each one of the 15 
digestibility tanks (section 2.2.2.1) and acclimatized for two months being fed the 
experimental diets. Faeces were collected and processed as described in section 2.3.2. 
Seabass were fed daily to appetite, twice a day (9.00am and 16.00pm). Faecal samples 
were removed every morning prior to feeding for 8 days. 
CHAPTER 4. LEGUMES & GASTROINTESTINAL EVACUATION IN SEABASS 
4.2.3 Water quality 
Sea water was supplied continuously as described in section 2.2.2.3 Water 
temperature was controlled at 181C during the experimental period. 
4.2.4 Gastrointestinal evacuation 
Following the digestibility trials, high level diets were selected to be compared for 
gastrointestinal evacuation time to control diet as these diets expected to show stronger 
effects (control, CP30, B30 and P30). Fish were adapted to the diets for 2 weeks and 
tested in triplicate groups. Fish were fasted for 72h before being fed the experimental 
meal to make sure that the gastrointestinal tract was empty. Six fish per treatment were 
sacrificed at 0, 8, 16, 24, 32 and 48 h after feeding a single meal equal to 1% (diet wet 
weight) biomass, following phenoxyethanol/ethanol (1/1, 0.4mlL-1) induced anaesthesia 
(Ekmann, personal communication). The time intervals were selected based on test 
sampling and taking into account the low temperature as proposed by Finstad (2005). 
The method used was the serial slaughter technique. This method involves 
sacrificing fish at regular time intervals after they have been fed. Fishes were 
anaesthetized, blood samples were taken and then killed with a blow to the head and the 
digestive tract was carefully removed and separated into three parts: stomach, foregut 
and hindgut. Foregut was defined as the section from the pyloric sphincter to the 
ileocaecal valve and hindgut from the ileocaecal valve to the anus. The gut contents 
were removed and placed in pre-weighed tubes. Samples were freeze-dried and dry 
weights were used to estimate the gastric evacuation time (GET) in comparison to the 
BW of each fish. 
CHAPTER 4. LEGUMES & GASTROINTESTINAL EVACUATION IN SEABASS 
Geometric means of stomach and intestinal contents were regressed against time 
in order to examine possible fit to a model for calculating time and rate of gastric and 
intestinal evacuation.  
4.2.4.1 Stomach 
Data from all treatments best fitted an exponential model, in the case of stomach 
and gastric evacuation rates (GER) calculated using the formula described by Elliott 
(1972): 
Wt = A-rt 
Where Wt is the geometric mean weight of stomach dry digesta at time t, A is a 
parameter calculated from the formula of the regression and r is the rate of gastric 
evacuation. Data were plotted in a logarithmic form as 
LnWt = lnArt, 
The slope of r corresponding to GER was calculated. GET was calculated from the 
above equation as the time (t) necessary to empty 50%, 75% and 90% of the stomach 
content. 
4.2.4.2 Foregut 
Data for the foregut fitted a linear model. The time needed for the digesta to 
completely pass the foregut was estimated from the intercept on the x axis and the rate 
of evacuation by the slope of each equation. 
4.2.4.3 Hind gut 
Hind gut data best fitted a quadratic model. Points from each curve were estimated 
to determine the time of maximum intestinal content and evacuation time. 
CHAPTER 4. LEGUMES & GASTROINTESTINAL EVACUATION IN SEABASS 
4.2.5 Chemical analysis 
Proximate compositions of feeds, freeze-dried faeces, carcass and fillet were 
determined according to AOAC (1990). Faecal and feed samples were analyzed for 
starch, and faeces fat determined according to the phosphovanillin method (Nengas et 
al., 1995). Feeds were also analyzed for total and insoluble NSP (Englyst et al., 1994) 
and yttrium oxide (Refstie et al., 1997). Blood samples were centrifuged and plasma 
was analyzed for glucose (section 2.11.2). All chemical methods are described in detail 
in Chapter 2, General Materials and Methods. 
4.2.6 Calculation of digestibility coefficients 
ADCs for control and test diets were calculated according to the formulae 
described in section 2.14. Energy in diets and faeces was determined according to the 
formula of Blaxter (1989), also presented in section 2.14. 
4.2.7 Statistical analysis 
ADCs were analysed by one-way ANOVA using SPSS 13.0. Significant 
differences were evaluated using Tukey post-hoc test at a significance level of P0.05. 
Regressions were performed using the statistical program Statgraphics Plus 2.1. The 
linear fits and the comparison of slopes were tested at a significance level of P=0.05. 
4.3 Results 
4.3.1 Digestibility

4.3.2 Gastric evacuation 
GET was evaluated as the geometric mean of dry matter of feed per g of BW of 
each fish. The values observed immediately after feeding (0h) were lower than 1%BW 
partially because of the calculation of dry matter and partially because some sampled 
fish had eaten less than 1%. From the curves generated for each part of the 
gastrointestinal tract (Figure 4.1), the following exponential equations were determined: 
Control: y = 0.827 e0.13x, R2 = 0.98 
B30: y = 0.804 e-0.08x, R2 = 0.97 
CP30: y = 0.655 e-0.07x , R2 = 0.96 
P30: y = 0.938 e-0.12x, R2 = 0.95

CP30 and P30, while B30 showed a delay with glucose only start increasing after 8 
hours. After 24 hours, control, CP30 and P30 had a peak, while diet B30 had a peak 
value after 32 hours. Fish fed the control diet showed a rapid decrease of serum glucose 
at 32 hours in contrast to the rest of the fish fed the legume diets that had a smoother 
glucose decline (Figure 4.5). Standard deviations were, not unexpectedly, high and 
values were normally distributed but they were not homogenous. Transformations did 
not lead to homogeneity and thus no statistical analysis was applied.

CHAPTER 4. LEGUMES & GASTROINTESTINAL EVACUATION IN SEABASS 
4.4 Discussion 
In the present study all three legumes tested proved valuable as carbohydrate 
replacers at both inclusion levels tested in seabass as indicated by their ADCs. 
However, best values were observed for faba bean diets. Similar studies evaluating 
legumes for carbohydrate replacement in fish diets are very limited in the literature. 
Gouveia and Davies (1998) tested diets containing 20 and 40% field pea in European 
seabass and showed no differences for protein ADCs, but carbohydrate digestibility was 
significantly lower for the 40% substitution level. The differences in energy and 
carbohydrate digestibility of field pea diets between this and the present study can be 
attributed to different processing of the feeds used. Extrusion, as opposed to 
compressed pellet, was used in the present study, possibly resulting in enhanced 
carbohydrate digestibility and thus improved energy utilization. The same authors in a 
more recent study (Gouveia and Davies, 2000) tested extruded pea seed meal in diets 
for European seabass up to 30% and all nutrient ADCs did not differ for the different 
inclusion levels, while both protein and carbohydrate ADCs were higher than in their 
previous research (Gouveia and Davies, 1998). When pea seed meal was included at 
18% and substituted for wheat in Atlantic salmon extruded diets (Aslaksen et al., 2007) 
all nutrient digestibilities were lower compared to those found in the present study, 
while starch ADC decreased as opposed to the present findings. The same authors also 
evaluated 22% faba bean substitution for wheat and found similar values to the control 
ADC, contrary to decreased starch ADC, which disagrees with the current results. No 
similar studies appear to be available for chickpeas, with the exception of Booth et al. 
(2001) who investigated digestibility in Australian silver perch and found values of 88.1 
and 72.1% for protein and energy ADCs, respectively. 
CHAPTER 4. LEGUMES & GASTROINTESTINAL EVACUATION IN SEABASS 
There is little published information on how different starch sources influence 
utilization of other nutrients in the diet. It seems as though more easily digestible starch 
(gelatinized) cannot influence protein digestibility but can improve energy and starch 
digestibility (Peres and Oliva-Teles, 2002). 
According to Knudsen (2001), differences in starch digestibility among different 
diets are more likely to be due to the structure of the cell walls that enclose the starch 
granules, different amylase/amylopectin ratios, and the presence of -amylase inhibitors 
rather than to differences in digesta viscosity and intestinal fermentation activity. 
Taking into account the fact that amylase/amylopectin ratios vary widely among 
different plant species and among different varieties of the same species of cereals and 
legumes, it is not possible to relate this parameter to starch digestibility, since this ratio 
was not determined in the present study. In general wheat starch includes 20-30% 
amylose while legumes include 30-60% amylose and higher values of amylose can 
adversely affect starch digestibility (Hoover and Zhou, 2003). However, in the present 
study, higher starch ADC was observed for diets combining wheat and legume starch 
rather than the diets including only one type of starch. 
NSP in monogastric animals can delay intestinal absorption of glucose, possibly 
through a reduced rate of gastric emptying, leading to delayed absorption (Knudsen, 
2001). Furthermore, soluble dietary NSP can increase the viscosity of the stomach 
contents (Storebakken, 1985). In the current study, total, soluble and insoluble NSP did 
not play any significant role in starch digestibility, however, the diet with the higher 
inclusion level of total NSP (B30) showed the longest evacuation time for the gut and 
one of the highest values for starch digestibility. 
In most GER studies to date, the aim has been investigation of the nutritional 
habits of wild fish by creating specific models (Andersen and Beyer, 2005), comparing 
CHAPTER 4. LEGUMES & GASTROINTESTINAL EVACUATION IN SEABASS 
pelleted and prey feed (Andrade et al., 1996) or to investigate the effects of prey size 
(Santos and Jobling, 1991) and temperature (Finstad, 2005). The majority of these 
studies showed that the relationship between food remaining in the gastrointestinal tract 
and time can be described by a linear, square root or exponential equation (Bromley, 
1994). In the present study with seabass, the mathematical models giving best fit were 
found to be different for each part of the tract for the high level diets being exponential 
for the stomach, linear for the foregut and quadratic for the hindgut. Stomach curves 
followed the formula described by Elliott (1972) and supported by Persson (1986) as a 
model, fitting better for voluntary feeding. However, no comparable data are available 
for fore and hind gut models. 
High standard deviations were observed for the hindgut dry weight values in the 
present study, due to the small length of the hind gut, the low quantity of the sample 
obtained and increased mucus content present in this part of the intestine. Hindgut 
quadratic curves show that this part of the intestine accumulates the indigestible 
contents of foregut, reaches a maximum point and defecation starts or continues at a 
faster rate. Along with this observation no correlation was found between 
gastrointestinal evacuation time and digestibility of diet nutrient which is in agreement 
with the findings of Sveier et al. (1999). 
In evacuation rate studies, it is preferable to measure the meal size of each 
individual fish (Bromley, 1994). During communal feeding it is difficult to control the 
amount of feed eaten by individual fish, but the results can be less biased than when 
fish fed individually or forced fed (Bromley, 1994). For this reason the variance in 
initial stomach content is expected to be high (Jensen and Berg, 1993; Bromley, 1994). 
These initial variations in meal size are also reflected in the variations measured in the 
amount of feed retrieved from the different parts of the digestive tract. Such substantial 
CHAPTER 4. LEGUMES & GASTROINTESTINAL EVACUATION IN SEABASS 
variations were also determined in this study, but to avoid extreme values when a fish 
was overfed or under-fed it was rejected and immediately replaced by another during 
the sampling procedure. 
A single meal experimental protocol was followed in the present trial, as in most 
similar published GET experiments. Multiple meal experiments usually show that the 
second meal reduces the time of first meal evacuation and also increases the emptying 
time of the second meal (Elliott, 1975). In aquaculture the most common practice is 
feeding more than one meal per day. Hence, whilst the results presented here give a 
comparative evaluation among the different diets, absolute values would be different in 
multiple meal production processes. 
In practical terms, inclusion of legumes in diets for seabass clearly increased the 
GET of the feed with faba bean having the strongest effect. NSP inclusion level may 
have affected this delay (Knudsen, 2001), as indigestible particles of the feed are the 
last to remain in the stomach after the digestible part of the diet has been expelled and 
their evacuation is slow (Bromley, 1987). NSP could also have affected hindgut 
evacuation time. Different extruded starch sources of wheat and corn result in different 
GER for gilthead seabream (Venou et al., 2003). It is possible that the structure of the 
extruded starch molecules of the tested legumes could result in this delay. 
Legume starches promote slow and moderate postprandial glucose and insulin 
responses and result in lower glycaemic indexes in humans (Tharanathan and 
Mahadevamma, 2003), while fish seem to have a longer postprandial hyperglycaemia 
after carbohydrate intake (Brauge et al., 1994). Peres et al. (1999) in a glucose tolerance 
test of seabass at 22C found higher range between the lower and the higher value 
compared to the present study and a peak 3-6 hours after a glucose injection, while in a 
similar test with salmon at 2-3C (Hemre and Hansen, 1998) the peak was found 3 
CHAPTER 4. LEGUMES & GASTROINTESTINAL EVACUATION IN SEABASS 
hours after the injection. The present study was performed to evaluate the effect of 
different starch sources on the glycaemic curve and thus the results are not comparable 
to the pre-mentioned studies. The increase of evacuation time in the foregut could have 
also affected the glucose absorption rate. Diets control, CP30 and P30 evacuated 90% 
of the digesta after 32, 38 and 39 hours respectively and the glucose was rapidly 
reduced for the wheat-starch diet, while a delay in glucose reduction found for pea and 
chickpea starch diets. Fish fed diet B30 evacuated the digesta after 46 hours, showing at 
the same time a better glucose regulation with a lower peak in glucose curve and a 
strong possibility of correlation of these two facts. 
4.5 Conclusions 
In conclusion, all three legumes tested proved to have potential as feed ingredients 
for European seabass, mainly as carbohydrate replacers for wheat and to a lesser extent 
for protein substitution. Digestibility coefficients showed satisfactory values for all 
diets either including low or high levels of legumes. In addition starch digestibility was 
slightly improved for the diets that combined wheat and legume starch source. GET was 
significantly delayed by the inclusion of chickpeas, while foregut evacuation rate was 
reduced for all legume diets with faba beans showing the strongest effect. Glucose 
levels in seabass serum was also affected by the type of carbohydrates ingested with 
wheat starch showing more rapid increase and decrease of glucose compared to fish fed 
on pea and chickpea diets, while faba bean starch had a delay in glucose peak and a 
lower value as well.

faba beans included at two levels in European seabass 
(Dicentrarchus labrax) diets 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
5.1 Introduction 
Legumes are cultivated extensively representing a significant part of global grain 
production (Grain legumes, 2007) and are highly valued feed components for both 
ruminants and monogastric livestock due to their relatively high protein and energy 
values compared to cereals (Peterson and Mackintosh, 1994). Several legumes, 
including field peas, chickpeas and faba beans, are characterized by high carbohydrate 
content (Knudsen, 1997) and thus may potentially replace wheat carbohydrates in fish 
diets. The relatively high crude protein content of legumes may also enable partial 
replacement of protein rich ingredients such as fishmeal (Gouveia and Davies, 1998) or 
commonly used plant protein sources that could be very significant economically. 
Carbohydrates in feeds for farmed fish represent 10-40 percent of the total energy 
(Hemre et al., 2002) with wheat being one of the important carbohydrate sources. 
Wheat starch is a good binder and is also considered a good source of energy 
(Hertrampf and Piedad-Pascal, 2000). However, present high demand for starch and 
sugar-rich materials (fermentable carbohydrate) due to expansion of the biofuel industry 
has led to the price rises for these crops (Runge and Senauer, 2007) and for this reason 
wheat may suffer further price increases in future years (Runge and Senauer, 2007). 
Limited European production of soybean and the reaction of EU countries to genetically 
modified soybeans (Euractive, 2006), reinforces the importance of using plant sources, 
other than soybean, in aquafeeds. 
ANF such as protein inhibitors, amylase inhibitor, phytic acid, tannins and lectins 
adversely affect enzyme action or mineral and other nutrient absorption (Tacon, 1993), 
but they can partially or totally inactivated by heat processing (Francis et al., 2001). 
Furthermore, the indigestible carbohydrate content of plant ingredients has often been 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
considered to be an ANF (Hilton et al., 1983) that cannot be reduced or inactivated by 
heat processing. However, some I-NSP can be converted into the soluble form (Anguita 
et al., 2006) increasing digesta viscosity and changing the interaction between enzymes 
and digesta (Edwards et al., 1988), as well as the absorption rate (Johnson and Gee, 
1981). Legumes are deficient in sulphur amino acids (methionine and cystine) and 
tryptophan, but these deficiencies can be overcome by the complimentary use of cereal 
grains or the addition of low-cost synthetic amino acids (Booth et al., 2001). Cystine 
and glycine availability has been found to be low in field peas and faba beans, 
respectively, while limited availability of several amino acids was found in chickpeas 
(Allan et al., 2000). 
The influence of legume seeds as a carbohydrate source on fish blood parameters 
has received little attention. Glucose tolerance tests tend to show the relatively slow 
removal of carbohydrate from the plasma compartment (Shikata et al., 1994), however, 
glucose may be of primary importance as an oxidative substrate to some cells and 
tissues in fishes, with expected large inter-species variability (Hemre et al., 2002). 
Interesting differences exist in the effectiveness of different carbohydrates with respect 
to lipogenesis and protein sparing. In sturgeon, for instance, glucose and maltose are 
more lipogenic and can result in increased plasma triacylglycerols and cholesterol than 
carbohydrates such as fructose, sucrose, lactose, dextrin and starch or cellulose (Hung 
et al., 1989) 
There is some evidence that legumes, like soybean, can cause antigenic activity in 
mammals (Lalles, 1993) and in salmonids (Burrells et al., 1999), suggesting that there 
are mechanisms involving the immune system and substances present in soybean or 
peas (Esparza et al., 1996), however, these processes are complex and not yet clear. The 
hindgut of fish is sensitive to antigen stimulation and strong immune responses are 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
caused when antigens are delivered to this part of the digestive tract (Ellis, 1995). Thus, 
enteritis and immunological parameters seem to be related in rainbow trout (Rumsey et 
al., 1994). Histological changes have been found in this part of intestine in Atlantic 
salmon fed soybean meal (Baeverfjord and Krogdahl, 1996). 
Carbohydrate level in fish diets has been investigated in several species such as 
rainbow trout (Austreng et al., 1977; Bergot, 1979; Brauge et al., 1994; Krogdahl et al., 
2004), salmon (Arnesen et al., 1995; Krogdahl et al., 2004), tilapia (Wang et al., 2005) 
and European seabass (Perez et al., 1997; Lanari et al., 1999). Most of these studies link 
carbohydrate level to liver size (HSI), liver fat and liver glycogen, while Hemre and 
Hansen (1998) and some of the afore mentioned authors (Bergot, 1979; Arnesen et al., 
1995) also correlate these characteristics to the carbohydrate source. 
The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the effect of total replacement 
of wheat by whole grain flours of field peas, chickpeas and faba beans and the 
interactions of starch/legume level and legume type on diet digestibility, growth 
performance and organoleptic characteristics of European seabass and to evaluate blood 
serum indices and immunological factors as well as the histology of internal organs for 
European seabass. 
5.2 Materials and methods 
5.2.1 Feed ingredients and experimental diets 
Three different legumes including field peas, chickpeas and faba beans 
represented by P, CP and B respectively, were included in six practical type extruded 
diets containing approximately 17g100g-1 (L diets) or 35g100g-1 (H diets) of each 
legume plus the control diet as described in detail in section 3.2.3.2. 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
5.2.2 Fish and experimental design 
5.2.2.1 Digestibility 
Four hundred fish of initial weight 17611g were transferred from a commercial 
farm (located in Epidavros, Greece) and a total of 20 fish were stocked randomly in 
each digestibility tank (section 2.2.2) and acclimatized for two months, being fed the 
experimental diets. Digestibility trials were carried out in triplicate, seabass were fed to 
satiation, twice a day (9.00am and 16.00pm) and faeces were collected as described in 
section 2.2.2. Faecal samples were removed every morning for 8 days, immediately 
prior to feeding, and processed as described in section 2.3.2. 
5.2.2.2 Growth 
Seven hundred seabass of initial weight 97.94.8g were transferred from the same 
farm and randomly distributed into 21 cages of 1.5m3 as described in section 2.2.2. Fish 
were weighed at the start of the trial, mortalities were recorded and dead fish were 
removed, while fish were hand fed twice a day (9:00am and 16:00pm) to satiation. 
Growth experiment took place from August to November and lasted for 14 weeks.  
5.2.4 Sampling procedure 
At the beginning of the experiment fish were weighed and a sample of 6 fish were 
taken as representative of the initial population to determine whole body proximate 
composition. At the end of the 14-week trial fish were fasted for 40h and 8 fish per tank 
anaesthetized and blood samples taken prior to any other sampling procedure. Sampling 
procedure is described in section 2.3.3.  
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
5.2.5 Water quality 
The average temperature of the water was at 251C during the digestibility 
experimental period (June and July) and 17.3-28C during the growth period with an 
average temperature of 23.4C, as temperatures below 20C were recorded only in the 
last week of the experiment. Water quality is described in section 2.2.2.3 
5.2.6 Chemical analysis 
Proximate analysis, faecal fat, starch, yttrium oxide, liver fat, liver glycogen, 
serum glucose, total protein, triacylglycerols, cholesterol and chemiluminescence were 
also determined. All chemical methods are described in detail in General Materials and 
Methods. 
5.2.7 Calculation of nutritional parameters 
Growth parameters, ADCs, FCR, SGR, PPV and HSI formulae are presented in 
section 2.14. 
5.2.8 Histology 
Liver, spleen, kidneys and intestine (foregut and hindgut) were dissected from 
three fish per cage. Tissue samples were treated as described in section 2.12. 
5.2.9 Sensory analysis 
A total of 3 fish per cage (18 fillets) being fed control and H diets were harvested,

stickiness and general acceptance from 0 to 5 in a ranking test. The training of assessors 
and the design of the test were performed according to the general quantitative 
descriptive analysis from Murray et al. (2001). 
5.2.10 Statistical analysis 
All data are presented as meansSD (n=3) and were analysed by one-way or two-
way ANOVA as described in section 2.15. Chemiluminescence results were evaluated 
by One-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and Homogeneity of Variances tested with 
the Levene test. Pearson correlation in SPSS 13.0 was used to evaluate any significant 
(P<0.01 and P<0.05) positive or negative correlation among fat metabolism parameters 
and among fillet characteristics 
5.3 Results 
5.3.1 Digestibility and blood serum  
5.3.1.1 Digestibility one-way ANOVA 
High digestibility values were recorded for all diets (Table 5.1). However, 
significant differences were detected after one-way ANOVA between control and L 
diets, due to low standard deviations. ADCs for protein ranged from 93.3-95.5%, for fat 
from 96.197.9%, for starch from 97.6-99.1% and for energy from 94.7-96.8%. The 
wheat based control diet showed the highest and peas the lowest ADC values. 
Significant decreases were noted (compared to the control) for protein digestibility in 
PL and CPL, for fat in diet PL, for starch in diets BL and PL and for energy in diets 
CPL and PL. ANOVA was also applied for comparison of all seven diets indicating 
increase of protein and energy ADCs for all H diets compared to CPL and PL, but not 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
to control diet, while fat ADC was significantly lower for PL diet. Starch digestibility 
was significantly increased for H when compared to diet PL. 
5.3.1.2 Digestibility two-way ANOVA 
Two-way ANOVA applied between L and H diets revealed significant interaction 
for all ADCs and therefore main effects were not examined and the simple main effects 
(the effect of one parameter at a given level of the other) were analysed. 
Protein ADC ranged from 93.395.3%. A significant interaction of inclusion level 
and legume type was observed (Figure 5.1a) showing that inclusion level significantly 
affected P and CP diets with H diets giving increased protein ADC compared to the 
respective L diets. Regarding the effect of inclusion level in L diets, significant increase 
was noted for diet BL compared to CPL and PL. 
Fat ADC ranged from 96.197.9% and a significant interaction of inclusion level 
and legume type was observed (Figure 5.1b). Specifically, for H diets BH increased fat 
ADC compared to CPH and for L diets PL showed decreased values compared to BL 
and CPL. Regarding legume type, diet PL resulted in lower fat ADC compared to PH. 
Starch ADC ranged from 97.4-98.8% and a significant interaction of inclusion 
level and legume type was observed and therefore the simple main effects were 
analysed (Figure 5.1c) showing that inclusion level significantly affected CP diets with 
CPL giving increased values. Regarding the inclusion level effect in L diets, CPL 
significantly increased starch ADC compared to BL and PL, while in H diets PH 
decreased compared to BH. 
Energy ADC ranged from 94.796.6% and a significant interaction of inclusion 
level and legume type was observed (Figure 5.2d). In L diets, diet P showed 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
significantly lower energy ADC compared to B and CP. Comparing the legume level 
PH showed significantly higher energy ADC than PL. 
5.3.1.3 Serum one-way ANOVA 
One-way ANOVA showed that fish fed the wheat-based control diet did not differ 
in any of the tested serum parameters compared to fish fed L diets. 
Specifically, blood serum glucose showed significantly elevated values in seabass 
fed diet CPH, followed by diet BH, while all other treatments resulted in lower values 
compared to both of these (Table 5.2). Cholesterol levels were significantly higher for 
diet CPH only when compared to diet BH, while total protein and triacylglycerol levels 
did not show any significant difference among experimental groups. 
5.3.1.4 Serum two-way ANOVA 
Two-way ANOVA among L and H diets revealed significant overall effects and 
interactions for serum glucose and cholesterol and simple main effects were examined.  
Serum glucose ranged from 3.6310.79mmoldl-1 40 hours after feeding. A 
significant interaction of inclusion level and legume type was observed and therefore 
the simple main effects were analysed (Figure 5.2a), showing that inclusion level 
significantly affected CP diets with CPH giving significantly increased glucose values. 
Regarding the effect of inclusion level in H diets, PH exhibited significantly reduced 
glucose compared to BH and BH compared to CPH. 
Serum protein ranged from 5.957.28gdl-1 and significant effects were observed 
only for inclusion level (Figure 5.2b). Specifically, fish fed H diets had higher serum 
protein levels than fish fed L diets. 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
Serum cholesterol ranged from 10.2013.32mmoldl-1 and significant effects were 
observed only for legume type, showing that B diets significantly decreased cholesterol 
levels compared to CP and P diets (Figure 5.2d). 
Serum triacylglycerols ranged from 2.793.90mmoldl-1 and did not show any 
significant differences among the examined parameters (Figure 5.2c).

5.3.2 Growth and liver characteristics 
5.3.2.1 Growth one-way ANOVA 
Satisfactory growth was observed for all diets (Table 5.3) and significant 
differences for only SGR were detected by one-way ANOVA between the control and 
L diets. FCR ranged from 1.241.34, SGR from 0.861.00 and PPV from 0.270.30. 
Significant improvement was noted in SGR only for fish fed diet CPL. Regarding liver 
characteristics, glycogen values ranged from 9.310.3%, total lipids from 28.432.7% 
and HSI from 2.32.7%BW. Significantly decreased HSI was observed in fish fed L 
diets compared to the control. ANOVA was also applied among all seven diets 
indicating that fish fed diet CPL had significantly improved FCR than CPH and 
improved SGR when compared to CPH and control. Total liver fat was significantly 
lower for fish fed diet PH compared to BL, while diets CPH and PH resulted in higher 
HSI than the rest of the diets. 
5.3.2.2 Growth two-way ANOVA 
Two-way ANOVA among L and H diets revealed significant overall effects and 
interactions for some of the growth parameters and simple main effects were examined. 
For FCR a significant interaction of inclusion level and legume type was observed 
and therefore the simple main effects were analysed (Figure 5.3a), showing that 
inclusion level significantly affected fish fed the P and CP diets with H diets giving 
increased FCRs. Regarding the effect of inclusion level in L diets, significant 
improvement (in this case reduction) was noted for fish fed diets CPL and PL compared 
to diet BL. 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
SGR ranged from 0.871.00 and significant interaction of inclusion level and 
legume type was observed and therefore the simple main effects were analysed (Figure 
5.3b), showing that inclusion level significantly affected fish fed CP diets with a high 
level adversely affecting growth rate. With respect to the effect of inclusion level, no 
significant effect was noted among H or L diets 
PPV ranged from 0.270.30 and a significant effect of legume type was shown 
from two-way ANOVA (5.3c), but no significant effect of inclusion level or interaction. 
Specifically, both diets containing CP significantly improved PPV compared to diets 
containing B.  
Liver glycogen ranged from 9.411.5% and significant effects were observed only 
for inclusion level with H diets resulting in higher glycogen levels than L diets (Figure 
5.4a). 
Liver fat ranged from 25.232.7% and significant effects were observed again 
only for inclusion level (Figure 5.4b). Particularly, BL and PL resulted in lower liver fat 
values than BH and PH diets respectively. 
HSI ranged from 2.32.9%BW and significant effects of inclusion level and 
legume type were shown from two-way ANOVA (Figure 5.4c), but no interaction was 
noted. Specifically, when H diets were fed fish showed increased HSI and among the 
three legume types lower values were observed for fish fed the B diets compared to CP 
and P. 
A strong positive correlation (P<0.01) was found between glycogen and HSI, 
while a negative correlation was observed for glycogen and liver fat. A significant 
(P<0.01) negative correlation was also noted for serum glucose with HSI and carcass fat 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
(P<0.05). No other correlations were found among HSI, liver fat, blood serum 
cholesterol, triacylglycerols, glucose and carcass fat content (Table 5.4).

5.3.3 Carcass and fillet 
5.3.3.1 Carcass 
One-way ANOVA was applied among control and L diets to examine the effects 
of wheat substitution by legumes on carcass composition (Table 5.5). In this respect 
fish fed diet CPL showed significantly reduced moisture and increased lipid content, 
while carcass protein content was not affected by the carbohydrate source. ANOVA 
among all seven diets showed significantly elevated moisture and decreasing carcass fat 
for fish fed diet BH compared to diets PH, control and CPL, while significantly higher 
protein for fish fed diet CPH found but only against diet BL. 
Two-way ANOVA among L and H diets revealed significant overall effects and 
interactions for carcass composition values and simple main effects were examined. 
Carcass ash values were not homogenous as revealed from Levenes test and no tested 
transformation led to homogeneity and therefore this parameter was not examined. 
Carcass moisture content ranged from 59.962.9%. A significant interaction of 
inclusion level and legume type was observed and therefore the simple main effects 
were analysed (Figure 5.5a), showing that inclusion level significantly affected the B 
diets with H diets giving increased moisture content. Regarding the effect of inclusion 
level in L diets, significant reduction was noted for CPL compared to BL and PL and 
for H diets significant reduction was noted for PH compared to BH. 
Carcass protein ranged from 15.7-16.5% and significant effects were observed 
only for inclusion level (Figure 5.5b). Specifically, fish fed H diets had higher protein 
contents than fish fed L diets. 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
Carcass fat ranged from 16.9-20.4% and a significant interaction of inclusion level 
and legume type was observed and therefore the simple main effects were analysed 
(Figure 5.5c), showing that inclusion level significantly affected B and CP diets with L 
diets giving significantly increased fat content. Regarding the effect of legume type 
significantly less fat was measured in fish fed PL compared to CPL, and BH compared 
to PH. 
5.3.3.2 Fillet 
Seabass fillet characteristics were satisfactory for all measured diets. One-way 
ANOVA was applied for comparison of fillet characteristics among control and H diets 
although no further results could be revealed from this analysis (Table 5.6). Fillet ash 
values were not homogenous as revealed from Levenes test and no tested 
transformation led to homogeneity and therefore this parameter was not examined. 
Fillet moisture ranged from 72.973.8% and was significantly higher for fish fed 
diet BH only compared to the control, while protein ranged from 19.720.3% and was 
significantly higher for control compared to diet PH and finally ash content ranged from 
1.31.6%. Fillet yield ranged from 41.044.2%BW and the percentages of fillet muscle 
(35.438.1%BW) were significantly greater for fish fed diet PH, although the flesh 
protein content for this fillet was the lowest.  
According to Pearson correlation, nitrogen deposition had a strong positive 
correlation (P<0.01), while protein had a strong negative correlation with fillet yield.

5.3.5 Immunology  
None of the fish groups fed the diets tested showed significant evidence of either 
immunosuppression or immunostimulation (Figure 5.7) compared to control fish. 
However, diet BH resulted in significantly lower blood chemiluminescence than diet 
BL. There was also a tendency for immunosuppression of chemiluminescence by CPH, 
however this was not significant. Peas have a tendency to immunostimulate as judged 
by blood chemiluminescence at both inclusion levels even if not statistically significant.

5.4 Discussion 
In the present study all three legumes proved valuable carbohydrate replacers at 
both inclusion levels in seabass as indicated by their ADCs, growth indices, carcass 
composition, fillet yield and sensory analysis, taking also into account the low fishmeal 
inclusion level of the diets. Tested diets gave satisfactory digestibility coefficients and 
with respect to growth performance, PPV showed no differences among treatments, 
while FCR and SGR showed improved values for diet CPL and reduced for the control. 
5.4.1 Digestibility 
Objectively, digestibility values obtained in this study were all very high, while 
when compared to respective values in experiment I (92.9 vs. 94.2% for protein, 96.2 
vs. 97.7 for fat, 92.3 vs. 97.0% for starch and 94.2 vs. 96.0% for energy) the values 
were slightly increased, despite the fact that in Experiment I diets included almost 
double fishmeal than the diets of Experiment II and the same procedures were followed 
in both experiments. The increase of digestibility might be attributable to possible 
leaching resulting from the high plant meal content of the tested diets in the present 
study that resulted in a more liquid form of faeces (Hung et al., 1990) or to a higher 
enzyme activity at higher temperatures (18 vs. 25C) as proved in vitro for seabass 
(Papoutsoglou and Lyndon, 2005). However, Moreira et al. (2008) found an increase 
only in starch ADC for seabass fed at 25C when compared to 18C. Nevertheless, two-
way ANOVA among diets L and H revealed significant differences for inclusion level, 
for legume type and for interaction of the two parameters, but the control diet resulted 
in higher overall values. 
Similar studies evaluating legumes for carbohydrate replacement in fish diets are 
very limited in the literature. In particular Gouveia and Davies (1998) fed diets 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
containing 0, 20 and 40g100g-1 field pea meal to European seabass and showed no 
differences for protein (88-89%) and lipid (92-94%) ADCs, but the respective values 
for carbohydrate (71, 65 and 57%). and energy (78, 73 and 72%) for the high 
replacement level were significantly lower than the control. The ADC values of pea 
diets tested in the present study were higher than those reported by Gouveia and Davies 
(1998), most probably due to different processing procedures of the feeds (extrusion vs 
pelleted). This view is supported by the fact that the same authors in a more recent 
study (Gouveia and Davies, 2000) evaluated extruded pea seed meal for the same 
species at up to 30% and all nutrient ADCs were higher than in their previous work 
(Gouveia and Davies, 1998) approaching the values of the present study. Gouveia and 
Davies (2000) showed no differences for all nutrient ADCs at all inclusion levels, in 
contrast to the present study where diet PH showed improved protein digestibility and 
both pea diets showed reduced starch ADC compared to the control diet. When pea 
seed meal was included at 18g100g-1 and substituted for wheat in Atlantic salmon 
extruded diets (Aslaksen et al., 2007) all nutrient ADCs were lower (85, 50, 91 for 
protein, starch and fat) compared to those found in the present study, but all followed 
the same trends. In the same work, diets including whole faba bean (22g100g-1) for 
wheat replacement showed protein ADC (84%) similar to the control (85%), and 
decreased starch ADC (50 vs 55%), which agrees with the current results. For 
chickpeas no similar studies are available but some information exists on their 
digestibility in other farmed species (Booth et al., 2001). Protein and energy ADCs of 
chickpeas (30% in the diet) have been estimated in Australian silver perch to be 88.1 
and 72.1% respectively (Booth et al., 2001). 
Increasing starch levels have been noted to decrease starch and to increase protein 
and energy ADC (Brauge et al., 1994) in rainbow trout diets, while juvenile seabass fed 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
diets including 10, 20 or 30% of gelatinized starch showed decreased protein, starch 
and energy ADCs at the highest starch level (Moreira et al., 2008). However, these 
findings agree only for CP diets in the present study, although lower starch levels were 
included. It is a paradox that all L level diets resulted in lowered ADCs and yet fish fed 
these diets showed improved growth parameters. This could be explained by the 
consistently high ADC values recorded, the low numerical differences, and to the 
extremely small standard deviations obtained within treatments (that lead to statistically 
significant differences). It is also important to note that greater differences were found 
for protein ADCs and although most of the growth parameters showed the opposite 
trend, protein utilization was higher for the H diets. 
5.4.2 Growth 
The growth and feed utilization parameters recorded for diets tested in this work 
were consistent with those reported elsewhere for European seabass. Legumes are 
commonly used for fishmeal protein substitution in the form of concentrated proteins or 
in combination with other plant protein sources (Gomes et al., 1995a), but there are 
very limited studies on wheat substitution. No significant differences were noted in all 
growth parameters when juvenile European seabass were fed pelleted diets containing 
20 and 40g100g-1 of pea seed meal (Gouveia and Davies, 1998), which agrees with the 
current results for both high and low pea seed meal diets. Furthermore, protein 
efficiency ratio (PER) and nitrogen deposition and utilization were improved with 
increasing levels of pea seed meal in extruded diets, when FCR and SGR values did not 
differ significantly (Gouveia and Davies, 2000), while in the present research no 
differences were noted for any of these values. Thiessen et al. (2003) carried out a study 
replacing wheat meal with dehulled field pea meal (25g100g-1) in rainbow trout diets 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
and demonstrated that, although SGR, FCR and PER were improved, they did not differ 
significantly when compared to the control diet, this is also in accordance with the 
present findings for diet PL. For faba beans and chickpeas no relevant growth studies 
are available, but in the present research SGR and FCR were significantly different only 
between CP diets with improved values for CPL, while the rest of the diets did not 
differ significantly. Overall, diet CPL resulted in higher performances, with the most 
improved SGR and FCR values, while the lowest respective values were noted for diets 
CPH and the control. L diets showed improved weight gain, FCR, SGR and FI 
indicating that substitution of wheat by any of the tested legumes at a 17g100g-1 
inclusion level could probably affect growth parameters of seabass, probably due to the 
different carbohydrates included in legumes compared to cereals. 
However, when faba beans and chickpeas were included at a 35g100g-1 level, FCR 
and SGR were adversely affected, compared to the respective low legume diet, however 
only significantly for CP. Difference in plant protein and carbohydrate sources included 
in the control diet did not lead to significant differences in all afore mentioned 
parameters, however, values were slightly increased for the legume diets, apart from the 
FCR value for diet CPH, but this could be expected as different carbohydrate sources 
have been noted to have various effects. Specifically, different carbohydrate sources 
affected FCR values but not SGR in salmon (Hemre and Hansen, 1998) and effects on 
growth performance in rainbow trout were also found by Bergot (1979). This leads to 
the conclusion that peas, chickpeas and faba beans are very good replacers of wheat and 
partially of soy or sunflower protein and it is possible that the tested high-starch 
legumes may offer better starch and protein sources than the commonly used materials 
(especially wheat and soybean). However, more research with longer period trials 
should be done in this area to generate definitive conclusions. 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
5.4.3 Carcass and fillet composition, HSI, liver glycogen, liver fat 
In the current study European seabass showed no negative effects on carcass 
proximate composition of either low (PL) or high (PH) field pea containing diets when 
compared to the control. Pea seed meal was successfully included in diets of juveniles 
of the same species with equivalent results (Gouveia and Davies, 1998; Gouveia and 
Davies, 2000). Pereira and Oliva-Teles (2002) carried out evaluation of growth 
parameters of gilthead seabream fed two differently processed pea seed meals at similar 
inclusion levels to those in the present study. The same authors demonstrated that no 
significant differences occurred in carcass proximate composition and HSI for gilthead 
seabream. For seabass in this study carcass composition also did not differ between 
control and pea diets, however, HSI was significantly higher than the control for PH 
and significantly lower for PL. Higher carcass protein values observed for diet CPH, 
but this was significantly lower only against diet BL. Results on carcass fat regarding 
dietary carbohydrate level are controversial as salmon showed decreasing values of fat 
with increasing carbohydrate levels (Refstie and Austreng, 1981), while Wang et al. 
(2005) found the opposite in tilapia diets, but these results could be species related, as 
these two species have very different capacity to utilize carbohydrates. Carcass fat was 
significantly higher for diets CPL and BL compared to CPH and BH respectively that is 
in agreement with Refstie and Austreng (1981) in rainbow trout that reduced carcass fat 
with elevating levels of carbohydrates. 
High-inclusion diets were chosen to be compared with the control diet for fillet 
yield and organoleptic characteristics, as the diets that were more likely to show 
differences against the control. Fillet yield was higher for diet PH, followed by CPH, 
BH and lowest for the control diet. This could be attributed to the higher carbohydrate 
content of H diets compared to the control (Lanari et al., 1999), but this should be 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
clarified by further research. Pearson correlation showed that protein level of fillet 
muscle had a strong negative correlation, with fillet yield.  
Increased but not significant values were found for liver glycogen in H compared 
to L diets, most probably due to the increase in digestible starch (Kim and Kaushik, 
1992). High glycogen contents associated with increasing carbohydrate levels have 
been noted by several authors in salmon (Refstie and Austreng, 1981; Arnesen et al., 
1995), tilapia (Wang et al., 2005), rainbow trout (Austreng et al., 1977; Bergot 1979) 
and seabass (Moreira et al., 2008). HSI values showed the same trend as glycogen 
deposition, but this time the differences were significant and agreed with other studies 
in trout (Kim and Kaushik, 1992), in silver perch (Stone et al., 2003), tilapia (Wang et 
al., 2005) and seabass (Moreira et al., 2008), but not in salmon (Arnesen et al., 1995). A 
strong correlation was also found between HSI and liver glycogen content and this is in 
agreement with the results published for several other species (Hemre et al., 2002), 
while increased glycogen deposition seemed to induce enlargement of liver (Stone et 
al., 2003). Liver fat content has been associated with high carbohydrate contents in diets 
for seabass by Lanari et al. (1999) but this fact was not confirmed in this research with 
all H diets resulting in lower liver fat content than L diets, but this difference could be 
explained by the lower inclusion levels of starch in the present study for the respective 
values of low and high levels. 
5.4.4 Sensory analysis 
Different carbohydrate sources in salmon feeds (Young et al., 2006) were noted to 
cause no impact on flesh quality, however organoleptic characteristics were not 
evaluated in that study. The similar levels of fishmeal and fish oil included in the tested 
diets could be the reason that no significant differences were noted for the organoleptic 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
characteristics of the fillets observed from seabass fed control and H diets as the 
fishmeal (Kaushik et al., 1995) as the source of fat (Waagbo et al., 1993) in the diet 
play a determinative role on sensory characteristics. 
5.4.5 Haematological parameters 
Measurements on serum in seabass, not unexpectedly, resulted in high ranges of 
the observed values within the same experimental groups. In contrast to mammals, fish 
have proved to be glucose resistant (Mommsen and Plisetskaya, 1991) and most 
teleost fishes have wide limits of glucose levels not only between species but also 
within species at different life stages or under certain feeding regimes (Hemre et al., 
2002). Serum analysis has been investigated partially in some species aiming to study 
effects of certain ingredients in fish diets. For instance Hung et al. (1989) found that 
different carbohydrate sources could affect total cholesterol and triacylglycerols levels 
in blood plasma when included in sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) diets. However, 
not much information exists about the influence of legume seeds in fish as a wheat 
replacer in all four blood serum parameters measured in the present research. 
Stone et al. (2003) found that raw pea starch at a 30g100g-1 level did not affect 
plasma glucose in Australian silver perch 3 hours after feeding, compared to different 
carbohydrate sources at the same percentage and the same was found for salmon when 
fed oat and maize meals as carbohydrate sources (Arnesen et al., 1995). In the present 
study 40 hours after feeding no differences were found for pea diets, although extruded, 
however, chickpeas at high dietary levels significantly increased glucose compared to 
the control diet, implying a positive effect of starch level on glucose serum values. 
Arnesen et al. (1995) also found a significant positive correlation between plasma 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
glucose and liver glycogen, but in the present study this correlation was positive, 
although not significant. 
Total serum protein did not vary much among diet treatments, probably due to the 
same fishmeal and total protein inclusion level of the diets and this is in agreement with 
Hemre and Hansen (1998) who found no effect on this parameter with different 
carbohydrate sources. Starch level does not seem to play an important role either. 
Triacylglycerols did not show any differences among the experimental groups 
however all diets showed a decreasing trend, excluding diet CPL, that was similar to the 
control levels. Similarly, levels of triacylglycerols were not affected by the 
carbohydrate source in salmon (Hemre and Hansen, 1998) 
In both mammals and humans, different plant constituents have been reported to 
lower plasma cholesterol levels (Wester, 2000), but this effect seems to be related to the 
NSP content of the plant materials (Levrat et al., 1996; Favier et al., 1997). Cholesterol 
was higher for diet CPH and lower for diet BH, but no other significant differences 
were found. Both faba bean diets showed a decreasing trend that could be related to the 
effect of this ingredient. It is also important to note that no correlation was found among 
serum cholesterol, triacylglycerols and HSI, liver and carcass fat content and none 
between liver glycogen and the inclusion level of NSP (total NSP, I-NSP or S-NSP). 
5.4.6 Immunology 
Occurrence of certain legume ANF has been associated with immunological 
disturbances in mice fed diets including legumes (Macarulla et al., 1992; Martinez et 
al., 1992; Esparza et al., 1996) and in salmon (Krogdahl et al., 2000) and rainbow trout 
(Burrells et al., 1999) fed with soybean meal diets. No similar reports are available for 
the legumes tested in the present study or in European seabass. Experimental diets 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
included soybean meal at 16 or 8g100g-1 in L and H diets respectively and these 
combinations could act either in a synergistic or antagonistic manner in low level diets. 
Faba bean diets showed immunosuppressive tendencies at the high inclusion level (BH) 
and immunostimulatory effects at the low level (BL), however all the other diets did not 
show any significant differences, but further study is needed to confirm these results. 
5.4.7 Histology 
It might be expected that diets containing both soy and tested legumes (in L diets) 
might induce histopathological changes compared to the control diet. However, 
increased numbers, abnormal size and arrangement of absorptive vacuoles were found 
only in the distal intestine of fish fed the control diet and to a lesser extent diet PH. 
Findings in control diet may be due to the 16g100g-1 soybean inclusion level while 
sunflower and corn gluten may not contribute to these effects, as they have been proven 
not to cause histological abnormalities in Atlantic salmon (Aslaksen et al., 2007). The 
fact that L diets did not show any changes could be attributed to a possible antagonistic 
effect of some plant ingredients with problem agents of soy. Diet PH induced increased 
number of absorptive vacuoles that could be related to whole pea seed meal ANF, 
however, these hypotheses requires further investigation. For L diets findings are in 
agreement with (Aslaksen et al., 2007) who did not observe histological abnormalities 
in Atlantic salmon fed diets including 18 and 22g100g-1 of peas and faba beans 
respectively, while (Sitja-Bobadilla et al., 2005) found histological changes in gilthead 
seabream only when they were fed diets containing 100% plant proteins. 
CHAPTER 5. BEANS, CHICKPEAS & PEAS IN SEABASS DIETS 
5.5 Conclusions 
The inclusion of any of the three legumes up to 17% in seabass diets proved to be 
beneficial in terms of growth with chickpea diet giving the best growth values, but also 
higher carcass fat content. Fish fed on diets including 35% of legumes showed 
decreasing growth trends compared to control and 17% inclusion level diets. However, 
the differences should be investigated in longer term experiments. In pathological 
terms, enteritis was not induced in any of the fish groups and only high inclusion of pea 
seed meal caused an increased number of absorptive vacuoles in hindgut. No sensory 
differences were found among steam cooked fillets of seabass fed either the control or 
the high legume level diets. 
Chapter 6. Experiment III - Effects of peas, chickpeas and 
faba beans included at two levels in gilthead seabream 
(Sparus aurata) diets  
CHAPTER 6. BEANS, CHICKPEAS AND PEAS IN SEABREAM DIETS 
6.1 Introduction 
Aquaculture production of gilthead seabream in Mediterranean countries is still 
rising with Greece being the leading producer at almost 50,000t in 2006 (Aquamedia, 
2008). As already mentioned in the General Introduction gilthead seabream farming 
is considered a very important sector for the local economy (FAO, 2008b). Use of 
locally available feed ingredients from terrestrial agricultural production in the region 
could directly contribute to the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of fish farming in 
Greece. In this respect cultivation of legumes, as appropriate for Mediterranean-type 
climates (Sulas, 2005), could be encouraged if proven to give satisfactory 
performance in seabream diets. In addition the faba beans used in the present study 
are legumes produced in high quantities in EU countries (Figure 1.4) and considered 
of high nutritional value. 
The total capacity of fishfeed companies in Greece, presently nine plants, is 
between 250,000300,000mt, whilst the national requirements are 200,000mt. The 
most common ingredients used in aquafeeds in Greece are mostly imported with only 
approximately 5% being derived from local agricultural production, including wheat 
and glutens (Alexis, personal communication, EPAN report 2008). 
Over the last five years there has been a gradual, or in some cases rapid, rise in 
the prices of all ingredients used in the livestock feeds with a parallel increase in the 
cost of feeds and in turn in livestock production (Beek, 2007). Alternative and 
sustainable ingredients must therefore be evaluated as potential solutions to the 
sustainable development of the aquaculture industry. The prices of wheat for the last 
three years greatly varied: the prices (/t) are presented in ascending order in Table 
CHAPTER 6. BEANS, CHICKPEAS AND PEAS IN SEABREAM DIETS 
6.1 with the required respective prices of the tested legumes for a least cost diet 
included up to 35g100g-1 (Karacostas, personal communication).

Calculations are based on BioMars commercial product (44/19, 4.5mm) for seabream and for

Plant materials are the most promising alternative ingredients and indeed locally 
produced materials are already used in most of the European countries that have 
developed aquaculture, such as Norway, Denmark, Scotland, France and Spain 
(FEAP, 2008). The most important exception is soybean that is very commonly used 
but production in the EU is very limited (Grain legumes, 2006). In addition, legumes 
such as peas and especially chickpeas can be produced with more environmental 
friendly cultivation techniques as they do not have high demands for water (Bhardwaj 
et al., 1999), they can be cultivated in sandy soil, and they do not need nitrogen 
fertilization if nodulated (Oplinger et al., 1990). Furthermore, such cultivation could 
help the poor and arid areas of Greece to develop through agricultural production. On 
the other hand faba beans are commonly produced in most European countries 
(Schneider, 2002) and could potentially partially or totally replace soybean meal. 
CHAPTER 6. BEANS, CHICKPEAS AND PEAS IN SEABREAM DIETS 
Therefore, this study had a dual role; firstly to investigate the effects of different 
starch sources in seabream diets and secondly to estimate the performance of fish fed 
diets including high levels of Greek varieties of peas and chickpeas or faba beans 
produced in the EU in place of imported plant sources like soybean and sunflower 
meal. Specifically, the effect of total replacement of wheat by whole grain flours of 
field peas, chickpeas and faba beans and the interactions of starch level and legume 
type on growth performance were evaluated alongside haematological serum indices 
and histology of internal organs in gilthead seabream. 
The present research was complementary to the project Utilization of pulses 
and carob seed germ meal as feed constituents of seabass and seabream, funded by 
the European Union (Community Support Framework 2000-2006, Operational 
Programme Competitiveness) and carried out by The Hellenic Centre for Marine 
Research, BioMar Hellenic, Selonda and National Agricultural Research Foundation 
(N.AG.RE.F.).  
6.2 Materials and methods 
6.2.1 Feed ingredients and experimental diets 
Three different legumes including field peas, chickpeas and faba beans 
represented by P, CP and B respectively, were included in experimental diets. Six, 
practical type extruded diets were formulated containing approximately 17g100g-1 (L 
diets) or 35g100g-1 (H diets) of each legume plus the control diet as described in 
detail in section 3.2.3.3.  
CHAPTER 6. BEANS, CHICKPEAS AND PEAS IN SEABREAM DIETS 
6.2.2 Fish and experimental design 
Seven hundred seabream of initial weight 92.65.0g were transferred from a 
Selonda farm (in Karistos, Evia) and randomly distributed into 21 cages as described 
in section 2.2.2. Fish were weighed at the start of the trial, mortalities were recorded 
and dead fish were removed. Fish were hand fed twice a day (9:00am and 16:00pm) a 
total of 1.5g100g-1 BW. 
Before the experiment parasites were detected and fish were treated in low 
salinity water for 6 days. In the 6th week of the experiment a new outbreak of 
parasites stressed the fish and they required treatment with copper sulphate for 15 
days, at a daily dose of 0.8ppm under flowing water. During this period fish were fed 
normally, but their appetite was obviously reduced, especially for the first 5 days of 
treatment. Mortalities were recorded and dead fish were weighed. 
6.2.3 Sampling procedure 
At the beginning of the experiment fish were weighed and a sample of 6 fish 
were taken as representative of the initial population to determine whole body 
proximate composition. At the end of the 13-week trial fish were fasted for 40h and 8 
fish per tank anaesthetized and blood samples taken prior to any other sampling 
procedure. Sampling procedure is described in section 2.3.3. 
6.2.4 Water quality 
Average water temperature ranged from 21-28C during the growth period 
(May-August) with an average temperature of 25C. Water quality is described in 
section 2.2.2.3.  
CHAPTER 6. BEANS, CHICKPEAS AND PEAS IN SEABREAM DIETS 
6.2.5 Chemical analysis 
Proximate analysis, liver fat, liver glycogen, serum glucose, total protein, 
triacylglycerols, cholesterol and chemiluminescence were determined. All chemical 
methods are described in detail in General Materials and Methods. 
6.2.6 Calculation of nutritional parameters 
Growth parameters, FCR, SGR, PPV, VSI and HIS formulae are presented in 
section 2.14. 
6.2.7 Histology 
Liver, spleen, kidneys and intestine (foregut and hindgut) were dissected from 
three fish per cage. Tissue samples were treated as described in section 2.12. 
6.2.8 Statistical analysis 
All data are presented as meansSD (n=3) and were analysed by one-way or 
two-way ANOVA as described in section 2.15. Pearson correlation in SPSS 13.0 was 
used to evaluate any significant (P<0.01 or P<0.05) positive or negative correlation 
among fat metabolism parameters. 
6.3 Results 
6.3.1 Growth 
6.3.1.1 Growth one-way ANOVA 
Growth for all diets was lower than expected most probably due to the parasite 
infection during the experiment and only for FCR significant differences were 
CHAPTER 6. BEANS, CHICKPEAS AND PEAS IN SEABREAM DIETS 
detected by one-way ANOVA between control and L diets. FCR ranged from 1.58
1.79, SGR from 0.840.92, PPV from 0.180.25 and VSI from 6.48.1%. Significant 
improvement was noted in FCR only for fish fed the control diet when compared to 
fish fed diets PL, PH or BH, while SGR was better for control diet but it did not differ 
from any of the diets. Regarding liver characteristics, glycogen values ranged from 
6.910.7%, total lipids from 8.713.2% and HSI from 1.01.2%. Decreased but not 
significant values for HSI were observed in fish fed L diets compared to the control, 
while glycogen decreased significantly for fish fed diet CPL when control and L diets 
were compared. ANOVA also applied for all seven diets showing that PH diet 
resulted in high liver glycogen when compared to CPL and BL (Table 6.2). 
6.3.1.2 Growth two-way ANOVA 
Two-way ANOVA among L and H diets revealed significant interactions 
between legume type and inclusion level only for liver fat content, while significant 
overall effects were found for some of the growth parameters and simple main effects 
or main effects were examined where required. 
For FCR (1.68-1.78), SGR (0.84-0.87), VSI (6.7-8.1%) and HIS (1.0-1.3%) no 
significant differences occurred for inclusion level and legume type or their 
interaction showing that none of the parameters examined were affected by diet type. 
PPV ranged from 0.180.25 and a significant effect of legume type and 
inclusion level was shown from two-way ANOVA. Specifically, fish fed P diets had 
lower PPV than fish fed CP diets and L diets showed higher PPV values when 
compared to respective H diet values. 
Liver glycogen ranged from 6.910.7% and significant effects were observed for 
inclusion level and legume but not for their interaction, showing that fish fed the H 
CHAPTER 6. BEANS, CHICKPEAS AND PEAS IN SEABREAM DIETS 
diets had higher liver glycogen levels than fish fed L diets and P diets giving higher 
values than CP and B diets (Figure 6.1a) 
Liver fat ranged from 9.513.2% and a significant interaction of inclusion level 
and legume type was observed and therefore simple main effects were analysed 
(Figure 6.1b). For H diets diet BH showed significantly lower liver fat than CPH and 
PH and for L diets, CPL showed significantly higher liver fat. Regarding legume type 
no differences were found between L and H diets in pairs.

6.3.2 Serum 
6.3.2.1 Serum one-way ANOVA 
One-way ANOVA showed that fish fed the wheat-based control diet had lower 
serum glucose than all the L diets, but significantly lower only against diet PL. 
Triacylglycerol levels were lower for control and CPL and significantly lower than PL 
and PL compared to BL, while serum cholesterol and protein did not show significant 
differences between control and L diets groups (Table 6.3). 
One-way ANOVA for all diets of blood serum glucose showed that control diet 
was significantly different only from diet PL that gave the highest glucose values. PL 
revealed the highest value also after comparing means of all diets, while CPH showed 
the lowest serum glucose. Triacylglycerol levels were significantly lower for fish fed 
diet CPL when compared to PL and BL and when all mean values were compared CPL 
and BH showed significantly lower values than BL, PL and CPH. Cholesterol levels 
were significantly lower for diets PH and BH compared to the rest of the diets and total 
protein levels did not show any significant differences among experimental groups. 
6.3.2.2 Serum two-way ANOVA 
Two-way ANOVA among L and H diets revealed significant overall effects and 
interactions for serum glucose, triacylglycerols and cholesterol and simple main effects 
were examined.  
Serum glucose ranged from 4.97.7mmoldl-1. A significant interaction of 
inclusion level and legume type was observed and therefore simple main effects were 
analysed (Figure 6.2a). Inclusion level significantly affected P and CP diets with PH 
CHAPTER 6. BEANS, CHICKPEAS AND PEAS IN SEABREAM DIETS 
and CPH giving significantly lower glucose values compared to PL and CPL 
respectively. Regarding the effect of inclusion level in L diets, PL exhibited 
significantly increased glucose values compared to BL and CPL, while for H diets PH 
showed significantly increased values than BH and CPH. 
Serum protein ranged from 5.66.9gdl-1 and significant effects were observed only 
for legume type (Figure 6.2b). Specifically, fish fed H diets had lower serum protein 
levels than fish fed L diets, but for P diets this was not the case. 
Serum triacylglycerols ranged from 2.84.5mmoldl-1 and significant interaction of 
inclusion level and legume type was observed. Inclusion level significantly affected all 
legume type diets with BL and PL giving significantly increased triacylglycerol values 
compared to BH and PH respectively and CPL lower values than CPH. Regarding the 
effect of inclusion level in H diets, BH exhibited significantly reduced triacylglycerols 
compared to PH and diet PH compared to CPH, while for L diets CPL showed 
significantly reduced values than PL and PL compared to BL (Figure 6.2c). 
Serum cholesterol ranged from 5.89.5mmoldl-1 and significant interaction of 
inclusion level and legume type was observed. Inclusion level significantly affected B 
and P diets with BL and PL giving significantly increased cholesterol values compared 
to BH and PH respectively. Regarding the effect of inclusion level in H diets CPH 
exhibited significantly increased values compared to BH and PH, while for L diets PL 
showed increased values only compared to diets CPL and BL (Figure 6.2d).

6.3.3 Carcass composition 
6.3.3.1 Carcass one-way ANOVA 
One-way ANOVA was applied among control and L diets to examine the effects 
of wheat substitution by legumes on carcass composition of seabream (Table 6.4). In 
this respect fish fed diet BL showed significantly reduced fat lipid content than fish fed 
diets control and PL, while carcass moisture, protein and ash content were not affected 
by carbohydrate source. When the same analysis was applied to all values only carcass 
protein levels revealed differences with BH and PH giving higher values only against 
diet BL. 
6.3.3.2 Carcass two-way ANOVA 
Two-way ANOVA among L and H diets revealed significant overall effects and 
interactions for carcass ash and protein values and simple main effects were examined.  
Carcass moisture content ranged from 62.864.0% and carcass fat from 14.3-
15.9% and no significant effects found for these parameters. 
Carcass protein ranged from 15.717.7% and a significant interaction of inclusion 
level and legume type was observed and therefore the simple main effects were 
analysed (Figure 6.1c). Specifically, regarding legume level for fish fed L diets, BL had 
lower protein contents than fish fed diet CPL, while for legume type fish fed diet BH 
had significantly higher protein carcass content than BL. 
Carcass ash ranged from 3.13.9% and a significant interaction of inclusion level 
and legume type was observed (Figure 6.1b). Legume type significantly affected B diets 
with BL diets giving significantly increased ash content than BH. 
CHAPTER 6. BEANS, CHICKPEAS AND PEAS IN SEABREAM DIETS 
A significant positive correlation (P<0.01) was found between cholesterol and 
triacylglycerol levels Table 6.5 and a negative correlation (P<0.01) between liver fat 
and serum glucose, between I-NSP and liver fat and between S-NSP and serum 
triacylglycerol levels.

6.4 Discussion 
6.4.1 Growth 
According to the experimental results seabream growth was not negatively 
affected by wheat substitution by legumes and the high inclusion level of peas, 
chickpeas or faba beans in the diets. Chickpea diets showed the best performances when 
fed to the fish with similar values to the control diet and this could be an indication that 
ANF in chickpeas had lower effects on the fish in relation to growth size. 
Growth performance was not improved by wheat substitution by legumes, either 
by the high inclusion level of legumes. However, none of the P diets significantly 
affected growth rates which is in agreement with Gouveia and Davies (1998; 2000) who 
found that in juvenile European seabass SGR values were not affected when fish were 
fed pelleted diets containing 20 and 40g100g-1 of raw or 10-30g100g-1 extruded pea 
seed meal compared to a wheat and fishmeal-based control diet. In the latter study 
Gouveia and Davies (2000) found that PER values, nitrogen deposition and utilization 
were improved with increasing levels of pea seed meal in extruded diets, while for 
seabream in the present study no differences were found for this parameter. In rainbow 
trout, when wheat meal was replaced with dehulled field pea meal (25g100g-1) although 
SGR, FCR and PER values were improved, they did not differ significantly when 
compared to a control diet (Thiessen et al., 2003). The results of the current trial 
showed a significant negative effect on seabream FCR values for both P diets that is not 
in agreement with any of the previously mentioned studies. Differences of fat inclusion 
level of the diets or the parasitic infection and treatment in the present experiment could 
possibly have affected these results. 
CHAPTER 6. BEANS, CHICKPEAS AND PEAS IN SEABREAM DIETS 
For faba beans and chickpeas no relevant growth studies are available, but in this 
research FCR was not significantly different for diets CPL, CPH and BL compared to 
the control, while a high level of faba beans adversely affected feed conversion ratio. 
Overall, CP diets resulted in higher performances among legume diets, with the most 
improved SGR and FCR values, while lower values were noted for P diets and BH. 
Interactions between legume type and level of starch/legume were not found for any of 
the growth parameters. It is interesting to note that both CP diets showed increased PPV 
values, however this improvement was significant only against diet PH. 
Substitution of wheat as a carbohydrate source in L diets did not affect SGR or 
PPV values, but it had a negative effect on FCR when fish were fed pea seed meal. 
Different carbohydrate sources also affected FCR values but not SGR in salmon 
(Hemre and Hansen, 1998), and growth performance in rainbow trout (Bergot, 1979). 
In diets including high levels of legumes, recipes were formulated with the 
intention of them being of lower cost. At the same time they employed materials 
commonly used in BioMars commercial seabream diets and thus there is a more 
complicated combination of plant proteins. However inclusion of 35g100g-1 of the 
tested ingredients as the main starch source in the diet can give very useful information. 
In this respect the high starch level of any of the legumes did not affect negatively 
growth performance of seabream, but the high level of faba bean and peas adversely 
affected FCR.  
6.4.2 Carcass composition, HSI, liver glycogen, liver fat  
Gilthead seabream in the current study showed no negative effects on carcass 
proximate composition of either low (PL) or high (PH) field pea containing diets when 
compared to the control. Processed pea seed meals at similar inclusion levels as in the 
CHAPTER 6. BEANS, CHICKPEAS AND PEAS IN SEABREAM DIETS 
present study were tested in gilthead seabream diets (Pereira and Oliva-Teles, 2002) 
and the authors demonstrated that no significant differences occurred in carcass 
proximate composition and HSI. This is in agreement with the results of the present 
study that showed no differences in carcass composition or HSI between control and 
pea diets. Equivalent results were also found for seabass juveniles fed pea seed meal 
diets (Gouveia and Davies, 1998; Gouveia and Davies, 2000). Higher carcass protein 
values observed for diets BH and PH compared to BL and PL respectively, however, 
significance was found only for faba bean diets. Carcass fat did not differ between high 
and low starch diets in contrast to the results of Refstie and Austreng (1981) that 
showed decreasing fat values with increasing carbohydrate levels and Wang et al. 
(2005) and Moreira et al. (2008) who found the opposite for tilapia and juvenile seabass 
diets respectively. Wang et al. (2005) did not find any differences in carcass 
composition between diets including 6 or 14% starch, but only compared to the higher 
starch levels, while Moreira et al. (2008) found increasing carcass fat with increasing 
starch level (10 vs. 20 and 30%). These results could be either species related or most 
possibly could be attributed to the higher inclusion levels of carbohydrates included 
compared to the diets of the current study.  
Increased values were found for liver glycogen in H compared to L diets, but these 
were significant only for CP diets, most probably due to the digestible starch increase 
(Kim and Kaushik, 1992). Elevated carbohydrate inclusion level in diets has also been 
shown to increase liver glycogen in salmon (Refstie and Austreng, 1981; Arnesen, et 
al., 1995), tilapia (Wang, et al., 2005), rainbow trout (Austreng et al., 1977; Bergot, 
1979) and seabass (Moreira et al., 2008). HSI values did not show any significant 
difference among treatments in seabream as also has been found for salmon (Arnesen et 
al., 1995) for different carbohydrate levels, but this is in contrast to work of other 
CHAPTER 6. BEANS, CHICKPEAS AND PEAS IN SEABREAM DIETS 
authors. Specifically, significant differences in HSI were found in trout (Kim and 
Kaushik, 1992), silver perch (Stone et al., 2003), tilapia (Wang et al., 2005) and seabass 
(Moreira et al., 2008). No correlation was found between HSI and liver glycogen 
content, which is in contrast to results published for several other species (Hemre et al., 
2002). Whilst increased glycogen deposition seems to induce liver enlargement (Stone 
et al., 2003) this was not shown here. Lanari et al. (1999) associated liver fat content 
with high carbohydrate inclusion in diets for seabass, but this was not supported by the 
present research either. This might be explained by the lower starch inclusion levels in 
the present study. 
6.4.3 Haematological parameters 
Hemre et al. (2002) in their review of carbohydrates in fish nutrition concluded 
that most teleost fishes have wide limits of glucose levels that could be attributed to 
differences among species or different life stages of the same species and it could also 
be feed related. Serum glucose values revealed a significant interaction between starch 
inclusion level and legume type included in tested diets showing that glucose levels in 
seabream could be affected both by the level and the type of starch. Chickpeas and peas 
resulted in decreasing values when included at high levels, while faba bean starch did 
not show any differences. Diet PL significantly increased glucose in serum compared to 
the wheat based diet, as well as CPL and beans when included at a high level. In 
contrast, raw pea starch at a 30g100g-1 level was found not to affect plasma glucose in 
Australian silver perch (Stone et al., 2003) compared to different carbohydrate sources 
at the same percentage, and the same was found for salmon fed oat and maize meals as 
carbohydrate sources (Arnesen et al., 1995). However glucose levels for pea starch 
were measured 3h after feeding and such values are not comparable to present values 
CHAPTER 6. BEANS, CHICKPEAS AND PEAS IN SEABREAM DIETS 
measured 40h after last feeding. Moreira et al. (2008) found no differences in plasma 
glucose 6 hours after feeding seabass with 10, 20 or 30% of gelatinized starch in 25C. 
Cholesterol levels in blood plasma have been related to NSP content of plant 
materials (Levrat et al., 1996; Favier et al., 1997) in diets for both mammals or humans 
and are associated with lower plasma cholesterol levels (Wester, 2000). Hung et al. 
(1989) found that different carbohydrate sources could affect differently lipogenic 
activity, total cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels in blood plasma when included in 
sturgeon diets. Cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels in the current experiment were 
reduced with increasing levels of B and P, while wheat starch showed similar results 
with BL and CPL for cholesterol and lower values for triacylglycerols. The results are 
not in agreement with Hemre and Hansen (1998) who found no effect of carbohydrate 
source on these parameters. Furthermore, no correlation was found among serum 
cholesterol, triacylglycerols and HSI, liver and carcass fat content and neither between 
liver glycogen and NSP inclusion level. This was not unexpected due to the low 
differences in NSP contents of the present diets. 
6.4.4 Immunology 
Immunological studies in fish related to dietary legumes are scarce in the 
literature. Esparza et al. (1996) found that mice fed diets including legumes showed 
immunological responses ascribed to the ANF present in the diets. Soybean meal has 
been shown to cause immune system disturbances in both salmon (Krogdahl et al., 
2000) and trout (Burrells et al., 1999). However, in seabream or for the legumes tested 
in the present study no data are available. It is possible that the diets containing the 
higher levels of ANF showed lowest growth and immunostimulatory evidence, but most 
of the values did not show significant differences and therefore further trials are 
CHAPTER 6. BEANS, CHICKPEAS AND PEAS IN SEABREAM DIETS 
required for firm conclusions. Nevertheless, according to the present values, chickpeas 
were more appropriate as a wheat replacer for seabream diets than peas and faba beans.  
6.4.5 Histology 
High levels of soybean in the diets have been implicated in inducing abnormalities 
of hind gut in salmon (Baeverfjord and Krogdahl, 1996; Refstie et al., 2000; Aslaksen 
et al. 2007) and rainbow trout (Refstie et al., 2000), whereas there is some evidence that 
peas and faba beans (in 18 and 22g100g-1 respectively) in salmon diets do not cause 
histological abnormalities (Aslaksen et al., 2007). In this respect histological findings 
could be expected for other legumes or/and other fish species. Gilthead seabream seem 
to be resistant when exposed to plant materials as histological changes were only found 
when fish were fed diets containing 100% plant proteins (Sitja-Bobadilla et al., 2005). 
Results of the present study confirm this fact because no pathological effects were 
found in hindgut. The rest of the organs examined had a normal form, but in kidney 
tissue some melanomacrophage centres were found for all treatments, that could be 
either normal or attributed to the parasite infection (Ferguson, 2006) during the 
experiment. 
6.5 Conclusions 
None of the legume diets improved growth performance of seabream, compared to 
the control diet, however, the differences observed were not significant for growth 
parameters. Among the legume diets, CPL could be considered as the most efficient 
because of the higher PPV value. Carcass fat was affected by the carbohydrate source, 
with the faba bean diet resulting in reduced fat content. Liver glycogen was increased 
with increasing starch levels, but HSI was not affected. Enteritis was not induced in 
seabream fed diets including low or high levels of legumes. 
Chapter 7. General Discussion and Conclusions 
CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
7.1 General 
The present study aimed to investigate grain legumes, namely peas, chickpeas and 
faba beans, as potential feed ingredients in extruded diets for European seabass and 
gilthead seabream as these are the most important aquaculture species for 
Mediterranean countries. Each legume was processed and analyzed before inclusion in 
diets at up to 35% as both an energy source replacing wheat and as a protein source 
partially replacing various protein sources in each experiment. Specifically, in Chapter 
3 the effects of different processing conditions were examined on the whole seed flours 
of tested ingredients. Nutritional and ANF of legumes and physical characteristics of 
experimental diet pellets including high and low levels of each legume were evaluated. 
In Experiment I the effects of wheat substitution by legumes were investigated on 
nutrient digestibility, gastrointestinal evacuation rate and serum glucose response in 
European seabass. In Experiment II growth, digestibility, haematological parameters, 
histological effects and fillet organoleptic characteristics as well as the interaction 
between starch inclusion level (low and high) and legume type were evaluated when 
tested legumes replaced wheat in European seabass diets. Lastly, in Experiment III 
growth, haematological parameters, histological effects and the interaction between 
starch inclusion level (low and high) and legume type were evaluated when tested 
legumes replaced wheat in gilthead seabream diets. 
7.2 Nutrient digestibility 
Nutrient digestibility was satisfactory for all diets at both 18C (Experiment I) and 
25C (Experiment II), including either low or high legume levels and/or low or high 
starch levels. At low temperatures absolute digestibility values were lower than those 
observed at higher temperatures. However, fishmeal inclusion level was higher 
CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
(doubled) and plant inclusion lower in Experiment I. Temperature differences may 
explain digestibility differences as digestive enzymes are more efficient at 25C than at 
18C (Papoutsoglou and Lyndon, 2005). In addition, digestibility evaluation in juvenile 
seabass at 25C and 18C showed increased starch but not protein and energy ADCs at 
the higher temperature (Moreira et al., 2008). Lower water temperature could also 
reduce feed intake and thus the endogenous gut losses can represent a greater 
proportion of the faecal waste resulting in a decrease of ADCs (Bureau et al., 2002), but 
this hypothesis requires further investigation. Combination of wheat and legume starch 
at low temperatures improved starch digestibility. An improvement in protein and 
starch digestibility was determined as GET increased indicating a possible positive 
effect of longer feed passage time on nutrient absorption.  
7.3 Gastrointestinal evacuation time 
Gastrointestinal evacuation rate has proven to be a very important parameter for 
modelling daily feed intake (Jobling, 1981) as it controls fish appetite (Riche et al., 
2004). Inclusion of legumes in diets for seabass clearly increased GET of feed with faba 
bean having the strongest effect. This might be attributed to higher NSP inclusion level 
(Knudsen, 2001) as indigestible particles of feed are the last to remain in the stomach 
after the digestible part of the diet has been expelled and their evacuation is slow 
(Bromley, 1987). Different extruded starch sources, wheat and corn, resulted in 
different GER for gilthead seabream (Venou et al., 2003). It is possible that the 
structure of the extruded starch molecules of the tested legumes could result in this 
delay. 
CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
7.4 Seabass and seabream growth 
In general, the results of the present dissertation showed a better response of 
seabass compared to seabream to legumes in the diets. Seabass showed improved 
growth performance when fed low level compared to the control, while seabream 
showed an overall decreased, although not significantly, for all diets tested. Among 
legume diets, chickpeas at a low level were the most efficient with increased SGR 
values in seabass and PPV in seabream indicating a better protein sparing effect of 
chickpea starch. Growth parameters interactions between starch levels and legume type 
were only found for seabass, while seabream was not affected by starch level or legume 
starch type. A negative effect was found in high level diets for seabass but this was 
significant only for chickpea. 
7.5 Seabass and seabream carcass proximate composition 
European seabass and gilthead seabream in experiments II and III showed no 
negative effects on carcass proximate composition of either low (PL) or high (PH) field 
pea containing diets when compared to the control. Pea seed meal was successfully 
included in diets for juveniles seabass (Gouveia and Davies, 1998; Gouveia and Davies, 
2000) and gilthead seabream (Pereira and Oliva-Teles, 2002) with equivalent results. In 
particular seabass and seabream showed higher carcass protein when fed diet CPH, 
however, this was only significant for seabass, while seabream significantly increased 
carcass protein with increased faba bean level. Carcass fat was not affected by diet for 
seabream, but seabass showed significantly reduced carcass total lipid with increasing 
bean and chickpea starch (BH, CPH).  
CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
7.6 Seabass and seabream liver characteristics 
Liver fat and HSI values were all higher for seabass than seabream, while 
glycogen level did not differ much. Liver glycogen levels were affected by starch level 
for both species, with higher starch levels resulting in higher glycogen concentration, 
although significance was found only for seabream. Increasing carbohydrate levels have 
been also associated with high glycogen contents in rainbow trout (Austreng et al., 
1977; Bergot, 1979), salmon (Refstie and Austreng 1981; Arnesen et al., 1995), tilapia 
(Wang et al., 2005), and seabass (Moreira et al., 2008). 
Seabass showed increased HSI for high starch level diets and a strong correlation 
between HSI and glycogen levels, while seabream did not show any differences among 
treatments and no correlation between HSI and liver glycogen. Correlation between 
these characteristics has been found also for other species as reviewed in Hemre et al. 
(2002). Extended glycogen deposition seems to induce liver enlargement (Stone et al., 
2003), while Arnesen et al. (1995) did not find significant differences in HSI of salmon 
fed different levels of carbohydrates. 
A significant interaction was found for seabream (BH lower than CPH, PH and 
CPL higher than PL, BL) liver fat but not for seabass. Liver fat was not affected by diet 
treatment for seabass and seabream when comparison was between H and L diets in 
legume pairs (PL vs. PH, CPL vs. CPH and BL vs. BH). Lanari et. al. (1999) found that 
liver fat content is associated with high carbohydrate contents in diets for seabass but 
this was not supported by any of the present experiments. Seabass H diets resulted in 
lower liver fat content than L diets, however, this difference could be explained by the 
lower inclusion levels of starch in the present study. 
CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
7.7 Seabass and seabream haematological characteristics 
Different carbohydrate sources have been proven to affect differently lipogenic 
activity in white sturgeon (Hung et al., 1989) that is in agreement with the present 
study. Lipogenic activity differences reflecting on cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels 
seabass and seabream serum were found. Cholesterol levels decreased when both 
species fed high faba bean levels Triacylglycerols decreased for BH and PH only for 
seabream, while seabream showed no differences for any of the dietary treatments. 
Glucose values were contradictory for the two species and the different legumes. 
Significant interactions for glucose were observed for seabream, with increasing 
glucose levels when fish were fed pea seed meal and L diets (excluding faba beans). 
Significant interactions for glucose levels were observed as well for seabass, with 
ascending glucose levels for PH, BH and CPH.  
7.8 Immunology and histology 
7.8.1 Immunology 
Measurement of chemiluminescence as an immunological parameter did not show 
systematic disturbance with the use of legumes in seabass and seabream diets. 
However, faba bean diets showed an immunosuppressive tendency in seabass at the 
high inclusion level (BH). In seabream high chickpea level (CPH) had an 
immunosuppressing effect, while PH and BH showed imunostimulating effects. 
Inclusion of legume such as soybean in diets has been associated with immunological 
disturbances in both salmon (Krogdahl et al., 2000) and trout (Burrells et al., 1999). 
CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
7.8.2 Histology 
Faba beans, chickpeas and peas did not cause enteritis in seabass or seabream 
hindgut when fed at low or high inclusion level in the diets. However, absorptive 
vacuoles were seen in increased quantities. Abnormal size and arrangement of vacuoles 
were found only in the distal intestine of seabass fed the control diet and to a lesser 
extent diet PH. Findings for the control diet could be attributed to the 17g100g-1 
soybean inclusion level, while in seabream none of the tested diets caused any 
pathological effects in hindgut. High levels of soybean in the diets have been implicated 
in inducing hind gut abnormalities in salmon (Baeverfjord and Krogdahl, 1996; Refstie 
et al., 2000; Aslaksen et al., 2007) and rainbow trout (Refstie et al., 2000), whereas 
there is some evidence that peas and faba beans (in 18 and 22g100g-1 respectively) in 
salmon diets do not cause histological abnormalities (Aslaksen et al., 2007). The results 
of the present study also confirm the findings of Sitja-Bobadilla et al. (2005) that 
gilthead seabream is tolerant when fed diets including plant materials up to 75% 
without causing histological changes.  
7.9 General conclusions 
The results of Chapter 3, suggest that: 
 extrusion processing could improve the nutritional value of the ingredients by 
significant reduction of TI. 
 Phytate was not eliminated by extrusion, but problems caused by phytate could be 
possibly overcome by mineral supplementation (Porres et al., 2004). 
CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
 Total tannin levels were not affected by extrusion, but their levels in legumes were 
comparatively low compared to those known to affect fish growth performance 
(Francis et al., 2001) 
 Peas, chickpeas and faba beans are raw materials that could be used in seabass and 
seabream diets without causing negative effects on pellet physical characteristics. 
 Levels up to 35g100g-1 of each legume are acceptable for producing pellets that 
could be manufactured, transferred and stored.  
The results of Experiment I, suggest that: 
 All three legumes tested proved to have potential as feed ingredients for European 
seabass, mainly as carbohydrate replacers for wheat.  
 Digestibility coefficients showed satisfactory values for all diets either including 
low or high levels of legumes.  
 Starch digestibility was slightly improved for the diets that combined wheat and 
legume starch source.  
 GET was significantly delayed by the inclusion of chickpeas,  
 Foregut evacuation rate was reduced for all legume diets with faba beans showing 
the strongest effect.  
 Glucose levels in seabass serum was also affected by the type of carbohydrates 
ingested with wheat starch showing more rapid increase and decrease of glucose 
CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
compared to fish fed pea and chickpea diets, while faba bean starch resulted in a 
lower glucose peak.  
The results of Experiment II, suggest that: 
 The inclusion of any of the three legumes up to 17% in seabass diets proved to be 
beneficial in terms of growth with chickpea diet giving the best growth values, but 
also the higher carcass fat content.  
 Fish fed diets including 35% legumes showed decreasing growth trends compared 
to diets including 17% legumes. 
 Partial substitution of commonly used plant proteins by the tested legume proteins 
was beneficial for seabass growth performance. 
 In pathological terms, enteritis was not induced to any of fish groups and only high 
inclusion of pea seed meal caused increased numbers of absorptive vacuoles in 
hindgut.  
 Organoleptic characteristics did not differ among steam cooked fillets of seabass fed 
either control or high legume level diets. 
The results of Experiment III, suggest that: 
 None of the legume diets improved growth performance of seabream, compared to 
the control diet. However, the differences observed were not significant for growth 
parameters, result that could have been also affected by the parasitic infection 
during the trial.  
CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
 Among the legume diets, CPL could be considered as the most efficient because of 
the higher PPV value.  
 Carcass fat was affected by the carbohydrate source, with the faba bean diet 
resulting in reduced fat content.  
 Liver glycogen was increased with increasing starch levels, but HSI was not 
affected.  
 Enteritis was not induced in seabream fed diets including low or high levels of 
legumes. 
The results of Experiments II and III, suggest that: 
 In conclusion, all three legumes tested had better potential as feed ingredients for 
European seabass than for gilthead seabream, mainly as carbohydrate replacers for 
wheat and to a lesser extent for protein substitution. Further research is required to 
include growth trials to fully evaluate the nutritional value of these ingredients in 
practical diets for these species. 
7.10 Future perspectives 
Legumes like faba beans, chickpeas and field peas are valuable potential sources 
of both protein and starch for European seabass and gilthead seabream feeds. In this 
respect these three legumes offer flexibility to the feed manufacturer as they can 
partially replace both energy (cereals like wheat that are also used as binding agents) 
and protein (such as soybean or other plant and animal protein) (Fraser, 2005). All these 
crops are cultivated in Mediterranean countries as well as in the rest Europe. This could 
CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
be an advantage with a positive effect on the final price of the product due to 
minimization of transport costs, and also in development of agricultural production with 
vertical integration between seed and fish feed production.  
Environmental protection is also of current interest and these legumes could 
contribute to this. Cultivations of legumes can decrease nitrogen pollution through their 
ability to naturally fertilize poor fields that for years have been cultivated with cereals, 
and can also increase total yields through rotation (Grain legumes, 2006). 
Further research is required to fully evaluate nutritional benefits or drawbacks. 
Specifically: 
 Long term experiments using faba beans, chickpeas and peas at low and high 
temperatures in farm cages could give safe information for the inclusion level of 
these legumes in practice. Small differences observed in the present study could be 
more clear after a whole growth period in intensive conditions 
 Concentrated proteins of peas, chickpeas, and faba beans possibly have a good 
potential to replace soybean protein. Air classification is a cheap and easy method to 
produce concentrated proteins of plant grains. 
 Dehulled or pre-extruded legumes or bio-ethanol byproducts of these legumes could 
also be tested in diets for seabass and seabream for their effects on digestibility and 
growth performance 
 Although much research has been conducted on carbohydrates in fish nutrition, 
there are also many things that are still not clear about metabolism, interactions with 
CHAPTER 7. GENERAL DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS 
other materials and the specific effects of ANF on nutritional performance. 
Measurement of carbohydrate fractions and in vitro starch and protein digestibility 
of raw and extruded legumes could be also investigated to give further information 
for these materials.  
 Evaluation of digesta viscosity in the intestine and digestive enzyme or microbe 
activity in each part of the intestine after feeding could also give valuable 
information about carbohydrate metabolism in these two species.
