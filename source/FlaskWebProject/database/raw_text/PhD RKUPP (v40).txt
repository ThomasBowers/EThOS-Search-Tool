SUMMARY. 
Molecular Mechanisms of C11orf95 translocations in cancer. 
Robert Elliott Kupp 
 Highly recurrent chromosome translocations that produce oncogenic fusions are a 
prime example of practical therapeutic targets translating into clinical successes. We have 
previously described the genetic driver of supratentorial (forebrain) ependymomas as 
translocations of the C11orf95 gene of unknown function and RELA, the canonical nuclear 
effector of NF-B signalling. Subsequent studies have reinforced our original findings on the 
frequency (>70%) of these C11orf95-RELA (C11-RELA) fusions in human disease, as well 
as their transformative potential in multiple murine models. However, the mechanisms by 
which C11-RELA fusions transform neural stem cells into ependymomas remain elusive. 
Using multi-OMICS methodologies, we show that oncogenic C11orf95 fusions co-opt spatio-
temporally regulated transcriptional activators. We find that the Zinc Fingers (ZF) of 
C11orf95 promote nuclear translocation and a common unique transcriptional signature 
mediated by the trans-activation domains (TAD) of the fused c-terminal protein partner. 
Specifically, the ZFs of C11orf95 direct DNA-binding (as shown with ChIP-seq) of the 
fused protein partner but does not appear to alter the c-terminal proteins nuclear interactome 
(identified using qPLEX-RIME and IP-MS). We further show that canonical NF-B DNA-
binding and dimerization, mediated by the Rel homology domain (RHD), are completely 
dispensable for C11-RELA fusion function in vitro and transformation of neural stem cells in 
vivo. We henceforth demonstrate that supratentorial ependymoma, which have been 
previously described as a RELA fusion diseases, are truly a C11orf95 fusion disease, with ZFs 
serving as a scaffold for transcriptional dysregulation. Our studies lay the architectural 
framework for a molecular roadmap into the heart of C11orf95 fusion disease, elucidating the 
biochemical mechanisms which furnish the capacity of these fusions to operate as single gene 
oncogenes, and henceforth providing potential avenues for therapeutic intervention in 
ependymoma.

1 INTRODUCTION. 
1.1 Paediatric brain tumours. 
Brain tumours are the leading cause of death amongst childhood malignancies (Glod et al., 
2016); however, patient prognosis varies substantially among brain tumour subtypes, which 
are generally defined by location and histopathology (Figure 1.1) (Dubuc et al., 2010; Glod 
et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017). Despite aggressive 
surgery, radio- and chemo-therapy, brain tumours are often incurable and inflict long lasting 
cognitive and endocrine deficits on survivors (Glod et al., 2016; Rizzo et al., 2015). While 
development of highly targeted therapies have proven beneficial in several liquid and solid 
cancers (e.g., Imatinib/BCR-ABL inhibitor in leukaemia, Erlotinib/EGFR inhibitors in lung 
cancers), they have so far proved ineffective against brain tumours (Gilbert et al., 2014; 
Prados et al., 2009), despite the presence of recurrent and clinically actionable targets (e.g., 
BRAFV600E in astrocytoma and receptor tyrosine kinase mutations in glioblastoma) (Filbin 
and Suv, 2016; Liu et al., 2017).  
 Recent efforts have focused on using transcriptomics and epigenomics, specifically 
DNA methylation, to robustly identify and stratify patient populations (Capper et al., 2018). 
These large-scale efforts (n>2000 primary specimens) have revolutionized our understanding 
of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity, and further refined our understanding of the driver 
mutations present at diagnosis and relapse in patients (Capper et al., 2018). However, despite 
widespread understanding of the genetic mutations and molecular alterations that drive nearly 
every subtype of brain tumour across age cohorts (children to adults), therapeutic 
advancements have largely remain unchanged over the past decade (Liu et al., 2017). Thus, 
identifying actionable and druggable targets is of the utmost importance for this underserved 
population (Jones et al., 2019).

Chapter 1: Introduction. 
1.2 Paediatric ependymomas.  
Ependymomas are the third most common paediatric brain tumour (Figure 1) with 
approximately 185 children (ages 0-19) diagnosed per year in the USA (CBTRUS 2008-
2012). These tumours present along the ependymal wall (hence their namesake) of the 
ventricular system all across the neur-axis (Liu et al., 2017; Pfister et al., 2009) (Figure 1.2-
3). Microarray profiling of patient tumours demonstrated ependymomas arising in different 
central nervous system (CNS) compartments (supratentorial, posterior fossa, or spine) have 
unique gene expression patterns and cellular origins (Johnson et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2005) 
(Figure 1.2-3).  
 Neural stem cells that line the lateral ventricle walls (i.e., subventricular zone, SVZ) 
are uniquely susceptible to neoplastic transformation in genetically-engineered mouse models 
of high-grade gliomas (Alcantara Llaguno et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2012a, 2012b; Zong et al., 
2015) and have been proposed as the candidate cell-of-origin for a number of paediatric and 
adult brain neoplasms (Figure 1.4) (Sanai et al., 2005). The ependymal wall functions as the 
interface between the ventricles, which harbour circulating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the 
brain parenchyma (rest of the brain) (Johansson et al., 1999; Kyrousi et al., 2017; Shen et al., 
2008; Spassky, 2005) (Figure 1.4). Why neural stem cells are located along the wall of the 
ventricles has been a topic of intense investigation of the past decades (Lim and Alvarez-
Buylla, 2014; Merkle and Alvarez-Buylla, 2006; Redmond et al., 2019). Much of this work 
supports a mechanism that neural stem cells (and under some damage conditions - ependymal 
cells) utilize their primary cilia that extrude into the CSF and respond to chemical cues (e.g., 
metabolites, chemokines, mitogens, etc.) which can stimulate proliferation and differentiation 
of these normally quiescent stem cells (Cutler and Kokovay, 2020; Magnusson and Frisen, 
2016).  
 We and others have shown that ependymomas (like other high-grade gliomas) likely 
arise from these SVZ-resident neural stem cells (NSC) or their embryonic ancestors (radial 
glia) (Taylor et al., 2005). Evidence to support the NSC as the ependymoma cell-of-origin 
has largely been provided in the form of cross-species genomics and ex vivo transformation 
of murine NSCs into ependymoma-like lesions (Johnson et al., 2010; Mack et al., 2018; 
Taylor et al., 2005). Single-cell RNA-seq analyses of primary ependymomas further suggest 
the neoplastic population of these tumours are more similar to immature neural progenitors 
and embryonic radial glia, than any other cell type found in the mouse or human brain (Gojo 
Chapter 1: Introduction. 
et al., 2020) More recently, direct transformation of neural progenitors and neural stem cells 
in vivo have been demonstrated using the RCAS model (in brief, RCAS virus is injected into 
neonatal murine brain that expresses the gene of interest; this virus infects only cells that 
express the Avian receptor, which can be spatio-temporally controlled; this results in cell-
type specific infection and expression of gene of interest) and in utero electroporation of 
ependymoma-specific oncogenes into the developing murine forebrain (Kim et al., 2019; 
Ozawa et al., 2018; Pajtler et al., 2019).  
 These murine models to date have relied on expressing ependymoma oncogenes in 
NSCs through lineage-specific Cre transgenes or somatic transfer into highly proliferative 
ventricular zone progenitors (Ozawa et al., 2018; Pajtler et al., 2019). However, the 
susceptibility of SVZ-resident ependymal cells, which are believed to be replication 
incompetent, to transformation has yet to be examined (Figure 1.4). This is hyper-relevant 
due to their shared ancestral origins with adult neural stem cells (derived from a common 
precursor in the developing forebrain which commit to either lineage around embryonic day 
14.5 in mouse embryo) (Fuentealba et al., 2015; Redmond et al., 2019), their similar location 
at the interface of the brain and ventricle (Figure 1.4), and ability to acquire stem-like 
properties under damage conditions (e.g., stroke, spinal cord injury) (Barnab-Heider et al., 
2010; Carln et al., 2009; Johansson et al., 1999). The generation of in vivo murine models of 
ependymoma which allow for spatio-temporal regulation of cell transformation will aid in 
resolving this open question if ependymal cells (or other peri-ventricular cells) can generate 
ependymomas or if they are transformation incompetent.  
 Massive efforts have been undertaken to stratify primary ependymomas using next-
generation sequencing technologies (n=500 patient specimens) to refine our understanding of 
the molecular subgroups present in this disease (Pajtler et al., 2015); these pioneering studies 
defined 9 subgroups (3 subgroups in each ventricular compartment: spinal cord, SP; posterior 
fossa, PF; supratentorial, ST) which harbour distinct molecular and clinical features (Figure 
1.5). This includes two subgroups in supratentorial tumours which are defined by 
chromosomal translocations: the more frequent C11orf95-RELA fusions (ST-RELA) and 
rare YAP1 fusions (ST-YAP1). Recent works have used these translocations to directly 
transform neural stem cells in vivo into ependymomas, suggesting they are the putative 
genetic driver for these two supratentorial subgroups (Kim et al., 2019; Ozawa et al., 2018; 
Pajtler et al., 2019).  
Chapter 1: Introduction. 
Figure 1.2. A. Human ventricular system. Adult central nervous system (CNS) contains four 
continuously connected ventricles (lateral, third, fourth, and central canal) in which 
cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. B. Survey of 500 primary ependymomas show 
that 90% of ependymomas occur intracranially, with 2/3 of these in the hindbrain (posterior 
fossa / 4th ventricle) and the rest found in the forebrain (supratentorial / lateral ventricles). 
(Left image adapted from KenHub.com and right graph is a depiction of data from Pajtler et

Figure 1.3.  Human brain has been proposed to have two main sites of neurogenesis: the 
subventricular zone (SVZ) along the lateral ventricles (blue) and the subgranular zone (SGZ) 
located in the hippocampus. Experimental evidence has largely relied on the murine models 
to validate this(Merkle and Alvarez-Buylla, 2006), however, recent evidence using human 
brains derived from foetal to adult to geriatric donors suggests that neurogenesis peaks at 
birth and declines during infancy and is undetectable in adults (Sanai et al., 2011; Sorrells et 
al., 2018). (Image courtesy of MediVisual, all right and copyrights reserved by MediVisual).

sections of adult murine brain. (C) Zoom into the subventricular zone (SVZ) which lines the 
lateral ventricles (LV). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is circulated throughout the ventricular 
system and acts as a buffer system providing buoyancy, waste clearance, and homeostasis 
through nutrient exchange. The SVZ is found proximal to the lateral ventricle and is the 
primary germinal niche of the adult murine brain where a variety of cell types reside: ciliated 
ependymal cells that directly contact the CSF, neural stem cells (NSC) which make contacts 
with both the ventricle and surrounding vasculature (blood vessels). NSCs upon activation, 
differentiate into transit-amplifying progenitors that rapidly proliferate and expand, prior to 
further commitment into the neural lineage as neuroblasts. Neuroblasts integrate into the 
olfactory bulb (OB) through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) in a phenomenon that peaks 
in the juvenile and declines during adulthood. Several other brain resident cell types provide 
critical contributions to the regulation and maintenance of this niche (oligodendrocytes, 
pericytes, astrocytes) (Image taken from: Cutler and Kokovay, 2020).

1.3 C11orf95-RELA translocations in supratentorial 
ependymomas. 
We and others have described highly recurrent C11orf95-RELA oncogenic translocations 
found exclusively in supratentorial ependymomas (Figure 1.6A). C11orf95 is a ZF-
containing protein of unknown function and RELA is a transcription factor in the NF-B 
complex. These C11orf95-RELA translocations generate at least seven different fusion 
transcripts, with the two most prevalent referred to as RELAFUS1 and RELAFUS2 (henceforth 
referred to as C11-RELAFUS1 and C11-RELAFUS2) (Figure 1.6B). Lower frequency fusions 
of C11orf95 with alternate c-terminal partners were also observed in our original 
supratentorial ependymoma cohort and by others (e.g., YAP1, MAML2, NCOA1) (Parker et 
al., 2014; Pietsch et al., 2014). Curiously, C11orf95 translocations with MRTFB (C11orf95-
MKL2) are the defining feature of chondroid lipomas (Huang et al., 2010).  
 Over-expression of C11orf95-RELA (or C11orf95-YAP1) fusions but not their wild-
type counterparts (C11orf95, RELA, YAP1) in mNSCs results in rapid brain tumour 
formation and induction of an NF-B transcriptional signature (Parker et al., 2014). As of 
2020, these findings have been reproduced by numerous different laboratories using various 
methodologies to deliver these fusions into murine neural stem cells and generate brain 
tumours in vivo (e.g., in utero electroporation, RCAS somatic transfer, etc.) (Kim et al., 2019; 
Ozawa et al., 2018; Pajtler et al., 2019), with several other models unpublished (transgenics 
knock-ins). Large scale genomics profiling of primary ependymomas (n=500) have 
reinforced our original findings, showing that >70% of supratentorial ependymomas harbour 
expression of a C11or95-RELA fusion transcript (Figure 1.7A) which correlates negatively 
with overall and progression-free survival in patients (Figure 1.7B). These data firmly 
suggest that C11orf95-RELA fusions are the putative oncogenic driver of supratentorial 
ependymomas; however, their mechanism of action remains unexplored.

1.4 Regulation of Gene Transcription. 
The molecular mechanisms underlying oncogenic transformation by nuclear C11orf95 fusion 
proteins functioning as chimeric transcriptional regulators are the main focus of this PhD 
thesis. In order to understand how NF-B transcription factors (and potentially the C11orf95-
RELA translocation) mediate transcriptional regulation, we will present a brief primer on 
gene regulation.  
 The regulation of gene transcription is governed by both cis- and trans-acting factors 
(Weingarten-Gabbay and Segal, 2014). Cis-acting elements are broadly defined as non-
coding DNA elements located on the same chromosome as the protein-coding gene, 
including both promoters and enhancers (Spitz and Furlong, 2012). Trans-acting elements 
include DNA sequence-specific binding transcription factors, chromatin modifying enzymes 
(e.g., histone acetyl/methyl transferases; nucleosome remodelers), the Mediator complex, 
basal transcriptional machinery (GTF, TFII proteins), and RNA polymerase II (Natoli, 2009, 
2012).  
 Transcription is initiated from the cis-regulatory element formally known as the 
promoter, which contains both the core promoter and the proximal promoter. The core 
promoter contains the regulatory elements (TFIIB recognition element, TATA box, initiator, 
and downstream promoter element) that bind RNA polymerase II and the general 
transcriptional machinery and is adjacent to the transcriptional start site (TSS) (Lempradl et 
al., 2015; Weingarten-Gabbay and Segal, 2014). The proximal promoter extends upstream 
and serves as the binding site for transcription factors. Both of these cis-acting elements 
(promoter and enhancer) function together to initiate gene transcription. The current 
mechanistic consensus suggests that the proximal promoter is bound by transcription factors 
which interact with and coordinate with distal enhancer-bound transcription factors to recruit 
RNA polymerase II, the Mediator complex, and transcriptional machinery to initiate 
eukaryotic gene transcription (Lee and Young, 2013; Natoli, 2012; Spitz and Furlong, 2012). 
 Eukaryotic DNA is highly condensed and packaged in the nucleus. This is achieved 
by wrapping DNA around histone proteins to generate a DNA:histone complex known as the 
nucleosome, which is the repetitive core unit of chromatin (Weingarten-Gabbay and Segal, 
2014). The degree of compaction of chromatin is integral in determining overall accessibility 
of DNA-binding proteins (e.g., transcription factors) and recognizing their binding sites 
(Natoli, 2009; Spitz and Furlong, 2012; Zheng et al., 2011); the opening or closing of 
Chapter 1: Introduction. 
chromatin is achieved through the recruitment of nucleosome remodelers (e.g., SWI/SNF, 
NuRD, PRC) (Bracken et al., 2019; Lai and Wade, 2011; Schuettengruber et al., 2017). The 
histone octamer for which DNA is wrapped around is formed by two pairs of each of the four 
major histones: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The amino-terminal tails for all four of these histone 
proteins are enriched for a broad range of post-translational modifications that inevitably 
influence chromatin biology by altering the net charge of the tail (and subsequent DNA-
histone interactions) and generation of sites for co-activator or co-repressor proteins to 
influence transcription (Arrowsmith et al., 2012; Benayoun et al., 2014; Chi et al., 2010; 
Greer and Shi, 2012; Lelli et al., 2012; Patel and Wang, 2013).  
 The two most studied post-translational modifications are lysine acetylation and 
methylation (Patel and Wang, 2013). The deposition of acetylation is achieved through 
histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and removed by histone deacetylases (HDACs) 
(Arrowsmith et al., 2012; Seto and Yoshida, 2014). Lysine acetylation, irrespective of where 
it is located on the histone protein, is primarily associated with transcriptional activation 
(Grff and Tsai, 2013; Shahbazian and Grunstein, 2007); for example: acetylation of lysine 
27 of Histone H3 (H3K27ac) is highly correlated to transcriptional activation and has been 
shown to directly mark active enhancers (Adam et al., 2015; Brown et al., 2014; Hnisz et al., 
2015; Lin et al., 2016; Lovn et al., 2013; Mack et al., 2018). The enzymes that catalyse 
acetylation on lysine residues are generally non-specific and capable of targeting various 
residues on histones as well as other proteins (e.g., EP300, CBP) (Lee and Workman, 2007; 
Ogryzko et al., 1996; Shahbazian and Grunstein, 2007).  
 Lysine methylation however can be both activating or repressive, depending on the 
lysine residue that is targeted (Chi et al., 2010; Martin and Zhang, 2005). It is important to 
note that the methyltransferases that catalyse these events are often highly-specific to their 
targets (e.g., EZH2), which is in line with the more context-dependent role of lysine 
methylation (Arrowsmith et al., 2012; Bracken et al., 2019; Patel and Wang, 2013). For 
example, trimethylation of H3K4 is strongly associated with active promoters and mono-
methylation is linked to poised/active enhancers (Benayoun et al., 2014; Robertson et al., 
2008). Methylation of H3K9 or H3K27 are associated with heterochromatin and 
transcriptional repression (Becker et al., 2016; Hansen et al., 2008; Hathaway et al., 2012; 
Zhang et al., 2015). Lysine methylations that are correlated with active transcription also 
have restricted localization across chromatin: H3K4me3 is enriched at promoters/TSS, 
Chapter 1: Introduction. 
H3K4me1 at enhancers, and H3K79me1/H3K36me3 on gene bodies (where they mark 
transcriptional elongation) (Zhang et al., 2015). 
  Transcription factors (TFs) recognize and bind specific DNA sequences to activate 
or repress gene transcription (Kim and Shendure, 2019; Stadhouders et al., 2019). TF binding 
sites can occur at both promoter regions and enhancers; promoter-enhancer looping is a prime 
example of TFs shaping genome organization to influence gene expression (Dowen et al., 
2014; Kagey et al., 2010). Looping of DNA is a proposed mechanism for TF-bound distal 
cis-regulatory elements to influence gene transcription and may play a role in the generation 
of transcriptional hubs that condense the co-factors and enzymes necessary to sustain open 
chromatin and transcription (Dowen et al., 2014; Sabari et al., 2018). Several mechanisms 
have been proposed to mediate this effect of TF proteins on 3D genome coordination: direct 
oligomerization of TFs, oligomerization dependent on co-factors, biomolecular condensate 
formation, epigenetics (DNA methylation, histone modifications), nuclear pore/matrix 
interactions, binding to DNA-loop extruders, and RNA interactions (Kim and Shendure, 
2019). Similarly, nuclear sub-compartments with distinct nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) and 
protein compositions may also generate hubs of active or repressed gene expression (e.g., 
nucleolus, paraspeckles, etc) (Strom and Brangwynne, 2019). One discrete example of spatial 
segregation is anchoring of pericentric heterochromatin onto the periphery of the nucleolus or 
nuclear lamina which are targeted and maintained by Polycomb repressor complexes 
(Lafontaine, 2019; Strom and Brangwynne, 2019; Zhang et al., 2007).  
 How genomic regions are targeted and maintained at these membraneless 
compartments through liquid-liquid phase separation (e.g., nucleolus) are of particular 
interest for drug discovery; as recent findings have indicated chemotherapeutic compounds 
are enriched in these condensates which may impair their ability to bind to their target of 
interest (Boija et al., 2018; Hnisz et al., 2017; Klein et al., 2020; Sabari et al., 2018). 
Furthermore, liquid-liquid phase separation appears to play a critical role in coordinating 
gene expression by spatially enriching transcription factors, co-activators, and RNA 
polymerase II at transcriptionally active gene loci (e.g., super enhancers) which maintain 
cellular identity (Boija et al., 2018; Hnisz et al., 2017; Kim and Shendure, 2019). 
Understanding the relationship between the 3D organization of the genome and transcription 
will give greater insight into the mechanisms by which TFs function and how their binding 
influences gene expression. In summation, gene transcription is regulated by both cis- and

trans-acting elements which coordinate and interact to shape the chromatin environment to 
permit or repress transcription (Natoli, 2009, 2012).  
1.5 NF-B pathway and signalling primer. 
The NF-B signaling complex represents a central hub which integrates external stimuli into 
rapid cellular responses for a large number of regulatory pathways, including inflammation, 
proliferation, and cell survival (Karin, 2006). Under normal circumstances, the NF-B 
complex is essential for transducing and mediating the cellular responses to infection and 
stress (Perkins, 2012; Zhang et al., 2017); however, the NF-B response is often pleiotropic, 
context-depdenent and cell-type specific (Dea and Hoffmann, 2010; Sen and Smale, 2009; 
Tong et al., 2016; Vallabhapurapu and Karin, 2009). Understanding NF-B complex 
functions under pathological setting requires an analysis of the genetic and cellular 
environment. Herein, we will provide a brief overview of the main regulatory mechanisms 
that govern this pathway, the functions of the transcription factor complex itself, and the 
consequences of their dysregulation in human cancers.  
1.6 Escape from the cytoplasm by IB destruction. 
The basic mechanism underlying NF-B complex assembly and translocation into the 
nucleus from the cytoplasm consists of a series of positive and negative regulatory steps 
(Hayden and Ghosh, 2012). Two pathways exist: the canonical and non-canonical pathway; 
however, both pathways converge to promote nuclear translocation of the NF-B complex 
(Hayden and Ghosh, 2014). The basic pathway functions as such: pathway stimulation by an 
external ligand (e.g., TNF) binding to its cognate receptor (i.e., TNFR) results in activation 
of the IKK proteins. These family of kinases (IKK, IKK, IKK/CHUK) trigger 
phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated destruction of the IB proteins that sequester the 
NF-B complex TFs in the cytoplasm, releasing them to enter the nucleus (Figure 1.8B) 
(Hayden and Ghosh, 2014; Hayden et al., 2012; Isral, 2010; Oeckinghaus et al., 2011). In 
the inactive state, NF-B complex dimers are associated with the IB family proteins 
(IBNFKBIA, IBNFKIB, IBNFKBIE) which bind to their rel homology domains 
(RHD) and mask the nuclear localization signal (NLS) present at the c-terminus of this region 
(Module et al., 2009) (Figure 1.8A). The inactive complex contains the un-processed 
precursors of NFKB1 and NFKB2 (p105 and p100), which must be proteolytically cleaved at 
Chapter 1: Introduction. 
ankyrin repeats (ANK) to enter the nucleus (p50 and p52) (Figure 1.8A). The IB proteins 
function as a critical molecular switch upon stimulation of this pathway and their ubiquitin-
mediated destruction, which is initiated by phosphorylation from the IKK kinases and 
concluded by SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, results in rapid nuclear translocation of the 
NF-B complex (Oeckinghaus and Ghosh, 2009). 
1.7 Gene Regulation by the NF-B transcription factor complex. 
The five subunits of this complex (RELA, RELB, REL, NFKB1, NFKB2) all share a 
homologous n-terminal RHD which have three functions: sequence-specific DNA-binding, 
subunit dimerization, and binding to the IB inhibitors (Figure 1.8A). Among these five 
subunits, RELA is believed to be the principal nuclear effector of this pathway (and is the 
most studied) and the only subunit whose germline knockout is embryonic lethal (mice die in 
utero due to liver failure) (Taniguchi and Karin, 2018). NF-B complex subunits can 
generate both homo- and hetero-dimers through the RHD, which allows them to bind to both 
promoter and enhancer sequences, where they primarily function as activators of gene 
transcription (Hayden and Ghosh, 2012; Napetschnig and Wu, 2013). The c-terminal trans-
activation domain (TAD) is necessary for gene activation and are only present in RELA, 
RELB, and RELC; thus, homo-dimers of NFKB1 or NFKB2, which lack the TAD regions, 
are believed to act as repressors where they actively compete for B DNA-sequences (Figure 
1.8A). The TAD-containing TFs have been demonstrated to bind and recruit various 
transcriptional co-activators (BET proteins, Mediator complex), chromatin-modifying 
enzymes (CBP, P300, TIP60, GCN5, TRRAP), nucleosome remodelers (SWI/SNF), RNA 
polymerase II complex, and general transcription factors (TFII proteins) (Zhang et al., 2017). 
Nevertheless, the nuclear NF-B complex, in whatever dimer pair it has formed, binds to the 
degenerate B consensus sequence in DNA 5-GGGRNWYYCC-3 (N = any base, R = 
purine, W = adenine/thymine, Y = pyrimidine) at both promoters and enhancers (Sen and 
Smale, 2009; Smale, 2011; Zhang et al., 2017).  
 Two distinct classes of NF-B dependent gene expression have been demonstrated: 
constitutive and immediately-accessible promoters (do not require chromatin modifications 
or SWI/SNF-dependent nucleosome remodelling) and promoters that are dependent on 
stimulus-induced chromatin modifications and require SWI/SNF remodelling (Natoli, 2009, 
2012). These two classes of B binding sites are directly linked to the asynchronous nature 
Chapter 1: Introduction. 
by which genes are activated: constitutive genes are induced immediately upon nuclear entry 
of NF-B (fast genes) and stimulus-dependent genes that display slower kinetics (slow 
genes). Both classes of B binding sites bear high-affinity DNA-binding sites but show 
differences in their chromatin landscape and nucleosome accessibility. Fast genes have high 
levels of H3K4me3 (histone modification associated with promoters or transcriptional start 
sites, TSS), and acetylation of histone H3 and H4, rendering them in an open and 
accessible format depleted of nucleosomes (Giorgetti et al., 2010). Conversely, slow genes in 
un-stimulated cells are associated with hypoacetylation of Histone H3/H4, do not bear the 
H3K4me3 mark, and are compact. Deposition of both of these activation marks (H3/H4 
acetylation and H3K4 trimethylation) increases at slow genes, tracking the kinetics of the 
overall NF-B transcriptional response, leading to increases in nucleosome accessibility and 
progressive decompaction of the targeted genomic locus (Natoli, 2009, 2012).  
 The process by which these stimulus-dependent, late genes are activated can be 
summarized in several steps. First, the chromatin surrounding the gene of interest undergoes 
the necessary remodelling to generate a state that is open for NF-B binding. This 
remodelling step is almost exclusively performed by the SWI/SNF ATPase-dependent 
nucleosome remodelling complex (Pierre and Kadoch, 2017). Remodelling of the locus is 
then followed by NF-B TF recruitment, RNA polymerase II loading at the promoter, and 
H3K4me3 trimethylation of the nucleosomes surrounding the promoter/TSS to generate an 
open conformation and gene transcription (Natoli, 2009, 2012). Cooperative interactions 
with heterotypical TF protein partners (e.g., STAT3, IRF3) have also been shown to mediate 
the initial remodelling step needed for NF-B to bind to these late genes. These studies 
identified a regulatory framework that integrates the basal chromatin landscape, 
transcriptional kinetics, and nucleosome remodelling that is necessary for induction of gene 
expression by NF-B (Natoli, 2009, 2012).  
1.8 Regulation of NF-B by post-translational modifications. 
Cellular localization and transcriptional functions of NF-B complex subunits are tuned by 
post-translational modifications (PTMs) (Oeckinghaus and Ghosh, 2009). We will focus on 
PTMs of the RELA protein specifically, for the sake of simplicity. The most studied and 
characterized is Serine 276 (Ser276) (catalysed by PKA, MSK1, and PIM1). Phosphorylation 
of Ser276 appears to have a bi-partite mechanism, by enhancing DNA-binding of RELA and 
Chapter 1: Introduction. 
promoting the CBP/p300 interaction necessary for transcriptional activation of target genes 
(Mukherjee et al., 2013). Knock-in mice where the Ser276 has been changed to an Alanine 
are embryonic lethal (between E11 and E16)  highlighting its importance (Chen et al., 2005; 
Mukherjee et al., 2013). In contrast, Ser536 is phosphorylated by IKK proteins and promote 
perinuclear localization of RELA, suggesting this site is important for regulating nuclear 
import (Module et al., 2009; Napetschnig and Wu, 2013; Vallabhapurapu and Karin, 2009). 
Acetylation at lysine residues (e.g., Lys310) by CBP/p300 has also been linked with 
increased transcriptional activity of RELA and promoting association with the Tip60/NuA4 
histone acetyltransferase complex (Napetschnig and Wu, 2013; Oeckinghaus and Ghosh, 
2009; Oeckinghaus et al., 2011). Acetylation of Lys221 promotes DNA-binding and impairs 
dimerization with IB. Thus, the post-translational modifications of the NF-B complex 
also helps to shape the fidelity of the transcriptional response by promoting or preventing the 
association with certain co-activators, cellular localization, and DNA-binding (Ruland, 2011).

into the nucleus, NF-kB TFs bind to and activate gene transcription at kB sites (adapted from 
Gerondakis et al, 2013).

1.9 NF-B pathway and cancer. 
Due to the focus of this dissertation on aberrant NF-B signalling in cancer we will not 
discuss the function of the NF-B complex during normal development, which has been 
extensively documented in the literature (Ben-Neriah and Karin, 2011; Hayden et al., 2012; 
Zhang et al., 2017).  
 Hyper-activation of the NF-B pathway in human cancers is generally mediated 
through two general routes: persistent activation of the IKK complex or mutations that 
disrupt negative regulators (i.e., IB proteins). Sustained activation of the IKK complex has 
been observed in cells with chronic exposure to activating stimuli (e.g., chemokines, 
cytokines) through both autocrine (tumour cells) and paracrine (tumour-associated 
macrophages) sources (Perkins, 2012). Oncogenic translocations (BCR-ABL) and high levels 
of amplifications of receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., EGFR, PDGFRA/B, MET, etc.) have also 
been demonstrated to drive activation of IKK as well (Kusne et al., 2014; Oeckinghaus et al., 
2011; Perkins, 2012). In contrast, deletions in the NFKBIA gene, which encodes for IB 
(the primary negative regulator of B TFs), have been observed in high-grade gliomas 
(Bredel et al., 2011) which also show aberrant NF-B pathway activation (Bhat et al., 2013; 
Carro et al., 2010). Loss-of-function mutations which disrupt TNFAIP3 (encoding for A20, a 
deubiquitinase enzyme that attenuates the NF-B response) have also been observed (Karin, 
2006). Direct mutations in the TFs that assemble the NF-B complex are rare, however, 
translocations have been observed (C11orf95-RELA fusion being the focus of this 
dissertation) (Panagopoulos et al., 2013; Parker et al., 2014).  
 The function of the NF-B complex once activated in cancer cells is often dictated 
by cellular genetics and the tumour microenvironment (Karin, 2006). One example of this is 
direct antagonization of the tumour suppressor TP53 through multiple mechanisms: 
competition for transcriptional co-activators (p300, CBP), NF-B-dependent induction of p53 
pathway inhibitors (MDM2), and even direct modulation of activating or inhibitory PTMs on 
the NF-B complex itself (Karin, 2006; Perkins, 2012; Zhang et al., 2017). Most of these 
pro-tumorigenic functions of NF-B largely converge on promoting proliferation and 
survival of cancer cells (Figure 1.9). However, the literature is confounded due to several 
examples of NF-B complex subunits also displaying tumour-suppressive activities (i.e., 
DNA repair, senescence) (Figure 1.9) (Perkins, 2012). These data suggest a biphasic role for 
Chapter 1: Introduction. 
NF-B complex in cancer: where auto-regulation of the pathway is critical for balancing 
these pro-apoptotic or tumour-promoting activities that often become mis-regulated during 
malignant transformation (Hayden and Ghosh, 2012). 
 Widespread efforts to identify druggable aspects of the NF-B complex for cancer 
therapies have produced varied results (Perkins, 2012; Zhang et al., 2017). These efforts 
largely converge on inhibition of: complex dimerization, partner proteins (co-
activators/regulators), nuclear translocation, parallel pathways, and genetic targets of the TFs 
themselves (Hayden and Ghosh, 2012). Direct targeting of the NF-B complex itself has 
largely proved unfruitful (Oeckinghaus and Ghosh, 2009; Perkins, 2012). Transcription 
factors are notoriously stubborn drug targets, with few success stories (Darnell, 2002). 
However, this paradigm has largely shifted over the past few years. Most notable are 
PROTACs, which are compounds that direct degradation of proteins using the endogenous 
ubiquitin-mediated degradation and proteasomal machinery (Bushweller, 2019). One curious 
example of this is Thalidomide - whose re-purposed use as a cancer chemotherapy 
contradicts its notorious teratogenic effects during in utero development (Kim and Scialli, 
2011; Vargesson, 2015). Several studies have shown that Thalidomide, and its derivatives, 
directs the E3 ligase CRBN (Cerebelon) to degrade C2H2-ZF containing proteins critical for 
embryogenesis and cancer-cell survival (Ito et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2014; Sievers et al., 2018). 
This molecular logic has now been applied to generating diverse PROTACs that target 
oncogenic proteins (e.g., BCR-ABL, KRAS, EGFR, etc.) for degradation via multiple E3 
ligases (e.g., VHL, CRBN, SCF) (Lai et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2020). Thus, drugging of the 
NF-B complex itself is not too far of a distant dream and is of intense focus for many 
academic labs and the pharmaceutical industry.

Figure 1.9. Pathways affected and consequences of NF-B activation in cancer. Aberrant 
activation of the NF-B pathway can occur through multiple pathways; almost all of these 
mechanisms converge on chronic stimulation of IKK proteins and nuclear translocation of the 
transcription factor complex. Once inside the nucleus, NF-B transcription factors bind and 
activate gene transcription. Genes targeted by the TF complex are often context-specific and 
signal-dependent, either promoting apoptosis or cellular proliferation (Figure taken from 
Perkins 2012).

1.10 C11orf95 primer. 
C11orf95 is the n-terminal translocation partner for RELA in supratentorial ependymomas; 
however, we and others have described additional c-terminal partners (e.g., YAP1, MAML2, 
NCOA2) detected at lower frequencies (Figure 1.8B) (Parker et al., 2014; Pietsch et al., 
2014). Furthermore, translocations on (11;16)(q13;p13) generate C11orf95-MKL2 fusions 
which are the defining feature of chondroid lipomas (Huang et al., 2010); a C11orf95-CRTC1 
fusion has also been observed in renal clear cell carcinoma (Ricketts et al., 2018). Nearly all 
of the published and unpublished c-terminal partner genes of C11orf95 in human cancers are 
transcriptional regulators  suggesting a common dysregulated mechanism in these 
translocation positive tumours (Parker et al., 2014; Torre et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) 
(Figure 1.8B). Thus, understanding the biology of C11orf95, a gene of unknown function, 
may help elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of C11orf95-RELA oncogenes in 
supratentorial ependymomas (Keenan et al., 2020).  
 C11orf95 encodes for a protein with four C2H2-type Zinc Fingers (ZF) equally 
spaced across the peptide and separated by repetitive stretches of acidic amino acids (e.g., 
Glutamic Acid, Arginine) that are predicted to be highly disordered (by PONDR-FIT) 
(Figure 1.8A). ProteinBlast using the NCBI database of the primary amino acid sequence of 
human C11orf95 shows high sequence similarity across mammals. Specifically, human 
C11orf95 and its mouse ortholog (2700081O15Rik) share 87% sequence similarity at the 
amino acid level. C11orf95 also has a potential paralog: C11orf84 (also called SPINDOC) 
which contains 1 C2H2-ZF that is homologous to the first ZF in C11orf95; interestingly, 
these proteins are proximal to one another on chromosome 11. Analysis of RNA expression 
using the Human Protein Atlas shows widespread expression of C11orf95 throughout adult 
human tissues  with enrichment in female reproductive organs (uterus, ovaries, etc) 
(FANTOM5 dataset). Unfortunately neither murine or human C11orf95 was included in the 
large Allen Brain Atlas databases (which used sequence-specific RNA probes in developing 
brain and spinal cord). Unpublished work from our lab (work of Claire King, PhD) mapping 
the expression of murine C11orf95 using RNAscope during embryogenesis and into 
development shows highest expression during neural tube and CNS development (E9-E14.5) 
with a substantial decline in postnatal mice. Germline knockout of murine C11orf95 is 
embryonic lethal with substantially altered mendelian ratios (Gilbertson Lab, data 
unpublished); suggesting a critical role for mouse development. Finally, commercial 
antibodies raised towards the c-terminus of human C11orf95 show cytoplasmic (intermediate

filament) expression in cell lines (Human Protein Atlas). However, validation of these 
commercial antibodies is lacking; the expression, localization, and function of C11orf95 has 
yet to be fully characterized.

1.11 Aims. 
Rationale: Sustained activation of the NF-B pathway has been shown in a variety of human 
cancers, however, direct mutations in the genes that encode the transcription factor complex 
itself are rare. We and others have described recurrent chromosome 11q structural variants 
exclusive to supratentorial ependymomas. These translocations generate rearrangements of 
C11orf95 gene of unknown function and RELA, the principal nuclear effector of NF-B 
signaling. Over-expression of C11orf95-RELA in mouse neural stem cells results in signal-
independent nuclear translocation of RELA, activation of an NF-B genetic signature, and 
brain tumour formation. These data suggest that C11orf95-RELA fusions are the putative 
oncogenic driver of supratentorial ependymomas; however, their molecular mechanism 
remains largely unexplored.  
The overarching aim of this thesis is to characterize the mechanisms by which C11orf95-
RELA translocations function as fusion onco-proteins. Based on our preliminary data and the 
known functions of RELA as a potent transcriptional activator of NF-B signalling, we 
hypothesized that C11orf95-RELA fusion function as aberrant transcription factors, 
activating an abnormal, oncogenic transcriptional programme . 
To address this hypothesis, we focused on three aims: 
Aim 1: Catalogue the common phenotypes among different C11orf95 translocations we and 
others have identified in supratentorial ependymomas.   
Aim 2: Characterize the transcriptomes, genome-wide occupancy, and protein interactomes 
of C11orf95 translocations and their wild-type counterparts using next-generation sequencing 
and proteomics.  
Aim 3: Identify the critical proteins domains in C11orf95 fusions necessary for oncogenic 
functions and cellular transformation.

2 METHODS. 
2.1 Cell Culture. 
2.1.1 Mouse cell culture. 
Generation of embryonic and postnatal mouse neural stem cells were described previously 
(Griveau et al., 2018; Ligon et al., 2007; Mehta et al., 2011; Shtayer et al., 2016; Sun et al., 
2011) for the following genotypes: Cdkn2aKO, Trp53KO, and Trp53/PtenKO lines (all generous 
gifts from the Mehta Laboratory). Cells were expanded and grown under neurosphere-
forming conditions (non-adherent dishes/flasks) in serum-free media (Neuro-basal media, 
B27, N2) supplemented with growth factors (EGF, FGF2) and Penn-Strep. Upon reaching 
confluency, cells were split using Accutase to dissociate spheres and re-plated as single cells 
in serum-free media on non-adherent plates/flasks. For monolayer cultures, cells were 
dissociated into single cells and plated onto mouse Laminin coated dishes in serum-free 
media.  
2.1.2 Human cell culture. 
HEK293 cells were sourced from ATCC and grown under standard conditions (DMEM, FBS, 
l-Glutamine, Sodium pyruvate, and Penn-Strep). Cells were split upon reaching confluency 
and maintained for 10-20 passages before disposal. 
2.2 Cloning. 
Due to the lack of available antibodies for our proteins of interest (at the time), I set out to 
generate varying epitope tagged cDNA constructs which enabled antibody-based purification. 
For all the cloning experiments described herein, the following genes were cloned for 
experimental purposes: RELA, C11orf95, C11-RELAFUS1, C11-RELAFUS2, YAP1, and C11-
YAP1. All constructs were Sanger sequenced for fidelity of experiment (GATC Lightrun).

Figure 2.1. Cartoon schematics of the open reading frames (ORFs) for the generated 
expression constructs utilized in this study that are in (A) lentivirus (black) or (B) Piggybac 
transposon backbones (indigo). Constitutive promoters used were MSCV (mouse stem cell 
virus), UbC (ubiquitin C), EF1 (Elongation Factor 1 alpha), CMV (cytomegalovirus), or 
CAG (CMV and B-actin enhancers). Fluorophores used were RFP (dsRed, tdTomato) or GFP 
(eGFP, copGFP). Antibiotic selection was restricted to Puromycin resistance. C-terminal 
ectopic tags were either 3x-HA, GFP, or RFP. Constructs containing firefly luciferase (fLuc) 
and Cre recombinase were also generated primarily for in vivo experiments. Constructs were 
also generated harboring gene of interest (GOI) without ectopic tags as controls. 
Chapter 2: Methods. 
2.2.1 Generation of lentiviral and transposon c-terminal tagged eGFP 
constructs. 
The donor plasmid, FUG (Addgene #66691), is a lentiviral construct that allows for 
bicistronic delivery of fluorescent eGFP and a Cre recombinase, separated by a self-cleaving 
peptide (T2A) and driven by the Ubiquitin C (UbC) promoter. This construct allows for 
recombination of floxed genes (via Cre recombinase enzyme) and intracellular tracking of 
eGFP tagged proteins with fluorescent microscopy. cDNA open reading frames (ORFs) for 
inserts were PCR amplified using CloneAmp HiFi polymerase chain reaction (PCR) premix 
per the manufacturers protocol (Clontech) with primers designed to generate homologous 
ends for donor plasmid (FUG) using the manufacturers cycling protocol. FUG plasmid DNA 
was digested with XbaI (New England Biolabs) at 37C and purified with a PCR Purification 
Kit (Qiagen). The amplified insert was then cloned into the vector using In-Fusion HD 
Cloning Kit (Clontech) with a ratio of 2:1 of insert to vector. Following transformation in 
Stellar Competent Cells (Clontech), single colonies were isolated and grown in Lyosgeny 
browth (LB) medium supplemented with Ampicillin (final concentration: 100 ug/uL), to 
select for transformed cells harboring AmpR gene. Plasmid DNA was isolated using a 
miniprep kit per manufacturer protocol (Qiagen) and DNA from clones were run on a 1% gel 
containing ethidium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich) and compared to parental plasmid alone for 
confirmation of insert. Positive clones were digested with restriction enzymes to confirm 
insert (New England Biolabs). Plasmids positive for desired insert were sanger sequenced to 
confirm sequence fidelity (GATC Biotech).  
A similar cloning protocol was followed for generation of PB-CAG transposon constructs 
(plasmid was a generous gift of Pathania Lab). 
2.2.2 Generation of lentiviral poly-cistronic, c-terminal tagged HA-tagged 
constructs. 
Donor plasmid, UltraChilli (denoted as UC; Addgene #48687), is a lentiviral construct that 
allows for UbC promoter-driven delivery of a polycistronic peptide consisting of the 
fluorescent protein dTomato, followed by self-cleaving peptides (T2A and P2A). This 
construct allows for rapid microscopic visualization of transfected and transduced cells (via 
the dTomato protein) and two multiple cloning sites (MCS) available for insertion of desired 
genes. Inserts (Cre, Luc, PuroR) were cloned into NheI site within second MCS following 
Chapter 2: Methods. 
T2A sequence using In-Fusion HD cloning protocol, as described above. The following 
inserts were used:  
 Cre (derived from FUG, Addgene #66691): UC-Cre 
 Firefly Luciferase (derived from PLVB, Addgene #17445): UC-Luc 
 Puro (from pCDH-IGP, Addgene #72299): UC-Puro 
cDNA constructs were then cloned from lentiviral backbone (pCDH-MSCV-EF1-copGFP) 
into retroviral backbone to insert c-terminal 3x-HA tag (DSR, Addgene #32703) (Figure 5A). 
C-terminal HA-tagged ORFs were then sub-cloned into either UC-Cre/Luc/Puro vectors 
using the XbaI site in the first MCS.   
2.2.3 Generation of Piggybac transposon constructs. 
Due to the inherent limitations in packaging and delivering of large genomes in lentiviruses 
(>10 kb), the Piggybac transposase system was used as an alternate method for delivery in 
vitro and in vivo of cDNAs of interest.  
Donor plasmid, PB-513B (Systems Biosci #PB513B-1), is a mammalian expression construct 
that allows for Piggybac transposase-mediated delivery of a dual promoter cassette which 
drives expression of a MCS by the CMV promoter or eGFP fluorescent protein and PuroR 
gene (encoding for puromycin N-acetyltransferase), separated by T2A self-cleaving peptide, 
driven by EF1 promoter. Inserts (Luciferase or HA-tagged cDNAT2ALuciferase; both 
from UC-Luc) were cloned into EcoRI+BamHI (New England Biolabs) sites within the MCS 
using In-Fusion HD cloning protocol described above. Second plasmid was also used (PB-
CAG; gift of Pathania Lab) to generate c-terminal eGFP constructs; this construct is driven 
by CAG promoter (CMV+actin enhancer). 
2.3 Mutagenesis. 
To generate deletion mutants of C11-RELAFUS1 and C11-YAP1, we utilized the In-Fusion 
system (Clontech, #638910) to delete the amino acids corresponding to ZF1 (ZF, W109-
W155), the C2-H2 region of ZF1 (C2-H2, M124-H149), rel homology domain (RHD, 
P229-Y516), and transactivation domain (TAD, P625-A754). Deletion mutants of the 
predicted nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES) are as described: 
NES (RELA-NES, L646-L660) and NLS (RELA-NLS, L499-P531) of RELA in C11-
RELAFUS1. C11-YAP1 deletion mutants were generated by deleting either ZF3-4 (W344-
Chapter 2: Methods. 
R649) to mimic C11-RELAFUS2 or ZF2-4 (K214-R649) to mimic C11-RELAFUS1 and the 
deletion of the transactivation domain in YAP1 (TAD, E878-S1086). His149 to Alanine 
point mutations (H149A mutant) was generated using In-Fusion system where the His codons 
(CAC) were shifted to Ala codons (GCC). All C11-RELAFUS1 and C11-YAP1 mutants were 
sub-cloned into retroviral backbones (Addgene #32703) for 3xHA c-terminal tag or lentiviral 
c-terminal eGFP tag (FUG, Addgene #66691), lentiviral (pCDH, Addgene #72299) and 
transposon (Systems Biosci #PB5131B) generating constructs for in vivo experiments.  
For live-cell imaging experiments, CR1, CR2, CY, and associated mutants were cloned into 
FUG or PB-CAG vector which have a c-terminal eGFP tag. Primers for mutants are available 
upon request. 
2.4 CRISPR-Cas9. 
For CRISPR-mediated knockout of genes, three independent gRNAs were designed for the 
following murine genes: Rela, Ngfr, and Ep300. gRNA and Cas9 (as well as Puromycin 
resistance gene) are delivered all-in-one lentiviral backbone.

2.5 Virus Production. 
Retroviruses were produced using standard protocols. Briefly, virus (retro- and lenti-viruses) 
were generated in 293T cells (ATCC) by Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Sci) 
transfection with viral packaging plasmids encoding pmd2.G (Addgene #12259), psPAX2 
(Addgene #12260), and the transfer vector expressing the construct of interest. Virus-
containing supernatant were collected at 48 and 72 hour post-transfection, filtered through a 
0.25 M filter (EMD Millipore) to remove cellular debris, and concentrated with PEG-it 
virus precipitation solution (SBI, #LV825A-1) overnight at 4 C. Following overnight 
incubation, virus was spun down per the PEG-it protocol (1500g x 30 min), supernatant 
aspirated, spun down once more (1500g x 5 min), and then pellet was re-suspended in Opti-
MEM media (ThermoFisher Sci, #11058021).  
To generate stable cell lines, mNSCs were plated as a monolayer on mouse laminin-coated 
dishes (1:100 laminin:PBS, 37 C for 2 hrs) and infected with virus 24 hour post-seeding. 
Positively transduced cells were selected for with 2 ug uL-1 of Puromycin (ThermoFisher Sci, 
#A1113803) for 1 week, detached from monolayer with Accutase, and returned to 
neurosphere culture. 
2.6 Cellular Fractionation. 
Human or mouse cells were grown to confluency as monolayer or neurospheres respectively 
and pelleted by centrifugation (1500g x 5 min) and subjected to manufacturers protocol of 
NE-PER kit (ThermoFisher Sci, #78835) to extract cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. 
Briefly, following pellet centrifugation, cells were re-suspended in Cytoplasmic Extraction 
Reagent I (CER I) supplemented with Protease inhibitors (ThermoFisher Sci, #A32963), 
vortexed vigorously, and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. Following cold shock, Cytoplasmic 
Extraction Reagent II (CER II) was added into the lysate mixture, vortexed, incubated on ice 
for 1 minute, vortexed, and spun down at max speed for 5 minutes. After transfer of 
supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) to a fresh tube, cell pellet was re-suspended in Nuclear 
Extraction Reagent (NER) and Protease inhibitors with periodic vortexing (4x10 min 
incubations) on ice. Solution was spun down at max speed (14,000 rpm x 10 min) and 
supernatant (nuclear fraction) transferred to a fresh tube. Fractions were then quantified using 
Direct Detect assay cards (EMD Millipore, #DDAC00010-GR) on Direct Detect 
Spectrometer (EMD Millipore) for downstream immunoblotting. 
Chapter 2: Methods. 
2.7 Immunoblotting. 
Immunoblotting was performed using standardized protocols described previously (Meijer et 
al., 2014; Shtayer et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2016).  
Briefly, cell pellets were re-suspended in RIPA buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-
100, 25 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 25 mM EDTA) supplemented 
with Protease/Phosphatase inhibitors and rotated at 4C for 30 minutes and then centrifuged 
at max speed to collect supernatant (whole cell lysate). Protein was then quantified using the 
Direct Detect system and equal amounts of protein (25-50 g) were loaded onto a 4-12% Bis-
Tris Nu-PAGE gel (ThermoFisher Sci, #NP0316BOX). Proteins were transferred onto PVDF 
membrane (ThermoFisher Sci, #IB401001) using the iBlot 2 system (ThermoFisher Sci, 
#IB21001) and incubated in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (Li-COR Biosci, #927-40000) for 1 
hour at room temperature (RT) on rotation. Primary antibodies were incubated with 
membrane overnight at 4C. For secondary detection of primary antibodies, membranes were 
incubated with immunofluorescent secondary antibodies (Li-COR Biosci, #926-68070, #926-
32210) following washes (3x10 min) with PBS-T (0.01% Tween-20). Following a final 1x 
PBS wash, membranes were visualized using the Odyssey CLx scanner (Li-COR Biosci) and 
quantified using ImageStudio software. 
2.8 Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (Histones). 
For Histone ChIP-seq, neurospheres were grown to confluency on ultra-low attachment 
dishes (Corning), pelleted, and cross-linked with 2 mM DSG (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS for 20 
minutes and then 1% formaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich) for 10 minutes with agitation at RT. 
Cross-linking was quenched with 0.125M Glycine (Sigma Aldrich) for an additional 5 
minutes. Cross-linked cells were lysed and sonicated in ChIP Lysis Buffer (1% SDS, 10mM 
EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1) using a PICO Bioruptor (Diagenode), and pelleted by 
centrifugation. For pre-clearing, 50 uL of magnetic protein A/G Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher 
Sci) were washed with BSA and incubated with lysates (1 hour rotating at 4C). Primary 
antibody immunoprecipitation was performed overnight with rotation at 4C on nuclear 
lysates with equal amounts of chromatin (25-50 ug) in Dilution Buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 
mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8). Following overnight pulldown, washed 
(1% BSA) protein A/G Dynabeads were incubated with lysate-antibody mixture for 2 hr at 
4C on rotation. Beads were washed 10x in RIPA wash buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 1 mM 
Chapter 2: Methods. 
EDTA, 0.7% Sodium Deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 M LiCl) and twice in Tris-EDTA. 
Reversal of cross-linking was performed overnight with agitation at 65C in elution buffer 
(1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3, 0.1 M NaCl) and Proteinase K digestion (10 mg mL-1) was 
performed on the following day at 42C for 120 minutes. Magnetic beads were removed and 
the immunoprecipitated DNA was subjected to cleanup using the ChIP DNA clean & 
concentrator kit (Zymo Research).  
ChIP-seq and input libraries were prepared using the ThruPlex sample prep kit (Takara 
Biosci) on a HiSeq 4000 (Illumina). For analysis of Histone ChIP-seq, each dataset consists 
of 4 ChIPs (per Histone mark) and associated input controls (n=2 inputs) for both empty 
vector (control) or CR1 over-expressing mNSCs (Cdkn2aKO). Samples were aligned to 
MM10 using bwa and peaks called using MACS (narrow mode), then loaded into DiffBind. 
After quality assessment with ChIPQC and evaluation of positive and negative controls, 
consensus peaks (97,608 peaks) were collected for further analysis (peaks identified in at 
least 4 ChIP samples). Differential binding analysis performed using DiffBind (with DESeq2 
as underlying statistical engine and FDR < 0.01). 
2.9 Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (Tagged Proteins). 
For ChIP-seq of biotinylated proteins a modified protocol utilizing two commercially 
available kits were adapted: TruChIP chromatin shearing kit (Covaris, #520154) and iDeal 
ChIP-seq kit (Diagenode, #C01010055).  Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected with Avi-
Tagged constructs (Genecopoeia) for 48 hours prior to ChIP assay using FuGENE reagent 
(ProMega, #E2311). Culture media was removed from plate and cells were washed with cold 
1x PBS. Cells were cross-linked for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde at RT. Cross-linking was 
quenched by addition of Buffer E (TruChIP Kit) for 5 minutes and cells were scraped from 
the dish in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Sci) and pelleted. 
Nuclei were extracted using Lysis Buffer B at 4C on rotation for 10 minutes. Pellets were 
cleared with centrifugation (1700g x 5 min) and re-suspended with Wash Buffer C, with 
incubation on rotation at 4C. Following centrifugation (1700g x 5 min), pellet was incubated 
with Shearing Buffer D3 and sonicated on Covaris S220 using the following settings: 5% 
duty cycle, 4 cycle intensity, and 200 cycles/burst. Confirmation of sonication (~200 bp) was 
performed using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Magnetic streptavidin beads (Thermo Fisher Sci, 
#88816) were washed with iC1 buffer and then incubated with equivalent amounts of sheared 
chromatin and incubated overnight with rotation at 4C. Following overnight incubation, 
Chapter 2: Methods. 
beads were washed using the DynaMag magnet (Thermo Fisher Sci) with kit wash buffers 
(iW1, iW2, iW3, iW4) per manufacturers protocol. ChIPd DNA and input were re-
suspended in iE1 and iE2 with proteinase K and incubated at 65C overnight with agitation. 
DNA was purified using the PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and eluted using Buffer C.  
ChIP-seq and input libraries were prepared using the ThruPlex sample prep kit (Illumina) per 
the manufacturers protocol. For ChIP-seq analysis, base dataset consists of 13 ChIPs and 
associated input controls. Samples were aligned to HG19 using bwa and peaks called using 
MACS, then loaded into DiffBind. After quality assessment with ChIPQC and evaluation of 
positive and negative controls, a set of 39,615 consensus peaks were collected for further 
analysis (peaks identified in at least two ChIP samples). Differential binding analysis 
performed using DiffBind (with DESeq2 as underlying statistical engine and FDR < 0.01). 
Six contrasts were examined: 3 comparing factor of interest (RELA, C11orf95, CR1) to 
control, and three comparing each factor to each other. 
2.10 qRT-PCR and RNA-seq. 
Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus Universal Kit (Qiagen, #73404) and quantified 
using Qubit BR assay kit (ThermoFisher Sci, #Q10211) on Qubit 3. 500ng to 1 ug of RNA 
was used for cDNA synthesis with Superscript VILO Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher 
Sci, #11754050). Taqman assays (ThermoFisher Sci, 4331182) to quantify relative transcript 
abundance were performed for mouse and human genes of interest, and normalized to 
housekeeping controls (18s, HPRT), on diluted cDNA template with a CFX96 Touch Real-
Time PCR System (BioRad). Relative expression analysis was performed by the 2nd 
derivative Ct method, and fold changes for genes of interest were referenced against 
housekeeping genes. For analysis of statistical significance, 1way-ANOVA with Dunnetts 
multiple comparisons test was used to compare group of interest to control group. Only p-
values below 0.05 are considered significant. 
For RNA-seq, RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus Universal Kit, quantified with Qubit 3, 
and analyzed using the TapeStation 4200 (Agilent) per the manufacturers protocol. Libraries 
were generated using TruSeq mRNA library prep kit (Illumina, #20020595) per 
manufacturers protocol, and 50 bp single-end reads were run on HiSeq 4000. Reads were 
aligned to the human (hg38) or mouse (mm10) genome using TopHat. Reads counts were 
called and normalised, and tested for differential gene expression using the DESeq2 package. 
Chapter 2: Methods. 
2.11 qPLEX-RIME and IP-MS. 
RIME assays were performed as described previously with minor modifications (Mohammed 
et al., 2016; Papachristou et al., 2018).  
HEK293 or mNSCs expressing appropriate transgene were grown to confluence and double 
cross-linked for 20 minutes in 2 mM DSG (Sigma Aldrich) and then 10 minutes in 1% 
formaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich). Cross-linking reactions were then quenched with the addition 
of 0.125 M Glycine (Sigma Aldrich) for 5 minutes. Nuclei were extracted using the NE-PER 
kit (Thermo Fisher Sci) and sonicated using the Pico Bioruptor (Diagenode) to produce DNA 
fragments <1000 bp. For RIME experiments, 100 uL of HA-coated magnetic beads 
(ThermoFisher Sci, #88837) were used for each reaction with equivalent amounts of protein 
for each condition (>6 replicates per condition). Following overnight beads pulldown at 4C, 
magnetic beads were isolated and washed 10x with RIPA buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 1 
mM EDTA, 0.7% Sodium Deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 M LiCl) and twice with 100 
mM AMBIC (NH4CO3).  
Trypsin solution (15 ng uL-1) in 100 mM AMBIC was added to magnetic beads for an 
overnight digestion at 37 C, with a secondary digestion performed on the following day for 
4 hr. Supernatant was collected after acidification of peptides in 5% formic acid and peptides 
were cleaned with Ultra-Micro C18 spin columns (Harvard Apparatus) per manufacturers 
protocol. Peptides were dried (via speedvac) and reconstituted in 0.1M TEAB 
(triethylammonium bicarbonate) and labelled using TMT-10plex reagents (Thermo Fisher 
Sci). Peptide mixture was fractionated with Reversed-Phase cartridges at high pH (Pierce, 
#84868) and nine fractions were collected using different elution solutions in the range of 5-
50% ACN. Peptide fractions were analysed on Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system 
coupled with nano-ESI Fusion Lumos (Thermo Fisher Sci) as previously described17.  
Collected CID tandem mass spectra were processed using SequestHT on Proteome 
Discoverer 2.1 for peptide and protein identification. Peptide intensities were normalised 
using median scaling and protein level quantification was obtained by the summation of the 
normalized peptide intensities. A statistical analysis of differentially-regulated proteins was 
carried out using the qPLEXanalyzer, R-bioconductor package (PMID: 29899353). Multiple 
testing correction of p-values was applied using the Benjamini-Hochberg method to control 
the FDR. 
Chapter 2: Methods. 
For non-crosslinking IP-MS, similar protocol was followed excluding: crosslinking, 
sonication, and IP-wash buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton 
X-100, 0.22 mM sodium orthovanadate). 
2.12 Mouse experiments. 
All animal husbandry and experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of 
the UK Home Office (HO), under the authority of a project license approved by the Animal 
Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB) at the CRUK CI and University of Cambridge.   
Intracranial injections have been described previously5. Animals used in intracranial allograft 
implants were CD-1 nude mice (strain code: 086) and purchased from Charles River. mNSCs 
used in allograft implants were harvested at E14.5 of Cdkn2aKO embryos, forced into 
neurosphere culture to enrich for neural progenitor, and infected as a monolayer with 
lentivirus expressing transgenes of C11-RELAFUS1 and related C11-RELAFUS1 mutants. 
Following successful transduction and confirmation of transgene expression (copGFP 
positivity), cells were dissociated into single-cell suspension, viable cells analyzed Trypan 
Blue exclusion, and 1.5x106 (in Matrigel) were injected per mouse into the forebrain of 
immunocompromised mice under stereotaxic control. Tumour growth was monitored 
clinically and/or by bioluminescence imaging, as previously described (Nimmervoll et al., 
2018). For implant experiments using the RELA-5965 line (C11-RELAFUS1 mEPN line) with 
CRISPR-KO genetic modifications, 1x105 cells were inoculated into the cortex of CD-1 nude 
mice as previously described (Nimmervoll et al., 2018). Mice were monitored and euthanized 
following the onset of clinical symptoms.  
For analysis of statistical significance, the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) non-parametric test was 
performed to compare the survival (time) distributions for group of interest to the control 
(CRISPR: sgLuc control; C11-RELA mutants: full-length fusion). Test excludes censored 
animals (non-brain tumour deaths; culled for health concerns). 
2.13 Immunofluorescence. 
Mouse or human cells expressing transgenes (either through transfection nor transduction) 
plated on coated coverslips (poly-d-Lysine for human cells and mouse Laminin for mouse 
cells) in 24-well plate at single cell density. After 72 hrs, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 
10 minutes under rotation. Coverslips were incubated with blocking buffer (5% normal goat 
Chapter 2: Methods. 
serum and 0.2% Tween-20). Primary antibody solutions were applied overnight and 
incubated in cold room, followed by secondary antibody staining for 60 min at room 
temperature, and brief exposure to DAPI for nucleus visualization. Coverslips were mounted 
on slides overnight and visualized by fluorescent microscopy. 
2.14 Immunohistochemistry. 
Mouse tissues were fixed in formalin for 24 hours, changed into 70% EtoH for an additional 
24 hours, and then stored in paraffin. Paraffin sections were de-waxed in xylene and re-
hydrated with alcohols (on Leica Multi-stainer ST5020). Heat-induced antigen retrieval was 
performed in citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6) in pressure cooker. Slides were 
washed on rotation in boxes for 3 x 10 min in PBS-T (PBS + 0.05 Tween-20). After 
incubation in 3% H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) in methanol, slides were incubated in blocking 
buffer at RT (in humidified chamber). Primary antibody was incubated on slides overnight at 
4 C. After washes, secondary antibody was added (biotin-conjugated donkey anti-
rabbit/mouse/goat; diluted in blocking buffer) for 1 hour. After incubation, slides are washed, 
and peroxidase was detected using liquid DAB with substrate chromogen system. Sections 
were counter-stained with Haemotoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted (using Leica Multi-
stainer). 
2.15 Software Analysis and Statistical Tests. 
Primary analysis of next-generation sequencing and proteomics (RNA/ChIP-seq, RIME/IP-
MS) was performed initially by CI Bioinformatics core facility and referenced under each 
specific methods section. Downstream analysis by user were performed using either MS 
Excel or GraphPad Prism v8. Boxplots are shown with median values (all data points shown) 
for qRT-PCR and RNA-seq expression data.  
Significant differences in next-generation sequencing datasets (RNA/ChIP-seq) were 
identified using DEseq2 (Love et al., 2014)s and DiffBind (ChIP-seq) (Ross-Innes et al., 
2012; Stark and Brown, 2011). Respectively, adjusted p values and n (replicates) for these 
experiments are indicated in relevant figure legends. Significant differences in qPLEX-RIME 
and IP-MS were determined using qPLEXanalyzer (Papachristou et al., 2018).

3 C11ORF95 FUSIONS ARE CHIMERIC 
TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS. 
3.1 Introduction. 
Ependymomas are tumours found at the brain-ventricle interface all across the neur-axis 
(Merchant, 2017; Wu et al., 2016). Whole-genome analyses and next-generation profiling 
have identified 9 distinct clinical and molecular subgroups with 3 occurring in each 
compartment: supratentorial (ST-RELA, ST-YAP1, ST-SE), posterior fossa (PF-A, PF-B, 
PF-SE), and spinal cord tumours (SP-SE, SP-MPE, SP-EPN) (Pajtler et al., 2015). Key 
amongst these is the ST-RELA subgroup - which are defined by chromosome 11q structural 
rearrangements that generate novel C11orf95 translocations (Parker et al., 2014; Pietsch et 
al., 2014). The most frequent c-terminal partner is RELA (hence the name ST-RELA), a 
core member of the NF-B transcription factor complex; however, lower frequency fusions 
have also been detected in patient specimens with alternate c-terminal partners (e.g., YAP1, 
MAML2, NCOA2, etc) (Figure 3.1) (Parker et al., 2014; Pietsch et al., 2014). Validations of 
these initial findings have occurred across multiple cohorts in various countries and 
confirmed that C11orf95-RELA fusions are the putative genetic driver of supratentorial 
ependymomas (Mack et al., 2018; Pajtler et al., 2015; Parker et al., 2014).  
 Sustained activation of the NF-B pathway has been documented in numerous 
human pathologies and cancers (Karin, 2006; Lawrence, 2009; Oeckinghaus and Ghosh, 
2009). Activation of the canonical NF-B pathway requires an external stimulus (i.e., 
cytokines) that binds to its cognate cell surface receptors, triggering a downstream kinase 
cascade mediated through the IKK complex, which releases NF-B transcription factors 
(RELA, RELB, RELC, NFKB1, NFKB2) from the inhibitory IB complex. This subsequent 
release allows these transcription factors to traffic into the nucleus and bind to B DNA 
sequences as a homo- or hetero-dimers, initiating a transcriptional cascade that results in a 
cellular response. The mechanisms that control the cytoplasmic sequestration of the NF-B 
complex and its transition into the nucleus have been well described in the literature (Hayden 
Chapter 3: C11orf95 Fusions are Chimeric Transcription Factors. 
and Ghosh, 2014; Module et al., 2009; Natoli, 2012). In our original study (Parker et al., 
2014) we observed that the most frequent C11orf95-RELA fusion, henceforth referred to as 
C11-RELAFUS1, enters the nucleus independently of TNF exposure, which is followed by 
aberrant and sustained activation of NF-B genetic targets and cellular transformation in 
vivo. The mechanisms underlying this aberrant nuclear translocation and the functions of this 
protein in the nucleus remain unclear and unexplored. As noted, most  if not all - of the c-
terminal partners in the translocation are transcriptional activators (RELA and NF-B, YAP1 
and HIPPO, MAML2 and Notch pathway) that are primarily anchored in the cytoplasm during 
homeostatic cellular conditions to supress pathway activation (Liu et al., 2017).  
 In this chapter, we explore the mechanisms by which C11orf95 ZFs, when fused to 
different c-terminal partners (e.g., RELA, YAP1), converges to promote nuclear translocation 
of these chimeric transcription factor. Nuclear saturation of this chimeric transcription factor 
results in widespread transcriptional activation of C11orf95 ZF-directed DNA-binding 
genetic targets, followed by subsequent changes in the epigenome and chromatin landscape. 
These data are critical in understanding why multiple C11orf95 translocations are detected in 
patient samples, and shed light on how molecular profiling efforts identify a common 
molecular signature even when RELA is not the c-terminal partner (Pajtler et al., 2015). In 
summary, the findings of this chapter show C11orf95 ZFs function as a putative nuclear 
localization signal (NLS) and mediate chromatin/DNA-binding in the translocation.

3.2 Results. 
3.2.1 Cellular localization of C11orf95 fusions and their wild-type 
counterparts. 
We and others have observed sustained nuclear localization of C11-RELAFUS1 protein 
independent of canonical NF-B pathway activation (i.e., TNF- stimulation) (Ozawa et al., 
2018; Pajtler et al., 2019; Parker et al., 2014); this suggests an abrogation of the homeostatic 
mechanisms that normally result in cytoplasmic retention of RELA and the other NF-B 
transcription factors. However, the cellular localization of wild-type C11orf95 or the other 
C11orf95 fusions identified in the original study (i.e., C11-RELAFUS2, C11-YAP1) were 
never examined. To address this gap, we transiently (48 hr) over-expressed Cre-inducible 
cDNAs harbouring c-terminal 3x-HA tags of the indicated wild-type proteins (RELA, 
YAP1, C11orf95) or the C11orf95 fusions of interest (C11-YAP1, C11-RELAFUS2, C11-
RELAFUS1) and performed immunofluorescence for protein localization in HEK293 cells. We 
do note that long-term expression of C11orf95 translocations is not possible in HEK293  as 
observed by vast cell death, as well as down-regulation of transgene expression (even with 
antibiotic positive selection of the transgene). As shown in Figure 3.2A, we observe the 
characteristic cytoplasmic distribution of RELA and YAP1, however, several intense nuclei 
stains are also observed and is consistent with the basal (and minimal) presence of these 
proteins in the nucleus. In contrast, C11orf95 and the three fusions all preferentially localize 
in the nucleus with the DAPI counter-stain (Figure 3.2A). We fractionated the nuclear and 
cytoplasmic compartments followed by immunoblotting using the same Cre-inducible 3x-HA 
tagged constructs in our HEK293 model. Consistent with our immunofluorescence data, we 
observe robust localization of all three C11orf95 fusion proteins (and wild-type C11orf95) 
inside the nuclear compartment (Figure 3.2B-C). These data identify a common phenotype 
for different C11orf95 translocations which all seemingly bypass the normal sequestration of 
these transcriptional activators in the cytoplasm (i.e., RELA and YAP1).

3.2.2 C11orf95 ZFs are necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization. 
Our data suggest the ZFs from C11orf95 can function as novel nuclear localization signals 
(NLS) when fused to c-terminal proteins. To test this, we generated domain deletion () 
mutants of the most frequent C11orf95 fusion, C11-RELAFUS1, encompassing regions gained 
from the n-terminal (C11orf95) and c-terminal (RELA) partner (Figure 3.3A). We first 
focused on deletions of the entire ZF, RHD, and TAD regions (Figure 3.3A). Transient over-
expression (48 hr) of these 3x-HA tagged constructs in HEK293 cells followed by cellular 
compartment fractionation and immunoblotting shows that the removal of the ZF from C11-
RELAFUS1 returns it to the cytoplasm where wild-type RELA is localized (Figure 3.3B-C). 
Removal of the TAD region from the C11-RELAFUS1 protein have minimal impact on nuclear 
localization and the RHD mutant appears to split 60:40 across the cellular compartments 
(Figure 3.3B-C). Mouse neural stem cells (mNSCs) stably expressing the same transgenes 
delivered by lentivirus produce identical results (Figure 3.5A). Unlike HEK293 model, 
mNSCs harboring deletion of Cdkn2a locus (encoding for the tumor suppressors Ink4a/Arf) 
tolerate over-expression of C11orf95 fusions and can be indefinitely expanded in vitro. These 
findings suggest that ZF1 in C11-RELAFUS1 (from C11orf95) is necessary to promote nuclear 
localization of the fusion protein.  
 We generated c-terminal eGFP fused contructs using a Piggybac-mediated 
transposon system which allow for stable transgenesis and visualization of the tagged protein 
under live-cell conditions. Similar as before, auto-fluorescence from eGFP-fused RELA and 
YAP1 largely appear to be cytoplasmic, and C11orf95 resides in the nucleus (Figure 3.4A). 
All three C11orf95 fusions, irrespective of the number of ZFs, localize into the nucleus 
which we label with a Histone H2B-RFP fusion under live-cell conditions (Figure 3.4B). We 
generated two mutants of C11-YAP1 (containing 4 ZFs) that remove either ZF3-4 or ZF2-4 
(mimicking the C11-RELAFUS2 or C11-RELAFUS1 respectively). All of the C11-YAP1 
mutants appear to be nuclear by live-cell eGFP autofluoresence (Figure 3.4C) or protein 
immunoblotting (Figure 3.5B). These data suggests that each of the 4 ZFs from C11orf95 
can potentially serve as an NLS. Analysis of the primary protein sequence of C11orf95 using 
NLSMapper for putative nuclear localization signal identifies four bi-partite NLS in each of 
the four ZFs (data not shown). C2H2-type ZFs acting as NLS have been documented in the 
literature for various nuclear transcription factors (e.g., EGR1, SNAI1, etc.) (Ito et al., 2009; 
Mingot et al., 2009; Yamasaki et al., 2005) and is not an unusual phenomenon.  
Chapter 3: C11orf95 Fusions are Chimeric Transcription Factors. 
 We turned to the C11-RELAFUS1 protein to further dissect this matter. We generated 
deletion mutants of C11-RELAFUS1 for the domains gained from C11orf95 that lose either the 
entire predicted ZF domain (C11-ZF), the core C2H2 amino acids within the ZF (C11-
C2H2), or the predicted bi-partite NLS (Figure 3.4D). All three of these mutants result in 
disruption of the ZF found in C11-RELAFUS1 and as observed in Figure 3.4D result in 
cytolasmic redistribution of the C11-RELAFUS1-eGFP protein. Curiously, deletions of the 
functionally characterized NLS (Cervantes et al., 2011) or nuclear export signal (NES) 
(Harhaj and Sun, 2015) in the c-terminal RELA portion of C11-RELAFUS1, have no 
significant impact on nuclear localization (Figure 3.4E). Removal of the TAD region has 
minimal impact on nuclear accumulation (Figure 3.4E) and the RHD mutant appears to 
inhabit both the nucleus and cytoplasm at near equivalence (Figure 3.4E). These live-cell 
data are consistent with our cellular compartment fractionation experiments (Figure 3.3). 
Complete removal of the entire RELA coding sequence from C11-RELAFUS1 has no impact 
on the nuclear accumulation of the fused ZF1-eGFP protein (Figure 3.4E). This suggests that 
the ZFs gained by C11orf95 translocations are both necessary and sufficient to promote 
nuclear localization.

3.2.3 C11orf95 fusions are transcriptional activators. 
The presence of C11orf95 and C11orf95 fusions in the nucleus suggests a potential role in 
gene regulation. We generated transcriptomes from mouse neural stem cells (mNSCs) that 
stably over-express these transgenes (empty vector, RELA, C11orf95, C11-RELAFUS1, and 
C11-RELAFUS2) through the Piggybac transposon system. PCA of these sample 
transcriptomes show that both C11orf95-RELA fusions (C11-RELAFUS1, C11-RELAFUS2) 
generate unique transcriptomes compared to their wild-type counterparts (C11orf95, RELA) 
under basal (vehicle-treated) or under transient stimulation of the NF-B pathway with TNF 
(Figure 3.6A). Similar to what we have shown before (Ozawa et al., 2018; Parker et al., 
2014), C11-RELA fusions can up-regulate known NF-B genetic targets that are also over-
expressed by wild-type RELA (e.g., Icam1) and those which are sensitive to TNF exposure 
(e.g., Pdgfb). Overlap analysis of differentially expressed genes (FC1) for each transgene 
compared to isogenic empty vector control shows the largest overlap is between the two 
C11orf95-RELA fusions (n=261 genes), followed by both fusions and wild-type RELA 
(n=148 genes) (Figure 3.6C). These data show that structurally distinct C11orf95-RELA 
fusions generate unique transcriptomes that are more similar to one another, than to either 
wild-type proteins (RELA or C11orf95), irrespective of NF-B pathway stimulation (Figure 
3.6). Thus, the novel ZFs of C11orf95 may not only serve to traffic these proteins into the 
nucleus, but may also mediate an aberrant transcriptional signature.  
 To further investigate this, we performed bulk RNA-seq profiling of HEK293 cells 
transiently expressing empty vector control, wild-type proteins (RELA, YAP1, C11orf95), or 
3 different C11orf95 fusions (C11-RELAFUS1, C11-RELAFUS2, C11-YAP1). We performed 
these experiments with transient expression (48 hr) to understand the immediate 
transcriptional changes, as opposed to stable lines which will have secondary effects 
following long-term expression of these transgenes. We utilized the standard DEseq2 pipeline 
to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) that are significantly changed (adj. p. val < 
0.05) from the empty vector versus all other conditions (Figure 3.7A). Quantification of 
these differentially expressed genes shows that a significant majority are up-regulated by all 
three C11orf95 fusions curiously, over-expression of C11orf95 have minimal effect on 
transcription in this transient system (Figure 3.7B).  
 Overlap of genes significantly up- and down-regulated (as compared to empty vector 
samples; FC1) by all three C11orf95 fusions identifies a common overlap altered by all 3 
Chapter 3: C11orf95 Fusions are Chimeric Transcription Factors. 
fusions (n=88 genes) (Figure 3.7C). Analysis of this overlap shows that the vast majority of 
these are up-regulated by C11orf95 fusions (as compared to control or wild-type 
counterparts), suggesting a preservation of transcriptional activator function by C11orf95 
fusions (87/88 genes are up-regulated vs. empty vector samples). Many of these genes (e.g., 
CCND1, FGFR3, IGF2, WNT7B, etc) are found to be up-regulated in the ST-RELA 
subgroup in ependymoma (Pajtler et al., 2015), which is defined by the presence of 
C11orf95-RELA translocations. We aggregated the list of genes that define the ST-RELA 
subgroup (n=825 genes) and overlap them with genes up-regulated by C11-RELAFUS1 
(n=1384 genes) coming to a consensus of 223 genes that are induced in the HEK293 model. 
We henceforth refer to overlap as the CR genomic signature (CRgsig). (Figure 3.7D). 
Similar to our unbiased overlap cassette - the vast majority of the CRgsig genes are up-
regulated by all three C11orf95 fusions (Figure 3.7D). Finally, we compared the 
differentially expressed genes by C11-RELAFUS1 in our mNSC and HEK293 in vitro model 
systems, as well as the genes enriched in ST-RELA-EPN tumours (Figure 3.8A). We see a 
large overlap of genes found in all three systems (n=203 genes) but by far the largest overlap 
were the two in vitro cell lines (n=1262 genes) (Figure 3.8A). However, due to the different 
natures of these experiments (transient over-expression in HEK293 and long-term over-
expression in mNSCs) it is difficult to meaningfully conclude which model is more similar to 
the patient tumour transcriptomes. Curiously, analysis of Gene Ontology terms for this 
consensus list of genes altered in all three models (n=203 genes) identifies terms involved in 
cellular development (e.g., animal organ morphogenesis, cell differentiation, nervous system 
development), cell proliferation, signal transduction, and cell communication (Figure 3.8B). 
This further demonstrates the immense transcriptional changes triggered by over-expression 
of C11-RELAFUS1 in multiple cellular models and suggests a link to normal brain 
development being abrogated in these patients. Critically, our data suggests the transcriptome 
of the ST-RELA subgroup is not necessarily a consequence of nuclear saturation of RELA 
or hyper-active NF-B pathway, but due to the presence of C11orf95 translocations in the 
nucleus.

3.2.4 L1CAM as a reporter for the presence of C11orf95 translocations. 
Key in this CRgsig is L1CAM - a gene we have previously linked to C11orf95-RELA fusion 
disease in our original work (Figure 3.9A) and that has been reproduced by others as being 
highly specific to the ST-RELA subgroup of ependymomas (Gessi et al., 2019; Mack et al., 
2018; Malgulwar et al., 2018; Parker et al., 2014). We observe induction of L1CAM transcript 
by all three C11orf95 fusions in our RNA-seq data set (Figure 3.9B). This L1CAM induction 
appears to be dose-dependent: the fewer the ZFs, the stronger the induction of L1CAM 
transcript (Figure 3.9B). This dose-dependent up-regulation is also true for genes that are 
induced by all three C11orf95 fusions in the CRgsig (Figure 3.7E). 
 We generated direct fusions between the ZFs from C11orf95 directly to the TAD 
region of RELA (Figure 3.10A). These ZF-TAD proteins also show a dose-dependent 
induction of L1CAM by qRT-PCR (Figure 3.10B) and on protein level (albeit weaker) 
(Figure 3.10C). Critically, the RHD region of RELA, the DNA-targeting module of NF-B 
transcription factors, has been removed in these direct ZF-TAD fusions and supports a 
mechanism by which C11orf95s ZFs may directly mediate binding to DNA.  
 C11orf95-YAP1 and the C11-RELAFUS1 and C11-RELAFUS2 mimics (where we 
have deleted ZF2-4 or ZF3-4) are also potent inducers of L1CAM transcript and protein 
(Figure 3.11). To test this genome-wide, we generated RNA-seq profiles from cells 
transiently expressing eGFP tagged constructs for C11orf95-YAP1, the two  mutants, and 
wild-type YAP1. PCA show substantial segregation of all 3 C11orf95-YAP1 mutants from 
wild-type YAP1 and control eGFP (Figure 3.12A). Overlap analysis of differentially 
expressed genes (FC>1; adj p. val. <0.05 vs. eGFP cells) identifies a common set of genes 
up-regulated by all 3 C11orf95-YAP1 mutants (similar to our previous analysis for C11orf95-
RELA and C11orf95-YAP1, Figure 3.7C) (Figure 3.12B). Similar to C11-RELA fusions, all 
three variants of C11-YAP1 fusions up-regulate the CRgsig (Figure 3.12C). Whereas, RELA 
itself is a DNA-binding transcription factor, YAP1 is a transcriptional co-activator in the 
Hippo pathway and does not bind to DNA directly; it is brought onto chromatin by the TEAD 
family of transcription factors (Yu and Guan, 2013). Our data suggests the ZFs of C11orf95 
serve as a novel DNA-binding domain when fused to a c-terminal protein that harbours a 
TAD region (e.g., RELA, YAP1). 
 Deletion of the entire ZF1 from C11-RELAFUS1, the C2H2 amino acids that serve as 
the Zinc ion scaffold, or a direct point mutation of the second histidine in ZF1 to an alanine

residue (H149A) (Figure 3.13A) all generate proteins that are incapable of up-regulating 
L1CAM by qRT-PCR or protein immunoblotting (Figures 3.13B-C). Similarly, cell over-
expressing H149A point mutation in ZF1 of C11-YAP1 ZF2-4 mutant (deletions of ZF2-4 
from C11-YAP1, mimicking C11-RELAFUS1), fail to up-regulate L1CAM by immunoblotting 
(Figures 3.13D-E). 
 In conclusion, our data support a model by which ZF-mediated up-regulation of a 
core set of genes that are dependent on the number of ZFs fused to the c-terminal 
transcriptional activator (RELA or YAP1). While we have focused on L1CAM as a readout 
for the presence of C11orf95 fusions for the sake of simplicity, these data are also 
reproducible with other genes identified in Figure 3.7 (e.g., IGF2, WNT7B). These 
transcriptome profiling experiments have identified a second phenotype shared by multiple 
C11orf95 translocations: a common ZF-dependent genetic signature.

3.2.5 Steady-state stability of C11orf95 fusion proteins. 
Due to the significant size differences between these different C11orf95 fusions (C11-
RELAFUS1 vs. C11-YAP1), we were curious if they had different intrinsic steady-state 
stability within cells. To test this, we pulse-chased mouse ependymoma cells (mEPN) with 
cyloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein translation that allows one to test protein 
turnover. As shown in Figure 3.13A, the turnover of either C11-RELAFUS1 or C11-YAP1 
protein seems to largely mimic the endogenous c-terminal partner (Rela, Yap1). However, in 
comparison to one another the protein half-life of C11-RELAFUS1 appears to extend beyond 
16 hours whereas the C11-YAP1 protein is depleted by 8 hours following CHX exposure 
(Figure 3.13A-B). We repeated this with a longer time course following CHX exposure for 
C11-RELAFUS1, collecting protein long after the mEPN cells have exited the cell cycle and 
initiated an apoptotic response (as shown by Cyclin D1 depletion and cleavage of Caspase-3) 
(Figure 3.13C-D). Similar to before, the C11-RELAFUS1 protein persists even 24 hours after 
all protein translation has halted by CHX. These data suggest the most frequent fusion in 
patient disease, C11-RELAFUS1, also has remarkable protein steady-state stability (in contrast 
to the much larger and less stable C11orf95-YAP1). The expression of C11-RELAFUS1 
persists even up to 7 days following exposure of mEPN cells (traditionally grown under 
serum-free, growth-factor-rich conditions) to differentiation stimulus using FBS-containing 
media (Figure 3.13E). However, robust down-regulation of C11-RELAFUS1 occurs following 
long-term exposure of mEPN cells to serum-containing media (time: >30 days) (Figure 
3.13F). These data suggests that the expression and intrinsic stability of C11-RELAFUS1 
protein may be restricted to cycling stem/progenitor cells (under SFM conditions) and lost in 
differentiated cells (FBS-exposed).

3.2.6 C11orf95 and C11orf95-RELA co-localize across the genome. 
To identify the genomic regions bound and regulated by RELA, C11orf95, and C11-
RELAFUS1 we performed whole-genome Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by 
highthroughput seqeuncing (ChIP-seq) using AviTAG constructs (n=3 for each gene). AviTAG 
is a small peptide tag that is biotinylated in the presence of the enzyme BirA which is 
delivered in trans with the tagged gene of interest (Fairhead and Howarth, 2015). The base 
dataset consists of 13 ChIPs and associated input controls (n=3 for empty vector, RELA, 
C11orf95, and C11-RELAFUS1; n=1 mock transfection control). Following ChIP experiment 
and next-generation sequencing, data were aligned to HG19 using bwa and peaks were called 
using MACS, and loaded onto DiffBind (with FDR<0.01). ChIPQC was used for quality 
assessment and used to identify a consensus set of peaks used for downstream differential 
binding analysis (n=39,615 peaks). PCA following quality control from ChIP samples shows 
similarity and consistency across replicates (Figure 3.15A), with one replicate of RELA 
calling no peaks and being removed from downstream DiffBind analysis (for complete 
description of analysis please see Methods Chapter).  
 Compared to controls, C11orf95 and C11-RELAFUS1 proteins show increased 
binding affinity for >30,000 binding sites genome wide with the vast majority (>70%; 
n=23,901) are shared in both conditions (Figure 3.15B). The binding sites of RELA are more 
sparse and restricted (n=1,156), consistent with the RELA protein largely being sequestered 
in the cytoplasm under basal cellular conditions (Figure 3.15B). Curiously, while the 
C11orf95 and C11-RELAFUS1 protein appear to share occupancy genome wide, C11orf95 
appears transcriptionally inert and has a minimal impact on the transcriptome (Figure 3.7). In 
contrast, transient over-expression of C11-RELAFUS1 results in >1,500 differentially 
expressed genes (fold change 1; adj. p val. <0.05) compared to the empty vector control 
with 88% (n=1383/1575) of these up-regulated and the remainder (12%; n=192/1575) down-
regulated. Overlap analysis of differentially expressed genes (detected by RNA-seq) and 
C11-RELAFUS1 binding sites show the vast majority (72%) of the up-regulated genes have a 
C11-RELAFUS1 binding event present at the target loci (Figure 3.15C). Amongst set of genes 
that are down-regulated following transient over-expression of C11-RELAFUS1 (12%; 
n=192/1575 DEG), less than a third have a ChIP-binding event (Figure 3.15C). We input 
these C11-RELAFUS1 bound and up-regulated genes (n=995 genes) into the ShinyGO 
database to identify enriched motifs at the promoters of these genes (300 bp). 
Unsurprisingly this returns a significant proportion of motifs for C2H2-ZFs (Table 3.1). 
Chapter 3: C11orf95 Fusions are Chimeric Transcription Factors. 
This however does not include the core motif described for C11-RELAFUS1 (5-GTGGCCC-
3) in a recent publication (Zhu et al., 2020), but does contain similar motifs that are GC-
enriched.  These ChIP/RNA-seq data taken together suggest C11-RELAFUS1 primarily 
functions as a transcriptional activator and is brought onto chromatin by the ZF gained from 
C11orf95. A similar finding was observed in the Zhu et al, 2020 publication - which showed 
that C11orf95 and C11-RELAFUS1 co-occupy the genome with minimal overlap with wild-
type RELA. 
 To better define these bound and up-regulated genetic targets of C11-RELAFUS1 we 
performed Gene Ontology (GO) analyses of this more discrete list of genes (derived from 
Figure 3.15C). Network analysis of the Top 20 most significantly enriched Biological 
Processes identfiy a number of terms involved in animal organ development (FDR=4.4e-10), 
cell adhesion (FDR =3.0e-09), extracellular matrix organization (FDR =1.1e-10), and 
neurogenesis (FDR =4.7e-9) (Figure 3.16A). This hints at the potential function of  C11orf95 
during normal central nervous system development. Unpublished work from our group using 
a germline C11orf95-KO mouse suggests early embryonic lethality (Claire King, PhD) and a 
critical role for this gene in normal brain development. Ongoing studies will help to clarify 
the role of C11orf95 gene in development. Curiously, analysis of the top 20 GO terms for 
molecular function largely identify clusters of terms involved in RNA polymerase II activity 
(FDR =3.0e-07) and sequence-specific DNA-binding (FDR=6.2e-07), consistent with a 
dysregulation in transcription observed following transient over-expression of C11-
RELAFUS1; more curiously, a dense network of GO molecular functions terms for ion channel 
activity are identified (Figure 3.16B). This finding is aligns with previous work that showed 
that calcium ion transporter CACNA1G (CAV3.1) as a ST-RELA subgroup specific 
vulnerability (Mack et al., 2018) and suggests a potential novel therapeutic avenue for these 
cohorts of patients. 
 As shown in Figure 3.17 using the IGV browser, we observe C11orf95 and C11-
RELAFUS1 binding events, which overlap with H3K27ac-bound enhancers from ST-RELA 
patient tumours (data from Mack et al, 2018) over the previously characterized ST-RELA 
subgroup genes and those we identify as being co-regulated by all C11orf95 fusions (i.e., 
L1CAM, CCND1, WNT7B, NGFR) (Figure 3.7). In summation, the high degree of overlap 
between C11orf95 and C11-RELAFUS1 binding events across the genome (>70% sites directly 
shared; Figure 3.15B), despite their structural divergence (4ZFs vs. only the first ZF fused 
to RELA), support our mechanistic data that disparate C11orf95 translocations activate a

3.2.7 C11orf95-RELA re-organize the histone/chromatin landscape. 
Transcription factors assert their functions by binding onto their cognate DNA sequences, 
recruiting partner proteins that act as co-factors/activators, which result in gene activation or 
silencing (Greer and Shi, 2012; Helin and Dhanak, 2013; Karch et al., 2013; Zhou, 2015). 
During this process, the chromatin environment is actively remodelled and key amongst these 
is the post-translational modifications of histones that package DNA into chromatin. These 
post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, etc) and the 
enzymes that catalyse them, have been well documented in the literature and are tightly 
linked with gene transcription or gene silencing (Arrowsmith et al., 2012; Copeland et al., 
2010; Helin and Dhanak, 2013; Natoli, 2012; Patel and Wang, 2013). We observe in our 
ChIP/RNA-seq experiments that the C11-RELAFUS1 protein directly binds to chromatin and 
activates a large number of genes (Figure 3.7 and 3.15) and these binding events detected in 
our HEK293 cellular model overlap with H3K27ac enhancers from primary ependymomas 
(Figure 3.16).  
 To directly test if C11-RELAFUS1 alters the histone chromatin landscape, we turned 
to our mNSC model which allows for long-term propagation of C11-RELAFUS1 protein with 
minimal effects on proliferation or cell death. We profiled 6 different histone marks using 
ChIP-seq: H3K27ac (active enhancers), H3K4me1 (active and poised enhancers), H3K36me3 
(gene elongation), H3K4me3 (promoters), H3K27me3 (repressed genes), and H2AK119ub 
(heterochromatin) (Greer and Shi, 2012; Patel and Wang, 2013; Su and Denu, 2016). 
Analysis and workflow for histone ChIP-seq were similar to the AviTAG ChIP-seq (see 
methods chapter for details). In this experiment there were two conditions (empty vector vs 
C11-RELAFUS1 expressing mNSCs) and 6 different ChIPs (with n=4 ChIP replicates; n=2 
inputs). As shown by PCA, ChIP samples from either empty vector or C11-RELAFUS1 
expressing mNSCs largely segregate with one another (Figure 3.18), with the exception of 
H3K4me3, for which we suspect is due to variation in ChIP efficiency and pulldown.  
 We performed differential binding analysis to identify significantly bound sites by 
these histone ChIPs (FDR<0.05) in C11-RELAFUS1-expressing vs empty vector mNSCs 
(Figure 3.19). All three active chromatin marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K36me3) show 
significant gains of ChIPd sites (FC>1) in C11-RELAFUS1-expressing mNSCs. An inverse 
relationship is observed for the gene repressed mark H3K27me3, which show losses in 
mNSCs expressing C11-RELAFUS1 (Figure 3.19). This is consistent with widespread 
activation of transcription (H3K36me3), enhancers (H3K4me1, H3K27ac) and loss of 
Chapter 3: C11orf95 Fusions are Chimeric Transcription Factors. 
silenced genes that are marked by H3K27me3 following over-expression of C11-RELAFUS1 
(Figure 3.19).  
 The constitutive heterochromatin mark H2AK119ub is more elusive and suggests 
some gains and some losses following C11-RELAFUS1 over-expression (Figure 3.19). This 
suggests that C11-RELAFUS1 activation of transcription is not as ubiquitous or widespread as 
presumed (at least in this stably expressing mNSC model). However, we do note that ChIP 
protocols for heterochromatin marks (H3K9me3, H2AK119ub) face more technical 
challenges than those found in euchromatin (e.g., H3K27ac) (Becker et al., 2016; Martin and 
Zhang, 2005; Zhang et al., 2015). Finally, the promoter mark H3K4me3 display substantial 
losses in C11-RELAFUS1-expressing mNSCs, which we primarily believe is due to ChIP 
inefficiency among the empty vector replicates (Figure 3.19). However, we cannot exclude 
the possibility that C11-RELAFUS1 may potentially restrict promoters. Due to this technical 
challenge, we exclude it from our downstream analysis to identify genes that are co-regulated 
by histone marks and transcriptional changes (RNA-seq). 
 We performed an overlap analysis for gains (FC>1 vs. empty vector mNSCs) of 
active chromatin marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K36me3) and up-regulated genes by RNA-
seq (FC>1 vs. empty vector mNSCs) in our isogenic C11-RELAFUS1 mNSCs (Figure 3.6). 
As shown in, Figure 3.20A, 74 genes are bound by all 3 active chromatin marks and up-
regulated by C11-RELAFUS1 in our RNA-seq. Candidate genes of interest are using the IGV 
browser that are potential oncogenes in brain tumours (e.g. Pdgfb, Ngfr, Axl) (Figure 3.20B). 
We note that most of these genes in this cluster of 74 all show gains in H3K4me3 as well (as 
shown in Figure 3.19B), suggesting this H3K4me3 dataset is not completely useless (Figure 
3.20B). In summation, we show that stable expression of C11-RELAFUS1 in mNSCs remodels 
the active chromatin landscape of enhancers (H3K27ac, H3K4me1), resulting in loss of 
repressor marks (H3K27me3) and deposition of the transcriptional elongation mark 
(H3K36me3).

3.2.8 Ngfr is up-regulated by C11orf95-RELA in vitro and in vivo. 
Combining our ChIP/RNA-seq data allows us to identify putative genetic targets of C11orf95 
fusions that are potential druggable targets. One of these targets is the Nerve growth factor 
receptor (Ngfr/NGFR; p75-NTR), which is up-regulated in both the HEK293 and mNSC 
models (Figure 3.6 and 3.7), as well as in the human ependymoma tumours (Figure 3.17) 
(Hagel et al., 2013). The Ngfr is a member of the neurotrophin binding receptors, which 
include TrkA-C and Ngfr, which are capable of binding to Bdnf, Ngf, and NT-3/4, at 
different levels and efficiencies (Figure 3.21A) (Chao et al., 2006). While the roles of the 
Trk receptors in proliferation and cell survival are well documented, the functions of Ngfr are 
more controversial with data supporting a role in proliferation and apoptosis (Chao et al., 
2006; Hennigan et al., 2007; Meakin and Shooter, 1992; Zampieri and Chao, 2006). Many of 
these contradictory functions appear to be cell-type and model specific, which further 
complicate our understanding of this proteins function.  
 We observe robust up-regulation of Ngfr protein in mNSCs expressing C11-
RELAFUS1 protein but not by control cells (empty vector, RELA, C11orf95) (Figure 3.21B). 
We have previously described and characterized oncogenes in ependymomas using a forward 
genetic screen (e.g., EPHB2, RTBDN, BCL7, RAB3A, etc) . Immunoblot from mNSC or 
mEPN cells (expressing indicated oncogenes) confirm Ngfr is specifically up-regulated in 
mEPN cells expressing C11-RELAFUS1 but not those expressing the EPHB2 or RTBDN 
oncogenes (Figure 3.21C). We generated RNA-seq profiles from control mNSCs (wild-type 
or Cdkn2aKO) and a large cohort of mEPN lines over-expressing different ependymoma 
oncogenes (e.g., RAB3A, BCL7, RTBDN, EPHB2). These transcriptomes by PCA form 
discrete clusters; whereas, the two independently derived mEPN lines expressing C11-
RELAFUS1 (referred to as RELA-5965 and RELA-5954) segregate from all of the other mEPN 
lines (Figure 3.22A). Ngfr transcript shows near undetectable reads in almost all of our cell 
lines except those expressing C11-RELAFUS1 (Figure 3.22B). These data suggest that the 
Ngfr is uniquely up-related in C11orf95-RELA fusion ependymomas. Ngfr is also expressed 
in our Wnt subtype medulloblastoma mouse model (mMBWNT) (Gibson et al., 2010; 
Robinson et al., 2012) and in the progenitor population which transforms to generate these 
tumours (i.e., lower rhombic lip progenitors, LRL) (Figure 3.22B).  
 We observe intense expression of Ngfr in vivo by IHC in both orthotopic implants of 
mEPN cells expressing C11-RELAFUS1 and transgenic mouse Wnt tumour (Figure 3.22C). 
We do not observe any tumour immunoreactivity for Ngfr by IHC in RTBDN-driven tumours 
Chapter 3: C11orf95 Fusions are Chimeric Transcription Factors. 
(Figure 3.22C). We generated spontaneous tumours in vivo by injection of lentivirus 
expressing C11-RELAFUS1 into the lateral ventricle of new born CD1R mice. These mice 
succumb to peri-ventricular lesions following a significant latency, demonstrating the C11-
RELAFUS1 is a single gene oncogene as previously described (Ozawa et al., 2018). 
Immunohistochemical analysis of an endpoint tumour shows nuclear reactivity for Rela 
(Figure 3.23), high expression of Ngfr and various markers of embryonic neural stem cells 
(Vimentin, Olig2) (the cell of origin for ependymomas) (Taylor et al., 2005) (Figure 3.23). 
These data suggests the Ngfr is a target of the C11-RELAFUS1 in vitro and in vivo, and may be 
critical in the transformation process that occurs in neural stem cells along the lateral 
ventricle wall into ependymomas (Ozawa et al., 2018).  
 To test if Ngfr is required for tumour formation in vivo, we generated 3 gRNAs 
targeting different exons of the mouse Ngfr gene. These constructs are delivered in a 
lentiviral all-in-one backbone harbouring gRNAs, Cas9, and puromycin resistance for 
selection. We transduced mEPN expressing C11-RELAFUS1 cells with control gRNA targeting 
Luc or three independent gRNAs targeting different Ngfr exons. Immunoblot analysis of 
these cells following selection confirm protein knockdown (Figure 3.24A), with one gRNA 
in particular generating greater than 90% protein knockdown when normalized to sgLuc 
control (Figure 3.24A). To test if these mEPN cells were competent in generating tumours in 
vivo following Ngfr protein depletion, we intracranially injected juvenile Nude mice with 
1x105 cells per mouse (n=10 sgLuc, n=9 sgNgfr). Surprisingly, loss of Ngfr protein in mEPN 
cells expressing C11-RELAFUS1 accelerates tumour latency (sgNgfr, med. Survival = 25.5 
days; sgLuc, med. Survival = 30 days) compared to sgLuc control cells (Figure 3.24B). H&E 
of mouse tumours from either cohort show similar histology, cellularity, and location (Figure 
3.24C). While the Ngfr protein is an exquisite marker for C11-RELAFUS1 transformed cells in 
vivo (Figure 3.23), these data suggest that it is not required for tumour initiation in our 
implant model and is not an appropriate target for therapeutic intervention.

3.3 Summary. 
The work in this chapter have defined two common features among multiple C11orf95 
translocations identified in supratentorial ependymomas: active nuclear trafficking and novel 
targeting onto DNA mediated by C11orf95 ZFs. Under basal (un-stimulated) conditions, the 
NF-B pathway is attenuated through retention of the transcription factors (RELA-C; 
NFKB1-2) that comprise this complex in the cytoplasm (Karin, 2006; Oeckinghaus and 
Ghosh, 2009). Strikingly, lower frequency C11orf95 fusions identified by us and others, are 
regulated in a similar manner (YAP1 and Hippo, MAML2/3 and Notch). Thus, a similar 
phenotype emerges from these C11orf95 translocations in ependymoma and beyond 
(C11orf95-MKL2 translocations in chondroid lipomas) that converge on aberrant and 
sustained nuclear saturation of transcriptional activators which are normally localized in the 
cytoplasm.  
 We have shown throughout this chapter using multiple methodologies that fusions of 
C11orf95 ZFs to cytoplasmic proteins (e.g., RELA or YAP1) results in rapid and sustained 
nuclear localization, in contrast to their wild-type counterparts (Figures 3.2 and 3.4). 
Deletion of the predicted ZF domain or the core C2H2 amino acids comprising the ZF, 
reverses this phenomenon (Figures 3.3-4 and 3.14). Similarly, the number of ZFs gained by 
RELA or YAP1, does not seem to alter this phenomenon, despite vast differences in protein 
size and tertiary structure (Figures 3.2-3.4 and 3.14). Furthermore, direct fusion of C11orf95 
ZF1 to membrane-bound native eGFP is sufficient to promote nuclear accumulation (Figure 
3.4). These data suggest that the C2H2-type ZFs of C11orf95 can act as a nuclear 
localization signal (NLS); this phenomenon of ZFs moonlighting as an NLS is well-
documented in the literature for a multitude of ZF-containing proteins (Hatayama et al., 2008; 
Ito et al., 2009; Mingot et al., 2009; Shimojo et al., 2001).  
 The exact mechanism of how C11orf95s ZFs behave as an NLS remains to be 
determined. Preliminary experiments using pharmacological inhibitors of nuclear import and 
export proteins (i.e., Importazole and Selinexor) have yielded no great insight when 
incubated with cells expressing the eGFP fused to C11-RELAFUS1 protein (data not shown). 
These results might be impeded by the surprisingly high steady-state stability of C11-
RELAFUS1 (T1/2 >24 hours) (Figure 3.14). Further investigation should focus on preventing 
the nuclear accumulation of these fusion proteins as a potential therapeutic for patients 
presenting with heterogenous C11orf95 translocations. These therapeutics may also benefit

the other supratentorial molecular subgroup in ependymoma which are defined by distinct n-
terminal YAP1 fusions (ST-YAP1; c-terminal partner: MAMLD1 or FAM118B) that also 
display disrupted cytoplasm-nucleus localization (Pajtler et al., 2019). Thalidomides, which 
have been shown to direct CRBN-mediated degradation of C2H2-type ZFs (Sievers et al., 
2018), may be of special interest for C11orf95 translocation positive ependymomas.  
 The saturation of these C11orf95 translocations in the nucleus inevitably suggested a 
role in gene regulation. Our transcriptome analyses in multiple cell backgrounds identify a 
common cohort of genes differentially up-regulated by both C11orf95-RELA and C11orf95-
YAP1 fusions (Figure 3.6) that substantially overlap with those defined in the ST-RELA 
subgroup of ependymoma (referred to as the CRgsig) (Figure 3.7) (Pajtler et al., 2015). This 
ZF-directed DNA binding is further supported by the genomic occupancy of the C11-
RELAFUS1 protein overlapping substantially (>70% binding sites shared) with wild-type 
C11orf95 (Figures 3.15-17) in our whole-genome ChIP-seq analyses. Many of these genetic 
targets (defined by ChIP-seq binding and differential expression by RNA-seq) of C11-
RELAFUS1 show overlap with H3K27ac active enhancers from patient ST-RELA tumours but 
not from other tumours subtypes (Mack et al., 2018) (Figure 3.17) and re-capitulate the 
enriched pathways identified from expression profiling of ST-RELA subgroup tumours 
(Figure 3.16) (Pajtler et al., 2015).  
 We focused our subsequent molecular dissections using L1CAM as a reporter for the 
presence of C11orf95 translocations (Figures 3.7), due to its high expression in patient 
primary samples (Gessi et al., 2019; Mack et al., 2018; Malgulwar et al., 2018; Parker et al., 
2014) and induction in our cellular models (Figure 3.7). Any number of C11orf95 ZFs fused 
to a TAD-containing protein (e.g., RELA, YAP1) results in up-regulation of L1CAM 
transcript and protein (Figures 3.7-3.11). Furthermore, removing the ZF domain, the C2H2 
amino acids comprising the ZF, or a point mutation of the final Histidine residue (H149A), 
results in failure to up-regulate L1CAM by C11-RELAFUS1 (Figure 3.13). Taken together, 
these data demonstrate that C11orf95 ZFs serve as a novel DNA-binding module for the c-
terminal partner (i.e., RELA or YAP1), resulting in a common ZF-directed genomic 
signature (Figure 3.6).  
 This is supported by the demonstration that different C11orf95-YAP1 fusions are 
capable of up-regulating the full consortia of the CRgsig (Figures 3.11-12). Importantly, 
YAP1 is not a transcription factor itself, unlike RELA, and has no intrinsic DNA-binding 
domain; the TEAD proteins are the DNA-binding module of the Hippo pathway (Meng et al., 
Chapter 3: C11orf95 Fusions are Chimeric Transcription Factors. 
2016; Pajtler et al., 2019; Yu and Guan, 2013). We clearly demonstrate that C11orf95s ZFs 
co-opt YAP1s function as a transcriptional co-activator (Figures 3.11-12). 
 Finally, we generated genome-wide profiles of the active (H3K4me1, H3K27ac, 
H3K36me3) and repressed (H3K27me3, H2AK119ub) chromatin landscape in mNSCs 
expressing C11-RELAFUS1 and an isogenic empty vector control (Figure 3.18). Combining 
this epigenomics mapping with our transcriptome profiles allowed us to identify a group of 
highly co-regulated targets of C11-RELAFUS1 (Figures 3.19-20) and to define the necessity 
of these putative genetic targets in a testable murine model (Figure 3.20A). One of these up-
regulated targets is the gene Ngfr, a neurotrophin-binding receptor in the Trk family 
(Bartkowska et al., 2010; Dechant and Barde, 2002; Meakin and Shooter, 1992; Zampieri and 
Chao, 2006)   which we observe is up-regulated in all our in vitro and in vivo models of 
C11orf95-RELA fusion ependymoma (Figures 3.20-22). Surprisingly, genetic deletion of 
Ngfr accelerates tumour initiation in our murine orthotopic allograft model (Figure 3.24). 
These data suggest that the Ngfr protein is not necessary for tumour initiation by C11orf95-
RELA in a genetically relevant mouse implant model, irrespective of its high expression and 
utility as a marker of transformed cells in vivo (Figure 3.23). Further work is needed to 
characterize the genetic targets of C11orf95 translocations and will help elucidate therapeutic 
vulnerabilities for this patient population.

4 C11ORF95 FUSIONS CO-OPT 
TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATORS. 
4.1 Introduction. 
Our work in Chapter 3 show the ZFs of C11orf95 endow two novel functions to the fused c-
terminal partner: sustained nuclear localization and aberrant genomic occupancy. Both of 
these functions synergize in generating a common ZF-mediated genomic signature that is up-
regulated by other C11orf95 translocations that have alternate c-terminal partners that are not 
RELA (i.e., YAP1). However, the mechanism by which C11orf95 translocations promote 
gene transcription once inside the nucleus remains to be determined. In this chapter we will 
molecularly dissect these fusion transcription factors using proteomics and transcriptomics to 
identify their protein interactomes and essential proteins domains necessary for in vitro 
function and in vivo transformation.  
 Transcription factors are notoriously stubborn drug targets (Bushweller, 2019; 
Darnell, 2002); an often more reliable and fruitful approach is synthetic lethality through 
partner proteins necessary for their downstream functions (Arrowsmith et al., 2012; Copeland 
et al., 2010; Helin and Dhanak, 2013). The NF-B transcription factor complex, upon 
stimulation, translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus forming homo- or hetero-dimers 
(via their shared RHD regions) and bind to B DNA-binding sites. These transcription factors 
then utilize various chromatin remodelers, histone acetyltransferases, and transcriptional co-
activator proteins to initiate gene transcription (Baltimore, 2016; Napetschnig and Wu, 2013; 
Naugler and Karin, 2008; Smale, 2011; Zhang et al., 2017). Almost all of these co-activator 
interactions are mediated through the trans-activation domain (TAD), a region essential for 
gene activation by these proteins (Natoli, 2012).  
 As observed in the previous chapter, C11orf95-RELA fusions are strong 
transriptional activators of ZF-directed targets. However, the contributions of their 
endogenous DNA-binding domains (i.e., the RHD for RELA) and TAD interactors to their 
overall functions remain to be determined. Mapping of the protein interactome of these 
Chapter 4: C11orf95 fusions co-opt transcriptional activators. 
translocations will provide critical insight into the basic mechanisms underlying their 
oncogenic functions and may shed light on potential druggable partner proteins. Various 
methods currently exist to identify protein partners of transcription factors, almost all of 
which rely on antibody-mediated pulldown followed by mass spectrometry to identify 
interacting peptides. Alternate methods using chemical cross-links (e.g., RIME) or proximity 
biotinylation (e.g., BioID) can also provide deeper insights into the interactome of a protein 
of interest (Ten Have et al., 2011; Mohammed et al., 2016; Papachristou et al., 2018; Roux et 
al., 2013). Not one tool, technique, or protocol is superior to the other and most can provide 
an accurate description of a protiens interactome; however, multiple biological and technical 
replicates are necessary to generate a convincing profile (Ten Have et al., 2011).  
 To gain insights into the protein interactomes of C11orf95 translocations we utilized 
the updated qPLEX-RIME technique (as well as non-crosslinking IP-MS). We followed this 
through with various gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments to validate the 
essential domains required for these protein interactions and transcriptional function of these 
fusions. Furthermore, we show that the histone acetyltransferase EP300, a canonical RELA 
protein interactor, is a potential mediator of C11-RELAFUS1 function and can phenocopy 
RELA. Finally, we dissect the essential domains in C11orf95-RELA translocations necessary 
for neural stem cell transformation in vivo, which highlight the dispensability of the RHD 
domain but not the ZF or TAD regions.

4.2 Results. 
4.2.1 Protein interactomes of C11orf95-RELA fusions with qPLEX-RIME. 
We have identified two common phenotypes of different C11orf95 translocations: sustained 
nuclear localization and aberrant up-regulation of a common genetic signature. However, 
ZFs are known to mediate interactions with nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) as well as proteins 
(Klug, 2010; Najafabadi et al., 2015). To query this, we utilized the in-house developed 
qPLEX-RIME methodology (Mohammed et al., 2016; Papachristou et al., 2018) to define 
and quantify sensitive interactors of our proteins of interest (RELA, C11orf95, and C11-
RELAFUS1). qPLEX-RIME is a proximity-based experiment and requires a double cross-link 
(DSG+formaldehyde), followed by nuclei enrichment, sonication, and antibody-mediated 
pulldown (Papachristou et al., 2018). Downstream sample preparation and mass-spec analysis 
is performed by the CI Proteomics facility; analysis of peptide spectral counts and differential 
binding analysis for each contrast was performed by CI Bioinformatics core facility (see 
methods section for full details).  
 To generate qPLEX-RIME profiles we utilized a 3x-HA c-terminal tag on our 
proteins of interest that is stably expressed and our transient HEK293 model (Figure 4.1A). 
We confirm near equivalent expression of our cDNAs of interest as well as induction of 
control target genes (i.e., L1CAM and IB/NFKBIA) before samples (conditions: empty 
vector control, RELA, C11orf95, and C11-RELAFUS1) were taken forward with the qPLEX-
RIME protocol. To identify novel interactors of the C11-RELAFUS1 fusion we focused our 
analysis on contrasts with the wild-type proteins (C11orf95 or RELA) using a significance 
cut-off for enriched peptide interactors (adj. p val. <0.05; see methods section for details) 
(Figures 4.1B-D and 4.2). As shown in Figure 4.2, C11-RELAFUS1 interactome enriches for 
various chromatin remodelers and transcriptional co-activators, including but not limited to: 
SWI/SNF, Mediator complex, and the Tip60/STAGA (TRRAP-containing) histone acetylase 
complex. This enrichment also includes many proteins involved in transcription initiation 
(GTF proteins), elongation (EIF proteins), as well as proteins in the RNA polymerase II 
holoenzyme (Figure 4.2). We identified these complexes among the enriched proteins using 
the CORUM database, an annotated resource of mammalian protein complexes (Giurgiu et 
al., 2019; Ruepp et al., 2009). These data suggest the C11-RELAFUS1 protein is a 
transcriptional regulator and it mediates these functions through recruitment of diverse 
partner proteins (Figures 4.2).  
Chapter 4: C11orf95 fusions co-opt transcriptional activators. 
 Curiously, various members of the NuRD repressor complex are detected in our 
qPLEX-RIME dataset (Figures 4.2); we believe, this is more than likely a by-product of the 
experimental cross-linking protocol. The NuRD complex is recruited to acetylated histones 
and removes these activation marks (via the HDAC1/2 proteins) to initiate gene repression 
(Denslow and Wade, 2007; Lai and Wade, 2011). Active competition and stochastic presence 
of these activator/repressor enzyme complexes for promoters/enhancers has been 
demonstrated in the literature (e.g., SWI/SNF, PRC, NuRD) (Bracken et al., 2019; Kadoch et 
al., 2016). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that C11-RELAFUS1 may repress some 
target genes by recruitment of these HDAC-containing complexes; as shown in the previous 
chapter, a minor subset of genes are down-regulated following over-expression of C11-
RELAFUS1 (12% of total DEG are FC<1 by C11-RELAFUS1).  
 Analysis of the enriched peptides interacting with C11orf95 (vs. C11-RELAFUS1 or 
wild-type RELA) confirm a substantial representation for proteins found inside the nucleolus 
(Figures 4.2). Despite both C11-RELAFUS1 and C11orf95 having nuclear localization and 
sharing genomic occupancy, they appear to have distinct protein interactomes: C11orf95 
interacts with proteins that have nucleolar functions but not any of the transcriptional 
regulators bound with C11-RELAFUS1 (Figures 4.2). This supports a role for C11orf95 in the 
nucleus but not necessarily in direct regulation of gene transcription. This aligns with our 
data in the previous chapter where over-expression of C11orf95 has minimal impact on 
differential expression. 
 In summation, these qPLEX-RIME data suggest the C11-RELAFUS1 protein is 
trafficked into the nucleus and onto chromatin by C11orf95s ZF, but does not appear to 
cause substantial divergence from the canonical NF-B/RELA interactome which is known 
to utilize these chromatin remodelers and transcriptional co-factors (Figure 4.2) (Brown et 
al., 2014; Hayden and Ghosh, 2012; Huang et al., 2009; Module et al., 2009; Natoli, 2012; 
Oeckinghaus and Ghosh, 2009; Schmidt et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017). We note that in our 
qPLEX-RIME analysis of wild-type RELA (Figure 4.2) we do not observe many significant 
interactions with some of these complexes that are known to interact with NF-B (e.g., 
SWI/SNF); however, we believe this might be due to the harsh nature of the qPLEX-RIME 
protocol (sonication, cross-linking). To address this, we repeated this experiment using 
traditional IP-MS.

4.2.2 Protein interactomes of C11orf95-RELA fusions with IP-MS. 
To confirm these data were not merely artefacts of the DSG/formaldehyde cross-links during 
the qPLEX-RIME protocol, we replicated this dataset using non-crosslinking IP-MS with an 
identical protocol (excluding sonication and cross-links) (Figure 4.3A-C). Pulldown of 
RELA and C11-RELAFUS1 identifies nearly the entire NF-B complex and associated 
proteins (IB, IKK) (Figure 4.3A-C). Similar to the qPLEX-RIME methods, peptides 
enriched with C11-RELAFUS1 over RELA and C11orf95 are primarily nuclear transcriptional 
regulators and co-activators (e.g., SWI/SNF, Mediator, Tip60/SAGA histone acetylase 
complex), as well as the NF-B complex itself (Figure 4.4). This also includes the basal 
transcriptional machinery (GTFs), transcriptional elongation factors (EIF proteins), and 
members of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex (Figure 4.4).  
 However, unlike our qPLEX-RIME data in Figure 4.2A, we detect significant 
enrichment for many of these complexes with our wild-type RELA samples as well (e.g., 
SWI/SNF, Mediator, Tip60/SAGA, etc) (Figure 4.4), highlighting the limitations of the 
qPLEX-RIME protocol. We presume that this is more than likely due to the burying of 
peptides caused by the double crosslinks and disruption of protein interactions when samples 
are sonicated during the protocol (Papachristou et al., 2018). We note that the association of 
RELA and the NF-B complex with these transcriptional co-regulators/activators is 
extensively documented in the literature (Brown et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2010; Huang et al., 
2009; Napetschnig and Wu, 2013). We dont observe interactions of C11orf95 with any 
proteins in the NF-B complex; instead we highlight the significant presence of nucleolar-
enriched proteins (e.g., UBTF, NPM1/3, FBL, etc) (Figure 4.4) which we also observed in 
the qPLEX-RIME experiments.  
 In summation, these IP-MS and qPLEX-RIME in principle reproduce one another 
(Figures 4.2 and 4.4). We note that there are clear limitations of the double-crosslinks 
utilized in qPLEX-RIME, which may result in peptides being buried or lost during the 
sonication or cross-linking process. Both techniques should be utilized to identify high 
confident protein partners for future experiments.

4.2.3 Protein interactomes of C11orf95-YAP1 fusions with qPLEX-RIME. 
We generated qPLEX-RIME profiles of C11orf95-YAP1 fusions, including the  mutants we 
created to mimic C11-RELAFUS1 and C11-RELAFUS2 (ZF2-4 and ZF3-4), and wild-type 
YAP1 protein (Figure 4.5A). We first compared the interactomes of each of these C11-
YAP1 fusions to the interactome of wild-type YAP1 (Figure 4.5B-D). We aggregated the 
enriched peptides (adj. p val. < 0.05) for all three C11-YAP1 fusions (containing 4ZF, 2ZF, 
or 1ZF fused to YAP1) compared to wild-type YAP1 or the inverse (enriched with YAP1 
over the three C11-YAP1 fusions) to generate a consensus overlap set of interacting proteins 
(Figure 4.6A). As shown in Figure 4.6A, this analysis identifies 173 unique proteins that are 
enriched with the three C11-YAP1 fusions and 112 that are enriched with wild-type YAP1. 
The high number of proteins interacting with all three C11-YAP1 fusions is consistent with 
our data that all 3 C11-YAP1 proteins up-regulate common genetic targets (previous 
chapter), and thus, may not have a substantially different protein interactome. When we 
directly contrast the interactomes of these C11-YAP1 mutants against one another (Figure 
4.7) and apply a fold change cut-off of 1 in either direction (gained or lost), very few proteins 
aside from C11orf95 itself, breaches past this cut-off (Figure 4.8).  
 We analysed the most significant enriched peptides (FC>1; adj. p val. <0.05) for 
YAP1 or C11-YAP1 using Gene Ontology and the CORUM database (Figure 4.6C). 
Enriched YAP1 protein interactome identifies Hippo pathway regulators and proteins 
associated with cadherin binding, cell junctions, and cytoskeleton (Figure 4.6C). This data 
confirms the mechano-sensitive regulation of YAP1 (Harvey et al., 2013; Meng et al., 2016; 
Yu and Guan, 2013); we note this regulatory system does not seem to affect the C11-YAP1 
fusions, nor are these proteins found enriched in the C11-YAP1 interactomes (Figures 4.5-6). 
All three C11-YAP1 fusions significantly interact with transcriptional co-regulators like 
NuA4/Tip60 histone acetylase complex, SAGA complex, and DNA topoisomerase (Figure 
4.6C). Similar to RELA and C11orf95-RELA, these proteins have been defined as mediators 
of YAP1 and Hippo pathway transcriptional activation (Meng et al., 2016; Yu and Guan, 
2013). These qPLEX-RIME data for C11orf95-YAP1 fusions and wild-type YAP1 largely 
confirm the biggest difference between these proteins appears to be their differential cellular 
compartment localization (YAP1 in the cytoplasm and C11orf95-YAP1 proteins in the 
nucleus). Thus, similar to C11orf95-RELA, the fusion of C11or95-YAP1 does not seem to 
substantially alter or disrupt the known nuclear interactome of the YAP1 co-activator (Wang 
et al., 2014).

4.2.4 C11orf95-RELA interacts with the NF-B complex. 
Our interactome analyses of the C11-RELAFUS1 protein using both cross-linking qPLEX-
RIME and non cross-linking IP-MS identify substantial interactions with various 
transcriptional regulators and also the core NF-B complex (Figure 4.8A). These suggests 
that the ZF gained in the C11-RELAFUS1 fusion (from C11orf95) does not appear to 
substantially alter the C11-RELAFUS1 ability to interact with the endogenous NF-B 
interactome via its Rel homology domain (RHD) and trans-activation domain (TAD) 
(Napetschnig and Wu, 2013). Although there are some differences between RELA and C11-
RELAFUS1 in our protein interactomes, this is more than likely due to their partioning into 
different cellular compartments; i.e., the C11-RELAFUS1 protein pulls down more 
transcriptional regulators and nuclear proteins due to its almost exclusive nuclear localization, 
whereas RELA is primarily cytoplasmic.  
 To confirm this ability of the C11-RELAFUS1 protein to directly interact with the 
transcription factors of the NF-B complex (Figure 4.8A), we performed Co-IP of 3x-HA 
tagged proteins from both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (Figure 4.8B). As shown in 
Figure 4.8B, both RELA and C11-RELAFUS1 directly interact with the endogenous RELA 
and NF-B complex (RELB, RELC, NFKB1, NFKB2), as well as the IB inhibitor proteins 
(IB, IB). The NFKB1 and NFKB2 proteins are proteolytically cleaved into their active 
forms prior to nuclear translocation (p105p50; p100p52) and the C11-RELAFUS1 protein 
interacts with all forms of NFKB1 and NFKB2 present (excluding the p52 isoform of 
NFKB2, which does not appear to be expressed under these conditions) (Figure 4.8B). 
Similar to our interactome data (qPLEX-RIME and IP-MS), we never observe any 
endogenous interactions of C11orf95 with the NF-B complex by Co-IP, suggesting 
C11orf95 is not involved in the NF-B signaling pathway (Figure 4.8B).  
 We confirmed this interaction with endogenous Rela by C11-RELAFUS1 in our 
mEPN model (Figure 4.9A). To validate if the endogenous Rela protein is required for C11-
RELAFUS1 function and tumour initiation, we generated three independent CRISPR sgRNAs 
targeting the murine Rela gene. Immunoblot for stable mEPN cells expressing sgLuc 
(control) or one of these sgRelas shows varying levels of protein knockdown (Figure 4.9B). 
We intracranially implanted 1x105 mEPN cells expressing either the sgLuc or most efficient 
sgRela (>80% Rela protein knockdown) into the brains of immunocompromised to assess 
their tumorigenic competence. Kaplann-Meier analysis of brain tumour free survival show a

modest acceleration of tumour formation in sgRela expressing mEPN cells compared to the 
sgLuc cohort (Figure 4.9C). Histological analysis of tumours from either cohort show 
identical tumours with similar phenotypes and features (Figure 4.9D) and thus leads us to 
conclude that endogenous Rela is dispensable for C11-RELAFUS1 in vivo tumourgenic 
competence.

factors that are capable of forming homo- and hetero-dimers (through their RHD regions): 3 
contain trans-activation domains (RELA-C) and two do not (NFKB1, NFBK2). NFKB1 and 
NFKB2 (p100, p105) are protelytically cleaved (at the dashed red line) into their active forms 
(p52, p50); this is necessary for nuclear translocation. All five of these proteins are kept in the 
cytoplasm under basal conditions by the IB family of proteins (IB). B. Immunoblot

4.2.5 C11orf95-RELA interacts with transcriptional co-activators and 
chromatin remodelers. 
We queried our C11-RELAFUS1 interactome data to identify and validate potential 
downstream protein partners that mediate this transcriptional activator function on chromatin. 
Using Co-IP, we show that the C11-RELAFUS1 protein interacts with the BET protein BRD4, 
histone acetyltransferase EP300, and two members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling 
complex (BRG1/SMARCA4, BAF47/SMARCB1) (Figure 4.10). Unsurprisingly, RELA and 
NF-kB have been shown to utilize these partner proteins in various other model systems 
(Huang et al., 2009; Limpert et al., 2013; Mukherjee et al., 2013; Natoli, 2009, 2012). These 
data are consistent with a model by which the interactome of the c-terminal partner protein is 
co-opted by C11orf95 ZFs to promote aberrant gene activation.  
 We replaced the RELA coding sequence in the C11-RELAFUS1 protein with the 
histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain of EP300 to generate a C11orf95-EP300 fusion 
(Figure 4.11A). Transient over-expression of the C11orf95-EP300 results in up-regulation of 
several genetic targets we have defined as targets of C11orf95 fusions (e.g., L1CAM, 
CCND1, and NGFR) (Figure 4.11A). We generated transcriptomes from HEK293 cells 
transiently over-expressing eGFP control or C11orf95-EP300 (harboring a c-terminal eGFP 
tag to monitor cell expression) and observe substantial variance between the two sample 
groups (Figure 4.11B). Both C11orf95-EP300 and C11-RELAFUS1 (as shown in the previous 
chapter; Figure 3.7E) induce the CRgsig (Pajtler et al., 2015), but wild-type C11orf95 and 
RELA do not (Figure 4.11C). Several examples are shown in Figure 4.11D of C11orf95-
EP300 up-regulation of these targets in this RNA-seq dataset. These data show that the ZFs 
of C11orf95 direct the TAD interacting proteins (e.g., EP300) of the c-terminal gene (i.e., 
RELA) to novel genetic loci.  
 To test the requirement of EP300 HAT activity for C11-RELAFUS1 function we 
exposed mEPN cells to increasing doses of A-485, a catalytic site inhibitor of EP300 (Lasko 
et al., 2017), and observe down-regulation of l H3K27ac (positive control) and of the C11-
RELAFUS1 target Ngfr (Figure 4.12A). This suggests that C11-RELAFUS1 fusion may mediate 
some of it transcriptional activation functions through this interaction with the EP300 histone 
acetyltransferase (Figure 4.10). We devleoped three independent sgRNAs targeting Ep300 
gene and generate stable mEPN lines expresing these (Figure 4.12B) and observe depletion 
the fusion genetic target Ngfr on protein level following chronic knockdown of p300 protein 
Chapter 4: C11orf95 fusions co-opt transcriptional activators. 
(Figure 4.12C). Further examination of A-485/HAT inhibitors and the cellular consequences 
of genetic deletions of Ep300 as a potential therapeutic intervention for C11orf95 fusion are 
ongoing.  
 These protein interactome studies support a mechanism by which C11orf95-RELA 
and C11orf95-YAP1 fusions retain the nuclear interactome of the c-terminal partner. This 
suggests the TAD regions (and their repsective protein partners) are the mediators of the 
transcriptional activation we observe. To directly test this, we generated TAD mutants for 
C11-RELAFUS1 and C11-YAP1 ZF2-4, both containing only ZF1 from C11orf95 fused to 
the c-terminal protein (Figure 4.13A). Transient over-expression of controls (empty vector, 
RELA, YAP1) or the TAD mutants fail to up-regulate L1CAM; whereas, the C11-
RELAFUS1 and C11-YAP1 mutant (ZF2-4) have near equi-potent induction of L1CAM 
(Figure 4.13B). The very minor induction of L1CAM protein by the TAD mutants is more 
than likely due to the ZFs directing the TAD mutant to the L1CAM locus and the intact 
RHDs ability to recruit endogenous TAD-containing NF-B proteins to the target.

4.2.6 Protein interactomes of C11orf95-RELAFUS1 mutants. 
C11orf95-RELA fusion proteins contains three generic protein domains: the C2H2 ZF from 
C11orf95, the RHD from RELA, and TAD from RELA. Our data thus far demonstrate the 
C11-RELAFUS1 retains the ability to assemble into the NF-B complex (via the RHD) 
(Figure 4.8) and interact with partner proteins that regulate transcription through its TAD 
region (Figure 4.10). We performed qPLEX-RIME on the full-length C11-RELAFUS1 and the 
 mutants with these regions removed (Figure 4.14A) to identify and quantify interactors lost 
by the  mutants (ZF, RHD, TAD) (Figures 4.14B-D). As predicted, ablation of the 
RHD from the C11-RELAFUS1 protein depletes the NF- complex members from the 
pulldown of RHD (Figures 4.14C and 4.15).  
 We aggregated the proteins enriched for C11-RELAFUS1 protein over the 3  
mutants and analysed them using the CORUM database (Figure 4.15). These data are 
summarized as such: Loss of the ZF, results in re-localization of the ZF mutant into the 
cytoplasm (as described in the previous chapter) and subsequent depleted interactions with all 
of the transcriptional co-activators and chromatin remodelers bound to C11-RELAFUS1 
(Figure 4.15). Deletion of the TAD region depletes several complexes necessary for RNA 
Polymerase II function, most notably the Mediator complex, but also several histone 
acetyltransferase containing complexes (EP300/CBP; TRRAP containing complexes: 
Tip60/NuA4, STAGA). Curiously, the loss of the TAD has minimal effect on the association 
with the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodelling complex (Figure 4.15). Removing the RHD 
region from C11-RELAFUS1 hinders this protein from binding the other NF-B complex 
members (Figure 4.15), which we further validate using non-crosslinking Co-IP from both 
the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 4.16). We do note that there is a reduction in some 
interactions of the RHD mutant with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., Mediator complex) 
(Figure 4.15), which we presume is due to the RHD mutants decreased presence in the 
nucleus (previous chapter; Figures 3.3-4).  
 These data support our previous qPLEX-RIME experiments showing that the ZF 
promotes nuclear accumulation of the C11-RELAFUS1 protein, bringing it into association 
with these transcriptional co-activator complexes from which it is normally sequestered in the 
cytoplasm away from (Figure 4.15).

4.2.7 Transcriptomes of C11orf95-RELAFUS1 mutants. 
We generated transcriptomes from HEK293 cells transiently (48 hr) expressing the full-
length C11-RELAFUS1 or the three  mutants of interest: ZF, RHD, TAD (Figure 4.17). 
Transcriptomes from each sample cluster together by PCA (Figure 4.17A). Hierarchial 
clustering of samples based on Top 200 differentially expressed genes shows the RHD 
mutant and C11-RELAFUS1 are the most similar (Figure 4.17B). These transcriptome data 
suggest that the ablation of the RHD region from C11-RELAFUS1 and subsequent loss of all 
NF-B DNA-binding and complex dimerization, is dispensable for target gene induction 
(Figure 4.18A). Nearly all of the genes up-regulated by C11-RELAFUS1 in the CRgsig are 
also up-regulated by the RHD mutant but not by the ZF or TAD mutants (Figure 4.18B). 
 We analyzed the top differentially expressed genes for each mutant (contrasted to 
the full-length C11-RELAFUS1 protein) using DESeq2 pipeline in our transient RNA-seq 
experiment (Figure 4.18B). Loss of the ZF from C11-RELAFUS1 results in exclusive up-
regulation of NF-B genetic targets (Figure 4.18B). The loss of the ZF, produces a protein 
that replicates the behaviors of wild-type RELA: primaryil cytoplasmic and exclusive 
activation of B genetic targets (Figure 4.18C). The RHD mutant induces near equi-potent 
levels of the defined C11orf95/ZF-directed genetic targets (e.g., L1CAM, IGF2, etc.) but is 
deficient in induction of NF-B genetic targets (Figure 4.18C). Finally, the TAD mutant 
which retains both the ZF and RHD regions (and henceforth their DNA-binding domains), is 
unable to activate any genetic targets (Figure 4.18B). These data show that the C11-
RELAFUS1 protein contains two DNA-binding regions, the ZF and RHD, and a c-terminal 
TAD region which is co-opted from the RELA protein (Figure 4.18A).

4.2.8 ZF and TAD are indispensable for C11orf95-RELA in vivo 
transformation. 
To test these domain requirements in vivo, we generated parallel isogenic stable cell lines in 
mNSCs (Cdkn2aKO) expressing each of the  mutants or the full-length C11-RELAFUS1 
protein delivered by lentiviruses (Figure 4.19A). We stereotactically inoculated 1x106 cells 
intracranially into the brains of immunocompromised mice to assess tumorigenic initiation 
capacity of each of these  mutants compared to the full-length C11-RELAFUS1 protein. 
Kaplann-Meier survival curve showing brain tumour free survival is shown in Figure 4.19B. 
Similar to published data (Kim et al., 2019; Ozawa et al., 2018; Pajtler et al., 2019; Parker et 
al., 2014), C11-RELAFUS1 expressing mNSCs generate intracranial brain tumours (median 
survival, 118 days) (Figure 4.19B), that are immunoreactive for nuclear Rela (Figure 4.20). 
In contrast, no mice from the ZF or TAD mutant cohorts succumbed to tumours 
(surveillance = 225 days post-implantation) (Figure 4.19B). The RHD mutant cohort of 
mice also generate intracranial tumours, albeit with a delay compared to the full-length 
protein (median survival, 159 days). These RHD expressing cells form tumours with similar 
histology to the full-length protein (Figure 4.20), however, they display decreased 
immunoreactivity for nuclear Rela (Figure 4.20).  
 To address this discrepancy, we genreated transcriptomes from these mNSC stable 
lines (Figures 4.21A-B). Similar to our transient HEK293 model, the RHD and full-length 
C11-RELAFUS1 fusion generate transcriptomes that are more similar to one another, than they 
are to the tumourigenic incompetent ZF and TAD mutants (Figure 4.21A-B). The RHD 
mutant although transcriptionally and tumourigenically competent, appears moderately 
weaker than the full-length C11-RELAFUS1 protein in our stable mNSCs (Figure 4.21). We 
postulate that this is most likely due to (a) decreased presence in the nucleus of this mutant 
and (b) an inability to generate a homodimer (via the RHD) at the DNA interface necessary 
for sustained activation of genetic targets by transcription factors.

4.3 Summary. 
In this chapter, we have used various proteomics methodologies to identify the interactomes 
of C11orf95-RELA and C11orf95-YAP1 fusions as well as their wild-type counterparts 
(RELA, YAP1, C11orf95). C11orf95 translocations, irrespective of the c-terminal partner, do 
not appear to diverge from the canonical nuclear RELA or YAP1 protein interactome 
(Figures 4.2, 4.4, 4.6). These data support our hypothesis that these C11orf95-RELA fusions 
function as aberrant transcription factors and contain two distinct DNA-binding regions (i.e., 
ZF and RHD) and an indispensable trans-activation domain (TAD). As observed in the 
previous chapter, the ZFs of C11orf95 direct the genomic occupancy of the C11orf95-RELA 
fusion, resulting in a common transcriptome up-regulated by all C11orf95 fusions (C11-
RELA, C11-YAP1). This model is consistent for the other tested C11orf95 fusions (e.g., 
C11-YAP1) and suggest a common co-option of the TAD region to mediate oncogenic 
transformation by these ZF-directed chimeric transcription factors.  
 When comparing the interactomes of C11orf95 fusions to their wild-type 
counterparts (RELA or YAP1), we primarily observe cytoplasmic regulators of the NF-B or 
Hippo pathway depleted from the interactomes of C11orf95-RELA or C11orf95-YAP1, 
which is consistent with the cellular compartment segregation observed for these proteins. 
This suggests a bi-partite mechanism for C11orf95 ZFs functioning as both a putative 
nuclear localization signal (NLS) and novel DNA-binding domain. Deletion of the ZF from 
C11-RELAFUS1 pulls the protein back into the cytoplasm and returns this protein to behaving 
like wild-type RELA, exclusively up-regulating NF-B genetic targets and unable to generate 
tumours in our murine allograft model (Figures 4.17-4.19).   
 Surprisingly, loss of endogenous Rela or removal of the entire RHD region 
(responsible for NF-B complex assembly and DNA-binding) from C11-RELAFUS1 are both 
dispensable for tumour initiation (Figures 4.9 and 4.19). Despite robust interactions with 
every member of the NF-B complex by C11-RELAFUS1 (Figure 4.8), this region is not 
absolutely required for tumour initiation (Figure 4.19). Mouse tumours generated from cells 
expressing the RHD mutant are molecularly and histologically identical to tumours arising 
from the full-length C11-RELAFUS1 expressing cells (Figures 4.19-4.21). This confirms that 
the ZF from C11orf95 is the major source of transcriptional variation detected in cells 
transiently or stably expressing C11orf95-RELA fusions and not sustained activation of NF-
B as previously believed (Ozawa et al., 2018; Parker et al., 2014). However, we do note that 
Chapter 4: C11orf95 fusions co-opt transcriptional activators. 
tumours from the RHD variant of C11-RELAFUS1 are delayed in penetrance and have 
increased latency, which we believe is caused by their inability to generate homo-dimers 
(necessary for sustained activation of genetic targets by transcription factors) and decreased 
presence in the nucleus (defined in the previous chapter).  
 Finally, transcription factors (including the NF-B complex) regulate gene 
expression through the recruitment of partner protein and co-regulators through their TAD 
regions (Wan and Lenardo, 2009). Consistent with this model, ablation of the TAD region 
from C11-RELAFUS1 impairs the ability to induce CRgsig targets (Figures 4.17-4.18 and 
4.21) and tumourigenic incompetence in our implant model (Figure 4.19). Transcriptomes 
and protein interactomes of C11-RELAFUS1 TAD mutants suggest a complete inability to 
activate transcription compared to the full-length protein, and a loss of many of these co-
regulators from their protein interactome (e.g., Mediator complex, EP300, NuA4/Tip60 and 
STAGA complex) (Figure 4.15). These TAD interactors largely converge on chromatin 
remodelers and transcriptional co-regulators, many of which have been previously defined in 
the literature as responsible for NF-B transcriptional activation (Karin, 2006; Module et al., 
2009; Napetschnig and Wu, 2013; Naugler and Karin, 2008). Furthermore, using gain-of-
function experiments, we demonstrate that RELA can be pheno-copied by EP300, a histone 
acetyltransferase (Figure 4.11). Further analyses of the essentiality of Ep300 in C11-
RELAFUS1 expressing mouse ependymoma cells ongoing using HAT inhibitors (e.g., A-485) 
and CRISPR-mediated genetic deletion are ongoing.  
 In summation, the data in this chapter data confirm the ability of the ZFs of 
C11orf95 to promote nuclear localization and aberrant genomic occupancy (as shown by 
DZF mutant of C11-RELAFUS1 reverting back to functioning as RELA) of C11-RELAFUS1 but 
does not dramatically alter the NF-B protein interactome. The TAD region from C11-
RELAFUS1 (and also C11-YAP1) is absolutely essential for in vitro function and in vivo 
transformation, whereas all NF-B dimerization and DNA-binding (via the RHD) are 
dispensable for in vivo tumour initiation. We summarize this chapters finding in a model 
highlighting the various transcriptional co-activators and complexes identified in our 
proteomics studies and how each domain in C11-RELAFUS1 (ZF, RHD, TAD) contributes to 
the proteins overall functions and oncogenic potential (Figure 4.22).

5 DISCUSSION 
5.1 Sustained nuclear translocation of C11orf95 fusions. 
Highly recurrent chromosome 11q translocations define supratentorial ependymomas (Parker 
et al., 2014). These structural variations almost always produce rearrangements between the 
C11orf95 gene of unknown function and RELA, the principal nuclear effector of NF-B 
signalling (Pajtler et al., 2015; Parker et al., 2014; Pietsch et al., 2014). Over-expression of 
C11orf95-RELA fusions in neural stem cells, the cell-of-origin for forebrain ependymomas 
(Taylor et al., 2005), results in rapid brain tumour formation in various murine models that 
molecularly and histologically resemble patient disease (Kim et al., 2019; Ozawa et al., 2018; 
Pajtler et al., 2019; Parker et al., 2014). Lower frequency c-terminal partners for C11orf95 
have also been detected in primary specimens by us and others (Parker et al., 2014; Pietsch et 
al., 2014). These include fusions of C11orf95 with YAP1, MAML2, NCOA1, and several 
others that are currently unpublished (Pfister Group, DKFZ). All of these alternate c-terminal 
partners are also transcriptional regulators like RELA (Liu et al., 2017) which led us to 
hypothesize if there was a common mechanism underlying all C11orf95 translocations.  
 When we started this PhD, we intended to exclusively study the most frequent 
C11orf95-RELA fusion (C11-RELAFUS1) (Pajtler et al., 2015; Parker et al., 2014). However, 
over the course of our experimental testing we came to an understanding that the presumed 
driver of the disease was not RELA or NF-B signalling, but the previously uncharacterized 
C11orf95 gene. As described throughout Chapter 3, two novel functions are endowed to the 
c-terminal partner upon fusion to C11orf95 ZFs: sustained nuclear localization and aberrant 
DNA/chromatin targeting. Both of these functions synergize in promoting a novel C11orf95 
fusion ZF-mediated genomics signature in vitro which mimics the ST-RELA subgroup 
molecular signature seen in patient tumours (referred to as the CRgsig).  
 In our initial studies, we observed C11-RELAFUS1 translocates into the nucleus 
independent of traditional NF-B pathway stimulation (e.g., TNF) (Parker et al., 2014), 
suggesting a bypass of the endogenous mechanisms that regulate the NF-B pathway 
(Hayden and Ghosh, 2014; Napetschnig and Wu, 2013). This nuclear saturation of C11-
Chapter 5: Discussion 
RELAFUS1 in our model systems recapitulates observations in primary ependymomas of 
intense nuclear RELA staining in tumour cells (Gessi et al., 2019; Malgulwar et al., 2018; 
Pietsch et al., 2014). However, the cellular localization of wild-type C11orf95, the other 
oncogenic C11orf95-RELA fusion (e.g., C11-RELAFUS2), or c-terminal partners identified 
(i.e., YAP1, MAML2) were never examined. Surprisingly, C11orf95 and all three C11orf95 
fusions of interest (C11-RELAFUS1, C11-RELAFUS2, C11-YAP1) partition into the nuclear 
compartment, where they are segregated from wild-type RELA and YAP1 (both enriched in 
the cytoplasm).  
 The common nuclear localization of these structurally disparate C11orf95 
translocations suggests the 4 ZFs of C11orf95 may each function as nuclear localization 
signals (NLS) - a phenomenon that is not an uncommon feature of C2H2-type ZFs 
(Hatayama et al., 2008; Ito et al., 2009; Mingot et al., 2009; Shimojo et al., 2001; Yamasaki 
et al., 2005). Direct analysis of the primary peptide sequence of human C11orf95 using 
NLSMapper identified four predicted NLS sequences that are encoded inside each ZF. This is 
unsurprising as each ZF in C11orf95 are highly homologous to one another, suggesting some 
level of redundancy, and thus supporting this common phenotype of different C11orf95 
translocations.  
 Experimentally, we support this ZF/NLS mechanism by showing that direct 
fusions of various amounts of C11orf95 ZFs (e.g., ZF1, ZF1-2, ZF1-4) to either RELA, 
YAP1, and even eGFP alone promote nuclear localization. These data show that the dose of 
ZFs fused to the c-terminal partner does not seem to affect the overall amount of protein 
accumulating in the nucleus. We do note that there are significant differences in the steady-
state protein stability of the smaller C11-RELAFUS1 protein (T1/2 >16 hrs) and the much larger 
C11-YAP1 protein (T1/2: 4-8 hrs). We would postulate that the bigger and bulkier the 
C11orf95 fusion is, the less stable it is, and this results in negative selection for these fusion 
proteins during the cellular transformation process (less frequently detected in patients). This 
intrinsic stability may also support why C11-RELAFUS1 is a stronger oncogene than C11-
RELAFUS2 or C11-YAP1 in our murine models (Pajtler et al., 2019; Parker et al., 2014).  
 Complete deletion of the ZF domain or removal of the C2-H2 amino acids 
comprising the core portion of the ZF in C11-RELAFUS1, re-localizes the fusion protein back 
into the cytoplasm where wild-type RELA is located. In contrast, disruption of the RELA 
encoded NLS or nuclear export signal (NES) have no effect on the nuclear localization of the 
C11-RELAFUS1 protein (Cervantes et al., 2011; Harhaj and Sun, 2015). Identical 
Chapter 5: Discussion 
(unpublished) data from various other labs (Pfister Lab  DKFZ; LoTurco Lab  Uconn) have 
confirmed these essential findings that the ZFs of C11orf95 function as NLS. Taken 
together, these experiments show the ZFs of C11orf95 are necessary and sufficient to 
promote nuclear translocation of the fused c-terminal protein. 
 Forebrain ependymomas also contain a smaller subgroup of tumours (<10%) that are 
defined by n-terminal YAP1 translocations fused to FAM118B or MAMLD1 (Kim et al., 2019; 
Pajtler et al., 2015; Parker et al., 2014). These n-terminal YAP1 translocations are molecularly 
distinct (by both transcriptomics and methylomics) from ST-RELA tumours and tumours 
generated by C11orf95-YAP1 (Pajtler et al., 2019) (Pfister Lab, DKFZ; unpublished). These 
YAP1-MAMLD1 and YAP1-FAM118B proteins also display sustained nuclear localization, 
resulting in hyper-activation of the Hippo pathway that is dependent on interactions with the 
TEAD transcription factors (Pajtler et al., 2019). These data highlight gene fusions as the 
driver mutations in supratentorial ependymomas (Liu et al., 2017; Pajtler et al., 2015) - which 
are distinct from posterior fossa ependymomas which have few recurrently mutated genes 
(Hbner et al., 2019; Michealraj et al., 2020). Oncogenic translocations in both forebrain 
ependymoma subgroups (ST-RELA or ST-YAP1) converge on aberrant nuclear saturation of 
transcriptional regulators which are normally sequestered in the cytoplasm (Liu et al., 2017). 
The function of C11orf95 translocations once these proteins have entered in the nucleus was 
then further explored in Chapter 3 and 4 of this PhD thesis.  
5.2 C11orf95 fusions have a shared transcriptional signature. 
Nuclear saturation of the C11-RELAFUS1 protein in mouse neural stem cells results in 
activation of a basal NF-B transcriptional program (Ozawa et al., 2018; Parker et al., 2014). 
This is more than likely due to C11-RELAFUS1 binding onto B DNA-sequences through the 
RHD region - the domain responsible for NF-B complex association and DNA-binding 
(Oeckinghaus and Ghosh, 2009). Surprisingly, in our stable mNSCs expressing the same 
transgenes (and now including C11-RELAFUS2), we observe in an unbiased manner by PCA 
that the transcriptomes generated from C11-RELAFUS1 and C11-RELAFUS2 are dramatically 
distinct from those over-expressing C11orf95, RELA, or empty vector control (with or 
without transient TNF exposure). Thus, the fusion of ZFs from C11orf95 onto the RELA 
transcription factor generate a novel and unique transcriptome compared to those generated 
from over-expression of wild-type RELA or C11orf95. It is important to note that we do 
Chapter 5: Discussion 
detect basal activation of NF-B genetic targets in these cells stably over-expressing either 
C11orf95-RELA fusions. The contribution of NF-B activity to C11orf95-RELA functions 
(i.e., RHD-mediated dimerization and DNA-binding) were explored in Chapter 4 and will be 
discussed in Section 5.4.  
 Due to the significant similarities in transcriptomes from both the C11-RELAFUS1 
and C11-RELAFUS2 over-expressing cells, we were initially curious if C11-YAP1 fusion 
would also generate a common transcriptome to the C11-RELA fusions. We generated 
transient bulk transcriptomes from cells over-expressing these 3 C11orf95 fusions to identify 
the immediately changed genes, as long-term exposure of these cDNAs, irrespective of the 
cell-type, may prevent a faithful understanding of their functions. Both RELA and YAP1, in 
our transient experiment, induce their respective pathway target genes (e.g., NFKBIA, SELE, 
CTGF, ANKRD65); curiously, over-expression of C11orf95 has next to no impact on the 
transcriptome despite its presence in the nucleus, suggesting it may not be a direct 
transcriptional regulator. In stark contrast, all three C11orf95 translocations are potent 
activators of gene expression, suggesting conservation of their endogenous function as a 
transcriptional activator (Liu et al., 2017).  
 Surprisingly, genes up-regulated by C11-RELAFUS1 in our transient HEK293 model 
have a significant overlap with the genes specifically enriched in the ST-RELA subgroup 
(Pajtler et al., 2015); we dubbed this overlap cassette the CRgsig (i.e., C11-RELA fusion 
genomic signature). Both C11-RELAFUS2 and C11-YAP1 induce portions of the CRgsig, 
albeit not to a similar degree as C11-RELAFUS1, which appears to be the strongest activator of 
gene expression in this model system. This would suggest that all C11orf95 fusions are 
capable of inducing (all, if not some portion of) the CRgsig cassette, even in the inappropriate 
cellular context (i.e., HEK293); this led us to formally hypothesize that the ZFs of C11orf95 
may serve as a novel DNA-binding domain, resulting in novel chromatin contacts of the 
fused c-terminal partner. Gene translocations that produce chimeric transcription factors have 
been observed in several paediatric malignancies (e.g., SSX-SS18 in synovial sarcomas, 
EWS-FLI1 in Ewing sarcomas, etc) which contain novel DNA-binding domains that mediate 
their oncogenic functions (Boulay et al., 2017; Brien et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2018; Kadoch 
and Crabtree, 2013; Mertens et al., 2015, 2016).  
 One of these CRgsig genes is L1CAM, which is highly expressed in our human in 
vitro systems and in patient disease (Gessi et al., 2019; Mack et al., 2018; Malgulwar et al., 
2018; Pajtler et al., 2015; Parker et al., 2014). All three C11orf95 translocations studied 
Chapter 5: Discussion 
(C11-RELAFUS1, C11-RELAFUS2, C11-YAP1) up-regulate L1CAM transcript and protein, but 
not any of their wild-type counterparts in our model system. We do note that there are a few 
publications which show NF-B and Hippo pathway indirectly regulating L1CAM (Er et al., 
2018; Kiefel et al., 2011); however, this is more than likely context and cell-type dependent 
as we do not observe this in our HEK293 or mouse neural stem cell model.  
 We engineered proteins that express increasing doses of C11orf95s ZFs (e.g., ZF1, 
ZF1-2, ZF1-3, ZF1-4) directly to the TAD region of RELA and observe L1CAM transcript 
and protein induction. These direct ZF-TAD fusions have lost all NF-B mediated DNA-
binding through the removal of the RHD region (Module et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2017). In 
a similar manner, fusions of YAP1 to either ZF1, ZF1-2, or ZF1-4 also up-regulate L1CAM 
transcript and protein. Thus, induction of L1CAM appears to be dose-dependent by these 
fusion proteins; direct fusions of ZF1 appear to be the strongest (i.e., C11-RELAFUS1, C11-
YAP1 ZF2-4), followed by fusions containing ZF1-2 (e.g., C11-RELAFUS2, C11-YAP1 
ZF3-4), and then ZF1-3 or ZF1-4 (e.g., C11-YAP1).  
 We extended this finding genome-wide using RNA-seq for these different C11-
YAP1 fusions: showing that all three fusions (ZF1, ZF1-2, ZF1-4 fused to YAP1) are capable 
of inducing the CRgsig in a dose-dependent manner. The high primary sequence homology 
between each of the 4 ZFs in C11orf95 suggests that there is probably some redundancy 
between them and if they were to act as a DNA-binding domain, they are most likely not all 
required for initiating DNA contact. Nevertheless, to directly address this, we performed 
whole genome ChIP-seq and this will be discussed in the next section (Section 5.3). 
 Finally, we generated several loss-of-function mutations for ZF1 in C11-RELAFUS1 
to test their ability to up-regulate L1CAM: complete deletion of ZF1, the C2H2 amino acids 
comprising the core structure of ZF1, or a point mutant of the second histidine residue in the 
C2H2 residues (His149Ala149). All three ZF mutants pheno-copy one another and show 
no induction of L1CAM transcript or protein. Transcriptome profiling of the ZF mutant for 
C11-RELAFUS1 show a similar failure to up-regulate the CRgsig (Chapter 4). Thus, we have 
described a second phenotype for C11orf95-RELA and C11orf95-YAP1 fusions to induce a 
common genomic signature following their translocation into the nucleus. These data 
strongly suggested to us that these fusion proteins are being brought onto chromatin directly 
by C11orf95 ZFs and potentially functioning as aberrant transcription factors. 
Chapter 5: Discussion 
5.3 C11orf95 fusions are ZF-containing chimeric transcription 
factors. 
The up-regulation of the CRgsig by all three C11orf95 fusions (C11-RELAFUS1, C11-
RELAFUS2, and C11-YAP1) and our engineered fusions led us to postulate that the ZFs of 
C11orf95 were functioning as a novel DNA-binding domain. We generated whole-genome 
ChIP-seq profiles for the most frequent C11orf95 fusion, C11-RELAFUS1, which is the 
strongest transcriptional activator in our model systems, and its wild-type counterparts 
(C11orf95, RELA). We observe a substantial overlap for wild-type C11orf95 and C11-
RELAFUS1 binding sites genome-wide (>75% sites directly co-bound together) in our 
transient over-expression system. Unsurprisingly, nearly all of the genes that are up-regulated 
by the C11-RELAFUS1 are also bound by the protein in the ChIP-seq analysis. Many of the 
genes in the CRgsig also have binding sites at their respective loci by both C11orf95 and 
C11-RELAFUS1 proteins, which also display ST-RELA subgroup specific H3K27ac 
enhancers (Mack et al., 2018).  
 This strongly supports a mechanism by which C11orf95 translocations with different 
c-terminal partners (i.e., C11-RELA, C11-YAP1) bind and activate the same genes (e.g., 
CRgsig, L1CAM, etc) through this ZF-dependent genomic targeting. We note that this critical 
finding that C11orf95 is indeed the main driver of genomic occupancy have also been 
reproduced by several other labs, most of which are unpublished or in the publication process 
(Pfister lab, DKFZ; Mack lab, Baylor; LoTurco lab, UConn; Lau lab, Jackson Labs; etc) (Zhu 
et al., 2020).  
 In contrast, RELA and C11-RELAFUS1 co-bound ChIP sites represent less than <2% 
of the total C11-RELAFUS1 binding sites under these conditions. It is important to note that 
we cannot exclude the possibility that we have missed RELA DNA-binding sites, due to the 
significantly lower amounts of RELA protein in the nucleus (and thus on chromatin). One 
potential way around this is to stimulate the NF-B pathway (e.g., TNF exposure) or push 
the protein into the nucleus artificially with an additional NLS fused onto the protein. 
However, whether this is an accurate representation of the natural state of RELA is 
debatable.  
 Collaborative work that is published (Ozawa et al., 2018) attempted to address the 
contribution of NF-B activity to C11-RELAFUS1 functions using point mutations that are 
associated with canonical NF-B pathway activation (Chen et al., 2005; Hochrainer et al., 
Chapter 5: Discussion 
2013; Mukherjee et al., 2013; Napetschnig and Wu, 2013; Zhang et al., 2017). However, the 
data generated from these point mutations on Serine (Ser276, Ser536) and Lysine residues 
(Lys428/431/310) painted a convoluted picture with no conclusive evidence that the C11-
RELAFUS1 protein requires traditional NF-B post-translational modifications 
(phosphorylation or acetylation) to function as a brain tumour oncogene. To clarify this story, 
we have addressed this directly by generating and characterizing a RHD mutant where we 
have completely removed all NF-B DNA-binding and complex dimerization by C11-
RELAFUS1 (discussed in Section 5.4). This RHD mutant allowed us to completely 
disentangle the requirement of NF-B genetic targets and activity to C11-RELAFUS1 functions 
as an ependymoma oncogene. 
 We indirectly generated data to support this ZF DNA-binding domain hypothesis 
with our C11-YAP1 mutants. YAP1 is not a transcription factor and has no intrinsic DNA-
binding domain. YAP1 and its sister protein TAZ, are both co-activators which are brought 
onto sequence-specific DNA by the TEAD transcription factors (Meng et al., 2016; Yu and 
Guan, 2013). Thus, activation of the full CRgsig by the C11-YAP1 fusions supports this 
mechanism by which the ZFs of C11orf95 act as a novel DNA-binding for YAP1 as well as 
RELA. It is important to note that a smaller subgroup of forebrain ependymomas are defined 
by n-terminal YAP1 fusions (referred to as ST-YAP1) to FAM118B and MAMLD1 (Pajtler 
et al., 2015). Over-expression of YAP1-MAMLD1 and YAP1-FAM118B in mNSCs also 
generate ependymomas in mice (Kim et al., 2019; Pajtler et al., 2019), however, they are 
molecularly distinct from C11-YAP1 driven tumours (Pfister Lab data, unpublished). 
Mutation of the Serine94 residue to Alanine (S94A) in YAP1 abolishes association with 
TEAD proteins and results in no tumours generated by YAP1-MAMLD1 or YAP1-
FAM118B (Pajtler et al., 2019), suggesting a requirement for active Hippo pathway 
signalling by these n-terminal YAP1 fusions. Whether or not the C11-YAP1 fusions require 
TEAD proteins or other Hippo pathway factors to function as an oncogene remain to be 
determined. Preliminary data where we have mutated the S94A mutant in our C11-YAP1 
fusions show they are able to still up-regulate L1CAM, suggesting TEAD factors are 
dispensable for C11-YAP1 oncogenic functions. However, further examination is ongoing 
and will require additional experimentation to fully ascertain if Hippo pathway activation is 
necessary for C11-YAP1 oncogenesis.   
 Transcriptional regulation is often coupled to the post-translational modifications of 
histones which package DNA into chromatin (Bracken et al., 2019; Helin and Dhanak, 2013; 
Chapter 5: Discussion 
Kadoch et al., 2016). We observe binding overlap between C11orf95/C11-RELAFUS1 in our 
in vitro model system and H3K27ac marked enhancers from patient tumours (Mack et al., 
2018) for many of the CRgsig genes (e.g., L1CAM). We show using ChIP-seq for histone 
marks of active and repressed gene transcription that sustained expression of C11-RELAFUS1 
results in widespread remodelling of the histone landscape: this directly coincides with both 
gain of active marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K36me3) and loss of a repressor mark 
(H3K27me3) in mNSCs expressing C11-RELAFUS1 (compared to the isogenic empty vector 
control). These observations are consistent with widespread alterations in the transcriptional 
programs following exogenous C11-RELAFUS1 protein expression, and concomitant gain or 
loss of these histone marks which are directly linked to actively transcribed or repressed 
genes (Karch et al., 2013; Lelli et al., 2012). 
 We pooled all of our RNA-seq and protein/histone ChIP-seq data sets together to 
identify actionable genetic targets that are regulated by C11-RELAFUS1 in our genetically-
defined murine model. This analysis identified the Nerve growth factor receptor (Ngfr) also 
known as the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NTR) as being highly expressed in vitro and in 
vivo by C11-RELAFUS1. Published work had shown in an unbiased manner and before the 
C11orf95-RELA translocations had been identified, that the NGFR protein was over-
expressed in forebrain ependymomas (Hagel et al., 2013). The NGFR is a member of the 
neurotrophin-binding family of receptors, that include the NTRK proteins (TrkA, TrkB, 
TrkC) which are mutated in a variety of human malignancies and susceptible to small 
molecular inhibitors (e.g., Entrectinib) (Chao et al., 2006; Dechant and Barde, 2002; Meakin 
and Shooter, 1992; Zampieri and Chao, 2006). Thus, the NGFR, whose expression we have 
shown exquisitely marks C11-RELAFUS1 transformed cells in our murine models, seemed like 
an attractive therapeutic target. Curiously, deletion of Ngfr using CRISPR-Cas9 mildly 
accelerates tumour initiation in our implant model, suggesting it may not function as an 
oncogene like the other NTRK proteins (Chao et al., 2006). Nevertheless, the NGFR serves 
as an invaluable tool to mark fusion expressing cells for lineage tracing and may be amenable 
for tumour cell isolation for downstream experimentation using single-cell analyses. 
 Validating genetic targets one-by-one are a laborious and time-consuming process; a 
dropout screen using RNAi or CRISPR would have proven more fruitful for identifying 
genetic dependencies in our murine model of C11-RELAFUS1 disease. Unsurprisingly, 
CRISPR dropout screens using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines have been performed 
by collaborators and many of their hits are found in our CRgsig (e.g., CHD5, GPSM1, TP73, 
Chapter 5: Discussion 
etc) (Taylor laboratory, SickKids; unpublished). Nevertheless, our ChIP-seq and RNA-seq 
analyses have identified numerous druggable targets that should be followed up for efficacy 
in extending survival in our murine models.  
5.4 C11orf95 fusions co-opt transcriptional co-activators. 
We generated maps of the protein interactomes of multiple C11orf95 fusions - notably C11-
RELAFUS1 and various mutants of C11-YAP1 using both qPLEX-RIME (Papachristou et al., 
2018) and traditional IP-MS. Both methods largely reproduce one anothers findings: 
showing that the protein interactome of C11-RELAFUS1 and C11-YAP1 fusions are primarily 
identical to the nuclear RELA or YAP1 interactome (Napetschnig and Wu, 2013), suggesting 
a conservation of its functions as a transcriptional activator (Brown et al., 2014; Huang et al., 
2009; Oeckinghaus and Ghosh, 2009). Thus, integration of our OMICS analyses 
(CHIP/RNA/IP-MS) of these C11orf95 fusions have converged on this common mechanism 
for these proteins to function as as ZF-dependent, DNA-binding transcriptional activators. 
 Using both qPLEX-RIME, IP-MS, and Co-IP we show that RELA and C11-
RELAFUS1 directly interact with the entire NF-B TF complex and the associated IB 
inhibitors through its intact RHD region, but C11orf95 does not. This suggests that the 
mechanism by which C11orf95 ZFs promote nuclear localization is not due to a 
displacement of the IB proteins from the RHD region, which they normally bind to and 
mask an NLS located inside the RHD (Module et al., 2009; Ruland, 2011; Scheidereit, 
2006). The observation that C11-RELAFUS1 retains its association with the NF-B complex 
was quite surprising. We had initially hypothesized that the proteomics analyses would 
identify novel protein partners mediated by C11orf95 ZFs. However, our studies suggest that 
this does not appear to be the case for C11orf95-RELA or C11orf95-YAP1 translocations as 
they appear to largely diverge from the wild-type C11orf95 protein interactome. Whereas the 
genomic occupancy of C11-RELAFUS1 overlaps with C11orf95 exquisitely, the protein 
interactomes are quite distinct. This coincides with C11orf95 appearing to have no direct 
effect on transcription when over-expressed or deleted (data not shown) as shown in our 
RNA-seq studies. 
 We generated and characterized the protein interactomes and transcriptomes of the 
deletion () mutants of C11-RELAFUS1 protein where we have removed the ZF domain, or 
the RHD and TAD regions. The loss of the ZF returns the C11-RELAFUS1 protein back to 
Chapter 5: Discussion 
behaving like wild-type RELA: where it is primarily anchored in the cytoplasm and the small 
amount of protein that localizes into the nucleus exclusively up-regulates NF-B genetic 
targets. Similar to over-expression of wild-type RELA (Ozawa et al., 2018; Parker et al., 
2014), the ZF mutant of C11-RELAFUS1 is also incapable of generating tumours in our 
murine implant model. We further show with our RHD mutant, which is deficient in all NF-
B activity (i.e., binding to the complex and activating B genetic targets), is fully capable of 
inducing the CRgsig and generating tumours in our mouse model (albeit with a delay). We 
hypothesize this delay is due to several factors: the decreased presence in the nucleus of this 
mutant (compared to the full-length fusion) and the inability to generate a dimer (via the 
RHD) at the DNA interface which is necessary for transcription factors to bind to the anti-
parallel DNA molecule (Wan and Lenardo, 2009). However, we cannot exclude the 
possibility that the RHD-mediated B genetic targets may also play a role in promoting 
transformation in vivo by C11-RELAFUS1 (Karin, 2009; Oeckinghaus et al., 2011; Smale, 
2011). Nevertheless, these data suggested to us that the ZF is the primary DNA-binding 
module for C11-RELAFUS1 protein and that the trans-activation domain (TAD) is more than 
likely the business end of the fusion for activation of transcription.  
 Using Co-IP, we show that C11-RELAFUS1 also retains interactions with many 
previously defined co-activator proteins that have been shown to mediate RELA/NF-B 
transcriptional activator functions (e.g., EP300, BRD4, BRG1, etc.) (Brown et al., 2014; 
Dong et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2009; Karin, 2006; Zhang et al., 2017). Replacing RELA 
from the C11-RELAFUS1 protein with the core histone acetyltransferase (HAT) region of 
EP300, results in a transcriptome phenocopy and activation of the CRgsig. We note that the 
C11-EP300 fusion does not transform neural stem cells in vivo in an in-utero electroporation 
model (Pfister Lab; DKFZ) and it is notably weaker than the other ZF1 fusions we have 
tested (i.e., C11-RELAFUS1 and the ZF2-3 C11-YAP1 fusion) at activating the CRgsig. This 
suggests that the full consortia of TAD protein interactors are probably needed to drive 
transformation in vivo, and EP300 alone is not sufficient. This is consistent with patient data 
in which we observe translocations of C11orf95 with TAD-containing transcriptional 
regulators (e.g., RELA, YAP1, MAML2) but not the partner partners themselves (e.g., EP300, 
BRD4, etc). We are performing additional experiments to further characterize this EP300 
dependency and its requirements for cell proliferation and survival using pharmacological 
inhibitors (e.g., A-485 HAT inhibitor) and genetic ablation in our murine models.  
Chapter 5: Discussion 
 Complete ablation of the entire TAD region from C11-RELAFUS1 or C11-YAP1 
results in failure to up-regulate L1CAM and the CRgsig, showing it is required for activation 
of either ZF and RHD-directed genetic targets. We show in our allograft implant model that 
the TAD mutant, like the ZF mutant, fail to initiate tumours even after a long surveillance 
period (7 months post-implant). In summation, both the ZF and TAD regions are required for 
in vitro functions and in vivo transformation by C11-RELAFUS1. Future studies should 
elucidate which of these TAD region protein interactors are critical for the oncogenic 
functions of C11orf95 fusions using both pharmacological inhibitors and genetic deletions.  
 To our surprise an avalanche of unpublished work from numerous labs have 
converged on the critical nature of C11orf95 as the driver of ST-RELA disease with 
alternate c-terminal partners capable of pheno-copying RELA (Pfister Lab, DKFZ; Taylor 
Lab, SickKids; Mack Lab, Baylor; LoTurco Lab, UConn). In conclusion, the data we and 
others have generated suggest the nomenclature of ST-RELA for this molecular subgroup 
of tumours is probably misleading and a more accurate terminology would probably be ST-
C11orf95.  The functions and biology of C11orf95 have thus remained more elusive. Data 
generated in our lab show that germline loss of the murine homologue of C11orf95 is 
embryonic lethal, suggesting it is critical for development (Gilbertson Lab: Claire King). As 
we have shown throughout this thesis, C11orf95 and C11-RELAFUS1 are present in the 
nucleus and co-occupy the genome together; however, over-expression or genetic ablation 
(data not shown) of C11orf95 appears to have little to no impact on transcription. 
Furthermore, our protein interactome analyses of C11orf95 suggest it may be involved in 
nucleolar biology, however, further experimentation should be performed to confirm this. 
Super-resolution microscopy to examine the proteins subnuclear localization is of particular 
interest as the C11orf95 protein is predicted to be highly disordered, containing long stretches 
of acidic amino acids dividing up each of the four ZFs. This may promote protein instability 
and sequestration into the nucleolus  which is a phase separated compartment for disordered 
proteins (Rekulapally and Suresh, 2019).  
 Curiously, there is an over-representation of imprinted and X chromosome genes in 
our CRgsig (e.g., IGF2, H19, CDKN1C, TP73, L1CAM, SRPK3, etc); numerous studies have 
shown that heterochromatin, and more specifically imprinted genes and the inactive X 
chromosome, are localized on the periphery of the nucleolus (Grummt, 2013; Padeken and 
Heun, 2014; Zhang et al., 2007). Could C11orf95 function as a protein scaffold for 
heterochromatin onto the nucleolus? And if this were the case, is this mechanism deregulated 
Chapter 5: Discussion 
by the strong transcriptional activation functions of C11orf95 translocations? Further 
experimentation would need to be performed to test these hypotheses. We have observed that 
the ZFs of C11orf95 promote nuclear localization and DNA-binding, and are thus an 
essential requirement within the fusion protein. However, the normal function of C11orf95 
and its role during development are a topic of ongoing study in our research group.  
Chapter 5: Discussion 
5.5 Conclusions. 
In summary, the major and key findings of this PhD thesis include: 
 C11orf95 translocations produce ZF-containing chimeric transcription factors. 
 C11orf95 ZFs promote sustained nuclear localization by functioning as a putative 
nuclear localization signal (Chapter 3). 
 C11orf95 translocations up-regulate a common ZF-dependent genomic signature 
(CRgsig) that is observed in patient tumours (ST-RELA tumours) (Chapter 3).    
 C11orf95 and C11-RELAFUS1 co-localize together across the genome, suggesting that 
C11orf95 is a DNA-binding protein and the ZFs are required to mediate this 
(Chapter 3).  
 C11orf95-RELA and C11orf95-YAP1 protein interactomes are largely overlapping 
with the nuclear interactome of the c-terminal partner (RELA, YAP1) (Chapter 4). 
 C11orf95 translocations co-opt transcriptional co-activators through the TAD regions 
of their c-terminal partners resulting in aberrant activation of ZF-mediated genetic 
targets (Chapter 4). 
 NF-B activity mediated by the RHD is not essential for C11-RELAFUS1 activation of 
ZF-directed genetic targets (i.e., CRgsig) or tumour initiation in vivo (Chapter 4).
