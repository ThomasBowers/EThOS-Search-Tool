Abstract: Fleets and Prouinciae in the Roman Republic: 
institutions, administration and the conceptualisation of empire 
between 260 and 49 B.C. 
This research examines how, when and why the Romans assigned and defined the tasks of 
preparing and commanding fleets during the Republic. In doing so, it brings new evidence 
to bear on the wider debates about the nature of the prouincia.  
The communis opinio is that a prouincia originally represented a functional sphere 
of operation that was allotted or assigned to a magistrate and that it only later developed a 
geographical meaning with territorial connotations through the process of 
provincialisation. This research challenges that view through an analysis of the evidence 
for the definition, assignment and practical use of the prouincia classis and other 
prouinciae connected with the command of fleets. Drawing upon and analysing the lists of 
administrative arrangements to be found in the annalistic sections of the surviving books 
of Livys History, it argues that prouinciae were defined in specific geographical and 
functional terms long before the development of permanent territorial empire. This offers a 
new perspective which points to and elucidates the flexible use of the prouincia as a means 
of separating magistrates and promagistrates in space or by function in space. It argues that 
the rationale for this was to limit conflicts between commanders over command and 
triumphal rights. 
By combining evidence from a wide range of sources after the loss of Livys 
History from 167, the research shows that the above rationale for demarcating prouinciae 
still applied in the first century B.C. However, it also demonstrates that there were 
significant changes with the assignment of vast Mediterranean-wide naval prouinciae in 
the first half of the first century B.C. It argues that the definition of these prouinciae was 
made possible by the development of a singular collective Mediterranean-wide ora 
maritima, which was brought about by the Romans increasing acknowledgement of 
empire. The negative political and institutional implications of these developments are 
also assessed.  
Finally, in discussing the above, this research also provides new insights into the 
role and auctoritas of the Senate, the function and freedom of magistrates, and the 
Romans conceptualisation of their empire.

I.i. Introduction  
Chapter I: Introduction 
I.i. Introduction 
This research explores the institutional and political mechanisms used by the Romans for 
defining, assigning and undertaking naval tasks during the Republic. It is primarily 
concerned with how these mechanisms developed and functioned as the Roman Empire 
expanded between the third and first centuries. Whilst the significance of the contribution 
made by Romes naval forces to her overseas military success has been widely recognised 
by both ancient and modern historians, little attention has been paid to the important 
questions of how, when and why the tasks of preparing and commanding the fleets were 
actually assigned. It follows that the contributions that answers to these questions can 
make to the wider debates concerning the functions of the Senate, the role and autonomy 
of magistrates, the nature of the prouincia and even the conceptualisation of empire have 
been largely overlooked. The underlying purpose of this study is to redress these omissions 
by focussing on the prouincia as a means of defining naval commands and what these 
commands reveal about the concept of the prouincia more generally. As we shall see, 
prouinciae were fundamental for the working, development and conceptualisation of the 
Roman Empire. 
The wider debates noted in the previous paragraph will be introduced at the 
appropriate points in the course of this study. This preliminary chapter will be used to 
contextualise my approach to the above questions through an examination of the 
historiography of Roman fleets and the early historical development of the naval tasks 
under investigation. It is divided into three parts. The first part will consider how Roman 
fleets were viewed by Polybius in his Histories. This is the earliest surviving work to 
mention Roman fleets at any length and has had a profound influence on modern 
scholarship. Polybius also outlines a chronology for the creation of the Roman fleet. This 
will be assessed in order to determine an appropriate starting point for this research. The 
second and third parts will then discuss the evidence for the role played by senior 
magistrates in the construction and command of the first large Roman fleet. These two 
discussions will each be used to frame the questions and themes to be discussed in 
Chapters II-IV.

I.ii. The invention of the Roman fleet: Polybius and historiography 
For who is so worthless or indolent as not to wish to know by what means and 
under what system of polity the Romans in less than fifty-three years have 
succeeded in subjecting nearly the whole inhabited world to their sole government 
 a thing unique in history? Or who again is there so passionately devoted to other 
spectacles or studies as to regard anything as of greater moment than the 
acquisition of this knowledge?
These are the famous words with which Polybius outlined the underlying theme of his 
Histories: how and why the Romans acquired a dominant position () between 220 
and 167 that enabled them to give orders and ensure that they were obeyed.
 He traces the 
origin of this development back to the first time that the Romans crossed the sea from Italy 
with an army in 264  an event he describes as being the most suitable starting point for 
his whole theme.
 This, he claims, set off a chain of events, starting with war with 
Carthage, which led to the construction of a Roman fleet of 100 quinqueremes and 20 
triremes in 260 (for the purpose of challenging the Carthaginians for the  of the whole 
of Sicily).
 According to Polybius, this marked the foundation of the Roman fleet and 
Roman power at sea:  
And one of the reasons which induced me to narrate the history of the war named 
above at some length is just this, that my readers should, in this case too, not be

I.ii. The invention of the Roman fleet: Polybius and historiography  
kept in ignorance of the beginning  how, when, and for what reasons the Romans 
first took to the sea.
These claims about the origin of the first Roman fleet and its contribution to the 
development of the Roman  between 260 and 167 have dominated the existing 
scholarship on the naval history of the Roman Republic. Recently, Steinby, for instance, 
has sought to answer the following two closely related questions: But when does the 
history of the Roman navy begin and what kind of role did the navy play in Roman 
expansion?
 The books main objectives are to demonstrate that the Romans had an 
efficient and powerful navy long before the First Punic War and to highlight the 
importance of Romes fleets for the extension of her power throughout the Mediterranean.
In doing so, it offers a re-assessment of the claims made by Thiel, in his two fundamental 
studies on Roman sea-power, that Roman fleets were unimportant prior to the First 
Punic War and that the Romans were generally averse to naval warfare (as so-called 
landlubbers).
 Other modern discussions of Roman fleets roughly fall into three, 
partially overlapping, categories: i) those concerned with the evidence for the existence 
and strength of Roman fleets before 260;
 ii) those which concentrate on ship numbers,

     . 
 Steinby (2007), p.13.  
 Ibid., p.13-17 (with the quotation from p.29) and note especially p.16f: The main theme is the 
development of the Roman navy, how it functioned strategically and tactically, and the role it played in the 
expansion of Romes Mediterranean dominion and how it defeated the navies of Carthage, Macedon and 
Syria. Cf. p.105, p.143, p.171 and p.198 for the rationale given at the start of each chapter. 
 Thiel (1946) and (1954). Steinby is right to question Thiels consistent portrayal of the Romans as 
landlubbers, yet her controversial arguments (p.29-86) for a powerful navy prior to the First Punic War are 
not supported by the evidence and Thiels interpretation is still to be preferred. Cf. the reviews by Dart 
(2009) and Hoyos (2010), p.514f, and note also Dart and Vervaet (2011), p.267-269. It should also be noted 
that Le Bohec (2003), offering support for a thesis originally proposed by Charles-Picard (1967), p.124-126, 
already suggested that the construction of the fleet in 260 merely brought about a change in the size of the 
fleet and the diversity of the missions: he proposed that the Roman navy was excellente before the First 
Punic War and so characterises the development in 260 as being quantitative rather than qualitative. 
 E.g. Milan (1973), p.196, n.1 and p.211-214; Ferone (2001); Ferone (2003), esp. p.79f with n.60; Le Bohec 
(2003); Lafon (2006); Loreto (2007), p.45-50; and Dart and Vervaet (2011), p.267-269.  
I.ii. The invention of the Roman fleet: Polybius and historiography  
ship types and naval strategy and how these relate to the notion of sea-power;
 and iii) 
those which deal with the manpower on board the ships.
The predominant focus of scholars on these topics  though important  has meant 
that much less attention has been given to the related institutional and political contexts 
associated with Roman fleets. Steinby, for example, did not examine the administrative 
procedures that underpinned the functioning of fleets and their overseas military successes; 
and Thiel only dedicated a relatively small number of pages to these issues, mostly in his 
various appraisals of the naval command structure between 264 and 167.
 A few other 
important studies have approached these subjects from different perspectives, but, 
consequently, do not give us the whole picture.
 Most notably, Brennan, in his magnum 
opus on the praetorship in the Roman Republic, examined the praetors role in naval 
preparations and the assignment of the fleet as a praetorian prouincia.
My own research seeks to expand on, and develop, these themes by considering all 
of the available evidence for the Roman naval preparations and command of fleets in the 
Republic. In doing so, I shall seek to elucidate the mechanisms for assigning, defining and 
undertaking naval tasks and thereby fill an important gap left by the previous studies of 
Roman fleets. As stated in the previous section, one of my main objectives will be to make

I.ii. The invention of the Roman fleet: Polybius and historiography  
a contribution to our understanding of some of the functions of the Senate and magistrates 
and, in particular, the concept of the prouincia.  
I shall base my analysis primarily on the surviving ancient source material and 
what this can tell us about how, when and why tasks were conceived and developed.
approach is to be differentiated from that of Mommsen, who, in his monumental 
Rmisches Staatsrecht, viewed the naval command as an inherent part of the supreme 
consular land command in Italy.
 Mommsen did not base his view on explicit attestations 
of an early consular naval responsibility in the ancient sources, but rather on his theory of 
an unlimited consulare imperium that applied to all the seas around Italy and beyond.
outlined his argument in his discussion of the duumuiri nauales, whom he claimed were 
elected in order each to take charge of one of the two (existing) consular fleets in 311.
is worth citing the evidence for this from Livys History: 
et duo imperia eo anno dari coepta per populum, utraque pertinentia ad rem 
militarem: unum, ut tribuni militum seni deni in quattuor legiones a populo 
crearentur, quae antea perquam paucis suffragio populi relictis locis dictatorum et 
consulum ferme fuerant beneficia  tulere eam rogationem tribuni plebei L. Atilius 
C. Marcius  : alterum, ut duumuiros nauales classis ornandae reficiendaeque causa 
idem populus iuberet; lator huius plebi sciti fuit M. Decius tribunus plebis.
The duumuiri nauales were originally elected by the people to equip (ornare) and 
refit (reficere) a fleet of 20 ships in 311.
 Yet, on other occasions, they must have also 
 Cf. Brennan (2000), p.3-6, esp. p.6 and, more recently, Pina Polo (2011), p.3-6. See also the approach 
taken by Lintott (1999), p.7f to the constitution of the Roman Republic and cf. Lintott (2012), p.309.  
 Mommsen (1887), II, p.579: Ein selbstndiges Commando zur See ist der rmischen Staatsordnung bis 
auf die zweite Hlfte des 7. Jahrhunderts unbekannt; vielmehr ist das Seecommando ein nothwendiger 
Bestandtheil des Landoberbefehls, so dass es in lterer Zeit ausschliesslich den Consuln, spterhin, seit es 
berseeische Provinzen giebt, daneben den Statthaltern derselben einem jeden in seinem Bereich zukommt. 
Cf. p.654: Das Commando zur See haftete nach der republikanischen Ordnung zunchst an dem 
consularischen Oberbefehl ber Italien.  
 See Mommsen (1887), I, p.22-24 for his view that consular imperium derived from the absolute power of 
the kings (Jenes unbedingte Befehlsrecht) and was all-encompassing (and, therefore, implicitly inclusive of 
the fleet). Cf. especially Pina Polo (2011), p.2-6. For useful summaries of Mommsens theory see also 
Brennan (2000), p.12-15 and Beck (2011), p.79-82.

 For the historical context see further Dart (2012), p.1001-1005.  
I.ii. The invention of the Roman fleet: Polybius and historiography  
been elected to take command of the ships, since there is evidence that a duumuir was in 
charge of 10 ships off Tarentum in 282.
 According to Mommsen, then, the consuls 
already had an overall responsibility for the fleet in the fourth century, given that the 
duumuiri nauales took charge of preparing and commanding the two consular fleets 
(consularische Flotten) in 311 and 282.
 In addition, he wrote that the supreme 
commander  e.g. a consul or a proconsul  would appoint a deputy naval commander (a 
so-called praefectus classis) and this even led some scholars, bizarrely, to claim that 
these deputies ordinarily commanded the fleet before the election of the duumuiri nauales 
in 311.
As noted above, Mommsens interpretation of an original consular responsibility 
for the naval preparations and the command of the fleet, which is followed by some more 
recent scholarship, is entirely theoretical and it should not, therefore, be taken as a 
historical fact. A sea-command (Seecommando)  or any other special naval competence 
 is never explicitly mentioned in the surviving evidence as being a part of the consulare 
imperium. Furthermore, there is no evidence that consuls were in any way connected with 
the preparation or the command of fleets prior to the First Punic War (264-241). Indeed, 
 Livy, Per, 12; Dio Cass. fr. 39.4; and App. Samn. 7.1. Cf. Mommsen (1887), II, p.580, n.1, who also cites 
the reference to a P. Cornelius in command of a Roman fleet off Campania in 310 (Livy, 9.38.2-3). Dart 
(2012), p.1004f rightly recognises that there is no evidence that Cornelius was a duumuir, although I am not 
entirely convinced by his alternative suggestion that he was a praefectus. (We cannot rule out that he was 
holding a minor magistracy and it is safer to admit that we do not know his position.)  
 This is also closely followed by Thiel (1946), p.421: Hence the peculiar doubleness of the duumviral 
command: to either consul one duumvir was added with a squadron of 10 sail. The doubleness is most 
easily explained by the universal principle of collegiality in Roman magistracies. 
 Mommsen (1887), II, p.579: Der Oberfeldherr bt dasselbe, wenn es ihm zweckmssig erscheint, in der 
Weise aus, das er fr die Flotte einen besonderen Stellvertreter, den praefectus classis bestellt. The 
influence can be traced from Mommsen to Tarn (1925), p.490 s.v. 755 (though without explicit mention of 
Mommsen in the text), Tarn to Thiel (1954), p.48 and now Thiel to Dart (2012), p.1001f. There is also a 
direct link between Mommsen and Thiel (1946), p.421f. Cf. Ensslin (1954), RE, col. 1294, s.v. praefectus 
classis. It should be emphasised that Mommsen does not actually explicitly say that praefecti classis were 
appointed before 311, but this is the inference made by Tarn and Thiel. For the position of praefectus classis 
see further Ch.V.ii. 
I.ii. The invention of the Roman fleet: Polybius and historiography  
they are completely absent from Livys description of the decision to elect duumuiri 
nauales in 311.
Although the consuls, as the supreme magistrates, would always have had the 
potential to prepare and to command fleets in the fourth century, it does not necessarily 
follow that those tasks were always considered to be consular or part of the consulare 
imperium before they had explicitly been assigned to a consul.  As suggested earlier, my 
approach, in contrast to that of Mommsen, is to work from the evidence for the assignment 
of naval tasks to imperium-holders rather than from the premise that the responsibility for 
these tasks was always an inherent part of the imperium itself. This will enable a better, 
more evidence-based, understanding of how these assignments developed over time, as the 
institutional structures of the Roman Republic expanded.  
With this approach in mind, just how far back can we trace the origins of the 
institutions connected with the fleet and, in particular, a supreme consular responsibility 
for the preparation and command of fleets? As we have seen above, Polybius took the 
construction of 100 quinqueremes and 20 triremes in 260 as the beginning of the Roman 
fleet.
 Scholars have rightly demonstrated that he is guilty of exaggeration and that Rome 
already had a fleet well before this date (as the existence of duumuiri nauales in 311 
attests). However, it is also important to view Polybius statement within the context of his 
historical aims (a basic point, which has not always been given sufficient emphasis in the 
modern scholarship).
 Dart and Vervaet recently observed that Polybius claims that 
Romes shipbuilders were inexperienced in constructing quinqueremes in 260 and so does 
not explicitly exclude the possibility that they had previously built and used other ships, 
 It should also be observed that P. Cornelius, who, as noted earlier, was probably not a duumuir, was placed 
in charge of the coastal region around Latium and Campania by the Senate in 310 with no hint that the 
consuls were connected with the command (Livy, 9.38.2-3).

I.ii. The invention of the Roman fleet: Polybius and historiography  
such as triremes.
 We can add that he also focuses exclusively on the numbers of 
quinqueremes engaged in several important naval battles without mentioning other types 
of ship in his summary of the First Punic War.
 Indeed, he makes a direct comparison 
between the size of quinqueremes and triremes, which he relates to his overarching theme, 
as quoted at the start of this section: 
Again, if we take into consideration the difference between quinqueremes and the 
triremes in which the Persians fought against the Greeks and the Athenians and 
Lacedaemonians against each other, we shall find that no forces of such magnitude 
ever met at sea. This confirms the assertion I ventured to make at the outset...that 
by schooling themselves in such vast and perilous enterprises it was perfectly 
natural that they [the Romans] not only gained the courage to aim at universal 
dominion, but executed their purpose.
For Polybius the fleet was part of the means () by which Rome first conceived 
her universal ambition and subsequently managed to achieve it.
 The construction of the 
first large Roman fleet in 260 brought about a quantitative change and this was important 
 Dart and Vervaet (2011), p.268 with Polyb. 1.20.9-10. Cf. Thiel (1954), p.173f; Loreto (2007), p.49f; and 
Dart (2012), p.1007f. 
 Polyb. 1.63.4-8 with Walbank (1957), p.127f. For what it is worth, Polybius can now be compared with 
the recently discovered archaeological evidence of the rostra from the final naval battle between the Romans 
and Carthaginians in 242 (or 241 according to the solar calendar), which are discussed further in Ch.I.iii. 
Polybius only refers to the presence of quinqueremes at this battle (1.59.6-8; and 1.63.5), but the rostra are 
significantly smaller than one might expect for a quinquereme. Cf. Tusa and Royal (2012), p.39-42 with their 
hypothesis on p.42: It is possible that only the fives [i.e. quinqueremes] were mentioned [by Polybius] as 
he is stressing the special building project and larger, more prominent ships... It should be noted, however, 
that there remain uncertainties about the size of quinqueremes. One can still maintain that the rams were 
from small quinqueremes, as argued by B. Rankov in a recent paper (The Egadi Rams: Triremes, 
Quadriremes or Quinqueremes?), which was delivered at the colloquium, Naval Warfare in the Third 
Century BCE: Rams, Warships, and Officials (University of Oxford, 8 April 2013).

 Cf. Polyb. 1.3.8-10 with Walbank (1957), p.129: ...in 3.9-10 P. undertook to explain the grounds

acquire it. The First Punic War, and especially Roman naval policy, provide the answer. 
I.ii. The invention of the Roman fleet: Polybius and historiography  
for his overarching theme; whereas the earlier naval history was presumably deemed 
irrelevant for his purposes and so simply ignored.
The change in the size of the Roman fleet in 260 is important for another reason, 
though, since this led also to the first ever consular naval assignments.
 Some rich 
contemporary (or, at least, near contemporary) evidence for this important institutional 
development is to be found in the famous inscription set up in commemoration of the 
achievements of C. Duilius, one of the consuls of 260, following his defeat of a large 
Carthaginian fleet off Mylae (modern Milazzo).
 The inscription, which was originally 
inscribed on a columna rostrata, has been restored as follows:

 I do not believe that the reference to L. Calpurnius Piso (cos. 133), cited by Pliny the Elder (HN. 16.192 = 
Peter, HRRel. fr.29: ...contra uero Hieronem regem CCXX naues effectas diebus XLV tradit L. Piso) should 
be taken as credible evidence that the Romans had already constructed a fleet of 220 warships in 263 pace 
Forsythe (1994), p.358-361 (though arguing for a lesser number of ships than the transmitted CCXX) and 
Beck (2013), p.135. For more plausible explanations see e.g. De Sanctis (1916), III.i, p.116, n.37; Thiel 
(1954), p.70-73 and Hoyos (1998), p.56 and p.92.  
 Milan (1973), p. 208-217, esp. p.211-213 is one of the few scholars to have appreciated the importance of 
the year 260 in institutional terms by viewing the year 260 as representing una svolta fondamentale, not 
only in a quantitative sense, but also with regard to organisational structure of those who served on board the 
ships. Cf. Le Bohec (2003), esp. p.65 for the quantitative change, although he denies that a qualitative 
change took place.   
 Inscr. Ital. XIII, 3, 69. The question of whether this represents an authentic document from the third 
century has been the subject of much debate, as the inscription we have today was engraved sometime 
between the reign of Augustus and the dedication of Pliny the Elders Naturalis Historia in 77 A.D. (HN. 
34.11.20). Nonetheless, Bleckmann (2002), p.116-125 and Kondratieff (2004), p.10-14 have convincingly 
reasserted the argument that it preserves an original text (dating c.260-250 and no later than 211). Cf. the 
pertinent comments in Gordon (1983), p.124-127. For the Augustan context of the re-engraving of the 
inscription see, most recently, Roller (2013), p.120-126. 
I.ii. The invention of the Roman fleet: Polybius and historiography  
Triump]oque navaled praedad poplom [donavet 
multosque] Cartacinie[ns]is [ince]nuos d[uxit ante 
curum ---]eis [---] capt[---].
Significantly, the inscription claims that Duilius was the first consul to have 
successfully waged war in ships at sea (ll. 5-6) and to have equipped and prepared naval 
forces and a fleet (ll. 6-7).
 The former statement does not prove that consuls had never 
commanded ships before, yet the prominence of the new fleet  together with the fresh 
opportunities it provided to achieve glorious victories  did mean that it was, for the first 
time, named explicitly as a consular assignment.
 Likewise, it is reasonable to suggest that 
the prestige connected with the fleets preparation was another reason why the naval 
preparations were first made a consular task in 260.
 Indeed, the inscription boasts that 
Duilius was the first (primus) consul to have equipped (ornare) and prepared (parare) the 
fleet. In this case, the implication is that the consul had newly taken over responsibility for 
the fleet  despite Mommsens theory of an unlimited consulare imperium  which had 
earlier been assigned to minor officials  i.e. duumuiri nauales classis ornandae 
reficiendaeque causa. It is, of course, not surprising that a consul was first given 
responsibility for the preparation and command of the new fleet in 260, given its size, 
expense and the new importance attached to naval warfare.
 The consulship was, after all, 
the supreme annual magistracy in the res publica.  
 Inscr. Ital. XIII, 3, 69. 
 See the next section for the translation of these lines (I.iii). 
 See Polyb. 1.21.4 and Zonar. 8.10 with the discussion in Ch.I.iv. For the earlier use of ships by consuls in 
264 see e.g. Zonar. 8.8 and Diod. Sic. 23.2.1. 
 Note especially lines 8-10 of the columna rostrata inscription, as quoted above, recording Duilius victory 
at Mylae directly after he was attributed with first equipping and preparing the fleet (Inscr. Ital. XIII, 3, 69). 
Cf. Bleckmann (2002), p.138f. For the prestige connected with preparing fleets compare also Tusa and Royal 
(2012), p.44f for the prominence of the names of several quaestors cast (or in another case engraved) in 
relatively large letters on the cowl nosing of at least four of the rostra from the last naval battle of the First 
Punic War. 
 For the role of the consuls in important building projects in Rome see now Pina Polo (2011), p.135-168. It 
is also well known that consuls would ordinarily receive the most important military assignments and 
prouinciae: see e.g. Mommsen (1887), II, 234; Richardson (1986), p.128-137 and Rich (1993), p.52 (for 
Spain between 155 and 133); and Fronda (2011b), p.236, n.15 (for the consular presence in Liguria and 
This is, therefore, an appropriate starting point for this research, since it not only 
marked the beginning of Romes use of large fleets in overseas warfare, as Polybius 
emphasised, but it was almost certainly the first occasion that a senior magistrate was 
charged with preparing and commanding the fleet. In the following chapters, I shall 
explore how these tasks developed  alongside other institutional and political changes  
from 260 onwards.  
The next two sections of this chapter will examine in more detail the evidence for 
the new consular naval assignments brought about by the change in the size and 
importance of the Roman fleet in 260. The first section will examine the new consular 
responsibility for the naval preparations, which will essentially serve as an introduction to 
Chapter II. The second section will then focus on the first consular naval command and, by 
doing so, will establish the context for the discussions in Chapters III and IV, which are 
the major chapters of this research. Both sections will also provide an opportunity to 
discuss the type of evidence available in conducting this research. 
Cisalpina Gaul in the early second century). This is especially true for the First Punic War and earlier, since 
only one praetor was elected until the 240s, for which see Ch.II.ii. For the earlier development of the 
consular supremacy vis--vis the praetor see Ch.III.v. 
I.iii. The creation of a new consular fleet: the naval preparations  
I.iii. The creation of a new consular fleet: the naval preparations 
As we have seen, the columna rostrata inscription states that Duilius was the first consul 
to equip and prepare naval forces and a fleet ([copiasque c]lasesque nauales primos 
ornauet pa[rauetque]).
 The verb ornare most probably refers to the equipping of the 
copiae  providing the restoration is correct  and, perhaps, also the clases.
 Meanwhile, 
the crucial context necessary for determining whether parare refers to the construction of a 
new fleet or the preparation of an already built fleet is not present in the inscription.
However, the former interpretation is corroborated by Orosius, who, despite writing in the 
fifth century A.D., probably preserves the tradition from the now lost seventeenth book of 
Livys History:
Cn. Cornelio Asina C. Duilio consulibus cum Hannibal senior oram Italiae 
maritimam instructa septuaginta nauium classe uastaret, Romani et ipsi classem 
fabricari atque instrui praeceperunt. quod Duilius consul celeriter inpleuit; nam 
intra sexaginta dies quam arbores caesae erant centum triginta nauium classis 
deducta in anchoris stetit.
 Inscr. Ital. XIII, 3, 69, ll. 6-7. 
 See TLL, XI.2, Fasc. VII, col. 1026 s.v.  instruuntur pugnantes (copiae, exercitus); and col. 1029 s.v. 
e instruuntur variae res (naves), in which [c]lases...navales is taken with ornare as one example. The 
flexibility of the Latin means that ornauet (and parauet) can be taken with copias and/or clases. Likewise, 
nauales can be taken with copias and clases together or just clases. If que is viewed as linking two closely 
related ideas then it may be literally translated as naval forces and naval fleets, which would have been 
more accurate given that Duilius was not the first consul to equip copiae without the specification that they 
were copiae nauales. (Cf. Penney (2005), esp. p.41ff for the use of que as an all-purpose connective.) The 
combination of clases with the adjective nauales is puzzling, since when do fleets need to be described as 
naval? The best explanation I have seen comes from Wlfflin (1890), p.302, who realised that classis could 
have also referred to a military levy at this time (i.e. from the classes of Roman citizens in the comitia 
centuriata) and so clases nauales would have avoided confusion. Cf. Frank (1919), p.74 with references to 
Festus 56L; 225L; and 248L. The possibility of confusing classis with a military dilectus would also provide 
a good reason why the fleet is given in a plural form (clases for claseis or classes), since this could be taken 
with nauales at the same time as copiae.  
 Modern scholars have translated the phrase in various ways: e.g. Gordon (1983), p.126 (to equip and 
prepare naval forces and warships); Crawford (1992), p.23 ([he] prepared and equipped naval forces and a 
fleet); Bleckmann (2002), p.129f (eine Flotte ausgerstet (ornavet) und gebaut hat (paravet)); Kondratieff 
(2004), p.15 (crews and fleets of warships he was the first to equip and train); and Beck (2005a), p.225 
(implicitly as Schiffsbau or Flottenbau). 
 TLL, vol. X.I, Fasc. III, col. 413 also uses the inscription from Duilius columna rostrata as the first 
example of this type of meaning s.v. aedificia, navigiaque opera structa, fabricata. If ornare also refers to 
the fleet (above), this would have naturally followed the construction: e.g. Livy, 37.50.5 (189 B.C.): naues 
quoque idem consul, quae priore anno paratae erant, ornare iussus ac ducere secum... 
 Oros. 4.7.7-8. 
I.iii. The creation of a new consular fleet: the naval preparations  
Pliny the Elder and Florus make the same (Livian?) statement concerning the 
fleets launch within sixty days from the time the trees had been felled.
 Only Orosius, 
however, provides the extra detail that Duilius quickly completed the order to construct 
(fabricare) and equip (instruere) the fleet, which parallels the wording in the inscription 
(with ornare and parare).
 We should not, however, completely rule out the possibility 
that Scipio, Duilius colleague in the consulship, played some part in this and that Duilius 
was able to monopolise all of the credit after his famous naval victory at Mylae.
Despite the epigraphic record and Orosius report that the Romans and the consuls 
ordered the fleet to be constructed in the consulship of Scipio and Duilius, some modern 
scholars have made an assumption that the construction of the fleet must have commenced 
under the consuls of 261. Thiel, for example, suggested that the consuls of 260 could not 
have overseen the construction and equipping in time for the summer sailing season 
(assuming they took office on the Kalends of May).
 Yet, there are three reasons why the 
consuls of 260 would have, perhaps, had ample time to undertake the preparations 
themselves.  
 Plin. HN. 16.192: mirum apud antiquos primo Punico bello classem Duilli imperatoris ab arbore LX die 
nauigauisse, contra uero Hieronem regem CCXX naues effectas diebus XLV tradit L. Piso... I do not think 
the reference to Duilius necessarily comes from the historian L. Calpurnius Piso (cos. 133) pace Bleckmann 
(2002), p.130 (and cf. Peter, HRRel. fr.29). Flor. 1.18.7: Duilio Cornelioque consulibus etiam mari congredi 
ausus est. tum quidem ipsa uelocitas classis comparatae uictoriae auspicium fuit. intra enim sexagensimum 
diem quam caesa silua fuerat centum sexaginta nauium classis in anchoris stetit, ut non arte factae, sed 
quodam munere deorum conuersae in naues atque mutatae arbores uiderentur. For the plausibility of this 
claim see Thiel (1954), p.172.  
 Cf. De uir. ill. 38.1: Gnaeus Duellius primo Punico bello dux contra Carthaginienses missus, cum uideret 
eos multum mari posse, classem ualidam fabrefecit et manus ferreas cum irrisu hostium primus instituit...  
 Polybius, who does not record the names of the officials responsible for constructing the ships and 
collecting and training the crews, provides the only hint of Scipios involvement by stating that he had given 
orders to the  to sail for Sicily whenever the fleet was equipped () before he left Italy 
(1.21.1-4). The verb  relates to preparing a ship or a fleet which had already been built (cf. the 
Latin instruere), which indicates that Scipio had been in Italy during the construction of the fleet. Yet, the 
credibility of Polybius statement may be questioned in light of his dubious claim that Scipio had been 
assigned the command of the fleet, as discussed in Ch.I.iv. If Scipio was in some way involved with the 
initial preparations  which must remain highly speculative  Duilius would have been able to monopolise 
the credit after his successes and Scipios own disastrous capture at the island of Lipara. Cf. Bleckmann 
(2002), p.129, n.5.  
 Thiel (1954), p.170 with n.332 and p.172 with n.344. Cf. Forsythe (1994), p.358f; Lazenby (1996), p.41 
and p.63; Le Bohec (2003), p.65; and Dart (2012), p.1007f. 
I.iii. The creation of a new consular fleet: the naval preparations  
I) The notion that the Kalends of May was fixed as the date on which the consuls 
took office during the First Punic War is solely based on the fact that the vast majority of 
triumphs celebrated by consuls took place between 18 January and 13 April.
 Mommsen 
hypothesised from this that new consuls would have taken office in late spring and 
probably on 1 May  i.e. following the return and potential triumphs of the previous 
consuls.
 Whilst this is a plausible suggestion, the consular year could well have been 
much more fluid and without a fixed start date, as suggested for an earlier period by 
several cases from the fifth and fourth centuries.
 According to Zonaras, the Roman fleet 
was prepared after the consuls of 261 had returned home.
 It is possible, therefore, that 
they conducted the elections and then abdicated soon afterwards (i.e. in the winter of 
261/260).  
II) Even if Duilius entered the consulship on 1 May, there is also no reason to 
presume that the consular year (i.e. the Roman calendar) was synchronised with the solar 
year (i.e. Julian calendar).
 If the former was ahead of the latter by a significant number of 
days, then Duilius would have had even more time to carry out the necessary naval 
 Mommsen (1859), p.101f with n.178. 
 Ibid. The theory is still held in Mommsen (1887), I, p.599, but note his added caution, which highlights the 
fragility of the hypothesis (emphasis mine): Es ist dies, wenn nicht bereits in der zweiten Hlfte des fnften 
Jahrhunderts, wo vielleicht schon der 1. Mai als fester Antrittstag der Consuln bestanden hat, sptestens kurz 
vor 537, wahrscheinlich 532 in der Weise festgesetz worden, dass damals der 15 Mrz als Antrittstag fixirt. 
 See now Pina Polo (2011), p.13-16 and esp. p.14 with n.18. There is only one example (from 252) of a 
consul triumphing on 13 April between 275 and 222, for which see further Inscr. Ital. XIII, I, p.72-79 and 
p.546-550. 
 Zonar. 8.10.  
 See Morgan (1977), p.89-117 and esp. p.95-97 for the argument that the Roman calendar was around forty 
days in advance of the Julian when Duilius and Scipio took office in 260 (assuming this was on 1 May = 
between 8 March and 14 March by the Julian calendar). Whilst Morgans arguments are ingenious, they are 
by no means conclusive and, in my opinion, can only be used to highlight the possibility that the Roman 
calendar was ahead of the solar calendar in 260. See now especially the criticisms in Rosenstein (2004), App. 
2, p.176-179. We can also note that the fact that Duilius triumphed in an intercalary month at least suggests 
that a discrepancy existed in 260, for which see Inscr. Ital. XIII, I, p.76f and Michels (1967), p.16-18 and 
p.145-172. 
I.iii. The creation of a new consular fleet: the naval preparations  
preparations before the close of the summer sailing season around mid-September by the 
solar year (assuming this was adhered to).
III) Finally, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Duilius was able to 
oversee the construction, even if this only began in May, and still launch within sixty days 
around the beginning of July 260.
There are no chronological grounds, therefore, for questioning the evidence that 
Duilius was responsible for constructing and equipping the fleet in 260. We have already 
seen that the inscription recording Duilius achievements of 260 explicitly boasts that he 
was the first consul to have equipped (ornare) and constructed (parare) the fleet.  
The size and expense of this fleet and the subsequent fleets prepared during the 
First Punic War  alongside the prestige connected with their construction  meant that the 
naval preparations were considered to be a consular preserve from 260 onwards.
Duumuiri nauales are completely unattested in the surviving evidence between 282 and 
181, at which time their functions do not appear to have included the equipping (ornare) 
and refitting (reficere) of ships.
 It remains possible, however, that special boards were 
intermittently appointed during this period, but were simply too minor to have been 
recorded in the surviving literary evidence.
 Indeed, new epigraphic evidence is to be 
 See Veg. Mil. 4.39 for the sailing season being 10 March to 11 November, although 27 May to 14 
September is recorded as the safe period. Cf. Beresford (2013), p.14-16. 
 For the launch within sixty days see Plin. HN. 16.192 and Flor. 1.18.7, as quoted in n.44. 
 Cf. Ch.I.ii.  
 Records of duumuiri nauales appear in 282 (Livy, Per. 12; App. Samn. 7.1; Dio Cass. fr. 39.4); 181 (Livy, 
40.18.7-8; 40.26.8; and 40.28.7); 180 (Livy, 40.42.8-10); and 178 (Livy, 41.1.3). Note especially Livy, 
40.26.8 in which the use of iis (in the dative case) would suggest that the ships were fitted for them in 181: 
duumuiri nauales creati C. Matienus et C. Lucretius, nauesque iis ornatae sunt, Matienoque, cuius ad 
Gallicum sinum prouincia erat, imperatum est, ut classem primo quoque tempore duceret in Ligurum oram, 
si quo usui esse L. Aemilio atque exercitui eius posset... (a/ab would surely be included if it were ablative, 
unless one argues that this fell out of the manuscript tradition). Cf. Livy, 40.18.7-8 for their mandate and the 
order for them to man the ships (complere). Furthermore, we should note that the praetor urbanus was given 
the task of repairing (reficere) the old ships in 208 (Livy, 27.22.12-13) and of repairing (reficere) and 
equipping (parare) ships in 172 (Livy, 42.27.1-2), for which see Ch.II.ii. Cf. Dart (2012), p.1010-1012. 
 The duumuiri nauales were almost certainly non-annual magistrates appointed on an ad hoc basis, for 
which see Oakley (2005a), p.394-396; Briscoe (2008), p.458; and Dart (2012).  
I.iii. The creation of a new consular fleet: the naval preparations  
found on recently recovered bronze rostra, which were mostly sunk around the Egadi 
Islands during the final naval battle of the First Punic War in 242.
 One rostrum is 
engraved with the names of two individuals belonging to a board of six (sexuiri) who 
approved (probauere) something, which may allude to the casting of the ram or even to the 
successful completion of the contract for the entire ship (especially if the ram was one of 
the last parts of the ship to be fitted).
 Although we do not know the exact function of 
these minor officials, it is reasonable to suppose that they were appointed either to assist 
the consuls (as subordinates) or, perhaps, even to take charge of a single ad hoc 
shipbuilding project in the absence of more senior magistrates.
 In any case, there would 
have been less need to appoint special boards to take overall charge of the naval 
preparations, such as the duumuiri nauales of 311, after the consuls had assumed overall 
responsibility for the naval preparations in 260. 
The evidence from the rostra also uniquely reveals a significant quaestorian role in 
the naval preparations, as several are inscribed with the names of two quaestors who also 
approved (probauere) something (which, again, may be related to the casting of the rams 
 See Tusa and Royal (2012) for the preliminary report and esp. p.12-25 and p.42-45 with further 
bibliography p.46-48. Further evidence is also still emerging: e.g. the retrieval of Egadi 9 and Egadi 10  
located on the seafloor at the time of writing  is planned for the summer 2013 season. The date of the battle 
is commonly thought by scholars to have been 10 March by the Roman calendar based on Eutr. 2.27.2, for 
which cf. Walbank (1957), p.124f. 
 Tusa and Roya (2012), p.43 with the reading of the inscription from Egadi 1 by J.R.W. Prag: C(aios) 
Sestio(s) P(ublii) f(ilios) | Q(uintos) Salonio(s) Q(uinti) [f(ilios)] | SEX VIROE[-?--] | probave[re]. As Prag 
notes in Tusa and Royal (2012), p.43f, n.88, the letters following uiro(m) or uir(i) could well represent an 
abbreviation of the boards role and may be compared with the Gracchan termini: e.g. C. Sempronius Ti. f., | 
Ap. Claudius C. f., | P. Licinius P. f. | IIIuir(ei) a(gris) i(udicandis) a(dsignandis). | K(ardo) VII (ILLRP 
470). For an alternative and, in my opinion, less probable restoration of Egadi 1 cf. Gnoli (2012a), esp. p.64-
69 and Gnoli (2012b), p.81 with n.7: C(aios) Sestio(s) P(ubli) f(ilios) | Q(uintos) Salonio(s) Q(uinti) [f(ilios)] 
| sex uir{i} en[bolum] | probave[re. For the casting of the ram after the ships construction compare now 
Murray (2012), p.35-37 for evidence from the Athlit ram (discovered just off Haifa in 1980).  
 It should be emphasized that this rostrum  which was actually obtained from a private collection, having 
apparently been found by a fisherman north of Levanzo Island  stands out as an anomaly in comparison 
with the other rostra discovered in situ (see Royal and Tusa (2012), p.11). Furthermore, this ram may well 
date to a later period (e.g. Second Punic War) in contrast to the other Egadi rams from the First Punic War 
pace Gnoli (2011) and Gnoli (2012a), p.66f.  
I.iii. The creation of a new consular fleet: the naval preparations  
(or the bronze used?) or the fulfilment of the contract for the ship).
 This most probably 
represents the quaestors responsibility for financing the construction project from the state 
treasury, given that probare is very much part of the language of contracting (with 
locatio).
 It is reasonable to presume that the quaestors regularly continued to play a role 
in administering the finance for shipbuilding after the First Punic War and that this would 
have been under the overall direction of the consuls from 260 onwards (whether the task 
was delegated by the consuls themselves or ex senatus consulto).
Indeed, there is evidence for the continued involvement of the consuls in the naval 
preparations in three major shipbuilding projects during the First Punic War (254, 250 and 
249).
 In the first case, Polybius records that both consuls equipped a fleet of 220 ships 
with the verb , which relates to the Latin ornare and instruere and, therefore, 
further suggests that duumuiri nauales were no longer responsible for this task.
 Tusa and Royal (2012), p.44 with the preliminary reading of cast inscription on Egadi 4 by J.R.W. Prag:

Compare further Egadi 6, Egadi 7 and Egadi 8. Egadi 11 was most recently recovered and apparently 
records the same quaestors (non uidi).  
 Cf. Polyb. 6.13.2. Indeed, the rostra provide good evidence showing that quaestors could contract for 
opera publica. Cf. Lintott (1999), p.135. For an (admittedly much) later record of a quaestors role in 41 of a 
locatio and probatio see e.g. ILLRP 160 (stone tablet, Rome): P. Servilio, L. Antonio co(n)s(ulibus) | a.d. IIII

contracts.  
 See e.g. Cic. Flac. 30 (61 B.C.): Quid? nos hic nonne ipso Pompeio auctore Silano et Murena consulibus 
decreuimus ut classis in Italia nauigaret? nonne eo ipso tempore cum L. Flaccus in Asia remiges imperabat, 
nos hic in mare superum et inferum sestertium ter et quadragiens erogabamus? Quid? postero anno nonne 
M. Curtio et P. Sextilio quaestoribus pecunia in classem est erogata? Quid? hoc omni tempore equites in ora 
maritima non fuerunt?... Cf. Gnoli (2012b), p.86-97, who suggests that there was a connection between the 
position of the quaestors named on the rostra inscriptions and the so-called quaestores classici referred to by 
John Lydus (Mag. 1.27) from c.267 (cf. Livy, Per. 15). 
 Unfortunately, there is no surviving record of who was responsible for the shipbuilding project of 257/256 
(Polyb. 1.26). The naval preparations of 243/2 apparently began before the consuls came to office (Polyb. 
1.59.8), although it is likely that they were completed by the consuls in 242 (cf. Zonar. 8.16-17). Cf. Gnoli 
(2011).

also the Latin equivalent proposed by Schweighuser (1822), p.246 s.v.  , . It is 
unclear whether the consuls Cn. Cornelius Scipio Asina and A. Atilius Calatinus played a role in the fleets 
construction (which Polybius states took place within three months), since  relates to equipping a 
ship or a fleet which had already been built. Their involvement in the construction is a distinct possibility, 
I.iii. The creation of a new consular fleet: the naval preparations  
Secondly, Polybius hints that the consuls were involved in the construction and 
preparation of fifty ships in 250.
 Thirdly, Zonaras states that one consul remained in 
Rome preparing a fleet while his colleague hastened to Lilybaeum in 249.
We can conclude, then, that the consuls continued to take responsibility for the 
preparation of major fleets after 260, although the limited nature of the evidence makes it 
impossible to determine in any greater detail how the naval preparations were organised in 
practice during the First Punic War. For example, we have seen in the previous section 
how the people elected duumuiri nauales for equipping and refitting ships in 311, but there 
is no surviving evidence, aside from the rostra, for how the naval preparations were 
assigned during the First Punic War. Indeed, both Polybius and Zonaras use non-specific 
language such as   or a third-person plural verb.
 Polybius, at least, may have 
referred to some of the institutions associated with the fleet, since he wrote that he would 
explain why the Romans could not man as many ships or put to sea with as large fleets by 
the mid-second century in his discussion of the   i.e. in his second explanation 
for the development of the Roman .
 This may have provided valuable information 
about the role played by Roman officials and allies in the manning of fleets. However, his 
assessment, assuming he ever made one, does not survive in the fragmentary sixth book of 
especially as the consular year may have started before May, for which see above. Cf. De Sanctis (1916),

      . See further Walbank (1957), p.101. Whilst 
we cannot know for certain whether the consuls C. Atilius Regulus and L. Manlius Vulso were responsibile 
for the construction, it is probable that this was the case given that they only set sail for Sicily,

I.iii. The creation of a new consular fleet: the naval preparations  
his Histories;
 and he shows little interest in the political, institutional and administrative 
arrangements made in Rome and Italy in his other books. Meanwhile, Zonaras, writing in 
the twelfth century A.D., provides only a summary of the history of the First Punic War 
from the (now fragmentary) books 11-12 of Cassius Dios Roman History.  
More detailed evidence for the organisation of the naval preparations is to be found 
only in the annalistic sections of the surviving books of Livys History for the period 
between 218 and 167.
 These sections usually list, among other things, decisions taken by 
the Senate on the annual allocation and preparation of military resources, including fleets 
(part of the so-called ornatio prouinciae).
 Although some scholars have questioned the 
authenticity of these details, it is clear that Livys annalistic sources had access to authentic 
details of senatorial activities and archival material.
Chapter II will analyse these crucial details for the purposes of contextualising and 
elucidating the consular responsibility for the task of preparing fleets, which is not 
revealed in the surviving evidence for the First Punic War.
 The chapter will also examine 
whether the role played by senior magistrates in the naval preparations developed between 
218 and 167, as the number of elected magistrates (viz. praetors) increased and the empire 
expanded. Brennan, for example, has already observed that praetors were given 
responsibility for naval preparations from 208 onwards and he has argued that this 
 It is notable that there is a lacuna directly following the description of the army at 6.42.6. As Walbank 
(2002b), p.280 rightly observed in discussing book 6: This [the army] is important, since it was through the 
army that Rome rose to world power during the fifty-three years from 220 to 167. The same rationale 
applies to the fleet, but we can only wonder whether Polybius discussed this after the army. For the question 
of how book 6 fits within Polybius general scheme cf. Walbank (1972), p.130-156; Lintott (1999), p.16-26; 
Millar (2002c), p.23-36; and Walbank (2002b), p. 277-292.  
 For the annalistic form see further Rich (2011), p.3-8 and p.2, n.1 for modern references. 
 For the ornatio prouinciae note the discussion in Balsdon (1937). 
 See the careful analysis of Oakley (1997), p.21-108, esp. p.38f and p.57 with Oakley (2005b), Addenda 
and Corrigenda, p.475-492 (concentrating on Livys first decade). Cf. Walsh (1961), p.122, p.165f; Briscoe 
(1973), p.1-12; Phillips (1974); Frier (1979); Stewart (1998), p.24f; Brennan (2000), p.8-10; Rich (2005); 
Richardson (2008), p.13; Rich (2011), esp. p.11f; and now Satterfield (2012).  
 Indeed, it should be acknowledged that my approach is to a certain extent dictated by the survival of 
Livys evidence and, therefore, by his own approach (and that of his predecessors). Note especially Livy, 
praef. 9. 
I.iii. The creation of a new consular fleet: the naval preparations  
represented a permanent devolution of consular responsibility.
 I shall consider the merits 
(or otherwise) of this argument; and, alongside this, I shall explore to what extent the 
various historical contexts influenced the assignment of the preparation of the fleet to 
consuls and praetors. This will involve taking into account the institutional mechanisms 
for assigning these tasks and, in particular, the important role played by the Senate. It is 
intended that the exploration of these themes will not only illuminate some of the 
important functions of senior magistrates and the Senate, but also some general Roman 
administrative practices between 218 and 167. 
The evidence for naval preparations becomes extremely scarce after the loss of 
Livys History from 167 onwards. Both Thiel and Steinby ended their studies of Roman 
fleets  or rather Roman sea-power  in the year 167, partially owing to the loss of 
Livys History (i.e. after book 45), but also because Roman hegemony was no longer 
threatened by a strong naval power after this date.
 However, it will be important to 
extend my own study beyond 167 in order to consider what, if anything, changed in how 
naval tasks were defined and assigned between then and 49 (at which point the assignment 
of naval tasks and the use of large fleets became chaotic with the widespread use of fleets 
in the civil wars).
 A short epilogue to Chapter II will explore what we are able to 
determine about how naval preparations were assigned in the Late Republic, despite the 
absence of Livys evidence. This will rely mainly on the scattered references to the 
assignment of fleets to be found in later Greek authors  viz. Appian, Plutarch and Cassius 
 Brennan (2000), p. 104 and App. VI, p.658f. 
 See Thiel (1946), p.414f and cf. Steinby (2007), p.13, n.2: This is where Livys extant account comes to 
an end. It also marks the point when the Romans had won the race for thalassocracy both in the western and 
eastern Mediterranean and changed their policy about allies. Thiel (1954), p.vi had planned to write another 
volume on the period between 167 and 31, but this never materialised.  
 As far as I am aware, only the recent books by Pitassi (2009) and (2012) consider Roman fleets for the 
entire period of the Roman Republic, but these may be characterised as general surveys and do not deal with 
the issues raised here in any detail.  
I.iv. The creation of a new consular fleet: the command  
I.iv. The creation of a new consular fleet: the command 
We have seen in the previous section that Romes decision to construct her first large fleet 
of 120 ships in 260 resulted in a new consular responsibility for the naval preparations. 
The importance of this new fleet also led to a second institutional development with the 
creation of a new specific consular naval assignment. Significantly, this was almost 
certainly the first time that a naval command was explicitly associated with a prouincia. 
The consuls had earlier proceeded to Sicily with their armies in ships mostly acquired from 
allies (e.g. Tarentum, Locri, Elea and Naples) between 264 and 261.
 These ships were 
not directly associated with the consular military assignments, as suggested by Polybius 
brief summary of the arrangements made for 263:  
When news of the successes of Appius [Claudius Caudex, cos. 264] and his legions 
reached Rome, they elected Manius Otacilius [Crassus] and Manius Valerius 
[Maximus Messala] consuls, and dispatched their whole force () and both 
commanders into Sicily.
In contrast to this, Polybius states that Cn. Cornelius Scipio (cos.) was specifically 
appointed to command the naval force (  ) for 260.
 The fleet would 
have naturally been included with this assignment, which can be compared with Polybius 
report of the Romans decision in 250 to revert to the original plan of sending out the 
consuls to campaign with a fleet and naval force.
 Meanwhile, he states that C. Duilius 
 See Polyb. 1.20.14 for the use of ships belonging to allies in 264, although the 20 ships previously used by 
the duumuiri nauales may have also been available, as noted by Dart (2012), p.1009 with n.48. For the 
question of whether Rome actually had treaties with these cities see now the re-appraisal by Rich (2008), 
esp. p.69f.

(251 B.C.). 
 Polyb. 1.21.4:           ... Cf. 
1.23.1. Polybius does not record how the appointment was made, but we know from Zonaras that the 
consular prouinciae were decided by sortitio (8.10).

         ... Cf. Oros. 4.10.2. For the 
I.iv. The creation of a new consular fleet: the command      
(cos.) was the commander of the land forces and that he only took charge of the fleet after 
Scipio had been captured by the Carthaginians on the island of Lipara.
 Zonaras twelfth-
century epitome of Cassius Dios Roman History supports the assignment of separate 
naval and land commands, although it reports that Duilius was given command of the fleet 
rather than Scipio:  
...the Romans put together a fleet and put one of the consuls, Gaius Duilius, in 
command of it, while they sent his colleague, Gaius [Gnaeus] Cornelius [Scipio 
Asina] into Sicily. The latter, neglecting the war on land, which he had been 
assigned by lot, sailed with the ships which he had to Lipara, on the understanding 
that it was to be betrayed to him...
It is impossible to reconcile fully the conflicting evidence from Polybius and 
Zonaras concerning which consul was assigned the fleet in 260. The vast majority of 
scholars have assumed that Polybius provides the most reliable assessment, given that he 
wrote much closer to the time of the events than Cassius Dio.
 However, Bleckmann 
recently made a persuasive case for the validity of the assignments found in Zonaras.
suggests that Polybius was using a source favourable to Scipio and die scipionische 
Familientradition, which deliberately interchanged the consular prouinciae in order to 
terminology see further Mauersberger et al. (2003), col. 569 s.v.  . and Mauersberger and Helms 
(2006b), col. 1669f s.v. . For what it is worth, note also that Schweighuser (1822), p. 288 s.v. 
 translates    (Polyb. 1.21.4) as copiae nauales (cf. e.g. Polyb. 1.21.4 and Livy, 
23.28.3 and 32.17.3). The phrase      is conceivably a translation of the 
Latin cum classe et copia nauali. Polybius figures for the number of ships in 1.41.3 could well originate 
with Fabius Pictor (so Walbank (1957), p.103) and so one may speculate that Fabius was the source for this 
report (and, perhaps, even the formula cum classe et copia nauali). If the translation is correct, it is worth 
noting that this may be comparable with the contemporary evidence from lines 6-7 of the inscription from 
Duilius columna rostrata (copiae and clases), for which see Ch.I.iii

the arguments of Beck (2005a), p.224f; and Beck (2013), p.132-136. For the value of Cassius Dio (via 
Zonaras) and his use of an annalistic source independent of the Livian tradition see Bleckmann (2002), p.35-
56 and Bleckmann (2011), p.172f. Note also Eckstein (1987), p.333 and Lazenby (1996), p.6. 
I.iv. The creation of a new consular fleet: the command      
minimise Scipios culpability in sailing to Lipara and to credit Scipio with preparing the 
armaments used in Duilius victory at Mylae.
 In his most convincing argument, he 
focusses on lines 6-7 of the inscription from Duilius columna rostrata, which, as we have 
seen, boasts that Duilius was the first consul to equip and construct the fleet.
 The notion 
that Duilius was responsible for these tasks offers support for Zonaras claim that he had 
been assigned to the command of the fleet and was not in Sicily when Scipio was captured, 
especially given that Scipio left Italy before the fleet had even been equipped (as Polybius 
admits).
An even greater problem, for the purposes of this research, is that the details of the 
provincial assignments are highly compressed in both the accounts of Polybius and 
Zonaras. We are able to gather that the two named consular prouinciae would have been 
separated  almost certainly for the first time  into one sphere on land (with the army) and 
another sphere on the sea (with the fleet). Indeed, the reference provided by Zonaras to 
Scipios lot (the war on land) at least indicates that this would have been associated with 
his prouincia; and it may follow that the war on the sea was connected with the other 
consular prouincia. Yet, were the war on land and the war on sea explicitly designated 
as part of the prouinciae or implicitly understood from other designations? If the former, 
would the war have been specifically defined as being against the Carthaginians? More 
importantly, was the separation of land and naval spheres facilitated by the designation of 
 Bleckmann (2002), p.131-139 with examples of the falsification of histories p.131-134. I am not 
convinced by Bleckmanns argument that Polybius pro-Scipionic source was deliberately responding more 
favourably to (and distorting) an older negative tradition (preserved in Zonaras and the annalistic tradition), 
as this essentially amounts to special pleading. Cf. Beck (2013), p.134f with n.44, who proposes, in contrast 
to Bleckmann, that Polybius himself interchanged the consular prouinciae. Furthermore, if Polybius wished 
to credit Scipio with preparing the fleet, as Bleckmann suggests, it is strange that he was not more explicit 
about it, for which cf. Polyb. 1.21.1-4. It is worth noting that Polyb. 1.22.1 and 1.23.1 represent Scipio as a 
victim of chance ( and  respectively), rather than his own negligence (as implied by 
Zonar. 8.10), as Beck (2005b), p.691 highlighted. 
 Bleckmann (2002), p.129-131. See also Beck (2005a), p.224f and Beck (2013), p.134.  
 See Polyb. 1.21.1-4 and Zonar. 8.11. Cf. Walbank (1957), p.76 s.v. 4: The famous inscription on the 
columna rostrata...attributes the institution of the fleet to Duilius; perhaps, therefore, both consuls shared 
responsibility, though Scipio was in command first. 
I.iv. The creation of a new consular fleet: the command      
the fleet as one consular prouincia? Or was the fleet merely assigned to one of the consuls 
as a military resource, separately from the allotment of prouinciae, in the same way that 
armies were ordinarily allocated to the consuls ex senatus consulto?   
The difficulties in answering these questions and determining how the prouinciae 
were actually named and defined in 260 are reflected in the different names modern 
scholars have used to describe them.
 This problem is symptomatic of the general scarcity 
of explicit evidence for the prouinciae named during the First Punic War and explains, 
perhaps, why there have been few discussions of these in the modern scholarship.
 As we 
have seen in the previous sections, Polybius was more concerned with how the activities of 
commanders outside of Italy contributed to the development of the Roman  than with 
the details of the administrative arrangements made each year in Rome. Indeed, he does 
not usually report the elections at Rome or the assignment of prouinciae; and he does not 
even specifically refer to a Roman prouincia (with ) in his surviving books.
 It is 
also worth recalling that Zonaras gives only a summary of Dios Roman History, which 
itself was unlikely to have given more details about the prouinciae.
It is a great pity that we do not have the lost books of Livys History for this period 
(i.e. books 16-19), as they would have provided annual lists of the names of prouinciae 
and their allotment to specific magistrates.
 This is especially regrettable, given that the 
First Punic War was clearly a formative period for the use of a naval prouincia.  
 E.g. Bleckmann (2011), p. 172: The main sources, Polybius and Cassius Dio (Zonaras), agree only that in 
260 one of the two consuls received the prestigious and successful provincia of the fleet command, while the 
other was to wage the less spectacular land war. Cf. e.g. Bleckmann (2002), p.116 (provincia der 
Seekriegfhrung), p.136 (provincia des Seekriegs); and Beck (2013), p.135 (naval provincia). It is 
telling that the majority of scholars refrain from naming the prouinciae. 
 See e.g. Polyb. 1.25.1-4 and Zonar. 8.12 for the lack of explicit detail concerning the prouinciae of 257. 
 See Richardson (1979a), esp. p.4-6. Cf. Dubuisson (1985), p.29; Ferrary (1988), p.16-18; and Richardson 
(2008), p.47f.    
 Cf. e.g. Dio Cass. 11.19-21 and Zonar. 8.12 (for the beginning of 256).  
 The summaries of these books provided by the Periochae do not record the details of sortitiones or the 
prouinciae and the same is mostly true for the Livian tradition found in the later authors Florus, Orosius and 
I.iv. The creation of a new consular fleet: the command      
Once again, then, we must depend on the lists from the surviving books of Livys 
History for the later period between 218 and 167 in order to gain a better understanding of 
how naval prouinciae were defined and assigned. In addition to the details of the allocation 
of military resources, as discussed in the previous section, these lists contain reports of the 
elections of magistrates and promagistrates, as well as the allotment and/or assignment of 
prouinciae.
I shall discuss the reliability of Livys lists of the annually named prouinciae in 
greater detail in Chapter III, as these will provide the fundamental source of evidence for 
answering and expanding on the questions which were raised in the above discussion of 
the consular prouinciae of 260. The chapter will begin by examining the concept of the 
prouincia and how this has been approached in the existing modern scholarship. It will 
then analyse the information provided by Livy in order to answer the question of how the 
fleet was defined as a specific prouincia between 218 and 167. The following part will 
consider what this definition reveals about why and when the fleet was named (or not 
named) in the consular and praetorian sortitiones during this period. These questions have 
not yet received detailed treatment in the existing modern scholarship, which has tended to 
focus on the role played by the prouincia in the provincialisation of Roman territories 
and/or in the conceptualisation of the Roman Empire.
 However, as we shall see in the 
course of this study, the answers to the questions of how, why and when the fleet was 
named as a prouincia can offer significant contributions to our wider understanding of the 
important uses of prouinciae more widely during the Republic. 
Eutropius. Cf. especially Oakley (1997), p.67-72 for a discussion of the prouinciae named by Livy for the 
fourth and early third centuries in books 6-10. 
 See Ch.I.iii with the relevant modern literature. 
 As noted in Ch.I.ii, Brennan (2000), p.184 is the only scholar to have examined the prouincia classis in 
any detail within his discussion of praetorian prouinciae.  
I.iv. The creation of a new consular fleet: the command      
Chapter IV will then investigate what, if anything, changed in the assignment of 
naval prouinciae between 167 and 49. There is no evidence that the fleet was named as a 
prouincia after the first year of the Third Punic War in 149 until 43. This could be, in part, 
the result of the unfortunate loss of Livys History (and with it, his lists of prouinciae) 
after 167; but it is most probably owing to the fact that Rome was no longer challenged by 
a strong naval power after her defeat of Perseus of Macedon one year earlier. Nonetheless, 
there is sufficient evidence for us to consider how and why other prouinciae, which 
involved the use of naval forces, were named between 146 and 49.  
The chapter will seek to explore, then, how and why prouinciae were defined in the 
late second and early first centuries by focussing on the surviving evidence for the Cilician 
naval command undertaken by M. Antonius around 103/102 and the Mediterranean-wide 
assignments given to M. Antonius Creticus in 75/74 and, more famously, Cn. Pompeius 
Magnus in 67. Cicero and Sallust provide some important contemporary (or near 
contemporary) details about these commands. This will be supplemented by evidence from 
later authors  most notably Appian, Cassius Dio, Plutarch and Velleius Paterculus  as 
well as several extremely valuable inscriptions.
 This evidence will be used 
predominantly to investigate whether the principles associated with the use of the 
prouincia in the third and early second centuries, as will be explored in Chapter III, still 
applied in the late second and early first centuries.  
The chapter will first examine how the prouincia of M. Antonius was defined 
around 103/102 and what this can tell us about how Cilicia was first viewed as a prouincia 
in the late second and early first centuries. It will then give a full assessment of the 
 The inscriptions include two copies of a law of around 100 on the eastern prouinciae from Cnidos and 
Delphi and an Asian customs law set up in Ephesus in 62 A.D., which contains a number of clauses dating to 
the late second century B.C. In addition, Lactantius and the Ciceronian scholiasts preserve some invaluable 
evidence for the command of M. Antonius Creticus. We also have the relatively limited evidence provided 
by Livys Periochae, Florus, Eutropius and Orosius; and some useful details from Pliny the Elders Naturalis 
Historia and Strabos Geography. 
I.iv. The creation of a new consular fleet: the command      
Mediterranean-wide prouinciae assigned to M. Antonius Creticus and Cn. Pompeius 
Magnus in 75/74 and 67. In doing so, it will also explore how these prouinciae related to 
the Romans conceptualisation of their empire and, in particular, the Mediterranean coastal 
regions, in the late second and early first centuries. This is especially pertinent in light of 
the observation, made by several scholars, that there was increasing Roman 
acknowledgement of empire between the last quarter of the second century and first 
quarter of the first century. With this in mind, I shall consider, for example, whether the 
naval assignments reflect a Roman conception of the empire as encompassing nearly the 
whole inhabited world (recalling Polybius explanation of his underlying theme of his 
Histories quoted earlier).
 The underlying question throughout these discussions will be 
how and why the definitions of the prouinciae associated with naval commands developed 
between the second and first centuries. 
The thesis will conclude with an Epilogue examining the position of Sextus 
Pompeius, the son of Cn. Pompeius Magnus, who was assigned an extraordinary prouincia 
classis et ora maritima in the civil war context of 43. This was almost certainly the last 
time that a prouincia classis was named and so it will be important to consider how and 
why it re-appeared after over one hundred years absence. What, if anything, changed? In 
this final discussion, the various strands of the earlier chapters will be brought together and 
some concluding remarks will be made about the contribution of this research to our 
understanding of the nature and use of the prouincia in the Roman Republic.

Chapter II: Roman magistrates and naval preparations during 
the Roman Republic 
II.i. Introduction 
We have seen in Chapter I that C. Duilius was involved in the construction and equipping 
of 100 quinqueremes and 20 triremes in 260 and that he was later explicitly recorded on 
his columna rostrata as being the first consul to equip and prepare naval forces and a fleet: 
Enque eodem mac[istratud bene | r]em navebos marid consol primos c[eset 
copiasque | c]lasesque navales primos ornavet pa[ravetque]...
The event, therefore, marked an important development of a new consular 
responsibility for the preparation of fleets and naval forces, which is confirmed by the 
evidence for consular involvement in the shipbuilding projects of 254, 250, 249 and 218.
As discussed in Chapter I, this institutional development was clearly linked to the changes 
in the size and the expense of the fleets: the consuls, as the supreme magistrates of the res 
publica, were the obvious officials to entrust with such a large task. Indeed, they were 
already responsible for levying soldiers for the terrestrial army  another significant 
expense.
 However, more detailed information about how the naval preparations were 
arranged in practice is only to be found in the annalistic sections of the surviving books 
of Livys History of a later period between 218 and 167.
 These sections usually list the 
annual allocation of military resources and the magistrates with the responsibility for 
overseeing their preparation, as is illustrated in the arrangements made in 214:

Whilst the detail provided in these lists limits the scope of what can be said about 
the naval preparations at the lower administrative levels, it nonetheless provides some 
crucial evidence which enables an understanding of the important roles played by the 
Senate, senatus consulta and senior magistrates.
 It also allows one to trace how the 
magisterial roles might have developed during a period (218-167) in which military 
activity in multiple geographical spheres tested the efficiency and flexibility of the Roman 
administrative system. This will be the focus of this chapter. It is worth, first, however, 
briefly outlining three preliminary observations, based on the arrangements of 214 (above), 
which will provide a framework for understanding the fundamental role played by the 
consuls in the naval preparations (which I take to be the construction, equipping and 
manning of Roman fleets). 
I) We can see that there was a close connection between the consular dilectus  the 
annual military levy usually announced by consular edict ex senatus consulto  and the 
naval preparations.
 This is directly implied by Livys statement that Fabius only 
 Livy, 24.11.1-6. Cf. Livy, 21.17.2-4; Polyb. 3.41.1-3 (218 B.C.); Livy, 38.35.7-8 (188 B.C.); and 44.19.1-
2 (168 B.C.). For a detailed discussion of the number of legions see Brunt (1971), p.649-651 and see 
especially p.645-660 for a positive critique of the reliability of Livys lists of legions (which often appear 
together with fleet numbers) in response to the negative criticisms of Gelzer (1964), p.220-255. 
 Willems (1885), II, p.630-633 remains one of the few scholars to discuss the role of the Senate within the 
specific context of naval preparations.  
 Liebenam (1903), RE, 5, s.v. dilectus, col. 592 long ago noticed the connection between the army and 
the fleet. Cf. especially Livy, 30.2.6 (203 B.C.): tria milia militum in eam classem ex decreto patrum 
consules scripserunt et duas legiones urbanas ad incerta belli. See also now Pina Polo (2011a), p.84f with 
both ancient and modern references. 
II.i. Introduction      
presided over the election of censors after the levy had been held and 100 new ships 
launched.
 The link is most obviously explained by the fact that consular edicts were 
normally used to enlist soldiers for the army, which would have naturally also applied to 
the soldiers and sailors on board the ships.
II) Livy reveals that the senatorial instructions given to the consuls in 214 involved 
the construction of 100 new ships (centum nauibus nouis).
 Although there is no record 
of how these new ships or their supplies and manpower were financed, the costs involved 
were likely to have been discussed within the meeting of the Senate presided over by the 
consuls at the start of the year and intimately bound up with the availability of funds in the 
aerarium.
 It is also likely that the cost of the new ships exacerbated the already severely 
depleted treasury and thereby contributed to a serious shortage of sailors.
 The consuls, 
therefore, had to issue yet another edict ex senatus consulto ordering private individuals to 
provide a certain number of sailors with a prescribed amount of pay, depending on their 
last census rating.
Livy claims that this was the first time that the classis Romana was equipped with 
so-called socii nauales (an ambiguous term including both Romans and non-Romans 
serving on board the ships) at private expense, which implies first that the Roman state 
was usually responsible for this.
 This can be traced at least as far back as the First Punic

definition given by Milan (1973), p.193-203 throughout this study. Milan concluded that Livy variably used

War, since Polybius mentions that private individuals had to finance the construction and 
equipping of a new fleet in 243/242 when there were no funds in the public treasury.
Arguably, the fact the ancient authors draw attention to specific instances in which it was 
not paid for by the state suggests that a regular practice existed before this time.
discussed in Chapter I, several bronze rostra from the final naval battle of the First Punic 
War  recently recovered from around the Egadi Islands  are inscribed with the names of 
two quaestors who approved (probauere) something (the bronze used in the ram (or its 
casting) or the fulfilment of the contract for building the ship?).
 This almost certainly 
represents their role in financing the construction of the ships and provides further 
confirmation that shipbuilding projects were connected with the funds in the aerarium.
III) There was probably a direct link between the above arrangements and the 
tributum  the annual financial levy (or tax) which was intended to pay for the costs of 
 Modern scholars have often highlighted the connection between the tributum and 
the dilectus and have supposed that the amount of tribute required each year was based on 
the variable expense of the military campaigns, such as the number of legions employed.
If this is so, then there is no reason why we should not imagine that the tributum would 
the phrase to include both nautae (e.g. 24.11.7-9) and remiges (e.g. 37.16.11) and also acknowledged that he 
sometimes employed the term in a loose (catch-all) sense to encompass milites classici (i.e. soldiers on the 
ships), yet he does not believe that le truppe di marina fossero di diritto socii navales... (p.201 with n.22).

 Cf. Zonar. 8.16.3-4, who records that the Romans kept away from naval warfare around 247 because of 
their misfortunes and the expenses involved, but that private individuals asked for some ships to use at their 
own expense and for their own profit.  
 See Ch.I.iii. 
 Ibid. See especially Lintott (1999), p.135, who, noting evidence for the title of quaestor urbanus and the 
link with the aerarium in documents from the late second century, suggests that, the supervision of the 
aerarium...is likely to have been the chief function of the urban quaestors from the beginning. 
 See e.g. Livy, 23.31.1-2 (215 B.C.) 
 See e.g. Brunt (1971), p.636, s.v. 5 and p.641; Nicolet (1976), esp. p.20, n.34; Nicolet (1980), p.153-

II.i. Introduction      
also have been calculated with naval construction, repairs, equipping and manning in 
mind.
The role that the consuls played in the naval preparations can be seen, then, in 
terms of their connection, as the most senior magistrates, to the military and financial 
arrangements  including the dilectus and the calculation of the amount of tributum 
required for the aerarium  made at the start of each consular year ex senatus consulto. 
This framework also provides the crucial context necessary for interpreting the cases in 
which other magistrates, viz. praetors, were assigned the task of constructing, repairing, 
equipping and manning ships in place of the consuls. The first concrete evidence for this 
dates to 208, when the Senate assigned the praetor urbanus the tasks of repairing 30 old 
warships at Ostia and of manning 20 new ships, despite the presence of both consuls in 
Rome: 
et P. Licinio Varo praetori urbano negotium datum ut naues longas triginta ueteres 
reficeret quae Ostiae erant et uiginti nouas naues sociis naualibus compleret, ut 
quinquaginta nauium classe oram maris uicinam urbi Romanae tueri posset.
As far as I know, Brennan is the only scholar to have noticed and highlighted the 
potential significance of this, which, he argues, led to a permanent devolution of consular 
responsibility for naval preparations in Italy: 
Henceforth, it was the urban praetor, assisted occasionally by one of his praetorian 
colleagues, who arranged for the construction or repair of ships and the drafting of 
personnel to man them, even if one or both consuls were in the city when these 
orders were given.
 Cf. Kondratieff (2004), p.24-32 for the hypothesis that C. Duilius (cos.) minted his famous aes signatum 
coinage in order to repay the tributum used for the preparation of the new fleet of 260 back to the populus 
Romanus. 
 Livy, 27.22.12-13. For the presence of the consuls at Rome see Livy, 27.23.1 and 27.25.6-10. 
 Brennan (2000), p.104 and App.VI, p.658f. Cf. Thiel (1946), p.125-133, who passes over the events of 
208 without mentioning any specific details about the shipbuilding. 
II.i. Introduction      
In support of this, he cites a number of examples from the Roman wars against 
Antiochus III (192-188) and Perseus (171-168) in which the praetor urbanus and 
(occasionally) other praetors were involved in preparing fleets.
 Prima facie, it might 
appear from these instances that the Senate had created a new institutional practice by 
assigning the preparation of the fleet to a praetor instead of the consuls in 208 given that 
both consuls were present in Rome. Yet, it is debatable that a single shift in the customary 
practice was enough to forge a permanent change to the mos maiorum, as outlined above. 
Instead, I shall argue that the change was by no means as marked as this and that the 
assignment of the naval preparations to praetors should be seen as temporary ad hoc 
responses to specific temporal factors: i) the date at which the preparations were ordered; 
ii) the availability of the consuls; iii) the military intelligence and military requirements 
(perceived or real); and iv) the availability of manpower and state finance.  
The next section (II.ii) of this chapter will analyse the evidence for the praetorian 
administration of naval preparations with these four factors in mind. This will question 
Brennans theory that the arrangements made in 208 set an institutional precedent for all 
future naval preparations and, instead, suggest that the use of praetors for the preparation 
of fleets can be better explained by the short-term benefits derived from freeing the 
consuls of this responsibility. The section will also briefly outline how the praetorian 
preparations were made possible by the important institutional developments that took 
place between the mid-third and early second centuries. The following part (II.iii) will then 
demonstrate that the traditional consular responsibility for preparing fleets actually 
continued alongside the general annual preparations for war after 208, which will further 
undermine Brennans claim that there was a permanent devolution of consular 
responsibility for the naval preparations. The last section (II.iv) will consider the limited

evidence for the role played by magistrates in naval preparations during the Late Republic 
and will point out some important developments in comparison with the preceding periods.  
II.ii. The (ad hoc) praetorian naval preparations between 218 and 167      
II.ii. The (ad hoc) praetorian naval preparations between 218 and 167 
We begin, then, with an examination of the context of the senatorial instructions given to 
P. Licinius Varus (pr. urb.) to repair 30 old ships at Ostia and man 20 new ships in 208, 
since Brennan claims that this case set the precedent for all future naval preparations.
The questions to be considered are whether this was in any sense exceptional and whether 
it really set such a unique precedent.  
With the first question above in mind, it is worth highlighting that the senatus 
consultum related specifically to the ships which Licinius was to use for the protection of 
the coastal region uicinam urbi Romanae.
 As Brennan recognised, this was presumably 
considered part of the responsibilities of the praetor urbanus, who was, after all, 
geographically based around the urbs (as the title indicates).
 The order clearly stemmed 
from a rumour that the Carthaginians were preparing a huge fleet to be directed against the 
coasts of Italy, Sicily and Sardinia;
 and it would have made little sense to detain the 
consuls with potentially arduous naval preparations when the rumour could easily have 
proved to be incorrect (as later turned out to be the case).
 In addition, the consuls were 
assigned the existing consular armies of the previous year and so could potentially have 
left Rome promptly without conducting a new levy.
 The praetor urbanus, as the on-
 Livy, 27.22.12-13, as quoted in Ch.II.i. 
 Cf. Thiel (1946), p.126f, n.324, who unconvincingly second-guesses the evidence by postulating that this 
was an, incorrect limitation, the southern coast being especially in need of protection.  
 Brennan (2000), p.658. For the praetor urbanus see also generally Brennan (2000), p.98-135 and esp. 
p.102f for his defence responsibilities. Cf. Bergk (2011), esp. p.68f. 
 Livy, 27.22.8-9.  
 It should be noted that a similar rumour had come to nothing in 210 and so the Senate may have taken this 
into consideration when making the arrangements for 208. See further Thiel (1946), p.109 and p.126f. There 
may have been further reasons to fear that the consuls would be unduly delayed, if Brunt (1971), p.668, n.2 is 
correct that there would have been problems manning the ships. In any case, as fate would have it, the 
consuls were delayed by prodigies, for which see e.g. Satterfield (2012), p.73, n.18. 
 The consuls were given permission to supplement their armies (Livy, 27.22.11), but they would have 
presumably delayed their judgement on whether this was necessary until they reached them. Cf. Livy, 
27.38.7-12 (207 B.C.).  
II.ii. The (ad hoc) praetorian naval preparations between 218 and 167      
hand imperium-holder, was more than sufficient for the task of preparing his own ships as 
necessary, which can be seen in terms of the unique circumstances of 208. 
In relation to the second question concerning whether the arrangements made in 
208 formed a precedent for all future naval preparations, a comparison with the decisions 
taken in 215 hints that a praetor was involved in naval preparations before 208. At the 
beginning of 215, the Senate decreed that Q. Fulvius Flaccus (pr. urb.) and M. Valerius 
Laevinus (pr. per.) should protect the suburbana litora and the coastal region between 
Brundisium and Tarentum respectively with 25 ships each.
 Although the pattern of 
consular naval preparations had continued at the start of the Second Punic War in 218 
when the two consuls were ordered to sail to Sicily and Spain with their own ships, it 
would have soon been apparent that they would not necessarily have been able to carry out 
all of the naval (or even terrestrial) preparations at the same time as fighting Hannibal in 
Italy.
 Unfortunately, there is no record of who prepared the ships in 215, but we may 
legitimately wonder whether Fulvius (and possibly Laevinus) played a role, especially as 
he was also given the task of defending the coast near Rome. If correct, this would predate 
the consular naval preparations carried out in 214 (II.i) and in 210; and would fatally 
undermine the notion that the praetors role in preparing a fleet in 208 set a precedent that 
automatically led to the permanent devolution of the traditional consular responsibility for 
the naval preparations.
More concrete evidence for the praetors role in preparing ships in 215 is to be 
found when the Senate decreed that 25 extra ships should be prepared for Laevinus fleet 
as part of the emergency measures passed following the capture of Carthaginian 
 Livy, 23.32.17-19. 
 Livy, 21.17.2-8. Thiel (1946), p.72f views the Roman defeat at Cannae (216) as a watershed and notes 
that the ships at Ostia were subsequently split up and dispatched to Calabria, western Italy and Sardinia.  
 It should be noted that we do not know who was responsible for preparing the additional 25 ships 
assigned to T. Otacilius Crassus (pro pr.) for use in Sicily (Livy, 22.37.13) and the fleet under M. Claudius 
Marcellus (pr.) at Ostia in 216 (Livy, 22.57.1 and 22.57.7-8).  
II.ii. The (ad hoc) praetorian naval preparations between 218 and 167      
ambassadors off the coast of Calabria and the discovery that Hannibal was allied with 
Philip V of Macedon.
 The decree was likely to have been made financially viable 
because the Senate had been able to recall the money which had been sent to repay King 
Hieron II earlier in the year.
 Whilst the official responsible for the naval preparations is 
not explicitly mentioned, both consuls were absent from Rome at the time and so the 
praetor urbanus would have been the obvious choice.
 He had admittedly been assigned 
25 ships to protect the coast near to Rome (above), but there is no evidence these were 
ever launched;
 and, even if this had been the case, it is possible that Ti. Sempronius 
Gracchus (cos.) had taken them over for use off the coast of Campania, since he was in 
charge of some ships around Cumae when the Carthaginian captives arrived.
 Fulvius 
had already been able to levy a legion for service in Sardinia and was later given the task 
of letting contracts (locare) on credit for the supply of clothes and corn for the army and 
for other neccessities for the socii nauales in Spain.
 Livy, 23.38.7-9: captiuis in uincula condi iussis comitibusque eorum sub hasta uenditis, ad naues uiginti 
quinque, quibus P. Valerius Flaccus praefectus praeerat, uiginti <quinque> [paratis] alias decernunt. his 
comparatis deductisque et additis quinque nauibus, quae aduexerant captiuos legatos, triginta naues ab 
Ostia Tarentum profectae... See further Livy, 23.34; App. Mac. 1; and Polyb. 7.9 with Walbank (1967), 
p.42-44.  
 Livy, 23.38.12: pecunia ad classem tuendam bellumque Macedonicum ea decreta est, quae Ap. Claudio 
in Siciliam missa erat ut redderetur Hieroni regi... 
 We do not know whether the preparations involved any construction work, repairs or simply acquiring the 
necessary equipment, supplies and manpower, but is possible that these 25 ships were simply equipped and 
transferred to the Calabrian coast (cf. Livy, 23.38.7).  
 Dart (2012), p.1010 unconvincingly takes it for granted that the praetor urbanus was busy defending the 
coast and speculates that an election of a special magistracy was necessary by which he alludes to duumuiri 
nauales. Whilst these officials had been elected in 311 for equipping (ornandae) and repairing (reficiendae) 
the fleet (Livy, 9.30.3-4), the evidence suggests that, from 260, senior magistrates were usually given the 
overall responsibility for the preparation of ships. However, one might wish to speculate that a board of six 
(sexuiri) were appointed at some stage during the Second Punic War when other magistrates were 
unavailable (although not necessarily in 215 for the reasons suggested above). On the duumuiri nauales and 
sexuiri see further Ch.I.iii. 
 Livy, 23.38.1-3 with Thiel (1946), p.67, n.97. Note also Brunt (1971), p.666-670 and esp. p.667f with n.1 
for the problems associated with manning ships, especially those operating around Italy.  
 Livy, 23.34.12-15 (levying the legion for Sardinia); and Livy, 23.48.4-12, esp. 23.48.10-12 (supplies for 
the forces of P. Cornelius Scipio (pro cos.) in Spain). I believe that Livys account of the provisioning of 
Scipios army is based on a real situation, even if some anachronisms have crept in (pace Erdkamp (1995), 
p.169-171). 
II.ii. The (ad hoc) praetorian naval preparations between 218 and 167      
Moreover, the praetor urbanus was sometimes instructed to hold special levies, 
such as these, for the land army, and occasionally take over the regular dilectus from the 
consuls (even when the consuls were present).
 There is no reason, then, why the same 
did not also apply to the naval preparations in both 215 and 208. The Senate could be 
flexible in issuing ad hoc instructions, depending on what it considered to be expedient, as 
dictated by the temporal factors mentioned earlier: thus new intelligence from the 
Carthaginian ambassadors, the availability of the funds sent to King Hieron II and the 
unavailability of the consuls were all factors in 215. This basic, though fundamental, 
premise can now be justifiably applied to the remaining cases of praetorian naval 
preparations from 192, 191, 190 and 172, which are cited by Brennan as illustrations of a 
permanent institutional practice. 
The Senate ordered three different praetors to prepare fleets in 192, even though 
both consuls had not yet departed for their prouinciae:
 A. Atilius Serranus (pr.), who 
had been allotted the classis et Macedonia, was instructed to build 30 quinqueremes and 
launch any usable old ships from the naualia and levy socii nauales;
 and M. Fulvius 
Centumalus (pr. urb.) and L. Scribonius Libo (pr. per.) were directed to prepare an 
additional 100 quinqueremes.
 Both sets of instructions came prior to the return of the 
Roman ambassadors who had been sent to Antiochus III to find out whether war was 
inevitable. Indeed, the orders were given very late in the day, given that the praetorian 
 See Brennan (2000), p.122f and Pina Polo (2011), p.84. It is worth noting that Fulvius was already a 
senior consularis at this time (cos. 237 and 224) and that he was elected praetor the following year with the 
urbana jurisdiction assigned to him extra sortem (Livy, 24.9.5). Could he have been meant to finish the tasks 
begun in 215? Or was he simply a reliable and efficient administrator? 
 Brennan (2000), p.658. For the numbers of ships see generally Thiel (1946), p.258-268. (Although I do 
not agree with Thiel on all points, this chapter is only concerned with ship numbers when it directly affects 
the argument above.) 
 Livy, 35.20.12: ...triginta naues quinqueremes facere iussus et ex naualibus ueteres deducere si quae 
utiles essent et scribere nauales socios... For a discussion of the prouincia see Ch.III.iii. 
 Livy, 35.21.1: praetoribus Fuluio et Scribonio, quibus ut ius dicerent Romae prouincia erat, negotium 
datum ut praeter eam classem cui Baebius praefuturus erat centum quinqueremes pararent. Cf. Thiel (1946), 
p.265, followed by Briscoe (1981), p.175, who argues that parare refers to the fitting out of old ships 
rather than new construction. 
II.ii. The (ad hoc) praetorian naval preparations between 218 and 167      
prouinciae had already been allotted at the start of the year and later changed;
 and they 
must have stemmed from an increasing anxiety that war was imminent.
Arguably, an even greater consideration as to why the praetors were charged with 
naval preparations, often overlooked by scholars, was the situation in northern Italy  to 
which both pairs of consuls were assigned in 193 and 192.
 Twyman has highlighted that 
the Senate would legitimately have feared that Antiochus would invade Italy and form an 
alliance with the Celts.
 Indeed, Hannibals invasion and use of Celtic manpower during 
the Second Punic War was a relatively recent event and would still be pertinent given that 
Hannibal had joined with Antiochus at the time.
 The priority, then, would have been to 
secure northern Italy and to utilise both consular armies against the Boii rather than delay 
the consuls with the naval preparations, which may not have been so urgent.
 It is worth 
noting also that the campaigning season could have started in northern Italy before the 
sailing season opened;
 the consuls may, therefore, have been able to take charge of their 
armies just before winter, assuming Derows calculations of the Roman calendar are 
 Livy, 35.20.8-10. 
 As Rich (1976), p.25 has argued, the Romans presumably expected the negotiations with Antiochus 
would end badly. Note also the lack of preparations at the beginning of the year (Livy. 35.20.1) and the 
Senates order to the consul, Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, not to leave Rome (35.20.14).  
 See generally Dyson (1985), p.37f. For the prouinciae see Livy, 34.55.6 (193 B.C.: Gallia and Ligures); 
and 35.20.2 (192 B.C.: Italia for both consuls).  
 Twyman (1986), p.669f and Twyman (1992), p.98 and esp. p.100ff. See also Eckstein (1987), p.321f and 
Brennan (2000), p.320, n.145. 
 This is rightly pointed out by Eckstein (2008), p.328. Cf. Livy, 21.25.1-2 for the rising of the Boii in the 
early stages of the Second Punic War.  
 It is worth noting that the Senate later ordered the praetor urbanus to construct 50 new quinqueremes 
following negative rumours from the East at around the time of the new consular elections in 192 (Livy, 
35.23.1-4; and 35.24.1-8). This presumably represented a renewal of the task that had been previously 
assigned to Atilius, which was probably abandoned after the ambassadors reported that war was not 
imminent, for which see Thiel (1946), p.265f and Rich (1976), p.88. For the campaigns in northern Italy see 
generally McDonald (1974), p.50-52 and Dyson (1985), p.36-41.   
 See Veg. Mil. 4.39 for the sailing season (10 March to 11 November, but 27 May to 14 September for 
secura sailing). See also Roth (1999), p.191 for these seasons being observed by the military with Livy, 
36.12.11 (not 36.7.11 as cited) for Antiochus taking account of the sailing season in 191. Cf. the thoughtful 
comments in Beresford (2013), p.14-16. 
II.ii. The (ad hoc) praetorian naval preparations between 218 and 167      
correct that they would have entered office on 17 November 193 (by the solar calendar).
It would have been expedient, then, to assign the naval preparations to the praetors, who 
were available on the spot: Atilius would have had to wait for the sailing season to open 
before leaving for Macedonia, whereas Fulvius and Scribonius had prouinciae 
conveniently based around Rome.
The same rationale potentially applied the next year when M. Acilius Glabrio (cos. 
191) was assigned to the newly declared war with Antiochus III in the East and P. 
Cornelius Scipio Nasica (cos. 191) was sent to the campaign against the Boii in the 
North.
 Some confirmation that the Senate wished both of the consuls to depart as soon 
as possible in this year comes from the fact that L. Quinctius Flamininus (cos. 192) was 
given the task of conducting the dilectus on his return to hold the elections for 191, ne quid 
moraretur quo minus consul nouus quo senatus censuisset extemplo proficisci posset.
There is no record that the new consuls undertook another dilectus in 191 and there was 
presumably no need: the forces raised by Flamininus were assigned to Glabrio, whereas 
Scipio was able to take over one of the two consular armies still in the North and send the 
other back to Rome.
With this in mind, the Senate may have thought, once again, that it would be 
advantageous to assign the preparation and refitting of ships to two praetors: C. Livius 
Salinator (pr.), who received a prouincia classis in the praetorian sortitio, was instructed to 
 Derow (1976), p.272. This cannot be too far off if the consuls of 190 entered office on 18 November 
(solar)  following the insertion of an intercalary month in the consular year 191  as Derow (1973), p.345f 
argues on the basis of a known solar eclipse reported by Livy. 
 Cf. Livy, 44.17.9-10 for a description of the peregrina and urbana sortes as the duae iurisdictiones, for 
which see generally Stewart (1998), p.96f, n.5 and Brennan (2000), p.107-121. 
 See MRR I, p.352 for the ancient references and for the success of the campaign against the Boii see 
McDonald (1974), p.52 and Twyman (1986), p.670.  
 Livy, 35.41.5-6. For the legions see further Briscoe (1981), p.37f. 
 Livy, 36.1.6-9; and 36.3.13. 
II.ii. The (ad hoc) praetorian naval preparations between 218 and 167      
prepare (parare) 30 ships and cross over to Greece at the first opportunity;
 and M. 
Iunius Brutus (pr. urb. et per.) was ordered to repair (reficere) and arm (armare) the old 
ships in the naualia and enlist libertini as socii nauales.
 It may also be significant that 
Livius had problems manning his ships with the men from the coloniae maritimae, which 
could well have been anticipated in advance given that Iunius was specifically told to 
enlist freedmen and, therefore, could have been another reason why it was decided not to 
entrust (and delay) the consuls with the task.
There was an additional benefit to undertaking the naval preparations separately 
from the consular dilectus, since ships could be carefully prepared during one year for use 
at the start of the next. Livius must have left Rome either with the old ships prepared by 
Fulvius (pr. urb.) and Scribonius (pr. per.) in 192 or the new ships which Fulvius was 
directed to build later that year.
 In 190, L. Aemilius Regillus (pr.), who was also allotted 
a prouincia classis, was likewise told to receive the 20 ships which had been prepared the 
previous year by Iunius and enrol 1000 socii nauales and 2000 soldiers.
 Later in the 
same year, the Senate ordered the praetor urbanus to construct (facere) 30 quinqueremes 
and 20 triremes because of a rumour, which almost certainly arrived after the consuls had 
 Livy, 36.2.14-15. For a discussion of the prouincia classis and its allotment to praetors during the war 
against Antiochus III see Ch.III.iii. It is worth adding that Livius was instructed to cross primo...tempore and 
one could argue that he may have been more efficient in preparing his own fleet: Livy records that he went 
about the preparations impigre (36.3.4).  
 Livy, 36.2.15. 
 De Ligt (2012), p.155 with n.73 and esp. p.103f recently proposed that this episode was part of a wider 
shift in demographics by hypothesising that there was a decline in the numbers of available proletarii from 
whom to man the ships between 200 and 173 because many had become assidui. He also takes this as an 
explanation for Polybius famous statement that the Romans could not man as many ships or put to sea with 
as large fleets as previously by the mid-second century (1.64.1). Cf. Walbank (1957), p.130 s.v. 64.1 and 
Brunt (1971), p.669f. 
 For the new ships see Livy, 35.24.8. Thiel (1946), p.263-268 argues that these new ships were never 
actually completed because more ships would otherwise have been utilised in Asia given that 100 ships were 
earlier prepared by Fulvius and Scribonius. However, there is no indication that the praetors managed to 
prepare the 100 ships and it is also possible that some of these were later replaced by the 50 new ships: 
curiously Thiel acknowledges that the practice of replacing old ships was utilised during the Second Punic 
War (e.g. p.48f and p.74), but does not consider that this was a possibility during the later wars. It is also 
notable that Thiel has major concerns with his own hypothesis (p.267f) on the basis of how old the fleet 
would be during the Third Punic War if no ships had been built during the war against Antiochus (or 
Perseus). It is safest to acknowledge that we cannot know exactly where Livius ships came from.  
 Livy, 37.2.10-11. Brennan (2000), p.659 does not mention this particular case in his own analysis.  
II.ii. The (ad hoc) praetorian naval preparations between 218 and 167      
already left Rome, that Antiochus was preparing a much larger fleet than he had 
previously.
 These ships were then available for Q. Fabius Labeo (pr.) to use after he had 
received the prouincia classis in 189, although the Senate ultimately decided to assign 
them to M. Fulvius Nobilior (cos.) for operations around Cephallenia.
Finally, the Senate decided it was important to begin military preparations 
immediately in response to the potential war with Perseus of Macedon in 172 rather than 
recall a consul or wait ad nouos consules.
Securing northern Italy could well have been 
an important consideration with regard to a future war with Perseus, as it had been twenty 
years earlier, and it would have made little sense to recall the consuls when the praetor 
urbanus and praetor peregrinus were available.
 Thus, C. Licinius Crassus (pr. urb.) was 
charged with repairing (reficere) and equipping (parare) 50 old quinqueremes from the 
naualia and enlisting freedmen to man 25 ships, whereas Cn. Sicinius (pr. per.) was asked 
to enrol an equal number from the allies for the other 25 ships, levy 800 soldiers and 500 
cavalry and receive the second legion and a number of allies from the consul in Liguria.
Sicinius was then ordered to hold a prouincia Macedonia with this fleet and this army until 
a successor arrived.
 The refitting of the fleet was again, in principle, no different from 
the land-based arrangements (e.g. as in 215): both should be seen as ad hoc measures taken 
in response to the evolving military situation in the East. 
 Livy, 37.4.5, which follows the report that one of the consuls had left around 15 July (37.4.1-2). As 
Brennan (2000), p.659 suggested, it is probable that both consuls had set out for their prouinciae by this time 
even though there is no record of the other consul. Compare the rumours which influenced the praetorian 
naval preparations in 215, 208 and 192.  
 See Livy, 37.50.5 with the relevant discussion in Ch.II.iii.  
 Livy, 42.27.1-8. Cf. Livy, 42.22.1 and 42.27.5 for the absence of the consuls. See generally Gruen (1984),

 See further Twyman (1993). It should be noted that the consuls had already been prevented from 
conducting a levy following a disagreement over the status of the Statellates in Liguria, for which see further

II.ii. The (ad hoc) praetorian naval preparations between 218 and 167      
In summary, we have seen how these praetorian naval preparations arguably 
resulted from a combination of special circumstances. These included reports concerning 
the military preparations of enemies (e.g. 215, 208, 192 and 190), the prioritisation of 
certain consular military tasks (e.g. 192 and 191), potential difficulties with levying naval 
forces (e.g. 191) and the absence of the consuls from Rome (215, 190 and 172). There 
were good reasons to separate the naval preparations from the annual consular military 
preparations within the contexts of each of these individual cases. It should also be 
emphasised, however, that many of these arrangements were only made possible by three 
important institutional developments starting towards the end of the First Punic War.  
I) The number of praetors elected each year increased from one to two in the 240s, 
to four in 227 and to six in 197.
 Simply put, this allowed more prouinciae (and specific 
tasks such as preparing fleets) to be assigned to magistrates: Hispania Citerior and 
Hispania Ulterior, for example, were annually allotted to praetors between 197 and 192  
alongside the urban and peregrine jurisdictions, Sicily and Sardinia  though they were 
subsequently substituted for the classis during the wars with Antiochus (192-189) and 
Perseus (171-168).
 Atilius, Livius and Aemilius, the praetors allotted the fleet between 
192 and 190, all prepared their own fleets.  
II) The Senate made much greater use of prorogatio imperii from the Second Punic 
War onwards as a means of increasing the number of available imperium-holders and 
meeting the threats posed to multiple spheres without raising the number of elected 
magistrates in a given year.
 This meant that a greater number of fleets could have been 
 See further Brennan (2000), p.85-97 and p.164-166; and Beck (2005a), p.63-67.  
 See Ch.III.iii. 
 See Jashemski (1950), esp. p. 17-39; Kloft (1977), esp. p. 27-39; Lintott (1999), p.113-115; and Brennan 
(2000), p.73-75. For the comparison with the practice during the First Punic War see Kloft (1977), p.23, who 
cites the comment in Zonar. 8.16 in which Zonaras (or Dio) holds the annual changes in the commands as 
being responsible for many of the Roman losses. See also Buti (1992), p.454-458 and Brennan (2000), p.73-
75 and p.80-83. 
utilised during one year (e.g. note that Atilius, Livius and Aemilius were assigned fleets 
after the prorogation of magistrates in the Hispaniae).
III) Extraordinary promagistrates were sometimes elected during the Second Punic 
War, which further served to increase the number of imperium-holders available (although 
there is no evidence that extraordinary promagistrates prepared their own fleets at this 
time).
Whilst these three points are widely known, they deserve special emphasis because 
the developments increased the number of imperium-holders available to command and 
prepare fleets from the Second Punic War onwards. I shall consider how, when and why 
the actual command of the fleet and, in particular, the prouincia classis was assigned to 
magistrates and promagistrates in the next chapter, but the basic point needs to be stressed 
here that during the period of the most frequent praetorian naval preparations after 208  
viz. between 192-189 and 172  there were simply more praetors available than ever 
before. It is not surprising, then, that the Senate made use of them during the major wars of 
the late third and early second centuries, which involved fighting in multiple geographical 
regions simultaneously. This did not, however, equate to a permanent devolution of 
consular responsibility from 208 onwards, as suggested by Brennan. In fact, there are 
several cases which show that the Senate continued to assign some naval preparations to 
the consuls when it was appropriate after the praetorian naval preparations of 208. These 
will be considered next. 
 It is also worth noting that any naval reinforcements required by a prorogued magistrate would have to be 
prepared by another magistrate in Rome/Italy (unless obtained in the prouincia). For example, the fleet 
prepared by the consuls in 214 may have been intended for M. Valerius Laevinus (pr. per. 215), who was 
prorogued with the fleet at Brundisium (Livy, 23.48.6), for which see further Thiel (1946), p.75, n.124. 
 See further the literature cited in the above discussion of prorogatio imperii and also especially Badian 
(1979), p.793 and Ridley (1981), p.287-290.  
II.iii. The consular naval preparations between 208 and 167      
II.iii. The consular naval preparations between 208 and 167  
There is evidence in four cases (205, 202, 189 and 168) for a continued connection 
between the annual consular war preparations and the specific naval preparations ex 
senatus consulto, as I outlined in the introduction to this chapter, after 208.  
In the first case, Livy reports that P. Cornelius Scipio (cos.) was not granted 
permission to conduct a dilectus, but was allowed to enlist volunteers and receive materials 
for constructing new ships from the socii for use in Sicily and Africa in 205.
 According 
to Livy, Scipio made a pronouncement that the fleet would not be a cause for expense to 
the res publica and managed to build 20 quinqueremes and 10 quadriremes within forty-
five days by relying on the allies of central Italy, who apparently volunteered materials, 
equipment, provisions, arms and men.
 Although some scholars have dismissed the entire 
passage as an invention of a later annalist, there were real financial and manpower 
shortages throughout this period which would, potentially, have necessitated the use of 
allied resources and manpower.
 One can speculate (with Thiel) that the allied 
contributions were actually forced on the Etruscans and other allies ex senatus consulto as 
a result of their disloyalty;
 and I would even propose that the unusually vast detail in 
Livys passage originally derived from such a senatus consultum (or a copy/summary of 
 Livy, 28.45.13-14. For a full discussion of the prouincia see Ch.III.iii.  
 Livy, 28.45.14-21.  
 For a rejection of the passage see Brunt (1971), p.655f with some earlier bibliography. Most recently, W. 
Blsel argued the passage is fabricated in a paper The Etruscan and Italic Clientelae of Scipio Africanus 
maior (Livy 28.45)  a fiction delivered at the international conference Clientelas Provinciales en el 
Imperio Romano: una reconsideracin (Zaragoza, 14-15 March 2013), the proceedings of which will be 
published by F. Pina Polo (ed.) in 2014. The passage is accepted without question by Toynbee (1965), I, 
p.265. Cf. Thiel (1946), p.145-148 and Develin (1985), p.234f. For the severe manpower shortages see 
Gruen (1990), p.23, n.92 with references, who also accepts the authenticity of the passage. It is worth noting, 
in particular, that the Senate gave the consuls authority to supplement their forces unde uellent following a 
manpower shortage and difficulty with the levy in 207, which resulted in various auxiliary forces being 
transferred from Spain and Sicily (Livy, 27.38.9-12).  
 Thiel (1946), p.146f, following a suggestion by W. Weissenborn with regard to Livy, 28.45.14. 
II.iii. The consular naval preparations between 208 and 167      
 Regardless of whether some elements of the passage were falsified, such as the 
Etruscans volunteering to help Scipio, there is little reason to doubt that Scipio utilised the 
allies for his naval preparations; and so the passage should not be rejected in toto.
Indeed, Appian potentially preserves a different tradition in his report that Scipio was able 
to take volunteers and prepare 10 ships.
The second case is to be found after Ti. Claudius Nero (cos.) was assigned 50 
quinqueremes for use in his prouincia Africa in 202.
 Livy reports that Claudius was 
deliberately slow in preparing (comparanda) and launching (deducenda) his fleet because 
the Senate had already decided that Scipio (pro consule in Africa since 204) was to be 
responsible for deciding peace terms with the Carthaginians.
 It is notable that Livy 
employs very similar language when he describes the difficulties faced by C. Livius 
Salinator (pr.) in equipping his fleet with men from the coloniae maritimae in 191, as we 
observed in the previous section.
 The Senate may have even learnt from this episode and 
directed Cn. Cornelius Lentulus (cos.) to acquire 50 ships from the existing fleets in Sicily 
and Africa in 201 in order to avoid any deliberate delaying tactics like those of 202, since 
 For what it is worth, the preceding formulation granting Scipio permission to cross to Africa si id e re 
publica esse censeret (28.45.9) occurs on various occasions, for which see further Ch.III.iii. 
 Cf. Prag (2011b), p.18 with n.15 for senatus consulta authorising a commander to levy troops from 
overseas allies and note especially e.g. Livy, 42.35.4-6 (171 B.C.).  
 App. Pun. 7. Cf. Plut. Fab. Max. 25.5 and Zonar. 9.11.6-7. For the discrepancy between the numbers of 
ships reported by Appian and Livy cf. Kahrstedt (1913), p.327 and Thiel (1946), p.147, n.38. 
 Livy, 30.27.1-5. It is worth noting an additional case in which the Senate ordered the consuls to levy three 
thousand soldiers, which would be used to man the 40 ships that M. Marcius Ralla (probably pro praetore) 
had to defend the ora Italiae in 203 (Livy, 30.2.5-6). For Rallas position see MRR I, p.315, n.5 and Brennan 
(2000), p.288, n.49 and p.306, n.2. 
 Livy, 30.38.7-8: segniter omnia in comparanda deducendaque classe ab Ti. Claudio consule facta erant 
quod patres de pace Scipionis potius arbitrium esse quibus legibus daretur quam consulis censuerant. Cf. 
Zonar. 9.14.1. The preparations presumably involved at least gathering and equipping the ships with men and 
supplies. 
 Livy, 36.3.4: in comparanda impigre classe C. Liuium praetorem contentio orta cum colonis maritimis 
paulisper tenuit. 
II.iii. The consular naval preparations between 208 and 167      
he had only been given permission to cross into Africa if peace could not be arranged by 
Scipio.
Thirdly, the Senate ordered M. Fulvius Nobilior (cos.) to equip (ornare) and launch 
(ducere) the ships which had been built by the praetor urbanus the previous year and then 
to sail to Cephallenia in 189.
 Some scholars have argued that Livys report cannot be 
correct, since the 50 new ships were originally intended for the war against Antiochus III 
in Asia and there were already 20 ships present around Cephallenia, which were 
apparently more than enough for Fulvius limited task.
 However, we are never told how 
many ships were completed in 190 and there could have been a much smaller number 
available to Fulvius; Livy, after all, does not reveal how many ships Fulvius launched and 
so he may not have had to prepare as many as 50. Furthermore, it remains perfectly 
plausible that Fulvius equipped all of the ships, regardless of their number, instead of 
relying solely on the ships around Cephallenia. News of the Roman victory against 
Antiochus III at Myonnesus had already reached Rome prior to the end of the consular 
year 190  i.e. before the assignment of prouinciae and armies for 189.
 The Senate 
could, therefore, have judged that the ships were no longer required in Asia and Fulvius 
could have been sent with a strong fleet as a show of strength with the subsequent 
negotiations in Aetolia and Cephallenia in mind.
 Livy, 30.41.6-7. For the prouincia see Ch.III.ii and Ch.III.iv.  
 Livy, 37.50.5-8. The role of the praetor urbanus in the construction of these ships is mentioned in 
Ch.II.ii. 
 De Sanctis (1923), IV.i, p.211f, n.154; Thiel (1946), p.263; and Briscoe (1981), p.369, s.v. 5. 
 See Livy, 37.47.3-5 with Briscoe (1981), p.364f s.v. 3. Eodem tempore.  
 For the negotiations see e.g. Livy, 38.8-11, esp. 38.8.2-3 with reference to the siege of Ambracia and the 
presence of a hostile fleet. I do not agree with Briscoe (2008), p.45 s.v. navibus hostium that there was no 
Roman fleet in the area at this time. A Roman fleet could have easily been commanded by a legatus, even if 
it is not explicitly mentioned, with Fulvius besieging Ambracia by both land and sea. The importance of the 
mission is played down by Thiel (1946), p.263, but it should also be noted that Fulvius celebrated a triumph 
just two years later: [M. Fu]lvius M. f. Ser. n. Nobil[ior II, pro an. DLXVI |  [co(n)s(ule), de] Aetoleis et 
Ceph[allenia X k. Ian.] (Inscr. Ital. XIII, I, p.80f). Cf. Livy, 39.4-5 and Cic. Mur. 31. This suggests that the 
war was taken seriously.  
II.iii. The consular naval preparations between 208 and 167      
In the fourth case, it is possible to demonstrate that C. Licinius Crassus (cos.) was 
charged with preparing ships alongside his responsibility for the consular dilectus in 
 Livy records that it was left to him to prepare and send anything necessary for the 
war with Perseus of Macedon and implies that this was arranged so that L. Aemilius 
Paullus (cos.) and Cn. Octavius (pr.) could both proceed against Perseus as soon as the 
Senate decreed.
 Livy states that 5000 socii nauales were enlisted for the fleet within the 
context of the military arrangements for which Licinius was responsible ex senatus 
consulto.
 Crucially, he also records that a series of senatorial decrees were made in 
September, after news had been received of Aemilius victory against Perseus at Pydna, 
which included the following:
naues, quae in Tiberi paratae instructaeque stabant, ut, si res posceret, in 
Macedoniam mitterentur, subduci et in naualibus conlocari, socios naualis dato 
annuo stipendio dimitti et cum iis omnes, qui in consulis uerba iurauerant...
We can assume that Licinius played a role in preparing and equipping the ships 
waiting in the Tiber, given that he was instructed to prepare and send anything necessary 
for the war in Macedonia. It is also notable that the socii nauales are described alongside 
all those who had taken an oath before the consul (i.e. Licinius). In contrast to the 
preparations carried out by the praetor urbanus and praetor peregrinus mid-year in 172 
(II.ii), Licinius was available in Rome to carry out the preparations himself and

censuisset, exituros esse. C. Licinio collegae suo fore curae se absente, ut, si qua parari mittique ad id 
bellum opus sit, parentur mittanturque. Cf. Livy, 44.22.5. Pina Polo (2011), p.33 also discusses the early 
celebration of the feriae Latinae on 31 March and determines that Aemilius was in Rome for two weeks after 
taking office: an extraordinary short period of time  probably the shortest on record, along with that of the 
year 169. 
 Livy, 44.21.10-11. 
 For the date see Livy, 45.2.3.  
 Livy, 45.2.9-11. Thiel (1946), p.377f, n.704 suggests these details are not very credible, but he does not 
explain why and I do not see a good reason to dismiss them. 
II.iii. The consular naval preparations between 208 and 167      
presumably only then departed for northern Italy.
 It should be noted that Cn. Servilius 
Caepio (cos. 169) was almost certainly prorogued in Gaul so that Licinius would have 
ample time to carry out the military preparations before leaving Rome.
There are no further records of consuls undertaking naval preparations in the 
surviving books of Livys History, although it should be emphasised that Livy does not 
give a complete account of all of the instances of naval preparations between 218 and 167; 
and there are certain cases in which one might strongly suspect consular involvement, 
despite the absence of evidence.
 Indeed, all of the cases in this section correspond to the 
framework proposed in the introduction of this chapter in which the consular naval 
preparations were inherently linked to the annual military preparations (e.g. the regular 
dilectus and probably also the calculation of the tributum). As suggested in Chapter I, this 
almost certainly goes back to the construction of the first major fleet in 260.  
Yet, we have observed some significant developments between the First Punic War 
and the war with Perseus of Macedon: i) consuls did not only prepare their own fleets, but 
sometimes carried out this task for other magistrates (e.g. 214 and 168); ii) praetors could 
be charged with preparing their own fleets (e.g. 208, 192, 191 and 190); and iii) praetors 
were, at times, directed to prepare fleets for others (e.g. 215, 192, 191 and 172). We have 
seen how these three points were presupposed by various institutional developments, 
which increased the number of magistrates and promagistrates available each year. The 
 It is unfortunate that we do not have any information concerning when Licinius left for northern Italy 
against the Gauls (Livy, 45.12.9-13), although a later departure is potentially suggested by the fact that he 
apparently arrived around Camp Macri and next (deinde) passed the winter around the same place without 
his legions, who had not arrived owing to a religious technicality regarding their date of departure, for which 
see MRR I, p.429 s.v. Cn. Servilius Caepio. 
 See Livy, 44.21.7 for Servilius continued command in Gaul and 43.11.12 for his original prouincia 
Italia, which was the name of the prouincia allotted to Licinius (44.17.10). 
 I include here several of the most probable cases in which consuls might have been responsible for naval 
preparations, based on the attested use of ships during those years. I) P. Sulpicius Galba Maximus (cos.) in 
200: see Livy, 31.9.5; 31.18.9 for his arrival in Illyria with land and naval forces; and 31.22.4 for his arrival 
in late autumn, which one could speculate was partially owing to naval preparations. II) M. Porcius Cato 
(cos.) in 195: Livy, 33.43.3; and 34.8.4-5. III) Ti. Sempronius Gracchus (cos.) in 177: Livy, 41.9.2.  
last two developments have also been explained in terms of what the Senate might have 
considered to be expedient at a particular time  i.e. as ad hoc rather than de iure 
developments. Indeed, the Senate tightly regulated what military arrangements should be 
made for each military sphere. It adapted to fluid and diverse military situations by making 
what it would have considered the best use of the senior magistrates available in Italy, but 
it did not permanently make constructing, equipping and manning fleets a praetorian task 
by setting a new precedent in either 215 or 208.  
II.iv. Epilogue: the Late Republic      
II.iv. Epilogue: the Late Republic 
The evidence for the preparations of fleets becomes even more limited following the loss 
of Livys History from 167. We can only assume, for example, that the consuls were 
involved in preparing the fleet of 50 quinqueremes with which they sailed against Carthage 
in 149, especially if we keep in mind the consular preparations made for similar 
expeditions in 218, 205 and 202.
 Another important factor, which must to a large extent 
account for the scarcity of evidence for preparing fleets, is that Rome had much less need 
to prepare large scale naval forces after the destruction of Carthage in 146, since there 
were no strong naval powers left to challenge her hegemony in the Mediterranean.
Indeed, some scholars have characterised the period between 146 and the 
Mediterranean-wide naval command of Cn. Pompeius Magnus against the pirates in 67 as 
largely being fleetless.
 Such a characterisation, however, rests too heavily on the 
absence of evidence and risks minimising the role of smaller Italian and allied fleets:
do not know, for example, the size of the fleet which Q. Caecilius Metellus (Baliaricus) 
brought with him, as consul, against the Balearic Islands in 123 or how many ships M. 
Antonius took eastwards via Corinth (either as a praetor or a promagistrate) against the 
pirates in Cilicia towards the end of the second century;
 nor do we know who carried 
out these naval preparations. In addition, the fact that L. Cornelius Sulla (cos.) left Italy 
without a fleet of warships at the start of the Mithridatic War in 88 was most probably

 Cf. Ch.IV.i.

p.133f. Cf. Mommsen (1887), II, p.581; Starr (1941), p.1; Brunt (1971), p.670; Sherwin-White (1976), p.5;

(2009), p.140; and Dart (2012), p.1014. 
 Redd (1986), p.459-470 offers a more nuanced appraisal by considering the smaller fleets. See also de 
Souza (1999), p.116-148 and esp. p.121, n.116 for his critique of Redd.  
 Flor. 1.43.4-6 recording ships with rostra (Metellus); and ILLRP 342 (Antonius). Furthermore, it is 
unknown whether e.g. L. Caecilius Metellus (cos.) took warships with him against the Segestani and the 
Dalmatians in 119 (App. Ill. 10-11; Livy, Per. 62; and Eutr. 4.23.2). 
II.iv. Epilogue: the Late Republic  
caused by a lack of funds in the treasury for naval preparations, such as repairs and 
equipping, and a shortage of manpower  both as a result of the Italian War  rather than 
an absence of warships in Italy.
 It should be noted that L. Valerius Flaccus (cos. suff.) 
sent some ships in advance of his own departure eastwards from Brundisium in 86;
Sullas enemies, L. Cornelius Cinna (cos.) and Cn. Papirius Carbo (cos.) were apparently 
able to repair ships in anticipation of his return in 85.
Naval preparations undoubtedly still occurred, therefore, during the so-called 
fleetless period between 146 and 67, although on a much lesser scale than previously. 
We can assume that the Senate continued to assign the task of preparing fleets as they had 
earlier in the third and second centuries and that the consuls would have taken 
responsibility for their own naval preparations. Evidence for this is suggested by the fact 
that L. Licinius Lucullus (cos.) declined the Senates offer to provide him with funds for a 
fleet against Mithridates in 74. (He boasted that he would throw Mithridates from the sea 
only with the ships of allies.)
Yet, there is evidence for a significant change just seven years later when A. 
Gabinius (tr. pl.) proposed a law which would give an ex-consul  i.e. Cn. Pompeius 
Magnus  an extraordinary promagistracy to fight pirates throughout the Mediterranean 
with 200 ships and authority over the number and enlisting of both soldiers and rowers in 
 Contra Sherwin-White (1976), p.5 and Sherwin-White (1984), p.99f. For the financial problems see App. 
Mith. 22. Sulla had to send his quaestor (L. Licinius Lucullus) to gather ships from friendly kings and cities 
(App. Mith. 33; 56; and Plut. Luc. 2-3) and then began building his own ships (App. Mith. 51). Cf. App. 
Mith. 50 and 54. For the importance of the Italian War context on the arrangements for the East see e.g. 
Sherwin-White (1984), p.118-120 and Ferrary (2003), p.407.

p.57.

as an example of Lucullus arrogance. For the fleets of the Mithridatic War see generally Kromayer (1897), 
p.470-481, esp. p.478-481. 
II.iv. Epilogue: the Late Republic  
 We cannot determine the exact number of ships Pompeius had under his command 
or if the naval preparations involved any construction and repairs or predominantly 
encompassed equipping and manning ships.
 Nonetheless, we are at least able to 
highlight two highly significant features of the Lex Gabinia. First, the supreme role of the 
Senate in deciding what naval preparations ought to be undertaken and the individual 
responsible for their undertaking, as seen throughout this chapter, was subverted by this 
popular tribunician bill. Second, the overall responsibility for the naval preparations was 
apparently given to a promagistrate rather than one of the annually elected magistrates of 
the res publica, which, as far as we can tell, had not previously been the case earlier in the 
Republic.
This arrangement appears to represent an important institutional and political 
development, since it broke with the established mos maiorum, as we have seen throughout 
this chapter. Unfortunately, there is simply not enough comparable evidence for us to trace 
any changes over a longer period between 146 and 49 and so the full implications of the 
arrangement of 67 cannot be determined through the theme of naval preparations.
Nonetheless, it can almost certainly be interpreted within the context of the better known 
political developments of the first century. With this in mind, it is possible to consider the 
scope of the Lex Gabinia and the repercussions of the command assigned to Pompeius 
from a complementary angle, which involves examining the assignment and command of 
 Plut. Pomp. 25.3: ...            
  ,         . Cf. 
App. Mith. 94 (270 ships and 6,000 Attic talents); Dio Cass. 36.37.1 (all the ships and finance he wished); 
and Plut. Pomp. 26 (500 ships). The difference in the numbers are probably best interpreted as arising from 
the provisions being increased from the original law proposed by Gabinius, perhaps by a second comitial law 
or a modification of the original clauses, for which see Ch.IV.iv.  
 See Kromayer (1897), p.429-432, who estimates the naval strength at around 300 ships with rostra 
(including the ships of allies) and argues that shipbuilding was unlikely given the limited strength of the 
enemy and the number of available ships in Italy in 49. Cf. Brunt (1971), p.456f. 
 In contrast, a fleet was seemingly prepared on behalf of P. Cornelius Scipio, who was elected to an 
extraordinary promagistracy in 210 (Livy, 26.19.10 with 26.35-36). Cf. Thiel (1946), p.111f.  
 Cf. Brunt (1974), p.164f for the role of the people in authorising military levies in the Late Republic. 
II.iv. Epilogue: the Late Republic  
the fleet in terms of the prouincia. It will be necessary to start from the third century in 
order to elucidate how, when and why the command of the fleet was assigned to 
magistrates and promagistrates and to trace various political and institutional 
developments between the third and the first centuries  i.e. a period in which the empire 
expanded to include the entire Mediterranean and in which the political and institutional 
system had to adapt accordingly. This will also potentially provide a context for 
understanding the assignment of the naval preparations to Pompeius in 67, which we shall 
return to in the conclusions to Chapter IV.  
Whilst this chapter has considered how and when naval administrative tasks were 
distributed to senior magistrates in Rome and Italy, the next chapter will investigate the 
related questions concerning how and when naval military tasks were assigned to 
magistrates and promagistrates. Its main focus will be on the fundamental role played by 
the concept of the prouincia.  
III.i. Introduction: the concept of the prouincia  
Chapter III: The prouincia and the prouincia classis 
III.i. Introduction: the concept of the prouincia  
Scholars have been unanimous in recognising that the concept of the prouincia was 
fundamental to the development of the Roman Empire.
 The communis opinio is that the 
term originally represented a functional sphere of operation or a task that was allotted or 
assigned to a magistrate and which only later developed a geographical meaning with 
territorial connotations.
 The basic premise underpinning this view may be summarised 
as follows: first, Roman magistrates were sent with military functions to certain spheres 
of operation outside of Italy which were designated as prouinciae; secondly, these 
spheres (or prouinciae) came to be viewed as permanent and distinct territories of the 
Roman Empire over time as magistrates were sent to them on a consistent annual basis 
with increasingly routine administrative and legal responsibilites.
 This process would 
have been encouraged, on this basis, by the election of two additional praetors in 228 (for 
227) for Sicily and Sardinia-Corsica and two more in 198 (for 197) for the Hispaniae 
(Citerior and Ulterior);
 and scholars usually claim that a geographical sense of the 
prouincia subsequently developed sometime between the second and first centuries.

provincia Etruria, ib., X, 11 etc.). De l, ce mot a reu la signification plus gnrale dune attribution

III.i. Introduction: the concept of the prouincia  
As far as I am aware, only Bertrand has seriously questioned the above position by 
arguing, in an often overlooked paper, that the term prouincia originally designated a 
geographical space (un espace) rather than the function or task given to a magistrate well 
before the second century:
 he suggested that what began as a loose projected space 
(province-espace-projet), potentially for conquest or plundering, developed into a 
territorial administrative space (province-espace-construit) with political and 
geographical frontiers through a process of territorialisation.
 He then proposed a 
secondary development through which the word prouincia came to designate tasks 
following the increase in the number of praetors annually elected in the second half of the 
third century: according to his hypothesis, some of these praetors were allotted 
jurisdictions (or tasks) within the urbs as prouinciae through what he terms un transfert 
mtaphorique; and this caused a break  (une rupture) in the meaning of the prouincia so 
that it could subsequently be used for any task or responsibility rather than only 
geographical spaces extra urbem.
Bertrands arguments suggest that the early development of the prouincia is not as 
clear-cut as has been presented in much of the modern scholarship. The identification of a 
specific date or even a period when the concept of the prouincia took on a geographical 
meaning is still  over twenty years since the publication of his article  a matter for debate 
(Sicily and Sardinia-Corsica). Some scholars have inaccurately categorised these in constitutional terms as 
permanent (fixed) prouinciae in contrast to non-permanent (non-fixed or special), predominantly 
military, prouinciae, for which see Ch.IV.iii.  
 Cf. e.g. Dahlheim (1977), p.74, n.1 (citing Livy, 41.28.8 as the first evidence from 174 B.C.); Richardson 
(1986), p.6f (suggesting its development through the last two centuries BC); Lintott (1993), p.23 (citing 
the Greek epigraphic evidence from mid-second century and claiming that the spatial concept of a 
provincia was firmly established by the late second century); and Richardson (2008), p.8 (illustrating that 
prouincia and imperium had geographical significances by the first century AD). 
 The theory has generally not been well received and has elicited few responses in the modern scholarship: 
e.g. Lintott (1993), p.198, n.4; Millar (1993), p.31, n.16; RS, no.12, p.261, s.v. ll. 22-7; Hurlet (1997), 
p.258, n.82; Lintott (1999), p.101; Santangelo (2007), p.26, n.28; and Richardson (2008), p.8, n.17.  
 Bertrand (1989), esp. p.200-208. See e.g. p.204f with Livy, 28.40-45 for his interpretation of Sicily as a 
defined territorial space when it was named as P. Cornelius Scipios prouincia in 205 and Africa (which 
Scipio had pleaded for) as an undefined projected space (for conquest). 
 Bertrand (1989), p.208-214. 
III.i. Introduction: the concept of the prouincia  
today. Indeed, many scholars may have gone too far in claiming that the earliest use of the 
term must have been purely functional rather than geographical, even though the basic 
orthodox view that a prouincia first represented a military sphere of operation may be 
closer to Bertrands province-espace-projet than is often appreciated.
 Bertrand, on the 
other hand, may have gone too far in the opposite direction by rejecting the view that a 
prouincia could represent a task before the later third century. There are early cases, for 
instance, in which the name of a geographical region is linked with a specific task and, as 
we shall see, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether the primary sense of the 
prouincia was the space or the task.  
As an example of this problem, we can consider Livys record that the consuls P. 
Decius Mus and Q. Fabius Rullianus received Etruria and Samnium as their respective 
prouinciae in 308.
 Prima facie, these appear to be geographical names. However, Livy 
also describes how Fabius was instructed (presumably ex senatus consulto) to lead his 
army into Umbria  a task which is described as being an exiguam appendicem Etrusci 
belli  if there was any respite from the bellum Samnitium;
 and, then, following a 
successful campaign, Livy reports that, ...alienae sortis uictor belli, in suam prouinciam 
exercitum reduxit.
 This suggests that the war against the Umbrians  the aliena sors and 
part of the bellum Etruscum  was connected with the prouincia (or sors) Etruria which 
had been allotted to Decius.
 Likewise, it appears that the bellum Samnitium was linked 
 Some of the strongest rejections of a primary geographical definition are to be found in e.g. Badian 
(1965), p.112, n.19; Lintott (1981b), p.54; Richardson (1986), p.4f; Santangelo (2007), p.26, n.28; and 
Drogula (2011), p.97. 
 Livy, 9.41.2-3: consules partiti prouincias; Etruria Decio, Samnium Fabio euenit. For the difficulties 
posed by the records of consular prouinciae and actions of consuls during this time see Oakley (1997), p.67-
72. On Livys reliability see further Ch.I.iii and Ch.III.ii. 
 Livy, 9.41.8-20. 
 Livy, 9.42.1-2. Cf. Diod. Sic. 20.44.8-9.  
 Cf. Oakley (2005a), p.546 s.v. 42.1. alienae sortis, who rightly notes that Livy uses aliena prouincia 
much more frequently. 
III.i. Introduction: the concept of the prouincia  
with Fabius own prouincia Samnium.
 We cannot tell whether these wars were an 
inherent part of the prouinciae or additionally designated (and not recorded by Livy or his 
sources).   
Whether Etruria and Samnium were either geographical or functional prouinciae 
may, therefore, be the wrong question to ask.
 Although the names were undeniably 
connected with the military tasks associated with the Etruscan and Samnite wars, one 
should not automatically take them as representing only these tasks.
 If this were true, 
one might ask why it was ever necessary for a prouincia to be defined in terms of both a 
geographical sphere (e.g. Sicily or Italy) and a task (e.g. the fleet or the war with Hannibal) 
simultaneously if the latter was always inherent in the former.
 It is more likely that 
ethnic identity, alongside the related political divisions, played an important part in 
influencing a Roman conception of Samnium and Etruria as actual territorial 
spaces:
 Livy, after all, refers to the bellum Etruscum and bellum Samnitium and 
associates these with what were apparently identifiable territories.
 He describes, for 
 We can also note that Livy describes the consular prouinciae at the start of the conflict with the Etruscans 
as follows: consules inter se prouincias partiti: Iunio Samnites, Aemilio nouum bellum Etruria sorte 
obuenit... (9.31.1-2). 
 The use of the term sphere of activity arguably avoids this question, since it is conveniently vague 
enough to refer to space and function. See, example, Crawford (1990), p.92 referring to Etruria and Samnium 
as, sfere di attivit. Yet, as I have noted above, some scholars have arguably taken the idea too far and 
denied that a geographical sense existed at all. Richardson (2008), p.49 tries to explain away the 
geographical connotation, but, in doing so, he leaves room for confusion and ambiguity: cf. p.16f (quoted in 
the following note) and p.8, n.17: ...a provincia was the task given to the holder of imperium by the senate, 
and, in so far as it had a geographical connotation, that was essentially the description of the nature of that 
task.  
 Contra Richardson (2008), p.16f: Even the naming of one praetorian provincia as the Bruttii is not 
properly geographical, though this is undoubtedly influenced by the nature of the territory which the Bruttii 
occupied in the remote and mountainous region of the toe of Italy. In such instances it seems that the 
provincia was a task rather than an area, which further suggests that this was also the case where a provincia 
had a geographical name attached to it.  
 See e.g. Livy, 26.28.3-4 and 26.29.1-2 with further discussion in Ch.IV.iv.  
 See Purcell (1990), p.8: Ethnic terms for races or peoples, political terms for kingdoms or states, are 
common objects: geographical ones are not. The regional names of the Roman provinces as they develop 
are much more closely related to the ethnic or the political than to pure geography... This should now be 
compared with the discussion of Sicilian identity and geography by Prag (2012b). Cf. Hermon (1996), p.24f 
and Richardson (2008), p.16f, as quoted in the previous note. See also now Cadiou and Moret (2012), p.27f 
(for the link between territories and peoples with regard to the Hispaniae in 197).  
 This may also be compared with the description of the triumphs de Etrusceis and de Samnitibus in the 
Augustan Fasti Triumphales (Inscr. Ital. XIII, I, p.70f).  
III.i. Introduction: the concept of the prouincia  
example, how Decius proceeded ex Etruria...in agro Pupiniensi (in Latium) to await 
reports of the Umbrian enemy and how Fabius later encouraged his soldiers in their fight 
against the Umbrians by praising their earlier accomplishments not only in Tuscis (against 
the Etruscans), but also in Samnio (in Samnium).
 Although one might question whether 
Livy preserves the original fourth-century terminology, a third-century inscription from the 
sarcophagus of L. Cornelius Scipio Barbatus (cos. 298) confirms that Samnium had 
territorial connotations by revealing that Scipio either captured Samnium or took the cities 
of Taurasia and Cisauna from Samnium (as the regional power).
 There is no good 
reason to deny that such a geographical (territorial) definition could have been used by the 
Romans whenever a prouincia Samnium was named in Italy long before Rome had 
acquired overseas territories.  
Even overseas prouinciae did not necessarily develop from simple military tasks 
into distinct geographical territories as part of a linear progression, as implied by much of 
the modern scholarship. Prag recently emphasised that Sicily  commonly referred to as 
Romes first overseas prouincia  had considerable potential for the unusually strong 
consciousness of a particular, bounded, geographical space and suggested that this had an 
early influence on a united Sicilian (or Sikeliote) identity prior to Roman occupation.
It is quite possible that the Romans were conscious of this when they named a prouincia 
Sicilia for the first time; and one can even speculate that it was named during the First 
 Livy, 9.41.10; and 9.41.16. Cf. Livy, 10.32.2 and Livy, 10.37.1-2 (294 B.C.)

Roman rule, as rightly emphasised by Ferrary (2008a), p.15f. Cf. Bertrand (1989), p.206; and Prag (2012a),

III.i. Introduction: the concept of the prouincia  
Punic War precisely to represent the space of the operations.
 This does not exclude the 
possibility that a specific task could have been named in addition to this (e.g. the war 
against the Carthaginians).
 If correct, a geographical meaning for a prouincia Sicilia 
would have predated its provincialisation (which would have only started after the 
Roman victory over the Carthaginians in 241).
It is reasonable to suggest that the deliberate playing down (or, in some cases, the 
outright denial) of an early geographical definition of the prouincia, in the modern 
scholarship, stems precisely from the tendency to approach the concept of the prouincia 
from the perspective of the highly complex, sometimes inconsistent, factors associated 
with the processes of provincialisation and territorialisation.
 It is with these factors 
in mind that the concept of the prouincia is, conveniently, said to have been transformed 
from a functional military task into something more like a modern territorial province, as 
mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
 There is no denying the crucial significance 
of the administrative and institutional development of prouinciae for the emergence and 
conceptualisation of territorial empire, which has rightly been the subject of some major 
 Cf. Prag (2012a), p.64f. As we have seen in Ch.I.iv, the evidence for the names of the prouinciae is very 
scarce during the First Punic War. E.g. cf. Zonar. 8.9 (the consuls were ordered into Sicily: ) and 
Polyb. 1.16.1-2 (the consuls were dispatched into Sicily: ) for 263; and Polyb. 1.39.8 (the 
consuls were sent off into Sicily: ) in 251. 
 See further Ch.I.iv and Ch.IV.iii.   
 Some scholars would even argue the provincialisation only began after a praetor was annually sent 
(probably) from 227. See further Prag (2012a) with the modern literature and also the pertinent remarks by 
Briscoe (2012b), p.997: ...in 241 Rome had no possessions outside Italy and prouincia had only its original 
meaning of sphere of operation: if a magistrate was sent to Sicily, it became his prouincia; the notion of the 
senate declaring Sicily a province and then deciding how to administer it makes no sense. Cf. Brennan 
(2000), p.88; and Ferrary (2008a), p.8.  
 Cf. e.g. Nicolet (1978), p.910: Lvolution mme du mot provincia marque bien la ralit, et les 
difficults, dun pouvoir de cet ordre quand il sagit dun empire acquis par une cit... 
 See e.g. Richardson (1986), p.9: From the beginning of the emergence of the idea of Roman power, of 
the Roman empire, on a world-wide scale, the provincia described and defined the particular task given to a 
holder of imperium. The process by which the provincia became a province, with all that that word implies 
of legal, fiscal and administrative responsibilities, was not only the redefinition of the task of the holder of 
imperium, but also the formulation of what the empire was perceived to be. Cf. Richardson (1986), p.6f; 
p.180; and Richardson (2008), p.9. As mentioned earlier, Bertrand (1989) also recognised the process of 
territorialisation as leading to a province-espace-construit, although he conversely saw a shift in the 
meaning of prouincia as resulting from the institutional developments in Italy.  
III.i. Introduction: the concept of the prouincia  
modern studies.
 Yet, the approach associated with this line of inquiry has had the 
negative effect of distorting the possibility that a prouincia could have had geographical 
and territorial connotations before the development of permanent territorial empire. This, 
in turn, has led to the false dichotomy of geographical space and functional task that I have 
outlined above and has meant that some of the complexities concerning how and why 
prouinciae were used during the last three centuries of Republic have been either glossed 
over or even ignored. Moreover, it should be noted that the Romans themselves did not 
differentiate between prouinciae as functional military spheres of operation and as 
territorial entities outside of Rome.
My approach in this chapter, therefore, will be to move the emphasis away from 
the discourse described above in order to focus more precisely on the practical use of the 
prouincia instead of the provincialisation of the prouinciae; and I shall consider what 
this can tell us about some of the important political and institutional developments 
between the third and first centuries  i.e. rather than vice versa. I shall do this by 
examining the use of the fleet as a prouincia in the third and second centuries. This has 
never received detailed treatment in existing scholarship and has been mostly cited as a 
basic illustration of how a prouincia could be a simple command or military function.
Whilst this might at first appear to narrow the scope of the investigation, arguably it has 
the advantage of not being directly connected with the provincialisation of territory and 
so we will not face the problems associated with trying to fit the development of the 
prouincia within this complex process. Furthermore, this approach has the potential to

III.i. Introduction: the concept of the prouincia  
offer some fresh perspectives on the important role of the prouincia as a flexible means of 
enabling and limiting the activities of magistrates and promagistrates, rather than as either 
solely a task or a geographical space.
The chapter is divided into seven parts after this introduction. The first and second 
parts (III.ii and III.iii) will examine how the fleet was defined as a prouincia and, in doing 
so, will illuminate the role played by senatorial instructions in defining this prouincia in 
terms of geographical spaces. The third, fourth and fifth parts (III.iv-vi) will investigate 
why the prouincia classis was defined in the ways outlined in the first two sections. It will 
be argued that a key explanation lies in the advantages associated with separating 
imperium-holders in space, which was realised through the enabling and limiting of 
particular functions (III.iv). One central concern in this part (iv) will be to focus on how 
these (enabling and limiting) features of the prouincia developed, since they are unlikely 
to have occurred ex nihilo. I shall attempt to explain this by looking at specific problems 
associated with joint naval commands (and the negative experiences of shared prouinciae), 
which, I shall suggest, foreshadowed the notion that the separation and limitation of 
prouinciae was advantageous (III.v). I shall then argue that the subsequent demarcation of 
prouinciae profoundly influenced the award and celebration of triumphs and, in particular, 
the distinct naval triumph (III.vi). 
The sixth and seventh parts (III.vii and III.viii) will then build further on the 
conclusions concerning how and why the prouincia classis was designated by considering 
the various instances when it was named and when it was not named. This will highlight 
the flexible use of the prouincia and the important role played by the Senate in the process 
of defining prouinciae. The chapter will also highlight the broader implications for how 
 Note already Lintott (1999), p.99-102 and Richardson (2008), p.30. 
prouinciae were divided and demarcated throughout the Republic, which will be further 
elaborated in Chapter IV. 
III.ii. Defining the fleet as a prouincia  
III.ii. Defining the fleet as a prouincia  
We have already seen that it is impossible to determine exactly how the prouinciae of the 
consular naval commanders were defined during the First Punic War because of the 
absence of explicit evidence (I.iv). The same applies to the consular naval command that 
was employed against the Illyrians in 229  the first serious naval expedition since the 
First Punic War. Polybius records that Cn. Fulvius Centumalus (cos.) left with 200 ships, 
whereas L. Postumius Albinus (cos.) left with the land forces of 20,000 soldiers and 2,000 
horse: we can only speculate from this that such a division was facilitated by the allotment 
of a prouincia classis rather than, as we have seen in the previous chapter (II.i), the 
allocation of military resources.
 There is even less evidence for the consular campaigns 
against the Histrians in 221 and Demetrius of Pharos in Illyria in 219, in which the type 
and number of forces are nowhere mentioned, let alone how, if at all, they were divided 
between the consuls.
It is only with the return of Livys History for the period between 218 and 167 (i.e. 
books 21-45), following the loss of books 11-20, that we are able to discover how and 
when the fleet was named and defined as a specific prouincia. Yet, only Brennan, in his 
magnum opus on the praetorship in the Roman Republic, has used this evidence to provide 
an explanation for how a prouincia classis was defined.
 He cites the praetorian 
prouincia designated as the classis et Macedonia in 192, as well as the fact that the 
magistrates allotted the fleet operated on land, and draws the following conclusion: 
 Polyb. 2.11.1-2:             
      ,        
. For Postumius forces see Thiel (1954), p.351f, n.31 and Polyb. 2.11.7:

 Brennan (2000), p.184 and also p.139-141 and p. 210-215. 
III.ii. Defining the fleet as a prouincia  
This lends some support to the hypothesis that the classis may actually be an 
abbreviation. We cannot tell whether the rest was expressed in the actual provincial 
designation, merely understood (i.e., to act in accordance with the praetors own 
good faith), or given as special instructions.
 Brennans proposal that the scope of the command of the fleet would have been 
merely understood may be dismissed outright as being entirely out of keeping with how 
the Senate defined prouinciae at this time. In fairness, Brennan had already, more 
plausibly, commented prior to this that, the Senate may have regularly added a further 
definition to circumscribe the magistrates sphere of activity: otherwise a commander 
could sail anywhere he liked
 As we shall see, the Senate did occasionally keep the 
classis sors temporarily flexible, but soon afterwards clarified its intention in naming the 
prouincia by defining what the task involved. Indeed, it will become clear in this chapter 
that Brennan was on the right track with his other two suggestions, that the classis could 
be further defined in the provincial designation or with specific instructions: there are a 
number of cases in which the Senate combined the prouincia classis with additional 
defining instructions at the start of the consular year during the late third and early second 
centuries  i.e. when the prouinciae were allotted and, most probably, as part of the 
provincial designation. I shall discuss these chronologically in the next section (III.iii), but 
it is first worth developing the hypothesis that the classis could have been an abbreviation 
for a more detailed command, together with its related problems, in greater detail here. 
This will allow us to consider how an extra definition could have been added to the classis 
and to test Livys propensity to abbreviate or omit the details of this practice, as the 
hypothesis suggests. 
 Arguably, the most vivid case in which the fleet was defined as a prouincia with 
specific senatorial instructions is to be found after Cn. Cornelius Lentulus used his position

 Ibid. 
III.ii. Defining the fleet as a prouincia  
as consul to block senatorial proceedings until he received Africa as his prouincia in 
 According to Livy, he aspired to an easy victory if the war continued, or if it were 
already ending, to the glory of having so great a war end in the year of his consulship.
The problem was that P. Cornelius Scipio (soon to be Africanus) had already been charged 
with finishing the war against the Carthaginians in Africa in 203.
 The Senate, therefore, 
resolved that one consular prouincia should be Italy and the other should be a fleet of fifty 
ships: 
patres igitur iurati  ita enim conuenerat  censuerunt uti consules prouincias inter 
se compararent sortirenturue uter Italiam, uter classem nauium quinquaginta 
haberet; cui classis obuenisset in Siciliam nauigaret; si pax cum Carthaginiensibus 
componi nequisset, in Africam traiceret; consul mari, Scipio eodem quo adhuc iure 
imperii terra rem gereret; si condiciones conuenirent pacis, tribuni plebis populum 
rogarent utrum consulem an P. Scipionem iuberent pacem dare et quem, si 
deportandus exercitus uictor ex Africa esset, deportare. si pacem per P. Scipionem 
dari atque ab eodem exercitum deportari iussissent, ne consul ex Sicilia in Africam 
traiceret. alter consul cui Italia euenisset duas legiones a M. Sextio praetore 
acciperet.
 There is, of course, a preliminary methodological question underlying this 
description concerning whether Livy, as a historian writing during the Augustan 
Principate, accurately reports the designation of the consular prouinciae as Italia and 
classis nauium quinquaginta. In other words, does he record the original names and 
descriptions as they were given in 201 or does he merely provide later interpretation of 
them?  
Whilst we lack contemporary evidence with which to test the accuracy of the 
names and descriptions of the prouinciae which Livy gives in his annual lists, it is clear 
that he had access to authentic archival details of senatorial activities from his 
 Livy, 30.40.7-9.

annalistic sources.
 As a result, Livys reports of the results of elections and the 
subsequent allotment of prouinciae can be considered to be generally trustworthy.
was apparently aware, for instance, that the prouincia Gallia would have been designated 
as Ariminum in 205, even though he still often prefers to use the former name in his 
records of the allotments made during the late third and early second centuries.
Elsewhere, he records Italia as a consular sors (and prouincia) in 171, yet subsequently 
claims that the consul who received this allotment was, in Gallia, quam sortitus erat...
is worth recalling that a prouincia only existed in a particular year because it had been 
named as such;
 and, as the naming of prouinciae was largely at the discretion of the 
Senate, the designation could be changed accordingly.
 This warns us of the danger of 
taking Livys names at face value and also illustrates that the names of prouinciae were 
not necessarily fixed: both Ariminum and Italia, for example, could have encompassed 
activities in Gaul (or Gallia).
 Indeed, the consul allotted Italia in 201 was also active in 
Gaul.
We are on much safer ground with the fleet, since this prouincia remained a fleet 
regardless of whether it was officially designated as the classis or as a specified number of

(the text is from Bliquez (1975), p.431. cf. AE 1971, no.540). This is fairly typical of the type of surviving 
(epigraphic) evidence that might be used to test Livy, but it does not get us any closer to the official 
terminology at Rome, as Bliquez (1975), p.433 already realised: The phrase   is only 
descriptive of Octavius role and not a translation of an official Roman title.

ships (e.g. naues quinquaginta, uel sim.).
 Moreover, the fact that Livy principally uses 
classis for the prouincia between the late third and mid-second centuries  i.e. even when 
he is presumably drawing on different sources  indicates that this was most probably the 
name of the official lot.
Despite the fact that the passage quoted above almost certainly derives from the 
annalistic tradition rather than Polybius, it is perfectly conceivable, then, that the name 
of the lot and the detail of the instructions derive from the original senatus consultum or a 
copy which was utilised by Livys source. As we shall see in the next section, conditional 
(si) clauses, as used in the senatorial instructions above, are specifically employed with the 
prouincia classis in 208 and 205 and even more frequently with other prouinciae.
are commonly utilised when the exact military situation was unknown or unpredictable 
and when a magistrate or promagistrate might have to take an action that ordinarily 
required the approval of either the Senate or people.
 Furthermore, conditional (si) 
clauses are to be found only fifteen years later on the bronze tablet discovered at Tiriolo in 
Bruttium recording a letter from the consuls with the provisions of a senatus consultum de 
Bacchanalibus (186).
 This offers a good case with which to test Livy, since he provides 
an abbreviation of the first main clause of the decree, including the first conditional

III.ii. Defining the fleet as a prouincia  
sentence and also elaborates (or omits) the other clauses.
 In addition, Briscoe argues that 
Livy reflects the original language of the senatus consultum (i.e. of 186) elsewhere with 
the use of the perfect infinitive to express the prohibition of certain acts.
 This further 
implies that Livys source had access to the content of the original senatorial records from 
186. It also appears to confirm that Livy abbreviated senatus consulta and could be fairly 
accurate in doing so. (I shall henceforth refer to Livy and take it for granted that the 
omissions or abbreviations may have originated with his sources.) With this detail in mind, 
one can reasonably suppose that Livys record of the prouinciae of 201 preserves the 
overall sense of the senatus consultum, if not the exact wording. 
 Returning to the question of how this prouincia classis was defined and 
understood, the complex senatorial instructions provided both a functional (the naval 
operations) and geographical (Sicily and Africa) definition. They were, therefore, both 
enabling and limiting: on the one hand, they gave the consul a mandate to operate in 
particular geographical spaces (i.e. Sicily and Africa); yet, on the other, they also restricted 
him to these same spaces with some fairly specific conditions. This would have been 
especially pertinent for the prouincia classis, given its inherent mobility and necessarily 
close connection with the coastal regions in terms of vital supplies (e.g. food and water) 
and shelter for the men serving on board the ships.
 The arrangement was also tailored to 
the military situation in Africa and the future relationship between the consul and 
proconsul, to which we shall return when we consider the fleet and the separation of 
imperium-holders (III.iv). This also raises a fundamental question about the extent to 
 Livy, 39.18.8-9: si quis tale sacrum sollemne et necessarium duceret, nec sine religione et piaculo se id 
omittere posse, apud praetorem urbanum profiteretur, praetor senatum consuleret. si ei permissum esset, 
cum in senatu centum non minus essent, ita id sacrum faceret, dum ne plus quinque sacrificio interessent, 
neu qua pecunia communis neu quis magister sacrorum aut sacerdos esset... (with Briscoe (2008), p.285f 
s.v. 9). Cf. Livy, 39.14.3-9. On the above issues see Pailler (1988), p.151-193, esp. p.178-193; Gruen

III.ii. Defining the fleet as a prouincia  
which prouinciae were generally prescriptive (or circumscriptive) in the third and second 
centuries. With this in mind, we might also wonder whether we should trace back the 
origins of the maiestas laws of the late second and early first centuries, restricting the 
movements of imperium-holders, to the third century. These questions will be fully 
examined in Chapter IV, after the relevant evidence has been assembled and analysed, 
since they have important implications for the use of prouinciae more generally.
 The next consideration, however, must concern to what extent the instructions from 
201 are representative of a wider practice during the Republic. This is a necessary 
prerequisite for answering the previous two questions. It is worth noting that Livy 
elsewhere summarises the consular naval assignment of 201 as the prouincia classis 
without reference to the important senatus consultum, which leads one to question whether 
he abbreviates and omits similar instructions on the other occasions in which he solely 
records the classis as the prouincia.
 As prouinciae were annually allotted ex senatus 
consulto, just how bare were the original clauses describing the provincial designations 
and to what extent did Livy and his sources compress them? 
 It is important to emphasise that Livys descriptions of the prouinciae are usually 
given within the context of the annual sortitio. The exact method by which provincial lots 
were drawn is unclear, but the basic practice seems to have involved placing the lots into 
an urn from which they were subsequently somehow drawn out.
 The names of the 
various sortes would most probably have had to be relatively basic, since it would have 
only been possible to inscribe each lot with a limited number of characters.
 It is

rather than the individual magistrates (cf. p.37; and 77f), which is certainly suggested by Livys language in 
III.ii. Defining the fleet as a prouincia  
reasonable to assume that any specific instructions which were issued with the provincial 
designations ex senatus consulto, such as those of 201, would not have been included in 
the allotment process and so would most probably not have been mentioned in the 
historical records of the sortitiones per se. Livys description of the prouinciae may, 
therefore, reflect this system with the words that would have originally been inscribed on 
each individual lot. For example, he describes the praetorian sortitio of 191 as follows:  
consulibus sortitis prouincias extemplo et praetores sortiti sunt. M. Iunio Bruto 
iurisdictio utraque euenit, A. Cornelio Mammulae Bruttii, M. Aemilio Lepido 
Sicilia, L. Oppio Salinatori Sardinia, C. Liuio Salinatori classis, L. Aemilio Paulo 
Hispania ulterior.
 These designations match the lots that Livy mentions as having been earlier named 
by the Senate with the notable exception of the classis, which is described as classis ut 
nauigaret quo senatus censuisset.
 The rationale for this sors (in order to sail wherever 
the Senate should have voted) implies that the Senate ordinarily defined the classis with a 
specific geographical area in mind (quo, wherever), since the ut clause would have been 
superfluous if it was usually left undefined.
 Indeed, Livy later reports that the Senate 
which the lots are obtained by the magistrates as opposed to vice versa (above). One could speculate that that 
the fleet, for instance, would have been inscribed as CLA, Sicily as SIC, Sardinia as SAR, the Urbana as 
URB, the Peregrinus as PER etc. Cf. Taylor (1966), p.71 for the representation of tribes with regard to 
voting in the assembly and e.g. RS no. 37 (Tabula Hebana), l.23: Suc(usana) et Esq(uilina). On the other 
hand, I do not wish to rule out completely the possibility that the consular and praetorian sortitiones were 
inscribed with numbers which represented the provincial designations (cf. Livy, 35.41.6, as quoted in n.266). 
Even if this was the case, though, they still would have almost certainly been associated with a single 
designation rather than a complex assignment in order to avoid confusion in the allotment process and so this 
does not alter my argument above (e.g. una = urbana; secunda = peregrina; tertia = classis; quarta = Sicilia 
etc.). For what it is worth, Plautus mentions that lots could be inscribed pieces of wood and records that one 
of them was inscribed with unum (Cas. 3.78), which could potentially relate to the practice in the early 
second century (Stewart (1998), p.13-22 does not explain this). However, it is possible that Plautus wished to 
invoke the allotment of numbered legions (e.g. Livy, 42.32.5) rather than prouinciae and play on the notion 
of being the first (e.g. prior) and so this is inconclusive.  
 Livy, 36.2.6. 
 Livy, 35.41.6-7: item de prouinciis praetorum decretum est, prima ut sors duae urbanaque et inter ciues 
ac peregrinos iurisdictio esset, secunda Bruttii, tertia classis ut nauigaret quo senatus censuisset, quarta 
Sicilia, quinta Sardinia, sexta Hispania ulterior. 
 Cf. Brennan (2000), p.184. One cannot completely rule out that Livy (or his source) inserted the clause to 
explain the use of the classis, but if this was the case it would be strange that it was inserted here and not 
anywhere else. In addition, one of the consular lots was also designated as quo senatus censuisset at the same 
time (Livy, 35.41.3-4), which suggests it was an authentic part of the praetorian sors. For a full discussion of 
this designation see Ch.III.iii. 
III.ii. Defining the fleet as a prouincia  
instructed C. Livius Salinator (pr.) to sail to Greece soon after the praetorian sortitio, 
which, presumably, provided a definition for the quo.
 It, therefore, appears that either 
the ut clause or where the Senate had voted to send the fleet has been omitted from Livys 
description of the allotment above. The clause was hardly necessary for the purposes of the 
actual sortitio or the annalistic record of it. 
 This may indicate that the single classis lot recorded in the various sortitiones was 
a convenient way of referring to what would have been a much more complex prouincia in 
reality than scholars, with the notable exception of Brennan, have generally assumed. The 
question remains whether the fleet was usually defined with instructions and, if so, 
whether they were more like the complex senatus consultum of 201 or the apparently more 
straight-forward resolution of 191. The next section will seek to answer this question by 
examining the other evidence for how the prouincia classis was defined between 218 and 
167. This will enable further elucidation of the type of instructions that were commonly 
employed to define the fleet within different historical contexts. We shall then be able to 
ascertain with a greater degree of certainty whether the above cases from 201 and 191 are 
representative of a much wider trend and to assess the implications of this.  
 Livy, 36.2.14-15. 
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space 
The first case in which Livy provides clear evidence for how a prouincia classis could 
have been defined with further instructions is to be found with the appointment of T. 
Otacilius Crassus (pro pr.) in 215, which is described as follows:
 ...T. Otacilius Crassus, 
postquam aedem Mentis in Capitolio dedicauit, in Siciliam cum imperio qui classi 
praeesset missus.
 Although Livy omits the process by which Otacilius was appointed to 
the command, it is most probable that he was granted independent imperium auspiciumque 
through a lex de imperio:
 as Brennan rightly argues vis--vis the other two possibilities, 
it is improbable that he was delegated imperium by the praetor urbanus in Rome (based on 
the reasonable assumption that the consuls were absent by the time that Otacilius had 
dedicated the Temple of Mens);
 and even less likely that his imperium was prorogued 
from his command in Sicily (pr. 217 and pro pr. 216).
 As the method of the 
 It should be noted that Cn. Servilius Geminus (cos.) took charge of the ships at Ostia in order to pursue 
the enemys fleet (and to protect the coastal regions of Italy) in mid-217 (22.11.5-8. Cf. Polyb. 3.88.8). 
Likewise, M. Claudius Marcellus (pr.) is described by Livy as being in charge of the fleet at Ostia around the 
disaster of Cannae in August 216 (Livy, 22.57.1. Cf. 22.35.6, in which his sors is described as in Sicilia). 
This fleet was later taken over by P. Furius Philus (pr. urb.), who carried out raids on Africa (22.57.8 and 
23.21.1-2). Unfortunately, we cannot conclusively determine whether the classis was explicitly designated as 
a distinct part of Geminus new assignment in 217; nor whether it was included in the prouincia first 
assigned to Marcellus (and then taken over by Furius) in 216.  
 Livy, 23.32.20.  
 I follow Brennan (2000), p.140 for the status of Otacilius here with further reasoning suggested in the 
following two notes. 
 E.g. Mommsen (1887), II, p.652, n.2; and Develin (1980), p.357. For the assumption that the consuls 
were absent note the language in Livy, 23.32.20. It remains possible that the praetor urbanus could delegate 
imperium as suggested by the evidence for this practice in 205 (Livy, 28.46.13), for which see most recently 
Vervaet (2012a), p.78 with n.134 contra Brennan (2000), Additional Note I, p.640-647. However, the 
delegation in 205 concerned Arretium and one could argue that Italy may have been a part of the 
responsibility praetor urbanus (e.g. note that the same praetor was charged with dealing with the land rights 
of Campanians in Livy, 28.46.6). As Otacilius was sent into Sicily, for which the praetor urbanus was 
certainly not ordinarily responsible, I think that it is more likely that he was given an independent grant of 
imperium auspiciumque alongside his new independent prouincia. 
 E.g. Willems (1885), II, p.559; and Jashemski (1950), p.25 (cautiously). Willems argues that the people 
probably gave Otacilius special dispensation to enter Rome with imperium pro praetore to dedicate the 
Temple of Mens on the Capitol in 215 (in a similar way as special dispensations were granted by the Senate 
for the day of a triumph). If he held imperium which was valid in Rome, as Willems suggests, one may 
wonder why he had to be appointed as duumuir to dedicate his temple (Livy, 23.31.9): arguably, his 
imperium praetorium would have been sufficient for this task (cf. Livy, 23.30.13-14). Furthermore, the 
Temple of Mens was apparently dedicated on 8 June (Inscr. Ital. XIII, 2, p.467) on the Capitol  i.e. within 
the pomerium  and, as Brennan suggested, Otacilius was probably not expected to return to Sicily after this. 
With this in mind, it is possible that the subsequent (ad hoc?) naval assignment coincided with the death of 
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
appointment is not recorded, it is not surprising that Livy does not preserve a full 
description of the prouincia. Nonetheless, the fleet must have been included in the 
provincial designation, since Livy records that he was specifically invested with imperium, 
in order to have command of the fleet.
 This is supported by the evidence that he was 
given the same fleet when he was elected praetor in 214 and that this command was 
continued in the context of the prorogata imperia prouinciaeque for 213, 212 and 211.
The question remains, however, what else Livy left out of his short notice about Otacilius 
command of the fleet.  
Some important clues as to how this question might be answered are provided by a 
speech that Livy attributes to Q. Fabius Maximus Verrucosus (cos. suff.) in which he 
outlines three reasons why Otacilius  a candidate for the consulship for 214  had been 
given command of the fleet in 215:
classem hoc anno, cui tu praefuisti, trium rerum causa parauimus, [i] ut Africae 
oram popularetur, [ii] ut tuta nobis Italiae litora essent, [iii] ante omnia ne 
supplementum cum stipendio commeatuque ab Carthagine Hannibali 
transportaretur. create consulem T. Otacilium, non dico si omnia haec, sed si 
aliquid eorum rei publicae praestitit. sin autem te classem obtinente, ea etiam uelut 
pacato mari quibus <non erat opus> Hannibali tuta atque integra ab domo uenerunt, 
si ora Italiae infestior hoc anno quam Africae fuit, quid dicere potes cur te 
potissimum ducem Hannibali hosti <hi> opponant?
King Hieron II of Syracuse (for the date see Eckstein (1987), p.348f). If Otacilius appointment can be linked 
with the death of Hieron, which occurred after the assignment of prouinciae at the start of 215 (cf. Livy, 
23.38.12), this would further suggest the ad hoc appointment was not foreseen at the start of the year. 
 Livy, 23.32.20. For the connection between imperium and prouinciae note especially Cic. Fam. 8.8.8, 
(quoting a (vetoed) senatus consultum from 51): Itemque senatui placere, in Ciliciam prouinciam, in octo 
reliquas prouincias, quas praetorii pro praetore obtinerent, eos, qui praetores fuerunt neque in prouincia 
cum imperio fuerunt, quos eorum ex s.c. cum imperio in prouincias pro praetore mitti oporteret, eos sortitio 
in prouincias mitti placere... Cf. Cic. Prou. cons. 3. See also the connection between imperium and 
prouinciae in Livys records of prorogatio imperii: e.g. 24.44.4 25.3.5; 26.28.7; 27.22.10; 28.10.5; 28.45.10; 
30.27.9; and 30.41.1 etc. 
 Livy, 24.10.5 (214 B.C.): P. Cornelio Lentulo praetori Sicilia decreta prouincia, T. Otacilio classis 
eadem quam aduersus Carthaginienses priore anno habuisset. Livy, 24.44.4 (213 B.C.); 25.3.5-7 (212 B.C.); 
and 26.1.12 (211 B.C.). For further references see Prag (2007b), p.289-291. 
 For Fabius see MRR I, p.254; and p.257, n.1.  
 Livy, 24.8.14-17. 
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
It is reasonable to connect the rationale outlined in this speech with the decision to 
send Otacilius into Sicily with imperium in order to command the fleet. Sicily would 
have provided an excellent base from which to (i) raid Africa, (ii) defend the Italian coast 
and (iii) potentially intercept Carthaginian supplies: Lilybaeum is, after all, less than 100 
miles from Cape Bon (Hermaeum) and less than 150 miles from Carthage.
 Indeed, 
Otacilius reportedly sailed from Lilybaeum to Africa, ravaged Carthaginian land and, then, 
sailing towards Sardinia, managed to intercept a Carthaginian fleet.
 It is possible that 
Fabius (or Livy) was, therefore, consciously referring back to the series of special 
instructions that were issued with Otacilius original assignment of the fleet, which could 
have included Sicilia and Africa (or the ora Africae) and even the litora Italiae. If correct, 
Livy preserves only part of the provincial assignment in his statement that Otacilius was 
sent in Siciliam. 
As mentioned above, Otacilius received another prouincia classis as praetor in 214, 
having missed out on the consulship  in no small part thanks to the actions of Fabius, who 
managed to secure his own election as consul.
 In this case, the classis was again 
explicitly combined with a geographical sphere of operation when Otacilius was 
instructed to sail to Sicily with his fleet following a rumour that the war in Sicily had 
spread.
 Unfortunately, because it is not certain when and how this rumour reached 
 See the numerous navigation routes between Africa and Italy via Sicily according to the ancient 
geographers in Arnaud (2005), p.154ff. 
 Livy, 23.41.8-9. Otacilius intercepted the fleet of Hasdrubal between Sardinia and Africa, yet he was 
unable to prevent Bomilcar sailing along the Sicilian coast and reaching Locri with supplies (Livy, 23.41.10-
11 with Thiel (1946), p.70f). 
 Livy, 24.9.1-5; and 24.10.5. As Brennan (2000), p.140 observed, this was probably the first time that the 
classis had been named as a praetorian sors (unless it was included in the lot drawn by M. Claudius 
Marcellus (pr.) in 216, as noted earlier). Although Livy does not record his regular list of prouinciae (and 
sortitiones) for 214, the details of these prouinciae are corroborated in the assignments he lists for 213 (as 
recognised by Richardson (2008), p.27). 
 Livy, 24.11.6-7: cum increbresceret rumor bellum in Sicilia esse, T. Otacilius eo cum classe proficisci 
iussus est.  
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
Rome, we cannot be sure exactly when the classis was defined.
 Nonetheless, it is most 
probable that it was originally intended that Otacilius should take charge of the ora 
maritima and naval matters in Sicily; and we might even speculate that he was also 
instructed to use this as base from which to conduct further raids on Africa (as he did 
towards the end of 212).
Further clues as to how the prouincia classis could be defined can be seen in the 
arrangements made for Sicily when, following the death of Otacilius towards the end of 
211, the Senate decreed that both Sicily and the fleet should be a consular prouincia: 
decreuere patres ut alteri consulum Italia bellumque cum Hannibale prouincia 
esset, alter classem cui T. Otacilius praefuisset Siciliamque prouinciam cum L. 
Cincio praetore obtineret.
In this particular case, Livys description of the consular sortitio might be seen to 
suggest that Sicilia et classis  separated by the conjunction et  were distinct elements of 
the same consular prouincia.
 It is also worth noting that the wording of the allotment 
varies from the reported senatorial decree above, which  assuming this is not only owing 
to the wording of Livy and his source  may provide some further evidence that the 
sortitio did not represent the full senatus consultum de prouinciis (which, as I suggested in 
the previous section, could have been far more detailed).
 I favour the interpretation given by Marchetti (1972), p.11 that the assignment stemmed from the letter 
reported in Livy, 24.7.8 (seemingly sent at the end of 215). Cf. Eckstein (1987), p.139 with n.18 and p.141, 
n.25. 
 For the overall arrangement in 214 see generally Livy, 24.12.7-8: in Siciliam eodem tempore duo 
praetores profecti, P. Cornelius ad exercitum, T. Otacilius qui maritimae orae reique nauali praeesset. For 
his raid of Utica from Lilybaeum towards the end of 212 see Livy, 25.31.12-15. Details of the command 
structure in Sicily between 214 and 211 are discussed in Ch.III.vii. 
 Livy, 26.28.3-4. This was the first time that the classis was included in the consular sortitio during the 
Second Punic War.  
 Livy, 26.29.1-2: is senatus consultis perfectis sortiti prouincias consules. Sicilia et classis Marcello, Italia 
cum bello aduersus Hannibalem Laeuino euenit. 
 Livy could well have had very good information on the provincial assignments, given that he was able to 
report the details of how M. Claudius Marcellus (cos.) and M. Valerius Laevinus (cos.) switched prouinciae 
(Livy, 26.29). Cf. Brennan (2000), p.325, n.22 who suggests a similar rationale for trusting Livys reports of 
prouinciae in 192.  
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
The designation of Sicily can be readily explained by the fact that M. Valerius 
Laevinus (cos.), having received the prouincia, undertook the pacification of the island by 
capturing Agrigentum and various other towns.
 Laevinus then compelled the Sicilians to 
turn their attention to agriculture, following the surrender of many towns, and he later 
traversed the prouincia with cavalry to rejuvenate the grain harvest.
 It is not beyond the 
realms of possibility that the Senate had provided him with specific instructions 
concerning the Sicilian grain  as part of his assignment associated with the prouincia 
Sicilia  especially if a system of grain tithes was formally instituted throughout Sicily at 
this time.
 In any case, these tasks had nothing to do with the fleet, which obviously 
served a different purpose.   
Regarding the classis element of the provincial designation, it is notable that 
Laevinus demarcated various tasks when he was summoned back to Rome to hold the 
elections in 210: 
M. Valerius consul litteris excitus, prouincia exercituque mandato L. Cincio 
praetori, M. Valerio Messalla praefecto classis cum parte nauium in Africam 
praedatum simul speculatumque quae populus Carthaginiensis ageret pararetque 
misso...
Bertrand assumed that the classis was a gloss inserted by Livy to describe the 
missions associated with the geographical prouincia Sicilia.
 Yet, we have seen that 
 Livy, 26.40 and 27.5.1-6.  
 Livy, 26.40.15-16 and 27.8.15-19 (209 B.C.).   
 For the idea that the grain tithe system was extended throughout Sicily by Laevinus see now Prag 
(2012a), p.60f with n.12 for references to the ancient and modern literature. It is worth noting that the Senate 
dispatched a legatus overseas in 208 with instructions to go to the Olympic Games in Greece in order to 
inform those Sicilians who had fled the war in Sicily that the Romans were restoring everything that they had 
possessed before the war (Livy, 27.35.3-4), which presumably included agricultural land. This may be 
indicative of a central senatorial policy, assuming the Senate were not following Laevinus lead.  
 Livy, 27.5.1-2. For L. Cincius Alimentus (pr.) see Prag (2007b), p.291f and for his legions see Clark 
(1994), p.134ff. Livys description of M. Valerius Messalla as praefectus classis represents his task rather 
than his official position (most probably a senior consularis legatus), for which see Ch.V.ii. For Messallas 
raid on the territory of Utica see Livy, 27.7.16-17.  
 Bertrand (1989), p.213, n.121: Si la flotte peut tre un instrument au mme titre que le sont les lgions

dune province (Italiam bellumque...classem Siciliamque, 26.28.3, construction en chiasme, lun reoit 
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
many of the tasks undertaken by Laevinus in Sicily were not directly associated with the 
fleet and that, as far as we know, he did not even take personal command of the fleet in 
this year. Whilst the fleet appears to have been a distinct part of his prouincia, the fact that 
Laevinus distributed specific tasks to M. Valerius Messalla (leg.) on leaving his prouincia 
raises two important (and by now very familiar) questions. Did Laevinus original 
provincial assignment associated with his prouincia classis include specific senatorial 
instructions to sail to Africa to plunder and gather intelligence about the Carthaginians, 
just as Otacilius was apparently granted his command for three specific reasons in 215? 
And, if so, has Livy simply omitted them yet again?  
Some important evidence is to be found in Livys record of Laevinus prorogation 
of 209, which explicitly mentions that the Senate instructed him to cross into Africa and 
plunder, or to send either L. Cincius Alimentus (pro pr.) or M. Valerius Messalla (leg.).
The Senate may have thought that he would be too busy with other tasks in Sicily, such as 
the grain harvest, to conduct the raid himself. Furthermore, he was also specifically given 
permission to cross into Africa within the context of the prorogatio imperii in 208: 
et in Sicilia ita diuisa res est: Sex. Caesari exercitus Cannensis datus est: M. 
Valerius Laeuinus  ei quoque enim prorogatum imperium est  classem quae ad 
Siciliam erat nauium septuaginta obtineret; adderet eo triginta naues quae ad 
Tarentum priore anno fuerant; cum ea centum nauium classe si uideretur ei 
praedatum in Africam traiceret.
lItalie et la guerre contre Hannibal, lautre la Sicile et le commandement de la flotte)... (cf. p.201f with 
n.51). However, there is a distinction between the fleet as part of the provincial designation above (Livy, 
26.28.3-4 and 26.29.1-2) and the legions which were decreed separately (Livy, 26.28.4-5). This is very 
different from the examples cited by Bertrand, which are misleading since, in those cases, the fleet is named 
as a resource rather than an explicit prouincia, for which cf. Ch.III.viii. The fact that the verb designating the 
prouinciae is also singular (so Bertrand (1989), p.200) is by no means decisive. 
 Livy, 27.7.16-17: cetera classe placere praedatum in Africam aut ipsum M. Valerium Laeuinum traicere 
aut mittere seu L. Cincium seu M. Valerium Messallam uellet. For the prorogatio imperii in Sicilia see Livy, 
27.7.12. Thiel (1946), p.116f, n.279 is unnecessarily sceptical of the order by claiming that the rumour of the 
preparation of a large Carthaginian fleet (Livy, 27.5.13-14) made it hardly imaginable. Yet, there was 
another rumour the following year when a similar order was issued (see above with Livy, 27.22.8-9) and 
Thiel (1946), p.130 accepts that Laevinus himself conducted a raid during this year. 
 Livy, 27.22.9-10. 
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
It is highly significant here that the instruction to raid Africa was framed with the 
condition, if it seemed appropriate to him [Laevinus]. Such an instruction would 
arguably have been redundant if he could raid Africa regardless; and so it is best viewed as 
providing Laevinus with the necessary mandate to cross into Africa, depending on how he 
interpreted the military situation in Sicily at the time.
 We have already seen in the 
previous section that Cn. Cornelius Lentulus (cos.) required a specific senatorial mandate 
to cross from Sicily into Africa in 201.
 A similar provision was also included with the 
prouincia assigned to P. Cornelius Scipio (cos.), following fierce deliberation about 
whether Africa should be explicitly named as his prouincia, in 205:  
...alteri consuli Sicilia et triginta rostratae naues quas C. Seruilius superiore anno 
habuisset; permissumque ut in Africam, si id e re publica esse censeret, 
traiceret...
Scipio was almost certainly able to send his legatus, C. Laelius, to raid the coast of 
Africa only as a direct result of this special dispensation.
 Yet, Livy does not report this 
in his description of the sortitio, which only mentions that Scipio was assigned Sicilia 
extra sortem.
 This provides yet another indication that such descriptions were 
 Cf. the prouincia Africa cum Sicilia assigned to the consul Ti. Sempronius Longus in 218 (Livy, 21.17.1). 
Laevinus personally landed his fleet of 100 ships at Clupea on the coast of Africa, devastated the land and 
then successfully defeated a Carthaginian fleet of 83 ships (Livy, 27.29.7-8). Cf. Livy, 28.4.5-7 (207 B.C.) in 
which the prorogatio imperii is unfortunately not recorded, although Laevinus conducted a raid on Africa 
and defeated a Carthaginian fleet of 70 ships in that year (Livy, 28.4.6-7). 
 See Ch.III.ii. 
 Livy, 28.45.8-9. For the prouincia, which was probably not a prouincia classis, see the discussion in 
Ch.III.vii. Cf. Livy, 28.40-45; App. Hann. 55; Pun. 7; and Plut. Fab. Max. 25-26.  
 Livy, 29.1.14 and 29.3.6-29.5.1. Note also the prorogatio imperii in 204: de Scipione nusquam nisi in 
senatu actum, ubi omnes legatique et tribuni classem exercitum ducemque uerbis extollentes effecerunt ut 
senatus censeret primo quoque tempore in Africam traiciendum Scipionique permitteretur ut ex iis 
exercitibus qui in Sicilia essent ipse eligeret quos in Africam secum traiceret, quos prouinciae relinqueret 
praesidio... (Livy, 29.22.11-12). 
 Livy, 28.38.12. It should be noted that the other consular sors is simply described as the Bruttii here when 
it is also elsewhere described as Bruttii et bellum cum Hannibale (28.45.9).  
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
compressed and that the original prouinciae could be designated in a much more complex 
manner.
Returning to the questions raised about the prouincia Sicilia et classis given to 
Laevinus in 210, it might reasonably be expected that the fleet element of this prouincia 
was further defined with a senatus consultum. This notion is supported by the comparable 
evidence from 209, 208, 205 and 201, in which consuls and proconsuls were given explicit 
permission to cross from Sicily into Africa. We shall see in the next chapter (IV.iii) that 
there is good evidence that such special enabling instructions were, in fact, necessary for 
any imperium-holder to cross from the geographical sphere of operation associated with 
his prouincia (i.e. Sicily in this case) into another sphere of operation (e.g. Africa).
The presumed instructions, therefore, would have enabled Laevinus to send M. Valerius 
Messalla (leg.) on a mission from Sicily into Africa towards the end of 210.
 If correct, 
then it follows that the original senatus consultum describing the instructions is missing 
from Livys account. We might even take this argument further and speculate that senatus 
consulta were supplied in other cases in which imperium-holders left Lilybaeum to carry 
out naval raids on Africa during the Second Punic War, even when they are not explicitly 
recorded by Livy.
 It should be noted that Appian at least thought that this resolution amounted to a decision to send Scipio 
into Africa and his selection as the commander ( ) for Africa:      
 ,            
... (Pun. 7); and    ,   ,    
 ,     ... (Han. 55). Cf. Sil. Pun. 16.698-700. 
 Note especially Livy, 30.24.1-4 with discussion Ch.IV.iii 
 Admittedly, we cannot rule out the possibility that the letter recalling Laevinus to hold the elections 
towards the end of the consular year contained senatorial instructions for Messalla to raid Africa, in which 
case we could only determine that Laevinus original mandate was simply to use his fleet around Sicily 
(Livy, 27.5.1-2).  
 E.g. Cn. Servilius Geminus (cos.) in 217 (Livy, 22.31.1-6; Polyb. 3.96.8-14; Zonar. 8.26), although he 
had a broad mandate to pursue the enemies fleet (Livy, 22.11.7-8); P. Furius Philus (pr.) in 216 (Livy, 
23.21.1-2; cf. App. Hann. 27); T. Otacilius Crassus (pro pr.) in 212 (Livy, 25.31.12-15); and, as noted 
earlier, M. Valerius Laevinus (pro cos.) in 207 (Livy, 28.4.5-7).  
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
The combination of a prouincia classis with special enabling (or limiting) 
instructions was by no means a unique phenomenon applicable only to the stresses of the 
Second Punic War. The prouincia classis was also combined with geographical spheres 
of operation during the eastern wars against Antiochus III (192-188) and Perseus of 
Macedon (171-168). We have already seen in the previous section that a praetorian lot was 
designated as the classis ut nauigaret quo senatus censuisset in 191, which provides a 
strong indication that the Senate usually defined the fleet alongside a geographical sphere 
of operation (quo).
 This may very well account for the classis et Macedonia sors 
allotted to A. Atilius Serranus (pr.) the previous year, although it should be noted that 
Macedonia and the fleet could have also served independent purposes with other 
definitions.
 In any case, one of the consular lots was also designated as, quo senatus 
censuisset  eam esse bellum aduersus Antiochum regem omnes sciebant... in 191.
the consular and praetorian quo senatus censuisset lots enabled the Senate to define 
these prouinciae whenever the military situation was confirmed  i.e. after war was 
formally declared against Antiochus III at the start of the consular year.
 After the 
 Livy, 35.41.6-7 with discussion Ch.III.ii. We can also compare the new prouincia assigned to Cn. 
Octavius when his imperium as praetor in Sardinia was prorogued into 204: et Cn. Octauio ut cum Sardiniam 
legionemque Ti. Claudio tradidisset ipse nauibus longis quadraginta maritimam oram, quibus finibus 
senatus censuisset, tutaretur... (Livy, 29.13.5-6). Brennan (2000), p.143 may be right to imagine that 
Octavius was given a prouincia classis, in which case the future senatus consultum concerning the ora 
maritima would provide an extra definition. Indeed, his prouincia is defined in terms of the ora Sardiniae by 
203 (Livy, 30.2.4). 
 As noted in the previous section, Brennan (2000), p.184 cites this as an indication that the classis was 
elsewhere an abbreviation for a more detailed provincial designation. With the conjunction et and the case of 
Laevinus in 210 in mind, one can imagine that Macedonia served a broader purpose, such as the preparation 
of a maritime supply route in case a consul was sent extra Italiam, for which cf. Gruen (1984), p.634 and 
Brennan (2000), p.206f. Likewise, one can imagine that the classis could have been defined in another way. 
It is notable, for example, that when legati returned with news that war with Antiochus was not imminent, 
but that Nabis of Sparta was attacking the Laconian coast, a mission with the fleet was confirmed: ...Atilius 
praetor cum classe missus in Graeciam est ad tuendos socios... (Livy, 35.22.2-3). Cf. Livy, 35.20.13-14. For 
the events more generally see Thiel (1946), p.283-291 and Gruen (1984), p.629-636.  
 For the significance of this lot see Bertrand (1989), p.201f and my own discussion in Ch.IV.iv. 
 See Brennan (2000), p.184f; and p.326, n.29 for discussion of the quo senatus censuisset sors. Cf. 
Balsdon (1939), p.182, n.78; Rhodes (1978), p.620; Briscoe (1981), p.174 s.v. 7. Quo senatus censuisset; 
and Stewart (1998), p.29; and see also now Briscoe (2012a), p.243 s.v. quo senatus censuisset, who notes 
the formulaic nature of the phrase and references to similar decisions concerning Roman legions. For the war 
vote see Livy, 36.1.1-6. The same rationale was presumably behind the Senates decision to leave one 
praetorian sors and, very possibly, one of the consular sors, unspecified as quo senatus censuisset in 171  in 
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
comitia centuriata had approved the war against Antiochus, the consular prouinciae were 
subsequently confirmed as Graecia and Italia.
 Meanwhile, Livy simply refers to the 
sors allotted to C. Livius Salinator (pr.) as the classis without reference to the ut nauigaret 
quo senatus censuisset clause.
 It is most probable that the prouincia was defined with 
additional instructions to sail to Greece soon after the consul was allotted Graecia, as Livy 
implies: 
C. Liuius praetor, cui classis euenerat, triginta nauibus paratis traicere in Graeciam 
primo quoque tempore iussus, et ab Atilio naues accipere.
It is even possible that the classis was originally defined in more elaborate terms 
than the instructions reveal here, since Livius sailed from Greece farther eastwards to 
Delos, Chios, Phocaea and wintered at Canae (or Kane, just south of modern Dikili in 
Turkey).
 Thiel interpreted the journey to Delos as a decision taken by Livius to, 
...transfer the war to the Asiatic waters...
 Although the Senate would almost certainly 
not have been aware of the exact military situation in the East at the start of the consular 
year when they allocated the prouinciae, we have seen that, ordinarily, it tightly controlled 
the various spheres of operation associated with the fleet.
 With this in mind, Livius 
this case to be defined after war had been voted against Perseus of Macedon (Livy, 42.28.6-7). Livy only 
mentions the consular lots of Macedonia and Italia after war had been voted and, therefore, after a quo 
senatus censuisset lot would have been defined (Livy, 42.30.10-11 and 42.31.1).  
 Livy, 36.1.1-9 and 36.2.1-2. For the declaration of war see further Rich (1976), p.87f and Pina Polo 
(2011), p.102-110. 
 Livy, 36.2.6. Cf. App. Syr. 22. It is worth comparing this to the way Livy treats the prouincia assigned to 
L. Anicius Gallus in 168, which is first given as peregrina et si quo senatus censuisset (44.17.10) and later, 
after a decision had been made, as follows: L. Anicius praetor, cuis inter peregrinos iurisdictio erat; eum in 
prouinciam Illyricum circa Lychnidum Ap. Claudio succedere placuit... (44.21.4-5).  
 Livy, 36.2.14-15. Note also Just. Epit. 31.6.7: Interim nuntiatur ei Liuium, Romanum ducem, cum LXXX 
rostratis nauibus ad bellum nauale a senatu missum aduentare. 
 Livy, 36.41-45 with Briscoe (1981), p.281-287. For Kane (Canae in Livy) see Barrington Atlas, Map 56, 
 Thiel (1946), p.295. Cf. Pietil-Castrn (1982), p.131; and Brennan (2000), p.213. Sailing to Delos was 
not unique to Livius, as indicated by the dedications made by A. Atilius Serranus (pr. 192) the previous year: 
e.g. IDlos 1429 A, col. I, l.20 and 1450 A, l.66. The difference was presumably that Livius sailed with his 
entire fleet and continued eastwards.  
 Livius would only have discovered the exact military situation on succeeding Atilius, for which see Thiel 
(1946), p.294 with Livy, 36.42.4-5. Cf. Livy, 37.14-15 for the consilium held by L. Aemilius Regillus (pr.), 
who succeeded Livius, about the best course of military action to take in 190. 
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
could well have been given special permission to operate in Asia through another mandate 
(perhaps, even based on the precedents from the Second Punic War) which is not 
preserved in Livys account:
 e.g. ...si e re publica censeret esse in Asiam traiceret... (uel 
sim.).
 Some comparative support can be found in the senatus consultum issued the next 
year which specified that one consular prouincia should be Graecia with the following 
resolution: et adiectum, ut, cum in prouinciam uenisset, si e re publica uideretur esse, 
exercitum in Asiam traiceret.
 Alternatively, if there was no explicit sanction, one could 
argue that Livius took a huge personal risk by sailing from his defined sphere of operation 
(Graecia) into Asia (perhaps using the causa rei publicae rationale), which would have 
undoubtedly backfired if it had not been successful.
 In this case, the action itself would 
not have been prohibited by statutory law, but Livius would still potentially have left 
himself open to prosecution for going against the mos maiorum (and the auctoritas 
senatus).
It was clear that the naval war against Antiochus was to be based around Asia in 
190 and so the Senate issued instructions to L. Aemilius Regillus (pr.), who had been 
allotted the prouincia classis, which explicitly defined Asia as his sphere of operation.
It is worth noting that the departures of the consul charged with the war against Antiochus 
 Cf. Briscoe (1981), p.281 s.v. 42-45.8: Thiels notion that it was Livius own idea to cross to Asia is 
improbable. He will have been given some instructions by the senate. 
 Cf. Brennan (2000), p.325, n.24: If they [the praetors allotted the classis in the second century] indeed 
had a provincia joined with special instructions, it may have been something like classis et Asia (or 
Macedonia) ut cum rege Antiocho (or Perse) bellum gereret.  
 Livy, 37.2.2-3. Cf. Briscoe (1981), p.291 s.v. 3. Note also Livy, 35.23.5-6 (192 B.C.): et ut M. Baebius 
ex Bruttiis ad Tarentum et Brundisium promoueret legiones decreuit, inde, si res posceret, in Macedoniam 
traiceret. 
 For the success and huge importance of Livius activities see generally Thiel (1946), p.293-313. 
 See Ch.IV.iii for a full discussion of the above issues. 
 Livy, 37.2.10-11: L. Aemilius, cui maritima prouincia erat, uiginti naues longas et socios naualis a M. 
Iunio praetore superioris anni accipere iussus et scribere ipse mille naualis socios, duo milia peditum; cum 
iis nauibus militibusque in Asiam proficisci et classem a C. Liuio accipere. For the praetorian sortitio see 
Livy, 37.2.1-2 and note also Livy, 37.14.1-4 for Aemilius journey to meet Livius at Samos (via the Piraeus 
and Chios). 
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
and Aemilius were also apparently co-ordinated and that this presupposes that some 
instructions must have been issued from the Senate or the consul (or, perhaps, both).
Unfortunately, Livy does not provide any more direct evidence for how the 
prouincia classis could have been defined with additional instructions in the remaining 
cases from 189, 171, 170, 169 and 168. However, as Brennan has rightly highlighted, one 
significant factor applicable to all of the cases in which a prouincia classis was named is 
that the imperium-holders who received this prouincia all operated on land.
 Arguably, 
one can infer from this  especially if combined with the evidence collected above  that 
the classis would usually have been defined by the areas in which these operations took 
place. We have already seen this in the various instances of naval raids on the African 
coast during the Second Punic War. The Senate must have also anticipated land operations 
when they assigned Atilius two thousand men from the socii et nomen Latinum and one 
thousand Roman soldiers in 192.
 Livius plundered Thyatira (modern Akhisar in Turkey 
 around 44 miles from the sea) and also attacked Phocaea, Sestus and Abydus;
Aemilius raided the city of Iasus and sacked Phocaea.
 Q. Fabius Labeo, who received 
the prouincia classis in 189, sent announcements around the cities of Crete ordering them 
to withdraw their arms and return captives.
 It is possible that there was a connection 
between Fabius land-based activities  apparently undertaken to prevent it appearing that 
he had an otiosa prouincia  and a definition for the fleet involving Asia.
 Indeed, 
 Livy, 37.4.4-5. Further weight can be added to this idea by the fact that the praetors, who were allotted the 
prouincia classis, also apparently set out at the same time as the consuls for the war against Perseus of 
Macedon in 169 and 168 (Livy, 44.1.3-4; 44.19.4-5; and 44.22.16-17).  
 Brennan (2000), p.184; and p.212f.  
 Livy, 35.20.12-13; Livy, 35.37.3; and 36.20.7-8. Cf. Ch.II.ii for the preparation of this fleet and the 
enrolment of land forces to be used in the fleet.  
 Livy, 37.8.7 (Thyatira); 37.9.8-11 (Sestus and Abydus in the Hellespont); 37.12.1-7; and 37.32.9-10 
(Phocaea). 
 Livy, 37.17.1-7 (Iasus) and 37.32.1-14 (Phocaea). 
 Livy, 37.50.8 and 37.60.4-7.  
 Livy, 37.60.2-3. For a mission connecting Asia and Crete cf. e.g. Livy, 42.19.7-8 (172 B.C.). See also IC 
II, 3.5 (Aptera, western Crete), which records L. Cornelius Scipio, P. Cornelius Scipio (Africanus), legatus 
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
Fabius eventually triumphed [ex] Asia de rege Antioch[o naualem], which may also be 
indicative of the association between the prouincia classis and the geographical sphere of 
Asia in which he operated.
 Finally, the four praetors who had been allotted the classis 
between 171 and 168 also operated on land: C. Lucretius Gallus sacked the Boeotian 
towns of Haliartus, Thisbe and Coroneia in 171;
 L. Hortensius sacked Abdera in the 
northern Aegean and Chalcis on the island of Euboea in 170;
 C. Marcius Figulus 
pillaged the land along the coast of Thessalonica, unsuccessfully attempted to besiege the 
city itself (and later Cassandreia) and plundered around the cities of Aineia, Antigonea and 
Pellene in 169;
 and Cn. Octavius captured and plundered Meliboea in 168.
In summary, it can reasonably be supposed that the spheres of operations in 
which these land operations took place were defined with senatus consulta issued 
alongside the prouincia classis at the start of the consular year. This has already been 
illustrated in the previous section with the senatorial instructions ordering Cn. Cornelius 
Lentulus into Sicily with a mandate to cross into Africa under certain conditions in 201. 
of Lucius, and L. Aemilius Regillus as  (and probably ). This potentially suggests that 
the three commanders (and another Cn. Cornelius Scipio [Hispallus?]) visited Crete, perhaps on their way 
back to Italy in 189  the year Labeo was appointed  an event not otherwise preserved in the historical 
record. One can only wonder as to whether Labeos mission had anything to do with the previous visit and, if 
so, whether it was planned beforehand. 
 Inscr. Ital. XIII, p.80f. We should also note that Aemilius also triumphed ex Asia de [reg(e) Antiocho 
naual(em)] in 189. See further Ch.IV.vi, in which I argue that there was an inherent link between a prouincia 
and a triumph (and the prouincia classis and triumphus naualis) pace Brennan (2000), p.184: The wording 
of the entries for naval triumphs of the early and mid-second century (recorded in the Fasti triumphales) 
does not get us much further, since it reflects nothing more than the annalistic tradition.  
 Livy, 42.56.1-7; and 42.63.3-12. Note the contrast between Boeotia (terra?) and the sea in Livy, 42.63.12: 
his gestis in Boeotia ad mare ac naues redit. Lucretius was initially allotted a quo senatus censuisset sors 
(Livy, 42.28.6-7) and once war had been declared against Perseus, the Senate resolved that he should go to 
the fleet at Brundisium and review the socii nauales (Livy, 42.31.6-8 and cf. 42.35.3-4). One can speculate 
that the classis was already a part of the lot alongside quo senatus censuisset at the time of the initial 
praetorian sortitio, as it was in 191. Lucretius is later described as having the classis as his prouincia, which 
is probably, once again, abbreviated (Livy, 42.48.5 and Zonar. 9.22). Cf. Brennan (2000), p.326, n.26, who 
suggests that the provincial designation is only fixed before he departs from the city. 
 Livy, 43.4.8-13 (Abdera); 43.7.5-11; 43.8.1-8 (Chalcis). In this year, Livys records of the elections and 
prouinciae do not survive at the start of book 43 (following 43.3.7). Nonetheless, for Hortensius succeeding 
Lucretius in the prouincia classis see Livy, 43.4.8-9; 43.7.8-11; and 43.8.5-10. 
 Livy, 44.10-13. For his prouincia see Livy, 43.11.6-9; 43.15.2-3; 44.1.3; and 44.2.1-2. Cf. Polyb. 28.16.3 
(    ).  
 Livy, 44.46.3. Cf. Brennan (2000), p.325, n.23, who notes that Meliboea is quite far inland in Thessaly 
(it was actually probably only about three miles from the Aegean coast). Cf. Livy, 44.13.1-3. For the 
prouincia see Livy, 44.17.10; 44.21.3-4; and 44.30.1. Cf. Vell. Pat. 1.9.5. 
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
Yet, the analysis carried out in this section allows us to conclude, with much greater 
certainty, that this was representative of a wider phenomenon by which the prouincia 
classis was usually prescribed with a geographical definition. This confirms that Brennan 
was correct to hypothesise that the classis was an abbreviation per se for a more detailed 
command.
 Furthermore, we can also determine that Livy compressed or omitted, in 
many cases, the senatus consulta which would have ordinarily defined the sors (and 
prouincia) classis with a geographical sphere of operation. This can be explained most 
easily by the fact that such details were not necessarily pertinent within the context of the 
sortitiones themselves.  
We might also now extend the above results and legitimately question whether 
instructions were common in other types of prouinciae. Indeed, special instructions issued 
alongside other prouinciae were just as likely to have been abbreviated as those issued 
with the classis in Livys History. Whilst this has not been always been fully appreciated 
in the existing modern scholarship, it deserves emphasis here because it has important 
ramifications for understanding the role of the Senate in prescribing prouinciae and 
exercising control over imperium-holders.
 We should distinguish these instructions from 
the imperial mandata of the Principate, but the origins of the latter can arguably be traced 
back to the custom of the issuing instructions with prouinciae ex senatus consulto during 
the Republic.
 See Ch.III.ii. 
 For a sample of some recent views see e.g. Richardson (1994), p.577: As might be expected, it seems 
that only rather generalised instructions would be given to a governor on his assignment of a provincia... 
Flower (2010), p.128: The instructions they [the commanders] had received prior to leaving Rome would 
probably have been general and unspecific in most cases. Drogula (2011), p.93: Although the senate 
certainly gave commanders some instructions (mandata)  at the very least the name of the enemy or place to 
be conquered  the vagaries of war and the difficulties of communication required that those commanders be 
allowed full discretion to direct military operations as conditions required. For the acknowledgement of 
specific senatorial instructions see Brennan (2000), p.210 and Brennan (2004), p.45. 
 Rich (1990), p.147, making a comparison with the particular type of imperial mandata issued during the 
Principate, notes that the Senate did not issue such mandata during the Republic. For imperial mandata see 
also e.g. Millar (1977), p.313-317. 
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
One rare piece of evidence for special instructions being customarily issued with 
prouinciae during the Republic is to be found in the law on the eastern prouinciae passed 
around the start of 100, which records instructions for the magistrate or promagistrate 
holding the prouincia Macedonia (  ).
 Included among these was 
the resolution that, ...before he [the praetor or proconsul] leaves the prouincia, according 
to the decree of the Senate passed in relation to him, [he] should establish the boundaries 
of the uectigal of the Chersonese, as he shall deem it proper, as quickly as possible.
Whilst the senatorial decree here seems to have provided the instructions about the 
uectigal to be carried out by the magistrate or promagistrate before he quits his prouincia 
(which is simply reiterated in the lex), it may have also included other instructions. Indeed, 
it plausibly relates to the orders given to the magistrate or promagistrate of Asia and 
Macedonia which is referred to in the next clause of the law:  
 []        | [     
     |,         
- 
vacat 
|  []     | 
  [ ]    | 
   [.      |     
    | []        | 
  [      . 
If the praetor or proconsul to whom the province of Asia or Macedonia shall have 
fallen abdicate from his magistracy, as described in his mandata, he is to have 
power in all matters according to his jurisdiction just as it existed in his magistracy, 
to punish, to coerce, to administer justice, to judge, to appoint iudices and 
 RS, no. 12, Cnidos Copy, col. IV, ll. 5-42. For the name and date of the law see now, above all, Ferrary

detail in Ferrary (1977), p.645-654, esp. p.653f, which is preferred by RS, no. 12, p.236f). I accept this dating 
as being the most probable and follow it throughout this study pace the recent article by Giovannini (2008), 
p.93-100, who argues for a date around the first few weeks or months of the year 99 (revisiting the proposal 
originally made in Giovannini and Gryznek (1978), p.33-46).

III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
recuperatores, <registrations> of guarantors and securities, emancipations, and he 
is to be <immune from prosecution> until he return to the city of Rome.
The mandata (ex senatus consulto?) mentioned in the law on the eastern 
prouinciae, which potentially included the instructions about the uectigal of the 
Chersonese, could well have been fairly standard by 100.
 There is no need to assume 
that the practice of issuing such orders was unique to this particular law, even if some of 
the specific detail may have been.
 Rather, it is the level of detail in this surviving 
evidence that is unique. This is, perhaps, better viewed as indicative that potentially 
complex instructions could have been included with other provincial assignments, as 
established in the mos maiorum, in addition to the fleet. 
Indeed, examples of instructions being issued with other prouinciae can be found 
much earlier.
 For example, the Senate decided that M. Valerius Laevinus (pr.), who had 
been allotted the sors peregrina, should defend Apulia with the legions from Sicily and 
protect the coastal region between Brundisium and Tarentum with 25 ships in 215.
These tasks, involving the geographical regions of Apulia and ancient Calabria, almost 
 RS, no.12, Cnidos Copy, col. IV, ll. 31-39 with the commentary on p.265 s.v. ll. 27-28: In 1974, we 
took the SC to relate to what precedes but given the parallel with l. 19, we now think that this was perverse 
and take the SC to relate to what follows; we suppose it to be similar to the mandata of l. 33.  
 For the translation of   as in mandatis see RS, no.12, p.250 and p.266 s.v. l.33 with 
comparative references. As the editors of Roman Statutes recognise, the resonances of the term in the 
imperial age are not to be read back into our text (p.266 s.v. l.33). The editors reference to Cic. Leg. 3.18 
is also very pertinent to the above discussion, since Cicero is critical of a senatorial legatus holding his 
position sine mandatis (i.e. without official instructions from the Senate) Compare also the activities of M. 
Valerius Laevinus with the Sicilian grain in 210 and 209, as mentioned earlier. 
 Cf. Richardson (1994), p.576: Such precise instructions [concerning the Chersonese] are unusual, and 
may be the result of the desire of the author of this law, who was in any case dealing with business more 
commonly handled by the Senate, to exercise greater control than usual over magistrates and 
promagistrates. 
 Note, as a relatively early example, the complaints that L. Postumius Megellus (cos.), who had a 
prouincia Samnium, had crossed iniussu senatus ex Samnio in Etruria in 294 (Livy, 10.37.6). This case is 
discussed further in Ch.III.v. 
 Livy, 23.32.16-18: Valerium praetorem in Apuliam ire placuit ad exercitum a Terentio accipiendum; cum 
ex Sicilia legiones uenissent, iis potissimum uti ad regionis eius praesidium, Terentianum <exercitum 
Tarentum> mitti cum aliquo legatorum; et uiginti quinque naues datae quibus oram maritimam inter 
Brundisium ac Tarentum tutari posset. Cf. Livy, 36.2.7 for a similar mandate given to A. Cornelius 
Mammula (pr.), who received a prouincia Bruttii in the praetorian sortitio of 191. 
III.iii. The prouincia classis and senatus consulta: function and space  
certainly represent a newly defined prouincia;
 and the Senate even later added the 
provision that Laevinus should cross into Macedonia with his fleet, if his legatus 
discovered that Philip V of Macedon was planning to join Hannibal.
 In addition, Q. 
Fulvius Flaccus (pr. urb.) was given 25 ships with which to defend the shore near the city 
of Rome ex senatus consulto and Ti. Sempronius Gracchus (cos.) later had his own fleet 
off Cumae.
 Although this was an especially difficult time in the Hannibalic War for the 
Romans, the notion that such instructions could be issued alongside other prouinciae, aside 
from the classis, raises some fundamentally important and, as yet, unanswered questions 
about why it was ever necessary to name the fleet as a prouincia at all.  
Laevinus initially had a fleet of 25 ships (later raised to 50), Fulvius was assigned 
25 ships and Gracchus utilised a number of ships off the Campanian coast and, yet, not one 
of these commanders was assigned a specific prouincia classis. Why was the fleet not 
specified as a prouincia, in its own right, in these cases? Conversely, why was it ever 
necessary to designate the prouincia classis at all, given that a fleet could be utilised as a 
military resource, like terrestrial forces, in another prouincia and given that instructions 
could be issued with other prouinciae (e.g. Apulia and the ora maritima between 
Brundisium and Tarentum)?
 Why did the Senate not just name a particular sphere of 
operation and, then, if necessary, assign a fleet as a military resource in the same way as 
they equipped imperium-holders with armies, finances and supplies to use with their 
prouinciae (the so-called ornatio prouinciae)?
 Unlike fleets, armies do not, after all,

 Livy, 23.38.10-12: si congruentia litteris legatorumque indiciis Philippi consilia essent, ut M. Valerium 
praetorem litteris certiorem faceret, isque L. Apustio legato exercitui praeposito Tarentum ad classem 
profectus primo quoque tempore in Macedoniam transmitteret daretque operam ut Philippum in regno 
contineret.

 Cf. Polyb. 6.15.4-5.  
seem to have been named as specific prouinciae per se.
 Willems long ago noticed the 
distinction between the designation of a prouincia classis and use of ships as resources in 
another prouincia, but he did not offer an explanation for this.
Having so far examined how the prouincia classis was defined with senatorial 
instructions, these questions, therefore, lead directly to the next part of this chapter in 
which I shall consider why the fleet was designated as a prouincia. This will not only 
elucidate the difference between the fleet as a prouincia and as a resource, as described 
above, but it will also further question the Roman concept of the prouincia more generally. 
 E.g. compare the following report of the classis as part of Laevinus prouincia and the assignment of 
consular armies in 210: decreuere patres ut alteri consulum Italia bellumque cum Hannibale prouincia esset, 
alter classem cui T. Otacilius praefuisset Siciliamque prouinciam cum L. Cincio praetore obtineret. exercitus 
eis duo decreti qui in Etruria Galliaque essent... (Livy, 26.28.3-4). Cf. Livy, 23.32.1-2.

rattache ce commandement  une province italique ou extra-italique. 
III.iv. The prouincia and the separation of magistrates and promagistrates  
III.iv. The prouincia and the separation of magistrates and promagistrates 
We have seen in the previous sections that the concept of the prouincia does not 
necessarily need to be approached in terms of whether it encompassed a task rather than a 
geographical area or vice versa. The Romans were perfectly capable of defining 
prouinciae in both geographical and functional terms, as already witnessed with the 
prouincia classis. However, as we have also observed, this does not explain why the fleet 
was named as a prouincia. An alternative approach, then, which has the potential to 
provide an answer to this question, is to view prouinciae primarily as a means of 
separating imperium-holders. Indeed, Lintott has rightly placed emphasis on the idea that 
the prouincia was one of the fundamental mechanisms by which the Romans separated 
magistrates in space.
 This can be slightly nuanced for our purpose, since it follows 
that the prouincia classis could have served to separate magistrates (and/or promagistrates) 
by function within the same space.  
The next step is to imagine that this notion of separation had a profound effect on 
the ways in which prouinciae were defined. For example, would the classis have been 
designated as part of the prouincia assigned to M. Valerius Laevinus (pr.) in 215, as 
mentioned at the end of the previous section, if other independent imperium-holders had 
also been operating in the same geographical regions of Apulia and ancient Calabria?
would have been important that certain functions were carried out  such as the defence of 
a particular area or the war against a certain enemy  and these could have been reflected 
 Lintott (1999), p.99-102 and esp. p.102: The provincial system to a large extent substituted separation of 
magistracies for a hierarchy of command.  
 Ti. Sempronius Gracchus (cos.) later arrived in Luceria in pursuit of Hannibal and sent Laevinus to the 
Sallentine region (i.e. ancient Calabria): Gracchus and the consul suffectus were first in the region of 
Campania with operations initially focussed on Cumae and Capua (Livy, 23.35-37; 23.39.5-8; 23.48.3; and 
24.3.16-17). Their consular prouinciae were probably named as Italia, perhaps with specification of the 
bellum cum Hannibale as in 210 (cf. Livy, 26.28.3-4). Meanwhile, promagistrates were also based around 
the Picenum region and Nola in Campania (Livy, 23.32.19; and 23.41.13-14). See further MRR I, p.253-256. 
III.iv. The prouincia and the separation of magistrates and promagistrates  
in the designation of the prouinciae.
 Yet, the definition of a prouincia could have also 
been influenced by whether more than one imperium-holder was located in the same 
geographical area and, if so, whether it was expedient to demarcate particular spheres of 
operation or responsibilities, such as the fleet, within this area. Kallet-Marx proposed a 
hypothesis that has the potential to explain the rationale for defining prouinciae in this 
...provinciae were strictly and formally demarcated only where it was necessary (1) 
to prevent commanders from stepping on each others toes...and (2) for the 
functioning of maiestas laws at the regular points of entry and exit...
The first point would have been fundamental for avoiding disagreements over 
which imperium-holder should lead an army or a fleet and what military strategy should be 
adopted for a particular geographical sphere.
 This would have applied to the naming 
of a prouincia classis, which would have avoided any ambiguity about who should take 
overall charge of a fleet in a particular area. The Senate would have been well aware of the 
problems connected with disagreements between commanders in the same prouincia and 
would have had no shortage of exempla.
Kallet-Marxs second point (II), however, is much less convincing: it makes more 
sense that the leges maiestatis of the late second and early first centuries were relevant 
only after prouinciae had been first defined (e.g. with motive (I) in mind) rather than vice 
versa. I shall argue in the next chapter that maiestas laws did not automatically lead to 
 Ch.III.iii.

 Cf. Kloft (1979), p.57; Lintott (1999), p.100-102; and Richardson (2008), p.30. 
 See e.g. Polyb. 3.110.1-4 (referring to Cannae in 216) and note, in particular: ...   
   ,    ... Cf. Livy, 22.44-45. Note also the 
near disastrous defeat of the army of M. Minucius Rufus (magister equitum) after his own imperium had 
been raised to the level of Q. Fabius Maximus Verrucosus (dictator) and after he had been given the shared 
summum imperium auspiciumque in 217, for which see Vervaet (2007), esp. p.208-212 with Livy, 22.27-30 
and Polyb. 3.103-105. See also the Senates pleas for the consuls to co-operate in 207, despite their well-
known enmity for one another, and the subsequent separation of their prouinciae in contrast to the previous 
year (Livy, 27.35.5-10). 
III.iv. The prouincia and the separation of magistrates and promagistrates  
tighter fines prouinciae, but rather simply codified the existing mos maiorum, as we have 
seen with the restrictions imposed on where magistrates could sail with their fleets in the 
previous section.
 Furthermore, I would also add the following two reasons why 
prouinciae might have been demarcated: 
III) to separate the jurisdiction of Roman imperium-holders from certain kingdoms. 
This provides an explanation for how Ap. Claudius Pulcher (pr.) was able to direct his 
force to the boundaries of his prouincia Sicilia and the Kingdom of King Hieron II of 
Syracuse (<ad> prouinciae regnique fines) in 215.
 Whilst it is not clear how the 
Syracusan Kingdom was demarcated from the prouincia Sicilia, the distinction could well 
have been between towns that were liable to pay taxes to Rome (including those with 
individual treaties with exemptions)  for which a Roman magistrate or promagistrate 
would have been responsible in the event of disputes  and those who were liable to pay 
Syracuse.
 Indeed, it is tempting to connect the praesidia which Claudius placed ad 
prouinciae regnique fines with the decision taken by the new Syracusan ruler to attack the 
urbes quae praesidiis tenebantur Romanis.
 This type of separation, however, would not 
have applied throughout the Roman Empire: prouinciae would most probably have only 
 See Ch.IV.iii. 
 Livy, 24.7.9. See further Ch.III.vii for the distinction between the prouincia uetus and the prouincia qua 
Hieronis regnum fuisset (e.g. Livy, 25.3.6). Note also Richardson (2008), p.28, who suggests that the 
boundary marked a limit, ...which was placed on the exercise of imperium by the holder of prouincia Sicilia 
within the territory of an ally whose lands had been assured to him by a full treaty. Cf. Livy, 22.56.6-8 for 
T. Otacilius Crassus (pro pr.) concern for the Syracusan Kingdom in 216. 
 As Prag (2012a), p.61 with n.13 recently wrote, it may not be a coincidence that the five ciuitates 
immunes ac liberae mentioned by Cicero are to be found in western Sicily  i.e. the uetus prouincia (Verr. 
2.3.13). The origin of this system presumably comes from the settlement of the First Punic War and, indeed, 
perhaps even the lex Hieronica. See also Ch.IV.ii for the hypothesis that Asia was defined in terms of its 
separation from the surrounding kingdoms (e.g. Cappadocia, Galatia and Bithynia) in the late second 
century. We should also note the division which P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus (pro cos.) made between the 
Numidian Kingdom and a prouincia Africa following the destruction of Carthage in 146: Ea pars quam 
Africam appellauimus diuiditur in duas prouincias, Veterem et Nouam, discretas fossa inter Africanum 
sequentem et reges Thenas usque perducta, quod oppidum a Carthagine abest ccxvi... (Plin. HN. 5.25). On 
the latter division cf. Lintott (1993), p.30 and Quinn (2004), p.1598f. 
 Livy, 24.7.9 and 24.7.1-2. 
III.iv. The prouincia and the separation of magistrates and promagistrates  
been demarcated vis--vis certain kingdoms and not more widely by territory 
administered.
IV) prouinciae might have also been demarcated to enable, and to restrict, the 
access of imperium-holders to the potential military gloria associated with a particular 
prouincia and the subsequent triumphal rights that might have been claimed as a result of 
any successes.
 This would have limited clashes between magistrates and promagistrates 
over the competition for glory and the possibility of a triumph, which can naturally be 
related to motive (I)  i.e. the prevention of commanders stepping on each others toes. 
Indeed, it is clear that there was an explicit connection between the award of a triumph and 
the prouincia associated with the commanders (prerequisite) success. For example, the 
triumph request of the consul P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica  who had been allotted Italia 
with specific instructions to conduct the war against the Boii  was obstructed by a tribune 
of the plebs in 191 on the grounds that he had not assisted with the Ligurian war.
 Scipio 
successfully countered this charge by arguing that he had not been allotted the Ligures as a 
prouincia, that he had not been at war with the Ligures and that he had not requested a 
 Kallet-Marx (1995), p.21, n.43 (above) was responding to the distinction made by Lintott (1981b) 
between geographical areas which Roman magistrates supposedly administered directly (i.e. the 
demarcated areas) and the penumbra of responsibility outside the territory they ruled directly. The 
distinction between direct and indirect rule is clearly an over-formulisation of what was, throughout the 
Republic, a much more fluid situation, as Lintott himself illustrates (Lintott (1981b) and Lintott (1993), p.22-
27). It should be noted that Lintott (1999) does not repeat the dichotomy between direct and indirect rule 
with regard to prouinciae in the Republic and, as noted above, he rightly places the emphasis on the 
separation of magistrates. Furthermore, Richardson (2008), p.117-145 (with summary in Richardson (2011), 
p.10f) argues that the organisation of prouinciae into territory administered (with fines prouinciae) belongs 
to the reign of the emperor Augustus. Cf. Syme (1939b), p.305 and Brunt (1978), p.174, n.59, who also 
question the extent to which prouinciae had clearly defined territorial frontiers (or fines prouinciae) during 
the Republic.  
 The Roman triumph has been the subject of much scholarship in the past decade: e.g. E.g. Auliard (2001); 
Itgenshorst (2005); Bastien (2007); Beard (2007); Krasser et al. (2008); Pittenger (2008); stenberg (2009); 
Dart and Vervaet (2011); and Lundgreen (2011), p.178-253. Despite this, the relationship between the 
prouincia and the triumph has often only received limited attention. A notable exception is Richardson 
(2008), p.32-37. One reason for this is the predominant focus on imperium and auspicium, which were two 
very important, though complex, independent aspects of a commanders right to triumph. They are not the 
focus of this chapter, since my concern is with the prouincia and the prouincia classis, but see now 
Lundgreen (2011), p.210-212 with notes for the modern literature on imperium auspiciumque and note, in 
particular, Versnel (1970), p.164ff.  
 Livy, 36.39.6-10. For the prouincia see Livy, 36.1.9 and 36.2.1-2. 
III.iv. The prouincia and the separation of magistrates and promagistrates  
triumph over them; rather, he requested a triumph over the Boii because his army had left 
no enemy (i.e. the Boii) in prouincia.
 He predicted that Q. Minucius Thermus (pro cos.), 
who was, after all, responsible for the prouincia Ligures, would soon subdue the Ligurians 
and request his own separate triumph.
 There was also an explicit link between the 
achievements of the triumphator and the prouincia on an inscription from the temple of 
Mater Matuta in commemoration of the triumph of Ti. Sempronius Gracchus (cos. 177) in 
Ti. Semproni Gracchi consulis imperio auspicioque legio exercitusque populi 
Romani Sardiniam subegit. in ea prouincia hostium caesa aut capta supra octoginta 
milia. re publica felicissume gesta atque liberatis <sociis,> uectigalibus restitutis, 
exercitum saluom atque incolumem plenissimum praeda domum reportauit; iterum 
triumphans in urbem Romam redit. Cuius rei ergo hanc tabulam donum Ioui 
dedit.
Tiberius boasted that he had captured or killed more than 8000 of the enemy in 
prouincia Sardinia, which is reminiscent of the way that Scipio sought to justify the award 
of his own triumph by claiming that he had left no enemy in prouincia.
These cases demonstrate that the triumph was inherently connected with the 
prouincia.
 As we shall see in the next section, a triumph might have also been denied if 
 Livy, 36.40.1-10 in which the Ligurian war is also referred to as alia prouincia (note also the reference to 
the ager Liguria). The Fasti Triumphales are fragmentary at this point, but (for what it is worth) the entry 
has been restored as: [P. Co]rne[lius Cn. f. L. n. Scipio Nasica an. DLXII | [co(n)s(ul) de Galleis Boieis --- ] 
(Inscr. Ital. XIII, I, p.78f; and p.553). On this episode see also especially Richardson (2008), p.36f. 
 Livy, 36.40.2-3. Cf. Livy, 34.55.6 (Ligures as Minucius consular prouincia in 193) and Livy, 35.20.6 
(Minucius prorogation cum exercitu quem in Liguribus habebat in 192). 
 Livy, 41.28.8-10. For the initial assignment see Livy, 41.8.1-5 and for further sources see MRR I, p.397f 
and p.401f. 
 It is worth noting that the same verb (subigere) is used with Sardinia and for Scipios claim that Minucius 
would soon subdue the Ligurians (Livy, 36.40.2). Note also the mention of Sardinia in the Fasti 
Triumphales: [T]i. Sempron[ius P. f.] Ti. n. Gracchus II, a. DLX[XIIX] | pro co[(n)s(ule), ex Sa]rdinia 
Termi[nalib(us)] (Inscr. Ital. XIII, I, p.80f). The connection between the name of the prouincia and the 
triumph is potentially significant in this case.  
 There are several further illuminating examples of the link between a prouincia and a triumph.  I) The 
proconsul M. Claudius Marcellus (cos. III in 214) returned from Sicily and requested a triumph in 211 and 
complained, ...quod prouincia confecta exercitum deportare non licuisset... (Livy, 26.21.2). Although the 
denial of the triumph and the award of an ouatio appeared to have stemmed largely from political rather than 
technical issues, the mention of the prouincia confecta in this context deserves emphasis. II) With this in 
mind, we should also note the language employed by Livy when the friends and relatives of Cn. Manlius 
Vulso (pro cos.) supported his request for a triumph in 187: postero die et cognati amicique Cn. Manlii 
III.iv. The prouincia and the separation of magistrates and promagistrates  
the commander had gained his success in another commanders prouincia (i.e. in aliena 
prouincia). It follows, therefore, that the Senate could have separated the potential claims 
of imperium-holders to a triumph by demarcating prouinciae (e.g. Ligures with the war 
against the Ligurians and Italia with the war against the Boii, as mentioned above). This 
raises the intriguing question of whether the designation of a prouincia classis might have 
also served as a means of separating the potential triumph claims of two (or more) 
imperium-holders by delineating a specific type of naval triumph versus a regular 
triumph.
With this consideration in mind, it is worth highlighting that Livy refers to the 
prouincia classis allotted to L. Aemilius Regillus (pr.) in 190 as a naualis prouincia.
The fact that the prouincia could be referred to in this manner, even if it is Livys own 
description, may be significant given the connection between prouinciae and triumphs 
summis opibus adnisi sunt, et auctoritas seniorum ualuit, negantium exemplum proditum memoriae esse, ut 
imperator, qui deuictis perduellibus, confecta prouincia exercitum reportasset, sine curru et laurea priuatus 
inhonoratusque urbem iniret. hic pudor malignitatem uicit, triumphumque frequentes decreuerunt... (Livy, 
38.50.2-3). Note here also the ablative absolutes and archaic perduellibus are, as Briscoe (2008), p.169 s.v. 
3. deuictis...prouincia notes, ...a deliberate reflection of the style of the tablets set up by 
triumphatores...their prayers of thanksgiving, and, in all probability, generals reports to the senate. One can 
speculate with this that confecta prouincia represents the authentic language of the original requests of 
imperatores for supplicationes, for which cf. Briscoe (2008), p.169 s.v. confecta. Note also Ciceros 
description of Cn. Pompeius Magnus achievements in 66 (Leg. Man. 28). III) The consul, Q. Minucius 
Rufus, unsuccessfully attempted to justify that both consuls should make a joint request for a triumph in 197: 
cum Q. Minucius utrique Italiam prouinciam obtigisse diceret, communi animo consilioque se et collegam 
res gessisse... (Livy, 33.22.3-4; and Livy, 32.28.8-9 for the joint prouincia Italia). See generally Pittenger 
(2008), p.76-91 for further discussion of the episodes from 211 (I) and 197 (III). 
 The naval triumph has recently received detailed treatment by Dart and Vervaet (2011). However, a 
compelling explanation for why naval triumphs were especially marked out still does not exist in the modern 
scholarship. Dart and Vervaet (2011) p.275 reach the following conclusion at the end of their discussion of 
the various naval triumphs without explicit evidence: Last but not least, it is important to point out that the 
naval triumph only differed from traditional triumphs in that the pageant was probably categorised by the 
artistic representation of naval warfare, perhaps some maritime spoils, and that its award ensued from major 
victories at sea. Attention to the naval triumph in the earlier cited works on triumphs is either non-existant 
or very limited and the conclusions reached have been relatively cursory. E.g. Auliard (2001), p.14 claims 
that, ...cest seulement la nature de la bataille qui permet de distinguer les deux formes du triomphe. 
Pittenger (2008), p.293f remains on the fence with the suggestion that the naval triumph, ...would appear 
functionally equivalent to a full triumph, more or less, though perhaps a fraction lower in rank as a subsidiary 
rite. stenberg (2009), p.46-57, esp.p.47-50 focusses on the celebration (and representation) of the triumph 
and proposes it was distinguished from the normal triumph by the presence of captured rams in the triumphal 
display. As we shall see in this chapter, none of these suggestions can account for all of the naval triumphs 
celebrated. 
 Livy, 37.4.5. Cf. Livy, 37.2.10: L. Aemilius, cui maritima prouincia erat... and Livy, 37.14.1-2 referring 
to Regillus succeeding ad nauale imperium. 
III.iv. The prouincia and the separation of magistrates and promagistrates  
suggested above. Aemilius returned to Rome the following year, having defeated the fleet 
of Antiochus III at Myonnesus, and celebrated a triumph, [pro] praet(ore) ex Asia de 
[reg(e) Antiocho naual(em)].
 Q. Fabius Labeo (pr.), Aemilius successor, also 
celebrated a naval triumph in 188 and, according to Livy, the historian Valerius Antias 
(writing c. 80-60) claimed that this was awarded merely for restoring captives from Crete, 
cum rem nullam aliam gessisset...
 It is doubtful that Livy preserves the full story here, 
especially given that he omits the fact that there was a dispute over the triumph.
 Yet, if 
the triumph was not awarded for any specific naval success, it may be better explained 
in terms of the prouincia classis (i.e. a prouincia naualis) that had been allotted to Fabius 
in 189.
The prouincia classis separated the functions of Aemilius and Fabius from the 
consuls L. Cornelius Scipio (Asiaticus) and Cn. Manlius Vulso in the East in 190 and 
 Arguably, each commander had the potential to acquire their own separate triumph, 
as a result of their independent prouinciae, if they could persuade the Senate that their 
achievements justified such an award:
 Aemilius and Scipio both triumphed ex Asia de 
rege Antiocho in 189; Fabius triumphed ex Asia de rege Antiocho in 188; and Manlius 
triumphed ex Asia de Galleis in 187.
  However, the resulting naval triumphs of Aemilius 
and Fabius were distinct. This allowed them to triumph from the same sphere as the 
consuls and, most probably, limited the chance of clashes over triumphal rights. Indeed, it 
is significant that naval triumphs represent the only known instances in which a praetor

 Inscr. Ital. XIII, I, p.80f. 
III.iv. The prouincia and the separation of magistrates and promagistrates  
triumphed from the same sphere (and war) as a consul. This could have certainly been a 
factor, then, in the Senates decision to demarcate a specific prouincia classis. We shall 
return to this theory in the next two sections (III.v-vi). 
At this point, taking into account the above hypothesis concerning the question of 
why prouinciae were demarcated, we can conclude that three out of the four proposed 
reasons would have been important: I) to prevent commanders from stepping on each 
others toes; II) to separate imperium-holders from kingdoms; and III) to prevent clashes 
over military gloria and triumphal rights. The first and third points are especially relevant 
explanations for why prouinciae were used as a means of separating magistrates and 
promagistrates in space and also by function within the same space. Taken together, they 
may explain why the fleet was named as a specific part of a prouincia. 
We earlier observed, for example, that the Senate designated the classis as a 
consular prouincia in 201 with a precise set of conditional instructions which both enabled 
and limited where the consul could operate with his fleet (III.ii). This was allotted to Cn. 
Cornelius Lentulus (cos.), who had attempted to force the Senate to name Africa as a 
consular prouincia: thus, in the event that war with the Carthaginians continued, he would 
have had authority over the naval operations with his fleet, whereas P. Cornelius Scipio 
(pro cos.) would have continued to have had authority on the land with his army in 
Africa.
 This separation would have prevented Lentulus and Scipio from stepping on 
each others toes (reason I). It would have meant also that Scipio would have had a single 
claim to the glory won against the Carthaginians on land and hence a regular triumph, 
whereas Lentulus would have been able to claim a distinct naval triumph, assuming that he 
was even able to achieve any military success. This would have prevented clashes between 
Lentulus and Scipio over the military gloria and associated triumphal rights (reason III). 
 Livy, 30.40.12-16. 
III.iv. The prouincia and the separation of magistrates and promagistrates  
Lentulus unique provincial assignment would have, therefore, mitigated the potential 
disruptive effect of his ambition for an easy victory and a role in the peace negotiations, 
preventing a clash with Scipio over military strategy, peace terms and later, outside the 
pomerium, the request for triumphal honours.
 In the end, Scipio agreed peace with the 
Carthaginians and Lentulus remained with his fleet in Sicily: a demarcated prouincia 
classis with its defining senatorial instructions apparently served its purpose and his hopes 
for an easy victory were dashed.
It is essential to stress, however, that it is improbable that the above two reasons for 
demarcating prouinciae evolved ex nihilo. Instead, the separation of prouinciae is almost 
certainly better explained as having developed over time from specific problems with joint 
commands and negative experiences of shared prouinciae. In other words, actual problems 
would have preceded and been the reasons for the demarcation (i.e. the solution). It is, 
therefore, important to consider first how the separation of prouinciae might have 
developed before we later examine the cases in which the classis was delineated from 
other prouinciae (III.vii). I shall focus in the next section on an early problem with the 
joint naval command, as illuminated by a serious conflict between C. Lutatius Catulus 
(cos.) and Q. Valerius Falto (pr.) over the triumphal rights associated with the decisive 
victory over the Carthaginian fleet in their shared prouincia in 241  i.e. less than twenty 
years after the Romans constructed their first major fleet.
 As we shall see, this event 
turned out to have important implications for the steadily evolving magisterial hierarchy, 
 Cf. Livy, 30.40.7-8. 
 See Livy, 30.44.13 for Lentulus fleet in Sicily. 
 For the construction of the fleet see Ch.I.iii.  
III.iv. The prouincia and the separation of magistrates and promagistrates  
the naming of the prouincia classis, triumphal rights and may have even shaped the 
subsequent history of the naval triumph.
 Note the pertinent comment by Lintott (1999), p.7: ...frequently our best guide to constitutional practice 
is to be read in ancient narratives what actually happened over a period, and, where there was conflict, to 
discover, as far as we can, in what terms the issues were formulated at the time.

III.v. A disputed naval triumph and the demarcation of prouinciae 
Valerius Maximus uniquely records the key dispute between Lutatius and Falto from 241, 
as mentioned at the end of the previous section, as follows:  
C. Lutatius consul [Catulus] et Q. Valerius [Falto] praetor circa Siciliam insignem 
Poenorum classem deleuerant. quo nomine Lutatio consuli triumphum senatus 
decreuit. cum autem Valerius sibi quoque eum decerni desideraret, negauit id fieri 
oportere Lutatius, ne in honore triumphi minor potestas maiori aequaretur, 
pertinaciusque progressa contentione Valerius sponsione Lutatium prouocauit, ni 
suo ductu Punica classis esset oppressa, nec dubitauit restipulari Lutatius...
The clear implication from this is that the consul did not want to share with the 
praetor the honos triumphi and the associated gloria for effectively ending the First Punic 
 It should not come as a surprise that only Valerius records the dispute, given the 
loss of Livys History and the general scarcity of other surviving evidence for this period. 
Information on every disputed triumph was not even given within the surviving books of 
Livys History for the period between 218 and 167. For example, the disagreement over Q. 
Fabius Labeos naval triumph of 188 is only incidentally mentioned in a speech of Cn. 
Manlius Vulso defending his own claims to a triumph the following year.
The dispute between Lutatius and Falto may have also been partly responsible for 
the divergent source tradition concerning who won the famous naval battle, which is worth 
exploring as it provides some of the context necessary to understand the conflict. Only 
Valerius explicitly mentions that both Lutatius and Falto destroyed the Carthaginian fleet, 
even though Falto claimed that this had been achieved under his leadership.
 Zonaras 
reports that they both first attacked Drepanum by land and sea and that Lutatius was

 For modern discussions of this incident see generally Brennan (2000), p.83-85; Pittenger (2008), p.73f, 
n.20; Dart and Vervaet (2011), p.271-273; and Bergk (2011), p.71-73.  
 Livy, 38.47.5-6. One can only wonder how many disputes over triumphal honours are not preserved  a 
point which I owe to an impromptu conversation with Professor John Rich. 
 Val. Max. 2.8.2 (as quoted above). 
III.v. A disputed naval triumph and the demarcation of prouinciae  
wounded in the siege.
 What happened next is compressed and somewhat unclear, but he 
also implies that both Lutatius and Falto played a role in the naval victory off the Aegates 
Islands, since he continues to use plural verb forms: they [Lutatius and Falto] learnt that 
Hanno had arrived with a fleet and they turned towards this [the fleet] in the same way 
as they [had previously] attacked Drepanum.
 This finds some support in the Fasti 
Triumphales, which record that both Lutatius and Falto triumphed.
On the other hand, Polybius and the Livian tradition  as found in the Periochae, 
Orosius and Eutropius  give the credit to Lutatius with no reference to Falto 
whatsoever.
 Yet, Polybius is not irreproachable and has been known to omit the name of 
a commander on other occasions, despite being the closest surviving source to the event:
for instance, he only records the name of one consul in his account of the Second Illyrian 
War (219) when we know from other sources that both consuls defeated Demetrius of 
Pharos.
 Furthermore, there may be a hint of Faltos involvement in the record of the 
Periochae, which states that military operations against the Carthaginians were 
successfully carried out a pluribus ducibus.
 The plures duces formula is used on several 
occasions in the Periochae to summarise victories from relatively short chronological 
periods  such as those of 255/254   which Livy would have inevitably recorded in 
 Zonar. 8.17.  
 Zonar. 8.17:             , 
        ,         
 .         , 
 ,   . The alternative explanation is that these plural verbs 
refer generically to the Romans. However, it is much more likely that Lutatius and Falto are still the subjects, 
since Zonaras explicitly refers to the Romans ( ) in the battle that followed, which implies a 
change of subject. At this point he refers to the Carthaginians and Romans rather than the commanders of the 
respective fleets (Hanno and Lutatius and Falto).

III.v. A disputed naval triumph and the demarcation of prouinciae  
greater detail.
 One can speculate, therefore, that Falto was included among the plures 
duces and played an active role alongside Lutatius, even though the consul presumably 
monopolised the credit for the decisive Roman victory (the summa uictoria) off the 
Aegates Islands.
 Indeed, the latter tradition is to be found in a later book of Livys 
History in a speech reported for Q. Fabius Maximus Verrucosus in which he claimed in 
205 that Lutatius had a titulus (the honour and/or even an inscription) for finishing the 
First Punic War.
 It is likely, then, that Lutatius and his relatives were quite successful in 
diminishing Faltos own association with the naval battle following the dispute of 241.
With this in mind, the difference in the wording of the Fasti Triumphales may also 
be significant: Lutatius is recorded to have triumphed de Poeneis ex Sicilia, whereas Falto 
triumphed ex Sicilia and this may further imply that Lutatius successfully claimed credit 
for the decisive naval battle and for finishing the (overall) war against the Carthaginians 
(or, more accurately, the Poeni here).
 Indeed, it is notable that all of the other triumphs, 
as recorded on the Fasti Triumphales as being celebrated during the First Punic War, were 
 Livy, Per. 18.3: res deinde a ducibus Romanis omnibus terra marique prospere gestas deformauerunt 
naufragia classium. That the context is 255-253 is clear from the fact it mentions M. Atilius Regulus (cos. 
256) just before this point (MRR I, p.209); Tiberius Coruncanius (Pontifex Maximus) immediately afterwards 
(MRR I, p.210 s.v. Pontifices); and the shipwreck of the fleet from 253 (MRR I, p.211 s.v. Consuls and 
Thiel (1954), p.250f). Cf. the successes of plures duces in Livy, Per. 12.4 (282-280 B.C.: against the 
Lucanians, Bruttians and Etruscans); 40.3 (183-181 B.C.: against the Ligurians and Celtiberians); and 41.12 
(174-173 B.C.: against the Ligurians, Histrians, Sardinians, and Celtiberians). Furthermore, we are able to 
compare Periochae 40.3 and 41.12 with the surviving text of Livys book 40 and 41: for example, although 
the commanders are not named in the Periochae, Livy describes that both consuls had successes against the 
Ligurians and that a praetor was victorious against the Celtiberians in 182 (Livy, 40.16.4-10).  
 Livy, Per. 19.12. 
 Livy, 28.41.3-4: ...et, sicut penes C. Lutatium prioris Punici perpetrati belli titulus fuit, ita penes te [P. 
Cornlius Scipio] huius fuerit. Within this context he also mentions drawing Hamilcar away from Drepanum 
and Eryx, i.e. after the naval victory at the Aegates Islands (Livy, 28.41.5). Q. Lutatius Cerco possibly 
alluded to the tradition in 109/108 when he minted coins presumably recalling Lutatius victory in 242 with a 
ship and an oak wreath on the reverse (RRC I, no. 305). Crawford wondered whether the oak wreath (or 
corona ciuica) reflected, ...the fact that the victory meant the end of the drain on Roman manpower caused 
by the First Punic War (RRC I, no.305), which would fit nicely with the idea that Lutatius monopolised the 
credit for the final naval victory and ending the war. Cf. Mnzer, RE 13 (1927), no.14, col. 2095 and 
Itgenshorst (2005), Katalog, p.112f, no.141. 
 Cf. Wiseman (1994), p.44-47 for a working example of how this was possible (from 264). 
 Inscr. Ital. XIII, p.76f. On this distinction see further Dart and Vervaet (2011), p.272f, who suggest that 
this implies Lutatius had the overall command in the war. Cf. Brennan (2000), p.280, n.46: The Fasti 
triumph. for 241 seem to show that the praetors triumph was regarded as inferior to that of the consul.  
III.v. A disputed naval triumph and the demarcation of prouinciae  
de Poeneis, which further highlights the unusual nature of Faltos triumphal celebration.
Falto could, then, have been allowed to triumph for the (less prestigious) actions in the war 
more generally ex Sicilia, despite the likelihood that he played an active role with the 
consul in the key battle at Aegates Islands.
If we can now reasonably suppose from the evidence presented above that both 
Lutatius and Falto had legitimate claims to the glory associated with the decisive naval 
victory against the Carthaginians, then just what were the issues at stake that led to the 
clash?
 The answer to this question is fundamental to understanding the possible 
measures taken in order to prevent such a conflict in the future. As we have seen, 
according to Valerius, the only author to refer to the dispute, the consul did not think that it 
was appropriate that he should share the honour of a triumph with a lesser authority 
(potestas).
 Further clues about the nature of the disagreement are provided in the 
description of the sponsio in which Falto unsuccessfully challenged Lutatius, claiming that 
whilst the consul was injured during the battle, he had executed all of the duties of the 
commander (imperator).
 Valerius describes the final judgement made by the appointed 
iudex, A. Atilius Calatinus (cos. 258), as follows:
tunc Calatinus, prius quam Lutatius causam suam ordiretur, quaero inquit, 
Valeri, a te, si dimicandum necne esset contrariis inter uos sententiis dissedissetis, 
utrum quod consul an quod praetor imperasset maius habiturum fuerit momentum. 
respondit Valerius non facere se controuersiam quin priores partes consulis essent 
 The only exception is that of C. Duilius from 260 (de Sicul(eis) et classe Poenica (Inscr. Ital. XIII, 
p.76f)). 
 Val. Max. 2.8.2 even writes after the resolution (above) that, sed ne Valerius quidem improbe, quia fortis 
et prosperae pugnae ut non legitimum ita <non immeritum> praemium petiit. Cf. Zonar. 8.16. See also De 
Sanctis (1916), III.i, p.264-267 on the chronological problems. 
 I find it highly unlikely that Valerius statement that both Falto and Lutatius destroyed the Carthaginian 
fleet relates to this having been carried out under the auspicium of the consul without the need for him to 
have been present. This seems to have been more appropriate to those commanders operating under the 
emperor during the Principate, for which note especially Hurlet (2001) and Hurlet (2006), p.161-177. 
 Val. Max. 2.8.2. 
 Ibid. For the injury see also Thiel (1954), p.315, n.821 and Lazenby (1996), p.155f with Zonar. 8.17; 
Oros. 4.10.5; and Eutr. 2.27.2.  
 For A. Atilius Calatinus and his own triumph as praetor in 257 see further Brennan (2000), p.80-83. See 
also MRR I  p.207, n.1 for the cognomen. 
III.v. A disputed naval triumph and the demarcation of prouinciae  
futurae. age deinde inquit Calatinus, si diuersa auspicia accepissetis, cuius magis 
auspicio staretur? item respondit Valerius consulis. iam hercules inquit, cum 
de imperio et auspicio inter uos disceptationem susceperim, et tu utroque 
aduersarium tuum superiorem fuisse fatearis, nihil est quod ulterius dubitem. 
itaque, Lutati, quamuis adhuc tacueris, secundum te litem do.
Valerius explains the dispute in terms of the consuls consulare imperium maius 
quam the praetors own praetorium imperium and the consuls auspicium carrying more 
weight in the field (militiae).
 However, the earliest datable reference to the minus 
imperium of the praetor comes from M. Valerius Messalla (cos. 53)  via Aulus Gellius  
who cites the (now lost) thirteenth book of the Libri Magistratuum of C. Sempronius 
Tuditanus (cos. 129).
 Although scholars often cite this in support of the existence of a 
hierarchy as early as the passage of the Lex Licinia Sextia in 367  which created the 
praetor as a colleague of the two consuls  a de iure distinction between a consul and a 
praetor may not have actually developed until sometime after the First Punic War.
legal questions were in vogue during the early Principate, especially with regard to the 
overarching position of the emperor and the monopolisation of triumphal honours by the 
domus Caesaris, and Valerius may well have retrojected these onto the dispute.
 2.8.2. 
 This is followed by e.g. Mommsen (1887), I, p.95 with n.1; Richardson (1975), p.51f (with necessary 
caution); Develin (1978), p.431; Brennan (2000), p.84 (with necessary caution); and Dart and Vervaet 
(2011), p. 272 with n.47-48; and Lundgreen (2011), p.219.

et a minore imperio maius aut maior <a minore> conlega rogari iure non potest. Cf. Cic. Att. 9.9.3. 
 Cf. Stewart (1998), p.95-136 and esp. p.121, who proposes that the distinction was, characteristic of 
legal thinking beginning in the second century, based on the collaborative campaigning and distinct triumphs 
of a consul and praetor. See also Bergk (2011), p.66f. For alternative views concerning the maius/minus 
distinction see e.g. Mommsen (1887), II, p.193, n.2; Brennan (2000), p.58-61; Brennan (2004), p.39; and 
Beck (2011), p.82-86.  
 The sponsio procedure was still used in the early Principate as argued by Crook (1976) and noted by 
Lintott (2001) and, therefore, cannot be used as evidence for the authenticity of Valerius account as 
suggested by Richardson (1975), p.51. For interest in similar issues during the Principate see, for example, 
the story of A. Cornelius Cossus dedicating the spolia opima in Livy, 4.20.5-11 (437 or 428 B.C.: MRR I, 
p.59) and the question over whether M. Licinius Crassus could dedicate the spolia opima, as the supreme 
commander, to Jupiter Feretrius in 29 (e.g. Dio Cass. 51.24.4). See generally Flower (2000) and Lundgreen 
(2011), p.219f, n.651 with further modern literature. For the monopolisation of triumphs by the domus 
Caesaris after the triumph of L. Cornelius Balbus in 19 see especially Hurlet (2001) and now Hurlet (2006), 
p.161-177 with modern literature. Note also Bergk (2011), p.72, n.64 for the fact that Octavian was sick at 
III.v. A disputed naval triumph and the demarcation of prouinciae  
Furthermore, Valerius fails to mention that Falto triumphed ex Sicilia only two days after 
Lutatius, presumably also ex senatus consulto (as in the case of Lutatius).
These factors suggest that we should treat Valerius description of the sponsio with 
a great deal of caution. Yet, even if the sponsio is inaccurate and anachronistic, there is no 
need to throw out the baby with the bath water: the details of the sponsio may have been 
falsified, but a conflict over triumphal honours could still be authentic and, as we shall see, 
this is what was important for the subsequent developments concerning the demarcation of 
prouinciae.
 Indeed, the most credible explanation for the dispute remains that it was 
triggered by a disparity in status between the consul and the praetor, within the context of 
fierce aristocratic competition, even if this was not viewed in constitutional terms at the 
time.
 Bergk, for example, recently proposed that it stemmed from the greater de facto 
prestige of the consuls, which would have come about from the spoils (and associated 
glory) which the consuls brought home from their campaigns in southern Italy during the 
early third century.
Regardless of how one interprets Valerius description of the sponsio, then, the 
dispute itself could still have illuminated a fundamental problem with a joint command: 
whilst both independent imperium-holders could expect a share of the glory won in their 
the battle of Actium and, yet, counted this among his victories and the reports that Lutatius was also injured 
before the battle (above). 
 I like the suggestion by Dart and Vervaet (2011), p.272 that Valerius only recorded the initial stage of the 
dispute and did not note that the Senate later came to a gallant compromise and allowed Falto to triumph 
ex Sicilia. Cf. Brennan (2000), p.85 and Bastien (2007), p.204. 
 Cf. Brennan (2000), p.84: It is impossible to ascertain the ultimate source for this contest as we have it in 
Valerius Maximus. It is unlikely to have survived in the direct tradition, and may have been largely a later 
invention. Nevertheless, it is a clever story, and may contain some authentic details. De Sanctis (1916), III.i, 
p.192, n.100 and Thiel (1954), p.83, n.63 reject the story in toto, but this is too dismissive, as Richardson 
(1975), p.51 found.   
 For the climate of aristocratic competition during this period see e.g. Bleckmann (2002); Beck (2005a); 
Hlkeskamp (2006); and Bleckmann (2011) with further bibliography. 
 Bergk (2011). See also the conclusion of Stewart (1998), p.136: The function distinguishing consuls and 
praetors suggests, moreover, that the hierarchy of duties and of the colleagues must be sought later in the 
increasing priority given to warfare in the late fourth and early third centuries. Cf. Beck (2005a), p.63-67 
and Beck (2011), p.84. 
III.v. A disputed naval triumph and the demarcation of prouinciae  
shared prouincia, the question of whether both should gain the honour would have been 
highly contentious.
 This, in turn, would have provided a warning about the future 
propensity for such conflicts over triumphal honours and also encouraged measures to 
prevent them. Indeed, Bergk has proposed that it led to a functional specialisation of 
praetorian administration:  
From then on, new duties and responsibilities were specified by laws that would 
not interfere with the hierarchy between the magistrates but that would simply try 
to avoid possible conflicts: praetor non collega consulis est.
This is an important hypothesis, which could be extended to include the future 
allocation of specific prouinciae and especially the use of fleet as a prouincia.
underlying cause of the dispute between Lutatius and Falto was, after all, the fact that both 
the consul and praetor shared the same prouincia  including the fleet that was used in the 
final battle  and both could, therefore, claim any victory or victories associated with it. 
The Senate had probably not considered this when they sent Lutatius and Falto into Sicily, 
since the issue had not previously arisen, as far as we can tell, when both consuls jointly 
commanded the fleet between 256 and 250. For example, Ser. Fulvius Nobilior and M. 
Aemilius Paullus, the consuls of 255, each celebrated a naval triumph de Cossurensibus et 
Poeneis for their capture of Cossyra and victory off the Hermaean promontory, which can 
be contrasted with the differences in the wording of the Fasti Triumphales for the 
 Falto took over the prouincia that had originally been given to A. Postumius Albinus (cos.), who was 
detained ad sacra (he was a Flamen Martialis) by the Pontifex Maximus when setting out with the other 
consul, in Siciliam ad classem (Livy, 37.51.2). Although the latter phrase is not technical in meaning, it is 
notable that Livy uses the same formulation for the period between 218-167 to refer to the specific naval-task 
of several other magistrates who had been assigned the prouincia classis, which may indicate that the classis 
was understood as a (shared) component of both consular prouinciae in 242: see e.g. Livy, 37.60.1 (189 B.C. 
with Livy, 37.50.8); Livy, 44.17.9-10 (168 B.C.). Cf. Livy, 31.27.8 and 34.40.7 for legati proceeding to the 
fleet (L. Apustius in 200 and L. Quinctius Flamininus in 194). 
 Bergk (2011), p.73f with the quotation from p.74. He speculates that the lex Plaetoria, concerning the 
jurisdiction of the praetor urbanus, could date to this time and that the jurisdictions inter ciues and inter 
peregrinos were then first assigned to the praetors (for the text see RS, II, no.44, p.731f). Unfortunately, it is 
impossible to ascertain when the lex Plaetoria was passed (cf. Brennan (2000), p.665f). 
 Contra Develin (1978), p.438: No compromise was needed for praetorian triumphs, but the clash of 
praetorian and consular imperium which occurred in 241 was again not a foreseeable contingency; both men 
were satisfied, as the consul triumphed first. 
III.v. A disputed naval triumph and the demarcation of prouinciae  
celebrations of Lutatius (de Poeneis ex Sicilia) and Falto (ex Sicilia).
 One can only 
wonder whether a conflict over triumphal honours would have occurred if the consul A. 
Postumius Albinus had been permitted to leave Rome with Lutatius instead of Falto, as 
originally intended, in 242.
 In any case, there would have been a strong political impetus 
to separate the possible claims of different commanders to military gloria from 241 
onwards in order to avoid such problematic clashes.  
Since a praetor could triumph, as Falto eventually did, simply separating 
magistrates by the type of magistracy (or genus imperii) was not a sure way of avoiding 
conflict.
 Indeed, a similar issue developed in a slightly different context in 200 after L. 
Furius Purpurio (pr.) claimed a triumph for a victory which he won in his prouincia 
Gallia.
 In this case, the Senate made the ad hoc decision to assign the same prouincia to 
C. Aurelius Cotta (cos.) following an unforeseen attack on the cities of Placentia and 
Cremona by various northern tribes.
 Furius won his decisive victory at Cremona before 
Cotta arrived, but the latter was also evidently furious at this turn of events and the triumph 
was contested on the grounds that Furius had used the consuls army and had left his 
prouincia early.
 Brennan highlighted that the precedent of 241 had established the right 
of the praetor to triumph from the same prouincia as the consul and this was evidently not 
 Ser. Fuluius M. f. M. n. Paetinus a CDX[CIX] | Nobilior pro co(n)s(ule) de  Cossurensibus | et Poeneis

Cossurensibus et Poeneis | naualem egit XII k. Febr. (Inscr. Ital. XIII, p.76f). 
 It should be noted that consuls could, of course, still compete with each other over honours and so a 
negative answer to the above question should not be taken for granted. The detainment of Postumius was 
previously noted, for which see also further Brennan (2000), p.83 with p.279f, n.36 for recent bibliography 
(with Livy, 37.51.1-2; Livy, Per. 19; Val. Max. 1.1.2; and Tac. Ann. 3.71).  
 See also Brennan (1994) for the possibility that M. Curius Dentatus (pr. suff.) was the first praetor to be 
awarded triumphal honours (the lesser ouatio) as early as 283. Richardson (1975), p.50-52 largely bypasses 
the question of praetorian triumphs when he argues that the triumph was predominantly a consular preserve 
down to the end of the Second Punic War. Develin (1978), esp. p.430-432 has a preferable explanation in 
pointing out that whilst a praetor could triumph, the major wars were mostly fought by the consuls and so 
there were fewer opportunities for praetors to request a triumph.  
 For the prouincia see Livy, 31.6.2. For a fuller discussion of this episode see especially Brennan (2000), 
p.197-200 and Pittenger (2008), p.71-75 and p.168-180. 
 Livy, 31.10-11. Livy, 31.47.4 seems to confirm that the war in Gallia was now thought of as the 
consuls prouincia: consul alter C. Aurelius ad confectum bellum cum in prouinciam uenisset...

III.v. A disputed naval triumph and the demarcation of prouinciae  
contested in 200.
 However, this did not end the possibility that magistrates (and 
promagistrates) would fight over the rights to the military glory (and the associated 
political capital) in the same prouincia, especially those of unequal status.
The dispute 
had been about two perceived unequals sharing gloria in 241, whereas Furius victory had 
essentially denied Cotta the chance of acquiring his own triumph  an opportunity the 
consul presumably felt he deserved more than the praetor.
It might be reasonably concluded, therefore, that the existing mechanism by which 
the Senate could avoid both types of clashes from 241 and 200 was through the 
demarcation of individual prouinciae  not only in space, but also by function in the same 
space. Indeed, we have already seen in the previous section that the award of a triumph 
was inherently linked to the success achieved vis--vis a particular prouincia.
addition, Mommsen recognised long ago that the triumphal rights of a commander would 
have been contested if his victory had been gained in a sphere of competence (i.e. a 
prouincia) other than his own  a notion more recently reaffirmed by Auliard.
 However, 
the extent to which this was a fixed rule and, if so, when and how it evolved is difficult to 
assess, since triumphs were ordinarily awarded for successes linked to the prouincia of the 
imperium-holder. As a result, there are relatively few triumphal debates in the surviving 
 Brennan (2000), p.198f. Cf. Mommsen (1887), I, p.127f, n.4; and Dart and Vervaet (2011), p.275. As 
Brennan (2000), p.199 rightly notes, Livy implies that the triumph was regarded as open to any magistrate 
(or prorogued magistrate) with imperium with Livy, 31.20.3: ...sed exemplum a maioribus non accepisse ut 
qui neque dictator neque consul neque praetor res gessisset triumpharet... Cf. Pittenger (2008), p.73, n.20. It 
is worth noting that Dio Cass. 18, frag. 57.81 refers to some people who cited many precedents 
(  ) on Furius behalf and one can imagine that one precedent would have 
been provided by the triumph of Falto in 241.  
 Cf. Zonar. 9.15: ...  ,     . Cf. Livy, 31.49.8-12 for 
complaints by Cotta on his return to Rome to hold the elections.  
 It is interesting to note that the main opponents of the triumph were said to be the consulares, which 
suggests that consular prestige (perhaps additionally related to the legal hierarchy at this stage) was thought 
to be at stake (Livy, 31.48.3-4). This is confirmed by Livys summary at the end of the dispute: ...uicta est 
praesentis gratia praetoris absentis consulis maiestas triumphumque frequentes L. Furio decreuerunt... 
(Livy, 31.49.1-2). Cf. Pittenger (2008), p.174 and note also Briscoe (1973), p.158 concerning the possibility 
that alliances had an impact on the dispute.

III.v. A disputed naval triumph and the demarcation of prouinciae  
ancient sources that explicitly revolve around the issue of whether a commander was in 
sua prouincia.
One step in the evolution of the Senates role in delineating access to triumphal 
glory through prouinciae may already have come in 294 when the triumph request of the 
consul L. Postumius Megellus was opposed on various grounds, including ...quod iniussu 
senatus ex Samnio in Etruria transisset...
 If Livy accurately records that both consular 
prouinciae were named as Samnium in this year, it is possible that the objection was that 
Etruria (or instruction concerning Etruria) was not part of Postumius prouincia.
the term prouincia is not explicitly mentioned in the debate and Postumius eventually 
triumphed over both the Samnites and the Etruscans (pl. sc.), despite opposition from the 
Senate.
 As a result, the designation of the prouincia may not have been decisive in the 
award of a triumph at this point.
 We can even speculate that there was a greater impetus 
for enforcing the connection between the prouincia and the award of a triumph after the 
clash between Lutatius and Falto in 241 had highlighted the importance of separating 
triumphal rights by demarcating prouinciae. 
The first explicit evidence for the principle that a commander could not triumph 
from anothers prouincia is to be found in Livys record that M. Helvius (pr. 197 in 
Hispania Ulterior) was denied a triumph in 195 precisely because he had fought, alieno 
 Mommsen (1887), I, p.128 interestingly observes, ...Indess hat man es mit diesem Bedenken spterhin 
nicht mehr streng genommen; seit dem ersten punischen Krieg ist vielmehr in allen uns bekannten Fllen 
dieser Art entweder der Triumph oder doch die Ovation bewilligt worden.  
 Livy, 10.37.6.  
 Livy, 10.32.2. It should be noted that the opposition is described as consisting of ...partim suos inimicos, 
partim collegae amicos... (Livy, 10.37.7). Cf. Oakley (1997), p.67-72 for the problems concerning the names 
of prouinciae and the activities of commanders and see also Ch.III.i-ii. 
 Livy, 10.37.8-12 and Inscr. Ital. XIII, I, p.72f. 
 On this episode see further Itgenshorst (2005), Katalog, p.42-44, no.93 and Oakley (2005b), p.374 s.v. 7. 
Alios quod...ab urbe exissent. 
III.v. A disputed naval triumph and the demarcation of prouinciae  
auspicio et in aliena prouincia.
 Whilst the exact meaning of this phrase has been much 
debated, the key point here  and one which Livy emphasises in the next sentence  is that 
Helvius had turned over his prouincia (Hispania Ulterior) and the associated army to a 
successor.
 It is not clear whether the decisive battle took place in the prouincia of Ap. 
Claudius Nero (pr. 195 in Hispania Ulterior) or M. Porcius Cato (cos. 195 in Hispania 
Citerior), although the latter seems to be more likely.
 In either case, the stumbling block 
was not whether Helvius held his own imperium auspiciumque, which he continued to 
possess, but that he was using the army of his successor and fought in another 
commanders prouincia.  
Helvius was one of the two praetors asked to mark a boundary which demarcated a 
prouincia Hispania Citerior from a prouincia Hispania Ulterior just two years earlier ex 
senatus consulto.
 It is clear that this territorial division would have only been envisioned 
within the context of the separation of two spheres from each other, rather than the wider 
demarcation of territory administered.
 With this in mind, we should note the 
 Livy, 34.10.5-6: causa triumphi negandi senatui fuit quod alieno auspicio et in aliena prouincia 
pugnasset; ceterum biennio post redierat, cum prouincia successori Q. Minucio tradita annum insequentem 
retentus ibi longo et graui fuisset morbo. See Livy, 32.28.2 for his prouincia in 197. 
 Note Briscoe (1981), p.71: Helvius was suis auspiciis but it could be argued that he was not fighting in 
the province he could legitimately operate them  whether he was claiming a triumph for fighting in Citerior 
in 197 or for his recent victory...et, therefore, is explicative (cf. TLL, V. 2. 873ff).  
 For the former see e.g. Brennan (2000), p.166f (although Brennan (2004), p.44 is undecided) and for the 
latter see e.g. Richardson (1986), p.89 and App. I, p.182. Livys report that Catos regio was secure ab 
hostibus after Helvius arrived, having defeated an army of Celtiberians, is suggestive that the battle was 
fought in Hispania Citerior, but not decisive (34.10.1-3).  
 Livy, 32.28.11: ...et terminare iussi qua ulterior citeriorue seruaretur. For the increase in the number of 
elected praetors from 4 to 6 see further Ch.II.ii. The enclitic conjunction ue (in general linking two or more 
words...between which there is an alternative but which are not mutually exclusive... (OLD, p.2018 s.v. -
ue)) suggests the boundary should be viewed from either Citerior or Ulterior Hispania (i.e. not on the 
opposite sides of the prouinciae).  
 Contra the implication by Lintott (1981b), p.55: It is possible that Livys notice about the division of 
Spain in 197 B.C. is anachronistic. However, it may equally be correct and reveal a plan to formalise Roman 
administration in Spain which proved too rigid to maintain in practice...We may thus accept that there was a 
move in the early second century B.C. to define provinciae strictly in terms of territory administered, which 
proved difficult to implement but nevertheless came to influence the meaning of the term provincia... (cf. 
Lintott (1993), p.23, which rightly views the boundary as maintaining the distinction between Further and 
Nearer Spain...). The general notion that the order concerned territory administered even led to the 
outright rejection of the historicity of the order in Livy by Sumner (1970), p.92-98 and Sumner (1977), 
which was rightly dismissed by Develin (1980), p.364-367; Richardson (1986), p.77f; and now Brennan 
(2000), p.165f (with significant differences). For a more convincing explanation see recently Cadiou and 
III.v. A disputed naval triumph and the demarcation of prouinciae  
precedent that was set in 206 when P. Cornelius Scipio, who had been appointed as an 
extraordinary promagistrate in 210, returned from Spain after numerous victories and was 
not able to triumph because he had not previously held a magistracy.
 It is uncertain 
whether a triumph would have been denied to someone who had not held a magistracy 
prior to this point, but once it had been given as the reason for the refusal in 206 it would 
have subsequently become part of the mos maiorum.
 Indeed, L. Cornelius Lentulus was 
refused a triumph in 200 on the grounds that he had also obtained the prouincia Hispania 
as an extraordinary promagistrate rather than as either consul or praetor.
 Within this 
context, the Senates decision to demarcate the Hispaniae just a few years later, in 197, 
could certainly have been influenced by the fact that, for the first time, two praetors were 
being sent to Spain, who could directly compete with one another for triumphal rights.
Moret (2012), p.27ff, who suggest the boundary was intended to demarcate the prouinciae and proposes that 
this was done by the territory of peoples and cities. For a consideration of how the separation may have been 
geographically conceived see further Ch.IV.ii. 
 Livy, 28.38.4-5: ob has res gestas magis temptata est triumphi spes quam petita pertinaciter, quia 
neminem ad eam diem triumphasse qui sine magistratu res gessisset constabat. Cf. Val. Max. 2.8.5 with 
Richardson (1986), p.70 and Brennan (2000), p.159. Polyb. 11.33.7 and App. Hisp. 38 incorrectly imply he 
celebrated a triumph, for which see Richardson (1975), p.53 and Pittenger (2008), p.58, n.17.  
 Cf. Lundgreen (2011), p.212f and p.221f, who argues that the notion that an imperium-holder could only 
triumph for victories won in his magistracy was not a fixed rule, but developed over time; however, the idea 
that one could only triumph if he had previously held a magistracy was eine Regel, which was only broken 
with the triumph of Cn. Pompeius (Magnus) in 81. Cf. Develin (1978), p.432f with p.433: ...it remains clear 
that a triumph could only be granted to one whose imperium derived initially from a magistracy. See also 
Brennan (1996), p.317f for the flexibility of the Senates rules concerning triumphs and note also Richardson 
(1975), p.52f and Bastien (2007), p.287f for useful overviews. 
 Livy, 31.20.3-5.  For the notion that this was now a rule see the arguments for L. Furius Purpurios 
triumph in 200: magna pars senatus nihil praeter res gestas et an in magistratu suis quis auspiciis gessisset 
censebant spectare senatum debere... (Livy, 31.48.6-7). For how the imperia extra ordinem may have been 
viewed by the the Senate vis--vis military victories see now Vervaet and aco (2007), p.35: Doubtless, 
these imperia, being entirely beyond the framework of the traditional cursus honorum and the regular 
(pro)magistracies, were increasingly frowned at by a majority of the senatorial nobility as an infringement 
upon the equal claims of its members laid on official honores and military gloria. 
 This, of course, need not be the only explanation. Cf. Develin (1980), p.364f, referring to the situation in 
Spain before 197: The commanders might well divide up their responsibility on territorial lines, using some 
sort of convenient demarcation but it would surely always be possible for them to co-operate. They need not 
be jealous of rights in their territories, as Scipios experience had shown that men whose imperium did not 
derive initially from a magistracy were not eligible to triumph. Note also that although the Senate had 
allowed Lentulus to celebrate an ouatio in 200 (Livy, 31.20.5-7), as Brennan (1996), p.324 rightly remarks: 
It is doubtful whether generals in the early and mid-Republic ever asked for the ovatio for its own sake. 
III.v. A disputed naval triumph and the demarcation of prouinciae  
One intention could have again been to limit the potentially destructive competition for 
military glory, which had been illuminated in 241 and, more recently, in 200.
Helvius was eventually allowed to celebrate the less prestigious ouatio for his 
military success in aliena prouincia, whereas Q. Minucius Thermus (pr. 196 in Hispania 
Citerior) celebrated a full triumph for victories  almost certainly associated with his own 
prouincia  only two months later in 195.
 The difference between these celebrations is 
comparable with the earlier triumphal celebration of the consuls C. Claudius Nero and M. 
Livius Salinator for a joint victory over Hasdrubal in northern Italy in 207:
 the former 
entered the city on horseback without soldiers (an ouatio?), whereas the latter entered on a 
chariot with the soldiers following.
 Regardless of how this arrangement was reached, it 
seems to have acknowledged Livius greater entitlement, as the commander in whose 
 It should be noted that a prouincia Hispania was allotted as a praetorian prouincia when only one 
magistrate was sent to Spain between 171 and 167: e.g. Livy, 42.28.6-7; 42.31.9 (Hispania to L. Canuleius 
Dives (pr.) in 171); Livy, 43.11.8-9; 43.12.11 (Hispania to M. Claudius Marcellus (pr.) in 169); and Livy, 
44.17.10 (Hispania to P. Fonteius Balbus in 168). The fact that Hispania was not designated as Hispania 
Citerior et Ulterior (uel sim.) potentially implies that the two Spains were not thought of as distinct 
administrative areas at this time. This contrasts with the joint urbana et inter peregrinos lot in the sortitio for 
189 (Livy, 37.50.8-9 and cf. 45.44.2), although these jurisdictions had been developing (and 
institutionalising) over a longer period of time and admittedly had very different functions. When the war 
against Perseus had ended, Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior were once again included as two 
separate praetorian lots and one wonders whether this once again partially related to desire to separate 
magistrates in space (Livy, 45.16.3-4).

uenisset, Neronis deduci de prouincia non potuisset, ut M. Liuium quadrigis urbem ineuntem milites 
sequerentur, C. Claudius equo sine militibus inueheretur. Cf. Val. Max. 4.1.9: C. Claudius Nero...Liuii

triumpho, quem ei aeque decreuerat, uti maluit, quia res in prouincia Salinatoris gesta erat. sic sine curru 
triumphauit, eo quidem clarius quod illius uictoria tantummodo laudabatur, huius etiam moderatio. The 
reconstruction of the Fasti Triumphales by Inscr. Ital. XIII, p.551 and, more recently, Itgenshorst (2005), 
Katalog, p.149-152, no.162 give Claudius triumph as ouans de Poeneis (as Mommsen (1887), I, 127f, n.1 
suggested). The explicit mention of an ouatio goes at least as far back as De uir. ill. 48.5. However, the case 
is complicated by Livys earlier report that the Senate had awarded a triumph to both commanders (Livy, 
28.9.9). Cf. Val. Max. 4.1.9 and De uir. ill. 50.2. Pittenger (2008), p.71 suggests that, Perhaps they [the 
consuls] came up with the idea of combining elements of the triumph and the ovatio into a spectacle all their 
own. Cf. Richardson (1975), p.55 and Stewart (1998), p.89.  
III.v. A disputed naval triumph and the demarcation of prouinciae  
prouincia the victory was achieved, to the more prestigious full triumph.
 It is worth 
emphasising that the two consular prouinciae were almost certainly demarcated in this 
year precisely because the Senate was especially keen to separate the consuls, given that 
there was a well-known emnity between them (which makes the above agreement all the 
more remarkable).
The dispute between Lutatius and Falto in 241 would have highlighted the 
importance of separating imperium-holders through the assignment of different prouinciae 
as a means of avoiding future disagreements. This, in turn, would have provided 
commanders with opportunities to achieve their own glory and would have also ordinarily 
prevented them from encroaching on the glory associated with another prouincia, since, as 
we have just observed, a regular triumph almost certainly would not have been awarded 
for victories won in aliena prouincia. As we shall see, this can also be applied to the 
delineation of a prouincia classis, which was never assigned to more than one imperium-
holder after 241. One might even speculate that it could have been precisely this 
development which led to the distinct naval triumph: if the naualis element of a triumph 
was only first associated with the prouincia classis from 241 onwards, we should not rule 
out that some of the naval triumphs prior to this point may have been, in part, retrojected in 
 The link between the prouincia and the triumph could have even provided the impetus for such an 
agreement. It is clear from Livy, 28.9.11-12 that Livius triumph was considered to be a greater honour. One 
might even speculate that Claudius was especially thankful that Livius was willing to agree to the 
compromise, since he even nominated Livius as dictator (see Livy, 28.10.1): was the nomination even part of 
the triumph arrangement, especially given that both consuls were present at the time? Note especially 
Richardson (1975), p.55: Nero was making a special effort to honour Salinator.  
 For the separation of the prouinciae see Livy, 27.35.10-11: prouinciae iis non permixtae regionibus, sicut 
superioribus annis, sed diuersae extremis Italiae finibus, alteri aduersus Hannibalem Bruttii et Lucani, alteri 
Gallia aduersus Hasdrubalem quem iam Alpibus adpropinquare fama erat, decreta... For the animosity see

gesturos timentes ne crescendi ex se inimico collegae potestas fieret...).

 The next section will examine the connection between 
the prouincia classis and the triumphus naualis in greater detail.

naval triumph) see generally Dart and Vervaet (2011), p.270f. 
III.vi. The prouincia (classis) and the triumphus (naualis)  
III.vi. The prouincia (classis) and the triumphus (naualis) 
The three naval triumphs from the period for which Livy survives were all celebrated by 
individuals who had been allotted the prouincia classis as praetors (189, 188 and 167).
A prouincia classis may also have been allotted to Cn. Fulvius Centumalus (cos.), who 
celebrated a naval triumph in 228, since Polybius reports that he was exclusively in charge 
of the 200 ships, whereas his colleague had command of the land force when they departed 
for Illyria in 229.
 As suggested in the previous two sections, one reason for demarcating 
a specific prouincia classis would have been to enable the recipient magistrate or 
promagistrate to claim a distinct type of (naval) triumph for success which was achieved in 
the same war and geographical sphere as another imperium-holder. Indeed, all four of the 
naval triumphs after 241 were celebrated from spheres in which there were two imperium-
holders active: in 228 ex Illurieis, in 189 ex Asia,  in 188 ex Asia and in 167 ex 
Macedonia.
 Yet, there were no reported disagreements over these naval triumphs. This 
observation can be seen in stark contrast to the debates, which we have seen in the 
previous section, over the praetorian triumphs in 241 and 200, as well as the rejection of 
Helvius triumph on the grounds that he had operated in aliena prouincia in 195.  
Cn. Octavius (pr. 168), for example, celebrated a naval triumph only one day after 
the regular triumph of L. Aemilius Paullus (cos. 168)  both ex Macedonia et rege Perse  
in 167.
 Octavius had been allotted the classis in the praetorian sortitio of 168, which 
was most probably combined with a specific instruction to proceed into Macedonia;
meanwhile, Aemilius received Macedonia as his consular prouincia (with the war against 
 Cf. Livy, 37.2.1 (L. Aemilius Regillus in 190), 37.50.8 (Q. Fabius Labeo in 189), 44.17.10 (Cn. Octavius 
in 168) and Inscr. Ital. XIII, p80f. See also the detailed discussion of these prouinciae in Ch.III.iii.

III.vi. The prouincia (classis) and the triumphus (naualis)  
Perseus, perhaps, also specified).
 The de facto and de iure unequal relationship between 
the consul and the praetor is evident from the fact that Aemilius, as consul, had the overall 
command of the war against Perseus of Macedon and he naturally gave orders to Octavius 
in the field.
 The key point, however, which would have prevented a disagreement over 
triumphal rights, is that Octavius celebrated a naval triumph immediately after Aemilius 
for his victories with the fleet: this was, after all, expressly celebrated with his socii 
nauales, gubernatores and magistri nauium, who were each given a set monetary 
reward.
 In contrast, pedites, centuriones and equites received the rewards in Aemilius 
regular (terrestrial) triumph.
 As these groups followed Aemilius chariot, it stands to 
reason that the naval personnel also followed Octavius in his triumph.
In comparison, L. Anicius Gallus (pr. 168) also triumphed, in the same year, de 
rege [Gen]fio et Illurie[is] with both milites, centuriones, equites, socii nominis Latini and, 
 Livy, 44.17.6-10. Cf. Cic. Diu. 1.103 (L. Paulus consul iterum, cum ei bellum ut cum rege Perse gereret 
obtigisset...) and Val. Max. 1.5.3 (cum ei sorte obuenisset ut bellum cum rege Perse gereret...). For the 
division of these commands see further Ch.III.vii. 
 E.g. Livy, 44.35.13; 45.28.8; and 45.41.3. Note especially Livy, 45.6.11-12 which states that Octavius 
sent King Perseus to Aemilius. Cf. Richardson (1975), p.56. 
 Livy, 45.42.2-3: Cn. Octauius kalendis Decembribus de rege Perseo naualem triumphum egit. is 
triumphus sine captiuis fuit, sine spoliis. dedit sociis naualibus in singulos denarios septuagenos quinos, 
gubernatoribus, qui in nauibus fuerant, duplex, magistris nauium quadruplex. Significantly, there does not 
appear to have been a difference between the award of a regular and naval triumph: cf. Vell. Pat. 1.9.6 (quod 
cum Anicii Octauiique triumphum nemo interpellaret); Diod. Sic. 31.8.10 (     
          ,   
   ); and Livy, 45.35.4 (...tribus iis omnibus decretus est ab senatu 
triumphus...). For the term socii nauales see Ch.II.i. 
 Livy, 45.40.4-5: ipse postremo Paulus in curru, magnam cum dignitate alia corporis, tum senecta ipsa 
maiestatem prae se ferens; <post> currum inter alios inlustres uiros fili duo, <Q.> Maximus et P. Scipio; 
deinde equites turmatim et cohortes peditum suis quaeque ordinibus. pediti in singulos dati centeni

aliis, si aut in suffragio honori eius fauissent, aut benigne hac ipsa summa <pro>nuntiata <ac>clamassent.  
 Professor John Rich very generously shared his original thesis (with Dr. Carsten Lange) that what made a 
naval triumph naval was that the sailors followed the triumphator. Compare, however, the regular triumph 
of L. Anicius Gallus described next (above) in which socii nauales also joined in. I would suggest that the 
sailors followed the triumphator in the naval triumph in as far as these were the typical forces assigned to 
those holding a prouincia classis. See Livy, 31.49.10 for the expectation that legates, military tribunes, 
centurions and soldiers would attend the triumph; and 39.29.5 for the general practice (not a fixed rule) that 
no commander enjoyed a triumph unless he had brought back his army. Cf. Livy, 26.21.1-3; 28.9.10; 
36.39.4-5; 37.46.6; 39.29.5; 40.38.8-9; and 40.43.5.  
III.vi. The prouincia (classis) and the triumphus (naualis)  
significantly, socii nauales.
 Anicius had originally been allotted the peregrina et si quo 
senatus censuisset sors, but this was later modified when he was sent in prouinciam 
Illyricum circa Lychnidum (presumably this was the senatorial decision concerning the 
quo).
 No fleet is mentioned in Livys description of the provincial assignment (and 
Lychnidus is about 50 miles from the Adriatic Sea), yet the fact that socii nauales were 
present in his triumph indicates that he also had a fleet.
 Furthermore, Appian preserves 
that Anicius sailed against Gentius before engaging him on land;
 and this was probably 
also reported by Livy after his notice that Anicius march in Illyricum was delayed by a 
report that 80 lemboi were ravaging the coast, since his text breaks off after tum classis 
ad...
 Unlike Octavius and Aemilius, then, Anicius commanded both terrestrial (two 
legions, auxilia etc.) and naval forces (a fleet and naval personnel including milites, 
nautae and remiges).
 Anicius also led socii nauales in his triumph, just as Octavius did, 
yet he celebrated a regular triumph rather than a naval triumph. Although this difference 
might be explained in terms of the regular terrestrial triumph taking precedence over the 
naval triumph, this was not necessarily a decisive factor. It may be better explained by 
 Inscr. Ital. XIII, p.80f (as noted on p.556, [Gen]fio appears to be a stone-cutters error for [Gen]tio). Livy, 
45.43.7-8: de praeda militibus in singulos quadragenos quinos denarios, duplex centurioni, triplex equiti, 
sociis nominis Latini quantum ciuibus, et sociis naualibus dedit quantum militibus. Compare part of a 
reported speech of M. Servilius Pulex Geminus (cos. 202) in defence of Aemilius triumph: et uos Gentium 
quam Persea duci in triumpho mauoltis, Quirites, et de accessione potius belli quam de bello triumphari? et 
legiones ex Illyrico laureatae urbem inibunt et nauales socii... (Livy, 45.39.3-4). For this speech see further 
Pittenger (2008), p.258-270.  
 Livy, 44.17.9-10; and 44.21.4-5: additus est his tertius L. Anicius praetor, cuius inter peregrinos 
iurisdictio erat; eum in prouinciam Illyricum circa Lychnidum Ap. Claudio succedere placuit. Cf. Ch.III.iii 
for the designation of a quo senatus censuisset sors.  
 Thiel (1946), p.376f, utilising Weissenborns emendation of Livy, 43.9.5-6, is probably right that his fleet 
would have comprised primarily of the 18 ships that had been sent from Italy two years earlier to the legatus 
at Issa. (These ships were probably manned with a number of Italian socii nauales, who would have then 
taken part in Anicius triumph on their return to Italy.)

III.vi. The prouincia (classis) and the triumphus (naualis)  
the fact that Octavius had a prouincia classis, whereas Anicius had a prouincia 
Illyricum.
Anicius returned with his own captives, such as Gentius and his family, and 
various spoils, including 220 lemboi, from Illyria.
 However, Aemilius evidently 
monopolised the spoils and captives from the overall victory against Perseus, since Livy 
records that Octavius triumph was sine captiuis...sine spoliis.
 Octavius triumph was 
limited to victories won with his fleet within the context of his prouincia classis;
whereas Aemilius, as the supreme commander against Perseus, triumphed first with the 
rights to the vast quantities of booty and captives won with his extensive army and, 
therefore, had the greater glory. (He had, after all, defeated Perseus at Pydna.)
 Despite 
 It is worth noting that the Senate decreed that Anicius and Aemilius should continue in Macedonia and 
Illyria: et Macedoniam Illyricumque eosdem, L. Paulum et L. Anicium, obtinere, donec de sententia 
legatorum res et bello turbatas et <in> statum alium ex regno formandas conposuissent... (Livy, 45.16.2-3).  
 Livy, 45.43.4-10. 
 Livy, 45.42.2-3. It should be noted that Octavius was responsible for transporting the booty back to Rome 
with his fleet (Livy, 45.33.5-6). It is also worth comparing the situation in 189 when L. Aemilius Regillus 
(pro pr.) and L. Cornelius Scipio (pro cos.) both triumphed ex Asia de rege Antiocho (Inscr. Ital. XIII, p80f), 
as discussed in Ch.III.iv. In this case, it is notable that the pecunia displayed in the naval triumph of 
Aemilius was apparently nequaquam [tanta] pro specie regii triumphi, which contrasts with the lavish 
regular triumph celebrated by Scipio (Livy, 37.58.4-5 and Livy, 37.59.1-6). Interestingly, no captives are 
mentioned vis--vis Aemilius triumph, whereas they are explicitly mentioned as being present in Scipios 
triumph. For Livys language in his reports of captives and booty see Phillips (1974), p.271f. Cf. Beard 
(2007), p.167-173.  
 Cf. stenberg (2009), p.50, who, without any explicit evidence, assumes that beaks were most certainly 
present to mark the parade as naval. However, the presence of rams was not exclusive to naval triumphs 
and, therefore, would not have been a good way of officially marking out a triumph as naval. Note, for 
example, the 220 lemboi brought back with Anicius in 167. Furthermore, Plutarch records that 110 ships 
with bronze rams ( ) took part in L. Licinius Lucullus regular triumph over Mithridates 
and Tigranes in 63 (Luc. 37.4). Cf. App. Mith. 116 for the presence of rams () in Cn. Pompeius 
Magnus triumph of 61 (cf. Mith. 117 and Plut. Pomp. 45.2). Note also Livys statement above that Octavius 
naval triumph was sine spoliis (Livy, 45.42.2-3). 
 For the ancient sources see MRR I, p.427. As discussed in Ch.III.iv, the same applies to the triumphs of L. 
Aemilius Regillus (pr. 190) and L. Cornelius Scipio (cos. 190) in 189; and also Q. Fabius Labeo (pr. 189) 
and Cn. Manlius Vulso (cos. 189) in 188 and 187 respectively. I am unconvinced by the argument by Stewart 
(1998), p.121 that Aemilius triumphed before L. Cornelius Scipio (pro cos.) in 189 because the hierarchy of 
senior magistrates was not fully defined until the passage of the Lex Villia Annalis in 180. Whilst this lex 
clearly played an important role in the institutionalisation of the cursus honorum, Aemilius returned before 
Scipio and triumphed almost a month earlier (not one day as in 167), for which see Livy, 37.59 with Inscr. 
Ital. XIII, p.553f. In any case, one should remember that the triumphator could decide the date of his 
triumph, as indicated in Livy, 39.5.11-12. Furthermore, despite Stewarts claim that they were not 
differentiated by type, Aemilius triumph was explicitly naval, whereas Scipio celebrated a regular triumph. 
III.vi. The prouincia (classis) and the triumphus (naualis)  
this  or rather, perhaps, because of this  there was no debate over Octavius triumph.
Unlike M. Helvius (pr. 197 in Hispania Ulterior), who, as we have seen, was denied a 
triumph in 195 because he had fought alieno auspicio et in aliena prouincia in 195, 
Octavius used his own forces (his ships and naval personnel) in his own functionally 
demarcated and independent prouincia.
Arguably, then, Octavius received his triumphus naualis for successfully 
completing his prouincia  in his case, the prouincia classis  when he returned to Rome 
with his fleet in 167. Whilst it remains true that those imperium-holders who were charged 
with the fleet had greater opportunities for naval victories, not every naval triumph was 
awarded for a naval victory at sea. One of Octavius main accomplishments, aside from 
capturing and sacking Meliboea, was the acceptance of the surrender of Perseus of 
Macedon (thus, effectively bringing the war to a close).
 Furthermore, I suggested in an 
earlier section that Q. Fabius Labeo may not have been awarded his naval triumph in 188 
for restoring captives from Crete, as recorded by Valerius Antias.
 Perhaps this was 
merely one of the arguments made against the triumph by his enemies, since he reportedly 
did little else? Rather, his triumph may have also been inherently linked to his own 
prouincia classis.
 It is notable that a prouincia classis was not named in the years 
 Livy, 45.35.4-6: tribus iis omnibus decretus est ab senatu triumphus mandatumque Q. Cassio praetori, 
cum tribunis plebis ageret, ex auctoritate patrum rogationem ad plebem ferrent, ut iis, quo die urbem 
triumphantes inueherentur, imperium esset. intacta inuidia media sunt: ad summa ferme tendit. nec de Anici 
nec de Octaui triumpho dubitatum est; Paulum, cui ipsi quoque se conparare erubuissent, obtrectatio 
carpsit. For the debate over Aemilius triumph, though, see Pittenger (2008), p.246-274. 
 Cf. Ch.III.v.  
 Livy, 45.6.10-12. Cf. Thiel (1946), p.412: There was scarcely a valid reason for Octavius triumph; no 
doubt he was granted this honour on account of the conspicuous fact of king Perseus arrestation, which was, 
however, quite foreign to naval warfare and to Octavius merits as an admiral. Cf. Thiel (1946), p.384; 
Pietil-Castrn (1982), p.134f; and Dart and Vervaet (2011), p.275. 
 See Ch.III.iv. 
 The same can also be said of the triumph of Cn. Fulvius Centumalus (pro cos.) in 228, who could well 
have had a prouincia classis (Ch.III.ii), since there is no evidence that he took part in a specific sea-battle. 
However, it should be noted that Fulvius was able to operate with his fleet on land, as he is reported to have 
captured several cities along the coast (Polyb. 2.11.13-14). Note e.g. Thiel (1954), p.353: So it is evident 
that the Roman fleet had a very easy task in this war: it had to sail from place to place, but hardly more than 
that... (cf. Dart and Vervaet (2011), p.273).  
III.vi. The prouincia (classis) and the triumphus (naualis)  
immediately following the allotment of the fleet to Fabius and Octavius in 189 and 168 
respectively.
 One can even speculate that Fabius and Octavius highlighted that their 
fleets had been brought back (the deportatio classis?) during their triumph requests, just as 
the deportatio exercitus seems to have been one consideration  though not always 
decisive  in the award of regular triumphs in the late third and early second centuries.
Similar things may be said about the two proconsuls, who having originally been allotted 
Ligures as their consular prouinciae in 181, both apparently triumphed for peacefully 
resettling the Ligurians and returning home with their armies in 180.
We have seen that naval triumphs were by no means only awarded for success in a 
naval battle or even, necessarily, for operations on the sea. Likewise, the presence of rams 
and/or naval spoils was not crucial for categorising a triumph as being naval (as often 
assumed in modern scholarship). Even the leading of socii nauales in a triumph was not 
unique to a naval triumph. As I have argued in this section, a far more likely explanation 
for the existence of the naval triumph is its connection with the prouincia classis. It is 
worth emphasising that no naval triumphs were celebrated after 167 and, based on the 
arguments above, one may connect this with the almost complete demise  not necessarily 
coincidentally  of the prouincia classis after the defeat of Perseus.
 See MRR I, p.365 and p.432f. 
 See e.g. Livy, 26.21.2 (211 B.C.); 36.40.7 (191 B.C.); 38.50.2-3 (187 B.C.); and 39.29.4-5 (185 B.C.). 
See generally e.g. Richardson (1975), p.61f and Richardson (2008), p.34-36.  
 Livy, 40.18.3 (prouinciae); 40.36.7 (prorogatio imperii); 40.38.1-9 (settlement and triumph and note 
especially, transacta re cum ueterem exercitum Romam deduxissent, triumphus ab senatu est decretus...). 
Rich (2009), p.220 rightly observes that the triumph of Q. Fabius Labeo eight years earlier (above) could 
have even provided precedent for this. 
 For the demise of the prouincia classis see Ch.IV.i. The next commander who may have been assigned 
the prouincia classis in 149 was decidedly unsuccessful, whereas the second, over one hundred years later, in 
43, never made it back to Rome. Dart and Vervaet (2011), p.276-280 discuss what they refer to as the three 
unnamed triumphs of Cn. Pompeius Magnus in 61, Octavian in 36 (an ouatio) and Octavian again in 29. 
Whilst they do not claim that the first two were officially distinguished as naval triumphs, they suggest that it 
was quite likely that Octavians Actian triumph in August 29 was marked in the Fasti Triumphales as 
being either ex Actio naualis or naualis ex Actio (cf. the reconstruction in Inscr. Ital. XIII, I, p.570: Imp. 
Caesar Diui f. C. n. IV, consul V, ex Actio XIX k. Sept.). This suggestion is based primarily on the fact that 
the triumph was awarded for a naval victory. However, as we have seen, a naval victory was not the 
In conclusion, the naming of a prouincia classis served as a means of separating 
the potential claims of different imperium-holders to specific gloria from within the same 
geographical sphere of operation: whilst it enabled one magistrate or promagistrate to 
claim, if successful, the gloria naualis necessary for a triumphus naualis, it also restricted 
his claims with regard to the gloria associated with the victories of the armies of another 
imperium-holder (and vice versa). This would have reduced the chances of potentially 
destructive clashes between commanders. It has been argued in this section that this use of 
the prouincia classis was most probably shaped by the negative experiences of aristocratic 
competition, as exemplified in the dispute between C. Lutatius Catulus and Q. Valerius 
Falto in 241. From that point onwards, the same naval command was never again assigned 
to more than one independent imperium-holder and this may have even resulted in the 
distinct triumphus naualis after 241. The next two sections will provide further support for 
the explanation that a prouincia classis was named in order to separate magistrates by 
function within the same space by examining how this actually worked in practice. They 
will do this by considering first the contexts within which the fleet was designated as a 
prouincia and, second, those instances in which it was not designated.   
prerequisite for a naval triumph and I believe that this was a regular triumph, especially given that Octavians 
prouincia could not properly be characterised as being naval. Indeed, in this case, in contrast to the 
celebrations after 241, there was no demarcation of a prouincia classis between two independent imperium-
holders (Agrippa, Octavians naval commander, was probably a senior legatus without his own independent 
imperium, pace MRR II, p.422f).  
III.vii. The use of the prouincia classis: the separation of functions in space  
III.vii. The use of the prouincia classis: the separation of functions in space  
It is important to recognise that, as far as we can determine from the evidence, the fleet 
was only ever designated as a specific prouincia between 218 and 167  i.e. within books 
21-45 of Livys History  when it was set to be employed in a particular space in which 
there would be two or more independent imperium-holders.
 This chronological period 
can be extended beyond the surviving books of Livys History if we imagine that the 
naming of a prouincia classis was behind the division of the land and naval forces between 
the two consuls in the First Illyrian War in 229 and at the beginning of the Third Punic 
War in 149.
 In contrast, we shall see in the next section (III.viii) that the prouincia 
classis was not designated when only one independent imperium-holder was present in a 
certain geographical area (with a combined land and sea command). These facts alone 
provide a strong hint that the fleet was named as a specific prouincia for the purpose of 
separating two or more imperium-holders by function in space, as proposed in the previous 
sections (III.iv-vi). We can now further substantiate this hypothesis and elucidate how 
such a separation actually worked in practice by re-examining the cases which were 
discussed earlier from this particular perspective. Once again, I shall proceed 
chronologically and start with the important use of the prouincia classis in Sicily during 
the Second Punic War. 
We first observed in section III.iii that the prouincia classis assigned to T. 
Otacilius Crassus (pro pr.) in 215 was most probably defined with specific senatorial 
instructions to raid Africa, defend the Italian coast and intercept Carthaginian supplies, 
which would have all been performed from an operational base in Sicily.
 Otacilius was, 
 For the name of the prouincia classis and its definition see Ch.III.ii-iii. 
 See further Polyb. 2.11.1-2 (229 B.C.) with Ch.III.ii and App. Pun. 75 (149 B.C.) with Ch.IV.i. 
 Livy, 24.8.14-17. 
III.vii. The use of the prouincia classis: the separation of functions in space  
after all, reportedly sent in Siciliam cum imperio qui classi praeesset...
 However, the 
naming of the prouincia classis would also have conveniently served to demarcate his 
naval function at Lilybaeum from the role of the praetor, Ap. Claudius Pulcher, who had 
already been allotted the prouincia Sicilia at the start of the year.
 We can recall that Q. 
Fabius Maximus Verrucosus (cos. suff.) reportedly told those gathered in the comitia 
centuriata during the consular elections for 214 to make Otacilius consul if he had fulfilled 
any of his assigned tasks on behalf of the res publica.
 Even if one questions the 
authenticity of these words, the overall sentiment remains true and reiterates many of the 
observations made in the previous sections of this chapter: the fleet offered unique 
opportunities for a commander to acquire personal glory through feats such as destroying a 
Carthaginian fleet, capturing money, supplies or hostages, gathering crucial intelligence, or 
even striking a blow against the Carthaginian homeland (with the necessary senatorial 
permission).
 As discussed in the previous sections, the separation of a land and sea 
command in Sicily would have avoided the potential for clashes over who had the 
command of the fleet and access to the possible glory this might have brought. Indeed, 
according to Fabius, Otacilius successful activities with the fleet would have had a direct 
influence on his election to the consulship for 214.
 These factors should be kept in mind 
as the remaining cases in which a prouincia classis was demarcated are reviewed. 
 Livy, 23.32.20. 
 Livy, 23.30.18 with Prag (2007b), p.290 for further references. For the presence of both Otacilius and 
Claudius at Lilybaeum see Livy, 23.41.8-9 (Otacilius) and Polyb. 7.3.1 (Claudius) with Walbank (1967), 
p.33 and Walbank (1979), Addenda and Corrigenda, p.777 contra Crake (1969), p.215. Evidence that a 
praetor was ordinarily based around Lilybaeum during this period is to be found in e.g. Livy, 21.49.6-8 (218 
B.C.); 22.31.5 (217 B.C.) and 23.21.2 (216 B.C.). 
 Livy, 24.8.15. 
 Cf. e.g. the record of the capture of Carthaginian ships by Cn. Octavius (pr. Sardinia) in 205, which 
Coelius Antipater (c. mid-second century) reportedly stated was laden with corn and supplies for Hannibal 
(Livy, 28.46.14 = Peter, HRRel, fr. 33). As a result of the predominant focus on the important land-based 
warfare of the Second Punic War, scholars have often ignored the above factors. One notable exception is 
Bragg (2010), p.62: ...these naval raids upon Africa had another key audience as well as the Carthaginians  
the Senate and the people of Rome... Cf. Rankov (1996). 
 Livy, 24.8.15.  
III.vii. The use of the prouincia classis: the separation of functions in space  
The organisation and separation of independent spheres in Sicily was continued 
on an even larger scale in 214 after the death of King Hieron II and the subsequent 
disaffection of the Syracusan kingdom:
 P. Cornelius Lentulus (pr.) succeeded Ap. 
Claudius in western Sicily and Otacilius (pr.), despite missing out on the consulship, 
retained the command of his fleet as praetor;
 whereas, M. Claudius Marcellus (cos.) and 
Ap. Claudius (probably prorogued pro pr.) operated in the former kingdom of Hieron II 
against Syracuse.
 These general command divisions are supported by the prorogations 
of 213: 
prorogata imperia prouinciaeque M. Claudio Sicilia finibus eis quibus regnum 
Hieronis fuisset, <P.> Lentulo propraetori prouincia uetus, T. Otacilio classis  
exercitus nulli additi noui...
Marcellus and Ap. Claudius operated together with their own fleet between 214 
and 213 in eastern Sicily (i.e. finibus eis quibus regnum Hieronis fuisset).
 This might 
lead one to question why the fleet was not demarcated as part of the prouincia of either 
Marcellus or Ap. Claudius with the above premise that this was ordinarily done in order to 
separate commanders in the same space in mind. However, this question could well be a 
red herring given that Otacilius had already been designated a prouincia classis: indeed, it 
would have defeated the purpose of separating commanders by a naval function if it was 
additionally named for another imperium-holder in Sicily. Although the question is further 
 As Richardson (1986), p.67 rightly recognised (in comparison with the situation in Spain during the 
Second Punic War): ...in Sicily where there was often more than one commander present during the 
Hannibalic war, each seems to have had a clearly defined provincia. Thus, in 214-213, there may have been 
as many as four commanders, each with a carefully distinguished command. For the contrast with Spain see 
further Ch.III.viii. 
 Livy, 24.12.7-8: in Siciliam eodem tempore duo praetores profecti, P. Cornelius ad exercitum, T. 
Otacilius qui maritimae orae reique nauali praeesset; et ceteri in suas quisque prouincias profecti, et quibus 
prorogatum imperium erat easdem quas priori anno regiones obtinuerunt. 
 Livy, 24.21.1-2: Romani, cum bellum nequaquam contemnendum in Sicilia oreretur, morsque tyranni 
duces magis impigros dedisset Syracusanis quam causam aut animos mutasset, M. Marcello alteri consulum 
eam prouinciam decernunt. The extent of Hieron IIs Kingdom is much debated, for which see most recently 
e.g. Walthall (2011), esp. p.166. 
 Livy, 24.44.4-5. Cf. Livy, 25.3.5-7 (212 B.C.).  
 See generally Polyb. 8.3.1-8.7.12 with the important criticism in Thiel (1946), p.87, n.156; Walbank 
(1967), p.69; and Brunt (1971), p.654. 
III.vii. The use of the prouincia classis: the separation of functions in space  
complicated by disagreements in the modern scholarship over the official status of Ap. 
Claudius between 214 and 213, it is most probable that he continued in Sicily as a 
promagistrate (with prorogued praetorium imperium) rather than as a legatus under 
Marcellus (i.e. without his own independent imperium auspiciumque).
 A possible clue 
for this arrangement is provided by Plutarch when he describes how renewed Carthaginian 
attempts on Sicily and the death of the new Syracusan tyrant Hieronymus led the Romans 
to send Ap. Claudius to that place (Syracuse?) with a military force (including ships?), 
which was later taken over by Marcellus on his arrival.
 This may allude to a senatorial 
decision  unrecorded in the other ancient sources  to send Ap. Claudius to Syracuse (his 
new prouincia?) from his previous position on the limits of Hieron IIs former Kingdom 
with land and naval forces around the start of the year, prior to the dispatch of 
Marcellus.
 His name is not recorded in Livys list of prorogued imperium-holders, yet Polybius refers to him as 
 (Polyb. 8.3.1), which implies that he operated pro praetore. Crake (1969), p.215f argued 
that Polybius was incorrect and that Ap. Claudius must have been a legatus, yet his argument rests largely on 
the absence of Ap. Claudius name from the list of prorogations (i.e. a dangerous argumentum ex silentio). It 
is important to stress that Livy does, in fact, write that all (omnes) those who had armies were prorogued, 
which would have included Ap. Claudius (Livy, 24.10.3). Furthermore, De Sanctis (1917), III.ii, p.278, 
n.138 rightly found it odd that four legions would have been under one imperium-holder in eastern Sicily (if 
Ap. Claudius was a legatus), which was not the norm (even for a consul). Although he believed that the 
Cannae army operated alongside Marcellus legions, Clark (1994) has made a strong case that the Cannae 
army remained with P. Lentulus (pr.) in the West and that two additional legions came over from Italy with 
the fleet at the beginning of 214. Finally, Brennan (2000), p.309f, n.74 notes comparable cases in which P. 
Cornelius Scipio (pro cos.) was given the choice of whether Cn. Octavius (pr. 205) should be prorogued pro 
praetore into 201 (Livy, 30.41.7-8) and the same choice was offered to M. Aemilius Lepidus (pr.) 
concerning L. Valerius Tappo (pr. 192 B.C.) in 191 (36.2.10-12). In contrast, I am not aware of a single 
instance of a magistrate becoming a legatus during the year after their magistracy before they had returned to 
Rome. Cf. e.g. MRR I, p.262, n.6; Walbank (1967), p.69f with Walbank (1979), Addenda and Corrigenda, 
p.778; Lazenby (1998), p.103; Richardson (1986), p.67, n.24; Eckstein (1987), p.139; and Prag (2007b),

 Ap. Claudius had already left Lilybaeum and positioned his forces <ad> prouinciae regnique fines prior 
to Marcellus arrival, just after he had written the Senate a letter with news that Sicily was being won over by 
the Carthaginians towards the end of 215 (Livy, 24.7.8-9). Livy then mentions that he was around Syracuse 
on Marcellus arrival (Livy, 24.27.4-6). For the chronology cf. Marchetti (1972), p.17-19 and Eckstein 
(1987), p.140-144 (with Appendix E, p.345-349). 
III.vii. The use of the prouincia classis: the separation of functions in space  
Arguably, then, there was no need to separate a specific naval function in eastern 
Sicily at the start of the year when Ap. Claudius was the only imperium-holder operating 
around Syracuse prior to Marcellus being dispatched; and, as Plutarch implies, Marcellus 
clearly had the overall command with the superior imperium auspiciumque  and vastly 
superior dignitas as a consularis and now consul II  when he later arrived.
 The fleet, 
therefore, would have been used as Marcellus saw fit within the prouincia that he shared 
with Ap. Claudius impari imperio.
 This represents an alternative method of separating 
imperium-holders by means of official hierarchy (and, undoubtedly, the de facto influence 
of Marcellus as a consularis) rather than by prouincia.
Meanwhile, as Richardson noted, Livys use of the term fines in his description of 
the prorogatio imperii of 213 (above) indicates that there was a clear division between the 
prouincia constituting what had been Hieron IIs Syracusan Kingdom and the prouincia 
uetus.
 Unfortunately, the sources are almost completely silent about where Otacilius 
operated between 214 and 212, which led Thiel to suggest that Otacilius, like Ap. 
Claudius, must have served under the auspices of the proconsul Marcellus in Syracusan 
waters...
 However, Otacilius is never referred to within the context of the siege of 
 The subordinate position of Ap. Claudius is clearly demonstrated by the fact that Claudius almost 
immediately sent the Syracusan ambassadors to Marcellus (Livy, 24.27.6). Cf. Livy, 24.30.1; 24.39.12-13 
and Plut. Marc. 14.3. One might also compare this with the consular and praetorian commanders sent to 
Sicily during the First Slave War, despite the problems posed by the surviving sources (and especially after 
the arrival of the a consul around mid-year in 134), for which see further Brennan (1993) with Appendix B, 
p.184 for  table with his conclusions. 
 It should be noted that Marcellus placed T. Quinctius Crispinus (almost certainly his legatus) in charge of 
the fleet and the old camp after Ap. Claudius left to stand for the consulship towards the end of 213 (Livy, 
24.39.12-13). 
 One can compare this with the sharing of Hispania Citerior between M. Porcius Cato (cos.) and P. 
Manlius (pr.)  with the as adiutor to the consul  when a fleet of 20 ships was also sent with the consul 
(Livy, 33.43.1-6; cf. 34.8.4-5) in 195. See further Vervaet (2012a), p.59f with n.56 for this and the notion of 
commanders sharing a prouincia impari imperio. 
 Richardson (2008), p.26-28 and Richardson (2011), p.3f. See Ch.III.iv for the hypothesis that the 
prouinciae might have been divided by the towns that paid taxes to Rome in contrast to those that originally 
paid taxes to Syracuse. 
 Thiel (1946), p.87, who merely adds the obvious alternative at the end of n.156: Though, of course, it 
remains possible that in 214-212 he resided at Lilybaeum for the protection of the western shores against 
surprise attacks from Carthage: numerous old ships were available there, put out of commission since 214. 
Cf. Thiel (1946), p.194, n.554; De Sanctis (1917), III.i, p.288, n.144; and Brunt (1971), p.653f. Livy reports 
III.vii. The use of the prouincia classis: the separation of functions in space  
Syracuse  the focus of the ancient sources  and this could also be taken to imply that he 
continued to operate with his fleet in western Sicily around Lilybaeum (i.e. in the 
prouincia uetus).
 Although this, like Thiels own suggestion, depends on an 
argumentum ex silentio, it is worth remembering that Otacilius had requested a second 
fleet for Sicily in 216 when the Carthaginians were focussing naval operations around both 
Syracuse and Lilybaeum and that the same division was again utilised a few years later in 
 It makes sense that two separate fleets were employed in Sicily, especially if we 
keep in mind the renewed activity by Carthaginian fleets around Sicily from 214/213 
onwards.
 Furthermore, when Otacilius returns to Livys narrative, probably around the 
end of the consular year 212, he is described as raiding Utica from Lilybaeum with 80 
quinqueremes, paucis ante diebus quam Syracusae caperentur...
 Otacilius reportedly 
sent the captured corn to Syracuse  which arguably is the only reason the raid is 
that Otacilius sailed to Sicily cum classe immediately following the launch of 100 new ships, but we do not 
know how many ships Otacilius actually left with nor how the ships were distributed in Sicily at the time 
(Livy, 24.11.6-7). It is tempting to equate these new ships with the 100 ships that Ap. Claudius is reported to 
have commanded off Murgantia and to propose that they replaced some of Otacilius older ships (Livy, 
24.27.4-5 and Polyb. 3.1.7). Yet, it is just as likely that some, if not all, of Otacilius old fleet of 75 ships was 
separately maintained (e.g. Livy, 22.37.13 as reported for 216). This is implied by Livy, if we take his 
statement literally that Otacilius was decreed, classis eadem quam aduersus Carthaginienses priore anno 
habuisset... (Livy, 24.10.5). For the uncertain location of Murgantia  to be distinguished from Murgentia 
(or Morgentina/Murgentina)  and a possible location near Leontini (modern Augusta near Syracuse) see 
Manni (1981), p.207. 
 It is notable that Lentulus, who had received the prouincia uetus, is not mentioned within the same period. 
 Livy, 22.56.6-8 (216 B.C.): aliae insuper ex Sicilia litterae allatae sunt ab T. Otacilio propraetore, 
regnum Hieronis classe Punica uastari; cui cum opem imploranti ferre uellent <praefecti ab se missi>, 
nuntiatum his esse aliam classem ad Aegates insulas stare paratam instructamque, ut, ubi se uersum ad 
tuendam Syracusanam oram Poeni sensissent, Lilybaeum extemplo prouinciamque aliam Romanam 
adgrederentur; itaque classe opus esse, si regem socium Siciliamque tueri uellent. Cf. Livy, 27.8.16-18 (209 
B.C.). 
 There were, after all, many routes between Africa and Cape Pachynus and Syracuse either along the south 
Sicilian coast or from Clupea (Aspis) in northern Africa via the island of Cossyra (Pantelleria), for which see 
Arnaud (2005), p.56f and p.160ff. For the fundamental strategic importance of Lilybaeum see e.g. Crouzet 
(2009), esp. p.120 and also esp. p.126-130 for the consideration of the Carthaginian perspective. Note also 
Rankov (1996), p.54f, who rightly highlights the strategic importance of controlling both Lilybaeum and 
Syracuse in order to prevent the Carthaginians having a suitable base from which to attack Italy. For 
Carthaginian naval activity see e.g. Livy, 24.27.7; 24.35.3-4; 24.36.3; and 25.25.11. See also generally Thiel 
(1946), p.79-86. Cf. Mnzer (1942), RE, XVIII, no.12 (T. Otacilius Crassus), col. 1863f: ...doch weit 
entfernt, einen solchen Zug zu wagen, war er nicht einmal imstande, die Kste des verbndeten 
Syrakusanischen Reiches vor karthagischen berfllen zu schtzen, weil er die der Provinz nicht unbewacht 
lassen konnte... 
 Livy, 25.31.12-15. I follow Lazenby (1998), p.115 for the date of 212 contra e.g. MRR I, p.274f, which 
dates the passage to 211.  
III.vii. The use of the prouincia classis: the separation of functions in space  
mentioned in Livys History  whereas he presumably remained at Lilybaeum with his 
plunder.
 As Otacilius most probably continued with his own fleet around Lilybaeum, his 
prouincia classis would have delineated his function in western Sicily, first from Lentulus 
and, second, from C. Sulpicius (pr.), who succeeded Lentulus in the prouincia Sicilia in 
The Senate followed a similar system of demarcation by naming Sicilia et classis 
as a consular prouincia, alongside the praetorian prouincia Sicilia, in 210.
 I earlier 
proposed that Sicilia and classis should be seen as two distinct parts of the consular 
prouincia, especially as they were separated by the conjunction et.
 As a result, although 
M. Valerius Laevinus (cos.) shared Sicilia with a praetor, he was the senior magistrate with 
superior consulare imperium (maius quam praetorium imperium) and did, in fact, give 
orders to the praetor.
 The classis element of the prouincia was not shared, however, so 
why was it necessary to demarcate the fleet when Laevinus already had the supreme 
command  especially given that the fleet was not specially separated for M. Claudius 
Marcellus (cos.) in 214? 
 The raid parallels what he did in 215 and he could, therefore, have performed a similar function 
throughout 214-212 (perhaps, less successfully). For the independent actions of Marcellus fleet around the 
same period off Pachynus see Livy, 25.27.9-11. 
 See Livy, 26.1.6-13: C. Sulpicio cui Sicilia euenerat duae legiones quas P. Cornelius habuisset decretae 
et supplementum de exercitu Cn. Fului, qui priore anno in Apulia foede caesus fugatusque erat.prorogatum 
et M. Marcello, ut pro consule in Sicilia reliqua belli perficeret eo exercitu quem haberet: si supplemento 
opus esset, suppleret de legionibus quibus P. Cornelius pro praetore in Sicilia praeesset, dum ne quem 
militem legeret ex eo numero quibus senatus missionem reditumque in patriam negasset ante belli finem...T. 
Otacilio et M. Valerio Siciliae Graeciaeque orae cum legionibus classibusque quibus praeerant decretae; 
quinquaginta Graecia cum legione una, centum Sicilia cum duabus legionibus habebat naues... As Livy 
suggests, Marcellus was specifically prorogued with his army within the context of finishing the war (and 
presumably settling the affairs there) for 211. It is notable that, after Marcellus departed Sicily, a 
Carthaginian fleet landed forces in eastern Sicily and, as a result, some towns  including Murgentia (i.e. 
Morgantina)  revolted (Livy, 26.21.13-17). 
 Livy, 26.28.3-4; 26.28.11; and 26.29.1-2. 
 See Ch.III.iii. Note especially that Laevinus consular prouincia was marked as being the fleet and 
prouincia Sicilia cum L. Cincio praetore (Livy, 26.28.3-4). For a consul and praetor sharing a prouincia see 
now Vervaet (2012a), p.60, n.56 (citing Livy, 27.35.10). 
 See e.g. Livy, 27.8.15-19 in which he divided Sicily (and the military forces) with the praetor for the 
protection of the island in 209. 
III.vii. The use of the prouincia classis: the separation of functions in space  
In this case, the Senates decision to name the fleet as part of the consular 
prouincia was probably pragmatic, even though we should not lose sight of the possibility 
of some fluidity in the arrangements made during this period. L. Cincius Alimentus (pr.), 
who had been allotted the prouincia Sicilia, could have legitimately taken command of the 
fleet when Laevinus was absent with his army (and without his permission), if it had not 
been named as a specific part of the consular lot.
 This may have been an attractive idea, 
since we have seen with the case of Otacilius that the fleet continued to offer opportunities 
to acquire glory (despite the fact that no naval triumphs were celebrated during the Second 
Punic War). It is worth recalling the disagreements which arose after L. Furius Purpurio 
(pr.) used the army of C. Aurelius Cotta (cos.) to defeat the Gauls in their shared prouincia 
Gallia prior to Cottas arrival in 200.
 One could argue that the designation of the classis 
as a specific part of Laevinus prouincia would have prevented Cincius from claiming his 
own glory with the fleet, since he would have been operating in aliena prouincia.
 It also 
meant that Laevinus could easily delegate the command of the fleet to one of his own 
legati  perhaps with delegated imperium pro praetore (i.e. the same grade as Cincius)  
without having to consider whether Cincius had his own plans for the fleet (and the 
problems that might have arisen from this).
 These considerations were especially 
important given that Laevinus was initially absent with his army around Syracuse and 
Agrigentum in eastern and central Sicily, whereas the fleet presumably remained at 
Lilybaeum in the west after the death of Otacilius towards the end of 211.
 For the use of ships by praetors in Sicily see e.g. Livy, 22.37.13 (217/216 B.C.) and Livy, 28.10.16 (206 
B.C.). 
 Livy, 31.21-22 with discussion Ch.III.v. 
 Cf. Ch.III.v. 
 It is not known whether Laevinus had already placed his senior consularis subordinate, M. Valerius 
Messalla, in charge of the fleet prior to his recall to Rome (Livy, 27.5.1), for which see further Ch.III.iii. Cf. 
Ch.IV.iv for the dispute that arose between a legatus sent by Cn. Pompeius Magnus to Crete and Q. 
Caecilius Metellus Creticus, the proconsul in command of the same island, in 67. 
 For Otacilius death see Livy, 26.23.2 and see generally Clark (1994), esp. p.138-140 for the distribution 
of military forces at this time. 
III.vii. The use of the prouincia classis: the separation of functions in space  
The same considerations also help to explain the continuation of the demarcation of 
the fleet during the period in which Laevinus was prorogued in Sicily  first alongside 
Cincius in 209 and, then, alongside praetors in 208 and 207.
 In 206, in contrast, the 
Senate instructed Laevinus to return to Rome with his fleet and to hand over 30 ships to C. 
Servilius Geminus (pr.), who had been allotted plain Sicilia in the praetorian sortitio.
Servilius was the only imperium-holder in Sicily at this time and could use the fleet exactly 
as he saw fit within the context of his prouincia Sicilia: in other words, the fleet was now a 
resource, like his army, to be used in prouincia rather than as a specific part of his 
prouincia per se.
Prima facie, there appears to have been yet another reversion to the system 
employed between 215 and 207 when the very same fleet appears in Livys description of 
the consular prouincia assigned to P. Cornelius Scipio in 205: 
prouinciae ita decretae: alteri consuli Sicilia et triginta rostratae naues quas C. 
Seruilius superiore anno habuisset; permissumque ut in Africam, si id e re publica 
esse censeret, traiceret; alteri Bruttii et bellum cum Hannibale, cum eo exercitu 
quem...
The re-appearance of the ships in the provincial designation may have been 
intended as a means of avoiding ambiguity over which commander had the charge of the 
fleet, since L. Aemilius Papus (pr.) was also allotted the prouincia Sicilia in succession to 
Servilius.
 However, in this particular instance, the mention of the ships is probably 
better related to the next clause of the assignment giving Scipio permission to cross into 
Africa.
 This was, after all, the ultimate aim and would have required the utilisation of 
 See Livy, 27.7.12 (209 B.C.); 27.22.9-10 (208 B.C.); and 27.36.11-13 (207 B.C.). See also Prag (2007b), 
p.291f for further references. 
 Livy, 28.10.9-16.  
 Cf. Thiel (1946), p.139, who imprecisely notes that, ...the danger now being past, the ships remaining on 
service were given to a praetor again, as had been usual till Otacilius death in 211.

 Cf. Ch.III.iii. 
III.vii. The use of the prouincia classis: the separation of functions in space  
the ships. Livys mention of the ships may, therefore, have concerned the allocation of 
military resources, rather than a specifically named prouincia classis;
 and it is even 
possible that he conflated the name of the prouincia with the senatorial decrees voting 
military forces.
 It should be noted that an exercitus is mentioned in the same context 
alongside the other consular prouincia and that an army was never named as an explicit 
part of a prouincia. Furthermore, Livy elsewhere mentions that Scipio was assigned Sicilia 
extra sortem.
 This may be indicative of the fact that the fleet was not actually an explicit 
part of the prouincia, even though it is most probably an abbreviation for the full scope of 
the command (e.g. note the absence of the permission to cross to Africa). If correct, the 
Senate probably did not think that it was necessary to demarcate the fleet as a prouincia, 
given that Scipio would eventually be the only imperium-holder operating in Africa (and 
had consulare imperium maius quam the praetors own praetorium imperium and a greater 
de facto power from his status as consul).
 This can be contrasted with the demarcation 
that took place when Cn. Cornelius Lentulus (cos.) was assigned the prouincia classis with 
(conditional) permission to cross into Africa from Sicily in order to command the fleet 
alongside Scipio in 201.
The pattern of the demarcation of a specific naval command appears to have 
continued, following Scipios crossing into Africa in 204, when two praetorian imperium-
 One clue that this was the case is provided by Livys notice of the prorogatio imperii for 204 in which the 
fleet and army appear in a similar sense: P. Scipioni cum eo exercitu, cum ea classe quam habebat, 
prorogatum in annum imperium est... (29.13.3). 
 This should be compared with the wording given for the prouincia allotted to Ti. Sempronius Longus 
(cos.) in 218 in Livy, 21.17.1-9 and esp. 1-2: Cornelio Hispania, Sempronio Africa cum Sicilia euenit. sex in 
eum annum decretae legiones et socium quantum ipsis uideretur et classis quanta parari posset. 
 Livy, 28.38.12. Note, in contrast, Livys descriptions of M. Valerius Laevinus consular prouincia in 210 
firstly as classis cui T. Otacilius praefuisset Siciliaque prouincia (26.28.3) and, then, still, Sicilia et classis 
(26.29.1). 
 In contrast to the arrangement in 210 mentioned in the previous note, Scipio brought ships with him and 
would have used them from the beginning with the aim of crossing to Africa in mind. 
 See Livy, 30.40.12-16 with discussion in Ch.III.ii.

only re-emerges, once again, in 192, when several imperium-holders were present in Sicily 
within the context of defensive measures taken in response to the impending war against 
Antiochus III: 
et ut M. Fuluius praetor classem nauium uiginti mitteret ad tuendam Siciliae oram; 
et ut cum imperio esset qui classem eam duceret  duxit L. Oppius Salinator, qui 
priore anno aedilis plebei fuerat  ; et ut idem praetor L. Valerio collegae scriberet 
periculum esse ne classis regis Antiochi ex Aetolia in Siciliam traiceret, itaque 
placere senatui ad eum exercitum quem haberet tumultuariorum militum ad 
duodecim milia et quadringentos equites scriberet, quibus oram maritimam 
prouinciae qua uergeret in Graeciam tueri posset.
Some scholars have suggested that M. Fulvius Centumalus (pr. urb.) delegated 
imperium to L. Oppius Salinator as a legatus cum imperio, yet it is more likely that he was 
ordered to secure a lex by which Oppius would be granted imperium as an extraordinary 
promagistrate.
 The order was made when both consuls were absent and so it is possible 
that the Senate asked the praetor urbanus to propose a motion to the people as the most 
senior magistrate available.
 Once again, the specific designation of the fleet would have 
separated the naval function of Oppius from the terrestrial command of L. Valerius Tappo 
(pr.), who had already been allotted Sicilia at the start of the year.

the naming of the fleet, in this case, was predominantly aimed at separating Lentulus from Scipio in Africa). 
It is notable that Sicily is not mentioned as part of Scipios prorogation in 203: P. Scipioni non temporis, sed 
rei gerendae fine, donec debellatum in Africa foret, prorogatum imperium est... (Livy, 30.1.10-11). For

possible precedent from 200 when the consul P. Aelius Paetus may have secured a lex de imperio for M. 
Valerius Laevinus, who is referred to as propraetor (Livy, 31.3.2-4), for which see further Ch.III.viii.

Further evidence for the use of the prouincia classis as a means of separating two 
magistrates is also to be found in the eastern assignments made at the beginning of the 
same year whereby A. Atilius Serranus (pr.) was allotted the classis et Macedonia.
naming of the fleet, in particular, seems to have facilitated a land and sea division with M. 
Baebius Tamphilus (pr.) for the defence of the allies against Nabis of Sparta. Baebius 
received the Bruttii as his praetorian prouincia, which almost certainly included an 
additional mandate to cross into Greece against Nabis of Sparta, as Livy explains: 
hi duo praetores et duo exercitus, terrestris naualisque, aduersus Nabim aperte iam 
oppugnantem socios populi Romani dicebantur parari...
In addition, Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus (cos.) was allotted Italia with the condition 
that he should be prepared, if necessary, to lead his legions extra Italiam quo senatus 
censuisset  i.e. in the event that war with Antiochus III was confirmed.
 The allocation 
of the prouincia classis, therefore, would have theoretically separated the naval command 
from the land commands of Baebius and Domitius in the event that he proceeded 
eastwards.
 As we have seen in the previous sections, two independent consular and 
ad Pachynum esset, altera a Pachyno Tyndareum; eam maritimam oram L. Valerius uiginti nauibus longis 
custodiret. eidem praetori mandatum, ut duas decumas frumenti exigeret; id ad mare comportandum 
deuehendumque in Graeciam curaret... (Livy, 36.2.10-12). As the fleet would have been included within the 
geographical area between Pachynus and Tyndareus (i.e. facing towards the Greek East) and the 
commanders would be separated by different geographical spheres, one can reasonably assume that the 
fleet was not named as a specific part of the prouincia per se. This more likely represents the separation of 
commanders in space rather than by function, which is discussed further in Ch.IV.ii. In any case, there is no 
evidence that Valerius was retained and so the fleet may have ended up simply as a resource to be used by 
Aemilius within his prouincia. Livy provides a clear indication that the fleet was viewed in this way rather 
than a specific part of a prouincia per se in 189: Siciliae legio una et classis, quae in ea prouincia erat... 
(37.50.9). See further the references in Prag (2007b), p.296f. 
 See Livy, 35.20.8-11. 
 Livy, 35.20.13-14. For the special instructions given to Baebius see Livy, 35.23.5-6: et ut M. Baebius ex 
Bruttiis ad Tarentum et Brundisium promoueret legiones decreuit, inde, si res posceret, in Macedoniam 
traiceret... Note also Livy, 35.24.7 and 36.1.7-8 for his eventual crossing in Macedoniam with Brennan 
(2000), p.203 and p.206f. For Atilius cf. Livy, 35.22.2-3: ...Atilius praetor cum classe missus in Graeciam 
est ad tuendos socios. 
 Livy, 35.20.1-8.  
 These arrangements can be contrasted with the new prouincia assigned to Cn. Sicinius (pr. per.) in 172 
after the Senate decided to postpone the war against Perseus ad nouos consules: hac classe et hoc exercitu 
Cn. Sicinius prouinciam Macedoniam obtinere, donec successor ueniret, iussus, prorogato in annum 
imperio... (Livy, 42.27.6). Sicinius would have been the only imperium-holder assigned to the operations in 
III.vii. The use of the prouincia classis: the separation of functions in space  
praetorian eastern prouinciae were subsequently demarcated by function with the naming 
of a prouincia classis throughout the war against Antiochus between 191 and 188.
same demarcation of a praetorian prouincia classis was also utilised again during the war 
against Perseus of Macedon between 171 and 168.
 This system enabled several praetors 
to celebrate their own naval triumphs from the same sphere as the consuls in 189, 188 and 
In summary, the prouincia classis appears to have been explicitly designated only 
when a fleet was to be deployed in the same space in which there would be more than one 
imperium-holder. This pattern provides confirmation that the naming of this prouincia 
served to separate magistrates or promagistrates by function within the same space. As 
argued in the previous section, this would have limited the potential for conflicts over 
which commander would undertake which tasks in the field and would have regulated the 
type of glory one might have been able to achieve (i.e. land or naval). As we have just seen 
in the case of Scipios prouincia from 205, however, the Senate would not necessarily 
have always favoured such a demarcation; and we should not assume that the separation of 
imperium-holders was the only consideration when a prouincia classis was named. The 
Macedonia and so this fleet was apparently not included as a named part of his prouincia with Macedonia 
(cf. Macedonia et classis in 192). Cf. also 42.18.2-4 and 42.36.8-9.

permission to cross into Asia) and L. Aemilius Regillus (pr. fleet) in 190); 37.50.1-8 (Cn. Manlius Vulso 
(cos. Asia) and Q. Fabius Labeo (pr. fleet) in 189). In the latter case, it should also be noted that M. Fulvius 
Nobilior (cos.) was also allotted Aetolia and employed ships against the Aetolians and island of Cephallenia, 
which was clearly separated from the operations in Asia further eastwards (Livy, 37.50.1-8; 38.8.1-3; 
38.30.1-2; and Zonar. 9.21.4). Manlius, Fabius and Fulvius were all prorogued into 188 (Livy, 38.35.3 and 
38.39.2-3). 
 Livy, 42.32.4-5; 42.36.5-6; 42.48.3-5 (P. Licinius Crassus (cos. Macedonia) and C. Lucretius Gallus (pr. 
fleet) in 171); 43.4.8-9; 43.5.1; 43.6.10; 43.6.14; 43.7.8-11; 43.8.5-10 (A. Hostilius Mancinus (cos. 
Macedonia) and L. Hortensius (pr. fleet) in 170, although note that the record of the elections and sortitiones 
are missing from book 43); 43.15.2-3; 43.11.8-12; 43.12.1-2 (Q. Marcius Philippus (cos. Macedonia) and C. 
Marcius Figulus (pr. fleet) in 169); 44.17.6-10; 44.21.3-5; and 44.30.1-3 (L. Aemilius Paullus (cos. 
Macedonia), Cn. Octavius (pr. fleet) and L. Anicius Gallus (pr. peregrinus and then Illyricum) in 168). 
 Ch.III.iv and III.vi. 
next section will, therefore, examine what other factors could have contributed to whether 
the fleet was named as a specific prouincia. 
III.viii. The combined land and sea command: the non-separation of functions in space  
III.viii. The combined land and sea command: the non-separation of functions in 
space 
Some notable exceptions to the pattern in which the prouincia classis separated the 
function of two or more imperium-holders, as outlined above, are to be found in Spain 
during the Second Punic War. First, P. Cornelius Scipio (cos.) was assigned the prouincia 
Hispania with both land and naval forces in 218 and there would have been no question of 
delineating functions:
 he was the consul sent against Hannibal and he would also be the 
only independent imperium-holder operating in Spain.
 The next year, however, he was 
prorogued in Spain and his brother, Cn. Cornelius Scipio, who had served as his legatus in 
218, was apparently granted his own independent imperium as an extraordinary 
promagistrate: the brothers subsequently commanded on an equal footing between 217 and 
211 with their land and naval forces, but without any formal separation of the 
commands.
 In this case, it would have been unlikely that the brothers would have 
clashed over the use of military forces, strategy or the competition for military glory and 
so the demarcation of the commands was probably considered to have been unnecessary 
(or, more likely, not even considered at all).
 Furthermore, we should not overlook the 
fact that it would sometimes have been advantageous for two magistrates (or 
promagistrates) to operate together with the same prouincia, since this would have enabled 
the commanders to combine their forces and undertake a joint military strategy (e.g. with 
two (pro)consular armies).
 Livy, 21.17.1-9. The same applies to the other consul, who was also allotted Africa cum Sicilia with both 
land and naval forces. 
 For the context see generally Richardson (1986), p.31-43. 
 I follow the conclusions reached by Vervaet and aco (2007), p.22f with n.3 on the position of the Scipio 
brothers between 217 and 211 here. For the fleet see e.g. Livy, 21.17.8 and Polyb. 3.41.2 (60 ships in 218); 
and Livy, 22.19.4 and Polyb. 3.95.5 (35 ships in 217) with further discussion in Thiel (1946), p.38-42. 
 It is worth noting their own division of their forces in 216: P. et Cn. Scipionibus inter se partitis copias ut 
Gnaeus terra, Publius nauibus rem gereret... (Livy, 23.26.2).  
 Note especially Polyb. 3.97 for the joint operations of P. Cornelius Scipio (pro cos.) and Cn. Cornelius 
Scipio (pro cos.) and their united strength in crossing of the Ebro in 217. Cf. Livy, 22.22.1-4, which reports 
III.viii. The combined land and sea command: the non-separation of functions in space  
Following the death of both proconsuls in the field, the Spanish command was 
assigned to a single imperium-holder, who departed Rome with both land and naval forces, 
in 211.
 It seems that the Senate had originally planned to send a single successor to this 
command the following year.
 However, it could not agree which individual should be 
appointed and so P. Cornelius Scipio was elected as the extraordinary promagistrate for 
Spain in the comitia centuriata  despite the fact that he was just 25 years old and had only 
just been an aedile in 213.
 It was probably only after this that the Senate decided to send 
M. Iunius Silanus (pr.) with him as adiutor, with his own independent imperium, in 210.
Once again, these commands were not separated either in space or by function. There are 
at least three good reasons why this would not have been appropriate. First, it is clear that 
Scipio had the supreme command and that he could (and did) call the shots regarding the 
allocation of tasks and resources in Spain.
 Second, it was only after the disapproval of 
Scipios election in the comitia centuriata that the Senate decided to appoint another 
commander, by which stage it could hardly have delineated specific functions  and 
separate the commanders  and, in the process, modify the comitial law which had 
the arrival of P. Cornelius Scipio and the fact he joined his forces with his brother. Cf. Livy, 25.3.3 (212 
B.C.) and 27.25.14 (208 B.C.). 
 MRR I, p.274, s.v. C. Claudius Nero with Livy, 26.17.1-3; and App. Hisp. 17. See further generally e.g. 
Thiel (1946), p.107f; Brennan (2000), p.155f; and Vervaet (2012a), p.47. 
 See Livy, 26.18, esp. 26.18.4: cum alii alium nominarent, postremum eo decursum est ut proconsuli 
creando in Hispaniam comitia haberentur... 
 For the date of his aedileship see MRR I, p.267, n.4 and for the context see generally Richardson (1986), 
p.45f. See also Brennan (2000), p.157 for his election in the comitia centuriata. 
 Livy, 26.18-19. The legal status of Silanus and his relationship with Scipio has been the subject of much 
scholarly debate, stemming from the fact that Livy first refers to Silanus as propraetor and adiutor 
(26.19.10), but later reports a speech from Scipio claiming that Silanus was sent, eodem iure eodem imperio 
mecum in prouinciam... (Livy, 28.28.14-15). See most recently Vervaet (2012a), p.50f, with n.11 for the 
modern literature, who argues that Silanus praetorium imperium was upgraded to consulare imperium (i.e. 
imperium pro consule).  
 This is clear from Livys notice from 206 that: haec in Hispania P. Scipionis ductu auspicioque gesta... 
(28.38.1). Note also that Scipio is reported to have sailed with the fleet from Rome (Livy, 26.19.11-12 and 
App. Hisp. 18). See further Vervaet (2012a), p.51f (Cf. Vervaet and aco (2007), p. p.23-26 and esp., p.25, 
n.6), who suggests that Silanus had been given equal command on the basis of Livy, 28.28.14 (eodem iure), 
but voluntarily conceded the summum imperium auspiciumque to Scipio. This possibly reads too much into 
the phrase and I would not rule out the distinct possibility that a decision had already been taken in Rome 
that Scipio would have the supreme command (perhaps, even within the context of Silanus re-assignment as 
adiutor) and that this is simply not explicitly recorded in Livys account. 
III.viii. The combined land and sea command: the non-separation of functions in space  
appointed Scipio.
 We should not assume that the Senate would have wanted to 
demarcate the commands in any case.
 Thirdly, the fleet was predominantly used in 
support of the army and there were few opportunities for warfare at sea after the Romans 
defeated a Carthaginian fleet near the Ebro in 217.
In short, there would have been no obvious advantage in formally demarcating the 
prouincia Hispania into two geographical or functional parts between 218 and 206.
Yet, there are at least two important questions which must still be considered. 
Firstly, could the use of a combined terrestrial and naval command have provided its own 
benefits which were not necessarily related to the separation of imperium-holders by 
function? And, secondly, what other factors might have influenced the decision to name  
or not to name  a prouincia classis? With these questions in mind, I shall focus on the use 
of a joint land and sea command under one imperium-holder during the wars against Philip 
V of Macedon (200-197) and Nabis of Sparta (196-194). These campaigns were, after all, 
roughly comparable in size, scope and geographical location with the eastern wars against 
Antiochus III (192-188) and Perseus of Macedon (171-168), in which a prouincia classis 
 Livy, 26.18-19 and App. Hisp. 18. See further Vervaet (2012a), p.48f for the Senates disapproval and 
subsequent decisions. Compare the division made in 201 when Cn. Cornelius Lentulus (cos.) was to 
command from the sea and Scipio the land, in Ch.III.ii. In this case, the Senate had originally determined the 
designation of Scipios prouincia (and subsequent prorogatio imperii) and so could presumably alter the 
arrangements as they saw fit without infringing on a vote of the people. For the last prorogatio imperii of 
201 see Livy, 30.41.1, although note that a plebiscitum was passed which confirmed that Scipio should lead 
the war in Africa in 202 (Livy, 30.27.1-5).  
 Richardson (1986), p.45 quite rightly suggests that the appointment of Silanus may have enabled the 
Senate to maintain some control over Scipios progress. 
 For the Roman dominance at sea see Livy, 22.20.1-4 and Polyb. 3.96.1-6 (from Ebro in 217); and Livy, 
27.17.6-7 and Polyb. 10.8.9 (control of the Spanish coasts in 210/209). It is notable that Scipio first ordered 
the fleet to be beached (Livy, 26.19.13) and only launched them for his attack on New Carthage by land and 
sea (Livy, 26.40-49), for which see further Thiel (1946), p.117-121. For the Roman victory near to the Ebro 
tipping the balance of naval supremacy in Spain in Romes favour see further Thiel (1946), p.49f. 
 It is also worth noting that the delineation of two prouinciae in Spain between 205 and 197 would not 
have been necessary with regard to separating the potential access to individual gloria: the refusal of Scipios 
triumph on the grounds that he did not hold a magistracy in 206 made it unlikely that a triumph would be 
granted to the extraordinary promagistrates in Spain prior to the sending of two praetors to Spain in 197, for 
which see further Ch.III.v. 
III.viii. The combined land and sea command: the non-separation of functions in space  
was frequently named. How, then, might the different uses of prouinciae, in these cases, be 
explained? 
The prospect of war with Philip V of Macedon was already foreseen towards the 
end of consular 201 and M. Valerius Laevinus (pro pr.) was accordingly sent into 
Macedonia with 38 ships, probably as an extraordinary promagistrate.
 The following 
year, Laevinus was succeeded by P. Sulpicius Galba (cos.), who had been allotted the 
prouincia Macedonia before war had been formally declared on Philip.
 Sulpicius took 
the personal decision to delegate the command of his fleet to his subordinates in order to 
focus on the land campaign, since an additional independent naval command had not been 
named:
 L. Apustius Fullo (leg.) commanded the fleet during the campaign in the Aegean 
with King Attalus I;
 and C. Claudius Centho (leg.?) was also sent with 20 ships and one 
 Livy, 31.3.2-4: decreuitque frequens senatus ut P. Aelius consul quem uideretur ei cum imperio mitteret 
qui, classe accepta quam ex Sicilia Cn. Octauius reduceret, in Macedoniam traiceret. M. Valerius Laeuinus 
propraetor missus circa Uibonem duodequadraginta nauibus ab Cn. Octauio acceptis in Macedoniam 
transmisit. It is not entirely clear whether the Senate intended that the consul P. Aelius Paetus should 
delegate imperium to Laevinus as his legatus pro praetore (so Thiel (1946), p.216f) or that he should 
propose a lex de imperio which would confer imperium on Laevinus as an extraordinary promagistrate (e.g. 
Brennan (2000), p.206; and p.646). It is worth noting that Aelius received Italia as his lot (Livy, 30.40.16) 
and his consulship (and command in northern Italy) would have been soon coming to an end around the time 
that Laevinus was appointed, which would have been far from ideal if Laevinus was to act as his subordinate. 
Cf. Livy, 31.7.4 in which the consul supposedly addresses the comitia centuriata: ne illud quidem dubium est 
quin hunc ipsum Philippum, pactum iam per legatos litterasque cum Hannibale ut in Italiam traiceret, misso 
cum classe Laeuino qui ultro ei bellum inferret, in Macedonia continuerimus [we = the people through a 
lex?]... Although some scholars considered the assignment of Laevinus to be a doublet of Laevinus 
expedition in 215, see the arguments supporting its historicity in Thiel (1946), p.219-223; Briscoe (1973), 
p.60; and especially Warrior (1996), p.52-60 with modern literature p.53, n.6. 
 Livy, 31.5.9 and 31.6.1-2. Cf. 31.8.6-7. For the declaration of war against Philip and the subsequent 
chronology see Warrior (1996), p.37-89. See also Rich (1976), p.25 and p.87f; and Pina Polo (2011), p.102f 
with references. 
 For his forces see Livy, 31.8.5-7 (legions) and Livy, 31.14.1-3 (fleet). For the ship numbers see generally 
Thiel (1946), p.212. 
 See Livy, 31.44.1-2; 31.45-47; Zonar. 9.15 (naval activities); and Livy, 31.27.8; 31.44.1; 31.46.1-3; 
31.47.3; and 32.16.5 (his status as legatus). Brennan (2000), p.208 discusses the possibility that Apustius 
was granted independent praetorium imperium by the populus Romanus, based on Zonaras description of 
him as      (Zonar. 9.15). It is true that Zonaras differentiated Claudius Centho 
(above) as  , as dissussed in the following note, and that he also has an independent 
reference to Sulpicius illness, which is not recorded in any other surviving source. However, as Thiel 
(1946), p.217 argued, it is possible  and, in my opinion, probable  that Apustius was delegated imperium 
pro praetore by Sulpicius and that he was officially a legatus pro praetore. The opportune moment in which 
he would have been delegated imperium may have even been when Sulpicius became ill: presumably, at this 
time, he sent Apustius in command of the land army in his place (with imperium) and this may even be the 
context of Zonar. 9.15 in which he is referred to as  . In support of this, the Senate directed 
Sulpicius to select (his own) ships from the fleet of the consul of 201, Cn. Cornelius Lentulus (Livy, 31.14.1-
III.viii. The combined land and sea command: the non-separation of functions in space  
thousand soldiers to Athens.
 P. Villius Tappulus (cos.) succeeded Sulpicius in 
Macedonia in 199 and, presumably, he too placed his own subordinate commander in 
charge of the fleet:
 Livy records that a certain Livius was in charge of the fleet in this 
year, but he does not give his official position and so, based on the system employed 
throughout this war, we can only assume that he was a legatus.
This system of entrusting one imperium-holder with a joint land and sea command 
with the designation of a prouincia Macedonia was most notably continued between 198 
and 194. The only difference during these years was that T. Quinctius Flamininus was 
prorogued for the duration of the campaigns against Philip V and Nabis, first, as consul, 
and, then, as proconsul, with his brother, L. Quinctius Flamininus, who commanded the 
fleet in the official capacity of his legatus.
 Livy refers to L. Flamininus as legatus on 
various occasions between 198 and 194, yet his official position is complicated by his 
description of him as the commander, cui classis cura maritimaeque orae imperium 
mandatum ab senatu erat...
 In addition, an inscription from Lampsacus describes how 
Lampsacene ambassadors met the Roman commander in charge of the fleet.
 This was 
almost certainly L. Flamininus, which has led some scholars to suggest that his imperium 
3). If Apustius had an independent command we could expect him to have selected his own ships, just as M. 
Valerius Laevinus (pro pr.) personally received his ships from the fleet of Cn. Octavius (pro pr.) in 201 
(Livy, 31.3.4-5). Cf. Livy, 37.2.10 (190 B.C.). 
 Livy, 31.14.3-4; 31.22.5-8; and 31.23.1-11. The official position of Claudius is not recorded by Livy, but 
he was almost certainly a legatus commanding a portion of Sulpicius fleet. Zonaras, 9.15 refers to him as  
 (an equivalent for the Latin legatus), for which see Mason (1974), p.96 and p.154 who notes 
that Dio (Zonaras source) uses this term for a number of subordinate positions.

 may be best interpreted as simply general/commander, with   
 denoting his charge, rather than his official titulature (of which the 
Lampsacenes may not have been aware).
 Given that there remains some confusion over 
the status of L. Flamininus in the modern literature, it is worth outlining the evidence for 
his position as legatus here.
As Thiel recognised long ago, it is more likely that Livy records only part of the 
procedure by which the Senate appointed L. Flamininus as a legatus attached to his brother 
with the specific task of commanding the fleet and with authority over the coastal 
regions:
 the Senate could have issued a vague mandate for the legatus (such as classis 
cura maritimaeque orae imperium), just as they had directly issued instructions to P. 
Valerius Flaccus (leg.) in 215 and told M. Valerius Laevinus (pro cos.) that he should send 
M. Valerius Messalla (leg.) or L. Cincius Alimentus (pro pr.) to raid Africa if he could not 
do so himself in 209.
 According to Plutarch, T. Flamininus asked the Senate for his 
brother to accompany him as a naval commander.
 One can very easily imagine that this 
request was made because the Senate was responsible for the appointment of legati, even if 
 E.g. Mommsen (1887), II, 234f, n.3; SIG
 591, p.116, n.5; I. Lamp. 4, p.30 s.v. 17; Schleussner (1978), 
p.112, n.42; Brennan (2000), p.208f; and p.644f. For his position as praetor urbanus see MRR I, p.327. For 
what it is worth, the prorogation of the imperium of the praetor urbanus was apparently quite rare, for which 
see Brennan (2000), p.158 with p.314, n.24. 
 Contra Brennan (2000), p.209, I do not think that this titulature should be accurate. It is true, as 
Brennan argues, that the Lampsacenes list Titus status as consul when he was pro consule (I. Lamp. 4, ll. 
68-70), but it does not have to follow that they would have got the status of a legatus right. Cf. Briscoe 
(1973), p.194 s.v. 2. Imperium: ...at xxxiii.17.2 he is called a legatus. The fact that he is called 
 in Syll.
 591 is indecisive: the Lampsacenes could have been mistaken. Compare also the 
reference to L. Apustius Fullo as      in Zonaras (9.15). For  see 
generally Mason (1974), p.155-158, esp. p.157.  
 E.g. Brennan (2000), p.208f is not clear on the issue: he suggests that his imperium was prorogued (p.209 
and p.644f) and elsewhere refers to L. Flamininus as a legate (p.210). 
 Thiel (1947), p.218, who proposes that he was appointed legatus pro praetore by Titus by order of the 
Senate and that Livy shortened this procedure (Livy, 32.16.2). Cf. Jashemski (1950), p.28.  
 Livy, 23.38.9-12 (215 B.C.) and 27.7.16.17 (209 B.C.) with discussion Ch.III.iii.   
 Plut. Flam. 3.3: ...           
... 
III.viii. The combined land and sea command: the non-separation of functions in space  
Plutarch does not reveal the official outcome.
 Furthermore, the imperium of T. 
Flamininus was prorogued, donec successor ex senatus consulto uenisset..., whereas L. 
Flamininus was instructed to command the same fleet in 197.
 There is no evidence that 
the latter represents a prorogation of imperium.
 Indeed, it would have been less 
cumbersome for the Senate to have appointed him as a legatus, since his command would 
automatically continue for as long as T. Flamininus had his own imperium.
 It is worth 
noting, also, that Livy gives this notice concerning L. Flamininus command immediately 
after he describes the extra reinforcements voted to his brother and within the context of 
military resources voted to various commanders for wars in Macedonia, Gaul and Spain.
Significantly, these reinforcements included three thousand socii nauales  clearly to be 
employed with the classis  which were assigned directly to T. Flamininus.
 If L. 
Flamininus had an independent command, one would expect that he would have received 
the socii nauales, just as L. Aemilius Regillus did as the praetor in charge of the fleet 
 For the appointment of legati see Schleussner (1978), p.172ff and p.185f (with Cic. Vat. 35 and Cic. Sest. 
33), who argues that the appointment was usually carried out by senatorial decree in 56, but that the Senate 
had the same authority prior to this (e.g. Polyb. 35.4.9). See also Willems (1885), II, p.609 with n.1; Keppie 
(1984), p.40; Linderski (1990a), p.54, n.4; and Johnston (2008), p.14. Cf. Livy, 32.28.12 (197 B.C.); Livy, 
35.6.5 (193 B.C.); and 36.1.8 (191 B.C.). For the consuls nominating their own legati during the Celtiberian 
War in 152/151 see especially Polyb. 35.4.5 (Suidas): ...     
... With this in mind, the explanation by Brennan (2000), p.208 that T. Flamininus was 
attempting to get his brother off the hook from allocating land to veterans in Italy (which had been marked 
out for his brother) is unneccessary and there is no evidence that Plutarch implied that the request of T. 
Flamininus was unusual, as he suggests. 
 Livy, 32.28.9-11: ...patres...T. Quinctio prorogarunt imperium donec successor ex senatus consulto 
uenisset. consulibus binae legiones decretae et ut bellum cum Gallis Cisalpinis qui defecissent a populo 
Romano gererent. Quinctio in Macedoniam supplementum decretum, sex milia peditum, trecenti equites, 
sociorum naualium milia tria. praeesse eidem cui praeerat classi L. Quinctius Flamininus iussus. 
praetoribus in Hispanias octona milia peditum socium ac nominis Latini data et quadringeni equites, ut 
dimitterent ueterem ex Hispaniis militem...  
 The language of Livy, 32.28.11 does not necessarily suggest prorogatio and can be compared with the 
instructions given to M. Valerius Laevinus in 209, as noted earlier (Livy, 27.7.16-17). Cf. Brennan (2000), 
p.335, n.194. 
 For the idea that it was standard practice for legati to continue with their commander see Willems (1885), 
II, 609. 
 Livy, 32.28.9-11. 
 This important point was recognised by Thiel (1946), p.218. 
III.viii. The combined land and sea command: the non-separation of functions in space  
against Antiochus III in 190.
 Arguably, the clearest indication that he was a legatus is to 
be found when T. Flamininus supported his brothers candidacy for the consulship in 193 
by saying that he was speaking, pro legato et participe administrandi belli: se terra, 
fratrem mari rem gessisse.
 With all of these considerations in mind, it should not be 
doubted that L. Flamininus was appointed as legatus, almost certainly ex senatus consulto, 
for the command of the fleet in support of his brother and consul.
The joint overall land and sea command which T. Flamininus exercised between 
198 and 194 and the delegation of the fleet to a subordinate legatus, therefore, represents a 
continuation of the arrangements made in 200 and 199. In all of these cases, there was only 
one holder of independent imperium present in the East. Unsurprisingly, then, in contrast 
to the cases which we examined in the previous section, there was no need to separate 
imperium-holders by function and so no reason to demarcate the fleet. Yet, returning to the 
questions posed earlier in this section, could there have been other factors which 
 Aemilius received the socii nauales directly from the M. Iunius Brutus, praetor urbanus of the previous 
year, and was instructed to enlist one thousand more socii nauales and two thousand pedites (Livy, 37.2.10). 
Cf. Livy, 31.3.4-5 (201 B.C.). 
 Livy, 35.10.8 with Briscoe (1981), p.159 who notes the displacement of legato in one manuscript. In 
addition, we should note that the wider context of Livy, 34.35.1-2 may also suggest that L. Flamininus was 
included among the legati...tribunique militum that T. Flamininus consulted with before drawing up the 
peace terms for Nabis of Sparta, given the description of those who were with him in 34.30.7: ...Quinctius 
cum fratre et Eumene rege et Sosila Rhodio et Aristaeno Achaeorum praetore tribunisque militum paucis 
descendit. After peace was concluded the named individuals were dismissed: huic laetitiae Quinctius 
superuenit pace data tyranno dimissisque ab Lacedaemone Eumene et Rhodiis et L. Quinctio fratre ad 
classem... (Livy, 34.40.7). 
 Note also that legati were sent to the Achaeans auctore consule by L. Flamininus, Attalus, the Rhodians 
and the Athenians rather than auctore L. Quinctio in 198 (Livy, 32.19.5). Furthermore, the inscription from 
Lampsacus refers to the Lampsacene ambassadors, including the individual being honoured (Hegesias), 
meeting with the quaestor in the fleet in I. Lamp. 4, ll. 37-38: [   |  ] 
    [... Although very little is known about the function of quaestors in the field at 
this time (or at Rome for that matter), I wonder whether this might be the quaestor attached to the consul (cf. 
Livy, 22.49.15-16 and Polyb. 6.12.7). If correct, T. Flamininus (cos. and then pro cos.) may have attached 
his quaestor to the fleet for the purpose of managing the supplies  a function which is explicitly referred to 
by Polybius (6.31.1)  and general communications. Hegesias, after all, received a letter from the quaestor to 
the people of Lampsacus (I. Lamp. 4, ll. 38-41) and it is even possible that the (unstated) content of this 
letter, which was clearly deemed useful and accordingly deposited in the public archives, originated with the 
consul. Cf. Livy, 30.38.1-3 (202 B.C.) for P. Cornelius Scipio ordering the quaestores to compile a list of all 
the public and private property in the ships in Africa. If this hypothesis is correct, it further supports the 
following ideas: i) T. Flamininus had overall command of the fleet (included within his prouincia 
Macedonia); and ii) L. Flamininus was a legatus, since a quaestor is highly unlikely to have been attached to 
a subordinate instead of the independent imperium-holder (cf. SIG
 591, n.9, which assumes the quaestor was 
attached to L. Flamininus (as praetor in charge of the fleet)).  
III.viii. The combined land and sea command: the non-separation of functions in space  
influenced the Senates decisions whether to give a single magistrate or promagistrate 
authority over land and naval forces instead of naming an additional prouincia classis?  
Thiel proposed that the assignment of both land and naval forces to a single 
imperium-holder enabled a greater co-operation between land and naval forces, which, he 
suggests, would have been especially important during the war with Philip V of 
Macedon.
 There is evidence for the successful co-operation between T. Flamininus (pro 
cos.) and L. Flamininus (leg.) and, earlier still, P. Cornelius Scipio (pro cos.) secretly made 
plans with C. Laelius (leg.), his good friend, to launch a co-ordinated land and sea attack 
on New Carthage in 209.
 However, there is a danger of overemphasising the 
significance of these cases, since the independent (pro)praetors allotted the prouincia 
classis during the wars against Antiochus III and Perseus of Macedon sometimes also co-
operated with the (pro)consuls, who, after all, had the supreme command.
 As Thiel 
rightly notes elsewhere, co-operation between two independent imperium-holders would 
have often depended on the personality of the commanders.
 All we can reasonably 
surmise, then, is that the combination of land and naval forces under one supreme 
commander probably provided a better guarantee that a co-ordinated strategy would be 
followed, especially if we take into account that a family member or friend was often 
placed in charge of the naval operations.
 Indeed, the independent imperium-holder 
 Thiel (1946), p.218, who also rightly notes that the naval commanders would have still had scope for 
independent action. See e.g. Livy, 31.23.1-3 for the action of C. Claudius Centho in 200. 
 See e.g. Livy, 34.29.1-14 (195 B.C.); Livy, 26.42.2-6 and Polyb. 10.12.1 (209 B.C.). Note also especially 
Thiel (1946), p.118: The action against New Carthage rested upon co-operation between army and navy, 
and apparently the plan for this combined attack had been carefully prepared and was put into practice 
punctually. 
 See e.g. the co-operation between Q. Marcius Philippus (cos.) and C. Marcius Figulus (pr.) in 169 (Livy, 
44.2.1-3); and L. Aemilius Paullus (cos.) and Cn. Octavius (pr.) in 168 (44.35.10-16). Note also that Cn. 
Octavius sent the captured King Perseus of Macedon to the consul in his flagship (Livy, 45.6.10-12). 
Compare the successful land and sea operations carried out by M. Claudius Marcellus (pro cos.) and Ap. 
Claudius Pulcher (pro pr.) against Syracuse in 213, for which see Polyb. 8.3-7 with Walbank (1967), p.69-78 
(cf. Livy, 24.33.9; 25.6.20-21; 25.29.5; and 25.41.1). 
 Thiel (1946), p.384f. 
 For brothers and friends serving as legati see Thomasson (1991), p.11 and Kunkel and Whittmann (1995), 
p.300, n.25. See e.g. the Scipio brothers in Spain in 218 (and then both pro consule 217-211); Scipio and 
III.viii. The combined land and sea command: the non-separation of functions in space  
would have received the credit for any glory that was won by his legatus.
 It was 
unlikely, therefore, that a legatus would have gone triumph-hunting for his own sake at the 
expense of a co-ordinated strategy. This was not the case for the independent praetorian 
naval commanders, who, as we have observed in the earlier sections, could win their own 
independent glory (which would have been one reason for the demarcation of the fleet). 
Thiel also proposed that the co-operation of the consul and the Senate in appointing 
legati guaranteed the selection of better qualified naval commanders than if they had 
relied on the smaller pool of annually elected magistrates (and, one might add to this, the 
potential lottery of the allotment of a classis sors).
 There is no denying that the use of 
legati would have given the Senate (and possibly the consul) a greater choice in 
appointment of a naval commander, but we should not underestimate the role played by 
family and friendship in the selection process.
 There is, in fact, no evidence that the 
selected legati were any more qualified as naval commanders than the praetors who were 
allotted the prouincia classis between 192 and 168:
 L. Flamininus, for instance, was 
arguably selected as a legatus solely on the basis that he was the brother of the consul 
rather than because he had any previous naval experience.
 It is, therefore, unlikely that 
Laelius in Spain between 210 and 206 (and later in Sicily and Africa between 205-202); and T. and L. 
Flamininus 198-194 in Greece/Macedonia. Note also that C. Lucretius Gallus (pr.), who had been allotted 
the prouincia classis in 171, sent his brother, M. Lucretius, ahead with one quinquereme to meet the fleet at 
Cephallenia and receive the allied ships (Livy, 42.48.6-10 and 42.56.1-6). For a later examples see e.g. Q. 
Tullius Cicero serving as a legatus under M. Tullius Cicero (pro cos.) in Cilicia in 51 (Cic. Fam. 15.4.8-20). 
 See e.g. Gordon (1983), p.90, no.14 (= ILLRP 342), as quoted in Ch.IV.ii.  
 Thiel (1946), p.218. 
 See the references for brothers and friends serving as legati, as noted earlier. 
 Cf. Gruen (1984), p.204-231, who questions the idea that the appointments of certain magistrates for the 
eastern wars were made based on eastern experience. Although Brennan (2000), p.336, n.203 is not 
convinced by Gruens theory, there is very little concrete evidence for Roman naval specialists at the 
senatorial level, including the legati. Cf. Redd (1986), p.465. One should imagine that naval specialists 
were employed under the overall command of a Roman official. See, for example, the record of various 
individuals with different roles in the fleet commanded by A. Terentius Varro (leg.) under L. Licinius 
Murena in Asia around 82 (IGRom I, 843). Cf. Plut. Luc. 3.8-10 for L. Licinius Lucullus (pro quaestore) 
operating on board a Rhodian ship commanded by a naval expert by the name of Damagoras a few years 
earlier around 85. 
 Plut. Flam. 3.3. 
III.viii. The combined land and sea command: the non-separation of functions in space  
the decision to entrust a single land and sea command to the consul between 200 and 198 
was influenced by the wish to appoint specialist (or simply better) naval commanders.
Brennan argues, from a different perspective, that the main reason that praetors 
were not sent to command the fleet alongside the consuls between 200 and 198 was 
administrative necessity and conservatism.
 He, observes, rightly, that only four 
praetors were annually elected until 198 (for 197) and that there were already extra 
demands placed on these magistrates by the problems in Italy in 200, which led to Gallia 
and Bruttii being named as praetorian sortes.
 This is equally applicable to the years 199 
and 198 when Ariminum and Gallia were included in the praetorian sortitio.
 Arguably, 
then, there was less room to name a classis sors during these years than there was when six 
praetors were annually elected from 198 onwards.
Nonetheless, it should be emphasised that there was nothing extraordinary about a 
consul being chosen to lead both land and naval forces, regardless of the number of 
praetors available.
 We have already seen above that P. Cornelius Scipio (cos.) was sent 
to Spain with both land and naval forces in 218. This had been standard practice during the 
previous war with Philip V of Macedon between 214 and 205, which may even have 
influenced the arrangements made when war was renewed in 201/200.
 Indeed, instead 
of asking why praetors were not sent between 200 and 194, as Brennan does, a more 
 Brennan (2000), p.209 appears partially to accept Thiel, but suggests that this does not entirely explain 
the Senates decision to implement and then maintain this unusual system.

 Ibid., with Livy, 31.6.2 for the praetorian sortitio of 200. 
 Livy, 32.2.1 and 32.8.5 with further references in MRR I, p.327 and p.330. 
 Cf. II.ii for a comparison with the praetorian naval preparations. 
 We should also note that there was nothing preventing the Senate from proroguing an imperium-holder 
elsewhere (e.g. in Sicily or Sardinia) in order to free a praetorian lot (as they did with the Hispaniae in 192) 
or from directing a senior magistrate to secure the election of an extraordinary promagistrate for the fleet (as 
in 201).  
 The imperium-holders in Macedonia/Greece between 214 and 205 were as follows: M. Valerius Laevinus 
(pro pr.) between 214 and 211 (Livy, 24.40.1-17; 24.44.5; 25.3.6; 26.1.12); P. Sulpicius Galba (cos. and then 
pro cos.) between 211 and 206 (26.22.1; 26.26.4; 26.28.9; 27.7.15; 27.22.10; 27.12.1-2); and P. Sempronius 
Tuditanus (pro cos.) in 205 (29.12.2-3). Cf. Polyb. 8.1.6. 
III.viii. The combined land and sea command: the non-separation of functions in space  
pertinent question to consider might be why the praetors were assigned independent naval 
commands between 192 and 168.
 One might even ask whether the experience of the 
single (pro)consular land and sea command between 200 and 194, in particular the 
command of T. Flamininus, could have influenced the Senates decision to name the 
classis as a praetorian lot during the war against Antiochus III (192-188).
One can speculate, for example, that the length and individualistic nature of T. 
Flamininus command might have led to some resentment among the competitive 
senatorial aristocracy.
 There was certainly strong impetus for annual changes of 
command, as demonstrated by the requests to replace T. Flamininus during his tenure in 
the East.
 This could well have been remembered later when the Senate annually 
changed the commanders during the wars against Antiochus III (192-188) and Perseus of 
Macedon (171-168).  
Furthermore, T. Flamininus may have explicitly claimed victory over both land and 
sea when he returned to Rome in 194, since L. Flamininus had operated under his 
imperium auspiciumque and could not triumph in his own right.
 We have seen that T. 
Flamininus recalled in 193 that his brother was, participe administrandi belli: se terra, 
fratrem mari rem gessisse.
 It is notable that the seniores of the Voturia tribe reportedly 
recommended M. Valerius Laevinus (pro pr.) for the consulship in absentia in 210 on the 
basis that he had conducted the war against Philip V with distinction terra marique 
 Brennan (2000), p.209, whose line of inquiry is undoubtedly influenced by his own subject matter. 
 I would like to thank Professor J.-L. Ferrary for bringing this valuable consideration to my attention. 
 For what it is worth, note the apparent rivalry between the Cornelii (supporting P. Cornelius Scipio 
Nasica) and Flaminini (supporting L. Quinctius Flamininus) for the consulship in 192 (Livy, 35.10.1-12). 
 The former point was emphasised by Thiel (1946), p.219 with Livy, 32.28.3-9; 33.25.4-11; and 34.43.3-8. 
For aristocratic competition during this period cf. Ch.III.v. 
 There is nothing in Livys record of his triumph that is suggestive of a naval element and whilst the 
exercitus is mentioned, the absence of socii nauales is notable (Livy, 34.52.1-12). Cf. Plut. Flam. 14 and 
Eutr. 4.2. 
 Livy, 35.10.8-9.  
III.viii. The combined land and sea command: the non-separation of functions in space  
between 214 and 211.
 Livy also refers to the actions undertaken later by P. Sulpicius 
Galba and his legatus against Philip V terra marique in 200.
 Whilst there is a danger 
here that Livys use of the phrase is anachronistic, we can reasonably assume that the 
Romans would have been aware of the concept of bellum terra marique in the early second 
century, especially given the Hellenistic precedents.
 If correct, it is not beyond the 
realms of possibility that the dignitas and gloria that T. Flamininus was able to claim for 
success in the East on both land and sea would have been met with disapproval in some 
quarters of the Senate. We shall see in the next chapter that the monopolisation of glory 
terra marique by a single Roman individual was a product of the first century, which 
developed alongside the Roman conceptualisation of world empire.
 However, one can 
speculate that T. Flamininus may have foreshadowed this development by over one 
hundred years  though presumably on a lesser scale  especially if we keep in mind his 
exploitation of much of the royal Hellenistic self promotion when he was in the Greek 
East. It is possible that this (or at least the less specific glory he was able to acquire from 
his joint land and sea command) led to some senators favouring the division of a land and 
sea command between two commanders and the separation of two types of glory between 
192 and 188.  
 Livy, 26.22.12-13. On this episode see generally Taylor (1966), p.93f. Cf. Livy, 26.28.1-3 in which 
Laevinus apparently outlined his deeds terra marique in the East between 214 and 211 to the curia after he 
had become consul. 
 Livy, 31.47.3: haec ea aestate terra marique aduersus Philippum sociosque eius ab consule et legato 
Romanis adiuuantibus rege Attalo et Rhodiis gesta. Compare also the use of similar language by Livy to 
refer to the (Syracusan) enemies overcome terra marique by M. Claudius Marcellus between 214 and 211 
(Livy, 25.41.1-2); the peace which P. Cornelius Scipio (pro cos.) acquired terra marique after his defeat of 
the Carthaginians in 201 (Livy, 30.45.1-2); and the conquest of the Illyrians by L. Anicius Gallus (pr.) terra 
marique in 169 (45.43.5). Cf. Livy, 21.49.1; 21.6.6 (consuls waging war terra marique); 23.48.6 (forces 
terra marique); 22.18.1 (war in Spain terra marique); 28.23.8; 29.22.1-2 (Scipios plan to fight terra 
marique in Africa); 32.21.18; 32.25.12 (campaigning against Macedonia terra marique); and 44.18.1-3 (L. 
Aemilius Paullus taking responsibility terra marique in war with Perseus of Macedon) etc. 
 For the Hellenistic precedents see especially the classic discussion by Momigliano (1942). The later use 
of the idea of victory over land and sea by Roman individuals is explored further in Ch.IV.v. 
 Ch.IV.v. 
III.viii. The combined land and sea command: the non-separation of functions in space  
As we have seen, the naming of the fleet as a prouincia enabled more magistrates 
to take part in a campaign against a single enemy with the potential to achieve their own 
independent success. This would have been especially relevant during a period in which 
the number of triumphs peaked and in which there was a dramatic increase in the number 
of non-consuls celebrating triumphs.
 As a result, the seemingly fierce triumphal 
competition and the belief that a triumph would have been a realistic ambition for a praetor 
(as proved to be the case) could well have led to some demands for the naming of an 
eastern praetorian prouincia, in addition to the consular prouincia. In this respect, the 
naming of a prouincia classis may have been a deliberate ploy to increase the 
opportunities for praetors to triumph, especially given the opportunities for military 
success in Spain during the same period. This, alongside the annual changes in command, 
would also have limited the extent to which one individual or family (e.g. the Flaminini) 
might steal all of the limelight. The arrangement may have been influenced by T. 
Flamininus command terra marique.  
We have seen in this last section that, aside from the expediency of separating 
imperium-holders either in space or by function within the same space, other factors could 
also have contributed to the Senates decision whether or not to demarcate prouinciae. 
These can be summarised as follows: 
I) It would have sometimes been advantageous for two magistrates (or 
promagistrates) to combine their forces and undertake a joint strategy with greater military 
strength than if they had operated independently. 
II) It is reasonable to assume that it would not ordinarily have been necessary to 
separate two (or more) imperium-holders either if they were (close) family members who 
 Rich (1993), p.49-51. Cf. Richardson (1975), p.52-54. 
III.viii. The combined land and sea command: the non-separation of functions in space  
were, in any case, likely to have co-operated, or if one imperium-holder had been given the 
supreme command (i.e. the summum imperium auspiciumque).  
III) In the event that a prouincia had been assigned to a promagistrate by the 
people, I suggested that it was likely that the Senate would not (or rather could not) have 
interfered with that decision by demarcating the command.  
IV) The assignment of a single land and sea command under one commander could 
have guaranteed better co-operation between the land and the naval forces given that the 
latter were often assigned to a subordinate legatus. However, the extent to which this 
would have been a major consideration when the Senate named the prouinciae each year is 
uncertain, since independent imperium-holders could also co-operate  especially if they 
commanded impari imperio.  
V) The availability of imperium-holders  or what Brennan calls administrative 
necessity  would have been one consideration when the Senate decided whether to 
demarcate two named prouinciae within the same space (or for a particular war) or 
whether to name just one prouincia.  
VI) However, as a single consular land and sea command was not extraordinary  
and, as suggested above, could even be advantageous  administrative necessity would 
not have always been the decisive consideration concerning whether to name an additional 
independent naval command. Instead, the Senate may have actually favoured demarcating 
prouinciae in order to allow more imperium-holders to achieve their own military success 
and, at the same time, to limit the monopolisation of glory by one individual (e.g. T. 
Flamininus) or one family (e.g. the Flaminini). 
We might conclude, then, that the prouincia classis was named in order to separate 
magistrates by function in space, but that this came after the initial decision had been taken 
to send two (or more) independent imperium-holders to the same space with the above 
factors in mind.
III.ix. Conclusions   
III.ix. Conclusions 
Returning now to the basic notions of the prouincia with which this chapter began, we 
have observed the dangers of viewing the concept of the prouincia too rigidly in terms of 
either a task or a geographical space (III.i). A prouincia could be designated as a task and a 
geographical space simultaneously. Indeed, the prouincia classis was ordinarily defined in 
terms of the geographical area within which the commander assigned this prouincia was 
authorised to operate by means of an additional designation and, more often, senatorial 
instructions (III.ii-iii). Thus, the debates concerning the development of the concept of the 
prouincia do not necessarily need to be approached in terms of whether a particular 
prouincia with a geographical name was a task rather than a geographical and vice versa  
questions I posed at the start of this chapter in relation to the naming of Etruria and 
Samnium in the fourth century.  
The practical use of the prouincia classis clearly illustrates that a prouincia could 
serve other purposes, which transcended both purely functional and geographical 
definitions. We have seen that prouinciae were defined in terms of enabling and limiting 
the activities of magistrates and promagistrates vis--vis spaces and functions (III.vii-viii). 
One fundamental rationale behind defining prouinciae in this way was to separate 
independent imperium-holders either in space or by function within the same space, 
thereby limiting potential conflicts over command and triumphal rights. I discussed how 
the demarcation of prouinciae served to separate the claims of different imperium-holders 
to glory and provided each commander with the opportunity to win his own triumph, 
assuming that there was any military glory to be won (III.iv). With this in mind, I argued 
also that the delineation of the prouincia classis was inherently connected with the distinct 
triumphus naualis (III.vi). The practice of separating prouinciae for these reasons most 
III.ix. Conclusions   
probably stemmed from the Senates negative experiences of joint commands and shared 
prouinciae (III.v).  
It follows, therefore, that a prouincia could have been geographically and 
functionally defined as loosely or precisely as deemed necessary by the Senate in order to 
separate imperium-holders (and to make sure that particular tasks were carried out). This 
has broader implications for our understanding of how and why prouinciae were 
territorially demarcated during the Republic, especially as the divisions would have 
become ever more frequently necessary over time as the Roman Empire expanded and 
more imperium-holders were sent to regions outside of Italy (many of which would have 
neighboured those allocated to other imperium-holders).  
The next chapter will explore how and why prouinciae that encompassed the use of 
fleets were defined between 167 and 49  i.e. a period in which the number and 
geographical extent of annually named prouinciae increased vastly. What, if anything, 
changed? 
IV.i. Introduction: the demise of the prouincia classis   
Chapter IV: The prouincia and the ora maritima 
IV.i. Introduction: the demise of the prouincia classis 
The last evidence for a prouincia classis for at least a further one hundred years is to be 
found at the start of the Third Punic War in 149. Appian records that both consuls were 
sent against the Carthaginians with divided functions: M. Manilius was in charge of the 
land force, whereas L. Marcius Censorinus was in command of the fleet;
 and both 
Appian and Zonaras describe the separate attacks on Carthage from the land side 
(Manilius) and the sea side (Marcius).
 Although Appian does not name the consular 
prouinciae, Africa would have almost certainly been included as part of both 
designations.
 He explicitly describes Africa as one of the consular lots two years later 
with a clear hint that the competition between the consuls for this prouincia was fierce, 
since a tribune of the plebs intervened to allow the people to decide which consul was to 
have this prouincia.
 With this competition in mind, the classis may well have been 
named as part of one consular prouincia, alongside Africa, in 149. This would have 
enabled both consuls to take part in the campaign with separated functions, just as the fleet 
was specifically named to demarcate Cn. Cornelius Lentulus (cos.) from P. Cornelius 
 App. Pun. 75:      ,      
,       ,       
    . For an overview of Appians sources see Walbank (1979), 
p.655f s.v. 3.1-6.6, who notes that this probably goes indirectly back to Polybius. Indeed, it is worth 
comparing Appians description with the divisions of land and sea commands described by Polybius for the 
First Punic War and the First Illyrian War (e.g. Polyb. 1.21-22 and 2.11.1-2), for which see Ch.I.iv and 
Ch.III.ii.  
 App. Pun. 97 and Zonar. 9.26. Cf. Polyb. 36.3.9; Livy, Per. 49; and Eutr. 4.10. 
 Note especially the references to Africa in Livy, Per. 48-49.   
 App. Pun. 112:        ,     
      ,      
             . Livy also 
described this and may have been one of Appians sources, for which see Livy, Per. 51: [Scipio] cui extra 
sortem Africa prouincia data erat. For the historical context and the remarkable rise of P. Cornelius Scipio 
Aemilianus see generally Astin (1967), p.61-69, esp. p.67f with further references. Cf. Livy, 30.27.1-4 for a 
vote of the people on who should continue the war in Africa in 202.  
IV.i. Introduction: the demise of the prouincia classis   
Scipio (pro cos.) in Africa in 201.
 If correct, this is the final example of the prouincia 
classis being used to separate two magistrates by function such as we have seen in the 
previous chapters.  
Although the demise of the prouincia classis may be explained, in part, as being a 
result of the lack of surviving evidence following the loss of Livys History (167) and the 
conclusion of Polybius History (145), it was most probably predominantly related to the 
nature of the subsequent warfare, Roman hegemony in the Mediterranean and the fact that 
Rome was no longer challenged by a strong naval power.
 Subsequently, there was much 
less need for combined land and sea forces on a large scale. Even for the remainder of the 
Third Punic War between 148 and 146, one of the two consuls took supreme charge of 
both land and naval forces and delegated command of the fleet to subordinate legati.
we have seen in the previous chapter, this system was used earlier during the wars against 
Philip V of Macedon (200-197) and Nabis of Sparta (196-194).
 As far as we can tell 
from the surviving evidence, this was the exclusive way fleets were treated from 148 until 
Sextus Pompeius was assigned an extraordinary prouincia classis et ora maritima in 43 
(which I shall return to in the Epilogue). 
This development raises a number of important questions relating to the 
conclusions reached in the preceding chapters. What factors influenced the ways in which 
prouinciae were defined in the late second and early first centuries? Was the separation of 
imperium-holders either in space or by function still a guiding principle? What, if anything 
changed? And, what can the answers to these questions tell us about how the

recognised long ago by Willems (1885), II, p.535, n.2. Cf. Le Bohec (2011), p.439. 
 Note, for example, that the end of the war with Andriscus in 148 is the starting point for Kallet-Marx 
(1995) and compare Gruen (1984). See also further Ch.II.iv and especially Redd (1986), p.458-463.

Mediterranean and the Roman Empire  in particular the sea and the coastal regions  were 
conceptualised? This chapter will seek to address these questions and develop the issues 
raised in the previous chapters further by examining the major naval commands of the late 
second and first centuries. It will do this in four sections.  
The first section after this introduction will explore the evidence for the prouincia 
assigned to M. Antonius around 103/102 (IV.ii). This will establish how a command 
against a piratical enemy with naval capabilities, based around the southern coast of 
modern Turkey, could have been envisioned and defined in the Late Republic. The second 
section will build on this by considering whether there was a growing tendency to 
circumscribe the activities of commanders in the late second century (IV.iii). In particular, 
it will analyse the purpose and political significance of the Lex Porcia as a means of 
restricting the movements of magistrates and promagistrates (and their legati) outside of 
their prouinciae. The third section will then examine how the Mediterranean-wide 
prouinciae assigned to M. Antonius Creticus and Cn. Pompeius Magnus were defined in 
75/74 and 67 (IV.iv). In doing so, it will consider the political implications associated with 
the assignment of such far-reaching prouinciae. The final section will use these prouinciae 
to assess the development of the Romans conceptualisation of their empire between the 
third and first centuries (IV.v).  
The underlying question throughout all of these parts will be what, if anything, 
changed in the definition of prouinciae between the third and first centuries. The naval 
commands mentioned above will provide the material through which this question can be 
assessed. 
IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the second century   
IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the 
second century 
The first evidence we have for the prouincia of an independent naval commander after 149 
is to be found towards the end of the second century, when M. Antonius (pr.) proceeded 
into Cilicia with a fleet against the pirates.
 However, the evidence for this command is 
fragmentary and so there are a number of difficulties in interpreting both its date and 
geographical scope.  
Starting with the chronological context, Antonius overall victory against the 
pirates can be firmly dated to 102, given that Julius Obsequens  drawing on the Livian 
tradition  places it under the consuls of that year, C. Marius and Q. Lutatius Catulus, and 
directly before the formers victory over the Teutoni.
 In addition, the campaign of 
Antonius and the defeat of the Teutoni are also mentioned in the Periochae just before 
Marius extraordinary election to a fifth consulship in absentia for 101.
 Although the 
Periochae refer to Antonius as praetor in 102, there is a distinct possibility that he was 
already a promagistrate at this point and held his magistracy in the previous year or (less 
likely) even earlier (104?).
 Ciceros De Oratore and an inscription from Corinth also 
 Q. Caecilius Metellus Baliaricus (cos. 123) used ships in his campaign against the Balearic Islands and 
triumphed as proconsul de Baliarib(us) in 121 (Flor. 1.43 and Inscr. Ital. XIII, I, p.82f), but there is no real 
indication how his prouincia was defined. Cf. Richardson (1986), p.157 and App. III, p.192 and de Souza 
(1999), p.92-96. For the general context regarding Cilician piracy see also de Souza (1999), p.97-101. 
 Obseq. 44: C. MARIO Q. LUTATIO COSS...Piratae in Cilicia a Romanis deleti. Teutoni a Mario trucidati. 
This date was recognised by Ferrary (1977), p.624 with n.23 (cf. Ferrary (2008b), p.106 with n.14). For 
references to the consulship of Marius and Lutatius see further MRR I, p.567. 
 Livy, Per. 68: M. Antonius praetor in Ciliciam maritimos praedones persecutus est. C. Marius consul 
summa ui oppugnata a Teutonis et Ambronibus castra defendit. Duobus deinde proeliis circa Aquas Sextias 
eosdem hostes deleuit, in quibus caesa traduntur hostium milia, capta nonaginta. Marius absens quinto 
consul creatus est. The Periochae refer to Marius second (104), third (103) and fourth (102) consulships 
under book 67 and so book 68 presumably continued with the campaigns for 102 (cf. e.g. Livy, 38.1).  
 It is worth stressing that the literary sources, especially the authors of the Late Republic, use praetor even 
for prorogued praetors, for which see the classic study by Giovannini (1983), p.59-65, esp. p.63 (mentioning 
M. Antonius). This is equally applicable to Livys Periochae. For example, Livy, Per. 70 refers to C. Sentius 
as praetor in Macedonia in 92 (dated by the condemnation of P. Rutilius) when he seems to have held his 
magistracy in 94, for which see the treaty between Rome and the Thyrrienses recorded in SIG
 732, ll. 4-5 in 
which he is described as praetor urbanus (dated by the consuls of 94). Likewise, both M. Licinius Crassus 
IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the second century   
describe Antonius as proceeding eastwards pro consule, which has led some scholars to 
suppose that he must have first been praetor in Rome and only prorogued pro consule the 
next year.
 Yet, it was long ago recognised that a praetor could depart Rome with 
imperium pro consule (i.e. as a praetor with upgraded consulare imperium), as the praetors 
sent to Spain did from 197.
 Antonius could, therefore, have departed for his prouincia 
during his praetorship  most probably in either 103 or 102  as praetor pro consule; or, 
alternatively, as a prorogued praetor (pro praetore pro consule?) in either 103 or 102, 
depending if he was praetor in 104 or 103.
 All we can be certain of is that his decisive 
victory took place in 102. With this in mind, it is likely that he returned to Rome to 
celebrate a triumph not too long after this and certainly by 100.
and M. Antonius Creticus are referred to as praetors under the year 71 when they were promagistrates and 
held their actual magistracies a few years earlier (Livy, Per. 97), for which see Ch.IV.iv. 
 Cic. De or. 1.82 and ILLRP 342. Cf. IGRom. IV, 1116 (Rhodes, statue base): []  
 |[]. In the modern scholarship MRR I, p.569, n.2 and Drogula (2011), p.106, n.58 
suggest he was praetor in 102 and then departed pro consule in 101; Kallet-Marx (1995), p.229, n.27 and de 
Souza (1999), p.103f argue that he was praetor in Rome in 103 before leaving pro consule for his prouincia 
the following year.  
 E.g. Mommsen (1887), II, 647; Taylor and West (1928), p.18; Jashemski (1950), p.40ff; Ferrary (1977), 
p.625; Giovannini (1983), p.63f; MRR III, p.18 (abandoning his earlier view suggested in MRR I); Brennan 
(2000), p.357; and Vervaet (2012a), p.66f. Cf. Kallet-Marx (1995), Appendix A, p.343-345. For the practice 
of dispatching praetors with consulare imperium see now especially Vervaet (2012a). 
 Ferrary (1977), p.625 and Brennan (2000), p.357 rightly highlight that Cicero states that he set out pro 
consule, but opt for the year 102. However, the possibility that Antonius left as a praetor pro consule in 103 
has generally been neglected in the modern scholarship. For an insightful recent discussion of the titles of 
praetor, praetor pro consule and pro consule see Vervaet (2012a), p.65-72 with modern literature and 
epigraphic attestations and also Hurlet (2012), esp. p.98-101. 
 On the date see now Ferrary (2008b), p.106 with n.14. An inscription from Samothrace records several 
praefecti (including Ciceros uncle), who were serving under M. Antonius, on their way home from Cilicia 
on 4 September, 100, for which see now Clinton (2001). Cicero also mentions that Antonius was extra 
urbem cum praesidio during the disturbances that famously led to the death of L. Appuleius Saturninus (tr. 
pl.) in December 100 (Rab. Perd. 26), which is often cited as evidence that he was waiting outside to triumph 
at the time: e.g. Broughton (1946a), p.36f; MRR I, p.569, n.2 (and MRR III, p.18); Brunt (1971), p.431; de 
Souza (1999), p.103 (with caution); and Drogula (2011), p.106 with n.58. This is very plausible (and would 
fit the chronology of a slow journey back from the East around September 100), especially bearing in mind 
the comparative evidence from 49 in which the so-called senatus consultum ultimum specifically refers to 
enlisting the help of those who were pro consulibus (as Antonius would have been if he was waiting for a 
triumph extra urbem): ...dent operam consules, praetores, tribuni plebis, quique <pro> consulibus sunt ad 
urbem, nequid res publica detrimenti capiat... (Caes. B Ciu. 1.5.3-4 and cf. Cic. Fam. 16.11.2-3). However, 
this does not prove that the decree was worded in the same way in 100. Ferrary (1977), p.626 is right to 
emphasise that Cicero does not explicitly write that Antonius was waiting for a triumph and so this can still 
only be assumed. Unfortunately, the relevant section of the Fasti Triumphales are missing and the date of the 
triumph must remain uncertain (cf. Plut. Pomp. 24.6). 
IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the second century   
The surviving evidence for the name of Antonius prouincia is equally elusive, and 
has led scholars to argue for three distinct possibilities:
 i) a special naval command;
ii) Asia;
 and iii) Cilicia.
 Regarding the first suggestion, it is improbable that Antonius 
received a special maritime command against the pirates without a land-based definition, 
given that naval commands were usually defined in geographical terms.
 Even the later 
commands of M. Antonius Creticus (75/74) and Cn. Pompeius Magnus (67) against the 
pirates had geographical definitions, which will be explored in the following sections. 
Furthermore, we have also already seen that a specific prouincia classis was employed in 
the late third and second centuries only when a magistrate or promagistrate was to operate 
within the same geographical area  usually defined together with the fleet  as another 
imperium-holder.
 Thus, a fourth possibility emerges: the fleet could have been specified 
as Antonius prouincia, together with Asia, in order to separate his naval function from the 
role of the magistrate (or promagistrate) who received the prouincia Asia.
 Yet, this is 
also unlikely, given that the evidence suggests that Antonius proceeded directly to Cilicia 
 We do not have any information on whether he received his prouincia in the praetorian sortitio, ex 
senatus consulto, or by a special lex (or even a combination of these possibilities). 
 Syme (1939b), p.299 first viewed it as a maritime command that usurped at once the title of Cilicia, 
which was followed by Magie (1950), p.283 and p.1161-1163. Syme insightfully took the uncertain 
reference to Cilicia in the Delphi copy of the law on the eastern prouinciae (RS, no.12, Delphi Copy, Block 
B, l.7-8) as the naming of a prouincia Cilicia around 100, which was only confirmed with the publication of 
the Cnidos copy in 1974. Magie (1950), p.1162 did not notice this or, more likely, did not wish to speculate 
on the fragmentary line referring to Cilicia: Moreover, in the law dealing with piracy which was passed in 
101 or 100 B.C...there is no real evidence of a province called Cilicia... Cf. Badian (1964), p.161. 
 Drogula (2011), p.106-113. 
 Ferrary (1977), p.625 and p.637-643, which should now be consulted with Ferrary (2008b), p.107f for a 
more recent assessment in the light of new evidence and publications. See also Crawford (1990), p.106; de 
Souza (1999), p.104; Ferrary (2000b), p.168; and Ferrary (2008a), p.13. 
 To be fair, Magie (1950), p.1163 dismisses the idea of a clear land-based definition rather than a looser 
named sphere: While it is not improbable that Antonius, for the purposes of his campaign in eastern waters, 
was officially designated as pro consule in Ciliciam missus, there is no reason for believing that his 
imperium consisted of more than the command of the fleet against the pirates. 
 Ch.III.vii. 
 For a discussion of the known governors of Asia between 126 and 88 see Ferrary (2000b) and esp. p.175-
179 for the hypothesis that C. Julius Caesar, father of the dictator, was proconsul in Asia in 102 when 
Antonius was in Cilicia. 
IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the second century   
 a considerable distance from the administrative centres of Ephesus and Pergamum on the 
west coast of Asia  and that all his activities were in Cilicia rather than Asia.
Drogula recently provided an important warning that one should not take Cilicia as 
the prouincia just because Antonius was famous for fighting pirates there.
 However, the 
evidence he cites in support of his alternative explanation (ii), that Antonius had a 
prouincia Asia from which he operated in Cilicia, is not convincing.
 In a similar way, 
Sherwin-White attempted a compromise (between suggestions ii and iii) by proposing that 
Antonius had Asia as his territorial base, whereas Cilicia was his commission or zone of 
operations.
 Comparative evidence for this hypothesis is to be found in the prouincia 
Africa cum Sicilia which was allotted to Ti. Sempronius Longus (cos.) in 218 for the 
 Cic. De or. 1.82: Namque egomet [Antonius]...tamen cum pro consule in Ciliciam proficiscens uenissem 
Athenas, compluris tum ibi dies sum propter nauigandi difficultatem commoratus... See also Cic. De or. 2.2 
(et patruus, qui cum Antonio in Ciliciam profectus una decesserat); Livy, Per. 68 (M. Antonius praetor in 
Ciliciam maritimos praedones persecutus est); Obseq. 44 (Piratae in Cilicia a Romanis deleti); Trogus, 
Prolog. 39 (Ut Syriam Iudaei et Arabes terrestribus lactrociniis infestarint, mari Cilices piraticum bellum 
mouerint, quod in Cilicia Romani per Marcus Antonium gesserunt). Cf. Cic. Brut. 168: doctus autem 
Graecis litteris propinquus noster, factus ad dicendum, M. Gratidius M. Antoni perfamiliaris, cuius 
praefectus cum esset in Cilicia est interfectus, qui accusauit C. Fimbriam, M. Mari Gratidiani pater. The 
location of the operations is also confirmed by an inscription honouring a local naval commander who served 
with Antonius (and his quaestor) in Cilicia in IGRom. 4, 1116 (Rhodes, statue base): ...[] 
the inscription cf. Foucart (1906), p.575f; Mhll (1912) RE VII, no.8, col. 424; and Ferrary (1977), p.640, 
n.73. For the importance of Pergamum and Ephesus see Rigsby (1988), p.137-141 with further references. 
 Drogula (2011), p.112.  
 See Drogula (2011), p.107-113. It should be noted that some of his arguments contain a certain amount of 
special pleading with the underlying hypothesis that maiestas laws (the Lex Porcia in particular) were 
introduced to restrict praetorian magistrates and promagistrates, in part, in response to Antonius operations 
in Cilicia (from Asia), for which see further Ch.IV.iii. He first emphasises that the resources of Rome were 
stretched with various wars and argues that a new prouincia would not have been created (p.107f), yet also 
notes that the pirates may not have been a major threat at the time (p.108-110), that Antonius received help 
from Byzantium (p.111) and that the governor of Asia had vast resources (p.112-113). Antonius seemingly 
brought a fleet from Italy (ILLRP 342), but we do not know the number or type of ships it contained or, more 
generally, how the resources of the res publica were distributed at this time. There was nothing preventing, 
for example, the Senate redistributing resources from Asia (of which we know little: e.g. Sherwin-White 
(1984), p.91) for a new command. Additionally, the Senate could have also given Antonius an explicit 
mandate to accept allied contributions or make his own requisitions/levies in the East: the use of allied forces 
by L. Cornelius Sulla, less than ten years later, in 96 in the prouincia Cilicia is a case in point:    
   ,     ... (Plut. Sul. 5.3). For Sullas 
command in general see Brennan (1992). See Prag (2011), p.18 with n.15 for a list of senatus consulta 
authorising a commander to levy soldiers from overseas allies. Cf. Brunt (1971), p.431 and de Souza (1999), 
p.107.

IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the second century   
purpose of using Sicily as a base from which to invade the Carthaginian homeland.
Sicily, though, was essentially the sine qua non of a successful invasion of Africa, whereas 
a base in the existing prouincia Asia was not absolutely essential for conducting operations 
in Cilicia (and, as we shall see, there is no evidence that this was the case). 
Cicero, writing fewer than fifty years later, explicitly records that Antonius was 
delayed at Athens when proceeding (proficiscens) into Cilicia.
 It is worth noting that he 
often uses the verb proficiscere with regard to travel to a prouincia  even employing it to 
describe his own (reluctant) departure for his prouincia (Cilicia) in 51  and so it is 
conceivable that he uses it with the same sense here.
 An elegiac inscription from Corinth 
seems to confirm that Antonius proceeded directly to the city of Side on the Pamphylian 
coast:  
Quod neque conatus quisquanst neque [-------]au[it (?)] 
noscite rem, ut famaa facta feramus uirei. 
Auspicio [Ant]o [M]ci pro consule classis 
Isthmum traductast missaque per pelagus.

The erased name should be restored as M. Antonius, the commander of 103/102, 
rather than his son, M. Antonius Creticus, or his grandson (the triumvir).

the term in other senatus consulta, in TLL X.2, Fasc. XI, col. 1706, s.v. , II untur qui provinciam vel 
quodlibet munus administrant, legationem suscipiunt (notabiliora selecta)... 
 The text quoted above is from Gordon (1983), p.90, no.14, which is based on lines 1-8 of the text of Dow 
(1951), who prints the traces of letters he was able to find on two excellent squeezes (p.90). Cf. Taylor and 
West (1928) and ILLRP 342. 
IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the second century   
interpreted this evidence as indicating that Antonius, having crossed the Isthmus, must 
have sailed from Corinth  still in ruins from its destruction in 146  to Athens, as 
recorded by Cicero, and then proceeded to Side (almost certainly via the island route and 
Rhodes).
 Crucially, he highlighted that this does not fit well with the notion that 
Antonius was assigned a prouincia Asia: if this had been the case, it is strange that he did 
not first sail to the west coast of Asia to collect forces and make the necessary 
administrative arrangements there (e.g. at either Ephesus or Pergamum).
Additionally, Cilicia is named as a praetorian prouincia, probably around a year 
after Antonius returned from the East in the law on the eastern prouinciae of 100  at a 
time when Asia was also a separate prouincia.
 It is reasonable, therefore, to suggest that 
a precedent was provided by Antonius earlier command. He was, after all, well known for 
fighting pirates in Cilicia and the prima facie rationale for the naming of a prouincia 
Cilicia around 100 was to enable Roman citizens, Latins, allies and friends of the Roman 
 See generally Taylor and West (1928), p.13-19, including a discussion of the letter forms which provide 
little help (c. destruction of Corinth by Mummius in 146 to its re-founding by Iulius Caesar in 44). The date 
was convincingly reaffirmed by Ferrary (1977), p.640-643 contra Sherwin-White (1976), p.4. Cf. de Souza 
(1999), p.105f. 
 Ferrary (1977), p.642f. Antonius presumably gathered the Rhodian support mentioned in IGRom. 4, 1116 
(Rhodes, statue base) at Rhodes itself. Some further confirmation is potentially to be found in Ciceros 
mention of Antonius conversations with learned men at Athens and Rhodes, which he learnt about from his 
uncle L. Cicero who accompanied Antonius (De or. 2.2-3 and cf. 1.83). Cf. Strabo, Geog. 11.1.6 for Cn. 
Pompeius Magnus attending lectures at Rhodes, probably also on his way to Cilicia (e.g. Cic. Leg. Man. 34-
35; Flor. 1.41.8-12; and App. Mith. 96). For the navigation route see generally Arnaud (2005), p.56f and

As Vervaet (2012a), p.71, n.107 speculates, the praetor who received the prouincia Cilicia was probably 
given upgraded consulare imperium (as M. Antonius had around one or two years earlier). 
IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the second century   
people to sail in safety.
 It is important to recall the fundamental premise that a prouincia 
existed because it was named as such for a given year; and so Cilicia could have been first 
designated as a prouincia around 103/102 and later named in the praetorian sortitio for 100 
or 99.
If the above evidence is taken together, then, Cilicia (suggestion iii above) is by far 
the most likely name of Antonius prouincia, although even this may oversimplify what 
could well have been a more complex assignment with specific instructions (e.g. related to 
the fighting of pirates or to enable Roman citizens, Latins, allies and friends of the Roman 
people to sail in safety).  
Whilst the designation of a prouincia Cilicia should not be viewed in terms of 
territorial annexation, this does not mean that it did not have a geographical definition.
Significant problems remain, though, with interpreting what Cilicia actually meant, as 
Syme recognised long ago:  
Cilicia is the most ambiguous of terms; and Cilicians can dispute with Phrygians 
the claim to the widest extension among the peoples of Asia Minor. In the loose 
language of geography or ethnography, Cilicia can denote both the coast eastward 
from Pamphylia in the direction of Syria and the interior to the north, covering 
parts of Pisidia, Lycaonia, and even Cappadocia.

 Whilst I accept that the same prouinciae could be annually named and were, in this sense, regular, I am 
not convinced by the notion of constitutionally fixed (or permanent) prouinciae, for which see Ch.IV.iii.

IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the second century   
Although the search for a purely geographical definition for the prouincia Cilicia at 
the end of the second century is clearly misguided, there is no reason to go to the other 
extreme and search only for a functional definition.
 Instead, the Gordian knot can 
potentially be cut if we recall that one of the underlying considerations associated with 
defining a prouincia was to ensure that it was demarcated from other prouinciae:
 Cilicia 
may, therefore, have been territorially demarcated only in the west for the purposes of 
separating this new command from the existing magistrate (or promagistrate) based in the 
prouincia Asia.  
There are a few surviving clues that allow us to test this theory and to consider 
further how and why a prouincia Cilicia might have been geographically defined around 
103/102. Although the clues individually do not get us very far, a plausible  rather than 
purely speculative  hypothesis can be advanced when they are combined. 
The starting point is the Corinthian inscription quoted earlier, which, crucially, 
reveals that Antonius proceeded ahead of his fleet to Side on the Pamphylian coast. A 
milestone set up by M. Aquillius, consul and then proconsul in Asia (129-126), was 
discovered in situ around five kilometres west of Side.
 This milestone has been taken as 
indicating that Pamphylia, including Side, was included as a formal part of the prouincia 
Asia by the Asian road network, as determined by Aquillius after the death of King Attalus 
III and the bequest of his kingdom to Rome.
 Some scholars have combined this notion 
 E.g. Sherwin-White (1984), p.99 argues that because the law on the eastern prouinciae around 100 (RS, 
no.12) designates Pamphylia, Lycia and Lycaonia by their correct names, it follows that Cilicia should 
refer to Cilicia Tracheia (i.e. Rough Cilicia). Yet, it is also true that Lycaonia is described as being held by 
the praetor or proconsul holding the prouincia Asia (Cnidos Copy, col. III, ll. 22-27) and there is no reason 
why Cilicia could not have been identified as a prouincia in terms of other distinct areas which included 
part(s) of Pamphylia or even Lycaonia. Santangelo (2007), p.27, n.31 clearly goes too far when he states that 
it was still not closely related to an identifiable territory. Cf. Syme (1939b), p.299f and Badian (1964), 
p.161.

IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the second century   
with the knowledge that Antonius travelled to Side and concluded that Pamphylia must 
have been detached from the prouincia Asia to provide a territorial basis for the new 
prouincia Cilicia around 102.
 The road towards Side would have certainly had symbolic 
significance with regard to a Roman territorial dominance of the landscape and, 
presumably, influenced the provincialisation of the region over a longer period:
milestone, after all, records the distance of 331 Roman miles from the administrative 
centre of Pergamum.
 However, even this does not prove that Side was explicitly 
incorporated into a new prouincia Asia in the 120s.
More conclusive evidence is to be found in the Asian customs law which specifies 
Side as being the easternmost city on the Pamphylian coast in which Asian customs dues 
were to be collected.
 The date of the section of the law mentioning Side is not attested in 
the law; and the first marker only appears in a later part in which the consuls of 75 are 
referred to as being responsible for a locatio (ll. 72-73).
 Although scholars have often 
given the part of the law referring to Side the same date of 75, there are very good reasons 
to believe that it dates back either to Aquillius arrangement between 129 and 126 or to the 
 Ferrary (2000b), p.168-170; Ferrary (2003), p.406f; Ferrary (2008b), p.107f; and Mitchell (2008), p.188-

 For the importance of milestones on the landscape and their association with provincialisation see e.g. 
Crawford (1990), p.103f; Purcell (1990), p.12-14; Nicolet (1991), p.191f; and Prag (2006). 
 See generally Mitchell (1999), p.19f, which is confirmed by the calculations of French (2012), p.10f.

could make a comparison with the milestone set up as part of a road between Agrigentum and Panormus in 
Sicily (ILLRP 1277), which  if correctly associated with the consul C. Aurelius Cotta in either 252 or 248  
may very well be symbolic of Roman conquest during the First Punic War, but it certainly does not provide 
evidence for the territorial demarcation of Cottas prouincia (Sicilia?). Crawford (1990), p.103 even 
speculates that Cotta mistakenly thought that Sicily would be treated like Italy. See further Prag (2006) for an 
analysis of how this early milestone might be interpreted (cf. Prag (2011b), p.84f).

 For a discussion of the issues associated with its dating see now Mitchell (2008), p.198-201, who notes 
that this subsequent section of the law must date between 75 and 72, at which point the consuls of that year 
made additions to the law (ll. 84-87). 
IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the second century   
Lex Sempronia of C. Gracchus (tr. pl.) in 123.
 The law also seems to presuppose that 
Asia was a territorially definable entity  presumably based on the lands that were 
accepted from the Attalid Kingdom.
One can speculate that one of the main purposes of defining Asia was to separate it 
from the surrounding kingdoms (e.g. Cappadocia, Galatia and Bithynia) with the 
assumption of certain former royal lands and taxation in mind.
 If this is correct, one can 
suppose that Side, being the easternmost city on the Pamphylian coast, is mentioned 
precisely because it was the first (or last) city in which customs dues could be declared 
when importing (or exporting) goods to (or from) Asia.
 It may even have originally 
marked a notional boundary between the new prouincia Asia and an area named Cilicia, 
which had apparently been given to the sons of the king of Cappadocia after the war with 
Aristonicus.
 Although this is highly speculative, it is not improbable that Rome would 
have made such an arrangement, even if Cilicia was never part of the Attalid Kingdom (the 
same could, after all, be said of neighbouring Pamphylia).
 In any case, Side would have 
 See now Mitchell (2008), p.198-201, although I do not find one of his main arguments, that the milestone 
demonstrates that Side was part of the prouincia Asia up until Antonius command in 103/102 (a terminus 
ante quem), convincing. This dating is also followed in Cottier et al. (2008), p.8-10. 
 See the arguments in Mitchell (2008), p.167-169: the references, shortly after the mention of Side, to the 
 and, in particular, the      (ll. 32-34) at least imply that Asia 
was in some way defined as an  (a prouincia?), but the question of how rigid it was remains very 
much debatable. Cf. Cottier et al. (2008), p.103 s.v. 8: The definition of the specific geographical area 
concerned by the lex was probably more general than that suggested in S. Mitchells paper...and in this sense 
must have indicated not only independent territories surrounding the province of Asia, but also its 
coastland. Note also Kallet-Marx (1995), p.114-117. 
 Cf. Mitchell (2008), p.172-178. In contrast, this was seemingly not the case with regard to free cities 
within the interior of the prouincia (or the western coast of Asia), at least as far as jurisdiction is concerned, 
for which see e.g. Claros I, Menippus, I, p.63f, ll. 17-40 with Kallet-Marx (1995), p.115. Cf. Lintott (1993), 
p.30f. For the demarcation of prouinciae in this way compare the division between King Hieron IIs 
Syracusan Kingdom and the prouincia Sicilia in 215, as discussed in Ch.III.iv.

Cilicia and Lycaonia, since Cappadocia, Galatia and Bithynia are also mentioned as girdling Asia (l.7), for 
which see further Cottier et al. (2008), p.100-103 s.v. 7-11, 1-2 Scope of the lex. Cf. Dmitriev (2005),

IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the second century   
been an excellent point from which to mark a new prouincia Cilicia for Antonius, 
regardless of whether it was based on a previous historical division made with the king of 
Cappadocia:
 the customs law of Asia suggests Side was the easternmost city on the 
Pamphylian coast associated with Asia (c. 129-123) and the evidence of the milestone may 
also imply that the sphere of influence (whether formal or informal) of the magistrate or 
promagistrate of the prouincia Asia extended to this point from 129-126. 
As noted above, scholars have viewed the above evidence as indicating that 
Pamphylia was detached from Asia to give a territorial basis for a new prouincia Cilicia 
for Antonius. Yet, it is much more likely that the prouincia included only the eastern part 
of the Pamphylian coast from Side.
 Meanwhile, the western part of the Pamphylian 
coast would have been separate and, perhaps, instead attached (whether informally or 
formally) to the prouincia Asia. Such a division could have continued whenever Cilicia 
was named as a prouincia from 103/102 onwards, although there could still have been 
some fluidity in the definition of the prouinciae.
 This provides one possible explanation, 
for example, as to why P. Servilius Vatia (cos. 79) was apparently sent as proconsul ad 
Ciliciam et Pamphyliam  i.e. to two separate entities  in 78.
 Moreover, Side continued 
to mark a boundary between the prouincia Asia and prouincia Cilicia around 50 years 
after Antonius command and, despite the chronological gap, such a division could very 
 For the important emphasis on historical factors underlying the definition of prouinciae see especially 
Ferrary (2008a), p.15-17. Cf. Syme (1939b), p.302-305. 
 Cf. Syme (1939b), p.300: Pamphylia would have been a more correct designation [for the province of 
Cilicia]: and Pamphylia is attested. See also now Dmitriev (2005), p.118, who recognises the more 
specific division of Pamphylia proposed above. 
 Note Ciceros complaints in his second Verrine oration from 70 that Cn. Cornelius Dolabella had entered 
the prouincia Asia from his own prouincia Cilicia in 80 (Verr. 2.1.72-73). 
 Eutr. 6.3. This is closely mirrored by Oros. 5.23, who also specifically records Servilius activities in 
Phaselis  west of Side and included in the customs law of Asia (l.26)  and to the east of Side at Corycus. 
Both Eutropius and Orosius are presumably drawing on the Livian tradition (cf. Livy, Per. 90 and 93). For 
Phaselis as outside Cilicia see e.g. Cic. Verr. 2.4.21 and Sall. Hist. 1.128-132M. It is not impossible that 
Servilius was granted both Asia and Cilicia as his prouincia, although this rests on an argumentum ex 
silentio based on the gap in the evidence for the magistrate or promagistrate in Asia for 78, for which note 
Brennan (2000), p.557f. Cf. Kallet-Marx (1995), p.293, who emphasises that two consular armies would be 
present in the East at this point. 
IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the second century   
well have originated in 103/102. Cicero wrote various letters to Ap. Claudius Pulcher (pro 
cos. in Cilicia), describing how he had been (incorrectly) told to succeed him at Side and 
stressing (with some irritation) that he was under the impression that Claudius wished to 
depart from his prouincia Cilicia with the fleet.
 P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther  
apparently serving pro quaestore pro praetore under C. Trebonius (pro cos.) in Asia in 43 
 also wrote letters back to Rome explaining how he had pursued a hostile fleet, ...usque 
Sidam, quae extrema regio est prouinciae meae.
 It is not entirely clear whether the fact 
he proceeded as far as means that Side was included within the prouincia Asia or not, but 
it clearly still marked a territorial limit as it had earlier.
The notion of Side as an original point of separation between the prouincia Asia 
and the new prouincia Cilicia provides one good reason why Antonius sailed directly to 
Side without first stopping at the administrative centres on the west coast of Asia.
arrangement also compares well with the ways in which the Romans conceptualised the 
demarcation of space and, in particular, coastal regions. We have seen in Chapter III that 
Brundisium and Tarentum were named as specific points which marked the outer limits of 
the coastal region which M. Valerius Laevinus (pr.) was to defend in 215.
 Restrictions 
on the movement of states beyond particular geographical points were also common in 
treaties from an early period: the Romans themselves were forbidden from sailing beyond 
the Licinian promontory (now the Capo Collona) according to a treaty with Tarentum from 
 E.g. Cic. Fam. 3.5.4 (28 July, 51): tunc mihi ille dixit, quod classe tu uelles decedere, per fore 
accommodatum tibi si ad Sidam [maritimam partem prouinciae] nauibus accessissem. See further Fam. 3.5.3 
(27 or 28 July, 51) and 3.6.1 (29 August, 51). See also Ciceros own departure one year later in Fam. 3.12.4 
(Side, 3 or 4 August, 50): Decedenti mihi et iam imperio annuo terminato a. d. III Non. Sext., cum ad Sidam 
naui accederem et mecum Q. Seruilius esset, literae a meis sunt redditae.

 See e.g. Dmitriev (2005), p.121 (Side excluded from the prouincia Asia) contra Mitchell (2008), p.192 
(who stretches the meaning too far by using this as evidence that Pamphylia (including Side) from this point 
onwards reverted to the control of the governor of Asia). 
 For the fact that Side was a good base see e.g. Mitchell (1993), p.73f. 
 Livy, 23.32.16-18, as quoted in Ch.III.iii. 
IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the second century   
the late fourth century;
 the treaty at the end of the First Illyrian War in 228 stipulated 
that Teuta (and Pinnes, King of the Ardiaei) should not sail south of Lissus on the Adriatic 
coast with more than two ships;
 and the so-called Peace of Apamea in 188 prohibited 
Antiochus III from sailing beyond the promontories of Calycadnus and Sarpedonium.
Similar conceptualisations of space were also commonly used to demarcate a 
particular coastal region between two Roman commanders. In 178, the town of Ancona on 
the Adriatic coast was employed as a cardo in medio to separate the operational spheres 
of duumuiri nauales: Livy describes how one commander was to defend the left coast from 
Ancona to Aquileia, whereas the other was to protect the coast to the right of Ancona up to 
Tarentum.
 Such a description interestingly presupposes that the point of reference, at 
least in Livys mind, was the land and, more specifically, the town of Ancona itself.
should also be noted that Ancona was conveniently located on the promontory of Monte 
Conero, which would have been a clear marker for sailors.
 Once again, this was 
essentially about the separation of two independent prouinciae as defined by the reference

Furius laeua usque ad Aquileiam tueretur. Cf. Purcell (1990), p.18. For the duumuiri nauales see Chs.I.ii 
and I.iii.  
 This case is far from isolated both in its detail and chronologically. Three years earlier, the promontory of 
Minerva, facing the island of Capri, served as the cardo in medio  from which the term above is borrowed 
 with the right extended to Massilia and the left southwards around the coast to Barium (Livy, 40.18.7-8). In 
190, the praetor in Sicily was given instructions to divide Sicily for coastal defence (if he saw fit) with 
Pachynus as the pivot with one section stretching to Tyndareus and the other to Agrigentum (Livy, 
36.2.11-12). The Pachynus promontory (modern Capo Passero) was an excellent marker (e.g. Polyb. 1.42.4 
and Strabo, Geog. 2.4.3). Furthermore, Appian preserves crucial details of the treaty made at Brundisium 
between M. Antonius and Octavian in 40 when the city of Scodra on the Adriatic coast supposedly marked 
their division of the Roman Empire: Antonius was responsible for the eastern parts up to the Euphrates 
(another geographical marker) and Octavian took the western parts up to the Ocean (B Ciu. 5.65). Cf. Plut. 
Ant. 30.4 and Dio Cass. 48.28.4, who both note the Ionian Sea as the marker. These examples are by no 
means exhaustive. 
 Cf. Plin. HN. 3.18: in ora Cluana, Potentia, Numana a Siculis condita, ab iisdem colonia Ancona,

IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the second century   
to particular coastal cities with a visible point in the middle. It was, therefore, seemingly 
not so concerned with who had authority over Ancona itself. 
A more important precedent would have been available from the demarcation of a 
boundary between the prouinciae of Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior ex senatus 
consulto in 197.
 The concern of the Senate here was the separation of two imperium-
holders rather than marking out two distinct administrative areas.
 Although there is very 
little evidence for the way in which the commands might have been separated in 197  
assuming the instructions were even carried out at the time  a fragment of the Geography 
of Artemidorus of Ephesus, from around 100, provides some important clues.
 In the 
fragment, quoted by Constantine VIII Porphyrogenitus (905-959 A.D.) via Stephanus of 
Byzantium (c. sixth century A.D.), one prouincia () is said to have stretched from 
the Pyrenees as far as New Carthage and the source of the river Baetis, whereas the other 
stretched from that point as far as Gades and Lusitania.
 A recently published papyrus 
also appears to derive its content from Artemidorus and very closely mirrors the fragment 
from Stephanus.
 The boundary was unlikely to have been defined in terms of a fixed 
linear line from New Carthage in the south to the Baetis/Castulo in the north as early as 
 Livy, 32.28.11. 
 See further Ch.III.v. 
 For the fragment see the discussion of Billerbeck (2009). Richardson (1986), p.78 raises the question of 
whether the senatorial decree was actually carried out in 197.

IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the second century   
 Nonetheless, one can easily imagine that the division was initially made at New 
Carthage on the coast, especially as Livy records that a military tribune was specifically 
banished in Hispania...ultra nouam Carthaginem with a letter to be delivered to the 
prorogued praetor (in Hispaniam ulteriorem) in 180.
 Like Ancona in 178, New Carthage 
would have served as a useful cardo in medio for separating the coastal regions of 
Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior certainly by 180 and, perhaps, originally 
seventeen years earlier.
 If correct, the difficulty of conceptualising a line from this point 
into the interior, if that is what was also intended, would explain why commanders 
frequently crossed the (notional) north-western boundary during the 190s.
The above examples illustrate how the Romans regularly conceptualised the coastal 
boundaries between the spheres of commanders and/or states in terms of particular cities or 
geographical landmarks. With this in mind, we can easily imagine that Side was also used 
as a cardo (or pivot) between the existing prouincia Asia and a new prouincia Cilicia in 
103/102  especially if we consider the various indications that Side was located around 
the eastern limit of the sphere of influence associated with the prouincia Asia and that it 
still marked a boundary in the mid-first century. It may also be significant that a 
promontory extended into the sea from Side, which could have provided a convenient 
point of reference and generally fits well with the examples cited above.
 Meanwhile, 
returning to Symes description of Cilicia, as quoted above, I would suggest that clear

text [from the papyrus] seems to confirm and clarify what we had already suspected to be the situation in

only in the south where their areas under direct control abutted, and leaving the north-west uncertain.

IV.ii. M. Antonius: Cilicia, the fleet and the separation of prouinciae at the end of the second century   
delineated frontiers to the east of Side in the direction of Syria and towards Lycaonia 
and Cappadocia in the north were likely to have only developed later  most probably after 
the eastern command of Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the designation of a prouincia Syria 
around 63.
Finally, it is worth adding that the basic idea that prouinciae were demarcated for 
the purposes of separating commanders or powers may provide the best explanation for 
why the law on the eastern prouinciae specified (alongside a eius hac lege nihilum rogatur 
clause) that the praetor or proconsul who has Asia as his prouincia should also have 
Lycaonia and the prouincia Lycaonia.
 This could have been seen as a necessary (or at 
least desirable) means of clarifying that the magistrate or promagistrate with the prouincia 
Asia continued to have responsibility for Lycaonia when a prouincia Cilicia was also 
named (perhaps given the earlier history when both Lycaonia and Cilicia were awarded to 
the Kingdom of Cappadocia);
 and, we may even take this further by speculating that 
Lycaonia may have been explicitly used to separate the prouincia Asia from the prouincia 
Cilicia in the interior.

 See Just. Epit. 37.1.2, as mentioned and discussed earlier. Hassall, Crawford and Reynolds (1974), p.211, 
as the first editors of the Cnidos text, already speculated that the provision was presumably included as a 
result of a certain vagueness in the (lost) territorial description of the new province of Cilicia, which could as 
a result have been held to include all or part of Lycaonia. Ferrary (2000b), p.169f, (2008a), p.13f and 
(2008b), p.110 also emphasises that the naming of Cilicia as a prouincia made it necessary to clarify the 
status of Lycaonia (to be compared with Ferrary (1977), p.636) contra Sherwin-White (1984), p.97, who 
unconvincingly views the clause as referring back to the rights of kings over subjects (ll. 16-21). Cf. Badian 
(1988), p.215; Kallet-Marx (1995), p.234 with n.44; Ferrary (2001b), p.102; Dmitriev (2005), p.86f; and 
Drogula (2011), p.114f. 
 If correct, one might imagine that a (notional) line (cardo in medio) extended from Side in the direction 
of Philomelium (almost a vertical line northwards) or Iconium (a diagonal line to the north-east), depending 
how Lycaonia was defined. For a possible definition of Lycaonia see Mitchell (1999), p.20 with n.14 and 
Mitchell (2008), p.189. Compare also how the Hispaniae are described by Artemidorus (above) in terms of a 
line running from New Carthage to the Baetis/Castulo.  
As a result of the separation of these prouinciae, there would have been no need to 
demarcate any specific functions, such as the command of the fleet, and both the 
commanders in Asia and Cilicia would have been able to operate terra marique.
fundamental point is that the separation of Antonius prouincia Cilicia vis--vis the 
prouincia Asia by means of the coastal city of Side  and, perhaps, Lycaonia  represents a 
continuation of the practice of separating magistrates and/or promagistrates in space, as we 
have observed in the previous chapters.

bello deliberetis, auctor uobis grauior esse nemo debeat... 
IV.iii. The Lex Porcia and the separation of prouinciae: from mos to ius   
IV.iii. The Lex Porcia and the separation of prouinciae: from mos to ius 
The separation of the independent imperium-holders who received the prouincia Cilicia 
and prouincia Asia, as discussed in the previous section, may provide an explanation for 
the reference to a Lex Porcia in the law on the eastern prouinciae around 100: 
        |       
 |                     |    
  |       
|            []      |

 , |<>  ,    
|    ,   |  {} 
  . 
No-one, in contravention of those measures which are in the statute which M. 
Porcius Cato as praetor passed three days before the Feralia, is knowingly with 
wrongful deceit to draw up (an army) or march or travel outside his province, for 
whatever reason or whenever he shall arrive, nor is any magistrate or promagistrate 
to travel or proceed outside the province in command of which province it is or 
shall be appropriate for him to be according to this statute, except according to a 
decree of the senate, except for purposes of transit or for reasons of state, and he is 
without wrongful deceit to restrain his staff.
It is not clear whether the author of the cited law was M. Porcius Cato, praetor 
around 121, or another unknown Cato, who held the praetorship between then and the 
promulgation of the law on the eastern prouinciae.
 In any case, it is noteworthy that this 
somewhat older statute was incorporated into the same passage of the law on the eastern 
prouinciae which stipulated that Lycaonia should be held together with the prouincia Asia 
and that a prouincia Cilicia should also be named.
 This raises two important issues. 
These concern, first, the purpose and political significance of the clauses from the Lex 
 RS, no. 12, Cnidos Copy, col. III, ll. 3-15. For the date and context of the law on the eastern prouinciae 
see Chs.III.iii and IV.ii. 
 See further Drogula (2011), p.91f for the modern literature. 
 Cnidos Copy, col. III, ll. 22-41 (as discussed at the end of IV.ii).  
IV.iii. The Lex Porcia and the separation of prouinciae: from mos to ius   
Porcia, as quoted above; and, second, the reason for their inclusion in the law on the 
eastern prouinciae.  
We can begin by considering the rationale behind the clause stipulating that, No-
one...is knowingly with wrongful deceit to draw up (an army) or march or travel outside 
his province... Although the reference to no-one ( ) is very broad, a comparison 
with the Latin inscription recording the Lex Antonia de Termessibus (c. 68), which cites 
the Lex Porcia, suggests that the original law more precisely applied to magistrates, 
promagistrates and legati:
 this would, therefore, have restricted the movements of 
consuls, praetors, quaestors, promagistrates (pro consule, pro praetore or pro quaestore) 
and their legati.
Drogula recently offered a more nuanced interpretation by arguing that the Lex 
Porcia represents a new development by which stricter limits were placed on the 
movements of magistrates and promagistrates at the end of the second century, which were 
primarily aimed at praetorian commanders holding permanent prouinciae.
 He defines 
the permanent prouinciae as those continuously named by the Senate each year (e.g. 
Sicily, Sardinia, the Spains, Africa, Macedonia and Asia) with clear  though not 
necessarily continuous  territorial boundaries.
 He argues that these prouinciae were 
usually allotted to praetors because they offered fewer opportunities for military conquest 
(with some notable exceptions), whereas the more prestigious consular prouinciae were 
rarely circumscribed by geographic definitions.
 His conclusion is:  
Although we cannot know the intent of the senators who promulgated the bill, the 
lex Porcia  in practice  must have fallen disproportionately upon the shoulders of 
 RS, no.19, col. II, ll. 6-17. For the date of the Lex Antonia see Ferrary (1985), p.439-442.

IV.iii. The Lex Porcia and the separation of prouinciae: from mos to ius   
praetorian commanders, since their provinciae were most easily defined by 
geography.
One cannot deny that consuls predominantly received the more militarily important 
prouinciae and that some prouinciae were permanent in terms of being regularly named 
each year.
 However, the distinction between permanent (or fixed) praetorian 
prouinciae and other non-permanent (or non-fixed) special prouinciae is a modern 
invention stemming from Mommsen and a single passage of Livys History.
 As Vervaet 
neatly put it: A prouincia was a prouincia, regardless of its permanent or temporary 
nature and...whether it was traditionally tied to a certain, more or less defined territorial 
entity.
With this in mind, serious doubts can be raised about the claim that the law was 
primarily intended to circumscribe the activities of praetorian commanders within the 
geographical boundaries of their praetorian prouinciae more strictly than ever before. 
Indeed, I argued in Chapter III that both consular and praetorian prouinciae were 
ordinarily demarcated in the third and second centuries for three main reasons: i) to 
prevent commanders from getting in each others way; ii) to prevent clashes over military 
gloria; and iii) to separate the jurisdiction of imperium-holders and certain kingdoms.
The restrictions imposed by the Lex Porcia were, therefore, not new and did not 
 Ibid., p.101. 
 Cf. Cic. Pis. 38: Tantam uero prouinciam cum tanto exercitu, Macedoniam praesertim, quam tantae 
barbarorum gentes attingunt, ut semper Macedoninicis imperatoribus idem fines prouinciae fuerint qui 
gladiorum atque pilorum; ex qua aliquot praetorio imperio, consulari quidem nemo rediit, qui incolumis 
fuerit, quin triumpharit. For the importance of consular prouinciae see Ch.I.ii. It is worth noting that there 
were, of course, more praetors available each year than consuls and so Drogula is not wrong with his claim 
that the Lex Porcia fell largely on the shoulders of praetorian commanders in strict percentage terms. 
 See Richardson (2008), p.17-25 contra Brennan (2000), p.182-190, esp. p.187-190 and Ferrary (2008a), 
p.9f following Mommsen (1887), II, p.211, n.1 and Livy, 27.22.5-6 (with a further comparison of Livy, 
35.20.8-11). Drogula (2011), p.100 recognises that, Although this difference was nowhere codified in law, 
the distinction between a consular and praetorian provincia was certainly taking shape.  
 Vervaet (2012a), p.61, n.69. Such a distinction did not come into consideration when Cicero famously 
debated the advantages and disadvantages of naming Syria and Macedonia as consular prouinciae versus 
praetorian prouinciae in 55 (Prou. cons. 17), for which see the discussion in Vervaet (2006), esp. p.634-637. 
Cf. Crawford (1990), p.106. 
 Ch.III.iv. 
IV.iii. The Lex Porcia and the separation of prouinciae: from mos to ius   
necessarily lead to stricter fines prouinciae. Rather, they arguably served to reinforce the 
existing practices of demarcating consular and praetorian prouinciae for the above three 
reasons.
Special instructions were ordinarily issued to both consular and praetorian 
magistrates (and promagistrates) in the third and second centuries so that they could cross 
from the geographical area associated with their prouinciae into another sphere. T. 
Otacilius Crassus (pr. 217), for example, was prorogued in Sicily with permission to cross 
into Africa in 216;
 and, likewise, the Senate also authorised M. Valerius Laevinus (pro 
cos.) and P. Cornelius Scipio (cos.) to cross into Africa from the prouincia Sicilia in 208 
and 205 respectively.
 These cases are by no means isolated and they illustrate that such 
instructions were considered necessary in order for a commander to travel outside his 
prouincia. Indeed, this explains why M. Claudius Marcellus (cos.) thought that it was 
important to write to the Senate for permission to lead his legions in Histriam when he had 
been assigned Ligures as his consular prouincia in 183.
 In contrast, A. Manlius Vulso 
(cos.) invaded Histria in 178 without senatorial authorisation, despite the fact that some 
members of his consilium thought that he should first consult the Senate.
 His colleague 
was later questioned by two angry tribunes of the plebs when he returned to Rome to hold 
the elections: Why had Manlius not returned to Rome so that he could deliver an account 
to the Roman people about why he had crossed from prouincia Gallia, which he was 
 Contra Drogula (2011), p.93: As Rome was expanding its reach across the Mediterranean, therefore, it 
was not interested in (and probably did not think of) placing limitations on the scope of its commanders 
activities  the Roman people cared more about results than the manner in which those results were 
achieved. Cf. Crawford (1992), p.203. 
 Livy, 22.37.13. For the prouincia in 217 cf. Livy, 22.25.6 and 22.31.6.

 Livy, 39.55.4-5: M. Claudius consul Gallis ex prouincia exactis Histricum bellum moliri coepit litteris ad 
senatum missis, ut sibi in Histriam traducere legiones liceret. id senatui <non> placuit. For the consular 
prouinciae see Livy, 39.45.3-4. Another (related) explanation that must be taken into account concerns 
whether war against the Histrians had been decreed by the Senate or voted by the people, which is illustrated 
by the type of questions the tribunes of the plebs wished to ask A. Manlius Vulso in 178 (as discussed next in 
the above text). 
 Livy 41.1.1-2. 
IV.iii. The Lex Porcia and the separation of prouinciae: from mos to ius   
allotted, into Histria? When had the Senate decreed that war? When had the people ordered 
that war?
Additionally, the Senate took immediate action, on several occasions at least, 
against commanders who left the sphere of operation associated with their prouincia 
without authorisation. When Cn. Servilius Caepio (cos.) crossed into Sicily in 203 with the 
intention of pursuing Hannibal to Africa, despite the fact he had been allotted a prouincia 
Bruttii, the Senate reportedly decreed that the praetor urbanus should write to the consul 
that it considered it right that he return to Italy; and it then voted to appoint a dictator to 
recall him.
 The Senate was also incensed when C. Cassius Longinus (cos.) decided to 
cross into another magistrates prouincia Macedonia after he had been allotted Italia in 
enimuero senatus indignari tantum consulem ausum, ut suam prouinciam 
relinqueret, in alienam transiret, exercitum nouo periculoso<que> itinere inter 
exteras gentes duceret, uiam tot nationibus in Italiam aperiret.
Accordingly, the Senate sent three legati to announce to the consul that he should 
not begin war with any people, nisi cum qua senatus gerendum censuerit.
 Once again, 
the fundamental point seems to be that even a consul required senatorial authorisation to 
leave his prouincia  especially when crossing over to the prouincia assigned to another 
 Livy 41.7.4-10. Cf. Briscoe (2012a), p.57f s.v. 8-9. It is notable that Histria was subsequently decreed 
as a consular prouincia for 177: prouinciae deinde, quae in bello erant, Sardinia atque Histria <consulibus> 
decretae... (Livy, 41.9.1-2). 
 Livy 30.24.1-4. For the original prouincia see Livy 30.1.1 and 30.1.9. The Senates response makes it 
clear that the consuls mandate aduersus Hannibalem was not enough to justify him leaving the 
(geographical) area associated with the Bruttii (pace Drogula (2011), p.100f with n.35). I do not share the 
scepticism of Brennan (2000), p.116 regarding the historicity of this case, as I think it is plausible that a 
dictator could have been asked to recall the consul (e.g. by letter in place of the praetor), perhaps even 
alongside a role in holding the elections. The dictator was, after all, the only magistrate to outrank a consul 
(cf. the  admittedly much later  reference in Cic. Leg. 3.3.9).  
 Livy, 43.1.4-12 (with the above quotation from 43.1.9-10). See Livy, 42.31.1 and 42.32.5 for the consular 
prouinciae (Italia and Macedonia) and generally Brennan (2000), p.116f. Cf. Briscoe (2012a), p.388-390 s.v. 
1. 4-12. Actions of C. Cassius Longinus. 
 Livy, 43.1.11-12. As Brennan (2000), p.117 notes (with Livy, 43.5.1-9 and 44.31.15), Cassius presumably 
remained in Greece until at least 168 in order to avoid prosecution on his return to Rome. Cf. Lintott (1981a), 
p.172.  
IV.iii. The Lex Porcia and the separation of prouinciae: from mos to ius   
(in alienam prouinciam)  and to make war with people/s who had not been declared 
enemies.  
There is no evidence  nor any reason to assume  that the actions of Servilius and 
Cassius were prohibited by any statutory law, but it is clear that both commanders 
overstepped what was considered appropriate, according to the mos maiorum and the 
(related) auctoritas senatus in the third and second centuries. Indeed, the above examples 
demonstrate that the stipulation associated with the Lex Porcia which prohibited a 
magistrate or promagistrate from leaving his prouincia without a senatorial decree 
(except according to a decree of the senate) was customary much earlier.  
We can also presume that the causa rei publicae exception (for reasons of state) 
mentioned in the law on the eastern prouinciae also stretches back over one hundred years 
earlier than the Lex Porcia. It almost certainly accounts for the decision taken by C. 
Claudius Nero (cos.) to leave his allotted prouincia of the Bruttii and Lucani (aduersus 
Hannibalem) and to proceed to the prouincia Gallia (aduersus Hasdrubalem) of M. Livius 
Salinator (cos.) in 207.
 Indeed, Livy states that Claudius made his judgement on the 
basis of the tempus rei publicae to break with the consilia ordinaria and that he was aware 
that this was a decision, quod coeptum non minorem apud ciues quam hostes terrorem 
faceret, perpetratum in magnam laetitiam ex magno metu uerteret...
 In other words, his 
actions causa rei publicae, despite initially causing alarm, would be celebrated as long as 
they were successful.
 The instances where commanders freely crossed the straits of 
Messana from the prouincia Sicilia into Italy during the Second Punic War can be 
 Livy, 27.35.10-11 and 27.43.5-12. Cf. Polyb. 11.1. 
 Livy 27.43.6-8. 
 As observed in Ch.III.v, Claudius later received a lesser triumph for his successes because he had fought 
in aliena prouincia. Cf. Drogula (2011), p.93. 
IV.iii. The Lex Porcia and the separation of prouinciae: from mos to ius   
explained in the same way;
 and M. Porcius Cato (cos.) may have applied the same 
rationale when he campaigned in Hispania Ulterior, despite having been allotted Hispania 
Citerior in 195.
With these much earlier cases in mind, then, the clauses of the Lex Porcia, as they 
are cited in the law on the eastern prouinciae, can be seen as part of the general trend in 
which mos, as it was understood in the previous centuries, was confirmed or, in some 
instances, replaced by leges.
 The promulgation of a law as a possible means of 
strengthening the mos maiorum may be seen within the context of a general weakening of 
senatorial authority (and political consensus) in the late second and early first centuries.
One can also reasonably argue that prouinciae were always fairly prescriptive and 
that the Lex Porcia does not demonstrate that they were any more rigidly territorially 
defined in the late second century than they had been in the third and early second 
centuries.
 We do not even know if the Lex Porcia was the first attempt at codifying the 
 E.g. Ap. Claudius Pulcher (pr.) crossed from Messana to Locri (Livy, 23.41.11-12) and sent a garrison 
from Sicily to Rhegium (24.1.11-12) in 215. Cf. Livy, 29.7-9 for P. Cornelius Scipio (cos.) crossing over 
from Sicily in 205 with further references in Prag (2007b), p.293. 
 Vervaet (2012a), p.60, n.58 raises another possibility that the Senate may have actually authorised Cato to 
act in Hispania Ulterior if necessary. If correct, perhaps, Livy even condensed this permission in his report 
of the lot as simply Hispania rather than Hispania Citerior with further instructions (Livy, 33.43.5). Cf. 
Livy, 33.43.5-6: P. Manlius in Hispaniam citeriorem adiutor consuli datus. Drogula (2011), p.101, n.35 
wrongly takes Catos actions as an indication that consuls did not have to remain within any geographic 
borders, but had to simply fight the enemy assigned to them. Cf. Richardson (1986), p.88.  
 Badian (1965), p.112, n.19 already rightly recognised that the Lex Porcia was mos maiorum in the second 
century. Note also Brennan (2000), p.525: Quite possibly, he [M. Porcius Cato] had taken over an old 
prohibition on a commander marching beyond his provincia  the issue had been a burning one already about 
seventy years earlier, thanks to the aspirations of C. Cassius Longinus (cos. 171) to fight a Macedonian war  
and simply added a new proviso (e.g. extension of the prohibition to a generals staff) to make his lex 
Porcia. Cf. OCD
, p.1265 s.v. provincia/province and Brennan (2004), p.46. For the development of the 
use of leges in place of mos see generally e.g. Bauman (1967), p.75f; Richardson (1986), p.168-171; and 
Lintott (1999), p.4-7.  
 Although this development cannot be fully treated within the scope of this chapter, it is worth making a 
comparison with the almost unopposed authority of the Senate in making decisions on prouinciae that we 
observed in Chapter III. I would also view the Lex Sempronia de prouinciis consularibus (c. 123) within the 
same context, especially if it was passed only a few years before the Lex Porcia and if one of its aims was to 
reinforce the Senates capacity to name the consular prouinciae by allowing them to do so without 
interference (e.g. tribunician veto) in advance of the elections. See further Vervaet (2006) with p.649-654 
with an assessment of the political implications of this Lex Sempronia. 
 Cf. Lintott (1993), p.26: ...any impression given by the Cnidos text of the law about the provinces that 
through the lex Porcia a province had become something neatly defined is an illusion.  
IV.iii. The Lex Porcia and the separation of prouinciae: from mos to ius   
restrictions on the movements of magistrates and promagistrates out of their prouinciae; it 
certainly was not the last. Cicero mentions L. Cornelius Sullas Lex Cornelia de maiestate 
(c. 81)  alongside plurimae (unnamed) leges ueteres (how old?) presumably including the 
Lex Porcia  that prohibited a commander leaving his prouincia, leading an army out (of 
the prouincia), waging war on his own initative and entering a kingdom without the orders 
of the populus Romanus or Senate.
 Once again, the underlying premise was that these 
actions should not be undertaken without iussus populi Romani aut senatus  a condition 
reiterated in law, but customary for many centuries previously.
In relation to the second issue raised at the start of this section concerning the 
reason for the inclusion of the clauses from the Lex Porcia in the law on the eastern 
prouinciae, we can now suppose that it was cited as an attempt at enforcing the separation 
of imperium-holders in the East, which had previously been a customary rather than 
statutory rule.
 It is uncertain where the citation of the Lex Porcia ends, but it is probable 
that the law on the eastern prouinciae added the following clause, presumably based on 
(and slightly modifying) the former lex:
 ...nor is any magistrate () or 
promagistrate () to travel or proceed outside the province in command of which 
province it is or shall be appropriate for him to be according to this statute...
 Although 
the reference to this statute could refer back to the Lex Porcia, arguably it corresponds 
more closely with the law on the eastern prouinciae and the specific arrangements made 
 Cic. Pis. 50: ...mitto exire de prouincia, educere exercitum, bellum sua sponte gerere, in regnum iniussu 
populi Romani aut senatus accedere, quae cum plurimae leges ueteres, tum lex Cornelia maiestatis, Iulia de 
pecuniis repetundis planissime uetat... 
 Cf. already Livy, 10.37.6 (294 B.C.) with discussion ch.III.v. 
 Lintott (1993), p.26f rightly recognised that the fundamental purpose of the Lex Porcia was to stop 
magistrates interferring in each others prouinciae.  
 See e.g. Richardson (1986), p.169: ...the Delphi/Cnidos law itself enlarged on the lex Porcia by 
specifying that a commander appointed by the law should not leave the provincia to which he was assigned 
without permission of the senate, and that he should restrain those with him, presumably his own staff. Cf. 
Brennan (2000), p.524, who also takes the reference as referring to Macedonia and Asia. Many other 
scholars have simply assumed that the whole passage derives from the Lex Porcia.  
 RS, no. 12, Cnidos Copy, col. III, ll. 9-11 (as quoted in full at the start of this section). 
IV.iii. The Lex Porcia and the separation of prouinciae: from mos to ius   
for the definition of the these prouinciae (Macedonia, Asia and Cilicia). With this in mind, 
it is worth noting that the Latin equivalent underlying the latter half of the sentence is most 
probably, cui prouinciae eum ex hac lege praeesse oportet oportebit.
 This means 
implicitly that it would not have been appropriate to travel in alienam prouinciam  i.e. 
praeesse non oportet/oportebit  as, for example, if the magistrate or promagistrate with 
the prouincia Cilicia travelled to the prouincia Asia or Lycaonia (or the prouincia 
Lycaonia).
 Indeed, Cicero attempted to provide justification in the Senate as to why C. 
Cassius Longinus (pro cos.) intended to go to Syria when he had been assigned another 
prouincia in 43: divine law, he suggested, was linked to the salvation of the res publica 
and therefore took precedence over the fact that if men accepted written laws then Syria 
was legally an aliena prouincia.
 Although Cicero does not refer to the name of the 
particular written laws against which he sought to justify Cassius actions, the Lex 
Porcia was presumably included, even if its provisions had been confirmed in more recent 
legislation such as L. Cornelius Sullas Lex Cornelia de maiestate (c. 81) and C. Iulius 
Caesars Lex Iulia de pecuniis repetundis (59).
In summary, the Lex Porcia was most probably named in the law on eastern 
prouinciae to highlight that the magistrate or promagistrate with the prouincia Cilicia (and 
their legati) should not cross into the prouincia Asia  e.g. as demarcated, perhaps, with 
 RS, no. 12, p.260, s.v. ll. 10-11. 
 Cf. Ciceros criticism of C. Verres (leg. pro pr.) in his second Verrine oration for convincing his superior 
commander, Cn. Cornelius Dolabella (pr. 81), to leave his prouincia Cilicia and to cross into C. Claudius 
Neros (pr. 81) prouincia Asia around twenty years later in 80 (2.1.72-73). Unsurprisingly, he claims that 
Dolabellas actions were criticised by many, but it is significant that the crossing into anothers prouincia 
receives special mention: fecit id quod multi reprehenderunt, ut exercitum prouinciam, bellum relinqueret, et 
in Asiam hominis nequissimi causa in alienam prouinciam proficisceretur... (2.1.73). 
 Cic. Phil. 11.28-29. For Cassius original prouincia Africa see Plut. Brut. 19.5 ( ) and compare 
App. B Ciu. 3.8 (with some confusion). Cf. Cic. Phil. 11.4.2 and 11.27.13. Cicero was not overly confident 
with this argument, since he proposed a motion  unsuccessfully as it turned out  to give Cassius the 
prouincia Syria with various armies, the war against P. Cornelius Dolabella (pro cos.) and the right to 
command in Asia, Bithynia and Pontus with an consulare imperium maius quam the individuals holding 
those prouinciae (Cic. Phil. 11.29-31 and Fam. 12.7). Cicero presumably intended to limit clashes over the 
right to command in the field with his imperium maius provision and to avoid the subsequent prosecution of 
Cassius by getting the necessary authorisation from the Senate and populus Romanus in advance.  
 See Cic. Pis. 50 and RS, no.55 (Lex Iulia de pecuniis repetundis), p.769f, s.v. Introduction. 
Side to Lycaonia serving as a cardo in medio  and vice versa.
 As I suggested in the 
previous section, it is unlikely that the prouincia Cilicia would have been clearly 
demarcated to the east of Side towards Syria; nor, probably, towards Cappadocia in the 
northeast.
 The separation of imperium-holders in space, therefore, just as it had been in 
the third and early second centuries, continued to be a fundamental factor in the definition 
of prouinciae at the end of the second century. The major difference was that this was now 
enforced by statutory law.  
 I would also suggest that provisions concerning what could and could not be done regarding kingdoms 
(e.g. Cappadocia) could have been added as an additional clause. The lines preceding the mention of the Lex 
Porcia are too fragmentary to interpret properly, but they are probably connected with its provisions: [--- c. 5 
---]+     | []        |[] (RS, no.12, 
Cnidos Copy, col. III, ll. 1-3). I find the hypothesis proposed in RS, no.12, p.259, s.v. ll. 1-3 reasonably 
compelling: But since the latter do not form a separate paragraph, these lines will probably have made a 
general statement about what could or could not be done to a kingdom (?), king or nation. This can be 
compared with the provisions Cicero mentions in reference to the Lex Cornelia de maiestate (Pis. 50), which 
may have been intended to reinforce the traditional custom that one should not make wars on kingdoms or 
peoples without authorisation (i.e. to avoid a nefarium bellum, for which cf. Cic. Pis. 84). It is worth noting, 
for example, that one of the arguments used against the triumph of Cn. Manlius Vulso (pro cos.) in 187 was 
that war had not been ordered by the people or the Senate (Livy, 38.45.5-6), although note Rich (1993), 
p.57f. 
 Cf. Kallet-Marx (1995), p.234 who alternatively suggests that the Lex Porcia was named in order to 
prevent unnecessary interference in eastern Seleucid waters rather than Asia to the west. This, however, 
does not fit very well with his own hypothesis (p.21, n.43) criticising the overly rigid view of prouinciae 
held in Lintott (1981b): ...provinciae were strictly and formally demarcated only where it was necessary (1) 
to prevent commanders from stepping on each others toes...and (2) for the functioning of maiestas laws at 
the regular points of entry and exit... (cf. Ch.III.iv). Dmitriev (2005), p.95 implies that it was named because 
of the far-reach of the Roman command in Cilicia (he names, for example, Cappadocia). Drogula (2011), 
p.120f also takes the law as being aimed at restricting unauthorized campaigning outside prouinciae, 
although he unconvincingly views the law as a response the campaigns of M. Antonius in Cilicia from Asia 
and T. Didius in Macedonia (p.119-121). As I argued in the previous section, M. Antonius was almost 
certainly granted a prouincia Cilicia and, therefore, his actions were not unusually aggressive as Drogula 
suggests. (It is notable that both he and Didius were granted triumphs by the Senate.) 
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora 
maritima in the first century  
A significant development in the way that naval commands were defined occurred in the 
first century when M. Antonius Creticus and Cn. Pompeius Magnus were given 
Mediterranean-wide commands against the pirates in 75/74 and 67. Velleius Paterculus 
makes a direct comparison between the assignments, which he claims gave the 
commanders authority over almost the whole world.
 This represents a dramatic change 
from the pattern we observed in the previous chapters in which overlapping prouinciae 
were demarcated either in space or by function. As we shall see in the next two parts of 
this chapter, this had far reaching consequences not only for how individual commands 
and prouinciae were conceived, but also for how the Romans viewed their empire. The 
first part will examine the evidence for how the prouinciae of Antonius and Pompeius 
were defined, which, in turn, will be used to assess the political implications of the 
commands (IV.iv). The second part will then consider the relationship between these 
definitions and the conceptualisation of empire (IV.v).  
The first important development in the definition of prouinciae is to be found when 
the praetor M. Antonius Creticus, son of the M. Antonius discussed earlier (IV.ii), was 
assigned an extraordinary prouincia with a novel geographical definition (ex senatus 
consulto) between 75/74 and 72/71.
 A surviving fragment of Sallusts Historiae  
 Vell. Pat. 2.31.2-4. 
 See Vell. Pat. 2.31.2-4 and Lactant. Diu. inst. 1.11.32 for the assignment ex senatus consulto. The 
communis opinio dates Antonius praetorship and the assignment of the command to 74, which Brennan 
(2000), p.796, n.147 notes seems quite secure on the basis of Cic. Verr. 2.3.214-215 and Vell. Pat. 2.31.3. 
However, there are three reasons why we should not so readily accept the date of 74. First, it should be 
stressed that Cicero does not refer to Antonius status in 74 and so he could have already been prorogued at 
that time. Secondly, even more precariously, the reference in Velleius text to Antonius appointment seven 
years before the Lex Gabinia (67) comes from an emendation of ante biennium (ed. pr.) to ante septennium 
in the 1803 edition (Leipzig) of J.C.J. Krause, which is printed in the 1998 Teubner text edited by W.S. Watt. 
For sake of argument, one could just as easily emend the biennium in the Velleius manuscript to octennium 
rather than septennium. It is worth noting that Velleius also appears to date the Lex Gabinia post biennium 
from Pompeius consulship of 70 rather than post triennium (2.31.2). In any case, as Marti (1971), p.266 
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
quoted directly by the so-called Scholia in Iuuenalem Vetustiora  provides the first clue 
as to how this prouincia was defined by describing Antonius as, qui orae maritimae, qua 
Romanum esset imperium, curator <nocent>ior piratis.
 The reference to Antonius 
command (or guardianship, according to Maurenbrechers plausible emendation of the 
manuscript reading) of the coastal regions  which were explicitly linked to the 
imperium Romanum  could very well represent a geographical definition of his 
prouincia.
 Yet, what was meant by the ora maritima at this time?  
We have seen already how the ora maritima of Italy and certain prouinciae were 
divided in various ways throughout the third and second centuries. However, there is no 
evidence for a division of Antonius command. On the contrary, the commission was 
apparently created for the purpose of pursuing the pirates and safeguarding the maritime 
supply routes against piracy (and Sertorius) throughout the entire Mediterranean.
cautions, one should not give too much weight to the figures given by Velleius (or, rather, present in his 
manuscript tradition). Thirdly, the reference in Pseudo-Asconius commentary on Ciceros Verrines to the 
gratia Cottae consulis in securing Antonius appointment may confirm a date of 74 if this is taken as the 
consul M. Aurelius Cotta (Ps.-Ascon. p.259 Stangl). However, it could potentially refer to C. Aurelius Cotta 
(cos. 75) and so would suggest a date of 75 for the start of Antonius command (and his praetorship). It is, 
therefore, safest to admit that Antonius command could have been assigned in either 75 or 74. For 
Antonius death in Crete in 72/71 see Kallet-Marx (1995), p.307, n.59 and Brennan (2000), p.407 with 
p.797, n.159. Finally, for Creticus as his appellatio priuata see Linderski (1990b).  
 Hist. 3 frag. 2M. It is important to note that Maurenbrecher (1893), p.109f emended contrarius piratis, as 
preserved in the Scholia in Iuuenalem Vetustiora manuscripts, to curator nocentior piratis based on the clear 
parallels with language to be found in Pseudo-Asconius description of Antonius command, which 
undoubtedly goes back to Sallust (curator ex Ciceronis scholiasta restitui). See further Ps. Ascon. p.202, 
p.239 and p.259 Stangl, with my discussion in the following paragraphs. Cf. Maurenbrecher (1891), p.72 
(conjecturing curator aduersus piratas) and Wessner (1931), p.142 and p.271 (suggesting curator peior 
piratis). More recently, Funari (1996), p.474f maintained the manuscript reading and proposed that the 
meaning of orae maritimae could have been completed by a missing word or verb, such as praeesse (or one 
might add curator based on Pseudo-Asconius). In any case, the problem with the Scholia in Iuuenalem 
Vetustiora manuscripts does not affect the arguments presented above, since the clear sense of the text is that 
Antonius had a command associated with the ora maritima. 
 See the previous note for Maurenbrechers emendation. Richardson (2008), p.99f acknowledges the 
geographical flavour of imperium Romanum, but concludes that Sallust seems to mean...the power of the 
people, which can be taken to stand for the whole state. 
 See especially Kallet-Marx (1995), p.304-311, who notes on p.307 that Lactantius states that the 
command was decreed by the Senate ut praedones persequeretur ac mare omne pacaret (Diu. Inst. 1.11.32). 
As we shall see, this may go back to Sallust and may, therefore, accurately summarise the original rationale 
for the command. Cf. Schol. Bob, p.96 Stangl and App. Sic. 6.1. Cf. Foucart (1906), p.572; Marti (1971), 
p.269f; Gruen (1974), p.539; and de Souza (1999), p.142-148. 
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
rationale is reflected in the complaints made by C. Aurelius Cotta, as consul in 75, in a 
speech given to him by Sallust: 
Consules nos fecistis Quirites domi bellique impeditissima re publica; namque 
imperatores Hispaniae stipendium, milites, arma, frumentum poscunt  et id res 
cogit, quoniam defectione sociorum et Sertorii per montis fuga neque manu certare 
possunt neque utilia parare ; exercitus in Asia Ciliciaque ob nimias opes 
Mithridatis aluntur, Macedonia plena hostium est nec minus Italiae maritima et 
prouinciarum, cum interim uectigalia parua et bellis incerta uix partem sumptum 
sustinent: ita classe quae commeatus tuebatur minore quam antea nauigamus.
Although Sallust composed the speech over thirty years later, there is no reason to 
doubt that it portrays accurately some of the major issues of the time, given the real 
problems affecting the coastal regions of Italy and the prouinciae.
 It is, therefore, easy 
to imagine that Antonius command was defined in terms which reflected these widely 
geographically dispersed problems. Indeed, the notion that Sallusts description of 
Antonius command of the ora maritima stood for the (ora) maritima Italiae et 
prouinciarum finds support in Pseudo-Asconius commentary on Ciceros description of 
Antonius in his second Verrine oration: 
Hic est M. Antonius qui, gratia Cottae consulis et Cethegi factione in senatu 
curationem infinitam nactus totius orae maritimae, et Siciliam et prouincias omnes 
depopulatus est et ad postremum inferens Cretensibus bellum morbo interiit.
It is possible that the Cotta referred to here was the consul of 75, especially bearing 
in mind the above speech in which he (or Sallust) outlined some pressing reasons for the 
creation of such a wide command.
 Even if Pseudo-Asconius meant the other Cotta, who 
was consul of 74 (as is usually assumed), the language undoubtedly mirrors Sallusts 
 Sall. Hist. 2.47.7M. See Rosenblitt (2011) p.397f, n.1 and 2 for recent bibliography on the speech. 
 See McGushin (1992), p.211 s.v. 2.44 with Cic. Orat. 132 for the fact that none of Cottas speeches had 
survived to 46. Cf. Syme (1964), p.207f. 
 Ps.-Ascon. p.259 Stangl.  
 It is also worth noting the following section of Sallusts Cotta speech: Adsum en C. Cotta consul Facio 
quod saepe maiores asperis bellis fecere, uoueo dedoque me pro re publica Quam deinde cui mandetis 
circumspicite; nam talem honorem bonus nemo uolet, cum fortunae et maris et belli ab aliis acti ratio 
reddenda aut turpiter moriendum sit... (Hist. 2.47.11M). 
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
description of M. Antonius and provides confirmation that the ora maritima might have 
been understood as including all (tota) of the coastal regions of all (omnes) of the 
prouinciae.
 Lactantius, writing around the beginning of the fourth century A.D., uses 
very similar terminology and is explicit in equating it with all of the coastal regions 
(including the islands):  
de Neptuni sorte manifestum est: cuius regnum tale fuisse dicimus, quale Marci 
Antoni fuit infinitum illud imperium, cui totius orae maritimae potestatem senatus 
decreuerat, ut praedones persequeretur ac mare omne pacaret. sic Neptuno 
maritima omnia cum insulis obuenerunt.
It is apparent that Pseudo-Asconius and Lactantius made use of Sallusts Historiae 
 whether directly or indirectly  given the similarities in language and the record of 
details which are not found in any other surviving source.
 Marti also noted that 
Pseudo-Asconius elsewhere explicitly refers to Sallust by name.
 One can imagine that 
both Pseudo-Asconius and Lactantius (or their source) had access to the now lost sections 
between books two and three of Sallusts Historiae, which almost certainly recorded the 
command in some detail, especially as they preserve details about the method of his 
appointment (senatus consultum) and the influence exerted by Cotta and Cethegus.
Furthermore, as they are both drawing on Sallust, there is a strong possibility that totius 
was accidentally omitted from the quotation of Sallust found in the Scholia in Iuuenalem 
 This is even more apparent in Pseudo-Asconius comment on Ciceros reference to the activities of a 
praefectus Antoni in his Diuinatio in Caecilium, which clearly echoes Sallust (Hist. 3 frag. 2M): <M.> 
Antonius curator tuendae totius orae maritimae qua Romanum erat imperium, non solum ipse nequam, 
uerum etiam comitibus pessimis, rem inauditam inuasit et indicto Cretensibus bello male re gesta ibidem 
periit, ante quam Pompeius contra piratas missus est... (p.202 Stangl). Cf. Ps.-Ascon. p.239 Stangl. On the 
clear use of Sallust by Ps-Asconius (or his source) see Maurenbrecher (1893), p.108, which is followed by 
Marti (1971), p.269 and Linderski (1990b), p.162. 
 Diu. inst. 1.11.32-33. Cf. Schol. Bob, p.96 Stangl: Coeperat quidem ante illum orae maritimae 
praepositus M. Antonius piratas persequi, sed rebus nondum confectis morte praeuentus est. 
 See Marti (1971), p.268f. See also further Ogilvie (1978), p.41f, who claims that Lactantius certainly 
knew Sallusts Bellum Catilinae, but also made use of his other works at second hand. 
 Marti (1971), p.269 with Ps.-Ascon. p.239 Stangl: Hic est M. Antonius, dissolutissimus largitor et totius 
curator orae maritimae, Cretae mortuus, de quo ipse dicet: Et post M. Antonii infinitum illud imperium 
senserant, et quem Sallustius ait perdundae pecuniae genitum et uacuum a curis nisi instantibus. 
 See Maurenbrecher (1893), p.58f; Marti (1971), p.268f; and McGushin (1994), p.65f. 
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
Vetustiora, as initially quoted above, or, alternatively, that it has simply fallen out of the 
manuscript tradition.
 If correct, Sallust would have originally described Antonius as, qui 
[totius] orae maritimae qua Romanum esset imperium, curator <nocent>ior piratis.
The comments of Pseudo-Asconius and Lactantius  and their use of Sallust  
elucidate and provide the crucial context for understanding Ciceros claim, which he made 
just a few years after Antonius appointment, that the Sicilians had suffered under his 
infinitum illud imperium.
 Mommsen took this phrase as representing a revival of an 
ancient unlimited consulare imperium (infinitum), which, he believed, the consuls had 
on the sea from Italy without fixed limits until L. Cornelius Sulla, as dictator legibus 
scribundis et rei publicae constituendae, supposedly removed the consuls right to exercise 
imperium militiae during their term of office from around 81 onwards.
 However, I 
suggested in Chapter I that a special naval competence does not appear to have been 
singled out as part of the consulare imperium.
 Furthermore, other modern scholars have 
shown beyond doubt that a Sullan Lex Cornelia de prouinciis ordinandis never existed and 
that the consuls did not lose their right to exercise imperium outside of Rome.
 Instead, 
more recent scholarship has rightly recognised that Ciceros use of infinitum is rhetorical 
 Cf. Wessner (1931), p.xxxvi-xlv and note especially xliii in which there were retractationes partim 
restrictae, partim amplificatae at a very early point in the manuscript tradition.  
 See Hist. 3 frag. 2M and n.729 above for the rationale behind the emendation of contrarius piratis in the 
manuscripts to curator nocentior piratis. 
 Cic. Verr. 2.2.8: ...et postea M. Antonii infinitum illud imperium senserant. Cf. Cic. Verr. 2.3.213: Et hic 
utrum mihi difficile est dicere an his existimare ita se in isto infinito imperio M. Antonium gessisse ut multo 
isti perniciosius sit dicere se in re improbissima uoluisse M. Antonium imitari quam si posset defendere nihil 
in uita se M. Antonii simile fecisse? It is apparent that Lactantius directly or indirectly combined Cicero with 
Sallust, given his (surely) deliberate uerbatim recall of Ciceros infinitum illud imperium. Ogilvie (1978), 
p.71 claims that Lactantius knew the Verrines well. Cf. Jameson (1970), p.542, n.22 and Marti (1971), 
p.268. 
 See Mommsen (1887), II, p.654f, p.579 and cf. p.581 with the more detailed discussed in Ch.I.ii. This 
also had a profound influence on Tarn (1925), p.492 and p.495 (though, without an explicit reference to these 
passages). For a good overview of how the theory of an imperium infinitum influenced modern scholars see 
especially Jameson (1970), p.540-542. For Sullas title as dictator see Vervaet (2004), p.41 with App. B Ciu. 
1.99. 
 Ch.I.ii. 
 See now Pina Polo (2011), p.225-248 with references to the modern literature and note especially the 
classic discussion by Giovannini (1983), p.73-101. 
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
rather than constitutional.
 Cicero almost certainly employs it to illustrate the vast 
geographical area within which Antonius could exercise his imperium without any fixed 
divisions;
 and he even uses it elsewhere to describe the vast number (or extent) of the 
pirates overcome by Cn. Pompeius Magnus, who, as we shall see shortly, held a 
comparable command in 67.
 As Marti observed, this interpretation fits the overall 
context of the passage in which Cicero describes some of Antonius actions in Sicily  
which was governed in 74 by C. Licinius Sacerdos (pr. 75)  and Cicero even explicitly 
mentions his harmful activities in the prouinciae.
 It also explains why Antonius 
operated in both the western and eastern Mediterranean between 75/74 and 72/71.
As contemporaries, both Cicero and Sallust were well placed to interpret Antonius 
position. The evidence they provide, elucidated by Lactantius and the scholiasts, suggests 
that Antonius was granted a new type of prouincia that encompassed the tota ora maritima 
of the Mediterranean and, therefore, overlapped with a number of existing prouinciae.  
This conclusion will now be further supported and expanded through a comparison 
with the famous extraordinary command voted for Cn. Pompeius Magnus by the rogatio 
 Eg. Branger (1948); Jameson (1970), p.540-543; Marti (1971); Gruen (1974), p.19, n.39; Crawford 
(1992), p.203; Kallet-Marx (1995), p.304f; de Souza (1999), p.141, n.188; Brennan (2000), p.406; and 
Girardet (2001), p.171, n.73.  
 This was rightly highlighted by Brennan (2000), p.406: It [infinitum imperium] is a jibe, aimed not at the 
quality of imperium Antonius received, but at the rather vague fines of his provincia... Brennan (2000), 
p.535-537 also makes a valuable comparison between this and Ciceros use of infinitum imperium for the 
commands of C. Calpurnius Piso (cos.) and A. Gabinius (cos.) in Macedonia and Syria respectively from 58. 
In addition, Richardson (2008), p.74-79 shows that Cicero could use imperium in a territorial sense, although 
he highlights the difficulty of determining whether this related to power (over a territory) or the territory 
itself. Cf. especially Cic. Leg. Man. 53: si plus apud populum Romanum auctoritas tua quam ipsius populi 
Romani salus et uera causa ualuisset, hodie hanc gloriam atque hoc orbis terrae imperium teneremus?  
 Sest. 67 (56 B.C.)

 748, ll. 32-36 (Gytheum) and IG 
 1, 66 (Epidaurus) for Antonius demands on Gytheum and Epidaurus in Greece, for which see further the 
discussions in Kallet-Marx (1995), p.308 and de Souza (1999), p.146f. 
 See Marti (1971), p.270; Linderski (1990b), p.157 with n.2; Kallet-Marx (1995), p.306-311; de Souza 
(1999), p.143-148; and Brennan (2000), p.406f. It should be noted that Mattingly (1980), p.1499, n.28 claims 
that the some of the Sallust fragments (3.4-7M)  crucial for revealing Antonius operations on the Gallic 
and Spanish coasts  apply to another Antonius who defected to Sertorius.  
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
Gabinia de uno imperatore contra praedones constituendo of 67.
 This will enable the 
full implications of the vast new Mediterranean-wide prouincia to be illuminated, which 
will be explored in the following part of the chapter. Velleius Paterculus makes the direct 
comparison between the two commands in the following terms: 
...A. Gabinius tribunus legem tulit...Cn. Pompeius ad eos opprimendos mitteretur 
essetque ei imperium aequum in omnibus prouinciis cum proconsulibus usque ad 
quinquagesimum miliarium a mari. quo scito paene totius terrarum orbis imperium 
uni uiro deferebatur; sed tamen idem hoc ante septennium in M. Antonio praetore 
decretum erat.
This evidence should be taken seriously, especially given that Velleius was at least 
familiar enough with Antonius command to appreciate that it derived from a senatus 
consultum (decretum erat)  in contrast with the later command of Pompeius (tribunus 
legem tulit) which followed the restoration of the tribunates power to legislate in 70. We 
may even assume that Velleius had access to Sallusts (now lost) description of Antonius 
command when he made this comparison.
Whilst the nature of Pompeius imperium has been the subject of much scholarly 
debate, the reference to his imperium aequum in omnibus prouinciis cum proconsulibus is 
best taken as a statement illustrating that he was elected as a promagistrate with imperium 
equal to all other promagistrates pro consule (i.e. with consulare imperium) in all of the 
prouinciae; Velleius does not need to mention that his imperium would, therefore, have 
been maius quam any magistrate or promagistrate with praetorium imperium (e.g. praetor 
or pro praetore).
 Whilst Antonius also probably received the same consulare imperium, 
 For the above formulation of the Gabinian law I follow Vervaet (2011), p.267 with Cic. Leg. Man. 52.  
 Vell. Pat. 2.31.2-4. I print here the Teubner text (ed. Watt), but note my earlier reservations concerning 
the emendation of biennium to septennium. 
 Woodman (1969) has shown that Velleius was clearly very much influenced by Sallust.  
 His consulare imperium is confirmed by Dio Cass. 36.37.1 ( ). See already Mommsen 
(1887), II, p.655, n.1: So weit die Statthalter Proprtoren waren, hatte also Pompeius ein imperium maius, 
den Proconsuln gegenber nicht. For a detailed discussion of Pompeius imperium with modern literature 
see now Girardet (2001), p.173-185 (esp. p.173-176), who rightly argues against the idea that Pompeius had 
an imperium maius than other proconsuls with consulare imperium.  
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
one can take idem hoc, as used in Velleius comparison, as referring to the (exaggerated) 
geographical extent of Pompeius imperium totius orbis terrarum rather than his genus 
imperii.
 It was, after all, the prouinciae of Antonius and Pompeius that were 
extraordinary rather than their consulare imperium per se.
 Velleius indicates that the 
commands were actually restricted to Italy and the existing prouinciae up to fifty miles 
from the sea, which is also recorded  though without specific reference to the prouinciae 
 by Appian, Plutarch and Dio.
 As we shall see, this could very well represent the 
definition of a prouincia (tota) ora maritima. 
It is unfortunate that the beginning of Cassius Dios description of the command is 
now missing from the surviving manuscripts, as this might have provided some important 
clues about the prouincia.
 Although we cannot now determine what was originally 
written before ...       ..., it is not impossible that the 
coastal regions  or the sea  were specifically referred to here as including the prouinciae 
(the ?) and, as in the surviving text, () Italy.
 Aside from the record of Velleius Paterculus, there is no other evidence to confirm that Antonius (as a 
praetor) received upgraded consulare imperium. IG IV
 1, 66, l.25 (Epidaurus: ) provides no clue 
about the imperium, whereas the inscription (IGRom. IV, 1116) cited by Marti (1971), p.263 and Brennan 
(2000), p.796, n.152 most probably refers to the activities of his father in Cilicia. Although there was no 
generalisation of imperium pro consule (i.e. awarded to all consular and praetorian commanders) under 
Sulla, as Willems (1885), II, p.571, n.5 suggested, it was common for praetors to be given upgraded 
consulare imperium for important prouinciae (e.g. the Hispaniae, Macedonia and Asia), for which see

IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
More concrete evidence for the notion that Pompeius command encompassed the 
ora maritima, which included Italy and the prouinciae, is to be found in Ciceros speech in 
favour of the Lex Manilia just one year after the passage of the Gabinian Law. He claimed, 
in typically rhetorical fashion, that the coastal regions had pleaded for Pompeius, since 
they saw that the praetors were being enriched every year and yet nothing was being 
gained in the name of their fleets aside from losses:  
Ora maritima, Quirites, Cn. Pompeium non solum propter rei militaris gloriam sed 
etiam propter animi continentiam requisiuit. Uidebat enim praetores locupletari 
quotannis pecunia publica praeter paucos, neque nos quicquam aliud adsequi 
classium nomine nisi ut detrimentis accipiendis maiore adfici turpitudine 
uideremur. Nunc qua cupiditate homines in prouincias, quibus iacturis quibusque 
condicionibus proficiscantur ignorant uidelicet isti qui ad unum deferenda omnia 
esse non arbitrantur.
The mention of praetores implies that the observations made by the ora maritima 
applied to the praetorian prouinciae, which, at the time, included Italy, Sicily, Sardinia-
Corsica, Hispania Citerior, Hispania Ulterior, Africa, Macedonia and Asia.
 Cicero 
regularly employs praetor as a standard term for praetorian commanders (including 
prorogued praetors with both praetorium imperium and consulare imperium), but never 
uses it for consular magistrates or promagistrates, whom he describes as proconsuls.
reference to the praetores may, therefore, have been a clever and subtle ploy to avoid any 
reference to Crete and the successful activities of the proconsul Q. Caecilius Metellus 
Creticus, who had been assigned Crete as his consular prouincia in 69 and who had 
 Cic. Leg. Man. 67. For the context and detailed analysis of the speech see Steel (2001), p.114-135 and 
Lintott (2008), App. 2, p.427-430.   
 For the presence of praetors in Italy at this time see Brennan (2000), p.434, who speculates that two 
praetors were captured in Etruria and around Brundisium just before Pompeius appointment (with Plut. 
Pomp. 24.6; App. Mith. 93; and Cic. Leg. Man. 33). For the addition of Asia to the praetorian sortitio in 69 
see Brennan (2000), p.564f with Dio Cass. 36.2.2. 
 See especially Giovannini (1983), p.60f with various examples. See also now Vervaet (2012a), p.68 with 
n.93: ...no consular proconsul is ever termed praetor, and no (propraetor) holding merely praetorium 
imperium ever proconsul. 
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
clashed with Pompeius in 67.
 In any case, Cicero takes the opportunity to question the 
argument of his opponents  in this case, the famous orator Q. Hortensius Hortalus  that 
more than one man should be entrusted with the command against the pirates, by alluding 
to the desires of the praetors to make financial gains in their prouinciae (and presumably 
also to recover the finances spent during their earlier candidacy for the praetorship).
Despite the rhetorical exaggeration, the ora maritima was presented to the audience of the 
contio as constituting both Italy and the various praetorian prouinciae throughout the 
Mediterranean.
This roughly corresponds with how Pompeius divided his vast prouincia maritima 
into a number of quasi-prouinciae under the supervision of legati pro praetore.
Groebe long ago illustrated that these divisions made use of the existing organisation of 
the Roman Empire and suggested that eleven of the thirteen districts related to existing 
prouinciae.
 It is notable that Appian mentions that Pompeius distributed his legati   
 This would have naturally helped him to avoid alienating those supporters of Metellus who were already 
aggrieved at Pompeius handling of the conflict, which is discussed in greater detail later in this section. 
 Cf. Cic. Leg. Man. 52. For the argument see further Steel (2001), p.115ff and Lintott (2008), App. 2, 
p.429. 
 Compare the complaints made in Sallusts Cotta speech that the coasts (maritima) of both Italy and the 
prouinciae were full of foes in 75 prior to the assignment of a similar command to Antonius (Hist. 2.47.7M, 
as quoted earlier). Note also Cic. Leg. Man. 55: Nos qui antea non modo Italiam tutam habebamus sed omnis 
socios in ultimis oris auctoritate nostri imperi saluos praestare poteramus, tum cum insula Delus tam procul 
a nobis in Aegaeo mari posita, quo omnes undique cum mercibus atque oneribus commeabant, referta 
diuitiis, parua, sine muro nihil timebat, idem non modo prouinciis atque oris Italiae maritimis ac portibus 
nostris sed etiam Appia iam uia carebamus. Cf. Cic. Leg. Man. 32. 
 I borrow the term quasi-prouinciae from Brennan (2000), p.426, who also rightly notes that at least 
some of Pompeius legati continued to serve with him during his Mithridatic command granted by the Lex 
Manilia of 66. For the legati see App. Mith. 94 (25 legati); Dio Cass. 36.37.1 (15 legati); Plut. Pomp. 25 (15 
legati); and 26 (24 legati). The discrepancies in the numbers given in the ancient sources are probably best 
explained by the idea that the original permission given to Pompeius to nominate 15 legati was increased, 
alongside other provisions, by a second comitial law, as suggested by Plut. Pomp. 26 (cf. Dio Cass. 37.36.1). 
Cf. Boak (1918), p.12; Brunt (1971), p.456f; Schleussner (1978), p.179f, n.217; and Ridley (1981), p.184. 
For the delegation of imperium pro praetore see Schleussner (1978), p.198f with n.338 (and especially App. 
Mith. 94) and also p.233f for a list of the known legati. 
 Groebe (1910), p.384-389 with summary and a map on p.388f. For a detailed comparison of the lists 
provided by Appian and Florus see also, more recently, Breglia (1970-71), esp. p.50-58. Some of Groebes 
cases are slightly too neat. For example, App. Mith. 95 refers to Lycia, Pamphylia, Cyprus and Phoenicia as 
being given to Q. Metellus Nepos, which Groebe links to Lycia and Pamphylia (p.388) and elsewhere 
suggests that Cilicia was the base of his undertaking (p.387). However, as argued in Ch.IV.ii, Lycia and the 
region of Pamphylia west of Side were not usually defined as part of the prouincia Cilicia. Likewise, Cn. 
Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus was given Africa, which extended as far as Cyrene, for which see Reynolds 
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
 when he was granted a grain commission in 57, which was directly comparable in 
terms of its scope with his command against the pirates ten years earlier.
 It is possible 
that Appian uses  to refer to the prouinciae rather than simply nations and, if 
correct, it follows that Pompeius would have probably done the same thing ten years 
earlier.
 Cicero, for example, reported in 66 that Pompeius first activities were around 
Sicily, Sardinia and Africa and that he then secured the protection of the two Hispaniae 
(i.e. Citerior and Ulterior) and Gallia Transalpina  i.e. all areas associated with existing 
geographical prouinciae.
 The individual assignments of Pompeius legati could very 
well, therefore, represent divisions of the ora maritima vis--vis the various prouinciae.
Indeed, Pliny explicitly records that Pompeius gave monetary rewards to his legati and 
quaestores, qui oras maris defendissent, as part of his triumph celebration in 61.
(1962). Groebe (1910), p.386 and p.388 suggests that Cyrene would have been considered too remote to 
warrant its own legatus. Despite these reservations, Groebes thesis that the existing prouinciae were utilised 
is convincing and almost certainly not coincidental (e.g. Hispania Citerior, Hispania Ulterior, Africa, 
Sardinia-Corsica, Sicily, Macedonia, Bithynia, Asia, Gallia Narbonensis and Achaia).  
 App. B Ciu. 2.18. For a direct comparison between the commands of 67 and 57 see Dio Cass. 39.9.3: 
 [Cicero]       ,      
           .   ,    
 ,      <>        
    . Cf. Cic. Att. 4.1.7 (around 10 September, 57) explaining to Atticus 
that the consuls had drawn up a law, qua Pompeio per quinquennium omnis potestas rei frumentariae toto 
orbe terrarum daretur...; and also Plut. Pomp. 49.4 who credits Cicero with once more () winning for 
Pompeius authority over land and sea. 
  is certainly used by Appian on a number of occassions for prouinciae (e.g. B Ciu. 2.23; 2.26; 2.32; 
and 2.48), but he also uses it to refer to peoples and nations (e.g. B Ciu. 1.13; 2.73; 2.89; and 2.101).  
 Cic. Leg. Man. 34-35: qui [Pompeius] nondum tempestiuo ad nauigandum mari Siciliam adiit, Africam 
explorauit, inde Sardiniam cum classe uenit atque haec tria frumentaria subsidia rei publicae firmissimis 
praesidiis classibusque muniuit. Inde cum se in Italiam recepisset, duabus Hispaniis et Gallia Transalpina

nauibus Italiae duo maria maximis classibus firmissimisque praesidiis adornauit... Cf. Plut. Pomp. 26 (67 
B.C.) and 50 (57 B.C.). 
 In comparison, it is notable that Octavian placed a certain C. Baebius in charge of the ora maritima 
Hispaniae citerioris (i.e. of the existing prouincia Hispania Citerior) within the context of the Actium war in 
31: C. Baebius T. f. Clu. | tr. mi[l. leg.] XX, praef. | ora[e marit. His]pan. | citer[ioris b]ello | Actiensi, IIIIuir.

 Plin. HN. 37.16.  
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
Pliny also presents the overall success of Pompeius command in very similar 
terms by citing the praefatio of Pompeius triumph of 61, which explicitly boasts that he 
had liberated the ora maritima:
cum oram maritimam praedonibus liberasset et imperium maris populo Romano 
restituisset ex Asia Ponto Armenia Paphlagonia Cappadocia Cilicia Syria Scythis 
Iudaeis Albanis Hiberia insula Creta Basternis et super haec de rege Mithridate 
atque Tigrane triumphauit.
There are good reasons to believe that the quotation derived from an actual 
inscription on a placard describing the triumph and, perhaps, even the senatus consultum 
which approved it.
 Although Appian and Plutarch give differing descriptions of the 
inscriptions displayed in the triumph, this can be explained by the fact that neither of them 
claim to quote the praefatio triumphi and so probably refer to other inscriptions.
formulaic nature of Plinys text gives it some credibility, especially when it is compared 
with the Fasti Triumphales and other tituli.
 Furthermore, a fragment of Diodorus 
Siculus, who was writing much closer to the time, reports a dedicatory inscription with a 
very similar  though much more elaborate  beginning and also includes the claim that 
Pompeius liberated the seacoast of the  from the pirate war.
 Diodorus (or 
his source) probably does not quote from the same record as Pliny, but one can imagine 
that he preserves the terms with which Pompeius advertised his success (both in Rome and

 Plin. HN. 7.98. Cf. Plin. HN. 7.97: postea ad tota maria et deinde solis ortus missus... 
 See Palmer (1990), p.4, n.8 who raises the possibility that the quotation was from a senatus consultum.  
 App. Mith. 117 and Plut. Pomp. 45.1-3.  
 See Vogel-Wiedemann (1985), p.60f, who makes a comparison with the surviving tituli, especially C. 
Marius elogium from Arretium (ILS 59). It should also be noted that Degrassi reconstructed the fragmentary 
entry for Pompeius triumph of 61 in the Fasti Triumphales on the basis of Plinys quotation above: [Cn. 
Pompeius Cn. f. Sex. n. Magnus III], pro co(n)s(ule), a. DCXCII | [ex Asia, Ponto, Armenia, Paphla]gonia, 
Cappadoc(ia), | [Cilicia, Syria, Scytheis, Iudaeeis, Alb]ania, pirateis | [per biduum III, pridie k. O]cto. (Inscr. 
Ital. XIII, 1, p.84f; and p.566). On the reference to Asia compare Girardet (1991) with further bibliography.  
 Diod. Sic. 40.4.1:           
        ...  
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
in the East).
 It follows that Pompeius would have also made similar claims in his 
triumph request outside the pomerium and, following the necessary senatorial approval, 
these would have then likely been mentioned in his praefatio triumphi (as quoted by 
Pliny).  
This may also account for Velleius statement  clearly drawing on the same 
tradition  that Pompeius liberated the orbis terrarum (cf.  above) from pirates 
after distributing ships to almost all the corners of the sea.
 If such a claim was made by 
Pompeius during his triumph request, as suggested above, we can further speculate that it 
would have been directly related to his successful completion of the task associated with 
his prouincia (i.e. the ora maritima and the war against the pirates).
In sum, the combination of the evidence from Cicero, Pliny and Diodorus, together 
with the comparable command of M. Antonius Creticus and the distribution of Pompeius 
legati, indicates that the ora maritima was the name of the area over which Pompeius had 
authority in 67 (and which he later claimed to have liberated from the pirates). 
Furthermore, as we shall see, the ancient authors also make a direct comparison between 
Pompeius command and the extraordinary assignment of the classis et ora maritima 
granted to his youngest son, Sextus Pompeius, ex senatus consulto in 43.
preliminary conclusion to be drawn from the above evidence, then, is that the ora maritima 
was included as part of Pompeius prouincia and that this was likely to have consisted of 
Italy and the existing prouinciae up to fifty miles from the sea. We can add that Pompeius 
was probably also given an explicit mandate to utilise the coastal regions associated with 
 Against the communis opinio, Vogel-Wiedemann (1985) raises the interesting possibility that Diodorus 
was quoting from a dedicatory inscription set up in the Greek East around 62 rather than a record of the 
actual triumph inscription. Cf. Nicolet (1991), p.32f. 
 Vell. Pat. 2.32.4: At Cn. Pompeius, multis et praeclaris uiris in id bellum adsumptis discriptoque paene in 
omnes recessus maris praesidio nauium, breui inexsuperabili manu terrarum orbem liberauit praedonesque 
per multa <mari>a multis locis uictos circa Ciliciam classe adgressus fudit ac fugauit... 
 For the connection between the award and celebration of a triumph and the prouincia see Ch.III.iv. 
 Ch.V.iii. 
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
kings, rulers, peoples and cities which were not otherwise considered to be part of the 
Roman prouinciae (e.g. Cyprus, Egypt, Cyrene etc.).
Despite the above evidence, some scholars have wrongly thought that the 
prouinciae assigned to Antonius and Pompeius were only functionally defined as the war 
against the pirates.
 Indeed, there is evidence suggesting that prouinciae were not 
normally defined only in terms of wars. It is worth discussing this in greater detail, since it 
has important implications not only for determining how the commands of Antonius and 
Pompeius were defined, but also for our general understanding of prouinciae.  
Livys records of the third and second centuries show that prouinciae were 
understood as being distinct from the assignment of a war against a particular enemy  
although the two aspects were intrinsically related to one another.
 For example, the 
 Cf. App. Mith. 94:             
  ... Cf. Plut. Pomp. 25.2:          
   ,           
. I suspect that this partially accounts for Tacitus comparison between Pompeius and Cn. 
Domitius Corbulus, who was assigned Galatia-Cappadocia as his prouincia in 63: scribitur tetrarchis ac 
regibus praefectisque et procuratoribus et qui praetorum finitimas prouincias regebant iussis Corbulonis 
obsequi, in tantum ferme modum aucta potestate quem populus Romanus Cn. Pompeio bellum piraticum 
gesturo dederat... (Ann. 15.25.3). Aside from the comparable letters sent to kings, Tacitus also makes a 
comparison, in his typically condensed style, between the imperium granted to Pompeius and Corbulo. I am 
in full agreement with Vervaet (2000) that Tacitus statement refers to the fact that Corbulos imperium was 
defined as maius quam the praetorian governors (indicated with praetores) of the nearby prouinciae Caesaris 
(Lycia-Pamphylia and Syria) and aequum with the proconsuls of the neighbouring prouinciae populi Romani 
(Asia and Bithynia). As noted earlier, this is exactly how the relationship between Pompeius and other 
imperium-holders should be understood.  
 E.g. Kallet-Marx (1995), p.317: As [the Lex Gabinia] passed in its final form, Pompey was granted for 
three years a provincia that was not territorially but only functionally defined  the war against the pirates  
and most likely with imperium superior to all others within fifty miles of the sea. Cf. also Girardet (2001), 
p.171 (the prouincia of M. Antonius as Krieg gegen die Seeruber); p.175 and p.178 (Pompeius prouincia 
as Kampf gegen die Piraterie and Krieg gegen die Piraterie); and also p.161 and p.178 for the suggestion 
that Pompeius prouincia was the bellum Asiaticum regiumque after the promulgation of the Lex Manilia in 
66. Cf. Richardson (2008), p.110f. 
 Richardson (1986), p.5 oversimplifies the issue when he argues that the war with Hannibal could be the 
name of a provincia (cf. Richardson (1994), p.564) and the two examples he cites are not compelling. In the 
first, Livy is clearly summarising the arrangements made at the start of the year: itaque prouinciae atque 
exercitus diuisi: bellum cum Hannibale consulibus mandatum et exercituum unus quem ipse Sempronius 
habuerat, alter quem Fabius consul... (24.44.1). This is even more apparent in the second example: 
consulibus bellum cum Hannibale et binae legiones decretae... (25.3.3). In both cases, the sortes or 
prouinciae are not explicitly named and it is possible that the war with Hannibal was actually decreed to the 
consuls separately from (or alongside) the consular sortitio (like the legions). Cf. Drogula (2011), p.93 and 
p.97, who imprecisely interprets Livys Ligures (39.38.1-2) as simply war against the Ligurians. 
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
consul P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica was assigned a prouincia Italia with specific 
instructions to conduct the war against the Boii in 191.
 As we discussed in Chapter III, 
when his triumph request was obstructed by a tribune of the plebs on the grounds that he 
had not assisted with the Ligurian war, Scipio responded that he had not been allotted the 
Ligures as his prouincia and that he had not been at war with the Ligures. Instead, he 
argued that he had left no enemy in his own prouincia and, therefore, deserved his 
triumph.
 This suggests that the prouincia was viewed as an area (Italia) rather than a 
specific war, which was separately defined.
Significantly, the other consular lot was first designated as quo senatus censuisset  
eam esse bellum aduersus Antiochum regem omnes sciebant in 191.
 Bertrand rightly 
highlighted that the reference to quo (wherever) must have geographical connotations 
and suggests that a war  e.g. bellum aduersus Antiochum, which he terms la glose  
could have only been defined through the designation of a particular area.
 Indeed, the 
consul was subsequently allotted Graecia.
Furthermore, I discussed in the previous section how C. Claudius Nero (cos.) and 
M. Livius Salinator (cos.) were allotted the Bruttii and Lucani aduersus Hannibalem and 
 Livy, 36.1.9 and 36.2.1-2. 
 See Livy, 36.39.6-10 and 36.40.1-10 with Ch.III.iv. 
 This can be compared with the prorogation of P. Cornelius Scipio (pro cos.) with a prouincia Africa in 
203 and 202 when the completion of the war in Africa (bellum in Africa) was apparently a separate  though, 
again, closely related  matter, which was decided by the people in 202 (cf. Livy, 30.1.10-11 and 30.27.1-4). 
 Livy, 35.41.3-4. 
 Bertrand (1989), p.201f. This overall sentiment is aptly characterised by Livy when he suggests that one 
might have thought that Hannibal had been assigned the prouincia Italia and had been given a mandate to 
make war on Rome at the beginning of the Second Punic War (21.5.1). Further evidence for this connection 
(and separation) between the prouincia and bellum can be seen in e.g. Livy, 26.1.1-2 (211 B.C.: Cn. Fuluius 
Centumalus P. Sulpicius Galba consules cum idibus Martiis magistratum inissent, senatu in Capitolium 
uocato, de re publica, de administratione belli, de prouinciis exercitibusque patres consuluerunt); Livy, 
27.35.5-6 (208 B.C.: ...in consules designatos omnes uersi quam primum eos sortiri prouincias et 
praesciscere quam quisque eorum prouinciam, quem hostem haberet uolebant); Livy, 28.10.8-9 (206 B.C.: 
...Bruttii ambobus [consuls] ut cum Hannibale bellum gererent prouincia decreta); 28.45.9 (205 B.C.: alteri 
[consul] Bruttii et bellum cum Hannibale); and 38.58.8 (187 B.C., but reflecting on 190 B.C.: L. Scipionem, 
de quo agatur, ut, quae in Hispania, quae in Africa, cum legatus fratris esset, gessisset, praetereantur, 
consulem et ab senatu dignum habitum, cui extra sortem Asia prouincia et bellum cum Antiocho rege 
decerneretur...). 
 Livy, 36.1.6 and 36.2.1-2. 
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
the prouincia Gallia aduersus Hasdrubalem respectively in 207, which Livy abbreviates 
as Bruttii and Gallia.
 In this case, Livy later reports that Claudius felt that it was not in 
the interest of the res publica for each consul to conduct the war with the enemy resolved 
by the Senate in the (geographical) limits of his prouincia by means of their own 
armies:
 the enemy, the prouincia and the army were all, therefore, connected, yet 
arguably distinguishable, aspects of a magistrates assignment. 
Comparable evidence can be found in some of the major prouinciae named in the 
first century, despite the loss of Livys History after 167. According to Plutarch, L. 
Licinius Lucullus (cos.) tried to prevent a prouincia Cilicia from being assigned to another 
magistrate precisely because he realised that, if he managed to obtain this prouincia, 
nobody else would be sent to make war against Mithridates in 74.
 He was subsequently 
assigned the prouincia Cilicia  to which the prouincia Asia was added  with additional 
special instructions to pursue Mithridates; and his colleague, M. Aurelius Cotta (cos.), was 
given a prouincia Bithynia et Pontum with instructions to protect Bithynia and the 
Propontis with a fleet.
 Additionally, Dio records that C. Manilius (tr. pl.) promulgated a 
 Livy, 27.35.10-12. Cf. Ch.IV.iii. 
 Livy, 27.43.6-7: ...tum Claudius non id tempus esse rei publicae ratus quo consiliis ordinariis prouinciae 
suae quisque finibus per exercitus suos cum hoste destinato ab senatu bellum gereret... For the rationale see 
Ch.IV.iii and for the subsequent triumph celebrations of Claudius and Livius see Ch.III.v.

 See Cic. Mur. 33: Ad quod bellum duobus consulibus ita missis ut alter Mithridatem persequeretur, alter

For the prouinciae see generally Plut. Pomp. 5-6. Cf. Memnon, FGrH 434 F 27.1:    
      ,      ,   
  . I base the name of Cottas prouincia primarily on the comparable command 
granted to M. Acilius Glabrio (cos.) in 67 B.C: Legiones Valerianae conperto lege Gabinia Bithyniam et 
Pontum consuli datam, sese missos esse (Sall. Hist. 5 fr. 13M). The assignment of a fleet to Cotta for the 
protection of Bithynia and the Propontis is comparable with the instructions given to M. Valerius Laevinus 
(pr.) to protect the coastal region between Brundisium and Tarentum with 25 ships in 215 (Livy, 23.32.16-
18); and it represents another example of a fleet being used as a military resource within the context of 
another prouincia, for which see Chs.III.iii and III.viii. For further references see MRR II, p.100f and p.106-
108 s.v. Additional Note. Cf. Kallet-Marx (1995), p.301f with n.38.  
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
law that later simultaneously attached Pompeius to the war with Mithridates and Tigranes 
and the prouincia of Bithynia and Cilicia in 66.
 These examples suggest that the name 
of a prouincia and a war, though closely related to each other, were still separately 
assigned in the Late Republic.
It is, therefore, improbable that the prouinciae of Antonius and Pompeius were 
defined only in terms of their function against the pirates.
 As argued above, it is far 
more likely that a prouincia (tota) ora maritima was named in both instances  most 
probably defined as including the land in all of the existing prouinciae up to fifty miles 
from the sea  together with the general mandate concerning the war with the pirates.
we have seen, military assignments could be defined in both geographical and functional 
terms simultaneously in the third, second and first centuries. 
Having determined how the extraordinary prouinciae of Antonius and Pompeius 
were defined in 75/74 and 67, the political implications of these commands can now be 
assessed. This is especially important given that the assignment of such wide-ranging 
prouinciae to single commanders constituted a significant break with the earlier customary 
 Dio Cass. 36.42.4: ...          ,    
      . I take  as meaning the prouincia (of Bithynia and 
Cilicia), for which see Mason (1974), p.110-113, esp. p.110: The sense of [ as a]  provincia is closely 
allied to that of magistratus, especially when provincia has the meaning of assigned command, sphere of 
influence rather than a purely territorial meaning.  is used in this way by Dio Cassius... Cf. Plut. 
Pomp. 30.1, who mentions only Bithynia and the war with Mithridates and Tigranes.  
 Further examples can be cited, although the ancient sources often summarise the overall intention of the 
prouincia (e.g. war with Mithridates). Note especially Appians descriptions of how L. Cornelius Sulla (cos.) 
received the command of Asia and the Mithridatic war in the consular sortitio of 88:    
,           ... (Mith. 22); and 
...           ... (B Ciu. 
1.55). The same applies to the report in Livys Periochae that C. Trebonius (tr. pl.) proposed a lex de 
prouinciis consularibus which would grant Syria et Parthicum bellum to M. Licinius Crassus (cos.) in 55 
(Per. 105), for which cf. Plut. Pomp. 52.3 (     ); Crass. 15.7 
(    ...); Cat. Min. 43 (  ); and Dio Cass. 39.33.2 
(   ). 
 The reference in Cic. Leg. Man. 52 to the lex Gabinia de uno imperatore contra praedones constituendo 
only refers to the name of the law and does not reveal how the prouincia would be defined. Cf. Dio Cass. 
36.23.4; Plut. Pomp. 25.1; and Luc. 37.4. 
 Cf. Hurlet (1997), p.257-261. 
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
use of the prouincia as a means of separating imperium-holders either in space or by 
function within the same space. Indeed, I suggested in an earlier section of this chapter that 
the coastal city of Side may have been deliberately used to demarcate the Cilician naval 
command assigned to M. Antonius  most probably named as a prouincia Cilicia  from 
the prouincia Asia around 103/102.
 In contrast, the Mediterranean-wide prouinciae 
granted to Antonius and Pompeius were only geographically demarcated from the other 
existing prouinciae beyond fifty miles from the sea. Furthermore, their commands were 
not even functionally separated from other imperium-holders: although both Antonius and 
Pompeius had been assigned the war against pirates, the other magistrates and 
promagistrates with prouinciae with coastal regions would have viewed such activities as a 
natural part of their own duties.
As neither Antonius nor Pompeius were tied to a single geographical region, they 
were not affected by the old prohibition  as enshrined in the leges maiestatis of the 
previous fifty years or so  restricting the movement of a magistrate or promagistrate 
outside of their prouincia. We can even speculate that this was a deliberate intention of the 
senatorial decree of 75/74 and the Lex Gabinia of 67, which granted the commands. As a 
result, though, as we have seen in the previous section, one of the underlying principles 
associated with the established mos maiorum and the more recent leges maiestatis was 
fatally undermined: Antonius and Pompeius, having been assigned Mediterranean-wide 
prouinciae, were not separated from the imperium-holders in the other named prouinciae 
 Ch.IV.ii. 
 I do not agree with the hypothesis proposed by Girardet (2001), p.175 that Pompeius command was 
defined in terms so that, niemandes imperium soll dem des Pompeius bergeordnet sein, wenn er im 
Interesse seiner prouincia Kampf gegen die Piraterie... with the following result: ...da ihm kein 
Magistrat oder Promagistrat mit imperium (praetorium oder) consulare etwas untersagen darf, was er im 
Kstenbereich rmischer Provinzen zum Zwecke der Kriegfhrung gegen die Seeruber anordnet. The 
distinction between what constituted the pirate war and warfare associated with another prouincia (e.g. Creta 
and the Cretan war) would have been blurred. This is what actually led to the conflicts which will be 
described next. See also now Vervaet (2012b), p.125-128 for the fact that Pompeius was not invested with 
the summum imperium auspiciumque, as Girardet implicitly suggests vis--vis the pirate war, despite being 
initially proposed by A. Gabinius (tr. pl.). 
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
and there was, therefore, nothing stopping them interfering in aliena prouincia (up to fifty 
miles from the sea) and clashing with other commanders over gloria.
 Three significant 
consequences can be observed in the case of Pompeius, which, as stressed throughout this 
research, were exactly what the Senate had traditionally sought to avoid.  
I) There was the well-known clash between Pompeius and Q. Caecilius Metellus 
Creticus (pro cos.), who had been assigned Crete as his consular prouincia, together with 
the war against the Cretans, in 69.
 The dispute began when the Cretans sent 
ambassadors to offer their surrender to Pompeius, who, at the time, was in Pamphylia, 
rather than Metellus.
 Pompeius responded by sending a legatus to accept the invitation 
and even told the Cretans to ignore Metellus, but the latter stood his ground and sent the 
legatus away.
 Florus states that Pompeius had no effect in aliena prouincia  a phrase, 
which, as we have seen, was usually employed to indicate that an individual was operating 
outside his own prouincia (in contravention of custom and, at this time, law).
 Yet, in 
this case, Crete was legally part of both the prouinciae of Metellus and Pompeius.
overlap, contrary to the previous custom of separating commanders either in space or by 
function, was the underlying factor which led to the dangerous dispute between two 
 Cf. Ch.IV.iii. 
 See Dio Cass. 36.1a (Xiphilinus) referring to the sors as the    , which is almost 
certainly an abbreviation. The Scholia Bobiensia took the prouincia as Creta and is conceivably drawing on 
the tradition of Sallust, given the reference to the ora maritima of M. Antonius and the fact Sallusts 
Historiae went down to 67 (Schol. Bob, p.96 Stangl). Eutr. 6.11.1  presumably following the Livian 
tradition  may also preserve the fuller sense of the prouincia as constituting the geographical island and the 
war with the Cretans: ...bellum Creticum ortum est. Ad id missus Q. Caecilius Metellus ingentibus proeliis 
intra triennium omnem prouinciam cepit apellatusque est Creticus atque ex insula triumphauit. Cf. Livy, 
Per. 98: Q. Metellus procos. bello aduersus Cretenses mandato Cydoniam urbem obsedit. For the declaration 
of war see Cic. Verr. 2.2.76 and App. Sic. 6.1.   
 Cic. Leg. Man. 35; 46; Flor. 1.42.5; Plut. Pomp. 29.2; and App. Sic. 6.2. 
 Plut. Pomp. 29.2-5; Flor. 1.42.5; and App. Sic. 6.2.  
 Flor. 1.42.6. Cf. Ch.IV.iii. 
 This is emphasised by Plut. Pomp. 29.2 referring to the island: ...      
        . Cf. Jameson (1970), p.551, who rightly 
highlights that Cicero referred to Cretan ambassadors when arguing for a new command for Pompeius, 
which further suggests that Pompeius was within his rights (Leg. Man. 34 and 46). Cf. App. Sic. 6.2; Plut. 
Pomp. 29.1; and Livy, Per. 99.  
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
commanders with equal imperium; and it almost even resulted in armed clashes.
 Livys 
Periochae neatly summarises the problem  caused by the non-separation of the 
commanders  with the report that, queritur Q. Metellus gloriam sibi rerum a se gestarum 
a Pompeio praeuerti...
 The dispute also extended into Italy, since Metellus own 
triumph was significantly delayed by senatorial opposition;
 and the Cretan leaders, 
Panares and Lasthenes, were prevented from being led in his triumph because Pompeius 
had reportedly managed to convince a tribune of the plebs that they had surrendered to 
 As demonstrated in the previous chapters, the potential for serious conflicts over 
military gloria, both in the field and during the triumph requests, was one of the 
fundamental reasons why prouinciae were usually separated.
II) Pompeius assignment of such a huge prouincia for a period of three years 
restricted the opportunities for others to acquire their own gloria. This would have almost 
certainly added to the existing jealous political environment associated with aristocratic 
competition:
 there was no annual change in the command, no division of responsibilities 
among more than one independent imperium-holder and certainly no separation of land 
and naval commands through the naming of a prouincia classis.
 The general sentiment 
 If we believe Dio, Pompeius was even preparing to sail against Crete and Metellus before he learnt of his 
new command against Mithridates (36.45.1). See further Dio Cass. 36.18-19 and Plut. Pomp. 29.2-5 for the 
report of armed clashes between the armies of L. Cornelius Sisenna (pr. 78), Pompeius legatus (assigned to 
Macedonia/Greece), and Metellus. See generally Brennan (2000), p.408. 
 Livy, Per. 99. Cf. Vell. Pat. 2.34.2: <Ne> ab huius quidem usura gloriae temperauit animum Cn. 
Pompeius quin uictoriae partem conaretur uindicare. 
 Sall. Cat. 30.3-4. 
 Dio Cass. 36.19.3. This probably meant that Pompeius had found a tribune of the plebs that was willing to 
veto a motion favouring Metellus claim to the captives (or, much less likely, that a plebiscitum was passed 
in Pompeius favour). Cf. Vell. Pat. 2.40.5; Plut. Pomp. 29.4-5; Flor. 1.42.6; and 2.13.9. 
 It is also worth noting that the consul C. Calpurnius Piso interfered with Pompeius levies in Translapine 
Gaul (his consular prouinciae together with Cisalpine Gaul) and in Italy (Dio Cass. 36.37.2; and Plut. Pomp. 
27.1-2, who characterises Pisos actions as being down to  and ). See generally Gruen (1968), 
p.156-159 and now Vervaet (2011), p.284-290. 
 For the opposition to the assignment in the Senate see Watkins (1987), who points out that Plutarch refers 
to the senatorial opposition as consisting of the    rather than the whole Senate 
(Pomp. 25.3). With this in mind, we can imagine that other senators supported the measure. See now 
especially Morstein-Marx (2004), p.179-182 with n.83. 
 Cf. Livy, 9.18.13-17 for a very different characterisation of the Republican system (written in the 20s 
when many of the conditions he describes had disappeared). 
IV.iv. M. Antonius Creticus, Cn. Pompeius Magnus and the prouincia (tota) ora maritima in the first century   
is expressed by Dio in a speech he gives to Q. Lutatius Catulus, in which one of his main 
arguments against the Lex Gabinia alludes to the resentment of the elected magistrates 
(who were perfectly capable of taking command themselves).
 Furthermore, he argues 
that the Senate should select their own commanders and give them independent imperium 
so that they could attain their own glory (i.e. instead of allowing Pompeius to claim the 
credit for the actions of his legati with delegated imperium pro praetore).
 Dio also 
reports that L. Roscius Otho (tr. pl.) even suggested that another commander should also 
be chosen.
 The appointment of another commander would have most probably led to the 
creation of two separate prouinciae; and one can presume that this would have been 
divided geographically.
 In any case, none of the above proposals were accepted and so 
Pompeius was able to monopolise the all of the gloria from the pirate war.    
III) Additionally, the undivided (and huge) prouincia tota ora maritima, alongside 
the eastern command against Mithridates and Tigranes from 66, provided Pompeius with a 
unique opportunity to present his victories in much grander language than ever before  
e.g. in terms of the liberation of the orbis terrarum or .
 I raised the possibility 
in Chapter III that the individualistic nature of T. Quinctius Flamininus command in 
Macedonia/Greece between 198 and 194 may have encouraged the Senate to name the 
 Dio Cass. 36.33.1-3. See generally Steel (2001), p.114-123. Lintott (1997), p.2521f suggests that the 
speech has probably been transposed from its real occasion in 66 to 67 BC, but it remains possible that 
Catulus made a speech against both the Lex Gabinia and Lex Manilia (as Q. Hortensius Hortalus did) and 
that Dio simply combined them. Although the speech was composed by Dio, I think that it could still reflect 
some of the actual concerns and arguments of the time. See further Millar (1964), p.78-83 and Morstein-
Marx (2004), p.182, n.91. Cf. Rodgers (2008) for an overly pessimistic view of the use of the speech as a 
historical source. 
 Dio Cass. 36.36.1-2. The argument that this would increase the effectiveness of the various commanders 
may be weak  as suggested by Steel (2001), p.121  but the idea would undoubtedly have appealed to a 
number of the (competitive) senators, who would have been eager for their own glory. 
 Dio Cass. 36.30.3. Cf. the arguments made by Q. Hortensius Hortalus against the Lex Manilia (and 
probably also against the Lex Gabinia), as reported in Cic. Leg. Man. 52: Quid igitur ait Hortensius? Si uni 
omnia tribuenda sint, dignissimum esse Pompeium, sed ad unum tamen omnia deferri non oportere. 
 Roscius was almost certainly not suggesting that there should be a division of functions through the 
naming of a prouincia classis, but it is worth noting that this was at least one way in which another 
magistrate (or promagistrate) would have been able to acquire their own gloria (and, perhaps, a triumphus 
naualis) from within the same geographical area as Pompeius.  
 See e.g. Harris (1979), p.5; North (1993); and Schuler (2007), p.393f.  
classis as a praetorian sors between 192 and 189.
 This measure would have prevented 
one individual from monopolising all of the glory associated with a particular war.
hardly needs to be stressed that the political landscape, as well as the Roman view of their 
empire, had dramatically changed since Flamininus command and since the last time that 
a prouincia classis was named (probably in 149). Indeed, the scope and definition of the 
command granted to Pompeius in 67 and the ways in which his victories were later 
presented presupposes the development of a collective notion of empire. 
This last point will be discussed in the final section of this chapter, which will 
examine the circumstances under which the collective concept of the ora maritima might 
have been formed between the third and first centuries. This development, after all, would 
have made possible the formulation of the assignments of Antonius and Pompeius in the 
terms described above.

IV.v. The development of the ora maritima and world empire between the third and 
first centuries 
The commands of Antonius and Pompeius in 75/74 and 67 provide the first evidence for a 
collective, even all-encompassing, meaning of the ora maritima and it is difficult to trace 
its earlier development in great detail.
 As far as I am aware, the first reference to a 
singular collective ora maritima is from Ciceros speech for the Manilian law in 66, as 
quoted in the previous section.
 Nonetheless, it is reasonable to assume that originally it 
would have been used to refer to a small area on the coast around Rome and that its 
meaning gradually expanded during the various stages of Roman conquest.
example, after the First Samnite War (343-341) and Latin War (340-338), the ora 
maritima could have been used to represent a wider area  associated with the Roman 
sphere of influence  around Latium and Campania.
 Later its meaning could have 
encompassed Italy  perhaps after either the foundation of coloniae on the Adriatic coast 
or the wars with King Pyrrhus of Epirus (c. 280-275);
 and, later still, the various 
individual coastal regions beyond Italy, starting with the acquisition of western Sicily and 
the regular naming of a prouincia Sicilia after the First Punic War (264-241).
 Livy describes the appointment of L. Quinctius Flamininus as a legatus for the cura maritimae orae, but 
this was almost certainly restricted to the prouincia (Macedonia), which was allotted to his commander T. 
Quinctius Flamininus (Livy, 32.8.4 and 32.16.2). For this command see further Ch.III.viii.  
 Cic. Leg. Man. 67. 
 E.g. Livy, 7.25.4 (349 B.C.): mare infestum classibus Graecorum erat oraque litoris Antiatis Laurensque 
tractus et Tiberius ostia... Cf. Livy, 7.25.12-13 and note Oakley (1998), p.233 s.v. 4. Oraque litoris 
Antiatis: ...in this coupling litoris refers to the shore, ora to its margin... For the operations see Livy, 
7.26.10-15. 
 See e.g. Livy, 9.38.2-3 (310 B.C.): ...classis Romana a P. Cornelio, quem senatus maritimae orae 
praefecerat, in Campaniam acta cum adpulsa Pompeios esset, socii inde nauales ad depopulandum agrum 
Nucerinum profecti, proximis raptim uastatis unde reditus tutus ad naues esset, dulcedine, ut fit, praedae 
longius progressi exciuere hostes. Cf. Oakley (2005a), p.483f. 
 For the coloniae maritimae see generally Salmon (1969), p.70-81 and Mason (1992). For the problems 
associated with the terminology see Bispham (2006), p.78ff. See also Bispham (2007), p.54-56 for the 
importance of the Pyrrhic Wars and Roman conquests in the third century for the development of the notion 
of a collective Italy. 
 For the naming of the prouincia Sicilia see now Prag (2012a) and Ch.III.i. It is worth noting that Bispham 
(2007), p.67f plausibly suggests that a technical sense of terra Italia (i.e. denoting non-Gallic Italy), 
may have appeared as Rome began to acquire spheres of interest in Sicily, Sardinia and the Po valley, 
IV.v. The development of the ora maritima and world empire between the third and first centuries   
Yet, the ora maritima did not necessarily relate only to the geo-political situation 
of Italy and the prouinciae: as Purcell suggested, it could also have been a concept for the 
organisation of human resources rather than a simple geographical term, inclusive of 
bases, shelter, food, water and allies, etc.
 With this in mind, the scope of the meaning of 
the ora maritima may, then, have expanded not only with the naming of prouinciae  and 
the territorial growth of empire  but also with the incorporation of new resources within 
the wider sphere of Roman influence or hegemony.
 It would, however, be wrong to 
conclude simply from these preliminary observations that the addition of more (and more 
distant) coastal regions under Roman hegemony must necessarily have led directly to the 
creation of a collective  or cumulative  sense of the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. 
There would have been more complex issues at stake associated with Roman perceptions 
of their empire; and these will be explored now through discussion of several illuminating 
examples.  
Starting in the early second century, Appian makes an intriguing reference to C. 
Livius Salinator (pr.) as the    (guardian of Italy) after he had been 
allotted a prouincia classis in 191.
 This phrase was unlikely to have been invented by 
Appian. We may even speculate that it goes back to Polybius, although there are no other 
examples of this exact formula in Polybius or any other surviving ancient Greek literary 
leading to the need to differentiate overseas territories from those of the Italian alliance... One might apply 
the same logic to the Romes sense of the ora maritima Italiae. 
 Purcell (1996), p.274. Evidence supporting this idea is to be found in e.g. Cic. Flac. 30, who describes 
sinus, promunturia, litora, insulae and urbes maritimae being restored to the Roman imperium following the 
bellum maritimum. See also Plut. Pomp. 49.4-5 (referring to Pompeius grain commission in 57): '  
  , ,  ,  ,    ,   
. See also Ch.V.v for evidence that Sextus Pompeius made use of the resources of the ora 
maritima. 
 Compare e.g. the letters that Rome sent to the kings of Cyprus, Egypt, Cyrene and Syria around 100 
asking them to prohibit pirates using their territories (RS, no. 12, Delphi Copy, Block B, ll. 8-14 and cf. 
Cnidos Copy, col. III, ll. 28-41). Note also App. Mith. 94 for letters being sent to kings, rulers, peoples and 
cities to give Pompeius assistance in 67, as quoted in Ch.IV.iv.  
 App. Syr. 22:        ,      ,  
    ,     ,    ,  
          ... For the prouincia  
see the earlier discussion in Ch.III.iii. 
IV.v. The development of the ora maritima and world empire between the third and first centuries   
source.
 The phrase may also be a translation of the Latin equivalent  custos Italiae  
but this is not present in the comparable account in Livys History.
 In any case, it 
appears to have been an honorific rather than official title and there are several reasons 
why it could have been employed in this way around 191. One possibility is that it was 
used to emphasise the need for Italian unity in the face of the threat of Antiochus III 
from the East. The rationale for this may have been to encourage (and ease) the collection 
of men and ships from other towns in Italy, which was especially relevant in 191 given the 
dispute between Livius and the so-called coloniae maritimae over exactly this issue.
Alternatively, the title may have been mentioned only on Livius return to Rome in 190 in 
order to promote his achievements with his fleet after his great naval victory at Corycus in 
the East.
The use of the title    (or custos Italiae) provides an important 
hint (applicable to both of the possibilities outlined above) that an eastern naval command 
against Antiochus III could be viewed from a purely Italian rather than from a wider 
provincial perspective in the early second century.
 Arguably, this can be associated with 
the wider defensive measures taken to protect southern Italy and Sicily from a possible 
invasion by Antiochus III in 192.
 A similar idea is also to be found in a speech by Q. 
 I did not find a match for this phrase (in any case) in the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae database.  
 Livy also draws on Polybius, for which compare especially Livy, 36.42.1-4 and see further Thiel (1946), 
p.303-313. The equivalency between custos and  was noted by Ferrary (2000a), p.345. 
 See Livy, 36.3.4-6 with Briscoe (1981), p.222 s.v. 3.4-6. Coloniae maritimae.  
 Polyb. 21.2.1 records that the Romans ordered a supplicatio for nine days () in Rome following the news 
of the naval victory over a fleet of 100 of Antiochus ships, for which see Walbank (1979), p.90 s.v. 2.1. 
For Livius achievements see generally Thiel (1946), p.310-312. It is notable that he did not receive a naval 
triumph and one can speculate that an honorific title may have somewhat compensated for this, although we 
do not even know whether he requested a triumph in the first place. (He was elected consul just over a year 
later for 188, for which see MRR I, p.365.) 
 For the existence of the notion of Italia at this time see, for example, Livys report of the Roman response 
to the Bacchanalia just a few years later in 186: the consuls were sent to destroy all of the places devoted to 
Bacchus first in Rome and then in tota Italia and the Senate also decreed that there should be no Bacchanalia 
in Rome or in Italia (39.18.7-8). See further Bispham (2007), p.53-73 and esp. p.94 for the suggestion that 
terra Italia was probably originally used instead of tota Italia in the early second century. 
 See Brennan (2000), p203 for the naming of a praetorian prouincia Bruttii in both 192 and 191 (cf. Livy, 
35.20.8-11 and 36.2.6) and note especially the mandate given to A. Cornelius Mammula (pr.) in 191: ...tueri 
IV.v. The development of the ora maritima and world empire between the third and first centuries   
Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, as reported by Livy, against the naming of Africa as a 
prouincia for P. Cornelius Scipio in 205: he argues that armies were raised for the 
protection of Rome and Italy (custodia urbis atque Italiae) rather than for consuls to 
transfer them  in the manner of a king  to whatever part of the earth they wished.
Livys use of custodia urbis atque Italiae is comparable with Appians   
, which, as suggested above, may itself be a translation of the Latin honorific title 
custos Italiae.
In contrast, there was a noticeable shift in how the Romans viewed overseas 
military commands by the time that Antonius and Pompeius were entrusted with the ora 
maritima of the entire Mediterranean. Significantly, two inscriptions have survived 
honouring Pompeius as      (watcher/overseer of land and 
sea).
 The historical context of the first inscription from Claros can be directly linked to 
Pompeius naval command over the ora maritima. The sanctuary at Claros had been badly 
plundered by pirates and the inscription was probably set up there as a demonstration of 
gratitude shortly after Pompeius command of 67.
 The second inscription from 
omnem oram circa Tarentum Brundisiumque... (Livy, 36.2.7). Cf. Livy, 27.22.12-13 (208 B.C.). For the fact 
that two imperium-holders were to operate in Sicily in 192  for the first time since the end of the Second 
Punic War   see further Ch.III.vii. 
 Livy, 28.42.22: ego, patres conscripti, P. Cornelium rei publicae nobisque, non sibi ipsi priuatim creatum 
consulem existimo, exercitusque ad custodiam urbis atque Italiae scriptos esse, non quos regio more per 
superbiam consules quo terrarum uelint traiciant. Although the speech was surely composed by Livy, I 
agree with Gruen (1990), p.22, n.84 that it could easily still depict the relevant issues of the time: ...there is 
no reason to doubt its general aptness to the debate.  
 It is worth noting that the related verb custodire is also used in a senatus consultum, as reported by Livy, 
which directed L. Valerius Tappo (pr. 192) to defend the ora maritima between Pachynus and Tyndaris in 
Sicily in 191: ...eam maritimam oram L. Valerius uiginti nauibus longis custodiret... (36.2.11-12).

IV.v. The development of the ora maritima and world empire between the third and first centuries   
Miletopolis  over 150 miles north of Claros near to Cyzicus in Mysia  probably dates 
after his victory against Mithridates in the winter of 63/62.
The  formula is unprecedented in the surviving evidence prior to 67, but a 
similar ideology already existed in Rome in 66 when Cicero claimed that Pompeius 
victories had made it appear that the Roman people were masters of all gentes and nationes 
terra marique.
 A few years later, Cicero also alluded to certain men who were 
complaining that Pompeius had been entrusted with every land and sea.
As Pompeius command was viewed in these terms in contemporary Rome, it is 
reasonable to suppose that there was a Latin formula underlying the honorific title of 
    and that the impetus for the inscription probably came from 
Pompeius or his camp as a means of publicising his achievements in the East.
 If correct, 
one could suggest that  stood for curator, given Sallusts probable reference to M. 
Antonius Creticus, who, as we have seen, held a comparable command, as curator [totius] 
orae maritimae, qua Romanum esset imperium.
 However, Ferrarys proposal of custos 
(following a suggestion from G. W. Bowersock) is, on balance, the most credible 
suggestion.
 Indeed, unlike curator, custos is employed rhetorically in a variety of ways 
together with the following terms: the Roman imperium (including Pompeius role as its 
For the date see I. Kyzikos, II, p.125; Ferrary (2000a), p.343; and Schuler (2007), p.390. It is important to 
note that that Pompeius still held the ora maritima beyond 67/66, since it had been awarded for three years 
and did not lapse when he was assigned the Mithridatic command (for which cf. Girardet (2001), p.177f).

 See Ferrary (2000a), p.344f and SEG XLIX, no. 1509. I am less convinced by the more recent suggestion 
made by Schuler (2007), p.395 that the phrase was Greek-inspired rather than a translation of a Latin phrase: 
Eine unmittelbare lateinische Entsprechung fr  existierte vermutlich nicht. However, one should 
also note that the two possibilities are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as a Latin term could have 
influenced the use of the Greek and vice versa. In any case, for the undeniable Hellenistic influence on 
Roman notions of rule terra marique see the classic article by Momigliano (1942). 
 See Sall. Hist. 3 frag. 2M and especially the discussion in Ch.IV.iv with n.729 in which it is noted that

 Furthermore, as 
discussed above, there is also evidence that  and custos (or the related 
custodire/custodia) were used for some earlier commands in a much more restricted sense. 
As Ferrary points out,  was the usual equivalent of custos, but  had a 
greater association with the divine and would, therefore, have further enhanced Pompeius 
glory.
The representation of Pompeius as guardian (or, perhaps, custos) of land and sea 
against the pirates can be seen in stark contrast to Appians description of C. Livius 
Salinator as the guardian of Italy both in terms of the scope (Italy/world) and the weight of 
the honour (/).
 It is notable that Italia does not occur with custos in the 
surviving evidence from the first century in the same way as the other phrases mentioned 
above (e.g. imperium or prouinciae). These differences can be taken as evidence of an 
important change in the perception of empire: whereas the focus in the late third and early 
second centuries was apparently on the core (terra Italia), by the time of Pompeius 
command the horizon had significantly widened and notionally encompassed the world 
 See especially Cic. Dom. 129 (57 B.C.): ...de Cn. Pompeio, propugnatore et custode imperi, interficiendo 
consilia inibantur... Cf. Cic. Red. pop. 9 (C. Marius as custos ciuitatis atque imperi uestri) and Sest. 53 (di 
immortales, custodes et conseruatores huius urbis atque imperi). Note also Cic. Att. 14.5.2 for the custodia 
orbis terrarum, which could be linked to the Roman imperium. Furthermore, Augustus is later referred to as 
custos imperi Romani totiusque orbis terrarum praesi[dis] in an inscription recording decrees honouring 
Gaius Caesar, following his early death in 4 A.D. (ILS 140, ll. 9-10). This, in particular, shows a striking 
resemblance with the descriptions we have observed above for Pompeius after his victories in the East. Cf.

 Ferrary (2000a), p.345. Cf. Schuler (2007), p.395. Although it may be entirely circumstantial, it is 
interesting to note that Pompeius dedicated a templum to Minerva after his victories in the East, who, as we 
have seen in the previous note, could be described as custos urbis. For the temple see Plin. HN. 7.97 with

IV.v. The development of the ora maritima and world empire between the third and first centuries   
(terra marique). This new perspective is neatly illustrated on a coin minted at Rome in 70 
 i.e. just three years before Pompeius assignment against the pirates  on which Roma is 
depicted, alongside Italia, with her foot on a globe.
Arguably, the Roman conceptualisation of empire, as outlined above, stemmed 
from what some scholars have termed an increasing acknowledgement of empire and the 
development of the related concept of the Roman imperium orbis terrarum between the 
last quarter of the second century and first quarter of the first century.
 Polybius had 
already famously outlined his intention to explain how the Romans subjected nearly the 
whole inhabited world () to the   in the mid-second century.
However, this essentially concerned the Roman capacity to give orders and to be obeyed 
rather than the acknowledgement of a geographical empire.
 The first evidence for a 
Roman willingness to conceptualise their own dominant position in the world is to be 
found in a fragment of a speech delivered by Ti. Sempronius Gracchus (tr. pl.) for his 
agrarian law in 133, as preserved by Plutarch, in which he describes Roman soldiers as the 
  .
 Even this does not necessarily represent a geographical 
territorial empire per se and may, in fact, be closer to Polybius view concerning Romes 
general dominance.
 This also applies to the first concerete Latin reference to the Roman 
 RRC 403. For a discussion of the globe and the general historical context see further Nicolet (1991), p.35-
 See especially Gruen (1984), p.281; Crawford (1990), p.96-99; and Kallet-Marx (1995), p.286f. For the

(1995), p.282-290; and Schuler (2007), p.394. Cf. Richardson (2008), p.106-116, who oddly does not

IV.v. The development of the ora maritima and world empire between the third and first centuries   
imperium orbis terrarum around fifty years later in the Rhetorica ad Herennium (80s) 
when it was said to have been recognised by omnes gentes, reges and nationes.
This evolving Roman conception of empire and the imperium orbis terrarum 
provides the context within which the development of a collective meaning of the ora 
maritima as encompassing the coastal regions of the entire Mediterranean should almost 
certainly be seen.
 Indeed, as discussed in the previous section, the assignment of a 
prouincia tota ora maritima gave Pompeius a platform from which he could present his 
achievements in terms of world conquest. 
Finally, this representation of Pompeius victories against the pirates throughout 
the Mediterranean and against Mithridates and Tigranes in the East also led to another 
development, since it considerably raised the bar of expectation concerning the personal 
glory that a commander could hope to gain from a prouincia.
 This shifted the focus onto 
the individual imperator to a much greater extent than ever before. Whilst the Rhetorica ad 
Herennium had claimed that all peoples, kings and nations recognised the Roman 
imperium orbis terrarum through the conquest of the populus Romanus around the 80s, the 
emphasis was placed on Pompeius own victories over the imperium orbis terrarum 
around twenty years later. This change can be further illustrated by means of the coinage 
of the period. On several coins minted between 76 and 74, the Genius populi Romani is 
 Rhet. Her. 4.13: ...imperium orbis terrae, cui imperio omnes gentes, reges, nationes partim ui, partim 
uoluntate consenserunt, cum aut armis aut liberalitate a populo Romano superati essent... For the date and 
bibliography see Gaines (2010), p.170f. See further Gruen (1984), p.274; p.281; Richardson (1991); p.5f; 
Kallet-Marx (1995), p.286f; and Richardson (2008), p.56f. See also Schuler (2007), p.394 who rightly notes 
Cic. Rosc. Am. 131 (80 B.C.), which refers to Sulla as steering the orbis terrarum. For the political context 
behind the use of such a phrase see now the summary in Vervaet (2012b), p.124f. 
 Cf. also Horden and Purcell (2000), p.12: The claim of the Romans to their sea was part of a political 
and cultural process by which they progressively defined the place of Rome at the heart of an Inhabited 
World  an Oecumene or Orbis Terrarum with the Mediterranean at its centre... 
 For the fact that Pompeius was the paradigm that raised the expectation see e.g. Momigliano (1942), p.62-
64; Nicolet (1991), p.31-47; Schuler (2007), p.396-400; and stenberg (2009), p.283-288.

 and, as mentioned earlier, Roma is depicted, 
alongside Italia, with her foot on a globe on the reverse of another coin from 70.
contrast to these coins, a famous denarius minted by Faustus Cornelius Sulla in 56  i.e. 
after Pompeius triple triumph of 61 (preceded by his triumphs from Africa in 80 and 
Spain in 71)  displays a globe surrounded by three small wreaths, which, perhaps, 
represent Pompeius three triumphs, and another large wreath (recalling his overall 
victories over the orbis terrarum?).
 The representations on this coin specimen, 
therefore, make a direct link between the world and Pompeius own personal 
achievements, rather than those belonging solely to the populus Romanus or Roma. The 
connection between an individual commander and the (Roman) victories won overseas 
was taken to its logical conclusion when the Senate decreed that a bronze statue of C. 
Iulius Caesar should be placed on the image of the  as part of the extraordinary 
honours voted to him following his victory at Thapsus as consul (III) in 46.

IV.vi. Conclusions   
IV.vi. Conclusions
The evidence for the major naval commands of the late second and early first centuries, as 
discussed in this chapter, has revealed some major similarities but also differences in the 
ways that the Romans defined prouinciae and conceived of their empire in comparison 
with the third and early second centuries. 
I have argued that the new prouincia Cilicia assigned to M. Antonius around 
103/102 was separated from the neighbouring prouincia Asia (held by another (unknown) 
magistrate or promagistrate) with the coastal city of Side (and, perhaps, Lycaonia) serving 
as a cardo in medio (IV.ii). The rationale for this demarcation would have been to 
separate two imperium-holders in space, which is directly comparable with the division of 
the two Hispaniae by means of New Carthage around the beginning of the second century. 
As a result, there would have been no reason for naming the fleet as part of Antonius 
prouincia, since he was the only imperium-holder operating to the east of Side.
Antonius use of ships within his geographically prescribed and autonomous prouincia 
mirrors one of the typical practices of the third and early second centuries that we observed 
in Chapter III (the other major practice being the delineation of a prouincia classis for use 
within the same geographical area as another imperium-holder).
However, there was a significant difference in the way that the separation of 
imperium-holders was enforced between the early second century and the time of 
Antonius command in the late second century. We have seen that various laws were 
promulgated in the late second and early first centuries prohibiting commanders from 
leaving their prouinciae (and proceeding thereby in aliena prouincia) without good reason 
(IV.iii). This was discouraged earlier by the threats of censure and prosecution for 
 Cf. Ch.III.vii. 
 Ch.III.viii. 
IV.vi. Conclusions 
contravening the mos maiorum and auctoritas senatus alone.
 I have suggested that the 
use of laws to prescribe the activities of imperium-holders was representative of a general 
weakening of senatorial authority and political consensus in the late second and early first 
centuries.  
This trend can also be seen in the opposition of (at least) the most distinguished 
senators to the vast Mediterranean-wide command voted to Cn. Pompeius Magnus by the 
Lex Gabinia in 67. Although a model for the command had been provided by the 
prouincia assigned to M. Antonius Creticus in 75/74 (senatus consulto), the Senate did not 
take charge of defining the scope of Pompeius prouincia or the so-called ornatio 
prouinciae, as it traditionally would have done throughout the third and second centuries 
(IV.iv). 
This provides the context for understanding yet another contravention of the mos 
maiorum when Pompeius was given authority to prepare his own naval forces as a 
promagistrate through the Lex Gabinia, which I highlighted in Chapter II.
 In this case, 
the Senates role in deciding what naval preparations ought to be undertaken and the 
traditional responsibility of the senior magistrates, in particular, the consuls, in undertaking 
the preparations were subverted by this popular bill.
 Once again, popular legislation 
temporarily replaced the role of the Senate, as established by the mos maiorum. 
The scope of the prouincia (and resources) assigned to Pompeius in 67 also 
represents another important development. I have argued that the prouincia was most 
probably defined as the tota ora maritima  including the land in all of the existing 
 Cf. Ch.III.iii. 
 Ch.II.iv. 
 Note especially the opposition of the consul C. Calpurnius Piso, who interfered with Pompeius levies 
(Ch.IV.iv). Although this was likely motivated by political alliances, one might still speculate that he felt that 
some of his traditional responsibilities as consul (i.e. for levying soldiers and preparing naval forces) were 
being infringed by Pompeius.   
IV.vi. Conclusions 
prouinciae up to fifty miles from the sea  together with a general mandate concerning the 
war against the pirates (IV.iv). This illustrates that prouinciae could still be conceived in 
geographical (tota ora maritima) and functional terms (war against the pirates) 
simultaneously, just as in the third and second centuries.
 However, in contrast to the 
earlier cases, Pompeius prouincia was not circumscribed in terms of a specific coastal 
region, but rather encompassed the entire Mediterranean. I have proposed that this was 
made possible by the Romans increasing acknowledgement of empire and the 
development of the notion of a singular collective Mediterranean-wide ora maritima 
between the last quarter of the second century and first quarter of the first century (IV.v). 
We have seen that this had three consequences that the Senate traditionally sought 
to avoid by separating imperium-holders either in space or by function in the same space. 
First, the overlap of prouinciae meant that Pompeius clashed with Q. Caecilius Metellus 
Creticus (pro cos.), who had been assigned the prouincia Creta (which would naturally 
have involved fighting pirates in Crete). Second, the assigment of such a large and 
undivided prouincia meant that other commanders were unable to obtain their own gloria 
from the war against the pirates (Pompeius gained credit for the victories won by his 
personally nominated legati pro praetore). Indeed, it is worth recalling that the delineation 
of the prouincia classis was one means by which the Senate limited clashes between 
commanders over the rights of command and enabled more magistrates to win their own 
glory (and potentially celebrate a distinct triumphus naualis).
 The same premise, of 
course, applied to the demarcation of other prouinciae. Third, Pompeius vast prouincia 
allowed him to represent his victories in terms of world conquest and the liberation of the 
(tota) ora maritima of the orbis terrarum (e.g. as     ). This 
 Cf. Ch.III.i-iii. 
 Ch.III.iv-vi. 
IV.vi. Conclusions 
was symptomatic of the growing trend for a few powerful individual imperatores to 
present their achievements in much grander terms than ever before in the first century.
The above changes to the mos maiorum, the weakened authority of the Senate and 
the growing dominance of several powerful individuals would mark an excellent point at 
which to end this study. Indeed, the next major areas for investigation would be the civil 
war period from 49 onwards, followed by the formation of the Principate, in which the 
traditional mechanisms used by the Romans for defining and assigning naval tasks were 
dramatically altered.  
Yet, the classis et ora maritima was also, extraordinarily, named as the prouincia 
assigned to Sextus Pompeius, the youngest son of Cn. Pompeius Magnus, in 43. This 
demands an explanation in light of Chapters III and IV, each of which separately 
investigated the definition and use of the prouincia classis and the prouincia ora maritima. 
This will be the subject of the Epilogue, which will conclude this thesis. 
 Cf. Ch.III.viii. 
V.i. Introduction 
V. Epilogue: Sextus Pompeius as praefectus classis et orae 
maritimae
V.i. Introduction 
Chapters III and IV explored how and why the prouincia classis and the prouincia ora 
maritima were each defined within the approximate period from 260 to 49 through an 
analysis of the political and institutional contexts. As mentioned at the end of the previous 
chapter, a prouincia classis et ora maritima remarkably appears as part of the 
extraordinary command assigned to Sextus Pompeius, the youngest son of Cn. Pompeius 
Magnus, around the beginning of May 43.
 Modern scholars have widely recognised the 
extraordinary nature of this designation and have concluded that it gave Sextus authority 
over one of three geographical areas: i) the coastal regions of Italy;
 ii) Italy and 
Sicily;
 and iii) the entire Mediterranean.
 However, there have been no attempts to 
explore the meaning of the prouincia in any further detail.  
Although outside the period in which my research is located, this command 
provides an excellent lens through which to revisit and bring together the major 
conclusions reached in the previous chapters. Using the conclusions from Chapters III and 
IV, this Epilogue will elucidate the command of Sextus and, in doing so, provide some 
 An approximate date for the appointment can be determined by combining the evidence that Sextus was 
appointed at the same time as M. Iunius Brutus and C. Cassius Longinus were decreed their so-called 
prouinciae transmarinae (Vell. Pat. 2.73.2 and Dio Cass. 46.40.3) and Ciceros letter from 5 May recording 
that a proposal was made that Cassius should pursue P. Cornelius Dolabella (part of his new prouincia 
transmarina) in the Senate on 27 April (Cic. Ad Brut. 1.9.1). Although scholars have often assumed that 
Sextus was appointed on 27 April, Cicero does not tell us the result of the proposal, which only serves as a 
terminus post quem. All we can assume from combining Velleius, Dio and Cicero is that Sextus was 
appointed whenever the decree mentioned by Cicero was actually approved, which may have been sometime 
after 27 April in early or even mid-May. Cf. Woodman (1983), p.132-134 and p.177f; and, most recently, 
Welch (2012), p.163. It should also be noted that the curious single coin specimen inscribed with AGRIPPA 
ORAE [MARIT(IMAE) ET] CLAS(SIS) PRAE(FECTUS) C(ONSUL), which was acquired by the British Museum in 
1931, has now been shown to be a fake by Amandry (1996) contra Mattingly (1934).

final reflections on the fundamental uses of the prouincia between the third and first 
centuries, as presented throughout this thesis. Its structure will deliberately mirror those 
chapters by recalling the answers to the questions of how, when and why the prouincia 
classis and the prouincia ora maritima were defined between the third and first centuries. 
After first discussing the evidence for the name of Sextus extraordinary prouincia and his 
official position (V.ii), the following two parts will examine how this prouincia was 
defined (V.iii-iv). The final part will then consider why the fleet was explicitly named as 
part of a prouincia for the first time for over one hundred years in 43 (V.v). 
V.ii. The official position of Sextus Pompeius in 43 
V.ii. The official position of Sextus Pompeius in 43 
The official designation of Sextus prouincia is, fortunately, almost certainly 
preserved on his Sicilian coinage:  
PRAEF(ECTUS)  CLAS(SIS)  ET  ORAE  MARIT(IMAE)  EX  S(ENATUS) C(ONSULTO)
The coins were probably minted between 42 and 40  i.e. before Sextus made the 
so-called Treaty of Misenum with M. Antonius and C. Iulius Caesar Octavianus in 39, 
which confirmed his command over Sardinia (and Corsica), Sicily and Achaea in place of 
his previously held prouincia classis et ora maritima.
Further evidence for the name of Sextus prouincia is to be found in the accounts 
of the ancient literary authors, who appear to abbreviate the full designation by focussing 
on one of its two parts: Dio states, in a formulaic manner, that Sextus was entrusted with 
the fleet ( ) at the same time as Brutus and Cassius were entrusted with 
Macedonia and Syria;
  Appian describes how he was chosen to command the sea;
 RRC 511. It should be noted that the word order varies between the different coin specimens (cf. e.g. 511, 
 Crawford (RRC I, p.521) proposed a date between 43/42 and 40, which was later challenged by Woytek 
(1995), who preferred to date the coinage between the autumn of 37 and the summer of 36. However, Estiot 
(2005) and Welch (2012), p.184-187 (and cf. Appendix, p.319-322) have independently made compelling 
cases for dating the coinage between 42 and 40 (with the so-called Treaty of Misenum in 39 serving as the 
terminus ante quem). I am not convinced by the suggestion of Vervaet (2010b), p.83, n.14 that the stipulation 
that Sextus should secure peace for Italy from the sea in the agreement of 39 (Dio Cass. 48.36.4-6) meant 
that he was, ...probably officially reinstated as praefectus classis et orae maritimae with consular imperium, 
an office he had first received from the Senate in 43... Cf. Groag (1915), p.53; MRR II, p.388; and now 
Welch (2012), p.238-251 and p.257, n.99 for further references. 
 Dio Cass. 46.40.3:               
              ... 
Note especially the pertinent observation by Welch (2012), p.163: He [Dio] names Pompeius first and 
departs from his usual habit of using only Pompeius praenomen, giving the statement a very official 
tone... Cf. e.g. Dio Cass. 48.17.1. For the reference to the war against Dolabella cf. Ch.IV.iv. 
 App. B Ciu. 4.84:      ,      ... (cf. 4.70; 
and 4.96). 
V.ii. The official position of Sextus Pompeius in 43 
Velleius reports, in strikingly similar language as used on Sextus coinage, that the Senate 
had given him command (praefecerat) of the ora maritima.
Although scholars have usually assumed that the reference to Sextus as praefectus 
on his coinage represented his official title from 43, it is much more likely that it was used 
as a means of succinctly describing his prouincia classis et ora maritima.
 This is 
comparable with another series of coins that list M. Oppius Capitos official position (pro 
praetore) together with the naval task (praefectus classis) that he was assigned by 
Antonius between 38 and 36.
 Whilst it is impossible to determine whether Oppius was a 
promagistrate with independent imperium praetorium or a legatus pro praetore, the 
fundamental point is that one of these would have been his official position from which he 
was assigned the task of the fleet.
Sextus was almost certainly granted the official position of promagistrate (probably 
with consulare imperium), given that the honorific title of IMP(ERATOR) is used on the 
obverse of his Sicilian coins.

I have collected the surviving evidence for the term praefectus classis in a paper entitled The Position of 
Praefectus Classis in the Roman Republic (in preparation), in which I argue that the term was consistently 
used throughout the Republic to describe a task assigned to an individual with an existing official position 
(e.g. legatus). 
 E.g. RPC I, 1462 (reverse): M  OPPIUS  CAPITO  PRO  PR  PRAEF  CLASS  F  C  See further RPC, I, 1462-
1467 (heavy series) and 1467-1470 (light series). The dating of the coinage depends on when Antonius was 
hailed imperator iterum and imperator tertio, for which see Amandry (1990), p.80-83. Cf. ILS 891 (cathedral 
wall, Mytilene): ciues Romani qui | Mytileneis negotiantur | M. Titio L. f. procos., | praef. classis, | cos. 
desig., patrono, | honoris causa. Ferrary (2000a), p.356f dates the inscription between 34 and 32 and 
observes that M. Titius was either pro cos. and then praef. class. (un cursus normal) or  more likely in my 
opinion  that he was simultaneously pro cos. (nature de son imperium) and praef. class. (fonction 
prcise).  
 The word order on the coins makes it improbable that pro praetore referred to his imperium as praefectus 
classis, which is unprecedented in the Republic (and, in any case, would have been reversed, pace the 
implication in MRR II, Index of Careers, p.596). As far as I am aware, these coins provide the only 
evidence for M. Oppius Capito. 
 RRC, 511. Cf. Dio Cass. 48.19.1. 
independent imperium auspiciumque, it would have been odd, if Sextus had not been 
entitled to it, for it to have been included on coins designed to represent his constitutional 
legitimacy.
 Indeed, the inclusion of an assignment together with either ex senatus 
consulto or senatus consulto on the same face of a coin is unprecedented in the Republic 
and would have served to highlight the legitimate method by which Sextus was appointed 
to his prouincia.
 As pro cos. (or pro pr.) does not seem to have been used with the name 
of a specific prouincia on coinage during the Republic, it is reasonable to conclude that 
praefectus was used in its place to describe Sextus assignment of the prouincia classis et 
ora maritima.
The next section will consider how this unique designation is best interpreted by 
relating it to what we have discovered about the use of fleets, coastal regions and 
prouinciae in the earlier chapters. 
 I am indebted to Frederik Vervaet for this important point and for generously discussing the question of 
Sextus imperium with me at length (per litteras).  
 For Sextus emphasis on the legitimacy of his command see generally e.g. Welch (2012), p.184-187. If 
the use of ex senatus consulto is to be taken literally, this would potentially indicate that the Senate had 
instructed a magistrate to propose the motion to the comitia (tributa or the curiata if the motion only 
concerned a lex de imperio), which ratified the grant of the imperium and the prouincia. If correct  and I 
admit that what follows is no more than guesswork  M. Caecilius Cornutus (pr. urb.) may very well have 
been the magistrate responsible given that he presided over the Senate in the absence of the consuls and was 
the most senior magistrate in Rome at the time (Cic. Fam. 10.12.3 and 10.16.1). For the praetor urbanus 
proposing legislation to the comitia when the consuls were absent see Brennan (2000), p.119-121, although it 
remains possible that another magistrate made the proposal in 43 (e.g. a tribune of the plebs). It is notable 
that senatus consulto appears on some of the coins in place of ex senatus consulto, which may have carried a 
slightly different meaning. For the use of ex senatus consulto and senatus consulto cf. Badian (1980-81), 
p.99-101. 
 There would have not been enough space on the coin face to include pro cos. praef. clas. et orae marit. 
ex. S.C. (in the same manner that Oppius was able to list pro pr. praef. class.) and it is likely that the 
description of the assignment ex senatus consulto was prioritised in order to emphasise the legitimacy of his 
actions in Sicily and on the Italian coast. I found no cases of pro cos. or pro pr. together with an assigned 
task in either RRC or RPC I. It is worth noting that the formula proconsul of a specific prouincia does 
appear in the Principate: see e.g. ILS 986, l.9 with Gordon (1983), p.127f, no.49 (procos. Asiae) from around 
74/79 A.D. If this was only an imperial development, it would be interesting to consider whether this 
represents a change in the Roman view of their territorial empire (although this is beyond the scope of this 
chapter). However, note Ciceros reference to the praetor Siciliae in his Verrine Orations (e.g. 2.3.193; 
2.5.29; and 2.5.117) and cf. Ch.III.i. 
V.iii. The classis and the ora maritima: function in space 
V.iii. The classis and the ora maritima: function in space  
Chapter III showed that the prouincia classis was usually defined with a geographical 
sphere of operation by means of an additional designation and, more frequently, 
senatorial instructions in the late third and early second centuries.
 A. Atilius Serranus 
(pr.), for example, was allotted the classis et Macedonia and was then sent in Graeciam to 
defend the allies in 192.
 The designation of Macedonia and the instructions to sail to 
Greece would have served to restrict his naval activities to those particular geographical 
areas. In the same year, L. Oppius Salinator was also assigned a fleet (probably pro 
praetore) for the explicit purpose of defending the ora Siciliae.
 The Senates definition 
of these geographical spheres of operation is representative of its wider role in 
prescribing prouinciae and thereby exercising a level of control over the movements of 
imperium-holders during the Republic. Indeed, we have examined various cases in which 
special instructions were required for any imperium-holder to cross from the geographical 
sphere of operation associated with his prouincia into another area.
 This requirement 
was understood as part of the established mos maiorum in the third and second centuries, 
although it was later reinforced through various leges maiestatis in the late second and 
early first centuries.
I shall return to the question of whether Sextus was granted special senatorial 
instructions as part of his assignment in the next section. For now, it is reasonable to 
suppose that the additional designation of the ora maritima provided a geographical 
definition for the classis element of his prouincia. However, in contrast to the cases from 
 Ch.III.ii-iii.

 Livy, 35.23.6-9 and 35.24.6-7 with analysis of his official position in ch.III.vii. Cf. the prorogation notice 
from 211 concerning T. Otacilius Crassus, who had originally been assigned the prouincia classis during his 
praetorship of 214: T. Otacilio et M. Valerio Siciliae Graeciaeque orae cum legionibus classibusque quibus 
praeerant decretae... (Livy, 26.1.6-12).  
 Ch.III.iii and Ch.IV.iii. 
 Ch.IV.iii. 
the third and second centuries in which the prouincia classis was usually defined in terms 
of a single area (e.g. Macedonia/Greece) or coastal region (e.g. ora Siciliae), there is no 
evidence that the ora maritima was circumscribed over one hundred years later in 43. 
Chapter IV highlighted an important development between the late second and 
early first centuries, whereby the Romans increasingly came to view their empire in much 
more expansive terms than ever before (e.g. as the imperium orbis terrarum). I suggested 
that this also enabled them to think of the ora maritima as a singular collective 
encompassing the entire Mediterranean, whereas the predominant focus had earlier been 
on the individual coasts of Rome, Italy and specific prouinciae.
 With this in mind, the 
ora maritima may well have defined Sextus prouincia as the coastal regions of the 
Mediterranean.  
Indeed, Appian makes a direct comparison between Sextus assignment and the 
Mediterranean-wide commands held by his father, Cn. Pompeius Magnus, in 67 and 57. 
He states that Sextus was appointed, to command the sea, just as his father had held the 
same command.
 The verb employed by Appian () almost certainly refers to the 
general area over which the commands extended rather than to the imperium held by the 
commanders.
 He reports elsewhere that M. Antonius had proposed to the Senate in 44 
 Ch.IV.v. Cf. especially Livy, 29.13.5-6 (204 B.C.: ...prorogatum imperium est, et Cn. Octauio ut cum 
Sardiniam legionemque Ti. Claudio tradidisset ipse nauibus longis quadraginta maritimam oram, quibus 
finibus senatus censuisset, tutaretur...) and Livy, 30.2.4 (203 B.C.: parem nauium numerum Cn. Octauio 
praetori item prioris anni cum pari iure imperii ad tuendam Sardiniae oram patres decreuerunt..., which 
arguably records the definition promised by the Senate in the previous year). For further ancient references to 
Cn. Octavius see MRR I, p.302, p.308 and p.313. 
 App. B Ciu. 4.84:      ,      ... This was 
already noticed long ago by Groag (1915), p.52f. 
 This is confused in the Loeb translation of White (1913): Having been appointed commander of the sea 
with the same powers that his father had exercised... Appian uses very different terminology to refer to 
constitutional powers when he describes how Pompeius was given the Mithridatic command with the same 
powers (   ) as he had from the pirate command, which he qualifies with the term 
 (Mith. 97).  (especially with ) appears to refer specifically to Pompeius 
imperium, in contrast to his comparison between Sextus and Pompeius with  above. For the Greek 
terminology see further Mason (1974), p.44; p.117-120; and p.133f (); and p.110-113, esp. p.111 
():  is used naturally to apply to provincial governors of all ranks. 
that Sextus should be appointed, commander of the sea, as his father had been, with 
charge of the Roman ships, wherever situated, which were needed for immediate 
service...
 Although this is the only record that Antonius made such a proposal, if it is 
authentic it follows that the Senate would have been likely to define Sextus command in 
similar terms in 43.
 As discussed in Chapter IV, Pompeius was assigned a prouincia 
(tota) ora maritima in 67 and 57  based on the prouincia granted to M. Antonius in 75/74 
 which was defined as including Italy and all of the existing prouinciae up to fifty miles 
from the sea.
 As Appian suggests, then, the Senate probably used this as the model for 
Sextus prouincia around twenty years later.
It is worth noting that a golden statue was set up in the Forum Romanum on the top 
of a columna rostrata as part of the honours voted for Octavian after he defeated Sextus in 
36 with the following inscription: peace, long disturbed, he re-established on land and 
sea.
 Although this recalls the columna rostrata set up to memorialise the victories of C. 
Duilius (cos.) in 260, the scope of Octavians claim far exceeds the record of Duilius 
achievements in a single naval battle.
 Chapter IV outlined how the celebration of the 
victories of an individual imperator with the terra marique motif  associated earlier with 
Hellenistic kings in the East  can be traced back to Pompeius victories over the pirates

  ,      ,        
   ... For the dating of the passage see Hadas (1930), p.62-64. 
 Appian, after all, states that the Senate accepted Antonius proposals with zeal (B Ciu. 3.4). Dio Cass. 
45.10.6 also mentions that Antonius brought about a vote concerning an agreement reached between Lepidus 
and Sextus in Spain, but does provide further details. See further Gowing (1992), p.102. 
 Ch.IV.iv. 
 See e.g. Powell (2002), p.107-109, esp. p.108: Was conscious imitation involved? Undoubtedly so in the 
case of the senators who gave Sextus the post of praefectus classis et orae maritimae. For an early 
comparison between Sextus and his father made in the Senate in March 43  i.e. just a month or two before 
his appointment  see already Cic. Phil. 13.10-13 and 13.50.  It is well-known that Sextus played up to his 
ancestry with the iconography and references to his honorific titles on his coinage: e.g. note the display of his 
fathers head, a lituus  surely referring to his fathers augurate  and the label MAG  PIUS  IMP  ITER on the 
obverse on several of his coins (e.g. RPC I, 511, 3a).

throughout the Mediterranean.
 It is somewhat ironic that Octavians victory against his 
son, who had been granted an assignment comparable with his fathers commands over the 
tota ora maritima, was presented in similar terms.  
 Ch.IV.v. 
V.iv. The classis and senatorial instructions: function and space 
V.iv. The classis and senatorial instructions: function and space 
Chapters III and IV showed that prouinciae could be defined in more complex terms than 
their plain designations would suggest, prima facie, by means of senatorial instructions (or 
mandata). The use of senatus consulta was one of the fundamental mechanisms, aside 
from the designation of the prouinciae and allocation of military resources, through which 
the Senate was able to exert a direct influence on Roman foreign policy. Unfortunately, as 
revealed in Chapter III, these instructions are often abbreviated or omitted in the surviving 
ancient literary sources. This explains why their importance has often been minimised by 
modern scholars. Nonetheless, we observed that Livy preserves various records  probably 
indirectly from authentic archival material  in which senatorial instructions were issued 
together with prouinciae in the third and second centuries. As mentioned in the previous 
section, A Atilius Serranus (pr.) was sent into Greece to defend the allies and L. Oppius 
Salinator (probably pro pr.) was also instructed to protect the coast of Sicily  both almost 
certainly ex senatus consulto  in 192. The instructions preserved by Livy were almost 
certainly representative of a wider trend, which, arguably, is reflected in the reference to 
mandata (ex senatus consulto?) in the law on the eastern prouinciae from around 100.
These likely formed a precedent for the better known imperial mandata, which were 
customarily issued during the Principate. 
Taking the above into account, we should consider the distinct possibility that the 
Senate issued more specific instructions to Sextus at the same time as naming his 
prouincia classis et ora maritima in 43. There is no explicit evidence for this, which is not 
surprising given that the ancient sources are mostly hostile to him and predominantly focus 
on Octavian and Antonius (and, as noted above, the ancient literary sources often omit or 
 RS, no.12, Cnidos Copy, col. IV, ll. 31-39 with the discussion in Ch.III.iii. 
abbreviate the details of senatus consulta).
 However, we know that Sextus sailed to 
Sicily shortly after receiving his command  probably before Octavian and Q. Pedius 
became consuls in August 43 (after which he was included in the list of Caesars assassins 
and proscribed).
 Although the possibility that Sextus independently decided to sail to 
Sicily for his own strategic reasons cannot be ruled out, one can speculate that the Senate 
specifically instructed him to gain control of the so-called prouinciae frumentariae in 
order to secure the grain route to Rome.
 This had, after all, been part of the Pompeian 
strategy in 49.
There is evidence that the Senate was concerned about the annona approximately 
one or two weeks before Sextus appointment. Dio uniquely records that a senatus 
consultum was passed around the time of Antonius defeat at Mutina in late April 
stipulating that no one man should be chosen as the curator of the grain supply (curator 
annonae) or the overseer of food.
 The purpose of this measure was almost certainly to 
remove an avenue through which an individual might build up power and, potentially, 
even threaten the grain supply of Rome.
 The curator annonae had been famously used 
 For an overview and re-assessment of Sextus reputation as a pirate in the modern literature, which is a 
view that originates with the ancient sources, see e.g. Welch (2002b) and Ridley (2003), p.183-187. Cf. de 
Souza (1999), p.193-195. Cf. Dio Cass. 46.40 (reporting Sextus appointment and focussed on Antonius and 
Octavian in 43) and Dio Cass. 48.36.4-6 (recording more details of the agreement between Antonius, 
Octavian and Sextus at the so-called treaty of Misenum in 39).  
 For the problems concerning the chronology of Sextus journey from Massilia to Sicily see Welch 
(2002b), p.39-42 and Welch (2012), p.167-169.  
 Cf. Saddington (2007), p.206: It is not known how his [Sextus] authority on the coast was defined in 
detail, or what land forces he had at his disposal, but his main duty would have been to secure the corn 
supply to the capital (which later he found it politic to interrupt). For the well-known role of Sicily in 
supplying grain note especially e.g. Cic. Verr. 2.3.11 and 2.3.43. 
 For the strategy of 49 see especially Cic. Att. 9.9.2 (17 March, 49): omnis hac classis Alexandria, Colchis, 
Tyro, Sidone, Arado, Cypro, Pamphylia, Lycia, Rhodo, Chio, Byzantio, Lesbo, Smyrna, Mileto, Coo ad 
intercludendos commeatus Italiae et ad occupandas frumentarias prouincias comparatur. See now Welch 
(2012), p.54-57 with further references.  
 Dio Cass. 46.39.3: ...          
 . Cf. Gowing (1992), p.70f. 
 Dio explains that the Senate wished to remove avenues through which individuals might have been able 
to achieve dominance immediately before he mentions the bans on an individual holding office for more than 
one year and the office of curator annonae (46.39.2-3). 
by Pompeius as a back door for obtaining a vast military command in 57.
 More recently 
still, the appointment of Brutus and Cassius as curators of the grain supply in Asia and 
Sicily in June 44 had provided them with a legitimate platform from which to build up 
substantial military forces.
With this in mind, it is reasonable to imagine that the Senate would have been wary 
of the curator annonae being used in a similar way after Mutina; and it is even worth 
speculating further that it was concerned, in particular, about Octavians intentions.
Within this context, the appointment of Sextus may be viewed as an additional senatorial 
measure, following on from the prohibition of the office of curator annonae, which was 
designed to prevent the seizure of the annona by another hostile individual. If correct, one 
could assume that the Senate would have given Sextus a special directive to control the 
sea-lanes to Italy and to safeguard the grain supply to Rome when they assigned him the 
prouincia classis et ora maritima.
 See further the discussion in Vervaet (2010a), p.151-154. 
 See especially e.g. Cic. Att. 15.9.1 (2 June, 44): IIII Non. uesperi a Balbo redditae mihi litterae fore Nonis 
senatum, ut Brutus in Asia, Cassius in Sicilia frumentum emendum et ad urbem mittendum curarent. o rem 
miseram primum ullam ab istis, dein, si aliquam, hanc legatariam prouinciam Cf. Cic. Att. 15.11.1-2 (8 
June, 44); 15.12.1 (9 or 10 June, 44); Appian, B Ciu. 3.6; and 3.35. For further references see MRR II, p.320f

 Note the concerns already expressed by Cic. Ad Brut. 1.7.1 (c. 21 April, 43): Quales tibi saepe scripsi

certe, nisi is Antonium ab urbe auertisset,perissent omnia. Cf. Ciceros failure to achieve this in Ad Brut. 
1.18.3 (mid-June, 43). It should also be emphasised that Dio Cass. 46.39 is concerned with the breakdown of 
relations between Octavian and the Senate (it opens with          
     ...). Cf. App. B Ciu. 3.80 and especially 3.82.   
 For the important argument that Sextus was included in a three-pronged senatorial strategy, alongside 
Brutus and Cassius, see Welch (2010), p.17-20 and especially now Welch (2012), p.163-169. Cf. Fndling 
(2003), who suggests, ...it [the title of praefectus classis et orae maritimae] might also have been calculated 
to keep Sextus far from Rome where he would have been awkward for Cicero and his allies. It is also worth 
noting here that Pompeius had been responsible for restoring the grain supply during his command against 
the pirates in 67 and, as curator annonae, in 57 with prouinciae that were directly comparable in scope with 
the prouincia assigned to Sextus. Cf. Cic. Leg. Man. 34-35; Plut. Pomp. 26.4; and 50. For the comparison 
between Pompeius commands of 67 and 57 see Dio Cass. 39.9.3. 
V.v. The re-appearance of the prouincia classis: old or new? 
V.v. The re-appearance of the prouincia classis: old or new? 
Having seen how the assignment of the ora maritima  perhaps, together with additional 
senatorial instructions  provided a geographical (and maybe even functional) definition 
for Sextus prouincia, we can now consider the second issue raised in the introduction to 
this Epilogue concerning why he was also designated the classis. Indeed, we may ask why 
this was necessary, given that it had not been included in the comparable prouinciae 
assigned to Antonius and Pompeius earlier in the first century.  
Chapter III established that a prouincia classis was ordinarily named by the Senate 
as a means of separating two or more imperium-holders by function in the third and second 
centuries. The rationale for this was to prevent commanders, who were operating in the 
same geographical space, from getting in each others way and clashing over military 
gloria and triumphal rights. (The third major reason why prouinciae were delineated  to 
separate the jurisdiction of Roman imperium-holders from certain kingdoms  did not 
apply in the case of the fleet.)
 We have seen, for example, that the prouincia classis 
regularly separated the functions of two imperium-holders in Sicily during the Second 
Punic War (218-201) and in Greece and Asia during the wars against Antiochus III (192-
188) and Perseus of Macedon (171-168).
 In contrast, the fleet was never named 
explicitly as a prouincia when there was only one independent imperium-holder operating 
in a particular geographical area, even if naval forces were to be used.
 Instead, these 
prouinciae would have been geographically separated from other prouinciae by means of a 
particular designation (e.g. Macedonia) or more complex definition (e.g. Cilicia with the 
city of Side, perhaps, serving as a western coastal limit).

 Ch.III.viii and IV.ii. 
 Ch.IV.ii. 
V.v. The re-appearance of the prouincia classis: old or new? 
Chapter III also demonstrated that the demarcation of an independent prouincia 
classis provided its holder with an opportunity to request his own distinct naval triumph 
for success achieved with his fleet in a geographical area that was shared with another 
imperium-holder (even if this could have meant successfully completing the prouincia as 
the last individual to hold it at the conclusion of a major war).
 Indeed, three praetorian 
commanders celebrated naval triumphs from the same sphere (and against the same 
enemy) as three consular commanders, who also celebrated their own regular triumphs, for 
the wars against Antiochus III and Perseus of Macedon. I argued that the delineation of the 
prouincia classis is what made these naval triumphs distinct celebrations and that this, 
thereby, deliberately served to limit the potential for conflicts with the other (consular) 
imperium-holders over triumphal rights.  
We should not assume, however, that the above reasons for naming the prouincia 
classis in the third and second centuries were necessarily applicable when it was assigned 
to Sextus, well over one hundred years later. It is, after all, unlikely that the separation of 
independent imperium-holders by their functions would have been a realistic objective 
during a period of frequently shifting political alignments and civil war. Indeed, Sextus 
soon clashed with A. Pompeius Bithynicus, who was a promagistrate (pro pr.?) in 
Sicily.
 Furthermore, the Senate certainly would not have considered naming the fleet as 
a prouincia as a means of providing Sextus with an opportunity to acquire a naval triumph. 
The celebration of triumphs for victories over Roman citizens was viewed as abhorrent by 
both the Senate and people; and, in any case, the last naval triumph was celebrated in very 
different circumstances over one hundred and twenty years earlier.  
 Ch.III.vi. 
 Dio Cass. 48.17.5-6, who records that they eventually reached a compromise whereby Bithynicus would 
command on an equal footing with Sextus (cf. App. B Ciu. 4.84). Welch (2012), p.167 notes that ...the 
Caesarian Bithynicus compliance probably indicates that the negotiated hand-over took place while 
Pompeius imperium was still universally recognised.  
V.v. The re-appearance of the prouincia classis: old or new? 
The re-appearance of a prouincia classis after so many years, then, may be better 
explained within the unique civil war context of 43. It may well simply have reflected a 
senatorial concern to put someone of their own choosing in charge of the available naval 
forces in ports of the Western Mediterranean and the sea-lanes.
 As mentioned earlier, 
M. Antonius had apparently suggested to the Senate in 44 that Sextus should be appointed, 
commander of the sea, as his father had been, with charge of the Roman ships, wherever 
situated, which were needed for immediate service...
 Although this was not carried out 
in 44, the Senate were enthusiastic about the proposal; and it is likely that the command 
would have been defined in a similar way in 43.
 As we have already seen, the first part 
of the proposal (commander of the sea, as his father had been...) can be explained in 
terms of the ora maritima. Yet, it remains possible that the second part (with charge of 
the Roman ships, wherever situated...) was facilitated through the naming of the classis as 
part of the prouincia. Indeed, Appian describes how Sextus first took as many ships as he 
could find in the harbours (presumably around Massilia) and joined them with those he 
had from Spain before sailing to Sicily.
 Dio adds that he became master of the sea 
around Italy and that he proceeded to drag away ships from the harbours.
 Welch rightly 
recognised that the collection of ships may have been related to his assignment of the 
classis.
 We can also add that the assignment of the ora maritima would have provided 
him with legitimate access to coastal resources, such as harbours and the much needed 
supplies for his men and ships.
 This provides one explanation for why Sextus chose to

highlight his prouincia by styling himself as praefectus classis et orae maritimae on his 
coinage.
The Senate may, therefore, have named the classis as a distinct part of Sextus 
prouincia in order to give his collection and command of ships a greater sense of legality. 
Chapter II illustrated how the Senate was traditionally responsible for the allocation of 
fleets.
 The Senate ordinarily instructed the consuls  or, when it was expedient, a praetor 
 to carry out the necessary naval preparations in Italy. The system had broken down by 
the time of the outbreak of civil war in 49, from which point commanders personally 
ordered ships to be built and collected their own fleets throughout the Mediterranean.
Arguably, the Senates decision to name the fleet as Sextus prouincia served to reassert its 
traditional authority, as based on the mos maiorum. This would also have been especially 
pertinent, given that  in contrast to almost all of the individuals who earlier had been 
assigned a prouincia classis in the third and second centuries  Sextus was not in Italy at 
the time of his appointment.  
 The need to emphasise his legitimacy became especially important after he was added to the proscription 
lists just a few months after his appointment, for which see further Gowing (1992), p.247-269 and Welch 
(2012), p.170-173. Cf. Hadas (1930), p.68f. It is worth noting that Livy describes how C. Livius Salinator 
(pr.) collected ships from various towns on the Italian and Sicilian coasts as praefectus Romanae classis in 
191 (36.42.1-2). Livy arguably uses praefectus classis as a way of describing Livius prouincia, which 
would have neatly explained why he was gathering ships.

collected from various cities in the East). Cf. Kromayer (1897), p.39-42 and Brunt (1971), p.507f. 
V.vi. Conclusions 
V.vi. Conclusions
In summary, the assignment of a prouincia classis et (tota) ora maritima served various 
purposes in 43. The first half provided a functional definition for the command, which was 
most probably intended to make the clear statement, within the civil war context, that the 
Senate had designated Sextus as their naval commander par excellence. Meanwhile, the 
latter half defined the Mediterranean coastal regions  encompassing, perhaps, the land up 
to fifty miles from the sea  as the geographical area within which Sextus was authorised 
to operate with his fleet. The provincial designation may also have been accompanied by 
more specific senatorial instructions  e.g. to secure the so-called prouinciae frumentariae 
 which are, unfortunately, not explicitly recorded in the surviving evidence. Thus, the 
definition of Sextus prouincia in the ways described above  i.e. in both geographical 
(ora maritima) and functional (classis) terms  further highlights the great flexibility of the 
concept of the prouincia that we have seen throughout the chapters of this study.  
I have already outlined the major conclusions at the end of each chapter, which 
have also been brought together and discussed further in the preceding sections of this 
Epilogue. These conclusions have provided answers to the questions  originally posed in 
the introduction to this thesis  concerning how, when and why the tasks of preparing and 
commanding fleets were defined, assigned and undertaken during the Republic. In 
assessing the evidence for these naval tasks, new evidence has been brought to bear on a 
series of wider debates concerning some of the functions of the Senate, the role and 
independence of magistrates and promagistrates, the Roman conceptualisation of empire 
and, last but not least, the nature and use of the prouincia.  
The evidence for naval tasks has confirmed the supreme power of the Senate in 
allocating military resources and tasks in the third and early second centuries. This is well-
known. However, this new research has demonstrated that the Senate was able to prescribe 
V.vi. Conclusions 
the activities of magistrates and promagistrates, not only through the naming of 
prouinciae, prorogatio imperii and allocation of resources, as often discussed, but also by 
issuing specific mandata ex senatus consulto. The use of these orders on a regular basis, as 
I have proposed, may suggest that the Senate played a more active role in formulating the 
details of Roman foreign policy than is sometimes appreciated in modern scholarship.
We can easily imagine that the curia was filled with debate at the start of each year about 
the general military and administrative policies to be undertaken and the instructions to be 
issued to the imperium-holders (even though we only have a relatively small sample of 
these in the surviving ancient literary sources). 
The Senates use of mandata has wider implications for future research assessing 
the importance of senatorial instructions within the various debates on the nature of Roman 
imperialism (or imperialisms) and the political culture at Rome. It would also be 
interesting to think comparatively about the better known imperial mandata and ask to 
what extent there is any traceable development in the use of instructions from the Republic 
to the Principate. Could the use of imperial mandata by Augustus have been a deliberate 
manipulation of a traditional Republican phenomenon (or even a subversion of this)? 
This line of inquiry could be usefully extended also to the instructions issued for the 
allocation of resources and the undertaking of the dilectus. Did, for example, the Senate 
continue to take responsibility for ordering military levies in the Principate? Just how 
traditional were these?
Returning to the research presented in this thesis, I have argued that one of the 
primary reasons that the Senate prescribed prouinciae between the third and first centuries 
 through designations and mandata  was to separate magistrates and/or promagistrates, 
 Cf. e.g. Eckstein (1987), p.69f and passim. 
 Cf. Brunt (1974).  
V.vi. Conclusions 
either in space, or by function in space. Whilst this has been illustrated predominantly 
through an analysis of the evidence for prouinciae involving the use of fleets, it also has a 
much wider significance for our understanding of the meaning and use of prouinciae 
throughout the Republic.  
Modern scholars have often assumed that the meaning of the prouincia transformed 
from a purely functional military task into a territorial space through processes associated 
with provincialisation.
 I deliberately dissociated the practical use of the prouincia 
from the many complex issues surrounding the provincialisation of territory in this thesis 
in order to focus on the nature of the prouincia itself. In doing so, I have demonstrated 
firstly that a prouincia could be defined as a specific task and geographical area 
simultaneously. Secondly, in contrast to the prevailing view in the modern scholarship, I 
have shown that prouinciae could be circumscribed in specific geographical terms long 
before the development of permanent territorial empire. In both of these cases, the Senates 
definition of prouinciae was influenced fundamentally by the desire to separate imperium-
holders (and, in certain circumstances, imperium-holders and particular kingdoms). This 
influence almost certainly stemmed from earlier experiences of problems with joint 
commands and shared prouinciae and is indicative of the intensely competitive political 
climate in the Republic. In this practical sense, then, the use of the prouincia was generally 
consistent between the third and first centuries. 
Now that the complexities related to the uses of the prouincia have been singled 
out and analysed, the next stage for future research would be to re-connect these practical 
uses with the broader issues associated with the provincialisation and territorialisation 
of empire. It would be worth exploring, for example, to what extent the demarcation of 
prouinciae as a means of separating imperium-holders, as seen throughout this research, 
 See Ch.III.i. 
V.vi. Conclusions 
actually contributed to the development of a more rigid territorial empire. This would be 
especially relevant given that the predominant focus in modern scholarship has been on the 
important influences of administrative, institutional, military and economic factors on the 
territorialisation of empire. I have argued, for instance, that the coastal city of Side was 
used to demarcate a new prouincia Cilicia from an existing prouincia Asia around 
103/102. As Side still separated these prouinciae just over fifty years later when Cicero 
reluctantly proceeded to his prouincia Cilicia, one might seriously consider whether the 
original separation of imperium-holders in space shaped the frontiers of these prouinciae. 
With this in mind, we could ask to what extent the separation of magistrates and 
promagistrates in space profoundly influenced the form of the territorial Roman Empire 
more widely. If this was the case, then, it could be argued that the nature of the prouincia 
per se played a more significant role in the territorialisation of empire than has often 
been recognised.  
It would be worthwhile extending these lines of inquiry into the Principate, given 
that my own discussion of prouinciae nominally stops at 49. One of the primary questions 
would be whether the principles associated with the demarcation of prouinciae in the 
Republic still applied more or less during the early Principate? Furthermore, if the process 
of territorialisation of empire occurred more rapidly during the latter period, as some 
scholars have proposed, we might even consider to what extent this could have been 
influenced by the definitions of the various prouinciae Caesaris and prouinciae populi 
Romani from 27 onwards.
 I noted earlier, for example, that the formula of proconsul of 
a specific prouincia appears in the Principate (e.g. procos. Asiae):
 how common was 
this type of phrase and did it represent a significant development in the way that the 
Romans viewed their empire?  
 For the terminology of the prouinciae under the Principate I follow the classic study by Millar (2002a). 
 ILS 986, l.9. 
V.vi. Conclusions 
Finally, what was the place of the emperor in the process of territorialisation of 
empire, especially as a world conqueror or as a guardian of land and sea  following a 
precedent set by Cn. Pompeius Magnus in the 60s. What remained constant and what 
changed?  The conclusions presented in this thesis have provided new possible lines of 
inquiry through which the above questions may be approached and through which, it is 
hoped, many more questions may be posed.
