Abstract
This thesis documents the measurements of the W   (charged current Drell-Yan
Process) production cross section and the muon charge asymmetry. Experimental data and
Monte Carlo samples, from proton-proton collisions at a centre of mass energy of 13 TeV,
corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 44.3 fb1 are utilised; the data presented
was recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider during the year 2017.
The measurements are performed differentially in muon pseudorapidity || and are within
the W boson invariant mass in a kinematic fiducial volume of muon and neutrino transverse
momentum p
T > 30 GeV and muon pseudorapidity || < 2.4. The fiducial measurements
uncertainties are below 2% empowering these measurements to constrain the modelling of
the proton composition.

Introduction
The understanding at the most fundamental level of Nature has been a critical goal of sci-
entific research since the beginning of modern science. Physics has helped substantially
to achieve this ambitious goal. Namely, Elementary Particle Physics is an ideal candidate
given it addresses the task to describe the interaction of elementary particles (the build-
ing blocks of matter) at the smallest scale; the theoretical description is based on powerful
quantum field theories (QFTs) which yield an unprecedented physical insight of this kind
of interactions. The combination of two QFTs, Electroweak Interaction (EWI) and Quan-
tum Chromodynamics (QCD), makes up the Standard Model (SM) of Elementary Particle
Physics and describes the particle behaviour at subatomic level. High energy experiments
have been widely used to test the SM, as the constituents of matter interact in a simple way,
in which case the most precise theoretical predictions exist. Nowadays, the highest energy
experimentally produced in the laboratory is provided by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland, and whose centre of mass energy, for proton-proton (pp)
collisions, is 13 TeV [1]. Consequently the validity of the Standard Model it is being tested
in a new energy range.
The ATLAS detector, one of the main detectors located at the LHC, collected data during
the year 2017; these data have been studied to extract information about the structure of the
proton, being the proton a composite particle of elementary quarks and gluons. Considering
the charged Drell-Yann process in pp collisions aims to improve the current precision of some
definite parton distribution functions (PDFs) and thus throwing light to the underlying dy-
namics of the strongly interacting particles (QCD) associated with them.
The thesis is structured as follows: Chapter 2 contains the theory needed to appreci-
ate the physics behind the charged current Drell-Yan process and guide the measurements
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 15
performed in this thesis. Chapter 3 explains very briefly the LHC and the ATLAS experi-
ment, focussing in the more relevant variables and components for the present measurements.
Chapter 5 gives a description of the data used in this analysis and the simulated samples, in
order to compare the experimental data against prediction. Chapter 6 describes how events
in the ATLAS detector are simulated and reconstructed, and explains the way of which the
detector effects change the event reconstruction. Chapter 7 presents the event selection cuts
chosen to select the largest possible amount of W bosons while maintaining the potential
background signals low. Chapter 8 details the methodology to compute the multijet back-
ground which is not reliably calculated using standard Monte Carlo techniques, it is found
that this background contributes approximately 1% to the final number of events. Chap-
ter 9 treats the uncertainties that affect the final measurements, yielding a total uncertainty
of around 2%. Chapter 10 displays a comparison between data and predicted signal and
backgrounds of key kinematic distributions, this helps to validate the selection criteria and
event weights considered. Chapter 11 presents the cross section and muon charge asymmetry
measurements, along with the unfolding techniques and propagation of uncertainties. Con-
clusions are presented in Chapter 12.
The analysis documented in the present thesis, was carried out utilising several types of
inputs:
 The samples considered for data and Monte Carlo in this analysis are centrally pro-
duced by the ATLAS Physics Modelling Group (PMG). The author requested derived
samples1 to the PMG, the samples were needed to comply with the Charged Current
Drell-Yan analysis phase space (see Chapter 5).
 The author customised an official ATLAS software; namely, the AnalysisTop2 software
was chosen, given its high flexibility and the fact that it is under constant develop-
ment and improvement. AnalysisTop performs all the centrally produced corrections
and calibrations to physics objects derived by the ATLAS physics groups (JetEtMiss,
Muon Combined Performance, Pileup). Additionally, AnalysisTop handles most of
the corresponding systematics. The software customisation consisted in adapting it to
process the truth information coming from W bosons and adding extra variables and
corrections.
 Once the calibrations and corrections are done, the author created a framework to
1Derived samples are samples which have passed several different kinematic cuts. It is convenient to use
derived samples to reduce the size of them and consider only events of interest in a given analysis.

process the outcome of the customised AnalysisTop software. The plots and tables
presented in Chapters 5-11 are the result of this framework, i.e. the plots labelled with
the legend CCDY Analysis were produced with this framework and the tables which
contain the results are also part of the frameworks outcome.
Chapter 2
Theory
This chapter is devoted to give the theoretical ideas which motivate and guide the measure-
ments within the LHC and the ATLAS experiment. It starts with a short recapitulation of
the Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics. Parton distribution functions are pre-
sented, since setting constrains on them is one of the main aims of the W   measurement.
Then, the Drell-Yan process is explained. Finally, a brief landscape of the measurement doc-
umented in this thesis is provided.
2.1 The Standard Model
The Standard Model asserts that matter in the Universe is made up of elementary fermions,
half integer spin particles, that interact through fields; these fields have associated elemen-
tary particles called bosons, integer spin particles. The fundamental fermion interactions
described by the SM can be: i) electromagnetic and weak interactions whose mediators are
the photon  and the W and Z bosons and the QFT which describes them is the Elec-
troweak theory and ii) strong interaction, whose mediators are the gluons and Quantum
Chromodynamics is its QFT [2].
The SM fermions are classified as leptons and quarks. Leptons are particles which are
affected only by the electroweak interaction; leptons are divided as charged and neutral
leptons, the former carry electric charge of integer units of the electron charge e and the
latter carry no electric charge. On the other hand, quarks have fractional electric charges
+2/3, 1/3 e; moreover, besides the electromagnetic and weak forces, quarks are also af-
fected by the strong interaction as they have an extra degree of freedom called colour charge
described theoretically by QCD. It is a remarkable fact that in Nature is possible to find

between each generation is the flavour quantum and mass found in the Particle Data Group
(PDG) report [4].
leptons in free states, meanwhile, due to the colour confinement, quarks are always found in
bound colourless particle states called hadrons.
By construction the SM is consistent with special relativity and quantum mechanics,
empowering it to describe elementary particles which are subatomic and relativistic. The
combination of special relativity and quantum mechanics establishes the existence of an-
tifermions, i.e. there is an antifermion for each fermion already stated before with opposite
quantum numbers.
Symmetries play a fundamental role within the SM. Noethers theorem, which states
that symmetries in a theory manifest themselves as laws of conservation, leads to the exper-
imentally observed conservation of energy, angular momentum and charge, when requiring
the SM Lagrangian to be invariant under local-gauge transformations. Each generator of a
gauge invariant theory must correspond to a gauge boson, a force carrier. The SM follows the
gauge group SU(3)cSU(2)LU(1)Y symmetry1, where the SU(3) factor stands for QCD
and its eight gauge bosons (gluons); the electroweak sector is symmetric under SU(2)U(1)
transformation yielding the gauge bosons W, Z0 and the photon  [2, 3].
Table 2.1 shows the leptons and their properties, Table 2.2 the quarks, and Table 2.3
displays the interaction mediators bosons [4].
2.1.1 Electroweak theory
The electroweak sector of the Standard Model is composed by the electromagnetic and weak
quantum field theories. In a quantum field theory, particles interact by exchanging virtual
quanta which mediate the force. The simplest and most successful QFT is Quantum Elec-

and Y to the weak hypercharge quantum number.

trodynamics (QED) and takes care of describing the electromagnetic interaction between
charged leptons and photons (mediators). The SM is written in terms of Lagrangian densi-
ties, from which equations of motion are derived. To obtain the QED Lagrangian density,
start with the Lagrangian density for a charged lepton, or charged fermion field (x):
L = i
[(x)(x) (x)(x)]m(x)(x), (2.1)
where the bar above the fermion field denotes the Dirac conjugation,  are the Dirac
matrices2 and m the lepton mass. Following Noethers theorem for conserved electric charge,
and the fact that the charge produces the electromagnetic field in space, it is required L to
be invariant under the local U(1)-group transformation,
(x) (x) = exp[i(x)](x), (2.2)
where (x) is the phase angle which generates the U(1) local rotations, and
(x) exp[i(x)][(x) + i(x)(x)]. (2.3)
Evidently, the above transformation does not keep the same structure of L, and to remedy
the latter, a covariant derivative D is defined that satisfies
D(x) exp[i(x)]D(x), (2.4)
the invariance of the derivative on (x), expressed in the previous equation, is achieved if
D =   igA(x); A  A(x) + g1(x), (2.5)
where g is the called the coupling constant and A(x) is a gauge field. The insertion of the
vector field A(x), has to be accounted for in L by adding a free term consistent with the
local gauge invariance,
F = A(x) A(x). (2.6)
To write L for QED, identify g with the electron charge e and A(x) with the photon ,
therefore the QED Lagrangian density reads as:
LQED = (x)(iD(x)m)(x)
F(x)F
(x). (2.7)
2The notation is such that x represents the four dimensional space-time and the Greek indices, e.g.  run
over this coordinate system ( = 1, 2, 3, 4).
CHAPTER 2. THEORY 21
Finally it is important to mention that the U(1) gauge boson is Abelian, therefore the photon
has no self-interactions.
To account for the dynamics of the neutrally charged neutrinos and to describe slow
processes such as nuclear  decays3, a weak interaction force is introduced. In principle
the symmetry group for the weak factor of the theory is SU(2)L, nevertheless, charged
leptons are also affected by this weak interaction, hence is natural to encapsulate both the
electromagnetic and weak interaction in a SU(2)LU(1)Y gauge transformation. The choice
of the SU(2)L symmetry is inspired by having a theory which supersedes the problems of
the Fermis contact theory and to incorporate novel experimental observations, e.g. parity
violation,  and  decays or heavy quarks and mixing. The Lagrangian density parity
violation feature, is incorporated with the division in right-hand and left-hand components
of the fermion field (x), L(x) = (1/2)(1 5)(x) and R(x) = (1/2)(1 + 5)(x),
Lf = i
f=leptons,quarks
[fL(x)
fL(x) + fR(x)
fR(x)]. (2.8)
The local SU(2)LU(1)Y transformation applies in a different manner to the left-hand and
right-hand components of the lepton field,
L(x) = exp[i((x)SW +
i(x)Y W
)]L(x), 
R(x) = exp[
i(x)Y W
]R(x), (2.9)
here the weak isospin SW and the weak hypercharge Y W/2 are the generators of the gauge
transformations of SU(2)L and U(1)Y , respectively; (x) and (x) are the phases used to
localise the gauge transformations. To maintain the symmetry under this transformation,
analogous to the electromagnetic previous case, covariant derivatives are defined as:
DfL(x) = [ 
 W(x) +
B(x)]fL(x), DfR(x) = [ + ig
B(x)]fR(x),
(2.10)
where  are the Pauli matrices, W and B the gauge fields, and g
 the gauge coupling. Note
when SW = 1/2 the matrices k/2 are the generators of the SU(2) transformations. Fol-
lowing the previous case, a free Lagrangian term for the fields just introduced is determined
L0 = 
Wa(x)W
a (x)
B(x)B
(x), (2.11)
3These processes were regarded as slow/weak since the mean lives of decays are very long (minutes),
compared with typical nuclear electromagnetic decays ( 1015 s).
CHAPTER 2. THEORY 22
where W a(x) is a tensor of a non-Abelian field (a, b, c = 1, 2, 3),
Wa(x) = Wa(x) Wa(x) + gabcWb(x)Wc(x), (2.12)
B(x) is a tensor field of an Abelian field
B(x) = B(x) B(x). (2.13)
The interpretation of the previous equations could be summarised as claiming that the
unbroken local SU(2)L  U(1)Y symmetry leads to the existence of four massless vector
bosons, three correspond to SU(2)L with gauge coupling g and one to U(1)Y with gauge
coupling g. Gauge invariant theories do not allow mass terms for gauge bosons because
they would break the gauge invariance and spoil the renormalisability. This appears to be
problematic for weak interactions, which are short-ranged and require massive mediators.
A simple application of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB)4 could solve the present
problem, particularly the Higgs mechanism. The Higgs Lagrangian density for a scalar
complex Higgs field (x) is:
LH = |D(x)|2  V (), (2.14)
where D is a covariant derivative and the Higgs potential V () is defined as
V () =
2(x)(x) +
[(x)(x)]2, (2.15)
with  > 0, 2 < 0, the vacuum expectation value 0|(x)|0 6= 0 and  = 0 is a local
minimum. Adding LH to the theory and choosing a convenient gauge5, the vacuum is no
longer invariant under local gauge transformations and the Higgs Lagrangian density can be
expressed in terms of the Higgs field around the non-zero vacuum expectation value. Finally,
to identify the gauge fields W a and B of Equation (2.10) with the Z, W
 bosons, consider
the covariant derivative in Equation (2.10) and insert it in LH , to obtain
|D(x)|2 = m2WW (x)W (x) +
m2ZZ(x)Z
(x), (2.16)
where
g2 + g2
, mW =
, (2.17)
4Spontaneously broken symmetry is when the symmetry of the equations of motion is broken adding
small terms in the solutions; conversely, the symmetry may be broken explicitly adding small terms in the
equations themselves.
5A convenient gauge means that, by the Higgs mechanism, the Goldstone bosons become the longitudinal
components of the massive vector bosons W and Z.
CHAPTER 2. THEORY 23
are the Z and W boson masses, respectively; v the minimum of the Higgs potential, and
W 1  iW 2
, W  W , W   W+ . (2.18)
Thus, the weak interaction bosons acquire mass whereas the photon is kept massless. The
W and Z bosons were discovered at CERN by the UA1 and UA2 collaborations in 1983
[5, 6].
2.1.2 Quantum chromodynamics
QCD is the theory of strong interactions between quarks and gluons, each flavour or type
of quark, u, s, d, c, b, t has colour charge, which are conventionally labelled as red (R), green
(G) and blue (B). There is an unbroken non-chiral (parity conserving) symmetry SU(3)c
that generate the above mentioned 8 gauge massless gluons, Gi. The simplest interactions
between quarks/gluons are quark-quark interaction mediated by a gluon. Additional in-
teractions in the SU(3)c group are non-Abelian, there are three- and four-point gluon self
interactions. Additionally, dominant higher order corrections can be taken into account in
an effective running coupling gs(Q
2) where Q2 is the momentum transfer; gs(Q
2) depends
on the renormalisation scale .
The strong force becomes stronger at long distances or low-momentum transfer, and
weaker at short distances or high momentum transfer, this is manifested in colour confine-
ment and asymptotic freedom, these features of the strong interactions are contained in the
running coupling written as,
[1 + gs(2)0ln(Q2/2)]
; 0 =
33 2Nf
, (2.19)
where Nf is the number of quark flavours present at the scale Q
2. It is important to state
that there is a similar expression for QED, but with negative sign for the logarithmic part.
The Lagrangian density for QCD, LQCD, is constructed in the same way as the QED and
electroweak cases,
LQCD =

and the quark gauge covariant derivative is
D  (D) =  +

here G represents the gluon field in matrix notation.
2.2 The structure of the proton: PDFs
The current knowledge of QCD and proton structure is a vital tool in helping disentangle
and interpret potential signals of new physics at the LHC. The progress of understanding
the proton structure began with deep inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments where one en-
ergetic lepton hits a proton; the target was dissociated to large invariant mass states in the
interaction. The data from the SLAC experiments in 1967 prompted Feynman to develop
the parton model for DIS experiments, in which the observed scaling behaviour is naturally
explained as point-like elastic scattering of free partons within the protons, subsequently
these point-like constituents were identified as the quarks [7].
The quark parton model describes the nucleons as consisting of massless point-like spin
1/2 quarks which are free within the nucleon. The parton distribution functions fi(x) in
the quark parton model are a number of densities of parton flavour i with fraction x of the
parent nucleons energy and longitudinal momentum. Often the momentum weighted xif(x)
are used. In standard notation the antiquark PDFs are denoted xif(x), and PDFs for each
quark flavour u, d, s, c, b [8].
Deeply inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering cross sections are calculated from incoherent
sums of elastic lepton-parton processes. More generally, the hadronic cross section for a
process of two hadrons A and B interacting, A+B  X, being X any final state, is written
A,BX =
dx1dx2f
i (x1)f
j (x2)  i,jX + [x1  x2], (2.23)
where i,jX is the partonic cross section for interactions of two partons with flavour i and
j. The fact that the PDFs in the last equation are universal is known as the factorisation
property: PDFs extracted from an analysis of inclusive DIS measurements can be used to
calculate cross sections of other processes in lepton-hadron or hadron-hadron interactions.
CHAPTER 2. THEORY 25
The domain of validity of this first order approximation is the asymptotic scaling limit,
s  , M2X/s fixed, where s is the centre-of-mass energy and MX is the invariant mass
of the decay products. To include gluon corrections is necessary to take account of the
logarithmic divergences into the PDFs making them dependent on a factorisation scale F ,
therefore the PDFs in Equation (2.23) are substituted by fAi (x1, ) and f
j (x2, ), the 
evolution is given by the DGLAP equations,
dG(x, 2)
dln2
qj(z, 
2) + PGG
G(z, 2)
, (2.24)
dqi(x, 
dln2
qi(z, 
2) + PqG
G(z, 2)
(2.25)
here qi, the quark densities, include both qi and qi, G is the gluon density; Pfifj are the
splitting functions which describe the probability of a parton fi to emit a parton fj carrying
a fraction z  1 of the fi momentum. The splitting functions are perturbative and can be
expanded in gs. The zeroth order yields the leading-order (LO) approximation (one factor gs
is already extracted in Equation (2.24)-Equation (2.25)). The next-to-leading-order (NLO)
terms of the order of O(gns (ln2)n1), involve the O(gs) corrections to the splitting functions.
The splitting functions have been calculated to next-to-next-leading-order (NNLO) which
are used in recent analyses of PDFs [912].
2.3 Charged Current Drell-Yan
In their paper [14] Sidney D. Drell and Tung-Mow Yan predicted the dilepton production,
i.e. a neutral current process of large lepton invariant mass pair production in a hadron-
hadron collision, based on parton model ideas; this is referred to as neutral current Drell-
Yan (NCDY) process since the mediator boson involved carries neutral electric charge, the
Z boson, and the two final state leptons possess opposite electric charges, the sum of their
charges is zero. For the charged current Drell-Yan (CCDY) process, the principles are the
same as for NCDY process, where the basic process is a quark and antiquark interacting to
produce an on-shell or off-shell charged W boson of invariant mass mW and decaying into
one charged lepton and a neutral charged lepton (qq  W  ll), the sum of the charges
of the final state leptons is not zero, see Figure 2.1. This cross section is easily obtained using
similar techniques of quantum electrodynamics, with the addition of appropriate colour and
charge factors [15],
W |Vqq|2(sm2W ), (2.26)
CHAPTER 2. THEORY 26
Figure 2.1: Feynman diagram of the partonic W production process. The quark and anti-
quark are assumed to come from the colliding protons. The W bosons have leptonic and
hadronic decay modes. The former corresponds to a charged lepton and a neutral lepton
in the final state, W  l, where l represents either a electron, a muon or a tau (in this
work only the decay to muons is considered); the hadronic decay modes are W  +,
W  D+s , W  cX, W  cs, where + is a pi meson,  is a photon, D+s is a d meson,
c is a charm quark, s is a strange quark and X is a inclusive final state. Finally the W
boson could decay into a charged particle with momentum below experimental detectability
(< 200 MeV).
where GF is the Fermi weak coupling constant, Vqq is the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
(CKM) matrix element6 corresponding to the qq quarks, s is the square of the centre-of-
mass energy of the incoming quarks qq, and  is the Dirac delta distribution. The use of
the Fermi constant manifests that the cross section it is calculated at leading-order.
To calculate the CCDY cross section in a hadron-hadron collision is necessary to relate
the hadron and parton dynamics. The square centre-of-mass energy of a hadron-hadron
collision s, in terms of the four-momentums of the incoming partons p
1 and p
2 , reads as,
(x1, 0, 0, x1), p
(x2, 0, 0,x2), (2.27)
it follows that s = x1x2s. By combining Equation (2.23), Equation (2.26) and Equa-
tion (2.27) it is obtained the hadron-hadron CCDY cross section,

electroweak decays.

The resulting cross section can then be multiplied by the branching ratios for any particular
hadronic or leptonic final state of interest. These calculations have been performed to the
next-to-leading-order precision using a given set of PDFs, this is shown in Figure 2.2.
In the context of LHC experimental measurements, in this range of energies the produc-
tion cross sections of weak vector bosons (charged current Drell-Yan processes) are relatively
large and since these processes provide an easily identifiable decays to leptonic final states,
they offer a clean experimental signature which can be measured to high precision. The
cross sections are dependent on the parton distribution functions (PDFs) and thus to the
underlying dynamics of strongly interacting particles (QCD). In particular, the production
and decay to an antimuon (muon) and a neutrino (antineutrino) of the W charged bosons

pp W   is of interest because it is expected to contain information of the interplay
of pairs of parton (quark) flavour distributions, i.e. ud, us, ub, cd, cs, cb for the W+ boson
and du, dc, su, sc, bu, bc for the W boson. Therefore, the benchmark measurements of the
W production offer a unique opportunity to test models of parton dynamics at the LHC.
The kinematic region accessible, is in part driven by the detectors, for example the ATLAS
detector has a rapidity constrain of |y| < 2.5 (for precision analyses); in the case of W/Z bo-
son production from partons with momentum fractions x1 and x2, mW,Z = sx1x2, inspecting
Equation (2.27) the rapidity of the lepton pair it is deduced to be y = 1/2 lnx1/x2, and
mW,Z
ey, x2 =

These expressions restrict the x range at
s = 7 TeV to approximately 103 < x < 101,
the range will be enhanced by a factor of two when the LHC reaches its design centre of
mass energy of
s = 14 TeV.
CHAPTER 2. THEORY 29
2.4 Next-to-next-leading-order parton distribution func-
tions
The probability to find a parton (quarks and gluons) of a given flavour in the proton, is
described by the PDFs as a function of the fraction of the protons momentum carried by the
parton. One of the most recent parton distributions sets, is the NNPDF3.1 set determined
at NNLO [12]. The determination of the PDFs relies on experimental results from hard
scattering interaction experiments; e.g.:
 The H1 and ZEUS experiments, at the HERA electron-proton collider, provided the
majority of the precision DIS structure functions data over a wide kinematic region
[16]. The precision achieved by these experiments was of few percentages. Additionally,
the HERA experiments determined the behaviour of the valence PDFs at low Bjorken
x  103 with an unprecedented precision, this was done with the aid of neutral cur-
rent measurements [17]. Lastly, charged current DIS experiments provided important
advance to constrain the quark flavour separation [18].
 The experiments E605 and E775 measured the di-muon production in Drell-Yan in-
teractions of a proton off a fixed target. These experiments were fed by the Tevatron
proton beam and double-differential cross sections in invariant mass and the rapidity
of the di-lepton pair were determined. Important information on the up and down sea
quark densities was extracted [19, 20].
 The D0 and CDF experiments located at the Tevatron, which collided proton and
anti-protons, measured the lepton charge asymmetry, which gave information of the
up and down quark PDFs [21, 22]; precise measurements of the rapidity distribution in
Z  l+l were performed to provide constraints on the quark densities at Q2  M2Z ,
over a broad range in Bjorken x [23, 24].
It is of special interest, for searches of physics beyond the SM, to bring the precision of
PDFs down to percent level; to achieve the latter a number of recent experimental results
need to be combined, namely, TevatronsW boson asymmetries, LHC (ATLAS, CMS, LHCb)
experiments have released inclusive jet production, gauge boson production and top quark
production results, and the above mentioned legacy measurements of DIS structure functions
from HERA are available. Moreover, new high-precision QCD calculations of hadron collider
processes with direct sensitivity to PDFs are completed. All these ingredients are used to
determine the PDFs displayed in Figure 2.3. The methodology to extract the PDFs from
experimental data is outlined for example in [7]. In the plots of Figure 2.3, the vertical axis
CHAPTER 2. THEORY 30
is the parton density and the horizontal axis is the parton fractional momentum; the shapes
shown, are accompanied by bands to state the uncertainties (from both experiment and
theory); the labels for each curve, related by colours, refer to the parton flavour; moreover,
qv specifies the correspondence to a valence quark. Left plot of Figure 2.3 displays the PDFs
in the case of 2 = 10 GeV2, the valence quarks, uv and dv, dominate at high momentum
fraction, whilst the sea quarks dominate at low momentum. Right plot of Figure 2.3 displays
the PDFs in the case of 2 = 104 GeV2, the behaviour is similar with respect to the previous
case, the only difference is that sea quark densities are larger at low momentum.
2.5 Measurement overview
The charge asymmetry of the W boson production (i.e. the cross section of the produced
W boson is larger or smaller depending on its charge) in pp head-on collisions arises since
the positive charged valence quarks are slightly more dominant inside the positive charged
proton, henceforth this result helps to study definite quark distributions as stated below.
The asymmetry between the production of W+ and W bosons have been reported for the
experiments carried out by the CDF and D0 collaborations [21, 22, 25, 26] at the Fermi-
labs Tevatron; these measurements proved their importance to constrain the proton PDFs.
Namely the u and d quark distributions reached stronger constrains w.r.t. previous deter-
minations [21, 25]; the available centre of mass energy was 1.8 TeV, and the Bjorken x
was explored in the 0.007 < x < 2.4 boundary, nevertheless these measurements, published
in 1995-1998, suffered large experimental uncertainties. In 2008 and 2009 new results were
available from the D0 [22, 26] and the CDF [27] collaborations, two orders of magnitude more
of Tevatrons data allowed to reduce the total uncertainty to 15%, the latter constrained
further the u and d PDFs using both the electron and muon channels. Fermilab analyses
conducted proton-antiproton results; whereas the LHC collided only protons and opened a
new Bjorken x range with the centre of mass energy of
s = 7 TeV. In 2011 the ATLAS [28]
and CMS [29, 30] collaborations determined the charge asymmetry with a precision of 8%,
improving further the proton PDFs. The latest published result was performed by the CMS
collaboration [31] in 2014; in their paper the muon charge asymmetry was reckoned using
4.7 fb1 of pp data with centre of mass energy of 7 TeV, the precision achieved is of 1.6% in
every pseudorapidity bin; their paper also shows the constrain of the proton distributions of
light quarks by fitting the unfolded data, the PDFs determination is improved in the x range
from 103 to 101. The ATLAS collaboration will publish a similar result for
s = 8 TeV
data using 20 fb1 pp collision data.
Chapter 3
Experiment
This chapter presents a general overview of the Large Hadron Collider functioning. Fur-
thermore, it contains a summary of the details of the ATLAS experiment and the different
components that comprises the latter. Special care is given to the muon detection system,
as muons are the central focus of this thesis.
3.1 Large Hadron Collider
One recently exploited approach to study elementary particles, is the use of particle accel-
erators by means of colliding the former. High energies make possible to produce massive
particles1; likewise, high energetic particles help to probe the structure of hadrons, since
the collision energy typically exceeds the binding effect of the strongly interacting hadron
constituents. The highest energy and largest particle accelerator in the world is the Large
Hadron Collider; it is a two-ring-superconducting-magnet-hadron synchrotron and collider
installed in a 26.7 km tunnel 100 meters underground between France and Switzerland near
Geneva at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The LHC second period
of operations started in 2015; from then on, proton collisions2 at the LHC have reached a
centre of mass energy of 13 TeV (14 TeV is the design energy), i.e. each of its two rings
accelerates protons at 6.5 TeV and then are bring to collide head-on at an energy of 13 TeV.
In order to achieve the highest energy, starting from a simple bottle of hydrogen gas, several
different stages take place: an electric field is used to strip hydrogen atoms of their electrons
to yield protons. Linac 2, the first accelerator in the process, accelerates the protons to the
1Mass can transform into energy and vice-versa in accordance with Einsteins equation E = mc2.
2Before the construction of the LHC, in the same tunnel was installed the Large Electron-Positron collider
(LEP), nevertheless, in spite to the fact that such collisions were clean (no QCD multijet contamination)
with respect to proton collisions, the energy was limited due to losses from synchrotron radiation.
CHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENT 32

energy of 50 MeV. The beam is then injected into the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB),
which accelerates the protons to 1.4 GeV, followed by the Proton Synchrotron (PS), which
pushes the beam to 25 GeV. Protons are then sent to the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS)
where they are accelerated to 450 GeV. Finally the protons are fed to the two beam pipes
of the LHC; the beam pipes circulate protons in opposite directions, in this manner head
on proton-proton take place at the interaction points (IP), see Section 3.2. The beam pipes
are in a ultra-high vacuum to avoid collisions or interactions with gas molecules. Figure 3.1
depicts the configuration of the CERNs accelerator complex and sketches the positions of
each accelerator [32].
In accelerator physics a very useful quantity called luminosity, L, is defined as measure
of amount of data collected:
Ldt = N, (3.1)
where  is the cross section (event rate) of the process, N is the number of events and dt
is the time interval. The luminosity of a beam made of particles is the number of particles
passing down the beamline per unit time, per unit area [33],
L = f nb
, (3.2)
CHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENT 33
where f is the rotation frequency of the beams, nb is the number of particle bunches per
beam, A is the transverse colliding area of the beam and np is the number of protons in the
beam. L is a variable which can be controlled, hence with this parameter it is possible to
enhance the event rate of a process of interest, which usually has a small cross section.
In the LHC, protons circulate around the rings in well-defined bunches (the bunch struc-
ture of a modern accelerator is the result of the radio frequency acceleration scheme). In
the LHC, the proton beams have 2808 bunches each containing about 1011 protons. The
bunches are squeezed and expanded at various places of the LHC; for instance, they get
squeezed as much as possible around the interaction point to increase the probability of a
collision, i.e., reducing A in Equation (3.2) increases the luminosity, on the other hand, the
bunches are expanded to study the elastic scattering of protons, i.e., the area of interaction
becomes smaller, therefore it is less likely that the protons break down and only exchange
momentum takes place. Increasing the number of bunches is one of the ways to increase the
luminosity; at full luminosity, the LHC uses a bunch spacing of 25 ns (or 7.5 m), which means
that the proton bunches collide 40 million times per second. The LHC design instantaneous
luminosity at 14 TeV is 1034 cm2 s1.
A consequence of requiring high luminosities, when two bunches of protons cross at the
IP, is the occurrence of additional proton-proton collision besides the physics interesting one,
this is effect is called pileup [32, 34]. A very careful treatment of pileup must to be considered,
as the pileup will affect the detector response when looking at a pp interaction of interest
i.e. the detector will observe it as the superposition of its final state and the products of the
additional pileup and zero-bias interactions (inelastic hadron-hadron collisions dominated
by low momentum) that occurred during the same bunch crossing. Pileup thus affects the
majority of the objects reconstructed in the final state and compromises the precision at
which the kinematic properties of these objects can be measured: energy deposits originated
from pileup decay products could potentially overlap with interesting particle/objects signa-
tures, leading to energy, momentum and topology miscalculation; namely, the main pileup
contribution comes from hadrons, hence the most affected final objects are the ones which
contain hadrons, but also affecting isolation criteria for leptons and photons [35].
Integrating (summing) the luminosities of data taking during the years 2015, 2016 and
2017 yields a total luminosity of nearly 80 fb1. Figure 3.2 shows the luminosity delivered
by the LHC, the luminosity recorded by ATLAS and the luminosity useful for physics. The
delivered luminosity accounts for the luminosity delivered from the start of stable beams
until the LHC control centre requested ATLAS to configure the detector in a safe standby
mode to allow beam dumps or beam studies. The recorded luminosity reflects the DAQ
inefficiency, as well as the inefficiency of the so-called warm start. The All Good Data

3.2 ATLAS Experiment
Around the LHC are four main interaction points, where four experiments/detectors were
constructed: ATLAS, ALICE, LHCb and CMS [34]. ATLAS and CMS are multipurpose ex-
periments devoted to measure a wide variety of processes (Higgs, SM, SUSY, new physics).
The LHCb experiment is for b and c hadron physics and ALICE is dedicated to measure
heavy ion collisions.
The ATLAS (A toroidal LHC apparatus) detector is the one used to perform the W 
 measurement in this thesis. As mentioned above, it is difficult to observe interesting
physics because of their small cross sections; furthermore, pileup and the QCD multijet
background, due to the nature of pp collisions, dominate the cross sections; more precisely,
the W production cross section is six orders of magnitude smaller with respect to the total
pp cross section: a good interesting physics signatures identification is demanded.
CHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENT 35
The capability to detect a particle is dictated by the nature of the particle itself. Heavy
particles are not possible to be detected given their short life times; quantum confinement
forbids to directly detect gluons and quarks; thus, the particles that can be directly detected
are photons, electrons, muons, protons, neutrons and long-lived mesons such as pions and
kaons. Neutrinos are not detected in ATLAS because their weak interaction with matter
would require much larger apparatus dimensions [37].
Integrating all the above regards to detect the pp collisions debris, the ATLAS detec-
tor requires fast, radiation-hard electronics and sensor elements; in addition, high detector
granularity is needed to handle the particle fluxes and to reduce the effects of overlapping
events. Is essential to have a good charged-particle momentum resolution and reconstruction
efficiency. Very good electromagnetic (EM) calorimetry for electron and photon identifica-
tion/measurements, complemented by hadronic calorimetry for jet and missing transverse
energy are also required. Furthermore, needs to have good muon identification and momen-
tum resolution. Finally the triggering on low transverse momentum objects with sufficient
background rejection is very important. Following all these main guidelines the ATLAS de-
tector was designed and constructed. The ATLAS detector is nominally forward-backward3
symmetric with respect to the interaction point; has three main sub detectors: the inner
detector (ID), the hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters, and the muon spectrometer.
The magnet configuration comprises a thin superconducting solenoid surrounding the ID
cavity, and three large superconducting toroids (one barrel and two end-caps) arranged with
an eight-fold azimuthal symmetry around the calorimeters. Finally trigger and data acquisi-
tion systems are part of the ATLAS detector. Upcoming sections address individually these
systems. Figure 3.3 shows the schematic diagram of the detector.
3.2.1 ATLAS coordinate system and variables
The ATLAS coordinate reference frame is as follows. The nominal interaction point is defined
as the origin of the coordinate system, while the beam direction defines the z-axis and the
x-y plane is transverse to the beam direction. The positive x-axis is defined as pointing
from the interaction point to the centre of the LHC ring and the positive y-axis is defined
as pointing upwards. The azimuthal angle  is measured around the beam axis, and the
polar  is the angle from the beam axis. It is kinematically more convenient to use the

covered by special sub-detector components.

pseudorapidity coordinate instead of , defined as,
 =  ln
, (3.3)
(for massive objects, the rapidity y = ln[(E + pz)/(E  pz)] is used). The distance R in
the pseudorapidity-azimuthal angle space is defined as,
2 + 2. (3.4)
In the LHC, protons are accelerated around the rings and collide head-on. Given the com-
plexity of the protons structure, when a collision takes place, a significant amount of the
collision energy escapes down through the pipe (in the above established reference frame
this corresponds to the z direction), i.e., when an interesting physics collision takes place,
a hard collision, only one parton of each proton participates in the process, whereas the
momentum of the remaining partons is not greatly changed. Furthermore, considering con-
servation of energy and momentum, it is noted that the initial momentum before the collision
in the transverse plane to the beam pipe (x-y plane) is zero, henceforth this quantity must
be also zero after the collision. Thus it is extremely practical to define variables in the
CHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENT 37
transverse plane. For example the transverse momentum pT , which is the magnitude of the
momentum vector projected on the x-y plane, of a final state particle, is highly enhanced in
hard collisions, as opposed to elastic/diffractive scattering of the incoming particles. More-
over the transverse momentum of invisible particles for a detector, result of hard collisions,
is inferred with the transverse momentum of the detectable particles participating in this
process, defining the missing transverse energy EmissT , see Section 6.4. The previous two re-
gards imply the usefulness of the transverse plane variables in both pp and e+e colliders [38].
3.2.2 Inner Detector
The Inner Detector (ID) is dedicated to measure charged particle trajectories and locate
interaction vertices in a range of || < 2.5; it is immersed in a 2 T solenoid field (5.3 m long
with a diameter of 2.5 m) permitting a transverse momentum reconstruction resolution of
0.05%, by utilising the Lorentz force to relate it to the curvature of the particles trajec-
tory. Momentum and vertex measurements and electron identification are achieved with a
combination of discrete high-resolution silicon pixel (the closest to the IP) and semiconduc-
tor tracker (SCT) strip detectors in the inner part of the tracking volume, and straw-tube
tracking detector with the capability to generate and detect transition radiation4 in its outer
part, the transition radiation tracker (TRT). The ID is sketched in Figure 3.4.
Next to the vertex region, the highest granularity is attained by the pixel silicon detectors;
the pixel layers are segmented in R- and z, three pixel cylindrical layers around the beam
and three disks perpendicular to the these. All pixel sensors are identical and have a pixel
size in R-z of 50400m2. The hit resolutions in the barrel are 10m (R-) and 115m
(z) and in the disks are 10m (R-) and 115m (R). The pixel detector has approximately
80.4 million readout channels to collect the charged signals of a particle that hits a pixel.
The SCT strip layers have similar geometry with respect to the ID. In the barrel region,
the SCT uses double silicon strip layers, one with a small stereo angle (40 mrad) to measure
both coordinates (z and R-), and one parallel to the beam direction, measuring R-. In
the end-cap region, the detectors have a set of strips running radially and a layer of stereo
strips at an angle of 40 mrad. The mean pitch of the strips is also approximately 80 m.
The intrinsic spatial hit resolutions per module in the barrel are 17 m (R-) and 580 m
(z) and in the disks are 17 m (R-) and 580 m (R). The total number of readout channels
in the SCT is approximately 6.3 million.
A large number of hits (typically 36 per track) is provided by the 4 mm diameter straw
4Transition radiation is the electromagnetic radiation produced when a electrically charged particle passes
through a boundary of two different media.
CHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENT 38

tubes (drift tubes) of the TRT, which enables track-following up to || = 2.0. The TRT only
provides R- information, for which it has an intrinsic hit resolution of 130 m per straw.
In the barrel region, the straws are parallel to the beam axis and are 144 cm long, with their
wires divided into two halves, approximately at  = 0. In the end-cap region, the 37 cm
long straws are arranged radially in wheels. The total number of TRT readout channels is
approximately 351,000.
Combining the pixel and SCT trackers at small radii with the TRT at a larger radius, gives
a very good precision, in both R- and z coordinates, making possible to have a transverse
momentum measurement resolution of 0.05%. The straw hits at the outer radius contribute
significantly to the momentum measurement, since the lower precision per point, compared to
the silicon, is compensated by the large number of measurements and longer measured track
length. The inner detector system provides tracking measurements in a range matched by
the precision measurements of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The electron identification
capabilities are enhanced by the detection of transition-radiation photons in the xenon-based
gas mixture of the straw tubes.
CHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENT 39
Figure 3.5: ATLAS calorimetry cut away [38].
3.2.3 Calorimeters
The next step in the detector chain within ATLAS is the calorimetry system; the calorimetry
system surrounds the ID. This system is designed to absorb all the known particles coming
from a collision, except muons and neutrinos. The calorimeters measure the energy a par-
ticle releases when going through the detector using layers of a passive material interleaved
with layers of an active medium. During this process the particle produces electromagnetic
(electrons and photons) and hadronic (jets, see Section 6.3 for a jet definition) showers5
when interacting with the passive material which then ionise the active material, Figure 3.6
depicts an electromagnetic shower. Accordingly, the calorimeters must enclose these streams
of particles and limit punch-through into the muon system, i.e. the calorimeter depth is an
important design consideration.
The components of the ATLAS calorimetry system are: high granularity liquid-Argon
(LAr) electromagnetic sampling calorimeters that cover the pseudorapidity range || < 3.2;
and the hadronic calorimetry in the range || < 1.7 which is provided by a scintillator-tile
calorimeter, separated into a large barrel and two smaller extended barrel cylinders, one on
either side of the central barrel. In the end-caps, || > 1.5, LAr technology is also used
for the hadronic calorimeters, matching the outer || limits of the end-cap electromagnetic
5In this context, a particle shower is generated when an energetic particle interacts with a medium, this
interaction results in a torrent of secondary particles which will repeat this process until it is energetically
forbidden.
CHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENT 40

(positrons) with the matter. In this diagram the arrows represent electrons of the process; the
curly lines represent the photons which mediate the interaction.
calorimeters. The LAr forward calorimeters provide both electromagnetic and hadronic en-
ergy measurements and extend the coverage to || < 4.9. A view of the sampling calorimeters
is presented in Figure 3.5.
The electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter is accordion-shaped over its full coverage, this
geometry provides a complete  symmetry without azimuthal cracks. The EM calorimeter
is divided into a barrel part, || < 1.475, and two end-cap components that cover the
1.375 < || < 3.2 region. The total thickness of the EM calorimeter is > 22X0 (the
radiation length X0, is the mean distance an electron travels before its energy is reduced
to 1/e via bremsstrahlung radiation) in the barrel and > 24X0 in the end-caps. Given the
proximity to the central solenoid and to optimise material/performance, the EM calorimeter
and the central solenoid share a common vacuum vessel. The lead thickness in the absorber
plates has been optimised as a function of  in terms of EM calorimeter energy resolution
performance. For precision physics, || < 2.5, the EM calorimeter is segmented in three
sections in depth. For the end-cap inner wheel, the calorimeter is segmented in two sections
in depth and has a coarser lateral granularity compared with the rest of the acceptance.
In the region of || < 1.8, a presampler detector is used to correct for the energy lost by
electrons and photons upstream of the calorimeter.
Outside the EM calorimeter, the hadronic tile calorimeter is installed, its barrel region
CHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENT 41
covers || < 1.0 and its extended barrels 0.8 < || < 1.7. Instead of using LAr as active
material, the tile hadronic calorimeter uses scintillating tiles as the active material that
produces scintillation photons, measured in photomultiplier tubes, with hadronic and elec-
tromagnetic showers. The tile calorimeter dimensions form an inner radius of 2.28 m to an
outer radius of 4.25 m segmented in three layers, of approximately 1.5, 4.1 and 1.8 interac-
tion lengths (the interaction length, , is the average distance a hadron travels through a
medium before interacting) thick for the barrel and 1.5, 2.6, and 3.3  thick for the extended
barrel. The total detector thickness, at the outer edge of the tile-instrument region, is 9.7 
in the  = 0 region. The hadronic calorimeter is bigger than the EM calorimeter, since the
hadrons travel longer times before decaying and therefore it takes more distance to be able
to correctly detect the hadronic showers.
The end-cap regions are covered by an hadronic end-cap calorimeter (HEC), consists
of two independent wheels per end-cap, located after the EM calorimeter end-cap. To re-
duce drop in material density at the transition regions between the HEC and the forward
calorimeter, and the HEC and the tile calorimeter, overlap between the HEC and the tile is
set by extending the HEC in a pseudorapidity of 1.5 < || < 3.2. Each wheel is built from
wedges-shaped modules, inside there are cooper plates as the passive material and LAr the
active medium.
Finally, the forward calorimeter (FCal) is integrated in the end-cap to improve the cov-
erage and reduce radiation backgrounds arising from the passage to the muon spectrometer.
The front face of the FCal is recessed by  1.2 m with respect to the EM calorimeter front
face to control neutron backscattering and radiation coming from the ID. The FCal needs to
be highly dense, is approximately 10 interaction lengths deep, and consists of three modules
in each end-cap: the first, made of copper, is optimised for electromagnetic measurements,
while the other two, made of tungsten, measure predominantly the energy of hadronic in-
teractions. In the measurements reported in this document, only the region for precision
physics (|| < 2.5) is considered, hence muons detected by the FCal are not directly used.
3.2.4 Muon Spectrometer
The last subdetector of ATLAS is the muon spectrometer (MS). The calorimeters and the
inner detector are surrounded by the MS owing the fact that muons penetrate them. The
MS is capable to detect charged particles and to measure their momentum, the detection
is done through the Lorentz force experienced by charged particles under the influence of
the MS magnetic field, see Section 6.1.1. The air-core toroid system, with a long barrel and
two inserted end cap magnets, generates strong bending power for the muon tracks in a
CHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENT 42
large volume within a light and open structure; the high magnetic field strength is needed
to measure with good resolution high transverse momentum muons (at 1 TeV the MS has
a resolution of 10%). The large barrel toroid provides the magnetic bending in the range
of || < 1.4, whilst the end-caps cover the 1.6 < || < 2.7; finally, in the transition region,
1.4 < || < 1.6, magnetic deflection is provided by a combination of barrel and end-cap fields.
This configuration of magnets yields a magnetic field that it is mostly orthogonal to the muon
trajectories, while minimising the degradation of the multiple scattering, as it is expected
that the proton-proton collision produce a high amount of particles, the design and choice of
the spectrometer instrumentation has been driven by the optimisation of parameters such as
rate capability, granularity, ageing properties, and radiation hardness. In the barrel region,
tracks are measured in chambers arranged in three cylindrical layers around the beam axis;
in the transition and end-cap regions, the chambers are installed in planes perpendicular to
the beam, also in three layers.
The magnetic system is configured as follows, the two end-caps are inserted in the barrel
toroid at each end and aligned with the central solenoid. The toroids consist of eight coils
assembled radially and symmetrically around the beam axis. The end-cap toroid coil system
is rotated by 22.5 with respect to the barrel toroid system in order to provide radial overlap
and to optimise the bending power at the interface between the two coil systems. The
performance of the bending power is given by the magnetic field integral, being the magnetic
field normal to the muon direction and the integral is calculated along an infinite-momentum
muon trajectory, between the innermost and the outermost muon-chamber planes. The barrel
toroid provides 1.5 to 5.5 Tm of bending power in the pseudorapidity range of 0 < || < 1.4,
and the end-cap toroids approximately 1 to 7.5 Tm in the region 1.6 < || < 2.7. The
bending power is lower in the transition region where the two magnets overlap.
The MS covers the range of || < 2.7, and it is conformed by monitored drift tubes
(MDT), cathode strip chambers (CSC), resistive plate trigger-chambers (RPC) and thin gap
trigger-chambers (TGC). The MS defines the overall dimensions of the ATLAS detector,
Figure 3.7 shows the layout of the MS system [38].
The MDT chambers perform the precise determination of the muon momentum; consist of
three to eight layers of drift tubes and operate with Ar/CO2 gas at a pressure of 3 bar, the
electrons resulting from the ionisation are collected by central tungsten-rhenium wires, the
wires have a concentricity with respect to the tube with an accuracy of  < 10m. Building
the precision-tracking chambers using individual tubes, gives mechanical robustness as result
of the tube precision assembly; moreover, these chambers are reliable, since a failure of a
CHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENT 43
Figure 3.7: ATLAS muon spectrometer system cut away [38]
single tube does not affect the operation of most of the other tubes; finally, the cylindrical
geometry produces a radial electric field, consequently the measurement accuracy depends
weakly on the angle of incidence of the track on the chamber plane. The MDTs provide an
average resolution of 80m per tube or 35m per chamber.
In the forward region, 2.0 < || < 2.7, CSC chambers are instrumented in the end-cap inner
most tracking layer, due to their higher rate capability and time resolution with respect
to the MDTs; the CSC are multiwire chambers with cathode planes segmented into strips
in orthogonal directions, which combine high spatial, time and double track resolution with
high-rate capability and low neutron sensitivity; the region where the CSC chambers operate
is predicted to have a higher particle particle density flux. The whole CSC system consists
of two disks with eight chambers each, the chambers contain four CSC planes resulting in
four independent measurements in  and  along each track; this allows both coordinates
to be measured using the induced charge distribution. The resolution of a CSC chamber is
40m in the bending plane and about 80 mm in the transverse plane.
CHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENT 44
The resistive plate chambers act as trigger instrumentation in the barrel region. The RPCs
are located above and/or below the MDTs, forming three trigger stations and are capable
to select high or low momentum tracks depending on the trigger station. Each station
consists of two independent detector layers that measure  and  coordinates. A RPC is a
gaseous parallel electrode-plate detector, that are kept to each other at a distance of 2 mm
by insulting spacers; the electric field between the plates is about 4.9 kV/mm and allows
avalanches to form along the ionising tracks towards the anode. The signal is read out via
capacitive coupling to metallic strips, which are mounted on the outer faces of the resistive
plates. The gas used is a mixture of C2H2F4/Iso-C4H10/SF6 (94.7/5/0.3), this mixture
combines relatively low operating voltage, non-flammability and low cost, while providing
comfortable plateau for safe avalanche operation. The RPCs detection efficiency is  98.5%
per layer and  97% including spacers and frames.
The thin gap chambers are installed in the end-cap muon spectrometer, they perform trigger-
ing functions and determine a complement measurement of the azimuthal coordinate coming
from the MDTs: the middle layer of the MDTs in the end-cap is complemented by seven lay-
ers of TGCs; the inner layer is complemented by two layers. The radial (bending) coordinate
is measured by the TGC wire groups, whilst the azimuthal coordinate by radial strips. The
TGCs are multi-wire proportional chambers with the characteristic that the wire-to-cathode
distance of 1.4 mm is smaller than the wire-to-wire distance of 1.8 mm.
Combining both the RPC and TGC systems, fast trigger information of muon tracks is
provided. The RPC covers the barrel region || < 1.05 and the TGC the end cap region 1.4 <
|| < 2.4. The trigger chambers measure both coordinates of the track, one in the bending
() plane and one in the non-bending () plane. The purpose of the precision-tracking
chambers is to determine the coordinate of the track in the bending plane. After matching
the MDT and trigger chamber hits in the bending plane, the trigger chambers coordinate
in the non-bending plane is adopted as the second coordinate of the MDT measurement.
This method assumes that in any MDT/trigger chamber pair, a maximum of one track per
event is present, since having two or more tracks forbids the  and  hits combination in
an unambiguous way. Simulations have shown that the probability to find a track in the
muon spectrometer with pT > 6 GeV is close to 6 103 per beam-crossing, corresponding
to about 1.5  105 per chamber. Assuming uncorrelated tracks, this leads to a negligible
CHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENT 45
probability to find more than one track in any MDT/trigger chamber pair. When correlated
close-by-muon-tracks occur, caused for example by two-body-decays of low-mass particles,
the ambiguity in  and  assignment will be resolved by matching the muon track candidates
with tracks from the inner detector.
3.2.5 Trigger system
Many proton-proton collisions at the LHC are needed because the phenomena searched by
physicists occur at extremely low rates, meaning that these interesting events are difficult to
see; consequently, to have a significant chance to observe one such event, it is advantageous
a high proton-proton collision rate. Hence in the detectors there will be many events that
are not of high interest, to handle this and select/study only relevant events, a mechanism
to separate interesting and not interesting events was developed: the triggersystem. The pp
interaction rate at the design luminosity is approximately 1 GHz, while the event data record-
ing, is limited to about 200 Hz. This requires an overall rejection factor of 5  106 against
minimum-bias processes while maintaining maximum efficiency for interesting physics. The
rejection is performed by a trigger system consisting of three levels: Level-1 (L1), Level-2
(L2), and event filter.
Level-1 trigger
The L1 trigger is implemented using custom-made electronics. The L1 trigger system uses
a subset of the total detector information to make a decision on whether or not to continue
processing an event, reducing the data rate to approximately 75 kHz; this is done searching
for high transverse momentum (interesting physics processes are characterised by having
high transverse momentum final state particles) muons , electrons, photons, jets, and tau
leptons decaying to hadrons, it also selects events with large missing transverse energy and
large total transverse energy. The L1 triggering systems are:
 L1 Calorimeter trigger (L1Calo). All the calorimeters of ATLAS (electromagnetic and
hadronic; barrel, end-cap and forward). This system aims to identify high-ET objects
such electrons, photons, jets,  -leptons and missing energy.
 L1 Muon trigger (L1Muon). The L1 Muon trigger is based on signals in the muon
trigger chambers: the RPCs in the barrel and the TGCs in the end-caps. The trigger
searches for high pT muons originating in the interaction point.
 Central trigger processor (CTP). The overall decision to keep an event at Level-1 is
done by the central trigger processor that integrates the triggering information coming
CHAPTER 3. EXPERIMENT 46
from the different objects. The CTP implements a trigger menu made up of trigger
selections.
In each event, the L1 trigger also defines one or more Regions of Interest (RoIs), i.e.
the coordinates in  and , of those regions within the detector where its selection process
has identified interesting physics. This information is subsequently used by the high-level
trigger.
High-level trigger
The subsequent two levels, collectively known as the high-level trigger (HLT), are the Level-2
(L2) trigger and the event filter. They provide the reduction to a final data-taking rate of
approximately 200 Hz [38]. The L2 selection is seeded by the RoI information provided by
the L1 trigger over a dedicated data path. L2 selections use, at full granularity and precision,
all the available detector data within the RoIs. The L2 menus are designed to reduce the
trigger rate to approximately 3.5 kHz, with an event processing time of about 40 ms, aver-
aged over all events. The final stage of the event selection is carried out by the event filter,
which reduces the event rate to roughly 200 Hz. Its selections are implemented using of-
fline analysis procedures within an average event processing time of the order of four seconds.
The data acquisition (DAQ) system consists in monitoring the flux of events from the
detector to the disk storage. As stated above, the first step is the selection by the L1
trigger with a latency maximum of 25 s, the event data are buffered in memories located
within the detector-specific front-specific electronics. The information from L1 trigger is
transferred to the DAQ/HLT system utilising over 1574 readout links, having first transited
through the detector-specific readouts. The 1574 event fragments are received into readout
buffers, contained in a special readout system units where they are temporarily stored and
provided to the subsequent stages of the DAQ/HLT system. Level-2 trigger performs full
event reconstruction on restricted RoI info to make a decision, and then HLT performs full
event reconstruction to make the final decision of writing the event to disk.
Chapter 4
Level 1 Calorimeter optimisation
This chapter contains the studies regarding the optimisation of the L1 Calorimeter trigger
rates and efficiencies. These studies are in the context of the ATLAS detector functioning
and they illustrate the power of the tag and probe method, which is widely used to compute
correction efficiencies. Additionally a better insight of the ATLAS L1 Calorimeter trigger is
pictured. This work is a team effort and it is the bulk of the requirements to complete the
ATLAS collaboration service task.
4.1 Introduction
The future plans of the LHC programme are to increase the luminosity, i.e. the amount of
protons circulating the rings is planned to be risen. This poses a critical problem in the pro-
cessing of the data collected by the ATLAS detector, since having a higher luminosity means
that the number of proton-proton collisions will increase accordingly beyond the ATLAS
data storage capabilities. During previous and current LHC operations, dedicated triggers
were used to select data that potentially contain interesting physics events, henceforth adapt-
ing the data collection to realistic storage capabilities. The ATLAS triggering system has
different stages and components (see Chapter 3), the studies presented in this Chapter are
aimed to provide an optimised configuration of the L1 Calorimeter trigger hardware to cope
with the increased luminosity, the latter is done by simulating the hardware and investigate
the impact of changing its parameters on the signal efficiencies and trigger rates.
CHAPTER 4. LEVEL 1 CALORIMETER OPTIMISATION 48
4.2 Optimisation strategy
The L1Calo efficiencies and trigger rates optimisation is determined after data taking (offline
optimisation) and follows the main steps:
 Simulation of the L1Calo custom electronics.
 Calculate efficiencies for different simulated hardware configurations based on a Z  ee
sample.
 Calculate trigger rates for different simulated hardware configurations based on a sam-
ple enriched with low-pT events (LHC minimum bias events).
 Study the interplay among the efficiencies and rates and find the simulated hardware
configuration which minimises the trigger rates whilst maintaining the efficiencies high.
The subsequent sections describe in greater detail the previously mentioned steps.
4.2.1 Simulation of L1Calo
The L1Calo system is conformed of custom electronics, it is a pipelined digital system with
a dead time of 2.5 s. L1Calo is located outside the ATLAS detector cavity in the USA15
cavern. The L1Calo is fed with information coming from all the ATLAS electromagnetic and
hadronic calorimeters. In order to organise the input and ease the processing of the data,
the calorimeters are divided in the so-called trigger towers, which consist of regions of space
within the detector, described by the pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle coordinates. The
dimensions of a trigger tower depend on the region of the detector, see Table 4.1.
Position  
|| < 2.5 0.1 0.1
2.5 < || < 3.1 0.2 0.2
3.1 < || < 3.2 0.1 0.2
3.2 < || < 4.9 0.4 0.4125
Table 4.1: Trigger tower granularity for several || slices and one quadrant in  (0  90) .
The L1Calo has three main sub-systems:
 Pre-Processor(PPr): it digitises the analogue calorimeter pulses, associates the trigger
tower signals with the correct LHC bunch-crossing and converts ADC counts to energy.
CHAPTER 4. LEVEL 1 CALORIMETER OPTIMISATION 49
 Cluster Processor (CP): electron, photon and single hadron identification is done by
the CP; it uses a 0.1 0.1 granularity and operates in the || < 2.5 region.
 Jet/Energy-sum processor (JEP): this system performs the jet finding and energy sums;
its granularity corresponds to 0.20.2 where sums of the electromagnetic and hadronic
layers of L1Calo take place. The JEP operates over the whole of the ATLAS region
(|| < 4.9).
The PPr provides the energy deposited in each of the electromagnetic calorimeter trig-
ger towers to the CP and JEP processors; particle searching algorithms are used by these
processors to find features in overlapping sliding windows and the final results are sent on
cables to the CTP. Each CP consists of four crate systems and each of them contains 14
Cluster Processor Modules (CPMs) which handles one calorimeter quadrant. The CP chips
on every CPM are large Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). CPMs carry out the
e/ and  algorithms and count the multiplicity of successes, or hits, in the region covered
by each module.
The e/ algorithm searches for narrow high ET showers in the EM calorimeters. The
large rate of hadronic jets contaminates the showers in the EM calorimeters; consequently,
isolation requirements are implemented to discriminate between the electromagnetic and the
hadronic showers and to enhance the selection at L1. Moreover, showers are required to not
penetrate the hadronic calorimeter. The CP provides several sets of energy threshold and
isolation conditions and each threshold can be chosen independently.
To handle the higher occupancies in the calorimeter system, result of the increased pileup,
the ouput data format has been extended from simple hit counts to more descriptive Trigger
Objects (TOBs) which include also the topological trigger: ,  and ET of the candidate
electron, the former is shown in Figure 4.1. A TOB specifies a RoI along with its associated
transverse energy and likelihood to be related with a particle produced in a collision.
The offline code1 simulates the hardware in two steps: first the trigger towers and then the
TOBs are simulated. This procedure allows to reprocess the trigger towers varying the noise
cuts; likewise the reprocessing of TOBs, changing the isolation cuts on CPMs, is available.
Details of the trigger simulation are:
 Access the database: the initialisation uses COOL-derived values (Condition Objects
for LHC, COOL, is the ATLAS-wide conditions database found in the computing grid).
 Retrieve the database containers and cancel the dead time or disabled channels.

Andres Ramirez-Morales.
CHAPTER 4. LEVEL 1 CALORIMETER OPTIMISATION 50
Figure 4.1: Elements used for the e/ and  algorithms in CPMs. Consider the 2 2 trigger
tower region at the centre of the 4  4 trigger tower window: in the EM calorimeter ET
values are summed for the towers in each of the four possible 1  2 and 2  1 pairs within
the region, in order to find relatively narrow showers and the sum of the inner 2 2 region
must be a local maximum compared to its eight overlapping nearest neighbours.
 Get input trigger towers from the input collection and copy ADC digits into a digit
vector for reprocessing with a suitable granularity for the different || regions listed in
Table 4.1.
 Emulate finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter, bunch crossing identification and look up
tables (LUT), and create/fill reprocessed trigger towers.
The FIR filter is needed since the width of the pulses contains several bunch crossings,
thereupon it is extremely important to associate the correct LHC bunch-crossing to the
trigger towers signals. This is carried out passing the pulses through different filters which
multiply five consecutive samples by pre-defined coefficients and sum the resulting values.
The coefficients are optimised for the pulse shape of each type of calorimeter. Afterwards,
a peak finder algorithm is implemented which compares the sum with the values from the
previous and following bunch-crossings, looking for a maximum. When a peak is found, the
CHAPTER 4. LEVEL 1 CALORIMETER OPTIMISATION 51
LUT is used to convert the output of the FIR filtering into transverse energy.
There is a linear relation between the peaks and the signal energy; the LUT provides the
calibration curve established by a slope and an offset where the pedestal effect is subtracted
and the noise threshold is applied. Hence simulating the LUT permits changes in the noise
cuts for both the cluster and jet energy processors, aiming to analyse the impact of the
different configurations on the final efficiency and rates. Finally, the reprocessed triggers are
stored in the Trigger Elements (TEs), which represent a trigger-relevant object in the event.
The TOBs simulation requires three further steps: get trigger towers from TEs, form
CPMTowers from triggers towers and store the CPMTowers in the TEs. The CPMTowers
are filled with user-supplied vectors of trigger towers adding their transverse energy and
angular parameters. With this information the CPMs are able to perform the e/ and 
algorithms.
4.2.2 L1Calo efficiencies
The studies presented in this section are determined with 2016 data recorded by the ATLAS
detector during proton-proton collisions when the LHC circulated 6.5 TeV centre of mass
energy proton beams. The data examined for the efficiencies corresponds to 1 pb1. The
data sample derivation (see Chapter 5) used for these studies should be appropriate to ex-
amine the characteristics of the L1Calo, namely the L1CALO1 derived samples contain all
the required information to perform the present studies.
The physics efficiencies are evaluated via a Z  ee tag and probe analysis on data,
i.e. one electron is tagged with tight identification selections, the di-electron invariant mass
is required to be consistent with the Z boson mass and a loose selection is applied to the
second electron, the latter is referred to as probe electron and it is the one used for efficiency
studies. More precisely, the selection is as follows.2
Event level cuts:
 The event must be included in the 2016 ATLAS data quality good runs list.
 The event is required to contain at least one primary vertex.
 The event must pass through standard calorimeter cleaning at the calibration stage.
 The di-electron invariant mass must be in the range of 66 GeV and 116 GeV.
2The selection criteria described here are individually described in Chapter 7, the reader is referred to
this Chapter for greater details on each criterion.

to be triggered by the electron in the event.
 The electron must posses a transverse momentum greater than 27 GeV.
 The electron must be found in the detector region of || < 2.47, whilst electronsq in the
crack region, between the barrel and the end-caps of the electromagnetic calorimeters,
1.37 < || < 1.52 are excluded.
 The electron identification is performed applying the Loose Likelihood (LLH) criteria
and requiring a tight selection.
 The isolation requirements are applied depending on the trigger efficiency that it is
being studied.
 The selected electron is required to be matched with the trigger.
Probe electron cuts:
 The electron must have a transverse momentum greater than 7 GeV.
 The electron must be found in the detector region of || < 2.47, whilst electrons in the
crack region, between the barrel and the end-caps of the electromagnetic calorimeters,
1.37 < || < 1.52 are excluded.
 Loose electron isolation is required.
The previous event and object level cuts combined assure a very good purity for the Z
boson sample. To check the validity of the selection criteria, the control plots of Fig. 4.2-4.4
were produced and examined; it is seen that the distributions conform well to expectation,
suggesting that the purity is sufficient in the selected Z  ee sample to be used for trigger
efficiency studies.
Trigger efficiency calculation
The efficiencies are calculated using the tag and probe method: given the reconstructed
tag electron, the reconstruction efficiency of the probe electron, after the application of a
specific selection, is determined in the Z  ee sample described above. The trigger selection
efficiency is to be measured using probe electrons matched to a L1 TOB. The efficiency
calculation requires the following selection criteria of the probe electron and the TOB:

 The TOB must be reconstructed in a suitable RoI of dimension   = 0.4 0.4.

electromagnetic calorimeter.

where EM refers to the EM calorimeter, the number following EM indicates the min-
imum transverse energy requirement in GeV. Next, the letters refer to different types
and levels of isolation: I stands for the EM ring isolation applied, where the EM
energy is within an isolation ring surrounding the core 2 2 trigger towers; H refers
to the hadronic core isolation energy threshold applied (which is ET -dependent, no
isolation for L1 ET > 50 GeV); V refers to -dependent trigger energy threshold
applied which follows the variation in  of the energy response.
CHAPTER 4. LEVEL 1 CALORIMETER OPTIMISATION 55
The electron efficiencies  are the ratio between the number of probe electrons associated
to a TOB passing the above mentioned criteria and the total number of probe electrons,
Ne(Trigger Selection and R)
Ne(All probe electrons)
. (4.2)
Total and differential (in probe electron peT and 
e bins) efficiencies are calculated.
4.2.3 Trigger rates
Conversely to physics interesting data used to calculate efficiencies, studying the trigger sys-
tems requires the use of a sample that represents as much as possible the LHC collisions, i.e.
the majority of events coming from pp collisions at LHC consist of low pT events (minimum
bias events), trigger rate estimations are better calculated with enhanced minimum bias
events.
For the present studies, the enhanced events are selected demanding each TOB to be
reconstructed within a suitable RoI of the detector by requiring to be located in the first
layer of the EM calorimeter. The trigger threshold list is analysed and if at least one TOB of
the event passes a given threshold, the event is considered triggered by that trigger label (the
trigger thresholds labels used are: EM15, EM15HI, EM20VHI, EM22VHI and EM24VHI).
A definition of the effective trigger rate is determined as the number of events triggered by a
specific trigger over the total number of events in the sample fulfilling a simple RoI selection.
Events from the enhanced bias sample are reweighted using specific enhanced bias weights
factorising away the enhanced selection and correcting the effective rates to what is expected
in regular data.
4.3 Simulation bias
The simulation procedure3 described in Section 4.2.1 needs to be compared with the origi-
nal online chain, an offline analysis is devoted for this which compares the default objects
and quantities with the reprocessed ones. These tests are important to validate the offline
simulation methodology. Nevertheless the studies of the parameter optimisation are done
comparing exclusively the reprocessed objects and quantities, therefore the results presented
in next sections are not affected by the biases found in this section.
With the aim of spotting possible bias of the hardware response versus the offline hard-
ware simulation, several tests were performed; starting from the reprocessing that creates
3The main two steps are the creation of trigger towers followed by the simulation of the processors
CHAPTER 4. LEVEL 1 CALORIMETER OPTIMISATION 56
the reprocessed trigger towers, and then input of the original trigger towers to the modified
processors to test the second reprocessing step; finally, the full two-step procedure is checked
comparing the original TOBs with the ones generated by both the reprocessing steps. Here,
only the final checks are presented, which show the rates and efficiencies comparison calcu-
lated with both the reprocessed and the default TOBs. The efficiency plots in Figure 4.5-4.6
are shown differentially in peT and 
e bins, satisfying Equation (6.3). The rates described in
Section 4.2.3 are displayed in Figure 4.7.
The difference between the hardware response and the hardware simulation is negligible.
This agrees with the previous checks (not shown here) of the different stages of the simulation
procedure. Two central bins in the electron pseudorapidity efficiency are the most affected
by the simulation bias, this is work in progress.
4.4 Results
The aim of the studies shown in this Chapter is to find optimal noise cut values to improve
(lower) the trigger rates while maintaining the reconstruction efficiency high.
The efficiencies were evaluated using different noise cuts and trigger thresholds. In the
same manner, trigger rates were computed. An ansatz of the noise cut range to be investi-
gated, is set around the default value 4.0k, i.e. from 2.0k to 8.0k in 2.0k steps, this is called
the wide range.
Efficiencies corresponding to the first ansatz are shown differentially in probe electron
transverse momentum bins in Figure 4.8, a separate plot corresponds to each of the various
trigger thresholds. Reducing the value of the noise cut leads to higher LUT values in the iso-
lation ring, whilst increasing the noise cut values leads to higher LUT values in the isolation
ring. Hence a slight effect on the efficiency it is seen in the EM15 trigger selection as there
is no isolation requirement. Nevertheless in all the trigger thresholds, the turn-on region in
the isolation curve, exhibits a discrepancy in the efficiency values for different noise cuts.
To study the efficiencies as a function of the probe electron pseudorapidity, only electrons
passing a peT cut, which depends on each trigger threshold, were considered in the numerator
of Equation (6.3), removing the turn-on region in the transverse momentum efficiency curves.
Namely, the peT cuts for the listed trigger thresholds are:
 EM15, pT >20 GeV;
 EM15HI, pT >20 GeV;

 EM20HI, pT >25 GeV;

These efficiencies are displayed in Figure 4.9. Similarly to the peT binned efficiencies,
the EM15 noise cuts have a negligible effect on the efficiency, furthermore the changes of
efficiencies are significant when looking trigger thresholds which include isolation cuts.
The efficiency calculations are condensed in Table 4.2. Here the total efficiencies are
integrated over the peT and 
e variables; the values are obtained applying the above electron
transverse momentum cuts. It is the main interest to explore the variation of the different
cuts w.r.t. the default noise cut (4.0k), defined as,
eff =
testeff  defaulteff
defaulteff
, (4.3)
where defaulteff is the trigger efficiency calculated for the default noise cut, while testeff is
the efficiency of the alternative noise cut being considered in the test. The aim is to obtain
the highest possible efficiency, consequently a positive eff is pursued. The eff values are
presented in Table 4.3.
In the same manner the rates are summarised in Table 4.4 and a rate variation is defined
rate =
defaultrate  testrate
defaultrate
, (4.4)
where defaultrate is the effective trigger rate calculated for the default 4.0k noise cut, while
testrate is the rate of the alternative noise cut considered in the test. The aim is to obtain the
lowest possible rates, consequently a positive eff is pursued. The rate values are presented
in Table 4.4.

Table 4.4: Effective trigger rates as a function of the wide range of noise cut values. The
values are given in percentage.
Examining the efficiency and rate variations displayed in Tables 4.3 and 4.4, it is con-
cluded that the 2.0k noise cut corresponds to a loss in efficiency of more that 1%. Anal-
ogously the 8.0k noise cut, in spite of the fact that the efficiency is raised, the increase of
the trigger rates is not negligible. Hence, the first proposed noise cut range is narrowed
around the default noise cut of 4.0k: the study is repeated in the range from 3.0k to 5.0k, in
0.5k steps. Figure 4.10 displays the efficiencies in this new range as a function of the probe
electron transverse momentum for the different trigger thresholds and noise cuts. Equiva-
lently, Figure 4.11 shows the efficiency as a function of the probe electron pseudorapidity; in
the numerator of Equation (6.3) only probe electrons passing the above-mentioned peT cuts,
which depend on each trigger threshold, are taken into account. In addition, the rates plots
are found in Figure 4.12.
To be more quantitatively, the total efficiencies and their variations w.r.t. the default
value in the narrower noise cut range, are compiled in Tables 4.5 and 4.8. The corresponding
rates results are contained in Tables 4.7 and 4.8.
Considering the efficiency and rate variations, it is suggested that the 3.5k noise cut
corresponds to a minimal loss of efficiency (< 1%), while reducing the rates of an interesting
percentage. This is the main result of these studies.

4.5 Additional checks
The matching of the probe electrons and the TOBs are of fundamental importance for the
efficiency and rates calculations. The angular association between trigger objects (defined at
L1) and the probe electrons (reconstructed by the HLT) is performed using Equation (4.1).
The first step is to check that the matching procedure outlined in Section 4.2.2 ensures to

find only one TOB per each probe electron, this is well satisfied as shown in Figure 4.13.
Moreover the  distributions between the selected probe electron and the corresponding
TOB are checked. The distributions are shown in Figure 4.14 and are as follows:
 Top-left plot shows the  distribution in the full e spectrum for the different trigger
thresholds of interest and a fixed noise equal to 4.0k.

pidity bin (0.0  |e|  0.5).
 Bottom-left plot shows the  distribution for one trigger threshold and the narrow
range of noise cuts.
 Bottom-right plot displays the  distribution of five e bins with a fixed noise cut
equal to 4.0k.
These sanity checks show that the TOB-probe electron association works in an appropri-
ate manner and there are no anomalies in the angular matching between them.

Data and Monte Carlo samples
This chapter comprises the information regarding the data collected by the ATLAS detector
and the Monte Carlo simulation samples used for the W   analysis.
5.1 Data
The data set used in this analysis is constituted by the collection made with the ATLAS
detector during the year 2017; in this period the LHC circulated proton beams with an
energy of 6.5 TeV and bunch spacing of 25 ns, the data correspond to head-on proton-proton
collisions. For the present analysis only data taken during stable beam conditions and when
the ATLAS detector was fully operational are considered. The latter is established within the
good run lists, provided by the ATLAS data quality group1, which in overall sums a total
integrated luminosity of 44.3 fb1. The years, when the data were collected, are divided
by periods to maintain stable beam conditions, good detector performance and sufficient
amount of data collected; a break down of the year is shown in Table 5.1.
Due to the fact that detector and beam conditions changed throughout data taking years,
e.g. the average pp interactions, the need of using different triggers arose with the intent to
optimise the data taking. For muons, the change of triggers between years is not significant;
conversely, for electrons various triggers changed (in this document electrons play a minor
role, for more detailed treatment see reference [39], for example). Table 5.2 displays the
muon triggers designated for 2015, 2016 and 2017; in the case of having more than one
trigger, the event is recorded if any of the triggers is triggered.
The data were handled using the ATLAS reconstruction software Athena2 release 21.2[41].

It was found convenient to adopt the centrally produced STDM4 derivations [42] in this anal-
ysis given the signature of the W   process and the chosen phase space, see Chapter 7.
The STDM4 filter cuts are simple: the event must have one or more leptons; muons and
electrons are required to have a transverse momentum greater than 15 GeV and 20 GeV,
respectively; furthermore, a || < 2.6 cut is imposed on them; finally, they are required to
pass single lepton triggers, explained in detail in Section 7.1.5, see Table 5.2.

CHAPTER 5. DATA AND MONTE CARLO SAMPLES 72
5.2 Monte Carlo simulations
To be able to compare what it is observed in the experiment with the theory predictions,
it is necessary to have simulations that combine both the physics processes that appear
in proton-proton collisions and the manner in which the ATLAS detector responds to the
particles, result of the pp collisions, passing through its different components. To achieve
this task, dedicated Monte Carlo simulations exist. The first step is to carefully simulate
each component of the ATLAS detector. The second step is to produce samples that de-
scribe the physics involved; this corresponds to the W   process referred to as signal,
the background processes that potentially could pass the signal selection cuts imposed and
contaminate the signal3, the effect of the multiple pp collisions that occur at the same time
as the signal process, which are not of physics interest (pileup), and finally the secondary
interactions between the remaining partons not participating in the main hard interaction:
the so-called underlying event. When these steps are combined, a description of W  
events inside the ATLAS detector is available.
5.2.1 Monte Carlo event generators
Monte Carlo simulations are needed as a consequence of the complexity of the ATLAS
detector and the physics processes themselves, i.e. it is not feasible to couple every single
response of each ATLAS detector component with all the physics processes involved in pp
collisions utilising direct fundamental theory calculations. A Monte Carlo simulation resolves
the latter by means of event-level simulations, which are based on random number generation
and assumes that the system is described by probability density functions (coming from data,
theory predictions or fitted data to theory predictions), to yield the event rate behaviour
differentially in several kinematic variables. This step is repeated to build a Monte Carlo
sample statistically significant.
Event generator sub-processes
The pp collisions event generation in ATLAS consists of several sub-processes4:
 Perturbative calculation at fixed order of the hard process matrix element using a
defined PDF set.
3The background contamination emerges since the ATLAS detector records all physics processes and it
is possible that some of them mimic the W   signal.
4It is assumed a negligible interference between the sub-processes in a event and therefore it can be
factorised.

 Non-perturbative low energy (1 GeV) calculations of the parton showers associated
with the incoming and outgoing coloured participants in the subprocess.
 Computation of the underlying event using perturbative and non-perturbative tech-
niques; this results in parton showers, in which case the parton showers are hard

hadrons5.

 Radiation can be simulated either as part of the matrix element or as part of a par-

count radiation from both approaches; every MC generator performs this in a different
manner.

For this analysis, the generators used are:
 Powheg. Next-to-leading-order calculations for the highest pT objects are done with
exact NLO matrix elements, when Powheg is interfaced with shower algorithms that
use pT ordering for the summation of next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL) corrections,
the desired accuracy is achieved [4345].
 Pythia. This program has the capability to generate all classes of processes in high-
energy collisions typically at leading-order matrix element: hard processes, parton
showers, parton interactions, beam remnants, string fragmentation and particle decays
[46]. For this analysis, Pythia is used to simulate parton showering.
 Photos. QED radiative and Bremsstrahlung corrections to decays of particles or reso-
nances can be calculated using Photos [47].
5Hadronisation is the process behind the production of observable final state hadrons, result from a hard
collision of quarks or gluons; the hadronisation is a consequence of colour confinement, i.e., quarks and gluons
are not found in free states, thus energy from the vacuum is taken to create the corresponding antiparticles
to form hadronic bound states.

The symbols q, g, l,  correspond respectively to quarks, gluons, leptons and neutrinos of any
flavour and colour (where applicable); b stands for any colour b-quark.
5.2.2 Monte Carlo samples for the W   analysis
The charged current Drell-Yan process W   is simulated using the Powheg program
which employs the CT10 [48] parton distribution functions set interfaced with Pythia 8.2 to
include hadronisation effects, parton shower and underlying event with the AZNLO CTEQL1
tune [49]. Photos[47] is utilised to simulate the radiation of photons after the collision,
called final state radiation (FSR). The backgrounds considered are also simulated employing
Powheg and Pythia, these background processes are: W   where the tau decays into a
muon, Z   where one of the muons is not properly reconstructed or identified, Z  
where the tau decays into a muon and the second lepton is not reconstructed or identified, or

the second tau decays hadronically, tt and single top quark where the decay chain6 involves
a W boson decaying to a neutrino and muon, and a b quark that could fake a muon, and
diboson production (WW,ZZ,WZ) that could have similar signature to a single W boson.
Figure 5.1 displays the Feynman graphs of some of these processes. As for data, the handling
of the simulated physics was done using Athena release 21.2 and STDM4 derivations were
used.
The detector and beam conditions changed significantly between the years 2015/2016
and 2017, accordingly, two different Monte Carlo production campaigns were carried out
to simulate these different conditions separately: the campaign a simulations are used to
compare the simulation with data taken during 2015 and 2016; the campaign d simulations
are used to compare the simulation with data taken during 2017. Both campaigns are inde-
pendent of each other. The campaign a and data 2015+2016 were used for early comparisons
with 2015/2016 data, and are not further used in this analysis. The physics simulations are
combined with the ATLAS detector simulation based on the GEANT4 program [50] in order
to directly compare the data with the prediction.
6The top quark mass is the largest of the SM particles, therefore it is extremely short lived to be detected;
the top quark decays via the weak interaction producing a W boson and a quark; subsequently the quark
goes through hadronisation and the W boson decays leptonically or hadronically, the latter are the final
states observed in the detector.
CHAPTER 5. DATA AND MONTE CARLO SAMPLES 76
To obtain better statistical precision and modelling in the tails of the invariant mass
and transverse mass spectra (for the definition of transverse mass, see Section 7.1.10), high
boson invariant mass slices were considered for the W and Z bosons, resulting in smooth
invariant mass and transverse mass distributions at high off-shell invariant mass (mW/Z >
1 TeV). The normalisation applied to each slice (and the inclusive samples) considers the
cross section found in AMI [51] and includes the so-called K factor, kFactor, (the definition of
the kFactor is given in Equation (5.1)) which corrects the cross section to the next-to-next-
to-leading-order for QCD effects and next-to-leading-order for electroweak effects; the above
mentioned kFactor is a function of the boson invariant mass for the single W and Z boson
production; on the other hand the kFactor is applied as a fixed value to the diboson and
top processes. Figure 5.2 shows the invariant mass and transverse at generator level, i.e.
without considering detector effects, before selection cuts are applied. Tables 5.3-5.7 list the
samples used and present the relevant information to correctly normalise the Monte Carlo
simulations to data, see Chapter 10.
5.3 High order perturbation theory corrections
The Monte Carlo generators produce physics simulations only at second order of perturbation
theory (NLO), see Chapter 6. To accurately model what it is found in the experiment,
corrections at higher order are introduced: for processes related with the quark and gluons
interactions (QCD), characterised by gs, corrections are obtained at next-to-next-to-leading-
order; whereas, for electroweak processes between leptons and quarks, characterised by EW ,
the corrections are calculated at NLO. These corrections are included in the distributions
and cross sections by defining an event weight as,
kFactor(m) = kQCD  kEW , (5.1)
where kQCD, contains the QCD correction and is defined as the ratio between the NNLO
to NLO or LO cross section; kEWK contains the electroweak corrections, i.e. leading-order
electroweak corrections matched with next-to-leading-order corrections. The kFactor varies
as function of the invariant mass for W and Z bosons and for the remaining backgrounds it
is a constant. An average of the kFactor weights is presented in Figure 5.3. It is interesting
to observe the behaviour of kFactor as function of the transverse mass, given that is expected
to be a variation in function of the event transverse mass m, since in principle the boson
invariant mass is closely related with mT , see Section 7.1.10, the variation follows the same
response with respect to the invariant mass up to 1 GeV; at higher masses the response

Event reconstruction
The event reconstruction must take into account all the objects involved in the W  
production through pp collisions: muons, electrons, jets, missing energy, pileup interactions
and underlying event. Several algorithms are used to reconstruct and identify these objects in
both data and Monte Carlo simulations; furthermore, corrections to Monte Carlo simulations
are applied following the recommendations from the ATLAS combined performance groups.
This chapter treats the event reconstruction with emphasis on the muon and missing energy,
the most relevant objects for the charged current Drell-Yan process in the muon channel.
6.1 Muons
6.1.1 Muon identification
The Lorentz force1, ~F = q~v  ~B, serves to relate the curvature that a particle of charge
q describes (travelling at velocity ~v), under the influence of a magnetic field ~B, with its
momentum; this is obtained through matching the Lorentz force against the centripetal
force, ~F = mv2r/r, result of the particles, of mass m, motion in a curve parametrized by r
which direction, r, is towards the centre of the curve. This matching is used in both Inner
Detector and Muon Spectrometer subdetector systems to reconstruct the muon momentum,
since muons are expected to traverse both the ID and the MS (the ATLAS outer subdetector).
Specifically, for the case of a constant magnetic field,
qB = mvr = pT sin r, (6.1)
1For practical purposes, the electric field is considered to be equal to zero and thus it does not contribute
to the Lorentz force.
CHAPTER 6. EVENT RECONSTRUCTION 83
Figure 6.1: Diagram of the curvature made by the particle in the presence of a magnetic
field. The reference frame is the same as defined in Section 3.2.1, i.e., the magnetic field ~B
is pointing inside the page which corresponds to the direction of the beam pipe.  and r are
parameters that define the curve followed by the muon. s is the arcs sagitta defined by the
 and r. Finally, L is the distance between the points that define the arc.
where pT is the particles transverse momentum and  is the angle that characterizes the
curved trajectory; it is convenient to use the sagitta, s, of the trajectorys arc, instead of r
and  to measure the particle transverse momentum. From Figure 6.1 a relation between
the sagitta and r and  is obtained, s = r(1 cos ); moreover, for large r and small , it is
found that,
, (6.2)
where L is the distance in between the points which define the trajectorys arc and B is the
magnetic field magnitude. Equation (6.2) is used by ATLAS to determine the muons mo-
mentum. The difference among the muon and electron trajectories resides on their different
masses, in Equation (6.1) the transverse momentum dependence on the mass is established.
To achieve good muon momentum measurement, individual information from the IP,
ID and MS detectors is employed, see Chapter 3. Four muon definitions are used in the
reconstruction: A combined (CB) muon track reconstruction is done via a global fit that
uses hits from ID and MS. Extrapolated (ME) muons are defined when the trajectory is
reconstructed based only on the MS track and it is related with the IP; ME muons extend
the acceptance to 2.5 < || < 2.7. Segment-tagged (ST) muons are the tracks in the ID that,
when extrapolated to the MS, are associated with at least one local track segment in the
CHAPTER 6. EVENT RECONSTRUCTION 84
MDT or CSC chambers. Calorimeter-tagged (CT) muons are the ID tracks, when matched
to an energy deposit in the calorimeter, are compatible with a minimum-ionising particle2;
they recover acceptance in the region where the MS cabling is found, and the CT muons are
optimised for || < 0.1 and 15 < pT < 100 GeV. In the case of a muon falling in more than
one definition, preference is given to CB, then to ST and finally to CT definition. A good
muon momentum measurement in the ID requires at least one pixel hit and five SCT hits,
fewer than three pixel or SCT holes3, and at least 10% of the TRT hits originally assigned
to the track must be included in the final fit [53].
The medium identification criteria for muons are considered in this analysis. Only CB
and ME tracks are used. The former are required to have  3 hits in a minimum of two
MDT layers, except for tracks in the || < 0.1 region, where tracks with at least one MDT
layer but no more than one MDT hole layer are allowed. The latter are required to have at
least three MDT/CSC layers, and are employed only in the 2.5 < || < 2.7 region to extend
the acceptance outside the ID coverage. A loose selection on the compatibility between ID
and MS momentum measurements is applied to suppress the contamination due to hadrons
misidentified as muons. Specifically, the q/p significance (the absolute value of the difference
between the ratio of the charge and momentum of the muons in the ID and MS divided by
the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties) is required to be less than seven [53].
6.1.2 Muon performance
Tag and probe method
A widely used methodology to calculate efficiencies in ATLAS is the tag and a probe method.
The method consists in considering a Standard Model process, e.g. Z  , of which the
properties and correlations of its decay products are well-known, then take one lepton as
the tag to study the other probe lepton. The tag lepton is required to pass stringent
selection cuts, while for the probe lepton a particular cut is dropped to quantify the effect,
a diagram is found in Figure 6.2.
Efficiencies obtained with this methodology are computed for data and Monte Carlo,
subsequently these efficiencies are employed to calculate efficiency scale factors and apply
them to the MC in order to accommodate the data mismodelling. A general efficiency scale
factor, SF , reads as
data
, (6.3)
2Relativistic charged particles passing through matter, lose energy by ionisation and atomic excitation,
this is described by the Bethe-Bloch equation; minimum-ionising particles are relativistic particles which
have mean energy loss rates close to the minimum set by the Bloch-Bethe equation [4].
3A hole is defined as an active sensor traversed by the track but containing no hits.
CHAPTER 6. EVENT RECONSTRUCTION 85
probe
Figure 6.2: Tag and probe method diagram. In the diagram a Z boson is produced by any
mechanism, and the decay products are restricted to be one muon and its antiparticle. In
Section 4.2.2 a detailed description of the method is given using electrons; the same remarks
apply for muons: one muon is tagged (tag muon, here in the diagram referred to as tag) with
tight identification selections, the di-muon system invariant mass is required to be consistent
with the Z boson invariant mass, finally a loose selection is applied to the second muon
(probe muon, here in the diagram referred to as probe). Then the probe muons are used to
calculate the efficiency of a specific selection criterion.
where data and MC are the efficiencies for data and MC respectively. This quantity corrects
for the difference between simulation and data and is applied as weight to every Monte Carlo
event.
Identification efficiency
The efficiency originated from the medium muon identification selection is provided by the
ATLAS Muon Combined Performance group (MCP), it is based on a tag and probe tech-
nique that uses Z   and J/   data samples coming from 13 TeV pp collisions
recorded in 2015 and 2016. The tag muons follow the medium criteria and the probe muons
satisfy the CT requirements. Figure 6.3 displays the identification efficiency corresponding
to medium muons; the plot displays the data and MC efficiencies from which the efficiency
scale factors are calculated using Equation (6.3). For the charged current Drell-Yan selection
(see Chapter 7) these scale factors were considered, Figure 6.4 shows the average identifica-
tion efficiency scale factors as a function of muon pT , muon , and transverse mass defined
in Section 7.1.10. From the plots it is concluded that the muon identification efficiency scale
factors do not depend on the muon pT and the dependence on the muon  is small. The
behaviour is consistent with the results shown in Figure 6.3. The scale factors are applied

selections differ significantly. The error bars on the efficiencies indicate the statistical uncer-
tainty. The panel at the bottom shows the ratio of the measured to predicted efficiencies, this
ratio corresponds to the efficiency scale factor, with statistical and systematic uncertainties

event by event to the signal and electroweak background Monte Carlo simulations, and are
close to 99%.
Muon momentum scale and resolution
It is desired to have a muon momentum scale accurate to the per mille level and a muon
momentum resolution accurate to the percent level. Data and simulation comparisons are
performed with the aid of Z   and J/   samples to carry out the required
corrections. A muon momentum calibration is performed using only CB muons that use the
pT reconstructed in the ID and the MS detectors, the calibration is performed separately for
each detector and is divided in two components [53]:
 Muon momentum scale corrections. These corrections aim to correct for the inaccu-
racy in the description of the magnetic field integral and the dimension of the detector

modate the imperfect description by the simulation of the energy loss in the calorimeter

loss in the ID, no correction is done.
 Muon momentum resolution smearing. This accounts for energy loss fluctuations in the
traversed material. Moreover, multiple scattering, local magnetic field inhomogeneities
and displacements of the hits are considered. Finally, resolution effects, emerging from
the spatial resolution of the hit measurements and by residual misalignment of the
CHAPTER 6. EVENT RECONSTRUCTION 88
muon spectrometer, are included in these calibrations.
Muon sagitta corrections
Due to imperfect alignment and deformations, the ID and MS detectors exhibit movements
orthogonal to the track trajectory, leading to antisymmetric modifications of the track curva-
ture between positively and negatively charged particles, these are referred as sagitta biases.
The sagitta biases corrections can be obtained by comparing the transverse momentum of
opposite charged muons in a Z   sample. A complementary determination of the sagitta
biases is carried out by studying the E/p ratio for the electrons in Z  ee observed4 in the
ID detector and determine the difference with respect to the analogous quantity in the elec-
tromagnetic calorimeter where these biases, are in principle absent. Moreover, the muon 
distributions in Chapter 10 display a difference in shapes for the W+ and W channels, as
a consequence it is needed that the sagitta biasses corrections to be derived differentially in

tion (6.2), sagitta() is the sagitta bias as function of muon ; a correction that takes into
account the radial biases is contained in () and also depends on the muon . These
corrections are performed by the MCP group [53].
6.2 Electrons
Similar to muons, electrons are reconstructed taking into account the curved tracks that they
leave. Nevertheless, electrons do not traverse beyond the electromagnetic calorimeter, there-
fore the tracking reconstruction information originates exclusively from the inner detector.
To complement the electron momentum measurement and identification, the electromag-
netic calorimeter retrieves the energy coming from the photons produced by the electrons,
via Bremsstrahlung radiation, when interacting with the calorimeter material; the energy of
these photons is a function of the electron mass (or any other particle mass) and goes as
m2e . The identification takes into account the shape of the cluster of energy in the calorime-
ter, the track characteristics in the ID and the matching between them. The loose electron
4The Z boson decay modes into two charged leptons are widely used to obtain efficiencies and calibrations,
owing the fact that their signature is relatively simple to distinguish; furthermore these processes have been
thoroughly characterised at the LHC and previous particle colliders.
CHAPTER 6. EVENT RECONSTRUCTION 89
identification criteria is considered [55]. Electrons must at least have a pT > 7 GeV and to
be found in a pseudorapidity range of || < 2.47, excluding barrel-endcap transition region
(1.37 < || < 1.52). Furthermore, electrons must be isolated from other tracks and energy
deposits to reduce the multijet background.
6.3 Jets
Jets are objects that are composed by a group of particles encapsulated in a small cone;
these particles are the result of the hadronisation and fragmentation of coloured particles
(quarks and gluons coming from a pp collision) due to colour confinement, it follows the
creation of a large number of hadrons travelling approximately in the same direction. The
anti-kt algorithm [56], with radius parameter R=0.4, is used to reconstruct and identify
jets. The jet calibration is based on electromagnetic detector topologies where is required
pT > 20 GeV and || < 2.4 cuts. Then the jet vertex algorithm (JVT) [57] cuts are included
in the selection to mitigate pileup effects; the JVT efficiency weight is displayed in Figure 6.5,
it is seen that this effect is less than 1%. Lastly an overlap removal is applied, consisting of
removing electrons that share a track with a muon; remove single jets closest to an electron,
within a R < 0.2; remove electrons with R < 0.4 of the jet; and remove muons within
R < 0.4 of any jet.
6.4 Missing energy
One important characteristic of the charged current Drell-Yan process, is the fact that the
neutrino is not observable by the ATLAS detector. In order to be able to study W events of
this kind, is necessary to indirectly determine the neutrino kinematics. The typical way of
doing this, is to start with the assumption that in a proton-proton collision, the transverse
momentum (perpendicular to the beam axis) is conserved, i.e. before the collision the trans-
verse momentum is zero and therefore must be zero after the collision5. Then it is possible
to obtain the transverse energy of the neutrino, by summing all the high pT particles in the
final state plus soft tracks (low pT ) not associated with the former particles; any missing
energy is attributed to the neutrino energy for the W   process, more precisely is the
absolute value of the negative vector sum of these objects, and is constructed as follows.
5The same remarks apply for e+e colliders since this kind of collisions also produce invisible particles
and the usage of transverse momentum variables represents identical advantages [58].

where px and py are the momentum components on the transverse plane perpendicular to
the beam axis. The first term on the right hand side of Equation (6.5) includes the so-called
hard objects: electrons, photons, hadronically decaying  -leptons, muons and jets; the sum
is done following that order since it is aimed to avoid double counting of potential shared
tracks. The inclusion of electrons and muons in the missing energy calculation is defined by
the specific analysis requirements. For photons,  -leptons and jets in addition to the analysis
requirements a further inclusion/rejection could take place due to the resolution ambiguity
CHAPTER 6. EVENT RECONSTRUCTION 91
between tracks.
The second term of Equation (6.5) represents the tracks which are associated with the
hard vertex but not with the selected hard objects, they include signals or signal traces from
scattered soft particles arising from the underlying event accompanying the hard-scatter
interaction, or from statistically completely independent pileup interactions. In addition,
the soft term could include tracks from particles and jets which do not satisfy the hard-
object quality criteria, or are below the kinematic threshold. For the inclusion/rejection in
the missing energy calculation, the soft tracks are assigned the lowest priority in the sum,
i.e., in case of sharing a track with any other object, these are not taken into account. The
missing energy being computed with this track soft terms (TST) methodology is referred as
the TST missing energy.
The missing energy vector is
EmissT = (E
x , E
y ), (6.6)
with its magnitude given by,
EmissT = |EmissT | =
(Emissx )
2 + (Emissy )
2, (6.7)
and direction in the transverse plane,
T = tan1(Emissy /E
x ). (6.8)
Equations (6.6)-(6.8) define the missing energy (neutrino for the charged current DY process)
transverse momentum vector.
For the particular case of this analysis, the requirements are simple. The electrons
included in the EmissT calculation satisfy the Tight likelihood [59] criteria without isolation
requirements and a transverse momentum cut of pT > 20 GeV. Taus and photons are not
considered. Muons follow the cuts of the W   selection defined in Chapter 7.
ID tracks from the hard-scatter collision vertex are used to construct the soft-event signal
requiring pT > 400 MeV, || < 2.5, number of pixel hits> 0, number of SCT hits> 5. Finally,
with respect to the primary vertex, the tracks must satisfy |z0 sin | < 1.5 mm and |d0| < 1.5
mm (definitions of z0 sin  and d0 are presented in Section 7.1.3).
CHAPTER 6. EVENT RECONSTRUCTION 92
6.5 Multiple pp interactions: pileup
The multiple pp interactions or pileup, see Section 3.1, are included in the event simulation,
and influences the analysis:
 Through the computation of the EmissT , in which pileup jets distort the EmissT distribu-
tion.
 By applying a pileup weight to match6 the average number of interactions seen in data
to the campaign a simulations and to match the actual number of interactions seen
in data to the campaign d simulations. To appreciate the difference among the two
different approaches, see Figure 6.6 which shows both campaigns event pileup weights;
from this plot it is concluded that considering the actual pileup distribution, leads to an
improvement of statistics ( 20%), as a consequence of less pileup weight values being
equal to zero with respect to the case that considers the average pileup. Unfortunately,
the use of the actual pileup distribution is only available for campaign d simulation
samples. The definition of the pileup weight is documented in Reference [60] which
states that the pileup weight is,
wpileup =
LAi/L
NAi/N
, (6.9)
where LAi is the integrated luminosity of all data in the runs assigned to A (A is a given
set of detector conditions) in a pileup bin i, LAi is the quantity that considers either
the average pileup or actual pileup distributions; L is the total integrated luminosity
of the data, N is the sum of generator-weights of the whole MC sample, and NAi is
the sum of MC generator-weights in the same pileup bin i.
The pileup weight is applied in an event by event basis. Figure 6.7 shows the pileup
weights as a function of muon pT , muon  and transverse mass for charged current
Drell-Yan events; the dependence of the pileup weight on muon pT and  is negligible,
however an interesting transverse mass dependence is displayed, it is a result of the
pileup affecting the missing energy distribution used to define mT .
6Matching data and Monte Carlo multiple pp interactions is needed since the Monte Carlo simulations
were produced with a generic pileup profile before data taking.

6.6 ATLAS Combined Performance tools
The corrections and calibrations applied to the physics objects described in previous sections,
are implemented using the official ATLAS Combined Performance tools. The analysis treated
in the present thesis was performed adapting the official ATLAS software AnalysisTop release
21 to the specific demands of W   signature. It is important to mention that the tools
also handle the systematic uncertainties further discussed in Chapter 9. Table 6.1 lists the
tools used in this analysis.

Event selection
This chapter is dedicated to outline the selection cuts performed to efficiently select charged
current Drell-Yan events.
7.1 Event Selection
The real time selection during data taking of interesting physics events recorded by ATLAS
has to be done carefully by means of the trigger systems; once these high pT events are
recorded, they must be further filtered at the analysis stage, depending on the type of physics
signature that is the subject of study. To select charged current Drell-Yan candidates, event
level and object level cuts are applied which reduce the background contamination, avoid
selecting fake muons and achieve high selection efficiency. The following sections briefly
explain the event and object level cuts that were studied and applied in the W  
selection.
7.1.1 Good Run List
The ATLAS data quality group is in charge of providing the information about the detector
status during the data taking. The information is stored in a file named the Good Run List
(GRL), and contains whether the conditions of the detector and the LHC operations were
optimal or not. It determines which runs or fractions1 of them are good for physics analyses.
1Each run in the ATLAS context, is divided by time periods of approximately 60 seconds, called lumi-
blocks.
CHAPTER 7. EVENT SELECTION 97
7.1.2 LAr error
Veto events with LAr noise burst. Noise bursts are defined when several thousands of
calorimeter cells, experience persistent noise deviations with respect to the standard Gaussian
noise coming from electronics.
Data integrity is checked by the LAr real time software during data taking, to ensure
that meaningful data is propagated to online systems, trigger decisions and event recording.
Events are vetoed if data is corrupted, i.e. failing one or more of these checks [61].
7.1.3 Primary vertex
Only events containing at least one primary vertex with three or more tracks associated with
it [62] are accepted in the W   analysis. A primary vertex is established as a point in
space where a proton-proton collision has been found. To correctly reconstruct a primary
vertex, tracks coming from the SCT detector and pixel detector are used; each track must
fulfil the following cuts:
 Transverse momentum cut, pT > 400 MeV.
 Transverse impact parameter, d0, cut, |d0| < 4 mm, where d0 is the distance of clos-
est approach in the transverse plane of a track to the primary vertex, as shown in
Figure 7.1.
 Transverse impact parameter uncertainty (d0), cut (d0) < 5 mm.
 Longitudinal impact parameter uncertainty, (z0 sin ), cut, (z0 sin ) < 10 mm, where
z0 sin , the longitudinal parameter, expresses the distance of the track to the primary
vertex in the longitudial plane at the point of closest approach in the r   plane.
7.1.4 Jet cleaning
Jet cleaning refers to the process of selecting events that contain poorly reconstructed or
non collision-related jets. First, jets are classified depending on their origin, whether if it is
a hard collision or if it is any other process. The jets are then classified as good or bad,
in this way an event is rejected if a bad jet is found. This analysis uses jets that satisfy the
Loose criteria [63].

and it is the distance of closest approach of the particle track, represented with a blue line,
to the primary vertex; here the primary vertex is found at the origin of coordinates in x-y
plane. In this diagram the conventional ATLAS reference frame is adopted.
7.1.5 Trigger selection and trigger matching
High level triggers are standard requirements in most physics analysis. The high level trig-
gers, the last step in the ATLAS triggering system, are software triggers and the trigger
decision is stored so it is available for after-data-taking (offline) analyses. This analysis, uses
a trigger chain of two triggers, HLT mu26 ivarmedium and HLT mu50. It is called a trigger
chain because the trigger requires a chain of logical conditions from L1 and HLT to trigger
an event. The event is recorded if either trigger is passed. The different parts of the triggers
names indicate the criteria that must be satisfied: HLT stands for high level trigger; mu
means that the trigger is applied to muons which is accompanied by a number that corre-
sponds to a transverse momentum requirement; and the third part, when applicable, states
the isolation cut that the object is needed to have. These triggers aim to select muons with
adequate reconstruction quality and physics interesting kinematics. The first trigger in the
chain has a muon pT threshold of 26 GeV and an ivarmedium isolation requirement
2. In
order to compensate for possible loss of efficiency at high pT , a second trigger with a muon
pT > 50 GeV, is also used. Moreover, trigger matching is required in such a way that the
2The isolation ivarmedium criteria are specified by R < 0.3 and
pTrackT /pT < 0.07 cuts (see Sec-
tion 7.1.6 for details on how the muon isolation is defined).
CHAPTER 7. EVENT SELECTION 99
selected muon is the one which fired the trigger i.e. the reconstructed muon and the trigger
muon are related with R < 0.1.
Trigger efficiency scale factors are calculated using a Z   tag and probe data driven
study. The trigger efficiency scale factors correct the difference in efficiencies between the
data and simulation after applying the trigger selections; the study, carried out by the
Combined Muon Performance group, follows the procedure outlined in Section 6.1.2 and it
is summarised in Equation (6.3). Figure 7.2 displays the average muon trigger efficiency as
a function of muon pT and , and transverse mass mT . The trigger efficiency scale factor
dependence on muon pT and transverse mass is small; on the other hand a strong muon 
dependence is present in the barrel region, this is expected since in that region the detector
efficiency it is relatively low and it is more difficult to model in the simulation due to the
geometry of the MDT trigger chambers in the barrel region of the MS, see Chapter 3.
7.1.6 Muon Isolation
To reduce the inclusion of muons coming from multijet background (heavy flavour decays
and jets faking muons), the concept of lepton isolation is introduced. It is possible that
multijet backgrounds produce leptons in the final state that comply with the signal selection
requirements; nevertheless, leptons arising from this background usually are surrounded by
abundant energy deposits from additional particles, as opposed to signal leptons that are
expected to be found isolated where most of the energy deposits correspond to them. A
quantity that incorporates this information is the muon (lepton) isolation,
pconeSizeT
, (7.1)
where pconeSizeT is the transverse momentum sum of all the objects inside a cone which size is
given by a specific R; p
T is the muon transverse momentum, the sum in the numerator of
Equation (7.1) excludes p
Tracking and calorimeter information is available to define the energy deposits to be
consider in calculating the muon isolation. The Muon Combined Performance group has
defined several isolation working points depending on which subdetectors are used. In this
analysis the FixedCutTightTrackOnly working point was chosen, and as the name suggests,
this working point only uses tracking information, which in the case of the muons come from
the ID and the MS. The FixedCutTightTrackOnly working point is determined by:

are displayed in blue and red respectively. The same behaviour is seen for W  .
CHAPTER 7. EVENT SELECTION 101
 The size of the cone in Equation (7.1) is a function of the muon pT , namely,
R = min
, (7.2)
where kT = 10 GeV is a parameter optimised for muons, p
T is the muon momentum
and R = 0.3 is the maximum size of the cone. Isolated muons are expected to be found
in the region of low I close to zero (I < 0.06).
Isolation efficiency scale factors were calculated by the MCP group employing the stan-
dard tag and probe methodology. In the same fashion as for the trigger efficiency scale
factors, a Z   sample was used to determine the efficiencies and then obtain the correc-
tions for the simulation to match the data. Figure 7.3 displays the average muon isolation
scale factors; the dependence on muon pT and  is very small, the same behaviour is observed
for the dependence on mT . The isolation scale factors are close 99%.
7.1.7 Muon kinematics
Imposing a high p
T cut, is useful for three reasons. First, it is expected that muons coming
from W bosons decays are energetic, therefore a p
T > 30 GeV is considered. Second, the
multijet background is efficiently rejected, as muons from this background generally are low-
pT , see Chapter 8. Finally, since the lowest trigger transverse momentum of the triggers
considered in this analysis is 26 GeV, it is recommended to establish the p
T above this value
to avoid effects from low efficiency.
A geometrical cut is applied on the muons requiring || < 2.4, given the acceptance of
ATLAS that is defined by the trigger chambers, the MS and ID acceptance of || = 2.7 and
|| = 2.5 respectively. Furthermore, it is important to have access to the muon reconstruction
efficiencies provided by the MCP group which are given in a region of || < 2.5.
7.1.8 Track-to-track vertex association
With the aim to reduce background events coming from multijet processes (see Chapter 8
for a discussion about this background), an association of the muon tracks with the hard
interaction vertex is achieved with the following muon selections:
 |d0/d0| < 3,
 z0 sin  < 0.5 mm,

this association is named the track-to-track vertex association (TTVA). The previous selec-
tions help to reduce the multijet production events, as a fraction of the leptons from multijet
objects is predicted to arise from the decays of secondary hadrons that have travelled away
from the IP before decaying, meaning that the vertex where the multijet leptons are pro-
duced should not match the hard collision vertex. Efficiency differences that appear from
TTVA cuts are used by the MCP group to calculate TTVA efficiency scale factors, with the
same isolation and identification methodology. Figure 7.4 displays the average muon TTVA
scale factors; the dependence on muon pT ,  and mT is very small. The TTVA efficiency
scale factors are close 99%.
CHAPTER 7. EVENT SELECTION 104
7.1.9 Missing transverse energy
Cutting on the missing transverse energy, once more helps to reduce the backgrounds. Fur-
thermore, in the charged current Drell-Yan process the missing energy should roughly balance
the muon transverse momentum, hence a similar cut is imposed; nevertheless for theoretical
interest, see Section 11.1.2, this cut has been set to be slightly different to EmissT > 25 GeV.
7.1.10 Transverse mass
For the neutral current Drell-Yan channel (Z/ boson production) ATLAS is able to fully
reconstruct the boson kinematics with the two final state charged leptons. In contrast for the
W boson production, only one charged lepton and the missing energy vector, an approximate
for the neutral charged lepton, could be reconstructed. Thus, the transverse massmT variable
is defined which can help to discriminate W boson events from background, and to perform
the cross section measurement:
T (1 cos(  E
T )), (7.3)
where p
T is the muon transverse momentum, E
T is the magnitude of the missing energy
vector and  and E
T are the muon and missing energy azimuthal angles, respectively.
This analysis requires is mT > 55 GeV (55 GeV or 50 GeV is a benchmark cut), this cut
also reduces background contributions.

Multijet background estimation
This chapter summarises the data driven procedures performed to estimate the multijet
background. First, the provenance of the multijet background is explained; next, a global
summary of the calculation strategy is given; then, the several estimation steps are explained
in more detail; finally, the results of the multijet background estimation are presented. The
systematic uncertainties of the multijet estimation are covered in Chapter 9.
8.1 Introduction
Multijet events are characterised by a signature involving several jets (> 3 jets); coloured
interactions are responsible of these processes, consequently at the LHC multijet events have
enormous cross sections. The jets of these events could be identified as part of a physics
interesting signal, hence multijet events represent a prime background of most LHC analyses.
The multijet background was not discussed in Chapter 5; the reason is that the multijet
background differs from the electroweak and top quark backgrounds, in the sense that Monte
Carlo simulations are not capable to accurately1 characterise all the sources responsible for its
existence. This measurements final state consists in one muon accompanied by a neutrino,
therefore when a multijet process gives rise to the same final state it contaminates the charged
current Drell-Yan number of events. For the muon channel the main multijet background
emerges from semileptonic decays of bottom and charm quarks or when a hadron (pion
or kaon) formed within a jet decays into leptons; lastly, jets faking muons also contribute
to the multijet background. A jet in the ATLAS detector is seen as collection of particle
tracks in the MS and ID sub-detectors, in addition energy deposits in the calorimeters aid
to identify the jet; this collection of particles has a definite cone shape which is identified
1The inaccuracies are associated with theoretical uncertainties of QCD modelling, leading to an imprecise
knowledge of the cross section values or to the approximate description of the underlying hadronic activity.
CHAPTER 8. MULTIJET BACKGROUND ESTIMATION 107
using specialised algorithms, see Section 6.3.
Many of the selection filters applied to select W candidates are thought to reduce the
multijet contamination:
 Leptons from a hard collision are expected to be isolated, i.e. these leptons are expected
to be found in a restricted spatial region where the deposited energy comes only from
the leptons themselves.
 An event rate that is not dominated by multijet contamination must not contain low
transverse momentum leptons, low transverse mass and low missing energy.
 It is expected that the muon d0 significance distribution follows a Gaussian shape
centred at zero, consistent with the experimental resolution. Real muons from W
decays have small impact parameter, whereas muons from multijet background have
large impact parameter.
 Charged current Drell-Yan decay products (muon and neutrino) are expected to be
roughly kinematically balanced in transverse momentum.
The cross section of the multijet background is considerably larger than the rest of the
processes participating in proton-proton collisions, as a consequence, notwithstanding the
selection criteria established in Chapter 7, it is not possible to completely remove this back-
ground. Given that the Monte Carlo simulations are not used to account for estimating the
multijet background, data driven techniques are typically adopted. The following sections
contain the data driven procedure used to estimate the multijet events in the present thesis.
8.2 Multijet estimation strategy
The multijet background was calculated with the aid of data driven techniques, in partic-
ular, the fraction fit method inspired on the W mass measurement methodology [64], was
considered. The major steps are summarised as follows:
 First step: multijet shape. Computation of the multijet shape in a phase space con-
structed by applying the full nominal W selection criteria, plus an inverted selection
criterion, which enriches this phase space with multijet events. The procedure is per-
formed for every control distribution of interest.
 Second step: normalisation. The multijet background cross section, as opposed to
the electroweak and top cross sections, is not known; hence, it is needed to obtain it
CHAPTER 8. MULTIJET BACKGROUND ESTIMATION 108
using a multijet dominated phase space. The later is achieved by means of a fraction
template fit of the transverse mass and the missing energy distributions, performed on
data within a multijet dominated fit phase space, where no transverse mass nor missing
energy cuts are applied, and obtain the fractions of the purely multijet sample and the
Monte Carlo simulated backgrounds that conform these distributions. The fraction of
the purely multijet sample is equivalent to the multijet background cross section.
 Third step: final normalisation. The normalisation of the multijet background shape
associated with the first step, is determined from the cross section obtained in the
second step; these are the multijet distributions and number of events in the complete
charged current Drell-Yan phase space. The multijet cross section is assumed to be
global, i.e. is the same in both the fit and signal phase spaces.
8.3 Multijet estimation
8.3.1 Multijet discriminant variable
Ordinarily, one of the most used discriminant variables between signal and multijet pro-
cesses is the lepton isolation. Nevertheless, the present analysis employs a trigger chain, to
select high pT objects, which incorporates a trigger with an intrinsic muon isolation (see
Chapter 7); furthermore, the cross section and muon charge asymmetry measurements are
performed differentially in muon pseudorapidity bins, demanding enough statistics to esti-
mate the multijet background in each bin; taking into account the latter points, the use of
muon isolation implicates scarce statistics for good multijet estimation performance attained.
Alternatively, in this analysis a different discriminant variable was explored: the muon d0
significance, |d0/(d0)|. The muon d0 significance acts as a discriminant variable included in
the TTVA cut, in which a d0 significance requirement (|d0/(d0)| < 3) is intended to discard
muons originated from decaying pions, product of jet hadronisation2. Therefore, the phase
space with |d0/(d0)| > 3 is expected to be multijet dominated.
The top-left plot of Figure 8.1 displays the data and MC muon d0 significance distribu-
tions, in the phase space that includes all the W boson selection criteria with the TTVA
cut applied; the lower panel shows the ratio between data and MC; from this ratio it is seen
that the Monte Carlo prediction is not describing accurately the recorded data. The latter
2Pions found in jets live long enough in such a way that their decays take place farther from the primary
vertex compared with W bosons; consequently, the pion decaying muons tracks are expected to be described
by a large impact parameter.
CHAPTER 8. MULTIJET BACKGROUND ESTIMATION 109
is expected in the |d0/(d0)| > 3 region as it is multijet enriched, where the Monte Carlo
simulation loses prediction power. However, in the region with |d0/(d0)| < 3, the multijet
contribution is relatively small and it is expected to not affect the shape of the data and
MC agreement; accordingly, a correction to accommodate the data and MC offset for the
|d0/(d0)| distribution is indispensable in order to properly discriminate between electroweak
and top processes against multijet processes.
The correction is constituted in two steps:
 Shift the average mean of the MC distribution to match the average mean which
corresponds to data.
 Perform a reweighting of the MC muon d0 significance distribution to match the cor-
responding data distribution.
The weight is a function of the muon d0 significance variable and it is calculated with the
ratio between a Gaussian distribution fitted to the data and a Gaussian distribution fitted to
the MC simulation; the range of the Gaussian fits covers the interval 2.5  d0/(d0)  2.5,
which is a region where the multijet contribution has a negligible effect, and hence the
transverse impact parameter of prompt muons is expected to behave in a Gaussian manner.
To compute the weight in the full d0 significance interval, the Gaussian fit parameters
from data and MC are used to extrapolate the ratio between the fits. In order to prevent
anomalously high weights to be assigned to regions where multijet background is expected
to be present, the weight is set to a constant value for |d0/(d0)|  5, equal to the value of
the weight function evaluated in those points. Finally, the d0 significance weight is an event
by event weight thus, a normalisation is applied to ensure that the weights do not affect the
final number of predicted events.
The top-right plot of Figure 8.1 shows the weight function applied for the negative charged
current Drell-Yan selection (the equivalent plot is available for the positive channel). The
bottom plots of Figure 8.1 display the d0 significance distributions, in the region |d0/(d0)| <
3 (left) and where there is no |d0/(d0)| restriction (right), after the corrections on the MC
simulation have been applied; the agreement is good in the low multijet region. These
corrections are important since a mismodelling of the discriminant variable leads to the
underestimation or overestimation of the multijet number events.

CHAPTER 8. MULTIJET BACKGROUND ESTIMATION 111
8.3.2 Multijet shape
The first step of the multijet estimation is to determine the shape of the multijet in each
control kinematic distribution. The phase space of interest is where the full criteria to select
charged current Drell-Yan events are imposed. To obtain the shape in this phase space,
the d0 significance cut is inverted, i.e. |d0/(d0)| > 3, while maintaining the rest of the cuts
unchanged; the procedure is performed on data which will provide a purely multijet enriched
sample once the electroweak (including signal W  ) and top processes are subtracted.
Figure 8.2 - Figure 8.4 embody the multijet shape determination; the data and the simulation
are displayed in the plots, the difference between them provides the multijet shape.
8.3.3 Multijet normalisation
The multijet normalisation is extracted from a fraction fit methodology. In the procedure,
the transverse mass and missing energy distributions in data are fitted, within a phase space
that it is multijet enriched, to the equivalent distributions in Monte Carlo and purely multijet
samples. The details of the procedure are explained in the following:
 The fitting region (FR), which is multijet enriched, is defined as the region where the
transverse mass mT and the missing energy E
T cuts are dropped, together with a
cut on the W boson transverse momentum (pWT < 30 GeV) requirement; FR is defined
for both signal and inverted muon d0 significance selections. The transverse mass and
missing energy cuts are dropped given that the multijet backgrounds peak at lower
values with respect to the W   process; the W boson transverse mass cut was set
to remove a poorly MC modelled region.
 The cross section and charge asymmetry measurement phase space that considers the
full selection criteria is referred to as signal region (SR). Table 8.1 summarises the cuts
applied in the phase spaces considered to perform the fit.
 The fit is performed in the EmissT and mT variables (fitting variables). The analytical
expression used to perform the fit reads as,
T NFRantid0jet + NFRd0MC = N
FRd0
data , (8.1)
where T and  are the fractions corresponding to the multijet contribution and the
Monte Carlo simulations in the fit, respectively; NFRantid0jet is the distribution of the
fitting variable, of which its integral is the number of multijet events in the fit region
with the inverted d0 significance (antid0) cut; N
FRd0
MC is the distribution of the fitting

variable of which its integral is the MC number of events in the fit region with the d0
significance cut applied; and NFRd0data is the distribution of the fitting variable which
its integral is the number of data events in the fitting region with the d0 significance
cut applied. NFRd0data shape and number of events are known and it is claimed to be
fully described by a purely multijet sample plus a MC sample, therefore the goal of
the fraction fit methodology is to calculate the fraction of each of the multijet and
Monte Carlo contributions; when the fit is being carried out,  and T are admitted to
vary, while the intrinsic normalisations of the Monte Carlo samples involved, are set
to the proton-proton collisions cross sections along with the data luminosity utilised.
The data distribution NFRd0data includes the d0 significance cut, which is the muon d0
significance requirement for the W   cross section and muon charge asymmetry;
thus the methodology relies on the assumption that T , the multijet normalisation (cross
section), is the same for both the fit and the measurement phase spaces, further details
are provided in Appendix A.
 The final multijet number of events in the signal region with the d0 significance cut
applied is,
NSRd0jet = T NSRantid0jet . (8.2)
To correctly use Equation (8.1) and Equation (8.2) it is necessary to obtain the involved
distributions for the SR and FR regions:

where the superindices reference the region that it is being accounted, SR  d0 is the

distributions.
 The multijet enriched distributions using the inverted d0 significance criterion (this in-
verted selection is demanded because it is expected that the decay products of hadrons
produced in multijet processes are found within |d0/(d0)| > 3), in both the signal and
fitting regions, are constructed with the difference between data and MC, namely,

where the subindex jet indicates the multijet sample and the superindices denote the
region that is being accounted for: FR  antid0 is the fitting region criteria plus the
inverted d0 significance cut, SR  antid0 is the W selection criteria plus the inverted
d0 significance. These distributions are displayed in Figure 8.7 and Figure 8.8.
Taking into account the distributions described by Equation (8.3)-Equation (8.5) (dis-
played in Figure 8.5-Figure 8.8) it is possible to perform the fit of Equation (8.1). The
results of the fit are shown in Figure 8.9. In overall, the performance of the fit is good;
since the fit is performed in a bin-by-bin basis, the bins with low statistics are prone to
be not well accounted for. The lower panels in each plot compare the distribution in data
denoted as NFRd0data against the outcome of the fit, the agreement is at subpercent level in
the high statistics bins and at percent level in the low statistics bins. The full methodology
was performed in each muon pseudorapidity bin of the final measurement, see Chapter 11.
The plots in Figure 8.9 correspond to the inclusive ||, however the same class of plots were

percentage comparison (NMultijet/NData) of the number of multijet events against the number
of data events, these values exhibit the impact that the multijet background has on the total
number of recorded events; it is found that the multijet contribution is close to 1% in both
inclusively and in || bins. Despite the fact that the amount of 2017 data is large, the
highest ||, in the multijet enriched phase space, suffers from poor statistics; in this case
the multijet methodology described in this chapter fails, in which case and given that the
multijet contribution in these bins is very small, the multijet background contribution is set
to be zero, see Figure 8.2; furthermore, a conservative uncertainty of 200% is assigned to
these low statistics muon pseudorapidity bins.
Table 8.4 gives the comparison between the positive and negative charged Drell-Yan
multijet events, defined by Multijet = (NMultijet(W

Analysing the latter definition in the values from Table 8.4, a positive value indicates that
the number of events in the W+  + channel is larger and a negative value indicates that
the number of events in the W   channel is larger. Multijet is given in percentage.
A comparison with the previous result of the charge asymmetry measurement was done, and
it is concluded that the results of this thesis are consistent with them [65].
In Chapter 10 the control distributions, including the multijet background are presented,
it is found that prediction is describing good the data.

Chapter 9
Systematic uncertainties
Precision measurements heavily rely on how the uncertainties affect the final results, therefore
it is vital to understand and study each source of uncertainty and how it propagates through
the analysis. This chapter summarises the source of both experimental and theoretical
uncertainties.
9.1 Systematic uncertainty definition
The uncertainties affect the cross section and asymmetry results through the shape of the
distributions and the normalisation itself. This analysis considers up and down variations
with respect to the nominal event yields, which correspond to shift these yields up and down
by one standard deviation for a given uncertainty. Various expressions are used in different
cases:
 To obtain the uncertainty of a single bin,
N inom N isys
N inom
(9.1)
is used, where i is the uncertainty in the ith bin, N inom is the number of entries in
the ith bin when there is no systematic variation applied (nominal) and N isys is the
number of entries in the bin i when a systematic variation is applied. i helps to study
the effect of each individual systematic bin-by-bin on the cross section and charge
asymmetry; a positive sign is designated to the up variations and a negative sign to
the down variations.
CHAPTER 9. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES 123
 A similar quantity to Equation (9.1) is the total contribution of each systematic,
Nnom Nsys
. (9.2)
 For every bin, the total uncertainty when the full set of uncertainties is taken into
account, reads as,
i,total =
(N inom N isys1)2
(N2nom)
+ ...+
(N inom Nsysn)2
N2nom
. (9.3)
 The total uncertainty, considering all the bins and uncertainties, is computed with
total =
(Nnom Nsys1)2
N2nom
+ ...+
(Nnom Nsysn)2
N2nom
, (9.4)
where total is the total uncertainty, Nnom is the total number of events, and Nsys is the
total number of events when a given systematic variation has been applied; the sum
runs over all the systematics considered. total is used for the total cross section and
charge asymmetry.
The number of charged current Drell-Yan events, after passing the selection criteria, depends
on each of these cuts. For example the kinematic cuts, e.g. p
T , 
, EmissT , represent a source
of uncertainty on the number of events, since the experimental determination of their values
is affected by a number of systematic uncertainties. This is because, when considering fixed
cuts, the fluctuation of the kinematic variables values could change the final number of
events when applying a specific selection criterion. Counting the number of events is a linear
function, therefore the error propagation could be expressed as in Equations 9.3 and 9.4 for
the case when it is assumed that uncertainties of every kinematic variable are uncorrelated
and independent of each other. This approximation yields a vanishingly small covariance
between variables, hence the correlation between the different errors is small.
The above mentioned approximation is reasonable in light of the independent approaches
used when determining the different kinematic variables and muon identification; for exam-
ple, it is expected that the muon transverse momentum should be independent from the
event missing energy calculation. A more detailed treatment needs to be considered to ad-
dress the correlation between the transverse mass (Equation (7.3)) and the missing energy
and the muon kinematics, as the transverse mass is a function of these. Nevertheless, the
approach used in this thesis is conservative since taking into account the correlations would
CHAPTER 9. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES 124
reduce the total errors.
In the next sections, a simple definition, for display reasons, is used to express the sys-
tematic variations in such a way that the values are symmetric1 with respect to the up and
down variations:
sim =
|up|+ |down|
, (9.5)
a positive and negative signs are assigned to the symmetrised down and up variations, re-
spectively, and thus only up variations are shown in the following plots.
Moreover, the systematics are displayed in the control distributions found in Chapter 10,
to reflect the impact that the variation of the physics objects has, when a systematic uncer-
tainty is evaluated on the number of expected signal and background events.
9.2 Experimental uncertainties
The experimental uncertainties originate due to the fact that it is not possible to have a
perfect modelling of the ATLAS detector and the corrections to mitigate the latter, impli-
cate statistical and systematic uncertainties. It is important to note that the values of the
systematic variations were calculated utilising the binning defined in Equation (11.3), the
cross section and charge asymmetry final binning. This section covers a brief description of
the relevant uncertainties for the charged Drell-Yan measurement.
9.2.1 Muon efficiency scale factors
The muon efficiency scale factor systematic variations are displayed in Figure 9.1. An un-
certainty coming from the muon identification is considered; additionally, selection efficiency
variations from the isolation, trigger and TTVA selection criteria are studied. The present
uncertainties are provided by the MCP group; nevertheless, the author of this document
extracted the uncertainties appropriated for the charged Drell-Yan selection criteria. A
summary of the source of these uncertainties is presented in the following.
1This definition is used to evaluate qualitatively the effect of the each systematic and to ease their
visualisation in Figures 9.1,9.2,9.3,9.4; nevertheless the results presented in Table 9.6 are asymmetric where
the up and down values are not averaged.

Figure 9.1: These plots show the individual contributions of the systematic variations to the
number of events, expressed in Equations (9.1) and (9.5), given differentially in || bins.
Top plots display the effect of the event by event muon isolation and identification efficiency
scale factor variations. Bottom plots display the effect of the event by event muon trigger
and TTVA selection efficiency scale factor variations. The plots on the left correspond to
the W selection whereas the plots on the right correspond to the W+ selection. All the
values are presented in percentage.
Muon identification scale factor uncertainties
 Given that the Z   and J/   data and simulated samples used to calculate
the identification scale factors are finite, there is a statistical uncertainty associated
with them.
 An uncertainty in the background subtraction is assessed.
 In the tag and probe method, a definite cone size is used; a variation arising from this
choice is obtained varying the cone by 50 %.
CHAPTER 9. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES 126
 Reconstruction level tag and probe method was used. A comparison with a truth level
tag and probe baseline method was performed. The agreement is found to be better
than 0.1%.
 For muons of pT > 200 GeV, a simulated 2-3% uncertainty is added to account for
an upper limit on the identification efficiency scale factor variation for large muon
momenta extracted from simulation.
Muon isolation scale factor uncertainties
 The statistical contribution to the systematics is considered.
 The backgrounds are varied within their uncertainties.
 Another source of systematic is obtained by changing the selection criteria in the tag
and probe method.
 An uncertainty appears due to the fact that the  dependence of the isolation scale
factors has been neglected.
Muon trigger scale factor uncertainties
 The statistical contribution to the systematics is considered.
 The systematics coming from the background are calculated by changing the nominal
tag and probe selections.
 Systematic uncertainties related with the event topology and the pT dependence are
included.
Muon TTVA scale factor uncertainties
 The statistical contribution to the systematics is considered.
 The backgrounds are varied within their uncertainties and changing the selections of
the tag and probe method.
The total uncertainty is the sum in quadrature of the individual contributions in every scale
factor. For the isolation scale factor, the low pT region it is found to be at permile level
whilst at high pT is at percentage level.

Figure 9.2: These plots show the individual contributions of the systematic variations to the
number of events, expressed in Equations (9.1) and (9.5), given differentially in || bins.
Here it is displayed the effect of the muon scale and resolution, and muon sagitta correction
uncertainties. The plots on the left correspond to the W selection whereas the plots on the
left correspond to the W+ selection. All the values are presented in percentage.
From Figure 9.1 it is seen that the dependence on || and the contributions of these un-
certainties are small (below half percent); however, in the first || bins, for the identification
scale factor efficiency, a large uncertainty value is present, the reason is that in this area of
the detector the muon identification is more difficult to perform, see Figure 6.3. A similar
behaviour can be seen in both the negative and positive charged Drell-Yan selections.
9.2.2 Muon momentum scale and resolution
 The muon momentum calibration was done using data and MC samples of Z  
and J/   decays. The corresponding statistical error is added to the systematics.
 A source of resolution correction uncertainty arises from the alignment of the MS
chambers.
 The choice of an arbitrary invariant mass window uncertainty is calculated by varying
this quantity by 5 GeV.
 Scale uncertainties come from the fact that non-linear effects may appear when fitting
the ID correction separately in the Z   and J/   samples.
Figure 9.2 shows the systematic variations that correspond to the muon calibration.
The muon scale uncertainty shows a sizeable || dependence, this is due to the fact that
CHAPTER 9. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES 128
the calibrations are || dependent, since the amount of detector material traversed by
the particle is different in each || bin. The latter indicates that the more material the
muon traverses the more difficult and inaccurate is the associated scale correction. The
contributions coming from the muon calibration to the total uncertainty are below to 1%. A
similar behaviour is observed for both the negative and positive charged Drell-Yan selections.
9.2.3 Muon Sagitta
The muon sagitta correction uncertainties are small. The source of uncertainties for the res-
olution of the muon momentum and the determination of the correction itself, are calculated
when comparing the magnitude of the corrections for the negative and positive channels
at detector level. Figure 9.2 shows the systematic variations that correspond to the muon
sagitta bias corrections. These uncertainties do not depend on || and their values are
extremely small, most bins are comparable in size with the muon momentum scale and
resolution uncertainties. A similar behaviour is present for both the negative and positive
charged Drell-Yan selections.
9.2.4 Pileup reweighting
The pileup reweighting implements an additional data scale factor to further improve the
agreement between data and simulation of the pileup distributions (see Section 6.5), that
corresponds to the numerical value of 1/1.03; this correction aims to include the mismodelling
originated by inelastic activity and to match the number of primary vertices as a function of
average number of pileup interactions. The data scale factor is varied up and down by one
standard deviation; these variations are taken as the systematic uncertainty of the pileup
reweighting.
Figure 9.3 shows the systematic variations that correspond to the pileup reweighting. The
|| dependence of the pileup contribution to the uncertainty is negligible. The contribution
of the pileup reweighting is around 0.5% in every || bin. A similar behaviour is present for
both the negative and positive charged Drell-Yan selections.
9.2.5 Missing energy
The missing energy vector is constituted by leptons, photons and jets, therefore the uncer-
tainties coming from these objects are propagated to the missing energy vector calculation.
Another contribution to the EmissT variation arises by the reconstruction of the soft term:
the track soft term uncertainties are calculated by comparing the data and Monte Carlo

selection. All the values are presented in percentage. The labels contained in the legend
of both plots use the conventional names given by the JetEtMiss group: MET stands for
missing energy; SofTrk makes reference to the fact that EmissT is calculated with the TST
methodology described in Section 6.4; ResoPara and ResoPerp refer to the resolution
uncertainty on the parallel and perpendicular component, respectively.
simulation using the balance of the soft term and the hard objects. Additionally, the under-
lying event uncertainties are also included in the total missing energy uncertainty. Figure 9.3
show the missing energy uncertainties; the || dependence is small, although not negligible
being consistent with the uncertainties of the missing energy constituents; the value of these
uncertainties is as large as 0.25%. A similar behaviour is observed for both the negative and
positive charged Drell-Yan selections.
9.2.6 Jets
The first source of systematics that affects the jets is that coming from the scale and resolu-
tion of the objects (muons, electrons and photons) that conform the jet; furthermore, there
is an uncertainty related with the efficiency of the JVT cut applied to select jets; there is
an uncertainty originated by the statistical limitation of the data and MC samples used to
perform the calibrations. The jet uncertainties account for assumptions made in the event
topology, MC simulations and reconstruction algorithms; uncertainties from pileup are in-
cluded to add the mismodelling of the number of primary vertices, number of interactions
and residual pT dependences. Monte Carlo corrections generated in  bins also contribute

to the uncertainty. A high pT jet uncertainty is derived from single-particle response and is
applied to jets with pT > 2 TeV. Additionally, uncertainties are considered to account for the
difference in the jet response and composition of light-quark, b-quark, and gluon-initiated
jets. In this analysis the flavour composition uncertainty is negligible.
The jet uncertainties are binned in jet  and pT and are treated as fully correlated. The
uncertainty value is a function of jet pT , starting at 4.5% for low pT , decreasing to 1% at
200 GeV (throughout this pT region the uncertainties are statistically dominated) [66].
The number of jet uncertainties is large, making their processing computationally ex-
pensive. The ATLAS JetEtMiss group2 recommends using sets of systematics that merge
various individual systematics in order to reduce the computational resources needed for
a given physics analysis; adopting a reduced set of systematics depends on each analysis,
in some analyses is not appropriate to make such a choice and the full set must be incor-
porated. For the charged current Drell-Yan analysis, a reduced set was chosen following a
study performed to compare different reduced sets and considering that a complete set of jet
uncertainties is not necessary since the final state does not directly contain jets. Making use
of Equation (9.4), the effect of each recommended set of jet systematics was calculated and
the results of the latter, found in Table 9.1, express the sum in quadrature of the relative
change of number of events when each individual variation is applied in comparison to the
nominal case. The recommended sets are the strongly reduced scenarios referred to as 1,2,3
and 4, the category reduced, the globally reduced and all the systematic sources. Among
these scenarios, it was decided to use the strongly reduced scenario 1 set as it is the one which

CHAPTER 9. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES 132
has the most conservative impact on the number of selected events. Table 9.6 shows a full
list of the experimental systematics considered in this analysis (in which the jet systematics
are included). The official names of the jet systematics are provided by the JetEtMiss group,
the variations that each jet systematic takes care of are:
 JET EtaIntercalibration NonClosure. A jet correction is applied to take into account
biases in the jet  reconstruction caused by the transition between different calorimeter
environments and sudden changes in calorimeter granularity; the non-closure of the
corrections is covered by this jet uncertainty.
 JET JER DataVsMC. The uncertainties coming from the use of different MC genera-
tors to study the agreement with data of the several kinematic jet variables.
 JET GroupedNP 1,2,3. These uncertainties come from pileup, Z/+jet and multijet
balance in-situ calibrations which account for assumptions made in the event topology,
MC simulation, and sample statistics. Moreover, these uncertainties account electron,
muon, and photon energy scales uncertainties. A combination of the nuisance parame-
ters associated with these systematics is performed. The reduction is performed when
components of the systematics are found to be the largest, these are kept and the
remaining components are quadratically combined into a single nuisance parameter
(NP). The losses on correlation across jet pT and  are at percent level. The strongly
reduced scenario 1 comprising four grouped NPs, considers a general representation
with low, medium, and high pT kinematic regimes [66].
 JET JER EffectiveNP 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. These uncertainties cover the same variations as
the JET GroupedNP 1,2,3 systematics; nevertheless, the manner in which the reduc-
tion of nuisance parameters is implemented is slightly different, considering an effective
average of NPs.
Figure 9.4 shows the systematic variations that correspond to the jet objects. The ||
dependence is small, nevertheless not negligible in accordance with the uncertainties of their
constituents. The jet uncertainties are the largest of this analysis, the main component is
the Scenario 1 JET GroupedNP 1, being close to 1.5% in every muon pseudorapidity bin. A
similar behaviour is noticed for both the negative and positive charged Drell-Yan selections.
9.2.7 Luminosity
The uncertainty in the 2017 integrated luminosity is 2.4%. It is derived following a method-
ology similar to that detailed in [67], and using the LUCID-2 detector for the baseline lumi-
nosity measurements [68], from calibration of the luminosity scale using x-y beam-separation
CHAPTER 9. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES 133
scans. The LUCID-2 detector consists of several Cherenkov detectors for luminosity mea-
surements and monitoring, it uses thin quartz windows of photomultipliers as Cherenkov
medium and employs radioactive sources deposited to these windows, arming the detector
with the demanded stability; since more than one interaction take place when the bunches of
particles cross each other at the LHC, the luminosity measurement translates into measure
the average number of interactions; the LUCID-2 detectors surround the beam pipe on both
sides of the interaction point [69].
9.3 Multijet estimation uncertainties
There are several sources of uncertainties that affect the calculated number of events com-
ing from the multijet background. To handle the low statistics || bins, a conservative
uncertainty of 200% is assigned3.
 Chapter 8 discusses the discriminant criteria between multijet background and signal
processes; it was established the d0 significance as this discriminant variable. To cor-
rectly select multijet events, it was necessary to reweight the MC simulation to improve
the accuracy of the d0 significance MC description seen in data; the reweighting itself
is at some extent arbitrary, in the sense that the range of the fitting functions, and the
value at which the weight starts to be a constant, are established under the assumption
that in this fitting region the multijet effect is small; consequently, a systematic uncer-
tainty is associated to the d0 significance reweighting procedure, varying the Gaussian
functions fitting ranges by 0.5, furthermore, the value where the reweighting func-
tions starts to be a constant is accommodated by the same length. Table 9.2 and
Table 9.3 show the results of performing these variations; the last two columns display
the up and down variations computed with Equation (9.2). The uncertainty in the
inclusive pseudorapidity bin is around 30%, and differentially in each bin ranges be-
tween 12-50% in the high statistics bins. These values may appear large, nevertheless
it is important to note that the effect on the final cross sections and charge asymmetry
measurements is small, since the contribution of the multijet background in the signal
region is close to 1%. A discussion of the propagation of the uncertainty is given in
Chapter 11.
 The statistical uncertainty of the fraction fit calculation, is determined via a maximum
3Assigning a 200% uncertainty appears to be an overestimate; nevertheless, the pseudorapidity bins where
this is assigned are almost free of multijet of background events, furthermore the percentage of total multijet
events w.r.t. to data is below 1%; consequently, a large error in almost not multijet populated bins results
in a small overall error in these bins.

likelihood fit, following the derivation presented in [70]. The statistical uncertainty on
the determined multijet background fractions is found to be negligible. Note that this
statistical uncertainty is independent of the estimated low statistic multijet background
|| bins.
 Another source of uncertainty comes from the variation of the Monte Carlo cross sec-
tions used to build the pure multijet sample. The MC theoretical cross section uncer-
tainty is close to 5%, accordingly these variations were applied to the simulation when
calculating the multijet number of events. The results are found in tables Table 9.4
and Table 9.5. The last two right columns show the up and down variations computed
with Equation (9.2). The uncertainty in the inclusive bin is close to 25% and for each
pseudorapidity bin between 10-50%. The values propagated to the final measurements
are small given that the multijet contribution to the final number of events is close to
1%. A discussion of the propagation of the uncertainty is given in Chapter 11.

events; the third and fourth columns are the up and down varied number of multijet events;
the fifth and sixth columns show the up and down variation computed with Equation (9.1),
in percentage.
9.4 Theory uncertainties
The theory uncertainties propagate to the measurements via the CW factor examined in
Chapter 11. The CW is a ratio between two quantities that are affected by these variations;
consequently, the effect of these uncertainties is mainly cancelled out and their effect is
expected to be very small (< 0.1%). The theory uncertainties enter via the kFactor weight
stated in Equation (5.1), the nominal NNLO correction is computed with the CT14 NNLO
[10] PDF set, and the variation of the CW is dictated by the variation of the kFactor. For the
control plots in Chapter 10 and the cross section and muon charge asymmetry measurements
results presented in Chapter 11, the theory uncertainties are neglected. Appendix B presents
the first steps to calculate the theory uncertainties.
9.5 Summary
In order to quantify the contribution of each systematic considered in this analysis, it is
fruitful to examine their value inclusively with the use of Equation (9.2) (similar tables for
every muon pseudorapidity bin are found in Appendix C). A list of the considered uncer-
tainties is highlighted in Table 9.6 for the experimental uncertainties; this table presents the
CHAPTER 9. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES 137
value for the up and down variations in the positive and negative W   selections; it is
important to add that the displayed values do not use the symmetric definition contained in
Equation (9.5).
The experimental uncertainties provide the largest values coming from jet systematics
variations, ranging from 0.1-1.4%; the second largest uncertainty values are from the missing
energy and pileup ranging from 0.1-0.6%; likewise, the muon momentum scale and resolution
uncertainties are close to 0.2%; next, the variations from scale factor efficiency corrections
are in the range of 0.01-0.3%; the smallest uncertainties come from the ID and MS and are
close to 0.01%; the sagitta bias correction uncertainties are negligible.

Chapter 10
Control distributions and cutflows
The behaviour of the kinematic distributions seen by the ATLAS detector is one of the
corner stones of the present analysis; namely, the agreement of the number of events in a
binned distribution, between the data collected by ATLAS and the cross sections predictions
of the different processes, convoluted with detector response, is of particular importance.
Furthermore, the impact that every selection criterion has on the number of events is of
interest, these effects are summarised in what is called cutflow tables. This chapter contains
key kinematic distributions and cutflows tables that help to compare the data with the
prediction, throwing light on the validity of the W boson selection criteria and the cross
section and charge asymmetry measurements.
10.1 Control distributions
The control distributions shown in Figures 10.1-10.8 display the events that fulfil the selec-
tion requirements explained in Chapter 7. The uncertainty bands in each plot include the
systematic uncertainties discussed in Chapter 9 calculated with Equation (9.3), the uncer-
tainties coming from the multijet calculation summarised in Chapter 8, and the statistical
uncertainties. Furthermore, the Monte Carlo predictions are weighted using the product of
the weights presented in Section 6.1.2, displayed in Figures 6.4,6.5,6.7,7.2,7.3,7.4 which are
defined in Equation (6.9), Equation (5.1). The Monte Carlo simulations included in these
plots are normalised according to the pp cross section, and a scale is applied to match the
luminosity in data; moreover, the pileup reweighting is accounted in order to guarantee that
the predicted cross section is unchanged by the pileup weight; this factor is referred to as
luminosity scale,

 Muon transverse momentum, pT . The charged current Drell-Yan selection depends
heavily on the cut performed on the p
T , therefore it is essential to study the differen-
tial p
T distribution; Figure 10.1 shows this distribution, at low transverse momentum
values (30-50 GeV) the contribution of the background is the highest. The distribu-
tion is peaked at 40 GeV given the final state muons exhibit a transverse momentum
nearly equal to the half of the W boson mass. The data and prediction agreement,
displayed on the lower panel of Figure 10.1, is at percent level in the high statistics
region; however, at higher p
T values the difference between data and prediction be-
comes substantial ( 20%) due to the known mismodelling of the W boson transverse
momentum spectrum; this feature has been observed in previous analysis [64, 71].

checked with the muon pseudorapidity; the distributions displayed in Figures 10.2 and
10.3 are flat as expected in signal and backgrounds1, considering that this angular
variable, defined in Equation (3.3), should not manifest any preferred value since the
ATLAS detector is built to detect muons equally well in the region || < 2.4. The data
and prediction agreement, displayed on the lower panels of Figures 10.2 and 10.3, is at
percent level in all pseudorapidity bins. For this thesis, the  is of special relevance
due to the cross section and charge asymmetry measurements are performed in  bins;
the difference between Figures 10.2 and 10.3 is the binning, the latter corresponding
to the binning used to perform this thesis measurements.
 Muon azimuthal angle, . A flat distribution of the muon azimuthal angle is expected
since the muons, originated from charged current Drell-Yan and background events, do
not have a definite preference on a  value; furthermore, the cylindrical geometry of
the ATLAS detector allows to reconstruct objects equally well for the full azimuthal an-
gle. Figure 10.4 shows these features and the data and prediction agreement, displayed
on the lower panel, is at percent level in all  bins.
1The contribution from Z   background events is slightly larger in the high ||, since for this process
is more difficult two relate two muons in this region.

 Event missing energy, EmissT . The event missing energy defined in Equations (6.5)-
(6.8) is used to select W   events inasmuch as it acts as an approximate of the
neutrino transverse momentum; for these events, the neutrino and muon kinematics
are roughly balanced, thus the EmissT distribution is likewise peaked at 40 GeV. The
background events contribute the most in the low EmissT region. These features are
presented in Figure 10.5 along with the data and prediction agreement, displayed on
the lower panel, showing a percent level of agreement in the high statistics region; at
higher EmissT values the difference between data and prediction becomes substantial
( 10%).
 Missing azimuthal angle, EmissT . A flat distribution of the muon azimuthal angle is
expected since the neutrinos (approximately missing energy), originated from charged
current Drell-Yan and background events, do not have a definite preference on a E
value; furthermore, the cylindrical geometry of the ATLAS detector allows to recon-
struct objects equally well for the full azimuthal angle. Figure 10.6 shows these features
and the data and prediction agreement, displayed on the lower panel, is at percent level
in all E
T bins.

 Difference of azimuthal angle between the muon and the event missing energy, .
This distribution is an useful check to validate the W   selection criteria because
the muon and the neutrino are expected to be produced mainly back-to-back, i.e. the
azimuthal angle separation between them is close to . In Figure 10.7 it is seen that
the major part of the events agree with this expectation, including the events from the
electroweak backgrounds; conversely, a muon and neutrino coming from multijet back-
ground processes, exhibit small azimuthal angle separation. The data and prediction
agreement, displayed on the lower panel of Figure 10.7, is at percent level in the high
statistics region,   ; however, at smaller  values the difference between data
and prediction becomes substantial ( 10%).
 Event transverse mass, mT . The cut performed on the event transverse mass variable is
used to select charged current Drell-Yan events; moreover, mT serves as a discriminant
between multijet background events and signal events. In Equation (7.3) the transverse
mass dependency on p
T , E
T and  is stated, therefore it is necessary that the
behaviour of these distributions is consistent with mT . Figure 10.8 displays the mT
distribution, it is peaked at mT  mW since mT is related to the W boson mass; most
of the backgrounds events are found in the low mT region, which probes consistency

10.2 Cutflows
This section contains the cutflow tables. The cutflow tables show the effect on the number
of events that each selection cut has. The cutflows were done for the data, signal MC
and background MC; moreover, the relative efficiencies are included for each selection cut.
Finally, in the last row the total efficiency is displayed, which is the ratio between the initial
number of events over the final number of events after all the selection criteria were applied.
All the numbers shown for the Monte Carlo simulations are multiplied by the luminosity
and skimming normalisations.

Results
This chapter presents the differential cross sections and the muon charge asymmetry mea-
surements. First, a general measurement strategy is discussed. Then, the choice of the
fiducial phase space with which the data will be unfolded and defines the final measured
cross sections is discussed.
11.1 Cross section strategy
The basic expression to determine W boson production cross sections, W , from recorded
events in a detector is given in the following equation,
CW  L
, (11.1)
where N and B are the number of data recorded and background estimated events respec-
tively, after applying the charged current Drell-Yan selection, CW is the unfolding correction
factor defined in Equation (11.6), and L is the data integrated luminosity.
To measure the muon charge asymmetry, As,
As =
W+  W
W+ + W
, (11.2)
is employed; where W+ is the cross section for the W
+  + production, and W is the
cross section for the W   production calculated with Equation (11.1).
CHAPTER 11. RESULTS 150
11.1.1 Binning in 
The cross section for the charged current Drell-Yan process and the muon charge asymmetry
are measured differentially in absolute muon  bins. The binning is selected by taking into
account several aspects:
 The limited statistics. Despite the fact that a copious amount of data was collected in
2017, the estimation of multijet background requires well populated bins.
 The same bin edges were used for the 7 and 8 TeV measurements. It was found useful
to be able to directly compare and in the future combine this measurement results
with those results.
 The physics sensitivity. The binning has to consider interesting physics that can be
potentially extracted with the measurement.
 The effect of having different binning, w.r.t. the one set in Equation (11.3), on the cross
sections and charge asymmetry depends on whether the bins are wider or narrower;
the former would enhance the purity and the stability (defined in Equations (11.7)
and (11.8)), nevertheless the sensitivity to interesting physics effects could be dimmed;
the later would have the opposite effect. For the present case and near future it was
decided to keep the binning established below.
The binning edges are:
|| = [0.0, 0.21, 0.42, 0.63, 0.84, 1.05, 1.37, 1.52, 1.74, 1.95, 2.18, 2.4]. (11.3)
This binning corresponds to eleven bins. Figure 11.1 shows the  distributions at truth Born
level; only truth weights, that do not consider for detector effects, are applied.
The absolute muon pseudorapidity differential versions of Equation (11.1) and Equa-
tion (11.2) read as,
d|| =
CW  L ||
, (11.4)
where || is the size of each || bin, and
d|| =
dW+/d||  dW/d||
dW+/d||+ dW/d||
. (11.5)
11.1.2 Fiducial phase space
This section contains a summary of the phase space chosen to perform the measurements.

results with theory calculations, it is important to carefully designate a phase space with
the target of minimising the systematic uncertainties coming from theory. It is convenient
to define the kinematic phase space close to the experimental acceptance to comply with the
ID and MS capabilities to minimise model-dependent corrections. Additionally, given the
triggers selected for the W   signature, a muon transverse momentum is chosen above
the lowest pT threshold trigger; likewise, the E
T is expected to roughly balance the muon
transverse momentum, hence a cut on EmissT is considered as well. Finally, the transverse
mass of the event is selected to be consistent with all the above mentioned cuts and the W
boson signature. A fiducial volume is therefore constructed with the variables , p
T , E
and mT :
 A muon acceptance of || < 2.4.
 A muon transverse momentum threshold of pT > 30 GeV.
 The magnitude of the missing energy vector cut of EmissT > 25 GeV1.
 A transverse mass cut of mT > 55 GeV.
The fiducial volume boundaries are performed on the so-called truth level Monte Carlo.
The truth level simulation refers to the event simulation without any detector constraints.
There are several truth level lepton definitions, depending on how the photons radiated by
the final state leptons are handled [72]:
 Born truth level. This level takes into account the lepton before photon emissions
(FSR).
 Bare truth level. This level considers the lepton after it has radiated photons.
 Dressed truth level. This level is an intermediate case between the Born and bare level,
i.e., after the photons have been radiated, the photons within a R < 0.1 cone are
summed to the lepton four-momentum.
This thesis analysis only considers Born truth level leptons, since Born leptons are fully
comparable particle-level objects and their measurements can be directly combined with
other experiments or in this case be able to potentially combine the muon and electron
channels. Furthermore the comparison with theory is more direct.
The use of dressed leptons is the most appropriate approach when the topology of the
final state of a measurement is complex, e.g. when the final state includes jets that could
1The asymmetric pT  EmissT selection was suggested by the theorists, see Appendix A.
CHAPTER 11. RESULTS 153
contain photons. The CCDY final state is simple containing only leptons. Nevertheless,
the majority of the final state radiation photons are collinear to the charged leptons, the
difference between observables calculated with dressed leptons is as small as . 0.1%.
It is of utmost interest to perform a measurement which does not depend on the tech-
nicalities of the Monte Carlo generator that is used. The bare leptons suffer from being
dependent on the details of the implementation of the QED, consequently combination with
other experiments become difficult. The advantage of the bare truth level is that the unfolded
results are not affected by QED radiation modelling and are closer to the raw experimental
recorded data.
It is straightforward to change to a different definition if needed.
Figure 11.2 depicts a comparison among the three different truth levels, the boson kine-
matics were constructed using the muon and neutrino2 four momenta. Accompanying the
construction of the W boson kinematics with the use of leptons, the direct boson kinematics
at Born level is shown in the plots and it is used to check and compare the different truth
levels. The lower panel in the plots presents the ratio of the direct boson kinematics over the
lepton-constructed boson kinematics; there is a perfect agreement between the direct boson
kinematics and the lepton-constructed boson kinematics at Born level; the dressed and bare
levels show discrepancies with respect to the Born level, specially at low invariant mass, this
effect is expected since photons in this regime take a larger fraction of the parents lepton
energy to be emitted. It is essential to perform this class of checks at truth level in order to
confirm that the determination of the fiducial volume is correct.
11.2 Unfolding factor, CW
The correction factor, found in the denominator of Equation (11.1) and Equation (11.4), is
used to account for detector responses, it is called the correction unfolding factor, CW , more
precisely,
N reco
N truth
, (11.6)
where N reco is the number of simulated events that satisfy the charged current Drell-Yan
selection criteria listed in Section 7.1.11, these events and their kinematic properties are
convoluted with the ATLAS detector simulation; N truth is the number of simulated events
that satisfy the fiducial phase space described in Section 11.1.2 and are generated in absence
of the ATLAS detector. The CW factor is a quantity computed exclusively from signal
2At truth level the neutrino kinematics are fully available, as opposed to the reconstruction level.

simulation.
In general, the correcting procedure for detector effects, in the final count of signal data
events, is referred to as unfolding; bin-by-bin unfolding in || bins, was performed in this
analysis, which means that an unfolding factor is computed for every bin of Equation (11.3),
these values are utilised to compute the differential cross section and asymmetry measure-
ments with Equation (11.4) and Equation (11.5).
The bin-by-bin unfolding is simple and powerful; nevertheless, its applicability is limited
by the so-called bin migration, which is characterised with the fraction of events that are
reconstructed and generated in the same bin. Therefore, it is indispensable to assure that
the bin migration is low, i.e. when the unfolding factor is close to unity. Related quantities
are used along with the CW factor to validate the bin-by-bin unfolding procedure, namely,
the purity, P, and the stability, S defined in Equation (11.7) and Equation (11.8) respec-
tively. The purity serves to establish the amount of reconstructed events that were originally
generated in a given bin,
N truthstay
N recotot
, (11.7)
where N truthstay is the number of events generated at truth level in a given bin and that are
reconstructed in the same bin and N recotot is the total number of reconstructed events in a
given bin. The stability expresses how many events abandon the bin were they generated,
N truthstay
N truthtot
, (11.8)
where N truthstay is the number of events generated at truth level in a given bin and that are
reconstructed in the same bin and N recotot is the total number of truth events in a given bin.
The purity plots found in Figure 11.3 include the reconstruction weights treated in Chap-
ter 6, the events in the numerator of Equation (11.7) are required to pass the fiducial phase
space and the reconstruction W   cuts; the events in the denominator are required to
pass the reconstruction cuts solely. In Figure 11.3 it is appreciated that the purity is close to
90% in all the || bins for the negative and positive channel. This check provides confidence
for the unfolding bin-by-bin methodology considering that bias are expected to appear when
the purity is typically below 60-70% [65].
The stability plots found in Figure 11.5 include the truth level weights, i.e. the pileup
weight, the MC generator weight, and the luminosity normalisation. The events in the
numerator of Equation (11.8) are required to pass the fiducial phase space and the recon-
struction W   cuts; the events in the denominator are required to pass the fiducial phase
space cuts solely. In Figure 11.5 it is appreciated that the stability is close or above 50% in

11.3 Uncertainty propagation
The uncertainties are propagated to the final results through the unfolding factor defined
in Chapter 11 and the number of background events B in Equation (11.1). Considering
uncorrelated errors it is found,
CW  L
, (11.9)
where , CW and B are the uncertainties associated to the cross section, the unfolding fac-
tor and the background events, respectively. Several remarks on the individual uncertainties
components are:
 Examining the definition of the unfolding factor in terms of the N reco and N truth, it is
found that CW/CW is equivalent to the values already computed in Section 9.2.
 The uncertainties in the number of background of events, include the uncertainties
already discussed for signal Monte Carlo plus the uncertainties arising from the multijet
background, see Section 9.3. The contribution of these uncertainties enter via the

second factor on the right side of Equation (11.9) and it is found to be vanishingly
small.
 The MC statistical component of the CW factor uncertainty requires special care. The
reason is the intrinsic dependence3 between N reco and N truth, consequently, to be able
to apply the standard error propagation methodology it is necessary to rewrite these
quantities in terms of independent variables, namely [73],
N recostay +N
N truthstay +N
truth
leave
, (11.10)
where N recostay is the sum of weights reconstructed and generated in the same bin, N
is the sum of weights reconstructed in a bin and generated outside the bin, N truthstay is
sum of truth weights equivalent to N recostay (without considering detector corrections),
and N truthleave is the sum of truth weights that are generated in a bin but reconstructed
outside that bin. Note that N reco  N recotot = N recostay + N recocome and N truth  N truthtot =
N truthstay + N
truth
leave . Therefore, the error propagation can be applied to Equation (11.10)
and the CW statistical uncertainty is written as,
(newstat )
(N truthtot N rectot )2
(N truthtot )
(Nstay)
(N truthtot )
(N reccome)

(11.11)
where N recostay , N

stay , N
come, N
truth
leave are the statistical errors, following a Poisson
distribution (stat =
N), corresponding to N recostay , N
truth
stay , N
come, N
truth
leave , respectively.
Equation (11.11) assumed N truthstay  N recostay , which holds for high scale factor efficiencies.
Tables 11.2 and 11.1 display the all the quantities needed to use Equation (11.11); in
these tables the difference between the calculation between the statistical uncertainties
assuming that the N reco and N truth are independent and the statistical uncertainties
utilising Equation (11.11) is found, the former shows an underestimation of these un-
certainties of about 50%. The corrected statistical uncertainties are named as newstat and
their contribution is below 0.1%.
 The uncertainty of the muon charge asymmetry of Equations (11.2) and (11.5) is
calculated assuming uncorrelated errors, employing
As =
(W + W+)
 [2W2W+ + 
]1/2, (11.12)
3Nreco and N truth are not independent since the number of reconstructed events in a given bin is a
fraction of the number of generated events in that bin.

where W,+ are the cross sections defined in Equations (11.1) and (11.4), W,+ are
the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties previously considered. The values of the
charge asymmetry uncertainties are summarised in Section 11.5.
 The data statistical uncertainty is computed in analogy with Equation (11.9) and
included in the measurements of Sections 11.5 and 11.4.

11.4 Cross sections
This section presents the cross section measurements inclusively and differentially in ||
bins for both the positive and negative charged current Drell-Yan processes.
Table 11.3 summarises the inclusive results for both the cross section and muon charge
asymmetry measurements; in this table the inclusive unfolding factors, used to compute
the results, are displayed; furthermore, the different contributions of the uncertainties are
shown and are constituted by the sum in quadrature of their corresponding components;
finally, the number of events for data, MC simulation (reconstruction and truth) and the
background number of events is presented; the numbers within the tables provide all the
needed quantities to utilise Equations (11.1) and (11.2).
The || binned results are presented in Tables 11.4 and 11.5; these tables show the
equivalent numbers of Table 11.3. Figure 11.6 exhibits graphically the cross section mea-
surements; the results found in these plots are computed using Equation (11.4). The ratio
plots in the lower panels are a comparison between the results obtained using background
subtracted data events against results using only signal MC. It is seen that the agreement
between data and prediction is good, being the worst case only few percent difference at
low muon pseudorapidity bins, for both the negative and positive charged current Drell-Yan
selections.

the muon pseudorapidity bins; the second and third columns are the data measured and
predicted asymmetry values computed with Equation (11.5); the fourth, fifth and sixth
columns show the up, down and data statistical uncertainties in percentage, respectively.
11.5 Muon charge asymmetry
This section presents the muon charge asymmetry measurement results. The inclusive result
is found in Table 11.3 along with the cross sections. The last row of this table corresponds
to the muon charge asymmetry measured inclusively with Equation (11.2); the latter uses
the cross sections and unfolding factors also found in Table 11.3. The muon charge asym-
metry uncertainties derive from the uncertainties of the cross sections, and are calculated
with Equation (11.12); the rest of the columns are empty as these numbers are already
taken into account within the quantities above mentioned. Table 11.6 contains the differen-
tial results for the charge muon asymmetry measurements; the results are calculated with
Equation (11.5); a comparison between the asymmetry determination using only MC signal
and data subtracted events, can be found; moreover, the systematic up and down, and data
statistical uncertainties are shown. Graphically, these results are established in Figure 11.7,
in the upper panel plot it is seen the asymmetry measured and compared with the simula-
tion, the errors correspond to the sum in quadrature of all the error sources treated in this
analysis; the lower panel shows a more explicit comparison between data subtracted events
and MC predictions, a good agreement is observed in most of the muon pseudorapidity bins,
the largest discrepancy ( 5%) is in few bins that cover [0.21,0.42] and [1.37,1.74] ranges.

up and down, and the luminosity uncertainty.
11.6 Summary
This section condenses the above results in Table 11.7. This table presents the cross section
and charge asymmetry measurements differentially, along with the corresponding contribu-
tion of the uncertainties to the measured value. In this table, the results are presented in
such a manner that the measured value is followed by the statistical uncertainty, the sys-
tematic up and down uncertainties and finally the systematic coming from the luminosity
measurements. This thesis results are consistent with previous results of 7 TeV and 8 TeV
muon charge asymmetry [74][65] and inclusive W cross section measurements at 13 TeV [75].
11.7 Measurement conclusions
The precision achieved with the cross section and muon charge asymmetry measurements in
this thesis is high, with an uncertainty as low as 2%; moreover, the agreement between data
and simulation is good. Given that the measurements were performed differentially in muon

pseudorapidity, which is related with the momentum fraction that a particle carries inside
the proton, these results provide the capability to further constrain the parton distribution
functions corresponding to the up and down quarks and antiquarks, which are responsible
of producing positive and negative muons via the charged Drell-Yan process.

Conclusions
The sophistication of modern accelerators and detectors has achieved an outstanding de-
velopment, allowing physicists to prove robust quantum field theories and find guidance to
construct new ones. Particularly, the successful operation of the Large Hadron Collider and
the ATLAS detector has played a major role to obtain the results presented in this thesis.
The results presented aimed to obtain a precision measurement of the charged current Drell-
Yan production cross section and muon charge asymmetry, inclusively and differentially in
muon pseudorapidity bins.
The measurements performed in this analysis have displayed a competitive precision of
2%, the reason of this are several: The calibration of the physics objects, calculated by
the ATLAS performance groups, in particular the muons seen by the detector, has an un-
precedented precision for the run2 analyses. Theory predictions made for the proton-proton
collision cross sections have been in constant improvement tracing the path to find interest-
ing physics that could be found in precision analyses. The results presented in this thesis
exhibit a good agreement (the worst case is 5% discrepancy in few bins) of the unfolded data
compared to the prediction. Consequently, the results of this thesis can be used to constrain
the protons quark parton distribution functions corresponding to the charged current Drell-
Yan production.
The measurements mentioned in Section 2.5 use quite similar phase spaces to the one
presented in this thesis. The studies performed here aim to improve the precision of the
charge asymmetry determination; in the case of the CMS result, the statistical uncertainty
is not negligible; furthermore, it is expected that the systematic uncertainties will be reduced
for the run2 analyses. The precision achieved in this thesis is comparable to the CMS and
ATLAS previous results, nevertheless the centre of mass energy permits the study of the
CHAPTER 12. CONCLUSIONS 171
PDFs in a higher x range. The results communicated in this document could be improved
by adding the full run2 data, controlling the uncertainty result of multiple proton-proton
interactions, and refining the computation of the missing energy and the multijet background.
It is worth to mention that these measurements have never been reported before in lit-
erature using 13 TeV data, therefore the results presented here are the first muon charge
asymmetry measurements using recent ATLAS 13 TeV proton-proton collision data. The
author of the thesis carried out the full analysis, therefore numerous checks and studies
were performed to evaluate the consistency of the results presented in Chapter 11; namely,
the event weights and normalisation were carefully addressed, the detector efficiencies were
also cautiously studied along with their uncertainties. Monte Carlo simulation of signal and
background events were compared against data in several kinematic variables to ensure that
the event selection criteria efficiently discriminates background from W   events, good
agreement was found in every kinematic distribution. One of the most challenging parts of
the analysis was the multijet background estimation that proved to be difficult, and special
care had to be taken to address the use of different lepton triggers; the multijet was studied
in detail along with its systematics and found to be small for the charged current Drell-Yan
selection established. The systematic uncertainties were also addressed with care and pre-
sented in Appendix C for every muon pseudorapidity bin, this provides confidence in the
procedures to study the uncertainties. Truth level studies were fundamental to guarantee
the validity of the bin-by-bin unfolding technique chosen to compute the cross section and
muon charge asymmetry. Finally, the results obtained were carefully checked and analysed,
these yield satisfactory results.
The prospects of the analysis presented here to be published in a peer reviewed journal,
are to work further on improving the systematic uncertainties to obtain a world leading
result. The work will be continued by the author and a younger PhD student. Also different
unfolding techniques and the use of different Monte Carlo simulations need to be addressed
as consistency checks to make the analysis more robust and reliable. Fitting the data results
to constrain the PDFs could be performed afterwards and be included in the same paper or
in a second one.
The charged current Drell-Yan production is a very interesting physics process. The
results of this thesis have shown to be precise enough to extract detailed information of the
proton structure. There is still an enormous amount of interesting physics that could be
extracted with this kind of measurements; for example, in recent years people have turned
CHAPTER 12. CONCLUSIONS 172
their attention to look for new physics using precision measurements. Hence, precision
measurements, in particular Drell-Yan measurements, are still young (physicists have learned
and tested the Standard Model to the highest accuracy) and have many exciting results
awaiting to be discovered.
Appendices
Appendix A
Multijet background estimation
consistency checks
This appendix contains additional information regarding the multijet estimation. Namely,
it contains in more detail how the normalisation of the multijet was determined, a break-
down of the steps is discussed. In addition, the analogue of Figures 8.5-8.9 for one muon
pseudorapidity bin are presented.
A.1 Multijet background normalisation
Chapter 8 establishes the procedure to extract the contribution of the multijet and elec-
troweak backgrounds in a multijet enriched phase space. This section provides with supple-
mentary checks that help to ensure that the procedure was performed consistently.
The results of the TFraction function are in terms of normalised distributions, i.e. the
input distributions are first normalised to unit area, and then the determination of the
fractions is carried out; therefore, it is necessary to correctly normalise the fractions using,
T = T  MJnorm,
 =  MCnorm, (A.1)
where (T ,) and (T ,) are the final and unit area normalised fractions, respectively; MJnorm
and MCnorm are data normalised number of events for the multijet and Monte Carlo back-
grounds, respectively, in the corresponding phase space. The top plots of Figure A.1 show
the unit area normalised components of the fit, where the MC and multijet components are
not scaled by T  and , moreover the normalised data distribution is displayed along with
APPENDIX A. MULTIJET BACKGROUND ESTIMATION CONSISTENCY CHECKS175
the normalised fit result; it is seen that the sum of the component samples do not describe
the data. The bottom plots of Figure A.1 make a comparison between the scaled sum of MC
and multijet backgrounds, these distributions were scaled with  and T  respectively; the
lower panel of the plot shows the ratio of data with this sum; a good agreement is found in
the high statistics bins. The last step is equivalent to consider Equation (8.1) and making
the changes T  T  and   . In Figure A.1 only the W   channel is shown,
notwithstanding, the same holds for the W+  + channel.
Figure A.2 shows the fraction fit methodology component distributions without the unit
area normalisation. The top plots enclose a comparison of the data with the MC and the
multijet background without applying the T and  scaling; the bottom plots display the
scaled sum of MC and multijet background. The lower panels in each plot are correlated
with the ratio of data against the sum of the MC and multijet in both the top and bottom
plots, a significant improvement it is seen when the scaling is applied.
Figures A.1 and A.2 help to validate the use of the T fraction to normalise the multijet
background in the signal region.
A.2 Multijet background estimation in a given ||
The plots presented in Chapter 8 correspond to the calculation of the multijet background
performed in the inclusive || bin. Nevertheless this was done for each bin of Equation (11.3),
as an example, this section contains the plots for the bin 0.00  ||  0.21 (Figures A.3-
A.7) which are the analogue to 8.5-8.9; the multijet fraction T results shown in Tables 8.2
and 8.3 where computed in every bin, therefore similar plots are available for every bin not
shown here. The vertical axes in the plots were intentionally set with the same range as in
the inclusive case, in order to appreciate the difference in statistics when considering only
one muon pseudorapidity bin.

Appendix B
First steps to calculate the theory
uncertainties
As briefly discussed in Section 9.4, the theory uncertainties are very small; nevertheless,
these uncertainties are not zero and their calculation requires extra steps with respect to
the experimental uncertainties since they affect both the reconstruction and truth levels.
This appendix presents the source of the theory uncertainties and the first steps to calculate
their propagation, through the CW unfolding factor, to the cross section and muon charge
asymmetry measurements.
B.1 Theory uncertainties contributions
The theory uncertainties enter via the kFactor correction defined in Equation (5.1), this
definition assumes that the high order corrections to the cross section are factorised into
QCD and electroweak contributions. Therefore, the uncertainties that appear in the kFactor
corrections are also factorised to cover the QCD and electroweak contributions.
The theory uncertainties from the QCD correction are summarised as follows:
 The variation of s1 by 0.0003. This uncertainty is named as ALPHAS.
 The renormalisation R and factorisation F scales are simultaneously varied up and
down by a factor of two at each invariant mass point. This uncertainty is called
SCALE W.
 An uncertainty arising from the beam energy plugged in the calculation of the cross
section is considered and referred to as BEAM ENERGY.
1The running QCD coupling s is identified with gs established in Equation (2.19).
APPENDIX B. FIRST STEPS TO CALCULATE THE THEORY UNCERTAINTIES 184
 The nominal PDF set uncertainties are evaluated using the standard prescription for
Hessian PDF sets using a 90% confidence level eigenvector fluctuation; this uncertainty
is referred to as PDF.
 A PDF choice uncertainty associated to the HERAPDF2.0 and NNPDF3.0 PDF sets
is considered. These are named as CHOICE HERAPDF2.0 and CHOICE NNPDF3.0.
 The CT14 PDF eigenvectors are bundled into seven bundles with similar mass depen-
dency; this helps preventing an overconstrain in the high mass PDF uncertainty, the
bundles are named as PDF V1,2,3,4,5,6,7.
The theory uncertainties from the electroweak corrections are applied in an additive way.
The systematic uncertainty on these corrections is calculated by comparing the nominal
kFactor with corrections using a factorisation approach. These uncertainties cover higher
effects in QED not considered by the MC generator, i.e. initial state radiation, interference
among initial and final state radiation, and Sudakov logarithm single-loop corrections.
B.2 Theory uncertainties: reconstruction level
The theory variations at reconstructed level are calculated with Equation (9.1). The uncer-
tainties in each pseudorapidity bin, displayed in Figure B.1, adopt the symmetric definition
of Equation (9.5).
B.3 Theory uncertainties: next steps
To complete the calculation of the theory uncertainties is necessary to obtain their effect at
truth level; furthermore, including the theory uncertainties to the measurements, a propa-
gation of error is needed. The methodology to carry out this, should be closely related to
the propagation of experimental uncertainties described in Section 11.3, nevertheless special
care needs to be taken to cope with the dependence in both the numerator and denominator
of the unfolding factor: it is expected that the theoretical uncertainties are largely cancelled
trough this ratio, therefore a correlation study needs to be performed to complement the
propagation. The total uncertainty should be the sum in quadrature of the experimental
and theoretical uncertainties. These steps are not covered in this thesis and were left for
continuing work.

2.1 Feynman diagram of the partonic W production process. The quark and
antiquark are assumed to come from the colliding protons. The W bosons
have leptonic and hadronic decay modes. The former corresponds to a charged
lepton and a neutral lepton in the final state, W  l, where l represents
either a electron, a muon or a tau (in this work only the decay to muons is
considered); the hadronic decay modes are W  +, W  D+s , W  cX,
W  cs, where + is a pi meson,  is a photon, D+s is a d meson, c is a charm
quark, s is a strange quark and X is a inclusive final state. Finally the W
boson could decay into a charged particle with momentum below experimental
detectability (< 200 MeV). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26

6.2 Tag and probe method diagram. In the diagram a Z boson is produced
by any mechanism, and the decay products are restricted to be one muon
and its antiparticle. In Section 4.2.2 a detailed description of the method is
given using electrons; the same remarks apply for muons: one muon is tagged
(tag muon, here in the diagram referred to as tag) with tight identification
selections, the di-muon system invariant mass is required to be consistent with
the Z boson invariant mass, finally a loose selection is applied to the second
muon (probe muon, here in the diagram referred to as probe). Then the probe
muons are used to calculate the efficiency of a specific selection criterion. . . 85

uncertainties [53]. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 86
