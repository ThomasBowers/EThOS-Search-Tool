Search for Supersymmetry in final states with three leptons and
missing transverse energy with the ATLAS detector
at the Large Hadron Collider
Summary
The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider has collected an unprecedented
amount of data in the 3 years of data taking since its start. In this document I will dis-
cuss the results of the analysis I performed during my PhD at the university of Sussex
for the search of Supersymmetry in events with three leptons (electron/muon/tau) and
missing transverse energy in the final state. The search is performed on the full dataset
collected by the experiment in 2012, at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. These results are
interpreted in SUSY models with chargino-neutralino pair production via decays involving
sleptons, staus, gauge bosons and the newly discovered Higgs boson. These results presen-
ted improve on previous searches performed at ATLAS in three lepton final states with
only electrons and muons. Special focus will be given to the optimisation process of Su-
persymmetry signal with respect to the SM background, and the statistical interpretation
of the results obtained with this search.
Acknowledgements
I would like to take this space to acknowledge all the wonderful people who supported me
throughout this PhD journey which would not have been possible without the financial
help of my sponsor: the Mexican science and technology council, CONACYT.
First and foremost, Id like to thank my supervisor, Fabrizio Salvatore, whose friendly
guidance has been invaluable during these past four years. Thanks to Antonella De Santo
for giving me the opportunity to join their lovely Sussex group. Tina Potter, a person who
I learnt the most from and was a true pleasure to work with, thank you for the stimulating
conversations and the above and beyond help. My Sussex colleagues and friends in chrono-
logical order: Anthony Rose and Stewart Martin-Haugh, thanks for introducing me to the
bits and pieces of the SUSY world and putting up with all my questions at all times; Zara
Grout, who has always been a really good friend and a great work buddy; Yusufu, Dan,
James, Ed for giving the office a very friendly, funny and pleasant atmosphere. Thanks
to the trileptoners: Zoltan, Steve, Lukas and the amazing Basil Schneider, who I worked

work trips more fun: Emma, Brett, Nadja, Olivier, Brokk, Dennis and Devin.
I would also like to thank my amazing parents, Elizabeth and Socrates, for their
enormous support and encouragement to become the best person I could be. My two
great sisters, who are my original life role models. My dear friends: Nina, you gave me
courage and strength when I most needed it, and of course, the never ending jokes, you
personify the word friend my friend; Noor, you are always looking out for me and Im
so lucky to have you as one of my Best friends; Antonio and Luca, my oldest friends at
Sussex who made the UK a great place to live in; Yolis and Alma, my life-long friends;

Introduction
This document summarises the work done during the four years of my PhD at the Uni-
versity of Sussex as part of the ATLAS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider. The
analysis presented in this thesis describes the search for Supersymmetry in events with
three leptons and missing transverse energy in the final state using the ATLAS detector.
Firstly, the theoretical background is reviewed in Chapter 2, which describes the features
of the Standard Model of particle physics as well as its shortcomings, which motivate the
need for an extended theory such as Supersymmetry. Chapter 3 focuses on introducing
the experimental setup used for these searches: the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron
Collider. Chapters 4-6 give an overview of the tools used in the analysis presented in this
thesis, from MC-simulated and real data, to the algorithms used for particle reconstruc-
tion and identification. Chapter 7 provides a description of the SUSY trilepton analysis,
focusing on my personal contribution. Chapter 8 shows the results of this analysis and
Chapter 9 provides some concluding remarks. A brief description on the service work done
for the ATLAS experiment during the qualification period is also provided in Appendix B.
This analysis has been published in a refereed paper [1] in April 2014.

Theoretical Introduction
It doesnt matter how beautiful
your theory is, it doesnt matter
how smart you are. If it doesnt
agree with experiment, its
wrong.
Richard P. Feynman
The Standard Model (SM) theory aims to provide a general description of funda-
mental particles and the way they interact in nature. However, there are several known
unknowns that are not addressed by this theory.
This chapter gives a brief overview of the most successful theory in particle physics, the
Standard Model, as well as some of its limitations which motivate the need for an extended
description. Many theoretical extensions of the Standard Model have been formulated to
cover such limitations, one of the most popular being Supersymmetry.
2.1 The Standard Model
The Standard Model of particle physics [2, 3, 4] is a remarkable theory which can explain
most of the current experimental observations as well as some cosmological phenomena in
the early universe. It summarises the current knowledge of the fundamental particles and
their interactions in terms of three forces: the electromagnetic, weak and strong (gravity
is not considered). It is based on a relativistic Quantum Field Theory (QFT) [5], where
particles are treated as fields. This section focuses on the description of the field content
of the SM, the interactions compatible with that content and the limitations they imply.
2.1.1 Overview
Elementary particles are generally distinguished by mass eigenstates and quantum num-
bers. Based on the spin quantum numbers, the elementary particles described within the
SM are divided into two types: fermions and bosons, with corresponding spin quantum
numbers of half-integer and integer, respectively.
Fermions
Fermions are subdivided into: six quarks, also referred to as colour triplets due to the
fact that they carry one of three so-called colour charges (red, green or blue); and six
leptons, three of them electrically neutral, known as neutrinos. Tables 2.1- 2.2 show the
categorisation of quarks and leptons, respectively, along with a few of their fundamental
properties. Leptons and quarks are organised in three generations each containing one
charged lepton, one neutrino, and one up- and down-type quarks. The masses of fermions
increase with each generation. The generations are grouped according to their left- and
right-handed chirality states, this due to the chiral nature of the theory discussed in Sec-
tion 2.1.1. Chirality is an non-physical concept closely related to handedness (defined as
the projection of the spin of a particle onto its direction of motion), which is equivalent
in the case of massless particles. Neutrinos are the only fermionic fields which are as-
sumed massless in the SM and can therefore be considered as either left- or right-handed.
Each fermion has an associated antiparticle with all the same quantum numbers but one
(two in case of quarks), which is inverted: this is the charge in case of charged leptons,
handedness in case of neutrinos, and charge as well as colour in case of quarks.

Forces
Each force in the SM is described by a gauge theory, where the interactions are mediated
by gauge fields of the corresponding local symmetry group. All fermions can interact via
the weak and electromagnetic forces; additionally quarks can also interact via the strong
force. These interactions arise from the exchange of gauge bosons. Table 2.3 summarises
the three forces described in the SM, the mass and charge properties of their corresponding
mediating particle(s) (gauge bosons).
Table 2.3: Gauge Bosons in the Standard Model.
Force Name Symbol Mass [GeV] Charge [e]
Electromagnetic Photon  0 0
W W 80.398 1
Z Z 91.188 0
Strong Gluons g 0 0
The theory that describes the electromagnetic interactions is the Quantum ElectroDynam-
ics (QED) [6], where the force carrier is the electrically neutral and massless photon, which
couples to all charged particles. The strong force, mediated by the exchange of the electric-
ally neutral, coloured and massless gluons, is described by the Quantum ChromoDynamics
(QCD) gauge field theory [7]. The weak force is mediated by the heavy Z and W bosons.
The gravitational force, with the Graviton as mediator, is not included in Table 2.3, as it
is not a part of the SM description.
The electromagnetic and weak forces are described by one unified gauge theory, known
as the electroweak theory [8]. It is believed [9] that at very high energies ( 1016 GeV)
the strong and electroweak forces are unified into one force, which may be described by a
Grand Unified Theory (GUT).
Gauge Groups in the SM
In gauge field theory, an interaction can be described by the invariance of fermion fields
under a transformation, TX , where the quantity X is conserved [10].
The SM force interactions can be mathematically described by the local gauge sym-
metry group presented in Equation 2.1.
SU(3)C  SU(2)L  U(1)Y , (2.1)
where the indices: C denotes colour charge; L denotes left-handedness; and Y denotes
weak-hypercharge, a variable used to assess the correlation between the electric charge
(Q) and the third component of the weak isospin (I3), defined as Q = I3 +
, where I3 is
equal to 1/2 for left-handed particles and 0 for right-handed particles.
The SU(3)C gauge group [11] describes the strong interactions (using QCD) acting
on coloured fermion fields. This is a non-Abelian group, meaning that not all the group
elements commute, where self-interaction terms are allowed, i.e. gluons may couple to
themselves. The specific gauge bosons associated to the algebra of the SU(3)C group are
eight massless gluons, denoted as G
=1,...8.
 , which mediate the interactions. Quark fields
are treated as colour triplets (three component field) under the SU(3)C symmetry, gluons
are colour octets and the rest of the gauge bosons and leptons are colour singlets (colourless
particles). Another property of the SU(3)C group symmetry is that it acts in the same
way for left- and right-handed particles, and it is therefore considered a non-chiral gauge
group.
The weak interactions [6] are represented by the massless SU(2)L [2] gauge fields,
=1,2,3.
 . These massless gauge fields violate parity by acting only on left-handed com-
ponents of the fermion fields, and therefore left-handed particles are treated as doublets
and right-handed particles as singlets. SU(2)L is also a non-Abelian symmetry group,
hence, the weak gauge bosons may couple to each other.
QED is based on the Abelian symmetry group is U(1)Q [2], which is used to describe
the electromagnetic force, where the interaction is between charged fermions and the
massless photon. Since it acts on left- and right-handed particles with different strength,
it is considered a chiral gauge group.
The ElectroWeaK (EWK) sector corresponds to the SU(2)L  U(1)Y term in Equa-
tion 2.1, where the gauge field associated to the U(1)Y symmetry is identified by B
The four non-physical bosons, W
=1,2,3.
 and B
, associated with the SU(2)L, U(1)Y
symmetries and with corresponding gauge coupling constants g and g, respectively, are
related to the physical bosons that mediate the electroweak interactions: W, Z and .
The electroweak mixing for gauge bosons (field mixing) is expressed as:
W =
(W 1  iW
) (2.2)
Z = B
cos(W ) +W
sin(W ) (2.3)
A = B0sin(W ) +W
cos(W ) (2.4)
where W is the experimentally determined weak mixing angle defined as a ratio of the
electroweak coupling constants g and g (tanW = g
/g) and A is the associated photon
field.
Electroweak Symmetry Breaking
The SM can be described by the invariance of massless fermion fields under SU(3)C 
SU(2)LU(1)Y transformations, where all the gauge bosons responsible for mediating the
forces are considered massless. This is not a problem for the gluon and photon, which me-
diate long range forces and must be massless. However, it is known from experiments [12]
that three of the gauge bosons, W and Z, have mass, as do the charged leptons and
quarks. In order for the SM assumptions to be valid, the electroweak sector symmetry
must be broken.
Equation 2.5 defines the Standard Model Lagrangian as the sum of the Lagrangians
describing the action of each force in the SM, the interactions and masses of all elementary
particles in nature:
LSM = LQCD + LEWK + LMass, (2.5)
If mass terms (LMass) are inserted by hand into the SM Lagrangian, this would break
the gauge invariance of the SM theory, which also leads to divergences and thus, a non-
renormalisable theory. The Higgs mechanism [13] overcomes this problem by introducing
a scalar field, known as the Higgs field, which couples to massive fermionic and bosonic
particles. A complex scalar field (two degrees of freedom) can be generally written as
1 + i2
, (2.6)
with a description provided by a Lagrangian density,
L = ()() V (), (2.7)
and an associated potential,
V () = 2||2 + ||4. (2.8)
If the  and  constants in Equation 2.8 are assumed to be real, the V () potential
has the shape shown in Figure 2.1. The ground state (minimum) of this potential, the
so-called Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) of the Higgs field, is a circle in the complex
plane of radius |0|, which is non-zero (|0| =
= ). In order to generate masses,
the gauge symmetry must be broken in a way that preserves the global Lagrangian sym-
metry at the same time, in order to guarantee a renormalisable theory. This dilemma
can be solved by Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB), a mechanism where there
is a symmetric Lagrangian, but not a symmetric VEV. For example if a Lagrangian in-
variant under a generic transformation, G, has a degenerate set of states with minimal
energy that transform under G as the members of a given multiplet, and if one of those
states is arbitrarily selected as the ground state of the system, the symmetry is said to be
spontaneously broken.
Figure 2.1: Visualisation of the Higgs potential, so called Mexican hat in the complex
(1, 2) plane [14]. The lowest-energy state is described by a randomly chosen point
around the bottom of the hat.
The VEV of the Higgs field is not invariant under gauge transformations and so spon-
taneously breaks the gauge symmetry, which means that the symmetry is preserved in
the model but not on the ground state of the vacuum. The Lagrangian in equation 2.7
is expanded around the selected minimum in order to obtain the equations of motion in
terms of new fields which have a zero VEV,  and :
(x) =
 + (x) + i(x)
. (2.9)
The expanded Lagrangian becomes
()(
()()
m2 + const+O(, ). (2.10)
This equation shows that only one of the two fields, , contains mass and the other
one, , is massless. The higher-order terms in  and  represent the field interactions. If
the same reasoning is applied to a doublet of complex scalar field (four degrees of freedom)
then it is possible to generate all the necessary masses for the gauge bosons. Three out of
the four degrees of freedom will generate masses for the W, Z bosons, the fourth degree
of freedom generates the mass for a real neutral scalar field, the Higgs boson. The photon
does not pick up such mass terms in the Lagrangian, hence remaining massless.
This mechanism gives mass to the gauge bosons without violating gauge symmetry.
The weak gauge bosons and fermions acquire mass by interacting with the Higgs field, and
the mass generated is proportional to the strength of their coupling with the Higgs boson.
In particular, fermions can acquire mass through Yukawa couplings [15] to the Higgs field,
where the coupling constant and thus the mass can be different for each particle.
The observed differences in the masses of fermions across generations and bosons are
not explained by the SM, these unknown features can be parametrised by the SM Lag-
rangian implying that they are to be considered as free parameters in the SM theory.
There are 19 free parameters in the SM, including the masses for all charged fermions,
mixing parameters, coupling constants, the Z boson mass, and the mass of the Higgs
boson, which has been a main subject of study for many experiments.
In 2012, searches at the LHC showed evidence for the discovery of a new particle whose
mass was consistent with the SM Higgs (125 GeV) [16, 17]. The following year, studies
from the ATLAS and CMS experiments confirmed that this particle is consistent with the
SM Higgs (some of the latest results can be found in [18, 19]), completing the SM particle
content description.
2.1.2 Shortcomings of The Standard Model
Experimental results on the measurements of several of the parameters in the SM have
demonstrated the goodness of this model [20]. In Figure 2.2 the measurement of the
production cross section of several processes is compared to the SM prediction, showing a
very good agreement between the two.
Despite the experimental success of SM theory, many fundamental questions remain
unanswered, some of them associated with the adhoc tuning of its free parameters (also
known as fine-tuning [21]) and others associated to unexplained observational facts.
This section briefly describes some of these limitations.
Figure 2.2: Summary of several Standard Model total production cross section measure-
ments at ATLAS, compared to the corresponding theoretical expectations. All theoretical
expectations were calculated at NLO or higher. The W and Z vector-boson inclusive
cross sections were measured at ATLAS with 35 pb1 of integrated luminosity from the
2010 dataset. All other measurements were performed using the 2011 or 2012 ATLAS
dataset [20].
Hierarchy Problem
The mass of the Higgs, m2H , receives extremely large quantum corrections [22] from the
coupling of every particle to the Higgs field. If the Higgs couples to a fermion (scalar)
field, , f (S), with mass mf (mS), then this introduces a term in the Lagrangian of the
form fHff (SHSS). The diagrams shown in Figure 2.3 illustrate the coupling (loop
diagram) of a Higgs boson to a fermion (a) and scalar (b) field.

(b)(a)

2UV + . . . (2.11)
m2H = 
|S |2
[2UV  2m
S ln(UV /mS) + . . . ], (2.12)
where 2UV is an ultraviolet momentum cut-off used to regulate the loop integral. If 
is of the order of the Planck scale, then the quantum correction to m2H is around 30
orders of magnitude larger than the value of the mass of the Higgs boson associated with
electroweak symmetry breaking scale ( (100 GeV)2). In other words, the mass of the
Higgs will not be at the electroweak scale but much more massive. Given that all fermions
and electroweak bosons in the SM obtain masses from the Higgs expectation value (H),
the entire mass spectrum of the Standard Model will be sensitive to this cut-off scale,
2UV .
Dark Matter
Dark matter is a form of matter that cannot be observed directly, but whose existence can
be inferred from gravitational effects on matter that is visible, such as the rotation curve
of galaxies (rotational velocity as function of the distance from the centre of the galaxy).
Latest cosmological observations [23] suggest that this new kind of matter makes up about
27% of the energy density of the universe. Very little is known about the remaining 68%
fraction of the universe, called dark energy. Candidate particles for dark matter include
the so-called Weakly-Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). These hypothetical neutral
particles only participate in the gravitational and weak interactions and thus are extremely
difficult to detect. Neutrinos are the only WIMP-like particles within the Standard Model
field content. However, they are not massive and abundant enough to account for dark
matter, which means that the particle content within the SM fails to provide a dark matter
candidate.
Given all the experimental work in the last 4 decades, it becomes clear that the SM
provides a rather incomplete description of nature, which only works at the electroweak
energy scale. Physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) aims to fill the gaps of the SM
and by doing so, reduces the number of free parameters in the SM theory, which are to be
determined experimentally. One approach of BSM theories is to consider the same funda-
mental fields but with new interactions, covered by theories such as supersymmetry [24].
Supersymmetry is one of the favoured BSM theory candidates, which by introducing a
new symmetry manages to solve the hierarchy problem, provide a dark matter candidate
(more on Section 2.2.2) and provide new spectrum of particles that can enable exploring
physics beyond the electroweak scale. SUperSYmmetry (SUSY) is the main focus of the
search discussed in this thesis.
2.2 Supersymmetry
Supersymmetry introduces a new symmetry that relates scalar fields to fermionic fields,
and in doing so, prevents large radiative corrections to the Higgs mass. Each SM particle
will have an associated superpartner (known also as sparticles) which differs in spin by
The SUSY algebra is generated with operators Q that transform a fermionic state into
a bosonic one, and vice versa
Q|Fermion = |Boson (2.13)
Q|Boson = |Fermion. (2.14)
If supersymmetry was an exact symmetry of nature, then SM particles and their su-
perpartners would have the same quantum numbers, thus the same mass. However, super-
partners are yet to be observed, therefore, supersymmetry must be a broken symmetry.
The SUSY breaking must occur in such a way that the sparticles are not too heavy to avoid
re-introducing the hierarchy problem and still manage to solve the shortcomings within
the Standard Model. This can be achieved with the soft SUSY breaking mechanism [25].
This form of SUSY breaking imposes constrains on the masses of all superpartners and
sets them to a phenomenologically suitable range.
As seen in Section 2.1.2, the SM introduces radiative corrections to the Higgs boson
mass squared due to its coupling to scalar and fermionic fields. Comparing the correction
terms for the Higgs mass due to its coupling to a fermionic and bosonic field (Equa-
tions 2.11 and 2.12) strongly suggests that if there is a symmetry that can relate fermions
and bosons with 2f = 2m
2 = S [26], then the quadratic divergences of the Higgs
mass term cancel each other out. If this new symmetry exists, it can naturally solve the
hierarchy problem.
2.2.1 Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
A Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the SM (MSSM) [27] is defined so that it contains
all the SM particles described in Section 2.1 as well as their corresponding superpartners,
and by so, effectively doubling the particle content in the theory. The MSSM particle
content is listed in Table 2.4.

The spin-0 superpartners of the quarks and leptons are called squarks (q) and sleptons
(), short for scalar quark and scalar lepton, respectively, and are also collectively
known as sfermions (f). In the case of bosonic fields, each of the vector bosons and the
SM Higgs have a fermionic superpartners which are jointly referred to as gauginos and
higgsino (Hu and Hd), respectively. There are two complex Higgs doublets Hu = (H
u , H
and Hd = (H
d , H
d ) rather than just one as in the Standard Model, with a u and d as
their respective VEVs, where both of these values are constrained by the SM Higgs VEV
as  =
2u + 
After electroweak symmetry breaking, the two Higgs doublets generate eight degrees of
freedom: three for neutral Higgs bosons (h0, the one with the lightest mass, H0 and A0),
two for charged Higgs bosons (H) and the rest to give mass to the Z and W bosons of
the SM. The higgsinos and electroweak gauginos (the so called wino, W, and bino, B0)
mix with each other because of the effects of electroweak symmetry breaking, resulting in
four neutralinos (01,2,3,4) and four charginos (
1,2). The mixing of these gauginos is given
by Equations 2.15-2.16.

where the parameters M1,M2,M3 refer to the gaugino masses;  refers to the higgsino
mass;  is defined as a ratio of the electroweak coupling constants g and g and W is
defined as the ratio of the VEVs of the two Higgs doublet fields; and the mZ(mW ) are
the masses of the W (Z) boson. Charginos are linear combinations of the charged winos
and higgsinos, while the neutralinos are linear combinations of the neutral wino, bino
and higgsinos. Therefore, each neutralino and chargino will have a different composition
(bino-like, wino-like or higgsino-like) that determines the way in which they decay.
In the MSSM, the soft SUSY-breaking terms [22] introduce a large number of unknown
parameters ( 100) in addition to the 19 free parameters of the SM, which makes any
phenomenological analysis extremely complicated. There are several complementary su-
persymmetric models within the MSSM framework which are mainly defined to reduce
the number of free parameters in the MSSM: the so-called simplified models [29], which
significantly reduce the number of parameters to only the masses of the particles that are
relevant for a particular SUSY process of study, by setting all other masses to experi-
mentally inaccessible values; and the phenomenological MSSM [30], which uses existing
experimental data and conservative phenomenological assumptions to constrain the val-
ues for the mass parameters. A subset of these parameters is listed in Table 2.5, which
contains: the gaugino masses (M1,M2,M3); the Higgs mass parameters (m
,m2H2); and
the ratio of the Higgs VEVs related to the mass of the Z boson and the electroweak gauge
couplings (g and g)

SUSY Models
There are very powerful constraints on the production of strongly interacting SUSY
particles (squarks and gluinos) [31], and depending on the mechanism of SUSY break-
ing, it could be that these strongly interacting squarks and gluinos are too massive to
be produced at the LHC. This motivates a separate consideration for electroweak SUSY
particle production, i.e. direct production of colourless particles. The pair production
cross section as a function of mass for the EWK processes: ee, e e, 
1 and 
2g, is
shown in Figure 2.4.
One of the most promising ways to discover EWK SUSY production at the LHC is
through the detection of events with multiple charged leptons in the final state. Partic-
ularly, charginos and neutralinos can produce sleptons, gauge bosons or Higgs bosons as
an intermediate particle in their decays into charged leptons, as shown in Figures 2.5-2.6.
Charged sleptons may also be produced directly if they are sufficiently light. Chargino
(or sleptons) decays can have one charged lepton in the final state and neutralino decays
can have two charged leptons in the final state, which combined yield three leptons in the
final state. It is for this reason that the EWK SUSY production mode of charginos and
neutralinos, mediated by electroweak interactions is explored in this analysis.

2.2.2 R-Parity SUSY
Some terms in the unconstrained MSSM Lagrangian can lead to a violation of the baryon
and lepton symmetries, unlike in the SM, where this was an accidental symmetry. A way
to avoid these terms is to impose a discrete symmetry on the MSSM, under which all SM
fields are even and all superpartners are odd. This symmetry is referred to as R-parity [33],
and can be defined as a multiplicatively conserved quantum number
R = (1)3(BL)+2s, (2.19)
where B,L, s correspond the baryon, lepton and spin quantum numbers, respectively.
If the theory is R-parity conserving, SM particles have R = 1 and sparticles have R =
1. If R-parity conservation is imposed on MSSM models, the mixing between particles
and sparticles is not allowed and at every interaction vertex the number of sparticles must
be even. This has the effect that the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) is stable
and all other heavier sparticles can decay only to odd numbers of it and that all sparticles
must be produced in pairs.
Dark Matter
In R-Parity conserving SUSY models, the LSP is stable and can be neutral and weakly
interacting, therefore, fulfilling all features of a WIMP, which makes for a possible dark
matter candidate. The fact that the LSP is weakly interacting means that it will appear
as missing energy at the LHC.
In the analysis presented in this thesis, only R-parity conserving SUSY models are
considered, where the lightest neutralino (01) is considered as the LSP.
2.2.3 Simplified Supersymmetric Models
A simplistic approach for SUSY breaking models is to focus on one or more SUSY produc-
tion processes and their decay chain, which has the advantage of considering the minimal
particle content necessary to reproduce such events. This approach is referred to as a
simplified model.
Figure 2.7 shows a schematic representation of a simplified model process, where the
red arrows highlight the decay chain of interest, in this case is qq  W  1 
decaying into LSP with 100% branching ratio, where the out of all the allowed SUSY
decays.
Figure 2.7: SUSY production process, with a simplified model decay chain highlighted by
the red arrows.
Only simplified models for the associated production of the lightest chargino (1 ) and
the second-lightest neutralino (02) are considered in this analysis, which are amongst some
of the electroweak gaugino (also referred to as electroweakino) pair-production processes
that can lead to three leptons and missing transverse energy in the final state. In most
of the MSSM parameter space 1 
2 production has a higher cross section with respect
to other EWK pair production modes such as which can lead to three leptons in the final
state. The masses of the relevant particles in the decay chain are the only free parameters
in these models. The following assumptions are made on the simplified models considered
in this analysis: the 1 and 
2 consist purely of the wino component and are degenerate
in mass; the 01 consists purely of the bino component; and in all cases, the squark and
gluino masses are set as as high as a few hundreds of TeV.
The different scenarios for the decay of 1 and 
2 are classified according to the
particles (or sparticles) participating in an intermediate step of the decay chain. Four
simplified models are explored in the analysis discussed in this thesis and are described in
the following.
Simplified Models with Three Lepton Final States via Sleptons
In this simplified model scenario, the left-handed charged sleptons and sneutrinos are
assumed to be light, whereas the right-handed charged sleptons are considered to be very
heavy. Thus, the wino-like chargino and neutralino will dominantly decay through left-
handed charged sleptons or sneutrinos as shown in the diagram in Figure 2.8. For these
models, the masses of 1 , 
2, lL, , 
1 are the free parameters. Degeneracy of mL,
various flavours is assumed for simplicity, these are set such that m
= (m01
+ m02
Both the branching ratio of the 1 into ` and the branching ratio into
L are set equal
to 50%. Also, both the branching ratio of the 02 into `
L and the branching ratio into 
are set equal to 50%.

1 
2 studied in this analysis. The symbols

Simplified Models with Three Lepton Final States via WZ
In the second simplified model scenario, all sleptons and sneutrinos are assumed to be
heavy, and the 1 and 
2 decay via W
() and Z() bosons, respectively, with a branching
fraction of 100%, leading to three leptons and missing transverse energy in the final state.
The decay chain for this process is shown in the diagram in Figure 2.9.

2 studied in this analysis. The symbols ` refer to e// .
Simplified Models with three lepton final states via staus
In the third simplified model considered for this analysis, the first- and second-generation
sleptons and sneutrinos are assumed to be heavy, so that the 1 and 
2 can decay into
tau leptons with a 50% branching fraction via  or  with degenerate masses m = m =
(m01
+m02
)/2. For these models, the masses of 1 , 
2, L,  , 
1 are the free parameters.
The diagram representing the decay chain for this model is shown in Figure 2.10.
Figure 2.10: Diagram for the L-mediated simplified models of the direct production of
1 
2 studied in this analysis.
Simplified Models with Three Lepton Final States via Wh
In the final simplified model scenario considered in this analysis, all sleptons and sneutrinos
are assumed to be heavy, and the wino-like 1 and 
2 decay via W and lightest Higgs
boson (h), respectively, with a branching fraction of 100%. The Higgs boson considered
in this model is SM-like, meaning it has a mass of 125 GeV and decays into other SM
particles with SM branching ratios.
The decay chain is shown on the diagram in Figure 2.11.

2 studied in this analysis. The dots in the figure depict possible additional decay
products of the lightest Higgs boson decaying via intermediate  , WW or ZZ states.

2.2.4 Phenomenological MSSM
The phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM) [30] is defined by making the following assump-
tions on the phenomenology of the free parameters of the MSSM theory: all the soft SUSY-
breaking parameters are real and therefore there is no new source of CP-violation [34]
generated; the matrices for the sfermion masses and for the tri-linear couplings are all di-
agonal (no flavour changing neutral currents at tree level); the soft SUSY-breaking masses
and tri-linear couplings of the first- and second-generation sfermions are the same at low
energy. Making these three assumptions will lead to the free parameters summarised in
Table 2.5.
The Electroweak Sector
The electroweak sector within the pMSSM is mainly characterised by the following para-
meters [27]: the U(1) gaugino (bino) mass parameter, M1; the SU(2) gaugino (wino) mass
parameter, M2; the higgsino mass parameter, ; and the ratio of the VEVs of the two
Higgs doublets, denoted as tan in Table 2.5.
In the scenarios explored for this analysis, the pMSSM parameters are tuned in such
a way that direct electroweak production is the dominant SUSY process. This is achieved
by setting the masses of the coloured sparticles (gluinos and squarks), the CP-odd Higgs
boson (mA0), and the left-handed sleptons to high values at the TeV scale. The lightest
Higgs mass is given by mh = mZcos
22 + t2, where t is a loop contribution from top
quarks and stop squarks. Therefore, the mass of the SM-like Higgs can be tuned to
125 GeV (consistent with the mass of the observed Higgs boson [16, 17]) using mixing in
the stop sector.
Figure 2.12 shows the mass hierarchy of the electroweakinos in three different MSSM
scenarios, which are governed by tan, the gaugino mass parameters M1 and M2, and the
higgsino mass parameter .

For instance, if M1<M2<, case shown in Figure 2.12(a), the corresponding compos-
ition of the 01 is driven by M1 (bino-like) and the composition of 
1 and 
2 is driven by
M2 (wino-like). In this case, the dominant electroweakino production process with three
leptons in the final state is pp  1 
2. For cases shown in Figure 2.12(b)-(c), searches
with three leptons in the final states offer less sensitivity than in case (a) because of the
mass difference between 1 and 
The pMSSM scenarios described in the following paragraphs are parametrised in the
M2 phase space and classified into three groups based on the masses of the right-handed
sleptons.
pMSSM R
In this scenario, the right-handed sleptons (eR, R, R) are degenerate in mass with a
value set at midpoint between the LSP and next-to-lightest neutralino masses: m
(m01
+ m02
)/2. Setting the parameter tan = 6 yields comparable 02 branching ratios
into each slepton generation.
There are many different EWK production modes available for this model, the dom-
inant ones are shown in Figure 2.13, where process (a) has the highest cross section out
of all the production modes that can lead to three-lepton final states, although, in some
areas of the parameter space, sub-processes involving heavier sparticles can be important.
The 1 decays predominantly via a W boson when kinematically allowed and to 
otherwise. The 02 decays occur via
 , 01h or   .
To probe the sensitivity for different 01 compositions, three values ofM1 are considered:
100 GeV (bino-like), 140 GeV (bino- and wino- like) and 250 GeV (higgsino-like).

In the next pMSSM scenario, the selectrons and smuons are heavy, the R mass is set to

Chapter 3
The ATLAS detector at the LHC
This chapter provides an overview of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Col-
lider. The Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator is introduced in Section 3.1, followed
by a detailed description of the various components of the ATLAS detector. Finally, a
description of the trigger system used by ATLAS to cope with the high LHC event rate is
discussed in Section 3.3.
3.1 The Large Hadron Collider
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [35] is the largest particle accelerator ever built, achiev-
ing the highest energies in proton-proton, lead-proton and lead-lead collisions yet. Situated
100 m underground inside the tunnel previously occupied by the Large Electron Positron
Collider (LEP) [36], the LHC consists of a 27 km ring of superconducting magnets and
accelerating elements, which support same-charge hadron beams circulating in opposite
directions. These beams are forced to collide at four specific points around the ring as
shown in Figure 3.1. In these points are located the experiments: LHCb [37], ALICE [38],
ATLAS [39] and CMS [40].
The LHC magnetic system consists of 1232 superconducting dipole and 392 quadrupole
magnets, with an average magnetic field of 8.3 T which are kept at a temperature of 1.7 k.
The purpose of the dipole magnets is to bend the beam and keep it in circular motion while
the purpose for the quadrupole magnets (and a few higher-moment magnets) is to keep
the beam focused as it gets accelerated around the ring. There are two transfer tunnels
(each around 2.5 km long) which connect the LHC to the rest of the CERN accelerator
complex that acts as an injector.
Proton-proton collisions at the LHC begin with the extraction of protons from hydrogen
Figure 3.1: A schematic view of the LHC with the four main experiments [41].
gas, from which the electrons are stripped using an electric field, followed by acceleration
and injection into successively larger storage rings. Figure 3.2 shows the acceleration and
injection process, beginning with the extracted protons being accelerated to an energy of
50 MeV by a linear accelerator (LINAC2) and then further accelerated to 1.4 GeV by the
Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB). The beam then enters the Proton Synchrotron (PS)
where its energy is increased to 25 GeV and finally gets accelerated up to an energy of
450 GeV by the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). The resulting beam is split into two
parts which are accelerated around the LHC in opposite directions. The acceleration to
the collision energy is carried out by eight superconductive RF cavities located at four
different places around the the LHC itself. These RF cavities also provide longitudinal
beam focusing to maintain the bunch structure within the beam.
Performance of the LHC
The luminosity of the LHC (L) is defined as
L = f
nbN1N2
4xy
, (3.1)
where f is the revolution frequency of the bunches, N1 and N2 the number of bunches
per beam, nb the amount of particles per bunch and x and y the physical size of the
beams at the interaction point. The luminosity is related to the total number of collisions
Figure 3.2: The CERN accelerator complex [42].
generated in the LHC collisions, given by
Nevent = Levent (3.2)
where event is the cross section for the process under study.
The nominal design of the LHC called for an energy of 7 TeV per beam corresponding
to a centre-of-mass-energy of up to
s = 14 TeV at a frequency of 40 MHz. Inside the
LHC, 2808 proton bunches of up to 1011 protons will collide every 25 ns to provide 14 TeV
proton-proton collisions at a design peak luminosity of 1034 cm2s1. These running
conditions are, however, expected to be achieved only at the start of the second run of
the LHC in 2015. The luminosity for the first run of the LHC (Run1) increased over the
years, starting from a centre-of-mass-energy of
s = 900 GeV in 2009, to
s = 7 TeV
during 2010-2011 and finally to
s = 8 TeV at the beginning of 2012. This was achieved
by improving with time several of the LHC parameters, such as increasing the number of
protons per bunch, reducing the physical size of the bunch, and many more [35].
3.2 The ATLAS detector
ATLAS is one of two general-purpose experiments recording LHC collisions, designed to
study many different physics signatures both to prove the validity of the SM, like searching
for the Higgs boson, and to search for physics beyond the SM. It measures the particles and
energy of particles produced as a result of the proton-proton collisions at the LHC with
high precision, offering a nearly 4 solid angle coverage which provides a full description
for every collision.
Throughout this thesis, the standard ATLAS coordinate system is adopted for the
spatial description of the various detector components and in kinematic measurements of
physics processes. This coordinate system is defined by taking the beam direction as the
z-axis, and the x-y plane as transverse to the beam direction. The azimuthal angle, , is
measured around the beam axis and the polar angle, . A spacial coordinate is introduced
to describe the angle of a particle with respect to the beam axis, this is known as pseudo-
rapidity and is defined as   ln(tan(/2)). ATLAS (25 m high and 44 m long) has a
forward-backward symmetric cylindrical geometry with respect to the interaction point.
Therefore, detector components are described as being part of the barrel if they are in the
central region of pseudorapidity or part of the end-caps if they are in the forward regions.
The overall ATLAS detector layout with its components is shown in Figure 3.3. ATLAS
Figure 3.3: A cut-away view of the ATLAS detector [43].
innermost layer is the so-called Inner Detector (ID) which performs a fine grained track-
ing system for charged particles, and consists of a pixel and silicon micro-strip tracker and
a transition radiation tracker. It is enclosed by a thin superconducting solenoid provid-
ing a magnetic field of 2 T which allows for measurement of the transverse momentum
of charged particles. The following layers correspond to electromagnetic and hadronic
calorimeters that jointly allow precise energy measurements of photons, electrons, and
hadronic jets. The outermost layer corresponds to the Muon Spectrometer (MS), which
is embedded in a toroidal field, and designed to measure the position and momentum of
muons.
The main ATLAS detector performance goals are summarised in Table 3.1.
Table 3.1: General performance goals of the ATLAS detector [39]. Pseudorapidity range
used for the trigger system is specified in brackets if different to the range used for offline
measurements. The units for E and pT are in GeV.

The various sub-detector systems are described in the following paragraphs.
3.2.1 Magnet System
The ATLAS magnet system (22 m in diameter and 26 m long) is formed by a thin central
superconducting solenoid surrounding the ID system, and three large outer superconduct-
ing toroids arranged around the calorimeters that provide the field for the MS. These key
components of the detector generate the bending power for the momentum measurement
of charged particles. Figure 3.4 provides an overview of these components, which are
discussed in the following.
Figure 3.4: Schematic view of the layout of the four superconducting magnets forming the
ATLAS magnetic system [44].
Central Solenoid
The central solenoid magnet is designed for bending charged particles going through the
inner detector, and its geometry also takes into account the operational constrains of the
calorimeters. This 2.3 m diameter and 5.3 m long component is aligned with the beam
axis and provides a 2 T axial magnetic field, which allows for very accurate momentum
measurements of charged particles with momenta up to 100 GeV [44]. The electromagnetic
calorimeter of the experiment is situated outside this solenoid, which means that the
winding must be as transparent as possible for the particles traversing the detector.
Barrel and End-cap Toroids
The toroid magnet system is a cylindrical volume surrounding the calorimeters. It consists
of a long barrel and two end-caps toroids, each with eight superconducting coils (see
Figure 3.4) . The toroidal system is surrounded by muon detectors. The barrel and two
end-cap toroids produce a toroidal magnetic field of approximately 0.5 T and 1 T for the
muon detectors in the central and end-cap regions, respectively. The toroidal magnetic
fields enable the momentum measurement of low-pT muons by a bending force acting in
the -direction.
3.2.2 Inner Detector
The inner detector is the part of the ATLAS detector closest to the beam pipe and provides
a tracking system for momentum and vertex measurements of charged particles. When a
charged particle traverses the ID it will experience a force due to the 2 T magnetic field
surrounding it, acting orthogonally to the direction of motion of the particle, causing its
trajectory to curve. It is possible to calculate the momentum of a charged particle once
this curvature is measured.
The ID is divided into three independent concentric sub-detectors: a pixel detector, the
innermost sub-detector, consisting of three silicon pixel layers; the SemiConductor Tracker
(SCT) or silicon strip detector as the central layer of the ID; and surrounding all ID sub-
detectors is the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT). Combining these three sub-detectors
gives a tracking acceptance in the region || < 2.5 for tracks with pT > 0.5 GeV [45].
The following paragraphs provide a brief description of the ID sub-systems shown in
Figure 3.5.
Figure 3.5: Diagram of the ATLAS inner detector and its components [46].
Silicon Pixel Tracker
The pixel detector [47] is equipped with 1750 identical sensorchip-hybrid modules, each
covering an active area of 16.4  60.8 mm. The total number of modules correspond to
approximately 80 million semiconductor silicon pixels (50400 m2 rectangular segments
of silicon sensors), to cope with high rate luminosity of the ATLAS detector. This is
achieved by reading out every pixel with an independent electronics channel.
The silicon pixel detector is inside a cylindrical envelope of 48.4 cm diameter and
approximately 6.2 m length providing a pseudorapidity coverage of || < 2.5. Figure 3.5
shows the composition of the pixel detector as three concentric barrel layers of radii:
50.5 mm (the so-called b-layer), 88.5 mm and 122.5 mm. It also consists of a total of six
disk layers, three at each forward region. Particles will go through all three barrel layers of
the pixel detector, making hits in each of them as they traverse the ID. The 2 3 end-cap
disks are mounted perpendicularly to the beam axis to track the momentum of charged
particles at high . The main feature of the pixel detector is its fine granularity 1 which
is essential for high resolution measurement and precise vertex reconstruction.
1The granularity is the size of each pixel, which determines the resolution of the detector since the finer
granularities the more detection area giving a more accurate position.
SemiConductor Tracker
The SCT [45], the second innermost system in the ID, designed to measure four precision
space points (corresponding to eight silicon layers) on the track of a charged particle over a
range || < 2.5, which is mainly useful for precise momentum reconstruction, with intrinsic
resolutions per module of 17 m in the R  direction and 580m in the z direction.
The SCT consists of 4088 modules of semi-conducting silicon micro-strip detectors
arranged in four concentric barrel layers (as shown in Figure 3.6) with radii ranging from
299 mm to 514 mm and two end-cap layers. The silicon-strip sensors are read out by
radiation-hard front-end chips, each chip reading out 128 channels. Due to the SCT larger
radius from the beam pipe than the pixel detector, there is a reduced particle density
expected upon the SCT which allows for a smaller pixel density (coarser granularity) to
maintain the same levels of performance while using 6.3 million readout channels ( 2
million fewer than the pixel detector).
Figure 3.6: Schematic image of the sub-detectors within the ID tracker [46].
Transition Radiation Tracker
The TRT [48] is the outermost component of the ID which utilises layers of gaseous
straw tube elements (4 mm in diameter) and transition radiation material. As a charged
particle goes through the TRT it will ionise the gas (a mixture of xenon, carbon dioxide
and oxygen) inside the straw tubes. It has an average of 36 hits per track in the central
region, providing continuous tracking to enhance the pattern recognition and improve
the momentum resolution over the pseudorapidity range || < 2.0, important feature
for electron identification [49]. This design is complementary to the pixels detectors,
and aims to improve the pT resolution for particles with longer track length. It also
provides particle identification capability through the detection of transition radiation X-
ray photons generated by high velocity particles traversing through various materials with
different dielectric constants.
The TRT barrel section is arranged in three concentric layers each with 32 modules
jointly containing approximately 50 000 straws of 1.44 m length in total, which are aligned
parallel to the beam direction with independent readout at both ends. Each of the two
end-cap sections are divided into 14 wheels, with around 320 000 straws that run in the R-
direction. The transition radiator material surrounding the straws in the barrel (end-caps)
consists of polypropylene fibres (polypropylene foils).
3.2.3 Calorimeter System
The ATLAS calorimeters, illustrated in Figure 3.7, consist of detectors with full -symmetry
and  coverage of || < 4.9 around the beam axis. The inner layer corresponds to the
electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter and the outer layer corresponds to the hadronic calori-
meter.
The EM calorimeter is composed by one barrel (LAr electromagnetic barrel) and two
end-cap (EMEC ) sections using Liquid Argon (LAr) as sensing element, where the showers
in the Argon liberate electrons that are collected and then recorded, these sections also
referred to as LAr calorimeters [50].
The hadronic calorimeter contains one barrel (Tile barrel and Tile extended barrel)
and two end-cap (HEC ) sections. The sensors used for the barrel sections of the hadronic
calorimeter are tiles of scintillating plastic, which cause the plastic to emit light that gets
detected and then recorded, these sections are known as tile calorimeters [39]. The
end-cap sections use LAr as sensing element.
A LAr forward calorimeter (FCal) is also part of the calorimeter system, which aims
to cover the region closest to the beam.
A brief overview of the two calorimeter sensing elements is provided below.
Liquid Argon Calorimeters: The LAr EM calorimeter covers a pseudorapidity range
of || < 1.475 and 1.375 < || < 3.2, with one barrel and two end-cap regions,
respectively.
The LAr end-cap HEC covers a pseudorapidity range of 1.5 < || < 3.2. It consists
of two independent wheels for each end-cap, located directly behind the end-cap EM

layers [51].
calorimeter and sharing the same LAr cryostat. Its coverage overlaps with that of
the forward calorimeter to ease transitions between regions.
The LAr FCal covers a pseudorapidity range of 3.1 < || < 4.9 and it is formed by
one EM layer with copper as passive material and two hadronic layers which use
tungsten as absorbers.
These three sub-detectors share the same read-out electronics (182 468 channels in
total) that can be individually calibrated.
Tile Calorimeter: The tile calorimeter is the central ATLAS Hadronic Calorimeter, sur-
rounding the EM calorimeter system. Its main purpose is to provide hadronic energy
measurements. This calorimeter is built out of steel and scintillating tiles coupled
to optical fibres which are read out by photo-multipliers. It is is divided into three
cylinders with an inner radius of 2.28 m and an outer radius of 4.23 m: a central
barrel part that is 5.64 m long covering a region || < 1.0 and two extended barrel
parts, which are 2.91 m long and cover the pseudorapidity range 0.8 < || < 1.7.
Each cylinder consists of 64 modules spread in . Radially, each module is further
segmented in three layers with a cell (smallest calorimeter section) granularity of
  = 0.1 0.1 for the two inner most layers and   = 0.2 0.1 for the
outermost layer.
3.2.4 Muon Spectrometer
The MS [52] is the outermost part of the ATLAS detector which surrounds the calorimeters
and measures muon paths to determine their momenta with high precision (specified in
Table 3.1). The conceptual layout of the muon spectrometer is shown in Figure 3.8.
Its design is based on the magnetic deflection of muon tracks due to large supercon-
ducting air-core toroid magnets and high-precision tracking chambers.

The bending of the track is achieved by utilising one large barrel toroid to cover the
rapidity region ||  1.4 and two end-cap magnets covering the rapidity regions 1.6 <
|| < 2.7 inserted at both ends of the barrel toroid. In the barrel region, the toroidal field
is produced by eight very large superconducting coils arranged in an open geometry, with
a B-field varying from 0.5 to 2 T.
Tracks are measured using chambers arranged in three cylindrical layers around the
beam axis in the barrel region; in the transition region (1.4 < || < 1.6) and end-cap
regions, the chambers are installed in planes perpendicular to the beam, also in three
layers. Over most of the -range, a precision measurement of the track coordinates in
the principal bending direction of the magnetic field is provided by Monitored Drift Tubes
(MDTs). At large pseudorapidities, Cathode Strip Chambers (CSCs), which are multiwire
proportional chambers with cathodes segmented into strip with higher granularity, are used
in a pseudorapidity region of 2 < || < 2.7 to cope with demanding rates and background
conditions.
The use of the Resistive-Plate Chambers (RPCs) in the barrel and the Thin-Gap
Chambers (TGCs) in the end-caps is dedicated to the trigger system, this is described in
Section 3.3.
3.3 ATLAS Trigger System
The purpose for the development of the ATLAS trigger system is to reduce the event rate
taken from the LHC at 40 MHz bunch crossing2 to a recordable size of approximately
200 Hz, which corresponds to an average data rate of  300 MB/s. This is achieved by a
3-level system, shown in Figure 3.9, which ensures high acceptance for low-pT particles in
the events, thus providing a high efficiency for most physics processes of interest at LHC.
The first level of the trigger system, Level 1 (L1), is a hardware-based system that uses
information from the calorimeters and muon sub-detectors. The two subsequent levels:
Level 2 (L2) and Event Filter (EF), are software-based systems that use information from
all ATLAS sub-detectors, and together form the so-called the High Level Trigger (HLT).
Each level refines the decisions made by the previous one and, where necessary, applies
additional selection criteria.
The rest of this chapter is dedicated to the description of these three levels used by
the ATLAS triggering system.
2The collision of two proton bunches is commonly referred to as a bunch crossing. Most of the protons
within each bunch will not interact with each other, therefore, an average for the number of interactions
per bunch crossing () is used.
Figure 3.9: A schematic view of the ATLAS trigger system [53].
3.3.1 Level 1 Trigger
The L1 trigger system performs the first selection step by identifying Regions of Interest
(ROIs), - regions within the detector where its selection process has identified interesting
event features. The identified RoIs within the detector will be subsequently investigated by
the HLT. The selection made by L1 uses a limited amount of the total detector information
in order to make a decision on whether or not to continue processing an event, which
effectively reduces the input rate to a maximum of 75 kHz. In order to achieve a latency
of less than 2.5 s (time it would take to reach the front-end electronics), the L1 trigger
system is implemented in fast custom electronics. Event data from the sub-detectors are
stored in front-end pipeline memories awaiting a decision from the L1 trigger system.
If the event passes the L1 trigger selection, the ReadOut Buffers (ROBs) processes the
information in the RoIs, which will be passed onto the L2 trigger system.
The RoIs mainly focus on searching for high-pT objects, such as: muons, electrons,
photons, jets, and  - leptons decaying into hadrons; as well as large missing and total
transverse energy. Information used to identify high-pT muons is provided to the L1
trigger system by the MS chambers: the RPCs in the barrel (|| < 1.05) and the TGCs
in the end-caps (1.05 < || < 2.4), which have a time resolution capable of identifying the
bunch crossing, a key feature of the L1 trigger. The calorimeter sub-systems provide coarse
granularity information used to select electromagnetic clusters, jets,  -leptons, EmissT , and
large total transverse energy.
Figure 3.10: A schematic view of the ATLAS L1 trigger system [39]. The overall L1 trigger
decision is made by the Central Trigger Processor (CTP), taking input from calorimeters
and muon sub-detectors. The paths to the detector front-end electronics, L2 trigger, and
data acquisition system are shown from left to right in red, blue and black, respectively.
3.3.2 High Level Trigger
The second trigger level, L2, has a selection seeded by the RoI information provided by
the L1 trigger. Unlike L1, the L2 trigger system selection uses fine-granularity information
available from all sub-detectors, including the inner detector. Meanwhile, the ROBs store
the event data in fragments until the L2 decision is ready. The L2 selection is based on
fast custom algorithms processing partial event data within the RoIs identified by the L1
triggers. The L2 trigger system uses processor farms, consisting of around 500 quad-core
CPUs, and has an average latency of up to  10 ms [39]. The L2 triggers are designed to
reduce the trigger rate to approximately 3.5 kHz, with an event processing time of about
40 ms, averaged over all events. All event fragments from the ROBs for events accepted by
L2 trigger system are passed onto the Event Builder, which assembles all the information,
providing full event information to the EF, the final level of the ATLAS trigger system.
The final online selection is performed by software algorithms running on the EF with
a farm of processors consisting of 1800 dual quad-core CPUs [45]. The EF is designed to
reduce the rate to  200 Hz with an average processing time of  4 s/event. Rejected
events are not further processed while accepted events are stored for offline analyses.
Chapter 4
Event Simulation and
Reconstruction
Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is used in ATLAS to mimic particle interactions or decays,
each of them referred to as an event. These simulated events provide a tool for compar-
ison and validation with those events from real data taken by the detector. The process of
generating an event using MC simulation can be categorised into two parts: event genera-
tion and detector simulation. This chapter describes event generation, detector simulation
and the subsequent reconstruction of particles most relevant to the analysis presented in
this thesis.
4.1 Event Generation
The main software framework used in ATLAS, Athena [54], provides the tools to run
MC simulation of proton-proton collisions as well as the ATLAS detector response to
such physics processes. Figure 4.1 illustrates the various levels of processing for ATLAS
simulated data. This section describes the first step in the MC production chain: the
event generation of the primary event from the proton-proton interaction.
Scattering processes at high energy hadron colliders can be classified as either hard
(high energy) or soft, which can be theoretically described by QCD. Figure 4.2 provides a
schematic representation of a hadronic scattering process. During event generation, MC
generators are used to simulate the result of such interactions which can described by
four-vectors.
In the following, a brief description of the basic simulation steps performed by gener-
ators is given: the initial state of the proton, where the momentum shared amongst the

partons is described by a so-called Parton Density Function (PDF); any activity outside
the hard process, known as the underlying event; the final state parton showers; and
the hadronisation. The MC generators used for the MC samples used in this thesis are
listed in Section 5.1
Parton Density Function
PDFs [55] provide a measure of the partonic structure of hadrons, which is important for
any process which involves colliding hadrons. Their main purpose is to simulate partons
coming into the hard scatter process using matrix elements in lowest order perturbation
theory to calculate a probabilistic distribution of the outgoing partons.
Parton Showers
Once a description of the outgoing partons is obtained, Parton Showers (PS) are used to
describe the evolution of the partons involved in the hard collision, in this case coloured
particles (quarks and gluons). Incoming and outgoing partons can radiate gluons, causing
an extended shower and a loss in momentum of the incoming parton shower. This can be
calculated using Sudakov form factors [55], which describe the probability that a parton
evolves from an initial scale t0 to a final scale t without radiating or splitting. The parton

shower evolution starts from the hard process until a specific lower momentum scale is
reached to a point where perturbation theory is no longer viable. This non-perturbative
effect that causes the formation of hadrons from partons is called hadronisation.
Hadronisation and the Underlying Event
After the PS, hadronisation proceeds by using all partons which have been evolved and
other soft gluons coming from partons themselves. Partons are combined with their neigh-
bours to form colour singlets. After the hadronisation, the stable particles are passed to
the detector simulation to interact with the detector material.
In hadron collisions there will be partons that do not take part in the hard interaction
and which can interact among them and contribute to the final state. These form the
underlying event and are also taken into account by the MC generators.
4.2 Detector Simulation
Generated events are passed through a detector simulation, which mimics the response
of the real detector to the physics processes. In ATLAS, this is performed using the
GEANT4 [56] simulation framework, integrated in the ATLAS offline software. The de-
tector simulation produces GEANT4 hits, which record positions in the tracking detectors
and the energy deposits in the calorimeter cells. At this stage, output files containing data
of the detector simulation, known as a hit files, are generated. These are then digit-
ised to produce voltages and currents in the detector. The simulation of electronic noise,
pile-up (see Section 4.4), as well as other effects from the detector electronics will also
be taken into account at digitisation stage. Data in raw digits format are known as
Raw Data Object (RDO) which is the default format used by the ATLAS trigger and all
reconstruction algorithms (described in Section 4.3). It is important to mention that the
same detector geometry and simulation infrastructure is used for simulation, digitisation
and reconstruction processes to ensure agreement between simulation and reconstruction.
At the end of the detector simulation, the simulated data (in the form of digits) are in a
format that is equivalent to the data recorded with the ATLAS detector. This is what is
referred to as full MC simulation. Figure 4.3 shows a detailed MC simulation chain and
the corresponding data format at every stage.
A faster simulation process can also be performed using the ATLFAST-II pack-
age [57], which takes the generated events and performs a parametrisation of the calori-
meters response, which accounts for the missing simulation steps with respect to the full
simulation, to produce a format equivalent to that obtained after the reconstruction stage.
A fast simulation is important in cases when the total number of events simulated is a
limiting factor for analysis. For the work reported in this thesis, this is the case for the
production of tt events and some SUSY signal samples, discussed in Chapter 5.
The next section details how the simulated detector signals and the real data are
processed in order to reconstruct the physics objects that are most relevant for the analysis
discussed in Section 7.

orange boxes highlight the various stages in a full MC simulation; blue ovals correspond
to the data format obtained at every stage of the MC simulation chain.
4.3 Reconstruction
The ATLAS offline reconstruction software processes the raw detector and simulated data
to reconstruct the physics objects in each event. The building blocks of object recon-
struction are ID and MS tracks (only in the case of muons), and energy deposits in the
electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. The reconstruction of physics objects is done
by dedicated algorithms which are specific to signals of different detector components.
These algorithms are implemented within the Athena framework and their performance
is detailed in ref. [45].
In the following sections, the reconstruction of physics objects relevant for the analysis
presented in this thesis, such as, leptons and jets (narrow cone of hadrons), are discussed.
A more refined identification procedure is performed on the reconstructed physics ob-
jects, combining calorimeter and track quantities to discriminate mis-reconstructed or
background objects from the signal objects; details are discussed in Chapter 6.
4.3.1 Tracks
A collection of hits in the tracking sub-systems of the inner detector linked to a charged
particle traversing the ID forms tracks, which provide the information necessary to
reconstruct the path of a charged particle. Generally, a track can be parametrised using
variables which are defined relative to the position of the primary interaction point. In
particular, the Primary Vertex (PV) of the event defines the reference point with respect
to which impact parameters (d0 and z0) and vertex displacements are measured, it is
defined as the interaction point (vertex) with associated tracks that have the highest
sum of p2T. Impact parameters are track distance variables defined relative to an origin,
hence, their sign provides a discriminator for tracks originating from b-hadron decays to
those originating from the primary vertex. Track candidates are reconstructed in the ID
using standard ATLAS track reconstruction algorithms [58]. In the analysis presented in
this document, track selection refers to those originating from prompt particles (or from
primary vertices), which satisfy the following quality criteria: || < 2.5, |d0| < 1.5 mm
and |z0| < 1.0 mm, where the origin is taken to be the position of the primary vertex.
4.3.2 Electrons
As electrons traverse the detector, they will leave a track in the inner detector layer,
continuing to deposit most of their energy in the electromagnetic calorimeters (ECAL)
where they stop. A calorimeter cluster of an electron is defined as the energy deposit in
a given    region of the electromagnetic calorimeter. Electron candidates in a pseudo-
rapidity range of || < 2.47 are reconstructed by matching ECAL clusters to charged
particle tracks in the ID. To reconstruct calorimeter clusters, a sliding-window algorithm
is used [59]. It starts from seed clusters with a fixed rectangular shape, usually a size
corresponding to the granularity of the middle layer of the EM calorimeter (3 5 cells of
size 0.025  0.025 in   ), and transverse energy of at least 2.5 GeV. Seed clusters are
then matched to tracks reconstructed in the ID (as in Section 4.3.1), with tracks being
extrapolated from their last hit in the ID to the middle layer of the ECAL. To form an
electron candidate, at least one track must be within || < 0.05 of the reconstructed
seed cluster. If more than one track is available, tracks with silicon hits are preferred, and
the track with the smallest R =
2 + 2 value is chosen.
Once seed clusters and ID tracks are matched, seed clusters are rebuilt using a cluster
size of 3 7 (5 5) cells in the barrel (endcap), centred around the track-matched cluster
centre to determine the energy of the electron candidate (detailed in ref [60]). The total
energy of the electron candidate is determined by two components: the measured cluster
energy plus an estimate of any energy deposited outside the ECAL cluster (referred to as
leakage, detailed in ref [60]).
At this stage, electron candidates are referred to as reconstructed electrons. The
efficiency for central electrons to pass the cluster reconstruction and track matching re-
quirements, shown in Figure 4.4, is above 96% in 2012.
Figure 4.4: The 2011 (red) and 2012 (blue) electron reconstruction efficiency, including
track quality criteria, is shown as a function of the pseudo-rapidity  for electrons with
transverse energy ~EmissT between 15 and 50 GeV for data and MC. The reconstruction and
track-quality efficiency shown in the figure is measured with Z ee events in data and
MC using the tag-and-probe method [61].
The direction of the reconstructed electron will be mainly determined by that of the
track, however, if the track quality criteria discussed in Section 4.3.1 is not passed, the
direction of the cluster will determine the one of the electron candidate.
4.3.3 Muons
Muons can go through all detector layers: ID, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters
and MS. In general, muon candidates are reconstructed using the STAtistical COmbin-
ation (STACO) algorithm [62] combining inner detector and muon spectrometer track
information, with three different procedures:
 standalone reconstruction, where the muon trajectory is reconstructed using only
MS track segments, which are built from hits in each section of the MS are combined
to build track segments up to || < 2.7 and then get extrapolated to the beam line;
 combined muon reconstruction, where a standalone muon track and the ID track
are reconstructed independently and afterwards matched (provided that the meas-
ured pT for both tracks are compatible);
 segment taggedmuon reconstruction, which identifies muon candidates with a track
in the ID only if the trajectory extrapolated to the muon spectrometer can be asso-
ciated with straight track segments in the MS.
Reconstruction algorithms that rely on both the MS and ID provide a better momentum
measurement. Therefore, only combined and segment tagged muons are considered in this
analysis.
The next and final stage of muon reconstruction determines the energy loss of muons
in the calorimeters which causes the measured momentum in the MS to differ from the
initial momentum of the muon. The energy of the reconstructed muon candidate will
need corrections to take this into account, which is known as smearing. The pT of the
measured tracks in the MS is corrected in MC to match the resolution observed in data [63].
The muon reconstruction efficiency is found to be greater than 98% [64] using a tag-and-
probe tool with Z  events. The muon candidates at this stage are referred to as
reconstructed muons.
4.3.4 Jets
As hadronic jets travel across the detector they can leave tracks in the ID layer and deposit
energy in both electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. Therefore, clusters of calori-
meter cells are the building blocks of jets. Jet reconstruction starts with the formation of
topological clusters [59], which are a type of clustering algorithm with a variable number
of cells (unlike the sliding-window algorithm described in 4.3.2). Topological clusters are
seeded by calorimeter cells with large signal (S) to noise (N) ratio (S/N  4), which grow
by iteratively adding neighbouring cells with S/N  2. The resulting topological clusters
are taken as input by the anti-kt jet algorithm [65] with a distance parameter R = 0.4
to form a jet candidate.
Calibration of the topological clusters is performed by weighting differently the energy
deposits arising from electromagnetic showers (also known as EM scale) to those from
hadronic showers [66]. The jet reconstruction in the analysis presented in this thesis is
performed using the antiKT 4LCTopoJets algorithm, which takes calibrated topological
clusters as jet constituents.
b-tagged jets
B quarks hadronise into b-hadrons which will then decay in cascades to lighter hadrons or
leptons. These are commonly referred to as b-jets. b-jet algorithms are designed to identify
heavy flavour content in reconstructed jets by taking advantage of specific properties of the
b-hadrons such as high mass (of about 5 GeV) and long lifetime of the b quark (1.5 ps)
with respect to the lighter quarks. The presence of a displaced secondary vertex is a
characteristic of a b-jet, this is due to the long lifetime of the b quark which translates
into a large decay length, Lxy. The secondary vertex will generate displaced vertex tracks,
which are characterised by larger impact parameters than the ones defining the primary
vertex (see Figure 4.5). Displaced vertices and charged tracks are key objects taken as

the secondary vertex (Lxy) and the impact parameter (d0) of each track is illustrated in
the figure [67].
input for the b-tagging algorithms. There is a wide variety of b-tagging algorithms, such
as IP3D (impact parameter based), SV1 (secondary vertex based) and JetFitter (decay
chain reconstruction based), which are discussed in [68]. The analysis discussed in this
thesis makes use of the MV1 [69] algorithm, which is a multivariate technique1, based on
inputs from these three algorithms, and by combining them it achieves higher rejection of

which summarises the final discriminatory performance of the variables when various cuts are applied.
light quark jets. In Section 6.2.3, the specifications on the operating point for the MV1
algorithm are detailed.
4.4 Pile-up Simulation
With high instantaneous luminosity (defined in Equation 3.1) the number of non-hard-
scattering interactions for every beam crossing in an event will increase. This is known as
pile-up. In general, the mean number of interactions per bunch crossing  corresponds to
the mean of the Poisson distribution on the number of interactions per crossing that can
be derived from the instantaneous luminosity definition 3.1.
In order to match the pile-up conditions observed in data, simulated samples of both
background and signal processes are overlayed with a Poissonian-distributed number of
pile-up events and the resulting events are re-weighted such that the distribution of the
number of interactions per bunch crossing agrees with the data. Figure 4.6 shows the
luminosity-weighted mean number of interactions per bunch crossing  for the 7 TeV and
8 TeV centre-of-mass luminosities.

crossing for the 2011 and 2012 data. The mean number of interactions per bunch crossing

crossing calculated for each bunch [70].
Chapter 5
MC samples
ATLAS simulated data are generated by a set of well known MC generators. This chapter
provides a description of the relevant generators used to simulate the SM processes and
new physics signals relevant for the SUSY searches described in this document.
5.1 MC Generators
The main features of the different types of MC generators employed in this thesis are
described below.
General Purpose MC Generators
Pythia [71], Herwig [72] and Herwig++ [73] are general purpose MC event generators
that use Matrix Element (ME) calculations at Leading Order (LO), which include the
simulation of both hard and soft interactions. For the simulation of the underlying event,
Herwig is interfaced with Jimmy [74]. Both Pythia and Jimmy simulate the Underlying
Event (UE) as a scattering between proton remnants using matrix elements at LO.
Sherpa [75] is another multi-purpose event generator, interfaced with Pythia for
the simulation of the parton shower, that uses a multiple parton scattering model for
underlying event simulation.
Matrix Element MC Generators
The Alpgen [76], MadGraph [77] and AcerMC [78] generators simulate the hard pro-
cess of a proton-proton collision using calculations at fixed order in perturbation theory.
Events are generated with different multiplicities of outgoing partons, and cross sec-
tions are calculated at LO. For the parton shower and hadronisation, these generators are
interfaced with Pythia or Herwig because they can only provides generation of events at
parton-level. The addition of parton shower introduces a double-counting of events. This
is because the effect of parton shower on a sample with n-partons can produce additional
jets that are already taken into account in the n+1-partons sample. When more than two
generators are interfaced, matching techniques, such as CKKW [79] and MLM [80], are
used to remove double counting the matrix element and parton shower emissions.
Next-to-Leading Order MC Generators
MC@NLO [81] and Powheg [82] provide alternative simulation methods which combine
lowest-multiplicity Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) matrix elements with parton showers
without double counting. MC@NLO and Powheg produce hard scattering processes at
NLO, the difference lying on the fact that former includes negative weighted events in the
method used to prevent double counting. The MC@NLO generated events are typically
used as input to Herwig for the parton shower and hadronisation, and to Jimmy for
the underlying event. Powheg generated events are interfaced with Pythia to include
parton shower and underlying event effects.
5.2 Background MC Samples
Several background samples have been considered in this analysis and can be grouped in
different categories, as detailed in the following.
Dibosons: WW, WZ and ZZ processes are generated with the NLO generator Powheg.
These samples correspond to all SM diboson diagrams leading to `` , ```  and
````, respectively, with `, ` = e// and ,   = e// . The Sherpa generator
is used for the Z/W +  processes.
Tribosons: pp  WWW  lll, pp  ZWW  llll and pp  ZZZ  llll
processes (collectively referred to as V V V ) were generated with MadGraph to LO
in QCD.
tt+boson: tt+Z(+jets) and tt+W (+jets) samples were generated using the LO generator
Alpgen, while the tt+WW and tZ samples were generated using MadGraph. All
tt+boson samples are collectively referred to as ttV and have at least one of the top
quarks is decaying semi-leptonically (tWb b`).
Top: pair-production, tt, was generated with Powheg (+Pythia for simulating the par-
ton shower, hadronisation and the underlying event); single top production in the
t-channel (bq  tq and bq  tq) was generated with MC@NLO (+Herwig for
the simulation of parton shower and hadronisation); and single top production pro-
cesses in the s-channel (qq  W   tb) and the associated production of a top
quark and a W boson, Wt, was generated with AcerMC (+Pythia). All samples
are produced using a top quark mass of 172.5 GeV and have been re-normalised to
Next-to-Next-to Leading Order (NNLO).
Boson+jets: samples of Z/ production and W production in association with jets
(light and heavy flavour jets are taken into account) are produced with Alpgen
(+Pythia). For simplicity, these samples are referred to as V+jets. The W and
Z/ Alpgen LO cross sections are re-normalised to NNLO.
Standard Model Higgs: production samples, where the Higgs decays are via taus or
via W/Z bosons, are generated with Pythia. H   , H  WW  and H  ZZ
decaying into leptonic final states are considered, as these are expected to be the
most important sources of Higgs background in this analysis. Five production mech-
anisms are included: gluon Fusion (ggF ), Vector Boson Fusion (V BF ), associated
production with a W (WH) or Z boson (ZH), and associated production with a tt
pair (ttH). All cross sections are calculated at NNLO, except pp  ttH, which is
calculated at NLO QCD precision.
For all simulated processes, the propagation of particles through the ATLAS detector is
modelled with GEANT4 using the full ATLAS detector simulation, except the tt Powheg
sample, for which ATLFAST-II simulation is used.
Simulated events are weighted to match the distribution of the number of interactions
per bunch crossing observed in data, as discussed in Section 7.6.
Free parameters for the different PS, UE and hadronisation models are tuned to data. The
three different parameter tunes used for the underlying event generation in all MC samples
are the ATLAS Underlying Event Tune 2B (AUET2B), AU2 and PERUGIA2011C, which
are discussed in detail in [83].
Dedicated calculations are used to provide a re-normalisation of the total cross sections
for each SM processes at NLO or NNLO, these have been specified in Table 5.1. The choice
of parton density function depends on the generator and for this analysis the CTEQ6L1 [84]
PDFs are used with MadGraph, Alpgen, AcerMC, and Pythia and the CT10 [85]
PDFs with MC@NLO, Powheg and Sherpa.
The choice of the generator type and the order of cross section calculations used for
yield normalisation for the SM processes are summarised in Table 5.1
Table 5.1: MC samples used in this analysis for background estimates, the generator type
and the order of cross section calculations used for yield normalisation are also reported.

5.3 Signal MC Samples
Signal samples referring to the models considered in this analysis (Section 2.2.3) are gen-
erated with Herwig++, using the CTEQ6L1 PDFs. Signal cross sections are calculated
to NLO+NLL using PROSPINO2 [98]. Lepton or hadronic tau filters are applied during
event generation to enhance decays into a particular final state. In particular, a generator-
level filter was applied to the simplified model with staus requiring at least one hadronic
tau (tau filter) with visible pT > 15 GeV and || < 2.7. Moreover, a light lepton filter
(electron/muon) with the additional requirement of an electron/muon with pT > 5 GeV,
|| < 2.7 is applied to explore final states with and without hadronic taus.
The list the signal samples used in this thesis can be found in Table 5.2.

Object Selection
The process of identifying the reconstructed particles in the analysis presented in this
thesis is detailed in this chapter. The particle identification criteria will be classified as
baseline and signal, where the former provides a basic description of a particle and
the latter satisfies a tighter selection criteria, which is analysis dependent.
6.1 Overlap Removal
It often occurs that the same objects are reconstructed by more than one of the particle
identification algorithms described in Section 4.3. To avoid double counting objects, a
preference to one of the objects needs to be defined. The preference of one object over
another can be based on the level of efficiencies or on the purity of the object, which is
enhanced by suppressing background events or wrongly reconstructed objects as the cor-
responding object. The so-called overlap removal is performed between loosely identified
objects (defined as baseline objects in Section 6.2) and is applied in the order presented
in Table 6.1. The following describes the procedure of the overlap removal scheme.
Whenever two electron candidates are found geometrically close to each other in a
cone of R < 0.05, this can be an indicator that two calorimeter clusters were matched
to the same ID track, in this case, the lowest pT electron candidate is removed from the
event. In case where two muon candidates overlap due to shared tracks (R, <0.05),
then both muon candidates are removed from the event. Electron candidates may also
be found by jet algorithms (used for jet and hadronic tau reconstruction), but due to
the higher efficiency and purity of the electron reconstruction algorithms, the jet and
hadronic tau candidates are rejected if the overlap with an electron within R < 0.2.
Similarly, if a tau candidate is close-by (R < 0.2) to a muon candidate, the tau is

rejected. Jets may contain leptons from semi-leptonic b- and c-quark decays, and they
can reconstructed as light leptons (e/). To remove such leptons from jet candidates,
and additional R requirement is imposed on electrons and muons. Another possible
scenario is if a high-pT muon candidate undergoes Bremsstrahlung (radiates a photon),
the resulting photon may be wrongly reconstructed as an electron (jet overlap removal
has already been applied at this point). Both mis-reconstructed objects are removed if
close-by to each other (Relectron, <0.01). Hadronic taus are reconstructed using jets
as building blocks, hence, any overlapping jet with a signal tau candidate (defined in
Section 6.2.4) is discarded.
6.2 Object Identification
A detailed description of the physics objects used in this analysis is of primary importance
to understand the results in this thesis. The rest of this chapter focuses on the description
of the object identification criteria that follows from reconstruction, used for electrons,
muons, taus, jets and missing transverse energy.
6.2.1 Electrons
Electron identification criteria rely on a cut-based1 selection using tracking and calorimeter
information which are applied to the reconstructed electron described in Section 4.3.2. This
is performed to reduce the number of non-prompt (fake) electrons. Three reference sets
of requirements are used [60]: loose, medium or tight, in order of decreasing effi-
ciency and increasing background rejection power. Some of these requirements include:
shower shape variables of the EM calorimeter middle layer are used in the loose selection;
track quality requirements and track-cluster matching added on top of the loose require-
ments for the medium selection; and the tight selection adds requirements on the track
matching (i.e. ratio of the cluster energy, E, to the track momentum, p), uses informa-
tion from the TRT (i.e. number of hits in the TRT), and discriminates against photon
conversions using hit information in the ID.
The electron candidates passing the cuts listed in Table 6.2 and the overlap removal
requirements in Table 6.1 are considered as baseline electrons.

Signal electrons are selected starting from baseline electrons with additional (tighter)
quality requirements listed in Table 6.3. These include impact parameter requirements
to remove tracks associated to pile up interactions and isolation requirements to discrim-
inate against heavy flavour decays. This selection is designed to reject fake electrons
coming from non-isolated electrons, photon conversion produced electrons, and jets faking
electrons.
A tag-and-probe method is performed using Z  ee and J/ ee events to measure
the efficiency of electron identification [60]. Figure 6.1 shows the efficiencies obtained using
Z ee events for the various levels of identification cuts as a function of transverse energy.
1Cut-based techniques use a set of criteria motivated by physical considerations and cut values are
determined by analysing samples of signal and background objects. The cuts can be applied independently.

based identification criteria are employed for the 2012 analyses. Data and MC efficiencies
are reported [61].
6.2.2 Muons
Muon identification is performed on all the tracks where the MS tracks are associated to ID
tracks. This is done by requiring high quality track selection (as defined in Section 4.3.1)
and track-based isolation criteria. A summary of the requirements for a baseline muon is
in Table 6.4, where candidates have also passed the overlap removal described in Table 6.1.
Additional isolation requirements to define a signal muon are described in Table 6.5.
These signal requirements use isolation parameters to help discriminate signal muons from
background ones, this is to avoid jets coming from heavy flavour decays that can be mis-
identified for prompt muons. Also, impact parameters with constraints placed on the
muon origin (with respect to the primary vertex of the event) are used to reject muons
from cosmic rays.
Corrections to the reconstructed muon momentum have been derived by comparing
the reconstructed muon momentum in experimental and simulated data [99]. For these
corrections, Z   and J/ events have been used by comparing the invariant mass
line-shape of the resonances and, in case of Z events reconstructed with muons in the MS,
also the difference between transverse momentum reconstructed in the ID and in the MS.

6.2.3 Jets
The baseline jet identification criteria is based on kinematic requirements which aim to
efficiently reject background jets while keeping the highest efficiency selection for jets pro-
duced in proton-proton collisions. All selected jets must: have high transverse momentum,
pT > 20 GeV; be within the pseudorapidity coverage of the calorimeters, || < 4.5; and
pass the overlap removal scheme explained in Section 6.1.
Signal jets are selected from baseline jets, which are required to cover a pseudorapidity
range of || < 2.5 and that the fraction of jet transverse energy associated to tracks coming
from the primary vertex, the so-called Jet Vertex Fraction (JVF) is greater than 0.5. Large
JVF values suppresses jets from a different (not primary) interaction in the same beam
bunch crossing.
B-tagged jets
Classification of signal jets as b-jet candidates is done using a multivariate tagging al-
gorithm, the MV1 algorithm [69]. This algorithm has various levels of identification based
on the tagging efficiency. Signal jets are identified as b-jets if the output of the MV1
algorithm is greater than 0.3511. This corresponds to an average b-tagging efficiency of
80% [69], with a light-flavour jet mis-identification probability of about 4%.
6.2.4 Taus
Tau leptons are much heavier than any other lepton and have a very short lifetime ( =
1.9  1013 s equivalent to a path length of 87 m). This means that they will decay
in the beam pipe. Taus can decay either leptonically (  `` , ` = e/) with a 35%
probability, or hadronically (   ) 64.7% of the times. The hadronic decay modes are
classified as either 1-prong or 3-prong decays, where the number of prongs or tracks
is determined by the number of charged decay products (pions) in the tau decays.
Figure 6.2 shows the description of the reconstruction cone of a three-prong hadronic
Figure 6.2: Three-prong (3 charged pions and one neutral pion) tau reconstruction cone.
In the illustration, the green cone represents the tau core cone.
The signature of a jet is very similar to that of a hadronic tau, therefore, hadronic
tau reconstruction is seeded by jets (as discussed in Section 4.3.4) reconstructed with the
anti-kt algorithm , with a distance parameter R=0.4, pT > 10 GeV and || < 2.5 (which
corresponds to the coverage in the tracking system). Electromagnetic and hadronic
cluster shapes in the calorimeters as well as tracks in a cone within R < 0.2 of the seed
jet are key properties of the tau identification algorithm, which help differentiate tau from
jet candidates.
The identification of hadronic taus requires further discriminating variables to reject
fake taus from jets. This can be achieved using both a set of requirements and a Boosted
Decision Tree (BDT)2 multi-variate technique [100].
The following paragraphs show some of the discriminators used for tau identification,
a full list of variables can be found in [101]. The working points for the different selection
of variables used in the analysis are summarised in Table 6.7.
Jet BDT Discriminators
The discrimination of hadronic taus against jets is based on a BDT, which relies on seven
or more discriminating track and cluster variables depending on the number of tau prongs,
see [100]. The distribution of some of the discriminating variables are computed for  -rich
events and quark- or gluon-jets are shown in 6.3. These variables are the fraction of the
total tau energy contained in the core cone defined by R < 0.1, f corrcore , the track distance
from the tau axis, Rtrack, in case of 1-prong taus and the maximum distance between two
reconstructed tracks within a cone around the tau candidate, Rmax, in case of 3-prong
taus. Also, the significance of a reconstructed secondary vertex, S
flight
The signal and background efficiencies for tau identification are defined as
nprong
Signal =
# of identified  candidates with n reco tracks
# of true decays with n prongs
(6.1)
nprong
Background =
# of identified  candidates with n reco tracks
# of reconstructed taus with n tracks
(6.2)
Jet BDT working points are defined to target signal efficiencies of 70(65)%, 60(55)%
and 40(35)% for 1(3)-prong, respectively. Background rejection factors of 10-40 for signal
efficiencies of 70% are achieved, going up to 500 for 35% signal efficiencies for 1- and 3-
prong taus [101].
The 2012 signal and background jet BDT identification efficiencies for 1- and 3-prong
tau candidates in all BDT working points as a function of the number of vertices is shown
in Figure 6.4.
Electron BDT Discriminators
The characteristic signature of 1-prong hadronic taus can also be mimicked by prompt
electrons. There are several properties that can be used to discriminate between electrons
2 Decision trees apply cuts on multiple variables in a recursive manner to classify objects as signal or
background. It produces a continuous score between 0 (background-like) and 1 (signal-like), on which a
user may cut to yield the desired signal or background efficiency.

and 1-prong taus, such as, the emission of transition radiation of the electron track and
the longer and wider shower produced by the hadronic tau decay products in the calori-
meter, compared to the one created by an electron. These properties are used to define
tau identification discriminants specialised in the rejection of electrons mis-identified as
hadronically decaying tau leptons. An electron veto based on BDTs makes use of these
discriminants and is optimised using simulated Z   events for the signal and Z  ee
events for the background. The dependence of the signal and background efficiency of the
electron veto on transverse momentum is shown in Figure 6.5. The e-veto BDT working
points target signal efficiencies of 95%, 85% and 75%, respectively. Background rejection
factors of 1/10 for signal efficiencies of 95% are achieved for 1-prong taus [101].
The tau candidates passing the cuts listed in Table 6.6 and the overlap removal scheme
explained in Section 6.1 are considered as baseline taus.

The BDT method explained previously is used to provide further discrimination against
jets and electrons. Moreover, a cut-based muon veto is used to reject candidates with hits
in the MS. The set of requirements used to define signal taus are summarised in Table 6.7.

6.2.5 Missing Transverse Energy
The missing transverse energy, ~EmissT , is defined as the momentum imbalance in the plane
transverse to the beam axis due to neutrinos and other weakly-interacting particles:
EmissT =
(Emiss
+ (Emiss
. (6.3)
The calculation of ~EmissT uses the reconstructed physics objects discussed in Section 4.3.
The vector sum of transverse energy in the calorimeters, as well as tracks measured in
the muon spectrometer defines the missing transverse energy of the event:
Emiss(x,y) = E
miss, calo
(x,y)

, (6.4)
where the muon component is calculated by summing over muon track momenta (within
|| < 2.7):

The calorimeter term, E

, is defined as

where the E
miss, e
(x,y)
miss, 
(x,y)
and E
miss, 
(x,y)
terms are calculated from energy deposits in the
calorimeter cells associated to electrons, photons and hadronic taus, respectively. The
muon term E
miss, (calo)
(x,y)
is calculated from the energy loss of all muons in the calorimeters
(the energy deposits from isolated muons are not taken into account to avoid double-
counting of the muon energy). The jet term E
miss, jets
(x,y)
is calculated using jets with local
calibration applied, and with pT > 20 GeV. Any cells in clusters associated to jets with
softer pT (7 GeV< pT < 20 GeV) and the remaining low energy calorimeter deposits
(within || < 4.9) not associated with any of the above objects form the cell out term
miss, cellOut
(x,y)
) [102].
Hadronic taus are not distinguished from jets, hence, they are accounted in the ~EmissT
calculation as jets, which provides a stable ~EmissT description, corresponding to Egamma10NoTau
RefFinal, which takes as input all baseline objects (without overlap removal being per-
formed on them) defined previously in this chapter. This is defined as

SUSY Searches in Three Lepton
Final States
Direct electroweak production of charginos (i=1,2) and neutralinos (
j=1,2,3,4) can lead
to leptons in the final state, missing energy and very low hadronic activity.
This chapter presents the search strategies developed in this thesis which particularly
focus on direct production of 1 
2 decaying to three leptons and missing energy using
the complete ATLAS dataset collected during the 2012 LHC run at 8 TeV centre-of-mass
energy. Each of the intermediate particles in the decay chain of 1 
2 pair production
into three leptons (e//) can provide different SUSY scenarios. All scenarios described
in Section 2.2.1 are considered for this search, where the 1 
2 decays are mediated by
production of WZ, Wh,  or  particles.
7.1 The 2012 Data
In 2012, the LHC delivered pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of
s = 8 TeV,
corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 22.8 fb1, and a total luminosity recorded
by the ATLAS detector equivalent to 21.3 fb1. Data-quality criteria are imposed to
the 2012 data collected by ATLAS [1], which take into account possible hardware and
data-taking problems by the various ATLAS sub-systems. The resulting data used for
this analysis corresponds to a total integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb1. The evolution of
the 8 TeV cumulative integrated ATLAS luminosity as a function of time is shown in
Figure 7.1.
The improvements to the instantaneous luminosity from year to year were due to
increases in the number of proton bunches in each beam, increases in the number of

protons per bunch, and improvements in beam focusing.
7.2 Analysis Strategy and Personal Contribution
The three lepton search is designed to select events containing charginos and neutrali-
nos from events due to SM processes. Trilepton events are selected based on the object
identification criteria discussed in Chapter 6. Events are required to pass further quality
selection criteria (detailed in Section 7.3), as well as the trigger requirements described
in Section 7.3.1. After all quality requirements are satisfied, the search for interesting
events begins by defining signal regions where signal events are maximised over contribu-
tion from SM background events (see Section 7.4). At the same time, validation regions
are identified, dominated almost exclusively by SM backgrounds, where the contribution
of the different SM events are estimated. The results are discussed in Chapter 8.
Throughout this document, signal electrons and muons are labelled as ` or ` where
the flavour of ` and ` is assumed to be different, whereas signal hadronic taus are denoted
as  for simplicity.
Personal contribution
I had the responsibility within the ATLAS multilepton SUSY analysis to add the hadronic
tau final states as part of the three lepton analysis, which have been proven to be very
important for an increase in sensitivity with respect to channels with only light leptons
(e/) previously studied [103, 104, 105].
I was responsible for defining new signal regions (defined in Section 7.4 as SR0b,
SR1 , SR2a/b) with the purpose of enhancing the signal contribution of the newly ex-
plored SUSY scenarios with 1 
2 pair production with decays into three leptons mediated
by Wh or  . I also contributed to the MC-based estimation and modelling of the main
SM backgrounds in the signal regions mentioned above and in dedicated Validation Re-
gions (VR) where the signal contamination is low, defined in Section 7.5 as VR1a/b and
VR2a/b. Details of the thorough modelling of the event kinematics in these VRs can
be found in Section 7.5. I evaluated the main systematic uncertainties, e.g. theoretical
cross section uncertainty and lepton identification systematics, on the SM backgrounds
for the signal regions stated above, as well as those related to the PDF sets for all signal
regions, and the experimental systematics. I have been responsible for the setting of the
mass exclusion limits for four new SUSY models: two simplified models (the  - and Wh-
mediated) and two pMSSM models (dominated by no- and  decays). These results are
detailed in Chapter 8.
A paper summarising the results of these searches was published in the Journal of High
Energy Physics (JHEP) in April 2014 [1]. This paper contains the first SUSY results from
the ATLAS collaboration which include the SM Higgs.
7.3 Event pre-selection
7.3.1 Triggers
This analysis makes use of single-isolated light lepton triggers as well as di-lepton triggers,
listed in Table 7.1. The selected events in this analysis are required to pass any of these
light-lepton trigger chains. A logical OR of the triggers is used to enhance the trigger
selection efficiencies. To ensure that trigger efficiency is independent of the pT of the
leptons, events are required to have a pT above a specific threshold for each trigger chain,
also listed in Table 7.1. Figure 7.2 shows an example of the turn-on curve for one of the
single-muon triggers used in this trigger menu, where the plateau is reached at 25 GeV,
which is the threshold selected for this trigger chain. The pT thresholds are also chosen
such that the overall trigger efficiency with respect to the selected events is above 90%,
and is independent of the lepton pT [106].

method in Z   events was used to derive these efficiencies. The vertical error bars in
the figure represent the statistical errors. The amount of data used corresponds to 5.56
fb1 [107].
Any event overlap in the data streams is removed by requiring that events in the
EGamma stream were triggered by the EGamma-triggers (specified in table 7.1)
and any events in the Muons stream fail to pass the EGamma-triggers and pass
the Muons-triggers instead. The same requirements are applied to the MC-simulated
events (in MC simulated data events are not duplicated so no overlap removal is needed).
The ATLAS hadronic tau triggers use a tau identification criteria that is tighter than
the signal tau selection used in this analysis, see Section 6.2.4. Therefore, only triggers
based on light leptons are used to trigger events.
The trigger performance has been studied in detail in ref. [106], where the electron
(muon) trigger efficiencies are measured by using the tag-and-probe method on Z  ee
(Z  ) events. In particular, the three-lepton analysis team performed similar studies
to show the agreement between the trigger performance in data and MC simulation for
all single and double triggers, where it is seen that discrepancies are smaller than 2%. A
conservative systematic of 5% is applied to account for these differences seen between the
trigger in data and simulation.

Event Quality Requirements
All events must have exactly three signal leptons (e//), as in Chapter 6. Data are
selected if one or more of the signal light leptons in the event matches one of the light lepton
triggers and is within R < 0.15 from the relevant trigger object. Furthermore, there are
requirements which are applied to reject events that might suffer from reconstruction
problems, such as, jets which do not originate from hard scattering events [108] and fake
missing transverse energy in the event originating from instrumental effects ( e.g. detector
noise), cosmic ray muons, non-operational detector parts. All events are required to have
a primary vertex with five or more associated good tracks. In addition, well-isolated
muons in the event which also satisfy |z0| < 1 mm or |d0| < 0.2 mm are required to
suppress cosmic rays; and events with muons that may be mis-measured in charge (q)
and/or momentum (p) in the ID are discarded if they satisfy:
|q/p|  0.2.
7.4 Signal Region Definition and Optimisation
Five main signal regions (SR) are defined according to the flavour and charge of the
leptons surviving pre-selection. The hadronic tau multiplicity drives the categorisation of
the signal regions in: 3` + 0 , 2` + 1 and 1` + 2 channels, where ` refers to electrons
and muons only. Since no b-jets are expected in the final states studied, a veto on events
containing b-tagged jets is applied in all signal regions. All signal regions have a high
missing transverse energy requirement of at least 50 GeV.
Signal regions are defined by varying the requirements on selected kinematic variables
to maximise the signal significance, ZN [109], defined as:
2erf1(1 2p(S,B, B)). (7.1)
In this formula p indicates the probability to observe more data than the background-
only hypothesis prediction (see Section 8.1 for more details); S and B are the number of
expected signal and background events, respectively, in a given region; and B corresponds
to the uncertainty associated to the background yields. The uncertainty choice is driven
by the available statistics for the dominating background in a given region, in the case
of SR2a, the backgrounds is largely dominated by reducible SM processes with poor
statistics, hence a conservative 100% is used, and 30% is used for all other signal regions.
The requirements on the kinematic variables used to define the SRs are shown in
Table 7.2. The optimisation process focuses on fixing a requirement of one of the kin-
ematic variable at a time and varying the others in order to reduce SM background pro-
cesses and preserve the signal events denoted throughout this document as SM WH/staus
,m01
) which refer to selected simplified model via Wh/ benchmark points with
various masses of 1 and 
1. These requirements are chosen such that the significance
value (zN ) for most signal benchmark points is optimal without statistical bias. For this
reason, it is important to show the kinematic variable distribution before a requirement
has been applied and also, the signal significance of a few benchmark points as the re-
quirement on the variable itself is varied. The definition of signal regions and optimisation
studies performed using MC-simulated data are detailed in the following paragraphs.

definitions are shown in Table 7.3. Energies, momenta and masses are given in units of

The presence of one same-flavour and opposite-charge (SFOS) light lepton pair is the first
requirement for the definition of this SR. This is motivated by the expected final state of
1 and

L and WZ
particles, respectively.

These decay modes have been studied in previous searches [103, 104, 105], where it was
found that EmissT and the transverse mass (mT) are the most powerful discriminators.
The variable mT is defined using the pT of the light lepton not part of the SFOS pair
(with invariant mass closest to the mass of the Z boson) and the EmissT :
mT(~p

A requirement on mT will suppress the background from WZ SM processes, where
it is expected that mT  mW . This signal region is further subdivided in bins defined
by the invariant mass of the SFOS lepton pair (mSFOS) closest to the Z boson mass,
the transverse mass mT, and E
T . Furthermore, events with trilepton invariant mass,
m3`, close to the Z boson mass (|m3`  mZ | <10 GeV) are vetoed in bins 5, 9 and 13
to suppress contributions from Z boson decays with converted photons from final-state
radiation, this is denoted in Table 7.3 as 3` Z veto. The total list of bins considered is
shown in Table 7.3.
The first step in the optimisation of this region consists of defining five bins in the
mSFOS as shown in the second column of Table 7.3. The chosen values of the selection
requirements on mSFOS have been found most favourable in a previous optimisation [103].
The first three and fifth mSFOS bins are defined in order to maximise the sensitivity
of the analysis to the L-mediated model as well as the WZ-mediated model where the Z
boson is produced virtually (off-shell), analogous to the Z-depleted region in [103]. The
fourth bin is defined to be sensitive to the WZ-mediated model, in analogy to the Z-
enriched region in [103]. The WZ and tt backgrounds generally dominate the SR0a bins
in varying proportions, with WZ mainly dominating the bins for which mSFOS is in the

have a low-pT third-leading lepton from a leptonic b decay. The pT distribution for the
third-leading lepton is shown in Figure 7.5(a) alongside a plot 7.5(b) which shows that a
cut at p3rd `T > 20 GeV is optimal based on the ZN values calculated for various signal
benchmark points shown, which have been chosen based on their expected yields. Lastly,
the  angle between two opposite-sign (OS) light leptons (coming from the Higgs decay
according to the model) is studied. The minimum value out of all possible  combina-
tions between OS light-lepton pairs, min`` , is shown in Figure 7.5(c). The signal events
have opposite-sign leptons closer in  space than the SM background events, which is
relatively flat in min`` . Therefore, a requirement of

the taus decays hadronically and the other leptonically:

01 (7.6)
Because of the expected final state, the selection requires two same-sign (SS) signal elec-
trons/muons and one signal hadronic tau with opposite charge.
A requirement on the invariant mass of the ` pair, m` , closest to the Higgs boson
mass of 125 GeV is made. Same-sign electron pairs with invariant mass consistent with a
Z boson mass (81.2 GeV < mee < 101.2 GeV) are vetoed to suppress events in which the
charge of an electron is wrongly assigned due to a converting photon. This effect is rare in
di-muon events due to the higher performance of combined-track information from the ID
and MS at reconstruction level and also because muons undergo far less Bremsstrahlung
than electrons. Figure 7.6 shows the effect of the Z-veto on the background yields, mainly
coming from Z+jets processes.

and m01

Once all of these requirements have been applied, the pT of the sub-leading light
lepton is investigated, as shown in Figure 7.8(a). The remaining contribution to the SM
background, are mainly coming from diboson and tt processes, which have soft sub-leading
leptons compared to the SUSY events considered. Therefore, the sub-leading light lepton
in the event is required to have pT> 30 GeV to discriminate against these SM backgrounds.
Due to missing neutrinos from the tau decays and the two LSP (01) in the event,
the Higgs mass cannot be accurately measured. This can be seen in the distribution of
the invariant mass of the hadronic tau and the leptonic tau candidate, assuming that the
second leading light lepton comes from the h   decay, shown in Figure 7.9(a). A
upper limit on the invariant mass of the lepton-tau pair (m` < 120 GeV) is chosen as the
optimal requirement to remove SM contributions, mainly from diboson processes.
After these requirements are imposed, the diboson and tt processes dominate the re-
maining SM background.

7.4.3 1`+ 2 channel
SR2a (hadhad`)
This signal region is sensitive to the L-mediated scenario, where the two tau leptons decay
hadronically:
1 
2  
 
  01
0. (7.7)
In this SUSY scenario there are three leptons that can originate from the staus or
directly from the 02, making them indistinguishable.
Discrimination between SUSY signal and main SM backgrounds, such as, top and
W+jets, is achieved using the stransverse mass variable, mT2 [111, 112]. This variable
is designed to select events where there are particles decaying to one visible and one
invisible object, e.g. WW  `` and 1 
2 decays as in Equation 7.7.
The stransverse mass is defined as
mT2 = min
mT(~pT, 1, ~qT),mT(~pT, 2, ~p
T  ~qT)
, (7.8)
where ~pT, 1 and ~pT, 2 are the transverse momenta of the two visible objects and ~qT corres-
pond to the transverse vector that minimises the larger of the two transverse masses. For
signal events the mT2 end-point is correlated to the mass difference between the lightest
chargino or next-to-lightest neutralino and the LSP. For large values of this difference, the
mT2 distribution for signal events extends significantly beyond the distributions of the SM
background events which have in this case have a kinematic upper end-point at around the
mass of the decaying particle. Therefore, events in this SR are selected requiring that they
have high EmissT and high maximum stransverse mass m
T2 , where m
T2 is formed by
taking the largest mT2 value out of all possible combinations of `, , E
T and , , E
taken as input for the calculation. No charge requirement is made on any of the three
leptons.
The optimisation process is done by looking at the EmissT and m
T2 distributions, as
shown in Figure 7.10. The chosen SUSY signal points shown on the plots, characterise
the main features of the L-mediated scenario. This signal region is defined by having
a minimum requirement on the EmissT (E
T > 50 GeV) and a large m
T2 cut (m
100 GeV), in order to reduce background events coming from V+jets processes, which lie
at values below 100 GeV.

This signal region is sensitive to the Wh-mediated scenario shown in Equation 7.6, where
the two tau leptons decay hadronically. Therefore, selected events are required to have
two opposite-sign hadronic taus and one light signal lepton.
A high EmissT requirement of 60 GeV is used to reduce contributions from V+jets
processes. The missing transverse energy for events with `+ and a b-jet veto is shown
in Figure 7.11(a). The effect on the signal significance can be seen in Figure 7.11(b), where
a cut of EmissT > 60 GeV is shown to be optimal for the SUSY benchmark points with
highest yields.

(see Figure 7.12). Due to escaping neutrinos in the event, the peak of the m is lower
than the Higgs mass at 125 GeV. The WZ and ZZ backgrounds have broad m values
below the Z mass. Upper and lower requirements on m can reduce contamination
from backgrounds with Z bosons due to the mass difference between Z and H boson
( 30 GeV). This signal region is required to have m in the mass window 70120 GeV
to mainly reduce such diboson background contributions. Furthermore, the scalar sum
of pT of the two hadronic taus in the event is investigated and its distribution shown
in Figure 7.13. The SUSY events tend to have larger total energy than the SM events,
due to the higher mass of the particles, and result in particles with large momenta in
the final state for SUSY signals. A requirement on the sum of pT of the two hadronic
taus (
pT> 110 GeV) discriminates well against SM background coming from V+jets
processes.
The remaining backgrounds surviving the SR2b selection are due to diboson and tt
processes.
7.5 Background Estimation
Several SM processes can lead to events with three leptons in the final state and therefore
enter the signal regions as background contamination. All lepton candidates (e//) in
the events entering the SR can be categorised according to the process they originate

from using MC-simulated data. These categories are: real leptons, which are prompt
and isolates, and originate from W , Z, h and  decays; and fake leptons, which can
originate from a mis-identified light-flavour quark or gluon jet. Real leptons that are non-
prompt are considered as fake leptons since they can originate from a semi-leptonic decay
of a heavy-flavour quark, or an electron from a Bremsstrahlung photon conversion.
Figure 7.14 shows the origin of the lepton candidates passing signal regions selection
using MC simulated background processes categorised as either Top or Boson. Bo-
son processes accounts for contributions coming from dibosons, tribosons, W/Z+jets and
Higgs (ggF/V BF/WH/ZH) backgrounds; and the Top processes accounts for contri-
butions coming from tt, tt + V , single-t and Higgs (ttH). Electrons and muons mainly
originate from a prompt decay, whereas hadronic taus are mainly fakes originating from
heavy flavour and light flavour jet decays.
Based on whether leptons are real or fake, SM processes are classified into irreducible
background (all leptons in the events are real) and reducible background (events with at
least one fake lepton). This section describes how the background contribution in the
signal regions is estimated, by using data-driven techniques for the reducible processes
and MC-based techniques for the irreducible processes. The predictions for irreducible and
reducible backgrounds, discussed in 7.5.1 and 7.5.2 respectively, are tested in validation
regions (section 7.5.3) by comparing them to what is seen directly from the real data in
kinematic regions that are close yet disjoint from SRs.

7.5.1 Irreducible Background
The processes that form the irreducible background for this analysis areWZ(/), ZZ(/),
tt+Z(/W/WW ), tZ, V V V and Higgs boson production (ggF/V BF/WH/ZH). The MC-
based estimates are shown in table 7.4 and indicate that WZ dominates the irreducible
background in all SRs, except in SR0b (where the optimisation uses a SFOS veto to
specifically reject WZ events). In this SR is the V V V background is the one that domin-
ates. All background estimates are determined using corresponding MC-simulated data,
for which lepton (e//) and b-jet selection efficiencies are corrected to account for differ-
ences with respect to the real data (more details in Section 7.6).
Table 7.4: Total irreducible background yields in the signal regions. The different com-
ponents are derived purely from MC. All background contributions are normalised to
20.3 fb1. Uncertainties are statistical and systematic, as described in Section 7.6.

7.5.2 Reducible Background
For the analysis presented in this thesis, the processes that form the reducible background
in the case of two real leptons are tt, single top (Wt), WW , Z/, accompanied by a
fake lepton, which originates from heavy flavour decay (HF), light flavour jet (LF), or
a converted photon (CO). In the case of 1 real lepton, the main background comes from
single top (s-channel, t-channel) processes, W accompanied by two fake leptons originating
from HF decay, LF decay, or a conversion.
A data-driven technique is used to model the reducible background component. This
data-driven technique is known as matrix method (MM) and exploits differences in
object characteristics between real and fake leptons on a statistical basis. Leptons are
first classified as loose (L) or tight (T ) depending on isolation criteria and/or quality
of the reconstruction. For this analysis, baseline leptons are considered loose leptons and
signal leptons are considered tight leptons, as defined in Chapter 6.
The principle on which the method is based on is that the number of events with
different proportions of the number of L and T leptons can be expressed as a linear
combination of the number of events with real and fake leptons in a given region. In a
three lepton final state, an 88 matrix is built to account for all possible combinations of
real and fake leptons.
MC studies reported in Figure 7.15 show that the composition of the highest-pT light
lepton in signal regions SR0b, SR1 ,SR2a and SR0b is real in the majority of the
events, particularly for fake lepton background processes. By assuming that the highest
pT light lepton is always real, the dimension of the matrix is reduced from 88 to 44,
which can be rewritten in terms of the remaining sub-leading leptons (e//):
NLL
 =
12 1f2 f12 f1f2
1(1 2) 1(1 f2) f1(1 2) f1(1 f2)

(1 1)(1 2) (1 1)(1 f2) (1 f1)(1 2) (1 f1)(1 f2)
 
 , (7.9)
where:
  is the probability that a real-loose lepton is identified as a tight lepton, referred to
as real efficiencies;
 f is the probability that a fake-loose lepton is mis-identified as a tight lepton, referred
to as fake rates or fake efficiencies;

 NRR is the number of events with two real leptons, NRF + NFR is the number of

fake leptons;
 NTT , NTL , NLT and NLL , denote the number of events with two leptons with

the leading light lepton is always a true one, the MM only considers the other two
leptons (e//). L indicates loose leptons that fail the tight requirement.
In order to obtain the real composition (NRR) and fake composition (NFF ) of loose leptons,
the matrix must be inverted. This can be obtained if the efficiencies ( and f) are known.

(7.10)
Since the analysis uses signal selection leptons (tight leptons), an extra step to extra-
polate LL TT is needed to estimate the fake-tight leptons selection:
NLLTTFake = N
LLTT
RF +N
LLTT
FR +N

(7.11)
NLLTTRR = 12 NRR
NLLTTRF = 1f2 NRF
NLLTTFR = f12 NFR
NLLTTFF = f1f2 NFF .
(7.12)
The real lepton efficiencies and fake rates are measured in each SR and VR using MC
and corrected to those measured in data using scale factors. These are measured for
each lepton flavour as detailed below.
Real Lepton Efficiencies
The efficiency for real-loose leptons to satisfy the tight lepton requirements is measured on
MC-simulated data using a tag-and-probe method on Z  `` events with two loose light
leptons (e/) forming a SFOS pair with |mSFOS mZ | < 10 GeV. The tag light lepton
is required to satisfy the tight identification requirements and must be matched to the
relevant single-lepton trigger chain. The efficiency calculation is tested on the other light
lepton (the probe). Both light leptons are be considered as tags if they pass the tight
requirements. The real efficiencies are then corrected via scale factors, which are assumed
to be independent of the process, to account for potential differences with respect to the
data. These scale factors are taken as the ratio of the efficiency measured in data over the
efficiency measured in MC.
The real lepton efficiency scale factors for electrons and muons are found to be 0.998
0.013 and 0.996  0.001 respectively, where the uncertainties are statistical [1]. The real
tau efficiency scale factor is assumed to be 1.0.
Fake Lepton Efficiencies
The fake lepton efficiencies for loose leptons (` = e//) in a given region will depend
on: the type of the fake candidate (heavy flavour, light flavour, conversion); and the process
it originates from (top, Z+jets, V + , and diboson). These different behaviours will lead
to different fake estimates in SRs and VRs. To accounts for potential differences arising
from these behaviours and also for differences between data and simulation, scale factors
are introduced for each measured fake rate. The total estimate will be a weighted average
of the measured fake rates with the scale factors acting as weights, as in Equation 7.13,
fSR/V R = i,j(sf
i Rij
SR/V R
 f ij), (7.13)
where:
 the indices i indicate the fake type (LF, HF, CO) and j the process category the
fake originates from (top, Z+jets, V + , and diboson);
 sf i is the scale factor dependent only on the fake type.
 Rij
SR/V R
are the fake fractions measured as the ratio of fake leptons of type i origin-
ating from the process category j with respect to the total number of all fake leptons
from all processes, in a SR or VR. .
 f ij is the fake rate measured as the ratio between tight leptons and loose leptons of
a given type i and a originating process j.
The fake rates (f ij) for each relevant fake lepton type (HF, LF or CO) and for each
reducible background process are obtained using MC-simulated events with a three lepton
selection, where the leading light lepton is assumed real and the other two leptons enter
the calculation. These fake rates are parametrised with the lepton pT and  and are then
corrected using the scale factors described below.
Heavy Flavour scale factors: sfHF are measured as the ratio of the fake rate of HF
candidates in data over the fake rate in MC simulation.
The electron and muon HF fake rate scale factor is calculated using a tag-and-probe
method. In this case, the bb and cc production are chosen as the source of leptons
from heavy flavour decay. Selected events must pass standard quality criteria and
contain one tag muon within R< 0.4 from a b-tagged jet that fired the single-
muon trigger and one loose probe lepton (e/). To suppress background, events
are rejected if there is more than one b-jet in the event. The missing transverse
momentum for each event must be  60 GeV, and the transverse mass of the probe
lepton is  50 GeV. In data, any remaining background ( 1%) due to non heavy
flavour leptons is subtracted using the predictions from MC (these predictions include
all relevant processes normalised to the luminosity in the data). The fake rate is then
measured as the probability that the probe lepton passes the tight requirements.
The heavy-flavour scale factors found are: sfHFe = 0.74 0.04, sfHF = 0.89 0.03,
where the uncertainties are statistical [1]. Studies done in the trilepton analysis
group showed that HF tau fakes are negligible in three lepton regions, therefore this
value is taken to be sfHF = 1.0 with a 10% uncertainty, which is conservative with
respect to the other measured HF scale factors.
Light Flavour scale factors. Studies done in the trilepton analysis group showed that
LF electron and muon fakes are negligible in three lepton events[103] and so the LF
scale factors are taken as sfLF
= 1.0 with a conservative uncertainty of 10%. The
light flavour fake rate for taus is measured in a W+jets enriched region that is rich
in taus faked by quark jets. The same LF scale factor is applied also to fake rates of
taus from gluon jets. Taus faked by quark jets are seen to be the dominating source
of light flavour faked taus (by roughly a factor of 10) due to the larger fake rate
compared to those faked by gluon jets.
Selected events must contain one tight muon and an additional loose tau to derive
the LF tau fake rate. The muon is required to have fired the single isolated muon
trigger with pT > 25 GeV. Significant background suppression of the Z   decays
is obtained by requiring the transverse mass mT (,E
T ) > 60 GeV and
cos()
= cos((EmissT , )) + cos((E
T , ))  -0.15. In addition, a b-jet veto is applied
to separate the light and heavy flavour fake rates. The remaining background is
subtracted using a MC based estimate (method explained in the HF section).
The LF tau scale factors are separated into 1- and 3-prong taus due to observed
differences in the fake rates and scale factors. These scale factors decrease from 0.9
to 0.6 (1.0 to 0.6) for 1-prong (3-prong) taus as the pT increases from 20 GeV to
150 GeV, therefore a pT dependent scale factor is applied to correct the MC based
fake rates [1].
Conversions scale factors. The electron conversion fake rate is the probability that
a loose electron originating from a photon conversion passes the tight identification
requirements. The conversion scale factors are determined in events with a converted
photon radiated from a muon in Z   decays. Events passing the quality and
trigger requirements are requested to contain a pair of OS tight muons and one loose
electron (tag) such that the tri-lepton invariant mass, me, is compatible with the
Z boson hypothesis (81.2 <me< 101.2 GeV). A constraint on me helps suppress
contributions from jets in Z/+ jets processes. Additional fake contributions from
dibosons and tt samples are subtracted from the data during the calculation of the
fake rate (following the same procedure described in the HF section).
The conversion scale factor for electrons is sfCOe = 1.14  0.12. The background
from muons coming from electron conversion is considered to be negligible.
7.5.3 Validation of Background Estimation Method
To validate the background modelling, the MC estimates for irreducible backgrounds and
the data-driven estimates for the reducible backgrounds estimated in VRs are compared
to the observed data.
The definition of the VRs used in this analysis are shown in Table 7.5 with the re-
spective SM background(s) that each of them is sensitive to.
Table 7.5: Summary of the selection requirements for the validation regions.

VR2b 1 2 `  > 50 1 tt
Similarly to the tri-lepton SRs, VRs are distinguished in terms of tau multiplicity final
states (```, `` and ` VRs). For each considered  multiplicity, validation regions are
defined with either low-EmissT (a regions) or high-E
T + b-tagged jet (b regions)
to target different background processes. To validate the background model in the light
lepton SRs (SR0a/b), two different VRs are defined: a low-EmissT validation regions are
defined so that the dominant backgrounds, WZ and/or Z processes, are enhanced; and
a binned high-EmissT + b-jet validation region so that tt is enhanced. Additionally, VRs
with a Z-veto and a Z-request are also defined in the regions a and b. In the Z-veto
region, Z candidates are vetoed using an invariant mass window on the invariant mass
of the SFOS pair, thus reducing the Z  ``` contribution from Z+jets processes (where
the third lepton is a converted photon from final state radiation). Even though Z+jets
contribute very little to the total background estimate in light lepton SRs (due to high
EmissT requirements), by vetoing them in the VRs a better modelling of more relevant
backgrounds is achieved.
An orthogonal validation region (VR0b) to the light lepton binned signal region SR0a
is defined, by having the same binning as in Table 7.3 with the addition of a b-jet request.
Similarly, for tau-rich SRs, the VRs are split into low-EmissT and high-E
T + b-jet
selections. A same charge requirement of the light lepton pair in 1- VR regions is required
to remain close to SR1 .
The agreement between the background expectation and the data within statistical
and systematic uncertainties (described in the Section 7.6) can be seen in Table 7.6, in
which the reducible background is estimated with the MM and the irreducible is estimated
from MC. This indicates that the reducible background is well described by the matrix
method. The number of expected and observed events for all bins defined in VR0b can
be seen in Figure 7.16.
Table 7.6: Expected numbers of SM background events in selected validation regions,
as defined in table 7.5. The binned validation region VR0b is displayed in Figure 7.16.
Statistical and systematic uncertainties are included (as described in section 7.6).

Also, the agreement between the MC-only background expectation and the data within
statistical and systematic uncertainties (described in the Section 7.6) can be seen in
Table 7.7. This indicates that the SM background is moderately well described by the MC.
The MC-only expectation in the b regions is seen to agree well with the observed data.
However, in the a regions, the MC-only expectation is slightly lower than the observed
data in three out of four regions, due to small MC statistics in the reducible background
processes.

uncertainties on the SM prediction.
The following paragraphs show the most interesting kinematic distributions relevant
to each validation region (except for the binned VR, VR0b).

A few kinematic distributions in validation regions with three light leptons (VR0noZa,
VR0Za, VR0noZb and VR0Zb) are shown in Figures 7.17-7.20. Table 7.6 shows the
yields in these regions (using the MM estimates for the reducible background), where good
agreement is seen between data and the expected SM background. The shapes of these
kinematic variables are seen to agree well with data in VR0noZa, VR0Za, VR0noZb
and VR0Zb.

7.6 Systematic Uncertainties
A summary of the dominant sources of systematic uncertainties in the background and
signal estimates for each SR are listed in Table 7.8, where the component due to the
limited number of simulated events (also referred to as statistics) available in the MC-
simulated data is separated into both the reducible and irreducible background parts. In
SR0a, the leading systematic uncertainties are due to theoretical uncertainties on the
cross sections of the irreducible backgrounds, the choice of MC generator for the diboson
and ttV processes, and the statistical uncertainty on the irreducible and reducible back-
ground estimates. In SR0b, the theoretical cross section uncertainties on the irreducible
backgrounds dominates the overall uncertainty. In SR1 , the total uncertainty is mainly
dominated by uncertainties on the reducible background and the theoretical cross section
uncertainty on on the irreducible backgrounds. In the two tau signal regions SR2a and
SR2b, the total uncertainty is mainly dominated by the systematics that arise from the
fake background estimation, particularly from the tau fake rate measurements described
in Section 7.5.2 and the statistical uncertainties.
Table 7.8: Summary of the dominant systematic uncertainties in the background estimates
for each SR defined in Section 7.4. Uncertainties are quoted relative to the total expected
background. For the 20 bins of the SR0a the range of the uncertainties is provided.

7.6.1 Uncertainties on the Irreducible Background
Theoretical uncertainties affecting the simulation-based background estimates used for the
analysis presented in this thesis are detailed in the following.
MC Cross Section. Theoretical cross section uncertainties on the irreducible background
processes due to the choice of re-normalisation, factorisation scales and PDFs are
summarised below:
 a 30% systematic on the production cross section of tt+ Z(/W/WW ) at NLO
is applied based on the resulted in ref. [89, 90];
 5% for ZZ and 7% for WZ production cross section has been applied based on
the predictions in ref. [113];
 100% uncertainty is assumed as a conservative approach for triboson processes
since there are no measurements yet;
The Higgs boson production cross sections are calculated with varying precision in
the perturbative expansion. For total cross sections, the calculations are performed
up to the NNLO QCD correction (and NLO electroweak corrections) for the following
production modes: gg  H, qq  qqH and qq  WH/ZH processes, while up to
NLO for qq/gg  ttH process.
 20% uncertainty is used for V H and V BF production, while a 100% uncertainty
is assigned to ttH and ggF production, based on studies detailed in Ref. [97].
The uncertainty for ttH and ggF production are assumed to be large to account
for uncertainties on the acceptance, while the inclusive cross-sections are known
to better precision.
MC Generator Systematic uncertainties arising from the choice of MC generator used
to simulate the irreducible SM processes are estimated by comparing the acceptance
in the SR between two different MC generators. For WZ,ZZ diboson processes, the
comparison is done between Powheg (main generator) and aMC@NLO samples.
For the tt+Z/W background processes, events generated using MadGraph (main
generator) are compared to those simulated in Alpgen. The generator systematic
uncertainties found to be in a range from 3-35% in regions without a hadronic tau
requirement in the final state, whereas the regions which do have this requirement
have a systematic uncertainty of around 1-6%.
PDF The acceptance uncertainty due to PDFs was also estimated for the diboson irre-
ducible background.
These PDF uncertainties are estimated using 90% confidence level CT10 PDF eigen-
vectors [114]. The CT10 PDF set is based on 26 free parameters and the resulting
90% confidence level upper and lower variations in these parameters form the error
set for the PDF. The asymmetric positive and negative uncertainties of the PDFs
(fa) are computed as
+[f ] =
 26
(max[(f+i  f0), (f
i  f0), 0])2,
[f ] =
 26
(max[(f0  f+i ), (f0  f
i ), 0])
(7.14)
C90 = 1.64485 is a re-scaling factor to convert the 90% CL variations into 1 vari-
ations and f0 is the nominal eigenvector value.
The impact of the PDF uncertainties on the acceptance was found to be negligible
(< 3%).
The experimental systematic uncertainties on the SM backgrounds estimated with MC-
simulated data considered in the analysis presented here are described in the following.
Luminosity. The uncertainty of the total integrated luminosity for 2012 data collected
by the ATLAS detector is found to be 2.8% [115], where this uncertainty is estimated
by evaluating the luminosity scale using several luminosity- sensitive detectors, and
comparisons are made of the long-term stability and accuracy of this calibration
applied to the pp collisions for a given luminosity.
Pile-up. In the 2012 MC-simulated data, events with a certain  have a number of
primary vertices comparable with data by 1.11. Therefore, the uncertainty on
the MC modelling of the pile-up is provided by assessing the up- and down-variation
of the scale factor 1/1.11 .
Trigger. A conservative systematic uncertainty of 5% is assigned to the trigger simulation
used in this analysis, to account for any differences in efficiency observed between
the trigger in data and the MC trigger simulation. Particularly, the studies were
performed by evaluating muon and electron triggering efficiency derived in data
and MC simulation using a tag-and-probe method with Z+jets events [103]. These
studies were performed for all single and dilepton triggers available in data in 2012.
b-tagging efficiency. Uncertainties arising from a b-jet identification and mis-identification
(charm and light-flavour jet rejection) efficiency are also taken into account in this
analysis. ATLAS developed calibration methods based on tt events to exploit their
large b-jet content, where the efficiencies are found to be jet pT dependent. Scale
factors with this jet pT dependence are derived to correct the performance of the
b-tagging in simulation to the one observed in data. The total uncertainties range
from 5% to 15% for jet pT in the range 25 GeV to 300 GeV [116]. These uncertainties
are found to be  1% for all SRs described in this document.
Electrons. Uncertainties on the electron identification efficiencies, energy scales and res-
olutions are determined using Z  ee, W  e and J/  ee events in data [60].
The reconstructed energy of electrons, referred to as Electron Energy Scale (EES), is
determined by applying an in-situ calibration dependant on ET and . The corres-
ponding Electron Energy Resolution (EER) uncertainties are also taken into account
after the calibration is applied by comparing the di-electron mass spectrum in the
Z, J/  ee decays. Lastly, an uncertainty based on the electron identification ef-
ficiency (ESF) measurements is applied to all electrons which satisfy the signal
criteria described in 6.2.1.
Muons. Uncertainties on the muon identification efficiencies, energy scales and resolu-
tions are determined using Z   events in data [64]. The effect of the uncertainty
on the muon momentum scale in the inner detector track and the muon spectrometer
track has been studied for both combined and segment-tagged muons. The muon
momentum scale is calibrated by comparing the invariant mass spectrum of the
J/  and Z   decays between simulation and data. A smearing correction
is derived to match the MC simulated di-muon mass resolution to the one measured
in data. The uncertainty based on the muon identification efficiency measurements
is applied to all muons which satisfy the signal criteria described in 6.2.2.
Taus. The systematic uncertainties on the hadronic tau energy scale (TES) were eval-
uated by combining individual visible decay products, namely neutral and charged
pions [117]. These single particle uncertainties are given by an in-situ measurement
comparing calorimeter energy measurements to momenta measured in the ID. The
propagated uncertainty is also validated with studies using Z   decays. An
uncertainty in the Tau Identification Scale Factor (TIDSF) is applied to all true
signal taus in the event, is provided which accounts for the uncertainties from the
BDT identification: jet-BDT and the electron-veto.
Jets. Uncertainties arising from the jet energy scale calibration and resolution are derived
from a combination of simulated data, in-situ measurements and test-beam data. In
particular, jet energy and angle corrections are determined from MC simulations to
calibrate jets with transverse momenta greater than 20 GeV and pseudorapidities
|| < 4.5; and the jet energy scale systematic uncertainty is estimated using the
single-isolated hadron response measured in-situ and in test-beams, exploiting the
transverse momentum balance between central and forward jets in events with di-jet
events and studying systematic variations in MC simulations.
These uncertainties due to jet identification were found to be negligible in the SR
presented here.
Missing Transverse Energy Measurement. The EmissT is affected by various uncer-
tainties coming from energy measurements of the physics objects that are taken as
input in the calculation described in Section 6.2.5. Any variation in the electron,
muon and/or jet energies will directly propagate to the EmissT calculation. The un-
certainty associated with the soft term of the E
miss,CellOut
T is estimated by adjusting
the energy scale (5%) and resolution of this term [102]. The uncertainties arising
from the measurement of EmissT is seen to be negligible in the SR discussed in this
thesis.
7.6.2 Uncertainties on the Reducible Background
Systematic uncertainties on the reducible background estimated with the data-driven tech-
nique, the matrix method, can be classified into systematics arising from the various
components entering the calculation on the weighted average fake rates defined in Equa-
tion 7.13: on the fake rate and real lepton efficiencies (f and  respectively), the scale
factors fake rates (sf), and the fake fractions (R), defined in Section 7.5.2. Below is a
discussion of these sources of systematic uncertainties affecting the final estimate of the
reducible background.
f and  Efficiencies . The measured fake rate and real lepton efficiencies are taken from
MC-simulated events which are corrected for any discrepancies with respect to data.
These efficiencies showed a dependence on pT,  and the number of  prongs, there-
fore parametrised in these three kinematic variables. The dependency of these effi-
ciencies on variables used in the event selection of the signal regions were thoroughly
investigated by the 3L analysis team. The source of systematic uncertainties due to
a dependence on other important event kinematics not taken into account by the
parametrisation range between: EmissT (07%), mT (17%), m
T2 (018%), mSFOS
(018%), SFOS veto (05%), and  (15%) in the SR.
Fake Rate SF. The measurement of the fake rate scale factors for the different fake
sources showed no strong dependence in pT, ||, and number of good vertices. There-
fore, they are fitted to a constant function. The central values of the scale factors
are calculated without parametrisation on any variable and the differences with re-
spect to the results of the fit in these three variables are assigned as a systematic
uncertainty of the order of 5%.
Fake Fractions. The uncertainty on the fake fractions originates from a potential lack of
knowledge of the relative contributions of a certain type of physics process in a given
region (SR/VR). This uncertainty is covered by varying the yields of the physics
processes by the following amounts: top processes by 50%, diboson processes by
50%, and V+jets processes by 30%.
Also included in the uncertainty on the reducible background is the the statistical uncer-
tainty on the data events, used to apply the matrix equation and the statistical uncertainty
from the fake rates measured in simulation.
7.6.3 Uncertainties on the Signal
The systematic uncertainties on the SUSY signal processes also include theoretical uncer-
tainties on the calculated NLO cross sections, due to envelope of cross-section predictions
using different PDF sets and factorisation and re-normalisation scales. These theoretical
systematic uncertainties on all signal processes are evaluated by varying the factorisation
and re-normalisation scales in PROSPINO and are calculated using the method described
in ref. [118]. The uncertainties on the signal are in the 20-40% range, including the un-
certainties due to the sources considered above for the irreducible background and the
uncertainty due to limited Monte Carlo statistics.
Chapter 8
Results
In Chapter 7, the analysis strategy developed for the search for SUSY events in three
lepton final states has been described. This chapter presents the interpretation of the
results obtained, starting with an introduction of the statistical tools used, followed by an
assessment of compatibility between the expected SM background and the observed events
in data in all signal regions, finishing with the statistical interpretation of the results for
each SUSY model considered.
8.1 Statistical Analysis Tools
The way to assess the statistical significance of the number of observed events in data
with respect to the expected background is to define the probability that the observation
agrees with the background-only hypothesis (H0) or with the signal+background hypo-
thesis (H1) [109]. The so-called p-values for H0 and H1 are defined by:
p0 = P (q  qobs|H0) =
 qobs
f(q|b)dq
p1 = P (q  qobs|H1) =
f(q|s+ b)dq
(8.1)
where f(q|b) and f(q|s+b) are the probability density functions (pdfs) of the test statistic
q, and qobs is the observed result. The test statistic is a scalar quantity representative of
the experiment. An illustration of both pdfs as a function of the test statistic is shown in
Figure 8.1 along with their corresponding one-sided p-values.
A given signal hypothesis, corresponding in this case to a given SUSY model, is
considered to be excluded when p1  0.05, i.e. the probability of wrongly excluding the
hypothesis is 5%. One can also say that the hypothesis is excluded at 95% Confidence
Level (CL), which is equivalent to a value of ZN (see Equation 7.1) of 1.64 .
Figure 8.1: Distribution of the pdf of a test statistic (q) for background-only and sig-
nal+background hypotheses [109].
For the case where no excess is observed above the expected SM background then the
alternative hypothesis (signal+background), predicted by some new physics model, can be
excluded. This can be done by using the CLs prescription [119, 120]. The CLs is defined
as a ratio of p-values (in order to prevent inconsistencies from cases when the signal yields
are low):
CLs =
CLs+b
, (8.2)
where s is the expected signal,
CLs+b = P (q  qobs|s+ b), (8.3)
CLb = P (q  qobs|b). (8.4)
Using this, a given hypothesis can be excluded if CLs  0.05.
Another procedure used for the exclusion of hypothesis is performed using a likelihood
ratio [121] as a test statistic, which incorporates systematic uncertainties in its calculation.
Starting for the case where there are n events measured in each signal region, with s signal
and b background expected events, the expectation value for n can be written as
E[n] = s+ b (8.5)
where  is a strength parameter (  = 0 for background-only and  = 1 for signal+background
hypothesis). A resulting likelihood function can be constructed as a product of Poisson
probabilities, one for each signal region,
L(, ) =
(si + bi)
e(si+bi) (8.6)
where the systematic uncertainties enter the likelihood calculation as nuisance parameters,
, which must be simultaneously fitted from the data. To determine a value for , the
likelihood function (see Equation 8.6) has to be maximised, which can be achieved by
using the likelihood ratio as:
() =
L(, )
L(, )
(8.7)
where  and  are the maximum likelihood estimators, value which maximises L(, ); and
 denotes the value of  that maximises L given a specified . The inclusion of nuisance
parameters broadens the profile likelihood distribution as a function of  with respect to
a function with fixed values.
The compatibility with the SM, upper limits on the expected and observed number
of beyond-the-SM events and the exclusion limits obtained considering the events seen in
data are assessed with a profile likelihood ratio test statistic. For the interpretation of the
observed results in this analysis, the profile likelihood used is of the form
L(n|, b,) = Pois(n|(, b,))  PSys(0,)
where parameter n represents the number of observed events in data, P (n|) a Poisson
distribution modelling the expected event count in the SR, given an expectation value
. The parameter  is the SUSY signal strength to be tested, b is the background,
and  describes the systematic uncertainties as nuisance parameters. PSys represents
the constraints on systematic uncertainties and 0 are the nominal values around which
 can be varied, for example when maximising the likelihood. PSys is the product of
Gaussian distributions with  = 1 (one Gaussian for each nuisance parameter). The
modelling of the likelihood, calculation of the CLs and p-values, were performed using the
ATLAS HistFitter package (version HistFitter-00-00-33) [119, 109], a tool able to perform
likelihood fits and their statistical interpretation.
8.2 Observed Events in Signal Regions
The observed number of events in all signal regions along with the total background
expectations and uncertainties are shown in Table 8.1 (full breakdown can be found in
App A). The quoted uncertainties include both the statistical and systematic components,
as described in Section 7.6.

events in all signal regions for 20.3 fb1. Statistical and systematic uncertainties are in-
cluded as described in section 7.6.

In order to quantify the probability of the background-only hypothesis to fluctuate to
the observed number of events or higher, the one-sided p0-value is calculated (truncated to
0.5 for p0 > 0.5). Also, upper limits at 95% CL on the expected and observed number of
beyond the SM events (N95exp and N
obs) for each signal region are calculated using the CLs
prescription. For both of these calculations the profile likelihood ratio is used as a test
statistic. The p0 and CLs values are calculated using pseudo-experiments (also referred
to as toys). A full description of these is given in Section 8.1.
Tables 8.2-8.3 shows the p0-values of the background-only hypothesis and the the upper
limits at 95% CL on the expected and observed number of BSM (signal) events for each
signal region. Some fluctuations are visible in the binned SRs, particularly for SR0a-
bin01, when 23  4 expected events have to be compared with 36 observed events. The
local p0-value for this bin is 0.015 corresponding to a significance of 2.16. Fluctuations
are to be expected whenever the binning approach is implemented on a variable, i.e. the
p-values are calculated locally (per bin) rather than globally, which can cause over- or
under-fluctuations [122].

It is important to highlight the signal shape feature seen in the mmaxT2 distribution
(see Figure 8.5(a)), where at high values of mmaxT2 there is a clear separation from the
SM background. This shows the importance of this particular variable when it came to
defining SR2a.

The number of observed events is consistent with the SM expectation in all signal
regions, within uncertainties. Since no significant excess is observed, these results are used
to derive exclusion limits on the simplified and pMSSM models described in section 2.2.
8.3 Statistical Interpretation
Exclusion limits are calculated by statistically combining results from a number of dis-
joint signal regions in order to obtain maximum exclusion. SR2a and SR2b are not
disjointed, hence only one of the two must be chosen for the combination based on the
highest sensitivity provided for the model studied. For the L-mediated, WZ-mediated and
L-mediated simplified models and for the pMSSM scenarios, SR0a, SR0b, SR1 and
SR2a are statistically combined. For the Wh-mediated simplified model, the statistical
combination of SR0a, SR0b, SR1 and SR2b is used.
For the exclusion limits, the observed and expected 95% CL limit contours are calcu-
lated using MC pseudo-experiments for each SUSY model point, taking into account the
theoretical and experimental uncertainties on the SM background and the experimental
uncertainties on the signal, exp, as well as the Poissonian fluctuations on the number
of observed events. The yellow bands in the figures for the exclusion contours show the
impact of 1 variations of exp on the expected limit. The theoretical uncertainties on
the signal cross section, SUSYtheory, are not included, however, their impact is shown as the
1 variation bands (red dashed lines) on the observed limit.
8.3.1 Model Dependent Interpretation: Simplified Models
Figure 8.6 shows the L-mediated simplified model interpretation, where the masses of the
degenerate 1 and 
2 are excluded up to 700 GeV. In the WZ-mediated simplified model
shown in figure 8.7, 1 and 
2 masses are excluded up to 345 GeV.
The over- (under-) fluctuations in the observed results in the signal regions lead to a
weaker (stronger) observed exclusion limits with respect to the expected for the compressed
scenarios (small m02
m01) in both the
L-mediated and WZ-mediated simplified models.
The two exclusion limits shown in Figures 8.6-8.7 improve those reported by the previ-
ous ATLAS publication [103], also shown in the figures as a blue line. For the L-mediated
simplified model and the WZ-mediated simplified model, an improvement of 200 GeV
for high 1 and 
2 masses is seen.

In the L-mediated simplified model, the region with high-mSFOS bins in SR0a (i.e.
SR0a-bin20) offers the best sensitivity to scenarios with high 1 and 
2 masses, and the
low-mSFOS bins in SR0a to scenarios where the m02
m01 is small. In the WZ-mediated
simplified model, SR0a-bin16 offers the best sensitivity to scenarios with high 1 and 
masses, and SR0a-bin01 to scenarios where the m02
m01 is small. There is a reduced
sensitivity to scenarios in the m02
 m01 = mZ region as the signal populates regions
with high WZ background. These statements are verified by computing the observed
and expected CLs values, which are shown in Figure 8.8, for the L- and WZ-mediated
simplified models using only bins SR0a-bin20 and SR0a-bin16 respectively.

The low mSFOS SR0a bins offer the best sensitivity to the small m02
m01 scenarios
in the L-mediated simplified model, and SR2a to the high-mass 
1 , 
2 scenarios. The
results in the low mSFOS SR0a bins lead to a weaker observed exclusion than expected for
the compressed scenarios. In case of the Wh-mediated simplified model, regions SR0a,
SR0b, SR1 and SR2b jointly offer the best sensitivity. The over-fluctuations in the
observed results in some SR0a bins and SR1 , which were specifically designed to provide
sensitivity to this model, are responsible for the observed exclusion contour being slightly
weaker than the expected. These statements are verified by computing the observed
and expected CLs values, which are shown in Figure 8.11, for the L- and Wh-mediated
simplified models using only bins SR2a and SR2b respectively.

8.3.2 Model Dependent Interpretation: pMSSM
In the pMSSM scenarios, for a given value of M1 , the sensitivity for high values of M2 and
, and therefore for high values of chargino and heavy neutralino (not the LSP) masses,
is driven by the decrease of the production cross section.
Figures 8.12-8.15 show the exclusion contours for pMSSM R scenarios and the pMSSM
R scenario, which have limited sensitivity in the regions with M1M2, due to small
m02
m01 or m1 m01 . Values for the masses of 
1 and 
1 are shown in the figure as
gray isolines.
In the case of the pMSSM R with M1 = 250 GeV and R scenarios shown in Figure 8.14
and Figure 8.15 respectively, the small mass splittings (m
 m01) also reduces the
sensitivity in the M1    M2 region. In particular, the pMSSM R scenario with
M1 = 250 GeV, the M2 & 250 GeV and  & 250 GeV, a region characterised by small
1 ,
 m01 , due to the over-fluctuation seen in SR0a-bin01 the observed exclusion
region is significantly smaller than that expected.
For the pMSSM no  scenarios (Figures 8.16), in the region with M2 & 200 GeV
and  & 200 GeV the decay mode 02  h
1 is kinematically allowed and reduces the
sensitivity due to its branching ratios into three light lepton final states.

Chapter 9
Conclusion
This thesis summarises the work done during my PhD at the University of Sussex on
the search at ATLAS for the production of charginos and neutralinos decaying into final
states with three leptons (e//) and missing transverse momentum. The analysis was
performed using 20.3 fb1 of the
s = 8 TeV proton-proton collision data delivered by the
LHC and recorded with the ATLAS detector in 2012. The results presented in Chapter 8
show no significant excess of events above SM expectations with respect to what was found
in data. These are interpreted in different simplified SUSY models and in various pMSSM
scenarios, detailed in Section 2.2.1. For the simplified SUSY models with intermediate
slepton decays, degenerate 1 and 
2 masses up to 700 GeV are excluded for large mass
differences with the 1 , while for the simplified SUSY models with gauge boson (W,Z)
decays, the mass exclusion limit reaches 345 GeV. These limits improve upon the previous
ATLAS results in ref [103] by almost 200 GeV. For the newly explored simplified SUSY
models with intermediate staus, degenerate 1 and 
2 masses up to 380 GeV are excluded,
while for the simplified SUSY models with intermediate Higgs boson decays, degenerate
1 and 
2 masses up to 148 GeV are excluded.
This analysis has been published in a refereed paper [1] in April 2014.

Improvements to the ATLAS
offline shifter Tools
This section introduces the technical work done in order to obtain the ATLAS authorship
qualification. The main purpose of this task was to add and improve features of some of
the main tools available for the so-called trigger offline shifts. In these shifts the quality
of the data collected by the ATLAS detector is thoroughly analysed to identify failures in
the data processing with the ATLAS trigger, in particular in those areas where the trigger
fails to promptly categorise events during data taking.
B.1 Offline Data Quality
For each physics object, one or more trigger objects can be defined (, , e, , jet,
b-tagged jet and EmissT ); given the complexity of the ATLAS trigger system, thorough
monitoring of the performance of these trigger objects is vital. A data quality assessment
of the events as soon as they are collected by the experiments was developed and deployed
successfully in 2011, including tools which tested the analysis of events whilst data taking
(online analysis) as well as the events produced after standard reconstruction is performed
(offline analysis). The online data quality analysis focuses on major failures in the system
and corrects them instantly, while the offline part is used to verify the online assessment
and also to perform a more detailed analysis and filter out unsuitable data for physics
analyses.
B.2 Debug Stream
Data for which the HLT failed to make a decision are automatically streamed into an
output category known as the debug stream. Events that fire the debug stream are
still considered for analysis, based on the assumption that only a small fraction of those
events are unsuitable for physics. The offline data quality assessment ensures that all debug
stream events are recovered after reprocessing of the raw data with validated improvements
in the trigger configuration, and also provides tools to distinguish between known and
unknown problems during data taking, which can help understand the behaviour of the
trigger.
Events where an error is detected at the level of the trigger are sent to the debug stream
for further evaluation. These are events where one or more trigger algorithms failed, and
therefore a trigger decision is not possible. These trigger events can be categorised as
type L2 or EF, depending on which stage these events ended up in the debug stream. For
example, very busy events (large pileup, large number of tracks, etc) can cause a timeout
in the execution of the trigger algorithm. A list of the most frequent debug stream errors
found in in 2011 and 2012 are listed in Table B.1.
Table B.1: Main types of debug stream errors.

EFHLTError EF Severe algorithm errors at EF, which abort the event processing.
EFHltTimeout EF Event algorithm timeouts at EF, usually can be recovered.
EFMissingData EF Major problem that leads to all events ending up in the debug stream.
Events in the debug stream are analysed offline to study problems in the online system
caused by the trigger. Such information is provided in detail with the dedicated tools for
the analysis of debug stream events, which are aimed to promptly identify problems and
while doing so, reducing the turn-around time for fixing these problems in future data
taking. Debug stream analysis tools produce several histograms needed for online and
offline systems, however, this document will focus only on the description of some of the
tools and histograms used during 2012. These are described in the following sections.
B.2.1 Automatic debug stream defect and web interface
The first part of my qualification task involved producing many debug stream analysis
histograms by using legacy code as well as developed code. The analysis involved assessing
whether there were too many events in the debug stream, i.e. more than 5% of the total
number of events per luminosity block. In such cases, the production of a new histogram
would take place, which contained information of the ratio of debug stream events and
total events, clearly highlighting the luminosity block and run number for data with such
feature. Finally an automated email notification to the expert shifters mailing list was sent
out in these instances to warn the shifter and have him/her take immediate action. These
plots were included along with the default histograms for the debug stream analysis in the
official ATLAS trigger offline monitoring web-pages. The web-pages were also redesigned
as part of my technical work, this re-design was motivated mainly to highlight the relevant
information for the shifter without inspecting an overwhelming number of histograms by
hand. An example of such plot is shown in Figure B.1.
Figure B.1: Percentage of debug stream events in a given luminosity block [123].
These features were in place and fully functional throughout Run2.
B.2.2 New debug stream analysis histograms
Generally, one of the most useful things a shifter could know is whether a specific type
of debug stream error was understood or even known. This motivated the need for a
histogram with the error history over a relevant time period, in this case we set this to be
60 runs (also for cosmetic reasons). An example of a history plot is shown in Figure B.2.
The y-axis incorporates the elements of Figure B.1 by showing the percentage of debug
stream events.
Figure B.2: Debug stream error history plot. [123].
These features were in place and fully functional throughout Run2.
