Monte Carlo Simulations of Heavy Particles for
the Large Hadron Collider

Abstract
As the Large Hadron Collider has switched on at CERN in Geneva, accurate predic-
tions for complex hadronic processes are essential for the validation of theory and
therefore the success of the machine. After motivating the requirement for a Monte
Carlo event generator, the principles and Physics behind such a generator are laid
Following this, the Monte Carlo tuning system Professor is used to give an assess-
ment of the uncertainty from tuning Herwig++ and the results from this analysis
used, along with a more accurate implementation of Higgs boson decays using the
POWHEG method, to determine the error associated with searching for the Higgs
boson with a jet substructure technique.
Then, modifications to the shower to take into account the top quark width are
presented along with radiation patterns from top quark production processes for up
to two external gluons. A general algorithm is outlined for systematically including
these corrections.
Finally, as the LHC is ultimately a discovery machine, it is pertinent to provide
Monte Carlo studies of new Physics. The colour sextet diquark model is looked at
in the final chapter of this thesis, and the associated phenomenology studied.

Acknowledgements
Firstly I would like to thank my supervisor Peter Richardson. I have enjoyed work-
ing with Peter and without his guidance, help and endless patience this thesis would
never have been written.
I am also thankful to other members of the Herwig++ collaboration for all their
help, in particular David Grellscheid for all his help with any computing issues I
may have had and for taking the time to explain the solutions to my problems. I
hope the collaboration continues to go from strength to strength.
I would also like to thank all members of the IPPP who have made my time there so
enjoyable. This especially includes my office mates Steven and James who have had
to endure my endless cursing at the computer and other general problems whilst
also using them as a sounding board.
Finally I would like to say how much those closest in my life are appreciated. Firstly,
my parents -without your love and support I wouldnt be anywhere close to where I
am today - thank you. And finally to my fiancee Georgie, who probably now knows
more about the Grid than any non-Physicist in the country, this is it.
All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace
I like to think (and
the sooner the better)
of a cybernetic meadow
where mammals and computers
live together in mutually
programming harmony
like pure water
touching clear sky.
I like to think
(right now, please)
of a cybernetic forest
filled with pines and electronics
where deer stroll peacefully
past computers
as if they were flowers
with spinning blossoms.
I like to think
(it has to be)
of a cybernetic ecology
where we are free of our labors
and joined back to nature,
returned to our mammal
brothers and sisters,
and all watched over
by machines of loving grace.

singularities with the incoming quarks at 0o and 180o. These features
are repeated in the other radiation patterns we will display here. We

Chapter 1
Introduction
The Standard Model (SM) was first written down over thirty years [911] ago and is
arguably the crown jewel in mans achievments. It is a theory of almost everything,
except for gravity, and its ability to explain and predict experimental observables is
both monumental and problematic. It is monumental in that it has been tested and
verified repeatedly at collider experiments, and problematic as it does not include
gravity. In this chapter the basics of the SM are outlined along with how calculations
are performed.
Providing links to theory at modern collider experiments, with their complex
hadronic final states, requires a Monte Carlo event generator. These tools provide
a theoretical description in a form that can be used to describe real world collider
events, such as at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva. They
provide the simulation of physical processes and therefore an ability to compare
experiment and theory. Without Monte Carlo event generators, the experimental
programme would not be able to interpret the results and relate the observed results
to fundamental theory. Later in this chapter the principles behind a Monte Carlo
event generator are detailed.
1.1. The Standard Model 2
1.1 The Standard Model
1.1.1 Symmetries
The SM is based entirely on symmetries that can be explained with the Mathematics
of group and gauge theories. In fact, the SM is actually an
SU(3)  SU(2)  U(1) gauge theory. To understand the ideas behind gauge the-
ory we first turn to the example of Electromagnetism, which was the first gauge
theory to be discovered.
Electromagnetism
In Electromagnetism, one can talk about the electric field E or equivalently the
vector potential , and the magnetic field B, or the scalar potential A. These are
related by
E =  A
, (1.1.1a)
B = A . (1.1.1b)
A simple transformation of the fields
  
, (1.1.2a)
A A + , (1.1.2b)
where  = (x, t) leave the original field equations in Eqn. 1.1.1 unchanged, as
   = 0. Here we have performed a gauge transformation, by shifting the
potentials that the E and B fields depend on by an arbitrary amount whilst leaving
the E and B fields themselves unchanged i.e. A and  are not unique for a given E
and B [12]. By writing
A = (,A) , (1.1.3)
we may write the gauge transformation more compactly as
A  A   , (1.1.4)
and we may more compactly write the current as
j = (, j) . (1.1.5)
1.1. The Standard Model 3
This allows us to write Maxwells equations in the form
 = j , (1.1.6)
where we have introduced the electromagnetic field strength tensor
F  = A  A , (1.1.7)
which is also a gauge-invariant quantity. It is these principles that guide us in
building our theory of Particle Physics.
This still leaves us with the question of how to actually construct a theory.
Again, we are driven by what symmetries we wish our theory to obey and from
that, what we are allowed to write down. So other than choosing which particles we
wish to describe, we must also choose what symmetries we wish these particles to
obey. Only then may we write down the most general invariant Langrangian with
these particles, obeying these symmetries, as our theory.
Guided by past principles, it is clear that for the theory of the SM, one symmetry
we will always require is that our theory be Lorentz invariant. We also further con-
strain the theory by requiring it to be renormalizable - where the renormalizability
is related to the short distance divergences in the theory.
When performing calculations at one-loop level and beyond, divergences arise at
large momentum scales, i.e. short distances. The renormalizability of the theory
means that we can reabsorb these divergences into the bare parameters of the theory,
leaving it finite at short distances.1 With regards to writing down our theory, in
practice this means not writing down any operators with a mass/energy dimension
greater than four in the Lagrangian. We will discuss renormalization more later in
this chapter.
Following on, from the example of Electromagnetism, we turn now to Quantum
Electrodynamics (QED) as a further simple example of gauge invariance and gauge
symmetry where we will see that the gauge symmetry gives rise to the interactions
between the particles of the theory, and where the gauge bosons act as the force

symmetry [13,14].

carriers. From this, we will then go on to discuss the more complicated non-Abelian
case of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).
Quantum Electrodynamics
We start with the Dirac Langragian which is written as a sum over the fermions
LDirac =
i (i
 mi)i . (1.1.8)
LDirac has the property of being invariant under the global U(1) transformation
i  eii , (1.1.9)
but if we promote this symmetry to be local so that now
i  ei(x)i , (1.1.10)
we destroy the invariance, as the derivative acts on the (x) term in the exponent.
To restore the invariance of the Lagrangian under the local gauge transformation,
we introduce a new vector field, A, which has the following kinetic term
LMaxwell = 
F F , (1.1.11)
where as before, F  = AA. The fields therefore transform under the local
gauge transformation as
i  ei(x)i , (1.1.12a)
A  A 
(x) . (1.1.12b)
We replace the usual derivative  with the covariant derivative D   + ieA
and we have the QED Lagrangian
LQED =
i (i
D mi)i 
F F , (1.1.13)
which is invariant under the gauge transformation Eqn. 1.1.12. Note that a mass
term for A such as m
, is not permitted as it would not be invariant under
the gauge transformations. We can therefore say that the new field we introduced,
A, is identified as the photon and the interaction of the photon with the fermions in
the theory depends on the expansion of the covariant derivative, where the photon
field lies, acting on the spinors. The strength of this coupling is dictated by the size
of e, which is the charge of the positron [15,16].
1.1. The Standard Model 5
1.1.2 Quantum Chromodynamics
Before formulating the theory, we recall that for a general group G which is a set
with an operator, then there are four basic axioms for the group which are2
1. Closure - a  b = c where {a, b, c}  G;
2. Associativity - if {a, b, c}  G then a  (b  c) = (a  b)  c;
3. Identity - there is an element of the group such that a  I = I  a = a;
4. Inverse - for any element in the group a then there is an element a1 such that
a  a1 = I.
We have already seen a U(1) group in the formulation of QED i.e. the circle group
which act as rotations on the complex plane. The procedure followed in QED can
be applied in general and the natural extension is to a non-Abelian theory, where
the charge is a non-Abelian quantity. The QCD Langrangian is derived in this way
(we follow here the formalism in Ref. [18, 19]) and is built on the SU(3) Lie group.
It is in the non-Abelian nature of this theory that will give rise to self interactions
of the gauge bosons. It is therefore important to understand some of the general
properties of an SU(NC) group, which we review briefly now.
A general SU(NC) group consists of NC  NC unitary matrices with a unit
determinant. The dimension of the group is N2C  1 and so there are N2C  1
traceless and hermitian group generators. In the case of SU(3) these are often
given by the Gell-Mann3 matrices. We do not state the Gell-Mann matrices here,
however, for SU(2) which the Electroweak theory is built upon, we often use the Pauli
matrices. There is generally more than one representation of the group. The simplest
representation is called the fundamental representation, where the generators of the
group give the group transformations.
Following the group axioms, we expect operations between group elements to
return an element in the group. The richness of the theory comes from the generators
2An excellent introduction to groups for Particle Physics can be found in Ref. [17].
3It was Murray Gell-Mann that chose the naming of the fundamental particles quarks.
1.1. The Standard Model 6
obeying the commutator (or Lie bracket) [18]
tA, tB
= ifABCtC , (1.1.14)
where fABC are called the structure constants of the group. The generators and
Lie bracket form what is called the Lie algebra. The structure constants are num-
bers that can be determined for SU(3) and we state them as the completely anti-
symmetric tensor, ijk, for SU(2), which the Electroweak theory is built on. Using
Eqn. 1.1.14 and the trivial relation
tA, tB
tB, tC
tC , tA
= 0 (1.1.15)
we get the Jacobi identity
fABDfDCE + fBCDfDAE + fCADfDBE = 0 . (1.1.16)
From this we see that the structure constants themselves also obey the group
transformation forming an important representation of the group called the ad-
joint representation, where the generators of the adjoint representation are TA(BC) =
ifABC [18].
As we will be using many relations of SU(3), which is of interest in building
QCD, we cite here the conventions for the normalization of the matrices, which is
such that [18]
Tr(tAtB) = TR
AB, TR =
. (1.1.17)
This means the colour matrices of SU(3) obey
Tr(tAtA) = tAmbt
bn = CF mn, CF =
N2C  1
, (1.1.18)
which we will make use of throughout this thesis, and for the adjoint representation
Tr(TCTD) =
fABCfABD = CA
CD, CA = NC , (1.1.19)
i.e. CF =
and CA = 3 for NC = 3. We may now use this knowledge to derive the
QCD Lagrangian, where we start like in QED with the Dirac Lagrangian, here for
quarks
LDirac =
qa (i
 m) qa . (1.1.20)
1.1. The Standard Model 7
where now our index a runs over the NC = 3 quark colours, we have an explicit sum
over the quark types and we introduce a non-Abelian symmetry that transforms the
fields by
qa  ()abqb , (1.1.21)
where  = (x) are the parameters of the transformation and we note that the
transformation carries indices itself [19] i.e.
()ab = exp
iA(x)t
(1.1.22)
where the tAab are the generators of the SU (NC) group and the index A runs over
the N2C  1 generators of the group.
To make the QCD Langrangian invariant under local transformations as in
Eqn. 1.1.21, we proceed as before by introducing N2C  1 gauge fields G
ab = G
and replace  with the covariant derivative D
ab  ab + igsG
ab, where gs is the
strong coupling. The new fields and covariant derivative transform as [19]
D  ()D()1 (1.1.23a)
G  ()G()1 + i
[()] ()1 . (1.1.23b)
We still need to introduce the usual kinetic term for the new gauge fields G. We
do this by considering [D, D ]  igsG , and we now find that [19]
GA = G
  GA  gsfABCGBGC , (1.1.24)
and the transformation from Eqns. 1.1.23
G  ()G()1 . (1.1.25)
Therefore, by considering a gauge invariant kinetic term for the gluons of the form
Tr ([D, D ][D
, D ]), we construct the gauge invariant QCD Lagrangian
LQCD =
a (iD mi)ab q
 . (1.1.26)
The quarks are in the fundamental representation of SU (3) and the gluons, the
gauge bosons, are in the adjoint representation of SU (3). The fact the theory needs
to be renormalizable constrains any additional terms we may try to add to the
Lagrangian. Again we note that a mass term for the gluons is not permitted as it
would not be invariant under gauge transformations.

1.1.3 Electroweak Theory
Electricity and Magnetism were first unified by Maxwell in 1865 in his paper A
Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field [20], then in a series of works
during the 1960s, Glashow, Salam and Weinberg unified Electromagnatism and the
weak nuclear force, culminating in their award of a Nobel prize in 1979 [911].
The Electroweak theory is an SU (2)  U (1) gauge theory. In this theory, the
left-handed spinors transform differently to the right-handed spinors, which is forced
upon us by Nature allowing the W boson to only couple to left-handed particles4.
To construct the theory, we form a left-handed doublet of fields with weak isospin
T = 1
and right-handed singlets with weak isospin T = 0
 LL =
 . (1.1.27)
We identify uL to have third-component of weak isospin T3 =
, and dL to have
T3 = 12 , and similarly for the leptons. The gauge transformations under the
different groups for the left and right-handed particles are shown in Table 1.1, where
(x) are the parameters of the transformation,  are the Pauli matrices and Y are
the weak hypercharges.
Following the same procedure as before, this necessitates the introduction of

1.1. The Standard Model 9
three new gauge fields for the SU (2) transformation, W
i , and one new gauge field
for the U (1) transformation, B, with the usual change of derivative to covariant
derivative, so the Lagrangian is
LEW =Lgauge + Lfermions + LHiggs (1.1.28)
BB + Lfermions + LHiggs
where
Lfermions = iQLDQL + iLLDLL + iuRDuR + idRDdR + ieRDeR ,
(1.1.29)
describing the interactions of the fermions with the gauge bosons and also the kinetic
terms for the fermions.
We still need a mass term for our fermions and bosons, and having the benefit
of foresight, we include this under LHiggs. The reason for generating the masses this
way, is two fold. Firstly, is that due to the different transformations of the left and
right-handed fermions there is a problem with the usual Dirac mass term. A mass
term such as in LDirac is strictly forbidden by gauge symmetry. This can be seen by
considering [15]
L = m = m
RL + LR
, (1.1.30)
where clearly due to the different transformation properties of left- and right-handed
fermions, is not gauge invariant. Secondly, a standard mass term for our bosons, as
is required for the Z and W bosons, in our non-Abelian theory is not gauge invariant
as can be seen from the transformation properties from Eqn. 1.1.23.
It is now clear why we have included LHiggs in our Electroweak Langrangian -
to generate these masses. The theory allows mass terms via the Higgs mechanism,
a spontaneously broken symmetry giving rise to masses of the gauge bosons and
fermions and introduces a new boson, the Higgs boson.
1.1.4 The Higgs Mechanism
The Higgs mechanism is best explained first with a simple example before the full
mechanism is added to the Electroweak Langrangian [15,16]. The canonical example

is to consider a single complex scalar field  with the Lagrangian
L = DD
F F  2 
(1.1.31)
where D =  + ieA and which we note has a global U (1) symmetry and we
identify the potential as
V () = 2+ 
. (1.1.32)
For a classical field the ground state is found where the potential is minimum. If
the vacuum energy is to be bounded from below, then we must take  > 0 but we
may choose 2 to be either sign. For 2 > 0 then we obtain a parabolic shaped
potential and the minimum is at the origin, however, if we take 2 < 0, then we
obtain the famous Mexican hat potential as seen in one-dimension in Fig. 1.1. We
now see that the minimum of the potential lies on a circle where
Vmin = 
(1.1.33)
and we can write
ei , (1.1.34)
i.e. we have degeneracy in the energy states due to an azimuthal symmetry - the
phase, , is arbitrary. A particular vacuum state must be realised though and

choosing a vacuum state then breaks the U (1) symmetry, i.e. spontaneous symmetry
breaking.
We choose the vacuum expectation value, v, to be real and we find the physical
fields by expanding around the minimum by setting
 (x) =
(v +  (x) + i (x)) , (1.1.35)
where clearly the fields  and  have zero vacuum expectation value. We then insert
this into our Lagrangian and find that
L = 1
  v22 + 1
e2v2AA
  evA 
F F + Lint. .
(1.1.36)
Now we see that we have one real massive field  and one massless field, the Gold-
stone boson, . We see the beginings of what we want in order to generate a mass
term for our physical field, as we have the term 1
e2v2AA
 but we have the un-
wanted Goldston boson, . In practice, this unphysical field can be removed by an
appropriate choice of gauge - the Unitary gauge.
We now apply the Higgs mechanism to the Electroweak Standard Model by
introducing a weak isospin doublet of complex scalar fields, , that have the trans-
formation properties as outlined in Table 1.2.
We then add to the Lagrangian a component
LHiggs = (D) (D) 2 
, (1.1.37)
where the covariant derivative is defined by
D =  + i
 + i
B . (1.1.38)
We choose the ground state to be
 (1.1.39)
1.1. The Standard Model 12
and, in the unitary gauge, we expand (x) as
 (x) =
v + (x)
 . (1.1.40)
Upon writing out the Lagrangian, we find that we can identify the photon and
Z boson with
Z = cos WW
3  sin WB , (1.1.41a)
A = sin WW
3 + cos WB
 , (1.1.41b)
where W is the Weinberg angle, mz =
cos W
, there is no photon mass term and the
W boson gains a mass mW =
The down-type quarks and leptons gain their masses by noting that a Yukawa
interaction of the form
L = gd
QLdR + 
dRQL
(1.1.42)
is invariant under both the SU (2) and U (1) transformation, and the up-type quarks
L = gu
QLuR + 
uRQL
(1.1.43)
where   i(2)T transforms as
 exp
ig(x)ii
 (1.1.44)
i.e. with opposite hypercharge compared to  and which can be written in Unitary
gauge as
 (x) =
v + (x)
 . (1.1.45)
We therefore write a general gauge invariant expression for our quark masses as
L = QLmGmnd
RnQLmGmnu
Rn + h.c. (1.1.46)
where now the primes indicate that the weak isospin eigenstates may not be the
same as the physical mass eigenstates. We diagonalise the matrix G with a bi-
unitary transformation V GU = D, so we may write the Lagrangian in terms of the

physical mass eigenstates, i.e. we rotate the weak eigenstates into mass eigenstates.
We make this transformation everywhere where we see the weak isospin eigenstates.
This changes the non-flavour diagonal interaction terms in the Lagrangian, so now,
in the interactions of the quarks and the W boson, determined by the covariant
derivative, we find that in rotating to the physical mass states, we gain a factor of
V V  VCKM . (1.1.47)
This matrix, the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) [21, 22] matrix, allows us to
work in the physical mass eigenstates, not the weak isospin eigenstates by inclusion of
the appropriate factor. Unfortunately the SM has nothing to say about what values
this matrix should take, and along with the masses of the fundamental particles, we
must measure these quantities physically. To get a flavour for the CKM matrix, we
can use the Wolfenstein parameterisation where (to O(4)) [23]
VCKM =
1 2/2  A3( i)
 1 2/2 A2
A3(1  i) A2 1
 (1.1.48)
where   0.23, A  0.81,   0.14 and   0.35.
The lepton mass terms can be generated in a similar manner, but for mass-
less neutrinos there is no lepton mixing matrix equivalent to the CKM matrix,
as we may rotate the lepton fields to define the electron neutrino as the neutrino

field coupling to the electron. However, if we introduce massive neutrinos, then
there is a lepton mixing matrix similar to the CKM matrix called the Pontecorvo-
Make-Nakagawa-Sakate (PMNS) matrix [24], which is currently studied by neutrino
oscillation experiments.
To summarise the host of quantum numbers we have encountered, the quantum
numbers of the fermions of the SM can be found in Table 1.3. We also show in the
Fig. 1.2 the known constituents of matter, separated into their three generations
and the gauge bosons, the force carriers, and the Higgs boson.
1.1.5 Renormalization, Divergences and Running Couplings
Although we would like to solve our theory exactly, this is not possible and so in
calculating quantities in the SM we make use of perturbative series, i.e. we view the
interaction terms as a perturbation. Practically, we make a perturbative expansion
in the coupling constant of the process we are interested in5, write down all the
Feynman diagrams in the coupling expansion for the process we are interested in at
a certain order, and then calculate them.
If the perturbative expansion series is asymptotic, then as we move higher in the
series the magnitude of the contribution of the higher orders should be less than
5For this we rely upon the property of QCD known as asymptotic freedom, which is discussed
next.
1.1. The Standard Model 15

the preceding orders. So, if we wanted to calculate the total rate for e+e  qq in
perturbative QCD (pQCD) we would form the series as shown in Fig. 1.3, where
upon squaring, we have to be careful to only include the correct final states and
only up to the order we desire in the coupling constant.
The leading-order process is generally easy to calculate, however, things become
more complicated as we start to introduce quantum corrections into the calculation.
Upon inclusion of a loop, we must integrate over all modes inside the loop and we
see from the example [19] in Fig. 1.4 that we have a contribution
(k + p)
2 m2
dk k3
k2  k2 
  dk
 ln  (1.1.49)
where we have introduced an artificial cut-off on the integral,  to illustrate how the
integral diverges as we take   . Such problems are treated by the process of
renormalization, whereby a regulator is introduced into the theory and then counter
terms introduced to exactly balance the dependence on the regulator, thus leaving
the integral finite [25]. In practice, we say that we dont measure the bare pa-
rameters of the Lagrangian and we only measure the physical, non-divergent, finite
parameters. This amounts to us absorbing the divergences into our newly defined
bare parameters, or, saying that the problem is not from the perturbative expansion
itself but from the choice of parameter with which we expand [26].
The usual regulator used is the process of dimensional regularization, whereby
the calculation of the integral is done in d = 4  2 dimensions, rendering the
divergences as poles in . A subtraction scheme e.g. minimal subtraction bar -
1.1. The Standard Model 16
Figure 1.4: A simple loop in a propagator.
MS , is then prescribed to conveniently absorb the divergences and other regularly
featuring constants which vary between the schemes, thus rendering the integral
finite.
The process of renormalization also introduces a new scale into the theory, the
renormalization scale. Clearly a physical process cannot depend on this unphysical
renormalization scale. We can express this fact by using the renormalization group
equations.
If we consider the coupling of QED and define as usual
, (1.1.50)
the coupling has a dependence on the scale which we choose to measure it at. We
define the beta function [26]
 () = 2
, (1.1.51)
where the beta function is dependent on the theory in question and is calculated
order by order in perturbation theory. It tells us how, in this case, the coupling
evolves with the scale. In general the beta function can be written as
 (x) = bx2 +O
, (1.1.52)
then in QED, where x =  we find that [27]
(1.1.53)
and for QCD [28,29], where x = s =
b = 
11CA  2nf
. (1.1.54)
1.1. The Standard Model 17
The general solution for our scale dependent coupling is
 (2)
1  (2) b ln
) . (1.1.55)
The most remarkable thing to notice is that the negative sign of the QCD b gives
rise to two, related, important properties:
 Asymptotic freedom - At high energies the coupling becomes small enough so
that we may use a perturbative expansion in the coupling constant to calculate
physical processes;
 Confinement - Quarks exist in bound states - hadrons. Free quarks are not
seen experimentally. The reason being is that the coupling strength increases
at low energies. Unfortunately, this means that we can no longer use a pertur-
bative treatment for calculations in our theory, and so we must rely on either
phenomenological models or numerical techniques with the discretization of
space-time to describe hadronic properties.
Clearly, a full treatment of renormalization is beyond the scope of this thesis
and for a more detailed treatment we refer to various books on the subject, e.g.
Refs [16, 18,19,27,30,31].
Whilst renormalization deals with issues from the short range of the theory, i.e
high energies (U.V. divergences), we may similarly ask what happens to divergences
when we move to low energies and long range interactions (I.R. divergences).
Infrared divergences are cancelled between the real and virtual contributions
thanks to the Bloch-Nordsieck theorem [32] in QED and, for the SM as a whole,
Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg (KLN) theorem [33, 34]. Schematically we write a next-
to-leading order (NLO) cross section as
NLO =
dR +
dV (1.1.56)
where we have the real-emission terms integrated over the n+ 1 parton phase space
and the virtual contribution integrated over the n parton phase space. When we
calculate these in dimensional regularization, we find that the infrared pole struc-
ture appears equally in both integrals, but crucially with the opposite sign in one

giving complete cancellation, thus rendering our calculation infrared finite. This
can be seen diagrammatically when we consider the interference between both real
contributions and the virtual tree-level contributions as shown in Fig. 1.5.
We need to be sufficiently inclusive, i.e. integrate over the appropriate phase
space for these cancellations to occur. We therefore need to pick an experimental
observable that is both soft and collinear safe, and this can have important conse-
quences, e.g. for a particular choice of jet algorithm as discussed in Appendix B.
Therefore any exclusive experimental observables, e.g. a central jet veto may pick
up large logarithms due to incomplete cancellations.
1.2 Monte Carlo Simulations
As mentioned in the introduction to this Chapter, Monte Carlo simulations are
an important tool of the modern collider experiments, and without them modern
collider experiments would not be able to perform as they do. When one considers
that the multiplicity of a final state at the LHC will be a few thousand particles,
with multiple parton interactions, underlying event and pile-up, then one must use
these state-of-the-art tools.
Below we will consider the construction of a Monte Carlo event generator in terms
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 19
Figure 1.6: The splitting of q  q g.
of a hard-process and a parton shower - whereby the partons undergo branchings to
form a cascade of particles producing highly complex final states.
1.2.1 Parton Splitting
One of the main features of any Monte Carlo event generator is the parton shower,
whereby the incoming or outgoing partons from the hard process radiate particles
in a cascade and those particles in turn go on to produce their own cascade of
particles. In this way, complex final states are produced of many partons whilst
summing up large contributions to the calculation in an approximation to the full
pQCD calculation for such a complex process. The key in all this is therefore the
splitting of a parent parton into other children partons, which then in turn split
themselves. If we consider the propagator in the splitting of a quark to a quark and
gluon as shown in Fig. 1.6 then there is a propagator associated with the internal
quark, which in limit of vanishing mass, goes like
(q + k)2
2q  k =
2EqEk(1 cos qk)
, (1.2.1)
where qk is the angle between the partons q and k. This propagator clearly has a
divergence when either cos qk  1 i.e. qk  0 (a collinear divergence), or when
Eq  0 or Ek  0 (a soft divergence)6. We will examine these in turn below.
6For the cases where t = (q + k)2 > 0 we refer to this as timelike branching, and for t < 0, we
refer to this as spacelike branching.
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 20
Collinear Divergences
To understand more about the collinear divergences, we consider the above massless
case and we write the Mn+1 matrix element as7
Mn+1 = gsta(k)u(q)
/q + /k
2q  kM
n (1.2.2)
where k is the momentum of the emitted gluon, q is the momentum of the external
quark, (k) is the external polarization vector of the gluon and the matrix element
Mn contains the remaining part of the matrix element and therefore contains spinors
and gamma matrices describing the process which produced the quarks.
We now square this matrix element and sum over spins and polarizations of the
gluon to obtain [19,35]
|Mn+1|2 =
(k)(k)
g2sCF
4 (q  k)2
M n 0

, (1.2.3)
and we will make use of the polarization relation in a physical gauge
(k)(k) = g + n
k + nk
n  k , (1.2.4)
where n is a light like vector and upon which we apply the usual Dirac rules for
gamma matrices, and keep in mind that we are treating massless particles8. When
the smoke clears, we are left with the following expression [19,35]
|Mn+1|2 =
g2sCF
(n  k) (q  k)Tr
M n 0
n  (k + q)
/k + /q
+ (n  q) /q  /n (q  k)
(1.2.5)
At this point we introduce the Sudakov basis [37] where, in this basis, a general
vector may be written as
i = ip
 + in
 + q
 i . (1.2.6)
In a Monte Carlo event generator the vector p will be the momentum of the shower
progenitor such that p2 = m2, the reference vector n is a light-like vector chosen
7We follow here the formalism of Ref. [19], except for final state branching as in Ref. [35]. An
alternative derivation is given in Ref. [18].
8Gamma matrix algebra is often tedious and error prone for large expressions. FORM is an ap-
plication which has inbuilt routines for efficiently handling gamma matrices and is used extensively
throughout the work in this thesis [36].
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 21
such that n  p > m2, usually chosen anti-collinear to p and the q vector gives the
remaining components of the momentum transverse to p and n. This means that
we satisfy the following relations
q i  p = 0 p2 = m2 q2 i = p2 i (1.2.7)
q i  n = 0 n2 = 0 n  p > m2 .
We also define z to be the fraction of the parents 4-momentum carried by the quark
after the branching, i.e.
, (1.2.8)
meaning we can write our gluon momenta and our quark momentum in the above
q = zp + qn
 + q (1.2.9a)
k = (1 z)p + kn  q , (1.2.9b)
and the  variables are found by the mass-shell condition q2 = k2 = 0 and Eqns. 1.2.7,
such that
2zp  n and k =
2(1 z)p  n . (1.2.10)
Therefore, using Eqns. 1.2.9 and Eqs. 1.2.7 into Eqn. 1.2.5, we find the only non-
trivial relation to be
q  k = p
2z(1 z) (1.2.11)
and so retaining only the leading pieces, i.e. parts that go like O (1/p2), we find
|Mn+1|2 =
g2sCF
(q  k)
1 + z2
1 z Tr
M n 0
/pMn
. (1.2.12)
Making use of the completeness relation for massless particles
u(p)u(p) = /p (1.2.13)
to re-insert the spinors back into Mn in Eqn. 1.2.12 leaves us with a factorized
expression as [19,35]
|Mn+1|2 =
g2sCF
(q  k)
1 + z2
1 z |Mn|
. (1.2.14)
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 22
This is starting to look like what we may want in terms of implementation
in a Monte Carlo event generator, however, we need to consider the phase space
associated with the extra emission. The n + 1 body phase space maybe written
as [38]
dn = . . .
2 (2)
(1.2.15)
and so for our splitting p q + k we have
dn+1 = . . .
2 (2)
2 (2)
, (1.2.16)
which at fixed k we may write
dn+1 = . . .
2 (2)
2 (2)
. (1.2.17)
As our phase space is Lorentz invariant, we make the choice of basis [19]
p = Ep (1; 0, 0, 1) , n = (1; 0, 0,1) , q = (0; p cos, p sin, 0) (1.2.18)
which means that
(1 z)Ep +
4(1 z)Ep
;p cos,p sin, (1 z)Ep 
4(1 z)Ep
(1.2.19)
and similarly we see that Eq = zEp +O (p2) and we may write our phase space as
dn+1 = dn
. (1.2.20)
We also have that
=  Ek
(1 z) (1.2.21)
and from Eqn. 1.2.11
2q  k = z(1 z) . (1.2.22)
We therefore find that, after integrating over azimuthal angle,
dn+1 = dn
(2)2
dp2dz , (1.2.23)
so now, for our extra emission we may write the cross-section as
dn+1 = dn
1 + z2
1 z dz
. (1.2.24)
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 23
This process can be generalised, and we may write
dn+1 = dn
CP (z)dz
, (1.2.25)
where P (z) are the so called Altarelli-Parisi splitting functions [3941], and C is
an appropriate colour factor for the splitting, usually part of the Altarelli-Parisi
splitting functions. The other splitting functions can be derived in a similar way as
above and it is found that the spin averaged functions are [42]
Pqq(z) = CF
1 + z2
1 z Pgq(z) = CF
1 + (1 z)2
(1.2.26)
Pgg(z) = CA
z4 + 1 + (1 z)4
z(1 z) Pqg(z) = TR(z
2 + (1 z)2) .
This approach also holds for an initial-state spacelike shower.
Now let us consider how the parton density changes when we have multiple
branchings, as will be the case in our parton shower. To do so, we form the picture
whereby a parton carrying a fraction x of the parent hadrons momentum under-
goes branchings, moving to a lower momentum and a more negative virtual mass
squared [18]. At some lower virtual mass squared, t = p2, the parton undergoes a
hard scattering.
The change in parton density during this process is therefore the difference be-
tween the number of partons arriving in an element (t, x) and the number leaving.
Looking at Eqn. 1.2.24 we can therefore write
fin =
dxdz
P (z)f(x, t) (x zx) ,
P (z)f
, (1.2.27)
where we have integrated over all higher momentum fractions x = x/z, which as
x < 1, we may write the lower range of the integral as 0. Now, turning our attention
to the states leaving the element (t, x), we have that
fout =
dxdz
P (z)f(x, t) (x zx)
P (z)f(x, t) , (1.2.28)
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 24
so the total change may be written as [18]
fin  fout
P (z)
 f(x, t)
(1.2.29)
P (z)
 f(x, t)
. (1.2.30)
Eqn. 1.2.30 is the famous DGLAP evolution equation that informs us how to
evolve the parton distributions at one scale to another. We therefore want to be
able to solve this in our Monte Carlo event generator in an iterative way to generate
our parton splittings and for this, we turn to the Sudakov form factor, which is
defined as
 (t)  exp
P (z)
. (1.2.31)
We now write the DGLAP equation Eqn. 1.2.30 in terms of this new function
such that
P (z)f
f(x, t)
 (t)
 (t)
 (t)
 (t)
P (z)f
, (1.2.32)
which we now integrate to give the solution
f (x, t) =  (t) f (x0, t) +
 (t)
 (t)
P (z)f
. (1.2.33)
The interpretation of Eqn. 1.2.33 will be how we implement our splittings in the
Monte Carlo even generator. To aid in the interpretation, we turn to the example
of radioactive decay [42]. In radioactive decay, we know simply that the number
of atoms that have not decayed by a time t is given by exp
, and so
by analogy, our Sudakov form factor in Eqn. 1.2.31 is the number of partons that
havent branched i.e. it is our no branching probability.
Therefore the interpretation of Eqn. 1.2.33, is that the first term is a contribution
from paths in (t, x) space that do not branch between t0 and t, and that the second
term is the contribution from all paths that had their last branching at a scale t [18].
Clearly in a parton shower, we have more than one parton type splitting, and so we
include these effects by summing over parton splittings in the Sudakov form factor.
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 25
We have actually glossed over an important fact and that is that the splitting
functions are unregularized and have singularities as z  1. To solve this problem,
we introduce a cut-off on z which defines a resolvable emission, and so our Sudakov
form factor now defines the probability of no resolvable emission.
In this way, we also include virtual corrections in the Sudakov form factor. We
know from unitarity that the sum of branching and no branching probabilities must
be unity and so our no resolvable branching probability tells us via unitarity the
sum of unresolved and virtual corrections, which although individually divergent,
have a finite sum as discussed earlier.
Using the Sudakov form factor to evolve our partons therefore allows us to sum
the leading logarithms associated with the collinear divergences to all orders. Recall-
ing from the introduction that s runs with scale, there is therefore still the question
as what to take for the argument of s in our Sudakov form factor. Technically the
choice of scale for s should be a higher order consideration, however, it can have
important phenomenological implications. Naively, the natural scale choice for the
process would seem to be the evolution variable scale t of the branching, however,
typically we use the transverse momentum of the splitting. This is because by using
the transverse momentum, it can be shown that it is possible to capture some higher
terms in the series and sum some of the higher logarithms [43].
Having only considered collinear divergences so far, we must now turn our at-
tention to the soft divergences.
Soft Divergences
We saw from earlier in Eqn. 1.2.1 that is also a soft divergence associated with the
gluon energy, Ek  0. To understand the nature of these divergences, we turn again
to the propagator associated with the emission of an extra gluon
Mn+1 = gstA(k)u(q)
/q + /k
2q  kM
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 26
and now we apply the Dirac algebra to the top line and along with the eikonal
approximation, i.e. assume the gluon momentum is small, and get
Mn+1 = gstA(k)u(q)
2q  /q + /k
2q  k M
= gst
A(k)u(q)
(2q + /k)
2q  k M
= gst
A q  
q  k u(q)M
= gst
A q  
q  kMn . (1.2.34)
The matrix element Mn+1 has factorized into a spin-independent soft eikonal
factor multiplied by the matrix element Mn. This factorization applies in general
to any soft emission off an external leg. Internal off-shell lines do not receive this
contribution as in that case (p + k)2 m2  p2 m2 6= 0 as k  0. For emission
off more than one leg, we end up with a series of dipoles, which we may express in
terms of a radiation pattern.
We will compute here the basic pattern for e+e  qq with one extra gluon
emission. Using the same approach as above, assuming massless quarks, we find
Mn+1 =gstAiju(pi)
(/pi +
2pi  k
Mn(k)
+ gsMntAij
(/pj  /k)
2pj  k
v(pj)
(k) (1.2.35)
which upon applying the Dirac algebra, squaring we get
|Mn+1|2 = |Mn|2CF
2 pi  pj
(pi  k)(pj  k)
. (1.2.36)
We may now write this in terms of the radiation function Wij where in general,
i.e. for massive quarks, we define the Lorentz invariant [44]
Wij(k) = 
pi  k
pj  k
22i 
22j 
, (1.2.37)
where we follow convention with  being the energy of the soft gluon and pi,j are
the momenta of the particles forming the dipole, ij =
pipj
= 1  vivj cos ij,
i = 1 vi cos i, i = Ei/mi = 1/
(1 v2i ), vi is the velocity of parton i, i is the
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 27
angle between the direction of motion of the soft gluon and the parton i, and ij is
the angle between the partons i and j.
We now see that we can write Eqn. 1.2.36 as
|Mn+1|2 = |Mn|2CF
= |Mn|2F . (1.2.38)
In general for processes with more than one dipole
CijWij , (1.2.39)
with the sum over the different Wij, contributions, where Cij is the associated colour
factor. In general we define the leading-order matrix element,
M0({p0}) =
Mn0 ({p0})Tn, (1.2.40)
in terms the colour-ordered amplitudes, Mn0 , each with associated colour factor
Tn (which depends on the colours j of the external partons), where the sum is
over the distinct colour-ordered amplitudes and p0 are the momenta of the external
particles.
In the eikonal limit, the emission of an extra external gluon may be written as
M ({p0}, k) =
Mn0J n   (1.2.41)
where M ({p0}, k) is the matrix element for the process with an extra gluon, de-
pending on the set of leading-order momenta p0, the momenta of the gluon k and,
, the polarization vector of the radiated gluon.
The eikonal current is therefore
J  ({p0}, k) =
i{p0}
pi  k
Tnj t
jk, (1.2.42)
where j/k are the colours of the ith external particle before/after the gluon emission
and tAjk is the colour matrix associated with the extra emission. The soft gluon
distribution is then obtained by squaring the current i.e.
F = J (k)2 =
spins
(J (k)(k))2 . (1.2.43)
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 28
Turning our attention back to the Wij function, we begin by splitting it into two
terms [44]
Wij = W
ij +W
ij (1.2.44)
such that each piece contains the leading collinear singularity
W iij =
2i i
ij  i
1 vi cos i
1 vj cos i
, (1.2.45)
where Ai = vi  cos i and Bi = cos i  vj cos ij. Taking the massless case of W iij
we see that
W iij =
2(1 cos i)
cos i  cos ij
1 cos j
(1.2.46)
contains the collinear singularity as i  0. W iij also has the remarkable property
of angular ordering when we take the azimuthal average [18,38]
W iij
W iij . (1.2.47)
To understand the angular dependence we choose the basis
pi = (1, 0, 0) , (1.2.48a)
pj = (cos ij, sin ij, 0) , (1.2.48b)
k = (cos i, cosi sin i, sini sin i) , (1.2.48c)
and we then find that all the azimuthal dependence comes from the cos j term
cos j = k  pj = cos ij cos i + sin ij sin i cosi . (1.2.49)
We may use a contour integral to integrate over the i dependence of the integral,
as has been done in Ref. [18,38]. The massive case gives the following result [44]
W iij
viAi + 
B2i + (sin i/j)
 (1.2.50)
which in the massless limit gives
W iij
2(1 cos i)
(cos i  cos ij)
|cos i  cos ij|
1 cos ig
if i < ij ,
0 otherwise .

This tells us that soft radiation is suppressed at angles larger than ij

only considered a very simple case here and it will be of benefit to see what happens
in a more complicated case.

(2 (W14 +W23) 2 (W13 +W24)W12 W34) .
(1.2.55)
9In Electrodynamics this is the well known Chudakov effect, where the photon cannot resolve
the transverse separation of a pair of electrons unless the angle between the two electrons is greater
than the angle of emission.
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 30
Figure 1.8: A diagrammatic representation of angular ordering in the shower, where
radiation occurs in cones to the radiating particles colour partner.
This seems like a disaster in terms of a Monte Carlo event generator, where we want
to express things in terms of positive definite probabilities. To interpret Eqn. 1.2.55
we rewrite it as [44]
F = CF (W13 +W24) +
(2 (W14 +W23)W13 W24 W12 W34) ,
(1.2.56)
where the last term in Eqn. 1.2.56 not only has no collinear singularities, it is also
suppressed in the large NC limit compared to the first term. We can therefore safely
neglect the last term in interpreting the radiation pattern in terms of a probability,
and we are left with a positive definite contribution.
We now introduce the concept of a colour partner in the large NC limit, so in the
case of the above process the colour partner of the incoming quark, is the outgoing
quark and vice versa, as seen in Fig. 1.7. We therefore see that the quark can only
radiate up to the angle of its colour partner, the outgoing quark. Now, for example,
after the incoming quark has radiated, radiation off the daughter quark may only be
up the angle of the new colour partner - the anti-colour line of the gluon. A diagram
illustrating this idea is seen in Fig. 1.8. This angular ordering of the emissions gives
rise to a colour coherent process, similar to the Chudakov effect. We will be seeing
many examples of these radiation patterns in this thesis, and example plots are left
to the appropriate sections. We should also consider the factorization of phase space
in this soft limit. In the soft limit clearly

(1.2.57)
and for the gluon
2 (2)

(1.2.58)
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 31
and so our cross section is written in general as
dn+1 = dn
CijWij . (1.2.59)
Now we replace the CijdEk/Ek with P (z)dz discussed earlier and we correctly treat
both soft and collinear singularities.
To implement this effect in a Monte Carlo event generator, we should therefore
order in angles, and so, instead of using t = p2 as our evolution variable, we should
instead use some variable that has angular dependence.
1.2.2 A Monte Carlo Event Generator
Using the results of the last section, we can create a parton shower for a Monte Carlo
event generator based on soft and collinear splittings, forming the cascade process we
are interested in. In general Monte Carlo simulations describe high energy collisions
using [42,45]
1. a hard perturbative, either Leading- or Next-to-Leading-order, matrix element
to simulate the fundamental hard collision process;
2. the parton shower algorithm which evolves from the scale of the hard process
to a cut-off scale, O(1 GeV), via the successive radiation of soft and collinear
quarks and gluons;
3. the generation of multiple perturbative scattering processes to simulate the
underlying event;
4. the perturbative decay of any fundamental particles, with lifetimes shorter
than the timescale for hadron formation, followed again by the simulation of
QCD radiation from the coloured decay products using the parton shower
formalism;
5. a hadronization model which describes the formation of hadrons at the cut-off
scale from the quarks and gluons produced during the parton shower;
6. the decays of the unstable hadrons produced by hadronization.
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 32
So we need to understand how the hard process is implemented and how to
actually proceed with generating the scales of the branchings for the parton shower
from the methodology above. We also have the problem of how to efficiently evolve
from the incoming hadron down towards the hard process giving us the momentum
configuration we want in the hard process without rejecting too many events. In
practice, we will see that this is solved by using backwards evolution from the hard
process to the incoming hadron.
Hard process
Modern day calculations make use of the factorization theorem [46] which allows
us to describe our cross section as a convolution between non-perturbative parton
distribution function (PDFs) with a perturbative hard-scattering process. We write
our cross section as
dxadxb
fa(xa, F )fb(xb, F )dabn(F , R)
dxadxb
dnfa(xa, F )fb(xb, F )
M2abn(n, F , R) (1.2.60)
where the fi(xi, F ) are the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the respective
incoming hadron(s), dependent on the light-cone fraction xi of the parton i with
respect to the incoming hadron. In addition dabn is the hard differential cross-
section for the process we are interested in and we have introduced a new scale,
the factorization scale F along with the renormalization scale R and we have
introduced a flux factor F associated with the phase-space integral.
In general the matrix element |M2abn(n, F , R)| may be either evaluated by
hand and inputted into the Monte Carlo event generator or inbuilt routines may
exist to calculate these from first principles, e.g. in Herwig++ there is the helicity
formalism - HELAS [47]. Most modern day event generators also come with an
ability to read in matrix elements from an external program and then perform the
subsequent parton shower and hadronization of the events.
The phase space is often complicated for processes involving ab n where n > 2.
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 33
In general it is defined as
dn =
(2)32Ei
 (2)4(4)(pa + pb 
pi) , (1.2.61)
so we are left with a potentially complicated matrix element integrated over a com-
plicated phase space. Often the phase space is transformed into something more
suitable for computation and therefore we must include the appropriate Jacobian
factor.
The Monte Carlo event generator samples the matrix element and integrates it
using Monte Carlo methods, of which more information can be found in Appendix A.
In general a crude estimate is performed at the start before event generation and
this is used to decide the important parts of phase space and maximum weight to
ensure that when events are generated, configurations are produced with the correct
distribution. In general events are presented unweighted as Nature does not produce
weighted events and it avoids complications with detector simulators. To produce
the unweighted events, each momentum configuration can be accepted or rejected
according to its probability, which is proportional to the maximum weight discovered
during initialization.
We are still left with choices for the factorization scale and renormalization scale
in the calculation. There are no correct methods for determining the correct scale
for F , but we are guided by intuition of our knowledge of logarithms of the hard
process. If we have an s-channel scattering process with a scale Q2 then generally
we can set F = R = Q
2 and we can have a crude estimate of our errors by varying
the factorization scale between 1
F  2F .
The PDFs are free for the user to decide and most event generators provide not
only some inbuilt PDFs, but also an interface to the external LHAPDF package [48],
who provide a plethora of PDFs from the various fitting groups through their web-
site. In principle one may wish to use different PDFs for each beam, especially if
one is scattering different particles but generally the same PDF set is used for both
beam particles for processes at the LHC.
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 34
Final-state radiation
We first turn our attention to the final-state radiation, as this is simpler than the
initial-state radiation, simply as we evolve away from the hard process without being
constrained by what the final-state products should be.
For forward evolving time-like showers in Herwig++ we make use of the vari-
able [37]
q2 =
z(1 z)

q2i =m
(1.2.62)
and by the sub script ij we mean the parent of the splitting. We then find that
q2 =
z(1 z) +
z2(1 z) +
z(1 z)2 
z2(1 z)2 (1.2.63)
which can be found from Eqn. 1.2.62, setting qij = qi + qj and where
p = qi  zqij . (1.2.64)
We find that
q2 
(1 + cos ij)
2 (1 cos ij)
(1 + cos i) (1 + cos j)
, (1.2.65)
which for small angles gives
q = Eijij
1O(2x)
. (1.2.66)
We choose the starting scale for the shower based on the partons provided by the
hard process in order to ensure colour coherence. The evolution will terminate at
some point and we therefore need to choose what we mean by a resolvable emission.
In Herwig++ this is chosen with a parameterization based on a tuned parameter -
a cut-off mass for the gluon. This now defines our new Sudakov form factor
 (q, qh) =
ijij (q, qh) (1.2.67)
where, in full
ijij (q, qh) = exp
 qh
dq2
S (z, q
Pijij (z, q
p2 > 0
(1.2.68)
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 35
The evolution from a scale qh to q without a resolvable branching is given by
our Sudakov form factor,  (q, qh) and so we can generate the first branching of this
scale by solving
 (q, qh) = R , (1.2.69)
where R  Unif[0, 1]. This is solved by what is known as the veto algorithm,
whereby we form a simple analytically integrable over-estimate of the integral and
then we can solve for q. The veto algorithm is discussed in Appendix D.
To proceed with our evolution, we therefore solve [37]
over
ijij (q, qh) = exp
 qh
dq2
 zover+
zover
overS (z, q
P over
ijij (z)
= R (1.2.70)
such that
q2 = q2hR
r (1.2.71)
where
dq2
 zover+
zover
over
(z,q)
P over
ijij (z)
d ln q2
. (1.2.72)
z is then solved from the over-estimate of its integral, P over
ijij (z), by
z = I1
zover
zover
zover
(1.2.73)
where I(z) is the integral of P over
ijij (z) over z, I
1 is its inverse and R  Unif[0, 1].
We then reject the values of qh and z if
 p < 0;
 s(z,q)
overs
< R1;
 Pijij(z,q)
P over
ijij
< R2;
where again R1,2  Unif[0, 1]. If we reject q we set qh = q and repeat the process.
In this way, we correctly distribute the variables q, z and  describing the emission
according to the Sudakov form factor [49]. The initial starting scales for the branch-
ing of the parent are determined to be qhi = zq and qhj = (1  z)q, so that the
ordering criteria moves us lower in q and therefore angular orders. The p of the
splitting can then be found from Eqns. 1.2.63 (or Eqns. 1.2.75, depending on the
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 36
shower type). The azimuthal angle is chosen uniformly, so that we are neglecting
spin correlations.
At the end of the shower each parton is left with a set of kinematic variables
(q, z, , p). The progenitors of the shower are set to be on shell and  in the
Sudakov decomposition set to one. We then proceed down the shower tree from the
hard process calculating values of  for all partons by using the definition of z in
Eqn 1.2.8 and momentum conservation i.e. ij = i + j.
The q components can also be calculated in a similar way with the q of the
progenitor being zero and using Eqn. 1.2.64. Then all we are left to calculate is ,
which is calculated by setting the final state particles at the end of the shower on
mass shell and iterating down the shower using the fact that ij = i + j. In this
way we have reconstructed the momenta of our shower from the Sudakov basis.
Initial-state radiation
Initial-state radiation is similar to final state radiation, except we instead define
q2 =
m2i  q2i
(1 z)

,q2j =m
(1.2.74)
which again using qij = qi + qj gives
q2 =
(1 z) +
(1 z) +
z(1 z)2 
(1 z)2 , (1.2.75)
which can be shown to have the same form as Eqn. 1.2.66.
In addition, for the initial-state radiation, ideally we want to evolve back from
our hard process to the incoming hadron. We do this by being guided by the
PDFs [18,50,51].
To see this consider F(t; t, x)dt to be the fraction of partons at t that came
from the branching between (t, t + dt). Then, the number that did not branch is
given by
(t1, t2, x) = 1
F(t; t, x)dt . (1.2.76)
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 37
Now, we know from Eqn. 1.2.33 that
f (x, t2)F(t; t, x) =
 (t2)
 (t)
P (z)f
 (t2)
 (t)
f (x, t)
, (1.2.77)
which is solved to give
(t1, t2, x) =
 (t2) f (x, t1)
 (t1) f (x, t2)
. (1.2.78)
This allows us to evolve backwards from the hard process towards the incoming
hadron, being guided by the PDFs.
We introduce a modified Sudakov form factor
ijij (x, q, qh) = exp
 qh
dq2
S (z, q
Pijij (z, q
, q

p2 > 0

where the PDFs are now included in our definition of the Sudakov. In a similar way
as to before solve
 (x, q, qh) = R (1.2.80)
using an over-estimate

and z which is

with R3  Unif[0, 1].
We follow a similar reconstruction routine as in the final-state shower, except
now it is the last backward branched parton, i.e. the one coming directly from the
incoming hadron that is assumed to be on shell. We also have to start final-state
showers from all necessary daughters that are produced in the backward evolution.
1.2. Monte Carlo Simulations 38
Hadronization
After the shower has finished the final-state partons must be hadronized. Hadroniza-
tion is a model dependent process which is guided by physical principles. The
hadronization model in Herwig++ is based on the cluster model, which in turn is
built on the concept of preconfinement [52].
Preconfinement shows that partons can be clustered at the cut-off scale in the
shower into colour singlets that form an asymptotically universal invariant mass
distribution. The idea behind this can be thought about in the large NC limit
where a gluon carries a colour and anti-colour line. During the shower process the
flow of colour, via colour lines, is tracked. Although the colour is initially determined
by the colour structure of the hard perturbative matrix elements, the emission of
gluons during the shower introduces new colour structure.
At the end of the shower every colour line is connected to a colour partner.
Colour singlets can then easily be formed by these lines. In practice this requires
that at the end of the parton shower evolution all gluons are non-perturbatively split
into quark-antiquark pairs. All the partons can then be formed into colour-singlet
clusters which are assumed to be hadron precursors and decay according to phase
space into the observed hadrons. There is a small fraction of heavy clusters for
which this is not a reasonable approximation which are therefore first fissioned into
lighter clusters.
The main advantage of this model, when coupled with the angular-ordered par-
ton shower is that it has fewer parameters than the string model as implemented
in the Pythia [49] event generator yet still gives a reasonable description of col-
lider observables [42, 53]. Clearly such model dependancy has to be fitted to data
and there is therefore the concept of tuning the Monte Carlo event generator to
observable data, often in a 2 minimization process. The tuning of a Herwig++ will
be presented later on in this thesis. Further details of the Herwig++ hadronization
process can be found in the Herwig++ manual [37]. For the interested reader, Pythia
uses the Lund string model of hadronization, whereby the colourlines between par-
tons are viewed as strings [54, 55] under tension. Sherpa uses a cluster model also.
A nice review of this, and other hadronization models can be found in Ref. [42].
1.3. Next-to-Leading Order Processes 39
1.3 Next-to-Leading Order Processes
As we have already seen, a next-to-leading order processes can be written as in
Eqn. 1.1.56. We have also seen that there are two types of divergences, IR and UV.
Clearly we would like to implement NLO processes in an event generator as it is
another term in the perturbative series and we would expect to see an improvement
in overall normalization of the cross section and the shape of distributions that are
related to the first hard emission.
1.3.1 Numerical Integration
We have seen that the UV poles are removed by renormalization and that the IR
poles cancel exactly between the real emission and the virtual contribution. In
implementation, however, this cancellation of IR divergences is hard to implement
numerically as we get large numerical components from both the virtual and the real
contribution when integrating, that may become unstable. A solution is at hand
though in the form of the dipole formalism.
The dipole formalism provides a way to deal with the poles appearing by cleverly
subtracting and then adding an auxiliary component, dA to the NLO cross section
[5658]
NLO =
dR  dA
dA +
dR  dA
dV +
. (1.3.83)
The auxiliary component is chosen to match the point-wise singular behavior of
the real contribution dR in d dimensions, therefore acting as a local counter-term
for dR. Importantly, dA is chosen to be analytically integrable in d dimensions
over the phase-space regions that cause the soft and collinear divergences.
The choice of dA therefore means that [dR  dA] is integrable over the n+ 1
phase space, and the limit   0 can safely be taken (as the divergent pieces have
been subtracted). It also means that
dA contains all the poles that are required
to cancel those of the virtual term dV therefore allowing that NLO can be safely
1.3. Next-to-Leading Order Processes 40
integrated numerically in a Monte-Carlo procedure [58]. We can therefore write
NLO =
dV +
(1.3.84)
where the first term under the n+ 1 integral and second term under the n integral
appearing in Eqn. 1.3.84 are integrable numerically in 4 dimensions.
It is worth noting at this point that no approximation has taken place. A fake
cross section has been added and subtracted to regularise the integrals but the final
answer for NLO contains no approximation and therefore the total cross section
contains no approximation.
The construction of the appropriate auxiliary cross section is clearly the key to
implementing this method. Originally this was outlined using the dipole method for
massless partons in Ref. [56] and then extended to massive partons in Ref. [57]. In
both cases the auxiliary cross section is formulated by a sum of different contribu-
tions causing the IR singularities - the dipoles. As the IR singularities are caused
by soft and collinear emissions from partons, the dipoles therefore encapsulate the
description of these processes. The pair of partons are described by an emitter and a
spectator, where it is the emitters kinematics that lead to the collinear singularities
and both for the soft singularities.
The process of splitting may be thought of as the leading-order event occurring
and producing the emitter and spectator. The emitter, naturally, then emits a
parton (giving rise to an IR singularity). The spectator is used to balance momentum
conservation [57] and contains information on the colour and spin correlations of the
real cross section. The auxiliary cross section may then be written as
dA =
dipoles
dB  dVdipole , (1.3.85)
where dVdipole are obtained from QCD factorisation formulae in the IR limits and 
symbol is used to describe the fact that spin and colour correlations are preserved.
In writing Eqn. 1.3.85 there is an implicit assumption that the phase space can
be factorised into one involving the n parton kinematics of the LO process and a
process independent single particle phase space associated with the decay of the
dipole. The single particle phase space therefore encapsulates the dependencies
1.3. Next-to-Leading Order Processes 41
that lead to the IR singularities. This factorisation allows the dipole term to be
analytically integrable and the auxiliary cross section may then be written as
dA =
dipoles
db 
dVdipole =
db  I
, (1.3.86)
where the I is clearly defined as
dipoles
dVdipole . (1.3.87)
We may therefore write the master equation for the NLO process as
NLO =
dipoles
dB  dVdipole
dV + dB  I
(1.3.88)
which can be integrated safely in a numerical procedure.
1.3.2 POWHEG
We would like to interface this ability to calculate NLO cross sections in a stable
numerical way with the parton shower to give us the total rate and hardest emission
accurate to NLO. There are two major ways of doing this - the first is the MC@NLO
method as described in Ref. [59] and the second is the POWHEG method first
described in Ref. [60]. We will briefly outline the POWHEG method here and invite
the reader to consult Ref. [59] for more information on MC@NLO.
In more detail, the NLO differential decay rate in the POWHEG [60,61] approach
d = B(n)dB
NLOR (p
T ) + 
R (pT )
R(n,1)
B(n)
, (1.3.89)
where
B(n) = B(n) + V (n) +
R(n,1)
Di(n,1)
d1. (1.3.90)
Here B(n) is the leading-order Born differential decay rate, V (n) the regularized
virtual contribution, Di(n,1) the counter terms regularizing the real emission and
R(n,1) the real emission contribution. The leading-order process has n outgoing
partons, with associated phase space n. The virtual and Born contributions depend
1.3. Next-to-Leading Order Processes 42
only on this n-body phase space. The real emission phase space, n+1, is factorised
into the n-body phase space and the phase space, 1, describing the radiation of an
extra parton.
The Sudakov form factor in the POWHEG method is
NLOR = exp
R(n,1)
B(n)
(k(n,1) p)
, (1.3.91)
where kT (n,1) is the transverse momentum of the emitted parton.
In the POWHEG method, the hardest emission is calculated first and then the
shower generates subsequent radiation. The reason for this is that the shower in
Herwig++ is not p ordered, but is instead ordered in angles. It is therefore possible
to have soft emissions before the hardest in the shower, however, in the POWHEG
approach, the first emission is meant to be the hardest.
The solution of this is the inclusion of what is called a vetoed truncated shower.
Firstly, as mentioned, the hardest emission is generated and then mapped back into
the shower variables (qh, zh, h), where we use h to denote the hardest. Then, we
start the shower as usual from the corresponding Born configuration and evolve
down to a state qh, vetoing any emission that has k greater than the hard p of
the hardest emission. Then, the hardest emission is inserted into the shower, and
the showering process continued from the qh scale as usual, however, any emissions
with k greater than the p of the hardest emission are again vetoed.
We therefore generate an event according to Eqn. 1.3.90 and the associated mo-
menta. Then, we map the hardest emission into the variables used in the Herwig++
shower. Then the truncated shower occurs, evolving down to the hardest emission,
where care is made to ensure that the flavour of the branching does not change and
then the hardest emission is inserted into the shower. The shower then restarts with
q = qh and all other external legs are showered with the condition that k < p
[37,6264]. This method has been shown to preserve the leading-log accuracy of the
shower in Ref. [61], in which also the NLO accuracy of Eqn. 1.3.90 is shown. We
will use the POWHEG method later in this thesis.
Chapter 2
Jet Substructure and Boosted
Higgs Studies
As mentioned in the introduction, Monte Carlo event generators contain a large
number of both perturbative and non-perturbative parameters which are tuned to
a wide range of experimental data. While significant effort has been devoted to
the tuning of the parameters to produce a best fit there has been much less effort
understanding the uncertainties in these results. Historically a best fit result, or at
best a small number of tunes, are produced and used to predict observables making
it difficult to assess the uncertainty on any prediction. The Perugia tunes [65,66]
have addressed this by producing a range of tunes by varying specific parameters in
the Pythia [49] event generator to produce an uncertainty.
Here we will make use of the Professor Monte Carlo tuning system [67] to give
an assessment of the uncertainty from tuning by varying all the parameters simul-
taneously about the best-fit values by diagonalizing the error matrix. This then
allows us to systematically estimate the uncertainty on any Monte Carlo prediction
from the tuning of the event generator. We will illustrate this by considering the
uncertainty on jet substructure searches for the Higgs boson at the LHC.
Jet substructure is set to play an important role in future studies of the Higgs
boson at the LHC. As the LHC takes increasing amounts of data it will be vital to
explore all channels for the Higgs boson decay and determine if the properties of the
observed Higgs boson are consistent with the Standard Model. As we clearly see in

Figure 2.1: The branching ratio of the Higgs boson with respect to mass using results
from Ref. [1].
Fig.2.1 the h0  b b mode is the largest for a light Higgs boson mass, however, for
many years it was believed that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to observe
the dominant h0  b b decay mode of a light Higgs boson. However, in recent years
the use of jet substructure [6883] offers the possibility of observing this mode.
Jet substructure for h0  b b as a Higgs boson search channel, was first stud-
ied in Ref. [68] building on previous work of a heavy Higgs boson decaying to W
bosons [79], high-energy WW scattering [84] and SUSY decay chains [85], and sub-
sequently reexamined in Refs. [71,78]. Recent studies at the LHC [8688] have also
shown this approach to be promising.
The study in Ref. [68] was carried out using the (FORTRAN) HERWIG 6.510
event generator [89, 90] together with the simulation of the underlying event using
JIMMY 4.31 [91]. In order to allow the inclusion of new theoretical developments
Chapter 2. Jet Substructure and Boosted Higgs Studies 45
and improvements in non-perturbative modelling a new simulation based on the
same physics philosophy Herwig++, currently version 2.6 [37, 92], is now preferred
for the simulation of hadronhadron collisions.
Herwig++ includes both an improved theoretical description of perturbative
QCD radiation, in particular for radiation from heavy quarks, such as bottom,
together with improved non-perturbative modelling, especially of multiple parton
parton scattering and the underlying event. In FORTRAN HERWIG a crude imple-
mentation of the dead-cone effect [44] meant that there was no radiation from heavy
quarks for evolution scales below the quark mass, rather than a smooth suppression
of soft collinear radiation. In Herwig++ an improved choice of evolution variable [93]
allows evolution down to zero transverse momentum for radiation from heavy par-
ticles and reproduces the correct soft limit. There have also been significant de-
velopments of the multiple-parton scattering model of the underlying event [94,95],
including colour reconnections [96] and tuning to LHC data [97].
The background to jet substructure searches for the Higgs boson comes from
QCD jets which mimic the decay of a boosted heavy particle. Although Herwig++
has performed well in some early studies of jet substructure [88,98,99], it is important
that we understand the uncertainties in our modelling of the background jets which
lie at the tail of the jet mass distribution.
In addition we improve the simulation of Higgs boson decay by implementing
the NLO corrections to Higgs boson decay to heavy quarks in the POWHEG [60,61]
formalism.
In the next section we outline the method of simulation for the h0  bb decays
and the POWHEG method. We then present our approach for the tuning of the
parameters, which effect QCD radiation and hadronization, in Herwig++ together
with the results of our new tune. We then recap the key features of the Butterworth,
Davison, Rubin and Salam (BDRS) jet substructure technique of Ref. [68]. This
is followed by our results using both the leading and next-to-leading-order matrix
elements in Herwig++ with implementation of the next-to-leading-order Higgs boson
decays and our estimate on the uncertainties.
We present an investigation of the dependence of searches for boosted Higgs

bosons using jet substructure on the perturbative and non-perturbative parameters
of the Herwig++ Monte Carlo event generator. Values are presented for a new
tune of the parameters of the event generator, together with the an estimate of the
uncertainties based on varying the parameters around the best-fit values.
2.1 Simulation of h0  bb using the POWHEG
Method
The POWHEG approach has already been covered briefly in the introduction to
this thesis. Here, we will look at it in slightly more detail and with respect to the
Higgs boson decay into a bottom quark anti-quark pair.
To recapitulate, the NLO differential decay rate in the POWHEG [60] approach
d = B(n)dB
NLOR (p
T ) + 
R(n,1)
B(n)
, (2.1.1)
where
B(n) = B(n) + V (n) +
R(n,1)
Di(n,1)
d1. (2.1.2)
Here B(n) is the leading-order Born differential decay rate, V (n) the regularized
virtual contribution, Di(n,1) the counter terms regularizing the real emission and
R(n,1) the real emission contribution. The leading-order process has n outgoing
partons, with associated phase space n. The virtual and Born contributions depend
only on this n-body phase space. The real emission phase space, n+1, is factorised
into the n-body phase space and the phase space, 1, describing the radiation of an
extra parton.
In order to implement the decay of the Higgs boson in the POWHEG scheme
in Herwig++ we need to generate the Born configuration according to Eqn. 2.1.2
and the subsequent hardest emission according to Eqn. 1.3.91. The generation of
the truncated and vetoed parton showers from these configurations then proceeds
as described in Refs. [37, 6264].

the counter terms can become negative in some regions, we use
R(n,1)
Di(n,1) =
R(n,1) |Di(n,1)|
|Dj(n,1)|
Di(n,1)
. (2.1.5)
We have also regulated singularities in the virtual term V (n) with the integrated
counter terms from the Catani-Seymour subtraction scheme allowing us to generate
the Born configuration according to B(n).

. (2.1.6)
However, this form is not suitable for the generation of the hardest emission. In-
stead we perform a Jacobian transformation and use the transverse momentum, pT ,
rapidity, y, and azimuthal angle, , of the radiated gluon to define the phase space
The momenta of the Higgs boson decay products are

where partons 1, 2, 3 are the radiating bottom quark, spectator antibottom quark
and radiated gluon, respectively. The energy fractions xi =
. Using the conservation of momentum in the z-direction and
x1 + x2 + x3 = 2 gives
x2 = (2 x1  x2)
2  (2 + 2x1 + 2x2  x2x1  x2
x22  42
. (2.1.8)
Together with the definition, x3 = x cosh y, we obtain the Jacobianx1x2pTy

(x1x2  22(x1 + x2) + x22  x2)
, (2.1.9)
for the transformation of the radiation variables.
We can then generate the additional radiation according to Eqn. 2.1.6 using the
veto algorithm [49]. To achieve this we use an overestimate of the integrand in the
Sudakov form factor, f(pT ) =
, where c is a suitable constant. We first generate
an emission according to
overR (pT ) = exp
 pmax
 ymax
d pT d y
, (2.1.10)
2.1. Simulation of h0  bb using the POWHEG Method 49
using this overestimate, where ymax = cosh
2pmin
, ymin = ymax, pmaxT is the
maximum possible transverse momentum of the gluon and pminT is a parameter set
in the model, taken to be 1 GeV.
The trial value of the transverse momentum is obtained by solving R = overR ,
where R is a random number in [0, 1], i.e.
pT = p
c(ymaxymin) . (2.1.11)
Once the trial pT has been generated, y and  are also generated uniformly between
[ymin, ymax] and [0, 2], respectively. The energy fractions of the partons are obtained
using the definition x3 = x cosh y,
2(x3  1)
3x3  2 +
x3  x2  x23
(x23  x2)((x3  1)(42 + x3  1) 2x2)
, (2.1.12)
and x2 using energy conservation. As there are two solutions for x1 both solutions
must be kept and used to calculate the weight for a particular trial pT . The signs of
the z-components of the momenta are fixed by the sign of the rapidity and momen-
tum conservation. Any momentum configurations outside of the physically allowed
phase space are rejected and a new set of variables generated. The momentum con-
figuration is accepted with a probability given by the ratio of the true integrand to
the overestimated value. If the configuration is rejected, the procedure continues
with pmaxT set to the rejected pT until the trial value of pT is accepted or falls below
the minimum allowed value, pminT . This procedure generates the radiation variables
correctly as shown in Ref. [49].
This procedure is used to generate a trial emission from both the bottom and an-
tibottom. The hardest potential emission is then selected which correctly generates
events according to Eqn. 2.1.6 using this competition algorithm.
As a first check on our results, we can check the jet merging scale, where the
jet goes from a n  n + 1 jet event, comparing the Herwig++ default mode for
the decays and the new POWHEG implementation. The e+e jet measure, for the

We would clearly expect to see more three jet events with the POWHEG method,
and this is seen in Fig. 2.1 where the POWHEG method causes the scale at which
we go from a two to a three jet event to be higher than in the LO case.
2.2 Tuning Herwig++
Any jet substructure analysis is sensitive to changes in the simulation of initial- and
final-state radiation, and hadronization. In particular the non-perturbative nature
of the phenomenological hadronization model means there are a number of parame-
ters which are tuned to experimental results. We have already seen that Herwig++
1 More information on jet algorithms and jets in general can be found in Appendix B.
2.2. Tuning Herwig++ 51
uses an improved angular-ordered parton shower algorithm [37, 93] to describe per-
turbative QCD radiation together with a cluster hadronization model [37,53].
To tune Herwig++, and investigate the dependency of observables on the shower
and hadronization parameters, the Professor Monte Carlo tuning system [67] was
used. Professor uses the Rivet analysis framework [101] and a number of simulated
event samples, with different Monte Carlo parameters, to parameterise the depen-
dence of each observable2 used in the tuning on the parameters of the Monte Carlo
event generator. A heuristic chi-squared function
 2(p) =
f b(p)Rb
, (2.2.14)
is constructed where p is the set of parameters being tuned, O are the observables
used each with weight wO, b are the different bins in each observable distribution
with associated experimental measurementRb, error b and Monte Carlo prediction
f b(p). Weighting of those observables for which a good description of the experi-
mental result is particularly important is used in most cases. The parameterisation
of the event generator response, f(p), is then used to minimize the  2 and find the
optimum parameter values.
There are ten main free parameters which affect the shower and hadronization
in Herwig++. These are shown in Table 2.1 along with their default values and
allowed ranges.
The gluon mass, GluonMass, is required to allow the non-perturbative decay of
gluons into qq pairs and controls the energy release in this process. PSplitLight,
ClPowLight and ClMaxLight control the mass distributions of the clusters produced
during the fission of heavy clusters. ClSmrLight controls the smearing of the direc-
tion of hadrons containing a (anti)quark from the perturbative evolution about the
direction of the (anti)quark. AlphaMZ is strong coupling at the Z0 boson mass and
controls the amount of QCD radiation in the parton shower, while Qmin controls the
infrared behaviour of the strong coupling. pTmin is the minimum allowed transverse
momentum in the parton shower and controls the amount of radiation and the scale
2Normally this is either an observation such as a multiplicity or a bin in a measured distribution.

Previous experience of tuning Herwig++ has found that Qmin, GluonMass,
ClSmrLight, and ClPowLight to be flat, and so it was chosen to fix these at their
default values [37].
To determine the allowed variation of these parameters Professor was used to tune
the variables in Table 2.1 to the observables and weights found in Tables 2.2, 2.3,
2.4 and 2.5. The dependence of 2 on the various parameters, about the minimum
2 value, is then diagonalized.
The variation of the parameters along the eigenvectors in parameter space ob-
tained corresponding to a certain change,  2, in  2 can then be used to predict
the uncertainty in the Monte Carlo predictions for specific observables.
In theory, if the  2 measure for the parameterised generator response is actually
distributed as a true 2, then a change in the goodness of fit of one will correspond
to a one sigma deviation from the minima, i.e. the best tune. In practice, even the

best tune does not fit the data ideally and nor is the  2 measure actually distributed
according to a true 2 distribution. This means that one cannot just use Professor
to vary the parameters about the minima to a given deviation in the  2 measure
without using some subjective opinion on the quality of the results.
We simulated one thousand event samples with different randomly selected values
of the parameters we were tuning. Six hundred of these were used to interpolate the
generator response. All the event samples were used to select two hundred samples
2.2. Tuning Herwig++ 56
randomly two hundred times in a bootstrapping type process in order to assess the
systematics of the interpolation and tuning procedure. A cubic interpolation of the
generator response was used as this has been shown to give a good description of the
Monte Carlo behaviour in the region of best generator response [67]. The parameters
were varied between values shown in Table 2.1. The quality of the interpolation was
checked by comparing the  2/Ndf , where Ndf is the number of observable bins used
in the tune, in the allowed parameter range on a parameter by parameter basis
for the observables by comparing the interpolation response with actual generator
response at the simulated parameter values. Bad regions were removed and the
interpolation repeated leaving a volume in the 5-dimensional parameter space where
the interpolation worked well.
Fig. 2.4 shows the  2/Ndf distributions for two hundred tunes based on two
hundred randomly selected event samples points for the cubic interpolation. The
spread of these values gives an idea of the systematics of the tuning process showing
that we have obtained a good fit for our parameterisation of the generator response.
The line indicates the tune which is based on a cubic interpolation from six
hundred event samples. It is this interpolation which was used to vary  2 about
the minimum to assess the uncertainty on the measured distributions. During the
tune it was discovered that PSplitLight was relatively insensitive to the observables
used in the tune. As such, PSplitLight was fixed at the default value of 1.20 during
the tune and subsequent  2 variation.
Professor was used to vary  2 about the minimum value, as described above, de-
termining the allowed range for the parameters. As five parameters were eventually
varied, there are 10 new sample points - one + and one - along each eigenvector
direction in parameter space.
We follow the example set by the parton distribution function (PDF) fitting
groups in determining how much to allow  2 to vary. Our situation is different to the
PDF fitters in that we are using leading-order calculations with leading-log accuracy
in the parton shower, where they fit to next-to-leading order calculations which gives
better overall agreement with the observables used. Generally, PDF groups fit to
fully inclusive variables, where as we have fitted to more exclusive processes and by

 2global 6 T
2. (2.2.15)
A tolerance parameter of T  10 to 15 is generally chosen for the PDF groups, where
they are fitting to around 1300 data points. As our fit is likley to have a higher 2
than their fit due to the aforementioned reasons, and that we fit to a greater number
of observables, we will have a higher tolerance parameter.
In our fit, we have 1665 degrees-of-freedom and we examined various changes
in  2, whilst considering the effects of the precision data from LEP. A variation
of  2/Ndf = 5, equivalent to T  90 seems, subjectively to keep the LEP data
within reasonable limits while a variation of  2/Ndf = 10, i.e. T  130 is too
large. Anything less than T  40 had very little variation and was therefore deemed
inappropriate. The values for both  2/Ndf = 5 and 
 2/Ndf = 10 are shown in
Tables 2.6 and Tables 2.7 respectively.

available in Rivet and subsequently accessible to Professor. Looking at Fig. 2.7 it
is found that PSplitLight at a value of 0.90 is favoured and gives a significant
reduction in the  2/Ndf . It was therefore decided to use the values obtained from
minimisation procedure, but using the value of 0.90 for PSplitLight to maintain a
good overall description of the data. The new minima for the QCD parameters are
summarized in the Table 2.1. Examples of the new tune and the uncertainty band
are shown in Figs. 2.5 and 2.6 for the out-of-plane transverse momentum and thrust
measured by DELPHI [2].
These error tune values can now be used to predict the uncertainty from the tun-
ing of the shower parameters on any observable. In the next section we will present
an example of using these tunes to estimate the uncertainty on the predictions for

the production of h0Z0 and h0W. Ref. [68] uses the fact that the Higgs boson
predominantly decays to b b in a jet substructure analysis to extract the signal of
a boosted Higgs boson above the various backgrounds. Their study found that the

momenta, rapidities and azimuthal angles of jets 1 and 2, respectively, then j
is in the heavy particle region. If the jet is not in the heavy particle region
the procedure is repeated using the first jet.
This algorithm requires that j1,2 are b-tagged and takes  = 0.67 and ycut = 0.09. A
uniform b-tagging efficiency of 60% was used with a uniform mistagging probability

of 2%. The heavy jet selected by this procedure is considered to be the Higgs
boson candidate jet. Finally, there is a filtering procedure on the Higgs boson
candidate jet, j. The jet, j, is resolved on a finer scale by setting a new radius
Rfilt = min(0.3, Rbb/2), where from the previous mass-drop condition, Rbb = R
j1,j2
The three hardest subjets of this filtering process are taken to be the Higgs boson
decay products, where the two hardest are required to be b-tagged.
All three analyses require that:
 after the reconstruction of the vector boson, there are no additional leptons
with pseudorapidity || < 2.5 and pT > 30 GeV;
 other than the Higgs boson candidate, there are no additional b-tagged jets
with pseudorapidity || < 2.5 and pT > 50 GeV.
In addition, due to top contamination, criterion (c) requires that other than the
Higgs boson candidate, there are no additional jets with || < 3 and pT > 30 GeV.
For all events, the candidate Higgs boson jet should have pT > p
T . The analyses
were implemented using the Rivet system [101].
The simulations in this Chapter were produced before the announcement of the
discovery of a new boson of mass around 125 GeV [107,108], which is a candidate SM
Higgs boson, and so the mass of the Higgs boson was assumed to be 115 GeV from
the LEP bounds. We expect a difference in mass of 10 GeV to have no siginifcant
effect on the results presented.
First we show in Fig. 2.8 the results of the analyses when used with HERWIG as
a proof of methodology, when compared to the plots in Ref. [68]. The plots shown in
Fig. 2.9 use the leading-order matrix elements for the production and decay of Higgs
boson but the W , Z and top [109] have matrix element corrections for their decays.
The plots shown in Fig. 2.10 have leading-order tt production, leading-order vector
boson plus jet production (with the same matrix element corrections as the LO
matrix elements) but the NLO vector boson pair production [110] and NLO vector
and Higgs boson associated production [63]. In addition we have implemented the
corrections to the decay h0  b b in the POWHEG scheme, as described earlier.
The signal significances are outlined in Table 2.8.

2.4 Conclusions
While significant effort has been devoted to the tuning of the parameters to produce
a best fit there has been much less effort understanding the uncertainties in these
results. In this chapter we have produced a set of tunes which can be used to
assess this uncertainty using the Herwig++ Monte Carlo event generator. We note

that usually statistical errors are the only errors shown on results produced with a
Monte Carlo event generator, however, we have not shown these here as the aim is
to emphasise the new tuning errors we have produced.
We then used these tunes to assess the uncertainties on the mass-drop analysis
of Ref. [68] using Herwig++ with both leading- and next-to-leading-order matrix
elements including a POWHEG simulation of the decay h0  b b.
We have verified the results of Ref. [68] and extended this by using improved
simulation of certain aspects of the radiation. Although not currently being used at
the LHC as a discovery channel, we have seen that there is potential, with further
improvements, to use the predominant decay of a light Higgs boson to bottom
quarks, via jet substructure, as a discovery channel. This technique may also be
used to gain insight into the coupling of a light Higgs boson to bottom quarks.
However, before we can embark on large studies using jet substructure we need
to be confident of our tunes to investigate this with Monte Carlo simulations and it
is the process undertaken here that gives us that confidence. In addition, the error
tunes and procedure outlined in this chapter can now be used in other analyses
where the uncertainty due to the Monte Carlo simulation is important.
There is still room for improvement in the simulation of process that will affect
a jet substructure analysis. This includes, for example, a better study of the g  b b
splitting as implemented in a Monte Carlo event generator. Clearly the g  b b
splitting is important in an analysis as undertaken here, so further study including
topics such as choice of scale for the coupling and whether to angular order this
splitting would be beneficial.
Also, as further data comes out from the LHC with its complex hadronic final
states, including effects of underlying event in the tune would also be helpful as
any study of jet substructure will be sensitive to underlying event. This could
include the effects of new and different underlying event models and their effect on
jet substructure and any effects from the tuning of the underlying event models to
data.

Improved Simulation of Soft
Radiation in the Production and
Decay of Unstable Particles
Following the discovery of the top quark [111, 112] the measurement of the top
quark mass has been refined using a succession of ever more sophisticated analy-
sis techniques. The latest result, mt = 173.18 0.56 (stat) 0.75 (syst) GeV, [113]
from the Tevatron experiments, has an error of less than 1 GeV. While
the early measurements by the LHC experiments had larger errors the
latest CMS preliminary measurement using a combination of channels,
mt = 173.36 0.38 (stat) 0.91 (syst) GeV [114], and ATLAS measurement in the
lepton plus jets channel, mt = 174.5 0.6 (stat) 2.3 (syst) GeV [115], have errors
which are approaching that of the Tevatron measurement. These results rely on
Monte Carlo simulations of top quark production and decay either directly in
Template methods [116118] or in extracting corrections in Matrix Element Meth-
ods [119121].
As the top quark is heavier than the W boson its lifetime is shorter than
hadronization timescale making it unique in decaying before the formation of top
hadrons. In Monte Carlo simulations this is simulated by first simulating the hard
process in which the top quark is produced, followed by the subsequent evolution,
via perturbative gluon radiation, to the cut-off scale. The decay of the top quark is
Chapter 3. Improved Simulation of Soft Radiation in the Production
and Decay of Unstable Particles 69
then simulated as a hard perturbative process, due to the large perturbative scale
provided by the top quark mass, and evolved to the cut-off scale using the parton-
shower algorithm.
As the error on the top quark mass decreases it is essential that we understand the
relationship between the experimentally measured quantity and the perturbative top
quark mass defined in a rigorous renormalisation scheme [122125]1. An alternative
to measuring the top quark mass using kinematic variables is to extract it from the
top quark pair production cross section [126], however while defined in a specific
renormalisation scheme the current results from this approach have a much larger
error, e.g. mt = 170 7 GeV [127]
In particular from the point of view of Monte Carlo simulations, in addition
to the top mass and infrared cut-off scale, the top quark width (t) provides an
additional scale in the production and subsequent decay of the top quark. While
gluons with energies above the top quark width (E  t) can resolve the production
and decay of the top quark, gluons with very low energies (E  t) cannot resolve
the presence of the top quark and in terms of a Monte Carlo simulation should be
regarded as if they are emitted from the top decay products without any knowledge
of the top quark. First studies of this effect for e+e initiated top quark production
process can be found in Ref. [128].
While in top quark production this may not be a significant effect because the top
quark width (t  1.4 GeV) is already close to the infrared cut-off scale given the ever
decreasing error on the top quark mass, it must be investigated. Equally, while this
may not be an important effect in the Standard Model in models of physics Beyond
the Standard Model (BSM) there are often heavy strongly interacting particles with
much larger widths where these effects will be greater.
In this chapter we present a systematic approach to include the width in these
simulations. We start by recalculating the existing radiation patterns, using tech-
niques from chapter 1, for single gluon emission in the soft limit in top quark produc-
tion from quarkquark, gluon-gluon and e+e initial states, followed by extending

these calculations to double gluon emission in the same limit for both processes.
We also calculate the patterns for stop production. This allows us to interpret the
patterns in terms of an algorithm for implementation in a Monte Carlo event genera-
tor. Finally, we show the effect of implementing the new algorithm in the Herwig++
Monte Carlo event generator on the determination of the top mass.

3.1.1 Top Quark Pair Production in HadronHadron Colli-
sions
The main production mechanisms for top quarks in hadronhadron collisions are
shown in Figs. 3.1 and 3.2. At the Tevatron the quark-antiquark production mech-
3.1. Radiation Patterns 71
anism is dominant due to the presence of valance antiquarks in the incoming an-
tiproton, while at the LHC due to the large gluon parton density at higher energies
and protonproton initial state the gluon-gluon production mechanism dominates.
The radiation patterns for single gluon emission have already been covered in
detail in the literature [44,129131], however, we repeat it here as validation of our
methodology2 and in order to interpret the radiation patterns in terms of implemen-
tation in a Monte Carlo simulation.
We first consider the soft radiation from the process qq  tt including the
decays of the top quark, t bW+, and anti-top quark t bW. The leading-order
Feynman diagram and unique colour flow for this process are shown in Fig. 3.1.
We make use of the results from Ref. [131] and, as we will be using the same basic
approach for a number of processes, we give the details of the calculation for this
process.

2We automated the calculation of the Feynman diagrams and associated currents. We first used
FeynArts [132] to produce the Feynman diagrams for the processes with the appropriate number
of external gluons. The FORM [36] output of FeynArts was then taken and a set of eikonal rules
applied within FORM to generate the set of dipoles for each diagram. The resulting expression was
then manipulated in Mathematica using FeynCalc [133] to produce an expression for the radiation
pattern.

The bottom and anti-bottom quarks have 4-momenta pb and pb, respectively. The

we will neglect sub-leading terms in the number of colours NC = 3, but they are

Here there is only one colour flow and the leading contribution in NC to the

There are two important limits of this result. The first is qt,t  k Mtt. In this
limit Ct,t(k) 0 and the radiation pattern is
F = CA
Wp1,t +Wb,t +Wp2,t +Wb,t
. (3.1.8)
In this case we have radiation from the dipole formed by the light and top quarks,
and light antiquark and anti-top quark in the hard process and between the top-
bottom dipole in both the top quark and antiquark decays.
The second limit is qt,t  k  Mtt. In this limit Ct,t(k)  1 and the radiation
pattern is
F = CA
Wp1,b +Wp2,b
, (3.1.9)
which corresponds to the case where the radiation cannot resolve the production
of the top quarks and is from the dipoles formed by the incoming (anti)quark and
outgoing (anti)bottom quark.
In order to interpret that radiation pattern in terms of a parton-shower algorithm
the standard approach is to split the dipole radiation function into two parts as in
Eqn. 1.2.37.
In the FORTRAN version of HERWIG the decomposition [44]
W iij =
2i i
ij  i
(3.1.10)
was used. However, in Herwig++ different shower variables [37] are used and there
is no corresponding exact decomposition in the soft limit. The Herwig++ shower
algorithm is constructed by requiring that the upper limits of the parton-shower
evolution variable for the two colour-connected particles are chosen in order to cover
the phase space in the soft limit, with the best possible approximation to the correct
angular distribution. This leads to a different approximation to the eikonal result
in the two disjoint regions of phase space filled by radiation from the two particles.
However, the approximations to the radiation functions W
i,shower
ij and W
j,shower
ij in
the Herwig++ shower algorithm still ensure that W
i,shower
ij contains the collinear
singularity for emission from i and W
j,shower
ij contains the collinear singularity for
emission from j in the ij dipole.
3.1. Radiation Patterns 74
In both the FORTRAN HERWIG and Herwig++ this decomposition is done in
different frames for the different dipoles, e.g. in the centre-of-mass frame for the
production of the top quarks and in their rest frame for the decay. We can calculate
the shower decomposition of the radiation functions in the Herwig++ shower vari-
ables using the kinematics outlined in Ref. [93], upon which the Herwig++ shower
is based. We now look at each of these cases in turn.
Shower Approximation
Final-Final Connection
In a final-final colour connection, for a colour singlet in the process a  b + c the
momentum of a is preserved and, working in its rest frame [93],
pa = Q(1, 0, 0, 0) , pb =
Q(1 + b c, 0, 0, ) , pc =
Q(1 b+ c, 0, 0,) ,
(3.1.11)
where p2a = Q
2, b = m2b/Q
2, c = m2c/Q
2 and
 = (1, b, c) 
(1 + b c)2  4b =
(1 b+ c)2  4c . (3.1.12)
Making use of the e+e  tt process, in the new variables the emission proba-
bility from the top in the dipole, formed by the tt pair is
2(2)3
d cos dg2sCFW
i,shower
ij (3.1.13)
where  is the angle between the emitting particle, b, and the gluon, the angle  is
the azimuthal angle and  the gluons energy. From these we find that the shower
approximation to the radiation function is
t,shower
2(1 + b c+ )
(1 + cos )(1 + b c  cos ) 
(1 + b c  cos )2 . (3.1.14)
Decay Colour Connection
For processes where the decay is colour connected, e.g. the process b c+ a where
a is a colour singlet and the decaying parton b and outgoing parton c are colour-
connected, the momentum of the decaying parton b is preserved, therefore we work
3.1. Radiation Patterns 75
in its rest frame,
pb = mb(1, 0, 0, 0) , pc =
mb(1 a+ c, 0, 0, ) , pa =
mb(1 + a c, 0, 0,) ,
(3.1.15)
where a = m2a/m
b , c = m
b and now
 = (1, a, c) =
(1 + a c)2  4a =
(1 a+ c)2  4c . (3.1.16)
Making use of the t W+b process, in the new variables the emission probability
from the top quark in the dipole, formed by the tb pair is,
2(2)3
d cos dg2sCFW
t,shower
tb , (3.1.17)
where  is the angle of the gluon with respect to the bottom quark in the rest frame
of the decaying top and [109]
t,shower
1 + cos 
1 cos  . (3.1.18)
The radiation from the bottom, in the top rest frame has the same form as for the
top in the final-final colour connection.
Initial-Initial Colour Connection
For processes where the initial state particles are colour connected, the inverse pro-
cess b+ c a where a is a colour singlet of invariant mass Q and b, c are beam jets,
is considered. The beam jets are taken to be massless in the centre of mass frame
and we therefore have
pa = Q(1, 0, 0, 0) , pb =
Q(1, 0, 0, 1) , pc =
Q(1, 0, 0,1) . (3.1.19)
Making use of the qq  Z0 process, in the new variables the emission probability
from the top in the dipole, formed by the qq pair is,
2(2)3
d cos dg2sCFW
q,shower
qq (3.1.20)
where
q,shower
qq =
sin2 
(3.1.21)
where  is the angle of the gluon with respect to the emitting particle. The radiation
off the anti-quark has the same form as radiation off the quark.
3.1. Radiation Patterns 76
Initial-Final Colour Connection
For a process with an initial-final colour connection, we consider the process a+b c
where a is a colour singlet. We need to preserve the momentum of a and therefore
work in the Breit frame:
pa = Q(0, 0, 0,1) , pb =
Q(1 + c, 0, 0, 1 + c) , pc =
Q(1 + c, 0, 0,1 + c) ,
(3.1.22)
where p2a = Q2, p2b = 0, and m2c = cQ2. The beam parton b is always taken as
massless, but the outgoing parton c can be massive.
Making use of the DIS qi
  qf process, in the new variables the emission
probability from initial state quark in the dipole, formed by the qiqf pair is,
2(2)3
d cos dg2sCFW
qi,shower
(3.1.23)
where
W qi,showerqiqf =
sin2 
(3.1.24)
where  is the angle of the gluon with respect to the emitting particle.
The radiation off the final state quark qf takes the form
qf ,shower
qiqf =
4(1 cos )
(1 + cos )(1 + c cos (1 c))2 , (3.1.25)
where the emission probability takes a similar form.
Armed with this knowledge, we are now in a position to calculate radiation
patterns. In producing the radiation patterns below, we use the configuration as
shown in Fig. 3.3 [131]. We take the mass of the top mt = 174.2 GeV and the width
of the top t = 1.4 GeV. The energy of each beam particle was 2mt, giving a total
centre-of-mass energy
s = 4mt. This ensures the top quarks are produced above
threshold.
In Fig. 3.4 we show the radiation pattern associated with this process. Through-
out, the full result is the full calculation including all subleading terms, the full
shower approximation is the full expression with the W functions replaced by the
shower approximation, the leading term is the leading NC approximation and the

leading shower approximation is the shower approximation to the leading NC con-
tribution. We note on the plot the suppression of radiation associated with emission
around the bottom quarks at 45o and 225o, owing to the bottom quark having finite
mass. We also see the singularity associated with the incoming quarks at 180o and
0o along with the top quarks at 90o and 270o.
We can interpret this radiation pattern as the radiation from the incoming quark
and outgoing top quark dipole being suppressed by (1 Ct) and radiation from the
dipole formed by the incoming quark and bottom being suppressed by Ct. The
same applies for the other colour dipoles in the radiation pattern, but with Ct being
replaced with Ct. It is also worth nothing that the leading colour contribution is very
similar to the full result and therefore taking the leading contribution is actually
providing a good approximation.
The gluon-gluon initial state is more complicated because the leading-order ma-
trix element decomposes into two terms corresponding to t-channel and u-channel
colour flows as shown in Fig. 3.5. The interference of these two terms makes iden-
tifying the colour flows in the planar limit difficult [131]. However, in the large
NC limit this interference is suppressed and we are left with a separation into two
positive definite colour flows as discussed in Ref. [129].

features are repeated in the other radiation patterns we will display here. We also
note that the leading approximation as employed in the shower interpretation is
performing well, meaning in the collinear region of interest the approximation is
good.

We have chosen to normalise the h(t, s) and h(u, s) functions by the leading-order

We can interpret the radiation pattern as the radiation from the top quark gluon
and top-bottom dipoles being suppressed by (1 Ct). The same applies for the anti-
particles, but with (1 Ct) (1 Ct). There is additional soft radiation from the

In calculating the radiation patterns for two gluons, we work in the strongly or-
dered limit, where the first emission is harder than the second. We introduce the no-
tation below as Wij = Wij(k1), W
ij = Wij(k2), Ct(t) = Ct(t)(k1) and
Dt(t) = Ct(t)(k2) and, as we are in the strongly ordered limit, k1  k2 where k1,2 are
the 4-momenta for the first and second gluon emission, respectively. In the radiation
patterns produced below, we fix the first gluon at 340o to the incoming beam, away
from the other particles, and we vary the angle of the second gluon as before.

Despite calculating the full pattern including subleading terms, owing to the size
and number of terms of the full radiation pattern, we only show the leading NC
contribution in Eq. 3.1.31 and show numerically the comparison to the full result in

1Dt terms mean that is Ct if large, then 1Dt is small. Fig. 3.7 shows a plot of

The interpretation of this radiation pattern is more complicated than in the single
gluon emission case, but guides us in developing our algorithm. The dipoles from
the single emission case are suppressed by the same amount, and now multiplying
them, is radiation from the second emission which is suppressed in a similar way as
3.1. Radiation Patterns 83
in the single emission case. We see new dipoles formed by, for example, the incoming
quark and outgoing gluon that are unsuppressed and dipoles formed by the outgoing
gluon and top quark being suppressed by (1Dt), and between the outgoing gluon
and bottom quark by Dt.

which are omitted for exactly the same reasons as those in Eqn. 3.1.32.
The interpretation of this radiation pattern is similar to the qq case. The dipoles
from the single emission case are suppressed by the same amount, and now multi-
plying them, is radiation from the second emission which is suppressed in a similar
way as to the single case. We see new dipoles formed by, for example, the incoming
quark and outgoing gluon that are unsuppressed and dipoles formed by the outgoing
gluon and top quark being suppressed by (1Dt), and between the outgoing gluon
and bottom quark by Dt.
3.1.2 e+e  tt
For the e+e initiated process, the radiation pattern is [134]
F = CF [Wtt (1 + Ctt  Ct  Ct) +Wtb (1 Ct) +Wtb (1 Ct) +WbbCtt+

where the + case is when both particles are in the hard process, and  otherwise.
For the previous radiation patterns it was not necessary to decompose the dipole
radiation functions into the two shower contributions. However doing so here allows
us to extract a part of the tt, tb and tb dipoles such that the collinear singularities
in the interference term cancel. This gives

The radiation pattern produced from this process is shown in Fig. 3.11. We can
interpret this radiation pattern as the radiation from the top anti-top and top bottom
dipoles being suppressed by (1 Ct) with the radiation from the bottom quarks
being suppressed by a similar amount. The same applies for the anti-particles, but
with (1 Ct). There is additional soft radiation from the bottom anti-bottom quark
dipole with radiation suppressed by Ct, or Ct depending on whether it is the bottom
or anti-bottom radiating the gluon. We discard the remainder function, F e+ett as
it contains no collinear singularities and is therefore supressed in the collinear limit.

3.2 SUSY Processes
We now turn our attention to SUSY processes, notably production of stop squarks.
The fact that there are now two heavy particles occurring in a decay chain means
that an extra width and mass scale has been introduced over the previous section,
notably the stop squark width and mass. Understanding radiation patterns involving
a decay chain of heavy particles will guide us in developing the algorithm for more
complicated processes such as these.

Using a similar approach as in Section 3.1.2, and defining in this case
Mtt
dq2t dq
t dq
t [J  J
] , (3.2.38)
we find the radiation patterns for processes involving two heavy particles decaying.
Below, we set the kinematics as in Fig. 3.3, except we now have the top squarks
moving perpendicular to the beam direction, with the top quarks at 20o from the
stops and the bottom quarks at 45o from the stops i.e. 25o from the tops. We
assume mt = 400 GeV, t = 0.57 GeV and m0 = 50 GeV.

and is shown in Fig. 3.13. We see similar features as to the patterns shown earlier,
with the dips in the pattern associated with the finite mass of the bottom quarks.
This radiation pattern can be interpreted in a similar way as before with the radia-
tion from the top stop dipole and top bottom dipoles being suppressed by (1 Ct).
There is similar suppression between the incoming quark and stop dipole and stop
top dipole with a supression factor of (1 Ct) and similarly for the anti particles
but with (1 Ct) or (1 Ct) depending on whether it is the top quark or top
squark. There is then additional soft radiation between the bottom and incoming
quark dipole supressed by Ct or Ct depending on whether the radiation is from the
incoming quark or bottom. There is a similar suppression for the anti-particles but
with the obvious replacements of the Ci functions.
The remainder function, Fqqtt is given by
F qqtt =

The Feynman diagram for this process is shown in Fig. 3.14. We have divided by

We therefore discard this remainder function in interpreting and implementing
the radiation patterns in terms of a Monte Carlo event generator. A plot for this
process is shown in Fig. 3.15, where the radiation pattern is dominated by the
outgoing partons with the remaining feature at around 90o being from radiation
from the top stop dipole.
Here radiation from the top and stop quarks in their production and decay is
suppressed by (1Ct) and (1Ct) respectively. Finally there is soft radiation from
the dipole formed by the bottom and anti-bottom quarks which is suppressed by Ct
or Ct depending on which quark is emitting.
3.3 Algorithm
Improving the simulation of radiation in heavy particle production and decay in a
Monte Carlo event generator requires an algorithm based on the interpretation of
the radiation patterns above. From the radiation patterns, with special note to the
double emission radiation patterns in Eqs. 3.1.31 and 3.1.33, we see that particles
still colour connected to the unstable particle have their radiation suppressed by a
factor (1Ci), where i is the heavy particle, in the simulation of QCD radiation in
the production and decay of heavy particles. Finally there is a new soft contribution
with radiation from the dipole formed by parent and decay products of the unstable
particle where the probability of radiation is proportional to Ci. Here the parent
is either the colour connected incoming particle for an unstable particle produced
in the hard process or in the case of an unstable particle produced in the decay of

a heavier particle the heavy particle. In the case of the unstable colour connected
particles as in e+e  tt the decay products are colour connected. Below we refer
to the first stage of the shower as the hard shower and the soft remaining piece
as the soft shower.
Referring to the example of top production, we therefore modify the Sudakov
form factor to include the appropriate suppression factor S (Ct), i.e the new Sudakov
form factor is
ijij (q, qh) = exp
 qh
dq2
S (z, q
S (Ct) Pijij (z, q
. (3.3.43)
This can be implemented as an additional step in the veto algorithm [49]
which is used to calculate the Sudakov form factor and generate radiation in most
Monte Carlo event generators. Therefore, during the shower process, we accept
the radiation off a particle colour connected to the top quark during the hard
shower using the veto algorithm, such that we accept the radiation according to
S (Ct) = 1Ct > R, where the uniform random number R is between [0, 1]. If the
particle is not colour connected to the top quark, then S (Ct) = 1 and the standard
shower algorithm applies.

Secondary radiation from gluons requires a slightly different treatment. We apply
the new Sudakov form factor with suppression factor S (Ct) =
(2  Ct) but then,
we choose which colour line radiates according to the new probabilities and 1 Ct
and 1 depending on which line is colour connected to the top quark as shown in
Fig. 3.16.
At the end of the shower, a new soft shower is constructed using the particles
that terminate the top quarks colour lines and applying the correction of S (Ct) = Ct
to radiation during this process.
3.4 Results
The effects of the new multi-scale shower were tested by observing the effect on
the reconstructed top quark mass. The Rivet [101] system was used. The in-built
MC TTBAR analysis proceeds by looking for a semi-leptonically decaying W boson
 require a charged lepton, pT > 30 GeV;
 require /ET > 30 GeV;
 rejecting any event with less than 4 jets, where each jet has pT > 30 GeV, and
the hardest has pT > 60 GeV and the second hardest has pT > 50 GeV;
 require two b-tagged jets, where 100% efficiency is assumed;
 require the two light jets to reconstruct the W boson mass.
3.4. Results 95
As the top mass is not known a priori, the b-tagged jets are combined into pairs
and the mass of the pairs binned. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 3.17.
We see a suppression in the top mass spectrum with hadronization switched off and
the new multi-scale shower switched on, but the effect of the new multi-scale shower
are degraded upon the inclusion of hadronization effects. This is not unsurprising
as hadronization is a model dependent process and introduces a coarse graining
compared to the parton-level simulation.

We also examined the use of the HEPTopTagger algorithm as described in Refs. [78,
135]. There, the analysis proceeds by using the Cambridge/Aachen algorithm using
R = 1.5 and:
 require two or more hard jets and a lepton where the jet satisfies
pT jet > 200 GeV, |yjet| < 4, and the lepton satisfies pT lepton > 15 GeV and
|yjet| < 2.5;
 require one or two of the jets to pass the top tagger and if two pass, the one
whose top candidate mass is closest to the top mass is chosen.
A window of 150  200 GeV was chosen for the top mass in the HEPTopTagger
algorithm.
We show the results of this analysis in Fig. 3.18 where we see a slight change
around the top mass peak both with and without hadronization on, but hadroniza-
tion significantly reduces the effect of the inclusion of the new multi-scale shower.
We also show the effects of increasing the width on the MC TTBAR analysis in
Fig. 3.19.

heavy top quarks decay into two SM top quarks. We assumed the mass of the heavy
top quarks to be 1400 GeV. The analysis proceeds in a similar way to the Rivet
MC TTBAR analysis and results are shown in Fig. 3.20.
We see that there is an effect at the parton level, i.e. without hadronization
but again, hadronization significantly reduces the effect of the inclusion of the new
multi-scale shower.
3.5 Conclusions
In this chapter we have outlined radiation patterns for single gluon emission for top
and stop production processes relevant to both the LHC and a future lepton collider.
We have also shown new results for radiation patterns for double gluon emission for
top production processes relevant to the LHC. We have also seen that the leading
colour approximation that we employ in our Monte Carlo event generators is actually
a good approximation, as the leading colour contribution is often very similar to the
full fixed order calculation. This in practice means that we can have faith that our
existing Monte Carlo event generator is delivering an accurate simulation of aspects
of the radiation and can be used for studies at modern collider experiments. This
3.5. Conclusions 98
does not mean that efforts should not be undertaken to improve the simulation
though, as any increase in accuracy will be beneficial given the highly complex
hadronic final states at the LHC.
The existing single and new double gluon emission radiation patterns have been
interpreted in terms of a Monte Carlo event generator by the means of a new multi-
scale shower where, radiation is suppressed off particles colour connected to heavy
decaying particles by means of a modification to the Sudakov form factor. This
takes the form of a hard shower which runs in the place of the usual shower and a
new soft shower that is run at the end of the hard showering process and effects
only the particles that terminate the top quarks colour lines.
The new shower was implemented in the Monte Carlo event generator Herwig++
and the effects on some observables were shown. With the new multi-scale shower,
the top mass is shown to be clearly altered with hadronization effects switched off,
but upon turning hadronization on in the shower, the effect of the new multi-scale
shower is reduced. The same applies for heavy top quark production in the Little
Higgs model where the effect of the new multi-scale shower on the determination
of the mass of the heavy top quark is negligible when hadronization is turned on.
The small effect that this new aspect of simulation introduces can be thought of
as reassuring that our existing tools are already providing a high quality level of
simulation.
The multi-scale shower may nevertheless still prove important in certain observ-
ables and in the accurate simulation of new Physics beyond the Standard Model,
where heavy, unstable particle production dominates. In further work it would be
enlightening to see how these effects behave in other processes such as single top
quark production, which is used to probe the Electroweak interaction, especially as
this is currently being studied at the LHC.
Chapter 4
Colour Sextet Diquark
Phenomenology
Many models of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics require the inclusion
of diquarks. For example, diquarks appear in a number of Grand Unified Theories
(GUTs) and have even been postulated as a form of dynamical symmetry breaking,
giving rise to the masses of particles, [136, 137]. The colour sextet diquark is, in
group theory language, a rank 2 symmetric tensor formed from the direct product
of two fundamental representations 3  3 = 6  3. As such it is the lowest colour
representation which has not been observed and therefore investigation of sextet
diquark production at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is interesting in its
own right.
The LHC experiments are data taking at the high energy frontier (
s = 8 TeV),
allowing probes of energy scales not previously seen. At the LHC because the funda-
mental collisions are between the quarks and gluons inside the colliding protons the
strong force is the dominant interaction allowing Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
to be studied at these new high energies. As a diquark is produced via strong in-
teractions, and with the potential of a relatively low mass, diquarks may be seen
in the early stages of LHC data taking. The LHC also favours the formation of
diquarks from the valence quarks as it is a proton-proton collider as opposed to a
proton-antiproton collider, such as the Tevatron.
Due to their exotic colour structure and SU(3)C quantum numbers, diquarks will
4.1. Simulation 100
give rise to jets in the detector. The expected signals will be either a resonance in the
invariant dijet mass distribution or the production of two equal mass dijet systems
in four jet events in the case of pair production. In order to study the experimental
signatures of diquark production, a Monte Carlo simulation is required that includes
the production of sextet particles, their perturbative decays and the full Monte Carlo
machinery of showering (including the exotic colour structure) and hadronization.
Although significant efforts have been made to study the resonant production
of diquarks [138145] and also pair production [140,146,147], a full study of exper-
imental signatures including Monte Carlo simulations has not been performed. In
this chapter, we discuss: the implementation of the diquark model in general pur-
pose Monte Carlo event generators; place constraints on the coupling as a function
of mass based on the latest ATLAS results [3, 4]; present some results of invariant
mass distributions both for resonant and pair production.
In the remainder of this chapter a method for simulating the production and
decay of particles in the sextet representation of SU(3)C including the simulation of
QCD radiation is presented. The colour decomposition is shown in detail for both
the hard process and the shower.
Results from the Monte Carlo simulation of sextet diquark production at the
LHC including both resonant and pair production are detailed. Limits on resonant
diquark production from ATLAS results are shown and the first simulation studies
of the less model dependent pair production mechanism is also performed.
4.1 Simulation
4.1.1 Lagrangian
As with all models, the simulation starts with the calculation of the hard production
and decay processes using the most general Lagrangian for the coupling of the sextet
particles to the quarks [139,141,144,148,149]

where qL is the left-handed quark doublet, uR and dR are the right-handed quark
singlet fields, and qc  CqT is the charge conjugate quark field. The colour and
generation indices are omitted to give a more compact notation and the subscripts
on the scalar, , and vector, V , fields denote the SM electroweak gauge quantum
numbers: (SU(2)L, U(1)Y ). The Lagrangian is assumed to be flavour diagonal to
avoid any flavour changing currents arising from the new interactions.
The kinetic and QCD terms in the Lagrangian are
LscalarQCD = DDm2, (4.1.2a)
for scalar diquarks, where  is the scalar diquark field and
LvectorQCD = 
(DV  DV ) (DV DV)m2V V, (4.1.2b)
for vector diquarks, where V  is the vector diquark field. The covariant derivative
D has the standard form for Quantum Chromodynamics.
As discussed in the introduction, the simulation of perturbative QCD radiation,
relies on the large number of colours, NC , limit for both the treatment of perturbative
QCD radiation and the subsequent hadronization. In this approach particles in the
fundamental representation of SU(NC) carry a colour, those in the antifundamental
representation an anticolour and those in the adjoint representation both a colour
and an anticolour.
This is complicated in models involving sextet particles where in the large-
NC limit the sextet particles possess two fundamental colours, appropriately sym-
metrized. This cannot be handled by conventional Monte Carlo simulations which
require all the colours of the particles to have fundamental colours and/or anti-
colours. In order to simulate these particles we choose to represent (anti)sextet
particles as having two (anti)colours.
Consider the production and subsequent decay of a scalar sextet particle. In
order to simulate QCD radiation from the intermediate sextet resonance we have to
simulate the production and decay separately. The matrix element for the process

In order to consider the intermediate sextet particle as having two fundamen-
tal colours we have absorbed the Clebsch-Gordan into the redefined production,
Mabprod, and decay matrix elements,Mbadecay. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and
the associated generators are given in Ref. [138], and we will make use of them to
decompose the colour of the production processes and shower, below.
From this, the colour partners of the decay products can be determined and the
usual angular ordering procedure applied [42, 51]. The radiation pattern of gluons
from the quarks for the resonant production of diquarks,
4.1. Simulation 103

J2 = CF
(W13 +W14 +W23 +W24) (4.1.5)
NC + 1
(W13 +W14 +W23 +W24)W12 W34
The last term in Eqn. 4.1.5 can be neglected, as usual, due to both the 1
suppres-
sion, compared to the leading term, and the dynamical suppression in the massless
limit because there is no collinear singularity in this term. The radiation pattern is
shown in Fig. 4.1. The massless limit was used and so the momenta of the partons
may be written as
p1 = E (1; 0, 0, 1) p3 = E (1; sin , 0, cos )
p2 = E (1; 0, 0,1) p4 = E (1; sin , 0, cos )
k =  (1; cosk sin k, sink sin k, cos k) . (4.1.6)
The outgoing quarks were held at 45 and 225 with respect to the incoming beam
direction. The full radiation pattern, the result after neglecting the subleading terms
and azimuthally averaging, and the improved angular ordered result, where the full
result is used instead of the azimuthal average inside the angular-ordered region, are
shown. Improved angular ordering, as implemented in Herwig++ performs well in
the collinear limit.
4.1.2 Colour Decomposition
As we mentioned in the introduction, owing to the fact that Herwig++, as with all
general purpose Monte Carlo generators, has all the machinery set up to work with
the (anti)fundamental representation of SU(3). Therefore exotic color representa-
tions must be decomposed into a fundamental representation basis. We do this now
below for both the resonant production and pair production of the sextet diquarks.
Resonant Production
The process of diquark production in a resonant way, followed by decay into two
coloured particles is shown in Fig. 4.2.We may decompose the colour of this process

using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients by writing our resonant production matrix
element as
M0 = KiabKcdi A , (4.1.7)
where A is the colour-stripped amplitude. We now make use of the completeness
relation
KiabK

, (4.1.8)
to read off the colour flow in the fundamental representation for the resonant pro-
duction mechanism.
Following this decomposition, there are two unique colour flows associated with
this process as shown in Fig. 4.3. The colour factor associated with these colour
flows is
NC(NC+1)
Pair Production
The main diagrams contributing to the pair production of diquarks are shown in
Fig. 4.4. We do not include the quark initiated process here, as the gluon initiated
process dominates at the LHC. Each of these diagrams is decomposed into a colour

factor and colourless component like for resonant production. By taking the colour
factors for the diagrams, adding and squaring, a table of colour factors can be
produced for each term in the total matrix element squared.
The s,t and u-channel go through in the way as above, making use of the fact
that the generators TA in the diqurk representation may be written as
TAij = 2Tr

, (4.1.9)
where tA is in the fundamental representation, and that the s-channel is decomposed
into a t-channel like colour flow and u-channel like colour flow. The only difficulty
remains in finding the colour flow for the four-point interaction. Using the Feynman
rules for two gauge bosons and two scalar-quarks in Ref. [150], we find that

into the (anti)fundamental representation. We find that the pair production process

assumed that gluons did not branch to form diquarks owing to the large diquark
mass.
4.2 Phenomenology
In order to study the phenomenology simulations were performed for the scalar
1,4/3 and the vector V
2,5/6
diquarks which were chosen as they can be produced
as s-channel resonances from the partonic collision of the valence up quarks. In all
our analyses, jets were clustered using the anti-kT algorithm [151], as implemented
in the FastJet package [106], using a radius parameter of R = 0.6. This choice is
typical for the ATLAS experiment at the LHC [3]. The LO PDFs of Ref. [152],
which are the default choice in Herwig++, were used.
There are phenomenological constraints on the diquark couplings from D0  D0
mixing and non-strange pion decays [142]. For the up-type quarks there are con-
straints that require
guuR . 0.1 and g
R  0. (4.2.14)
The gL couplings have to be constrained due to minimal flavour violation as the
left-handed CKM matrix is well known [138].
It was therefore decided to take the couplings
g11R/L = 0.1 and g
R/L = g
R/L = 0, (4.2.15)

where the numbered indices refer to the generation.
The value of the coupling will affect any studies involving jets as the width of
the particle varies as a function of the couplings. 1 If the coupling is less than the
value chosen above, any peak maybe enhanced compared to what is presented in the
following sections. The width as a function of the diquark mass is shown in Fig. 4.7.
We note that as the width is very small the diquark potentially hadronizes before it
decays.
4.2.1 Resonance Production
Firstly we look at the resonant production of sextet diquarks. If the diquark has
an appropriate mass and coupling it may be resonantly produced at the LHC. The
resonance production and subsequent decay of a general diquark (scalar or vector)
is shown in Fig. 4.2, where the decay of the diquark will depend on its mass and
unknown couplings to the quarks, g.
Fig. 4.8 shows the cross section for the production of scalar and vector diquarks

from incoming uu quarks (resonant production) and for incoming gluons (pair pro-
duction). The resonant production cross section depends quadratically on the un-
known diquark coupling to quarks, which as been assumed to be 0.1 in this plot,
whereas the pair production cross section is independent of this coupling.
The diquark will decay into two quarks giving rise to at least two jets. The
search for the production of a diquark via resonant production should therefore be
in the dijet invariant mass spectrum, where a smeared peak is expected around
the diquark mass. The primary background to this search channel is QCD 2  2
scattering processes.
The signal and background were simulated using Herwig++. The analysis and
modelling of the backgrounds followed that suggested in Ref. [3]. The transverse
momenta and pseudorapidities of the jets were required to be p1T > 150 GeV, p
60 GeV and |1,2| < 2.5 where 1 is the hardest jet and 2 is the subleading jet. In addi-
tion we required that the dijet invariant mass, mjj satisfied
mjj > 300 GeV and the rapidity difference between the leading and subleading jet
was |12| < 1.3. The dijet invariant mass spectrum after these cuts is shown in
4.2. Phenomenology 111
Fig.s 4.9 and 4.10 for
s = 7 and 14 TeV, respectively. The diquarks were simulated
at masses of 500 GeV, 800 GeV, 1200 GeV, 1600 GeV and 2000 GeV.
As simulating the QCD mjj spectrum at high masses is difficult, a functional
f(x) = a0(1 x)x(a1+a2 lnx), (4.2.16)
was fitted to the low masses, where the ai are fitted parameters and x = mjj/
and extrapolated out into the high mass region.
The results of Ref. [3] can be used to impose constraints on the diquark coupling
as a function of the diquark mass. The event selection from Ref. [3] was used to
reproduce the correct acceptance. This requires that the event contains at least two
jets with pT > 150 GeV and a subleading jet with pT > 30 GeV. Both the leading
and subleading pT jets must satisfy |j| < 2.5 with 12 < 1.3 and mjj > 150 GeV.
The signal, after the cuts, was fitted to a Gaussian distribution, with the mean
fixed, m, at the simulated diquark mass to obtain the standard deviation of the
distribution, , so that the results presented in Ref. [3] could be used to obtain the
limits on the diquark coupling.
A standard Gaussian was chosen as it is practically easy to implement and af-
ter experimenting with a skewed Gaussian was found to give comparible results.
The Gaussian was fitted using the usual process of minimising 2 with the Python
implementation of the popular Minuit package [153].
As suggested in [3], long tails were removed by taking a window around the
diquark mass of 20% for the fit. If the /m value obtained was below the range of
that given in the paper, then the number of events associated with the lowest /m for
that mass was used. This allows a conservative estimate for the excluded coupling,
as opposed to one which may be obtained by extrapolation into the unknown region.
The limit on the diquark coupling is shown in Fig. 4.11 where because the statistical
errors were negligible, the bands shown come from varying the scale from 50% to
200% of the default scale choice, i.e. the diquark mass.
Following the work of Ref. [3] the ATLAS collaboration has released an updated
analysis [4], including additional data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
163 pb1. This analysis included slightly harder cuts requiring pT > 180 GeV and

ATLAS performed better than the expected median limit in the Ref. [3] and worse
than the expected median limit in [4] in the 1400  1600 GeV mass range, giving
rise to the overlap in Fig. 4.11.
4.2.2 Pair Production
The pair production of diquarks (scalar and vector) occurs via the Feynman di-
agrams shown in Fig. 4.4 and also via a quark-quark initiated process with an
s-channel gluon. At the LHC we expect the gluon-gluon initial state to be domi-
nant over the quark-quark initial state and so we choose to only study the incoming
gluon case here. The pair production process has one main advantage over the res-
onant production, it does not depend on the unknown diquark coupling. Instead,
the pair production cross section depends only on the SU(3)C representation, mass
and spin of the particle. The pair production process therefore has the potential to
distinguish between whether a particle in the antitriplet or sextet representation was
4.2. Phenomenology 114
produced due to the dependency of the cross section on the colour representation.
To date there have been no studies of the experimental signals of diquark pair
production. The cross section has been calculated [140, 146, 147] and some work
towards a jet study, no Monte Carlo study has been performed.
The pair production and subsequent decay of diquarks is expected to give four
jets, with two pairs of jets forming systems with the mass of the diquark. The
backgrounds to the pair production of diquarks are:
 vector boson WW , ZZ and ZW pair production;
 vector boson, W and Z, production in association with additional jets;
 top quark pair, tt, production;
 QCD jet production.
The analysis proceeded by placing cuts on the four hardest jets: p1T > 150 GeV,
p2T > 100 GeV, p
T > 60 GeV and p
T > 30 GeV, where the four jets i = 1, 4 are
ordered in pT such that the first jet is the hardest. All four jets were required to
have pseudorapidity |i| < 3. Two pairs of jets were then formed with the pairing
selected that minimized the mass difference between the two pairs of jets. If, after
pairing, the two hardest jets are in the same pair of jets, the event was vetoed. The
mass difference between the pairs was required to be less than 20 GeV.
The signal and backgrounds were simulated for the production of the 1,1/3 and
2,5/6
diquarks giving the results shown in Fig.s 4.12 and 4.13 for
s = 7 and 14 TeV, respectively. As the backgrounds are dominated by QCD scat-
tering, i.e. the contribution of the QCD scattering processes is approximately one
hundred times that of all the other backgrounds combined, only the sum of the back-
grounds is shown. As for the resonant production, the plots show the production of
diquarks with masses of 500 GeV, 800 GeV and 1200 GeV, 1600 GeV and 2000 GeV.
The low mass QCD background was fitted with Eqn. 4.2.16 and extended out into
the high mass region.
A window of 50 GeV was taken around the diquark mass and the S
was cal-
culated for a number of luminosities the results of which are shown in Fig. 4.14. We

s = 14 TeV brings. A vector diquark in the mass range
presented here (< 2000 GeV) should be seen with L = 10 fb1, whereas even with
L = 100 fb1 only a low mass (. 1050 GeV) scalar diquark has potential for discov-
4.3 Conclusions
In this chapter we have presented a method for simulating the production and
decay of particles in the sextet colour representation which has been implemented
in Herwig++.
We simulated the production and decay of vector and scalar sextet diquarks at
energies relevant to the LHC. Based on the findings and the latest ATLAS search for
4.3. Conclusions 117
new particles in two-jet final states, new constraints have been put on the couplings
of the diquarks to SM particles. Unfortunately we see from the large backgrounds
that discovery in the dijet channel will be very difficult at the LHC.
We have also presented studies of the gluon-gluon initiated pair production mech-
anism, which is independent of the unknown coupling of the sextet diquark to quarks.
The quark-quark initiated pair production mechanism has not been studied, as at
low masses we expect the gluon-gluon initiated pair production process to dominate.
This process has a promising search reach with the possibility of observing vector
diquarks with masses less than 710 GeV at
s = 7 TeV and both vector, for masses
less than 2 TeV, and scalar, for masses less than 1 TeV, with the LHC running at
design energy.
We have seen that the potential to discover the diquark is also very limited
at the LHC in the pair production mechanism owing to its small rate and again
large backgrounds. However, It could still be possible to observe the diquark via its
coupling to top quarks and in the future it may be prudent to conduct an analysis
focusing on the process where the pair produced diquarks decays to two top quarks.
Using the decay of a diquark to two top quarks allows us to distinguish the
diquark from other SUSY particles as we can fully reconstruct the final state by
the four jets produced, compared to most SUSY processes where an experimentally
invisible particle e.g. neutralino is involved in the process. A fully reconstructed
state also allows us to measure the spin properties of the particle produced and
distinguish whether a scalar or vector diquark was produced.
Furthermore, other improved analyses may be able to uncover a signature of a
diquark in these large backgrounds. The tool provided here can now be used by
other interested parties in this area to perform such analyses and also be used with
a full detector simulator by experimentalists searching for diquarks.
Further Monte Carlo studies of diquark production in this area in the future
could prove to be beneficial in the search for new Physics.

Conclusions
In this thesis we have examined the principles behind a Monte Carlo event generator
and outlined the Physics and its implementation in the Herwig++ Monte Carlo
event generator.
The improvement of the accuracy of simulation has been stressed throughout
and examples of two improvements with a subsequent study of the phenomenology
has been shown for the highly relevant boosted Higgs boson studies, to examine
the Higgs boson decaying to two bottom quarks at the LHC. Although currently
not used as a discovery channel, the verification of existing results and extension of
the accuracy of simulation will prove fruitful if we are to use this method to study
the decay of a light Higgs boson at the LHC. This is especially relevant with the
discovery of new boson of mass 125 GeV. Studying this new boson to see if it has the
expected couplings to bottom quarks will be important so we can ascertain whether
this is the Standard Model Higgs boson we are expecting.
With regards to the technique itself, we have found that the use of jet substruc-
ture has promise to study the Higgs boson in this challenging decay mode, and
warrants further study at the LHC. The series of error tunes provided will also en-
able experimentalists and theorists alike to produce a more robust error associated
with the tuning of a Monte Carlo event generator, whilst obviously still taking into
consideration statistical errors.
As mentioned, one area of further study in this region should focus around un-
derstanding to g  b b splitting as implemented in a Monte Carlo even generator.
Chapter 5. Conclusions 119
Accurately simulating this splitting is important for the backgrounds to jet sub-
structure techniques that rely on the decay of heavy objects to bottom quarks.
Also, such studies are sensitive to the underlying event and more detailed studies
on how underlying event effects jet substructure would be of use.
Following on from the jet substructure investigation, we also outlined the sys-
tematic improvement of simulation of top quark radiation, owing to its width. We
have shown that the leading colour approximation employed by a Monte Carlo event
generator is actually a good approximation and that current event generators can
be thought to be giving an accurate simulation of the radiation. A new algorithm
as implemented in the Monte Carlo event generator Herwig++ is shown based on
calculated radiation patterns up to the emission of two gluons and a study of the
phenomenology outlined.
Although the effect seen on the top quark mass analyses presented was small,
other observables may be more sensitive to these effects and so including them in
our simulation could become important, especially for SUSY style processes where
there is more than one heavy particle in a decay cascade. Single top production
as being investigated at the LHC as a probe of the Electroweak sector may also be
sensitive to these effects and so further study in this area in the future would be
relevant.
We have also discussed the simulation of new Physics and that without an accu-
rate simulation the goal of finding such new Physics at a modern collider experiment
such as the LHC would be very challenging. The Sextet diquark model was outlined
along with its implementation in the Monte Carlo event generator Herwig++ and
again, an associated phenomenological study. Limits were placed on the diquark
coupling and the potential of discovery of such an object discussed.
The dijet channel, and also pair production channel, all have large backgrounds
and so potential for discovery of a diquark is limited at the LHC. An investigation
of the diquark coupling to top quarks could lead to a potential discovery though.
If the diquark decays to two top quarks then there is a chance to create a fully
reconstructed final state. This is beneficial compared to the decays of many SUSY
particles which have an experimentally invisible object in their final state e.g.
Chapter 5. Conclusions 120
neutralino. The fully reconstructed final state could allow us also to measure the
spin properties of any produced diquark and determine whether a scalar or vector
diquark has been produced.
Clearly as the modern collider experiments increase in energy and their final
states become more complex, improving all aspects of simulation will remain an
important task in the future. We have shown that we can have a good degree
of confidence in our existing tools, however, improving the accuracy of simulation
should still continue. This thesis has been written at exciting time in Particle Physics
and hopefully many more discoveries are still to come. The work undertaken here has
contributed towards the current round of experiments and their work in unlocking
the secrets of Nature.
Appendix A
Monte Carlo Integration
Often we wish to evaluate complex integrals numerically, as they cannot be done
analytically. There are a number of ways to achieve this. The simplest example is
the Newton-Cotes method. Assuming we want to evaluate the integral
Iab =
f (x) (A.0.1)
we approximate the integral by splitting our region up into rectangular segments
and summing over them
Iab 
f (xi) x (A.0.2)
where x =
(ba)
and xi = a+ ix. We define the error by
f (x)
f (xi) x , (A.0.3)
where the error in this method goes like 1
. We can go better, by instead of approx-
imating the area under our function f (x) as a series of trapezoids
Iab 
(f (xi+1) + f (xi))
(A.0.4)
where now the error goes like 1
[154]. Or we can even go one better and use
an interpolated parabola, called Simpsons rule, where the error goes like 1
[154].
Another alternative way relieves on the mean value theorem of calculus
Iab = (b a) f (c) (A.0.5)
Appendix A. Monte Carlo Integration 122
where f (c) is the mean value of the function over the region. Using this method we
can define a Monte Carlo integration by sampling the function f (x) in the region
[a, b] i.e.
Iab =
f (x) = (b a) f (c)  (b a) 1
f (xi) . (A.0.6)
The law of large numbers states that the approximation becomes exact in the asymp-
totic limit, and so
E [f (x)] = lim
f (xi)
f (xi) . (A.0.7)
An appreciation of the error is developed by computing
f (xi) E [f (x)]
Var [f (x)]
([n1
i=0 f (xi) nE [f (x)]
Var [f (x)]
  = [f (x)]
N (0, 1) (A.0.8)
where N (0, 1) is a normally distributed random number of mean 0 and standard
deviation 1, 2 [X] = Var (X) is the variance of X and the second to third line
holds from the Central Limit Theorem. So we see this way of evaluating the integral
converges like 1/
n. Whilst this is slower in low numbers of dimensions when
compared to the other rules above, the real key is that the rate of convergence
is always 1/
n, no matter what the dimension, where as for the trapezoid rule,
the error goes like O
n2/d
or for Simpsons rule O
n4/d
[154] with the error
bound becoming less useful as the dimension increases. To reduce our error with a
Monte Carlo integral then, all we need do is generate more points and our error is
guaranteed to decrease like 1/
In fact, more tricks can be applied to the integration to reduce the variance. If
we decide to sample the integration region in areas where f (x) is larger, compared
to when it is smaller, we can lower the variance. Mathematically speaking we write
f (x) dx =
f (x)
g (x)
g (x) dx = Eg
f (x)
g (x)
, (A.0.9)
Appendix A. Monte Carlo Integration 123
which we achieve by sampling the points in our distribution according to g (x) and
then evaluating
. If we are clever, and choose g (x) such that it smoothly follows
f (x), then we can reduce the variance and associated error of our integral. These
techniques become more important than just generating more points to decrease
The question then remains as to how to generate our points according to g (x).
If we are lucky and we can invert our integrated function G (x), and assuming g (x)
is defined and wanted for x  [,+], then from cumulative probability function
G (x) =
g (y) dy = R , (A.0.10)
with the random number R  Unif[0, 1] then clearly
x = G1 (R) . (A.0.11)
This is practically never the case, however, and we must use a different method
for generating according to a distribution. One such method is John von Neumanns1
hit or miss method. We build a simple, invertable over-estimator h(x) of our function
g (x) across the region of interest such that
h (x)  max[g (x)] . (A.0.12)
We then generate points according to h (x) and accept the point according to the
probability
, by comparing to another random number, which then distributes
points correctly and according to g (x). This can be seen as the first point is picked
according to h(x)dx and then retained according to
and when these two are
multiplied together, we recover the original distribution we wanted, g(x).
If the function in questions varies a lot between intervals, we can sub-divide the
function into the required intervals by defining g(x) =
i gi(x) and applying these
methods to each of the regions i. This is called stratified sampling.
An example of importance sampling method can be seen with the integral of
f (x) = sin
, using g (x) = 2x x2, where x was sampled according to g (x) by
1John von Neumann is considered by many to be the father of Monte Carlo techniques, which
were pioneered during the efforts at the Los Alamos laboratory and development of the nuclear
bomb during the World War II Manhatten Project.

comparison between the standard uniform and the importance sampling method.
The hit or miss method can actually be used to directly integrate functions too.
If, as above, we define an over-estimator of our function of interest and throw points
down in the area bounded by this function and, in two dimensions, the x-axis then
the integral of our function is given by
f (x)  Nhit

where by Nhit is the number of points inside f (x) and Nmiss is between the function

Jets and Jet Algorithms
Figure B.1: The simulated production of microscopic black hole in the ATLAS
detector at the LHC. Image courtesy of the CERN press office, with whom copyright
remains.
Free quarks or gluons dont exist in Nature - after being produced they themselves
produce a collimated spray of hadrons, known as a jet. Jets are clearly seen in events
for example in Fig. B.1, but to define mathematically what a jet is in such a way that
both experiment and theory can use the same definition turns out to be non-trivial.
An excellent review of jet physics can be found in Ref. [5], of which we summarise
some of the more important findings here.
The Snowmass accord laid out the requirements for a jet algorithm and these
Appendix B. Jets and Jet Algorithms 126
are given as [5, 155,156]:
1. Simple to implement in an experimental analysis;
2. Simple to implement in theoretical calculations;
3. Defined at any order of perturbation theory;
4. Yields finite cross sections at any order of perturbation theory;
5. Yields a cross section that is relatively insensitive to hadronization.
In general jet algorithms fall broadly into two categories - cone algorithms and
sequential recombination algorithms. We will not look at cone algorithms here, as
none have been used in this thesis and some older cone algorithms are plagued by a
lack of IR safety.
A jet algorithm has to be both IR and collinear safe, and by this we mean that
the addition of an extra soft or collinear parton should not change the set of hard
jets that are found in the event [5]. This has to be the case if we are to satisfy the
KLN theorem. For example, if the addition of an extra soft gluon gets combined into
a different jet than the parton that produced it, then the IR cancellation between
virtual and real corrections would not be complete in either jet, with implications
for perturbative calculations. A diagram exposing this is shown in Fig. B.2.
One cone algorithm, SISCone [157], has surpassed this problem and is now both
IR and collinear safe, however, the current round of experiments at the LHC are
focused on sequential recombination type algorithms and it is these that we turn
our attention to now.
Sequential Recombination Algorithms
Sequential recombination algorithms came out of e+e experiments, with the Jade
algorithm being the first [158,159]. The Jade algorithm satisfies the requirements of
being both I.R. and collinear safe, as soft particles get recombined at the beginning
of the clustering. The Jade algorithm proceeds by:
Appendix B. Jets and Jet Algorithms 127
Figure B.2: An example of the cancellation of divergencies in jets, taken from
Ref. [5].
1. For each pair of particles i, j calculate a distance
yij =
2EiEj (1 cos ij)
(B.0.1)
where Q is the total energy in an event. Ei is the energy of the i
th particle
and ij is the angle between particles i, j;
2. Find ymin of all the yijs;
3. If yij < ycut recomine i, j into a single particle and repeat;
4. Otherwise declare all remaining particles to be jets and exit.
Experimentally, we measure energy deposits in a calorimeter within the detector
and so a particle here can be thought of as an energy deposit in an experimental
detector. The Jade algorithm does have a subtlety in that two very soft parti-
cles moving backwards can be recombined into a single particle at the start of the
algorithm. This is counterintuitive to jets having a constrained angular size [5].
The originally defined kt algorithm is exactly the same as the Jade algorithm,
except one now defines
yij =
2 min (Ei, Ej) (1 cos ij)
(B.0.2)
Appendix B. Jets and Jet Algorithms 128
as the jet measure. This has the added advantage of using the minimum energy
between the two particles i, j, so that the measure between two soft back-to-back
particles is greater than that between a soft particle and a hard particle close in
angle.
For hadron colliders, where the total energy in a collision may not be well defined,
we may use the inclusive kt algorithm. The inclusive kt algorithm does away with
the parameter dcut, and introduces a new parameter R. Now, compared to the
orignal kt algorithm, one instead defines
dij = min
p2T,i, p
) R2ij
, (B.0.3)
where R2ij = (yi  yj)
+ (i  j)2, there is the introduction of a beam distance
diB = p
T,i , (B.0.4)
which defines how far a particle is from an incoming beam and we introduce a new
parameter R. The algorithm proceeds by [160]
1. For each pair of particles i, j calculate a dij and diB;
2. Find the minimum of all the calculated dij and diB;
3. If it is a dij recombine i, j into a single particle and repeat;
4. If it is a diB then declare i to be a jet, remove it from the set of particles and
return to 1;
5. Stop when there are no particles left, and one just has jets.
For hadron-hadron collisions, we define there to be two beam particles [161]. The
advantage of these variables is that they are invariant under longitudinal boosts.
Experimentalists, however, do not like this definition as it gives jagged edges
to the jets and was arguably computationally slow to calculate [5]. The anti-kt
algorithm gets around the jagged edge problem, by now defining [151]
dij = min
p2T,i
p2T,j
R2ij
, (B.0.5)
Appendix B. Jets and Jet Algorithms 129
diB =
p2T,i
, (B.0.6)
so that now the the hardest particles are favoured, compared to the softest in the kt
algorithm. The jets grow outwards from the hardest particles and produce shapes
that are approximately circular.
There is yet another type of sequential recombination algorithm called the
Cambridge-Aachen algorithm, or C/A for short, which is used in the jet substruc-
ture analysis of this thesis [104, 105]. This is like the kt algorithm, but without the
kt and proceeds by recombing all jets until dij = Rij > R. This can be thought of
angular ordering in reverse.
Typically at ATLAS at the LHC, an anti-kt algorithm is used with an R pa-
rameter of R = 0.6. Thankfully a package, FastJet [106], has been written that
allows interface to a library of jet algorithms for use in Monte Carlo simulations.
FastJet also has the advantage of being quick - achieving O(N lnN) timing for the
sequential recombination algorithms compared to the original implementations that
took either O(N3) or O(N2). The FastJet package is readily available for download
and easy to link to.

Figure C.1: The triple gluon vertex.
We show the labelling of indices and momenta for the triple gluon vertex in

We then expand this, and use the subscripts 1 =

(k2) and
dropping the unnecessary prefactors, so that
Mn+1  [(k1  k2) (1  2) + ((k1 + 2k2)  1)

 ((k1 + 2k2)  1) (2  n) (k1 + k2) + ((2k1 + k2)  2) (1  n) (k1 + k2)
(C.0.2)
and choosing to work in a physical gauge, such that i  ki = 0 and i  n = 0, this
becomes

which can be used to derive radiation patterns for soft gluon emission when there is

Appendix D
Veto Algorithm
We detail here the formalism laid out in Ref. [49] and outline the veto algorithm. If
we start with a process involving particles beginning at time t = 0 and continuing
to time t, e.g. radioactive decay, then the probability of particle decay at a certain
time will be proportional to the probability that something will happen at a time
t, f(t), and the probability that nothing has happened by a time t, N (t), as clearly
a particle cannot decay if it already has. We can therefore write the differential
probability that something has happen at a time t as
P(t) = dN
= f(t)N (t) , (D.0.1)
which is easily solved to give
P(t) = f(t) exp
f(t)dt
. (D.0.2)
As discussed in terms of the Sudakov form factor in the introduction, the exponential
can be thought of as the probability that nothing happens between the times (0, t).
In Appendix A, we see that this can be inverted if f(t) has a primitive inverse to
give the correct distribution of t t
P(t)dt = N (0)N (t) = 1 exp
f(t)dt
= 1R , (D.0.3)
where R  Unif[0, 1], so that
t = F1 (F (0) lnR) , (D.0.4)
with F (t) being the integral of f(t)dt. If f(t) does not have an analytic integral
Appendix D. Veto Algorithm 133
Figure D.1: The region of integration in the veto algorithm.
we need to use a hit or miss like method that takes care of the exponent properly
and this is the so called veto algorithm.
Again, we start with an overestimate integral h(t) and now select ti according to
h(t), but as we have a process ordered in time t, we impose an additional constraint
on our values that for a generated point i, we must have ti > ti1. We then accept
the new time ti according to the probability
f(ti)
h(ti)
We can see how this works firstly if we reject no intermediate points, and the
first try t = t1 works, as then the probability of accepting the first point is given by
P0(t) = exp
h(t)dt
= f(t) exp
h(t)dt
. (D.0.5)
Now, if we reject the first point t1 and go on to accept a second t2, the probability
associated with this is given by
P1(t) =
dt1 exp
h(t)dt
h(t1)
1 f(t1)
h(t1)
h(t)dt
(D.0.6)
where we note we must integrate over all possible intermediate time periods. We
can write this in terms of P0(t) as
P1(t) = P0(t)
dt1 [h(t1) f(t1)] . (D.0.7)
Continuing in the same way for more than one intermediate time being rejected,
Appendix D. Veto Algorithm 134
we find that
P1(t) =P0(t)
dt1 [h(t1) f(t1)]
dt2 [h(t2) f(t2)]
=P0(t)
dt [h(t) f(t)]
, (D.0.8)
where to see the last equality, one can re-order the integration variables of t1 and t2
and then from Fig. D.1 the equality is seen.
In general if there are i intermediate times, these can be ordered in i ways, and
so we have that
P(t) =
Pi(t) =P0(t)
dt [h(t) f(t)]
=f(t) exp
h(t)dt
[h(t) f(t)] dt
= exp
f(t)dt
. (D.0.9)
