Abstract
This thesis describes the design a novel type of particle accelerator for charged
particle therapy. The accelerator is called a non-scaling, Fixed Field Alternating
Gradient (ns-FFAG) accelerator, and will accelerate both protons and carbon ions to
energies required for clinical use. The work is undertaken as part of the PAMELA
project.
An existing design for a ns-FFAG is taken as a starting point and analysed in terms
of its ability to suit the charged particle therapy application. It is found that this
design is particularly sensitive to alignment errors and would be unable to accelerate
protons and carbon ions at the proposed acceleration rate due to betatron resonance
crossing phenomena.
To overcome this issue, a new type of non-linear ns-FFAG is developed which
avoids resonance crossing and meets the requirements provided by clinical consid-
erations. Two accelerating rings are required, one for protons up to 250 MeV and
fully stripped carbon ions to 68 MeV/u, the other to accelerate the carbon ions up to
400-430 MeV/u. Detailed studies are undertaken to show that this new type of accel-
erator is suitable for the application. An alignment accuracy of 50m will not have
a detrimental effect on the beam and the dynamic aperture for most lattice configu-
rations is found to be greater than 50mm mrad normalised in both the horizontal
and vertical plane.
Verification of the simulation code used in the PAMELA lattice design is carried
out using experimental results from EMMA, the worlds first ns-FFAG for 10-20 MeV
electrons built at Daresbury Laboratory, UK.
Finally, it is shown that the described lattice can translate into realistic designs for
the individual components of the accelerator. The integration of these components
into the PAMELA facility is discussed.
This thesis is dedicated to Bill, whose life was tragically cut short by
cancer in 2010.

Introduction
This thesis describes the development of a novel type of particle accelerator, called
a non-scaling Fixed Field Alternating Gradient accelerator (ns-FFAG) and its appli-
cation to Charged Particle Therapy (CPT), as part of the PAMELA (Particle Ac-
celerator for MEdicaL Applications) project [1, 2, 3]. The most substantial original
contributions to knowledge outlined in this thesis are the understanding of the effects
of alignment errors in ns-FFAG lattices in Chapter 2 and the subsequent development
and optimisation of a novel ns-FFAG lattice design in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4.
The introductory chapter will give a historical overview of radiation therapy and
the development of CPT including clinical requirements of relevance for accelerators.
The underlying physics of the treatment of patients with charged particles is reviewed
and complemented by an introduction to relevant radio-biological concepts.
Chapter 2 focuses on the design of a particle accelerator for CPT. The most com-
monly used accelerators for CPT are synchrotrons and cyclotrons, the advantages and
disadvantages of which are discussed. Recent developments in accelerator technology
have produced another option for CPT, combining a magnetic field which does not
vary with time, as in a cyclotron, with the strong alternating gradient focusing em-
ployed in a synchrotron; this is the ns-FFAG. An existing ns-FFAG design for CPT
1.1. Motivation for charged particle therapy
is described and its sensitivity to alignment errors studied.
Results from this work prompted the development of a novel type of ns-FFAG
lattice, which is covered in Chapter 3. The lattice dynamics and error sensitivities
show a substantial improvement compared with the original linear ns-FFAG. This
new lattice design is developed for the PAMELA project for a proton and low-energy
carbon ring which would be appropriate for full energy proton CPT and biological
studies using low-energy fully-stripped carbon ions. Extending this work the lattice
design is scaled up to a full treatment-energy carbon ring in Chapter 4 and optimised
for this scenario.
PAMELA is one of three work packages of the CONFORM (COnstruction of a
Non-scaling FFAG for Oncology, Research and Medicine) project carried out by the
British Accelerator Science and Radiation Oncology Consortium (BASROC). The
CONFORM project also encompasses the construction of the worlds first ns-FFAG,
EMMA (Electron Model for Many Applications), at Daresbury Laboratory, UK. Com-
missioning of EMMA is ongoing and initial results from EMMA were used in the
verification of the ZGOUBI simulation code, outlined in Chapter 5.
Chapter 6 concerns the integration of the PAMELA lattice design with the rest
of the CPT facility from the ion source through to the rotating treatment gantry.
Proposed engineering solutions for components are discussed.
1.1 Motivation for charged particle therapy
There are over 17,400 particle accelerators in the world, around half of which are used
for medical applications. While the majority of medical accelerators are used to pro-
duce X-rays for radiotherapy or for radioisotope production, an increasing number are
used to accelerate beams of protons and ions for the treatment of cancer using particle
beams. The use of charged particle beams in cancer treatment has evolved during the
1.1. Motivation for charged particle therapy
last two decades into an effective, well-established treatment method, particularly in
the case of protons. However, in early treatments the particle accelerators were not
designed specifically for this purpose. In many cases these were existing machines in
physics laboratories, adapted for the purpose of treating patients. Naturally, from the
perspective of both clinician and patient, it is preferable for this kind of treatment to
take place in a hospital, rather than a laboratory. This has led to a heightened need
for accelerators tailored to CPT in a hospital environment.
The worldwide total of accelerators and their applications was reviewed in 2003
by W. Maciszewski and W. Scharf [4, 5] as shown in Table 1.1. Of the accelerators
for medical applications, small linear electron accelerators to produce photons for
radiotherapy are by far the predominant type. These machines have been almost
constantly improved since the first X-ray treatments 100 years ago, driven by devel-
opments in accelerator science which allowed for smaller, more accurate and cheaper
linear accelerators for X-ray radiotherapy [6]. It is clear that progress in the design
of particle accelerators can have a significant impact in delivering new developments
in medicine.

X-ray radiotherapy is central to the cancer treatment strategies of most developed
nations [8]. However, a single beam of X-rays has the fundamental disadvantage of
depositing more dose in the surrounding healthy tissue than in the cancerous target
1.2. Radiotherapy
volume. While this problem has been partially overcome by the use of sophisticated
delivery techniques, further improvements would be obtained by using a beam which
has a better ratio between between dose deposited in cancerous tissue and unwanted
dose deposited in normal, healthy cells.
This improvement can be achieved using charged particles such as protons and
light ions instead of X-rays and is referred to here as Charged Particle Therapy
(CPT)1. As in the case of X-ray radiotherapy, this type of treatment requires a so-
phisticated particle accelerator. However, due to the nature of the particles and
energies required, the accelerators for CPT are necessarily larger and more complex
than those for X-ray radiotherapy.
Despite this, presently there are 33 operational facilities for CPT, including one
low energy cyclotron-based facility in the UK at the Clatterbridge Centre for On-
cology [9], used only for the treatment of ocular tumours. It is clear that further
developments in accelerator science for CPT will necessarily improve the availability
and cost effectiveness of this treatment modality.
1.2 Radiotherapy
1.2.1 Overview
In the UK more than one in three people will develop some form of cancer in their
lifetime and one in four deaths is caused by cancer. These statistics are representative
of cancer incidence and mortality rates in most developed countries. Thankfully, being
diagnosed with cancer is no longer necessarily fatal. With current treatment methods
the five year survival rate of people diagnosed with cancer is approximately 50%
and the ten year survival rate has improved by a factor of two since the 1970s, to
1It should be noted that CPT is commonly referred to as hadron therapy in Germany, Switzer-
land, Italy and France.
1.2. Radiotherapy
46.2% [10].
No single definitive treatment for cancer exists. Modern medicine employs many
methods of treatment including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone ther-
apy, immunotherapy, gene therapy and other specialized treatments. A patients
treatment plan is selected by doctors, usually employing multiple treatment meth-
ods to achieve a greater effect. Of these methods, radiotherapy is one of the most
commonly used. It is estimated that around 50% of all patients who are diagnosed
with cancer in the world would currently benefit at some stage of their illness from
radiotherapy [8].
The use of ionising radiation in the treatment of cancer is not new, having a long
history starting almost immediately upon the discovery of X-rays by W. Roentgen in
1895 [11]. While many advancements have been made in delivery methods over the
last 100 years, all radiotherapy using X-rays is limited by the fundamental nature of
the interaction of radiation with matter.
Figure 1.1: Depth-dose profile of a 20 MV X-ray radiotherapy beam.
In the case of X-rays in the MV range, that is X-rays produced by electrons with
energies of more than an MeV, the interaction in tissue is dominated by Compton
1.2. Radiotherapy
scattering on loosely bound electrons [12]. The Compton effect is the most common
clinical scenario, with most X-ray radiotherapy treatments being performed with
beams between 6 and 20 MV. Higher energy X-rays over about 25 MV result in pair
production, from which the positron ionises until it further annihilates with a free
electron resulting in two lower-energy photons.
These physical effects lead to most of the energy being deposited close to the
surface and an exponential attenuation thereafter, giving the depth-dose profile shown
in Fig. 1.1. The main features of this distribution include a significantly larger dose
on the proximal (near) side of the target volume than in the target volume itself and
a considerable dose on the distal (far) side of the target volume.
1.2.2 Advances in radiotherapy
Developments in radiotherapy in the last 100 years have come from two main ar-
eas. First, an increase in computational power has led to 3D dose planning, better
predictions of biological response, 3D imaging for tumour localisation and therapy
monitoring. The second area involves developments in the technology used for radio-
therapy, including advanced linear accelerator technology, multi-leaf collimators for
automatic beam shaping and robotic patient tables for absolute positional control.
State-of-the-art treatments employ techniques known as Conformal Radiother-
apy (CRT) and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) which are based
on these developments [13]. CRT aims to tailor the region of high-dose to that of the
target volume in the patient, while maintaining a relatively low dose in surrounding
healthy tissue. The shape of the beam of radiation is determined by using a multi-
leaf collimator in addition to employing multiple beams. This allows the shape of the
radiation beam to match the profile of the tumour volume from the specific angle of
irradiation, resulting in a reduction of radiation to the surrounding normal tissues.
Going one step further, IMRT involves modulation of the beam intensity in order to
1.3. Charged particle therapy
conform the dose more precisely to the target tumour volume.
The use of CRT and IMRT with advanced treatment planning utilising multiple
beams has refined the use of radiotherapy to deliver the best possible treatment with
this type of radiation. Further significant improvements may only be achievable with
the use of a different type of radiation: in particular the use of charged particles.
1.3 Charged particle therapy
1.3.1 History
It was not until the development of particle accelerators which could produce protons
of the order 150 to 400 MeV that the first proposal of the application of charged par-
ticles to the treatment of cancer was made. This occurred in 1946 when R. R. Wilson
published the first proposal of CPT in the medical journal Radiology, commenting
that with this new technology for higher energy protons it must have occurred to
many people that the particles themselves now become of considerable therapeutic
interest[14].
Prior to this, in 1904, Bragg and Kleeman had discovered that, unlike X-rays,
protons and other light charged ions deposit most of their energy at the very end of
their range, exhibiting a so-called Bragg peak. It was this property of the interaction
of protons and ions with tissue which R. R. Wilson was keen to exploit, as he saw the
potential to increase damage to cancerous tissue, while reducing damage to healthy
tissue.
A typical depth-dose distribution of protons in tissue (adapted from [15]) is shown
in Fig. 1.2. The main features of the distribution include a relatively small dose as
the beam enters the tissue in the so-called plateau region, a large dose deposition
at a precise depth (the Bragg peak) determined by the incoming beam energy and
little or no dose in the region beyond the Bragg peak. These features are common
1.3. Charged particle therapy
to all charged particle beams including protons (p+), helium (He2+), carbon (C6+)
and neon (Ne10+), but excluding electrons (e) which interact in a similar manner
to photons due to their high charge to mass ratio. Throughout this thesis charged
particle beams should be taken to mean fully stripped ions unless otherwise stated.

with proton CPT. The depth at which the Bragg peak occurs is dependent on the
energy of the incoming proton beam.
1.3.2 Physics of charged particle therapy
The Bragg peak is caused by the relationship between the charged particles energy
loss and the square of its velocity. Most of the particles energy is lost in collisions with
atomic orbital electrons in the tissue, however, due to the heavy mass of the particle,
its path remains straight as small interactions cause it to slow down and eventually
stop. This process is described in the relativistic regime by the Bethe-Bloch formula
in Eqn. 1.1.

(1.1)
1.3. Charged particle therapy
where  = v/c, x is the distance travelled by the particle, n is the electron density
of the target, I is the mean excitation potential of the target and all other symbols
have their usual meanings. The electron density of the material can be found using
Eqn. 1.2, where  is the density of the material, Z, A are the atomic number and
mass number of the material and NA is the Avogadro number.
NA  Z  
(1.2)
In practice this means that a proton beam of 250 MeV will penetrate tissue to a
depth of around 34 cm.
1.3.3 Terminology of radiobiological performance measures
The efficacy of CPT as a treatment modality relies on not only the physical interaction
of charged particles in tissue, but also the biological response of cells to this type of
radiation. The radiobiological performance measures relevant to CPT are outlined
here. For clarity, these concepts are directly compared with the equivalent concept
in physics.
Dose in gray (Gy) and gray equivalent (GyE)
The gray is an SI unit which describes the absorbed radiation dose in matter due to
ionising radiation such as X-rays. It corresponds to the absorption of one joule of
energy by one kilogram of matter.
1 Gy =
= 1 m2  s2 (1.3)
The dose in gray represents only the absorbed dose and does not give an accurate
representation of the equivalent dose in biological tissue when radiation other than
1.3. Charged particle therapy
X-rays is used. This equivalent dose is instead measured2 in gray equivalent (GyE)
as in Eqn. 1.4, where RBE is the Relative Biological Effectiveness.
1GyE = RBE  1Gy (1.4)
Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE)
The biological effects of charged particle therapy differ substantially from those of
X-ray radiotherapy. Charged particles directly damage the DNA of cancer cells,
which are more vulnerable than normal cells to DNA damage. This leads to the
fraction of cells surviving a given dose of X-irradiation being higher than for the
same dose of charged particles [16]. This difference is characterised by the Relative
Biological Effectiveness or RBE. The RBE is specific to the beam used and is a key
indicator of the performance of a radiological treatment method.
Due to the large amount of clinical experience with X-rays, the gray equivalent
(GyE) is used in CPT treatment plans to describe the prescribed dose delivered to
the patient. In the case of X-ray radiotherapy, an RBE of 1.0 is given as a standard
against which to measure other treatment modalities. The RBE of charged particles
such as protons, helium ions, carbon ions and others is always 1.0. Generally, a
value of 1.1 is used for the RBE of protons. For carbon ions the RBE is more difficult
to determine, but in practice a value of 3 is usually adopted [17]. This higher RBE for
carbon leads to an increased probability of tumour control in addition to the benefit
of a conformal dose distribution.
Linear energy transfer (LET)
The energy loss of charged particles in matter is governed by the Bethe formula of
Eqn. 1.1. This is a measure of the energy loss of the incident particle rather than
2The sievert (Sv) is the same as GyE.
1.3. Charged particle therapy
the energy gained by the absorbing medium. The Linear Energy Transfer (LET)
in radiobiology refers to the energy gained by the absorbing medium per unit track
length of the incident charged particle [16].
In radiobiology, particle species generally fall into one of two categories: high-
LET and low-LET radiation. Low-LET includes photons and light charged particles
including both electrons and protons. High-LET is generally considered to include
fully stripped helium (He2+), carbon (C6+), oxygen (O8+), neon (Ne10+) and other
ions of greater atomic number.
The biological mechanisms of cell damage for high and low-LET radiation will
not be discussed here. However, in practice the principal difference between the two
types of LET radiation is the cell survival as a function of dose. As shown in Fig. 1.3
(data from Ref. [18]), the surviving fraction of cells for low-LET radiation is higher
than for the equivalent dose of high-LET radiation.
The LET is not a constant for a particular particle, and increases as the velocity
of the particle decreases towards the end of its range. The region of maximum energy
transfer is the Bragg peak. As the LET increases, the RBE also changes. The region
in which the RBE is increased is specific to each type of particle, as shown in Fig. 1.4
(see Refs. [19, 20] for original data).
The clinical implementation of CPT relies on accurate experimental data tables
of RBE, LET and Bragg peak depths in order to develop precise treatment plans for
each patient.
1.3.4 CPT facility layout
CPT requires many different components in addition to the accelerator, each of which
needs to be carefully considered in planning a new facility. Naturally, spaces in the
facility are required to house patient facilities such as consultation rooms and imaging

For the facility hardware, space must be available for the injector and injection
beam lines, the accelerator, extraction beam lines and transport and finally a number
of rotating gantries or fixed beam-lines for patient treatment. Fixed beam-lines are
usually either horizontal or vertical and a facility commonly has at least one of each
in order to reach a good range of tumour irradiation angles with minimal movement
of the patient treatment table. A rotating gantry allowing full 360 flexibility of
beam entrance angles requires a greater level of technological complexity, but provides
superior flexibility in treatment planning and implementation. An example of such
a facility is the IBA proton therapy centre [21] shown in Fig. 1.5. A view of the

1.3.5 Irradiation techniques
There are two main techniques of irradiation which can broadly be described as pas-
sive spreading and active scanning. Choosing an irradiation technique is of critical
importance to the accelerator design. In particular the active scanning technique re-
quires a highly flexible accelerator which can provide variable energy beams, whereas
the passive spreading technique can be performed with a fixed energy machine. The
most commonly used technique in current facilities is that of passive spreading, but
the trend for future facilities is toward active scanning due to its superior dose con-
formation and lack of patient specific hardware [16].
Passive spreading technique
Proton or ion beams of a single energy display a Bragg peak which is too narrow to be
used in treatment without modification [13]. Such beams must undergo two separate
stages of modification; range modification and passive spreading.
A range modifier has the effect of spreading out the Bragg peak in depth, creating
1.3. Charged particle therapy
the so-called Spread out Bragg Peak (SOBP). This range spreading is achieved by
using a rotating device with variable thickness of plastic, similar to that shown in
Fig. 1.7. The resultant SOBP depth dose profile is shown in Fig. 1.8 and achieves a
plateau of uniform dose which is designed to cover the target area depth-wise while
sparing unwanted dose to nearby healthy tissues. The fact that this device is rotating
means that the tumour can be treated in multiple layers. In some cases further use
of patient specific hardware such as absorbers shaped to the treatment region, as in
Fig. 1.9, can achieve a superior conformation to the tumour.
The second stage of modification, passive spreading, involves using scattering foils
to adjust the size of the beam in addition to collimators and apertures which further
assist in providing a dose which is highly conformed to the tumour shape in the lateral
plane. By creating the SOBP and using the scattering system, the field of the beam
is large enough in area to treat the entire tumour, or a significantly large part of it,
in multiple layers to conform to the 3D shape of the tumour.
Figure 1.7: An example of a range modulator. The plastic modulator has a step-like
structure in order to reduce the penetration depth of the Bragg peak to form the
SOBP.
However, concerns exist about the use of passive spreading techniques. One of the
major objections involves the production of neutrons in the scattering system which
may provide an unwanted dose to the patient [23]. Solutions to this issue have been
proposed involving the use of collimators [24], however a solution which avoids the
production of neutrons entirely by actively changing the beam energy and position

would be superior.
Active scanning technique
A major recent advance in CPT is the use of active beam scanning, usually in the
form of spot scanning [25]. In this technique, the charge of the proton or ion beam
is utilised to enable magnetic scanning of small pencil beams of particles in order
to paint the tumour in three dimensions. For dose planning the volume is divided
into small fixed volume elements known as voxels (volumetric pixels). In the spot
scanning method the beam is repeatedly moved to a static position before the dose
is delivered to the target voxel with a defined energy. This results in an extremely
accurately conformed dose to the tumour, and requires no patient specific hardware,
which is seen as a significant advantage over passive scattering.
In analogy to IMRT, the feasibility of using rotating gantries to achieve intensity
modulated proton therapy (IMPT) has recently been developed at PSI in Switzer-
land [22]. This has been shown to provide superior dose distributions to the equivalent
IMRT [26].

1.3.6 Current status of CPT
To date, more than 70,000 patients have been treated with protons and light ions [27].
Initially, this treatment was only available at laboratories which hosted appropriate
accelerators, but over the last 20 years there have been several CPT centres built in
major hospitals, particularly in the US and Japan. The UK was a pioneer in the
field of proton therapy, opening the Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology in 1989 [9].
Worldwide CPT facilities as of December 2009 given by the Particle Therapy Co-
Operative Group [27] and the number of patients treated are listed in Table 1.2.
The field of CPT is undergoing rapid expansion, with 22 new facilities currently
in the planning stage. Of these, 5 are in Germany, 4 are in the USA, there are 2 in
both the Slovak Republic and Italy and the remaining 9 are in France, Switzerland,
Austria, Sweden, Russia, Taiwan, Japan, China and South Africa.

1.4. Clinical requirements for accelerators
best possible treatment method is delivered. This thesis will focus on the delivery
of protons (p+) and fully stripped carbon ions (C6+) for two reasons; these are the
species which have the most clinical experience and carbon, being one of the lightest of
the heavy ion species available, would require a smaller accelerating ring than O8+,
Ne10+ or any heavier species and so represents a compromise between radiobiological
effectiveness and the required technology. These clinical requirements have been
developed into a set of parameters which the machine must be able to deliver, which
are given in Table 1.3.
In addition to the requirements which come from clinical considerations, the ac-
celerator must be suitable for use in a hospital environment. This imposes a number
of constraints on the design which must be considered from the outset.
1. In order to ensure that treatment plans can be accurately followed, the system
must be extremely reliable. The overall facility requires an availability of greater
than 95%. The accelerator itself needs to have an availability of around 99% or
greater. If this availability is not obtained down time of the treatment system
can cause undesirable breaks in patient treatment plans.
2. The facility must be easy to operate and maintain. The number of staff required
to run the accelerator must be minimised and ideally the machine should be a
turn-key solution, which is highly reliable and simple in its operation.
3. Hospitals often have restricted space available, therefore the overall facility
should be kept as small as possible.
4. The cost of the machine should be kept to a minimum.
The implications of these requirements together with the clinical requirements
given in Table 1.3 are addressed in terms of accelerator design in Chapter 2.

Chapter 2
Accelerator physics challenge
The design of an accelerator for a CPT facility should be driven by the clinical re-
quirements outlined in Section 1.4. Taken individually the 1 kHz cycle rate, extremely
high reliability, multiple particle species, variable energy extraction or small acceler-
ator footprint are all within the reach of current technology. However, taken simul-
taneously these requirements pose a significant challenge to the accelerator physics
community. This chapter outlines existing accelerator technologies used for CPT,
including the advantages and disadvantages of each type. A new accelerator called
a non-scaling Fixed Field Alternating Gradient accelerator (ns-FFAG) is introduced,
which is expected to be able to meet all the requirements of CPT simultaneously.
The ns-FFAG is discussed in more detail and its feasibility as a CPT accelerator is
studied.
2.1 Existing accelerator technology
Beam energies required for therapy are relatively low; up to 1 GeV compared to the
multi-TeV energy range required for high energy physics experiments. As such, these
energies can be achieved with a number of different types of accelerator including
synchrotrons, cyclotrons and linacs. Due to the limited space available in a clinical
2.1. Existing accelerator technology
environment, a circular accelerator is usually chosen as the main accelerator for a
CPT facility. While there have been recent developments such as the Cyclinac
design [29, 30], linear accelerators are not considered here. There are a number of
choices of circular accelerator. Most existing or planned facilities use the established
technologies of either a synchrotron or cyclotron, both of which are discussed in more
detail below.
2.1.1 Cyclotrons
First conceived by Lawrence in 1929 [31], the fixed-frequency cyclotron uses a vertical
magnetic guide field, B, which is constant in time, together with a fixed frequency
for acceleration. The particles to be accelerated are produced by an ion source in the
centre of the machine and are given an accelerating kick each time they cross between
the two D-shaped electrodes, as shown in the diagram of the Lawrence Cyclotron in
Fig. 2.1 from Lawrences original patent [32]. The RF frequency matches the cyclotron
frequency, fc of Eqn. 2.1, which is constant for non-relativistic particles [33].
(2.1)
where q and m are the charge and mass of the accelerated particle and B is the
magnetic field strength. Focusing in the vertical direction is produced by a horizontal
field component which arises near the edge of the cyclotron magnets, which can also
be seen on the right-hand drawing in Fig. 2.1. To ensure vertical stability at all radii,
the magnetic field must in practice be reduced slightly toward the outer edge of the
cyclotron.
The fixed magnetic field of a cyclotron leads to the particles spiralling radially
outward as they gain energy until they are extracted at a particular radius, corre-
sponding to a defined energy. The particle trajectories are constantly being bent in
2.1. Existing accelerator technology

the magnetic field. This constant bending with no long straight sections makes the
cyclotron very compact and so a natural choice for a hospital based accelerator. How-
ever, the energy reach of fixed-frequency cyclotrons is limited due to particle orbits
and RF fields losing synchronicity at relativistic velocities.
It should also be noted that while these accelerators have a relatively small foot-
print, high energy cyclotrons require extremely large volumes of iron for the yoke,
which introduces technical and manufacturing difficulties, as well as making them
expensive.
To counteract this, AVF (Azimuthally Varying Field) cyclotrons employ an az-
imuthally varying field in the form of additional pole pieces at periodic azimuthal
positions or through the use of separated [34] or spiral [35, 36] sectors. This az-
imuthally varying field introduces additional horizontal field components, enhancing
vertical focusing and allowing for increased beam currents. These cyclotrons go some
way to counteract relativistic effects, particularly in the case of the isochronous cy-
clotron, in which the particles have a constant revolution frequency.
Further developments include the synchrocyclotron, employing a variable fre-
quency RF field to allow synchronisation with the particle orbits into the relativistic
2.1. Existing accelerator technology
regime. This machine is cyclic in nature rather than providing a quasi-continuous
beam like the fixed-frequency cyclotron. It is generally seen as a precursor to the
synchrotron for this reason.
Industrial turn-key cyclotron solutions exist for proton therapy, such as the IBA
C235 [21, 37]. Developments are underway to create carbon ion cyclotron solutions,
for example the IBA C400 [38], although no solution is commercially available at
present. As an example of the issue of magnetic yoke volume, the yoke required for
the C400 cyclotron has a weight of over 700 tonnes, which may make the machine
expensive when compared to other solutions.
Another important consideration is the cyclotrons fixed extraction energy. For
CPT this means that the beam energy must be adjusted between the accelerator and
the patient using an energy degrader as discussed in Section 1.3.5. The cyclotron
provides ample current to enable sufficient dose to the patient. However, the losses
produced by passive scattering lead to concerns about activation and radiation pro-
tection in such a facility.
2.1.2 Synchrotrons
The idea of an accelerator consisting of a ring of pulsed magnets came from the
Australian physicist Marcus Oliphant in 1943 [39], followed by the discovery of the
phase stability principle in 1944 independently by Veksler [40] and McMillan [41, 42].
Original synchrotrons were of the weak-focusing variety. In this kind of synchrotron
transverse focusing in the vertical (y) direction is achieved by introducing a field with
a gradient 0 < n < 1 with respect to the radial direction r, where
. (2.2)
Modern synchrotrons employ the principle of alternating-gradient or strong fo-
2.1. Existing accelerator technology
cusing [43, 44] in which alternating focusing and defocusing magnets lead to much
stronger focusing forces in the transverse plane than in constant-gradient weak-
focusing synchrotrons.
This alternating-gradient focusing is also employed in another type of acceler-
ator, the FFAG, which will be dicussed in Section 2.1.5. The differences between
the alternating-gradient synchrotron and the FFAG accelerator are primarily in the
transverse beam dynamics. Some key concepts in transverse dynamics of alternating-
gradient accelerators are introduced here.
2.1.3 Transverse dynamics
In the following discussion of transverse dynamics, the reference frame shown in
Fig. 2.2 is adopted, where the s-axis is in the beam direction, the z-axis is tangential
to the beam direction, the x-axis is in the horizontal transverse direction and the
y-axis is in the vertical transverse direction. The radial direction, r, points directly
away from the centre of the circular accelerator. Angles of rotation are defined as ,
the angle of roll about the z-axis, , the angle of rotation about the y-axis and , the
angle of rotation about the x-axis.
FODO lattice: In an alternating-gradient synchrotron, the magnets are arranged
into a series of cells, many of which may be identical. Together this pattern of cells
around the ring forms the so-called accelerator lattice. A common cell structure for
an alternating gradient synchrotron is the FODO lattice, consisting of a focusing (F)
quadrupole, a straight drift section (O), a defocusing quadrupole (D) and a further
drift section (O). It should be noted that an F quadrupole focuses in the horizontal
direction and defocuses in the vertical, while the D quadrupole does the opposite.
The combination of F and D focuses in both planes. This structure produces the
strong focusing effects characteristic of alternating-gradient synchrotrons. Bending

is provided by dipole magnets inserted into the drift (O) sections in appropriate
locations around the accelerator.
Hills equation: The transverse motion in an alternating-gradient accelerator con-
sisting of ideal dipole and quadrupole components is termed linear motion, and is
governed by Hills equation. For a particle of ideal energy, Hills equations in the hor-
izontal (x) and vertical (y) planes, with respect to the beam direction (s) are given
in Eqn. 2.3.
x +Kx(s)x = 0
y +Ky(s)y = 0
(2.3)
Where the following definitions apply for positive charged particles [45]:

where  is the bending radius of a magnet, defined as the radius of an arc described
by a charged particle traversing the magnet. With the condition of periodicity on the
focusing functions over a period of length L, Kx,y(s + L) = Kx,y(s), the solution to
Hills equation in each plane (neglecting the subscripts x, y) for K > 0 is of the form:
(s) cos[(s) + 0] (2.5)
From Eqn. 2.5 it is clear that the motion in a linear system which obeys Hills
equation is similar to that of simple harmonic motion with both a constant amplitude
component
 corresponding to the emittance of Eqn. 2.11 and a varying amplitude
component
(s), with a phase, (s) which is a function of distance around the ring
and related to  (see next section) by Eqn. 2.6. The full derivation of the solution of
Hills equation can be found in Refs. [45, 46] among others and is discussed in more
detail in Chapter 3.
(s) =
(2.6)
Betatron tune: Particles in an alternating gradient circular accelerator undergo
oscillating trajectories in both the horizontal and vertical directions, known as beta-
tron oscillations. The phase of the oscillating trajectory advances around the machine,
and the number of oscillations per turn is called the betatron tune of the accelerator,
Q, defined in Eqn. 2.7.
2.1. Existing accelerator technology
= Q (2.7)
where Q is the machine tune, C is the machine circumference, s is in the direction
of the beam,  is the wavelength of the oscillations and  is the betatron function
describing the oscillations [46]. The cell tune,  is the phase advance per cell, corre-
sponding to the machine tune Q divided by the number of cells.
Chromaticity: Chromaticity, (p) is defined as the change in cell tune,  with
momentum, p, as in Eqn. 2.8, where p0 is a reference momentum and p = p p0.

with momentum. For a change in momentum, p such that p = p0 + p, the change
in particle position is

Figure 2.3: Emittance ellipse with dimensions in terms of , ,  and .
Emittance: The emittance  is the phase space area occupied by the beam, usually
given in units of mm mrad. Various definitions exist depending on the fraction of
the beam contained in the phase space. The definition used throughout this work is
the RMS emittance, which can be calculated from particle phase space co-ordinates
(x, x), as in Eqn. 2.11.
rms =
x2x2  xx2
x2 = , x2 = , xx = .
(2.11)
The corresponding ellipse in phase space (called the Courant-Snyder invariant)
is of the form (s)x2 + 2(s)xx + (s)x2 = , where the dimensions of the ellipse
in phase space at a point s along the beamline can be described by the ,  and 
functions together with the emittance  as in Fig. 2.3 [47]. The quantities ,  and
 are referred to as the Twiss parameters.
As the beam size adiabatically shrinks with increase in momentum, for proton
beams the normalised emittance is normally quoted. The normalised emittance is an
adiabatic invariant and is given by N = ., where in this case  and  refer to the

relativistic quantities.
Action variable (J): Hills equation can be derived from a pseudo-Hamiltonian as
in Eqn. 2.12.
x2 +
K(s)x2 (2.12)
where (x, x) are the phase space co-ordinates and K(s) is the focusing function
discussed earlier. As the solution to Hills equation is known it can be shown [45, p.

(2.13)
where  is the phase,  is the Twiss parameter of Eqn. 2.6 and  = 1
d(s)
. Thus
the action J is
x dx. (2.14)
In a similar way to the emittance, there is an area enclosed by an invariant torus
of 2 J. It can be seen that J corresponds to a kind of single particle emittance and
is expressed in terms of mm mrad in a similar way to the emittance. This can be
used to track single particles to determine the dynamic aperture of an accelerator,
discussed in Chapter 3.
Resonances: In a real accelerator magnet positions, field strengths and gradients
all have associated errors which are distributed around the lattice. Hills equation
can be used to calculate the closed orbit with errors by integrating all the orbit kicks
provided by dipole errors or quadrupole errors. The integrand of this equation can
2.1. Existing accelerator technology
be expanded as a Fourier series, resulting in simple poles at all integer harmonics for
dipole errors, and at half-integer harmonics for quadrupole errors.
These simple poles are resonances, and may produce both orbit disortion and
distortion of the optical functions. The strongest resonances occur when the total
betatron tune of the machine approaches an integer (Qx,y = 1, 2, 3 . . . ) or half-integer
(Qx,y = 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 . . . ). Resonances can also occur at any point where pQxmQy =
n, where p, m and n are all integers. Generally, the strongest resonances are integer
resonances, with higher-order resonance producing a progressively weaker effect.
In a synchrotron the betatron tune is kept constant at a working point, chosen
to avoid resonances, and the lattice will have a corresponding working diagram which
represents both the chosen working point and gives an indication of the nearby res-
onances. An example of such a diagram for the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at
CERN is shown in Fig. 2.4.
2.1.4 Alternating-gradient synchrotrons
Alternating-gradient synchrotrons have a number of key differences from cyclotrons.
The magnets provide strong alternating-gradient focusing and may be either combined
function, with focusing and bending occurring in the same magnet, or separated
function magnets. The magnetic field is ramped during acceleration to maintain
particle orbits at the same radius. This has the effect of significantly decreasing the
size of the required beam pipe and magnet apertures, so the synchrotron becomes
a ring with small aperture magnets, very different in appearance to a cyclotron. A
further key difference is in the RF acceleration. Particles which are not in the ultra-
relativistic regime traversing the same radius will arrive at different times when their
energies (and thus velocities) are increased. To ensure the RF cavities continue to
accelerate the beam, the RF frequency must also be ramped during acceleration, in
strict synchronisation with the magnetic field increase and particle velocity increase.
2.1. Existing accelerator technology
Fig. 21  SPS working diamond
This equation just defines a set of lines in the Q diagram for each order of resonance and
for each value of the integer p.  Figure 21 shows these lines for the SPS.
Somehow, by careful adjustment of the quadrupoles in the lattice and by keeping the Q-
spread (chromaticity) small, we must coax the beam up to full energy without hitting the lines.
To make things more difficult, each line has a finite width, proportional to the strength of the
imperfection which drives it.  In some cases we must compensate the imperfections with
correction multipoles to reduce this width.
But before discussing resonances and their correction in another contribution to these
proceedings [4], a word about chromaticity.
8. CHROMATICITY
This steering of Q depends on careful regulation of quadrupole and dipole power
supplies.  In fact, much of the setting up time of a large accelerator is devoted to tune Q to be
constant as the fields and energy rise.  Once beam has been accelerated the problem becomes
one of reducing all effects which produce a spread in Q among the particles in the beam.  The
limit to this is usually reached when beam intensity is high enough to cause space-charge
focusing effects whose strength varies with the local beam density.  Before reaching this limit
one must correct the tune spread due to momentum:  the chromaticity.  This is exactly
equivalent to the chromatic aberration in a lens.  It is defined as a quantity  Q'
Q = "Q
It can be measured by changing the mean momentum of the beam by offsetting the r.f.
frequency and measuring Q.  Figure 22 shows such a measurement.  Changing the r.f.
frequency or momentum at a given field implies a change in radial position.  As we have seen,
an off-momentum particle will take up a new orbit following the dispersion function.

2.1. Existing accelerator technology
The synchrotron is a natural choice for a facility which provides both protons and
ions for therapy as its flexibility means it can accelerate multiple particle species.
However, it typically has a much larger footprint than a cyclotron [48]. Despite its
larger size, a number of features make the synchrotron a suitable accelerator for CPT.
Variable energy extraction is possible on a cycle-to-cycle basis at a rate of around
1 Hz. In the case of a rapid cycling synchrotron this may be increased to about
60 Hz. Slow resonant extraction, where a third order resonance is induced to cause a
controlled particle loss into the extraction line, is used to increase the beam extraction
time. This enables fast active transverse scanning of the tumour during this period,
removing the need for the passive scattering equipment required in the case of the
cyclotron.
There are two turn-key industrial solutions which use synchrotrons. Hitachi
provide the PROBEATTM synchrotron which has a radius of 3.66 m and operates at
0.5 Hz producing protons of variable energy from 70 to 250 MeV [49]. Hitachi are in
the design stages of a system which can provide carbon ions [50]. The synchrotron for
this system has a radius of around 9.55 m to provide C6+ up to 480 MeV per nucleon
and protons to 250 MeV. Their competitor in the current market is Siemens, who are
in the process of building a synchrotron 10.35 m in radius, designed to fulfil a contract
in Marburg, Germany [51]. This machine will provide C6+ up to 430 MeV per nucleon
and protons to 250 MeV at a repetition rate defined by the ramping speed of < 1 s
and extraction time of < 10 s.
In addition to turn-key industrial solutions, a number of synchrotron based CPT
centres exist or are being constructed which have been developed by research labo-
ratories or collaborations. In Europe a few of these include the HIT synchrotron in
Heidelberg [52] based on pioneering work at GSI [53] and synchrotrons based on the
CERN PIMMS report [48] at CNAO in Italy [54] and at MedAustron in Austria [55].

2.1.5 Scaling FFAGs
The synchrotron and cyclotron are two types of circular accelerator, but not the only
two. In general, there are four main types of circular accelerator, classified by the type
of guide field they use: fixed-field constant-gradient (conventional cyclotrons, syn-
chrocyclotrons and microtrons), pulsed-field constant-gradient (weak-focusing syn-
chrotrons and betatrons), pulsed-field alternating-gradient (AG synchrotrons), and
fixed-field alternating-gradient (FFAG) [56].
The fourth variety, FFAG accelerators were proposed in the early 1950s indepen-
dently by T. Ohkawa in Japan [57], K. R. Symon and D. W. Kerst in the United
States [58], and A. A. Kolomensky in Russia [59]. Symon and Kerst proposed a
type of circular accelerator with magnetic guide fields which are constant in time,
and which can accommodate stable orbits at all energies from injection to output
energy. It was suggested that due to the time-independent magnetic field the FFAG
would be simpler to construct and operate while accommodating a larger beam cur-
rent than conventional synchrotrons.
The key feature of the magnetic field of the FFAG is the increase in value of the
vertical magnetic field with radius. The particular shape of the field is given by the
rk law of Eqn. 2.15, which describes the increase in field with radius r with respect
to a reference radius r0, where the field increase is characterised by the field index, k.
By = B0
(2.15)
Shaping the magnetic field profile in this way ensures that the shape of the particle
orbits remains constant while the size of the orbits scales with energy, such that each
higher energy orbit is a geometrically similar enlargement of the lower energy orbits,
as derived by Kolomensky [56]. Due to these properties this type of FFAG is referred
to as the scaling variety.
2.1. Existing accelerator technology
A number of scaling FFAGs were constructed in the late 1950s following these
proposals, including three different electron accelerators at the Midwest Universi-
ties Research Association (MURA) [60, 61]. Proton FFAGs were not constructed
at this time, as high energy physics demanded the higher energies accessible with
synchrotrons rather than the improved performance of the FFAG.
In recent years, interest in FFAGs for their improved performance has increased
dramatically. Specifically, their performance in terms of rapid acceleration combined
with a very large beam acceptance could make them a potential solution for the
acceleration of muons for either a muon collider or a neutrino factory [62, 63]. Their
large beam acceptance, comparatively high energy reach and the reliability of having
fixed field magnets also attracted the attention of proponents of accelerator driven
sub-critical reactors. This renewed interest led to the construction of the first proton
scaling FFAG at the KEK laboratory in Japan, shown in Fig. 2.5 [64, 65], as well as a
150 MeV proton FFAG [66], a 10 MeV proton FFAG at KURRI [67] and a prototype
for an accelerator driven subcritical reactor [68].

Laboratory in Japan. Image courtesy of KEK.
One of the disadvantageous properties of this type of FFAG is the increasing orbit
radius with energy. This means that the scaling FFAG needs large aperture magnets

and RF systems, usually in excess of 1 m in horizontal bore. The magnets are also
complex in nature, particularly in the case of spiral-sector FFAGs. A prototype
magnet for the RACCAM project, a spiral-sector FFAG for medical applications, is
shown in Fig. 2.6. These components are considered to be very expensive, which
would have to be taken into account when considering the use of a scaling FFAG as
a therapy machine.

Grenoble.
In 1999 a new variety of FFAG was proposed, known as a non-scaling FFAG
or ns-FFAG [69]. This proposal recognised that the strict magnetic scaling law of
the FFAG could be relaxed, reducing the orbit shift with energy and providing new
possibilities for the development of accelerators for CPT and other applications.
2.2 Non-scaling FFAGs
The ns-FFAG allows the strict scaling law of the original FFAG to be relaxed, which
allows non-similar orbit shapes resulting in a much smaller change in orbit size during
acceleration as shown in Fig. 2.7 (adapted from Ref. [70]). The simplest form of the
ns-FFAG requires only quadrupoles with a radial offset, dramatically simplifying the
required magnets.
This relaxation of the scaling law also produces non-trivial changes in the beam
dynamics of the accelerator. The main difference in beam dynamics between a scal-

ing and a non-scaling FFAG is the variation of the betatron tune with energy. In a
scaling FFAG or a synchrotron the tune is designed to be constant in order to avoid
the crossing of resonances that may lead to beam deterioration or beam loss. In
the ns-FFAG the tune is allowed to vary dynamically, crossing through both integer
and half-integer betatron resonances. This intentional resonance crossing is discussed
further in Section 2.3.2.
2.2.1 Requirements of a ns-FFAG for CPT
As discussed in Chapter 1, the irradiation method of choice in CPT is spot scanning.
This method uses a pencil beam to irradiate a small fixed volume called a voxel.
In order to implement spot scanning, Intensity Modulated Particle Therapy (IMPT)
will be used to form a uniform dose field. It is estimated that a scanning speed of
100 voxel/sec will be required, setting the repetition rate of the accelerator at around
1 kHz.
Further requirements arise from Table 1.3, the most notable of which is the re-
quired energy range of protons and carbon ions for therapy. The lattice design is
also required to minimise the overall footprint of the accelerator while ensuring that
2.3. Existing ns-FFAG design proposals
sufficient drift space is available for RF cavities, injection and extraction systems,
corrector magnets and diagnostics.
2.3 Existing ns-FFAG design proposals
An existing design for a ns-FFAG for CPT by E. Keil, A. Sessler and D. Trobjevic can
be found in the literature [71] and will be referred to here as the KST lattice design.
This lattice is a suitable starting point for studies for PAMELA and consists of three
concentric rings, where each ring is a linear ns-FFAG lattice as shown in Fig. 2.8.
For the purpose of looking at the general properties of this design, the second ring is
taken to be representative of the complex.
This is the simplest type of ns-FFAG, the linear version, consisting of F (horizontal
focusing) and D (horizontal defocusing) quadrupoles, providing alternating gradient
(F/D) strong focusing. In this lattice, F and D doublet magnets are proposed in
which a radial offset between the F and D quadrupoles provides the dipole bending
field, removing the need for separate dipole magnets. The lattice of the second ring
comprises 48 FD doublet cells.
For simulation purposes the lattice is modelled as quadrupole magnets with the
radial offset described by a dipole field component. Lattice parameters are outlined
in Table 2.1 and the cell layout shown in Fig. 2.9. The simulation code MAD-X [72]
is used for initial studies, while the highly accurate code ZGOUBI [73] is used for
acceleration tracking studies.
The magnets are rectangular in shape, and magnetic fringe fields are described
using the Enge model [74], given in Eqn. 2.16, where F (R, ) is the fringe field coeffi-
cient. F is dependent on the radial co-ordinate and the azimuthal angle  within the
magnet, as the ZGOUBI magnet description is in polar co-ordinates.

with energy, in contrast to a synchrotron or scaling FFAG where the tune is designed
to remain constant. This changing tune will cross through integer and half-integer
betatron resonances, where any errors in the lattice will result in small kicks to the
beam which will build up with each subsequent turn, potentially damaging the beam.
The cell tune variation throughout acceleration in this lattice is shown in Fig. 2.11.
A proton/ion ns-FFAG achieves acceleration in around 1000 turns, which is fast
compared to a synchrotron, through still much slower than a muon or electron ns-
FFAG, which operate with around 20 turns. Studies of such accelerators for muons
[63] indicate that provided acceleration is fast enough, the resonances encountered
during acceleration can be crossed without damaging the beam. However, these
effects in a proton/ion ns-FFAG with a slower acceleration rate and higher number
of turns may be more significant.
To study the feasibility of such a ns-FFAG, alignment and field errors are analysed
using two methods. The first studies are at a fixed energy without acceleration, which
allows the natural effect of errors to be ascertained without the influence of resonance
crossing. The second study then accounts for resonance crossing during acceleration,
giving an indication of the severity of the resonance crossing and an idea of tolerances

2.3.1 Non-acceleration studies
Orbit and optical distortion sources
Orbit and optical distortions arise from errors in the accelerator components in a
linear ns-FFAG. These errors may be classified into two sources; alignment errors and
field errors.
Alignment errors of quadrupoles will introduce dipole magnetic field components,
which will produce closed orbit distortion. The probable maximum closed orbit ex-
cursion due to dipole field errors, when caused by N displaced quadrupoles [33] is:

N(si)

i (2.18)
where the dipole error at the i-th magnet, i = (Kl)ixi is caused by the displacement
by xi of a quadrupole of length l and strength K. The average   is understood to
be the RMS value.
Quadrupole field errors can produce pertubations in the optical functions. The

Closed orbit distortion due to alignment errors
Two hundred patterns of alignment errors are applied to the lattice. The errors are
Gaussian distributed with a cut-off at 3, with a different random value applied to
each of the 48 F/D pairs. The same alignment error (in magnitude and direction) is
applied to both members of each pair, as it is reasonable to assume that 2 magnets
mounted on a single support would have this property. The closed orbit is then
calculated for each lattice, and the closed orbit distortion defined as the maximum
deviation of the closed orbit from that of the error free lattice.
In order to quantify the effect of these alignment errors on the closed orbit, the
maximum closed orbit distortion for each error pattern was plotted, and the resulting
distribution fitted with a linear function. The amplification factor, A, as introduced
in [63] is used to quantify the magnitude of orbit distortion.
 Orbit distortion [mm] 
1 Alignment Error [mm] (2.21)
The largest closed orbit distortion in the horizontal (x) direction is produced by
a direct misalignment of the magnets along the x-axis, and similarly in the vertical
(y) direction. The x and y amplification factors for each alignment error and the
combination of all 6 types of alignment error are shown in Table 2.2, and an example of

momentum, K = 9.6948 [m2] and l = 0.27 [m], gives Ax = 4.45, which is in good
agreement with the MAD-X model, as expected.

Closed orbit distortion due to dipole errors
Closed orbit distortion can also be induced by errors in the dipole field of the magnets.
The majority of the bending field is provided in the D quadrupoles due to the beam
centre being off-axis.
2.3. Existing ns-FFAG design proposals
To study the effect of dipole field errors, 200 random patterns of dipole errors
were introduced to the D quadrupoles in the lattice, and the resulting closed orbit
distortion studied. Dipole field errors are specified as the integrated field strength,
K.ds, and in this case the dipole error amplification factor is defined as in Eqn. 2.22.
The result in this case is A(dipole)orbit = 16.0 for the horizontal direction, and 0 as
expected in the vertical direction.

Dipole errors can also induce distortion of optical functions such as the tune and
-functions in the accelerator. In order to quantify the optical distortion caused by
field errors in the magnets, the amplification factor is redefined as the average relative
deviation of the optical parameter with errors, from its original value (with no errors)
with respect to the average integrated field error.

An additional cause of optical distortion in the lattice will be quadrupole gradient

cally linked, however in other models they need not be. As a result these errors have
been studied independently for completeness. When modelling quadrupole gradient

Discussion of non-acceleration studies
The non-acceleration orbit distortion study indicates that the dominant cause of
closed orbit distortion in either transverse direction is dipole kicks due to the direct
misalignment of magnets in the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions.
The non-acceleration optical distortion study indicates that the severest impact of
both dipole and quadrupole field errors will be on the amplitude of the -functions.
2.3.2 Effects of resonance crossing
The scope of the previous non-acceleration studies is limited due to the dynamic
nature of the changing betatron tune in a linear ns-FFAG. Koscielniak and Baart-
man [76, 77] undertook an analytical study on rapid crossing of betatron resonances,
studying emittance growth at an isolated resonance. This paper gives, for an integer
resonance, a tolerance for the n-th Fourier component Bn of the vertical magnetic
field,

real emittance increase of the beam due to resonance crossing.
For the KST 3-ring lattice design considered here, the tolerable bn =
given
in [78] is 0.0266m1 for protons and 0.0376m1 for carbon ions (in comparison with
0.16m1 for a muon ns-FFAG) . This indicates that magnet errors may cause signifi-
cant distortion in a proton/ion ns-FFAG.
To ascertain the severity of the distortion caused by magnet alignment and field
errors in a linear proton ns-FFAG, a detailed analysis of the effects of resonance
crossing was undertaken including both acceleration and highly accurate tracking.
2.3.3 Acceleration studies
In a linear ns-FFAG accelerator the tune and other optical functions of the machine
vary throughout the acceleration cycle. To predict the outcome of resonance crossing
accurately the ray-tracing code ZGOUBI was chosen, as it incorporates both acceler-
ation and tracking simultaneously. Three effects are considered; those of the stability
of the betatron tune when quadrupole gradient errors are included, the effect of align-
ment errors on orbit distortion when crossing through resonances and the effect of
such resonance crossing on the emittance of an accelerated beam.
Betatron tune stability
The dependence of the betatron tune on quadrupole gradient quality was found for
10 equally spaced momenta throughout the acceleration cycle. Taking one cell of the
KST lattice, the F and D quadrupoles are given random patterns of 100 different
quadrupole gradient qualities up to K/K = 102, where K is the quadrupole gra-
dient By/x. In order to quantify the effect of gradient quality on the stability of
the cell tune (referred to as ), the definition of the amplification factor in Eqn. 2.25
was used. The quantity max is the maximum variation of the cell tune from the
perfect-quadrupole case out of the 10 momenta throughout the acceleration cycle.
2.3. Existing ns-FFAG design proposals
This accounts for the possibility of the tune being more sensitive in a particular re-
gion of the acceleration cycle. Qualitatively, this indicates how field gradient errors
affect the tune stability.
max
1(K/K)
(2.25)
The result is A=0.23 in the horizontal direction, and A=0.20 in the vertical direc-
tion. This indicates that the operating point chosen is quite stable, and quadrupole
gradient qualities do not have a large effect on the betatron tunes in this machine.
For example, a reasonable gradient quality of 1103 would only produce a 2.3104
difference in the horizontal tune. Given that for a lattice with no errors the horizontal
cell tune at the reference energy is around 0.17, this change corresponds to a shift in
horizontal tune of only 0.13%, which is tolerable.
Orbit distortion with acceleration
In contrast to the closed orbit distortion studied in Section 2.3.1, this study with
acceleration is to quantify the distortion of the orbit of a particle which begins on the
closed orbit but whose trajectory deviates from the closed orbit due to errors, rather
than the distortion of the closed orbit itself.
One hundred lattices were studied with patterns of alignment errors, this time
with 10 different error sizes and 10 different lattices with each error size. The pattern
of alignment errors is a Gaussian distribution cut-off at 3 to remove very large errors
which could have a dominant effect on the dynamics.
For this lattice design, each magnet within an FD doublet has the same magnitude
and direction of alignment error, as it can be assumed they would be constructed on a
single girder. One particle was tracked over 1000 turns to extraction, starting on the
closed orbit at injection. This results in an acceleration rate of around 220 keV/turn.
Accelerating cavities are represented as zero-length elements providing a simple en-
2.3. Existing ns-FFAG design proposals
ergy gain, with a cavity in every cell. This is done in order to neglect any resonance
phenomena which may occur from the asymmetrical placement of RF cavities in
the highly symmetric ring. Synchrotron motion is neglected as only the transverse
dynamics are of interest here.
The orbit shape changes throughout acceleration and the orbit distortion is defined
as the maximum deviation of the tracked particle from the closed orbit of the zero-
error lattice, as shown in Fig. 2.13.

Figure 2.13: Example of distortion in a linear ns-FFAG, where the orbit distortion is
calculated as the maximum distortion from the closed orbit of the zero-error lattice,
as shown by the red lines.
The largest error size used in the study is determined as the  error size at which
particles are lost during tracking. The range of errors used is then 10 evenly spaced
points between zero and the maximum error size. At each error size, the mean of
the results for 10 lattices with random error patterns is plotted and the standard
deviation of these results is given as error bars in Figs. 2.14 and 2.15.
The amplification factor is obtained by fitting a straight line to the mean values,
shown as a red line. The error on the amplification factor is determined by the
difference between the maximum/minimum fits and the central fit to the data.

celeration, is 336  104; i.e. a realistic alignment error of 50m would induce an
orbit distortion of approximately 16.8 mm. This is a factor of around 80 worse than
the distortion of the closed orbit itself in the non-acceleration case. In the vertical
direction the equivalent amplification factor is 293  136. It should be noted that
this presents an extremely stringent tolerance requirement on alignment errors in this
type of lattice. In fact, for an acceptable distortion of 1 mm, the alignment would
need to be better than 3m. This level of accuracy in alignment is not realistic.
Optical distortion with acceleration
The normalised emittance can be calculated from positions and momenta of a set of
particles. Normalised emittance is constant throughout acceleration for an error-free
lattice, however this is no longer true once alignment errors are incorporated.
To demonstrate the effect of the large orbit distortion observed in the previous
section, 36 particles on a 10 mm mrad normalised emittance ellipse were tracked
through the first 40 turns of acceleration, from 30.95 to 40 MeV. The initial ellipse
parameters were determined from multi-particle tracking through a single cell around
the closed orbit. Random horizontal alignment errors with a standard deviation
of 50m are included, as in the previous section. The normalised emittance is re-
calculated once per turn from the distribution of particle positions and angles in the
centre of the long straight section. The resulting increase in normalised horizontal
emittance is shown in Fig. 2.16.
The main regions in Fig. 2.16 where the emittance dramatically increases are those
points where an integer horizontal total tune is crossed, as indicated by the vertical
dashed lines. It is clear that a real beam would not survive the full acceleration cycle
in this lattice design.

2.4 Review of existing lattice designs
The lattice design presented here seems limited in its ability to meet the requirements
laid out in Section 2.2.1. The lattice is very dense, with the longest drift length being
just 0.29 m. While this makes the design relatively compact, it will have an impact in
limiting the space available for RF systems, injection, extraction, corrector magnets
and diagnostics. At the very least, this will be challenging to build.
However, the greatest problem presented here is the severity of alignment toler-
ances. The best alignment tolerances achieved in reality are around 50m. For the
lattice design studied, where the amplification factor is found to be 336 in the horizon-
tal direction and 293 in the vertical direction, this magnitude of error would result in
an orbit distortion of greater than 10 mm, which is unacceptable. Taking into account
additional sources of error including longitudinal and rotational alignment errors and
a realistic magnetic field quality, in a real machine a more severe orbit distortion is
expected than that observed here.
There are a number of ways to reduce the effect of resonance crossing on beam
blow-up in ns-FFAGs. This design crosses around 12 integer machine tune resonances
in both the horizontal and vertical plane. The variation of cell tunes throughout
2.4. Review of existing lattice designs
acceleration as calculated with ZGOUBI is shown in Fig. 2.11.
The first possible solution would be to increase the acceleration rate, to cross
the resonances more quickly. This may be feasible for a muon FFAG, but seems
unrealistic for a medical accelerator in which any increase in acceleration rate would
lead directly to greater capital costs for the machine. Increasing the acceleration rate
would also require a larger integrated RF length which would be difficult in such a
dense lattice with long straight sections of just 0.29 m.
Another option would be to change the number of cells. Assuming the beam
dynamics remain acceptable, reducing the number of cells will reduce the number of
machine integer resonances crossed, thereby reducing the amplification factor over the
acceleration cycle. This was studied in a similar way to the KST lattice for a design
based on a 24 cell lattice with wedge-shaped magnets [79, 80]. The total tune in
the 24-cell lattice crosses four times fewer integer resonances in each transverse plane
than the KST lattice and the amplification factor is reduced to 86.7. However, this
would still require an alignment tolerance of 10m or better to limit the distortion to
1 mm. For this reason, it seems unlikely that changing the number of cells can reduce
the problem to an acceptable level.
The third possible solution would be to add higher-order magnetic multipoles in
the form of chromatic correction to reduce the total tune excursion to within one
integer. This would remove the resonance crossing problem entirely. This method
will be explored in more detail in Chapter 3.
Chapter 3
A novel non-linear ns-FFAG
Protons and carbon ions are many times more massive than the electons and muons
for which the original ns-FFAG lattices were developed. The increased inertia of these
particles imposes constraints on the design which restrict both the rate at which the
particles can be bent in magnetic fields and the rate at which they can be accelerated.
The original ns-FFAG designs cannot be simply scaled up to meet these requirements,
as seen in Chapter 2. The only solution to this problem is the development of a new
lattice design.
The lattice designs for PAMELA (Particle Accelerator for MEdicaL Applications)
outlined in this chapter and in Chapter 4 reflect new developments in ns-FFAG accel-
erator design. Throughout the development process, strong emphasis is placed on the
need for realistic magnet, RF and injection/extraction designs. The constraints im-
posed by these various components are included in the lattice optimisation alongside
beam dynamics considerations.
To meet the particle energies defined by clinical requirements, two accelerating
rings are needed. This is to limit the momentum range covered in each ring which in
turn eases the RF frequency range and beam pipe apertures. The first ring accelerates
protons to 250 MeV and C6+ ions to 68 MeV/u and the second will accelerate C6+

to 400 MeV/u. The energies and rigidities of both particle species in these two rings
are given in Table 3.1.

highest extraction energy for each ring.
In each lattice, the variation of the total betatron tune in both transverse planes
is constrained to within half an integer throughout acceleration. This avoids the
problems associated with linear ns-FFAG lattices discussed in Chapter 2. Simulta-
neously, the lattice solution maintains advantageous non-scaling properties such as
a small orbit excursion and relatively simple magnets which are easy to align. The
lattice design strategy is outlined here, together with the optimisation and resulting
performance of the smaller proton ring.
3.1 Design Strategy
The first aim of the design strategy is to overcome the deterioration of the beam due
to resonance crossing as discussed in Chapter 2. To achieve this, there have been
a number of strategies proposed. The first is from Johnstone et al. who propose a
linear ns-FFAG with wedge-shaped quadrupoles [81]. Both the path length through
the quadrupole and the edge focusing [45, p.42] are designed as a function of the beam
momentum. This makes the effective optics of the lattice independent of momentum.
It is then possible for the tune to be kept within an integer over a wide momentum
3.1. Design Strategy
range, avoiding the crossing of major resonances. However, over the momentum range
proposed, the orbit shift in these designs is still relatively large, of the order of 1 m.
Another strategy to avoid resonance crossing was proposed by S. Machida [82]. In
this case a more conventional method of chromaticity correction is applied to a linear
ns-FFAG. This involves adding a sextupole and octupole component to the linear ns-
FFAG to correct the natural chromaticity, where the strength of these components
is determined by the downhill simplex method [83]. Unfortunately chromaticity cor-
rection of this type results in a machine which has complex multipole magnets and
a similar orbit shift to a scaling FFAG. The reason for this is two-fold. First, chro-
maticity correction is usually applied where the dispersion function is largest as it
is most effective at this point. However, the dispersion function in linear ns-FFAGs
tends to be small as this gives the desirable property of a smaller orbit shift. This
means that the non-linear magnet strengths to obtain chromaticity correction must
be large in such a machine. Second, the upper limit on cell tune variation is inversely
proportional to the number of cells. The requirement that the total tune variation is
restricted to within an integer (or preferably half an integer) indicates that a small
number of cells is preferable, whereas a linear ns-FFAG tends to have a large number
of cells. This makes chromaticity correction even more challenging.
Instead of trying to introduce zero chromaticity in a linear ns-FFAG, the PAMELA
design maintains the properties of a scaling FFAG as much as possible while relaxing
the strictly scaling magnetic field and simplifying the magnet shape and alignment.
This allows a fixed tune over the momentum range, while having the flexibility to
minimise the orbit shift and simplify the machine construction.
The concept of this novel type of ns-FFAG is based on an idea first suggested by
S. Machida at the FFAG08 workshop in Manchester, UK [84] which was then devel-
oped by this author for the PAMELA design [85, 86]. The design concept begins by
considering a radial-sector scaling FFAG with a FDF (focusing-defocusing-focusing)
3.1. Design Strategy
triplet structure. A scaling FFAG of this variety employs a magnetic guide field which
follows the rk law, introduced in Chapter 2, which results in geometrically similar or-
bit sizes and constant tunes throughout acceleration. It is normal in this type of
FFAG for the orbit shift to be of the order of 1 m, which is undesirably large. The
orbit shift scales with the field index k as in Eqn. 3.1.
k + 1
, (3.1)
where r is the orbit shift, p is the momentum increase from injection to extrac-
tion and p0 and r0 correspond to the the reference momentum and reference radius.
Unfortunately, attempting to increase the field index k to reduce the orbit shift will
increase the phase advance until the optics become unstable as;
k. (3.2)
However, this is only the case if considering the first stability region of Hills
equation. By further increasing the focusing strength in the FDF triplet focusing
structure, it is possible to have a second stability region next to the first. This
is discussed further in Section 3.1.1. From this starting point, the design strategy
adopted here makes the design non-scaling, breaking away from the scaling FFAG
principle at each stage of the design process, while ensuring that the total machine
tune variation is within half an integer to avoid the resonance crossing described in
Chapter 2.
The design of this FFAG lattice has major differences from the scaling concept and
should be referred to as a non-linear ns-FFAG. The main differences are as follows:
1. The scaling law is approximated as a Taylor series (and later a polynomial
fit) and truncated at the octupole or decapole. This breaks the scaling law
and makes the machine non-scaling. This also significantly changes the magnet
3.1. Design Strategy
design, removing the need for iron-cored magnets with the complicated pole
shaping used in a scaling FFAG.
2. The magnets, rather than being sector-shaped as in a scaling FFAG, are made
rectangular, in order to reduce costs in manufacturing.
3. The magnets in each triplet cell are aligned along a straight line, rather than
along the arc of a circle described at the machine radius. This should ease
alignment and the production of other systems, such as cryogenics, which will
need to be integrated.
4. The second stable region of Hills equation is used, with a horizontal phase
advance per cell greater than 180. This allows for a larger field index to be
used, resulting in factor of five reduction in orbit excursion.
5. Depending on the ratio of cell length to machine circumference, the straight
sections between cells can be increased to provide a long straight section of over
1 m, while preserving stable dynamics. The idealised layout of the lattice design
is shown in Fig. 3.1.
3.1.1 Solution of Hills equation for a second stable region
The numerical solution of Hills equation for an FDF triplet focusing structure is cen-
tral to the lattice design strategy. The solution of the linear second order differential
Hills equation is well known and its application to accelerators is found in many
sources, the most relevant to this work being Ref. [44] and Ref. [56, p. 85-87]. The
full solution is given here and stable regions are found numerically using Mathemat-
ica TM [87]. The solution for basic FD alternating gradient focusing is discussed first,
followed by the solution for FDF triplet focusing.

3.1. Design Strategy
The equations for horizontal and vertical motion are given in Eqn. 3.3 and the
function f() can be used to describe basic FD alternating gradient focusing, as in
Eqn. 3.4, where  is the azimuthal position in one cell of total angle 0, f0 is the
average focusing strength in the horizontal/vertical plane respectively and f1 is the
strength of alternating gradient focusing. The focusing term in Hills equation is
normalised so that the solution is independent of machine radius and is given by
f(), where l is the total length of the cell.

y Ky = 0

f() =
f0 + f1 = const., 0 <  <

The solution to the linear second order differential Hills equation in the matrix
formulation takes the form of Eqn. 3.5 in which x(s) is the derivative of x(s) and the
same form of solution holds in the vertical y(s) plane.

The focusing function f() is piecewise constant and the matrix M(s|s0) is simply
the product of the matrices for the sub-intervals in which f() is constant. The
matrices for each sub-interval for constant focusing take a different form depending
on whether f() is greater, less than or equal to 0, as in Eqns. 3.6 to 3.8.

gions appear, in this case the first 6 stable regions in each plane are shown. Naturally,
stability in one plane does not mean the same region is stable in the other plane. The
regions where both planes are stable are shown in yellow. In this example there
are no drift spaces between the magnets, which is an unrealistic scenario. Including
drift spaces will move the stability regions apart, so that for reasonable values of the
focusing (f0, f1 < 2) only the first stable region is available using FD focusing.
The triplet lattice in an FDF configuration such as the one considered here has a
different function of f(), given in Eqn. 3.9, where  is the magnet packing factor -
the total length of the FDF triplets compared to the machine circumference.
f() =

f0  f1 = const.,

The stable regions are again found using MathematicaTMand are shown in Fig. 3.3.
In the top half of each stability diagram where 0 < f1 < 2, two small yellow stable
regions are visible which come progressively closer to each other between Fig. 3.3a
and Fig. 3.3b as the packing factor  is reduced from 0.8 to 0.5. This is mirrored
in the bottom half of the stability diagrams for 2 < f1 < 0. The advantage of
having the two stable regions close to each other is that the lattice functions (tunes,
-functions etc...) should be similar in the two regions.
The FDF triplet focusing lattice was selected due to the availability of the second
stable region close to the first with a reasonable packing factor and f0, f1 < 2.
3.1. Design Strategy
3.1.2 Selection of baseline lattice parameters
In order to access the second stable region of Hills equation for an FDF triplet
focusing lattice while maintaining suitable dynamics, it is preferable to have a small
(  0.5) packing factor, as discussed above. However, too small a value for 
results in short magnet lengths with very long straight sections. This may result in
unachievable magnetic fields or, to compensate, a very large radius of the accelerator.
For these reasons  is chosen to be suitably large to achieve a compact accelerator
while preserving the stable dynamics.
Once the packing factor and average radius are chosen, the peak magnetic field
can be reduced slightly by extending the magnets into the short drift space, ensuring
the magnetic centre remains fixed. The baseline lattice design parameters for the
proton ring for PAMELA are outlined in Table 3.2. This baseline is taken as a
starting point for comparison of the effects of the design strategy on lattice dynamics
and for lattice optimisation.

tunes of around x = 0.75, y = 0.25. The cell tunes are later refined to ensure the
total tune variation is away from any integer resonances.
3.2 Effects of design strategy on lattice dynamics
Each of the major changes from a scaling FFAG described earlier in Section 3.1 affects
the lattice dynamics in a different way. For the purpose of studying these indepen-
dently, each change is applied separately to the baseline lattice. Further consideration
is given to the variation of fringe field extent with radius and the difference between
using a Taylor expansion or polynomial fit to the scaling FFAG field profile. The end
result is the optimised design for the proton and low energy carbon lattice.
3.2.1 Multipole expansion
Starting from the baseline scaling FFAG design, the first step of the design strategy
is the multipole expansion of the vertical magnetic field. The field increase in the
radial direction, as defined in Chapter 2 is given by B = B0(r/r0)
k, where r is the
radial co-ordinate, k is the field index defined as k = (r/By)(dBy/dr) and y is the
vertical direction. This field profile is shown in Fig. 3.5.
When the scaling law is expanded as a Taylor series and truncated at the decapole
(n=4) component, the resulting field profile is given by Eqn. 3.10.
By = B0

Due to the nature of a Taylor expansion, the difference in field between the exact
scaling law and this expansion increases with distance from the reference radius, r0.
The particles follow trajectories with a different mean radius in each magnet, as they

experience reverse bending in the D magnet, shown in Fig. 3.6. For this reason, a
different r0 value is used in the F and D magnets. The offset is determined to be the
central point of the orbit shift at the centre of each magnet in an ideal scaling version
of the FFAG.
If this offset is not implemented, there is a large deviation in tune at low momen-
tum, caused by the difference between the Taylor expansion and the ideal scaling law
in this region, as shown in Fig. 3.7.
In this case the magnets are wedge shaped and aligned such that three triplet
magnets face the machine centre as in a scaling FFAG. Single particles tracked through
one cell on the closed orbit at the injection and highest extraction momentum are
shown in Fig 3.6.
In order to determine the multipole order required to achieve a total tune excursion
of less than half an integer, the betatron tunes throughout acceleration are obtained by
multi-particle tracking for different orders of included multipoles. Multipole orders up

order of multipole expansion.
3.2.2 Variation of fringe field extent
In a scaling FFAG, the variation of the fringe field extent with radius can play a part
in minimising the tune excursion as in Ref. [89]. The fringe fields in ZGOUBI are
described using the Enge model as described in Chapter 2. The half-gap height of the
magnet g can be made dependent on radius, as in Eqn. 3.11, where g0 is the half-gap
height at the reference radius r0. This allows for variation of the fringe field extent
with radius according to the variable . In the case of  6= 0, g0 is replaced by g in
Eqn. 2.17.
g(r) = g0(r0/r)
 (3.11)
The effect of this variation was examined for the case of the multipole expansion
up to and including the decapole component. The first case has a fringe field extent
proportional to the orbit radius so the extent increases with radius ( = 1), and
the second has the opposite property, where the fringe field extent decreases with
radius ( = +1). These are compared to a case with constant fringe field extent with
radius ( = 0). For both cases g0 = 60 mm and the coefficients C0 = 0.1455, C1 =

3.2.3 Rectangular magnets
The lattice magnets become simpler to construct and align when they are rectangular
rather than wedge or sector shaped. For the purpose of studying the specific effect that
using rectangular magnets has on lattice dynamics, the orientation of the magnets

remains the same at this stage so that the three rectangular magnets face the machine
centre.
An idealized rectangular magnet can be defined with field lines parallel to the
magnet axis. The field profile is represented in a Cartesian coordinate system as
By = By,0
x0 + x
= By,0
k(k  1)    (k  n+ 1)
(3.12)
where x0 at the F magnet and D magnet are the same as r0 defined in the previous
section, x is the horizontal coordinate and k is the field index as before. Multipoles up
to n = 3, 4, 5 (octupole, decapole and dodecapole, respectively) are included. A line
perpendicular to each F magnet axis intersects that of the D magnet at the machine
centre, as shown in Fig. 3.10. The Enge type fringe field with a constant extent of
60 mm is assumed, as before. As the magnets are rectangular, it is reasonable to
assume that the fringe field extent is constant and independent of radial position.

3.2.4 Alignment of magnets
To simplify alignment issues further, the three multipole magnets are aligned parallel
with each other. As shown in Fig. 3.12, both F magnets are rotated with respect to
the magnet centre so that the three magnets become parallel. This will lead, in a
realistic scenario, to a transverse offset between the magnets in the triplet in order
to optimise the magnetic bore size. The field profile of each magnet is the same as
in the previous section, namely the multipoles up to a certain order are included and
the fringe field has a constant extent of 60 mm.

The resulting tunes throughout acceleration are shown in Fig. 3.13 and the varia-
tion of tunes is given in Table 3.5. In the case up to decapole, the maximum variation
of the total horizontal tune is 0.093 and of the total vertical tune is 0.250. These values
are very similar to the case before and well within half an integer.

3.2.5 Taylor expansion vs. polynomial fit
So far the multipole components used have been determined by using a Taylor expan-
sion of the scaling field around the central orbit position for each magnet. However,
for an orbit shift of greater than  100 mm, a closer fit to the field profile of rk can
be obtained using a polynomial fit in the region of interest, that is the region of mag-
netic field experienced by the particle beam. The polynomial fit is calculated using
the well-known method of least squares.
The main reason for trying to match the multipole expansion to that of the ideal
field profile is to achieve flat tunes throughout acceleration. Since the betatron tunes
are determined by the local gradient of the field rather than the field value itself, an
improvement in the overall tune excursion throughout acceleration may be achieved
by ensuring that the gradient of the field is as close as possible to the gradient of
the ideal profile. The variation from the ideal gradient profile after using a Taylor
expansion to decapole is shown in Fig. 3.14, where B is the field gradient with
respect to radius. In the region that the beam experiences, shown by the dotted
lines, the gradient of the field differs from the exact scaling profile by around 1% at
the low momentum end, where the maximum tune excursion is observed in Fig. 3.8.
Any further excursion of the beam in this direction would result in a gradient which
rapidly diverges from the ideal gradient profile.
For comparison, the variation of the field strength (rather than the gradient) using
a Taylor expansion does not show such a large difference from the ideal field profile,
3.2. Effects of design strategy on lattice dynamics
as seen in the decapole curve in Fig. 3.7. This shows that in order to minimise the
variation of tunes, the field gradient must be as close as possible to the ideal gradient.

Therefore, in order to achieve flatter tunes throughout acceleration, polynomial
fits to either the field strength or field gradient determined by the scaling law are
considered. The resulting tune excursion for polynomial fits to the field strength
and field gradient using up to the decapole component, and the tune excursion for
a polynomial fit to the field gradient using only up to the octupole component, are
given in Table 3.6 and shown in Fig. 3.15.

ring. In both (a) and (b) the difference between the two decapole cases is too small
to be visible at this scale.
3.3. Proton lattice performance
These results indicate that by simply using a polynomial fit to either the field
profile or the gradient instead of using a Taylor expansion results in a greatly improved
fit to the local field gradient, and hence a much reduced total tune excursion.
In fact, the variation of the total tune throughout acceleration using a polynomial
fit up to the octupole component is reduced to just 0.156 and 0.182 for the horizontal
and vertical tunes respectively. These are both well within half an integer, indicating
that it is possible to achieve the required total tune constraint without the need for
a decapole field if a polynomial fit to the field profile is used. This allows for further
simplification of the required magnets, helping to reduce the machine cost.
3.3 Proton lattice performance
The lattice which emerges from the four steps of the design procedure using a polyno-
mial fit to the field is considered to be the optimised lattice design. The parameters
of the resulting proton lattice are in Table 3.7. This is the design adopted for further
studies of the lattice performance.

3.3.1 Alignment error studies
In a similar manner to Section 2.3.3, a study of alignment errors including acceleration
was undertaken on this lattice design, in order to show that by avoiding resonance
crossing, the large orbit distortion observed in linear ns-FFAGs is also avoided [80].
3.3. Proton lattice performance
Gaussian distributed patterns of random horizontal alignment errors were intro-
duced to each magnet in the lattice1, using 10 different values of the standard devi-
ation  from 0 to 100m in steps of 10m. The Gaussian distributions are cut-off
at 3, which removes very large errors which could have a dominant effect on the
dynamics.
For each value of , a different random value is applied to each of the lattice
magnets and a single particle is tracked to extraction over 1000 turns. The orbit
distortion is calculated as the maximum difference between the distorted particle
orbit and the orbit of a particle in an error free lattice. This is repeated 10 times for
each  value and the mean and RMS values of the orbit distortion are calculated.
To ascertain the difference in sensitivity to alignment errors between this design
and the linear ns-FFAG lattice, the same acceleration rate is used. Acceleration
is achieved in 1000 turns with an energy gain of 220 kV/turn. This allows a direct
comparison between the results of the different lattice designs. As before, synchrotron
motion is neglected as only the transverse dynamics are of interest here and the
cavities are represented as zero-length elements providing a simple energy gain.
The amplification factors (as in Eqn. 2.21) are obtained by fitting straight lines to
the mean of the distributions shown in Fig. 3.18 and the error on the amplification
factor corresponds to the difference between the maximum/minimum linear fit and the
central fit. The errors are relatively large as the main contribution to the distortion
is the difference between the closed orbits of the error-free lattice and the misaligned
lattice, rather than the distortion of the single particle orbit.
The amplification factor in the horizontal direction with acceleration is 5.813.95,
and in the vertical direction is 9.47 5.13. The alignment tolerances in this machine
are considerably more relaxed than in the case of the linear ns-FFAG design in Chap-
ter 2, where the equivalent amplification factors were 336  104 in the horizontal

direction and 293  136 in the vertical direction. These results indicate that for an
allowed orbit distortion of  1 mm, the alignment tolerances must be better than
around 100m. This tolerance level has been routinely achieved in other accelera-
tors [90].
Distortion near an integer resonance
To check if distortion also arises in this lattice when the total horizontal tune is near
to an integer, the varying distortion with total horizontal tune is studied.
To begin with, the field index k and ratio between the D and F magnet strengths
are systematically varied by up to 10% in either direction. At each value of k and
D/F the closed orbit is found by minimising the phase space area with single particle
tracking and the tune is calculated from multi-particle tracking. A set of lattice
configurations is then established in which the total horizontal tune varies smoothly
between 8.7 and 9.3 at the injection energy, while the vertical tune remains fixed.
For each configuration a random Gaussian distribution of horizontal alignment
errors is applied to the lattice magnets, with a standard deviation of 50 m. A single
particle is then tracked through 10 turns without acceleration at each tune value and
the maximum distortion calculated as before. This is done 10 times for each tune
value and the resulting mean is shown with error bars representing the RMS of the
10 trials. There is a clear increase in the distortion when the tune nears the integer,
as shown in Fig. 3.19. This shows that as expected, the tune in this lattice must be
kept away from an integer in order to avoid unnecessary orbit distortion.
Multi-particle tracking with alignment errors
Tracking through the full acceleration cycle of the proton lattice was undertaken to
show that a realistic emittance beam should emerge from the proton ring with no
significant distortion. Horizontal alignment errors were applied to each magnet in the

lattice. The applied errors are Gaussian distributed with a 50m standard deviation
and a cut-off at 3. Thirty-six particles on a 10mm mrad emittance ellipse were
tracked from 30.95 MeV to 250 MeV in 1000 turns and the emittance re-calculated
turn-by-turn. Initial ellipse parameters (Twiss parameters) were determined from
multi-particle tracking through a single cell.
The emittance stays constant at 10mm mrad throughout acceleration, as shown
in Fig. 3.20. The small ripples at the start of tracking are due to the slight inaccuracy
in determining the centre of the closed orbit and Twiss parameters when alignment
errors are included. This demonstrates that the proton lattice design is suitable for
the acceleration of beams for CPT with little or no emittance increase throughout
acceleration.
3.3.2 Dynamic aperture
The dynamic aperture of this lattice was calculated for the case of rectangular magnets
with parallel alignment. The procedure for establishing the dynamic aperture was
developed by D. Kelliher, as a co-author of Ref. [85]. The results presented here use
the same method but have been re-calculated.
The calculation covers a cell tune range of 0.7 - 0.75 and 0.25 - 0.30 in the horizon-

tal plane and vertical plane respectively. In each scan, the tune in just one transverse
plane is varied while in the other transverse plane it is fixed at the nominal value
in Table 3.7. The calculation is made at injection energy to study the case where
the beam is at its largest size in physical space. An error-free lattice is assumed and
multipole components up to decapole from a polynomial fit to ideal field strength are
included. To select a particular value in the tune space, the field index k (and hence
the coefficients of each multipole term) and the ratio of the F and D strength are
adjusted.
The search for dynamic aperture begins by tracking a single particle over 1000
turns. The particle has identical starting conditions in both planes. In each case
the initial coordinate is given by 
2J/x,y and the initial angle is zero. J is the
action variable and x,y is the horizontal or vertical Twiss parameter. The tracking
is started at 2J = 1 mm mrad normalised amplitude and then increased in steps of
1mm mrad until the particle is lost. The dynamic aperture is given by the highest
amplitude particle that survives tracking.
It is clear from the results shown in Fig. 3.21 that it is possible to choose a point in
the tune space where the dynamic aperture is more than 50mm mrad normalised in
both transverse planes, which is sufficient for the application of CPT. One of the local
3.4. Summary of proton lattice design
minima in the dynamic aperture results in Fig. 3.21 can be attributed to a coupling
between the transverse planes. Since there is no skew quadrupole component present
a second order resonance at x + y = 1 is discounted. Instead the observed coupling
is attributed to the octupole term driving a fourth order resonance at 2x + 2y = 2.

3.4 Summary of proton lattice design
The PAMELA proton lattice design successfully reduces orbit excursion and simplifies
magnet design, construction and alignment issues when compared to a scaling FFAG.
Both the horizontal and vertical betatron tunes are constrained to within half an
integer, avoiding resonance crossing. Furthermore, a study of sensitivity to alignment
errors indicates that the design is feasible in terms of alignment tolerances. The
design also provides adequate dynamic aperture for the application of CPT.
The PAMELA design requires both protons and carbon at full treatment energy
and for this purpose the design outlined here needs to be scaled up to a second ring
which can provide C6+ ions at 400 or even up to 430 MeV/u. This will be explored
3.4. Summary of proton lattice design
in the next chapter.
Chapter 4
Lattice solution for carbon ions
There is a growing body of clinical evidence that fully stripped carbon ions (C6+)
are a more effective ion species for charged particle therapy for some radio-resistant
tumours due to their higher cell-killing power compared to protons [91]. As such,
the ability to provide full treatment energy C6+ ions is an integral feature of next-
generation CPT accelerators like PAMELA. This chapter describes the application
of the design principles outlined in Chapter 3 to the second ring of the PAMELA
complex, the carbon ring.
Ideally the lattice for the carbon ring should follow the same concept as the smaller
proton lattice, but poses an even greater challenge as the charge to mass ratio of C6+ is
only half that of protons. This leads to a higher required energy and higher magnetic
rigidity of the particles. The highest rigidity reached by C6+ ions at 400 MeV/u
is 6.370 Tm; more than double the 2.432 Tm of full energy protons, as outlined in
Table 3.1. Nonetheless the ring radius should be much less than double the radius of
the proton machine, while maintaining long straight sections for injection/extraction
and realistic magnet designs.
Initial considerations and constraints on the lattice are given and each parameter
is studied in terms of the geometric effects of scaling up the design. After establishing
4.1. Scaling up the lattice design
a suitable region in the parameter space, the design is then further developed and
optimised. The resulting lattice performance is studied in a similar manner to the
proton lattice.
4.1 Scaling up the lattice design
4.1.1 Basic considerations
The following requirements are imposed on the design of the carbon lattice:
1. Long straight sections of greater than 1.2 m are required in order to fit the RF
system, injection and extraction sections.
2. The total magnetic bore diameter needs to be less than 0.35 m. This is to
minimise the ratio of magnet bore to length, where a practical magnet length
should be less than about 1 m.
3. The peak magnetic field must be less than 4.5 T to ensure that realistic su-
perconducting magnets can be designed. This is in line with experience from
designing the proton lattice.
4. Total tune variation should be less than half an integer in both planes in order
to avoid resonance crossing.
5. The radius of the carbon ring needs to be at least 1.5 m greater than the proton
ring to allow the possibility of concentric rings.
In order to study the feasibility of designing a carbon lattice that meets these
requirements, a scan of the basic parameters is undertaken.
4.1. Scaling up the lattice design
4.1.2 Geometric model and assumptions
As discussed in the design of the proton lattice, a number of parameters can be
adjusted to achieve a realistic lattice design, including the ring radius, field index,
lattice packing factor and number of cells. It is important to understand the effect that
changing each of these parameters has on the peak magnetic field, orbit excursion,
magnet bore size and length of long straight sections. Dynamics and optics are
considered later, in Section 4.2.
During the following parameter scans, two assumptions are made. First, the field
described by the polynomial fit in the lattice magnets is assumed to be close to the
ideal rk law so the particles follow an approximately circular trajectory when inside
the magnets. This is also used by Misu et al. in Ref. [92] where the author assumes a
constant radius of curvature along an equilibrium orbit for each magnet1. Outside
the magnets the particles travel in a straight line. Fringe fields are not considered in
the geometric model but play an important role in dynamics and are included after
the initial baseline parameters are selected.
Second, as the magnets are in an FDF configuration, it can be assumed that each
F magnet needs to provide the total bending required in the cell, as the bending power
of one F will be effectively cancelled by the reverse bending of the D. For example,
each F magnet must be able to provide 30 bending in a 12-cell lattice. Of course,
this also assumes that the F and D magnetic fields are very similar in magnitude
(although opposite in sign). In reality the F and D are likely to differ in magnitude
by around 10%, but making this assumption gives a reasonable indication of the peak
bending field required in the magnets, making it a useful tool at this stage. For this
reason the maximum peak field in the parameter scan is set to 4.0 T, which respects
1The Misu et al. study does not look at the FDF triplet focusing structure and only uses the
first stability region of Hills equation. The model in [92] is not used as the simplified layout of
rectangular magnets on a straight line in the present description allows the described geometric
model to be implemented.

the 4.5 T limit once this 10% difference is taken into account.
A set of basic geometric equations can be defined to describe the changing pa-
rameters in this type of lattice. To begin with, the bending power of a dipole field is
given by Eqn. 4.1, where lmag is the magnet length, B is the magnetic field,  is the
bending radius (so B is the magnetic rigidity) and  is the angle through which the
trajectory is bent, as shown in Fig. 4.1.

(4.3)
The magnet length lmag is defined as in Eqn. 4.2 and the long drift length lLD
in Eqn. 4.3 where r0 and  are the reference radius and packing factor respectively,
as in Chapter 3. The total realistic magnetic length can be extended into the short
straight sections keeping the magnetic centre fixed, in order to reduce the peak field,
giving a total magnetic length of up to 1.8 lmag. This also slightly reduces the long
drift length by 0.8 lmag. The peak magnetic field, Bmax, can then be calculated by
4.1. Scaling up the lattice design
rearranging Eqn. 4.1.
There are two contributions to the total magnetic bore size, the orbit excursion
and a geometric offset. The orbit excursion is defined by the rk scaling law and is the
difference between the radius of the beam trajectory at injection and full extraction
momentum, as in Eqn. 4.4.
rorbit = r0
[(Bextr
(Binj
)1/k]
(4.4)
where Binj and Bextr are the corresponding field strengths from Eqn. 4.1 using the
injection and extraction rigidities of Table 3.1. The geometric offset is the difference
between the radius at which the beam enters or exits a magnet and the maximum
radius of the beam orbit, as shown in Fig. 4.2.
rgeom. = 
42  l2mag (4.5)
Given the first assumption that the trajectory is a sector of a circle, the geometric
offset can be calculated easily using Eqn. 4.5. The total bore diameter (Dbore) is then
simply given by Eqn. 4.6.

4.1.3 Variation of lattice parameters
To determine which potential parameter combinations meet the requirements and
which do not, solutions of the above equations are plotted using MathematicaTM as
regions of suitable lattice configurations, as shown in Fig. 4.3. These calculations are
independent of optics and dynamics of the lattice.

From Fig. 4.3 a selection of suitable lattice parameters can be made in order to
study the variation of magnetic bore size (Dbore), peak field required (Bmax), magnet
length (lmag) and other parameters as a function of each relevant variable. The base
values selected are r0 = 8.5m, k = 42,  = 0.5, ncells = 12. Figs. 4.4 to 4.8 show the
variation of each parameter, where in each case the only changing variable is the one
given on the horizontal axis.
It is clearly shown that while the number of lattice cells does not greatly affect the
required maximum bending field strength, factors such as the ring radius and packing
factor have a much greater impact, as expected. In a similar manner, the main
contribution to the orbit excursion and thus the total magnetic bore size is the field

4.2 Baseline carbon lattice
The process of selection of the baseline parameters for the PAMELA carbon lattice
necessarily involved consultation with magnet and RF designers. Initial discussions
were based on an 8.5 m radius lattice; however high peak fields observed in a prelim-
inary magnet design necessitated an increase in radius. After a number of iterations
a 9.3 m radius was selected to lower the peak current on the superconducting wires
in the magnet design. A description of the principles of the magnet design can be
found in Ref. [93] and these are discussed briefly in Chapter 6.
From the point of view of lattice dynamics this does not make a significant differ-
ence. As the packing factor is increased in the 8.5 m lattice design to allow for longer
magnet lengths and lower peak fields, the two stable regions move away from each
other, as was observed in Section 3.1.1. This is shown in Fig. 4.9, where the green
second stable region becomes separated from the red first stable region with increas-

of 0.65 in Fig. 4.10, the stable regions look very similar and the difference between
the  functions in the first and second stable regions will be comparable to that of
the 8.5 m lattice.
The optimisation procedure in Section 4.3 is carried out for the 9.3 m carbon lattice
design, as this was deemed the most likely feasible solution. For this configuration,
the lattice parameters are outlined in Table 4.1.

4.3 Optimisation
The optimisation follows the same method used for the proton lattice and begins
by calculating the positions of particle orbits throughout acceleration in a perfectly
scaling version of the FFAG. The non-scaling version then takes the middle point of
the orbit excursion within each magnet as the central point of the polynomial fit, in
order to achieve the best possible fit of the multipole coefficients to Eqn. 2.15 in the
region of magnetic field that the beam experiences. Outside the region that the beam
traverses, the magnetic field is allowed to be different from Eqn. 2.15. In Cartesian
co-ordinates the expansion of the field takes the form of Eqn. 4.7, where x0 is used
instead of r0 of Eqn. 2.15, the distance from the centre of the machine to the centre

acceleration is shown in Fig. 4.12. The total change in orbit position between the
lowest and highest energy orbits is 21.7 cm for the energy range required. A larger
energy range is achievable with the same lattice design, for example an energy range
of 50 to 430 MeV/u is possible with a total orbit excursion of 23.7 cm. The final
choice of energy range will depend on both clinical considerations and the magnet
and RF designs, as the aperture of these components will determine the allowed orbit
excursion.

Dynamic aperture
The dynamic aperture is calculated using the method outlined in Section 3.3.2 at the
injection energy (68.36 MeV/u) for a range of horizontal and vertical tunes, deter-
mined by changing the k value and ratio between the F and D strengths. The opti-
mised carbon lattice using a polynomial fit up to decapole is assumed with no align-
ment errors present. Single particles are tracked over 1000 turns, starting with the
same normalised amplitude in both horizontal and vertical planes. The amplitude is
then increased until the particle is lost, and the dynamic aperture plotted next to each
point in Fig. 4.14 is the highest amplitude surviving particle in units of mm mrad
normalised. In this case the dynamic aperture is greater than 50mm mrad for most
tune values, which is sufficient for this application.

4.5 Summary of carbon lattice design
The carbon lattice design has successfully scaled up the non-linear ns-FFAG idea
from the proton lattice, varying the lattice parameters in order to adapt the design
4.5. Summary of carbon lattice design
to the more challenging specification. Despite the changes in lattice parameters, the
betatron tunes remain constrained to within half an integer and the orbit excursion
remains small. In fact, the lattice is able to operate over a larger energy range than
initially conceived, a potential advantage if the engineering design of the main RF,
magnet and injection/extraction systems can accommodate the slightly increased
aperture that this would require. The dynamic aperture remains sufficient for the
application.
There remain challenges in the engineering design of the major components. On-
going work on these components is discussed in Chapter 6.
The next stage in the design of PAMELA is an important one; to make sure that
the real beam dynamics in a ns-FFAG are close to those produced by the simulation
code2. For this reason Chapter 5 focuses on EMMA (Electron Model of Many Ap-
plications), the worlds first ns-FFAG and results obtained during the initial beam
commissioning of this machine.
2Further verification of the lattice design is also considered by tracking accurate 3D field maps
from realistic magnet designs, which is discussed in Chapter 6.
Chapter 5
The EMMA experiment
The CONFORM project, of which PAMELA is one of three branches, aims to demon-
strate the feasability of ns-FFAG technology. A crucial part of this programme is the
design and construction of the first ns-FFAG accelerator, the Electron Model of Many
Applications (EMMA). Originally, the construction of EMMA was scheduled to be
completed toward the end of 2009 [94]. However, it became clear in late 2009 that the
original construction schedule would not be met and that waiting for the full EMMA
ring to be finished was likely to cause a significant delay in the completion of this
thesis.
As a result, it was proposed to begin commissioning of EMMA with an incomplete
ring: the four sector commissioning described in this chapter. This proposal was
adopted by the EMMA collaboration with enthusiasm and leadership of the task was
granted to the author. The planning, experimental work and methods for this stage of
commissioning were developed by the author in collaboration with the commissioning
work package leader.
Rather than delay the completion of the full EMMA ring, this experimental work
was undertaken in parallel with construction during successive 8-hour shifts. This
early stage of commissioning has proven to be extremely valuable, particularly in
5.1. Overview of EMMA
terms of establishing an accurate beam injection setup and in understanding the
operation of EMMA. This has made a substantial impact in the commissioning of the
full EMMA ring. In fact, when the full ring was completed it took less than a month
for a number of key commissioning milestones to be met, discussed in Section 5.5.
The main aim of this chapter is to connect the commissioning of EMMA with the
design of PAMELA through the comparison of experimental results with the ZGOUBI
simulation code, used in the design of both.
5.1 Overview of EMMA
EMMA is an interesting accelerator project as it is the first ns-FFAG ever to be
constructed. It is located at the STFC Daresbury Laboratory in the UK and com-
missioning activities began in June 2010. A brief overview is given here to provide
a background to the experimental measurements presented in this chapter. More
complete descriptions of EMMA can be found in [94, 95, 96, 97].
The EMMA accelerator has been built as a proof-of-principle demonstrator for
ns-FFAG technology. The project aims to demonstrate feasibility of ns-FFAGs and
to study the novel beam dynamics of these machines in detail. The availability of the
partial EMMA ring in the initial stages of commissioning allowed measurements to
be made which are relevant to PAMELA as they contribute to the validation of the
ZGOUBI simulation code. This code was used both for the EMMA design and the
EMMA on-line model1, and has been used extensively in the design of PAMELA. The
results of the relevant commissioning experiments are presented and their implications
discussed.
1The on-line model is a graphical user interface under development which will be available in the
control room to enable operators to simulate the accelerator at the same time as operating the real
machine [98].
5.1. Overview of EMMA
5.1.1 EMMA - the Electron Model of Many Applications
Three main features differentiate EMMA from the non-linear ns-FFAG designs in the
two previous chapters. The first is that EMMA accelerates electrons, rather than pro-
tons or ions, from 10 to 20 MeV, which means that the electrons are ultra-relativistic.
Second, it is a linear type of non-scaling FFAG, composed only of quadrupole mag-
nets with a radial offset to provide the dipole bending field. In this respect it is
quite similar to the linear ns-FFAG lattice discussed in Chapter 2. The third main
difference is that EMMA has extremely rapid acceleration; it will accelerate electrons
from 10  20 MeV in tens, rather than thousands of turns. This rapid acceleration
appears to be fast enough to avoid beam deterioration due to resonance crossing [63].
In fact, the acceleration itself is a novel serpentine acceleration scheme, a description
of which can be found in Ref. [99].
Figure 5.1: 3D schematic of the EMMA ring including injection line (top left) and
diagnostic beamline (bottom right).
The main EMMA parameters are given in Table 5.1 and a 3D schematic of the
machine is shown in Fig. 5.1. The layout of EMMA with its injector, ALICE (Acceler-
5.2. Experimental method
ators and Lasers In Combined Experiments) is shown in Fig. 5.2. ALICE is an exist-
ing facility which consists of a 35 MeV electron energy recovery linac prototype [100].
During EMMA operation the two linac sections of ALICE (the booster linac and main
linac) are used to provide appropriate beams for the 10 to 20 MeV energy range of
EMMA. The electron beam is diverted out of ALICE to the EMMA injection line and
so ALICE does not run in energy recovery mode during EMMA operation. Details
of ALICE and its setup for EMMA can be found in Refs. [101, 102, 103].

In preparation for EMMA, a number of methods were developed into high-level
software specific to non-scaling FFAGs including measurement of the phase space and
aperture scanning algorithms. These methods differ from those of synchrotrons due
to the shifting orbit in non-scaling FFAGs and are also applicable to PAMELA. They
are described in Appendix A.
5.2 Experimental method
EMMA consists of 42 cells which are physically organised into seven sectors, with six
cells in each sector as seen in Fig. 5.3. For the experimental work outlined in this
chapter, only four of the seven sectors of EMMA were used, as discussed earlier.
5.2. Experimental method

5.2.1 Four sector setup
The naming convention and layout of cells, diagnostics and other components is shown
in Fig. 5.4 and will be used hereafter to refer to EMMA components. In the four
sectors there is one YAG screen in Cell 5 and one in Cell 23, the details of which can
be found in Ref. [104]. There are a large number of beam position monitors (BPMs)
installed, with either two or three BPMs per cell.
Figure 5.3: One of seven EMMA sectors comprising six DF magnet doublet cells.
In planning the experimental commissioning work the decision was made to keep
the beam energy of the ALICE injector constant and to represent different relative
momenta by changing the EMMA quadrupole strengths while maintaining the ratio
between the D and F quadrupoles (the D/F ratio). This means that to reproduce
the dynamics of a relative momentum of +5% the main quadrupole magnet strengths
have to be changed by 5%2.
2This change is not immediately obvious. As B  pc, usually for constant B (in a fixed field
accelerator) pc is increased and the bending radius  increases proprtionally. In this case we keep
pc constant but want to mimic the increase in , hence B is reduced.

5.2. Experimental method
5.2.2 Beam position monitors
The EMMA ring is heavily instrumented with diagnostic devices as it is an experi-
mental machine with novel beam dynamics that need to be studied in detail. The full
EMMA Beam Position Monitor (BPM) system consists of 81 button BPMs. Each
BPM includes a button electrode pickup and a pair of front-end modules connected
via a single low loss cable 40 m in length to a VME module3, where the pickup signals
are measured using analog to digital converters (ADCs) [105]. Further information
about this system can be found in Refs. [106, 107].
During the initial commissioning process the electronic BPM readout system was
not yet available. To read positions from the installed BPMs, seven coaxial cables
were available which were connected directly from the BPMs to the control room
where the analog signals were monitored using a Tektronix TDS6124C oscilloscope.
For each BPM, the left-right signals are multiplexed onto the same cable with a set
time delay, which is one of the main functions of the front-end module [105]. This
means that the horizontal position can be read from a single cable, and similarly for
the top-bottom signals for the vertical position. The oscilloscope was used to read
out the raw voltage signals from the BPMs and beam positions were calculated from
these raw values using a pre-measured calibration algorithm [108]. An example of the
traces of three left-right BPMs is shown in Fig. 5.5.
With a total of just seven coaxial cables the amount of data taken was limited
during this period, as each cable can only supply either a horizontal or vertical po-
sition. In other words, only three BPMs with both horizontal and vertical positions
and one with either horizontal or vertical position can be connected at any one time.
A machine shut down is required in order to change which BPMs are connected, so
such changes are minimised during the commissioning shifts.
During the measurements in Section 5.4 only horizontal BPMs were connected to
3Versa Module Europa (VME)
5.2. Experimental method

the same cable for each BPM. Each coloured trace clearly shows two signals (left and
right) with a difference in amplitude - this difference gives the horizontal position.
give the maximum of 7 horizontal positions simultaneously. The vertical offset prior
to the injection septum was minimised using the vertical correctors in the injection
line, though only to within a few mm.
5.2.3 Dispersion measurement
To measure the dispersion, repeated measurements of the beam orbit are taken while
varying the relative momentum of the beam. The dispersion is then calculated by
rearranging Eqn. 2.10, as:
D(p, s) = x(s)
. (5.1)
For this measurement the horizontal readouts of the BPMs situated between the
D and F magnets in cells E12 to E18 are connected. The measurement is made well
after the septum and kickers to allow the betatron oscillations to become roughly
constant in amplitude.
5.2. Experimental method
5.2.4 Tune measurement
The measurement of the betatron tune in a ns-FFAG is a challenge, particularly
with an incomplete ring. The lack of a reference closed orbit to compare particle
positions against means that an assumption has to be made about where the centre
of the betatron oscillations ought to lie. In most cases, the mean of the measured
particle positions is sufficient. In practice this may introduce problems if the beam
has large oscillations or is clipped due to beam loss which could skew the position
measurements. This is a problem specific to this type of machine as the beam is
designed to be off-centre in the beam pipe and this off-centre position changes with
energy. Measurements may be improved by minimising betatron oscillations to avoid
beam loss.
An additional challenge in measuring the tune with only four sectors of EMMA
is the small number of BPM readings available. Fourier analysis relies on a large
number of BPM readings so is not reliable in this instance. The method adopted is
a least squares fit to a sine wave.
In this method, it is assumed that the data points follow a curve of the form:
f(s) = A.sin(
2xs
lcell
+ ) + x (5.2)
where lcell is the design cell length
4 (394.5 mm). The remaining four variables, A,
the amplitude of the oscillations, x the horizontal cell tune,  the phase and the
horizontal offset of the orbit from the centre of the BPMs, x, are all used as free
parameters to make the least squares fit.
4It is assumed in the tune measurements that the real distance between the BPMs is the same
as the design cell length.
5.3. ZGOUBI simulations and expected results
5.3 ZGOUBI simulations and expected results
5.3.1 The ZGOUBI code
The ZGOUBI simulation code has existed since 1972 [109], having undergone major
development in the 1990s to make it into a more generalised ray-tracing code. It
computes the trajectories of an arbitrary number of charged particles through both
electric and magnetic fields. ZGOUBI comes equipped with analytical models of
many different types of elements, both magnetic and electric, while allowing for the
use of both 2D and 3D field maps in Cartesian or cylindrical co-ordinates. It can
accommodate acceleration and tracking simultaneously, as well as calculating syn-
chrotron radiation, spin and in-flight decay processes, although the latter three are
not utilised here. Importantly, this is not a new simulation code and has been used
for accelerator and spectrometer design for many years. It is one of only a few codes
which can accurately simulate FFAGs and has been upgraded for this purpose [110].
5.3.2 Simulating the EMMA experiments
EMMA has been simulated using ZGOUBI with a hard-edge magnet model. The
geometry considered is the baseline lattice, which corresponds to one of eight dif-
ferent lattice configurations proposed as part of the EMMA experiment [111]. The
lattice parameters used in this instance (additional to those in Table 5.1) are given
in Table 5.2.
The ZGOUBI element chosen in this case is the QUADRUPO element, which
represents a basic quadrupole with optional fringe fields, described in detail in Ref. [75,
p.110]. To ascertain the tunes and dispersion which ought to be observed during the
EMMA four sector commissioning, closed orbits were found by locating the centre
of the minimised phase space ellipse with multi-turn single particle tracking. These
closed orbit positions are plotted relative to a small change in momentum in Fig. 5.6.

In the small momentum range being considered, the dispersion can be approximated
as linear in order to make a comparison with the experimental data. The dispersion
is estimated by the gradient of a least-squares linear fit, the result of which is D(s) =
53.9  0.52 mm. The betatron tunes were also calculated at each momentum step,
shown in Fig. 5.7. These results provide a point of comparison with the experimental
data obtained in the next section.

It should be noted that this was only the second time that beam had been taken
all the way through the four sectors of EMMA. On the first occasion (in June 2010)
it was observed that the measured position and angle of the beam emerging from
the septum were not as expected. A substantial amount of effort was dedicated to
mapping the transport properties of the injection line and septum region in order to
improve the injection scenario. The measurements presented here were taken after
this work was completed. Full optics matching and optimisation of the injection
scenario will be undertaken when the whole EMMA ring is available.
5.4. Experimental results
5.4.1 Horizontal particle positions
Horizontal particle positions in cells E12 to E18 were measured three times, changing
the strength of the injection septum and kicker timing in each instance to try to
optimise the injection scenario and minimise betatron oscillations. This was done
starting at nominal D/F strengths which mimic a momentum of 18.5 MeV/c and was
then repeated for different relative momenta. The settings for each run are given in
Table 5.4, where K1 and K2 are the first and second kicker delay timings and QD/QF
are the D and F quadrupoles of the main ring. The measured positions for relative
momenta of 0.9, 0.95, 1.0 and 1.05 are shown in Figs. 5.8 and 5.9. The error bars
shown on each point are an estimated measurement error, determined from repeated
measurements of the beam position in a single BPM, which change slightly each time
due to beam fluctuations and small errors in reading the oscilloscope traces. The
error was taken as the RMS value of these repeated measurements and includes the
error on the alignment of the BPMs, which is known to within 250m [108].

5.4.2 Dispersion measurement
Using the position data obtained in the previous section, the centre of the orbit is
approximated by taking the mean of the 7 horizontal beam position readings. The
dispersion is then found by making a linear fit to the mean positions with relative
momentum, as shown in Fig. 5.10. The measured mean dispersion in this momentum
range is D(p) = 42.01 12.1 mm, compared to D(p) = 53.9 0.52 mm obtained from
the earlier simulation. The error on this measurement is calculated as the difference
between the best fit and the maximum/minimum linear fits which remain within the
error bars of the data points.

5.4.3 Horizontal tune measurement
The measured horizontal cell tunes are shown with the simulated tune values in
Fig. 5.11. Given the difficulty of measuring the tune in this scenario, the agreement
with simulation for the two higher momenta is remarkable. However, the two lower
momentum values differ significantly from the expected tunes.
5.5. Commissioning of the full EMMA ring
During the measurements at lower momenta there appears to have been significant
beam loss occurring upstream of the BPMs. Although there is no beam loss monitor to
verify this hypothesis, there was a reduction in the amplitude of the raw BPM signals
observed. Further information can be gained by looking at the sinusoidal fit to the
BPM data points, shown in Fig. 5.12. It is clear that the sinusoidal fit to the data
points in Fig. 5.12b for p = 1.0 p0 is far superior to that in Fig. 5.12a for p = 0.9 p0.
Beam loss upstream of the BPMs or in the 7 cells in which these measurements were
taken would result in a non-uniform and mis-shapen bunch which could give false or
misleading position measurements. As the tune measurement relies on the frequency
component of these position measurements, the tune measurements at lower momenta
cannot be considered to be reliable.

The involvement of the author in EMMA commissioning effectively ended after the
four sector experiments took place. Since this time, the full ring has been completed
and work has continued to progress rapidly in the commissioning of EMMA. The
first beam was steered around the full ring on August 16th 2010 and over 1000 turns
were achieved shortly after this. Fig. 5.13 shows the oscilloscope readings of BPMs

On August 30th, further measurements were made of the beam position with
varying momenta which are suitable for comparison with the results presented earlier
in this chapter. The same central momentum of 18.5 MeV/c was used and the BPMs
in cells E12 to E18 were measured, this time for two turns in the EMMA accelerator
with the RF system off. The same method as before was used both for taking the
measurements and to find the horizontal betatron tunes.
5.5.1 Full ring experimental results
The measured horizontal cell tunes using the full EMMA ring over two turns are
shown in Fig. 5.14. The tunes measured in this case agree with the ZGOUBI sim-
ulation presented earlier and seem to resolve the ambiguity of the low momentum
tunes in Fig. 5.11. A detailed comparison of codes for EMMA has been undertaken
previously [112]. The predicted tunes using a second simulation code called the
Polymorphic Tracking Code (PTC) [113] from the code comparison are included for
reference.

5.6 Discussion of experimental results
The results presented here indicate that, for the most part, the simulated and ex-
perimental data for EMMA agree within error. The original low momentum tunes
are considered to be unreliable, but later measurements show that the predicted and
measured values are in good agreement. This work has been undertaken without the
use of the electronic BPM readout system and further clarification of the tunes will
be possible once this system is available. Further EMMA commissioning should also
clarify the tunes as a function of momentum over the full momentum range and more
precisely determine the extent of the agreement between the ZGOUBI model and the
real machine.
With regards to PAMELA, this indicates that a reasonable degree of confidence
can be placed in the ZGOUBI code and that in practice the results should not differ
dramatically from the model.
Chapter 6
The PAMELA CPT facility
For completeness a brief discussion of the main components in the PAMELA facility
is given in this chapter. Although this is not the main focus of this thesis, each of
the components of the PAMELA facility needs to be studied in detail in order for the
project to proceed from conceptual design to engineering design. Different members
of the PAMELA collaboration have been involved in developing ideas for the various
components. References to the most recent publications or conference proceedings
are given for those items which are not the work of this author.
Designs for the main magnets of the two PAMELA accelerating rings are advanced,
and conceptual designs exist for the low energy transport, RF cavities, injection and
extraction septa and kickers and a possible FFAG gantry. It is shown that each of
the components is able to integrate with the lattice designs developed in Chapters 3
and 4.
The main magnet designs are of considerable interest to this work, as they must
be able to realise the multipolar fields required to obtain stable betatron tunes. The
results of multi-particle tracking through detailed 3D field maps and their implications
for the full engineering design and realisation of the PAMELA ns-FFAG are presented.

A 3D schematic of what the PAMELA facility might look like is in Fig. 6.1. On the

the two concentric accelerating rings are in the centre of the figure. The extraction
lines, transport lines and treatment gantry are not shown here.

6.1.2 Ion sources and low energy transport
The injection system for PAMELA must provide both protons and C6+ ions with
identical magnetic rigidity for injection into the proton ring. For protons, the system
consists of an off the shelf 30-31 MeV cyclotron such as the IBA Cylone 30 R [115].
For carbon, the injection system is expected to consist of a C4+ electron cyclotron

resonance (ECR) ion source providing 810 keV/u C4+ beams, such as that presented
in Ref. [116]. The emerging beam contains C4+ mixed with C3+ and C5+ so must
be separated using a spectrometer dipole and aperture. This is followed by a radio
frequency quadrupole (RFQ) to accelerate to 400 keV/u [117] and a short linac to
boost to 8 MeV/u. The linac is followed by a stripping foil to achieve fully stripped
ions.
A basic layout of the system as presented in Ref. [3] is shown in Fig. 6.2. It is
envisaged that to reduce the overall footprint of the accelerator complex, this could be
placed inside the proton ring. The exact layout would depend on the space available
in a proposed facility. The integration of this system with the accelerating rings is
expected to be straightforward.

6.1.3 Magnets
The main lattice magnets have been developed to produce the complex multipolar
field required by the lattice design. The design concept depends on the well-known
cosine-theta current distribution of Eqn. 6.1 in which Jz is the current density in
the direction tangential to the beam,  is the azimuthal angle and m is the order of
multipole (m = 1 for dipole, m = 2 for quadrupole, m = 3 for sextupole etc...).
6.1. Design of the PAMELA facility
Jz() = J0cos(m). (6.1)
Theoretically it is possible to create any number of multipoles using a single coil.
In this case individual multipole coils were adopted in a layered technique to ensure
good flexibility in tuning the lattice. Due to the large bore-to-length ratio a tilted
solenoid or double helix design is used, as described originally in Ref. [118] and more
recently in Ref. [119]. This is shown for a dipole coil in Fig. 6.3.
Figure 6.3: 3D image of a double helix dipole coil [3].
The coils are a superconducting air core design using standard NbTi supercon-
ducting wire, and will be placed in a warm-bore 4 K liquid helium cryostat.
Due to the complexity of the field produced by the main lattice magnets, it is
important to show that it is possible to track through accurate 3D field maps of the
magnet design and produce stable betatron tunes which reflect those produced by the
ZGOUBI model.
A number of properties of the 3D field maps could be different from the ZGOUBI
analytical model. The magnets will have a long fringe field extent due to the large air
core and the exact shape and length of these fringe fields is unknown. Additionally,
in the double helix magnet design the presence of small field components in the
6.1. Design of the PAMELA facility
horizontal and longitudinal directions are observed. Tracking using 3D field maps is
the only way to ascertain whether or not these field components are problematic.
To produce the 3D field maps a generator written in MATLABTM [120] was
used to create 3D field maps for the proton lattice, using a simplified model of the
magnet design [121]. These maps were then tracked using the TOSCA element in
ZGOUBI, which makes a second order polynomial interpolation between the points
of the map [75, p.115].
With single particle tracking at the proton lattice reference energy (118 MeV) it
was found that the unwanted horizontal and longitudinal field components in the
double helix magnet design perturb the beam and no stable closed orbit or stable
tunes could be found. An approximate closed orbit was established by minimising
the phase space area of single particle tracking through a small number of turns and
the position of the vertical closed orbit was assumed to be y = 0. A single particle
was then tracked until it was lost, shown in Fig. 6.4. Note that in Figs. 6.4 and 6.7
there is a change of reference frame between each cell so the trajectories appear on a
straight line, this causes the apparent discontinuity at approximately x = 0.10 m.
The horizontal and longitudinal field components can perturb the beam in the
vertical plane. This perturbation will also affect the horizontal motion due to the
higher order multipole fields. The fields experienced by the particle in the above
tracking example are shown in Fig. 6.5. While the horizontal (Fig. 6.5b) and lon-
gitudinal (Fig. 6.5c) fields are much lower than the vertical field (Fig. 6.5a) for the
first few turns they are not negligible and appear to be the cause of the instability
observed in the particle tracking.
This indicates that simple double helix coils may not be suitable for this applica-
tion. To overcome this issue, the horizontal and longitudinal field components were
removed by using a novel helical coil system.

Tracking through helical coil magnets
The coil system was developed to remove the horizontal and longitudinal field com-
ponents and the design has been patented [122]. An example of a PAMELA proton
ring coil is shown in Fig. 6.6. This design provides an extra degree of freedom which
has enabled the magnet designer to cancel the unwanted field components.
Figure 6.6: 3D image of the coil concept for the PAMELA proton ring [114].
Tracking through the coil field maps was performed using single particle tracking
as before. In this case stable closed orbits and tunes were obtained, which indicates
that the unwanted field components in the double helix case were indeed problematic.
The horizontal motion of a single particle tracked at the reference energy of the proton
ring in the 3D field maps is shown in Fig. 6.7. The vertical motion in this case is
negligible.
Betatron tunes from 3D field map tracking
Initial tracking results of the 3D field maps for the proton lattice produced stable be-
tatron tunes. However, the design produced tunes which were significantly different
from those expected from the optimisation procedure and tracking studies of Chap-
ter 3. Fig. 6.8 shows the tunes as previously given in Chapter 3 together with the
initial tunes calculated from tracking of the 3D field maps. After manually changing
the ratio of the individual multipole components, a solution was found which produces

tunes which are stable throughout the momentum range of the machine and are con-
strained to within half an integer of total tune. These are shown in Fig. 6.9 [121].
The solution presented here has different tunes from the optimised design with
ZGOUBI. The discrepancy between the ZGOUBI model and the 3D field maps is
believed to arise from the shape of the fringe fields of the helical coils and is not well
understood. This is an item of further work which should be looked at in detail.
However, this shows that it is possible to achieve tunes which are constrained to
within half an integer in a realistic 3D magnet design.
6.1.4 Radiofrequency (RF) cavities
The RF system for the proton ring has been developed to fit in the 1.2 m long straight
sections provided in the lattice while having sufficient aperture to accommodate the
orbit shift with acceleration and having the ability to maintain the very high 1 kHz
repetition rate. The cavities are two-gap ferrite-loaded RF cavities, although other
options including induction cavities and broadband Magnetic Alloy (MA) cavities
were considered. Induction cavities were found not to be suitable as the low beam
current of PAMELA means that their advantages in terms of low impedance are not
utilised. MA cavities were not pursued further due to concerns over high RF power

requirements and cooling at 1 kHz operation. These issues are discussed further in
Ref. [123].
The cavities must provide an energy gain of around 100 keV/turn to achieve the
1 kHz repetition rate and there is space for a maximum of 8 cavities in the 12 cell
lattice. The current design is similar to that of the ISIS second harmonic RF cavi-
ties [124] shown in Fig. 6.10. The main parameters of both the proton and carbon
ring cavities are given in Table 6.1. To make sure that the ferrite rings are able to
reach the required acceleration and repetition rate a small sample of the ferrite ma-
terial (Ferroxcube4D2) [125] has been tested experimentally. The main purpose of
these experiments was to see if the Q value of the ferrite is affected by high frequency
modulation operation. At this stage, results suggest that this material should be
suitable for the PAMELA RF system [126]. To date most of the work on the RF
system has focused on the proton ring. The RF cavity design for the carbon ring is
less advanced, but is based on the same principles.

6.1.5 Injection and extraction system
The injection and extraction systems for PAMELA will be very similar to each other,
with injection systems simply being scaled down by the ratio of the magnetic rigidity
from injection to extraction. For each ring the injection scenario is simpler than
extraction, primarily because for each ring injection occurs at a single energy. The
extraction system for both rings is more difficult to design and is discussed here.
One of the key features of PAMELA is its ability to provide a variable extraction
energy, however this is also one of its greatest challenges. A kicker and septum
fast extraction system is envisaged, with the kicker and septum being installed in
successive long straight sections within the lattice.
With an orbit excursion in the proton ring of around 18 cm and an even larger ex-
cursion in the carbon ring, the extraction kickers must have a very large aperture. To
ease issues of dispersion at the septum, a vertical extraction system is planned [128].
As the variable energy proton beam would emerge from a pure dipole septum at a
varying position and angle, a novel scheme where the septum has a field gradient
is under development [129], which would result in extracted beams of all energies
emerging with the same angle, but with a dispersion similar to that in the main ring.
This could then be matched into the FFAG transport system, discussed below. The
research and development into the kicker system is ongoing.
6.1. Design of the PAMELA facility
After the extraction system an achromatic dispersion matching section is planned.
It is hoped that this will consist of FFAG optics [130] and thereby allow variable
energy extraction and transport at the maximum repetition rate of 1 kHz.
The extraction system for the carbon ring poses an even greater challenge than
that of the proton ring, by virtue of the larger magnetic rigidity. In this case, the
septum must have a field of around 4 Tm to produce the required bending. A two
septum approach may be needed in this case.
6.1.6 Transfer line between rings
A transfer line is required to take carbon ions at 68.36 MeV/u from the proton ring
and deliver them through an optically matched line into the carbon ring. As injection
and extraction from both rings is likely to be vertical, the transfer line must cancel
both vertical and horizontal dispersion. The low energy C6+ ions from the proton
ring will be extracted at an angle of approximately 30 and the transfer line will need
to approach the carbon ring at an angle which is sufficiently large to avoid the edge
of the magnet cryostat, which is assumed to be 30 also.
A transfer line has been designed which matches the optics of the beam (, ) of
carbon ions from the proton ring to the carbon ring. The layout of this transfer line
is shown in Fig. 6.11, where the yellow magnets bend in the vertical plane, the orange
dipoles bend in the horizontal plane, the red rectangles are focusing quadrupoles (in
the horizontal plane) and blue are defocusing. The beta functions and dispersion in
the transfer line are shown in Fig. 6.12. This design allows the proton ring to be
placed within the carbon ring, without a vertical displacement between the rings1.
The variable energy extraction system and beam transport for protons uses the
same extraction septum as the carbon beam. To accommodate the FFAG optics of
1A vertical displacement has been discussed, as it could ease maintenance access to the inner
ring. This design is able to accommodate a vertical displacement between the rings after adjusting
quadrupole strengths.

the proton transport to the treatment rooms, the transfer line is designed with a long
horizontal drift section soon after extraction from the proton ring. It is envisaged
that the beginning of the proton transport line could be integrated into this drift
space.
6.1.7 Transport line and rotating gantry
Beam transport
After extraction from either the proton or carbon ring, the particles should be trans-
ported through to the treatment rooms where they are used for treatment with either
fixed horizontal or vertical beam lines or through a rotating gantry. An idealised
layout of a transport line from the accelerator to the treatment rooms is shown in
Fig. 6.13.
Given the 1 kHz repetition rate of the accelerator, the transport line and gantry
need to be able to accept beams with rapidly varying energy so should also ideally

consist of fixed field components. The limiting factor in the overall speed of energy
variation will be any components which require physical movement or field variation,
so these should be kept to a minimum.
The conceptual design of a transport line using scaling FFAG magnets is outlined
in Ref. [132]. The transport line has an FDDF configuration such that the beam
trajectory at the entrance and exit of the structure is designed to be perpendicular to
the face of the magnet. This repeated cell structure is 1.6 m in length. The exact total
length of transport needed between the accelerator and treatment rooms is unknown
as it would be different in each facility. However, it has been shown that a 160 m long
transport line using this design (100 cell lengths) has an impressively large acceptance
of over 1000mm mrad.
Dispersion suppressor
An FFAG accelerator or transport line naturally has a change in orbit position with
momentum. To overcome this prior to a rotating gantry, a dispersion suppression
6.1. Design of the PAMELA facility
section is needed. The design of a dispersion suppressor was also outlined in Ref. [132].
The concept of an FFAG dispersion suppressor follows the same basic principles of
the well known missing-dipole dispersion suppression scheme [45, p.124].
In this case, a cell is designed with a 180 phase advance with a field index that is
doubled with respect to the normal cells2. In a straight FFAG section the horizontal
orbit position x of a particle with momentum p0 + p with respect to the reference
orbit x0 can be expressed as:
p0 + p
)1/(k+1)
. (6.2)
As shown in Appendix B of [132], taking the leading term of the above expression,
corresponding to the quadrupole component:
x = x0 +
, (6.3)
indicates that the dispersion is inversely proportional to k/x0, so the dispersion func-
tion and its derivative in the dispersion suppressor cell are half that of the normal
cell. This leads to the approximate cancellation of the dispersion from the normal
cell, so that the dispersion D and its derivative D are both zero after the dispersion
suppressor. As the FFAG magnets have field components higher than quadrupole
the dispersion suppression is not perfect, but it should be possible to constrain the
particle orbits at the end of the transport line to within 0.5 mm in position and 0.025
in angle for the momentum range of the PAMELA proton lattice [133].
2In fact the dispersion suppressor needs a field index that is k2 = 2(k1+1) where k1 is the normal
cell field index and k2 is that of the dispersion suppressor. In this case the field index used is high
enough that this is a negligible difference.
6.1. Design of the PAMELA facility
Rotating gantry
A preliminary design for the rotating gantry is described in [130]. Conceptually, it
consists of sections of FDF triplet cells similar to those of the main lattice design with
triplet dispersion suppressor sections similar to those outlined above. The design is
divided into four sections as shown in Fig. 6.14 with four different cell designs which
effectively reduce the dispersion throughout the gantry. The cell types of the four
sections are outlined in Table 6.2.

6.1.8 Summary of the PAMELA facility design
The ideas outlined in this chapter show that it is possible to convert the lattice
designs presented in this thesis into realistic accelerator components. The majority
of the proton lattice components have been designed in some detail, while the carbon
ring designs are more challenging and work is ongoing for these components. Many
of the designs are advancing rapidly and a full design review of the facility is planned
during October 2010.
Chapter 7
Summary and further work
7.1 Summary
This thesis has described the development of a novel non-linear ns-FFAG for charged
particle therapy from the lattice design through to the individual accelerator compo-
nents.
Initial work on an existing ns-FFAG lattice design, the KST lattice, showed that a
densely-packed linear ns-FFAG is not suitable for this application, as it is not possible
to accelerate quickly enough to overcome the detrimental effects of betatron resonance
crossing. The amplification factor for orbit distortion was found to be 336 104 in
the horizontal plane and 293 136 in the vertical plane. To accelerate protons from
30.95 to 250 MeV in 1000 turns this would require the components to be aligned to
better than 3m, an unrealistic alignment accuracy.
In terms of lattice design, the most plausible solution to overcome this issue was
the addition of higher-order magnetic multipoles to reduce the total tune excursion
to within half an integer and avoid the resonance crossing problem entirely. This idea
led to the development of the novel non-linear ns-FFAG which has formed the major
part of this thesis. Two accelerating rings have been designed, one for protons to
7.1. Summary
250 MeV (and low energy C6+ to 68.36 MeV/u) and the other to further accelerate
C6+ to 400-430 MeV/u.
The first lattice to be developed was for the proton ring. The lattice design concept
started from a scaling FFAG with triplet focusing. The design uses the second stability
region of Hills equation and has a number of key differences from a scaling FFAG
which make it non-scaling. The changes simplify the engineering design and ease
the alignment of the accelerator components, while avoiding resonance crossing and
retaining the small orbit excursion characteristic of ns-FFAGs. The resulting lattice
design is completely new, as is the design strategy, which can be used to apply this
novel concept to accelerators of a wide range of energies.
Detailed studies of this design were undertaken which showed that an alignment
accuracy of 50m will not have a detrimental effect on the beam. The dynamic
aperture for most lattice configurations was found to be greater than 50mm mrad
normalised in both the horizontal and vertical plane and tracking of a 10 mm mrad
normalised emittance beam showed that the lattice is able to tolerate realistic align-
ment errors.
The second accelerating ring presented more of a challenge in terms of lattice
design. A basic parameter scan showed that only a small range of ring radii, lattice
packing factors and field index values could meet the lattice requirements. The opti-
mised solution using the design strategy is for a ring radius of 9.3 m. This is larger
than desired as it is comparable with synchrotrons of a similar energy. It does not
seem possible to reduce the size of this ring as the lattice design incorporates reverse
bending in the FDF triplet configuration. However, the ring is no larger than existing
carbon synchrotrons.
The ability to provide fully stripped carbon ions at a repetition rate of up to
1 kHz is unmatchable with synchrotrons and allows for greater flexibility in treat-
ment planning, as it allows for rapid variation in the transverse and longitudinal
7.2. Further work
planes simultaneously. However, the carbon ring presents a greater challenge in its
engineering design than the proton ring; work on this is ongoing within the PAMELA
collaboration.
The ZGOUBI simulation code was instrumental in the design of both PAMELA
and EMMA. A proposal to commission four out of seven sectors of the EMMA ac-
celerator was adopted by the collaboration and allowed some initial measurements
of the betatron tune and dispersion in a small momentum range to be made. While
faced with experimental challenges due to the lack of electronic BPM instrumentation
and limited beam time, the results from these experiments are encouraging. In the
cases where significant beam loss was not an issue, the measured betatron tunes and
dispersion matched the simulated results within error. Further work in verification of
ZGOUBI using EMMA should be undertaken in the future to clarify this issue.
Finally, it was shown that the lattice design can be translated into realistic con-
cepts for the individual components of the PAMELA facility, though many of the
components require further development. Tracking of detailed 3D field maps of the
magnet design indicated that a magnet solution can be found which recreates the lat-
tice dynamics and avoids resonance crossing. This will need to be further understood
and refined if the design is to progress to construction.
7.2 Further work
While many of the PAMELA components are well advanced, others need significant
work in order to integrate them with the rest of the system. Notably, the designs
for the carbon ring RF system, extraction kicker and septum are undergoing rapid
development. At this stage, the transport line and proton gantry are preliminary and
further work in the scanning system prior to the patient may necessitate changes to
these designs. The carbon gantry also requires a large amount of work to develop the
7.2. Further work
ideas of the proton gantry into a realistic solution for carbon ions.
Further effort is required in the detailed tracking of 3D field maps for both the
proton and carbon ring designs. In particular, an understanding of how the PAMELA
helical coils can produce the prescribed magnetic fields accurately and thereby repro-
duce the expected lattice dynamics is required.
Finally, once all the PAMELA components have been designed (at least concep-
tually), full 6D tracking from injection to extraction and a simulation of the beam
from the ion source to tumour target volume should be undertaken.
Appendix A
High level software development
During the EMMA four sector commissioning period a basic resonance crossing exper-
iment was planned in order to compare the real orbit distortion with that predicted
by ZGOUBI. Unfortunately due to lack of availability of both the BPM system and
RF system, this experiment could not be performed. However, a number of pieces of
high level software were developed which are applicable to a wide variety of tasks on
EMMA and will help to make both commissioning and operation of the full machine
simpler and quicker. This software is specific to FFAGs as it must accommodate a
closed orbit which is both unknown and changes with energy. For this reason it would
be very useful in commissioning a machine like PAMELA, which has a larger orbit
excursion than EMMA.
The main development was a method for scanning the aperture and determining
from this the centroid of the betatron oscillations or closed orbit. An element of the
aperture scanning algorithm was a method for measurement of the position in phase
space, discussed first. Both pieces of software are written in Python and interface
to the real machine using the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System
(EPICS)[134].
A.1. Phase space measurement
A.1 Phase space measurement
To measure a position in phase space, two BPMs with a known drift space between
them are required. There must be no magnetic field present in this drift space so the
particles pass between the two BPMs in a straight line. If the position at the first
BPM is [x1, y1] and at the second BPM a distance d downstream is [x2, y2] then the
phase space angles denoted by [x, y] at the first BPM can simply be calculated as in
Eqn. A.1.
x = tan1
[x2  x1
(A.1)
where the equation for y takes the same form.
This was used in the four sector setup for cells in which 2 BPMs were present at
the start and end of the long drift space. A graphical user interface was developed to
plot this easily in real time, as in Fig. A.1.
Figure A.1: Phase space software interface.
A.2. Aperture scan
The method developed for this piece of software was used throughout the four
sector commissioning period to assist in mapping the transport of the beam through
the end of the injection line and in the first few cells of EMMA. The method was
used without the EPICS connection during this period as the BPM system was not
connected, as discussed previously.
A.2 Aperture scan
The aim of the aperture scan is to establish the injection settings of the accelerator
which result in the beam being transported either to the end of a section (such as the
EMMA four sectors) or through a certain number of turns in a circular accelerator.
It should also plot BPM data in phase space and be able to establish a closed orbit
by minimising the area of oscillations in the phase space1.
The steps of the aperture scan are as follows:
 Set up the scan by selecting which magnets to vary and the range of variation
for the scan. The type of scan (single or multi-turn) can also be selected along
with which BPMs to record data from.
 Run scan and record values of beam position at chosen BPMs together with
magnet settings which result in the successful transport of the beam.
 Calculate phase space positions of the beam by using phase space plotting
method in cells where 2 BPMs exist in a drift section. The phase space can
then be plotted for each successful transport setting. The area and centre of
the phase space can then be calculated and used to identify optimal injection
settings.
1In the EMMA four sector resonance crossing experiment this procedure would also be able to
establish an approximate closed orbit around which the particles oscillate. Knowledge of this orbit
would allow a rough measurement of orbit distortion.
A.2. Aperture scan
The method can be repeated with a finer range to minimise the phase space area
and determine injection settings which bring the beam as close as possible to the
closed orbit. The graphical user interface of the aperture scan software is shown in
Fig. A.2. This software will be tested when the EMMA electronic BPM cards are
on-line.
