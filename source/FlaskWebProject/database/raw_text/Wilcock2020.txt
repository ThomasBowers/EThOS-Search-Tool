Abstract
Active continental rifts occur because of a complex interplay between tectonic and volcanic
processes associated with the incipient creation of a new plate boundary. They have high de-
formation rates associated with large fault systems accommodating the extension, leading to
the potential for high magnitude earthquakes. This extension and the consequential thinning
of the lithosphere leads to adiabatic decompression melting, the rising of magma, and the
formation of volcanoes down the central rift. As a consequence, we have an intrinsic mix-
ture of volcanic and tectonic earthquakes. This leads to swarm type sequences associated
with magma injection and volcanic unrest occurring synchronously with tectonic mainshock-
aftershock sequences. These result in different types of earthquake clustering associated with
events being dependent either on each other, or a common underlying cause. Most popular
current techniques to separate independent events from clustered or causally-related events
have been developed on catalogues for tectonic seismicity. Thus, they are good at identifying
mainshock-aftershock sequences, but commonly fail to identify swarms.
Here, I introduce a new clustering method which uses an automated line plotting saddle-
point (ALPS) algorithm to separate dependent (linked) and independent (background) events,
using a two-dimensional histogram of the inter-event times and the inter-event distances. The
distribution is bimodal with two peaks associated with background and linked seismicity, re-
spectively. ALPS picks the optimum position to divide the two modes. The method is run over
all event pairs rather than restricting ourselves to nearest-neighbours, as in previous work. This
has the advantage of assigning events to their correct cluster or family of related events, even if
there are many overlapping sequences. I first tested the method on two synthetic catalogues,
a mainshock-aftershock sequence catalogue generated by the commonly-applied epidemic-
type aftershock sequence model and a volcano-tectonic catalogue generated by changing the
underlying rate. I then compared the results of the ALPS method with previously published
methods, in this case when the underlying distribution is known. The results show the ALPS
method is the most successful at identifying the cluster families and independent events.
The new method is then applied to a variety of real-world datasets, from southern Cal-
ifornia, New Zealand and Iceland to the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) and to individual volca-
noes within the MER. The method finds cluster families of both swarm type and mainshock-
aftershock type seismicity and identifies cluster metrics that can be used to distinguish be-
tween the two types, including the magnitude of events, the cumulative and daily event rate,
and the derived cluster networks.
ALPS works over a variety of dataset sizes, both in terms of number of events and the time
period covered. It can therefore be just as efficiently applied to large catalogues consisting
of tens of thousands of events and to the small catalogues returned from temporary seismic
network deployments, albeit with increasing uncertainty in analysis for smaller catalogues.
The method has been developed on synthetic catalogues and tested on many locations, so
we have more confidence that it can reliably be used on datasets from a variety of tectonic
settings, characterising both volcanic and tectonic earthquakes. The algorithm is efficient, re-
producible and makes no a priori assumptions, all further advantages over current earthquake
clustering techniques.
The innovations presented in this thesis can, in principle, be used to improve real-time
forecasting of volcanic hazard, by identifying swarms objectively, and by removing interfer-
ence from signals associated with background seismicity. The residual background catalogue
generated may also be used within standard probabilistic hazard assessments, which assume
events are independent.
Layman Summary
Forecasting volcanic eruptions is challenging, however we can use the earthquakes generated
by volcanic processes to help improve forecasting methods. In Ethiopia, there are 65 volca-
noes, and prior to 2016, we did not know when 70% last erupted, or indeed, how they erupted.
The NERC large-grant funded RiftVolc project aims to research more about these volcanoes,
including what their current state of unrest is. As part of this thesis, I am using the earthquakes
which are related to these volcanoes to help understand the processes which are occurring.
However, in Ethiopia, we have volcanoes in close proximity to faults relating to the opening
of the East African rift. Earthquakes can also be generated by slip on these faults and we need
to ensure we are using the earthquakes triggered by volcanic processes to assess the unrest.
In order to separate these earthquakes, we can use earthquake clustering methods.
Typically, most earthquake clustering methods separate earthquakes that have been trig-
gered by other earthquakes (mainshock-aftershock sequences) from earthquakes which are
randomly triggered and independent from one another (background). A couple of cluster-
ing methods separate earthquakes which are related to volcanic processes (swarms) from
the background earthquakes. However, no clustering method can currently separate both
mainshock-aftershock sequences and swarms from the background earthquakes. In this the-
sis, I have developed a new automated clustering method which separates all three from one
another. It takes a catalogue of earthquakes containing information on the latitude, longitude
and time of the earthquake as input, and outputs the earthquakes labelled as part of cluster
families or as background. The cluster families are groups of earthquakes which are related
to another, they may be mainshock-aftershock sequences or they may be swarms. I tested
my method and other current popular techniques against a synthetic earthquake catalogue,
where the cluster families and independent, background earthquakes are known. I found that
my method was the most accurate, with an accuracy of over 90%.
Once the catalogue is separated into cluster families and background earthquakes, the next
stage is to separate the cluster families into mainshock-aftershock sequences and swarms. In
this thesis, I have identified three methods to separate them, the magnitude of the events
through time, the cumulative number of events per day and a graph showing how the earth-
quakes are linked in a network. These are distinct between mainshock-aftershock sequences
and swarms, for example the mainshock-aftershock sequences have one large magnitude event
which is the mainshock. In contrast, swarms have no clear mainshock. We can use these three
characteristics to identify the triggering mechanism of the cluster family, and thus find the
cluster families which are related to volcanic processes.
Using the clustering technique combined with the three metrics, I have characterised the
cluster families in a number of localities globally; Iceland, North Island, New Zealand and
southern California, chosen due to their earthquakes being triggered by both faults and volca-
noes in close proximity, similar to the earthquakes in Ethiopia.
Finally, in Ethiopia, we successfully identified swarms of earthquakes which has helped as-
sess the state of unrest at the volcanoes. An example mechanism for these events is the precip-
itation of minerals blocking the pathways, leading to an increase in pressure and thus fractur-
ing. This work complements other authors work and contributes towards the understanding
of these volcanoes and the processes which are occurring.
Chapter 1
Introduction
Due to increasing economic development, growing populations and urbanisation, earthquakes
represent a significant and growing risk to societies worldwide. Building resilience to this risk
involves evaluating the long-term hazard for building design, usually based on assuming events
in a catalogue of earthquakes are independent. Independent earthquakes are unrelated to
previous earthquakes and can be modelled by a Poisson process (Vere-Jones, 1970; Gardner
and Knopoff, 1974). However, there is also a separate population of dependent or linked, earth-
quakes, which often take the form of clusters of events in both space and time. This may be
through one earthquake triggering another earthquake, such as in mainshock-aftershock se-
quences, or through the earthquakes being triggered by the same underlying process, such
as dyke emplacement. Earth scientists can use both independent and clustered earthquakes
to aid in hazard and risk assessments, for example, to estimate the rate at which independent
earthquakes occur, often called the background rate, as a basis for probabilistic seismic hazard
assessments (Giardini et al., 2003). The challenge lies in separating the two modes of seismic-
ity. Many different techniques have been created to decluster earthquake catalogues, by first
identifying and then removing dependent events, leaving only background events (e.g. Gard-
ner and Knopoff, 1974; Reasenberg, 1985; Frohlich and Davis, 1990; Davis and Frohlich, 1991a;
Baiesi and Paczuski, 2004). In these studies, the primary motivation is to estimate the back-
ground seismicity rate for use in hazard maps, with the cluster families (one or more groups
of linked earthquakes) a by-product. However, the clusters are also useful in their own right,
for example in identifying triggering mechanisms and the underlying processes that lead to
spatiotemporal clustering, or simply through providing information on the locations of faults.
In real time, identification of earthquake clusters and their properties can be useful in making
time-dependent operational forecasts for use in disaster relief and emergency planning, for
example by improving the probabilistic forecasts for the locations of aftershocks (Jordan et al.,
2011).
Clusters can be separated into two main end-member types - mainshock-aftershock se-
quences and swarm sequences. Mainshock-aftershock sequences are caused by one earth-
quake triggering another, leading to a transient cascade, typically with a large magnitude main-
shock followed by smaller magnitude aftershocks, with the rate of aftershocks decaying ac-
cording to a power law (Omori, 1894; Utsu, 1961). In contrast, swarm sequences do not have
an obvious mainshock, and there is no power-law decay rate. Instead, they typically start and
stop relatively suddenly (McNutt, 1996b). The earthquakes are not sequentially triggered by a
previous earthquake, and are instead related to a common underlying process that is limited
in space and time. Mainshock-aftershock sequences are characteristic of tectonic processes
and the swarm sequences are commonly associated with volcanic (including geothermal) pro-
cesses. The temporal evolution of swarm cluster families are particularly useful for under-
standing the state of unrest at a volcano and in the forecasting of volcanic activity. However,
we have to be able to distinguish them from mainshock-aftershock sequences, as well as from
any random background processes. In areas where faults are distinctly separate from volca-
noes, it is easier to identify the clusters as swarms or mainshock-aftershock sequences simply
from geographical separation. In volcano-tectonic areas such as active continental rifts, where
faults are in close proximity to volcanoes, separating the two types of cluster families is more
challenging.
There are many different clustering algorithms available. However, the majority of these
were developed on seismicity in southern California, where the cluster families are predomi-
nately mainshock-aftershock sequences, for example, the Landers (1992), Hector Mine (1999)
and Ridgecrest (2019) earthquake sequences. Therefore, these clustering algorithms, with
varying levels of success, remove mainshock-aftershock sequences from the observed seis-
micity. If the original catalogue includes some swarm sequences, then the declustered cata-
logue obtained from these algorithms will retain clusters associated with swarms, as well as
background seismicity. To resolve this, Jacobs et al. (2013) created a different clustering al-
gorithm designed to find swarms, as opposed to mainshock-aftershock sequences, using the
earthquakes located in the Central Volcanic Region of North Island, New Zealand.
To my knowledge, there is no comprehensive clustering algorithm which accurately sepa-
rates both swarms and mainshock-aftershock sequences from the background earthquakes,
and from each other. For example, in volcano-tectonic areas such as active continental rifts,
with mixed sources of seismicity including swarms, mainshock-aftershock sequences and in-
dependent events, there is significant overlap between the populations. This makes it difficult
to devise an optimal ternary classification into the three categories, and impossible to assign
100% confidence to such a classification (Bayliss et al., 2019). Nevertheless, it is important
that these cluster families are correctly identified in such settings, as accurately as possible.
The East African Rift is an approximately 6000km long active continental rift, with the Main
Ethiopian Rift (MER) forming the northern branch (Chorowicz, 2005). In the MER, there are 65
volcanoes and, at the time of the start of the NERC large-grant funded RiftVolc project, that
funded the work in this thesis, 43 of these were unknowns in terms of eruption style, repose
period and time of last eruption (Vye-Brown et al., 2016a). This volcanic setting is coupled
with large tectonic border faults that run down each side of the central rift valley. As part of
RiftVolc, scientists from a number of institutions across at least ten different countries have
addressed several research questions related to active rifting and volcanism. These are broadly
divided into the past, present and future - quantifying how the volcanoes erupted in the past,
identifying their current state of unrest, and developing hazard and risk assessments for future
eruptions (https://www.riftvolc.geos.ed.ac.uk/project). Examining the characteris-
tics of the seismicity at volcanoes is one geophysical tool which is useful for assessing the state
of a volcano, and can contribute to forecasting methodologies (e.g. Mcnutt, 2005; Chouet and
Matoza, 2013). Thus, it is important that the earthquakes related to volcanic processes can
be confidently and accurately diagnosed as such. This requires developing methods to iden-
tify the cluster families that are volcanic in origin, and to separate them from those that are
tectonic in origin.
This thesis describes the development and application of a new clustering technique which
accurately separates tectonic and volcanic cluster families from the population of background
https://www.riftvolc.geos.ed.ac.uk/project
events. I developed the new method on synthetic catalogues where dependent and inde-
pendent events are known a priori. The resulting Automated Line Plotting Saddlepoint (ALPS)
algorithm is based on fundamental properties which are inherent to seismic catalogues. Using
the time and distance between all pairs of events, a 2D map of these are plotted, initially for
pairs of events that are consecutive in time. In 2D space, the event pairs which are not linked
to one another are assigned to the background and those which do have a link are assigned to
a cluster. The ALPS algorithm assumes the two populations occur in different parts of a map
of the inter-event time and inter-event distance diagram, and plots an automated dividing line
through the two. Unlike previous methods, ALPS has no scaling of the inter-event time and
distances by magnitude. The advantage of this simplification is that it avoids added uncer-
tainty from the additional parameters that are required in alternative clustering techniques,
for example the distribution of the magnitude and the associated frequency magnitude expo-
nent or b-value (e.g. Gardner and Knopoff, 1974; Reasenberg, 1985; Baiesi and Paczuski, 2004;
Zaliapin and Ben-Zion, 2013a,b). ALPS also runs the clustering method over all pairs of events,
thus optimally identifying any cluster families that overlap and linking earthquakes that may
have been masked in other algorithms, to their correct cluster families with high (but not
100%) confidence. Specifically, I developed the method on synthetic catalogues, using end-
member models for mainshock-aftershock and swarm sequences using (a) the Epidemic-Type
Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model (Ogata, 1988; Touati, 2012) and (b) a model of sudden-onset
increase and subsequent decrease in event rate (McNutt, 1996b) to generate the cluster fam-
ilies. I then tested the performance of ALPS against other current clustering methods, finding
it to be the most successful clustering algorithm in correctly identifying known dependent and
independent event pairs.
I apply this methodology to a number of existing earthquake catalogues; southern Cali-
fornia, North Island, New Zealand and Iceland as well as the EAGLE dataset from the MER,
obtained during the Ethiopia-Afar Geoscientifc Lithospheric Experiment (Keir et al., 2006), a
predecessor of the RiftVolc project. Having identified such cluster families I use three further
independent characteristics to separate swarms from mainshock-aftershock sequences. These
diagnostic characteristics are the cumulative event rate, the magnitude evolution through time
and a force-directed Kamada-Kawai cluster network (Kamada and Kawai, 1989). All of these
have distinctive characteristics for the end-member models for clustering, and proved useful
in classifying cluster families whose properties were more intermediate.
Using the new clustering algorithm, ALPS, and the three diagnostic metrics, I examine the
cluster families in the datasets mentioned above, in some cases providing new insights. For
example, ALPS found more earthquakes in the cluster family in a mainshock-aftershock se-
quence in Te Araroa, New Zealand than previously thought (Warren-Smith et al., 2018). This
demonstrated the extent of dynamic triggering, where ephemeral seismic waves generated
by the Te Araroa mainshock, led to earthquakes triggered at White Island volcano. ALPS also
confirmed the findings of previous authors, providing further support to the proposed trig-
gering of swarms by underlying magma emplacement in the Salton Sea in southern California,
as discussed in Weaver and Hill (1978). In particular, we contribute to the RiftVolc by project
by identifying the cluster families located in the MER, helping quantify the state of unrest at
some of the volcanoes that generate seismicity. We found the fluids circulating around the hy-
drothermal systems at Tullu-Moye, Corbetti and Aluto volcanoes are the trigger mechanisms
for many of the swarms, whereas the cluster families identified by ALPS near the Ankober
border faults were mainshock-aftershock sequences. The results provide information that is
relevant for more holistic hazard and risk assessments for the MER.
1.1 Thesis outline
This thesis begins by outlining the challenge faced (Chapter 2), and providing a background to
earthquake clustering - both the phenomonelogy and physics of the clustering and the tech-
niques used to previously decluster catalogues. This background and motivation chapter also
explains the tectonic setting of the Main Ethiopian rift, exploring the relationship and interplay
between the faulting and volcanoes which lie along the central valley, and the complex seis-
micity patterns this leads to.
Chapter 3 covers the methods in detail, examining how the work described in this thesis
has expanded on the work of Touati et al. (2011) to create a new clustering method which
separates both swarms and mainshock-aftershock sequences from the background catalogue,
and from each other.
Next, there are two chapters presented in the form of manuscripts for companion papers.
The first, Chapter 4, describes the ALPS methodology, providing the results of testing the al-
gorithm on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The second, Chapter 5, investigates the
earthquake catalogues further and identifies three metrics which may be used to separate the
mainshock-aftershock cluster families from the swarms.
Finally, Chapter 6 details the results of several case studies that investigate a number of spe-
cific cluster families more closely in different tectonic and/or volcanic settings. The discussion
chapter (Chapter 7) explores potential trigger mechanisms for the cluster families and, where
possible, compares our findings to those reported elsewhere in the literature. The discussion
chapter highlights the potential use of ALPS beyond earthquake clustering, and indeed beyond
seismology, and suggests future work that could be done to address this.
The thesis concludes by summarising my key findings (Chapter 8), including the advantages
(and disadvantages) of using the new ALPS algorithm over current clustering methods, and the
implications for future work within the field of earthquake clustering and beyond.
Chapter 2
Context and motivation
In this chapter I present the motivation behind the project and how it has been designed to
contribute to the wider fields of understanding earthquake clustering and thus operational
forecasting and probabilistic hazard assessments for earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. I
explore the physics of earthquakes, their generation, and thus their relation to one another in
both tectonic and volcanic settings. I conclude with an in-depth discussion of current clustering
techniques and their respective advantages and disadvantages when applied to my specific
problem of separating volcanic and tectonic clusters.
My work was funded as part of the NERC large grant project, RiftVolc, which aims to in-
vestigate the past, present and future of volcanoes in the MER. In terms of the future aspect
of RiftVolcs project description; this refers to the potential future hazards and the mitiga-
tion of the associated risk. One part of this is the forecasting of volcanic eruptions. There
are many different monitoring techniques and methods which can be used to help forecast
volcanic eruptions and one of the most popular is the use of seismicity. Earthquakes which
have been caused by volcanic activity can enlighten us as to the state of the volcano. Different
earthquakes can be related to different processes. For example, longer period earthquakes
have been attributed to the movement of fluids within small cracks or slow brittle failure at
volcanic edifices (Chouet, 1996; Bean et al., 2014). Volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquakes have
higher frequencies, and are due to the failure of small faults resulting from pressure changes
often related to the injection or withdrawal of magma. Typically they can be found around
the tips of propagating dykes or around the edges of inflating dykes (Hill, 1977; Roman and
Cashman, 2006). These VT events normally occur in localised swarms - a sequence of earth-
quakes without an obvious mainshock. However, in the MER the volcanoes that run down
the central rift axis occur in magmatic segments approximately 50km long which also have
en-echelon style faulting within them (Keir et al., 2006; Ayele et al., 2015). This leads to over-
lapping earthquake sequences, with both swarm-type seismicity (typical of volcano seismic-
ity) and mainshock-aftershock sequences (typical of tectonically driven seismicity). In order
to forecast volcanic eruptions we need to ensure we are using the seismicity related to the
volcanic processes rather than the events related to the nearby tectonics. To separate the
earthquakes we need to apply earthquake clustering techniques. These were developed to
separate background seismicity from earthquakes which are related to one another. Remov-
ing these earthquakes to leave only the background is a pre-requisite for probabilistic seismic
hazard assessments, because the methods of analysis assume a stationary Poisson (random)
process (Giardini et al., 2003). However, these declustering techniques also reveal candidate
event pairs for identifying one or more cluster families of related earthquakes. In principle, we
can use such techniques to find families of related earthquakes in the MER and separate the
families of earthquakes that are caused by volcanic processes from those which are triggered
by tectonic processes. Once we have identified the volcanic earthquakes, we can apply the
forecasting methods to the selected data.
I start by describing the RiftVolc project in greater detail, exploring more about the location
and tectonic setting and most importantly, why the project is so crucial. I then discuss volcanic
seismicity, what triggers it, and explore the different processes that can lead to the different
types of seismicity and how we can use this knowledge and understanding in forecasting haz-
ards. Following on from this I describe the physics of clustering, what leads to earthquake
triggering and the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model which is used to model
mainshock-aftershock sequences. Finally I conclude by summarising the current clustering
techniques available and their advantages and disadvantages, both generally and in relation
to our specific clustering problem. I find that current methods are not suitable for this purpose.
Hence I have adapted and improved on two clustering approaches to create a new algorithm.

2.1 RiftVolc
The RiftVolc project began in September 2014 with the aim to investigate the past, present
and future of the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER). Part of one of the largest active continental rift
systems in the world, the East African Rift, the MER leads to the Afar triple junction which is
the meeting of the African, Somalian and Arabian plates (Figure 2.1). The countries the East
African Rift spans are all within the 50 poorest countries in the world - Ethiopia itself is the 15th
poorest country with an average GDP per capita of 1,153 (Pasquali, 2015; Tasch, 2016). There
are 65 volcanoes located within the MER, with 10 million people living within 30 kilometres of a
volcano, and before 2014, it was not known when 70% of these last erupted (Vye-Brown et al.,
2016b; Clarke et al., 2019). As the many central highways, population centres and farms are
located along the rift floor, it is crucial that we know more about these volcanoes in terms of
their eruption style and repose period. Following on from this, we must be able to provide early
warning systems and incorporate volcano forecasting methodologies into these. In addition to
the hazard posed to the infrastructure, geothermal power plants are planned or have already
been built near five of the volcanoes (green diamonds, Figure 2.1). Further to this, the Ethiopian
Geological Survey assessed that there was the potential of 10,000 MW of geothermal energy
across 23 sites (Tibebu, 2018) - an attractive prospect to foreign investors. However all of these
sites will be high risk due to their proximity to the volcanoes, and if the Ethiopians come to rely
heavily on geothermal power, it is essential to quantify the risk and provide accurate hazard
assessments.
Before we can estimate any risk or provide forecasting methodologies, we must first find
out how these volcanoes have erupted in the past and when they last erupted. From there,
the current state of unrest can be assessed and we can use this in our hazard maps. To reflect
this, the RiftVolc project was divided into three work packages, each representing one of the
three aims, which are listed below - my project is within the third work package (highlighted
in bold), focussed on the future of the volcanoes in the MER. Specifically, I will be responsible
for helping to quantify the state of unrest from geophysical data, which then links into the
development of the probabilistic hazard assessment methods.
1. What has driven eruptions over geological timescales?
2. What controls the active magmatic system and volcanic unrest?
3. What are the potential threats from future volcanic activity?
a) Quantify the state of unrest from geophysical data.
b) Develop probabilistic assessment methods to fully characterise key volcanic haz-
ards at a high risk central volcano.
c) Develop a regional analysis of ash fall hazard and assess the long-term volcanic
threat, incorporating inherent uncertainty.
In order to complete my project and contribute towards RiftVolc, and before I begin to
analyse the data, it is important to understand the tectonic setting of the Main Ethiopian Rift,
and the challenges this poses.
2.1.1 Main Ethiopian Rift - tectonic setting
The MER is an active spreading centre, forming as the Somalian plate moves away from the
African plate with a relative movement of approximately 7mm/yr (Fernandes et al., 2004). It
has large border fault systems, the Ankober and North Arboye, which lie at the transition from
the MER to Afar, the triangular plain in north-eastern Ethiopia, and 20 volcanoes which are
located along the valley floor. It is caused by the inception of a proto-ocean, and the mix of
natural hazards makes it an interesting place to study, but a dangerous place to live, especially
if there is a lack of monitoring.
The MER is thought to have developed due to a ~1000 km diameter mantle plume weak-
ening the lithosphere from 30 Ma; the extension between the African and Somalian plates at
25 Ma led to the first rifting in East Africa, with the opening of the Red Sea and the Gulf of
Aden (Chorowicz, 2005; Keir et al., 2006). The northern branch of the East African Rift (EAR)
is the MER and it is the youngest rift of the three-rift Afar triple junction (Keir et al., 2015). Rift-
ing initiated in the Southern and Central rift between 18 and 15Ma, followed by the Northern
segment at ~11Ma. Synchronous to the northwards propagation of the MER rift, the southern
margin of the Red Sea expanded southwards leading to the meeting of the two rifts, and the
birth of the triple junction. Finally, between 6.6 and 3.3Ma, the migration of the extensional
strain to ~60km long magmatic segments and smaller offset faults from the border faults led
to the rifting we observe today (Hayward and Ebinger, 1996; Abebe et al., 2007).
Some 80% of the present day extension strain is localised within the <20km wide, zones
of magmatism within the NE trending, 330km long central rift valley (Chorowicz, 2005; Keir
et al., 2006). The MER offers a unique chance to study development of a rift system. From
the initial continental rifting in the south to the beginnings of oceanic spreading in Afar, many
stages of rifting are encompassed within this one branch of the EAR (Keir et al., 2015). Indeed,
a new rifting episode started as recently as 23 September 2005 in the Dabbahu-Manda Hararo
magmatic segment located in Northern Afar (Vye-Brown et al., 2016a). The study area for the
RiftVolc project is located within the continental rift, and it is the volcanoes, forming within
the magmatic segments, that will be the focus of this study (Figure 2.1).
Magmatic activity, predominately in the form of mafic volcanism, is focussed along the rift
valley floor and the plumbing systems become more developed as you move from south-west
to north-east along the rift, due to an increase in surface faulting providing more magma path-
ways. This along-strike variation in volcanism arises from the asynchronous rift development
(Keir et al., 2015). The primary eruption style is effusive from the significant number of basaltic
volcanic fields - cinder cones and fissures - shields and monogenetic cones (Abebe et al., 2007;
Vye-Brown et al., 2016a). However, although there are limited records for explosive volcanism,
felsic pyroclastic flow deposits - including large volume ignimbrites - have been produced at
seven of Ethiopias volcanoes (Vye-Brown et al., 2016a). Although a single volcano will have
a typical eruptive style, there are many different hazards produced by and associated with
an eruption that can vary both spatially and temporally throughout the eruption cycle. In
Ethiopia, the RiftVolc impact plan will also contribute to educating the local population about
volcanoes, including outreach and providing text books for schools. Between 1900 and 2008,
more than 4.72 million people globally were affected by volcanic activity, therefore this work
is a vital part of ensuring early warning systems and evacuation systems are understood and
adhered to, especially in developing countries (Doocy et al., 2013).
Aside from the volcanic hazard, seismic hazards also need to be considered with the po-
tential for earthquakes from the numerous large fault systems and the smaller faulting within
the magmatic segments, in addition to the seismicity related to the volcanoes. Prior to RiftVolc,
there were four permanent seismic stations located in Ethiopia. In 2001, as part of the Ethiopian-
Afar Geoscientific Lithospheric Project (EAGLE), 27 additional seismometers were temporarily
stationed across the Ethiopian Rift. They were operational from 23rd October 2001 to 26th
January 2003, and recorded 1921 earthquakes (Keir et al., 2006). From Figure 2.2, the dis-
tribution and magnitude of these events can be seen. Primarily, they are located near the
volcanoes and around the Ankober Border Fault system, with more earthquakes clearly fol-
lowing the major fault in the North Arboye Border Fault system. The transect through the rift
goes through a particularly dense area, near the volcanoes Dofen and Fentale and across both
border faults. The large valley of the main rift floor can be seen in the topography and it can be
seen that the majority of the earthquakes cluster towards the north-western side. The depths
of the earthquakes extend down to 30km, the majority located within 5 and 20km, the brittle-
ductile transition zone, with a few outliers around 50km (not shown on figure). At a glance, it
would be easy to attribute those earthquakes near to the faults to tectonics and those near the
volcanoes to volcanic activity. However, the presence of faults within the magmatic segments
complicates the patterns and increases the difficulty in discerning the origin of the seismic-
ity. Accelerating sequences, mainshock-aftershock sequences and the movement of fluids all
occur synchronously, leading to the masking of causally-related seismicity (related through
earthquake-earthquake triggering or through sharing a common source). It is important to
make the distinction between them, as earthquakes related to tectonics must be excluded
from the data used to forecast volcanic eruptions. One such method used to separate earth-
quakes into related events is to use a clustering algorithm. There are many options available,
but all have their own advantages and disadvantages, which can change depending on the
location and the dominant type of seismicity (volcanic versus tectonic). Before we introduce
the clustering methods available to address these challenges, I first summarise the physics of
clustering, and investigate how these families of causally-related or linked events form. These
cluster families can be broadly divided into two categories; mainshock-aftershock sequences -
which can be modelled using the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model (subsec-
tion 2.2.3) and are related to tectonic faulting - and swarm sequences - typically found around
volcanoes.

2.2 Phenomenology and physics of clustering
When discussing cluster families - defined here as groups of causally-related earthquakes - we
can consider several different ways in which these earthquakes may relate to one another. As
mentioned previously, we can approximately split cluster families into mainshock-aftershock
and swarm sequences. Mainshock-aftershock sequences typically have one large magnitude
event, the mainshock, which subsequently triggers more events, the aftershocks. Empirically,
the rate at which these aftershocks decay, i.e. the number of earthquakes at time t, n(t), is in
accordance with Omoris law (Equation 2.1), where t is time after the mainshock and k (which
includes the magnitude dependence) and c are constants (Omori, 1894).
n(t) =
(2.1)
Omoris law itself can be shown to be a consequence of time-dependent stress relaxation
in the damage mechanics model of Main (1999). The frequency-magnitude distribution of
earthquake populations typically take the form of a Gutenberg-Richter distribution (Equation
2.2), where N is the number of earthquakes greater than or equal to M, M is the magnitude,
a is the total number of earthquakes at M 0 and b is a constant known as the b-value, which
depends on the ratio of large earthquakes to small earthquakes.
logN = abM (2.2)
The b-value is typically unity for tectonic areas, but in volcanic areas is much more variable;
it can be as low as 0.5 and can reach values greater than 3 (Frohlich and Davis, 1993; McNutt,
2005). Additionally, it does not stay constant through time but can sometimes change on the
approach to an eruption (Roberts et al., 2016).
For mainshock-aftershock sequences, the mainshock is commonly 1.1-1.2 times the size of
the largest aftershock, completely independent of the magnitude of the initial mainshock -
this observation is known as Bths law (Bath and Duda, 1964). Earthquake aftershocks are
also spatially clustered in time, and diffuse only slowly away from the mainshock fault rupture
with respect to time (Huc and Main, 2003).
Earthquake swarms are also spatiotemporally closely clustered, but have no obvious main-
shock, and hence do not follow Bths law. Hill (1977) first proposed models of earthquake
swarms in volcanic environments and geothermal areas, but they can also occur on transform
faults (Vidale and Shearer, 2006). The generation of swarms in volcanic environments is ex-
plored further in subsection 2.2.4.
Before I discuss the characteristics of the two types of earthquake sequence, I will first
briefly describe the mechanisms of how earthquakes occur, and how they can be triggered in
both tectonic (subsection 2.2.1) and volcanic environments (subsection 2.2.2).
Earthquakes, in the broadest sense, occur when rock fractures and the stress and strain
that has built up is released almost instantaneously as energy in the form of seismic waves.
The rock fractures when the shear stress overcomes a critical threshold. This alters between
different rock types and conditions, for example, changing depending on whether the rock is
wet or dry. This critical stress is given by the Coulomb failure criterion (Stein, 1999; Beeler
et al., 2000);
c = s(n p) (2.3)
where  c is the Coulomb failure stress, n is the normal stress change, s is the shear
stress change on a fault, p is the pore fluid pressure and  is the friction coefficient. From
this equation failure is promoted by: an increase in shear stress, a decrease in normal stress,
or an increase in pore pressure (Stein, 1999). The last two mechanisms are sometimes called
unclamping which are important in aiding the understanding of seismicity caused by both
extensional rifting and by magma injection. A more visual interpretation uses Mohr circles
(Figure 2.3, Page 32) (Mohr, 1900). If we have a fracture in a rock which is parallel to one of
the principal stress axes - in Figure 2.3a this is 2 - at its most simple, the differential stress is
the difference between 1 (maximum principal stress) and 3 (minimum principal stress). If
we have a pore fluid pressure, p, the effective normal stress is n p. When we plot effective
normal stress against shear stress (s) the Coulomb failure criterion, c, at which the rock
fails at these stresses, can be plotted as a straight line, where the gradient is the coefficient
of friction,  . A rock will fail when the Mohr circle intersects the Coulomb failure criterion
line, which can be calculated as a function of the angle  between the minimum stress axis
measured in the 1-3 plane (Equation 2.4).

sin (2.4)
Figure 2.3c shows visually that an increase in pore fluid pressure will shift the Mohr circle
to the left as it decreases the effective normal stress, even though the diameter of the circle
is not changing - the differential stress remains the same. Furthermore, additional controls on
the failure are  , the angle of the fracture to 2-3 plane (Figure 2.3a), the diameter of the
circle (3 - 1) and  . The friction coefficient is typically taken to be ~0.6 which is obtained
from Byerlees law. Byerlee measured the friction at maximum stress for a wide variety of
rock types under controlled laboratory conditions and found that below 200MPa of normal
stress,  = 0.85 and above 200MPa  is 0.6, therefore for most rocks at seismogenic depths it
lies somewhere between the two (Byerlee, 1978). Finally, on the Mohr circle plots, the tensile
stress regime exists where the effective stress is less than zero, whereas the compressive stress
regime exists when the effective normal stress is positive.
Coulomb friction is well constrained in the laboratory, and is consistent with the typical
angle of dip for a normal fault,  = 90  of 60 degrees. Based on early laboratory results
on analogue materials, Anderson (1905) assumed a scale invariant frictional process to explain
the dip of normal (60 degrees), thrust (30 degrees) and strike-slip (90 degrees) faults. It is hard
to measure the value of stresses in the real-world, however we can usually infer the direction
of the principal axes and estimate the magnitude of any changes in stress. If the Coulomb
failure stress is positive then the fault is now closer to failing than previously, and vice versa,
a negative value of Coulomb failure stress would mean the fault is further away from failing.
An example of the calculated Coulomb failure stress is shown in Figure 2.4. Using the Mw 4.29
earthquake which occurred near Hawassa, Ethiopia (7N, 38.5E) on 24th January 2016 and the
regional stress field for Ethiopia of Muluneh et al. (2018), we can calculate the Coulomb failure
stress around a parallel normal fault with the same dip and rake as the best fitting fault plane.
The red lobes illustrate where there is a positive Coulomb failure stress and the blue lobes
are where there is a negative Coulomb failure stress. If we project these stresses onto known
nearby faults, or optimal thrust, normal or strike-slip faults, we can estimate where faults may
have been brought closer to failure. This stress transfer is an example of static triggering, and
Figure 2.3  Mohr circles present a visual interpretation of Coulomb failure law (Equation 2.3). a) and b) illustrate
this. The effective normal stress, n is the difference between the two principal stress axes, 1 and 2. s is parallelto the fault plane and is the shear stress. The coefficient of friction,  determines the slope of the line as  = tan .
The line is the Coulomb failure criterion, when the Mohr circle intersects this line, the rock will fail. c) shows that
an increase in pore fluid pressure, p, can cause a drop in effective normal stress (the Mohr circle moves to the left),
leading to the failure of the rock.
Figure 2.4  The Coulomb stress change for the Mw 4.29 24/01/2016 earthquake near Hawassa, Ethiopia. A Youngs
modulus of 4 x 1012 Pa was used, the value estimated for the upper crust in an elastic rift in Beutel et al. (2010).
The regional stress field is given by -119.6/77.2, 6.2/7.6 and 97.5/10.2 for the azimuth/plunge of 1, 2 and 3,respectively. The regional stress field and the coefficent of friction,  = 0.59, the average for the MER, are both
from Muluneh et al. (2018). The optimal fault receiver is the same as the initial fault with a strike/dip/rake of
355.3/72.2/-76.4 (Wilks et al., 2017). Size of fault plane was calculated using the Wells and Coppersmith (1994)
empirical relation.
affects the immediate surrounding region. However, triggering can also occur at much greater
distances, for example the Denali earthquake, a Mw 7.9 earthquake which occurred in Alaska
in 2002, led to an increase in seismicity 3600km away in the Coso geothermal field in southern
California (Freed, 2005a). This is an example of dynamic triggering.
2.2.1 Static and dynamic triggering
In the previous section, I introduced static and dynamic triggering. These two triggering mech-
anisms are the main cause of aftershocks after an initial mainshock. However, each earthquake
has the potential to generate further earthquakes. The background earthquakes defined in
this thesis refer to earthquakes which generate aftershocks with very small magnitudes (<0.1),
earthquakes which are too far apart in time to be considered a cluster family or earthquakes
which do not generate further earthquakes. Figure 2.5 shows the state of stress after an earth-
quake in an extensional setting. After the initial slip of the earthquake, there is a stress relax-
ation with ongoing displacement (e.g. as seen in the 2003 Bam earthquake in Iran, Field-
ing et al. (2009)). The stress built up prior to the earthquake is transferred immediately, but
anisotropically (Figure 2.4). It may be that the stress transferred is not sufficient to exceed the
Couloumb failure criterion in that location (Equation 2.3) and Figure 2.3), thus the earthquake

setting. The red T is time.
does not generate any more aftershocks. Likewise, it may be the stress is released as aseis-
mic creep, again with no aftershocks generated. In other circumstances, the stress transferred
will generate very small magnitude earthquakes, or as it relaxes under the continued exten-
sional forces, eventually the stress transferred will be such that it reaches the Coulomb failure
criterion and an earthquake is caused. When this occurs over a significant amount of time,
these will not be considered a cluster family. It is these earthquakes, that either do not lead to
further earthquakes being triggered, are very small magnitude, or are significantly distanced
enough in time, that we term background events.
For mainshock-aftershock sequences, the predominate cause of these sequences is static
triggering. Static triggering occurs because of purely elastic stress changes relating to the
earthquake slip and uses elastostatic tensor modelling to estimate the Coulomb failure stress
on receiver faults surrounding the mainshock rupture. At the tip of the fault, where slip is zero,
there is a concentration of stress and thus there is a raised likelihood of aftershocks occurring
immediately around the tip. The blue colours, where there is a negative Coulomb stress (some-
times known as stress shadows) have a lower probability of earthquakes occurring. In addition
to the simple structure in Figure 2.4, occasionally a more uneven structure is formed, such as
off-fault lobes (Freed, 2005b). This can lead to triggering on neighbouring faults, and the trans-
fer of stress across fault systems (King et al., 1994; Toda, 2003). Furthermore, an earthquake
may trigger another earthquake on a neighbouring fault system, which in turn will produce its
own Coulomb stresses. This will again change the state of stress within the area, so seismicity
that is being produced where there was a positive Coulomb stress relating to the first earth-
quake, may be stopped by a more negative Coulomb stress relating to the second earthquake
(Harris et al., 1995). This occurred in southern California where the Hector Mine earthquake
in 1999 led to a stress shadow which in turn stopped seismicity in an area that had previously
become more active due to an increase in stress from the 1992 Landers earthquake (Parsons
and Dreger, 2000; Toda et al., 2005).
Static triggering typically causes aftershock sequences which are located close to the orig-
inal mainshock rupture both spatially and temporally, the magnitude of stress falling off at a
rate of d-2, where d is distance to the fault (Cotton and Coutant, 1997). However, there have
been observations of earthquakes triggering other earthquakes that are hundreds, and some-
times thousands, of kilometres away. These earthquakes normally occur with or within a few
minutes of the high-amplitude surface waves of the original earthquake passing through. For
example the 1992 Landers earthquake triggered sequences in Basin and Range on the Nevada
border and in the Geysers geothermal area (Hill et al., 1993). Anderson et al. (1994) concluded
that only 10% of these earthquakes would have occurred according to the background seis-
micity rates. This phenomenon is known as dynamic triggering. At distances greater than
200km away, coseismic static Coulomb stress changes are less than the diurnal tidal stress
changes caused by the moon and yet the Geysers geothermal area is 650km away from Lan-
ders (Freed, 2005a). However, transient stresses related to the seismic surface waves fall off at
a rate of d-1 (Cotton and Coutant, 1997), which leads to dynamic stress changes comparable to
or increasingly larger than static stress changes at greater distances. There was a 0.02 - 2 MPa
Coulomb failure stress increase in areas with a high concentration of aftershocks for the 1991
Mw 8.1 Chile earthquake versus 0.12 - 0.35 MPa transient stresses estimated in Utah relating to
the Denali earthquake (Lin and Stein, 2004; Pankow et al., 2004). The small absolute value of
these stresses implies that the Earths crust was quite close to a critical value in both cases, but
closer in the Chile example, of a magnitude of 1/5 and two times atmospheric pressure. This
variable susceptibility to triggering is hard to know in advance, but its presence is consistent
with the hypothesis of self-organised criticality as a physical mechanism driving earthquake
population dynamics (Main, 1996). Dynamic stresses are largest in directions that depend on
the relevant surface wave and the direction of rupture and can only cause earthquakes at faults
already close to failure. They may also promote sub-critical crack growth, which could accel-
erate leading to a delayed failure (Huc and Main, 2003). Volcanic and geothermal areas are
particularly susceptible to the ephemeral dynamic stresses as the seismic waves can temporar-
ily unblock fractures in hydrothermal systems or promote bubble growth through oscillations
(Sturtevant et al., 1996; Brodsky and Prejean, 2005).
The triggered seismicity in the Geysers field is clearly causally-related to the Landers earth-
quakes. However, it occurs at too great a distance to be identified as such in any spatiotem-
poral algorithm. Hence, we would consider the seismicity in the Geysers to be a cluster family
in its own right, as the earthquakes are all linked to the same local process, but this cluster
family (more swarm-like nature) would not be part of the Landers cluster family (more con-
ventionally a set of mainshock-aftershock sequences). On the other hand, earthquakes that
are linked through static triggering to local mainshock-aftershock sequences, would be con-
sidered as part of the same cluster family. This is a challenge, because we want to separate
these sequences from the swarm-type sequences which typify volcanic seismicity. In partic-
ular, volcanic seismicity is related to different processes which are unique to volcanic areas. I
have briefly mentioned the two potential triggers, pressurisation of a magma system through
bubble growth and the blocking and unblocking of fractures within hydrothermal areas. I now
provide a more in depth explanation of the sources of volcanic seismicity and why it is im-
portant that we separate the volcanic and tectonic earthquakes so the families of volcanic
earthquakes may be used in hazard forecasting.
2.2.2 Volcanic seismicity
Static and dynamic triggering of earthquakes by previous ones, typically lead to mainshock-
aftershock sequences. In contrast swarm sequences occur because they are responding to a
common local underlying process. This is typical for earthquakes that occur at volcanoes. Vol-
canic seismicity has a range of different event types, which are illustrated in Table 2.1 (Page 40),
and from these it is possible to infer the underlying processes. For example, VT, also known
as high frequency, earthquakes are typically caused by brittle fracture; such as by hydrofrac-
turing or in response to stress changes associated with magma intrusion, and cooling (Roman
and Cashman, 2006; Chouet and Matoza, 2013). In contrast, low frequency (LF) earthquakes
are most commonly attributed to the presence of fluid-filled cracks. If we can identify vol-
canic clusters of these different types, we can say more about the current state of unrest at
volcanoes.
The two most common event types used in volcano seismology are LF earthquakes and VT
earthquakes. I will briefly introduce both types. A typical LF event can be characterised by a
signal onset enriched in higher frequencies, followed by a decaying harmonic coda (Chouet,
1996). Chouet hypothesised that the decaying harmonic oscillations are due to resonance in a
fluid-filled crack, and it is the trigger mechanism that can be produced by a wide-variety of vol-
canological processes. Chouet and Matoza (2013) identify five broad families of processes that
could be the source origin of LF seismicity. These are: self-sustained fluid oscillations, magma-
hydrothermal interactions, magmatic degassing, brittle fracture of the melt and finally, solid
extrusion dynamics and plug stick-slip. Magma-hydrothermal interactions can lead to shallow
LF seismicity via a range of mechanisms, all pressure-induced disruptions of the shallow hy-
drothermal region e.g. boiling, the cyclical failure and recharge of hydrothermal cracks under
pressure, or the choking of the flow of gases (Petersen, 2007). Magmatic degassing could be
another potential trigger mechanism. LF activity is widely observed in relation to degassing, for
example, increased flux of volcanic gases would increase fluid pressure within a crack leading
to an increase in the generation of LF events (Petersen, 2007).
Bean et al. (2014) suggest an alternative interpretation of the distinctive waveform seen
in Table 2.1. They state that all aspects of the observations can be reproduced by slow rup-
ture failure, with gravity, gas influx or magma migration being the cause of underlying stress
fluctuations. As no fluids are directly involved in the seismic signature of the source process,
the decaying harmonic coda is alternatively suggested to be a propagation effect. This is sup-
ported by Figure 2.6, which shows the simple pulses close to Mount Etna, and it is only as the
events are recorded at stations further away that the LF waveforms develop the distinctive
shape seen in Table 2.1.
LF seismicity is particularly useful in forecasting eruption time by tracking the movement of
magma and degassing which can be achieved by monitoring changes and modelling changes
Figure 2.6  Figure taken from Bean et al. (2014) showing spatial distribution and strong propagation path effects

in the event rate. For example; at Telica volcano in Nicaragua, before an eruption, the num-
ber of LF events decreases, until there are zero events, as minerals precipitate and block the
hydrothermal system (Rodgers et al., 2015). This leads to an increase in the pressure, which in
turn leads to a phreatomagmatic eruption. Thus, a decrease, and subsequently an absence,
of LF earthquakes, suggests an eruption is imminent in this case. In other cases, the precursor
takes the form of a reverse-time Omori law (Bell et al., 2018).
For this project, the focus is on VT earthquakes. In contrast to tectonic earthquakes, VT
events do not have the typical mainshock-aftershock distribution and tend to occur in swarms.
It is often one of the earliest, detectable, seismic precursors for volcanic eruptions, especially
for those that have been in repose for at least two decades (Roman and Cashman, 2006; White
and McCausland, 2016). This repose time applies to the majority of the volcanoes in Ethiopia.
As LF earthquakes are used for forecasting, so may VT events (White and McCausland, 2016).
Similarly, they may be used to elucidate underlying processes that may or may not lead to
eruption - many accelerating sequences indistinguishable from those that do end in eruption
actually end with intrusive emplacement and freezing of magma (Chastin, 2003). This means
there may be many more false alarms than true eruption forecasts in such cases.
Most VT events occur close to the volcanic centre, relating to magma injections or with-
drawal and the subsequent brittle failure of the surrounding rock. However, more distal VT
earthquakes are also useful for monitoring and forecasting of volcanoes. Typically the distal
VT swarms will increase in number until a significant phreatic eruption and the swarms are
found in association with known fault systems (White and McCausland, 2016). These obser-
vations have been attributed to pressure pulses through aquifers, which in turn are linked to
pulses of intruding magma near the volcanic centre. As seen in the Coulomb failure stress for-
mula (Equation 2.3) and the Mohr circles (Figure 2.3), the pressure pulses reduce the effective
normal stress on pre-stressed tectonic faults relating to magma injection thus triggering earth-
quakes by unclamping the faults. As more and larger patches of faults slip due to lubrication
from the over-pressurised aquifers (due to indirect thermal heating rather than a direct pres-
sure connection with the magma chamber), the number of events increases. Once the first
phreatic eruption has occurred the aquifers depressurise and thus the number of events de-
creases (White and McCausland, 2016). This interaction between the aquifers, regional faults
and magma intrusions could be a significant factor to consider when investigating VT seismic-
ity in the MER. There are many regional fault networks and extensive hydrothermal systems
(Figure 2.1), and the relationship between these is important. Furthermore, the clustering
methodology will need to distinguish between VT swarms and normal mainshock-aftershock
sequences occurring on these faults.
This brief introduction to the sources of various volcanic seismicity, has highlighted some
issues with their use in hazard monitoring and forecasting. In the following sections, I will
discuss the characteristics of the mainshock-aftershock sequences and the swarm-type se-
quences and thus the VT event generation in an active tectonic setting in more depth. I will
contrast the swarms with the tectonic mainshock-aftershock sequences and discuss how we
can separate an earthquake catalogue into its individual clusters. This is important because,
if I can separate the events into their different families, then we can use the volcanic swarms
within volcanic forecasting methodologies and incorporate the declustered catalogues and tec-
tonic sequences into probabilistic hazard assessments.

2.2.3 Mainshock-aftershock sequences (ETAS)
We start with mainshock-aftershock sequences, i.e. the sequence type typical of a cluster of
causally-related earthquakes in tectonic areas. A textbook example would be southern Cali-
fornia and the San Andreas fault system, which frequently has large earthquakes followed by
a sequence of aftershocks. Earthquakes can be considered as point processes which are Pois-
sonian, i.e. occur randomly in time, but only until an earthquake is large enough to trigger a
cascade of related earthquakes, where each of the aftershocks is equally likely to trigger fur-
ther earthquakes. The Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model uses empirical laws
which are known to govern the properties of earthquakes (e.g. Omoris law, equation 2.5, and
the Gutenberg-Richter relation, equation 2.2) and combines these with a conditional inten-
sity function. The empirical laws themselves have a firm basis in theories based on rate and
state friction (Dieterich, 1994) or subcritical crack growth (Main, 2000). As with the spread
of infectious diseases, which is dependent on the history of the infection in terms of location
and number infected, so the ETAS model considers all past events which contribute to the
probability of the next one occurring.
The ETAS model starts by considering the background rate of earthquakes, using a station-
ary Poisson process to emulate this. The conditional intensity includes the history of the earth-
quakes which leads to independent events triggering aftershocks. The magnitudes of all events
are taken from the Gutenberg-Richter relationship (equation 2.2) and the decay of events uses
Utsus modification of the Omori law, (equation 2.5) (Utsu, 1961).
n(t) =
(c+ t)p
(2.5)
The law describes the decay of the aftershock rate (n(t)) with time after the mainshock (t),
and all earthquakes may trigger aftershocks; the number of aftershocks depending on the par-
ent event magnitude. K and c are constants and are included in Omoris original law (Equation
2.1), the third constant, p, was added by Utsu and modifies the decay rate. Using these two
relations, we can form the ETAS conditional intensity function ( ) which is dependent on the
time (t) and the history of the process at t (Ht ) (Equation 2.6).
 (t|Ht) =  +K 
i:t<ti
exp((mim0))(t ti + c)p (2.6)
The parameters m0, ti and mi, included within this equation, are the lower magnitude cut-
off, the times of past events and their magnitudes, respectively. The remaining five parameters
are the ETAS parameters, where K, c and p are taken from the Omori-Utsu law,  is the produc-
tivity parameter and  is the background seeding rate from the temporally-random stationary
Poisson process. A literature review by Touati (2012) found the most common ETAS parame-
ters used up to that point in time (Figure 2.7). These are later used in Chapter 3, Section 3.3.1
to generate synthetic tectonic catalogues which I use to validate the new clustering method-
ology. In the ETAS model, every event may trigger aftershocks and this can lead to branching
nested sequences, reflecting the behaviour of real-world mainshock-aftershock sequences. To
transform this into a spatiotemporal ETAS model, I use an isotropic power law kernel with the
spatial parameters q and d, also used by Hainzl et al. (2008) and Touati et al. (2011), which
describes the spatial probability distribution for the coordinates of the aftershocks (Equation
2.7). The parameter q is the rate of decay of triggering, as a function of distance. However, at
the epicentre, q becomes singular, whereas we know it must be finite. Therefore the empiri-
cal parameter d is introduced to avoid this. It represents a characteristic distance where near
field effects e.g. finite depth, finite source dimension, and the stress drop at the source (which
makes future rupture less likely) combine to reduce the probability of triggering compared to
the far field result.
f (x,y) =
(q1)d2(q1)
[x2 + y2 +d2]q
(2.7)
ETAS may be considered a successful model for mainshock-aftershock sequences and thus
we use the spatiotemporal form to generate a synthetic catalogue which reflects clusters in a
tectonic area (Chu et al., 2011). In contrast, we see different earthquake sequences generated
in volcanic areas. These are typically swarms which do not have an obvious mainshock and
instead of being earthquake-earthquake triggered, are related to a common local underlying
process (Hill, 1977). In this thesis such swarms are modelled by stochastic sampling of a lo-

calised inhomogeneous (piece-wise stationary) Poisson process with time-dependent changes
in the underlying rate  . The physical mechanisms for generating swarms in volcanic settings
are introduced in the following section.
2.2.4 Earthquake swarms
The origin of the volcano-tectonic earthquake swarms varies from dyke propagation and infla-
tion to faults responding to the propagation of high pore pressure fluids (Roman and Cashman,
2006; Kanamori et al., 2008). In volcanic environments, if we can identify the cluster families
relating to volcanic processes, the locations of the earthquakes within the cluster family and
the focal mechanisms can help determine the cause of the seismicity. For example, in dyke
emplacement, the dominating seismic response can be affected by a variety of factors: the
rheology of the ascending magma, the regional stress field (both its orientation and magni-
tude) and finally, any pre-existing faults near to the dyke (Roman and Cashman, 2006). There
are three potential models which can be considered for the generation of the swarms relat-
ing to dykes (Figure 2.8) which are the conceptual model of Hill (1977) (Figure 2.8A), and the
models of Ukawa and Tsukahara (1996) (Figure 2.8B) and Roman (2005) (Figure 2.8C). The dif-
ferences in the three are reflected in the movement of the hypocentres and the orientation
of the fault plane solutions. Hill (1977) suggests the VT earthquakes are triggered on the shear
planes connecting two dykes, both of which are inflating and are offset from one another. In
contrast, Ukawa and Tsukahara (1996) propose the movement of the events as they are trig-
gered ahead of a propagating dyke. In both of these models, the P-axes of the fault plane
solutions (the direction of largest amplitude dilatant displacement) are parallel to the axis of
the regional maximum stress. The model of Roman (2005) is that of an inflating dyke. In this
case, the P-axes are rotated ~90 to maximum compressive stress. Additionally, there is no
spatial movement of the earthquakes with time, instead they are randomly distributed in the
dyke walls, which is inflating parallel to the regional minimum compressive stress (Roman and
Cashman, 2006). Typically the seismicity reflects either dyke propagation or dyke inflation,
with rotated P-axes and randomly distributed hypocentres (dyke inflation), or parallel P-axes
and hypocentres moving ahead of the propagating dyke tip (Figure 2.8), which in turn depends
on the volcanic setting. Stratovolcanoes that erupt often highly crystalline, hydrous magmas
typically have events that are caused by dyke inflation. This requires aseismic dyke propaga-
tion, which is hypothesised to be as a result of slow magma ascent, often true of intermediate
magmas that undergo extensive crystallisation, or an already established, mechanically weak
pathway (Roman and Cashman, 2006). In contrast, seismicity relating to dyke propagation is
observed at basaltic volcanoes which are located in a setting with small differences between
the regional stress field and the dyke-induced stresses. This leads to aseismic dyke inflation as
the local stresses from magmatic processes are directly overshadowed by the regional stresses
(Roman and Cashman, 2006). In the MER, an area with strong regional stresses, established
pre-existing faults and more silicic magmas, it is likely that the seismicity will reflect dyke in-
flation, Figure 2.8C.

mechanisms of volcano tectonic seismciity. (A) From Hill (1977). (B) From Ukawa and Tsukahara (1996). (C) From
Roman (2005).
In addition to dyke emplacement, swarms are often related to active hydrothermal systems,
often above the zone of magma injection, for example southwest of the Salton Sea, southern
California and the Tokaanu geothermal area, south of Lake Taupo, North Island, New Zealand
have a significant number of swarm sequences (Sherburn, 1992; Zaliapin and Ben-Zion, 2016a).
The movement of the hot fluids increases pore-fluid pressure and can lead to failure within the
dense network of fractures, leading to many events occurring within a small area.
2.3 Current clustering techniques
Separating earthquakes into cluster families and producing a residual declustered catalogue
for probabilistic seismic hazard analysis has been a challenge for seismologists for decades.
There are many techniques that may be used to identify cluster families, and I will give a brief
description of the most popular algorithms. However, there are advantages and disadvantages
to each method. The biggest disadvantage is that the majority have been developed and tested
using the seismicity data from southern California. Therefore, most of these sequences will be
of the mainshock-aftershock type, and so the methodologies used will be better at identifying
these than the swarm sequences. For many clustering approaches, the ease and efficiency of
the algorithm is a significant advantage, however a compromise and balance must be found
between computational speed and accuracy. I discuss the respective arguments for each be-
2.3.1 Window Methods
One of the first methods developed, and still one of the most popular to use, is the window
method (Gardner and Knopoff, 1974). It has endured as it is one of the simplest ways of iden-
tifying mainshocks and their related events. For each earthquake in the catalogue, a time and
distance window is calculated, varying with the magnitude, M, of the event. If any subsequent
earthquakes occur within this window they are identified as aftershocks of this event. These
windows will readjust with each earthquake, and larger events will lead to bigger windows.
The mainshock is defined as the largest magnitude earthquake in the sequence. The deter-
mination of the windows varies from study to study, here we present the sizes according to
Gardner and Knopoff (1974), the most commonly used window sizes and the equations for Gru-
enthal (van Stiphout et al., 2012) (Equations 2.10 and 2.11) and Uhrhammer (1986) (Equations
2.13 and 2.13).

d = e1.024+0.804M[km] (2.12)
t = e2.87+1.235M[days] (2.13)
Ultimately, there is no way to distinguish between primary aftershocks directly linked to
the mainshock, and secondary aftershocks triggered by other aftershocks. Furthermore, as
the technique was initially developed for declustering the seismicity in southern California, it
is unlikely the window sizes will apply globally and there is no clear methodology for calculating
new window sizes for other catalogues. Finally, when considering the challenge of clustering
earthquakes in the MER, overlapping sequences that occur within short time frames would be
identified as part of the same cluster, when it is crucial we identify different clusters to discern
their origin processes, this would be a significant weakness to the method.
Subsequent clustering methods developed have improved on the window method by alter-
ing how earthquakes are linked to one another and allowing for branching nested aftershocks,
the first to try this is the algorithm of Reasenberg (1985).
2.3.2 CLUSTER2000
Reasenbergs method is another popular declustering technique, again due to its simplicity,
and the CLUSTER2000 software is easily available to download from the USGS Earthquake

Hazards Program website. Also developed on the seismicity in southern California, it links
earthquakes based on spatiotemporal interaction zones, and these will grow as more earth-
quakes are added to the cluster. It improves on the previous window size calculations by in-
corporating the stress distribution and afterslip near the mainshock into the distance equation
(2.14), where k is 1 for the distance to the largest earthquake, and 0 for the distance to the last
one. Additionally, Omoris law (Equation 2.5) is included within the temporal equation (2.15),
where p1 is the probability of observing the next earthquake in the interval min - max where
min and max are the minimum and maximum lookahead times for observing the earthquake.
This assumes that the Omori decay constant is 1, and M = Mmainshock xxmeff where xxmeff is
the effective magnitude cut-off (van Stiphout et al., 2012).

The original algorithm was developed for identifying foreshocks and aftershocks for events
with M  4 and is still widely used, including for events of magnitudes less than four. Addi-
tionally, despite the initial research area of southern California, the same parameters are be-
ing used for the declustering of many earthquake catalogues, including those from outside of
southern California. A goodness-of-fit 2 test conducted by van Stiphout et al. (2012) showed
there is a wide range of parameters that can be used and the declustered catalogue still fits
a stationary Poisson distribution (Table 2.2). It is unlikely that all the parameters will lead to
the same cluster families, therefore a more decisive method of characterising the clusters is
needed. This is introduced in more recent clustering techniques by using equations to define
more definitive values which we can use to separate clusters from background events.

2.3.3 Single Link Clustering
Unlike previous methods which use time and distance window equations which scale with
the magnitude, the Single-Link Clustering (SLC) method of Frohlich and Davis (1990) identi-
fies earthquake clusters by linking event pairs based on a single space-time parameter (dst,
Equation 2.16).
dst =
(d2 +C22) (2.16)
where  is the inter-event time, d is the inter-event distance and C is a constant that con-
verts the time into an equivalent space/time distance. This constant is typically 1km/day (Davis
and Frohlich, 1991a). Unlike the window methods and Reasenberg, this link between space and
time means events which are further apart in distance but close in time may have strong links,
whereas in the aforementioned methods, these events would not have been in the same clus-
From these links, trees are created where events are connected by the smallest dst value,
until all earthquakes are linked. These links are then severed should the parameter dst be less
than a certain value, Dst. Dst is calculated according to the following equation (2.17), where
8 ST-km < S1 < 300 ST-km. A typical value calculated for Dst is 60 ST-km, this was found to
be an average over synthetic catalogues and the Mexico and Alaskan earthquake catalogues
(Davis and Frohlich, 1991a).
Dst-best(S1) 9.4 ST-km 12S125.2 ST-km (2.17)
Tested in Davis and Frohlich (1991b), this method worked as well as the window meth-
ods and Reasenberg, and improves on the wide range of parameters which could be used for
Reasenberg (1985) by having a definitive linking strength on which the clusters are separated
from the independent events. However, for small earthquake catalogues, both in duration
and area covered, the Dst-best can lead to negative values when S1, the median link distance,
is small. In these cases, it is unclear how you define a "weak" or "strong" link. For a clustering
algorithm to be run over a variety of sizes of datasets, this makes the SLC method less than
ideal. For example in East Africa, the catalogues we are working with are too small for this
method to work effectively. Therefore a different technique must be used that can adapt to
various catalogue sizes.
2.3.4 Methods based on inter-event times and inter-event distances
Similar to the Dst parameter in SLC, more recent techniques have separated earthquakes into
clustered and background events based on a correlation metric found from the inter-event
times (ti j) and inter-event distances (ri j). The first example of this is in the work of Baiesi and
Paczuski (2004) where a magnitude-scaled nearest-neighbour metric is calculated, ni j (Equa-
tion 2.18).
ni j = ti jr
i j 10
bmi (2.18)
The shortest ni j is calculated for each pair of earthquakes, where ti and t j is the time of
earthquakes i and j respectively, r is the distance between earthquakes i and j, b is the b-
value from the Gutenberg-Richter relation and mi is the magnitude of the first event. Here
d f is the fractal dimension, which describes the spatial distribution of the epicentres and is
empirically linked to the b-value (Okubo, 1987; Legrand, 2002), though the correlation can be
positive or negative, depending on the underlying processes (Main, 1992; Henderson et al.,
1994). After plotting a histogram of ni j, the resulting distribution is bimodal, with event pairs
with short ni j more likely to be associated with a causally-related cluster, and those at longer
ni j more likely to be independent of each other, i.e. part of the background seismicity. A cut-
off nc is chosen somewhat subjectively at the visual minimum in the histogram between the
two peaks to separate the two populations, and as with the SLC, all ni j values above this are
considered to be independent.
Zaliapin et al. (2008) improves on this method further by removing the uncertainty and
subjectivity involved in choosing an ni j value. The authors redefine a scaled time and distance
earthquakes (equations 2.19 and 2.20) and introduce a method which calculates the cut-off
between background and clustered events based on these rescaled inter-event distance and
inter-event time equations (Zaliapin and Ben-Zion, 2013a,b).
Tj = (t j ti?)10bmi?/2 (2.19)
R j = r
i? j10
bmi?/2 (2.20)
Plotting log R against log T identifies two clear populations as seen in Figure 2.9b. The top
right group corresponds to background seismicity and the bottom left group corresponds to
clustered seismicity. In order to remove the need for the ambiguous nc of Baiesi and Paczuski
(2004), a dividing line is estimated from the log nearest-neighbour distance-frequency graph,
with the value being equal to an estimate of the cross-over of the two mixture model fits. An
application of this method is shown for a synthetic catalogue obtained by running the ETAS
model in Figure 2.9a. The upper diagram illustrates the bimodality, a clear minimum between
the two populations, and the problem that often arises with the uncertainty in choosing nc.
More formally, the value can be calculated by the Expectation Maximisation approach (Zaliapin
and Ben-Zion, 2013a,b).
In the method of Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2013a,b) earthquakes are separated into cluster
families using a spanning tree, similar to the one created using the SLC. The earthquakes are all
linked to one another by the nearest-neighbour distance, ni j = Ti jRi j. This creates a network
which links all the earthquakes in the catalogue with each edge having a weight equal to the
nearest-neighbour distance. The links between event i and j are then severed if ni j > nc (in
the example case, nc = 105.4). This then separates the network into many smaller networks
that are no longer linked to each other, with some earthquakes no longer linked to any other
earthquakes. Those that are in the smaller trees are the cluster families, and those that are
completely independent are background events. The output of families of clustered events is a
significant advantage of this method, because it produces more detail on the type of clustering.
The Zaliapin et al. (2008); Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2013a,b) method is a good declustering
method, but there are aspects which introduce uncertainty. One example is the use of the
b-value when scaling for Ti j and Ri j. For tectonic areas, the b-value tends to remain around 1,
however, for volcanic areas, the b-value can change with time; for example on the approach to
an eruption (Frohlich and Davis, 1993; McNutt, 2005; Roberts et al., 2016). It is unclear how the
method of Zaliapin and Ben-Zion accounts for these changes. Again, this is a technique devel-
oped on the southern California earthquake catalogue which may not be applicable to other
areas. Additionally, identifying the interception of the two mixture models in the bimodal dis-
tribution may also be an issue in certain cases. Often, the trough between the two peaks is not
clear, and there may be significant overlap between the two populations. Recently published
work by Bayliss et al. (2019) instead suggests using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) meth-
ods to model the best fitting Weibull distributions and using probabilistic networks to identify
clusters.
An alternative method is that of Touati et al. (2011) which does not use the nearest-neighbour
distribution and instead uses the plot of R against T, removing the magnitude scaling and just
plotting the inter-event time and inter-event distance between the nearest neighbours on a
map diagram. An example of the result is plotted for an ETAS simulation in Figure 2.10b. Note
this time there is no bimodality in the unscaled nearest-neighbour distance (Figure 2.10a).
However, Touati et al. noted that, even with the magnitude scaling removed, two distinct
groups remain on the map (Figure 2.10b) with the independent, background seismicity lying in
the top right corner of the plot and the clustered seismicity in the bottom left - compare Figure
2.10b to Figure 2.9b. Removing the scaling leaves the nearest-neighbour distribution with two
less clear peaks, but a bimodal distribution may still be identified (Figure 2.10b). By removing
the magnitude scaling, uncertainties associated with the magnitude and b-value have lower
impact, and the method is simplified. The method was developed on a synthetic ETAS cata-
logue, so in principle should be applicable to any earthquake catalogue which has mainshock-
aftershock sequences. However, it may not be as easily applied to catalogues which contain
swarm-type sequences, and a degree of subjectivity is introduced when the line is plotted
through by eye.

2.3.5 CURATE
Only a few techniques have been developed specifically for identifying swarm sequences in
volcanic areas, here I explore the CURATE algorithm of Jacobs et al. (2013), developed on the
Central Volcanic Region of New Zealand.
The CURATE method identifies the swarms of earthquakes by calculating the average daily
earthquake rate for the catalogue and selects only the earthquakes in the catalogue that occur
at a rate greater than this. It then looks for spatial links between them. A flow chart illustrat-
ing the steps taken to decluster the catalogue is shown in Figure 2.11. Potential sequences are
identified by selecting events which deviate from the predicted event rate - when the time be-
tween two consecutive earthquakes is less than 1/mean rate. Visually this can be seen in Figure
2.12 which plots the predicted event rate (black line), the cumulative event rate (red line) and
the deviations from the predicted event rate (blue line) for the seismicity in the MER. Any posi-
tive slope in the CURATE line is a potential sequence. Following on from the first identification
of potential sequences temporally, the earthquakes are then spatially linked. Similar to the
window methods, a critical distance is chosen to separate the two populations based on the
tectonic setting. A mean location is then found for each potential sequence and earthquakes
that are further away than the critical distance are removed from the potential sequences. In
addition to the critical distance, a critical time is also included. If two sequences are in a sim-
ilar locality and are within a certain number of days apart, it is assumed the two are causally
related and are therefore merged into a single sequence. Finally, a boundary rule is applied.
This assumes earthquakes outside of the area you are studying may have triggered sequences
within your area. The inclusion of these earthquakes leads to more complete clusters as the
critical time and distance may be altered by these events.
CURATE had more success in identifying clusters than the other declustering algorithms
Jacobs et al. also applied; the window method (Gardner and Knopoff, 1974), the single link
method (Frohlich and Davis, 1990), (Reasenberg, 1985) and a probabilistic method (Zhuang
et al., 2002). However, all of these methods with the exception of the stochastic decluster-
ing algorithm (Zhuang et al., 2002), have arbitrarily defined parameters and changing these
parameters can vary the number of clusters and the size of the declustered catalogue consid-
erably. The stochastic declustering method of Zhuang et al. (2002) is based on synthetic data

with known causality from ETAS simulations and identifies mainshock-aftershock sequences
without making a priori assumptions of the spatial and distal interactions of the earthquakes.
However, for a volcanic setting such as the CVR, one cannot compare the performance of the
ETAS-based algorithm of Zhuang et al. (2002) to that of CURATE.
The application of CURATE solely to areas with swarm sequences highlights the need for a
more comprehensive clustering method, one that works in all settings. The CURATE method in-
corporates aspects of the window method by adding a critical distance and time. Their specific
values will depend on the location and will need to change with each earthquake catalogue.
In principle, optimal clustering algorithms should have no parameters assumed a priori.
2.3.6 Methods based on automated machine learning
Finally, more recently, methods used in statistics for clustering using machine learning, such
as those tested on the iris flower dataset of Fisher (1936) and Anderson (1936), have been
applied to earthquakes. The iris dataset consists of 150 flower measurements (petal width,
petal length, sepal width and sepal height) for three species of iris - Setosa, Virginica and Ver-
sicolor - with 50 measurements of each species in the dataset. Setosa has measurements
that are clearly separated from both Virginica and Versicolor, whereas Virginica and Versicolor
have a lot of overlapping characteristics. Therefore, automated machine learning algorithms
are tested to see if they can separate and cluster all three species. The clustering techniques
developed on this dataset have been expanded to cluster earthquakes. However, one of the
issues with using machine learning to identify clusters of earthquakes is that we have not al-
ready defined the clusters, therefore unsupervised learning must be used. Other declustering
algorithm are intuitively based on properties of the earthquake catalogue; e.g. distance be-
tween events, time between events, magnitude. However, at present, most algorithms used
cannot work in 3 or 4 dimensions (due to the so-called curse of dimensionality). Therefore
current earthquake clustering analyses conducted have had to reduce the earthquake cata-
logue purely to location (Rehman et al., 2014; Kamat and Kamath, 2017; Novianti et al., 2017).
One popular technique is k-means clustering which has been tried with varying degrees
of success on earthquake catalogues (Wattimanela et al., 2015; Shang et al., 2018). The algo-
rithm works by finding centroids of a previously determined n clusters (either through a prior
knowledge of the number of clusters expected, or through estimating the number of clusters
from the inertia - Figure 2.13) and then assigning each data point to its nearest cluster by Eu-
clidean distance. This separates the points into a Voronoi diagram. The new centroid is then
calculated from these clusters; and again each data point is then assigned to its nearest mean.
These steps are repeated until the centroids do not change. K-means is an efficient clustering
technique and works well with unsupervised learning. However, it has its disadvantages. K-
means works towards creating clusters of equal area; for an earthquake catalogue we cannot
make this assumption. Again, there is the problem of it only clustering in 2D, but this may be
resolved by working with a space-time conversion, such as the one used in the SLC (Davis and
Frohlich, 1991b).
As the clusters are not already assigned, the k-means clustering algorithm is an example of
unsupervised learning. To decide on the best number of clusters I ran the k-means clustering
algorithm over a variety of cluster sizes, from one to 50. For each of these models the inertia
Figure 2.13  A graph showing the inertia against the number of clusters. Inertia is a measure of the spread of
clusters, the lower the inertia, the better the clustering. It is a measure of the distance from each event to the
centroid of the cluster, k-means works to minimise this for every event until they are assigned to the best cluster.
(within-cluster sum-of-squares criterion) is then calculated (Equation 2.21).
min(||xi j||2) (2.21)
The inertia is indicative of the quality of the clustering and is a measure of spread of the
clusters, or, more accurately, the distance from each event to the centroid of its assigned clus-
ter. K-means works to minimise this distance, for each event, until it is in the cluster with
the closest centroid. A plot of inertia against number of clusters (Figure 2.13 - for the Main
Ethiopian Rift earthquake catalogue) shows the rapid decrease in inertia as we increase the
number of clusters before it starts to steady. Good clustering in statistics has low inertia but
too many clusters is problematic. Therefore, the "elbow" of the inertia plot, where it changes
from a steep gradient to a more shallow gradient is thought to be the ideal number of clusters.
From Figure 2.13 this number is around about 10. We can then apply k-means clustering using
10 as the set number of cluster families.
2.4 Conclusions
Throughout this chapter I have explored a number of clustering techniques, discussed the
origins of the cluster families and the problems associated with applying these methodolo-
gies to the Main Ethiopian Rift. The ideal technique should be successful at clustering both
mainshock-aftershock and swarm-type sequences, have no a priori assumptions and should
be simple and efficient to use. In the following chapter I present a new method which is based
on the work of Touati et al. (2011), expanding it so it will work on catalogues with both types
of sequences and introducing an Automated Line Plotting Saddlepoint (ALPS) algorithm which
will remove the subjectivity, making the algorithm reproducible and efficient whilst also mak-
ing no a priori assumptions. This technique will allow us to identify cluster families within the
Main Ethiopian Rift and separate the families into their respective volcanic and tectonic ori-
gins, thus quantifying the state of unrest at these volcanoes. The method has been developed
on synthetic catalogues and thus, in principle, can be used globally. By implementing the clus-
ter family algorithm and producing residual declustered catalogues we can have an impact on
time-independent and time-dependent probabilistic hazard forecasting and risk mitigation in
many parts of the world subject to a mixture of tectonic and volcanic seismicity.
Chapter 3
Methods
In the previous chapter I discussed the current popular clustering methods, their advantages
and disadvantages and identified the ideal properties of a good clustering method. To sum-
marise the method must preferably:
 use as few parameters as possible whilst still maintaining accuracy (thus reducing the
uncertainty),
 have no a priori assumptions,
and must,
 be able to cluster earthquakes which are in both mainshock-aftershock sequences and
swarm-type sequences.
In this chapter I introduce a new method which fulfils all of these criteria whilst also being
automated. Automating the algorithm has further advantages such as reproducibility, objec-
tivity and efficiency. The majority of earthquake catalogues can be read into the function which
then identifies and outputs the cluster families and the declustered catalogue of independent
events.
First, I briefly reintroduce the methods of Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2013a,b) and Touati et al.
(2011) which I have expanded upon to create my new method. I then discuss the method in
detail - the reasoning behind it and logical steps which the code runs through, and the varia-
tions I have implemented within the code in order for it to be as accurate as possible, whilst
also adding some flexibility within the method. Finally, I conclude this chapter by validating
the method by comparing it to synthetic tectonic and volcanic-tectonic catalogues where the
cluster families are known. I test the sensitivity of the method to the cut-off magnitude and
to the placement of the dividing line.
3.1 Background to new method
Many clustering methods are already available, but, most of these were developed using the
seismicity in southern California. One of the few exceptions is the CURATE method which was
developed for the Central Volcanic Zone in New Zealand (Jacobs et al., 2013). For the RiftVolc
project, the challenge was to cluster earthquakes which are located within an active conti-
nental rift, the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER). The mixed sources of earthquakes, from processes
related to volcanoes - dyke emplacement, hydrothermal activity - to earthquake-earthquake
triggering on the faults, creates many overlapping sequences. This leads to the masking of
earthquakes as we can have events in many different families interspersed with background
events within a short period of time. We define a cluster family as a set of causally-related
earthquakes, either due to the sharing of the same underlying process, or through one earth-
quake triggering another.
The majority of clustering techniques are based around the inter-event times and inter-
event distances. Background events typically have larger inter-event times and inter-event
distances than those that are clustered. The differences are sufficient enough that when plot-
ted in 2D space, there is a clear separation between the two. One of the most popular, recent
clustering algorithms to use inter-event times and inter-event distances is Zaliapin and Ben-
Zion (2013a) (subsection 2.3.4), as it has the advantage of not specifying parameters which
are unique to the dataset from which the method was developed. However, there are a few
drawbacks which mean the method is not ideal for clustering earthquakes in active continen-
tal rifts. In the first instance, the b-value is included in Equations 2.19 and 2.20 (Chapter 2).
Typically in tectonic areas this is around unity (Frohlich and Davis, 1993), but near volcanoes it
can vary from values less than one to values as high as two or three, sometimes changing on
the approach to an eruption (McNutt, 2005; Roberts et al., 2016). For active continental rifts,
the b-value will not be consistent across the area studied, I choose not to include this in the

equations. Furthermore, Touati et al. (2011) also found that for the non-rescaled log nearest-
neighbour plots, a high seeding rate can lead to the masking of the bimodality (Figure 2.10a,
subsection 2.3.4). Touati et al. (2011) also noted, that despite this, when the scaling is removed,
plotting the inter-event time and inter-event distances of the nearest-neighbours (closest pairs
of events in time and space) on a 2D map will lead to a clear divide (Figure 2.9b versus Figure
2.10b, subsection 2.3.4). Again in the MER, an area with the potential to have many overlap-
ping clusters, it is likely that this will lead to a lack of clear bimodality in the non-rescaled log
nearest-neighbour plots.
For my method, I have removed all aspects of scaling from the equations of Zaliapin and
Ben-Zion (2013a) and simply use the inter-event time (IET) and distance (IER). In contrast to
previous methods, I have also removed the restriction of only using nearest-neighbours, as
this can lead to events being missed from the clusters (Zaliapin et al., 2008; Touati et al., 2011;
Zaliapin and Ben-Zion, 2013a,b; Bayliss et al., 2019). Figure 3.2 illustrates a simulated scenario
where we have many overlapping sequences mixed with background events. In this case, just
using the nearest-neighbours may miss the later earthquakes in the sequences. Instead, I ex-
pand my method to include all earthquake pairs. From the example we can see how increasing
Figure 3.2  Three clusters (blue, red and light blue lines) and background events (green lines) are plotted through
time. There is a high degree of overlap within the sequences. In relation to the first event we increase the event
number difference,  , and show how as we increase  the events that are hidden within other sequences are iden-
tified as linked to the first event (triggered - black double headed arrow). These pairs of events would lie on
the left hand side of the line in Figure 3.1. The independent light grey double headed arrow is between pairs of
events that would fall on the right hand side of the line as they are not linked.
the event number difference,  , leads to event 0 (zero) being identified as linked to earth-
quakes 5 and 7 and thus included in the earthquake family.
I can therefore define the IET and IER equations, where the event number difference be-
tween the earthquake pairs is  ;
IET = ti+  ti (3.1)
IER = ri+  ri (3.2)
And thus can be expressed as a matrix containing an IET and an IER for earthquake pairs
for all  . From here, I take the logarithm (base 10) of these values and plot them against
one another, using only the earthquake pairs when  = 1. As predicted, a clear divide can
be seen between two components, both in the ETAS simulation of Figure 3.1 and in the real-
world dataset of southern California (Figure 3.3) (Hauksson et al., 2012). On the left hand side,
we have the smaller IETs and IERs that I termed linked earthquakes. These earthquakes are
causally-related, this may be by being triggered by the same underlying process - such as in a
hydrothermal system - or through earthquake-earthquake triggering. This set of event pairs
may represent a single cluster, or be broken down into families of sub-clusters with different
properties, depending on the degree to which these are mixed. On the right hand side are the
independent events - events which are not related to other earthquakes.

using the automated line plotting saddlepoint (ALPS) algorithm and divides the two modes of seismicity (linked and
background). Colourbar is the density of points.
As in Zaliapin et al. (2008), I use a line to divide the two modes. In contrast, instead of
using the cross-over of the two mixture models in the log nearest-neighbour plot, I calculate
the line directly from the 2D histogram. I contour the points using a Gaussian Kernel Density
Estimation (Wand and Jones, 1995) and a saddle point can be seen between the two modes
of seismicity (Figure 3.4). The line is consequently plotted through the saddle axis. In order
to achieve this, several new Python functions were developed. These needed to be adaptable
and work across all datasets, including the situations when we only have one inner contour or
when the points within the valley are sparse.

ing to density, the higher the density of points, the brighter the colour. A Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation is used
for contouring.
3.2 Calculating the optimal dividing line
Despite there being a number of natural analogies for this problem, such as rivers flowing
through valleys, there is currently no function that exists to determine where a line would fit,
therefore I had to develop new functions. Many different options were considered. Unsuper-
vised learning was considered using k-means (subsection 2.3.6) which minimises the distance
from every point to the centroid of a group. By choosing two groups, k-means would split the
graph in two. However, upon testing this method, in Figure 3.5a we can see it does not suc-
cessfully split the dataset along the saddle point axis (Figure 3.5b). This is due to the k-means
algorithm creating clusters of equal area, which is not the case for this problem.
Therefore, the best approach is to use the contours directly. The IET-IER plots can consis-
tently be contoured and the number of levels can be manually adjusted to enable the most
accurate plotting of the line. Too many contours and we risk over-fitting the data, too few and
there is no clear saddlepoint. In catalogues with a strong background component, I found by
trial and error that the ideal number of contours is between 30 and 50. If there is a fairly even
distribution between the background and linked modes, as seen in the EAGLE dataset, a lower
number of contours is more suitable. In Figure 3.7, the contours of various real-world datasets
have been plotted. We can see that each plot is different, some have more than two inner

contours (Figure 3.7h), the relative heights (in the y-axis) of the centre of the inner contours
changes (Figure 3.7c vs Figure 3.7e ) and finally the orientation of the saddle point axis changes.
The algorithm must therefore take into account all of these differences, and still work effec-
tively. As the top half of the contours tend to minima at the saddle point axis, so the bottom
contours tend to maxima. Fundamentally, the method uses the minimum distance between
these upper (top) and lower (bottom) contours to plot the line, and thus I have named the
method the Automated Line Plotting Saddlepoint (ALPS) algorithm.
In order to explain the terminology used in this section, I refer to Figure 3.6, on which I show
the outer contours, the top and bottom contours, the vertices and the innermost contours.
The function which plots the line can be simply divided into four steps which are set out
in Figure 3.8. First we need to identify the outer contours only as these are the ones which
lead to the saddle point axis. Secondly, as contours are stored as continuous paths, we need
to separate the top from the bottom contours. The next step is to calculate the points on
the top vectors - which constitute the contours - that are closest to the bottom contours, and
vice versa. Finally, we can use these to plot the line. I explain these steps in more detail below,
Figure 3.6  Diagram explaining the terminology when discussing contours. Only shown are the outer contours,
weve removed the inner contours which form the two peaks for clarity. The top contours are shown in green, the
bottom contours in blue. The innermost contours are labelled. The circles are the vertices, the paths are drawn
between them.

as no diamonds were outside of the standard deviations.
3.2.1 Identify only the outer contours
From Figure 3.7, the challenge is clear. Each of the datasets produces a set of contours which
differ significantly from one another. Figures 3.7a - e and 3.7g all have the same number of
contour levels (30), but we have a wide range of catalogue sizes, both in terms of number of
events and the time period covered. For example, the Southern California Earthquake Center
(SCEC) catalogue covers a ten year time period from 01/01/2000 - 01/01/2010 and there is
a strong background component. During this period, there were no earthquakes of >M7.0.
Yet three months earlier on 16/10/1999 there was the M7.1 Hector Mine earthquake and four
months after this period on 04/04/2010 there was the M7.2 Baja earthquake. This lack of large
mainshock-aftershock sequences may have contributed to the relatively small component of
linked earthquakes on the bottom left of the plot compared to the other catalogues.
The Tjrnes Fracture Zone (TFZ), northern Iceland and Reykjanes Ridge, south-western Ice-
land, at first glance, may look similar, but if we compare Figure 3.7a vs 3.7b in more detail, they
do have small differences. For example, in the Reykjanes Ridge (3.7b), the background compo-
nent is slightly higher in the y-direction than the linked component, leading to the saddle point
axis being at an angle compared to the TFZ (3.7a). This difference is even more pronounced
when we compare Tullu Moye, a volcano within the MER (3.7c), with the whole of the MER
(3.7e). The line plotting algorithm must be able to cope with all these differences. Addition-
ally, there are parameters that can be manually changed by the user which will improve the
accuracy, further information for which can be found in the subsection 3.2.5, but I will briefly
mention one here. In Figures 3.7e versus 3.7f and 3.7g versus 3.7h, the effect of increasing the
number of levels of contours can be seen. Both the New Zealand and the MER datasets will
provide a more accurate line with more outer contours. However, a new contour level forms
in between the two main peaks in Figure 3.7h. To summarise, the catalogues all produce con-
tours which look slightly different from one another and the line plotting algorithm must take
into account all of these differences with as little input from the user as possible. The user can
change parameters which may help improve the line fit but the code must compute the line
to the best of its ability first.
The first step in plotting the line is selecting only the outer contours as these are the ones
that form the distinct valley. The contours themselves are saved as paths and pairs of vertices.
So very simply we use the pairs of vertices to select the contours that have a maximum and a
minimum in the x and the y directions that is more extreme than the next set of contours (i.e.
the contours which completely surround the contour that is the next level down, Figure 3.8).
From here, we can then work on dividing each outer contour into a selection of top vertices
and bottom vertices.
3.2.2 Separate the top and bottom contours
Each contour level is stored as a path and pairs of vertices which are the Cartesian coordinates
of the beginning and the end of the path (see Figure 3.6 for a reminder of the terms). Therefore,
we need a method of separating the contour levels into vertices which are at the top and those
which are at the bottom. Once this is done, we can find the shortest distance between them.
This may sound simple, but consider that, although the human eye can clearly pick out which
will be the top and which will be the bottom, the process of writing a program to accomplish
this is considerably more complex. To solve this, the algorithm finds the centre of each of the
two peaks, draws a line between them and everything above this line is a top contour whilst
everything below this is a bottom contour. However, we do not want to include the vertices
which are the edges as these will inevitably be closest to one another and thus incorrectly
identified as the minimum, rather than the minimum we wish to identify which is the valley.
Therefore, we draw two perpendicular lines which run through the two centres (Figure 3.9).
Then we only select the pairs of vertices that are within these two bounding lines. The example
chosen uses the SCEC catalogue which is a simple example. The final algorithm will also be able
to deal with the following cases:
 where there is only one peak,
 when the minima of the top contour is so low it crosses the line dividing the top and
bottom contours, and vice versa, and,
 when a pair of vertices which is outside the two perpendicular bounding lines means a
path which forms a top contour would not be included.
From here, we can calculate the points on the top and bottom contours which are a mini-
mum distance from the opposing set of contours.
Figure 3.9  The outer contours of the Southern California earthquake catalogue. Contouring has 50 levels and uses
a Gaussian Kernel Density estimation. The red line joins the two centres of the peaks, marked by crosses and the
blue and green lines which run perpendicular to this are act as boundaries. All pairs of vertices between the two
are considered.
3.2.3 Calculate points which are the minimum distance away from opposing set of
contours
The code runs through each line formed by two pairs of vertices for each contour and it checks
every part of the contour with every other part of the contours on the opposite side (the top
contours are highlighted in green, the bottom contours in light blue). It calculates the minimum
distance between each pair of lines and this is entered into an array, along with the coordinates
of the point which is at the minimum distance (not necessarily a vertex). There is one array
for each set of contours, the minimum distance is found in each array and the coordinates for
this point are at the shortest distance for that particular contour. The black diamonds in Figure
3.10 represent these points for the bottom contours, and the yellow diamonds represent these
points for the top contours.
3.2.4 Plot the line
The final stage is to plot the line using these points. Very simply, we find the median of the
black and yellow diamond coordinates and plot a line between these two. However, for a
few of the catalogues there was occasionally a point in the contours paths not in the saddle
point axis which was identified as a point of minimum distance. Such anomalous points led
to the median changing which meant the line was not as accurately placed as it could be. To
combat this, the standard deviation of each median was used to establish an upper and lower
bounding line. Any black or yellow diamonds outside of these bounds was then discarded and
the medians were recalculated. From here the final line is plotted.
This is demonstrated in Figure 3.10 with the Southern California earthquake catalogue.
However, despite this algorithm working the majority of the time, in two of the datasets it
was found to be slightly out. As a consequence it was necessary to add variables into the func-
tion which allow the user to change various parameters in order to produce the most accurate
line. These are discussed in the following section.
Figure 3.10  The final steps of the line plotting algorithm as demonstrated on the Southern California earthquake
catalogue. The green lines and diamonds are the paths and vertices of the top contours, the light blue lines and
diamonds are the paths and vertices of the bottom contours. The yellow diamonds are the points on the top contours
which are closest to the bottom contours. The black diamonds on the points on the bottom contour which are closest
to the top contour. The purple crosses are the medians of these. The black line is the final line plotted. The red and
blue lines which are closest and running almost parallel to this line are the bounding lines which are each a standard
deviation away from the top and bottom medians.
3.2.5 A note on function variables
The IET_IER_line function which plots the dividing line has a number of parameters which
may be changed by the user in order to improve the plotting of the line (Listing 1). A few of the
variables (cat, g, IET_diff and datetime) prepare the dataset for plotting, but the remaining
parameters have a direct effect on the line.
def IET_IER_line(cat , g='WGS84', n_levels =20, IET_diff=1,
curve=False , use_innermost_contours_only=False , vertical=
False , datetime=True)
Listing 1  The arguments that are needed to be input into the function IET_IER_line by the user to plot the di-
viding line. The arguments are as follows; cat = catalogue in the form of a pandas dataframe, g = the reference
system for calculating the distance between events, n_levels = the number of contour levels, IET_diff = the
event number difference,  , curve = if False, will plot a single straight line, if True will plot three lines, one through
the bottom contours, one through the join between the top and bottom contours and one through the top con-
tours, use_innermost _contours _only = if True will only use the innermost outer contour for plotting the line,
vertical = if True will plot the bounding lines in Figure 3.9 as vertical and finally, datetime = if True the dates
are in the datetime format.
Consider starting with the argument vertical (this refers to the green and blue bounding
lines in Figure 3.9). In the case of some of the earthquake catalogues, the centres of the two
peaks may be vertically very different leading to a large sloping line, when the green and blue
lines are drawn perpendicular to this it can lead to vertices being missed especially on the
outermost contours. Therefore if vertical = True these lines are drawn vertically instead
of perpendicularly. This is demonstrated in Figure 3.11b.
Next we have use_innermost_contours_only. This is self-explanatory, instead of using
all outer contours, the inner most contours are the only ones used to plot the line. This is
particularly useful for datasets such as Tullu Moye (Figure 3.7c) where the outermost contours
do not form such a clear valley.
Finally we have the curve argument. This has not been used on any of our datasets but it
may be that the top and bottom contours are offset from one another. This would lead to a
straight line only fitting either the top or the bottom. By setting curve = True, a straight line
is drawn through the bottom contours, a line joins the innermost contours and then another
line is drawn through the top contours. This is a rough approach to the problem, and although
I attempted to use splines, they have not been very successful. This option has not yet been
needed for our datasets, so it has not been a priority but would be something that could be
improved in the future.
Through the testing of many catalogues, the best approach in using the line plotting algo-
rithm is to first run the dataset through using the default settings. However, if the line appears
to be inaccurate, I suggest first changing the number of contours (see Figure 3.7e and 3.7g ver-
sus 3.7f and 3.7g). After this, change the vertical and
use_innermost_contours_only arguments. Finally iterative adjustment of the functions
parameters can be done until the best fit is found.
3.3 Testing of method
Following the development of the algorithm, it was important to test and validate the method.
I have done this by firstly comparing the method to popular existing algorithms and secondly
by testing the sensitivity of the clustering to the placement of the line.
In terms of testing my algorithm in comparison to other methods currently available, my
approach was twofold.I first generated two synthetic catalogues, one representing mainshock-
aftershock sequences using an ETAS model, the second representing a volcano-tectonic cata-
logue with a mixture of mainshock-aftershock sequences and swarm-type sequences. Knowing
which events were clustered a priori, I then tested the performance of a selection of clustering
methods. Additionally, I tested the methods on the EAGLE catalogue, a real dataset consisting
of earthquakes in the MER. As mentioned earlier, the tectonic setting leads to a mixture of both
volcanic and tectonic earthquakes, so an ideal clustering method would be able to separate
them from each other and from the background seismicity. Therefore, further comparisons
could be drawn on the success of the various methods in clustering this catalogue.
3.3.1 Synthetic catalogues
The first test of the method I tried was applying it to catalogues generated using a spatiotem-
poral ETAS model. For this I used the code developed by Touati (2011). I translated the code
from R into Python 3 and made two significant changes. Firstly I changed the calculation of the
longitudes and latitudes so a distance in kilometres was not being added to a longitude and
latitude in decimal degrees. This increased the efficiency of the code as it was no longer gen-
erating events which were hundreds of kilometres outside of the designated area. Secondly,
I wrote some extra code which uses the purely spatiotemporal ETAS (see Section 2.2.3 for
Figure 3.11  Stages of the line plotting process with the vertical = True argument for the EAGLE dataset. (a)
The outer contours and the normally perpendicular bounding lines are vertical. (b) Colours same as Figure 3.10, the
result of the line plotting algorithm for the EAGLE dataset with vertical = True.

more information on ETAS and the equations used) to generate a volcano-tectonic catalogue
(Listing 2 and Table 3.1 gives a summary of the parameters used). A new function was also cre-
ated which generates random volcanoes with random higher b-values assigned to them and
a raised background rate. By combining this with Touatis ETAS code, a background catalogue
consisting of the spatiotemporal ETAS is generated, followed by smaller, separate catalogues
for the swarms. The two were merged to mimic the mixture of volcanic and tectonic seismicity
in active continental rifts. For the synthetic volcano-tectonic catalogue, five swarms were gen-
erated at five random volcanoes within the area. Each swarm is within a radius of between
10 and 20 km from the volcanic centre and has between 20 and 100 events. Additionally, the
number of events per day,  , is raised from 3 for the background catalogue to between 10 and
50 for the swarms, reflecting the difference in the event rate for different volcanoes (Benoit
and McNutt, 1996). The synthetic volcano-tectonic catalogues daily event rate plot in Figure
3.12 shows clearly the locations of the swarms temporally, reflected by steps in the cumula-
tive event rate (highlighted in light blue). It can also be seen in the IET-IER 2D histogram that a
clear divide remains between the clustered and background events, ensuring that this method
will work successfully on hybrid catalogues consisting of mainshock-aftershock sequences and
swarm-type sequences.
Following the creation of the two synthetic catalogues, five popular methods from the lit-
erature were run over both catalogues in addition to my own. I tried the window method
(subsection 2.3.1) - using the parameters from Gardner and Knopoff (1974), Uhrhammer (1986)
and Gruenthal (from van Stiphout et al. (2012)), CLUSTER2000 (subsection 2.3.2) (Reasenberg,
1985), Single Link Clustering (SLC, subsection 2.3.3) ) (Frohlich and Davis, 1990), CURATE (sub-
section 2.3.5) (Jacobs et al., 2013), Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2013a) (subsection 2.3.4) and Bayliss
et al. (2019).
The results are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4 but two of the key figures are included

here to validate my method. Figure 3.14 shows the comparison between clustering techniques
on the purely mainshock-aftershock synthetic catalogue. From the bar chart we can see the
most successful clustering algorithms are Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2013a,b), Bayliss et al. (2019)
and my clustering technique, the Automated Line Plotting Saddlepoint (ALPS) method. ALPS
successfully assigned the highest percentage of events to the correct cluster family and min-
imised the number of events that were initially in a cluster family and incorrectly identified
as background and vice versa. The accuracy decreases slightly but similar results are seen in
Figure 3.15 for the volcano-tectonic synthetic catalogue. Yet again, ALPS correctly identifies the
cluster families at a significantly higher rate, and, in comparison to the next two most success-
ful methods, Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2013a,b) and Bayliss et al. (2019), does not have the same
decrease in accuracy.
A more in depth discussion of these results can be found within the paper in the next chap-
ter, but, it is clear from this analysis that the ALPS method is more accurate at identifying
clusters than any current technique.

3.3.2 Comparison to current clustering methods
Having demonstrated the accuracy of my algorithm in comparison to other clustering methods
on synthetic data, I now compare the results of the different techniques on real data from the
EAGLE dataset (Keir et al., 2006). I used a dataset from outside southern California in order
to test the methods that were developed on earthquakes in southern California on a different
dataset. EAGLE was chosen as it has a mix of swarms and mainshock-aftershock seismicity and
has relatively few (1912) events, which reflects the restricted length of many catalogues where
temporary networks have been installed for the duration of a funded project.
Unlike the synthetic catalogues we do not know which events are dependent and indepen-
dent. However, the tectonic setting allows us to estimate where we would expect clusters of
seismicity to be. From Figure 2.1, the Ankober and North Arboye border fault systems are likely
to have a considerable amount of tectonic seismicity and mainshock-aftershock sequences. In
contrast, swarms are likely to be located closer to the volcanoes. From the locations of the
geothermal energy projects (Figure 2.1), the most hydrothermally active systems can be seen.
The movement of fluids and the brittle failure of cracks within the hydrothermal systems at
these volcanoes are the most likely source of swarm sequences.
Figure 3.16 shows the cluster families of the EAGLE catalogue identified by the Automated
Line Plotting Saddlepoint (ALPS) algorithm shown on maps of different scale. From the main
map (lower right) several cluster families occur within the main rift valley near the volcanoes
with additional clusters near the major border fault systems. The inset map (top left) highlights
in particular the identification of a number of different swarms between the volcanoes of Fen-
tale and Dofen in the north and near Tullu Moye and Aluto in the south, all sites of geothermal
projects. Additionally, there are many different families identified in the Ankober fault sys-
tem and near Oa Caldera which has ongoing fumarolic activity on the west side (Mohr et al.,
1980). The locations of the cluster families correspond with areas where we would expect to
see linked sequences, even though this information was not used in choosing the cluster fam-
ilies. For example, the faults in the Ankober system are likely to lead to mainshock-aftershock
sequences whereas we are more likely to see swarms associated with hydrothermal systems
at the volcanoes and associated geothermal plants.
I compare the clusters identified by the ALPS method to the popular clustering algorithms
Figure 3.16  The cluster families identified by the ALPS algorithm are represented by the coloured circles and the
white circles are the independent events. Volcanoes are marked by red triangles. Inset is a magnification of the
part of the map where most of the clusters lie.
used on the synthetic catalogues. Starting with the window method (Section 2.3.1), I use all
three of the most common equations for calculating the time and distance intervals. The equa-
tions of Gruenthal and Uhrhammer led only to a single cluster family (Figure 3.17a) and one
set of independent events (Figure 3.17b), respectively. This is inconsistent with the identifica-
tion of several clusters associated with known geological structures in the seismicity map of
Figure 3.16. I therefore suggest that these equations should not be used on catalogues other
than the ones they were initially tested upon. The method of Gardner and Knopoff (1974)
has more success, identifying clusters on the border fault systems and close to the volcanoes.
However, from the analysis on the synthetic catalogues (subsection 3.3.1), we know that the
method tends to over-cluster i.e. produce too many cluster families, and the earthquakes are
more likely to be in the wrong cluster family. We can draw some conclusions from the families
but it is likely that they are prone to error for the aforementioned reasons. In the case of the
method of Gardner and Knopoff (1974), we would likely include earthquakes that have been
triggered by other processes, and this could lead to spurious results if using the cluster families
for volcanic forecasting.
Next I consider the CLUSTER2000 (Reasenberg, 1985) method (subsection 2.3.2) which
builds on the window methods by taking into account triggering along faults and the decay
of aftershocks according to Omoris law, and hence theoretically should produce more accu-
rate clustering. As shown in Figure 3.19, we can see the clusters are much more constrained.
They are present between Fentale and Dofen and around Tullu Moye, as well as in a small area
- no more than 100km2 - near the Ankober faults. From Figures 3.14 and 3.15, the method
identified very few correct cluster families in the real-world data set.
I compare this to CURATE (Jacobs et al., 2013) (subsection 2.3.5) which was developed in the
Central Volcanic Region of North Island, New Zealand specifically to identify swarms. In theory
CURATE should identify the sequences around volcanoes well, but may struggle to find the
mainshock-aftershock sequences in the border faults regions. Potential swarms in the EAGLE
catalogue can be seen in Figure 2.12 (Chapter 2) as positive deviations from the predicted event
rate and where we should find a few swarm sequences. Figure 3.20 shows the results of the al-
gorithm, and the cluster families identified. CURATE performs as expected, finding the clusters
near Dofen and Fentale well, but it is missing a considerable number of the clusters identified
by ALPS. Again, if we look at Figures 3.14 and 3.15, CURATE performs poorly compared to ALPS,
producing far fewer clusters than are actually present and misidentifying clustered events as
independent.
I have also included the method of Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2013a,b) (subsection 2.3.4). It is
the second most successful clustering method after mine when clustering the synthetic cata-
logues and it performs well at identifying clusters in the MER (Figure 3.21). I show the Gaussian
mixture model fits, used to identify the cut-off nearest-neighbour distance, and the IET-IER plot
for the Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2013a,b) method, Figures 3.21a and 3.21b, respectively. However,
as discussed further in Chapter 4, the use of nearest-neighbours instead of all earthquake pairs
leads to the break-up of swarm sequences into smaller sequences when tested against the
volcano-tectonic catalogue. Therefore, the method of Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2013a,b) may
not accurately be representing the full swarm sequence, unlike ALPS which accurately identi-
fies the full swarm.
Having compared ALPS to current clustering methods, I conclude that ALPS is significantly
better at identifying the correct cluster families and independent events in the synthetic cat-
alogues, at least when compared to the likely locations of different cluster centres relative to
geological features. Therefore, we can postulate that it is likely that when ALPS is applied to
real-world datasets, the cluster families and independent events identified are true positives.
For the synthetic and real datasets considered in this chapter, ALPS has led to the most accu-
rate positive identification of clusters and independent events, while reducing the number of
false positives and negatives (Tables 1 and 2, Chapter 4).

3.3.3 Sensitivity of cluster identification to the line placement
The placement of the line is key to this clustering method, so it is important that we test this
placement to see how it affects the cluster families identified. I show the results of two con-
trasting datasets (Figure 3.23), the EAGLE catalogue which has a more vertical line placement
and is representative of a catalogue with strong clustering and background modes (Figure
3.23a), and the SCEC catalogue which is more typical of areas with a strong background mode,
a weaker clustering component and a more angled line (Figure 3.23b).
The line was moved between two end-member points, and the clustering method was
rerun with the new line placement. I then compared the clusters families and independent
events identified from the new line with the initial clustered catalogue based on ALPS esti-
mate of the line. Figure 3.23a shows the results of moving the line for the EAGLE catalogue of
Keir et al. (2006). The percentage of independent events which remain correctly identified as
independent stays relatively constant. The events tend to stay in the same cluster, significantly
changing only when the line is closer to the left-most end-member. As we move the separating
line closer towards this mode, we are including more clustered events within the background
mode. It will therefore incorrectly classify more events as independent, in addition to changing
which earthquake pairs are identified as linked, thus changing the cluster families.
A similar result may be seen in Figure 3.23b. This demonstrates that no matter what the
strength of the clustering mode is, as we move the line towards it, we still see a decrease in the
number of events remaining in the same cluster family, though the magnitude of the decrease
is smaller.
To conclude, the accuracy of the identification of modes is relatively sensitive to the place-
ment of the line, but it does allow for some margin of error where any differences are small.
It does not matter whether the catalogue has a strong clustered component or not, the line
placement affects the clustering most significantly when it moves towards the clustered mode.
Verifying the sensitivity of the placement of the line to the subsequent clustering has further
supported the strength of the ALPS methodology. From the synthetic catalogue testing, we
know ALPS has an accuracy of at least 90% when identifying true positives, and from testing
the effect of moving the line placement, I can be confident that the method remains reliable
even with some movement in the placement of the line.

3.3.4 Sensitivity to magnitude cut-off
One aspect of earthquake catalogues which differs significantly between datasets is the min-
imum magnitude of the catalogue. In some cases, the network is not sensitive enough to
record the lower magnitudes and the minimum magnitude is limited by the set-up of the seis-
mometers. Often for some analyses the catalogue needs to be complete, therefore in this case
the minimum magnitude of the data used in the analysis is equal to the magnitude of com-
pleteness. In order to be confident in the clustering method, we must know that it finds the
same cluster families, even if we are missing events as they are below the magnitude cut-off
chosen for the catalogue. Thus, I have tested my method using the EAGLE catalogue. The
EAGLE catalogue is a hybrid mixture of volcano-tectonic seismicity and we see many differ-
ent cluster families which are close spatio-temporally. If we raise the magnitude cut-off the
events should stay within their cluster families, and not move to a different family when we
lose events from the catalogue. From the box and whisker magnitude plots in Figure 3.24,
each of the datasets used within this thesis have a spread of magnitudes. The SCEC catalogue
and Iceland catalogues have no lower outliers on this plot as I have constrained these two
catalogues to above M2 and M0.1, respectively. M2 is the magnitude of completeness for the
SCEC catalogue and 0.1 is a minimum magnitude chosen for Iceland. I have chosen to use the
EAGLE dataset (Figure 3.24) to investigate the effect of the magnitude cut-off on the cluster-
ing as it has a large interquartile range, and the fewest outliers outside the whiskers (1.5 of
the interquartile range). Additionally, the box and whisker plot encompasses the majority of
the magnitude ranges of the other datasets, so we can consider the magnitude spread to be
representative of all the catalogues used in this thesis. Furthermore, this is a wide range of
magnitudes within a relatively small area geographically and includes a mixture of volcanic
and tectonic seismicity. We can therefore investigate the effect of changing the magnitude on
the overlapping clusters identified by ALPS in Figure 3.16.
I raised the minimum magnitude from M0.1 to M2.75. The lower threshold of 0.1 will include
the small magnitude seismicity recorded around volcanoes, and after M2.75, there were too
few events to identify clusters. A small spatiotemporal window was selected around Dofen
and Fentale volcanoes and the Ankober BF system as this is an area with many overlapping
clusters whilst also being representative of both volcanic and tectonic seismicity. The number

of clustered events rapidly decreases as we increase the minimum magnitude in the Dofen
and Fentale window, dropping significantly above a threshold magnitude of 1.5 (Figure 3.25).
However, earthquakes are being assigned to the same clusters, albeit to cluster families with
fewer events. The earthquakes are not reassigned to a different cluster or merged to form
larger families. Therefore, the cluster identification algorithm reduces the cluster family size
with a change in the magnitude cut-off used, but does not lead to different cluster families.
Finally, the magnitude cut-off chosen is inherently associated with the size of the catalogue
- as you lower the magnitude, more events are included. Therefore, by extension, through
testing the magnitude cutoff, we are also testing the effect the size of the catalogue has on the
clustering. Through this testing we found the ALPS method will only be able to run if it is able
to contour the data points, which required a minimum catalogue size of at least 80. Ideally,
the catalogue should be larger than this in order to draw meaningful conclusions.

catalogue. The colourbar shows the cluster family, note the same cluster families are not the same colour in each

3.4 Conclusions
The Automated Line Plotting Saddlepoint (ALPS) method successfully identifies sets or modes
of dependent (clustered) and independent events in synthetic earthquake catalogues where
the causal relationships are known. It outperforms commonly-used methods by identifying
more true positives and negatives for both modes. This holds both for synthetic catalogues
modelling (a) mainshock-aftershock tectonic sequences using the ETAS model and (b) volcanic
swarm sequences caused by a locally-elevated increase in event rate without an obvious main-
shock, but including some earthquake-earthquake triggering. In this sense ALPS is more versa-
tile than commonly used methods developed solely for a single type of seismicity (aftershocks
or swarms) and/or for a single testing zone.
The ALPS algorithm is an automated procedure, with the significant advantages of being
more efficient and reproducible than current methods, whilst also the improving the accuracy.
It fulfilled its design criteria in requiring as few parameters as possible whilst still maintaining
accuracy in the assignment of clusters and cluster families. The tests on synthetic catalogues
proved ALPS is successful in doing so - the ALPS algorithm identifies the greatest percentage
of true positives for clustered and independent events for synthetic aftershock and swarm-
type catalogues when compared to alternate methods. It also correctly identified more clus-

The method is robust to small differences in the optimal location of the dividing line be-

4.1 Introduction
This paper introduces our method, discussing why current clustering methods are not the best
solution to clustering seismicity in volcano-tectonic areas, and why our method was developed
to solve this problem. We validate the method on synthetic catalogues and following on from
this, apply the Automated Line Plotting Saddlepoint (ALPS) algorithm to real-world datasets.
Finally, we investigate the cluster families further, inferring the processes leading to the cluster
families.

Abstract
Earthquake populaons are bimodal - separated into sets of independent and
dependent events. Dependent events are generally more clustered in space and
me, but it is not always possible to idenfy these denively. Here, we intro-
duce a new clustering method which uses an automated line plong saddle-
point (ALPS) algorithm to separate the two modes of seismicity. We validate the
method using two synthec catalogues where the causal relaonships are known.
The synthec catalogues emulate the behaviour of a convenonal tectonically ac-
ve zone and that from a volcano-tectonic seng. We compare our method to
current popular clustering methodologies applied to the same synthec datasets
and nd our method is the most successful at separang the cluster families from
the set of independent events. We then run ALPS over three real-world datasets:
the Southern California Earthquake Center catalogue, the Ethiopian-Afar Geosci-
enc Lithospheric Experiment catalogue and seismicity recorded in the North Is-
land of New Zealand. We nd cluster families of both swarm type and mainshock-
aershock type seismicity and use the results to infer the underlying processes
which have triggered the earthquakes in these families. Most importantly, we nd

ALPS works over a variety of dataset sizes, characterising both volcanic and tec-
tonic earthquakes. It is ecient, reproducible and makes no a priori assumpons

. Introducon
Earthquakes can be separated into two categories, clustered (dependent) and
background (independent) events. The background events form the basis for
probabilisc seismic hazard assessment, which commonly assumes a Poisson pro-
cess of independent events (Giardini et al., ) and the clustered events are
groups of earthquakes, or families, where earthquakes are causally-related to one
another. This may be through one earthquake triggering another, or through an
underlying mechanism - such as dyke emplacement. Earthquakes that are linked
have small inter-event mes and inter-event distances, and this property is the ba-
sis for many clustering methods, including our own (Gardner and Knopo, ;
Reasenberg, ; Frohlich and Davis, ; Baiesi and Paczuski, ; Zaliapin
et al., ; Jacobs et al., ). The majority of these methods have been devel-
oped on the earthquakes recorded in Southern California and work well on sep-
arang events that are in mainshock-aershock sequences from the background
earthquakes. However Jacobs et al. () noted that for areas with swarm se-
quences the methods developed in Southern California (Gardner and Knopo,
; Frohlich and Davis, ; Zhuang et al., ) do not successfully idenfy
the families of swarms. Here we dene a swarm as clusters of earthquakes that
lack an obvious mainshock and that are typically linked causally due to sharing the
same underlying process as opposed to each other due to earthquake-earthquake
triggering (Hill, ; Zhang and Shearer, ). The Cumulave Rate Analysis
(CURATE) method developed by Jacobs et al. () worked well on separang
the swarm events from the background in the Central Volcanic Region of North
Island, New Zealand where the other methods failed. Nevertheless, we cannot
always simply divide all areas of localised high seismic acvity into end-member
classes of mainshock-aershock sequences or swarm sequences. For example, in
areas such as the Main Ethiopian Ri (MER) we have both types of earthquake
triggering.
The MER has large border faults running parallel to the ri axis and perpen-
dicular to the direcon of spreading. These border faults bound the ri oor
which has a series of magmac segments containing en-echelon style faults run-
ning along the central ri axis (Figure ) (Hayward and Ebinger, ; Keir et al.,
; Abebe et al., ). This leads to mixed origins of the seismicity; there are
less-systemac swarms that can occur synchronously with accelerang foreshock
sequences and/or mainshock-aershock sequences. The compeng tectonic and
magmac processes can lead to overlapping earthquake sequences which are
both temporally and spaally constrained. The magmacally-generated processes
can also involve secondary hydrothermal uid circulaon, and are not restricted
to the movement or emplacement of magma at depth (see for example Figure
 for locaons of potenal and exisng geothermal power plants as a proxy for
acve hydrothermal systems in the MER). In acve connental ris, where vol-
canic seismicity is mixed with, or even hidden by, tectonic events, it is important
to make the disncon between volcanic and tectonic earthquakes so we can re-
liably idenfy only those clusters related to volcanoes to forecast their erupon

me. Therefore, if we can separate the events into cluster families - where we
dene a cluster family to be a group of causally-related earthquakes - we can in-
vesgate these clusters further to discern their origins. Events within the same
family may have been triggered by one another, or by a common underlying pro-
cess, such as a geothermal processes near volcanoes .
Here, we use the D distribuon of inter-event mes and inter-event dis-
tances to separate earthquakes which are linked and those earthquakes which
are independent - which we dene as not being linked to another earthquake in
the catalogue. Toua et al. () found that by plong the nearest-neighbour
inter-event me (IET) against the inter-event distance (IER), the two modes of
seismicity, background and linked, can be separated in space, inially for syn-
thec data produced by the epidemic-type aershock sequence (ETAS) model of
Ogata (). Natural tectonic earthquake data also show the same characteris-
cs, with increasing cross-over of the two populaons as the background event
rate increases (Toua et al., ). The background seismicity has longer inter-
event mes and inter-event distances, whereas the linked seismicity has much
shorter inter-event mes and inter-event distances. The dierence between the
two modes in some cases is sucient that they can be separated by a clear line. In-
stead of using nearest-neighbours of consequent events, we expand the method
to consider all inter-event mes and distance. The movaon is to more clearly
idenfy clusters with a common underlying cause that is not necessarily related to
the previous earthquake. This leads to earthquakes that may have been masked
previously by other clusters, being found and assigned to their correct cluster fam-
ily. Furthermore, we use an automated line plong algorithm for the division be-
tween the two groups, whose design is informed by applicaon to synthec data
where the causal relaonships are known.
We have already stated that earthquakes can be broadly split into two cate-
gories, those which are background events and those which are clustered. Back-
ground, or independent events, can be modelled mathemacally as a Poisson ran-
dom process (Vere-Jones, ; Gardner and Knopo, ). In addion we have
clustered events, which we term linked. Here we further disnguish between
the dierent types of linked events. We examine clusters from (a) mainshock-
aershock sequences which are earthquake-earthquake triggered, and (b) clus-
ters of swarm type, where the earthquakes share a common underlying triggering
process. Following Toua et al. (), the mainshock-aershock sequences fol-
low the epidemic-type aershock sequence (ETAS) model whereas the swarms
are families of linked earthquakes with no obvious mainshock and are modelled
here by a me-dependent Poisson process.
We start by describing the ETAS model and how current clustering methods
use the principles of ETAS to separate background events from clustered ones.
We explore how the most popular methods work and why they oen fail on earth-
quake catalogues containing both cluster types (swarm and mainshock-aershock).
We then introduce our new method, and show that it removes the a priori as-
sumpons used in some of the previous clustering methods by using an auto-
mated algorithm, and succeeds in separang all types of seismicity (background
and linked; both mainshock-aershock and swarm). We validate our method
by generang synthec tectonic and volcano-tectonic catalogues using a me-
dependent ETAS model and demonstrate that our method successfully idenes
the clusters and independent events in both, and at a signicantly higher rate
than the methods used at the moment. Finally, the algorithm is applied to real
data from a variety of tectonic and volcano-tectonic sengs and we show the
clusters generated are consistent with that expected within the geological set-
ng, in contrast to other methods which struggled to idenfy clusters outside of
the locaon they were developed to work on. The results present the possibility
of more reliable idencaon of clusters, parcularly in hybrid volcano-tectonic
sengs.
. Theory
.. ETAS
The ETAS model can take two forms, it can be spaotemporal or purely tem-
poral, and it is based on the fundamental empirical scaling laws which govern
the occurrence of earthquakes, including the Gutenberg-Richter distribuon from
which the magnitude of events is sampled. The ETAS model is a stochasc, point-
process model and describes the me, locaon and magnitude of the earthquakes,
which can form branching aershock sequences that then decay in the form of a
power law in event rate according to Omoris law (Omori, ). The version used
in ETAS is the modied version proposed by Utsu (Utsu, ).
The Gutenberg-Richter distribuon (Equaon ) relates the magnitude (M ) to
the number of earthquakes (N ) and includes two constants, a and b, where a and
b are the total number of earthquakes at M  0 and proporon of the number
of large earthquakes to small earthquakes, respecvely.
logN = a  bM ()
The b-value (b), has been found to be around unity for purely tectonic areas
(Frohlich and Davis, ) but this has been found to vary between values less
than  or to be raised as high as  or  in volcanic areas, somemes changing on
approach to erupon (McNu, ; Roberts et al., ). As menoned previ-
ously, in addion to the Gutenberg-Richter relaon, the ETAS model also incor-
porates the Omori-Utsu decay power law (Equaon ).
n(t) =
(c + t)p
The law describes the decay of the aershock rate (n(t)) with me (t). All
earthquakes may trigger aershocks; the number of aershocks depending on
the parent event magnitude which is included within the constant K. K, along
with another constant c, included in Omoris original law, the third constant, p,
was added by Utsu and modies the decay rate. Using these two relaons, we
can form the ETAS condional intensity funcon () which is dependent on the
me (t) and the history of the process at t (Ht) (Equaon ).
(t|Ht) =  + K
i:t<ti
exp((mi  m0))(t  ti + c)p ()
The parameters m0, ti and mi included within this equaon are the lower
magnitude cuto, the mes of past events and their magnitudes, respecvely.
The remaining ve parameters are the ETAS parameters, where K, c and p are
taken from the Omori-Utsu law,  is the producvity parameter and  is the back-
ground seeding rate. Every event may trigger aershocks and this can lead to
branching nested sequences. To transform this into a spaotemporal ETAS model,
we use an isotropic power law kernel with parameters d and q, also used by Hainzl
et al. () and Toua et al. (), which describes the spaal probability dis-
tribuon for the coordinates of the aershocks (Equaon ).
f(x, y) =
(q  1)d2(q1)
[x2 + y2 + d2]q
These synthec mainshock-aershock sequences formed by ETAS are repre-
sentave of the signicant majority of seismicity in tectonic areas, such as south-
ern California (Chu et al., ). The southern California datasets have most com-
monly been used to develop most of the clustering methods, here we use a syn-
thec ETAS earthquake catalogue to validate our algorithm and to test the tech-
niques currently used for clustering.
.. Current clustering methods
Over the past few decades, many cluster idencaon methods have been de-
veloped. The most common techniques used are the window method of Gardner
and Knopo () and Reasenberg (). Both were popular due to the simplic-
ity and availability of their algorithms. The window method use pre-dened space
and me windows which are a funcon of the mainshock magnitude. If an earth-
quake occurs within this window then it is deemed to be linked to the mainshock.
There have been a few suggesons for dierent equaons for calculang window
size - all developed on the southern California earthquake catalogue (Gardner and
Knopo, ; Uhrhammer, ; van Sphout et al., ). The method does not
account for nested aershock sequences, where any event can trigger its own af-
tershocks. Accordingly, Reasenberg () improves this technique by accounng
for Omoris law in the temporal window and by including a crack radii term which
removes the circular spaal window and takes into account direconal triggering
along faults. It also allows for secondary aershocks, another improvement on
the window methods. Since then, there have been many further techniques de-
veloped (Frohlich and Davis, ; Molchan and Dmitrieva, ; Zhuang et al.,
; Jacobs et al., ), including using methods taken from stascal cluster-
ing - k-means (Rehman et al., ; Wamanela et al., ; Kamat and Kamath,
; Novian et al., ; Shang et al., ), and Density-Based Spaal Cluster-
ing of Applicaons with Noise (DBSCAN) (Georgoulas et al., ; Scitovski, ;
Wang et al., ). However, as in the window methods and in Reasenberg (),
a priori assumpons are made in the algorithms, such clusters tend towards cov-
ering the same area in k-means, or an a priori esmate of the number of the clus-
ters in DBSCAN. The excepon is the stochasc declustering method of Zhuang
et al. (), nevertheless, this technique is condioned on the staonary ETAS
model, which we cannot use for catalogues with swarms.
Recently there has been a shi towards using the inter-event mes and inter-
event distances. First ulised by Frohlich and Davis (), a space-me distance,
dst, is calculated for all possible pairs of events (Equaon ). From these links,
a single tree is created where events are connected by the smallest dst unl all
earthquakes are linked. These links are then severed should the parameter dst
be greater than a certain value, DST , leading to the breakdown of the single tree
into smaller trees. This value is calculated according to Equaon  and uses the
median dst for the tree (Smed). Equaon  is empirical and based on Davis and
Frohlich () tesng to idenfy the best DST on datasets from Alaska and Mex-
ico and synthecs using input parameters based on these catalogues.
dst =
r2ij + C
2(tj  ti)2 ()
DST  9.4km
Smed  25.2km ()
Just over a decade later Baiesi and Paczuski () popularised the use of an-
other space-me metric which included the magnitude (taken from the Gutenberg-
Richter) and a fractal dimension, df (Equaon ). This fractal dimension is empir-
cally related to the b-value (Okubo, ; Legrand, ) and characterises the
distribuon of the epicentres.
nij = (tj  ti)r
ij 10
bmi ()
Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (a,b) redenes inter-event me (Equaon ) and
inter-event distance (Equaon ) where i? denotes the nearest neighbour to event
j, and the nearest neighbour can be described using Equaon .
Tj = (tj  ti?)10bmi?/2 ()
Rj = r
i?j10
bmi?/2 ()
ni?j = log Ti?j + logRi?j ()
Plong the log of the nearest-neighbour distance against frequency leads to
a bimodal frequency distribuon in ni?j , expressed in logarithmic form (Figure ).
Zaliapin et al. () originally used the trough between the two peaks as
the separaon between background and clustered seismicity. When the nearest-
neighbour distance is less than this cut-o value, the events are more likely to be
clustered, and when ni?j is greater, they are more likely to be background events.
Assuming a Gaussian mixture of background and clustered distances, a maximum
likelihood esmaon is oen made to nd the crossover between the two distri-
buons as a local minimum (Zaliapin and Ben-Zion, a,b). Bayliss et al. ()
postulates that this binary assessment of background and clustered modes can
lead to the mislabelling of events and instead suggests a probabilisc network
that uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to sample many mixture ts to
nd the strongest and weakest cluster links. Toua et al. () noted that in ar-
eas with a high seeding rate, the bimodality can disappear. Despite the bimodality
disappearing in the non-rescaled nearest-neighbour frequency graph, when the

non-rescaled inter-event me and inter-event distance are ploed against one an-
other in a D histogram (Figure ), we can see a clear separaon between the two
modes (Toua et al., ). In addion to lack of magnitude and b-value depen-
dence, this provides further raonale for our new clustering algorithm, where,
unlike Zaliapin et al. () and Bayliss et al. (), we use the two-dimensional
plot of inter-event me and distance, instead of a single variable ni?j .
. Method
Toua et al. () used synthec ETAS catalogues to show that the sponta-
neous earthquake rate, i.e. the generaon of background earthquakes, can lead
to the masking of the earthquake triggering in the log nearest-neighbour plots.
However, when the inter-event me (IET) is ploed against the inter-event dis-
tance (IER) as a D histogram, there is sll a separaon between the triggered
and background events. As in Baiesi and Paczuski () and Zaliapin and Ben-
Zion (a,b), Toua et al. () uses nearest-neighbours for the clustering, we
expand on this by using all earthquake pairs.
In Figure  we can see three overlapping synthec earthquake clusters and
the background events ploed through me. If an event number dierence,  ,
of one was used, earthquakes that are hidden within other sequences may be
misidened as background events. Therefore, we run our clustering algorithm
over all pairs of earthquakes. As we increase  we are more likely to correctly link
earthquakes that occur later in the sequence to their cluster. By not restricng
ourselves to the nearest-neighbour distances, this allows our clustering algorithm
to be successful, even in areas with high background rates.
The clustering method itself uses the D distribuon of the IETs and IERs. In
Figure : Three clusters (blue, red and light blue lines) and background events (green lines) are
ploed through me. There is a high degree of overlap within the sequences. In relaon to the
rst event we increase the event number dierence,  , and show how as we increase  the events
that are hidden within other sequences are idened as linked to the rst event (triggered
- black double headed arrow). These pairs of events would lie on the le hand side of the line
in Figure . The independent light grey double headed arrow is between pairs of events that
would fall on the right hand side of the line as they are not linked.
Figure  we show a simulated ETAS earthquake catalogue (a) and the relocated
Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) catalogue of Hauksson et al. ()
(b), with  =  . There is a clear division between the two modes of seismicity,
linked events are in the boom le, and the background events are in the top
right.
Toua et al. () separated the two modes by eye, but this introduces a
degree of subjecvity and potenal bias, therefore we expanded on the work
of Toua et al. by using an automated line plong algorithm. We considered
and tested many dierent methods for the separaon, including using stascal
clustering algorithms such as k-means (Lloyd, ). However, k-means will tend
to idenfy clusters of approximately the same spaal area. We have found, as
can be seen in the example of Figure , that the size of the two clusters i.e. the
two modes of seismicity (background and linked) is not equal and varies between
catalogues. Instead, our method contours the graphs according to the density
of points using a Gaussian Kernel Density Esmaon. Figure  shows that when
a dataset (example shown is the SCEC catalogue) is contoured a clear valley
emerges in the D map. We developed an automated line plong saddlepoint
(ALPS) algorithm which plots an opmal line through this valley. The orientaon
of this valley changes between catalogues (Figure a vs b), and also over dier-
ent periods for the same catalogue; a period of intense triggered seismicity or a
me of quiescence will change the density of the points and thus the contouring.
Therefore the algorithm must take into account the dierences in geometry be-
tween the datasets. By automang the process, ALPS removes the subjecvity in
drawing the dividing line thus increasing reproducibility and minimising any po-
tenal bias. It also increases the eciency and speed of the process, keeping the
method constant and allowing it to be quickly applied to many catalogues with
consistent results. Addionally, tesng on a variety of catalogue sizes has demon-
strated ALPS can eecvely calculate the line on small datasets where points are
sparse in the valley, as well as when there may only be one set of inner contours.
These are all clear advantages to using ALPS over other methods previously used
to separate the two modes.
The next step in the clustering method is moving from plong a line to form-
ing families of events. Having run ALPS over all inter-event mes and inter-event
distances, increasing  each me, we have pairs of earthquakes which are iden-
ed either as linked to one another, or that have no links, depending on whether
the inter-event me and inter-event distance for the pair of earthquakes plots
above (no link) or below the line (linked). We assign the parent event to be the
nearest-neighbour and keep this as the main link, so each event that had been
linked to mulple other events is only linked to one other earthquake. Figure 
illustrates how these pairs of linked earthquakes then form cluster families us-
ing a real-world example from the clustering of the Ethiopian-Afar Geoscienc
Lithospheric Experiment (EAGLE) catalogue of Keir et al. (). Those with no
links are added to the background catalogue meaning we now have an earth-
quake catalogue separated into background events and cluster families, with the
cluster families consisng of earthquakes which were all idened to be linked in
the IET-IER plot.

. Validaon of the method
We tested our method by creang two synthec earthquake catalogues. One
is a spaotemporal ETAS catalogue and the other is a swarm-dominated cata-
logue which simulates a volcano-tectonic catalogue. For the spaotemporal ETAS
catalogue, we used the same ETAS parameters as in Toua et al. (), gure
 (K = 0.02, c = 0.01, p = 1.2, q = 1.5,  = 0.01 and  = 1). We then
ran seven clustering methods over both of the catalogues; the window method,
Reasenberg (), Single Link Clustering (Frohlich and Davis, ), CURATE (Ja-
cobs et al., ), Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (a,b), Bayliss et al. () and our
own method, ALPS. Further to this, we ran the window method using three dif-
ferent sets of equaons for calculang the me and distance windows - Gardner
and Knopo (), Uhrhammer () and Gruenthal from van Sphout et al.
(). Addionally, we ran the ETAS declustering method of Zhuang et al. ()
although in this case we do not idenfy dierent clusters. Figures a and  show
the synthec ETAS non-rescaled IET-IER plot and rescaled IET-IER for the ALPS and
Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (a,b) methods respecvely. We addionally plot the
lines which have been calculated using Gaussian mixture model ts (Figure ) for
the Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (a,b) method and using ALPS for ours. Comparing
the two IET-IER plots, the divide between the two groups can be more clearly seen
in Figure a, this suggests the separaon between the clustered and independent
events is more clear when using the ALPS method.
The more clear division of the two components using our method in D space
(Figure a) when compared to the method of Zaliapin et al. () (Figure ) is
reected in the results of the tesng of the clustering techniques. Figure  is
a summary of the accuracy of the clustering methods, tested on the synthec
ETAS catalogue. Using the synthec catalogues means we know the clustering
structure (% independent, % in cluster families), and thus know if the events
have been idened correctly as independent or as part of the correct cluster
family. The most accurate methods are those of Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (a,b),
Bayliss et al. () and ALPS. These three methods are considerably more suc-
cessful at idenfying the correct clusters and the independent events with %,
% and % of events clustered correctly, respecvely. For some applicaons
we only need to separate earthquakes into cluster families and independent, the
true posives and the true negaves, respecvely. For example, in hazard and
risk assessments where only the background seismicity is needed (Giardini et al.,
). In this more general case, the accuracy of all of the clustering techniques is
increased further (Table ). Again, the ALPS method is the most accurate at %.

The simple spaotemporal ETAS synthec catalogue may model mainshock-
aershock sequences well, but it is not a sucient representaon of seismicity
in acve connental ris, or indeed areas with high levels of swarms. Thus, we
created another synthec catalogue which models areas with volcano-tectonic
seismicity. In order to do this we combined a background catalogue which
used spaotemporal ETAS to generate events and ve swarm catalogues, each
catalogue containing one individual swarm. Random locaons of volcanoes were
generated to act as driving mechanisms for the ve swarms, each with a random
b-value which fell between . and . to reect the higher b-values at volcanoes.
Addionally, the  was raised for these swarms, again randomly chosen to fall
between  and , representave of the number of events which can occur per
day in a volcanic swarm (Benoit and McNu, ). The spaal distribuon of
the events was restricted, so no events could occur more than km outside the
volcanic centre. By constraining the spaal and temporal components this will
generate overlapping sequences, and will lead to the swarms being masked to
some extent within the synthec catalogue. The resulng daily event rate of the
catalogue can be seen in Figure , where the steps in the cumulave event rate
where the swarms start can clearly be seen and have been shown by the blue
dashed lines.
Once again, the same clustering techniques were run over the synthec cat-
alogue (% independent events, % clustered) and the results may be seen
in Figure . Overall the accuracy of each of the clustering methods has de-
creased, with the single excepon of the Single Link Clustering method. The ETAS
stochasc declustering method of Zhuang et al. () has had the most signi-
cant decrease in accuracy. This is to be expected as it is based on purely spao-
temporal ETAS models. The same methods sll perform signicantly beer than
the others as in Figure  and Table . Both the methods of Zaliapin and Ben-Zion
(a,b) and Bayliss et al. () split the swarms into separate cluster families.
This addional level of complexity naturally leads to the decrease in clustering
accuracy, though they did correctly idenfy the events as clustered and as true
posives. Only the ALPS method and that of Gardner and Knopo () accu-
rately idened the swarm events as part of one cluster family. However, Gard-
ner and Knopo () has a tendency to mis-idenfy many independent events
as belonging to cluster families. The CURATE method, which might have been
expected to succeed on idenfying the swarms as it was developed to idenfy
swarms in the Central Volcanic Region of New Zealand, performed poorly. We
speculate this is due to the high level of swarms within a relavely short me
period raising the average daily event rate. Therefore, because the catalogue is
swarm-dominated, the CURATE method of idenfying posive changes from the
average daily event rate fails to idenfy the swarms when the average daily event
rate is already raised.

For the Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (a,b) and Bayliss et al. () methods,
there are two reasons for their drop in accuracy for the volcano-tectonic cata-
logue compared to the purely spao-temporal ETAS. First of all, they were both
developed for the southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) catalogue which
consists predominately of mainshock-aershock sequences, and both have been
successful in idenfying clusters related to these (for example, the Baja, Landers
and the San Gabriel earthquake sequences). Secondly, their algorithms contain a
scaling with b-value and magnitude. The larger magnitude of the parent event is
key to triggering the aershock sequences and relang the daughters to this par-
ent is important in the classic ETAS-like sequences. However, in swarms, where
there is no obvious mainshock, it will lead to the largest magnitude event in a
swarm being falsely idened as the mainshock. This could lead to the break-
down of the swarms into even smaller cluster families as they are incorrectly
treated as mini mainshock-aershock sequences within the swarm. In addion to
the inclusion of magnitude, the b-value is higher for the swarms but both of these
methods take an average b-value for the whole area. However, we surmise that
the breaking of the swarms into smaller cluster families is primarily due to the use
of nearest-neighbour distances as opposed to using all possible inter-event mes
and inter-event distances, as used in the ALPS method.
Finally, it should be noted that both the ETAS method of Zhuang et al. ()
and the method of Bayliss et al. () are probabilisc in nature. Therefore the
methods do not denively sort the events into clustered and background, in-
stead assigning a probability that the event is a) background in the case of ETAS
or b) linked to their nearest neighbour for Bayliss et al. (). In the ETAS declus-
tering method we took probabilies of % to be background and % to be clus-
tered (Zhuang et al., ). For the algorithm of Bayliss et al. (), we used
the rst realisaon of the links rather than choosing a cut-o for the probabilis-
c nearest-neighbour links over many realisaons. This reduces the subjecvity
in choosing a threshold but does not fully represent this declustering technique,
there may be increases in accuracy if we use the many realisaons and probabil-
ies of the linked nearest-neighbour events.
To summarise, the tesng of the ALPS method and comparison to the current
clustering techniques using synthec ETAS and volcano-tectonic earthquake cata-
logues has shown that ALPS is the most reliable and accurate method. It idenes
mainshock-aershock sequences with an accuracy of % and the cluster families
within volcano-tectonic catalogues with an accuracy of %, both of these are %
more accurate than the next best method of Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (a,b) and
it correctly idenes swarms as one cluster family, in contrast to the method of
Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (a).
The volcano-tectonic catalogue generated had a relavely high background
rate and had many overlapping sequences. This was done deliberately to repli-
cate seismicity in acve connental ris more realiscally. Having validated the
method on representave synthec data, we now apply the method to real data.

. Results - applicaon to real data
The Ethiopia-Afar Geoscienc Lithospheric Experiment (EAGLE) catalogue of
Keir et al. () consists of volcano-tectonic seismicity with  events over a 
month period from th October  to rd January . It has considerably
fewer events than the Southern California Earthquake Catalogue (Hauksson et al.,
), but as can be seen in Figure , the steps in the cumulave daily event
rate suggest the presence of swarms. The average daily event rate is . and
there are large deviaons from this on many days during the catalogue. However,
we cannot tell from Figure  if these are many overlapping sequences or one
swarm. First, we plot the D histogram for the EAGLE dataset, Figure . There
is a stronger clustering component, as shown by the high density of events in
the smaller me-distance component for this catalogue compared to Figure b,
suggesng a greater proporon of the events are in clusters. The dividing line,
calculated by ALPS, is also more vercal which indicates the inter-event distance
is more important than the inter-event me in separang the clustered from the
background modes.
The results of the ALPS clustering algorithm are shown in Figure , including
an inset map of the area with the most clusters. The majority of cluster families
are located on the Ankober border fault system and between the volcanoes of
Dofen and Fentale, and near Aluto (see Figure  for locaons, Dofen is the rst
volcano north of Fentale). With a geothermal project near Aluto and a potenal
geothermal project near Fentale, we know that there are acve hydrothermal
systems at these volcanoes which is the most likely source of the cluster fami-
lies near these volcanoes. The driving mechanism is likely to be related to the
movement of geothermal uids aecng a local volume, a process which is more

likely to result in swarm-type seismicity. The presence of several dierent clus-
ter families near these volcanoes may reect dierent parts of the hydrothermal
system being acvated at dierent mes. In contrast, the cluster families located
on the Ankober border fault system are more likely to be mainshock-aershock
sequences related to one of the many faults within this area. As seen in Figure
, mulple families are idened both for the swarms and mainshock-aershock
clusters with the overlapping spaal sequences being separated by the clustering
algorithm.
The cumulave daily event rate indicates the potenal presence of swarm se-
quences in the form of steps in the graph. Having idened the populaon of
clustered events we can then separate the events in me into their respecve
cluster families (Figure ). We can now see that the dierent swarms associated
with dierent steps in the daily event rate plot (Figure ) form a series of over-
lapping sequences as opposed to one sequence.
In addion to the EAGLE dataset, we have tested the ALPS method on many
more earthquake catalogues. Here we show two of these, the SCEC catalogue
(Hauksson et al., ) over a ten year period (// -//), with a
magnitude cut-o of , and the North Island catalogue of New Zealand, with a
lower magnitude cut-o of ., but over a shorter two year period (// -
//). The SCEC dataset is a predominately tectonic catalogue of mainshock-
aershock sequences, whereas North Island, New Zealand will, like the EAGLE
dataset, have a mixture of swarms and mainshock-aershock sequences.
The D histograms are similar (Figure b - SCEC catalogue, Figure  - NZ),
and both are dierent from those obtained from the EAGLE catalogue (Figure ).
They have a much weaker clustered component, suggesng a smaller proporon

of events are in clusters and we have more independent events. There is also a
much smaller spread of inter-event mes for the linked events, with the back-
ground events having a larger range. However, as with the EAGLE catalogue, the
main control on idenfying clustered events for both southern California and New
Zealand is the inter-event distance.
We show the cluster families idened by ALPS in Figures  (SCEC) and 
(New Zealand).
In southern California the majority of clusters lie along known faults, suggest-
ing these are mainshock-aershock sequences. However, we also see a number
of clusters to the south of the Salton Sea. The Salton Sea area is known for hav-
ing many earthquake swarms and there are geothermal power staons situated
along its south-eastern shore (Zaliapin and Ben-Zion, ; Cheng and Chen, ;
Martnez-Garzon et al., ). Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (a,b) postulate that in
more ducle regions with high uid ow and heat ow, in areas like the Salton Sea,
the earthquakes are more likely to occur in swarms than in mainshock-aershock
sequences.
Addionally there are also a number of clusters near the locaon of the Easter
earthquake in Baja (th April ). The subset of the SCEC catalogue used here
ends on the st January , but the high number of clusters towards the end
of the catalogue (cluster number may also be considered as a proxy for me) in
this locaon suggests some precursory clusters, potenally as part of a foreshock
sequence for the larger event four months later.
For the clusters idened in the New Zealand catalogue, there are many in
the Central Volcanic Region (CVR) with a few around White Island volcano and
the majority located south of Lake Taupo, between the lake and the volcano Ton-
gariro (Figure ). There are also a number of families near East Cape relang
to the M. Te Araroa earthquake on nd September . Given the tectonic
sengs, we can infer that the cluster families here are mainshock-aershock se-
quences, contrasng the swarms near Lake Taupo (Webb et al., ; Sherburn,
; Hochstein, ).
From the synthec catalogues, we know the ALPS method to be the most ac-
curate, if this is also true for real data then it is likely that the vast majority of
the clusters observed in the MER, southern California and the North Island, New
Zealand are true posives. Addionally, we know the method correctly iden-
es both swarms and mainshock-aershock sequences it is unlikely that we have
missed any cluster families and the independent events are also accurately char-
acterised.

. Discussion
From the synthec datasets we found the ALPS clustering method to be the
most successful, both for the purely spao-temporal ETAS and for the volcano-
tectonic catalogue. We speculate this is due to using all pairs of events in the
catalogue rather than just nearest-neighbours, and, by reducing the number of
parameters used to inter-event me and inter-event distances, we remove the un-
certaines associated with the b-value and the magnitudes. In addion, by test-
ing the method on synthec catalogues and dening the accuracy of the method,
we can be condent in the cluster families it idenes for real-world datasets.
ALPS ability to characterise complete swarms, whilst sll correctly idenfying
mainshock-aershock sequences, where other methods have split them into mul-
ple families, means it can oer more pernent analysis for areas which have
both types of seismicity. For example, in the Salton Sea area many swarms were
found using the method of Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (a,b), but it may be that
some of these swarms are part of the same cluster. Furthermore, we have tested
the method on a variety of contrasng datasets. The SCEC and the New Zealand
datasets have considerably more earthquakes than the EAGLE catalogue, yet the
EAGLE and New Zealand catalogues cover a considerably shorter me period, -
years as opposed to the ten years covered by the SCEC catalogue. The versality
of the algorithm allows it in principle to provide accurate clusters for seismic-
ity recorded on temporary deployments which may cover a short period of me
and have a limited number of earthquakes as well as large, comprehensive earth-
quake catalogues like the SCEC catalogue. Moreover, as the technique has not
been developed on a limited set of tectonic sengs, it can be applied worldwide.
We have shown just three dierent tectonic seng where ALPS has idened
clusters and cluster families. Despite the dierences in the D histogram of the
inter-event mes and inter-event distances, a clear separaon could be seen and
the method successfully ploed a line through all of them on the D map. By us-
ing ALPS to plot the dividing line we have made the clustering algorithm ecient,
automated, objecve, relavely reliable, and reproducible. We have not made
assumpons about the b-value, the me and distance windows, nor do we need
to provide an esmate of the number of clusters before we start. By removing the
magnitude from the inter-event me and inter-event distance equaons, we have
removed any uncertaines associated with the magnitude, ALPS has proved to be
more successful than those techniques which have included magnitude scaling.
In the future, we will assess the impact this has on idenfying parent-daughter
pairs. In the meanme we can successfully and condently separate the volcanic
events from the tectonic events in areas with many overlapping sequences, such
as the MER. We can also use the volcanic events in forecasng methodologies to
improve forecasng capabilies for the many volcanoes which are located near
acve faults. In addion, the clustering accuracy is improved if we only consider
clustered and independent events and not individual families. This will mean we
have even higher condence that we can provide an accurate declustered cata-
logue which can be used to create hazard maps.
The next steps will involve interrogang the individual cluster families further.
We can be condent in the idencaon of the individual families at this stage,
but we need to invesgate the metrics of the families more closely. This may
provide an even clearer methodology for separang the swarm and mainshock-
aershock sequences. In the meanme, we can make some inferences on the
type of seismicity from the locaons and their tectonic sengs, for example the
Salton Sea, Lake Taupo and Fentale clusters are more likely to be swarm type
whereas the East Cape and Ankober seismicity is more likely to be of the mainshock-
aershock type.
. Conclusions
In comparison to current popular clustering techniques, the ALPS method was
found to be the most accurate when tested on synthec data. Unlike most of the
methods tested, with the excepon of CURATE, it was not inially developed on
the earthquakes recorded in southern California and instead has been designed
to idenfy both swarms and mainshock-aershock sequences. ALPS proved to
be successful at this, for example not incorrectly spling the modelled swarm
seismicity into dierent cluster families, and correctly idenfying separate clus-
ter families which are part of overlapping sequences. Addionally, we supported
our tesng by applying the ALPS method to the real-world catalogues of south-
ern California, North Island, New Zealand and the Main Ethiopian Ri (MER) cata-
logue. In parcular the EAGLE catalogue consisng of volcano-tectonic seismicity
from the MER presented the biggest test as it is a small dataset with a compli-
cated tectonic seng, leading to many potenal origins of seismicity. The MER
has large border faults bounding the central ri oor, and magmac segments
with small en-echelon faulng running down the ri valley, perpendicular to the
direcon of spreading and accommodang the extension of the ri. Having con-
ducted tests on a synthec catalogue, it is likely that current clustering methods
would have struggled to separate the swarms relang to uid movements from
the mainshock-aershock sequences generated on the faults. However the ALPS
method successfully idened cluster families near many of the known volca-
noes, located within the magmac segments, parcularly those associated with
acve hydrothermal systems and also along the border faults. Having idened
the presence of candidate swarms associated with steps in the cumulave event
rate, we were able to expand on this and see that many cluster families were ac-
ve. Finally, due to its eciency, reproducibility and lack of a priori assumpons,
it is clear the ALPS algorithm has many advantages over current techniques.

Paper - Identifying and characterising
earthquake clusters in volcano-tectonic
settings using the ALPS (Automated
Line Plotting Saddlepoint) algorithm
5.1 Introduction
Having introduced our method in the previous paper, we use ALPS to characterise the cluster
families further into mainshock-aftershock and swarm sequences. ALPS is run over earthquake
catalogues from four localities, southern California, the North Island of New Zealand and two
locations in Iceland, Reykjanes Ridge and the Tjrnes Fracture Zone. In these settings, the lo-
cations of the cluster families are unambiguous and we can confidently relate them to either
earthquake-earthquake triggering or volcanic processes. From here we can identify metrics
which are distinct between the mainshock-aftershock and swarm sequences. We found three
classifiers that could be used, all related to the physical processes and empirical laws which
govern earthquake triggering; the cumulative event rate, the magnitude of the events through
time and force-directed Kamada-Kawai cluster networks. Using these characteristics along-
side ALPS makes the ALPS clustering algorithm a valuable tool for separating earthquakes into
mainshock-aftershock sequences, swarm sequences and background events.

Abstract
Earthquake cluster families can broadly be separated into mainshock-aershock
sequences (earthquake-earthquake triggered) and swarm sequences (triggered
by the same underlying processes). Typically mainshock-aershock sequences
are located on tectonic faults, whereas swarms are commonly associated with
mapped volcanoes and/or geothermal provinces. In our previous work, we intro-
duced a new Automated Line Plong Saddlepoint Algorithm (ALPS) that could
idenfy both types of cluster family, improving on current clustering techniques
that are stronger at idenfying one type. We inferred the triggering process for
the cluster families from the locaons of the cluster families. However, in areas of
mixed seismicity with overlapping volcanic and tectonic sequences, such as within
the Main Ethiopian Ri (MER), it is much more difficult to discern if the cluster
family is related to volcanic or tectonic processes. Here, we use ALPS to iden-
fy cluster families in areas containing both mainshock-aershock and swarm se-
quences where the triggering process is clear. We found three metrics that can be
used to confidently characterise the cluster families, including those located in ar-
eas where the source of the seismicity may be ambiguous; the cumulave event

rate, the temporal evoluon of the magnitudes and the style of the force-directed
Kamada-Kawai cluster networks inferred from the cluster families. The datasets
we used to discern these metrics are from southern California, the North Island of
New Zealand and two areas within Iceland - Reykjanes Ridge and the Tjornes Frac-
ture Zone. The classifiers are simple and intuive, with all three related to physi-
cal processes and the empirical laws which govern earthquakes. The cumulave
event rate and the magnitude evoluon reflect the Omori power law decay of
the aershock rate for mainshock-aershock sequences, and a lack of Omori law
decay for the swarm sequences. Swarms are defined as having no obvious main-
shock, and this is clearly revealed by the magnitude evoluon for a given cluster.
In contrast, Baths law i.e. the magnitude of the mainshock commonly being 1.1 -
1.2 mes the size of the next largest aershock, is reflected in the magnitude evo-
luon graphs for the mainshock-aershock sequences. Finally, we invesgated
the branching style of the force-directed Kamada-Kawai cluster networks, deter-
mined by the cluster families. The mainshock-aershock sequences showed a
dendric branching paern, whereas the swarm sequences appear as a flower
burst. These simple characeriscs, combined with the ALPS algorithm, allow us
to classify the mainshock-aershock and swarm sequences in areas containing
volcano-tectonic seismicity, where the triggering of earthquakes may be other-
wise ambiguous. We can more confidently idenfy volcanic swarm sequences,
making ALPS a valuable tool in volcanic forecasng in such areas.

1. Introducon2
Earthquakes can be broadly separated into two categories; those which are3
causally-related to one another and those which are independent. By separang4
an earthquake catalogue into these two components we can use the declustered5
part for probabilisc seismic hazard assessment (Giardini et al., 2003) and we6
can further divide the clustered part into groups of causally-related earthquakes7
- cluster families. We define the cluster families to be groups of events that are ei-8
ther earthquake-earthquake triggered (mainshock-aershock sequences) or are9
related to the same underlying - typically volcanic - process (swarm sequences).10
The swarm sequences are useful for determining underlying processes occurring11
at acve volcanoes and mainshock-aershock sequences can be used in retro-12
specve analysis of the triggering across fault systems and thus implemented13
into prospecve hazard assessments (Jordan et al., 2011). However, despite many14
methods being available for separang earthquake catalogues into background15
events and clusters, comparavely lile work has been done on characterising16
the clusters and providing disnct metrics for idenfying swarm-type sequences17
versus mainshock-aershock sequences.18
One of the most comprehensive studies to date can be found in Zaliapin and19
Ben-Zion (2016a) which uses their method to first idenfy the cluster families20
and independent events (termed singles in their work) (Zaliapin and Ben-Zion,21
2013a,b). They presented two types of cluster - burst-like and swarm-like - sug-22
gesng the laer are linked to the heat flow and thus the effecve viscosity. Burst-23
like clusters consist of shallow seismicity and are found in colder regions, whereas24
the swarm-like cluster families are typically found in mid-ocean ridges and are25
linked to areas of high heat flow. Similarly, the swarms are oen found in ar-26
eas with hot fluids circulang, such as in geothermal areas consistent with many27
current theories (e.g. Hill, 1977; Vidale and Shearer, 2006; Heinicke et al., 2009).28
More recent work by Zhang and Shearer (2016) and Cheng and Chen (2018) in-29
vesgated swarms in the Salton Sea, southern California, and their findings for30
the mechanisms of triggering for swarms are also consistent with Zaliapin and31
Ben-Zion (2016a).32
In Wilcock et al. (in prep) we introduced a new clustering method which33
has been designed to idenfy both swarm-type and mainshock-aershock se-34
quences, the Automated Line Plong Saddlepoint (ALPS) algorithm. We tested35
it on a synthec volcano-tectonic catalogue in comparison with the models de-36
scribed above and found it was the most accurate clustering method, correctly37
idenfying over 90% of the true posive earthquakes in cluster familes and true38
negave independent events. We used the algorithm to infer the processes that39
led to the cluster families idenfied in the real data from the Main Ethiopian Ri,40
southern California and North Island, New Zealand, and found them to be con-41
sistent with the locaons of the cluster families and our knowledge of the local42
geological processes. However, we noted in our previous work, that in areas of43
mixed seismicity, it is not always easy to disnguish if the earthquakes are re-44
lated to slip on a fault or a volcanic process. A real world example of this is in the45
Main Ethiopian Ri. Running down the central ri valley are a number of volca-46
noes (Figure 1) which lie within magmac segments. These magmac segments47
are approximately 50km long and contain en-echelon faulng within them (Keir48
et al., 2006; Abebe et al., 2007), therefore cluster families idenfied in these ar-49
eas could be related to the volcanoes or to the faults. Disnguishing between50
them purely on locaon would be a challenge, but here we extend our previ-51
ous work and find characteriscs of swarms which are different from mainshock-52
aershock sequences and use these to objecvely classify the cluster families as53
tectonic or volcanic using the same algorithm.54
Here we use ALPS to idenfy clusters in a range of localies, the Tjornes Frac-55
ture Zone and Reykjanes Ridge, Iceland, North Island, New Zealand and southern56
California. All sengs have a mixture of tectonic and volcanic seismicity leading57
to both swarms and mainshock-aershock sequences, albeit occurring in differing58
raos in different localies. They were chosen to idenfy the defining character-59
iscs, as the cluster families are large and their locaons and geological sengs60
are unambiguous - they are either tectonic or volcanic seismicity. We invesgated61
a number of characteriscs and found the stascs which related to physical pro-62
cesses provided the most reliable and disnct separaon of independent events63
and cluster families.64
We start by describing the theory behind the generaon of earthquake se-65
quences and how swarm-type sequences and mainshock-aershock sequences66
differ physically. We suggest how we expect these differences to be shown within67
the cluster families and how we may use these to idenfy between the two types.68
We then run ALPS over a number of datasets, finding mulple cluster families69
within the catalogues. From here we select the cluster families that we can con-70
fidently classify as either mainshock-aershock sequences or swarm sequences.71
Finally, we invesgate the characteriscs idenfied in the theory which may dif-72
fer between the two and find the cumulave event rate, the magnitude through73
me and the cluster networks reflected the source of the seismicity accurately74
and using these we could separate the mainshock-aershock sequences from the75
swarm-type sequences. We find this was consistent across all of the catalogues76

used and suggest these are therefore universal classifiers.77
Our results suggest that we can idenfy swarms and differenate these from78
mainshock-aershock sequences with confidence, and incorporate the swarm79
cluster families into volcanic forecasng methodologies. For example, in areas80
such as the Main Ethiopian Ri we can reduce the uncertainty in the underlying81
geophysical process of the cluster families, and thus esmate the state of unrest82
at the volcano.83
2. Theory84
Swarm and mainshock-aershock sequences are both groups of causally-related85
earthquakes, but they are caused by different processes and thus have different86
characteriscs. Mainshock-aershock clusters result typically from a larger mag-87
nitude earthquake, the mainshock, followed by a series of smaller magnitude88
earthquakes, the aershocks. Baths law states the difference in magnitude be-89
tween the mainshock and the largest aershock is 1.1-1.2, this is a constant which90
is independent of the magnitude (Bath and Duda, 1964). However, we know this91
is not always the case, for example, in Nepal, the inial M7.8 mainshock on 25th92
April 2015 was followed by a M7.3 aershock on 12th May. Generally though,93
there is one large earthquake near the beginning of the sequence, followed by a94
chain of aershocks, each earthquake triggered by another. Each of these aer-95
shocks can trigger further earthquakes, leading to a branching sequence (Toua96
et al., 2011). These aershocks decay in me according to the Omori-Utsu power97
law (Equaon 1) (Omori, 1895; Utsu, 1961). k and c are constants and p alters the98
rate of decay, typically falling within the range of 0.9-1.5 (Utsu et al., 1995).99
n(t) =
(c+ t)p
In contrast, swarm sequences have no obvious mainshock and there is no100
dendric branching chain of aershocks. Instead, earthquakes within the same101
swarm sequence are related to the same triggering process. They oen occur102
in areas with high heat and fluid flow, localies with acve geothermal systems103
or volcanoes (Hill, 1977; Zaliapin and Ben-Zion, 2016b). Dyke injecon and infla-104
on leads to volcano-tectonic earthquakes. These earthquakes occur at the p105
of the propagang dykes, whereas for an expanding dyke, the earthquakes oc-106
cur perpendicular to the direcon of greatest regional stress (Hill, 1977; Roman107
and Cashman, 2006). For swarms situated in geothermal fields, these areas are108
typically highly fractured, with hot fluid circulang. The pore-pressure change109
from the fluids lowers the fricon on the faults, leading to small earthquakes - re-110
stricted in their magnitude by the scale of the faults. This, coupled with the high111
connecvity of the fracture networks, leads to many earthquakes occurring in a112
swarm (Cheng and Chen, 2018).113
The physical differences between the mainshock-aershock sequences and114
swarm-type clusters leads to several characteriscs of the families which can be115
used to differenate between them. Many potenal stascs that could be used116
for the separaon of the two sequence types have been tested. Here, we present117
only those that were applicable to all of either the swarm-type or mainshock-118
aershock type clusters and were sufficiently disnct between the two types. The119
ALPS method is run over all earthquake pairs, idenfying linked earthquakes and120
assigning the nearest-neighbour to be the parent event. Unlike other methods121
which use inter-event mes and inter-event distances (Baiesi and Paczuski, 2004;122
Zaliapin and Ben-Zion, 2013a,b; Bayliss et al., 2019), it has removed the magni-123
tude scaling. Therefore the parent-daughter links formed will be different to other124
methods. Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2016a) present an average leaf depth metric for125
the classifying of swarm and mainshock-aershock type clusters. However, these126
may not always be suitable because of the difference in assigning the parent-127
daughter links so we have explored alternaves. Furthermore, Bayliss et al. (2019)128
highlights the uncertaines regarding the average leaf depth as a metric for char-129
acterising the structure of the cluster family. Therefore we have invesgated the130
effecveness of other properes inherent to the individual clusters in inferring131
their nature.132
3. Methods133
We use the ALPS algorithm to idenfy the cluster families in the earthquake134
catalogues (Wilcock et al., in prep). This method uses the inter-event me (IET)135
and inter-event distance (IER) in 2D space to separate events into linked and back-136
ground, plong an opmal dividing line automacally. We run the algorithm over137
all pairs of events - this means the seeding rate has no effect on the ability for138
ALPS to idenfy all linked events. We ran the technique over a variety of datasets139
in order to have a range of cluster sizes, locaons and structures to invesgate.140
All localies have a mixture of volcanic and tectonic seismicity, though the rao141
varies from catalogue to catalogue. We chose the catalogues as type locaons, as142
they contain swarms and mainshock-aershock sequences which are disncve143
enough in geographical locaon and thus we can be confident in their underlying144
processes. We then analyse properes of the swarms and mainshock-aershock145
sequences to find metrics which can separate the two.146
Previous work has suggested using average leaf depth (Zaliapin and Ben-Zion,147
2016a), however, the ALPS clustering method removes the magnitude and b-value148
to make it more adept at idenfying both swarms and mainshock-aershock se-149
quences. This means the smaller earthquakes which have been triggered by the150
larger earthquakes will instead be aributed to their nearest-neighbour when151
linked. Consequently, we cannot use the average leaf depth.152
Based on the properes of the known swarms and mainshock-aershock se-153
quences idenfied by ALPS, we found three metrics that can be used to discrim-154
inate between the two types of cluster families; the cumulave event rate, the155
magnitude evoluon and the shape of the force-directed Kamada-Kawai network156
graph.157
The datasets we have used to idenfy these three characteriscs are from158
Iceland, North Island, New Zealand and southern California.159
The Tjornes Fracture Zone (TFZ) and Reykjanes Ridge, both in Iceland, are160
part of the transform boundary between the offshore and onshore parts of the161
mid-Atlanc ridge (Figure 2). They both have acve volcanic systems, with oblique162
strike-slip faults accommodang the extension. In the TFZ, two of the faults, the163
Grmsey Lineament and Husavk-Flatey Fault are shown on the map, with the164
Grmsey Lineament to the right of the TFZ and the Husavk-Flatey Fault to the165
le. The majority of the strain is taken up by these faults and they are the most166
acve faults in the TFZ. Similarly, the Reykjanes Ridge is encompassed in the South167
Iceland Seismic Zone, the connecon between the East Volcanic Zone (which in-168
cludes Kafla and Eyjaallajokull) and the West Volcanic Zone (Reykjanes).169
In contrast, the North Island of New Zealand is part of a subducon zone. It170
has a major strike slip fault system (North Island Fault System) to the east of the171

used to characterise clusters. Both the Reykjanes Ridge and Tjornes Fracture Zone are situated at

island which accommodates the oblique movement of the Pacific plate into the172
Australian plate through dextral slip. The Central Volcanic Region consists of a173
series of back-arc volcanoes running down the centre of North Island (Figure 3).174
A number of the volcanoes are sll acve with three volcanoes having erupted175
in the last fieen years, Ruapehu (2006, 2007), Tongariro/Ngauruhoe (2012) and176
White Island (2013, 2016) (Global Volcanism Program, 2013a,b, 2017). We inves-177
gated all earthquakes that occurred on the North Island between the period 1st178
January 2016 - 1st January 2018. This me period was chosen because it includes179
the offshore M7.1 Te Araroa earthquake at East Cape which was widely felt over180
the North Island and a series of swarms to the south of Lake Taupo, near the181
geothermal area of Tokaanu.182
The final dataset we used is the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC)183
catalogue of Hauksson et al. (2012). The SCEC catalogue contains predominately184

volcano to the swarms. NIFS - North Island Fault System
mainshock-aershock sequences, occurring on the many strike-slip faults within185
the San Andreas system, with a few areas which are more likely to have swarms186
such as near the Salton Sea (Holschneider et al., 2012; Cheng and Chen, 2018).187
We invesgated several different periods of me within the SCEC catalogue, all188
chosen to include large earthquakes; the 1992 Landers earthquake, 1999 Hec-189
tor Mine earthquake, the 2010 Baja earthquake and the most recent Ridgecrest190
earthquakes which occurred on 4th and 5th July 2019. Here we include the results191
of the 1992 Landers and 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes.192
The ALPS clustering algorithm is highly successful at correctly separang events193
into cluster families and independent events when tested on synthec mainshock-194
aershock and volcano-tectonic catalogues (Wilcock et al., in prep). With some195
confidence, we can therefore expect the families idenfied in real-world datasets196
to be predominately correct, and not arfacts of the clustering algorithm. How-197
ever, we would also like to characterise the clusters further, idenfying metrics198
and markers which may be used to label a family as either a swarm or mainshock-199
aershock sequence. In order to find the best metrics we performed stascal200
analysis on a number of different aspects of the clusters idenfied by ALPS.201
4. Results202
4.1. Cumulave Event Rate203
Previously we stated that aershock sequences caused by a larger magnitude204
mainshock typically decay in me according to the modified Omori law (Equaon205
1). In contrast, swarms are related to underlying processes such as geothermal ac-206
vity or dyke emplacement, therefore they do not decay according to Equaon 1.207
We found this to be reflected in the cumulave event rate. We show contrasng208
cluster families which are type examples of mainshock-aershock sequences (Fig-209
ures 4 - 6) and swarm sequences (Figures 8 - 10). For the mainshock-aershock se-210
quences we have two cluster families from southern California; the 1992 Landers211
earthquake sequence and the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence, one from212
New Zealand - the September 2016 Te Araroa earthquake sequence and finally213
one smaller mainshock-aershock sequence located on the Grmsey Lineament,214
TFZ, Iceland which occurred in April 2013.215
On 28th April 1992 a magnitude 7.3 right lateral slip earthquake occurred near216
Landers in southern California. ALPS idenfied 15 785 events in the cluster family217
for the catalogue which had a cut-off magnitude of 2. More recently, two earth-218
quakes of M6.4 and M7.1 struck Ridgecrest on the 4th and 5th July, respecvely. In219
a catalogue with a minimum magnitude of 1, ALPS idenfied a cluster family size220
of 19 109 events for Ridgecrest, with aershocks sll occurring a month later. The221
daily and cumulave event rates for these two mainshock-aershock sequences222
in southern California can be seen in Figures 4a and 4b, respecvely.223
In addion to southern California, we explore other mainshock-aershock se-224
quences from New Zealand and the TFZ, Iceland. ALPS finds a cluster family of225
events which contains the oblique slip M7.1 Te Araroa, East Cape, New Zealand226
earthquake (Koulali et al., 2017). Similar to the cumulave event rates seen for227
SCEC catalogue in Figure 4, the curving power law decay can be seen reflecng228
the Omori-Utsu law of decline in aershock rate.229
In the TFZ, Iceland, ALPS idenfied a cluster family which included a M5.4230
event located on the Grmsey Lineament. The daily and cumulave event rate can231
be seen in Figure 6 and the locaon of the cluster can be seen in Figure 7. Here232
there are large transform faults and the submarine Tjornes Fracture Zone volcano233
(Figure 2), therefore the origin of the cluster families could be difficult to discern234
from locaon alone. From the cumulave event rate, the Omori-Utsu decay can235
be seen, implying this is a mainshock-aershock sequence relang to movement236
on the fault rather than hydrothermal acvity at the vents on the ocean floor. This237
is supported by the alignment of the earthquake locaons (Figure 7) which follow238
the orientaon of the Grmsey Lineament.239
The exponenal decay observed in the cumulave event rate of the mainshock-240
aershock sequences is contrasted by the clear steps in the cumulave event241
rates of the swarm sequences. This reflects the physical properes of the differ-242
ent types of sequences. Here we show the results of the cumulave event rates243
for swarms in the SCEC catalogue, in the Brennisteinoll geothermal area, Reyk-244
janes and near Lake Taupo, North Island, New Zealand.245
Although the majority of large cluster families in the SCEC catalogue are mainshock-246
aershock sequences containing earthquakes of>M6, there are also smaller clus-247
ter families idenfied by ALPS near areas known for their swarms. We show here248
one such example which was found near Cerro Prieto volcano in Baja, Mexico.249
Figure 8 shows the jump in cumulave event rate which is highly contrasng to250
the curved cumulave event rate seen in the mainshock-aershock sequences251
(Figures 4 - 6). A geothermal power staon is situated here so it has an acve252
hydrothermal system which is likely to be the cause of the swarm.253
North Island, New Zealand and the Reykjanes Ridge in Iceland, are two differ-254
ent tectonic sengs that both produce a mixture of volcanic and tectonic seismic-255
ity. North Island is situated on a subducon zone, leading to mainshock-aershock256
sequences occurring in the Benioff-Wada zone (Ansell and Adams, 1986). The257
Te Araroa earthquake cluster family is an example of mainshock-aershock se-258
quences within New Zealand, however the next largest cluster families are located259
near Lake Taupo, an area known for its many swarms (Sherburn, 1992; Hochstein,260
1995). We show the largest cluster family idenfied, a sequence containing 911261
events (Figure 9).262
In Reykjanes Ridge, Iceland, a diverging plate boundary and onshore manifes-263
taon of the mid-Atlanc Ridge, ALPS found a few cluster families, we show one264
consisng of 407 events located at the Brennisteinoll geothermal area (Figure265
10).266
From Figures 4 to 6, the cumulave event rate reflects the Omori exponenal267
power law decay in aershock rate. This is contrasted by Figures 8 to 10, where268
the swarm sequences have jumps in the cumulave event rate.269

4.2. Magnitude270
In addion to the lack of Omori law decay of events within a swarm, a swarm271
is defined as a series of earthquakes without an obvious mainshock (Heinicke272
et al., 2009; Cheng and Chen, 2018). In contrast, mainshock-aershock sequences273
have a clear mainshock and typically the next largest aershock is 1.1 to 1.2 mes274
smaller (Baths Law). For the mainshock-aershock sequences, Figures 11 - 13,275
the Omori law decay can be seen, although not as clearly as in the cumulave276
event rate. We also see a large magnitude at the beginning of the sequence,277
followed by a decrease in both magnitude and number of events. The magni-278
tude of the largest event in the series is approximately 1.1 to 1.2 mes larger than279
the magnitude of the largest aershock, as predicted by Baths law. Both of the280
SCEC catalogue cluster families (Figure 11) have a smaller mainshock-aershock281
sequence before the largest mainshock, whereas the Te Araroa earthquake has282
no preceding events. In the TFZ, the plot of the magnitude evoluon supports283
the conclusion that the cluster family occurring on the Grmsey Lineament is a284
mainshock-aershock sequence, as opposed to a swarm (Figure 13). In addion,285
similar to the Landers and Ridgecrest earthquake sequences, we see events occur-286
ring before the mainshock, however, these do not form another small mainshock-287
aershock sequence.288
We can compare this to the swarm-type cluster families, Figures 14 - 16, where289
there is sudden acvity, with many earthquakes occurring, but they quickly stop,290
with no Omori law decrease. This sudden start and stoppage of the earthquakes291
in the cluster family is another characterisc of swarms (Mcnu, 2005). There is292
also no obvious mainshock, with a cluster of events near the largest magnitude,293
inconsitent with Baths law. Finally, in the swarm sequences, there are occasion-294
ally a few events that occur a considerable amount of me aer the inial swarm.295
In order for ALPS to idenfy these as linked and within the sequence, the pair of296
events must have occurred in the same place. Such repeang earthquakes are297
common in hydrothermal systems, as the same fractures are resealed by the pre-298
cipitaon of hydrothermal minerals before failing again under pressure (Rodgers299
et al., 2015).300
In addion to the cumulave event rate and the magnitude evoluon, we301
have idenfied one more characterisc which may be used to classify the swarm302
and mainshock-aershock sequences. The links found by the ALPS algorithm are303
assigned to be the nearest-neighbour for the parent-daughter pairs. This leads to304
disncve force-directed cluster networks.305

4.3. Cluster Networks306
There are many ways to plot the parent-daughter links visually, however we307
have found the force-directed network using the Kamada-Kawai method to assign308
the posion of the nodes (Kamada and Kawai, 1989), to provide the most infor-309
maon and is the most disncve between the mainshock-aershock and swarm310
sequences.311
A force-directed network assigns a spring force to each of the edges, in this312
case the parent-daughter links between the earthquakes, and an electric repul-313
sive force to the nodes, in this case the earthquakes. The edges are aracted to314
one another whilst the nodes are repulsed. Therefore, those nodes with fewer315
edges i.e. earthquakes which are linked to only one event, will be further away316
than the nodes with many edges i.e. the earthquakes that are linked to more317
events. Furthermore, in the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, the geometric distance be-318
tween the nodes in the drawing is related to the graph theorec distance between319
the nodes (Kamada and Kawai, 1989). We can relate this to mainshock-aershock320
sequences and swarms thus. In mainshock-aershock sequences, earthquakes321
propagate away from the main rupture in both distance and me, therefore an322
earthquakes nearest-neighbour (its closest event in me and space) will likely be323
the previous earthquake in me. This leads to the classic branching aershocks,324
as one earthquake triggers the next. However, in swarms, they are related to an325
underlying process. The nearest-neighbour (and thus parent-daughter link) will326
more oen be the closest earthquake in distance, as we have repeang earth-327
quake triggered by the same process over extended periods of me or we may328
have small-scale fracturing, with a rapid succession of earthquakes over a short329
me period (McNu, 1996). Therefore, many earthquakes may be linked to the330
same earthquake. This will be similar at the beginning of mainshock-aershock331
sequences - we have a large number of earthquakes in short succession, with the332
number of aershocks then decaying in accordance with Omoris law (Equaon 1).333
Therefore, inially, it will be similar to the swarms, with many earthquakes linked334
to one. However, as me progresses, the earthquake number decreases, and we335
have the earthquakes triggering others along faults, we will have the earthquakes336
linked to only one other. This leads to the disnct shapes see in Figures 17 - 22.337
From the cluster networks of the mainshock-aershock sequences, Figures 17338
- 19, we can see the majority show a burst around the mainshock, as the large339
number of edges linked to the same nodes leads to an aracon between the340
edges. This is then followed by a dendric branching, where the smaller num-341
ber of edges linked to nodes, leads to the repulsion of the nodes away from342
the others, and due the greater graphical distance between them, we thus have a343
greater drawing distance. In comparison, the swarm sequences have lile branch-344
ing and the enre cluster family looks like a flower burst (Figures 20 - 22). For345
the Ridgecrest earthquake (Figure 17b), the sequence is sll in progression and346
aershocks are sll occurring at the me of wring, so we do not have the full347
cluster family. If we were to use the cluster network, without looking at the mag-348
nitude evoluon and cumulave event rate, it could be incorrectly classified as a349
swarm sequence. We therefore suggest the cluster networks are used alongside350
the magnitude through me plots and cumulave event rates to provide further351
support, and are most powerful when used retrospecvely.352
The branching shape of the mainshock-aershock sequences occurs as a fault353
ruptures and we have a stac transfer of stress along the fault, leading to the354
aershocks propagang and triggering along the fault planes and onto nearby355
neighbouring faults. We see larger branches, such as in Figure 17a and the Landers356
earthquakes, where we have aershocks triggering across two different faults. In357
contrast, the swarms typically cover a small spaal area, with no clear trend. This358
leads to the flower burst paern, and oen we have much later events linked to359
earlier events due to their close spaal proximity. If there is any branching, it has360
a fewer sequenal branches, with lots of smaller branches, for example in Figure361
20 which is the cluster network for Cerro Prieto volcano.362

4.4. Tesng the results on an ambiguous cluster family at Tullu Moye volcano,363
Main Ethiopian Ri364
The tectonics of the MER can lead to mixed seismicity, with volcanoes and365
faults being in close proximity. Hence, the geographical locaon of the cluster366
families idenfied by ALPS are not sufficient to determine if it is a swarm or mainshock-367
aershock sequence. Here, we briefly demonstrate that the characteriscs noted368
in this paper, can successfully discern the type of cluster, using a cluster family369
idenfied by ALPS at Tullu Moye as an example. We use the dataset of Green-370
field et al. (2019), a catalogue of 1004 events which covers the me period from371
06/04/2016 to 01/10/2017. The catalogue covers an area around the Bora-Tullu372
Moye volcanic field, located within one of the magmac segments which has a373
number of normal faults accommodang the extension running close to the vol-374
cano. Figure 23 shows the daily and cumulave event rate (23a) and the magni-375
tude evoluon of the events (23b).376

Tullu Moye catalogue of Greenfield et al. (2019) and (b) the magnitude of the events through me.
We can see there is no Omori decay in the aershock rate, and there is no ob-377
vious mainshock, which suggests this is a swarm sequence. This is supported by378
the force-directed Kamada-Kawai network (Figure 24) which is in a flower-burst.379
The confirmaon that this is a swarm and not a mainshock-aershock sequence380
agrees with the interpretaons made in Greenfield et al. (2019), which suggests381
the earthquakes are related to movement of hot fluids in the hydrothermal sys-382
tem.383

5. Discussion384
In Wilcock et al. (in prep.) a new clustering method was developed to specifi-385
cally idenfy both swarms and mainshock-aershock sequences in volcano-tectonic386
earthquake catalogues. However, although their triggering processes could be387
inferred from their locaons, it was not possibly to confidently state if a cluster388
family was of the swarm-type or a mainshock-aershock sequence. Here, we ran389
ALPS over three earthquake catalogues, the SCEC catalogue, the Iceland catalogue390
and a catalogue of seismicity from the North Island of New Zealand. These were391
chosen as they have a mixture of swarm and mainshock-aershock sequences392
and we could confidently infer the source of the cluster families. From here, we393
invesgated different stascs of the families to idenfy potenal metrics that394
we could confidently use to characterise the cluster families as either swarms or395
mainshock-aershock sequences. We found three metrics which were sufficiently396
disnct between the two types; the cumulave event rate, the magnitude of the397
events through me and the force-directed Kamada-Kawai cluster networks.398
We started with the cumulave event rate which, in the case of the mainshock-399
aershock cluster families, reflected the Omori law exponenal decay in aer-400
shock rates, as expected from mainshock-aershock sequences. In the case of401
the TFZ, the locaon of the cluster family was ambiguous, it was near both a402
submarine volcano and a transform fault. Through the cumulave event rate,403
the disncve power law decay could be seen and thus we were able to clas-404
sify this as a mainshock-aershock sequence and infer it was related to slip on405
the fault as opposed to renewed acvity in the TFZ volcanic system. We com-406
pared these mainshock-aershock sequences to three known swarm sequences;407
around Cerro Preito volcano, Mexico, Brennisteinoll geothermal area, Iceland408
and in the geothermal area south of Lake Taupo. In contrast to the curved cumu-409
lave event rate for the mainshock-aershock sequences, the swarm sequences410
had jumps or steps. This reflected a sudden increase in acvity, and then the411
equally quick decrease in acvity, characterisc of swarms (Holtkamp et al., 2011).412
Disnct properes of earthquake mainshock-aershock and swarm sequences413
are also observed when we plot the magnitude of the events in the cluster fam-414
ily through me. It is not quite as clear as in the cumulave event rate, but the415
Omori law decay in aershock rate can sll be seen for the mainshock-aershock416
sequences following the mainshock and the sudden bursts of acvity can be seen417
for the swarm sequences. In addion, the mainshock magnitude is 1.1 - 1.2 larger418
than the size of the largest aershock, following the empirical relaon found by419
Bath. This is not observed in the swarm sequences, and no clear mainshock could420
be discerned. Furthermore, the swarm sequences oen have long me periods421
between events. In order for ALPS to idenfy these events as linked to others,422
they must have nearly negligible inter-event distances. This implies there is a re-423
acvaon of the same process, later in me, possibly the repeated failure of the424
same crack in the volcanic system.425
Finally, we examined the force-directed Kamada-Kawai cluster networks. Al-426
though not quite as defined as the cumulave event rate and magnitude-me427
at the beginning of a sequence, the complete cluster families have disncve428
characteriscs that discriminaon of the two. For example, the inial mainshock429
causes many earthquakes to be triggered nearby which are close in me and430
space. This leads to the inial part of the sequence forming a burst similar to the431
paern seen in the cluster families of swarm sequences. However, as we progress432
through the sequence, the dendric branching of the earthquakes occurs as the433
slip and thus triggering connues along the fault. In swarm sequences, the close434
proximity of the earthquakes leads to the flower burst and the lack of movement435
implies repeang failure in a small area. This may be due to a dense network of436
fractures within hydrothermal systems failing within a short me period, similar437
to the triggering process proposed in Zhang and Shearer (2016).438
All of the characterisaons chosen are based upon the empirical laws which439
govern earthquake triggering, increasing our confidence in being able to correctly440
idenfy the mainshock-aershock and swarm sequences. With the excepon441
of the cluster networks, which depend on how the clustering algorithm assigns442
parent-daughter links, both the cumulave rate and magnitude through me can443
be used alongside other clustering methodologies. However, for volcano-tectonic444
earthquake catalogues, ALPS has been found to be the most successful (Wilcock445
et al., in prep.) at idenfying both swarms and mainshock-aershock sequences,446
therefore we can only confidently apply these disncons to the cluster families447
found by ALPS.448
6. Conclusions449
We have previously shown that the ALPS clustering algorithm is highly suc-450
cessful at idenfying both swarm and mainshock-aershock sequences for syn-451
thec volcano-tectonic catalogues and we are confident that this success extends452
to real world data. However, in many cases the results are not definive. We453
found three disnct features that could be used to help confirm or reject an ini-454
al ALPS diagnosis; the cumulave event rate, magnitude evoluon and Kamada-455
Kawai force directed cluster networks. The characteriscs of these graphs all re-456
flected the physical processes and empirical laws that govern earthquake trigger-457
ing. The results idenfy a cluster family of earthquakes near both the Grmsey458
Lineament and the Tjornes Fracture Zone volcano as being related to slip on the459
fault as opposed to renewed volcanic acvity, and the cluster family at Tullu-Moye460
volcano as related to circulaon in the hydrothermal system as opposed to acvity461
on the nearby faults. These proven methods can be implemented alongside ALPS462
to improve clustering and characterisaon of swarm and mainshock-aershock463
sequences, making ALPS an even more valuable tool.464

5.2 Addendum to Chapter 5: Alternative characterisations of clusters
In order to find the best metrics for separating the cluster families into swarms and mainshock-
aftershock sequences we tested numerous characteristics, here we present the additional met-
rics we investigated. Similar to previous authors (e.g. Zaliapin and Ben-Zion, 2016a,b; Bayliss,
2018a), we investigated properties related to the parent-daughter links. Due to the way ALPS
assigns the parent-daughter pairs, we cannot expect to use the same characteristics found
previously. The Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2013a,b) method only tests the nearest-neighbours
for links whereas we test all earthquake pairs for links, and then from those links, assign the
nearest-neighbour to be the parent.
As well as plotting the force-directed Kamada-Kawai cluster networks, we investigated prop-
erties inherent to these network; the average neighbour degree, the closeness centrality, the
degree centrality and the degree count percentage. A description of these and the relevant
equations can be found in the Appendix (section 8.1), here we only discuss why they were not
used as defining characteristics.
We tested the properties on four mainshock-aftershock sequences: Landers, Hector Mine,
Te Araroa and the Tjrnes Fracture Zone and four swarm sequences: two from near Taupo,
one from Reykjanes Ridge and one from Cerro Prieto.
5.2.1 Degree Counts
The degree counts simply shows the percentage of earthquakes that have each degree (num-
ber of neighbours). Figures 5.1a and 5.1b (and Figures 8.1a and 8.1b, Appendix) show the degree
count percentage for the mainshock-aftershock sequences. Figures 5.1c and 5.1d (and Figures
8.1c and 8.1d, Appendix) show the degree count percentage for the swarm sequences. The size
of the cluster family has an effect on the degree count and there are no clear differences be-
tween the swarms and mainshock-aftershock sequences, nor are there sufficient similarities
between the cluster families of the same type. This is most likely due to the initial burst we
see around the mainshock which leads to similar degree counts when compared to the burst
like swarm. Unfortunately, this feature and the lack of difference between the sequence types
continues with the remaining plots.
5.2.2 Degree Centrality
Similar to the degree count, but is presented as the fraction of potential nodes it could be con-
nected to. We can see clearly the locality of the cluster family affects the plot. For example, the
Landers (Figure 5.2a), Hector Mine (Figure 8.2a, Appendix) sequences and the sequence from
the TFZ (Figure 8.2b, Appendix) occurred on faults which ruptured and led to earthquakes be-
ing triggered very clearly along these fault lines. In the Te Araroa earthquake however, Figure
5.2b, we had small groups of earthquakes being triggered, for example near White Island vol-
cano, and on the tip of the East Cape peninsula which were spatially separated from the initial
mainshock. As a result this cluster family has a number of small bursts (Figure 20, Chapter 5)
which is potentially why it looks more similar to the swarms (Figures 5.2c and 5.2d; Figures 8.2c
and 8.2d, Appendix). Due to this potential overlap and the effect of location, we cannot jus-
tify using the degree centrality to cleanly separate the swarms from the mainshock-aftershock
sequences.
5.2.3 Average Neighbour Degree
In Figure 5.3 and Figure 8.3 in the Appendix we have plotted the average number of neighbours
against event number. Although we see a difference in the lateral spread of the events, this
is a function of the events occurrence in time which can also be seen in the magnitude of the
events through time. The magnitude of the events through time also allows us to investigate
Bths law and whether there is an obvious mainshock and thus has more diagnostic advan-
tages than the average neighbour degree. Here, there seems to be no obvious differences be-
tween the two for average neighbour degree aside from the events in time. Additionally, the
vertical spread changes between the same cluster type. Again, this is likely to be a function
of the initial mainshock burst in the mainshock-aftershock sequences. These sequences are
typically larger than the swarms, and thus the burst can be comparable in size to the swarms,
leading to similar results. We may expect more events with lower orders of nearest-neighbour
in the dendritic, branching aftershock tails but in the bursts, they are often also linked to only
one or two events, it is just there are many more, considerably smaller, branches.
5.2.4 Closeness Centrality
The closeness centrality is a measure of the shortest distance for nodes, considering all of
their neighbours, and the neighbours of their neighbours. Figures 5.4a and 5.4b (and Figures
8.4a and 8.4b, Appendix) show this for the mainshock-aftershock sequences. Figures 5.4c and
5.4d (and Figures 8.4c and 8.4d, Appendix) show this for the swarms. Yet again, we can see
the shape of the points is somewhat dictated by the events in time but we do see more of a
difference between the two. For the swarms, groups of events with similar closeness central-
ities are separated by white space. This is contrasted by the mainshock-aftershock sequences
which are much more continuous, even with the differences in location and cluster family size.
The events with the highest closeness centrality in the mainshock-aftershock sequences are
the mainshocks, whereas in the swarms it is the nearly the first event in the sequence. How-
ever, this distinction presents a problem for the Te Araroa cluster family, when nearly the first
event in the sequence is the mainshock (Figure 5.4b). Finally, in the mainshock-aftershock se-
quences, we also see trains of events which appear at a different angle to the main block, as
shown in the figure (e.g. Figure 5.4a). This is common to all four sequences, and differs from
the the swarms which tend to show a continuous decrease in closeness centrality with time
(Figures 5.4c and 5.4d). This is likely a reflection of the branching that occurs in the mainshock-
aftershock cluster families and the secondary aftershocks which form separate and different
branches, a feature we do not observe in swarm sequences where they are all linked to the
same underlying process.
However, despite these differences, it is clear that these differences are not as clear as the fi-
nal three metrics chosen. These three characteristics are sufficient to separate the mainshock-
aftershock sequences from the swarms, and therefore, unless you require extra clarification, it
is not necessary to use the closeness centrality. It is also considerably more ambiguous when
there is a lack of foreshocks, therefore even if this was to be used, we suggest it is supplemen-
tary.
5.3 Conclusions
In the manuscript we described the three clustering metrics we have identified for separating
swarm and mainshock-aftershock sequences; cumulative event rate, magnitude evolution and
the force-directed Kamada-Kawai cluster networks. Additionally, in this chapter I have briefly
discussed other characteristics I investigated and disregarded as potential metrics to be used
as alternative metrics; the percentage count of the number of degrees each node has, the
degree centrality, the average neighbour degree and the closeness centrality. This was due
to the insufficient differences between the mainshock-aftershock sequences and the swarm
sequences, and the lack of consistency between cluster families of the same type. I there-
fore concluded the three metrics I identify in the paper are far more consistent in separating
mainshock-aftershock and swarms sequences, and are simpler to use. It is these I use in all of
our analysis to separate the two types of cluster families in remainder of the thesis.

Chapter 6
Case studies
In the previous chapters I introduced the Automated Line Plotting Saddlepoint (ALPS) algo-
rithm. I described the motivation behind creating a new clustering algorithm, despite there
being many clustering methods available (Chapter 2), and explained in detail the methodol-
ogy of ALPS (Chapter 3). In Chapter 4 I validated the ALPS method by comparing it to other
clustering methods on their performance clustering synthetic catalogues, where it proved to
be the most accurate technique. In Chapter 5, I further characterised the cluster families
into mainshock-aftershock and swarm sequences and identified three metrics that could be
used classify the cluster families. Throughout this thesis, I have used a number of real-world
datasets. Here, I use the following format to present my results from a series of case studies.
First, I examine each earthquake catalogue, giving the geological setting, and for each cata-
logue use the ALPS method to cluster the seismicity. I then provide more detail on individual
selected cluster families, first giving the context, presenting a map of the cluster family and
then using the characteristics identified in the previous chapter (the cumulative event rate,
magnitude evolution and the force-directed Kamada-Kawai network graph) to classify them
into mainshock-aftershock or swarm sequences. I then conclude each subsection with either
a comparison to previous authors work, or if the cluster family has not yet been investigated,
postulate as to the potential trigger mechanisms for some of the cluster families. However,
a more in-depth interrogation into the meaning of the results in this chapter is given in the
following Discussion chapter.
6.1 Southern California
Figure 6.1  Map of southern California showing the major known faults, the locations of the mainshock for the
earthquake sequences used in this study (white stars) and the geothermal areas within southern California (green
diamonds).
The earthquakes in southern California have been used by many previous authors to de-
velop their clustering techniques (e.g. Gardner and Knopoff, 1974; Reasenberg, 1985; Zaliapin
et al., 2008), with the majority of earthquakes occurring along the 1200km San Andreas Fault
system (Hill, 1981; Schultz and Wallace, 1997). The fault accommodates the right lateral slip of
approximately 20 to 35 mm/yr as the Pacific plate moved northwards and the North American
plate moves southwards (Southern California Earthquake Data Center, 2013). The fault system
is extensive and although many of the individual faults have been mapped (Figure 6.1), there
are still faults which are blind and do not have a surface expression. Due to the high connec-
tivity and large fault segments, the San Andreas fault is capable of producing a high magnitude
earthquake with many aftershocks, which can trigger along neighbouring faults (see Chapter
2, subsection 2.2.1) leading to the sequences covering a substantial spatial area.
For this thesis, with the exception of the 2010 Baja and the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes,
we used the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) catalogue of Hauksson et al. (2012),
with a minimum magnitude equal to the completeness magnitude of 2. The locations of the
mainshocks for the earthquake sequences (white stars) can be seen in Figure 6.1, as can the
location of geothermal areas (green diamonds) within southern California where we identified
a number of potential swarm sequences. The first subset of the dataset that we ran ALPS over
was a 10 year time period between 01/01/2000 and 01/01/2010 and during this time there
were no >M7.0 earthquakes within southern California. From Figure 6.2, the 2D histogram of
IET against IER can be seen, with the ALPS dividing line also plotted. There is a strong back-
ground component and the dividing line has a strong diagonal element, suggesting the inter-
event time and inter-event distance are almost as equally important during this time period
for defining the cluster families. The cluster families identified can be seen tracing along the
known faults, as well as a number of cluster families near the Salton Sea, Cerro Prieto and
Coso geothermal areas (Figure 6.3). We characterised these as swarm sequences using the
three diagnostic metrics discussed in Chapter 3 and Chapter 5, and are likely related to the hy-
drothermal processes occurring. We interrogate these in more detail in the subsection 6.1.5.

As no large mainshock-aftershock sequences occurred during the 10-year period mentioned
above, we have also investigated four major earthquakes; the 1992 Landers earthquake, the
1999 Hector Mine earthquake, the 2010 Baja earthquake and the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes
(all shown on Figure 6.1). We have chosen these subsets as, for three of these (Landers, Hec-
tor Mine and Baja) there is extensive literature, and, contrastingly, the Ridgecrest earthquake
sequence allows us to investigate an ongoing cluster family. Additionally, the large amount of
work that has been conducted on the Landers, Hector Mine and Baja earthquake sequences
provides us with the opportunity to compare and evaluate the results of ALPS to other authors
results, which has helped with the development of the diagnostic metrics. Each of the time
periods we ran ALPS over contained different number of earthquakes and covered differing
lengths of time (Table 6.1). This means we could see how the 2D histogram IET-IER plots and
thus the ALPS dividing line was affected by catalogue size and length (Figure 6.4).

quences investigated in this thesis. Landers and Hector Mine used the SCEC catalogue of Hauksson et al. (2012).
Baja and Ridgecrest uses data from the USGS (https: // earthquake. usgs. gov/ earthquakes/ search/ ).
From the shorter datasets, Figures 6.4a, 6.4c and 6.4d, the clustered mode of seismicity
dominates, whereas for the Hector Mine event, a larger and longer catalogue size was run
and, similar to the result for the ten year subset (Figure 6.2), the background mode once again
dominates (Figure 6.4d). This illustrates a general point that selecting a narrow window around
an aftershock sequence itself tends to bias the result towards being more dominated by trig-
gering. It should be noted though, for each of these subdivisions of the catalogue shown in
Figure 6.4, the ALPS dividing line is much more vertical than in comparison to the one seen
in Figure 6.2 for the ten year southern California catalogue. This suggests that, in contrast to
the clustering identified in the period 2000-2010, the inter-event distance is the main control
on the clustering of the four mainshock-aftershock sequence subsets. I also ran the ALPS algo-
rithm over a comparatively very short time period (Ridgecrest, Table 6.1). For the Ridgecrest
earthquakes in July 2019, we only had one month of data, but ALPS has still successfully plotted
a line and clustered the catalogue, highlighting its potential for real-time cluster identification
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/
and observing how the cluster family evolves as it is developing.
In the next few sections I analyse each of these large earthquake sequences in more de-
tail, noting comparisons across the earthquake sequences and also how they differ. Finally, I
discuss the swarms in southern California, and how these sequences are distinguishable from
the mainshock-aftershock sequences.

6.1.1 Landers earthquake
The magnitude 7.1 Landers mainshock earthquake occurred on the 28th June 1992 within the
Eastern California Shear Zone. The motion was right-lateral slip and during the sequence, 100
kilometres of fault length in total, including previously unknown faults, ruptured (Hauksson
et al., 1993). Before ALPS is run over the dataset, it is useful to have a look at the daily event
rate plot to anticipate the presence of any sequences. From the event rate plot for the time
period containing the Landers earthquake sequence (Table 6.1), there are two clear sequences
present (Figure 6.5). Both of their event rates decay in accordance to Omoris exponential
power law (Equation 2.5), reflecting the aftershock decay rate of mainshock-aftershock se-
quences. The IET-IER 2D histogram for Landers can be seen in Figure 6.4a, and there is a strong
clustering mode at low interevent times and distances. The division between the two is small
and the ALPS line is almost vertical, suggesting a strong inter-event distance (IER) control on
the clustering.
The cluster families (circles coloured by cluster number) and independent events (smaller
white circles) identified by ALPS can be seen in Figure 6.6. ALPS found 13 cluster families and
spatially there is a lot of overlap between them. There are four independent events in this
subset of the catalogue, yet in the 2D IET-IER histogram there is a relatively dense background
mode. However, it should be noted that to generate Figure 6.4a I used an event number differ-
ence () of one. Therefore, we are only seeing the links for events consecutively in time. ALPS is
run over all pairs of events (i.e. increasing ), and thus will identify pairs of earthquakes which
are linked but are hidden within other sequences (Figure 3.2). The small number of indepen-
dent events identified suggests there were many overlapping sequences and thus these linked

events may have been missed or separated into further cluster families by other clustering
algorithms (discussed further in Chapters 3 and 7).
The cluster family containing the Landers earthquake has 15 785 events and we used this
as a type example of a mainshock-aftershock sequence in Chapter 5. The daily and cumulative
event rates can be seen in the second paper (Chapter 5, Figure 6a). Two sequences can be
seen, with a preceding sequence starting on 23rd April 1992, with a mainshock magnitude of
6.1 (Chapter 5, Figure 13a). The first sequence contains the Joshua Tree earthquake and the
largest aftershock of the Landers sequence is the Big Bear earthquake. In the initial analysis,
Hauksson et al. (1993) noted seven foreshocks preceded the Joshua Tree earthquake, according
to the ALPS method, we find there are 81 events which are identified as part of the cluster
family which occur prior to the Joshua Tree earthquake.

(2012) with a magnitude cut-off of 2 and for the time period 01/01/1992 - 01/01/1993 which includes the Landers
earthquake sequence. Independent events are white circles.
6.1.2 Hector Mine earthquake
On 16th October 1999, 36km away from the location of the Landers mainshock, a magnitude
7.1 earthquake occurred. This event, similar to the Landers earthquake, was due to right-lateral
slip on a near-vertical fault (Pollitz, 2005). Again, if we first look at the daily and cumulative
event rate for the subset of the catalogue, covering the period 01/01/1997 to 01/01/2003, we
can see a clear exponential decay after the Hector Mine earthquake (Figure 6.7). Additionally,
in mid 2001 and early 2002, there are two steps in the cumulative event rate which suggest
the presence of swarm sequences too.
The results of the ALPS clustering algorithm can be seen in Figure 6.8 and Figure 6.9 shows
the locations, magnitudes and the evolution of the earthquakes in the cluster family containing
the Hector Mine event. The earthquakes locate along the known fault traces and there has
most likely been a static transfer of stress between neighbouring fault segments. The Hector
Mine earthquake was also used as a type example to examine the defining characteristics of
mainshock-aftershock sequences versus swarm, and in the Appendix (section 8.2.1), we show
the cumulative event rate (Figure 8.5), the magnitude evolution (Figure 8.6) and the force-
directed Kamada-Kawai network graph (Figure 8.7). The Hector Mine mainshock-aftershock
sequence occurred in autumn 1999 and there wasnt another >M7 in the SCEC catalogue until
the 4th April 2010, when the M7.2 Baja earthquake occurred.

and the magnitude cut-off is 2.

cluster number can also be considered a proxy for time. The smaller white circles are independent events.

6.1.3 Baja earthquake
The Baja earthquake, also known as the El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake, was the first magni-
tude >7.0 earthquake in the SCEC catalogue (Hauksson et al., 2012) after the 1999 Hector Mine
earthquake. After two earthquakes of >M7.0 in seven years between 1992 and 1999, there was
a period of almost eleven years without a large earthquake on the San Andreas fault system.
The Baja earthquake occurred just south of the US border on the continuation of the transform
fault system in Mexico, and the fault itself was an unmapped extension of the Laguna Salada
fault.
From the daily and cumulative event rate, the mainshock-aftershock sequence for Baja
dominates, as seen by the exponential decay in the cumulative event rate (Figure 6.10). We
also can see another potential sequence at the start of July, however it is not possible to tell
if its a large aftershock of the Baja sequence forming a secondary mainshock-aftershock se-
quence, or another separate sequence.
Figure 6.10  Daily and cumulative event rates for the time period containing the Baja earthquake, 01/01/2010 -
01/06/2011. Catalogue used is the USGS catalogue with a magnitude cut-off of 2.
The results of the ALPS clustering algorithm can be seen in the Appendix (Section 8.2.2) in
Figure 8.8. Here, we show only cluster 6, the cluster which contains the M7.2 Baja earthquake
(Figure 6.11) and we can see it extends from the top of the Gulf of California to near Coso.
The extent of the aftershock sequence is larger than the area postulated by Hauksson et al.
(2011) and Wei et al. (2011). I suggest the events at the northernmost end of the sequence
are earthquakes triggered across faults by static triggering, in contrast, the main part of the
sequence has more alignment which suggests a rupture along a fault segment, with the events
decreasing in magnitude through time.
The magnitude of aftershocks and number of events decreasing with time are shown in
Figure 6.11  The cluster map of the Baja mainshock-aftershock sequence, scaled by magnitude and coloured by
date.
Figure 6.12, reflecting Omoris law. The difference in mainshock and largest aftershock mag-
nitude is approximately 1.3, slightly higher than the difference predicted by Bths law. In the
figure we can also see the additional sequence is part of the Baja mainshock-aftershock se-
quence and is a secondary sequence starting with a M5.7 event on 15th June, similar to the
Big Bear earthquake in the Landers sequence. The Baja sequence itself starts in early January
which contrasts with the findings of Hauksson et al. (2011) who suggested the foreshocks start
in March. Hauksson et al. (2011) also found a series of 15 foreshocks of >M2.0 in the 24 hours
preceding the mainshock, according to the ALPS clustering results, the number of foreshocks
is slightly higher at 21.
Figure 6.12  The magnitude of events in cluster 6 in the Baja earthquake sequence through time.
Figure 6.13  The force-directed Kamada-Kawai cluster network for cluster 6 in the Baja earthquake sequence.
In addition to the magnitude evolution, we can also look at the force-directed Kamada-
Kawai cluster network to see how the sequence developed (Figure 6.13). The burst around
the mainshock has two large branches of aftershocks, which suggests two diverging sets of
aftershocks. These most likely reflect a northwards and southwards propagation along the
rupture. In addition, there are a few more longer branches off the main right branch, these
are likely to be where the earthquakes have triggered along faults away from the main rupture.
The cluster network and the magnitude evolution reflect the characteristics seen in mainshock-
aftershock sequences. The data show it is likely the sequence continues after the end of the
subset of the catalogue (Figure 6.12).
The final mainshock-aftershock sequence we investigate in southern California occurred
during writing, the Ridgecrest earthquakes, and demonstrates how ALPS can successfully iden-
tify a cluster family as it is ongoing.
6.1.4 Ridgecrest earthquake
The Ridgecrest earthquakes occurred on 4th and 5th July 2019, and as of the time of writing,
the aftershock sequences are still ongoing. There were two mainshocks, both leading to their
own series of aftershocks, with the 5th July earthquake being the larger of the two. The cata-
logue is from the USGS and is one month long, restricted by the data available at the time of
analysis.
We run ALPS with a magnitude cut-off of one. I acquired the SCEC catalogue with a magni-
tude cut-off of two, so this gave me the opportunity to run ALPS over a dataset from southern
California with a different magnitude cut-off to see how the results differ. It also gave me
more earthquakes to input into the ALPS algorithm. The results of the clustering algorithm
can be seen in the Appendix (Figure 8.9, Section 8.2.3). The largest cluster is associated with
the largest Ridgecrest earthquake, but ALPS has still identified other cluster families occurring
within this catalogue. Even with only one month of data, we can identify the ongoing after-
shocks only related to the Ridgecrest mainshocks. The cluster family containing the Ridgecrest
earthquakes itself can be seen in Figure 6.14. The earthquakes align parallel and on top of the
main fault trace, but we can also see some triggering on a fault perpendicular to the initial rup-
ture. In Chapter 5, we presented the three defining metrics for mainshock-aftershock versus
swarm sequences, and, with the exception of the cluster network, both the cumulative event
rate and the magnitudes of the events through time already showed the characteristics of a
mainshock-aftershock sequence. The cluster network showed the initial burst seen in the clus-
ter networks of mainshock-aftershock sequences but did not yet show evidence of branching.
This demonstrated the value of using all three classifiers rather than relying on solely one, as
with only the force-directed Kamada-Kawai plot, we may have drawn the wrong conclusion,
classifying it instead as a swarm.

6.1.5 Swarm sequences

(2012) for the time period 01/01/2000 to 01/01/2010. The magnitude cut-off is 2.
For the clustering algorithms developed in southern California (e.g. Gardner and Knopoff,
1974; Reasenberg, 1985; Frohlich and Davis, 1990; Zaliapin et al., 2008), the focus was iden-
tifying mainshock-aftershock sequences. However, there are also areas where there is the
potential for swarm sequences to occur. In the ten-year time period from the 01/01/2000 to
01/01/2010 there was a lack of large (>M7.0) mainshock-aftershock sequences. However, from
the daily and cumulative event rate plot for this time period (Figure 6.15), there are number of
steps in the cumulative event rate which could be candidate swarm sequences. Indeed, the
ALPS algorithm did identify swarms near three geothermal areas; Coso Volcanic Field and the
Salton Sea in the US, and Cerro Prieto volcano, Mexico (Figure 6.1).

Figure 6.16  Four cluster families identified near geothermal areas. Cerro Prieto volcano is red triangle. (a) Cerro

earthquakes). (c) Coso Volcanic Field, cluster family 54. (d) Salton Sea, cluster family 301.
Four cluster families are shown in Figure 6.16, two from Cerro Prieto, one from Coso and one
from the Salton Sea. We can see from the Cerro Prieto volcano event locations that there are
two contrasting swarms, Figure 6.16a started in early 2002 and the locations run directly north-
south, just to the south of the volcano. In contrast, in January 2008 there is a cluster family
directly under the volcano with no obvious direction (Figure 6.16b). Both the Coso and Salton
Sea clusters, Figures 6.16c and 6.16d respectively, are similar to the cluster family 410 seen
at Cerro Prieto, with no preferred direction to the earthquakes. Based on location alone, we
may assume that the cluster family 135 which shows a north-south trace may be a mainshock-
aftershock sequence in comparison to the three other swarms.
Figure 6.17  The daily (blue bars) and cumulative (red line) event rates for two of the cluster families identified near
geothermal areas. (a) Cerro Prieto, cluster family 135 and (b) Salton Sea, cluster family 301.
First, we can look at the cumulative event rates and we see for both cluster family 135 and
cluster family 301 (Salton Sea), there is no power law decay and the cluster extends for a long
period of time which confirms they are more likely to be swarm-type sequences as opposed
to mainshock-aftershock sequences (Figure 6.17). The swarms discussed in Chapter 5 from
New Zealand also had a long life span which we attributed to the reactivation of a trigger
mechanism within a geothermal system. This was because in order to be identified as linked
to an earthquake in the same sequence they will have to have a very small inter-event distance
if the inter-event time is long.
Secondly, we have the magnitude evolution. Similarly to the cumulative event rate, we can
see the lack of Omori Law decay. In addition, we are also able to see if Bths law is observed (as
often seen in mainshock-aftershock sequences) or if there is no obvious mainshock (as seen in
swarm sequences). We show in Figure 6.18 the magnitude evolution for the other two swarm
sequences, cluster family 410 which is located at Cerro Prieto volcano (6.18a) and cluster family
54 which is located at the Coso Volcanic Field (6.18b). In both plots, there is no obvious Omori
law decay, and again they extend for a long period of time. Furthermore, there is no obvious

mainshock, particularly in the cluster family at Cerro Prieto volcano (Figure 6.18a). In Figure
6.18b, there is potentially a mainshock however the mainshock to largest aftershock ratio does
not observe Bths law. Additionally the mainshock and largest aftershock are within error
(0.3 from Kagan et al. (2006)). Therefore I would argue this is not an obvious mainshock and
further supports that this is a swarm sequence and not a mainshock-aftershock sequence.
Finally, we used the force-directed Kamada-Kawai cluster networks to distinguish between
mainshock-aftershock sequences and swarm-type sequences. The mainshock-aftershock se-
quences had a burst around the mainshock, followed by extensive dendritic branching. In con-
trast the swarms were a burst, or flower-like. Both of the swarms seen in Chapter 5 were from
large cluster families in New Zealand (>500 events), therefore the burst is very clear (Figure 23,
Chapter 5). However, for the smaller clusters seen in southern California and Baja California,
the burst is not always so obvious. For example, in Figure 6.24a, the force-directed Kamada-
Kawai cluster network for cluster family 301 near the Salton Sea, there is a flower-like burst
but there could also potentially be some branching structure too. Looking at the cumulative
event rate for cluster family (Figure 6.17b), it is identified as a swarm and, if we look more

two events.
closely at the cluster network, we can see the pale yellow branch is linked to a darker blue
branch. The colours represent the event in time and so this branch is linked to a much earlier
event. This is more typical of swarms, where we have a reactivation of a trigger mechanism. In
mainshock-aftershock sequences, the branching is normally more continuous in time, as the
aftershocks propagate along and around a fault. The relative size of the burst compared to the
small amount of branching, also suggests this is a swarm. The burst is proportionally larger,
and dominates the cluster network, whereas for the mainshock-aftershock sequences (e.g.
Figure 6.13), there are many events in the burst but extensive, long branching from it, which
we do not see here. If it is not easily convincing for the smaller sequence, there is an alternate
plot of the parent-daughter relationship which can be used, a matrix plot. In the matrix plot
of the cluster network, every event in the cluster is ordered by time along the x and y axes
and if there is a link between the two events, the corresponding square is coloured in. For the
mainshock-aftershock sequences, this is normally a diagonal line down close to the middle of
the plot as each event is linked to its nearest-neighbour and the aftershocks tend to propagate
in a direction therefore, often making the nearest-neighbour its time-consecutive neighbour.
However, in swarm sequences, they can often be linked to earlier events as the same part of
the volcanic or geothermal system is activated, therefore the nearest-neighbour is its closest
neighbour in distance rather than time. For these matrix plots there is a much larger spread,
as seen in Figure 6.19b which is the equivalent matrix plot of the cluster family 301. Using
the matrix plots for the remaining clusters (Figure 6.20), we can see there is a lot of spread,
confirming these are swarms rather than mainshock-aftershock sequences. Therefore, while
cluster family 135, near Cerro Prieto which initally, just based on location, looked like it could
be a mainshock-aftershock sequence tracing a fault, is instead identified here as a swarm-type
sequence.
We discuss the potential mechanisms for these swarms in the following chapter and now
move to a different locality. Southern California has both swarms and mainshock-aftershock
sequences, but they are typically in quite distinct locations. Due to the geographic separation,
it is excellent for testing ALPS and the metrics used for distinguishing between the mainshock-
aftershock sequences and swarm sequences. To explore the potential more generally, the next
section looks at data from North Island, New Zealand which has extensive faulting and active
volcanoes, often in close proximity. Therefore, we can test ALPS and investigate the clusters
from a more complex volcano-tectonic setting, which bears more of a relation to the Main
Ethiopian Rift.

6.2 North Island, New Zealand
New Zealand is broadly situated on a subduction zone, albeit in different senses to the north
and south, with the two directions of subduction separated by a large strike slip fault. This is
due to the oblique convergence of the Australian plate on the Pacific plate. Thus, there are
large fault systems running throughout both islands, and a back-arc basin of volcanoes on the
North Island (Figure 5, Chapter 5). We concentrate on the North Island as it contains a mixture
of both volcanic and tectonic seismicity, allowing us to test ALPS on another dataset containing
both swarms and mainshock-aftershock sequences.
The North Island Fault System accommodates the majority of the oblique convergence,
with additional faults accommodating regional extension in the back-arc basin - the Central
Volcanic Region (CVR). These faults within the CVR provide pathways for magma and hot fluid
movement, similar in this sense to the mixture of faults and magma observed in the magmatic
segments of the Main Ethiopian Rift. Rhyolitic and high-alumina basaltic magmas combined
with the extensional setting and the large-scale faulting means the CVR has the potential for
explosive volcanism (Cole, 1990). Hence, the volcanoes in New Zealand are well-monitored,
with a comprehensive seismic network. We took a sample 2-year time period from 01/01/2016
to 01/01/2018, which included the large Te Araroa earthquake that occurred north of East Cape,
and with a minimum magnitude of 0.1 to ensure we included any additional seismicity related
to volcanic activity. Indeed, during this time, in addition to the 2016 Te Araroa earthquake
sequence, there were numerous swarms south of Lake Taupo.
The 2D IET-IER histogram with the ALPS dividing line can be seen in the Appendix (Figure
8.12) and the results of the clustering can be seen in Chapter 4 (Figure 18). In the following
two subsections we investigate a number of cluster families; a few cluster families near Taupo
(subsection 6.2.1), and the Te Araroa earthquake sequence (subsection 6.2.2).
6.2.1 Taupo, Central Volcanic Region
A number of large cluster families south of Lake Taupo were identified by the ALPS clustering
algorithm. They were located in the Tokaanu geothermal area which is intersected by a num-
ber of faults accommodating the extension in the back-arc. The closest active volcano is Mount
Tongariro which lies 20km south west of Lake Taupo (labelled T in Figure 18, Chapter 4). We
investigate four cluster families, 154, 208, 233 and 235. The locations of these cluster families
can be seen in Figure 6.21. Three of the four clusters are located at the south west edge of the
lake, with one cluster slightly further north. The Taupo area has a mixture of extensional fault-
ing and volcanic vents, with a geothermal area to the south (Figure 6.22), in between the south
of the lake and Mount Tongariro. This could make it difficult to discern if the cluster families
are related to faults or geothermal activity, if we based the distinction purely on location.
In Chapter 5 we showed cluster family 235 as an example of a swarm-type sequence and the
differences in the three classifiers used (cumulative event rate, magnitude evolution and force-
directed Kamada-Kawai cluster network) when compared to mainshock-aftershock sequences.
We look at two of these metrics for the remaining three cluster families here - the magnitude
of the events through time and the cluster network.
Figure 6.23 shows the magnitude evolution for the cluster families 154, 208 and 233. (The
magnitude through time for cluster family 235 can be seen in Figure 17, Chapter 5). All three
plots have no obvious mainshock and there is no Omori law decay which indicates these are
swarm sequences. Another, often defining, feature of swarms is the nature of their quick start
and end (McNutt, 2005). This can be seen clearly for Figure 6.23a and, although not quite
as defined, both Figure 6.23b and 6.23c have a distinct start and the majority of events fall
within a clear window. This is more noticeable when compared to the mainshock-aftershock
sequences of, for example, Hector Mine (Figure 8.6) and the Tjrnes Fracture Zone (Figure
15, Chapter 5), which have earthquakes preceding the mainshock and a slower decrease in
number of events.
The force-directed Kamada-Kawai cluster networks also support the hypothesis these clus-
ter families are swarm-type not mainshock-aftershock type. We can see from Figure 6.24 the
burst or flower like pattern of the parent-daughter links, rather than a chain of aftershocks. We
mentioned in the previous section that the matrix plots may be used instead of the Kamada-
Kawai cluster network if it is hard to discern whether there may be a potential branching. Here,
we demonstrate that again, if it is a small cluster network, the matrix plot removes any doubt
that it is a swarm-type as opposed to mainshock-aftershock. We can see in Figure 6.24c the
Kamada-Kawai cluster network for the small cluster family 154 which consists of 119 events and
the matrix plot for the same cluster family (Figure 6.24d). The matrix plot has a lot of spread

and is unambiguously a swarm. This also highlights the need to consider a couple of classifiers
when investigating cluster families, as often for the smaller cluster families, it is more difficult
to judge if the cluster network is a burst or not.
In summary, from the magnitude evolution and the cluster networks we can see that the
cluster families are of the swarm-type. Therefore they are most likely related to volcanic and
geothermal processes as opposed to faulting. This agrees with the locations of the faults and
vents mapped by Seebeck et al. (2014), as shown in Figure 6.22. There is a lack of faulting
near the cluster family 154 but it is near a few volcanic vents. For cluster families 208, 233
and 235, they are located at the end of a few faults present in the region. From the Coulomb
failure stress figure (Figure 2.4) in Chapter 2, we can see the stress often builds up around the
tips of faults therefore we might expect earthquakes to be triggered here. However, they are
also near a number of volcanic vents including a large fumarole, Hipaua (Soto et al., 2019).
Our analysis suggests these are most likely swarms and are thus more likely to be related to
the movement of hot fluids through the network of fractures in the geothermal area than
mainshock-aftershock sequences relating to release of stress at the end of the faults (Sander-
son and Zhang, 1999).
In addition to the multiple cluster families identified in the Central Volcanic Region, during
the two-year time period a large M7.1 earthquake occurred off East Cape, on the boundary
between the Pacific and Australian plates.

6.2.2 Te Araroa earthquake
On 1st September 2016, a M7.1 earthquake approximately 100km off the north east coast of
North Island. The earthquake was widely felt over the island and generated a 30cm high
tsunami which hit East Cape (Warren-Smith et al., 2018). The ALPS clustering method identi-
fied a number of aftershocks triggered on the northernmost tip of the peninsula and a number
on the faults in the Bay of Plenty, including around White Island volcano (Figure 6.25).
Figure 6.25  The cluster family containing the Te Araroa earthquake. The colourbar is the depth of the earthquake
(km) and the earthquakes are scaled by the magnitude. Cross section (A-B) of wedge shown in Figure 6.26.
We showed the daily and cumulative event rate, magnitude through time and cluster net-
work for the cluster family in Chapter 5, which show the characteristics of a mainshock-aftershock
sequence. However, in contrast to previous sequences (e.g. Landers, Hector Mine etc.), there
was a distinct lack of foreshocks in the weeks and months preceding the earthquake. The first
earthquake in the cluster family is the day before, which agrees with the findings of Warren-
Smith et al. (2018), and there are in total 24 foreshocks before the mainshock, including a M5.7
event.
In addition to the lack of foreshocks, we also see a relatively short aftershock sequence
(Chapter 5, Figure 14). The mainshock-aftershock sequences in southern California all have a
considerable number of earthquakes occurring six months later, but for the Te Araroa earth-
quake, the aftershock number drops to very low levels after three months. Two weeks into
the earthquake sequence, White Island volcano erupted with minor ash eruptions on 13th
September, three and a half months after phreatic explosions on 27th April (Global Volcanism
Program, 2017). Looking at Figure 6.25 we can see a number of shallow earthquakes around
White Island which occurred in October and November 2016.
Further to the small group of earthquakes around White Island, there is another cluster
on the tip of the East Cape peninsula which is clearly separated from the group containing
the initial mainshock. There is approximately 10 kms between the two cluster groups and a
significant difference in average depth. The cluster around the mainshock has an average depth
of 15km and the earthquakes on the tip of East Cape have an average depth of 21km. 20km is
the approximate depth of the top of the slab, potentially within the underplated sediments or
at the boundary between the two plates (Figure 6.26). The inclusion of these earthquakes on
East Cape in the sequence contrasts with the findings of Warren-Smith et al. (2018) who only
include the earthquakes around the mainshock.
Figure 6.26  Cross section of wedge, labelled A-B on Figure 6.25. Figure edited from Wallace et al. (2009).
We used this earthquake sequence in Chapter 5 to confirm the pattern of the force-directed
Kamada-Kawai cluster network for the cluster families of mainshock-aftershock type. Figure
20, Chapter 5 shows the distinctive burst around the mainshock, followed by branches of af-
tershocks. A number of the branches have earthquakes which are later in time (yellows and
oranges) connected to earlier earthquakes (darker blue). This reflects the spread in locations
in the sequences, from White Island volcano to East Cape as we have secondary aftershocks
triggered close in time but in different localities so they are linked to different branches of
aftershocks.
The Te Araroa earthquake cluster family allowed us to confirm the three metrics we use
to differentiate mainshock-aftershock sequences from swarm sequences are also applicable
at a different tectonic setting, a convergent plate boundary as opposed to the conservative
boundary location of the southern California sequences. In contrast, the type of sequence
for the cluster families in Taupo were ambiguous due to their location near both extensive
faults and geothermal areas. We were able to use the three characteristics to identify the
cluster families as swarm sequences and thus related to geothermal processes. Due to the
mixed processes occurring here, Taupo and the Central Volcanic Region in North Island can be
considered analogous to the Main Ethiopian Rift and we now investigate seismicity in another
part of the globe which can also considered to be a good analogue: Iceland.
6.3 Iceland
Iceland is a unique locality geologically. Situated above a thermal plume and on a spreading
centre, there are 20 active volcanoes and extensive fault systems (Siebert and Simkin, 2002).
The combination of the divergent plate boundary and hot spot have led to increased temper-
atures beneath Iceland and thus increased melting, increasing the normal oceanic plate thick-
ness from 7km to an average of 29km making this a subaerial expression of the mid-Atlantic
Ridge (McKenzie and Parker, 1967; Weir et al., 2001).
We consider two localities in Iceland; Reykjanes Ridge and the Tjrnes Fracture Zone, the
locations of which are shown in Figure 4 in Chapter 5.
6.3.1 Tjrnes Fracture Zone
The Tjrnes Fracture Zone is located offshore of northern Iceland. It is a 120km long, broad
transform zone connecting the onshore Northern Volcanic Zone and offshore Kolbeinsey Ridge
sections of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). The 18 mm yr1 of plate motion is accommodated
on three major structures, the Hsavk-Flatey Fault and the Dalvk and Grmsey Lineaments
(Homberg et al., 2010; Metzger et al., 2013). Figure 4 in Chapter 5 shows the locations of the
Hsavk-Flatey Fault (HFF) and Grmsey Lineament (GL) within the TFZ, and the location of the
TFZ within Iceland. The majority of the dextral transform zone movement occurs on a master
fault, the HFF, with a series of smaller en-echelon faults oblique to the spreading direction in
the GL also accommodating part of the movement. The stress is released by sinistral slip on
these N-S trending faults. The GL is a younger structure, and the mechanism of smaller en-
echelon faults accommodating the plate motion further suggest it is in an less mature stage
of its development. However, as the rift propagates northwards, it is likely that the GL will
become the new master fault, replacing the HFF (Bergerat and Angelier, 2008).
In addition to the tectonics, the TFZ is volcanically active. The eastern part of the TFZ has
high fissure activity with dyke intrusions propagating northwards. Offshore, the Nafir, Hll,
Mnaeyjar Ridge and Kolbeinsey Ridge are all centres of volcanic activity. The presence of the
hotspot under the Northern Volcanic Zone, continues into the TFZ, with the crust near Grmsey
island being as thick as 17km. Considering the typical oceanic crust thickness of 7km, and the
earthquakes still occurring below 10km depth within the TFZ, this supports the continued,
though decreasing, influence of the hotspot to beyond the Kolbeinsey Ridge.
In the easternmost part of the GL the high intrusive dyke activity combined with pores of
fluids released from basalts at 5-10km depth leads to hydrothermal activity (Stefansson et al.,
2008) and located on the GL we have the Grmsey Hydrothermal Field. The presence of the
faults running across the GL provide pathways for the hydrothermal fluids, changing the pore
pressure of the faults and promoting larger earthquakes. This high permeability is one of the
reasons vent fields are associated with major faults (Riedel et al., 2001).
In Chapter 5 we showed one cluster family from the TFZ and identified that it was a mainshock-
aftershock sequence on the Grmsey Lineament. In February 2018, there were a number of
earthquakes in the TFZ, located near the Nafir part of the TFZ volcanic system (east of Grmsey
Island) which was reported as a swarm on a number of websites and potentially related to vol-
canic activity (Iceland Magazine, 2018; Frmann, 2018; Blakovi, 2018). Here we investigate
if it is indeed an earthquake swarm and whether we can attribute the sequence to volcanic
activity.
The IET-IER 2D histogram with the ALPS dividing line and the results of the clustering al-
gorithm can be seen in the Appendix (Section 8.2.6) in Figures 8.13 and 8.14. A number of
cluster families have been identified during the period 01/09/2017 to 01/09/2018 but we are
interested in cluster family 8 which contains the swarm of earthquakes which occurred in
February 2018 and is the largest family with 4813 events. This sequence is shown in Figure
6.27.
There is northwest-south east trend in the locations of the events which reflects the strike of
the Grmsey Lineament. If this is a swarm, we would expect to see a trend following a dyke in-

trusion, for example. However, we also see this in mainshock-aftershock sequences, where the
events rupture along a fault plane (for example, in the Landers and Ridgecrest earthquakes).
In order to determine whether it is a swarm or mainshock-aftershock sequence we can look
at the three classifiers identified in Chapter 5.
The first is the cumulative event rate (Figure 6.28a), and the power law decay in February
2018 suggests an Omori rate decay in aftershocks. If we also compare this to the magnitude of
events through time, Figure 6.28b, we can see there is no distinct start and end which is more
typical of swarms. However, the ratio between the largest event and second largest event is
1.08, which does not fall within the 1.1-1.2 range suggested by Bth. As 1.08 is close to 1.1 and as
Bths law is on average, we cannot discount this as a mainshock-aftershock sequence solely
for this reason.
Finally, we also can look at the force-directed Kamada-Kawai cluster network (Figure 6.29).
This clearly shows more similarities with the mainshock-aftershock sequences than the swarm
sequences. We have the burst around the mainshock, preceded by a sequence of foreshocks
and followed by a branching sequence of aftershocks. The two separate branches suggests
two different ruptures, potentially due to a static transfer of stress onto a neighbouring fault,
for example as seen in the Landers and Ridgecrest earthquakes (Figures 6.6 and 6.14). From
Figure 6.27 we can see this is likely to be perpendicular to the main fault. The Grmsey Lin-
eament trends NW-SE, but it is known there are number of faults perpendicular to this which
accommodate some of the transform stress (Bergerat and Angelier, 2008).
Therefore, contrary to news reports at the time, it is likely this swarm of earthquakes in

February 2018 was instead a mainshock-aftershock sequence and was not related to volcanic
activity in the TFZ. This illustrates the advantage of using ALPS and identifying the types of
clustering as diagnostic tools, given this is now the second sequence on the TFZ where we
have shown it to be a mainshock-aftershock sequence and not a swarm sequence.
6.3.2 Reykjanes Ridge and Peninsula
The Reykjanes Ridge (which includes the Reykjanes Peninsula) lies in south-western Iceland
and is part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, with the crust thickening as you move from the start of the
Reykjanes Ridge (11km thick) to Hengill volcano (21km thick) at the east of the Peninsula. This is
attributed to a rise in mantle potential temperature of approximately 140C as you move closer
to the centre of the plume (Weir et al., 2001). Offshore, seismicity traces along the ridge axis,
but onshore it is located in the high-temperature geothermal areas (Figure 6.30). On the tip of
the peninsula there is Reykjanes volcano and then in an en-echelon pattern, stepping right, we
have the geothermal fields of Svartsengi, Fagradalsfjall, Krsuvk and Brennisteinsfjll. Three
of these are volcanic fissure swarms; Reykjanes, Krsuvk and Brennisteinsfjll which trend NE-
SW, are spatially separated, and form a series of normal faults, tensile fractures and fissures,
which are thought to be the surface expression of dyke intrusions (Saemundsson, 1978; Keiding
et al., 2009). They each have distinct volcanic signatures, with varying geochemistry (Pagan
et al., 2017), and have each erupted within the last 1000 years. The Reykjanes geothermal
area can be considered an analogue of submarine hydrothermal systems due to the hot fluid
circulating being undiluted seawater and it erupted the most recently in 1926. To the east of
Reykjanes is the largest geothermal area, Krsuvk, which is being driven by the heat from a
historic eruption (Pagan et al., 2017), with it most recently erupting in 1340. The farthest west
and smallest field, Brennisteinsfjll, erupted a year later in 1341 and consists of a number of
shield volcanoes and craters which vary between approximately 100m to 600m in elevation
(Global Volcanism Program, 2013). All three are basaltic and the crustal thickness continues to
increase as we move towards the plume centre (Weir et al., 2001).
In Figure 6.31 we present the IET-IER 2D histogram for the time period 01/09/2013 to 01/09/2014
for the Reykjanes Ridge. Comparing to the previous IET-IER histograms, we can see there
are potentially three different modes, as opposed to the normal background versus clustered

mode and divide we typically see. This presents a difficulty when deciding where to draw the
line. However, if we instead look at the Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation of the contours,
Figure 6.31b, shows there is still a clear saddle point, which enables ALPS to easily plot the
dividing line.
The clusters identified by ALPS can be seen in Figure 6.30. The cluster families reflect the
locations of the geothermal areas with Reykjanes Ridge, with the cluster families within one
field being distinct spatially from the cluster families in the next field. We investigated a clus-
ter family in Chapter 5 which was located in the most western and smallest geothermal field
of Brennisteinsfjll (Figure 8.15, Section 8.2.7, Appendix). In this chapter we investigate an-
other cluster family, located at the most eastern geothermal area, Reykjanes, on the tip of the
peninsula.
The locations, depths and magnitudes of the earthquakes within the sequence are shown in
Figure 6.32. There are a range of magnitudes from less than one to greater than five, which can
be seen more clearly in Figure 6.33a. The difference between the largest magnitude event and
second largest magnitude event is approximately 1.25, which is greater than the ratio predicted
by Bths law, but could fall within the 1.1 - 1.2 ratio within error. However, we dont see the
Omori law decay of aftershocks, and the sudden start and end to the sequence is more swarm-

like in character. This absence of a power law transient is also seen in the cumulative event
rate (Figure 6.33b). From these two plots we have conflicting information, we have Bths law
potentially being observed within error, which is typical of mainshock-aftershock sequences
and appear to have an obvious mainshock with a magnitude 5.1 event, but we lack the Omori
law decay seen in aftershock sequences, and the sequence has a distinct start and end, both
more typical of swarm sequences.
In order to resolve the ambiguity, we examine the force-directed Kamada-Kawai cluster
network and the alternative representation of parent-daughter links, the matrix plot. Figure
6.34 shows the cluster network for cluster family 20. We can see that generally the shape is
in a burst, but interestingly we have smaller bursts within this. There isnt a long branching
tail and, if we look at the matrix plot too (Figure 6.34b), we can see it shares more character-
istics with the swarms than mainshock-aftershock sequences. It is therefore most likely this
is indeed a swarm as opposed to a mainshock-aftershock sequence. The tip of the Reykjanes
Peninsula has a geothermal area of >1km2 (Pagan et al., 2017) and last erupted in 1926, po-
tentially even as recently as 1966 (Global Volcanism Program, 2013; Bjrnsson et al., 2018).
Historically, swarms containing magnitude >4.0 events have occurred and have been linked to
activity in the geothermal area. Changes in the hot springs in 1926 were linked with a swarm
containing events with a maximum magnitude of 4.7 and a ground fissure opening in 1967 was
associated with events of a maximum magnitude of 4.9 (Bjrnsson et al., 2018). This review

reinforces our identification of the cluster family on the end of the Reykjanes Peninsula as a
swarm sequence.
Having looked at a number of analogues, we now move onto the MER itself, and applying
ALPS and the techniques tested on the previous datasets to two catalogues from the MER; the
EAGLE catalogue and a catalogue from Tullu Moye.
6.4 Main Ethiopian Rift
The initial aim of this project was to develop a clustering methodology which could be used in
areas of hybrid seismicity, where we have mixed volcanic and tectonic origins in close proxim-
ity. From here we could help quantify geophysical unrest at the volcanoes in the Main Ethiopian
Rift and contribute to RiftVolc. Thus far, we have shown the ability of ALPS to cluster many dif-
ferent datasets, and have used the analogues in Iceland and New Zealand to demonstrate its
effectiveness in clustering seismicity that contains both swarms and mainshock-aftershock se-
quences. We have found characteristics of the individual cluster families which may be used to
separate swarm-type sequences from mainshock-aftershock sequences and we have applied
these techniques to selected cluster families in the catalogues investigated so far. For some
of the cluster families, it was used to confirm that the metrics were reliable (e.g. for the large
mainshock-aftershock sequences in southern California) but we have also used them to clas-
sify cluster families which could be either if we based the distinction purely on location (e.g. in
the TFZ and near Taupo). It is these statistics that we use to separate the cluster families into
mainshock-aftershock sequences from the swarm sequences in the Main Ethiopian Rift using
the EAGLE dataset.
6.4.1 EAGLE dataset
The EAGLE dataset has been extensively analysed throughout this thesis and has been used to
demonstrate the versatility of the ALPS clustering method for identifying clusters in volcano-
tectonic settings. The clusters identified by ALPS have already been presented in Chapter 3,
Figure 3.16. Here, we analyse these clusters further, using the classifiers identified in Chapter
5 and demonstrate the effect of cluster family size.
The cluster families identified in the EAGLE catalogue are considerably smaller than pre-
vious cluster families investigated. The largest cluster is cluster family 2 with 726 events, but
most of them have fewer than a hundred events, with over 90% having fewer than 50 events
and 65% having fewer than 10 events. When plotting the daily event rate, the magnitude evolu-
tion and the cluster networks, it becomes impossible to distinguish the mainshock-aftershock
versus swarm-type sequences for cluster families of below fifty events.
We start by showing a cluster family of 726 events which we can identify as a mainshock-
aftershock sequence. Similarly to the February 2018 sequence in the Tjrnes Fracture Zone,
there is some ambiguity present in the time-distance maps, but this is resolved by considering
all three classifiers. There is no obvious power law decay either the cumulative event rate (Fig-
ure 6.35a) or in the magnitude evolution plot (Figure 6.35b). However, there is no rapid start
and end typical of swarms either. Finally, the largest earthquake and the second largest earth-
quake are close in magnitude and do not follow Bths law. From these two plots alone, the
conflicting information makes it difficult to discern if the sequence is a swarm or mainshock-
aftershock type. In Figure 6.36a, there is no burst such as we find around a mainshock or in
the swarms. Instead, we can see a clear branching typical of the tails of the large mainshock-
aftershock sequences. This is supported by the matrix plot (Figure 6.36b) where there is a
straight line running down the central graph, in contrast to the wide spread we typically find
in matrix plots of swarms (e.g. Figures 6.34b and 6.24d).
Figure 6.35  (a) The daily (blue bars) and cumulative (red line) event rate for cluster family 2 in the EAGLE catalogue
of Keir et al. (2015) and (b) the magnitude through time.
The daily event rate plot (Figure 6.35a) shows the sequence appears to start on 23rd Octo-
ber 2001 which is the start of the catalogue. Therefore it is possible that a mainshock oc-
curred before the start of the deployment and is not included in the catalogue. If so, we
are seeing the end of the mainshock-aftershock sequence, consistent with the force-directed
Kamada-Kawai cluster networks showing a pattern similar to that of the tail of mainshock-
aftershock sequences. If we consider the whole sequence, we would therefore be seeing the
end of the power-law decay in aftershock rate, which would explain why the Omori law de-
cay is not obvious in the daily events plot (Figure 6.35a). Finally, if we take the largest event
to be the largest aftershock then the mainshock, assuming Bths law, would have been be-
tween 4.2 and 4.6. Unfortunately, this is not large enough to be recorded in the Global CMT
catalogue (https://www.globalcmt.org/) so we cannot verify this. On the other hand the
sequence is located on the Ankober fault system. Overall, it is more plausible that this is part
of a mainshock-aftershock sequence than a swarm sequence. However, within the MER we do

also have swarm sequences, such as the cluster family 4 which was identified by ALPS.
Cluster family 4 consists of 99 events. Both the cumulative event rate (Figure 8.16a, Sec-
tion 8.2.8, Appendix) and the magnitude evolution (Figure 8.16b, Section 8.2.8, Appendix)
exhibit the typical features observed in swarm sequences. There is no clear mainshock, the
seismicity starts and stop rapidly, and we dont observe an Omori-type decay. In this case,
the force-directed Kamada-Kawai cluster network is more difficult to characterise. Due to the
small number of events in the cluster family, it could be three main branches of an aftershock
sequence or it could be a burst. If we look carefully at the network we can see much later
events (yellow in colour) being connected to much earlier events (blue in colour) which hap-
pens more often in swarms. This is due to events being located much more closely together,
so the inter-event time difference can be larger in order for them still to be linked, whereas
in mainshock-aftershock sequences we tend to see earthquakes linked by time as the static
stress is transferred along the fault from event to event. The matrix plot, shows the spread of
the parent-daughter links more clearly confirming this is more likely to be a swarm sequence
(Figure 8.17b, Appendix).
The size of the clusters can affect the clarity of the classification. This is an issue in the EAGLE
dataset, for example, if we look at some of the next largest cluster families, consisting of 49
and 19 events, it becomes apparent that especially for the Kamada-Kawai cluster networks, it is
not clear if they are bursts or have aftershock branching (Figures 6.37a and 6.37c). The matrix
plots show a spread which is a feature of swarm sequences (Figures 6.37b and 6.37d). On the
other hand, the cumulative event rates are inconclusive due to the limited number of events
(Figures 6.38a and 6.38b). There is no clear Omori law decay but it is also hard to confidently
rule it out. The magnitude evolution shows more clearly that there is a sharp start and end
to the group containing the majority of the events. The large inter-event time differences are
consistent with the hypothesis this sequence is a swarm as the events can only be linked if
they are close in space, for example due to a reactivation of a certain trigger within a volcanic
system. Finally, there is no obvious mainshock in Figure 6.38d, and though it may be argued
that there is an event larger than the rest in Figure 6.38c, it does not observe Bths law.
In summary, although the size of the cluster does affect the distinction of the characteristics
used to separate swarms and mainshock-aftershock sequences, it is normally possible to say
it is more similar to one type than the other. In both of the examples, these are most likely
swarm sequences related to geothermal processes around Dofen (Cluster family 42) and Oa
Caldera (Cluster Famly 44). With this in mind, we move to the smallest dataset in terms of
spatial area covered and number of events which is the earthquake catalogue of Greenfield
et al. (2019b) from Tullu Moye.

6.4.2 Tullu Moye
The only dataset currently available from the RiftVolc project is the Tullu Moye dataset of
Greenfield et al. (2019b). As demonstrated by the analysis on the EAGLE catalogue and for
the Ridgecrest earthquakes, we can see that ALPS works equally as well on short time period
catalogues and seismicity from temporary deployments. Here, we show that ALPS also works
well for identifying clusters in a small spatial area and can be used to find cluster families even
for seismicity covering one volcano.
For catalogues such as the Tullu Moye earthquake catalogue, where the spatial area is con-
strained to the volcano, one of the most useful part of ALPS will be the identification of the
cluster families. Generally, clustering algorithms are run over datasets covering large spatial
areas and are designed thus. This is due to primarily clustering methods being developed for
the declustered background catalogue. For volcanoes, the declustered catalogue is not neces-
sary, we are more interested in the clusters. ALPS ability to scale with the catalogue enables
us to provide a new look at the Tullu Moye earthquake catalogue. The cluster families iden-
tified by ALPS are shown in Figure 6.39 where a number of clusters are found and coloured
accordingly.

independent events. Time period is from 06/04/2016 - 01/10/2017.
As mentioned for the EAGLE catalogue, the small size of the clusters leads to ambiguity
in discerning between the swarm and mainshock-aftershock sequences using the diagnostic
plots. Here I analyse one cluster family from the catalogue, cluster family 5 as an example.
Despite consisting of only 196 events, the cluster family is clearly a swarm sequence for the
following reasons. There is no Omori law power law decay in aftershocks (Figure 6.40a), the
swarm starts and stops suddenly and there is no obvious mainshock (Figure 6.33a). Finally
the cluster network (Figure 6.41a) and equivalent matrix plot (Figure 6.41b) show a swarm-like
burst. Around volcanoes it is most likely the sequences are swarms and related to volcanic
processes, but Tullu Moye is also close to a number of faults so it is useful to confirm the
sequences are indeed related to the volcano. This attribution is consistent with the findings of
Greenfield et al. (2019b), who although identified different cluster families using k-means, still
attributed them to hot fluid circulation driven by magmatic processes.

catalogue of Greenfield et al. (2019b) and (b) the magnitude through time.
The three metrics used to classify the sequences are useful for confirming the cluster fam-
ilies are swarms at Tullu Moye, and in this case have removed any previous ambiguity in se-
quences which are similarly located in locations with both volcanic and tectonic processes (e.g.

6.5 Conclusions
In this chapter I analysed a number of datasets, from a variety of tectonic, volcanic and hybrid
settings. The catalogues are of varying sizes, in terms of number of events, time period cov-
ered and spatial area covered. The ALPS algorithm has successfully plotted lines through all of
the 2D IET-IER histograms, despite their differences, and have shown that all of the histograms
show a separation in background and clustered components. In analysing the Ridgecrest earth-
quake sequence ALPS proved it may be used to investigate a cluster family as it is developing.
We have confirmed the classifiers we identified in Chapter 5 and used them to characterise
cluster families where the origins of the seismicity is ambiguous. A new alternative represen-
tation of the parent-daughter links in the form of a matrix plot proved particularly useful as an
additional identifier when the force-directed Kamada-Kawai cluster network patterns are not
clear. In the next chapter we discuss the processes which have triggered the seismicity and
make new interpretations based on our results, in addition to confirming the findings of other
papers and authors.
Chapter 7
Discussion
In the previous chapter, I tested the ALPS method on a number of datasets from a variety of
tectonic settings. By using the characteristics of an example set of cluster families we were able
to discern if the cluster families were mainshock-aftershock sequences or swarms. The analysis
has provided new interpretations for some of the catalogues investigated, as well as supporting
conclusions reached by other authors. Where appropriate, in the previous chapter, I added
some discussion to provide clarity. However, here I expand on this to provide a more complete
analysis and critique. For the main part of this chapter, I discuss the triggering mechanisms in
more detail, comparing and contrasting between sequences from different localities. Towards
the end, I briefly test ALPS wider applicability beyond earthquake clustering by using ALPS to
cluster the iris dataset first mentioned in subsection 2.3.6. Finally, I conclude the chapter by
discussing the future work which can be done in regards to both the ALPS methodology and
investigating earthquake patterns in active continental rifts.
7.1 Southern California
I started with southern California, an area where many clustering algorithms were developed
(e.g. Gardner and Knopoff 1974, Reasenberg 1985, Frohlich and Davis 1990, Zaliapin et al.
2008). I investigated a number of large earthquakes which we knew were extensive mainshock-
aftershock sequences; the 1992 Landers (subsection 6.1.1), the 1999 Hector Mine (subsection
6.1.2) and the 2010 Baja (subsection 6.1.3) earthquakes. This allowed me to verify the met-
rics used to identify mainshock-aftershock sequences and contribute new information towards
our understanding of these earthquakes. In addition, I also investigated the Ridgecrest earth-
quakes which occurred on the 4th and 5th July 2019 (subsection 6.1.4). At the time of anal-
ysis and writing, the aftershock sequence is still ongoing. This provided me with the oppor-
tunity to do preliminary analysis on a cluster family that was still being formed and to see
how this affected the ALPS algorithms clustering, and the metrics used to distinguish between
mainshock-aftershock and swarm sequences.
As well as investigating known mainshock-aftershock sequences, I also ran ALPS over the
time period 01/01/2000 to 01/01/2010, during which there were no >M7.0 earthquakes. A
number of cluster families were found near geothermal areas; Coso, the Salton Sea and Cerro
Prieto volcano, Mexico (subsection 6.1.5). In these localities, the intersection of the faulting as-
sociated with the conservative plate boundary, and the high heat and fluid flux associated with
the geothermal area, is similar to the magmatic segments in the MER. A mixture of swarms
and mainshock-aftershock sequences are likely to occur here and therefore it is an ideal place
to test the classifying metrics, and allows us to add new insights into the seismicity occurring
in these areas.
The Landers, Hector Mine and Baja earthquakes have already been well analysed (e.g.
Hauksson et al. 1993, Hill et al. 1993, Anderson et al. 1994, Parsons and Dreger 2000, Hauksson
et al. 2002, Hauksson et al. 2011, Castro et al. 2011 etc.), but through our reanalysis using ALPS,
we are able to contribute some new findings.
For all sequences, the aftershocks extended further spatially than previously estimated,
which I mentioned briefly in the previous chapter for the Baja sequences. For the Landers
sequence, Hauksson et al. (1993) suggested the earthquakes extended as far north as 35.5 de-
grees and as far west as 117.3 degrees, whereas ALPS includes a group of earthquakes at 37
degrees north and earthquakes on the west coast of California (Figure 6.6). The Hector Mine
earthquake sequence covers a much smaller area than the Landers earthquake and broadly the
spread of the aftershocks agrees with Hauksson et al. (2002) (Figure 6.9). The only difference
was the southern extent of the sequence, with the cluster family identified by ALPS continued
to the south of the Salton Sea whereas the sequence of Hauksson et al. (2002) ended approx-
imately 50km north of the Salton Sea. The large spatial extent covered by the cluster families
is likely due to the high inter-connectivity of the fault system, which allows for the transfer of
static stress onto neighbouring faults. It is not clear how the authors have defined the extent
of their aftershock sequences, but it is clear from the clusters defined by ALPS that the effect
of static triggering and the transfer of stress extends further than previously thought.
However, a few authors have proposed that the stress triggering from the Landers earth-
quake led to the Hector Mine earthquake, seven years later (Parsons and Dreger, 2000; Felzer
et al., 2002; Pollitz, 2005). In Felzer et al. (2002), they suggest the aftershocks of the Landers
earthquake led to the Hector Mine earthquake. To test this, I ran ALPS over the time period
1990 to 2002, covering both the Landers and Hector Mine earthquake sequences. It was found
that the two earthquake sequences were not joined into one cluster family (Figure 7.1) which
suggests that secondary aftershocks from the 1992 Landers earthquake were not the trigger
for the 1999 Hector Mine earthquake. It is still possible that the Coulomb failure stress from
Landers was positive on the Hector Mine fault, thus increasing the state of stress, but given
there are Coulomb failure stresses associated with every earthquake, by this logic we could
create large cluster families that extend for decades.
The last mainshock-aftershock sequence studied was the Ridgecrest sequence. By studying
this cluster family, we could see very clearly how the events were distributed near the begin-
ning of a large sequence. Figure 6.14 showed that the earthquakes appear to propagate both
ways from the mainshock, but northwards more recently. The earthquakes appear to stop at
a perpendicular fault to the south, and then continue on this fault, I postulate this is most
likely due to a static triggering and a transfer of stress from the original fault rupture to the
perpendicular fault.
In addition to the mainshock-aftershock sequences, I also investigated four swarm sequences
which were located in known geothermal areas. These areas also have extensive faulting and
there are many different hypotheses for the trigger mechanisms for swarms located in these
localities. We noted that swarms are typically due to volcanic activity, and include within this,
geothermal activity (Hill et al., 1993; Heinicke et al., 2009; Passarelli et al., 2018). However,
a couple of authors have attributed swarms, particularly those located to the south of the
Salton Sea, to aseismic creep on the transform faults (Roland and Mcguire, 2009), slow slip
(Zhang and Shearer, 2016) and local crustal spreading (Weaver and Hill, 1978).
At the Salton Sea, the earthquakes in the cluster family 301 occur at depths which range
Figure 7.1  The cluster families identified by the ALPS clustering algorithm for the time period 01/01/1990 to
01/01/2002 which included the 1992 Landers and 1999 Hector Mine earthquake sequences. Catalogue used is the
SCEC catalogue of Hauksson et al. (2012) which has a minimum magnitude of 2 which is equal to the completeness
magnitude.
from 5 to 8 km (Figure 8.10, Appendix), which coincides with the depths found for the nearby
San Jacinto fault in Zhang and Shearer (2016) and with the depth of the clusters identified by
Cheng and Chen (2018). At this depth, the earthquakes are occurring in hydrothermally altered
rocks which are extensively fractured. Below this strata, there are basaltic intrusions into sed-
imentary layers (Younker et al., 1982), likely to be the source of heat driving the geothermal
field. The cluster family is located in the geothermal field and near the Brawley fault which
has historically been the location of a number of swarms (Weaver and Hill, 1978; Roland and
Mcguire, 2009). This swarm was also identified by Lohman and McGuire (2007) who attributed
it to aseismic creep, also the triggering process for the slow-slip events by Roland and Mcguire
(2009). However Cheng and Chen (2018) postulates that the small spatial extent of the swarms
(<2km radius) they investigated suggests their earthquakes are more likely to be due to fluid
flow. Our cluster family has a radius of between 5 and 8km, and this combined with the depths
of high heat flow, which Lohman and McGuire (2007) suggests are too high for frictional in-
stability, may suggest shallow aseismic slip in the top 1-2km. However, Lohman and McGuire
(2007) mention that hydrothermal fluids can significantly reduce the temperature gradient.
We know that hydrothermal fluids are present and also that CO2 is associated with hydrother-
mal areas (Heinicke et al., 2009). It has been found that the presence of CO2 lowers the fric-
tional instability (Pluymakers et al., 2014), and therefore I suggest that we cannot discount the
movement of hydrothermal fluids as a trigger mechanism.
At Coso Volcanic Field we showed one cluster family, 54 (Figure 6.16c) which is located in
the geothermal area, coinciding with an area of enhanced fluid circulation (Fialko and Simons,
2000). The fluid flow on pre-existing fractures is attributed to be one of the causes of seismic-
ity (Feng and Lees, 1998). We can see in the location that the earthquakes fall between two
mapped faults, in an area defined by rhyolite domes, therefore the seismicity either occurs on
blind faults, or it is associated with the fractures in the geothermal system. This was noted
in Hill et al. (1993), and it was postulated that the earthquakes were associated with a slight
spreading, similar to the Salton Sea. Tomographic analysis of the geothermal region shows it
extends down to 5km (Lees, 2002), and the majority of the earthquakes in cluster family 54
occur between 2 and 5 km (Figure 7.2), therefore locating these earthquakes well within the
area of increased heat and fluid circulation. Lees (2002) speculate that beneath the field there
is a magmatic intrusion, similar to the intrusions we see in the strata beneath the hydrother-
mally altered rock in the Salton Sea. The similarities between the Salton Sea and Coso suggest
similar mechanisms for the swarms.
Cerro Prieto has not been as well studied as the Salton Sea or Coso, and most swarms
have been attributed to the NW-SE trending Cerro Prieto fault (Hogan et al., 2017; Glowacka
et al., 2015). However, one of our swarms occurs directly under the volcano (Figure 6.16a)
and another trends directly N-S (Figure 6.16b), which does not match the trend of the main
fault. It is, again similar to Coso and the Salton Sea, located in an area of extension, on a
continuation of the East Pacific Rise. It is characterised by higher heat flows and geothermal
fluids. The heat is thought to be related to intrusions at depth, related to the thinning of the
crust (Gutirrez-Negrin, 2015). There is active fumarole activity at the surface of the western
side of the volcano (Macas Vzquez and Rocha Lpez, 2013) and the main hydrothermal area
Figure 7.2  The depth of the earthquakes in cluster family 54 (Coso Geothermal Field) through time.
ends at around 3km depth. The gabbroic intrusions are too high density to rise through the
sediments, remaining instead at depth (Reed, 1978). In contrast to the Salton Sea and Coso
cluster families, the majority of these earthquakes are located 10 and 12 km depth (Figures 8.11
and 7.3, Appendix). Initially, in the first couple of days of cluster family 410, the earthquakes
range between 1 km and 25 km, but as the cluster families progresses, only a few outliers
remain outside of the 10-12km depth range (Figure 7.3). The N-S trend of the earthquakes,
coupled with the constrained depths, suggests that this may be a dyke emplacement at depth
related to the extension. The direction of regional maximum compressive stress is N-S (Ziga
et al., 1995), therefore the dyke is opening perpendicular to 3. The upward movement of
the hypocentres, and our knowledge of the tectonic setting, suggest that most likely we are
seeing dyke propagation, following the model of Ukawa and Tsukahara (1996) (Figure 2.8).
The largest magnitude earthquakes of M5.17 and M4.7 occurred at depths of 19 and 17km,
respectively with the largest occurring at the beginning of the sequence and the magnitude
4.7 occurring an hour later. These large earthquakes could be related to the initial fracturing
of the basement rock as the dyke began intruding.
The second cluster family (135) identified by ALPS occurred in January 2002. The earth-
quakes in this sequence do not trend in a particular direction, instead are all clustered di-
rectly under the volcano (Figure 6.16a). However, the majority of the earthquakes also occur
at depths between 5 and 18km. The cluster family is short in duration and the majority of the
sequence occurs on the same day. However, this could indicate a triggering process slightly

quakes have been scaled by magnitude.
different to that of the previous cluster family; the wide variety of depths, with larger magni-
tudes occurring deeper, and the random distribution of the hypocentres suggest dyke inflation
caused by injection from below, following the model of Roman and Cashman (2006) (Figure
2.8) rather than dyke propagation. The decrease in magnitude of earthquakes occurring in
the top five to ten kilometres could be caused by previous fractures and magma pathways
reopening with the increase in pressure from the intrusion below, or by an increase in heat
flow leading to increased movement of hydrothermal fluids (similar to phenomena observed
in both the Salton Sea and Coso Volcanic Field (Hill et al., 1993; Feng and Lees, 1998)).
Coso, Salton Sea and Cerro Prieto are all associated with geothermal fields and are areas
of localised tectonic extension. Hill et al. (1993) suggests the swarms in the Salton Sea and
Coso occur on the faults which accommodate the extension and the swarms can be linked to
magma injection at depth (Bacon, 1981; Younker et al., 1982). I postulate that it is the interac-
tion between the faults related to the spreading and the fracturing related to the geothermal
system that leads to the swarm sequences being triggered along these faults. It is likely that
we can extend this hypothesis to Cerro Prieto, which is located on part of the East Pacific Rise.
In Cerro Prieto, we can infer two potential intrusions which are related to the extension and
likely lead to the high heat flow of the Cerro Prieto geothermal area. In Coso and the Salton
Sea however, although the swarms may be linked to magma injection at depth, it is likely the
fluids circulating are the direct trigger (Cheng and Chen, 2018). Increased heat flow at depth,
potentially due to an intrusion, and thus an increased in circulation in the fluids lower the pore
fluid pressure (Equation 2.3, Chapter 2) and therefore a smaller stress increase is needed to
fracture the rock.
7.2 New Zealand
The volcanic region of North Island, New Zealand was chosen as an area for study due to its
similarity to the Main Ethiopian Rift, in the sense that the volcanoes are in an area of localised
regional extension. Although, in other senses they are not - the volcanoes are in a back-arc
basin, whereas those in the MER are in an area of active continental break-up.
Earthquake swarms are well known for occurring near Lake Taupo (Webb et al., 1986; Sher-
burn, 1992; Hochstein, 1995), therefore we used these cluster families as type examples for
identifying the metrics which define the swarms and separate them from the mainshock-
aftershock sequences.
In the previous chapter, we noted that the cluster families which are located almost on top
of each other were close to a large fumarole, Hipaua (Figure 6.22). Thermal spring samples col-
lected at Hipaua have been found to have significant magmatic fluid traces (Soto et al., 2019)
and this area also coincides with an area of low electrical resistivity, indicating the presence
of conductive hydrothermal fluids in a set of well-connected fractures (Wilson, 1996). See-
beck et al. (2014) inferred that some swarms in this area are tectonic in origin, but we found
the cluster families did not lie on known active faults and there is no clear trend, for example
following a fault plane, to the cluster families near Hipaua (Figure 6.21). Instead, the hypocen-
tres are randomly distributed at between 1 and 5km depth which is well within the volcanic
rocks (which extend to 15km depth) (Hochstein, 1995). Hochstein (1995) have suggested that
magma injection into the base of the volcanics has led to swarms in the past, but the earth-
quakes in our cluster families are far too shallow. However, magma injection at depth could
lead to increased heat flow and circulation in the hydrothermal system, similar to the swarms
in southern California. This, in turn, results in increased fracturing in the highly interconnected
system.
Further to the cluster families at the south-western edge, we have cluster family 154 which
trends E-W approximately 5km north of the other cluster families (Figure 6.21). It was also
identified as a swarm as opposed to a mainshock-aftershock sequence as the aftershock decay
rate does not follow Omoris law and there was no obvious mainshock (Figure 6.23a). Addi-
tionally the force-directed Kamada Kawai cluster network had characteristics that allowed it
to be identified as a burst (Figure 6.24c). The earthquakes in this cluster do follow a trend E-W,
but it is not located near any known faults. It is, however, close to a number of volcanic vents
and on the caldera wall. Therefore there will be a number of pre-existing pathways which will
link to these vents, and potentially unmapped faults relating to caldera collapse. It is possible
that we are seeing a reopening of a fracture network, potentially due to a magma emplace-
ment at depth, or relating to the circulation of hydrothermal fluids. In subsection 2.2.2, we
mentioned how the precipitation of minerals relating to the circulation of the hydrothermal
fluids can lead to the pressurising of a system, followed by fracturing when the system be-
comes over-pressurised. However, there is some discussion as to whether earthquakes are
potentially too deep for this to occur as they are located between 5 and 12 km depth. Lohman
and McGuire (2007) suggests the heat flow is too high for frictional instability, whereas Sibson
et al. (1988) has documented hydrothermal system and fault valve action causing deposits of
gold and other minerals at meso-thermal depths, albeit under compressional tectonics. I sur-
mise that magma movement at depth led to the reopening of an old pathway or movement on
an old fault, with the rapid start and stopping of the sequence reflecting an injection at depth
which led to a brief pressurisation that was then released by fracturing.
In addition to the swarms around Lake Taupo, we also investigated the Te Araroa earthquake
and its accompanying aftershock sequence in a subduction zone. This allows for comparisons
between mainshock-aftershock sequences in the extensional and transform settings discussed
so far, and mainshock-aftershock sequences occurring at greater depths and offshore in a con-
vergent setting.
The Te Araroa earthquake was located at 22km depth, far deeper than any of the main-
shocks located on the San Andreas Fault System, or any others discussed up to this point.
Warren-Smith et al. (2018) noted it was a slow-slip earthquake. To further support Warren-
Smith et al. (2018), Figure 6.26 shows the depth at which Wallace et al. (2009) hypothesised
slow-slip events occur on the downgoing slab, which coincides with the depth at which the Te
Araroa mainshock occurred. There is a clear gap in the earthquake locations between those
occurring on the East Cape peninsula and the group around the mainshock. This gap coincides
with the area of aseismic creep (Figure 6.26 and Wallace et al. (2009)).
The mainshock magnitude for this sequence is comparable to those of the magnitudes of
the mainshocks previously studied from the San Andreas faults. However, there are far fewer
aftershocks and there is a significant lack of foreshocks. The lack of foreshocks prior to the
slow-slip event could be attributed to any previous stress buildup being released through aseis-
mic creep (Figure 6.26) (Warren-Smith et al., 2018). The lower number of aftershocks is consis-
tent with the lack of interconnectivity in the fault system, with far less static transfer of stress
between faults. This is contrasted with southern California where we often see stress trans-
ferred to a close and/or connected neighbouring fault and the aftershock sequence continuing
(e.g. the Landers and Baja earthquake sequences, Figures 6.6 and 6.11, respectively).
Although there is a decrease in static triggering, there is additionally some clear dynamic
triggering. Near White Island volcano there is a small group of earthquakes within the cluster
family of the Te Araroa earthquake. Two weeks after the M7.1 earthquake, White Island volcano
had renewed ash explosions after a period of quiescence which occurred after the April 2016
phreatic explosions (Global Volcanism Program, 2017). Sturtevant et al. (1996), Freed (2005a)
and Brodsky and Prejean (2005) all suggest the ephemeral seismic waves can promote bubble
growth and temporarily unblock fractures within volcanic systems (subsection 2.2.1). There-
fore, the White Island September eruptions may be linked to the M7.1 Te Araroa earthquake,
and the earthquakes triggered on the known faults near the volcano also contributed to the
unblocking of pathways and depressurisation of the system. From this finding, it is important
to consider that, in the MER, the Ankober and North Arboye border fault systems are also ca-
pable of producing large magnitude earthquakes (Dziewonski et al., 1981; Ekstrm et al., 2012)
and this could lead to activity at the volcanoes.
7.3 Iceland
The cluster families investigated in Iceland were located in two areas; the Tjrnes Fracture
Zone (TFZ) and Reykjanes Ridge. Both are on the offshore-onshore boundary of the Mid-
Atlantic Ridge, however the TFZ is on a transform boundary, with two large strike-slip faults,
whereas the Reykjanes Ridge is a more typical extensional setting with a series of volcanoes
and geothermal areas running along the rift.
In both Chapter 5 and subsection 6.3, we extensively analysed these clusters and added
some discussion. In the TFZ, we selected two cluster families from a number identified and
found that despite being reported as swarms, they were related to movement on the Grmsey
Lineament and were mainshock-aftershock sequences. Here, we add a few more clarifying
points.
Here I compare these results to other authors work. For example, Passarelli et al. (2018) in-
vestigated tectonic earthquake swarms in the TFZ and looked at swarms on the Husavk-Flatley
Fault, identifying their swarms using the  statistics of Reasenberg and Matthews (1988);
Matthews and Reasenberg (1988). The  statistic is a measure of the significance of a seismic-
ity rate change, which is the difference between the expected seismicity based on the number
of events in a previous time window and the observed seismicity in the subsequent time win-
dow, all rescaled by the standard deviation. First they declustered the catalogue using the
method of Reasenberg (1985) (subsection 2.3.2) thus removing any mainshock-aftershock se-
quences. Then they used non-overlapping time windows of 30 days and defined the clusters
by determining seismicity that exceeded the average background rate by more than ten stan-
dard deviations. They confirmed they were swarms using two of the characteristics used here;
the lack of Omori law decay in the aftershocks and the lack of an obvious mainshock. In Figures
3.14, 3.15, subsection 3.3.2 and Chapter 4, I showed the accuracy of the ALPS clustering method
when compared to Reasenberg (1985), and that my method is considerably more accurate at
identifying clusters in a synthetic volcano-tectonic catalogue. Therefore, the cluster families
of Passarelli et al. (2018) may not be representative. Whilst I disagree on the definition of the
cluster families (swarms versus mainshock-aftershock), I agree that the triggering mechanism
is tectonic, and similarly find the cluster families occur along known faults. The cluster families
each rupture a small section of the fault, with little overlap between two adjacent clusters.
Small perpendicular faults on the Grmsey Lineament accommodate some of the extension,
and the earthquakes in the February 2018 cluster family investigated in the previous chapter
end with a small NE-SW trend, perpendicular to the main fault direction (Figure 6.27). This sug-
gests there is a transfer of stress onto this fault, similar to the Ridgecrest earthquake (Figure
6.14), which ends the propagation of the aftershocks along the direction of the main fault.
In contrast, the Reykjanes Ridge seismicity consists primarily of swarms. In subsection 6.3.2,
I investigated two cluster families, one on the end of the peninsula and one located in the
geothermal field Brennisteinfjll. The Reykjanes Peninsula is one of the type examples used by
Hill (1977) (Chapter 2), and one of our cluster families, 20, is in the same location as the swarms
identified by Hill. Therefore, we can infer similar triggering processes either directly relating to
the dyke emplacement or triggering within the hydrothermal system, driven by the heat from
these dykes (Figure 7.4 shows the inferred location of the dykes). However, the presence of
a large earthquake, similar to the magnitudes suggested in Hill (1977), preferentially supports
the dyke emplacement at depth which is underpinned by the depths of the earthquakes in the
cluster family (Figure 7.5).
Figure 7.4  The location of cluster family 20 identified by ALPS (Figure 6.32) is the same as the locality used in
figure 3 from Hill (1977) which is shown here. The least principal stress axis 3 is shown here as well as the inferredlocation of dykes and the known faults and seismicity observed by Klein et al. (1977).

The locations of the cluster families identified in this thesis agree with those of the cluster
families found in Keiding et al. (2009) and Bjrnsson et al. (2018), coinciding with the locations
of the geothermal areas, and their classification of the cluster families as swarms. However,
there are opposing views as to the triggering mechanism. For example Keiding et al. (2009)
suggests the earthquakes are triggered by tectonic loading with some geothermal triggering
in the Krsuvk area, in contrast to Hill (1977) who attribute the swarms to dyke inflation and
intrusion. I suggest tectonic loading may be the cause for the mainshock-aftershock sequences
also identified by Keiding et al. (2009), but I postulate the geothermal triggering is the primary
cause of the swarm located at Brennisteinfjll. This is due to its similarity to other swarms
investigated in this thesis; the lack of a trend in the seismicity locations, its proximity to a
geothermal area and the long inter-event times.
This discussion highlights the importance of characterising cluster families in order to de-
termine the triggering method. This has been demonstrated through all of the case studies
investigated so far. I now apply these findings to the cluster families identified in the Main
Ethiopian Rift.
7.4 Main Ethiopian Rift
In the previous chapter we examined a number of cluster families from the MER, and showed
how the ALPS clustering algorithm could provide detail on a smaller spatial scale for the seis-
micity located on one volcano, in this case, Tullu Moye. Here, I add further interpretations to
the cluster families and show that they agree with previous authors work on the seismicity in
the MER.
The largest cluster family occurred on the Ankober Border Fault System, and was found to
be a mainshock-aftershock sequence. However, the cluster families located in the magmatic
segments are more ambiguous. A few were identified as swarms, though the small size of the
cluster families did make it difficult to confidently characterise them (subsection 6.4.1).
The swarms were mainly located around Fentale and Dofan, both volcanoes with active hy-
drothermal systems but with a number of nearby faults too. Similar to the earthquake swarms
in southern California, Wilks et al. (2017) suggest magma intrusion at depth leads to the cluster
families in the geothermal systems of the MER.
For the cluster families near Aluto volcano, it is likely these are swarms (Figure 3.16). Aluto
has been extensively studied and is one of the most well researched volcanoes in the rift, there-
fore it is possible to more accurately suggest triggering mechanisms for these earthquakes.
Hutchison et al. (2016) document a high CO2 flux, indicating significant inter-connectivity be-
tween the magmatic and hydrothermal systems. Additionally, Heinicke et al. (2009) noted
that increased CO2 leads to increased dissolution on the fault planes and a weakening, which
increases the likelihood of earthquake swarms. Using Interferometric Synthetic Radar (InSAR),
Hutchison et al. (2016) found evidence of inflation relating to magma intrusion and deflation
relating to degassing. This degassing thus leads to the depressurisation of the hydrothermal
field. We are likely to see swarms in both phases. During the inflation phase, there will be
brittle failure in the pressurised hydrothermal field and during magma emplacement, dur-
ing deflation, the increased gas flux could lead to a choking in the system which can trigger
earthquakes (Petersen, 2007). The migration of hot fluids relating to deep magmatic injec-
tions along pre-existing fault planes and fractures has been postulated for other earthquake
swarms in this thesis, for example near Taupo and Cerro Prieto, and this may suggest these
also have a coupled magmatic-hydrothermal system.
The final two volcanoes in the MER which have also been studied in greater detail are
Corbetti and Tullu Moye (subsection 6.4.2 and Fontijn et al. (2018); Greenfield et al. (2019a);
Lavayssire et al. (2019)). We showed some results from clustering the Tullu Moye seismicity
in the previous chapter. ALPS identified more cluster families than Greenfield et al. (2019b) did
using k-means. Due to the high number, we suggest that the cluster families ALPS is finding are
related to individual processes. For example, Greenfield et al. (2019b) attributes their cluster
families to hydrothermal processes and we postulate that we are seeing related earthquakes
which are linked to the same small-scale fracturing within the system. Thus ALPS is separat-
ing the cluster families found in Greenfield et al. (2019b) into smaller families. Generally, the
location of ALPS cluster families agree with those identified by Greenfield et al. (2019b) and I
agree that they are swarms relating to hydrothermal processes. Lavayssire et al. (2019) inves-
tigated the seismicity at Corbetti further, with a temporary deployment from February 2016 to
October 2017. Their results find similar triggering processes happening at Aluto and in many of
the other swarms discussed in the previous chapter. The earthquake locations are consistent
with the movement of hydrothermal fluids, with the majority located in the upper 5km and a
northwards migration which follows known pre-existing fractures (Lavayssire et al., 2019).
Furthermore, Mazzarini et al. (2013) found independent evidence for the inter-connectivity
of the geothermal and plumbing systems in the form of close spatial links between the volcanic
vents and the areas of dense seismicity in the area they investigated (including Fentale and
Dofan). Therefore, these preliminary findings of Mazzarini et al. (2013) suggest we can extend
the hypothesis that the earthquakes at Aluto, Corbetti and Tullu Moye are triggered by the
circulation of fluids in the hydrothermal system driven by an underlying magmatic heat source,
to the other volcanoes within the MER, and thus these are also likely triggers for the swarms
identified by ALPS.
7.5 Applications beyond earthquake clustering
The iris dataset is often used to test the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms (subsec-
tion 2.3.6). It is a multi-variate dataset which has been used to test both supervised and unsu-
pervised regression and clustering algorithms for a variety of classification problems involving
parameter vectors. The iris dataset contains three different species of iris; Setosa, Virginica
and Versicolor. When plotting various characteristics of the irises (petal length, petal width,
sepal length, sepal width), Setosa is distinct from both Virginica and Versicolor, but there is
significant overlap between the Virginica and Versicolor species (Figure 7.6 and Figure 7.7).
The ALPS clustering algorithm simply draws a line between two modes and divides clusters
based on this. Provided there are two variables which lead to different families being separate
in space, we can use ALPS to divide the two. These families may be background versus linked
earthquakes or they may be, for example, good versus bad film reviews, or different species
separated on different characteristics. The advantage of ALPS is that it is not necessary to know
a priori what the two classes are.
In terms of the iris dataset, ALPS, in theory, should be good at separating Setosa from Vir-
ginica and Setosa from Versicolor, but it will not be able to separate all three at once, nor will
it be able to separate Virginica from Versicolor due to the high levels of overlap.
Figure 7.6 shows cross-plots of the parameter vectors for the Setosa species, plotted against
those of both Virginica and Versicolor. Density contours are drawn by the same Gaussian Kernel
Density Estimation used by ALPS. In many of these plots, there is a distinct division between the
Figure 7.6  The features of the three iris species plotted against one another. The dataset is divided into two; a

width against sepal width have intentionally been left blank.
two species and ALPS should be able to plot the line to separate them. For example, Figure
7.7 shows the ALPS dividing line for petal length versus petal width for all three iris species.
Versicolor and Virginica lie above the line and Setosa lies below the line, which highlights the
issue when using all three at once and the overlap betwen Versicolor and Virginica. In Figure
7.7a, the plot is drawn in the same style as the ALPS dividing lines plots for the earthquake
clustering algorithms (e.g. Figure 3.4), with the rainbow colours representing the density of
points. This demonstrates the similarities between the 2D map of the inter-event times and
distances for the earthquakes, and the parameter vector features for the iris dataset. Despite
the overlap between the Versicolor and Virginica species (Figure 7.7b), we can use the ALPS
line, and separate Setosa from the other two species. We show the results of this clustering
in Figure 7.8 and the accuracy of the ALPS algorithm can be seen for defining the three iris

species, when compared to Figure 7.6.
An advantage of using ALPS is the lack of a need for a labelled training dataset, making this
an unsupervised learning algorithm. However, we can see it struggles to plot a dividing line
when there is overlap between the characteristics, it cannot separate Virginica from Versicolor
based on these parameter vector features, therefore ALPS is restricted to clustering datasets
where a clear dividing line exists between the two species. Additionally, ALPS can only be used
to separate two at a time, though you can run it through iteratively to separate more families,
provided they are distinct from one another.
This shows ALPS may have wide applicability beyond solely earthquake clustering. Its main
advantages are that it does not need a labelled training dataset to separate clusters, and it
is simple to implement whilst being computationally relatively cheap. However, one partic-
ular disadvantage is that it can only do binary classification, and if the two clusters are not
sufficiently distinct, ALPS will fail to plot the dividing line.

length, petal width against petal width, sepal length against sepal length and sepal width against sepal width have

7.6 Future work
I have demonstrated throughout this thesis the success of the ALPS algorithm in clustering
earthquakes and the subsequent classification of the clusters into swarms and mainshock-
aftershock sequences. I have added new insights to many of the localities investigated, as
well as confirming previous authors work using an alternative clustering technique. We have
shown that ALPS has applications beyond earthquake clustering, for specific problems which
involve a discriminate, binary classification. In the future, more work could be done in further
improving the clustering algorithm itself, and the classification of the cluster families.
The contours ALPS uses to separate the two modes cannot always be connected using a
straight line (subsection 3.2.5). For such datasets, we extended the approach into using three
lines (Listing 1). In principle, this may be improved using an automated curved line, which was
briefly investigated in subsection 3.2.5. Extending this work would also be worth exploring
in future work. Additionally, ALPS does require some human input should the line not plot
correctly, for example, changing the number of contours. Ideally, ALPS would be entirely auto-
mated, so the method of plotting the line has room for further improvement. Using machine
learning may be one approach, for example through training and tuning the algorithm using
many datasets and the lines plotted through these.
The exact position of the ALPS line, is sensitive to the contouring which, in turn, is depen-
dent on the size of the dataset. One potential improvement would be to introduce a probabilis-
tic approach. By using many synthetic catalogues and a Monte Carlo approach, we could quan-
tify a percentage accuracy relating to distance from the initial ALPS line, and characterise the
cluster families probabilistically. This would enable us to incorporate the error within the line
plotting, within the clusters, and extend the results of Bayliss et al. (2019) to a two-dimensional
analysis.
Finally, there is still research to be done to quantify cluster families into mainshock-aftershock
and swarm sequences. Zaliapin and Ben-Zion (2016c), Cheng and Chen (2018) and Bayliss
(2018b) are just a few examples of different approaches, and they are often reliant on the
choice of clustering algorithm used. Our classifications, although based on empirical laws
which govern earthquake statistics, are not as quantitative as they could be, with the inter-
pretation of the force-directed Kamada-Kawai cluster network being significantly more quali-
tative, and also dependent on the structure of the cluster family, which in turn is dependent
on the clustering method used. While some progress has been made with this thesis, there is
still a need for a comprehensive, universal, quantitative, automated classifier which can con-
fidently separate mainshock-aftershock sequences from swarms, and ideally, tectonic earth-
quake swarms from volcanic/geothermal earthquake swarms.
Chapter 8
Conclusions
The Automated Line Plotting Saddlepoint (ALPS) method has many advantages over current
clustering algorithms - it is reproducible, simple to implement, makes no a priori assumptions,
and reduces human bias. The ALPS technique further has the unique advantage of successfully
separating both swarms and mainshock-aftershock sequences from the background seismic-
ity. When tested on both synthetic tectonic and volcano-tectonic catalogues, it achieves this
with an accuracy of over 90%, a percentage accuracy that is higher than any of the popular
methodologies tested.
In addition, ALPS finds cluster families and independent events at a higher precision than
the methods that included magnitude scaling. This enabled earthquakes which were previ-
ously masked within high background seismicity or other cluster families, to be correctly as-
signed to their cluster family.
Three additional cluster metrics proved useful in discriminating between the two types
of cluster. The cumulative event rate, magnitude evolution and the force-directed Kamada-
Kawai network were objectively different for swarms and mainshock-aftershock sequences,
and reflected inherent properties of the two. For example, the aftershock event rate decays
in a power-law form in only the mainshock-aftershock sequences, a phenomenon which is
observed in both the cumulative event rate and magnitude evolution. A new finding from this
thesis was the use of a network graph to display the parent-daughter links, with the network
shape reflecting the distinct characteristics for swarms and mainshock-aftershock sequences.
The force-directed Kamada-Kawai plots were a distinctive flower-burst for the swarms and
had branching, dendritic tails for the mainshock-aftershock sequences.
These new methodologies proved useful in identifying clusters families and their nature in a
variety of settings: southern California, Iceland, New Zealand and the MER, separating swarms,
mainshock-aftershock sequences and the background seismicity, and provided new insights
such as the relative importance of static and dynamic triggering for many of the mainshock-
aftershock sequences, and to evaluate the state of unrest at volcanoes in the MER. The vol-
canoes associated with active hydrothermal systems were the main trigger mechanism for
the majority of the swarms investigated, potentially reflecting magma intrusions at depth.
This provided independent corroboration for a similar finding from previous work and cog-
nate studies within the RiftVolc project.
The ALPS method may be used beyond earthquake clustering. The algorithm separates any
two populations from one another, provided they are distinct in 2D space. In particular, the
iris flower dataset utilised in machine learning is a classic example of separation of species
in ecology. ALPS correctly separated the iris species Setosa from Virginica, and Setosa from
Versicolor. While ALPS solved the speciation problem for unlabelled training datasets, its main
disadvantage is that it only can separate two distinct populations at a time. ALPS has the
potential to separate more populations from one another, but only if they are relatively distinct
from each other in a 2D space. Hence ALPS shows promise and a use beyond earthquake
clustering.
In summary, the new and novel clustering algorithm of ALPS, has significantly improved
the identification of cluster families in earthquake catalogues from volcano-tectonic settings.
When combined with the three characteristics for distinguishing swarms from mainshock-
aftershock sequences, it is a powerful, thoroughly tested tool for future earthquake cluster
analysis, and for other problems that rely on separation of populations on a 2D map.

Appendix
8.1 Alternative Characterisitics
The degree centrality and degree count of the network are simple. Degree centrality is the
number of neighbours a node has and is calculated as a fraction of the number of nodes it
could potentially be connected to. Degree count is a count of each node and its degree, where
degree is the number of nodes it is directly connected to.
The average neighbour degree of a node can be calculated using Equation 8.1, where i is the
node, N(i) are the neighbours of the node, which are the nodes that are directly connected,
and k j is the degree of the node j which is within N(i). In this case the node i is the parent
event and the neighbouring nodes are the linked daughters.
knn,i =
|N(i)| 
jN(i)
k j (8.1)
The closeness centrality measures how close a node is to all other nodes and is calculated
according to Equation 8.2, where d( j, i) is the distance between the node (parent) and any
node which is connected to it, including beyond primary connections (e.g. granddaughters,
great-granddaughters etc.).
C(i) =
 j d( j, i)
