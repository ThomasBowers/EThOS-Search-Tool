ABSTRACT 
The question How does Revelation interact with the Roman Empire? 
weaves its way through the past 125 years of scholarly research on the Apocalypse.  
Yet, flawed methodologies, false assumptions, and limited trajectories have led to 
poor conclusions that posture Revelation as nothing more than a vitriolic attack on 
the Roman Empire that intends to incite, reveal, and/or remind Christians of imperial 
evil.  This thesis challenges this academic narrative of the Apocalypse through the 
development and implementation of the Alter-Imperial paradigm. 
Repositioning the theoretical background of the imperial inquiry around 
Empire Studies, the Alter-Imperial paradigm applies insights from Postcolonial 
criticism and examinations of dominance to engage the complexities of the 
relationship between the sovereign(s) and subject(s) of a societya dynamic far 
more intricate than either rebellion or acquiescence.  From this disposition, various 
forms of Roman propaganda (from Augustus to Domitian) are explored to surface 
the Sovereign Narrative saturating the public transcript and immersing the subjects in 
key messages of absolute dominance, divine favor, and imperial benevolence.  The 
date of Revelations composition, then, is established to isolate the socio-historical 
analysis to the Flavian dynasty, paying particular attention to the viewpoint of the 
oppressed and the question of persecution.  The Flavian dynastys essential 
development of an anti-Jewish environment (intensified in Domitians reign) offers 
not only a contentious context for Christian communitiesstill viewed as 
indistinguishable from Jewish communities by Roman elitebut also indelible 
images of imperial propaganda through which subject texts, like Revelation, can 
interact with the empire. 
 From this vantage point, the Alter-Imperial paradigm offers fresh 
interpretative possibilities for familiar (and even forgotten) texts, such as Revelation 
20:7-10.  This enigmatic passage depicts the release of Satan from a 1,000 year 
imprisonment at a climactic moment in the Apocalypse, and yet, this text is widely 
neglected in Revelation scholarship.  Parallels to Roman triumphal processions (a 
central element in Flavian propaganda), however, demonstrate that Revelation 20:7-
10 depicts Satan as the bound enemy leader marching in Gods triumphal procession. 
 Nevertheless, the Alter-Imperial paradigm does not stagnate at intriguing 
textual parallels.  Indeed, this interpretation of Revelation 20:7-10 postures the 
interpreter to poignantly address the question: How does Revelation interact [not 
merely subvert] the empire?  Specifically, the use of Roman imagery in the subject 
text does not necessitate an anti-imperial intent, but may simply be the grammar 
with which the subject text constructs their Alter-Empire.  In fact, the Alter-Imperial 
paradigm suggests that to reduce Revelation to an anti-Roman document intent on 
the empires destruction is to over-exaggerate Romes significance in the subject text 
and, then, to miss its true targetthe construction of the Alter-Empire through the 
destruction of the true enemy, Satan.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
 Some tasks appear insurmountable the moment they approach.  With the love 
and support of so many people, this doctoral process was not one of them, but 
pausing to adequately express gratitude to everyone involved in this accomplishment 
does strike me as potentially insuperable.  Yet, I could not, in good conscience, allow 
the reader to move into the content of this work without acknowledging that this 
venture was anything but individual; like many valuable things in life, this project 
reflects community. 
 First, I would like to thank the administration at Ozark Christian College for 
being so patient with me throughout this journey.  The countless ways in which you 
encouraged and fostered this process from its inception to its completion could 
surpass the page count of this volume alone.  In particular, Matt Proctor and Doug 
Aldridge, you have gone above and beyond in your humble support for my family 
and me.  For that, I am truly grateful and blissfully indebted. 
 Thanks also to Meri Rogers and the English Department at Ozark Christian 
College for the countless pages of editing and revisions, without which this text 
would read like a lumpy mattress.  Two individuals deserve special recognition for 
their tireless endurance and unrequited benevolence: John Hunter and Jessica 
Scheuermann.  Your expertise and professionalism have often left me speechless.  So 
I will say no more than simply: thank you. 
 As a verbal processor, many of my close friends have suffered through 
countless hours of underdeveloped ideas and observations.  Michael DeFazio, Mike 
Ackerman, and Doug Welch, thank you for taking time out of your crowded lives to 
spend more than just a few hours poring over the words that follow with insightful 
questions that reflect your robust acumen.  I am honored to call you all colleagues.  
Josh Huckabay, Josh Quade, and Nathan Horton, please forgive my, at times, aimless 
musings on topics that you charitably tolerated.  Your friendship is one of the great 
joys of my life. 
 The path of academia begins with challenges and direction proffered by 
instructors and mentors.  In the case of Mark E. Moore and Robert A. Lowery, I had 
the benefit of both.  You saw in me potential and possibilities that proved elusive in 
my own reflection.  You demonstrated the meaning of academicians as churchmen.  I 
miss you both.  I hope this makes you proud. 
 I would be remiss if I did not profoundly thank my incredible family.  To my 
mom, Tammy Wood, thank you for loving me when I am difficult and encouraging 
me to push limitsmy own and otherwise.  To my dad, David Wood, thank you for 
being the stable rock for our family that we can look to, rely on, and strive to be like.  
Your patience is admirable, but your love is treasured.  To my older brother, Justin 
Wood, thank you for reading over every word and meticulously looking up every 
passage.  My invasions of your home for weeks of writing will never be forgotten
by me or by Crystal (thanks sis).  To my younger brother, Jordan Wood, without 
you, none of this would be possible.  Just the mere presence of you and Alexis over 
the past year increased my endurance at times I did not want to proceed.  To list the 
ways you helped me, both tangibly and intangibly, would simply fail to communicate 
the depths of my gratitude.  So please accept this truncated and insufficient thank 
you. 
 From the outset, Helen Bond has been the supervisor par excellence.  From 
the gentle redirections of my recklessness, to the insightful guidance of my 
ignorance, to the measured critique of my hubris, your amiable navigation not only 
matured the project but also, at times, redeemed my sanity.  Thank youa thousand 
times over, thank you. 
 Finally, I dedicate this entire work to my wife, Sara, and my four wonderful 
children.  Kids, you bring me so much joy.  I love that you remind me not to take 
myself too seriously, and that while you are proud of me completing this degree, you 
are more excited about the possibility of playing games together.  You keep me 
grounded and, most importantly, you keep me smiling.  I love you. 
 Sara, thank you for challenging me to be a better husband, father, and scholar 
through your example of commitment, adventure, and undying love.  I would have 
given this entire process up for you, but it was you that would not let me give it up.  
You push me to expand my limits and yet to rest with intentionality.  You amaze me 
with your depth.  You challenge me with your grace.  For all of this, and many more 
reasons that words cannot express, this work belongs to you.

Introduction 
How does the book of Revelation interact with the empire? 
This question has driven much of the scholarly interest in the Apocalypse of 
John over the past 125 years.  Engaged directly and indirectly, it motivates 
intertextual explorations (both in the Old Testament and Graeco-Roman documents), 
historical inquiries, and sociological investigations.  While the question is rarely 
stated, it, nevertheless, guides considerations and conclusions for the multilayered 
imagery in the text of Revelation as well as examinations and determinations about 
the socio-historical setting of the texts audiencethose that sit just beyond what is 
written.  Regardless of the scholarly trajectory, the history of research for the 
Apocalypse of John persistently engages this key question: How does Revelation 
interact with the empire?1 
Similar queries dominate the broader biblical scholarship in recent Empire 
Studies in the disciplines of Paul and Jesus.2  To match these projects, the question 
is, at times, rephrased: How does Paul interact with the empire? or How does 
Jesus interact with the empire?  The advances of Empire Studies in Paul and Jesus 
have reinvigorated the imperial inquiry into the Apocalypse of John.  Though not 
always acknowledged, Revelation research over the past 125 years has struggled 
with this question that now arises afresh: How does Revelation interact with the 
empire? 
1 Leonard L. Thompson, The Book of Revelation: Apocalypse and Empire (Oxford: Oxford 
University Press, 1990), 2 reminds, The scholar seeks to uncover the connections that are not 
apparent on the surfacethe latent connections, the hidden structures, and the invisible systems of 
which the Book of Revelation is a part.

Introduction 
The Journey of the Question:  
Revelation Research of the Past 125 Years 
 In 1934, Ernst Lohmeyer lamented the relatively little advancement in 
Revelation research in his time: Es gibt wenige urchristliche Schriften, die im 
ganzen wie im einzelnen in den letzten 14 Jahren so viel umworben sind und 
dennoch in dem Geheimnis ihrer Geschichte wie ihres Sinnes unberhrt zu wohnen 
scheinen wie die Offenbarung Johannis.3  Setting aside the theological mayhem that 
assails Revelation at the popular level,4 modern critical scholarship echoes 
3 Ernst Lohmeyer, Die Offenbarung des Johannes 1920-1934, TRu 6 (1934): 270.  G.K. 
Chesterton, Orthodoxy (New York: Lane, 1908), 17 humorously concurs: Critics are much madder 
than poetsAnd though St. John the Evangelist saw many strange monsters in his vision, he saw no 
creature so wild as one of his own commentators. 
4 While some scholars describe Revelation as a maze [Stanley J. Grenz, The Millennial 
Maze (Downers Grove: IVP, 1992)], others suggest the book is a worthless pursuit that should be, in 
some ways, abandoned altogether.  As Elisabeth Schssler Fiorenza, The Book of Revelation: Justice 
and Judgment (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1985), 12 points out, due to the obsession of American 
fundamentalist writerswho ensnare the text in theological systems and constructsand the elusive 
meaning of Revelation, the scholarly community did not seriously engage Revelation in the research 
period 1945-1979.  The theological discussions, however, had a strong and productive presence in 
the early church, with the Historic Premillennial position surfacing in the works of Papias (Eusebius, 
Hist. eccl. 3.39.12), Justin Martyr (Dial. 80-81), Tertullian (Marc. 3.25), and Irenaeus (Haer. 5.35.2; 
Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 3.39.1) [modern interpreters include: Isbon T. Beckwith, The Apocalypse of John 
(New York: MacMillan, 1919; repr., Eugene, OR: Wipf & Stock, 2001); William Barclay, The

espoused by Origen (Princ. 2.11.2 and Comm. Matt. 17:35), Eusebius (Hist. eccl. 7.24-25; cf. 3.39.11-
13), Victorinus (Apoc. 20:1-3 and 20:4-5), Jerome (Comm. Isa. 11:15-16; 35:10; 60:1; Comm. Jer.

regard to the question: How does Revelation interact with the empire?  Examining

with the book of Revelation [Wilhelm Bousset, Der Antichrist (Gttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 
1895), 132-133; Elisabeth Schssler Fiorenza, Gericht und Heil.  Zum theologischen Verstndnis der

University Press, 1993)].  For a great summary, see Fiorenza, Justice, 1-32. 
5 In any survey work, there is a danger to oversimplify multiple authors work(s).  Thus, the 
placement of Revelation scholars into these categories does not intend to depreciate their unique 
emphases and important contributions.  Instead, the scholars are merely examples of the three 
dominant approaches in Revelation scholarship over the past 125 years.  Still further, these categories 
are not mutually exclusive.  Oftentimes, Revelation scholars use a combination of all three categories 
(and even, at times, the theological category).  For example, Steven J. Friesens work, although 
primarily focused on the socio-historical setting of the Apocalypse in relation to the Roman Imperial 
Cult, uses Old Testament texts (Daniel 7; Job 40-41; Isaiah 51:9-11; Ezek 29:3-5; 32:2-8; Jer 51:34-
37) to connect Revelation 13 to the Roman Empire [Steven J. Friesen, Imperial Cults and the 
Introduction 
Intertextual Explorations 
 The saturation of the Apocalypse with Old Testament allusions has long been 
recognized.  In 1895, Hermann Gunkel compared Job 40-41 with Revelation 13,6 and 
Henry Barclay Swetes 1911 commentary presented linguistic comparisons between 
Old Testament texts and the corresponding Revelation allusions.7  A variety of other 
projects appeared in the subsequent decades on Revelations Old Testament 
intertextuality,8 and yet, in the early 1980s Christopher Rowland accurately 
exclaims, The use of Scripture in the apocalypses is a subject which is only just 
being investigated in any detail.  Preliminary results suggest both that it is a field 
which demands further study and that many apocalyptic visions may have their 
origin in the study of Scripture.9 
 Over the past 30 years, Revelation scholarship has responded with 
enlightening Old Testament connections to the Apocalypse as clarifying referents for 
Apocalypse of John: Reading Revelation in the Ruins (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), 175; 
see also J. Nelson Kraybill, Imperial Cult and Commerce in Johns Apocalypse (JSNTSup 132; 
Sheffield: Sheffield, 1996), 143-163].  So, if a scholars work is discussed in the intertextual 
explorations category, it does not mean that they do not use history or sociology.

Introduction 
the disorienting imagery10some studies argue for over 500 allusions to the Old 
Testament in the 404 verses of Revelation.11  This approach, however, does not 
abandon imperial inquiry, but engages the question How does Revelation interact 
with the empire? indirectly through its exploration of Old Testament parallels.  For 
example, Revelation 13:1-18 is examined through allusions to Job 40-41 and Daniel 
7:1-7.  It is argued that the two beasts of Revelation 13 parallel the Leviathan and 
Behemoth creatures from Job 40-41 that are in opposition to God.12  In addition, the 
beast from the sea is described in Revelation 13:1-8 with language that parallels the 
four beasts from the sea in Daniel 7:1-7.13  These parallels, on some level, govern the

visionary framework for 12:18-13:18, the unity thereby imposed on the text unit is only superficial 
since important features of the Leviathan-Behemoth myth are omitted and replaced with motifs 
derived from the myth of the eschatological antagonist.

Introduction 
interpretative options for the imagery and lead to conclusions that identify Rome as a 
likely referent for the beast from the sea.14 
Indeed, this Old Testament analysis has produced valuable results and 
insights for the study of the Apocalypse, but it has not satisfied all of the imperial 
inquiries nor filled in all of the gaps of Revelations imagery.  For instance, how do 
we explain Revelations tendency in its imagery to alter certain Old Testament 
parallels?15  Or, what do we do when the Old Testament does not parallel certain 
images in the Apocalypse (i.e., the release of Satan in Rev 20:7-10)?  Still further, to 
show that a text refers to Rome does not explain why or for what purpose the author 
is referencing the empire.  Therefore, while the imagery of the Apocalypse is 
securely rooted in the Old Testament, the different nuances in the text invite further 
exploration in other areaseven within the discipline of intertextuality. 
In 1976, Adela Yarbro Collinss The Combat Myth in the Book of Revelation 
made a significant contribution to Graeco-Roman intertextual analysis of the 
Apocalypse.  The goal of the work was to prove that Revelation has a definite and 
coherent structure16 to its images and overall account that is best understood in the 
14  Beale, Revelation, 684, In Johns day the beast from the sea would have been identified 
as Rome.  See also Caird, Revelation, 170-73; Charles, Revelation, 1:345-367; Boring, Revelation, 
155. Cf. Smalley, Revelation, 336-337, who extends the imagery to anti-Christian forces throughout 
history as well.  For more discussion, see chapter 7 below. 
15 As footnote 12 above suggests, the Leviathan and Behemoth myth provides a possible 
connection to the existence of two beasts in the imagery of Revelation 13, but it does not explain 
why this element is even necessary.  The parallel to Daniel 7 with the beast from the sea in Revelation 
13:1-10 actually makes the existence of two beasts awkward, in that each beast in Daniel 7 
corresponds to a single kingdom (7:17).  If, therefore, the Apocalypse intended to parallel Rome 
alone, then why is it necessary to add a second beast to the equation in Revelation 13:11-18?  The Old 
Testament intertextual approach does not offer an adequate answer to this question.  Thus, to suggest 
that the Leviathan/Behemoth myth offers the two beast imagery still does not explain why there 
needed to be a shift in the imagery from Daniel 7 at all (see also 2 Esdras 11:1-6; 12:10-16).  See 
chapter 7 for further discussion.

Introduction 
framework of the ancient myths of combat.17  The combat myth is a narrative 
patternfound in Jewish, ancient Near East, and Graeco-Roman traditions18that 
depicts a struggle between two divine beings and their allies for universal kingship.  
One of the combatants is usually a monster, very often a dragon.19  In what follows, 
Collins draws striking parallels between Leto-Python-Apollo combat myth (popular 
in western Asia Minor contemporary with Revelation)20 and the cosmic war in 
Revelation 12 between the woman, the dragon, and the armies of heaven.21 
In conjunction with Old Testament allusions,22 Collins suggests that the 
presence of the combat myth pattern in Revelation positions the text in a familiar 
narrative of conflict for the Jewish peoplethis time in reference to Rome.23  Collins 
concludes:  
The combat myth in Revelation thus functions to reinforce resistance to 
Rome and to inspire willingness for martyrdom.  It does this by depicting for 
the readers the ultimate resolution of the conflict in which they are involved, 
i.e., their own ultimate salvation and the eventual defeat and destruction of 
their adversaries.  Reading or hearing the book of Revelation would provide a 
proleptic experience of victory.24

Introduction 
This intertextual exploration, then, develops into another answer to the question, 
How does Revelation interact with the empire?   
 Similarly, in 1979, John Courts book, Myth and History in the Book of 
Revelation uses Graeco-Roman mythologies as intertextual tools to explain the 
imagery in the Apocalypse.  For instance, Court identifies the first horsemen in 
Revelation 6who sits on a white horse, holds a bow, receives a crown, and rides 
out to conqueras the Graeco-Roman deity Mithras.  Court suggests that Mithras 
satisfies all of the key elements in the depiction of the first horsemen, given that 
Mithras has white horses that pull its chariot across the sky, bow and arrows, and 
even a radiate crown when he is identified with the sun-god.25  Still further, Court 
points out that Mithras is called unconquerable,26 and thus, as the legions marched 
out bent on conquest, worship of Mithras occurred at the manes of their horses.27  
Court then offers this conclusion: It is reasonable to suppose that in Asia Minor, 
much nearer to his home, Mithras the god of soldiers and battle, unconquerable as 
the sun, was already presenting a serious challenge to the much less belligerent 
religion of Christianity.28 
 Like Collins, the Graeco-Roman intertextual exploration of Court moves 
from interpretative parallels for the images of Revelation to imperial conclusions.  In 
connection with his observations on the four horsemen, Court comments on the fifth 
seal (Rev 6:9):

Introduction 
But the recognition of an historical reference is only part of the lesson of this 
vision.  The cry of the martyrs is answered in terms which leave no doubt that 
martyrdom is not only past fact but also present and inevitably future 
experienceIt is likely that John saw the threat of much worse to come, and 
composed this work to meet the threat.29 
Therefore, intertextual explorations (both Old Testament and Graeco-Roman) in the 
book of Revelation still address (albeit, at times, indirectly or tangentially) the 
question, How does Revelation interact with the empire? 
Historical Inquiries 
In Adolf Deissmanns masterful work Light from the Ancient East, he 
cautions against the use of intertextuality alone to engage the New Testament world, 
given that even if we now possessed the whole of it, [the literature] is after all 
only a fragment of the ancient world, though an important fragment.30  Furthermore, 
Deissmann notes that the literary memorials do not offer a clear perspective from, 
or about, the lower classes because the literature we possess is practically the 
evidence of the upper, cultivated classes about themselves.31  He insightfully 
continues, The lower classes are seldom allowed to speak, and where they do come 
to the frontin the comedies, for instancethey stand before us for the most part in 
the light thrown upon them from above.32 
In order to overcome these limitations, Deissmann invites the scholarly 
community of his day to move from primarily intertextual explorations to include 
29 Court, Myth, 66-67.

Introduction 
archaeological discoveries that offer great indirect value33 from a bottom-up 
perspective.34  Deissmanns goal was not to supplant intertextuality, but supplement 
the literary perspective with the archaeological perspective.35  In response to the 
innovative interpretations of New Testament texts throughout his work,36 
Deissmanns project was extended to the book of Revelation. 
To be sure, historical connections to the book of Revelation are found in 
various works over the past 125 years in connection with the Parthians,37 cultic 
vessels,38 and other imperial elements.  In Revelation 13 alone, the beast from the sea 
(13:1-10) is identified as the Roman Empire,39 the beast from the earth (13:11-15) 
the Roman imperial cult,40 and the mark of the beast (13:16-18) as an imperial seal 
33 Deissmann, Light, 4, 48. 
34 Deissmann, Light, 9.  His emphasis on the perspective of the lower classes resonates 
throughout the entire project and, as he suggests (p. 290), could even be linked to his overall thesis.  
Indeed, his archaeological observations coalesce into a picture of the New Testament Christian 
community as predominately impoverished, as evidenced by linguistic parallels between the New 
Testament and common ostracas (pp. 50-55, 60, 62 and 145), New Testament references to topics dear 
to the first century lower classes (pp. 291, 312-313, 313, 328-329), and other evidences.  For differing 
and mediating views, see Kraybill, Imperial, 80-83, 86-90; Thompson, Revelation, 128-129; Collins,

Introduction 
on deeds of sale.41  However, the works of William Ramsay and Colin J. Hemer 
are unsurpassed in the application of Deissmanns archaeological emphasis to the 
Apocalypse. 
In 1904, Ramsay published The Letters to the Seven Churches,42 which 
mined the archaeological sites of the seven churches of Asia Minor for parallels to 
Revelation 2-3.  This work was updated and further advanced by Hemers book The 
Letters to the Seven Churches of Asia in Their Local Setting.  Both studies engaged 
the imagery of Revelation by drawing historical parallels to the people of the text 
and their socio-historical setting with a cumulative methodologyeven if some of 
the parallels are tenuous.43  Hemer admits, A cumulative case is validated by a 
sufficiency of evidence; if an excess is offered, and some of it rejected, the basic 
case is not thereby overthrown.44   
While Ramsay and Hemer provide a treasure trove of possible imperial 
interactions and historical background for the cities of Revelation, the cumulative 
methodology, mimicked by some scholars, presents two deficiencies for historical 
inquiries.  First, historical connections suffer without discussion of the significance 
of the parallel, that is, to state that there is an historical connection does not explain 
why or for what purpose the author is referencing this parallel.  For example, G.K.

Churches of Asia in Their Local Setting (JSNTSup 11; Sheffield: JSOT, 1986; repr., Grand Rapids: 
Eerdmans, 2001), 127 asserts (without any evidence), These words seem likely to have referred to an 
existing problem, and Thyatira was the place where the alliance of a pagan system with the imperial 
cult was liable to involve the Christian in commercial ruinThe [mark of the beast] is suggestive of 
craftsmen who were branded as apostate by their membership of the guilds.  The usage would accord 
with the use of symbols in contemporary conventions of numismatic representation, the right hand 
standing for their working lives as opposed to their professed status.

Introduction 
Beale connects the image of one like a son of man who holds seven stars in his 
hand (Rev 1:16) to an historical parallel: Nevertheless, the picture could be a 
polemic against the imperial myth of an emperors son who dies and becomes a 
divine ruler over the stars of heaven.45  Beyond the possibility of an historical 
connection, the historical inquiry, however, must extend to questions of significance: 
Why would the author of Revelation choose this image?  Was this image significant 
in Roman imagery or mythology?  Is this connection imperially subversive, 
complicit, or indifferent?  Without answers to these questions, the historical 
connection stagnates as an intriguing possibility.46 
45 Beale, Revelation, 211. 
46 Similarly, Keener, Revelation, 336, in passing, lists historical parallels for the blasphemous 
name on the beast in Revelation 13:1, Roman coins in the eastern Mediterranean announced that the 
emperor was son of God and God; Domitian even demanded the title Lord and God.  While 
these historical parallels may in fact explain the imagery in the Apocalypse, merely listing the parallel 
does not confirm its validity nor extend the inquiry.  [See also Beale, Revelation, 684 for a similar 
treatment of this imagery in Rev 13:1.  Cf. Osborne, Revelation, 240].  Still further, in David Aunes 
comments on the mighty angel of Revelation 10, he offers the Colossos of Rhodes as an historical 
parallel for the imagery of the Apocalypse (Aune, Revelation, 2:556).  Aune parallels the bronze 
material of the Colossos to the legs of the mighty angel (Rev 10:1although, the legs of the angel in 
Rev 10:1 were not made of bronze but were like fiery pillars) and the statues representation of 
Helios to the angels face that was like the sun (10:1).  In addition, Aune notes that the mighty 
angel has his right hand raised (10:5) like the Colossos statue, whose right hand was raised to either 
hold a torch or shade his eyes from the sun.  Aune (Revelation, 2:556) also suggests the stance of 
the mighty angel in 10:5 (standing on the sea and on the land) could parallel the Colossos, in that 
the statue stood at the harbor of Rhodes and allowed ships to pass through its legs [Ironically, Aune 
also describes this view of the statues position as erroneous and points out that actually it stood on 
a promontory overlooking the harbor].  In light of these parallels, Aune (Revelation, 2:556-557) 
concludes, The many similarities between the description of the angel in 10:1-6 and that which is 
known of the Colossos of Rhodes suggest that the imagery involved was widely known and generally 
connected with the magnificent Colossos.  Aunes conclusion suggests that the imagery in Revelation 
10:1-6 proves the widespread knowledge of the Colossos of Rhodes.  However, in order for this statue 
to be a candidate for a parallel to the imagery of Revelation, he must prove the opposite: that the 
Colossos was widespread and known in the imperial context of the Apocalypse.  To this point, Aune 
(Revelation, 2:556) notes that the statue was erected in ca. 280 B.C.E. by Chares of Lindos and was 
destroyed by an earthquake in 224 B.C.E.  It lay in ruins for centuries until Hadrian repaired it some 
three hundred years later.  At the time of Revelations composition, then, the Colossos had been in 
ruins for over two hundred years and would not be repaired for decades more.  Therefore, in order for 
this historical parallel to explain the imagery of Revelation, Aune must explain how the Colossos 
played a significant role in the imperial context in spite of its ruinous state.  He must answer questions 
like, Why would a statue on the island of Rhodes have been significant to the churches of Asia 
Minor?  Was the statue significant in the reign of the emperor at the time of Revelations 
composition?  If so, then what imperial propaganda utilizes this Colossos and for what purpose?  Still 
further, why did the Apocalypse use this image instead of others to develop its message? 
Introduction 
At its core, historical inquiry attempts to answer a key question that is rarely 
vocalized but readily assumed: How does Revelation interact with the empire?  
The complexity of this question, however, cannot be satisfactorily answered through 
the cumulative methodology.  To show parallels with imperial imagery in the 
Apocalypse suggests that Revelation does interact with the empire, but it does not 
explain the nature of the interaction.  It does not explore the socio-cultural 
complexities that explain why the imperial imagery is used nor how the imagery is 
engaged.  In other words, the cumulative methodology shows that interaction 
between the Apocalypse and the Roman Empire exists, but it stops short of 
answering the question, How does Revelation interact with the empire? 
Sociological Investigations 
 In order to address the interaction of the Apocalypse with the empire, a 
central sociological question must be engaged, What was happening to Christians in 
the empire at the time of Revelations composition?  More specifically, Were the 
Christians being persecuted by the empire when Revelation was written?  As Adela 
Yarbro Collins warns, Without a precise knowledge of the books setting, the 
interpreter is in danger of serious misunderstanding.47 
 In 1984, Collins published Crisis & Catharsis: The Power of the Apocalypse 
as an attempt to get behind the text with history, sociology, anthropology, and 
especially psychology to develop the elusive setting of Revelation.48  Due to four 
sociological difficulties for first century Christians in Asia Minor(1) Jewish 
ostracism; (2) Gentile opposition; (3) Christian compromise; (4) Roman disfavor

48 Collins, Crisis, 22.  See also Adela Yarbro Collins, Early Christian Apocalypticism: 
Genre and Social Setting, Semeia 36 (1986): 1-12. 
Introduction 
Christians were plagued with feelings of fear and powerlessness.49  According to 
Collins, this produced cognitive dissonance in the author of Revelation, in that the 
social situation as he perceived it did not correspond to the Christian belief that 
the kingdom of God and Christ had been established.50  This cognitive conflict 
prompted the composition of the Apocalypse, and as a result, the task of Revelation 
was to overcome the unbearable tension perceived by the author between what was 
and what ought to have been.51 
 Collins concludes that the conflict, however, was not actual but only a 
perceived crisis.  
The evidence does not support the conclusion that the book of Revelation 
was written in response to an external crisis due to some recent historical or 
social change.  The Apocalypse was indeed written in response to a crisis, but 
one that resulted from the clash between the expectations of John and like-
minded Christians and the social reality within which they had to live.52 
In other words, the crisis only existed in the perception of John and other perceiving 
Christians, but it did not exist in imperial practice or sentiment.  From this 
perspective, the Apocalypse, then, has three primary purposes: (1) to reveal the 
conflict to the unperceiving, (2) to intensify the tension already felt by some, and (3) 
to provide catharsis for the crisis through the imaginative event experienced in the 
text.53

51 Collins, Crisis, 141.

Practices, Theologies, and Traditions (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012), 13. 
53 Collins, Crisis, 73-74, 141-142, 144, 153-154.  
Introduction 
 This conclusion, then, suggests an anti-Roman posture of the book of 
Revelation, in which, on some level, the Apocalypse is picking an imperial fight.  
Collins summarizes the imperial interaction of Revelation:  
John adapted oral and literary anti-Roman tradition into a particularly fierce 
and dualistic literary image of the insurmountable opposition between the 
servants of God and the servants of Rome.  He highlighted and emphasized 
the suffering of Christians at the hands of Rome and painted a picture of the 
empire which put this trait of persecutor at the very center.  In this way he 
apparently hoped to reinforce whatever hostility to Rome his readers might 
already have had and to awaken an anti-Roman attitude in those who were 
neutral or even open to Roman culture.54 
Thus, for Collins, the images in Revelation do not reflect the actual historical 
situation but only the perceived (or even desired) crisis from the Seers cognitive 
dissonance, which can only be satisfied with images of Romes destruction. 
 Elisabeth Schssler Fiorenza, though, concludes that Revelation was a 
response to actual harassment and persecution.55  Through literary criticism, 
Fiorenza attempts to isolate an integrating center that reveals the historical-social-
religious experience that generated the particular form-content configuration 
(Gestalt) of Rev.56  Thus, the structure (form) and the images (content) reflect the 
historical subtext and invite the readers to reconstruct it.57 
 In agreement with Ernst Ksemann, Fiorenza posits power as the 
integrating center of apocalyptic ideology;58 power, however, must be viewed from 
the perspective of those who have no power:

Introduction 
Moreover, the answer to the problem will also depend on whose perspective 
we adopt.  One could argue from the perspective of well-to-do white 
Americans that no harassment, denigration, discrimination, or oppression of 
blacks existed at the time of Martin Luther King, Jr., although King was 
assassinated.  The perspective and experience of blacks would be quite 
different.59 
From this point of view, Fiorenza proposes that Revelation is a response to (1) 
societal injustices60 and (2) the imperial cult.61  In contradistinction to Collins, 
Fiorenza argues that the crisis provided by these two elements were not just 
perceived but were actual afflictions manifested in the exploitative, destructive, and 
dehumanizing power of Rome that resulted in poverty, banishment, violence, 
harassment, and assassination.62  In this context, Revelation does not offer a 
psychological escape,63 but an opportunity to participate in imperial opposition 
through the mytho-poetic imagery.64  The evocative power of Revelations 
imagery, then, is to motivate and encourage Christians in their confrontation with 
Romes power and cult.65 
 In 1990, Leonard Thompson joins the sociological investigation of the 
Apocalypse with his work, The Book of Revelation: Apocalypse and Empire.  
Thompsons reconstruction of the social setting adapts the works of Walter 
Schmithals66 and Adela Yarbro Collins.67  Schmithalss work allows Thompson to

posit that apocalypses are not caused by social, historical forces but are 
intrinsically self-referential.68  In contrast to Fiorenza, Schmithals urges the scholar 
to sever connections between apocalyptic and social settings, which suggests that 
the actual historical context is not reflected in the apocalyptic text at all.69   
In agreement with Collins, Thompson suggests that Revelation is a record of 
a perceived crisis.  The synthesis of Schmithals and Collins is evident in 
Thompsons summary: 
[Perceived Crisis] is a way of saying that (1) the author of an apocalypse 
considers a situation to be a crisis but (2) that the crisis dimensions of the 
situation are evident only through his angle of visionthat is, the crisis 
becomes visible only through the revealed knowledge in an apocalypse; prior 
to that knowledge there is no crisis. Thus, the concept perceived crisis 
contributes to our understanding of how an apocalypse functions in a social 
situation; but it sheds no light on the social occasion of an apocalypse, for 
any social situation can be perceived as one of crisis.70 
Since the Apocalypse only offers the writers perceived crisis and does not reflect 
the actual historical context, the socio-historical setting must be approached from 
documents and evidence outside of Revelation.   
So, Thompson turns his attention to the conventional depiction of the 
emperor Domitian: a mad tyrant who creates crisis for the entire Roman world
Christians included.71  His analysis of the evidence suggests that an official portrait 
of Domitian was drawn a few years after his death by a circle of writers around Pliny 
67 Collins, Crisis & Catharsis.  See pp. 13-15 above.

the Younger that included Tacitus and Suetonius.72  This circle of writers 
intentionally malign the reign of Domitian (for Trajanic propaganda purposes) and 
distort virtually every area of Domitians public and state activity during the time of 
his emperorship.73  Thus, Thompson concludes that our socio-historical 
suppositions about Christians at the end of the first-century suffer from effective 
anti-Domitian propaganda: 
The empireespecially under Domitianwas beneficial to rich and poor 
provincials; and there were checks against extensive abuse of the poorer 
provincials by the richer ones.  There is little evidence to suggest 
fundamental conflicts either within the economic structure of the province or 
between the province and Rome.  The writer of the Book of Revelation may 
urge his readers to see conflicts in their urban setting and to think of Roman 
society as the enemy, but those conflicts do not reside in Asian social 
structures.  The urban setting in which Christians worshipped and lived was 
stable and beneficial to all who participated in its social and economic 
institutions.74 
In fact, Thompson emphatically states that Christians did not experience persecution 
at all; instead the historical evidence suggests that Christians lived quiet lives, not 
much different from other provincials.75 
 By extension, Thompson suggests that the conflict in the book of Revelation 
was a fabrication of the author, who was not even banished to the island of Patmos 
but went there on his own accord.76  Using Peter Bergers insights on cognitive

76 Thompson, Revelation, 172-173.  See also Thompson, Revelation, 173 for his dismissal of 
the death of Antipas in Rev 2:13.  In fact, Thompson suggests that all language of crisis is merely an 
expression of the apocalyptic genre and not a reflection of the socio-historical setting.  He writes, In 
light of the earlier discussion about perceived crisis, exhortations to remain faithful and consolations 
in the face of oppression may also be formal elements in the genre and therefore not contribute to any 
understanding of the social occasion of an apocalypse (pg. 30).  And later he reiterates, There is a 
crisis orientation in the Book of Revelation, but it is a characteristic of the genre, not of political

minority, Thompson characterizes Revelation as negative and hostile expressions 
toward the majority due to the empires refusal to believe the Christian 
reconstruction of what the world is really like.77  Consequently, the Apocalypse 
intends to provoke his audience to anti-Roman actions.  As Thompson asserts, In 
Johns world, Christians should seek out clashes with the stateHere John is 
unambiguous.  Within his vision of reality, he and all those who wear the white 
garments are pitted against the evil empire.78 
 Sociological investigations into the book of Revelation engage the world that 
rests just beyond the text itself.  The works of Adela Yarbro Collins, Elisabeth 
Schssler Fiorenza, and Leonard Thompson significantly advance this study in 
Revelationas is evidenced by the subsequent projects that incorporate and build 
upon their work.79  Indeed, their works compel future projects to address an 
important issue in imperial inquiry: persecution of Christians.  Thus, by asking 
What was happening to Christians in the empire at the time of Revelations 
composition? the sociological investigation indirectly engages a larger question:

Introduction 
The Emergence of Focused Imperial Inquiry: 
Revelation Research in the Past 25 Years 
 In the past 25 years, Revelation research has combined intertextual 
explorations, historical inquiries, and sociological investigations to focus concerted 
attention on answering the question: How does Revelation interact with the 
empire?  In 1985, Elisabeth Schssler Fiorenza exhorted Revelation scholars to 
direct attention to this question through the socio-historical entry point of the 
imperial cult.80  While the imperial cult has been recognized over the past 125 years 
as a key point of interaction with the New Testament,81 the recent works of J. Nelson 
Kraybill and Steven J. Friesen are the most comprehensive applications of emperor 
worship to the book of Revelation. 
 J. Nelson Kraybills monograph Imperial Cult and Commerce in Johns 
Apocalypse was published in 1996.  With intertextual contours,82 Kraybills study 
begins with the question, Why does John on Patmos, in a book written for 
Christians living under Roman rule, turn his attention to merchants, shipmasters and 
sailors at the climactic moment of Babylons (Romes) demise?83  Throughout the 
project, Kraybill argues that the economic benefit found in the patron/client 
80 Fiorenza, Justice, 19, Similarly Roman presence, especially the imperial cult, needs to be 
investigated more fully with respect to Rev.  See also Rowland, Heaven, 411; Klaus Wengst, Pax 
Romana and the Peace of Jesus Christ (trans. John Bowden; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1987), 119-122.

authors, see: Deissmann, Light, 338 (n. 2) and Fiorenza, Justice, 30 (n. 63). 
82 Kraybill, Imperial, 21-22, The book is rife with imagery that already had a long history in 
Jewish or pagan tradition before John applied it to the Roman Empire of his dayThe following 
study explores the meaning key symbols in Revelation already had when John wove them into his 
book.  See also Kraybill, Imperial, 150, 214. 
83 Kraybill, Imperial, 15.  As noted on p. 22, this question simply rephrases Richard 
Bauckhams inquiry: Why then does John give us the perspective of Romes collaborators in evil: the 
ruling classes, the mercantile magnates, the shipping industry? 
Introduction 
relationships embedded in the imperial cult presented a unique temptation for the 
Christians of Asia Minor to take part in the Roman economic system.   
Kraybill writes, John of Patmos had the perception to see that Romes 
political and economic grandeur was attractive to some followers of JesusIn light 
of this belief, Revelation 18 is more than a poem about the fall of a foe; it is a clarion 
call for Christians to sever all economic and political ties with an Empire that had 
sold out to injustice, idolatry and greed.84  The imperative to come out of her (Rev 
18:4), according to Kraybill, was not because commerce and tradewere 
intrinsically evil,85 but because of the economic interweaving of the Roman market 
and emperor worship.  He states that John warned Christians to sever or to avoid 
economic and political ties with Rome because institutions and structures of the 
Roman Empire were saturated with unholy allegiance to an Emperor who claimed to 
be divine (or was treated as such).86  In fact, Kraybill concludes that the imperial 
cult permeated Roman economics so thoroughly that it was difficult to buy or sell 
without the mark of the beast (13:17).87 
Although Revelation 18 is the primary text in Kraybills analysis, the 
intention is for his insights into the imperial cults involvement in the socio-
economic world of the Apocalypse to be used for understanding the overall message 
of the book,88 that is, Johns attitude toward Rome and his reasons for rejecting 
84 Kraybill, Imperial, 16.  So also, Kraybill, Imperial, 100-101, there is reason to believe 
some Christians in the seven churches were trying their best to become insiders. Cf. Kraybill,

Introduction 
economic involvement with her.89  In other words, Kraybill uses the imperial cult as 
an entry point to answer the question, How does John interact with the empire? 
With similar trajectories, Steven J. Friesens work Imperial Cults and the 
Apocalypse of John, published in 2001, begins with a broad analysis of the imperial 
cults development in Asia Minor from the first century B.C.E. to the end of the first 
century C.E. before he applies his observations to four thematic categories derived 
from phenomenological historical methodologies: [1] cosmogony; [2] cosmology; 
[3] human maturation; and [4] eschatology.90  As a result, Friesens work advances 
Kraybills insights in that Friesen does not limit his imperial cult analysis to 
commerce nor his application to one text in Revelation.  Specifically, Friesen isolates 
a cosmological collision course between the imperial cult and the Apocalypse, 
given that in Roman society space was centered on Rome and time was organized 
around Augustus and the accomplishments of the empire.91  The imperial cult, then, 
is a religious expression of the order of the world, which, as Friesen points out, can 
be used in the service of hegemony as well as in support of resistance.92  Thus, it is 
in this religious context that the book of Revelation offers a resistance religion 
from the perspective of the subjugated people.93

doctoral dissertation, Twice Neokoros: Ephesus, Asia & the Cult of the Flavian Imperial Family 
(Leiden: Brill, 1993).  In fact, Friesen foreshadowed the 2001 project in Friesen, Neokoros, 165 (n.

context.  It is a question to which I hope to return in a separate study.

Introduction 
Initially, Friesen develops this imperial interaction with the Apocalypse by 
analyzing the establishment of provincial imperial cult temples.  In 29 B.C.E., 
Pergamum was the first city approved to construct an imperial cult temple in honor 
of Rome and Augustus.94  About fifty years later, Smyrnas request for a temple in 
honor of Tiberius, Livia, and the Senate was granted, which symbolized Tiberius 
allegiance to Roman corporate authority and his key dynastic connection to 
Augustus through Augustus widow Livia.95 
 In the city of Miletus in ca. 40 C.E., Caligula attempted a unique 
modification to the imperial cult.96  First, unlike the previous two provincial imperial 
cults, Caligula was the catalyst for the temple cult in Miletus and not the city itself.97  
Second, this temple was to be dedicated to Caligula only and not to any other 
individual or collective (e.g., Rome, Livia, the Senate).98  Upon his death in 41 C.E., 
however, the brash project was promptly abandoned.99  The next provincial imperial 
94 Friesen, Neokoros, 7-15; Friesen, Imperial, 27.  Friesen, Imperial, 29 recounts the difficult 
political navigation that Octavian faced with the request to build this temple in Pergamum in his 
honor: If Octavian approved the request, the Senate might use it against him as a sign of his desire 
for absolute rule.  If Octavian refused cultic honors for himself, he could anticipate the continuation 
and probable proliferation of cults for Roman officials and would thus assist possible usurpers.  By 
approving a cult for himself, Octavian began the process by which all ruler cults in Asia focused on 
the emperor and the imperial family.  After his reign, no new cults of Roman officials were founded 
and cults of emperors spread.  Although shrewdly handled with the addition of Rome in the cult [see 
Friesen, Neokoros, 58 for further discussion], this account shows the political tumult that imperial cult 
temples could have for emperors. 
95 Friesen, Imperial, 38.  See also Friesen, Neokoros, 15-21. 
96 For this date, see Friesen, Neokoros, 24.  Friesens work corrects the erroneous attribution 
of an imperial cult temple under Caligula in Ephesus (cf. Thompson, Revelation, 173). 
97 Friesen, Neokoros, 24 and Friesen, Imperial, 39-40 points to Dio Cass. 59.28.1 as 
evidence. 
98 Friesen, Neokoros, 22. 
99 Friesen, Imperial, 40-41.  See also Friesen, Neokoros, 21-26.  Kraybill, Imperial, 61 
inaccurately concludes, Miletus established a third provincial cult during the reign of Caligula. 
Introduction 
cult temple was constructed in 89/90 C.E. in the city of Ephesus.100  Although 
established under Domitian, Friesen argues that epigraphic evidence reveals that the 
provincial cult of the Sebastoi in Ephesus was a cult for the emperors of the Flavian 
family, and perhaps included Domitia.101 
 This survey of the provincial temples leads Friesen to the conclusion that the 
imperial cult attempted to define relationships between the imperial center and the 
peripheral areas and that its message particularly dealt with cosmology.102  
Specifically, Friesen writes:  
In these and other ways, provincial cults created, maintained, and refined 
meaningful order in the world.  Although there were other functions of these 
institutions, the provincial temples served as crucial symbols of the 
cosmology that supported imperial rule, that defined the evolving identity of 
the province, and that promoted provincial obedience at various levels of 
society.103 
In what follows, Friesen articulates the cosmological claims of the book of 
Revelation as a response to the imperial cult. 
100 Friesen, Imperial, 43-52.  Friesen, Neokoros, 29-75 articulates in great detail the 
significance of this temple for the city of Ephesus.  Previously, cities were not considered for an 
imperial cult temple if they already had a prominent cultic temple for another deity or emperor.  Given 
that Ephesus already was the center of worship for Artemis (so Acts 19:23-41), the addition of this 
provincial imperial cult temple elevated the status of the city, which now boasts the unique title of 
twice neokoros. 
101 Friesen, Neokoros, 36.  Significantly, Friesen concludes that Domitians temple in 
Ephesus is more appropriately labeled the temple of the Sebastoi (Neokoros, 35-38), and, in 
addition, the evidence does not support any extraordinary cultic honors for Domitian (Friesen, 
Neokoros, 34, 40, 165-166).  Friesen, Imperial, 149 concludes, The evidence for imperial cults in 
Asia from the Domitianic period also fit within the mainstream of imperial cult practice.  There is no 
sign of the exaggerated claims alleged for this period.  The Temple of the Sebastoi at Ephesos was 
well within the norm for provincial cults.  Cf. Kraybill, Imperial, 29. 
102 Friesen, Imperial, 53-54. 
103 Friesen, Imperial, 55.  At this point in the book, Friesen traces municipal imperial cults 
and the overall pervasiveness of the imperial cult into various aspects of society.  To summarize, 
Friesen, Imperial, 120 exclaims, Choir practices, esoteric rituals, mourning, remembrance of 
ancestors, the passing of winter, womens rituals, the agricultural cycles, the socialization of sons, 
household worshipall these were touched by imperial cults in group settings. 
Introduction 
 After an analysis of Revelations date (locating the text in space and time),104 
Friesen mines the cosmological themes in the book of Revelation (locating space and 
time in the text).105  This study concludes with a contrapuntal articulation of 
Revelations cosmology:  
[John] tried to disabuse his audience of the notion that Jerusalem, Rome, or 
any earthly city could function as the geographic center of reality.  He instead 
looked upward, defining Gods throne as the meaningful center that infuses 
all other space with meaning.  Similarly, the most important type of time in 
Johns text was not dictated by the actions of the emperors; it was instead the 
time experienced in true worship.  During worship one learned the true 
meaning of all other times and experienced some of them to some degree.106 
From this cosmological observation, Friesen comes to an anti-Roman conclusion for 
the book of Revelation, John was primarily concerned to present before the 
churches the character of his opposition to empire.  His opposition was religious: 
Rome had claimed a status that belonged only to God.107  The application, however, 
104 Friesen, Imperial, 135-151.  Although he lands on a Domitianic date (pp. 140, 143, 151), 
he peculiarly states that his phenomenological approach does not necessitate a date: A structural 
comparison does not require us to choose a particular date within the decades when Revelation was 
surely written. Although I conclude that Revelation was probably written in the late first century, 
the following analysis is general enough to be applicable whether one is persuaded that Revelation 
was written in 69 or 96 CE.  See pp. 77-80 below for a discussion of the importance of the date of the 
composition of Revelation for imperial inquiry. 
105 Friesen, Imperial, 152-166. 
106 Friesen, Imperial, 165.  Chapter 10 (pp. 167-179) builds upon the cosmological emphasis 
through an examination of the function of myth in communities and in Revelation.  Although Friesen, 
Imperial, 4 states four thematic categories, cosmology is the primary focus of Friesens work.  
Although eschatology is sporadically (and at times implicitly) engaged throughout, it is usually in 
conjunction with a cosmological point.  For example, Friesen, Imperial, 165-166 states, Rather than 
settling for the flawed eschatology of imperial cults in which one prays for the eternal reign of the 
Roman emperor, John chose a thorough eschatology that held strictly to the integrity of absolute being 
and demanded the eventual demise of all symbols.  This entailed a rejection of the powerful and 
relatively stable cosmology of his social setting.  He fashioned instead a more dangerous definition of 
reality, with space and time organized around the absent throne of God while the churches waited for 
an unfilled future on a not-yet-created earth.  In this way the present was portrayed as paradox, not as 
wholeness.  Human maturation is first dealt with on p. 185, while cosmogony is not addressed until 
p. 197, and his conclusion is, As in contemporary imperial cults, so in Revelation there was relatively 
little interest in reopening the accepted cosmogonic narratives to introduce new 
characters.cosmogony and the role of the Christ in those events are not primary issues in 
Revelation. 
107 Friesen, Imperial, 208.  In addition, Friesen, Imperial, 211 states that Revelation is an 
anti-imperial text 
Introduction 
is not limited to Rome alonefor Friesen extends the opposition to state that John 
was not simply anti-Roman; he was anti-empire.108 
Building on the Past: 
Four Observations on Revelation Research 
 The approaches and projects over the past 125 years in Revelation 
scholarship have, to varying degrees, engaged the question, How does the book of 
Revelation interact with the empire?  Through intertextual explorations (both Old 
Testament and Graeco-Roman), historical inquiries, and sociological investigations 
into the Apocalypse, scholars intermittently addressed imperial interaction.  These 
advances paved the way for the insightful works of J. Nelson Kraybill and Steven J. 
Friesen.  Four observations from this history of research will summarize where we 
have been and suggest where we should go from here in order to answer more 
adequately the question, How does Revelation interact with the empire? 
Observation #1: The Perspective of the Oppressed 
 Conclusions about imperial interaction must not be divorced from the 
perspective of the oppressed.  Questions about Revelations occasion, purpose, 
imagery, application, audience are all significantly impacted if the evidence is 
analyzed from the perspective of the imperial elite instead of the non-elite.  To 
suggest, then, that the socio-historical setting of Revelation was stable and 
beneficial to all oversimplifies the complexities of oppression and resistance and, in 
addition, simply ignores the dissident voices of the subjugated.109  As a result, this 
108 Friesen, Imperial, 4.  The quote continues to include: The visionary argument built a 
broader case, one that questions every imperialist project.  Johns apocalyptic imagery depicted Rome 
in ruins and would lay waste to the structures of modern hegemony as well. 
109 Thompson, Revelation, 167.  In response to Thompsons reconstruction of the socio-
historical context in which Domitian is portrayed as a benevolent emperor to both rich and poor, 
Introduction 
dissertation incorporates recent studies from Postcolonial Criticism and 
Examinations of Dominance as indispensable influences on imperial inquiries into 
the New Testament text.110 
Observation #2: The Presence of Persecution (or lack thereof) 
 Persecution is a central issue for Revelation studies.  Not only does the 
presence of persecution (or lack thereof) guide questions about how or why certain 
images appear in Revelation, but it also directly impacts the question How does 
Revelation interact with the empire?  As Elisabeth Schssler Fiorenza suggests, if 
the evidence is viewed from the perspective of the oppressed, then what constitutes 
as persecution and how the term is even defined significantly alters.111 
From this vantage point, a subjects perceived crisis does not necessitate a 
fabrication of conflict, but instead an actual crisis may existeven if the imperial 
Christian and non-Christian, Fiorenza, Justice, 8 writes, L. Thompson has rejected the crisis theory 
as unacceptable.  He argues that the standard portrait of Domitian found in Roman sources was a 
product of the rhetoric of Trajans time that played up the evil nature of the Domitianic past in order 
to contrast it with the ideal character of the Trajanic present.  This may be the case from the 
perspective of official Roman historiography, but it is not borne out by the experience articulated in 
Rev. and other NT writings. 
110 Friesen, Imperial, 4 recognizes the value of these studies for his own work as well and 
states, I adopt a postcolonial strategycontrapuntal interpretation of dominant and resistant 
historiesto keep from ignoring marginal voices.  Nevertheless, Friesen only briefly interacts with 
Edward Saids work Culture and Imperialism (p. 17not engaging more recent works by Homi 
Bhabha, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, R.S. Sugirtharajah, Stephen Moore, and Fernando Segovia) and 
just takes the postcolonial point that there is a dominant aspect to the world in which things like 
religion are used as weapons against their subjects (p. 17).  Friesen does not engage Examinations of 
Dominance (i.e., James C. Scott) nor other works of Empire Studies in the New Testament (i.e., 
Richard Horsley, Warren Carter, etc.).  See chapters 1 and 2 below for a full discussion of Empire 
Studies, Postcolonial Criticism, and Examinations of Dominance. 
111 Fiorenza, Justice, 9.  Fiorenza, Justice, 19-20 emphasizes the importance of persecution 
for imperial inquiry when she writes, One of the main points of contention in evaluating the 
relationship of Rev. to the Roman Empire continues to revolve around the question of whether a 
persecution of Christians took place under Domitian.  Conversely, Friesen, Imperial, 145 states, 
There is no need to posit persecution or a widespread crisis in society to explain the hostility of 
Revelation toward Roman rule (see also Rowland, Heaven, 408).  Although Friesen does 
acknowledge two lines later, Even if our evidence suggests that the overall situation was stable, we 
should not conclude that all the inhabitants were satisfied.  Imperial authority always meets forms of 
resistance, because the encompassing claims of imperial authority cannot match the diversity of actual 
experiences and because imperial authority never legitimates the experiences of its victims. 
Introduction 
documents suggest otherwise.  The only way to determine if the socio-historical 
context was one of impending crisis, no crisis, or rampant persecution is to view the 
imperial evidence of that time period from the perspective of the dominatedthe 
subjects of the empire.  Thus, this dissertation establishes a date of composition for 
the book of Revelation112 in order to examine the imperial evidence of persecution 
(or lack thereof) from a subjugated point of view.113 
Observation #3: The Reconstruction of the Socio-Historical Context 
 In the reconstruction of the socio-historical context of Revelation, Leonard 
Thompsons observation that the primary source should not be the emotively charged 
Apocalypse is to be commended.114  Indeed, the documents and evidence outside of 
Revelation provide a larger sample of informative sources with a greater breadth of 
perspective.  Yet, it is an overstatement to suggest that the Apocalypse is completely 
severed from the social setting in which it was composed.115  The works of Kraybill 
and Friesen display the value of combining both the imperial evidence in the Roman 
world and the images and themes found in the book of Revelation in order to 
reconstruct the socio-historical milieu.  Therefore, this dissertation engages the 
socio-historical setting through numismatics, inscriptions, Graeco-Roman 
intertextuality, architecture, and other non-Christian sources116 in juxtaposition to 
the imperial interactions evident in the text of the Apocalypse itself.117

Introduction 
Observation #4: The Limitation of the Imperial Cult 
 The imperial cult as the socio-historical entry point to answer the question, 
How does Revelation interact with the empire? has been expressed by a wide 
variety of authors118 and has produced significant contributions to the 
conversation.119  Friesen heralds, In Johns view, the encounter with imperial cults 
was the most urgent.120  Likewise, Kraybill describes emperor worship as deeply 
offensive to John121 and even suggests that John thought some soon would die for 
refusing to participate (20:4; cf. 6.9-11).122  The evidence, however, suggests that 
while the imperial cult is significant, the self-understanding of Rome is much larger 
than emperor worship. 
 For example, Friesens description of the temple of the Sebastoi in Ephesus 
includes the identification of two eastern deities (Attis and Isis) from the original 
faade that contained possibly 35-40 other gods and goddesses from east and 
west.123  The presence of these deities lining the provincial imperial cult temple 
suggests, according to Friesen, that the emperors joined the ranks of the divine and 
played their own particular role in that realm.124  In other words, the emperor and 
118 Fiorenza, Justice, 91 suggests that John focused [Revelation] against Domitian and the 
imperial cult (see also Fiorenza, Justice, 24-25, 188, 193-194).  Even Collins, Crisis, 73 states, A 
more plausible view of [Revelations] function is that it was written to awaken and intensify Christian 
exclusiveness, particularly vis--vis the imperial cult.  See also Simon R. F. Price, Rituals and 
Power: The Roman imperial cult in Asia Minor (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984; repr. 
2002), 196-198; Wengst, Pax, 118-135; Beasley-Murray, Revelation, 217; Charles, Revelation, 1:351.

issue for Johns readers was how Christians, who gave their highest loyalty to Jesus, should conduct 
themselves in a world where economic and political structures assumed that everyone would worship

Introduction 
his cult play a part in the overall story, but the story is still much larger than the 
imperial cult itself.     
Similarly, Friesen infers that the mythic depiction on the altar of Augustus in 
Miletos indicates the worship of Augustus was located within local myths,125 
which parallels his more broad conclusion, The practice of joint worship
incorporating imperial worship into the cult of another deitywas widespread.126  
Even Simon R. F. Price concludes, [The emperors] statues did not rival or displace 
those of the traditional deities.127  The imperial cult, then, plays a significant role in 
the narrative of Rome, but emperor worship is dependent on the traditional Graeco-
Roman gods and not the opposite.128  Friesen summarizes: 
The result is not a homogenous abstraction, but a reconstruction of imperial 
cults as one aspect of an evolving polytheistic system.  Imperial cults did not 
compose an independent, mythic worldview; they were a distinguishable part 
of their broader, polytheistic cultural context.  As such, they did not need to 
shoulder the whole burden for the religious life of the communities in which 
they were practiced.  Rather, the worship of the imperial families and 
125 Friesen, Imperial, 71-72.  See also Friesen, Imperial, 85-86 for a description of the 
imperial cult integration into Roman mythology in the statues in the Sebasteion at Aphrodisias. 
126 Friesen, Imperial, 75. 
127 Price, Rituals, 147.  Price, Rituals, 232 also states, As we have seen, when the emperor 
shared a sanctuary with a traditional god, he was carefully subordinated to that deity in various ways.  
Friesen, Neokoros, 74 forcefully critiques Prices emphasis on the subordination of the emperor to the 
other gods: Why would statues of the emperors be depicted so much larger than the gods?...The 
placement of the emperor in any given precinct should not be understood as a statement about the 
general status of emperors and gods.The question is not so much divine ontology as hospitality and 
protocol.  Regardless of the points of exaltation or subordination, both Friesen and Price describe the 
emperors as joining the gods and not supplanting themthat is, the imperial cult contributes to a 
message and socio-historical tableau much larger than emperor worship alone. 
128 Kraybill, Imperial, 54 even suggests that The refusal of any group to participate in 
traditional Graeco-Roman religion appeared to threaten the stability of the Empire, since impiety 
could provoke disfavor from the gods.The very fabric of society depended on continued devotion to 
the traditional gods.  Nevertheless, Friesen, Neokoros, 151-152 states, Imperial cults were 
appropriate because the emperors accomplished the work of the gods in an unparalleled manner.the 
gods looked after the emperors, who in turn looked after the concern of the gods on earth to the 
benefit of humanity. 
Introduction 
institutions constituted an identifiable feature of the larger symbolic world of 
Greco-Roman polytheism.129 
 In light of this evidence, the imperial cult emerges as a helpful but limited 
tool for imperial inquiry in Revelation.  For instance, emperor worship greatly 
illuminates the imagery in Revelation 13:11-18,130 but as Friesen observes, it is safe 
to conclude that references to imperial cults within the text of Revelation come only 
in the last half of the book, specifically in chapters 13-19.131  Asking the question, 
then, How does Revelation interact with the imperial cult? does not satisfy all of 
the imagery and contours of Revelations message.  In fact, certain passages, such as 
Revelation 20:7-10, are marginalized at best or completely ignored at worst.132  In 
other words, if the inquiries into the parallels between the book of Revelation and the 
Roman world are limited to the imperial cult alone, then we are only getting a small 
portion of the overall picture of the Roman world and the Apocalypse. 
 Thus, this dissertation examines the broader Roman context, in which the 
imperial cult participates as one part, to engage other prominent facets of Roman 
propaganda.133  A more comprehensive perspective of the Roman message offers a 
reservoir of imperial referents for the imagery of the Apocalypse that can illuminate 
texts both inside and outside of Revelation 13-19.  So, the imperial investigation is

131 Even though David E. Aune, The Influence of Roman Imperial Court Ceremonial on the 
Apocalypse of John, BR 18 (1983): 5-26 argues for imperial cult influences on Rev 4-6, Friesen 
rejects Aunes parallels [see Friesen, Imperial, 248 (n. 68); 251 (n. 12)]. 
132 Rev 20:7-10 is completely ignored in Collins, Crisis, 150, although she mentions it once 
in Collins, Combat Myth, 225-226, in which it is categorized as an instance of Combat-Victory 
without further discussion.  In Friesen, Imperial, 159-161, 188 and Kraybill, Apocalypse, 165, the 
events in Revelation 20:7-10 are retold without any additional commentary.

Introduction 
restated in its broader form: How does Revelation interact with the empire?  In 
view of the greater Roman world, this approach appreciates the specificity of 
Kraybill and Friesens work, while extending the imperial inquiry into areas of 
Revelation largely ignored134 or in need of re-examination.135 
The Alter-Imperial Paradigm: 
Empire Studies and the Book of Revelation 
 Building on the past 125 years of Revelation research, this dissertation 
constructs the Alter-Imperial paradigm in order to directly address the question, 
How does Revelation interact with the empire?136  In what follows, the theoretical 
background of the imperial inquiry is repositioned around the biblical scholarship of 
Empire Studies, which applies insights from Postcolonial Criticism and 
Examinations of Dominance to its historical analysis in order to view the text from 
the perspective of the oppressed (chapter 1).  After examining weaknesses of Empire 
Studies (chapter 2), the Alter-Imperial paradigm begins by investigating the imperial 
propaganda in the broader Roman world (chapter 3).  Then, the date of Revelations 
composition (chapter 4) is used to isolate the socio-historical analysis to the Flavian 
dynasty and address the question of persecution (chapter 5). 
 The reorganization of the theoretical background offers a fresh vantage point 
with which to view the imagery of the Apocalypse, especially in anomalous texts.  
Specifically, the Alter-Imperial paradigm is applied to the enigmatic text in 
134 See chapter 6 below. 
135 See chapter 7 below. 
136 For the particular nuances of the term paradigm (i.e., purpose, measures of success, 
etc.), see Thomas S. Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (4d ed.; Chicago: University of 
Chicago Press, 2012). 
Introduction 
Revelation 20:7-10, which depicts the release of Satan (chapter 6).137  Through 
parallels to Roman triumphal processions, Revelation 20:7-10largely neglected in 
intertextual explorations, historical inquiries, and sociological investigations
reveals that the chief enemy for Christians in Asia Minor is Satan, the bound enemy 
leader marching in Gods triumphal processionnot Rome. 
 This interpretation of Revelation 20:7-10 allows us to approach the research 
question with greater poignancy (chapter 7).  Perhaps paradoxically, the Alter-
Imperial paradigm suggests that to reduce Revelation to an anti-Roman document is 
to embrace the Satanic deception that the empire is the chief enemy in the war 
against Gods people.  This misguided elevation of Romes significance is corrected 
in the imagery and message of the Apocalypse, because to target Rome alone is to 
miss the true target.  Indeed, in Revelation Romes destruction does not end the story 
any more than Babylons defeat ended the Jewish exile.  Rome is another prostitute 
in a long line of adulterous empires used by Satan in this war against Gods 
kingdom.  To claim true victory, then, Christians in Asia Minor must direct their 
attention to the construction of the Alter-Empire by redirecting their attention to the 
true enemySatan.  Thus, the Alter-Imperial paradigm both encourages and tempers 
our exploration of the question, How does Revelation interact with the empire? 
137 On the peculiar nature of Rev 20:7-10, Friesen, Imperial, 177 comments, This is one of 
many surprises at the end of Johns narrative.  Some of Johns contemporary writers expected a 
messianic age at the end of history and before the resurrection, but none of the texts known to us has a 
second battle after that age.

Q. Are not servants bound to obey 
their masters?  A. Yes, the Bible 
exhorts servants to be obedient to their 
masters, and to please them well in all 
things  Q. If the master is 
unreasonable, may the servant disobey?  
A. No, the Bible says, Servants, be 
subject to your masters in all fear, not 
only to the good and gentle, but also to 
the forward  Q. If servants suffer 
unjustly, what are they to do?  A. They 
must bear it patiently.1 
Over the past several decades, technological advances in communication and 
transportation reduced the size of the world and enhanced cross-cultural dialog.  This 
produced significant shifts in a variety of academic disciplines.  Perhaps most 
notably, the voices of the marginalized became more audible in scholarship as a 
whole.2  Observations regarding dominance and oppression caused scholars to 
examine texts not just from the perspective of the dominant, but from the perspective 
of the dominatedimpacting sociology,3 literature,4 history,5 politics,6 general 
religious studies,7 and others.

In biblical studies, this bottom up perspective surfaced in the early 20th 
century with authors like Adolf Deissmann.8  It gained momentum in the 1970s and 
1980s with the trend of focusing textual inquiries on the people of the texts instead 
of the ideas.9  This subtle shift led to interdisciplinary projects that facilitated more

world.13  This progression offered new possibilities for marginalized voices to be 
heard from within the text and within biblical scholarship.  As other interdisciplinary 
works developed at the turn of the 21st century,14 biblical studies, primarily from 
America, witnessed an explosion of projects centered on the relationship between the 
empire and its subjects, asking: How does the biblical text interact with the 
empire?15   
Origins (New York: Crossroad, 1983); Antoinette Clark Wire, The Corinthian Women Prophets: A 
Reconstruction through Pauls Rhetoric (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1990).  The feminist interpretations, 
however, are not meant to merely deal with gender issues alone, but all forms of oppression.  As 
Elisabeth Schssler Fiorenza, Rhetoric and Ethic: The Politics of Biblical Studies (Minneapolis: 
Fortress, 1999), 5 exhorts, [Feminism] cannot just be concerned with gender inequities and gender 
marginalization but must also address other forms of domination, such as racism, poverty, religious 
exclusion, heterosexism, and colonialism, all of which are inflected by gender and inflect gender.

(2005): 75-81.  Like the feminist studies, African-American studies are not meant to merely deal with 
race issues alone, but all forms of oppression.  As Amos Jones Jr., Pauls Message of Freedom: What 
Does It Mean to the Black Church? (Valley Forge, Pa.: Judson, 1984), 38 writes, the proper 
understanding of freedom in a context of true ekklesia can be a source of liberation for those who are

15 While the reasons may vary, some scholars see the emergence of imperial inquiry in 
American biblical studies as connected to the deterioration of the separation of church and state.  As 
Richard A. Horsley, ed., Paul and Empire: Religion and Power in Roman Imperial Society 
(Harrisburg: Trinity, 1997), 1, describes, As a result of the bourgeois revolutions of the late 
eighteenth century, church and state not only became separate, but agreed not to interfere in each 
others designated jurisdictions.  Correspondingly, Christian theology and biblical studies, focused 
primarily on religious affairs, tended to lose sight of the political and economic dimensions of life 
with which the Bible is concerned.  See also Warren Carter, Proclaiming (in/against) Empire Then 
and Now, WW 25.2 (2005): 149-158; Steven J. Friesen, Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John: 
Reading Revelation in the Ruins (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), 5.  In addition, the 
Chapter 1 
This dissertation labels this growing body of scholarship Empire Studies.16  
Empire Studies utilizes an interpretative framework that centers on the investigation, 
interrogation, and reconstruction of the socio-historical context of the author(s) and 
recipient(s) of the biblical text by consistently concentrating on the relationship 
(and/or interaction) between the empire and its subjects.  To build the socio-
historical milieu, Empire Studies employs numismatics, inscriptions, mosaics, 
frescoes, temples, historical texts, myths, and any other means of examining the 
imperial message communicated to the dominated subjects.  The subject text is 
examined to identify parallels and trends of interaction to establish how the people 
under the empire engage those over them in the socio-political structure (i.e., 
resistance, acquiescence, etc.).  As a result of Empire Studies, familiar texts have 
yielded fresh interpretative possibilities. 
For example, in Mark 5:1-20, Jesus encounters a demon-possessed man in 
northeastern Palestine.  Estranged and abandoned to the tombs (5:3-5), Mark depicts 
this marginalized man pleading with Jesus for mercy (5:7).  During the dialog, Jesus 
asks for the name of the unclean spirit (5:9a) and receives a peculiar response: 
Legion is my name, for we are many (5:9b; cf. 5:15).  Empire Studies advocate 
discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in the late 1940s also contributed to the interest in imperial relations 
within subject texts.  The identification of anti-imperial elements in these texts led scholars to 
inquire about parallel sentiments in canonical texts.  In particular, the War Scroll (1QM; 4Q491-496) 
describes a great battle between the Sons of Light and the Sons of Darkness that culminates in the 
complete annihilation of the Darkness.  Some scholars suggest that the Kittim in the scroll (the army 
of Belial) refers to the Roman Imperial forces.  See George W. E. Nickelsburg, Ancient Judaism and 
Christian Origins: Diversity, Continuity, and Transformation (Minneapolis: Fortress, 2003). 
 16 Although coming to the same terminology independently, Stephen D. Moore, Empire and 
Apocalypse: Postcolonialism and the New Testament (Sheffield: Sheffield, 2006), 19 and Anathea E. 
Portier-Young, Apocalypse Against Empire: Theologies of Resistance in Early Judaism (Grand 
Rapids: Eerdmans, 2011), 223 also label this field of study as Empire Studies in passing comments.  
Throughout the rest of Moores discussion, he refers to the group as X and Empire.  
Chapter 1 
Ched Myers notes that Legion is a Latinism and that this term had only one 
meaning in Marks social world: a division of Roman soldiers.17   
The presence and destruction of a herd of pigs (5:11-13) strengthens the 
imperial connection in the text.  Warren Carter draws attention to the Roman Legion, 
stationed just north in Syria, known as the Tenth Fretensis.18  This military unit had 
an important role in the suppression of the Jewish revolt in 66-70 C.E.  Significantly, 
the Legions symbol, emblazoned on their Roman military standards, was the pig.19  
This insight renders the townspeoples request for Jesus to depart from their region 
(5:17) as not surprising but quite logical.  In addition to the possible economic 
ramifications of the herds death, the crowd may also be concerned with the possible 
political consequences since Jesus destroyed a symbol of Roman imperial 
control.20  Reading the familiar text from a bottom up perspective, then, uncovers 
socio-political layers to the imagery otherwise overlooked.

(Maryknoll: Orbis, 2006), 191.  Quoting J. Duncan M. Derrett, Contributions to the Study of the 
Gerasene Demoniac, JSNT 3 (1979): 5, Myers also points out further imperial connections through 
terms like:  (5:11),  (5:13a), and  (5:13b).

Matthew and the Margins: A Sociopolitical and Religious Reading (Maryknoll: Orbis, 2000), 212-
19 Another imperial connection to this text, thus far overlooked, is the Roman foundational 
myth of Remus and Romulus.  These twin sons of the god Mars are raised by Faustulus after he 
retrieved them from the she-wolf who rescued them from the Tiber River.  Faustulus was a swine 
herdsman for king Amulius.  As a result, the progenitors of the Roman Empire grew up to work like 
their foster-father as Amulius swine herdsmen grazing his beasts on the Palatine [T.P. Wiseman, 
Remus: A Roman Myth (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 3].

Chapter 1 
The research question How does the biblical text interact with the empire? 
persistently guides Empire Studies throughout the entire interpretative process (i.e., 
word studies, historical observations, parallel passages, etc.).21  Thus, in Revelation 
14:19, Empire Studies would not focus on the ancient procedure and action of 
acquiring juice from a first-century winepress.  Instead, the analysis would 
concentrate on the luxury of the wine, how it was acquisitioned, how the acquisition 
affected the subjects of the empire, and other analogous inquiries.22  To further 
appreciate the Empire Studies approach, the rest of this chapter examines the two 
primary influences that function as the water currents in the ocean of Empire 
Studies: Postcolonial Criticism and Examinations of Dominance. 
Empire Studies Influence #1: Postcolonial Criticism23 
 Advances in Postcolonial criticism parallel and influence the developments of 
Empire Studies.  Postcolonial criticism refers to the reading of the text offered by 
marginalized interpreters living in (or originating from) formerly colonized regions 
Keesmaat, Colossians Remixed: Subverting the Empire (Downers Grove: IVP, 2004); J.K. Riches and 
D.C. Sim, eds., The Gospel of Matthew in Its Roman Imperial Context (London: T&T Clark, 2005); 
John Dominic Crossan, God & Empire: Jesus Against Rome, Then and Now (New York: Harper, 
2007).  For a strong critique of Empire Studies, see Seyoon Kim, Christ and Caesar: The Gospel and 
the Roman Empire in the Writings of Paul and Luke (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2008). 
21  For example, Deissmann, Light, 355-373 demonstrates imperial undertones in common 
biblical grammar like: Lord, Savior, high priest, Gospel, parousia, and others.  Still further, 
Deissmann, Light, 319-334 suggests the Pauline language of slavery and ransom were familiar 
terms to his impoverished audience for the manumission of slaves bought by the gods in Roman 
society. 
 22 Moore, Empire, 18 concurs, What all [Empire Studies] share in common is a sustained 
focus on the theme of empire as an exegetical lens through which to reframe and reread selected New 
Testament texts.  See also Stephen D. Moore and Fernando F. Segovia, Postcolonial Biblical 
Criticism: Interdisciplinary Intersections (London: T&T Clark, 2005), 5-10. 
23 Moore, Empire, 7 distinguishes, Postcolonial criticism is not a method of interpretation 
(any more than is feminist criticism, say) so much as a critical sensibility acutely attuned to a specific 
range of interrelated historical and textual phenomena. 
Chapter 1 
of the world.24  This is a growing platform of formerly marginalized voices that offer 
unique perspectives on the biblical text.25  The impetus of Postcolonial thought is 
credited to the works of Edward Said, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and Homi 
Bhabha,26 which have been developed and advanced by the works of R.S. 
Sugirtharajah, Stephen D. Moore, and Fernando F. Segovia.27 
 24 At times, precise definitions for key terms in Postcolonial criticism prove elusive.  Said, 
Culture, 9 defines colonialism as the implanting of settlements on distant territory, while Moore, 
Empire, 4 (n. 4) describes the definition as minimalistic.  Even the use of the word Postcolonial 
versus Post-colonial lacks scholarly consensus.  For discussions, see Anne McClintock, The Angel 
of Progress: Pitfalls of the Term Post Colonialism, SocT 31 (1992): 84-98; Aijaz Ahmad, 
Postcolonialism: Whats in a Name?, in Late Imperial Culture (eds. Romn de la Campa, E. Ann 
Kaplan, and Michael Sprinker; London: Verso, 1995), 11-32; and Bill Ashcroft, On the Hyphen in 
Post-Colonial, NLR 32 (1996): 23-32.  While the majority of Postcolonial theorists opt for the non-
hyphenated Postcolonial [Moore, Empire, 5], some suggest abandoning the term altogether [Robert 
Young, Postcolonialism: An Historical Introduction (Oxford: Blackwell, 2001), 57, which suggests 
tricontinentalism instead].  Regarding the definition of Postcolonialism (or Postcolonial studies), 
Aijaz Ahmad, The Politics of Literary Postcoloniality, in Contemporary Postcolonial Theory: A

Chapter 1 
Postcolonial criticism addresses uneven relationships of power at the 
geopolitical level, the relationship between the imperial and the colonial.28  The 
marginalized voices,29 traditionally suppressed through the actions of colonization, 
are intentionally sought out as voices of criticism for their past and present plight.  
Postcolonial criticism liberates these voices to speak and to be heard.  This liberation 
is, in many ways, a resurrection of the marginal, the indigene and the subaltern.30 
 Nevertheless, Postcolonialism does not just offer the marginalized a platform 
to be heard; it offers them an identity to embrace.  As R.S. Sugirtharajah notes: 
Generic and pan-Asian, pan-Latin American and pan-African theologies of 
the 1960s have given way to localized-identity and issue-specific theologies.  
The result has been the emergence of feminist, Dalit, Burakumin and tribal 
theological discourses.  These theological articulations are largely attempts to 
grapple with subaltern status and to recover identity and authenticity.31 
The purpose of Postcolonial criticism, then, is to resurrect the marginalized voice and 
to liberate the suppressed identity of the dispossessed.  In biblical studies, 
Postcolonial criticism accomplishes this through Fernando F. Segovias three optics 
of interpretation: the world of the ancient text, the world of interpretations 
throughout history, and the world of modern readers.32 
28 Punt, On Articulating, 458. 
29 The definition of marginalized contains issues of gender, economics, race, and 
sexuality (see Punt, On Articulating, 457-458).  Others broaden the purview to include the disabled 
[see Rosemarie Garland Thompson, Extraordinary Bodies: Figuring Physical Disability in American 
Culture and Literature (New York: Columbia University Press, 1997)].

Chapter 1 
Optic #1: The World of the Ancient Text 
 The key question for the initial optic is, What if the problem is the text 
itself?  This suspicion of the oppressive nature of the biblical text is apparent in 
statements like, The political, economic, cultural, and religious dynamics in those 
empires between centralized authority and those without power heavily influenced 
the production of the Bible,33 or colonialism dominates and determines the 
interest of the biblical texts, and we could reasonably describe the Bible as a colonial 
document, though confessional and faith language often overlays and ignores the 
interconnecting postcolonial questions.34  This leads to a methodology that does not 
merely reconstruct the ancient text to include the marginalized voices, but 
deconstructs the document itself.   
 For example, in handling the account of the Exodus, Boyung Lee challenges 
the traditional imagery of the Exodus as a story of liberation for future generations.  
Instead, she interprets the Exodus account through the eyes of the Canaanites and 
concludes that the biblical account does not espouse hopes of liberation but a 
reverence for centralized power.35  In other words, the text does not liberate, but 
rather it perpetuates dominance through Israels appropriation of the land of 
Canaan.36  Postcolonialists engage the biblical text to resurrect marginal voices 
through primarily deconstructing the text itself.

Pedagogy, RelEd 102.1 (2007): 45.

36 Lee, Problem, 46. 
Chapter 1 
Optic #2: The World of Interpretations throughout History 
 The second optic focuses on the interpretations of the biblical text throughout 
history, particularly in the eras of colonial dominance.  This optic, like the previous, 
is saturated with suspicion given that along with gunboats, opium, slaves, and 
treaties, the Christian Bible became a defining symbol of European expansion.37  
From the Postcolonial perspective, the bibles role in colonialization (a euphemism 
for oppressive dominance) ignites a desire to not only challenge the written text 
(optic #1) but the colonial interpretations of the text used to oppress the marginalized 
(optic #2).38 
 Therefore, the second optic reinterprets the text from the perspectives and 
social contexts of the dominated.  As Sugirtharajah writes: 
[Postcolonialism] will interrogate both colonial and metropolitan 
interpretations to draw attention to the inescapable effects of colonization and 
colonial ideals on interpretative worksIt will also investigate interpretations 
that contested colonial interests and concerns. It will bring to the fore how the 
invaded, often caricatured as abused victims or grateful beneficiaries, 
transcended these images and wrested interpretation from the invaders, 
starting a process of self-discovery, appropriation and subversion.39 
Thus, the ideologically loaded Bible is liberated from the abusive trajectory 
implemented by the colonizers.40  This reinterpretation assists in the resurrection of 
the marginalized voice in order to recover the suppressed and disgraced identity. 
37 Sugirtharajah, Postcolonial Bible, 1. 
38 As M. Dube, Toward a Post-Colonial Feminist Interpretation of the Bible, Semeia 78 
(1997): 17 writes, [the biblical text] travels in the world and participates in history, continuing to 
write its story far beyond its original context and readers.

through African American Culture (Louisville: John Knox, 2005), 72. 
Chapter 1 
Optic #3: The World of Modern Readers 
 In the third optic, Postcolonial criticism uses conclusions from the first two 
optics to inform and construct the identity of the modern, marginalized reader.  The 
suspicion of the ancient text (optic #1) and the colonial interpretations throughout 
history (optic #2) positions the interpreter to address the world of the modern reader.  
This third optic is the goal of the Postcolonial interpretative process: a renewed 
identity.  As Sugirtharajah summarizes, At the same time, we embrace and 
transpose the ancient texts, and propel them to yield new meanings envisaged by the 
authors of the narratives, in order to meet our contemporary needs.41 
 The first two optics, then, unite in the final optic by wresting the text from the 
oppressive past and recontextualizing it for liberation in the present.  Gyan Prakash 
eloquently describes this Postcolonial process: 
The third world, far from being confined to its assigned space, has penetrated 
the inner sanctum of the first world in the process of being third worlded  
arousing, inciting, and affiliating with the subordinated others in the first 
world.  It has reached across boundaries and barriers to connect with the 
minority voices in the first world: socialists, radicals, feminists, minorities.42 
 In sum, Postcolonial criticism attempts to liberate the voices of the 
marginalized through the implementation of three optics of interpretative criticism.  
The Postcolonial interpreter deconstructs the ancient text (optic #1) and its 
interpretations (optic #2) in order to construct a lucid reading from the perspective of 
41 Sugirtharajah, Postcolonial Reconfigurations, 2.  The achievement of these three optics, 
from the Postcolonial perspective, is accomplished through an eclectic approach that utilizes a 
multitude of different studies, disciplines, and perspectives [see Sugirtharajah, Brief Memorandum, 
5; Kwok, Discovering, 30; Laura E. Donaldson, Postcolonialism and Biblical Reading: An 
Introduction, Semeia 75 (1996): 1-14].  This eclectic approach is seen as a weakness by Punt, On 
Articulating, 457.

the marginalized (optic #3)a perspective that contributes to the emergence of a 
liberating identity.43 
Similarities and Differences of Postcolonial Criticism and Empire Studies 
 While proponents of Empire Studies generally do not see themselves as 
offering Postcolonial interpretations,44 some Postcolonialists see Empire Studies as a 
version of Postcolonial criticism.45 The ambivalence of such categorizations is 
evident in Sze-kar Wans statement in Paul and Politics, My reading here is not 
43 A Postcolonial interpretation of the book of Revelation can be found in Moore, Empire, 
98ff.  Using the three Postcolonial optics, Moore argues that the book of Revelation perpetuates the 
imperial system of dominance that climaxed in the Constantinian Christian empire (p. 114; cf. 
Adela Yarbro Collins, Crisis & Catharsis: The Power of the Apocalypse (Philadelphia: Westminster, 
1984), 158, 171-172).  Four brief critiques are necessary to bring balance to this suggestion.  First, 
Moore avoids the theological texts like Rev 20 and builds his political interpretation from Rev 13, 
17, and 18.  While these chapters are rightly discussed, to suggest that the entire book of Revelation 
perpetuates an imperial agenda necessitates dealing with a larger sample of texts, or at least ones that 
are typically marginalized.  Second, he does not root his discussion of the sitz im leben of 
Revelation in an historical context.  Thorough discussions of the date of Revelation and the agenda of 
the Roman Empire are absent, both of which significantly impact the interpretation of Revelation.  
Third, he offers no evidence for his conclusions about the historical context of Revelation.  The only 
primary source cited is the opening quote by Eusebius, Vit. Const. 3.15, in which Constantine 
conflates the Roman Empire with Christianitywhich is anachronistic at best.  Fourth, he suggests 
that Revelation is an example of subjects longing for the position of the dominant by quoting Rev 
11:15, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ  
However, Moore ignores the context of Rev 11:15.  The kingdom of the world has become the 
kingdom of God (11:15) only after the death of the two witnesses (11:3-14), which is a depiction of 
Jesus ministry and the intended ministry of his servants (the kingdom of God).  Suffering, then, is 
how the kingdom of God overcomes the evil of the world (cf. Rev 12:11; 13:10).  No mass killing of 
their enemies occurs before this statement.  Just a depiction of the execution of Gods son saturated in 
the Old Testament imagery of the two witnesses (cf. Zech 4:1-14).  The suggestion, therefore, that 
Rev 11:15 is indicative of the overall desire to be in the position of imperial power simply ignores the 
possibility that Revelation is redefining the concepts of power, empire, ruling, and suffering 
altogether (see chapter 7 below).  To suggest that Revelation perpetuates a Christian empire in the 
mold of the Roman Empire under Constantinewhich has no historical basis beyond Moores 
imaginative construction without evidence, despite his assertion to the contrary (122)imposes a self-
referential agenda on the Apocalypse and disregards its message. 
44 Richard A. Horsley, A Response to Robert Gundrys Review of Hearing the Whole 
Story, JSNT 26 (2003): 165 states, It is puzzling that Gundry takes the book as a postcolonial 
critique of Marks story.  My combination of approaches in Hearing does not include (or even 
mention) postcolonial criticism.  Horsley even offers a critique of Postcolonialism in Richard A. 
Horsley, Subverting Disciplines: The Possibilities and Limitations of Postcolonial Theory for New 
Testament Studies, in Toward a New Heaven and a New Earth: Essays in Honor of Elisabeth 
Schssler Fiorenza (ed. Fernando F. Segovia; Maryknoll: Orbis, 2003), 90-105.

umbrella: Horsley, ed., Paul and Politics; idem, Paul and Empire; Carter, Matthew and the

strictly postcolonial, but in some aspects it does coincide with the goals of 
postcolonial studies in which ethnic integrity, self-determination, anti-colonial and 
anti-imperial concerns are all inextricably intertwined.46  The key similarities and 
differences that create this ambiguous relationship are examined below to better 
understand the influence of Postcolonial criticism on Empire Studies. 
 The primary difference is the general absence of the last two optics of 
Postcolonial interpretation in Empire Studies: the world of interpretations throughout 
history (optic #2) and the world of modern readers (optic #3).  Since the central 
element of Empire Studies is the socio-historical setting of the ancient text, the 
interpretations of the text throughout history simply rest outside of the purview of 
Empire Studies.  Similarly, the goal of the third opticto establish a new identity for 
the marginalized voices of todayrests outside of the scope of Empire Studies.  
Empire Studies does, in fact, try to resurrect the voices of the marginalized author(s) 
and recipient(s) in the biblical texts, but it is not as concerned with extending this 
pursuit to modern identities as in Postcolonialism.47 
 The primary intersection of the two studies is in the first optic: the world of 
the ancient text.  The assumptions and objectives of each approach, however, differ 
quite widely.  As Sugirtharajah exclaims, The interest of postcolonial criticism does 
46 Sze-kar Wan, Collection for the Saints as Anticolonial Act: Implications of Pauls Ethnic 
Reconstruction, in Paul and Politics (ed. Richard A. Horsley; Harrisburg: Trinity, 2000), 192 (n. 5). 
47 While this is a difference, it does not mean that the pursuit of Postcolonialism is either 
unnecessary or misguided.  Instead, Empire Studies affirms the efforts of Postcolonial interpretations 
but simply does not share the same goal.  Similarly, this dissertation does not follow the same 
modern day identity pursuit of Postcolonial interpretations.  This is not a critique of their goal, but 
simply a difference.  Nevertheless, this is not always the case in Empire Studies.  For example, in 
Horsley, In the Shadow of Empire, each article concludes with a description of how its imperial 
analysis of the biblical text impacts the modern church in the United States.  Still with marked 
differences, this focus on the modern day reader(s) resembles the third optic of Postcolonial criticism.

Chapter 1 
not lie in the truth of the text but in the central question of its promotion of colonial 
ideology.  Postcolonial biblical criticism will look for textual indicators which 
underscore colonial ideologies and investigate these texts for collusion with the 
establishment.48  Thus, Postcolonial theory views the biblical text as the source of 
the problem in the colonizerss interpretations throughout history. 
Conversely, Empire Studies is not suspicious of the document itself but 
apolitical assumptions about text.  Empire Studies demonstrates that the text has been 
de-politicized by some (whether intentionally or unintentionally), and that re-
politicizing the text clarifies the intent of the author (in light of the relationship of 
the dominant to the dominated).49  Therefore, the problem for Empire Studies is not 
the text itself but the de-politicized interpretations of the text.50 
 Notwithstanding clear differences, Postcolonial criticism and Empire Studies 
do share significant similarities.  Methodologically, both disciplines employ an 
eclectic approach to their interpretations through various disciplines, studies, 
perspectives, and criticisms.  Empire Studies uses the historical-critical methodology 
but also focuses on sociological, anthropological, and political insights to develop its 
understanding of the relationship between the sovereigns and their subjects.  
Likewise, Postcolonial criticism develops its interpretations from the insights of 
gender criticism, queer criticism, and an amalgamation of other marginalized

50 Another difference suggested by Richard A. Horsley, Submerged Biblical Histories and 
Imperial Biblical Studies, in The Postcolonial Bible (ed. R.S. Sugirtharajah; Sheffield: Sheffield, 
1998), 161, 165-166 is that Postcolonial critics reject the idea of metanarrativespresumably related 
to their postmodern philosophical underpinnings. 
Chapter 1 
perspectives.  The eclectic methodology of both approaches allows the text to be 
viewed from a perspective of multi-layered voices.  
 Both approaches to the text also share a key assumption and a key 
observation that lead to a shared goal, albeit with different emphases.  Mutually, 
Postcolonial approaches and Empire Studies assume that there are unexplored power 
struggles in any given social setting that need to be acknowledged and examined.  
Likewise, both positions observe that among many perspectives there is a false 
dichotomy: complete resistance from the subject or absolute complicity from the 
subject.  Through their different approaches, both standpoints suggest that the 
relationship of the dominated and the dominant is much more complex and conflated 
than previously asserted.   
This assumption and observation lead each discipline to a common goal: a 
search for the suppressed voice of the marginalized.51  With distinct nuances to this 
commonality, Postcolonialism (the voice of the modern day marginalized) and 
Empire Studies (the voice of the ancient marginalized) approach the text from the 
perspective of the dominated and seek to resurrect the suppressed voice(s) to 
examine how the text interacts with the dominant society.  Therefore, while the 
differences between the two approaches are sufficient enough to see each discipline 
as distinct from the other, their similarities encourage mutual influence.52 
51 Laura Salah Nasrallah, Christian Responses to Roman Art and Architecture: The Second-
Century Church Amid the Spaces of Empire (Cambridge: Cambridge Press, 2010), 9 exhorts, Such an 
analysis demands thinking beyond the elites who walked the metropolitan centers of the Roman 
Empire and taking seriously feminist and postcolonial criticisms, which ask questions about imperial 
power and its (ab)use of its subjects bodies. those, like the slaves and women we find at our texts 
margins, who also might move through civic spaces busy with marble bodies of elites as gods. 
52 Among other factors, it is difficult to consider this dissertation a Postcolonial interpretation 
of Revelation given that the viewpoint is from a white-western-male perspective.  Sakenfeld, Whose 
Text, 11 expresses this difficulty, As post-colonial feminists from among the colonized are calling

Empire Studies Influence #2: Examinations of Dominance 
 Traditionally, political revolutionsboth suppressed and successfulwere 
posited as principal evidence for the existence of any unrest against the empire.  
Thus, an unspoken assumption evolved: if no evidence of revolutions existed, then 
there was conciliatory peace from the imperial heights to the depths of the slums.53  
Recent inquiries into the arts of resistance, however, show that violence is not the 
only means of resistance practiced by subjects under sovereign dominance.54 
An often quoted Ethiopian proverb within Empire Studies is, When the great 
lord passes, the wise peasant bows deeply and silently farts.55  This interaction 
between the great lord and the wise peasant demonstrates a key area of interest 
that drives the historical inquiries of Empire Studies: the complex interaction 
between the dominant and the dominated.  How do subjects engage sovereigns?  Is it 
always complicit?  Is it always rebellious?  Is it with persistent disdain?  Is it with 
resilient loyalty?  These questions permeate the pages of Empire Studies (whether 
stated explicitly or not); the same questions are also found in the works of the 
Postcolonial harbinger Homi Bhabha and the socio-political anthropologist James C. 
Scott. 
for women like myself (and men as well) to engage their work and their approach, I as a first-world, 
white feminist can perhaps best make clear my sense of my place by describing myself as a pro-
postcolonial feminist (on the analogy of a pro-woman man entering into white feminist biblical 
interpretation).

54 As Carter, Proclaiming (in/against), 154 writes, often in peasant societies, resistance 
is expressed in more covert, self-protective, and calculated ways. These acts might include cheating 
on taxes, sabotage, go-slows, apparently inadvertent non-expressions of honor (a sneer, no greeting), 
subversive songs and stories, seizing initiative from the powerfulThese discreet acts of nonviolent, 
active resistance challenge the public and official versions of reality, secure some honor and dignity 
for the powerless, and keep alive hopes and visions of different forms of societal interaction.

The Work of Homi Bhabha 
In The Location of Culture,56 Homi Bhabha examines the interaction of the 
dominated and the dominant under a tree outside Delhi in May 1817.57  Stephen D. 
Moore describes Bhabhas distinct perspective as a predisposition to construe life 
under colonialism as characterized less by unequivocal opposition to the colonizer 
than by unequal measures of loathing and admiration, resentment and envy, rejection 
and imitation, resistance and cooption, separation and surrender.58  Bhabha observes 
a complex relationship between the colonizer and the colonized which creates an 
interaction of ambivalence characterized not by opposition but simultaneous 
retraction and expulsion.  For it is under the tree outside of Delhi that Bhabha 
observes the subjects embrace of the Bible (retraction) but with their own intended 
purposes (expulsion).  This creates a potentially subversive interaction that Bhabha 
terms sly civility.59 
 Bhabha categorizes these ambivalent interactions between the colonizer 
and the colonized as hybridity and mimicry.60  For Bhabha, hybridity is a term that 
describes the ambivalent exchange of complicity and resistance between the two 
groups in what he calls the Third Space.61  It is in this Third Space that the 
empire and its subjects interact and communicate in order to construct the society, 
56 Other scholars engaging Bhabhas work include: Nasrallah, Christian Responses, 53, 88, 
135 (n. 46); Portier-Young, Apocalypse, 63 (n. 71), 74-75.

Chapter 1 
deconstruct the society, and sometimes both at the same time.  Hybridity in the 
Third Space, then, is an interaction that is ambiguous at best, especially in light of 
the practice of mimicry.62 
 In his description of mimicry, Bhabha wrestles with the ambiguous 
representations manifested in society.63  The subjects are expected to mimic the 
culture enforced by the colonizers in the Third Space.  This forced imitation, 
however, offers the potential for the subjects to ostensibly heed the directive but also 
insert their own subtle parody of the colonizers.  As Moore summarizes, the imitation 
strategy is fraught with risk for the colonizerand replete with opportunity for the 
colonized, because such mimicry can all too easily slip over into mockery thereby 
menacing the colonizers control.64  Thus, what colonizers perceive as hegemonic 
enforcement (cultural imitation), the colonized perceive as an opportunity to assert 
their identity through mimicry in the Third Space (hybridity).  As Vclav Havel 
once stated, Society is a very mysterious animal with many faces and hidden 
potentialities, and its extremely shortsighted to believe that the face society 
happens to be presenting to you at a given moment is its only true face.  None of us 
knows all the potentialities that slumber in the spirit of the population.65 
 Bhabha presents the interpreter with a colonized world filled with interactions 
shrouded in ambiguity.  The simple categories of complicit subjects or rebellious 
subjects overlook the uncertainty in the hybridity of the Third Space; mimicry

could be interpreted as reinforcing the culture imposed by the colonizers, subverting 
the dominant society through parody, or even both simultaneously.  What Bhabha 
offers, therefore, is a world of dominance and resistance ensconced in ambivalence. 
The Work of James C. Scott66 
 In 1987, James C. Scott published Weapons of the Weak: Everyday Forms of 
Peasant Resistance.67  This book is the culmination of Scotts anthropological work 
in a small, agrarian community in Malaysia, which was impoverished by the 
introduction of new technologies and overbearing landlords that ravaged both the 
land and the community.  During his stay he noticed a distinct incongruity between 
the manner in which the peasants spoke to their superiors and the way they spoke to 
each other (behind closed doors).  Scott noticed the rich engaged in the same 
discordant practicesspeaking to the poor in one manner and then speaking to each 
other in a completely different fashion (behind closed doors).68  While the last 
chapter of Weapons of the Weak attempts to draw out some of these implications, 
Scotts later publication Domination and the Arts of Resistance: Hidden Transcripts 
extrapolates these findings.69  Beginning with the assumption that similar forms of 
66 Interchange between biblical scholars and James C. Scott is not unique to this dissertation.

etc.),70 Scott attempts to develop a model to sort out the ambivalence observed by 
Bhabha.71 
 Through an eclectic array of evidence,72 Scott examines the complexities of 
the relationships between the dominant and the dominated.  More specifically, Scott 
intends to prove the existence of subtle forms of resistance even amidst seemingly 
tranquil, complicit settings.  In light of the fact that settings of dominance deny the 
dominated the privilege of trading a slap for a slap, an insult for an insult,73 Scott 
suggests that subjects have to engage in more unique manners of resistance.  Quoting 
Ralph Ellisons Invisible Man, Scott offers an example of such an attitude of subtle 
subversion, Live with your head in the lions mouth.  I want you to overcome em 
with yeses, undermine em with grins, agree em to death and destruction, let em 
swoller you till they vomit or bust wide open. Learn it to the young uns. [sic]74   
70 Scotts conflation of such a vast array of scenarios has rightly received critique.  See David 
Field, Book Review: Domination and the Arts of Resistance: Hidden Transcripts by James C. Scott, 
AHR 99.1 (1994): 196. 
71 This is not to suggest that Bhabha and Scott rely on each other for their research.  They do 
not.  Indeed, neither refers to the other nor displays notable interaction with the others field.  
Nevertheless, their observations betray remarkable congruity. 
72 While some see this as a positive aspect of Scotts work [see Richard A. Horsley, 
IntroductionJesus, Paul, and the Arts of Resistance: Leaves from the Notebook of James C.

C. Scott, AgrH 66.1 (1992): 87 disagrees, because Scott draws from such a variety of social 
sciences, his eclecticism at times approaches methodological discordance.  Segal also points out that 
this eclectic approach has led Scott to some historical inaccuracies in Domination and the Arts of 
Resistance (p. 87).  Despite these weaknesses, Segal concludes, All this being said, this book is an 
heuristically important contribution.

Chapter 1 
Scotts examination assumes that complete hegemony (ideological 
domination) by an empire is impossible to absolutely enforce.75  Scott interprets this 
impossibility as indicative of the incongruent conversations that occur onstage and 
offstage.  Scott suggests: 
On the open stage the serfs or slaves will appear complicitous in creating an 
appearance of consent and unanimity; the show of discursive affirmations 
from below will make it seem as if ideological hegemony were secureBy a 
social alchemy that is not, after all, so mysterious, the dross of domination 
produces the public discursive affirmations that seem to transform that 
domination into the gold of willing, even enthusiastic, consent.76 
For Scott, the ambivalence of Bhabha is not due to the struggle within the subject 
between retraction and expulsion but evidence of a hidden transcript within 
the public transcript. 
 To understand Scotts contribution to the discussion of domination, it is 
imperative to define his key terms: public transcript and hidden transcript.  The 
public transcript is: 
a shorthand way of describing the open interaction between subordinates 
and those who dominatePublic here refers to action that is openly avowed 
to the other party in the power relationship, and transcript is used almost in 
its juridical sense (process verbal) of a complete record of what was said.  
This complete record, however, would also include nonspeech acts such as 
gestures and expressions.77 
Scotts description of the public transcript parallels the Third Space of Bhabha.  
Scott, however, emphasizes domination in that the public transcriptthe established 
rules of interaction between subjects and sovereignsis the common space where 
those in power enforce the self-portrait of dominant elites as they would have

Chapter 1 
themselves seen.78  In other words, the public transcript is the Third Space not 
just where the dominant and the subjects interact (hybridity), but the stage upon 
which the sovereign ideology is enforced and enacted. 
 The public transcript, then, is not concerned with the desires or opinions of 
the subjects but merely the enactment of the world as dictated by the sovereigns.  
The public transcript functions to define for subordinate groups what is realistic and 
what is not realistic and to drive certain aspirations and grievances into the realm of 
the impossible, of idle dreams.79  This is enforced in the public transcript through 
ideologically loaded symbols, which include rituals, titles, architecture, and other 
displays of power.80  In sum, the public transcript is the sociological enactment of the 
ideological world of the dominant that disallows a voice for subject discord in the 
common space.  Scott is quick to point out, however, that this does not mean that 
the subjects do not speak in the public transcript.  Since not all conversations can 
take place in the public transcript, Scott presents another term to describe the 
conversations that do not occur onstage: the hidden transcript.   
Both subordinates and sovereigns have hidden transcripts but with different 
purposes for their offstage discussions.  According to Scott, there are two key 
purposes for the dominant hidden transcript.  First, the sovereign elite must hold a 
visage of complete unity in the public transcript.  If the dominant are at odds with 
one another in any substantial way, they are, to that degree, weakened, and 
78 Scott, Domination, 18 [his emphasis]. 
79 Scott, Domination, 74. 
80 Scott, Domination, 45.  While violence is sometimes used in the public transcript to 
enforce dominance, it is commonly avoided by the sovereigns.  To resort to violence is, in some 
manner, to admit that the dominant hegemony had failed to accomplish its taskthe suppression of 
the marginalized voices into complicit obedience [Elizabeth Koepping, personal conversation (6 
November 2009)].  Nevertheless, the threat of violence was never far off. 
Chapter 1 
subordinates may be able to exploit the divisions and renegotiate the terms of 
subordination.81  The disagreements between the elites, then, are consigned to the 
hidden transcript offstage, never revealed in the Third Space.   
Second, the dominant hidden transcript attempts to conceal the futility of 
their ascendency, which allows their appearance on the public stage to reinforce their 
view of themselves and, consequently, to perpetuate the image of supremacy.  To 
illustrate this, Scott describes the dangers of the dominant hidden transcript surfacing 
in the public transcript, In Genets The Screens, set in Algeria, the Arab farm 
laborers kill their European overseer when his Arab maid discovers that he has used 
padding on his stomach and buttocks to make an imposing appearance.  Once he is 
reduced to ordinary proportions, they are no longer intimidated.82  Thus, the 
dominant hidden transcriptwhether used to disseminate the perception of unity or 
the appearance of supremacyfunctions to conceal any discordance between the 
dominant ideology found in the public transcript and the porous reality. 
The subject hidden transcript, like the dominant, consists of conversations 
and practices that occur offstage, but the primary difference, according to Scott, is 
that the subject hidden transcript exists to contradict the public transcript and not 
reinforce it.83  The production of the subject hidden transcript includes three key 
elements.  First, a social space for the contradictory opinions to be voiced must 
81 Scott, Domination, 56. 
82 Scott, Domination, 50. 
83 Scott, Domination, 4.  Although they are not privy to its complete contents (most of the 
time), the dominant are suspicious of the existence of the subject hidden transcript.  Noting that her 
slaves fell uncharacteristically silent whenever the latest news from the front in the Civil War became 
a topic of white conversation, Mary Chesnut took their silence as one that hid something.  They go 
about in their black masks, not a ripple of emotion showing; and yet on all other subjects except the 
war they are the most excitable of all races.  Now Dick might be a very respectable Egyptian Sphynx, 
so inscrutably silent he is [Scott, Domination, 3 quoting from Orlando Patterson, Slavery and Social 
Death: A Comparative Study, 208]. 
Chapter 1 
exist.  This location provides a platform for the full-throated expression of the 
muted riposte, stifled anger, and bitten tongues forced on the subordinates in the 
public transcript.84  Second, the hidden transcript requires human agents to mature 
the seeds of angst into a subversive message which is then circulated in the subject 
community.85  Finally, the hidden transcript necessitates what Scott calls 
infrapolitics in which the subject leaders manage and enforce the message amongst 
the subjects.86 
Once the subject hidden transcript is generated, Scott asks the question, How 
is this hidden transcript communicated in the public transcript?87  With different 
nuances and purposes, Scott offers two paths of communication for the subject 
hidden transcript in the public transcript: explicit revelation and implicit revelation. 
Explicit revelation of the subject hidden transcript in the public transcript 
occurs in two manifestations.  The first attempts to protect anonymity by keeping a 
safe distance from the sovereign in the public transcript.  Quoting events from 
84 Scott, Domination, 120.  Insightfully, Arlene Elowe MacLeod, Book Review: Domination 
and the Arts of Resistance: Hidden Transcripts by James C. Scott, Signs 18.3 (1993): 690 asks, 
What kinds of resistances might emerge, for instance, in situations where separate spheres are not the 
rule and women have little space to create a world of backstage behavior?  Scott never addresses 
this issue. 
85 Scott, Domination, 123-124. 
86 Scott, Domination, 183ff. 
87 This question, however, skips another question which should precede it, Do the subjects 
desire for their hidden transcript to surface in the public transcript?  In reference to the African-
American slave tale Brer Rabbit, Scott, Domination, 164 regards it as a subversive hidden transcript 
and emphatically states, It is customary to treat oral traditions like the Brer Rabbit tales as 
communication among slaves and then to gauge their role in the socialization of a spirit of resistance.  
What this ignores is the publicness of the Brer Rabbit stories.  They were not told just offstage in the 
slave quarters.  The place of such tales as part of the public transcript suggests a line of interpretation.  
It suggests that, for any subordinate group, there is tremendous desire and will to express publicly 
what is in the hidden transcript, even if that form of expression must use metaphors and allusions in 
the interest of safety.  This assumption is tenuous at best.  Many subjects avoid any potential 
confrontation in the public transcript (including their hidden transcript) due to the clear consequences 
of such insubordination.  For a similar critique, see Portier-Young, Apocalypse, 36-37. 
Chapter 1 
George Orwell, as an English colonizer in Burma in the 1920s, Scott refers to this 
type of explicit revelation: 
Anti-European feeling was very bitter.  No one had the guts to raise a riot, but 
if a European woman went through the bazaars alone somebody would 
probably spit betel juice over her dressWhen a nimble Burman tripped me 
up on the football field and the referee (another Burman) looked the other 
way, the crowd yelled with hideous laughterIn the end the sneering yellow 
faces of the young men that met me everywhere, the insults hooted after me 
when I was at a safe distance, got badly on my nerves.  The young Buddhist 
priests were the worst of all.88 
Orwells description reveals the blatant manner in which the hidden transcript of the 
Burmese subjects was made known in the public transcript.  However, it was done 
from a safe distance to preserve anonymity, thereby avoiding direct repercussions. 
 The second type of explicit revelation is open rebellion.  Often times, the 
historically documented moments of revolts or revolutions are the only evidence 
acknowledged by historians that the subjects of a dominant regime are disgruntled by 
their current plight.  What Scott suggests, however, is that the open rebellions are 
never spontaneous, but instead, they point to the existence of a hidden transcript now 
been revealed in the public transcript.  Scott writes:  
I believe that the notion of a hidden transcript helps us understand those rare 
moments of political electricity when, often for the first time in memory, the 
hidden transcript is spoken directly and publicly in the teeth of powerWhat 
is rare, then, is not the negation of domination in thought but rather the 
occasions on which subordinate groups have been able to act openly and fully 
on that thought.89 
88 Scott, Domination, 14, quoting George Orwell, Inside the Whale and Other Essays 
(Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1962), 91. 
89 Scott, Domination, xiii, 102.  Scott does not adequately elaborate on the connection 
between hidden transcripts and violent revolutionsonly allowing the conversation a small portion in 
the last chapter of the book.  Timothy J. Lukes, Book Review: Domination and the Arts of 
Resistance: Hidden Transcripts by James C. Scott, APSR 85.4 (1991): 1454 concurs, More 
troubling, though, is Scotts slapdash attempt to link the hidden transcripts to extemporaneous 
insubordination and finally to overt political rebellion.  With no more than seven pages to go in the 
book, he admits, What we have yet to explain is how an initial act of defiance that may originate in 
bravado, anger, or gestures can occasionally bring on an avalanche of defiance (p. 220).  Needless to 
Chapter 1 
Scott considers the presence of blatant manifestations of resistance in the public 
transcript (both at a safe distance and open rebellion) as evidence of a hidden 
transcript developed and rehearsed in the social space of the subordinates. 
 Second, the subjects hidden transcript surfaces in implicit ways in the public 
transcript.  This section of the analysis is what dominates Scotts study as he looks at 
rumors, gossip, folktales, songs, gestures, jokes, and theater of the powerless as 
vehicles by which, among other things, they insinuate a critique of power while 
hiding behind anonymity or behind innocuous understandings of their conduct.90  In 
other words, all interactions between the subjects and the sovereigns in the public 
transcript, potentially reveal the hidden transcript of the subordinates, especially acts 
of deference. 
 When complicity is demonstrated in the public transcript, Scott assumes that 
the subordinate groups, schooled in the art of disguising their true emotions and 
motives, are actually communicating disdain through parody, mimicry (cf. Bhabha), 
or some other form of subversive act.  Scott states, What may look from above like 
the extraction of a required performance can easily look from below like the artful 
manipulation of deference and flattery to achieve its own ends.91  To state it 
differently, the subject hidden transcript persistently lingers below the surface of the 
public transcript and emerges not just in acts of rebellion but also in acts of complicit 
deference. 
say, the discussion that follows is hardly satisfying, made more problematic by its romanticization of 
defiance. 
90 Scott, Domination, xiii. 
91 Scott, Domination, 34. 
Chapter 1 
 The purpose of the implicit revelation in the public transcript is for the 
subject to regain dignity and establish an identityboth of which were wrested from 
them by the dominant.  In a powerful depiction, Scott purports: 
We know relatively little about a Malay villager if we know only that he is 
poor and landless.  We know far more about the cultural meaning of his 
poverty once we know that he is particularly in despair because he cannot 
afford to feed guests on the feast of Ramadan, that wealthy people pass him 
on the village path without uttering a greeting, that he cannot bury his parents 
properly, that his daughter will marry late if at all because he lacks a dowry, 
that his sons will leave the household early since he has no property to hold 
them, and that he must humble himselfoften to no availto beg for work 
and rice from wealthier neighbors.  To know the cultural meaning of his 
poverty in this way is to learn the shape of his indignity and, hence, to gauge 
the content of his anger.  Dignity is at once a very private and a very public 
attribute.92 
The effects of dominance go far beyond the appropriation of land or goods, but 
rather, dominance defines the worth and identity of individuals involved in the 
hegemonic system, whether voluntarily or involuntarily.93  The moments of implicit 
revelation of the hidden transcript allow the subject to reclaim some of that dignity 
and identity ostensibly allocated by the sovereign force. 
Comparing Homi Bhabha and James C. Scott 
 The examinations of dominance by Homi Bhabha and James C. Scott 
intersect and bifurcate in multiple areas, but two key points of convergence issue a 
strong challenge to historians.  First, Bhabha and Scott both point out there is 
92 Scott, Domination, 113. 
93 Scott, Domination, 3 makes this untenable claim regarding domination, the greater the 
disparity in power between dominant and subordinate and the more arbitrarily it is exercised, the more 
the public transcript of subordinates will take on a stereotyped, ritualistic cast.  In other words, the 
more menacing the power, the thicker the mask.  It is also possible that instead of the mask 
becoming thicker, there may be a level of acceptance by the subjects as dominated.  Without 
recourse to hopeful rebellion, the subjects may come to a point in which their identity and hope are 
completely absorbed into the hegemony of the elite.  To state, then, that a hidden transcript must still 
exist but it is just harder to find is simply to deny the range of possibilities for human reaction to 
extreme accounts of dominance. 
Chapter 1 
something deeper than meets the proverbial eye in power relations.  Colonial and 
imperially-dominated settings are riddled with intricate webs of domination, 
resistance, and acquiescence, particularly in the public forum (the Third Space or 
Public Transcript).  This complexity shatters the false assumption that when torrent 
rebellion is not visible then everyone is satisfied with the current situation of power 
relations.   
 Such an observation leads to the second point of intersection between Bhabha 
and Scott: other forms of resistance, outside of open rebellion, exist and are 
implemented on a daily basis.  While Bhabha refers to these more subtle subversions 
in his description of mimicry, Scott labels these acts as the subject hidden transcript.  
Both terms, however, point to a complex interchange of ideological discord between 
the subjects and the sovereigns, a complexity which suggests that even acts of 
deference may be forms of sedition.   
 These two points of convergence for Bhabha and Scott strongly caution the 
historian not to take the accounts, predominately written by the dominant, at face 
value, because the voices of the subjects are intentionally suppressed so as not to be 
heard.94  So Scott writes, It is in precisely this public domain where the effects of 
94 This statement does not insinuate that historians have been guilty of uncritical examination 
of historical documentsfor historians have both accepted and been skeptical of historical documents 
for centuries.  Nevertheless, historians have, at times, embraced the false dichotomy challenged by 
Bhabha and Scott that when there is no rebellion in the historical document then all is well in the 
empire.  For example, Lawrence Waddy, in his book Pax Romana and World Peace (New York: 
W.W. Norton & Company, 1950), explains in blissful terms the life of a slave under the sovereignty 
of the Romans and then concludes, the lot of these slaves cannot have been very miserable, 
because the individual Roman was not by nature a cruel master (p. 190).  Elsewhere, he describes the 
subjugation of Britain and subsequent permeation of Roman culture in terms that strongly support the 
Roman actions and even suggests the Britons were, on some level, grateful: To call Romanization 
slavery is perverse.  Admittedly the material benefits of Roman rule were badly shared out among 
the Britons; but nobody could seriously maintain that Britain could have been better off or more free 
outside the Roman Commonwealth in the days of the Pax Romana I do not picture [the Briton] as a 
down-trodden slave of Rome, but as a reasonably happy British workman, freed at least from the 
necessity of taking part in the old tribal wars of pre-Roman days (pp. 156-157, 158).  After a 
Chapter 1 
power relations are most manifest, and any analysis based exclusively on the public 
transcript is likely to conclude that subordinate groups endorse the terms of their 
subordination and are willing, even enthusiastic, partners in that subordination.95   
Conclusion 
 Empire Studies investigates subject texts for interactions with the dominant 
imperial message.  That is, Empire Studies attempts to answer the question, How 
does the biblical text interact with the empire?  The influences of Postcolonial 
Criticism and Examinations of Dominance posture the investigation to view history 
from the complex and multi-faceted perspective of the dominated.  As seen above, 
familiar texts are offered fresh interpretative possibilities from this imperial re-
contextualization in Empire Studies. 
 With similar trajectories, the Alter-Imperial paradigm engages the 
Apocalypse as a subject text by asking the question, How does Revelation interact 
with the empire?  While the advances in Empire Studies are promising for 
Revelation scholarship, significant methodological weaknesses suggest the need for 
further development.  
description of the persecution of Christians under Nero and Domitian, Waddy awkwardly concludes, 
The quality of life among the early Christians, under the rule of what the Revelation calls the scarlet 
coloured beast, was very wonderful indeed (p. 225).  This attitude is challenged by Bhabha and 
Scott.  As Krister Stendahl, The Bible as Classic and Holy Scripture, JBL 103.1 (1984): 3 
challenges, Could it be that preoccupation with history comes natural when one is part of a culture 
which feels happy and hopeful about the historical process? 
95 Scott, Domination, 4.  The subject voices are not readily apparent in historical texts due to 
three key factors.  First, history is predominately written by the elitesin that history adds to and 
takes away from the public transcript.  Second, the non-elites intentionally disguise their voices, 
especially when dissonant, so as not to be heard clearly, if at all.  Third, the elites may intentionally 
choose not to record or report any discovered elements of subversion.  The presence of such 
subversion reflects poorly on the ruling hegemony and could possibly invite other rebellious acts 
(Scott, Domination, 89).  Because of these factors, Scott, Domination, 89 suggests, Someone 
examining the newspapers, speeches, and public documents of the period a few decades hence would 
find little or no trace of this conflict.  Field, Book Review, 196 adds, The problem, perhaps, is not 
so much that the transcript of the subordinate is hidden as that it is cacophonous.  See also

Chapter 2: 
Empire Studies and the Alter-Imperial Paradigm 
The complex interactions between subjects and sovereigns demand rigorous 
investigations into the imperial world.  Influenced by Postcolonial criticism and 
examinations of dominance, Empire Studies has emerged as a poignant interpretive 
lens offering fresh insights on ancient texts.  Nevertheless, examinations of Empire 
Studies in Jesus, Paul, and Revelation reveal three methodological weaknesses: [1] 
anti-imperial assumptions, [2] textual assertions, and [3] historical-contextual 
ambiguity.  This chapter examines these methodological pitfalls and offers a way 
forward through an Alter-Imperial paradigm that builds upon the works of Homi 
Bhabha and James C. Scott. 
Methodological Weakness #1: Anti-Imperial Assumptions 
 At times, Empire Studies interpreters are called anti-imperial interpreters.1  
While this name may be unfair for some, for other leading Empire Studies 
proponents, this title describes their initial assumption quite accurately.  For whether 
the study focuses on Jesus, Paul, or elsewhere, the general trajectory of Empire 
Studies has been to look for anti-imperial elements under every exegetical rock 
and ignore any complicit tendencies of the documents altogether.   
For example, Richard Horsley, a leading voice in Empire Studies, describes 
Jesus mission and purpose as a product of his cultural milieu,2 in which, Jesus was

Paul and Luke (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2008), chapter 2 (p. 11), Anti-Imperial Interpretation of 
Other Pauline Epistles or chapter 4 (p. 34), Factors that Make an Anti-Imperial Interpretation 
Difficult.

Movements in the Time of Jesus (San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1985; repr., Harrisburg: Trinity, 
2000). 
Chapter 2 
proclaiming that God was in the process of effecting the political revolution that 
would overthrow the Roman imperial order in Palestine.3  This anti-imperial 
trajectory is proved, then, through exegetical assertions that seem, at times, quite 
forced. 
 For instance, in Jesus and Empire, Horsley gives an interpretation of the two 
women in Mark 5:21-43 that are in need of Jesus healing: the woman who had 
been hemorrhaging for twelve years and the nearly dead twelve-year-old girl.4  
After connecting the two women symbolically to the people of Israel, Horsley 
proposes an anti-imperial conclusion to the account that, for him, characterizes 
other healing accounts as well: 
The original hearers of the Gospel would have known tacitly and 
implicitlythat both the individual and the social hemorrhaging and near 
death were the effects of the peoples subjection to imperial forces.  Thus as 
the womans faith that special powers are working through Jesus, leading her 
to take the initiative in touching his garment, results in her healing, so also 
the peoples trust that Gods restorative powers are working through Jesus is 
leading to their recovery from the death-dealing domination by Roman 
imperial rule.  When Jesus brings the seemingly dead twelve-year-old girl 
back to life just at the time she has come of age to produce children, he is 
mediating new life to Israel in general.  In these and other episodes Jesus is 
healing the illnesses brought on by Roman imperialism.5 
Similarly, the anti-imperial bias guides Horsley in events like the Beelzebub 
controversy (Mk 3:22-28) and Jesus proclamation of Let the little children come to 
me (Mk 10:13-16) to suggest that the events are a declaration of the judgment of the 
rulers of Rome due to the mere mention of the phrase the kingdom of God.6

Chapter 2 
These forced anti-imperial interpretations are also found in Horsleys 
exegesis of Jesus exorcism accounts.  Under the heading Roman Imperialism 
Implicated in Jesus Exorcisms,7 Horsley suggests that in Mark 1:25 the use of 
vanquishes (epitiman) instead of cast out (ekballein) carries an anti-Roman 
message to the exorcism.  With only one citation as evidence (1QM 14.9-11), 
Horsley suggests that vanquishes (epitiman) was used with reference to 
Yahweh/God coming in judgment against foreign imperial regimes who had 
subjected Israel.8  This minor shift in Mark 1:25 leads Horsley to this anti-
imperial conclusion of Jesus exorcism ministry: 
The unclean spirit (Mark 2:24) [sicit is actually Mark 1:24] indicates 
precisely what is happening: Have you come to destroy us?  Note the plural 
us.  The unclean spirit knows who Jesus is and what he is doing: Jesus is 
Gods agent whose kingdom of God program of vanquishing demons is 
bringing defeat to all the demonic forces[Jesus followers] understood and 
declared that the ultimate significance of Jesus exorcisms was the defeat of 
Roman rule.9 
For Horsley, the approach of Empire Studies is equivalent to anti-Roman, which 
leads to forced exegesis and conclusions in regard to the events and intent of Jesus 
ministry.  The same is true of Horsleys interaction with texts in the Pauline corpus.  
He transforms 1 Corinthians into a document that promotes a rejection of the Roman 
imperial patronage and economic systems10 as a part of Pauls goal to create an

Society, in Paul and Empire: Religion and Power in Roman Imperial Society (ed. Richard A. 
Horsley; Harrisburg: Trinity, 1997), 242-252.  Regarding Pauls plea in 1 Corinthians against the 
patronage of Christians between him and Apollos, Horsley suggests that Paul may have been 
[concerned] to prevent the assemblyfrom replicating the controlling and exploitative power 
relations of the dominant society (p. 250), and therefore uses his overall controlling vision of the 
kingdom of God as a basis for rejecting the patronage system (pp. 250-251).  Kim, Christ and 
Caesar, 25-26 points out the oddity of this anti-imperial conclusion, In the face of the evidence in 
1 Corinthians and elsewhere that Paul apparently enjoyed the patronage of Crispus, Gaius, Stephanas, 
Chapter 2 
anti-imperial alternative society.11 
 The anti-imperial fixation among Horsley and other Empire Studies 
advocates obscures the interpretative options for a subject text when complicity is 
not entertained as an option.  For some, then, the pursuit of Empire Studies has 
evolved from the question, How does the biblical text interact with the Empire? 
into How does the biblical text subvert the Empire?  As a result, it is assumed that 
the biblical text intends to subvert the dominant society by hitting a straight lick 
with a crooked stick,12 a shift which leads to forced exegesis, awkward conclusions, 
and obscured assumptions.13   
 Uniquely, Empire Studies advocates and its opponents assume that 
Revelation is the quintessential example of anti-imperial rhetoric.14  This 
Phoebe, Prisca and Aquila, and others for his mission in and around Corinth (1 Cor 1:14-16; 16:15-18; 
Rom 16:1-2; cf. also 2 Cor 11:9; Phil 1:5-7; 4:10-20; 1 Thess 5:12-13; Phlm), it is difficult to know 
how Horsley can argue that Paul tried to repudiate the patronage system of the Roman Empire.  
Similarly, Horsley, 1 Corinthians, 251 finds anti-imperial elements in Pauls instructions about 
collecting money in 1 Cor 16:1-4, Pauls instructions about the collection in 1 Cor. 16:1-4 (and 2 
Corinthians 8; 9) indicate that the network of assemblies had an international political-economic 
dimension diametrically opposed to the tributary political economy of the empire.

13 Thus, Neil Elliott wrestles with Romans 13 from the anti-imperial perspective, which he 
says appears a foreign body in the Pauline corpus due to its positive characterization of the 
governing authorities.  He then retorts, Within the rhetorical structure of Romans, however, these 
remarks [Romans 13:1-7] have an important function: to encourage submission, for now, to the 
authorities, rather than desperate resistance [Neil Elliott, Romans 13:1-7 in the Context of 
Imperial Propaganda, in Paul and Empire: Religion and Power in Roman Imperial Society (ed. 
Richard A. Horsley; Harrisburg: Trinity, 1997), 203 (emphasis added)].  This is not to say that anti-
imperial elements do not exist in Romans 13, but instead, it is simply to point out that when 
confronted with the possibility of complicity the option is readily dismissed.  Conversely, Kim, Christ 
and Caesar, 42-43 suggests an equally forced conclusion, From Rom 13:1-7 it is clear that Paul 
preferred the Roman order and justice, in spite of all their imperfection, to chaos and anarchy.  Kim 
suffers, then, from a similar fixation, in that, he cannot envision anything other than complicity.  
Anti-imperial elements are simply not an option. 
14 Klaus Wengst, Pax Romana and the Peace of Jesus Christ (trans. John Bowden; 
Philadelphia: Fortress, 1987), 132, [Revelation] is underground literature; it speaks in code.The 
Chapter 2 
assumption predisposes interpreters to view the Apocalypse as a book intent on the 
destruction of the Roman Empire through persistent challenges to the imperial 
claims of dominance, divine benefaction, and worldwide peace.  This is not to 
suggest that this assumption is completely false, but rather, like the Empire Studies 
of Jesus and Paul described above, the eradication of the option of complicity opens 
interpreters up to significant exegetical pitfalls.  In particular, through this anti-
imperial perspective, the goal of the book of Revelation becomes solely the 
destruction of the Roman Empire.15 
An Alter-Imperial Response to Anti-Imperial Assumptions 
This anti-imperial approach limits the interpretative possibilities of the 
biblical text in that if the options do not appear anti-Roman then the passages are 
either ignored or forced into anti-imperial conclusions regardless of the intent.  An 
anti-imperial perspective immediately positions the conversation as one of 
rebellion and resistance even when the text may not address the empire at all.16  
Ironically, then, the pursuit to resurrect the marginalized voice in the text through an 
anti-imperial slant actually marginalizes the voice of the text in that only anti-
encipherment isa very clear and eloquent symbolization with which John snatches the masks off the 
lofty claims of Rome and shows its murderous aspect.  Similarly, Kim, Christ and Caesar, 21 (a 
strong opponent to Empire Studies) writes, One has also to marvel that Paul was even more skillful 
in hiding (or expressing) his anti-imperial message in protective codes than the author of Revelation, 
who has carelessly left so many clues for cracking his codes.  Or was Paul more afraid than the author 
of Revelation, so that he devised a more inscrutable code?  See also Kim, Christ and Caesar, 34, 53; 
Horsley, General, 2.

Chapter 2 
imperial interpretations are tolerated.     
While anti-imperial elements may exist within a document, it is 
irresponsible to conclude that the entire documents purpose is to deconstruct the 
empire (i.e., an anti-imperial document)especially if complicit elements are 
found in the document.  For example, Revelation consistently affirms the propaganda 
that the Roman Empire ruled the entire world17 (Rev 6:4, 15; 11:15; 13:2-3, 7-8, 12; 
17:2, 5, 9, 18; 18:3, 24), but at the same time, Revelation denies Romes claim that 
they are empowered by the gods of the Roman pantheon.18  Rather, Romes power 
and dominance, in the Apocalypse, flow from the dragon and his two beasts (Rev 
12:9, 12, 17; 13:1-2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12; 17:3, 9) who are under the sovereignty of the one 
on the throne and the slain lamb (Rev 1:5a, 8; 4:8; 12:9b, 10-11, 13; 17:14, 16-17).19   
In this example, while anti-imperial elements are evidentin that Rome 
would not agree nor appreciate the redefinition of their source of powerthe 
purpose of this depiction is to articulate the Alter-Imperial perspective that the 
sovereignty of God works through the domination of Rome to bring about his 
purposes, which is both complicit and resistant to the empire.20  Therefore, anti-
17 See chapter 3 below (pp. 94-104) for a discussion of Romes message that: The Roman 
Empire is the ruler of the kings of the earth. 
18 See chapter 3 below (pp. 104-109) for a discussion of Romes message that: The Roman 
Empire is favored by the gods. 
19 In Revelation, the sovereignty of God and the Lamb surfaces throughout.  For example, the 
rhetorical formula in Rev 4:5 (From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of 
thunder) appears at the end of each set of judgments, with minor modifications, to remind the reader 
of the sovereign source: God seated on his throne (N.B.: The seals [8:5] add an earthquake, the 
trumpets [11:19] add a great hailstorm, and the bowls [16:18-21] elaborate on both of the previous 
emendations).  Similarly, the Lambs sovereignty over the earth is depicted in the seals.  It is the 
Lamb who has the authority to break the seals (Rev 5:9-10) that result in the four horsemen and the 
judgments that follow (Rev 6:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12; 8:1; cf. ComeRev 6:2, 3b, 5, 7; see also Rev 6:6).  
For more, see Chapter 7 below. 
20 In Revelation, Christians are depicted as victorious not when they overthrow or destroy 
Rome, but when they submit to death at the hands of Romelike Jesus (see Rev 6:10-11; 12:11; 
13:10; 14:13; 20:4-6; cf. Rev 11:3-12).  For more, see chapter 7 below. 
Chapter 2 
imperial elements do not demand a purely destructive intent.   
As Homi Bhabha suggests, the ambivalent relationship between the subjects 
and the sovereigns of an empire must be respected and not reduced to the simplistic 
categories of rebellion or acquiescence.  While some Empire Studies advocates begin 
their methodology with an anti-imperial assumption,21 this dissertation approaches 
the book of Revelation through the Alter-Imperial paradigm that allows resistance, 
complicity, both, or neither.  Thus, the research question is not, How does 
Revelation subvert the Empire? but, How does Revelation interact with the 
Empire? 
Methodological Weakness #2: Textual Assertions 
 In addition to an anti-imperial assumption, the methodological approach of 
Empire Studies suffers, at times, from textual assertions and historical-contextual 
ambiguity.  To demonstrate these final two methodological weaknesses, two imperial 
inquiries into the book of Revelation are examined: John Hurtgens Anti-Language in 
the Apocalypse of John and Wes Howard-Brook and Anthony Gwythers Unveiling 
Empire: Reading Revelation Then and Now. 
 Through socio-rhetorical models developed by Bruce Malina and others,22 
21 Richard A. Horsley, IntroductionJesus, Paul, and the Arts of Resistance: Leaves from 
the Notebook of James C. Scott, in Hidden Transcripts and the Arts of Resistance: Applying the 
Work of James C. Scott to Jesus and Paul (ed. Richard A. Horsley; SemeiaSt 48; Atlanta: Society of 
Biblical Literature, 2004), 9.  Using Horsley as a metonymy for the Empire Studies group as a whole, 
Stephen D. Moore, Empire and Apocalypse: Postcolonialism and the New Testament (Sheffield: 
Sheffield, 2006), 13 states, the biblical text is read as unequivocal and exemplary anti-imperial and 
anti-colonial resistance literature. 
22 John E. Hurtgen, Anti-Language in the Apocalypse of John (Lewiston, N.Y.: Mellen 
Biblical, 1993) begins with a description of the socio-rhetorical model (chs. 1-3) followed by the 
implementation of the model on Rev 11:19-15:4 as a case study (ch. 4).  Hurtgen, however, relies too 
heavily on Malinas work throughout.  While it is understandable to depend on Malina for the 
kitbash methodology (developed from Mary Douglass group and grid model and Hayden 
Whites metahistorical model, used in Bruce J. Malina, The Gospel of John in Sociolinguistic 
Chapter 2 
Hurtgens work intends to analyze the language of the Apocalypse as an anti-
language, that is, a language that is antithetical to the norm society.23  Similarly, 
Howard-Brook and Gwythers work focuses on the interaction with imperial society, 
although they rely on historical analysis instead of socio-rhetorical models.24  Both 
books, however, suffer from textual assertions that include, but are not limited to, [1] 
parallels without analysis and [2] biased sample selections. 
Perspective [Berkley, Cali.: Center for Hermeneutical Studies, 1985]), Hurtgen does not directly 
engage Douglas and Hayden, but instead, allows Malina to define and describe the model, key terms, 
starting points, and conclusions without critical engagement with the model or the primary sources 
himself.  See Hurtgen, 4, 9, 17, 18, 19, 28 (n. 44), 39, 52, 55. 
23 Hurtgen, 4-5. 
24 Wes Howard-Brook and Anthony Gwyther, Unveiling Empire: Reading Revelation Then 
and Now (Mary Knoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 2003), xxiv begin with a call for an anti-imperial approach to 
the book of Revelation.  The book proceeds through interaction with apocalyptic literature (ch. 2), 
historical context (ch. 3), the bifurcation of space and time (ch. 4), non-violence in the text (ch. 5), 
contrasts between Babylon and the New Jerusalem (ch. 6) and between imperial and Christian 
worship (ch. 7), imperial myths (ch. 8), and a description of global capitalism as the modern-day 
imperial threat (ch. 9).  Howard-Brook and Gwyther, however, allow their imperial analysis to 
become distracted by their non-violent agenda throughout the book.  In the introduction, the section 
entitled Purpose of this Book concludes with this statement, Our reading of Revelation flows out of 
and deepens this commitment to nonviolent public witness as part of the task of faithful discipleship 
(p. xxi).  This non-violent agenda, then, usurps the discussion of apocalyptic literature in chapter 2 and 
transforms it into a comparison between the violent tendency of 1 Maccabees and the non-violent call 
in the book of Daniel (pp. 47-53).  This non-violent trajectory climaxes in chapter 5 (entitled: 
Revelations Language of Violence and the Practice of a Discipleship of Nonviolence), which 
contains the largest concentration of textual analysis on the Apocalypse.  The two scrolls in 
Revelation 5 and 10 are contrasted, in that, according to Howard-Brook and Gwyther, the scroll of 
Revelation 5 presents a set of violent plagues (the seals and the trumpets) that fail to bring about 
repentance from rebellious humanity (Rev 9:20-21) while the scroll of Rev 10 offers two witnesses 
(Rev 11) that sacrifice their own bodies and receive Gods vindication.  From this contrived 
comparison (which ignores the relationship between the trumpets and bowls, the violence done to 
Christians in the seals [6:9-11], the fact that the seventh trumpet does not sound until after the two 
witnesses [11:15], and the concluding imagery of all three sets of plagues [8:4; 11:19; 16:18] that 
point back to the one on the throne in heaven [4:5] as the origin of all of the plagues), Howard-Brook 
and Gwyther conclude, [John] came to a startling but powerful understanding: the death and 
resurrection of Jesus the Lamb revealed a change in God's planIn place of threats of violence, God 
would lead people to a change of heart by sending prophetsso filled with the Word of God that they 
would be willing to be killed rather than to refrain from witnessing publicly to that Word (p. 150, 
emphasis theirs).  Howard-Brook and Gwyther not only allow the non-violent agenda to cloud their 
exegesis, but they do not show how this non-violent approach to Revelation interacts with the 
agenda of Rome.  That is, the kingdom of God (non-violence) does not progress in the same manner 
as the Roman Empire (violence) [so Mark Bredin, Jesus, Revolutionary of Peace: A Nonviolent 
Christology in the Book of Revelation (Waynesboro, Ga.: Paternoster, 2004)].  This historical 
comparison, however, is ignored in favor of the theological perspective of non-violence in 
Revelation.  This is not to suggest that Revelation does not have a non-violent message to the reader 
(see chapter 7 below), only that the non-violent agenda of Howard-Brook and Gwyther distracts from 
their broad imperial analysis. 
Chapter 2 
Textual Assertions: Parallels without Analysis 
A traditional pitfall of intertextual analysis is to place two texts side-by-side, 
observe a potential influence from one text to another, and then fail to discuss the 
implications of such an influence.  For instance, Howard-Brook and Gwyther ask the 
question, What texts influence Revelations imagery? (i.e., Old Testament, Non-
Canonical, or Roman texts) but they fail to ask analysis questions like, What events 
caused the author of Revelation to be influenced by these specific texts? or Why 
did the author of Revelation choose these voices to speak to his people? or What 
kind of imperial interaction does this parallel indicate? 
So in chapter seven, Howard-Brook and Gwyther present Roman liturgy and 
worship connections to Revelation without discussion.25  A comparison, for example, 
between the four living creatures of Revelation 4 and the four zodiacal creatures is 
offered as a possible parallel (that is loose at best),26 but there is no analysis of the 
importance of such a parallel.  The authors ignore important questions, such as: 
What is the significance of the four zodiacal creatures in the Roman Empire?  What 
does the parallel indicate?  Rebellion?  Complicity?  Both?  Neither? Instead, the 
parallel is suggested without analysis, and therefore, offers little more than an 
intriguing observation.27 
25 Howard-Brook and Gwyther, Unveiling, 202-203, 204, 205. 
26 Howard-Brook and Gwyther, Unveiling, 204. 
27 In chapter two, Howard-Brook and Gwyther interject a lengthy discussion of the 
Zoroastrian influence on the bodily resurrection in Daniel and Revelation (pp. 72-75).  This 
connectionan odd addition to a chapter ostensibly on apocalyptic literatureis not explored, 
however, to illustrate the imperial interaction within Revelation.  This chapter progresses into what 
should have been a climactic section on the Jewish apocalyptic literature contemporary with 
Revelation (p. 77-81).  Unfortunately, the authors just offer briefly a few of the most important texts 
from around the same time period as Revelation with the goal to show how much of the imagery 
flowing from these apocalyptic roots made its way into texts beyond Revelation itself (p. 77).  While 
this shows potential influence on the book of Revelation, it does not extend the observations into 
Chapter 2 
 Similarly, Hurtgen offers potential parallels between the text of Revelation 
and the socio-rhetorical categories of anti-language to prove subversion in the 
Apocalypse.  He defines anti-language and its components as follows: 
The anti-language is a language of social conflictof passive resistance or 
active oppositionThe communities of Revelation are seen as anti-society on 
the outside of the dominant social structure.  This social placement is 
indicated by the use of anti-language, which is characterized by 
relexicalization (new words for old words) and overlexicalization 
(multiple words for the same concept).  Four practical functions of anti-
language are (1) secrecy, (2) verbal play, (3) solidarity, and (4) alternative 
social and conceptual reality.28 
In addition to the anti-imperial predisposition intrinsic to the model, Hurtgen 
attempts to prove the existence of anti-language by merely labeling the text of 
Revelation with the key elements of the socio-rhetorical modeleven if they do not 
fit or are not supported with viable evidenceand then avoids significant analysis. 
For example, Hurtgen describes secrecy as a key element of anti-
language in his definition above.  To prove this point in the Apocalypse, Hurtgen 
cites Revelation 13:18 which calls for discernment to understand the cipher of 666.29  
After this clear example of secrecy, Hurtgen awkwardly asserts that the use of the 
passive voice in the book of Revelation is further evidence of anti-language 
secrecy: The verbal play of anti-language is seen in the repeated use of the passive 
voice, which occurs three times in the third tableau.  The passive voice functions to 
inject an air of secrecy as well as to emphasize the acts of extra-historical agents in 
meaningful analysis with questions like, Why are these connections significant? or What shared 
purpose do these images indicate? or How do both books interact with the empire through these 
parallel images?  Instead, the parallel stagnates.  The rest of the chapter concludes with a cursory 
discussion of the mini apocalypses in the synoptic Gospels to emphasize their non-violent agenda 
(pp. 81-82).  Strangely, this section mentions no parallels to Revelation at all.  See also Kraybill, 
Apocalypse, 99. 
28 Hurtgen, Anti-Language, 1, 5. 
29 Hurtgen, Anti-Language, 117. 
Chapter 2 
the development of the visions.30  Besides the fact that the mere use of the passive 
voice hardly qualifies as an act of intentional secrecy, Hurtgen then fails to 
analyze this parallel.  There is no discussion of Why does Revelation need to use 
secrecy? or How does this action subvert the empire? or What are the imperial 
implications of the use of ciphers?  The parallel stagnates as an intriguing 
possibility. 
Also, Hurtgen categorizes the text of Revelation with the anti-language 
elements relexicalization and overlexicalization without any explanation or 
discussion.31  For Revelation 13, Hurtgen proposes, The beast from the sea is the 
Roman Empire relexicalized.  The beast from the land is the Roman Empire 
relexicalized, though viewed from a different aspect, namely, emperor worship, 
which to Jew and Christian alike constituted the height of ungodliness.32  No 
evidence or explanation is offered.33   
Notwithstanding the forced evidence, projects that surmise Revelations 
interaction with the empire and even subversion through anti-language must 
extend the conversation of potential parallels to imperial implications.  Indeed, 
30 Hurtgen, Anti-Language, 117 (cf. p. 102). 
31 Hurtgen, Anti-Language, 13. 
32 Hurtgen, Anti-Language, 114.  Hurtgen, Anti-Language, 96 asserts overlexicalization 
without supporting evidence: The ark of his covenant in his temple (     
   ) is an overlexicalized item which also indicates divine presence.  Overlexicalization 
serves to reinforce the divine role as well as the solemnity of the situation. 
33 Hurtgen compounds the oddity with subversive relexicalization that does not appear 
resistant at all [Hurtgen, Anti-Language, 99, Jesus is relexicalized as a male child ( )] 
and the transformation of common literary devices like puns, alliteration, and homonyms into 
seditious speech [Hurtgen, Anti-Language, 104, (1) Initial alliteration:   
(12:15);   (12:17) (2) Pun (Paronomasia: recurrence of same word or word stem): 
   (12:4);  ...  (12:6);       (12:14)(3) 
Homonym (Parechesis: recurrence of different words of similar sounds):   (12:6).  With this 
definition, should all poetry be considered anti-language? 
Chapter 2 
parallels without analysis offer little more than intriguing observations.  The authors 
above do not adequately address the question, How does Revelation interact with 
the empire? by simply listing possible parallels.  Significant analysis must follow to 
extrapolate the imperial implications. 
Textual Assertions: Biased Sample Selections 
 Another methodological weakness in Empire Studies is biased textual 
selections chosen for examination.  At times the selected text(s) unfairly slants the 
evidence in the interpreters favor, or correspondingly, the texts that do not support 
the intended conclusion are conveniently ignored.   
So Hurtgens choice of Revelation 11:19-15:4 for his socio-rhetorical anti-
language analysis proves quite expedient given that this is arguably the most widely 
recognized political section in the Apocalypse.34  It would be more compelling if he 
used a politically benign section (Rev 1; 10:1-11:18; etc.) or even a theologically 
encumbered text (Rev 19:11-21; 20:1-10; etc.).  Hurtgens selection of Revelation 
11:19-15:4, however, appears to predispose the research in his favor. 
 Concurrently, Howard-Brook and Gwyther appear to slant the evidence in 
their favor by avoiding texts that are not overtly political.  For example, besides the 
outline in the introduction,35 Revelation 20 is never mentioned again throughout the 
entire book.  It is true that Revelation 20 is notoriously difficult due to theological 
baggage. Nevertheless, if John attempts to unveil the empire, then it would seem to 
34 Hurtgen, Anti-Language, vii, 89.  Hurtgens selection of Rev 11:19-15:4 is also quite 
peculiar in that he concludes: I concur with Kempson that one finds a climactic section for his Vision 
II in the above section; but I find Fiorenza more convincing that Apocalypse of John 10:1-15:4 serves 
as the climactic center of the action, for the section of early Christian prophecy presents the 
prophetic interpretation of the political and religious situation of the community (pp. 94-95).  If this 
is true, then why does he ignore Rev 10:1-11:18? 
35 Howard-Brook and Gwyther, Unveiling, xxvi. 
Chapter 2 
follow that at this climactic moment in the narrativein which Satan, the key 
antagonist, is bound and imprisoned (20:1-3), the faithful reign with Christ 1,000 
years (20:4-6), after which Satan is released (20:3b, 7-9a) and then defeated with fire 
from heaven (20:9b-10)Revelation 20 would have something to contribute to the 
imperial conversation.36  Howard-Brook and Gwyther, however, choose not to 
engage such texts, but instead, ignore them in their discussions and conclusions.  
Therefore, like Hurtgen, the selection of texts seems to predispose the research in 
their favor.  If, however, Revelations interaction with the Roman Empire is to be 
adequately explored, then even the most obscure passages must be considered for the 
overall portrait painted in the Apocalypse. 
An Alter-Imperial Response to Textual Assertions 
Methodologies that offer parallels without analysis from biased passages are 
inadequate to answer the question, How does Revelation interact with the empire?  
Like the anti-imperial assumption above, the goal of Empire Studies is not to prove 
the existence of sedition but to allow the subjects voice in the text to be heard on its 
own terms, whether subversive or acquiescent. 
As a result, this dissertation implements the Alter-Imperial paradigm on 
Revelation 20:7-10 as a case study for the paradigms effectiveness on Revelation as 
a whole.  Although it appears at a climactic moment in the Apocalypse, this text is a 
markedly uncharacteristic passage for imperial inquiry and is traditionally consigned 
to theological debates over the millennium.  Thus, the Alter-Imperial paradigm is not 
36 Rev 20:7-10 is typically denied significant investigation in Revelation scholarship.  At 
times, it is acknowledged but not analyzed [Friesen, Imperial, 159-160; Collins, Combat Myth, 225-
226; Ford, Revelation, 355-357], retold but not explained [Kraybill, Apocalypse, 165; Friesen, 
Imperial, 159-161, 188], or completely ignored [Collins, Crisis, 150; Kraybill, Apocalypse, 24]. 
Chapter 2 
tested through research predisposed to its imperial trajectory but the opposite. 
However, a lucid interpretation of an obscure text through imperial parallels 
does not adequately address the question, How does Revelation interact with the 
empire?  Further analysis is necessary.  Therefore, this dissertation concludes 
(chapter 7) with an analysis of the Alter-Imperial interpretation of Revelation 20:7-
10 (chapter 6) to encourage and temper further imperial explorations in the 
Apocalypse and beyond. 
Methodological Weakness #3: Historical-Contextual Ambiguity 
A central element to Empire Studies is socio-historical context.  The imperial 
message of the dominant elite functions as an interpretative link with the text of the 
dominated non-elite.  It is essential, therefore, to clearly describe the Roman imperial 
context concurrent with the subject texts composition.  Yet, both Hurtgen and 
Howard-Brook/Gwyther suffer from historical-contextual ambiguity that weakens 
their imperial conclusions about Revelation. 
After stating the sociolinguistic purpose of his work, Hurtgen touts, What 
makes the study interesting for this writer is viewing the Apocalypse of John in terms 
of the verbal contest and verbal display (relexicalization and overlexicalization) that 
surfaces in the language of the oppressed Christians.37  Hurtgens examination, 
however, never discusses the language of the oppressor.  If anti-language 
constitutes a response from the mouths of the oppressed, then it is essential to 
delineate the voice of the oppressor, which gives access to the language that is to 
be opposed.   
37 Hurtgen, Anti-Language, 14 [emphasis added]. 
Chapter 2 
Nevertheless, throughout his short discussion of the socio-historical setting of 
Revelation,38 key elements of imperial interaction in the text are either ignored or 
consigned to brief assertions in the footnotes.  For example, the type of persecution 
experienced,39 the identity of the key symbols of political dominance in Revelation 
13 (the two beasts),40 and the potential parallel to the Nero redivivus myth in 
Revelation 1341all three of which are major components to his selected text (Rev 
11:19-15:4)are not discussed.  Instead, sources that engage these topics germane to 
Hurtgens analysis are listed in the footnotes.  This vague picture of the dominant 
and oppressive Roman Empire42 is then assumed throughout the rest of his analysis 
in statements like, John, the seer and hearer, was convinced that talking back, 
often in secretive ways (e.g., numeration), was the best way to respond to the 
dominant culture.43  Such nebulous predications simply beg the question, To 
what/whom is John talking back?  In other words, the existence of anti-language 
within a text necessitates an opposing voice that the oppressed community confronts.  
What Hurtgen provides is a socio-linguistic model without a context. 
38 While Hurtgens table of contents suggests that the section on the social location of 
thought stretches from page 17 to 50, the information regarding the realia of Revelation is handled 
only on pages 19-26.  The rest of the chapter discusses sociological models and methodologies. 
39 Hurtgen, Anti-Language, 48 (n. 117) asserts that he does not have to conclude what type of 
persecution actually occurred and then offers no explanation as to why this is the case. 
40 Hurtgen, Anti-Language, 107 (n. 36), The history of interpretation of the first beast (13:1-
10), as well the other beast (13:11-18), is long and complex.I have followed the majority of 
commentators who identify the beast from the sea with the Roman Empire 
41 Hurtgen, Anti-Language, 107 (n. 36), Collins, Revelation, pp. 59-64, has clearly laid out 
the four basic positions concerning the identity of the wounded and healed head of the beast from the 
sea and concluded that the latter referred to Nero and the Nero redivivus myth 
42 Hurtgen, Anti-Language, 113. 
43 Hurtgen, Anti-Language, 139 (cf. p. 106).  Also, Hurtgen, Anti-Language, 122 (n. 58) 
states, I concur with Fiorenza, however, that symbols of the fourth tableau are a fitting response to 
the social-historical-political situation faced by the Christians of Asia Minor (p. 123).  In what ways 
are they a fitting response?  What are they responding to?  What was the social-historical-political 
situation that the Christians in Asia Minor faced?  Hurtgen scarcely raises, much less addresses, such 
questions. 
Chapter 2 
A similar oddity is found in Howard-Brook and Gwythers disregard for the 
date of Revelations composition.  In the introduction to the book, preliminary issues 
are addressed, including Revelations structure44 and author,45 but curiously the date 
is completely ignored.46  Even in chapter three, dedicated to the historical context of 
the Apocalypse, a discussion on the date of Revelation is absent.  In spite of their 
stated goal to investigate how Rome constructed this coherent and ordered view and 
the reality it sought to mask, it is difficult to construct the historical context of any 
text without a general date from which to begin.47  This overlooks significant 
historical questions like: Are the agendas of Augustus the same as Caligula?  Does 
the propaganda (the mask) of Claudius carry the same emphases as Nero?  If so, 
what are the common images and slogans?  If not, what has shifted?  Moreover, did 
the propaganda shift or stay the same when the Flavian dynasty replaced the Julio-
Claudian line?  Thus, if a date is not established for a subject text, analysis of 
imperial interaction is greatly hindered due to the complex contours of historical 
contexts in the empire.48

117-118.  In this description, the authors do not take a stance on the issue; instead, they simply say 
that some have moved away from the date of Revelation as the time of Domitian.

48 As Collins, Crisis, 50 (cf. p. 54) urges, Since Revelation is so greatly oriented toward 
social and political matters, it is absolutely essential that it be dated as precisely as possible.  
Otherwise, the allusions to its situation might be seriously misinterpreted and its purpose 
misunderstood.  Cf. Christopher Rowland, The Open Heaven: A Study of Apocalyptic in Judaism and

historical setting of the empire at the time of Revelations composition.  If the 
sovereigns voice is ignored, then the subjects voice distorts in our modern ears 
when they speak about the empire.  So if Revelation uses imagery from the empire to 
compose its message, then the imperial imagery must be analyzed to understand its 
function in the text.  Otherwise, our examination relies on assumptions, assertions, 
and ambiguities of the historical context that weaken our conclusions. 
At this point, three methodological weaknesses of Empire Studies have been 
identified: [1] anti-imperial assumptions, [2] textual assertions, and [3] historical-
contextual ambiguity.  These three deficiencies are obstacles that must be overcome 
in order to answer the question, How does Revelation interact with the empire?  
The Alter-Imperial paradigm addresses these vulnerabilities of Empire Studies and 
offers a way forward. 
The Alter-Imperial Paradigm 
Similar to Postcolonial criticism, the goal of this dissertation is to resurrect 
the voice of the marginalized author of Revelation (cf. Rev 1:9) who writes to a 
community of churches in Asia Minor (Rev 2:1-3:22) in search of their suppressed 
identity on the ideological fringes of society.49  In light of the observations of 
dominance from Homi Bhabha and James C. Scott, this dissertation constructs an 
Alter-Imperial paradigm that allows for elements of subversion, acquiescence, both, 
or neither in the subject text.  Avoiding the pitfalls of anti-imperial assumptions, 
textual assertions, and historical-contextual ambiguity, the Alter-Imperial paradigm

Minor, see: Rev 1:5b-6, 9, 20; 2:2-3, 4-5, 9, 13, 14-15, 19, 20; 3:1-2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 15-17; 5:10; 6:17;

Chapter 2 
intends to answer the question, How does Revelation interact with the empire? 
through [1] the construction of the sovereign narrative of the Roman Empire and [2] 
points of conversation in the subject narrative. 
The Construction of the Sovereign Narrative of the Roman Empire 
As stated above, socio-historical context is an essential element for imperial 
inquiries.  Without a clear depiction of the sovereigns of society, the interaction of 
the subjects with the empire becomes distorted.  Therefore, the Roman imperial 
propaganda preceding and contemporary with the book of Revelation needs careful 
articulation.  
Building on the diagram in Appendix A that depicts James C. Scotts analysis 
of domination and resistance,50 Appendix B adds two key elements that are not 
explicit in the works of Scott or Bhabha: the sovereign narrative and the subject 
narrative.51  Defined in this context, the term narrative is the ideology that 
articulates how the world should be.  That is to say, the sovereign narrative is the 
ideology of how the world should be from the dominant perspective, which is 
implemented in the public transcript through imperial propaganda (static and 
enacted)52 and the threat of violence.53  The subject narrative, then, is the ideology of 
how the world should be from the dominated perspective, which is occasionally 
(but not necessarily) communicated in the public transcript in subtle ways but more

chapter 3 below on pp. 90-93. 
53 For a similar observation, see the description of the imperial discourse in Friesen, 
Imperial, 17, 18, 53.  Cf. Anathea E. Portier-Young, Apocalypse Against Empire: Theologies of 
Resistance in Early Judaism (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2011), 12. 
Chapter 2 
freely articulated in the social space of the subjects hidden transcript. 
 As Appendix B shows, the sovereign narrative dominates the public 
transcript.  This ideology is performed by both the sovereign and the subjects; it 
reiterates their identities in the third space as superior and inferior, respectively.  To 
establish the socio-historical context for the time of the subject texts composition is 
to disclose the content of the empires sovereign narrative.  This reveals the ideology 
with which the subject narrative dialogs.54   
In section two of this dissertation, the three chapters focus on the socio-
historical context of the book of Revelation.  First, the Roman sovereign narrative is 
constructed through the imagery found in the static and enacted propaganda that 
saturates the public transcript from Augustus onward.55  From this broad view of the 
Roman Empire, the date of the book of Revelation is established through external 
and internal evidence to provide a more precise target of historical investigation.56  In 
the final chapter of section two, the socio-historical context is constructed from this 
date.57  These elements position the text of Revelation in a setting that allows 
interaction with the empire to be seen more clearly. 
Points of Conversation in the Subject Narrative 
 The goal of the dissertation, however, is not merely to construct the imperial 
54 In critique of James C. Scott, Timothy J. Lukes, Book Review: Domination and the Arts 
of Resistance: Hidden Transcripts by James C. Scott, APSR 85.4 (1991): 1455 cautions, Without an 
identifiable source of domination, the hidden transcript can become inchoate and incoherent.  See 
also Marie Marmo Mullaney, Book Review: Domination and the Arts of Resistance: Hidden 
Transcripts by James C. Scott, JMH 65.3 (1993): 579-581.

context of the Apocalypse.  Rather, the socio-historical context is simply the means 
by which the text of Revelation can be probed to address the question, How does 
Revelation interact with the empire?  This interaction is channeled through points 
of conversation in the subject narrative. 
 As Appendix B depicts, the sovereign narrative bypasses the dominants 
hidden transcript and dictates the machinations of the public transcript.  Conversely, 
the subjects hidden transcript, at times, intentionally penetrates the porous public 
transcript to appear on the public stage in veiled ways.  More importantly for the 
purpose of this dissertation, the subject hidden transcript is in persistent dialogue 
with the subject narrative (how the world should be from the dominated 
perspective).58 
 Appendix C reorganizes the conversation with a more focused agenda on the 
question, What contributes to the dynamics of the subject narrative?59  The subject 
narrative is developed and articulated through two key areas of influence: subject 
traditions and points of conversation.  Subject traditions refer to the common 
beliefs, myths, and lore indigenous to the subjects.  Regarding the book of 
Revelation, the subject traditions would refer to the Jewish literature that fuels a 
large portion of the imagery in the book of Revelation.60 
 The points of conversation, though, refer to elements from the sovereign 
58 Neither Scott nor Bhabha point this out explicitly.  While it may be a simple nuance, the 
existence of an underlying ideology that fuels the hidden transcripts (or mimicries) should be 
examined with more acumen.  Like the sovereign narrative, the context and content of the subject 
narrative will greatly advance the overall discussion of how the subject interacts with the sovereign. 
59 While the depiction is original to the author, the ideas are implicitly found in Bhabha and, 
more visibly, in Scott.   
60 As could be inferred, the Old Testament intertextual explorations in Revelation (described 
above) play a significant role here.  See Elisabeth Schssler Fiorenza, The Book of Revelation: Justice 
and Judgment (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1985), 170, 180 (n. 47). 
Chapter 2 
narrative that are selected in the articulation of the subject narrative.61  That is to say, 
the points of conversation are the public manifestations of the sovereign narrative 
selected by the dominant to explicate their overall perspective of how the world 
should be.  Thus, points of conversation for the subject narrative (used for 
complicit or rebellious ends) are initially offered by the dominant as a way to 
communicate their sovereign narrative in the public transcript through the use of 
static and enacted propaganda.  Nevertheless, this propaganda not only 
communicates the sovereign narrative of the elites, but it also functions as key 
symbols for the dominated to develop their own subject narrative in a grammar and 
through imagery already familiar in the imperial discourse.  The points of 
conversation, then, are the expressions of the sovereign narrative that ring loudest in 
the ears of the subjects.62   
It is in these points of conversation where an answer, on some level, can be 
found to the question, How does the subject text interact with the empire?  Is the 
sovereign narrative gladly accepted and incorporated?  Is it rejected outright?  Is 
there a conflation of both acquiescence and subversion?63  In other words, how does 
the subject narrative utilize the points of conversation from the sovereign narrative 
in its subject text?   
61 As could be inferred, the historical inquiries and sociological investigations in Revelation 
(described above) play a significant role here.

heavenly letter, its imagery did not simply fall out of the sky.  See also Laura Salah Nasrallah,

63 Although Scott, Domination, xii, asserts that every subordinate group creates, out of its 
ordeal, a hidden transcript that represents a critique of power spoken behind the back of the 
dominant, this dissertation does not assume that every subordinate group creates a hidden 
transcript nor that what is created is a critique of power. 
Chapter 2 
 In section three, the points of conversation that surface in the socio-
historical context of section two are used as a lens to view the book of Revelation 
from an Alter-Imperial perspective.  More specifically, Revelation 20:7-10 functions 
as a case study to see if points of conversation can offer a more lucid interpretation 
to a notoriously difficult text.64  The final chapter analyzes this interpretation and the 
Alter-Imperial paradigm to directly address the question, How does Revelation 
interact with the empire?65

Chapter 3: 
The Sovereign Narrative of the Roman Empire 
 The sovereign narrative dominates the public transcript.  The ideological 
agenda of the elite floods the public forum and consistently articulates from their 
perspective how the world should be.  From city streets to country roads, from 
common markets to local theaters, from elaborate buildings to mundane cooking 
utensils, the Roman world was saturated with imperial propaganda.  The Roman 
Empire understood that every item (coins, weapons, altars) and every encounter 
(funerals, festivals, triumphs) was an opportunity to communicate the sovereign 
narrativea weapon more powerful to control their subjects than any potent army.1  
The imagery that decorated the empire, then, was not merely an occasion for 
beautification, but instead, it was an essential articulation of the sovereign narrative 
so that even the unlettered viewer could hardly fail to grasp the message.2 
1 Edward N. Luttwak, The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire: From the First Century 
A.D. to the Third (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976), 1-3 suggests the Roman army 
was not vastly superior in war tactics or weaponry; instead, the more subtle order of complex ideas 
and traditions offered the Roman army a more ideological or political purposemore 
psychological and not physical.  Although Luttwaks view of a grand strategy for the Roman 
army is debated [so Martin Goodman, The Roman World: 44 BC  AD 180 (London: Routledge, 
1997), 83 and 105], many scholars agree that psychological weapons (or fear) were the most 
powerful tools of the Roman Empire.  Susan P. Mattern, Rome and the Enemy: Imperial Strategy in 
the Principate (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999), 115-116 writes, I would argue that 
Romes real strategy lay in the realm of psychology. The empire was defended not by scientific 
frontiers, however we might choose to define such a phrase. For defense the Romans relied mainly, as 
Themistius suggests, on terror.  Elsewhere, she states, What mattered most was how the empire, and 
to some degree the emperor, were perceived by foreigners and subjects.  Symbolic deference from the 
enemy was a policy goal; arrogance and insultwere just and necessary causes for war. Terror and 
vengeance were instruments for maintaining the empires image (p. 22).  See William V. Harris, War 
and Imperialism in Republican Rome, 327-70 BC (New York: Oxford University Press, 1979), 50-53; 
Anathea E. Portier-Young, Apocalypse Against Empire: Theologies of Resistance in Early Judaism 
(Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2011), 12; Laura Salah Nasrallah, Christian Responses to Roman Art and 
Architecture: The Second-Century Church Amid the Spaces of Empire (Cambridge: Cambridge 
University Press, 2010), 11-12. 
2 Paul Zanker, The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus (trans. Alan Shapiro; Ann Arbor, 
Mich.: University of Michigan Press, 1990), 312.  John Elsner, Cult and Scripture: Sacrifice in the 
Ara Pacis Augustae, JRS 81 (1991): 51 critiques Zanker for presenting the Augustan art as the state 
might ideally have wished it to be viewed, which deprives art of any subversive or conflictive 
viewings.  From the perspective of the die-engraver or sculptor, Elsners critique is justified.  
Chapter 3 
 This chapter summarizes the sovereign narrative of Rome communicated 
through the images of the empire.  Both what was articulated and how it was 
articulated offer a lucid picture of the world asserted by the Roman elite and 
inadvertently developed points of conversation for the subject narrative.  The 
images of the sovereign narrative develop a grammar through which the subjects of 
the empire can speakwhether positively or negatively.3  Therefore, to hear the 
Zankers contribution, however, centers on the function of the images in the public transcript.  For a 
position commiserate to Zanker, see Adolf Deissmann, Light from the Ancient East (trans. Lionel 
R.M. Strachan; New York: Hodder & Stoughton, 1908; repr., Grand Rapids: Baker, 1978), 10. 
3 Contra Paul Veyne, Lisibilit des images, propaganda et apparat monarchique dans 
lEmpire romain, RevH 304.1 (2002): 3-30.  Veyne distinguishes between propaganda and 
pomp.  Propaganda is only used when an insecure monarchy needs to convince its subjects of its 
legitimacy.  Rome, so Veyne suggests, was not in this position, and therefore, the imagery should be 
seen as pomp (a neutral beautification of the empire).  As Veyne writes, Lapparat, lui, ne vise pas 
 conqurir les esprits, car les sujets du roi sont dj convaincus de la lgitimit de leur matre ou 
prsums ltre : on ne suppose pas un instant quils puissent en douter.  Un consensus monarchique 
bien tabli na pas besoin de propagandeOn fait de la propagande afin de devenir dictateur ou de le 
rester, tandis que lapparat est dploy parce quon est le roi (p. 23).  Rome did not need propaganda 
since they enjoyed a well-established monarchical consensus, and therefore the empire was 
decorated with just pomp.  Veynes primary evidence, Trajans Column (113 C.E.) north of the 
Roman Forum, contains non-visible imagery incapable of influencing passersby.  Thus, Veyne 
writes, Cette indiffrence [of the visibility of the imagery on the relief] sexplique bien simplement : 
le dcor de la colonne est une expression dapparat imprial et non une information de propagande 
communique au spectateur (p. 9).  Veyne deduces from this indifference a wide conclusion for all 
Roman imagery, in that le cas de la Trajane serait plutt la rgle que lexception (p. 10).  Regarding 
imagery on patriotic cakes given to the plebs after public sacrifices, Veyne writes, Cette imagerie 
monarchiste et patriotique faisait peu deffect sur la population, pour la simple raison que cette 
population tait convaincue davance et en mme temps parce que cette mme population ny croyait 
pas.  En effet, les sujets du prince aimaient leur souveraince ntait pas l un sentiment dlection, 
mais un sentiment induit par la relation de dpendance (p. 20).  So, whenever Veyne engages visible 
imagery in Rome (i.e., imperial coinage), he either dismisses their potential as propaganda as 
anachronistic (pp. 16-17) or he calls them exceptions to the rule [i.e., coins under Vespasian and 
Domitian (p. 17, n. 64 and 65) or Augustus imagery as a whole (pp. 26-27)].  Three points are made in 
response.  First, Veynes analysis begins with a false dichotomy fueled by poor definitions of pomp 
and propaganda.  The two options for imperial imagery are not either [1] forcefully coercive 
imagery due to imperial insecurity (Veynes propaganda) or [2] an expression of acceptance and 
love for the sovereign under whose reign you joyfully submit (Veynes pomp).  While on some 
level propaganda does desire a response, the viewers disposition determines the imagerys intent.  If 
the viewer is recalcitrant, then the imagery calls for repentance; if the viewer is complicit, then the 
imagery contributes to their edification.   In addition, this completely ignores questions like, Why 
would Rome choose the imagery they chose?; Was the imagery completely random in its 
implementation?; Why do patterns in the imagery (i.e., on coins) reappear yet differ in emphasis and 
implementation from reign to reign?; etc.  Second, Veynes analysis both assumes and concludes that 
every person in the Roman Empire (sovereign or subject) agreed with the imagerys message, 
ignoring the possibility (and historical evidence) of any dissident voices.  Although Homi Bhabha and 
James C. Scott (described above) would reject this assumption, the existence of resistance literature
like the Qumran War Scroll (1QM and 4Q491-497) and 2 Esdras (esp. 10:60-12:35)and violent 
revolutions (like the Jews of 66-73 C.E.) suggest that the population had not been already convinced 
Chapter 3 
marginalized voice in the subject text (i.e., the Book of Revelation) more clearly, it is 
important to first analyze the imperial language they have been given to speakin 
this case, the sovereign narrative of the Roman Empire. 
The Means of Communication:  
Key Elements of the Sovereign Narrative in the Public Transcript 
 In order for every subject of the empire, educated and uneducated, to be able 
to grasp the sovereign narrative,4 two key components must exist: [1] locations of 
intersection and [2] imperial billboards.5  The goal is to saturate the subjects with 
effective means of communication at multiple locations of frequent intersectionfor 
repetition is a powerful ideological weapon.6  It is no accident, then, when images of 
the sovereign narrative are found in the architecture of the bath house,7 on the curtain 
of the theater,8 on the statues littering the public Forum,9 or even along the roads 
of the message in Romes monarchical and patriotic imagery.  Indeed, as this dissertation intends to 
show, the evidence of points of conversation from the sovereign narrative in subject narrative texts 
indicates that, despite Veynes claims, Romes imagery was interpreted by some as not merely 
pomp but as a competing message that deserved to be addressed.  Third, the existence of imperial 
imagery on structures that are not readily visible does not necessitate the complete eradication of the 
imagerys impact when it is clearly visible.  In fact, the presence of the imperial imagery in non-
visible locations is itself evidence of the successful effect of the imagery in the visible locations, in 
that when engaging the empire (whether complicit or rebellious) out of the empires direct visibility, 
the subjects know what language to use.  In other words, the visible imperial imagery develops the 
language to engage the empire (whether complicit or rebellious).  The non-visible imagery, then, 
communicates the imperial propagandas complete saturation of the Roman world: both seen and 
unseen.  Cf. Nasrallah, Christian Responses, 2, 14, 161, 171; Portier-Young, Apocalypse, 63. 
4 This does not mean that they must agree with the sovereign narrativejust understand 
what is being articulated. 
5 Imperial Billboards are the various means of communication for the elites to speak to 
their subjects: numismatics, inscriptions, mosaics, frescoes, temples, historical texts, myths, etc.

between cities on pillars set up every mile to proclaim in big letters to whom it was 
owed.10  At the busiest intersections of life,11 imperial billboards constantly 
communicate the sovereign narrative. 
Imperial Billboards 
 Various modes of communication are necessary if both the educated and 
uneducated subjects of the empire are to grasp the sovereign message.  As a result, 
the Roman Empire utilized both static propaganda (i.e., coins, altars, statues) and 
enacted propaganda (i.e., rituals, processions, ceremonies). 
 Static propaganda has the advantage of longevityin that enacted 
propaganda only lasts as long as the experience or the memory of the experience 
unless it is converted to static propagandabut the distinct disadvantage of 
marketing space constraints.  More specifically, the space allotted for an 
inscription or the size of the coin minted limits the length of the propaganda.  Thus, 
static propaganda is a carefully thought out articulation by the patron.12 
 The power of static propaganda, however, should not be minimized due to its 
space limitations, for without fail these objects prove quite influential.  For example, 
coins in the ancient world developed into a significant medium for the sovereign 
narrative.13  Coins isolate easily recognizable symbols to communicate achievements

coins, cups, and religious items.

(1940): 75; Michael Grant, The World of Rome: The History of the Roman Empire from 133 BC to AD 
217 (London: Phoenix, 1960), 49.  For the use of imperial coinage in Seleucid propaganda, see 
Chapter 3 
(buildings, military victories, political positions), divine favor (images of gods, 
actions of gods, captions), and essential propaganda (events of the past, visions of the 
future, key words, depictions of the ruler).14   
Imperial control of a coins production emphasizes the importance of coinage 
for imperial propaganda.  Under Augustus, a significant portion of the coinage was 
brought under the direct control of the emperor, apart from the Senate.  As C.H.V. 
Sutherland points out, propaganda was now to be as important a function of coinage 
as its very economic activity.15  Production was controlled by the state and not the 
result of chance selection, or of a die-engravers roaming, unfettered fancy.16   
In addition, the frequent changes of captions and images indicate the imperial 
perception of the coins influence.  As Shelagh M. Bond writes: 
We can only assume from the way in which successive emperors caused a 
multiplicity of types to be struck on their coins, changing with the greatest 
frequency, that the Romans and provincials looked at them far more 
attentively than we look at our coin types today. In fact the population of the 
Empire clearly expected to find in their coinage the kind of interest and 
information that modern readers find in newspapers and periodicals.The 
fact that the coin types were changed so often, and were used to convey quite 
complicated concepts relating to the imperial house, convinces us that this 
method of publicity met a demand and was eminently successful.17

No modern dictator distributes photographs of himself so thoroughly as the rulers of the Roman 
empire circulated theirs; their portraits reached millions (who could see their ruler in no other 
medium, except the coinage)so that the portraits on these coins had their share of the veneration 
accorded to imperial statues.

Wide circulation of coins across the empire18 transformed this economic mechanism 
into a potent imperial billboard that grandly announced the inauguration of new 
imperial dynasties19 and even mundanely influenced peoples hairstyles in Northwest 
Briton.20 
 Space limitations do not diminish the power of static propaganda in the 
slightest; these imperial billboards become a succinct and pervasive method of 
immersing the subjects in the sovereign narrative.  From tableware in Boscoreale,21 
to household shrines in exile,22 to tombstones in Briton,23 to Roman buildings across 
the empire,24 static propaganda was a considerable weapon for imperial propaganda. 
 Similarly, enacted propaganda proved quite useful as an imperial billboard.  
The avenues of enacted propaganda ranged from funeral processions,25 to public 
games,26 to annual sacrifices at the Ara Pacis Augustae altar on the Campus 
Martius,27 to the magnificent display of a Roman triumphal procession.28  The power 
of enacted propaganda is the ability to not just present the imperial imagery to the

viewer but to provide an avenue in which the subject may actually participate in the 
propaganda.  The goal moves beyond the visual impact found in the static 
propaganda.  As Velleius Paterculus declares, enacted propaganda intends to fill the 
minds and eyes of the Roman people with the magnificent spectacle saturated with 
unforgettable images.29  Enacted propaganda allows the subjects to participate in the 
sovereign narrative and not merely observe.  To the subjects, then, an active role is 
offered in the narratives progression and to the dominant, a powerful weapon to 
perpetuate it.30 
 The static and enacted propaganda develop a setting in which the sovereign 
narrative is constantly present.  Direct and indirect, subtle and blatant, the imperial 
billboards of the empire communicate to the educated and the uneducated the 
imperial perspective of how the world should be, a sovereign narrative that can 
still be heard through the remains of the Roman world today.   
The Sovereign Narrative of Rome: 
Three Related Messages 
 In what follows, both static and enacted propaganda summarize the 
articulation of Romes sovereign narrativea sovereign narrative that proclaimed 
three related messages: [1] The Roman Empire is the ruler of the kings of the earth; 
[2] The Roman Empire is favored by the gods; and [3] The Roman Empire is the 
bearer of Pax.  While traces of each message can be found throughout the Republic, 
29 Vell. Pat. 2.100.2 (Shipley, LCL). 
30 As Portier-Young, Apocalypse, 162 notes, [Military parades in the Greco-Roman world] 
were also crafted displays of power meant to stir the emotions of their participants and spectators, 
creating and manipulating a sense of collective identity mixed with awe and fear of the conquering 
empire (see also p. 198). 
Chapter 3 
the following investigation centers on its articulation in the time of Augustus with 
some of its especially pertinent inflections in the first century C.E.31 
Message #1:  
The Roman Empire is the ruler of the kings of the earth 
War is the father of all and king of all.   
Somehe makes slaves, others free.  
[Heraclitus of Ephesus]32 
 Already in the 2nd century B.C.E., Polybius declares, For who is so 
worthless or indolent as not to wish to know by what means and under what system 
of polity the Romans in less than fifty-three years have succeeded in subjecting 
nearly the whole inhabited world () to their sole governmenta thing 
unique in history?33  Shortly thereafter, Pompeys triumph included a trophy of the 
whole world ()34 and Cicero referred to Caesar as master of the whole 
world.35  Therefore, it is not surprising to find the first messageThe Roman 
Empire is the ruler of the kings of the earthembedded into the sovereign narrative 
in the time of Augustus.  What is surprising, though, is the marked intensification of 
this message in Augustan propaganda.36 
31 This assumes that Augustus is the sovereign narratives primary architect replicated 
throughout the first century Roman world.  This is not to suggest, however, that the articulation of the 
sovereign narrative stopped at the end of the first century, but regarding the study of the book of 
Revelation, the time period from Augustus to Domitian is most directly relevant.  Therefore, emperors 
that follow the Flavians will be referenced periodically, but they will not be a central focus.

Chapter 3 
 Leading up to the reign of Augustus, the Roman Empire was caught in 
destructive struggles for power.  The death of Julius Caesar in 44 B.C.E. led to 
thirteen years of instability filled with media wars37 and physical wars38 that resulted 
in the final standoff between Octavian and Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium in 
September of 31 B.C.E.  These events left the Roman world weary of crime, civil 
war, and bloodshed39 and desperate for stability.   
Having assumed power after the Battle of Actium, Augustus immediately 
began to employ both static and enacted propaganda to erase the past and prepare the 
world for the future under his reign.  The Battle of Actium was transformed from the 
zenith of civil wars where Romans were killing Romans40 into a majestic victory 
over a barbarian foreign leader trying to overthrow the glory of Rome.41  Therefore, 
the propaganda heralded the reign of Augustus as the establishment of security in the 
empire and Romes supreme reign over the rulers of the whole world. 
The massive funerary inscription known as the Res Gestae Divi Augusti
written by Augustus himself, entrusted to the vestal Virgins, inscribed on bronze 
tablets and put at the entrance of his mausoleum on the Campus Martius in Rome42
commences with this heading: Below is a copy of the acts of the Deified Augustus 
37 Goodman, Roman, 37 states, Octavian in 32 BC began to portray Antonius as essentially 
un-Roman, a slave to his oriental mistress, and an incompetent drunkard.  Augustus reinterpreted 
Antonys alliance with Cleopatra, his Egyptian mistress (Dio Cass. 50.4.5), and Antonys claim to be 
a descendant of Dionysus, the god of wine (Plut., Ant. 24, 26, 71).

by which he placed the whole world (orbem terrarum) under the sovereignty of the 
Roman people (Shipley, LCL).  The literature of the day disseminated this message 
of dominance as well, given Augustuss patronage of many widely distributed 
writers.43  One of the most significant pieces was Virgils Roman national epic the 
Aeneid, written from 29-19 B.C.E.  In response to Venuss lament over the apparent 
plight of the Trojans (1.227-253) and her son Aeneas (1.259), Jupiter, the Father of 
men and gods (1.254-255), reveals the future of Aeneass ancestors and its climax 
in the worldwide reign of Augustan Rome: 
Then Romulus, proud in the tawny hide of the she-wolf, his nurse, shall take 
up the line, and found the walls of Mars and call the people Romans after his 
own name. For these I set no bounds in space or time; but have given empire 
without end. Spiteful Juno, who now in her fear troubles sea and earth and 
sky, shall change to better counsels and with me cherish the Romans, lords of 
the world, and the nation of the toga. Thus is it decreed.From this noble 
line shall be born the Trojan Caesar, who shall extend his empire to the 
ocean, his glory to the stars, a Julius [Augustus], name descended from great 
Iulus Him, in days to come, shall you, anxious no more, welcome to heaven, 
laden with Eastern spoils; he, too, shall be invoked in vows. Then wars shall 
cease and savage ages soften; hoary Faith and Vesta, Quirinus with his 
brother Remus, shall give laws. The gates of war, grim with iron and close-
fitting bars, shall be closed; within, impious Rage, sitting on savage arms, his 
hands fast bound behind with a hundred brazen knots, shall roar in the 
ghastliness of blood-stained lips.44 
Though the Aeneid traces the actions of the heroic Aeneas, son of the gods, it also 
functioned as Augustan propaganda that announced Rome as the lords of the world 
through his reign.45 
 Other literary writers of the day echoed the same imperial message.  So 
Vitruvius (80/70 B.C.E.-15 B.C.E.) opens his first book on Architecture, While, O

Chapter 3 
Caesar, your god-like mind and genius were engaged in acquiring the dominion of 
the world (imperio potiretur orbis terrarum), your enemies having been all subdued 
by your unconquerable valour...46  Also, Livy (64/59 B.C.E.-17 C.E.), while 
describing a vision of Romulus by Proculus Julius, portrays the dead founder of 
Rome delivering this oracle of stability, Go tell the Romans, that it is the will of 
heaven that my Rome should be the head of all the world (Roma caput orbis 
terrarum sit),47 which Ovid reiterates, The land of other nations has a fixed 
boundary: The circuit of Rome is the circuit of the world (Romanae spatium est urbis 
et orbis idem)48 and also calls Augustus Father of the World (pater orbis eras).49  
The literature of Augustuss day seemingly speaks with one voice and exclaims: 
The Roman Empire is the ruler of the kings of the earth.50 
 Various depictions of geography communicated the same message.  As Gary 
Gilbert notes, Among the various methods Rome used to promote its ideology of 
universal rule, the listing of foreign nations or peoples proved to be one of the more 
frequent and effective.51  Inscriptions both inside and outside the city of Rome list 
conquered nations.52  Pliny the elder describes an inscription on a triumphal arch on 
the Alps that begins, To the Emperor CaesarThe son of Caesar now deified, 
Augustus, Pontifex Maximusin remembrance that under his command and

auspices all the Alpine nations which extended from the upper sea to the lower were 
reduced to subjection by the Roman people.53  The inscription continues to list 
forty-six names of Alpine nations subdued by Augustus.  Similarly, in Lugdunum, 
Strabo reports that an altar was erected bearing an inscription of the names of the 
tribes, sixty in number.54  These lists served as static propaganda to remind the 
inhabitants of their subjugation, similar to the intent of coins depicting VICTORIA 
AVGVSTI.55 
 Names of towns and cities paraded in imperial processions conveyed the 
same message of dominance.  For example, in Roman triumphs the names of 
conquered places56 along with depictions of their destruction would appear amidst 
the spoils of war.57   Propertius, in a description of an envisioned triumph over the 
lands east of the Euphrates, desires to witness the spoils paraded through streets and 
climaxes by saying, then as I lie reclined on the bosom of my beloved I will read 
the names of captured cities, and will turn mine eyes to gaze at the shafts that were 
hurled by flying horsemen, at the bows of trousered warriors and the captive chiefs 
that sit beneath the arms that once they bore.58  Likewise, at the funeral procession 
of Augustus, which was to pass through the gate of triumph, Tacitus states, the 
names of the nations conquered by Augustus were to be borne in front.59

 Lists of nations in static and enacted propaganda illuminates the account in 
Dio Cass. 67.12.2-4 of Domitian executing Mettius Pompusianus because, among 
other reasons, he had a map of the world painted on the walls of his bed-chamber 
(Cary, LCL).  Domitians reaction emphasizes that geography was not just a 
chronicle of the terrain of the world; it was a symbol of dominancethe subjugation 
of a world previously unknown.60  Geographical depictions were political weapons 
that communicated the subjugation of a world that was wild, mysterious, and 
unknown until the Roman army subjected, measured, and built roads through it.61  
Indeed, coins celebrated this key message of the sovereign narrative with the eagle, 
Roma, Victory, and others standing on the globe,62 which loudly proclaimed: The 
Roman Empire was the ruler of the kings of the earth.63 
 Augustus successors saw it necessary to imitate this same imperial theme, 
thereby connecting themselves to Augustus as well as perpetuating their own 
agendas.  To mention just a few, coins minted in the reign of Tiberius depict Victory 
seated on a globe holding a wreath,64 while in the reign of Caligula, Philo, the 
Hellenistic Jewish Philosopher, exclaimed, Gaius [Caligula], after the death of 
Tiberius Caesar, assuming the sovereignty of the whole world in a condition free

63 For Augustus, even clothing communicated Roman dominance.  In Suet., Aug. 40 (Rolfe,

Romans, lords of the world, the nation clad in the toga  Suetonius concludes, and [Augustus] 
directed the aediles never again to allow anyone to appear in the Forum or its neighbourhood except in 
the toga and without a cloak.

from all sedition.65  Even during the civil wars of 68-69 C.E., the message of 
Roman dominance still rang out amidst the murderous pang of Roman soldiers 
fighting Roman soldiers66a message strongly emphasized in the subsequent 
Flavian dynasty. 
Message #1 in Flavian Propaganda 
 Tacitus describes the unpleasant discovery in 68 C.E. that sent the whole 
Roman world into the chaos of civil war once again: for now had been divulged that 
secret of the empire, that emperors could be made elsewhere than at Rome.67  The 
atrocities that ensued left the entire Roman world longing for security and stability; 
in a single year (69 C.E.), four men claimed the title of emperor.68 So desperate for 
Pax, the people of the empire were even willing to accept a new dynastyeven one 
that lacked familial nobility.69   
The Flavian dynasty commenced in 69 C.E. when Vespasian seized the 
throne, and as a result, the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to a close.70  In order to 
secure imperial power, the Flavian propaganda had to accomplish two key tasks: [1] 
erase the memory of the civil war that brought them power and [2] pronounce 
65 Philo, Legat. 8 (Yonge).  Cf. Sen., Epigr. 29.4. 
66 Coins under Galba depict Roma standing on a globe (RIC 45; 60), and coins under 
Vitellius show Victory standing on the globe (RIC 16). 
67 Tac., Hist. 1.4 (Church and Brodribb); see also 1.50. 
68 Yet, in the middle of this turmoil, coins minted by Otho (RIC 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12) 
and Vitellius (RIC 117; 118; 139; 140; 147; 157) proclaimed PAX and SECURITAS. 
69 Suet., Vesp. 1. 
70 Hereditary progression of the principate was difficult for the Flavian dynasty due to Neros 
disastrous end to the Julio-Claudian dynasty.  For more, see Petit, Pax, 147; Waddy, Pax, 86-87. 
Chapter 3 
restoration of the supremacy of Romesimilar obstacles faced by Augustus when he 
came to power in 31 B.C.E. after the Battle of Actium.71  
 To legitimize the Flavian claim to the Roman throne, the shame of the civil 
war that spilled Roman blood was replaced with the honorable victory over a foreign 
enemy.72  After the suppression of the Jewish revolt in 70 C.E., concluding with the 
destruction of the temple,73 the Flavians began to depict this event as a decisive 
Roman victory over a foreign nationeven celebrating a Roman triumph in 71 C.E. 
over the subjugated Jewish enemy (depicted on the Arch of Titus near the Roman 
Forum).74  Coins minted early in the Flavian reign depict mourning Jewish people 
with captions that announce IUDEA CAPTA.75  As seen below, the Jewish captive 
appears on the Flavian coin bound and in a position of subjugation beneath the 
trophy of arms similar to the barbarian captives in the second Flavian coin 
celebrating the victory of Agricola in Britain in 79-80 C.E.  The Flavian propaganda, 
then, presented the suppression of the Jewish revolt as the foreign military victory 
that contributed to the legitimacy of their claim to the Roman throne.76 
71 For Flavian propaganda that parallels Augustus, see: the placement of the Templum Pacis 
[Norea, Medium, 27]; legal and titular connections to Augustus [Norea, Medium, 27 (n. 20)]; 
statuary [Friesen, Imperial, 176]; and numismatics [Mason Hammond, Res olim dissociabiles: 
Principatus ac Libertas: Liberty under the Early Roman Empire, HSCP 67 (1963): 101-102; and 
idem, A Statue of Trajan Represented on the Anaglypha Traiani, MAAR 21 (1953): 160-161].  For

76 Goodman, Ruling, 235 concurs, Such types, usually issued by Rome only to

 The Flavian propaganda was not complete without the emphatic re-
establishment of the sovereign narrative message that proclaimed: The Roman 
Empire is the ruler of the kings of the earth.  In literature, Josephus recounts Agrippa 
people subjected by the might of Rome.  Also, Norea, 36 and 41 argues that the Flavian Templum 
Pacis was constructed and maintained to emphasize the Jewish conquest as a foreign victory.

IIs plea for the Jews to submit to the Roman powers, Now, when almost all people 
under the sun submit to the Roman arms, will you be the only people that make war 
against them?79  Pliny the Elder, who dedicates Natural History to Titus,80 
proclaims that once again Rome is the Capital of the world (terrarum caput) and 
lauds the prominence of the empire under the Flavians as chosen by the providence 
of the Gods to render even heaven itself more glorious, to unite the scattered empires 
of the earthto become, in short, the mother-country of all nations of the Earth.81  
Moreover, new building constructions changed the horizon of the city of Rome,82 
visually depicting what the words on the Flavian coins heralded: the Resurgence 
and Perpetuation of Rome.83  Thus, under the Flavians, Rome was once again the 
ruler of the world.84  
Conclusion for Message #1 
 The static and enacted propaganda of Rome intended to communicate a 
message of dominance, a message of subjugation, a message that loudly proclaimed 
to the Roman and the non-Roman, to the educated and the uneducated: The Roman 
Empire is the ruler of the kings of the earth.  While Augustus was the architect of this 
grammar, his articulation created the trajectory of imperial propaganda for all future 
emperorseven beyond the first century C.E.85  This message became a key

component to the Roman sovereign narrative saturating the busiest intersections of 
life for the subjects of the empire. 
Message #2:  
The Roman Empire is favored by the gods 
 Dionysius of Halicarnassus (60 B.C.E.-7 B.C.E.) instructs posterity, To 
understand the success of the Romans, you must understand their piety.86  From the 
earliest accounts of Roman society, the collective attitude was religiously oriented, 
and therefore, a key message of their sovereign narrative was: The Roman Empire is 
favored by the gods.  As the Romans wrote to the people of Teos in 193 B.C.E., our 
piety is evident from the favour of the gods which we enjoy.87  The Romans, 
therefore, perceived a causal relationship between their piety and the favor of the 
gods and between the favor of the gods and their success in war.88  For this reason, 
religion and conquest in the Roman Empire were intricately interwoven. 
 A common practice in Roman conquest was to lure or woo the enemy gods 
into the Roman Pantheon to help secure victory.89  Livy recounts a scene from the 
Punic Wars against Hannibal (264 B.C.E.-241 B.C.E.) in which the citizens of Rome, 
eager for the war to conclude, consult the Sibylline Books due to the unusual 
86 Quoted by R.M. Ogilvie, The Romans and Their Gods in the Age of Augustus (London: 
W.W. Norton, 1969), 8.  Although focused on the etymology of piety, Mashkin, Eschatology, 217 
writes, Pietas is an old Roman notion which seems originally to have signified the care and respect 
of the family shrines.

number of showers of stones which had fallen during the year.  The oracles 
announce that whenever a foreign foe should carry war into Italy he could be driven 
out and conquered if the Mater Idaea [Cybele] were brought from Pessinus to 
Rome.  Immediately, the key Roman officials began to plan out a way to bring the 
goddess to Rome in order to secure all the sooner the victory which the Fates, the 
omens, and the oracles alike foreshadowed (Livy 29.10, Roberts).  The success of 
the war, then, was a result of the favor of the gods shown to the Romans. 
 This same belief motivated later Roman rulers to emphasize divine 
associations as justification for their claims to power.  While Julius Caesar accented 
a unique relationship between his family and Venus Genetrix,90 Mark Antony 
fashioned himself as a New Dionysus,91 and, not to be outdone, Octavian 
connected himself with Apollo.92  This development displays the importance of 
divine favor; the connection to the gods consolidated their goodwill (pax deorum) 
which resulted in military success.  So ingrained was this belief in the Roman 
sovereign narrative, decades after the first century C.E., the Christian theologian 
Tertullian, in The Apology 25, denotes: 
However, having been led thus naturally to speak of the Romans, I shall not 
avoid the controversy which is invited by the groundless assertion of those 
who maintain that, as a reward of their singular homage to religion, the 
Romans have been raised to such heights of power as to have become masters 
of the world (ut orbem occuparint); and that so certainly divine are the beings 
they worship, that those prosper beyond all others, who beyond all others 
honour them.  This, forsooth, is the wages the gods have paid the Romans for 
their devotion.93

followed communicated this second key message (causally related to the first): The 
Roman Empire is favored by the gods. 
Message #2 in Imperial PropagandaFrom Augustus to the Flavians 
Heeding the caution of Horace,94 Augustus began a comprehensive 
reconstruction program for the religious buildings in ruin shortly after his victory at 
Actium.  In Res Gestae 20, Augustus boasts the reparation of 82 temples in Rome 
omitting none which at that time stood in need of repair (Shipley, LCL).  In 
addition, he constructed new temples to Jupiter Tonans, Mars Ultor, and even a 
temple to Apollo connected to his residence.95  Augustus continued the religious 
reform by appointing priestly positions and colleges long forgotten and also 
preserving religious works like the Sibylline books.96  These religious actions were 
visual propaganda announcing the restoration of the favor of the gods under 
Augustus, which secured Roman dominance. 
Similarly, the shift from the name Octavian to Augustus carried religious 
and political significance.  Until 28/27 B.C.E., the rising leader went by the name 
Octavian and, at times, Caesarafter his adopted father Julius.  Around this time, 
some suggested he should change his name to Romulus, because he was a second 
94 Horace, Carm. 3.6 (Conington), Your fathers guilt you still must pay, Roman, until you 
have rebuilt the temples and restored all the ruined sanctuaries with their dark images of the gods 
stained with smoke.

founder of the city.97  Initially, the name Romulus was quite appealing to Caesar, 
but when he perceived that this [desire for the name Romulus] caused him to be 
suspected of desiring the kingship,98 Octavian immediately rejected the name.  
Instead, he adopted the more religiously oriented title Augustus, which he attributes 
to the senates gratefulness.99  With linguistic parallels to religiously-oriented 
terms,100 the name Augustus possessed a level of sacred reverence.  Lawrence 
Waddy celebrates, Augustus was the perfect name.  It has all the dignity of His 
Majesty, with an additional religious flavor.  But it does not imply any extravagant 
claim to divinity.101 
In addition to Augustus, another title, which had proved elusive for twenty-
four years, was acquired in 12 B.C.E.Pontifex Maximus.  In 36 B.C.E., Lepidus, 
one-third of the second triumvirate (Octavian and Antony), was exiled while still 
possessing the title, Pontifex Maximus.  Although Augustus desired the title while 
Lepidus was alive,102 Augustus proudly exclaims, I declined to be made Pontifex 
Maximus in succession to a colleague still living [Lepidus].Several years later I 
accepted that sacred office when he at last was dead.103  In celebration, both

religious names (Augustus and Pontifex Maximus) flood Augustan coinage, as seen 
in the coins caption below.104 
With the goddess Pax on the reverse, this static propaganda, and others like it, 
connects the reign of Augustushis building projects, titles, etc.to the favor of the 
gods through his religious devotion.105  As Zanker suggests, His piety was put on 
display for every Roman to see, making it clear that he considered the performance 
of his religious duties his greatest responsibility and highest honor.106   
 The emperors that succeeded Augustus perpetuated this message through 
similar actions and images.  Tiberius continued the temple building projects initiated 
by Augustus.107  Coins under Claudius, Nero, the Flavians, and others depicted the 
gods as the impetus of Roman dominance, with the titles Augustus and Pontifex

105 In Dio Cass. 54.35.2 (Cary, LCL) the senate and the people of Rome attempt to set up 
statues of Augustus.  Instead, he uses the money to set up statues of Salus Publica, Concordia, and 
Pax to emphasize the favor of the gods.  When he did allow statues to be put up of him, Zanker, 
Power, 127 points out, he preferred that statues put up in his honor show him togate at sacrifice or 
prayer.

Maximus, at times, in the caption.108  Even the literature produced after Augustus 
proclaimed the favor of the gods.  In Josephus J.W. 6.33-40, Titus exhorts his 
soldiers to continue to fight against the Jews in their siege of the city of Jerusalem.  
At a key point, in order to make men to forget the hazards they run, (33) Titus 
exclaims:  
for as to our misfortunes, they have been owing to the madness of the 
Jews, while their sufferings have been owing to your valor, and the assistance 
God hath afforded you; for as to the seditions they have been in, and the 
famine they are under, and the siege they now endure, and the fall of their 
walls without our engines, what can they all be but demonstrations of Gods 
anger against them, and of his assistance afforded us? (6.39-40, Whiston)109 
This text, composed under Flavian rule, suggests the Jewish God abandoned his 
people and aligned himself with Rome, which both explains the Roman victory over 
the Jews and perpetuates the message of the empires divine favor. 
Conclusion for Message #2 
From the time of Augustus throughout the first century C.E., imperial 
propaganda claimed that the Roman Empire was the ruler of the kings of the earth 
because Rome was favored by the gods.  As mentioned above, it was Jupiter who 
decreed, For [Rome] I set no bounds in space or time; but have given empire 
without end.110  Thus, the sovereign narrative of Augustus, and therefore the 
emperors that followed, immersed the subjects of the empire in a world of images 
declaring: The Roman Empire is favored by the gods.

Message #3:  
The Roman Empire is the Bearer of Pax 
 The definition of the Pax Romana (Peace of Rome) is usually expressed 
under one of two categories (or a combination of both): [1] lack of war or [2] 
tangible benefits.111  First, Pax Romana as lack of war emerges through a 
comparison to the civil war period before the Battle of Actium.112  As Gary Miles 
notes, The experience of the civil wars was sufficiently shattering that Romans 
emphasized the distinction between pax and discordia, civil war, and identified pax 
simply as the absence of discordia.113  So, it is a lack of civil war that, for some, 
denotes the Pax Romana,114 and, by extension, the absence of fear for the Roman 
that war would overrun his home.115   
The Pax Romana was not the complete cessation of war, but peace through 
foreign war.  As Paul Petit observes, The emperors in fact made war in order to 
further the security of the mother-countryby pushing the frontiers forward the 
Empire had driven the barbarians far from its vital centres.116  Augustus himself 
describes this program of peace through war:  
111 Waddy, Pax, 69 and Petit, Pax, 20 emphasize a time frame in their definitions of Pax 
RomanaWaddy 31 B.C.E.-161 C.E. and Petit 31 B.C.E.-193 C.E.  This definition, however, is 
inextricably linked to the two categories mentioned above (lack of war and tangible benefits); they are 
the criteria by which the time periods are designated the Pax Romana.  For the etymological 
significance of Pax, see Harald Fuchs, Augustin und der antike Friedensgedanke (Berlin: Garland, 
1926), 182ff.

Chapter 3 
I extended the boundaries of all the provinces which were bordered by races 
not yet subject to our empire.  The provinces of the Gauls, the Spains, and 
GermanyI reduced to a state of peace.  The AlpsI brought to a state of 
peace without waging on any tribe an unjust warOn my order and under 
my auspices two armies were led, at almost the same time, into Ethiopia and 
into Arabiaand very large forces of the enemy of both races were cut to 
pieces in battle and many towns were captured.117 
With this definition, there is no contradiction between the idyllic claims of the Pax 
Romana and yet the existence of war.118 
 Other definitions of the Peace of Rome emphasize the tangible benefits for 
those in the Roman Empire with varying nuances.  Some highlight the safety in 
travel, whether by land or by sea.  In regards to the Damascene country, Strabo 
writes, For the most part, indeed, the barbarians have been robbing the merchants 
from Arabia Felix, but this is less the case now that the band of robbers under 
Zenodorus has been broken up through the good government established by the 
Romans and through the security established by the Roman soldiers that are kept in 
Syria.119  Safety in travel directly affects the business of the merchants and stresses 
the economic benefits of the Pax Romana.   
Due to the safety of travel by sea, merchants could transport their goods 
across the empire free from the fear of pirates120 resulting in economic prosperity.  
Suetonius records a unique display of gratitude toward Augustus by merchants at 
Puteoli:

the Roman empire.

Chapter 3 
As [Augustus] sailed by the gulf of Puteoli, it happened that from an 
Alexandrian ship which had just arrived there, the passengers and crew, clad 
in white, crowned with garlands, and burning incense, lavished upon him 
good wishes and the highest praise, saying that it was through him they lived, 
through him that they sailed the sea, and through him that they enjoyed their 
liberty and their fortune.121 
As Klaus Wengst notes, Compared with all that the then world knew of its past, this 
state of affairs must have seemed to all those alive at the time to be the golden 
age.122   
Indeed, as the civil wars concluded at the Battle of Actium, the world was 
transformed by the reign of Augustus so that even the earth seemed excited to 
celebrate through its abundance.  As Velleius Paterculus commemorates, The civil 
wars were ended after twenty years, foreign wars suppressed, peace restored, the 
frenzy of arms everywhere lulled to restAgriculture returned to the fields, respect 
to religion, to mankind freedom from anxiety, and to each citizen his property rights 
were now assured.123  This peace, however, was not merely the machinations of 
man, but the Romans regarded it to be the result of the favor the gods (pax 
deorum).124 Ovid merrily relates the emergence of the dominance of Rome: Add 
incense, ye priests, to the flames that burn on the altar of Peace, let a white victim 
fall with cloven brow, and ask of the gods, who lend a favouring ear to pious prayers, 
that the house, which is the warranty of peace, with peace may last for ever.125  It is 
understandable, then, to see the Pax deorum as made manifest in the Pax Romana

Romana: A Different View, BASOR 265 (1987): 40 for Romes interaction with raiding nomadic

which, due to Augustan propaganda, was also the Pax Augusta.126  Therefore, central 
to the sovereign narrative and Augustan propaganda was the message: The Roman 
Empire is the bearer of Pax. 
Message #3 in Augustan Propaganda 
Dio Cassius recounts the events following the Battle of Actium as frenzied 
excitement.  The announcement of victory was heralded by a frantic soldier who ran 
up to the temple on the Capitol and laid his sword at the feet of Jupiter, to signify that 
there would be no further use for it.127  The Res Gestae and other literature 
contemporary with Augustus depict the same propagandathe Roman Empire is the 
bearer of Pax.128   
Regarding Augustan numismatics, G.E.F. Chilver remarks, the clearest 
boast of Augustan coins and messages lies in the bringing of Pax, an end to civil 
bloodshed and to party strife,129 which reflects the message found on inscriptions 
across the empire proclaiming, Perpetual Peace and Concord in Augustus.130  In 
addition to the dedication of the Ara Pacis Augustae altar on the Campus Martius,131

Augusta.132  This static propaganda saturated the empire under Augustus with the 
message of Roman Pax.   
The enacted propaganda associated with the temple of Janus proclaimed the 
same message.  Assumed to have originated under the second king of Rome Numa 
Pompilius (715 B.C.E.-673 B.C.E.),133 a sacred ritual, rarely implemented in the time 
before Augustus, involved the closing of the doors of the temple of Janus, symbolic 
of the cessation of war.134  In Ovid, Janus proudly describes his authority:  
Whateer you see anywheresky, sea, clouds, earthall things are closed 
and opened by my hand.  The guardianship of this vast universe is in my 
hands alone, and none but me may rule the wheeling pole.  When I choose to 
send forth Peace from tranquil halls, she freely walks the ways unhindered. 
But with blood and slaughter the whole world would welter, did not the bars 
unbending hold the barricaded wars. I sit at heavens gate with the gentle 
Hours; my office regulates the goings and comings of Jupiter himself.  Janus 
is my name.135 
The closing of the temple of Janus, therefore, proclaimed universal peace, and in the 
reign of Augustus, the doors were said to have been closed on at least three 
occasions.136  Augustus proudly states, Janus Quirinius, which our ancestors ordered 
to be closed whenever there was peace, secured by victory, throughout the whole 
domain of the Roman people on land and sea, and which, before my birth is recorded 
to have been closed but twice in all since the foundation of the city, the senate

unbroken peace.

ordered to be closed thrice while I was princeps.137  This enacted propaganda 
enforced the message of the sovereign narrative that Rome was the divine agent of 
 The static and enacted propaganda of other emperors reiterated the same 
Augustan message of Pax.  Imitating Augustus, Nero, upon receiving the Arsacid 
prince Tiridates with lavish displays of supplication, announced that no war was left 
anywhere by closing the doors to the temple of Janus.138  In addition to other static 
propaganda (like inscriptions),139 the numismatic evidence portrays the same 
captions and imagery found on Augustan coins.  As seen below, this coin from 
Claudius displays on the obverse his image with the typical legend titles that include 
Augustus and Pontifex Maximus among others.  The reverse depicts a Pax-
Nemesis holding a winged caduceus just above a serpent on the ground.  Around her 
is the caption: PACI AVGVSTAE (Augustan Peace).140  Ironically, similar images 
and captions appear on coins minted by emperors in the civil war of 68-69 C.E.141

Like other civil war emperors, the Flavians heralded the Peace of Rome as well but 
with a heightened intensity not implemented since the time of Augustus. 
Message #3 in the Flavian Propaganda 
 The message of Pax inundated Flavian Propaganda as a seemingly intentional 
response to the chaos of the civil wars through which they came to power.142  Like 
Augustus after the Battle of Actium, it was essential to construct a public image 
stressing the rejection of discordia (civil war) and pronouncing the cessation of 
war.  As many scholars have pointed out, the depiction of Pax was widely distributed 
throughout the imperial world on Flavian coinage,143 and at times highlighted other 
related themes like hope and stability.144  A Domitianic coin struck in 85 C.E. 
142 See pp. 110-113 above.

Ramage, Denigration of Predecessor under Claudius, Galba, and Vespasian, ZAG 32.2 (1983): 211 
states, Pax is a dominant theme in Vespasian's propaganda, and it appears in six different forms on 
his coins (Pax, Pax Augusta, Pax Augusti, Pax Orbis Terrarum Augusta, Pax Populi Romani, Pacis 
Eventum).  M.C. Bishop, A New Flavian Military Site at Roecliffe, North Yorkshire, Britannia 36

military site in Roecliffe, North Yorkshire.

shows an ardent depiction of the goddess Pax on the reverse setting fire to a pile of 
weapons.145 
 Parallel to Augustus, the Flavians named regions Pax146 and closed the 
doors to the temple of Janus after the victory over the Jewish nation.147  Vespasian 
intensified his focus on the Pax propaganda by building the Templum Pacis 
(Temple of Peace) in the center of Romestarted in 71 and dedicated in 75.148  
Enthusiastically, contemporary literature149 and various public and private 
inscriptions praised the return of Pax to Rome.150  Whether static or enacted, the

Flavian propaganda joined in unison with the Augustan sovereign narrative: Under 
the Flavians, Rome was the divine agent of Pax. 
Conclusion for Message #3 
 For the purposes of this chapter, it matters little if the Pax Romana was actual 
or fictional, accessible to everyone or limited, benevolent or malevolent.151  What is 
significant, however, is that the imperial billboards from Augustus onward presented 
a world of imagery to their subjects that depicted the cessation of war and abundant 
benefits for those within the boundaries of the empire.  In other words, a key 
message of Romes Sovereign Narrative was: The Roman Empire is the bearer of 
The Sovereign Narrative of Rome: 
Three Messages Made One 
 Although, for the most part, this chapter has examined all three messages of 
the Roman sovereign narrative separately, the three messages are intricately woven 
together into a single unit in the sovereign narrative.  Indeed, each message 
reinforces and relies on the other twofor in the sovereign narrative, the Roman 
Empire is the ruler of the kings of the earth [#1], because it has secured the favor of 
the gods [#2].  This favor of the gods [#2] is evident in the Roman Empires ability 
to secure and perpetuate Pax [#3] through their military dominance [#1].  All three 
messages of the Roman sovereign narrative coalesce in a powerful depiction of 
enacted propaganda known as Roman triumphal processions. 
151 Richard Bauckham, The Economic Critique of Rome in Revelation 18, in Images of 
Empire (ed. Loveday Alexander; Sheffield: Sheffield, 1991), 55-56 exclaims, The Pax Romana is 
really a system of economic exploitation of the empire.  Romes subjects give far more to her than she 
gives to them.  The statement above does not necessarily disagree with this assessment; this just falls 
outside of the scope of this chapter. 
Chapter 3 
Enacted Propaganda: Roman Triumphal Processions 
 As one of the sweetest fruits of war and of peace,152 the Roman triumphal 
procession, or Roman triumph, was the climax of honor for the victor and the climax 
of humiliation for the conquered.  During the parade, the plebs of the city would 
flood the streets to catch a glimpse of the spoils of war (foreign armor, unusual 
animals, and unfamiliar peoples) symbolizing the victory and dominance of Rome.  
Along with the bound captive leader(s) and the magnificent quadriga,153 the 
emperors glory was celebrated in the enactment of the sovereign narrative by the 
entire empire.   
The Roman triumphal procession was such effective enacted propaganda the 
participants replicated its impact in static propaganda as well.  The Fasti 
Triumphalesan inscription on stone tablets in the Roman Forum from ca. 12 
B.C.E.enshrined over two-hundred triumphs from Romes foundation to the time 
of Augustus, beginning with King Romulus, son of Mars in 753 B.C.E.154  
Augustus, in addition to limiting triumphs to the imperial house,155 celebrated three 
152 Chariton, Chaer. 8.1.12 quoted in Douglas R. Edwards, Surviving the Web of Roman 
Power: Religion and Politics in the Acts of the Apostles, Josephus, and Charitons Chaereas and 
Callirhoe, in Images and Empire (ed. Loveday Alexander; Sheffield: Sheffield, 1991), 196. 
153 The quadriga, the triumphants chariot normally pulled by four horses, became a stock 
symbol for the Roman triumph as a whole.  Res gest. divi Aug. 35 relays the statue in the Forum 
Augustum of a quadriga erected in honor of Augustus by the senate and inscribed with the title Pater 
Patriae.  Similarly, coins struck throughout the reign of Augustus and the emperors that followed

triumphs and boasted the modest refusal of countless more.156  In addition, he used 
this enacted propaganda as a weapon in his static propagandalittering the empire 
with symbols of Roman triumphs.157   
The ensuing emperors followed this same pattern: a limited number of 
triumphal processions that spared no expense and yet liberal use of triumphal 
imagery throughout the empire.  For example, Tiberius celebrated a triumph over 
Pannonia in 12 C.E.  The magnificent celebration even finds its way to the ears of 
Ovid in exile on the Black Sea.  In great detail, the estranged poet writes: 
Even to this place has the fame of Caesars triumph penetrated.Thanks, 
Fame, to thee through whom I, prisoned among the Getae, have seen the 
splendor of the triumph.  By thy evidence I learned that recently countless 
races assembled to see their leaders face; and Rome, that embraces the 
measureless world within her vast walls, scarce had room for her guests.  
Thou didst tell mehow the victor, honouring them with a loud voice, 
bestowed the warlike gifts upon the heroes he praisedhow wherever he 
went, he received the happy omen of applause and the pavement blushed with 
dewy roses.  Before him, silver counterparts of the conquered walls, 
barbarian towns were carried with pictured men upon them, rivers and 
mountains and battles in deep forests, shields and spears in a confused pile, 
and from the gold of the trophies kindled by the sun, the buildings of the 
Roman forum turned to gold.  So many chieftains bore chains upon their 
vanquished necks that they could almost suffice to be the enemy.The same 
report told me, Germanicus, that towns moved on under the title of thy name; 
that against thee they had been secure neither by massive walls nor arms nor 
skillful site.  Gods grant thee years158

procession was so significant that it saturated the empire.  It is no surpise, then, that 
as Suetonius reports, Claudius attacked Briton simply because he desired the glory 
of a legitimate triumph.162  Nor is it surpising that the Flavians chose precisely the 
Roman triumph in 71 C.E. to mark the definitive announcement of the new dynasty 
in Rome.163   
What made the Roman triumphal procession so significant was its ability to 
combine all three key messages into one coherent spectacle of enacted propaganda.  
Several features of the elaborate parade communicate this message.  First, the 
procession of the spoils of war was a distinctive element, celebrated in the Ovid 
quote above, in which the plunder called attention to the glory attained in battle.  In 
Augustuss triumph in 29 B.C.E.a three-day affair to celebrate victories over 
Illyrium, Egypt, and the Battle of ActiumDio Cassius recounts, Now all the 
processions proved notable, thanks to the spoils from Egyptin such quantities, 
indeed, had spoils been gathered there that they sufficed for all the processionsbut 
the Egyptian celebration surpassed them all in costliness and magnificence.164  
Moreover, lists of lands conquered and even depictions of key moments in 
the battle were interspersed throughout the procession.  Describing different

triumphs, Pliny lists thirty names and representations of towns and regions,165 Livy 
describes 134 model towns,166 and Tacitus describes various representations of 
the mountains, the rivers and battles.167  In each triumph, the lists announced the 
dominance of Rome as ruler of the kings of the earth.168 
In the Flavian Roman triumph in 71 C.E., Josephus affords the greatest 
surprise of all to the magnificent depictions of many resemblances of the war that 
offered a most lively portraiture of itself.169  He details the representations:  
For there was to be seen a happy country laid waste, and entire squadrons of 
enemies slain; while some of them ran away, and some were carried into 
captivity; with walls of great altitude and magnitude overthrown and ruined 
by machines; with the strongest fortifications taken, and the walls of most 
populous cities upon the tops of hills seized on, and an army pouring itself 
with the walls; as also every place full of slaughter, and supplication of the 
enemiesFire also sent upon temples was here represented, and houses 
overthrown, and falling upon their owners.170 
Josephus concludes by emphasizing the purpose of this enacted propaganda, Now 
the workmanship of these representations was so magnificent and lively in the 
construction of the things, that it exhibited what had been done to such as did not see 
it, as if they had been there really present.171  Thus, these depictions did not just 
invite the onlooker to view the sovereign narrative, but to participate in it.

 Another significant feature of the Roman triumph was the enemy prisoners 
paraded amongst the plunder and depictions of their defeat.  Due to its importance, 
both the volume and the quality of the prisoners garnered attention.  So, Ovid lauds 
that there were so many chieftains chained by their vanquished necks that they 
could almost suffice to be the enemy, and Josephus narrates Fronto dividing the 
prisoners for Titus, in which he chose out the tallest and most beautiful, and 
reserved them for the triumph.172   
This portions popularity is evident in the amount of iconography rendering 
conquered barbarian prisoners, often bound in chains.  The bound captive(s) 
decorates theater curtains, temple friezes, imperial columns, ornate lamps, and 
coinage.173  Indeed, in the lower register of the Gemma Augustea cameo (early first 
century C.E.), a bound captive sits in the left corner under the victory trophy being 
hoisted by four men.  In the right corner, a prisoner bows in entreaty as the woman 
above him is dragged by the hair.

Chapter 3 
 The critical element for the Roman triumphexceeding the plunder, the lists 
of conquered lands, the depictions of battle, and the enemy soldierswas the 
procession of the chief enemy leader bound in chains.175  This element was so 
important that upon Antonys death after the Battle of Actium, Augustus grew 
anxious not only to get possession of [Cleopatras] treasures but also to seize her 
alive and to carry her back for his triumph.176  At Cleopatras death, Augustus not 
only viewed her body but also attempted to revive her.177  When all attempts of 
resuscitation failed, Caesar excessively grieved on his own account, as if he had 
been deprived of all the glory of his victory.178  Augustuss reaction reflects the 
words of Velleius Paterculus, Reports do not relate how the most eminent leaders of 
the enemy were slain in battle, but rather how the triumph displayed them, in 
chains.179 
 Still further, the Roman triumph attributed these features to divine favor.  Far 
from incidental, Augustuss triumph in 29 B.C.E. coincided with the dedication of 
the temple of the Divine Julius, whose apotheosis is depicted on the Belvedere altar 
in triumphal procession imagery.180  Again, the procession concluded on the steps of 
the temple of Jupiter, at which point the key enemy leader was executed as an

offering to the gods.181  Indeed, the Roman triumph was a celebration heralding the 
promise of the divine gift of victory. 
The Roman triumph is a collision of both static and enacted propaganda 
melding the three key messages of the Roman sovereign narrative into one fluid 
experience.  For the spoils of war, the geographical depictions, and the bound 
captives invite the viewer to partake in a world in which the Roman Empire is the 
ruler of the kings of the earth because they are favored by the gods, which is evident 
by the blessings of the universal Pax that are sure to follow. 
Conclusion 
The sovereign narrative of Rome proclaimed three key messages: [1] The 
Roman Empire is the ruler of the kings of the earth; [2] The Roman Empire is 
favored by the gods; and [3] The Roman Empire is the bearer of Pax.  At locations of 
intersection, Rome positioned imperial billboards (both static and enacted 
propaganda) to saturate their subjects with the sovereign narrativean ever-present 
message communicated through imagery understandable by the educated and 
uneducated alike.   
While the Roman sovereign narrative was resisted by some182 and at times 
even contradicted reality,183 this analysis appreciates how the sovereigns viewed

land, they rifle the sea.  If the enemy be rich, they are rapacious; if he be poor, they lust for dominion; 
neither the east nor the west has been able to satisfy them.  Alone among men they covet with equal 
eagerness poverty and riches.  To robbery, slaughter, plunder, they give the lying name of empire; 
they make a wasteland and call it peace (Tac., Agr. 30, Church and Brodribb).  Cf. 2 Esd 10.60-

184 As Deissmann, Light, 340 surmises, It must not be supposed that St. Paul and his fellow-
believers went through the world blindfolded, unaffected by what was then moving the minds of men 
in great cities.  Likewise, in her work on interactions second-century Christian writers and the 
Roman world, Nasrallah, Christian Responses, 1 states, When second-century Christians penned 
their thoughts, they usually wrote from cities crowded with monumental buildings whose erection was 
funded by emperors and elites.  These Christian apologists were concerned with themes of justice, 
power, culture, and ethnicity; they wrote about how the world around them blurred the lines between 
human and divine, and how it defined piety and proper religious behavior.  In the streets, Christians 
and their neighbors were jostled amid a growing population of statues that depicted the wealthy and 
powerful as gods, or nearly so.  Christians among others crowded into agoras and forums full of 
architecture that proclaimed the triumph of the Roman Empire.  See also Friesen, Imperial, 53-55;

Chapter 4: 
The Date of the Book of Revelation pt. 1: 
The External and Internal Evidence 
When the Revelation is stripped of actual 
historical references we are tempted to conclude 
that it is merely an expression of a mood or an 
eccentric worldview and is not about 
anything.1 
Revelations socio-historical context must be established to detect particular 
inflections of the imperial dialogue therein.  While the Roman Empires sovereign 
narrative is an important step forward, the date of Revelation offers further clarity to 
the Alter-Imperial paradigm.  Since the subject narrative engages the sovereign 
narrative through points of conversation, the different nuances and articulations of 
the Roman sovereign narrative by the various emperors must be respected.  Thus, 
Revelations date of composition elucidates the subject imagerys interaction with 
contemporary imperial propaganda.2 
 There are two primary options for the date of the Apocalypse: the early-date 
(pre-70 C.E.) and the late-date (92-96 C.E.).3  Throughout the majority of the 
nineteenth century, the scholarly community rallied behind the pre-70 C.E. date for 
Revelation4 articulated by the Cambridge trio: F. J. A. Hort, B. F. Westcott, and J. B.

Lightfoot.5  Generally speaking, this early-date option thought Revelation was 
written in response to the Neronic persecutions of the mid-60s C.E. and in 
preparation for the destruction of the temple in 70 C.E.  While the specific emperor 
varies, early-date advocates agree that the Apocalypse was written in the pre-70 C.E. 
time period.6 
 Historically, though, the early-date option was not the dominant position of 
the church.  As David Aune points out, From the late second century A.D. until the 
nineteenth century, and again (after the interval of a century of criticism) in the 
twentieth century, the prevailing opinion has been that Revelation was written 
toward the end of the reign of the Roman emperor Domitian.7  Indeed, the vast

External Evidence: Early Christian Witness 
 While some early testimonies differ,9 the early Christian witness 
overwhelmingly supports the late-date option of Revelation (92-96 C.E.), including: 
Clement of Alexandria (ca. 150-215/17 C.E.),10 Origen (ca. 185-254 C.E.),11 
Victorinus of Pettau (ca. 270 C.E.),12 Eusebius (ca. 263-339),13 Jerome (ca. 347-
420),14 and others.15  The earliest and most significant voice is Irenaeus (d. 202 
C.E.).16   
Born in ca. 125 C.E. in the city of Smyrna (Rev 2:8-11), Irenaeus wrote 
Adversus Haereses (ca. 180 C.E.).  In 5.30.3, he states: 
We will not, however, incur the risk of pronouncing positively as to

16 Irenaeus is the earliest and most important voice in the external witness debate.  While 
some may think that other external witnesses should be considered at length, in every significant 
discussion on Revelations date, scholars (both early- and late-date advocates) center on Irenaeus, 
often times not even mentioning the existence of other external witnesses [Thompson, Revelation, 15;

no very long time since, but almost in our day, towards the end of 
Domitians reign.17 
This statement interests both ends of the date of Revelation spectrum.  The late-
date supporters posit this passage as evidence for Domitians reign; the early-date 
advocates criticize Irenaeus on two accounts: authorship and grammar. 
 As first suggested by John A. T. Robinson,18 early-date advocates argue that 
Irenaeus dating of Revelation is unreliable since he mistakenly equates the author of 
Johns Gospel with Revelations author.19  This argument is challenged with four 
points of clarification.20  First, the identity of the authors may have been confused 
due to the frequency of the name John in the ancient world.  This type of 
confusion, however, is drastically different than asserting the Apocalypse was 
composed at the end of the reign of Domitian (92-96 C.E.) when in fact it was 
written twenty-five to thirty years earlier.  Such a shift has no defense.  Similarly, if 
Irenaeus only knew of the name John for the author of Revelation (Rev 1:1, 4, 9; 
22:8), the apostle John would not be an illogical assumption.  Again, this 
conclusion differs significantly from the assertion that Irenaeus knew the Apocalypse 
was written at the end of the reign of some emperor and then arbitrarily selected 
Domitian.  The former follows general canonicity trajectories while the latter 
completely fabricates historical details. 
17 Irenaeus, Haer. 5.30.3 (Roberts).  The Greek is preserved in Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 3.18.3 
and 5.8.6.

20 The following is indebted to lines of argumentation found in Adela Yarbro Collins, 
Dating the Apocalypse of John, BR 26 (1981): 33-34. 
Chapter 4 
 Third, Irenaeus attributes the date to the reign of Domitian in spite of the 
difficulty of the apostle Johns advanced age.  This adds credibility to his suggestion, 
even if the author happens to be mistaken.  As Collins suggests, this implies that he 
had independent and strong evidence for the date.21  Fourth, if complete accuracy of 
every detail is the litmus test for the validity of every other detail given by an ancient 
historian and their overall usefulness to reconstruct history, then no reliable historical 
works would remain in any area of study.  No ancient author would be spared from 
such a ludicrous standard of evaluation.  The authorship objection, therefore, 
proves untenable and does not jettison Irenaeus as a legitimate historical authority on 
the dating of Revelation. 
 The second objection to Irenaeus refers to the texts grammar at Haer. 5.30.3 
(see above).  Some suggest that what was seen refers to John himself and not the 
Apocalypse.  In other words, Irenaeus states that John lived to Domitians time, not 
that Revelation was written at that time.  Both Latin22 and Greek23 texts need to be 
examined to establish the efficacy of this argument. 
 The key terms for Latin and Greek, respectively, are visum est and .  
While the closest antecedent to visum est in the Latin is the Apocalypse 
(apocalypsim), the feminine ending on apocalypsim necessitates visa est if the author 
intends to refer to the document alone.24  A similar problem occurs if visum est refers 
21 Collins, Dating, 34; idem, Crisis, 56. 
22 Irenaeus, Haer. 5.30.3: si oporteret manifeste praesenti tempore praeconari nomen ejus, 
per ipsum utique dictum fuisset qui et apocalypsim viderat: neque enim ante multum temporis visum 
est, sed pene sub nostro saeculo ad finem Domitiani imperii.

Chapter 4 
to John (masculine), because the grammar demands visus est in order for this to be 
the sole referent.  Instead, Aune points out that visum est refers to the nomen of the 
Antichrist.25  With this referent, the Latin translates, For [the name of the 
Antichrist] was not seen long ago, but almost in our own time, at the end of the reign 
of Domitian.  This Latin translation supports the late date of the Apocalypse.  The 
name of the Antichrist refers to Irenaeus immediate context discussing the textual 
issue of 666 from the Apocalypse.  Understanding this difficulty, J. Stolt suggests a 
corruption of the Latin text and, therefore, asserts, without any textual evidence, that 
it originally read visus est.26 
 The antecedent objection is also applied to the Greek .  The 
argument is that  does not refer to the end of Domitians reign as Revelations 
date but as the time in which John was living.27  To such an objection, two responses 
can be made.  First, Aune posits that the passive he/she/it was seen is an 
inappropriate way to describe the length of a persons life; it is much more likely 
that  means it [i.e., the Apocalypse] was seen, referring to the time when 
the Apocalypse was seen by John of Patmos.28  Significantly, J. A. T. Robinson, 
an early-date advocate, affirms this Greek translation and the traditional reading of 
Irenaeus: the referent is the Apocalypse and not John.29

Chapter 4 
Second, the context in which Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 3.17-18 quotes Irenaeus, 
Haer. 5.30.3 (in Greek) suggests  refers to the Apocalypse.  In Hist. eccl. 
3.17, Eusebius describes Domitians cruel punishment of Romes notable men.  In 
comparison to Neros persecution of the Christians, Eusebius states that Domitian 
was the second to promote persecution against us (Lake, LCL).  After recording 
Vespasians absolution of any similar persecutions, Eusebius suggests that in 
Domitians persecution the Apostle and Evangelist John was still alive, and was 
condemned [by Domitian] to live in the island of Patmos for his witness to the divine 
word.30  Eusebius then offers Irenaeus, Haer. 5.30.3 as evidence for this tradition.  
Subsequently, Eusebius argues that Domitianic persecutions are also described in 
non-Christian writings.31  Therefore, Eusebius does not see  as a reference to 
the life-span of John; he interprets  as a reference to the Apocalypse received 
on the island of Patmos by John during a period of persecution under Domitian.32 
Thus, there are no adequate reasons to disregard the traditional interpretation 
of Irenaeus, Haer. 5.30.3the book of Revelation was composed on the island of 
Patmos at the end of Domitians reign.33  The evidence of the early Christian witness 
to the date of Revelation, therefore, is overwhelmingly in favor of the late-date 
30 Hist. eccl. 3.18 (Lake, LCL).  The last phrase for his witness to the divine word is an 
allusion to Rev 1:9. 
31 Eusebius offers the account of Flavius Clement and Flavia Domitilla as evidence (cf. Dio 
Cass. 67.14).

Chapter 4 
tradition (92-96 C.E.).  To quote F. J. A. Hort, an early-date proponent, If external 
evidence alone could decide, there would be a clear preponderance for Domitian.34 
Internal Evidence: Attempts to Overturn the External Evidence 
 The early Christian witness to the late-date option could be legitimately 
overturned if the internal evidence decidedly concludes a different composition date.  
Consequently, two questions guide the analysis of Revelations internal evidence: [1] 
Does the internal evidence demand a specific date? and [2] Is there enough internal 
evidence to overturn the late-date presented by the external evidence?35  This section 
focuses on the three most influential texts for early-date advocates: Revelation 11:1-
2; 13:18; and 17:9-11. 
Revelation 11:1-2Measuring the Temple 
 In Revelation 11:1-2, the Seer receives a reed and the instruction to, Rise 
and measure the temple () of God and the altar and the ones worshiping in it.  
But jettison the courtyard outside of the temple and do not measure it, because it was 
given to the nations.  They will trample the holy city for 42 months.36  Early-date 
advocates argue that this admonition to measure the temple is clear evidence that 
the Apocalypse was composed before the temple was destroyed (i.e., Pre-70 C.E.).37  
From this perspective, this text not only confirms the books early date but also the 
34 Hort, Apocalypse, xx.  See also Charles, Revelation, 1:xcii; Rowland, Heaven, 403-404
an early-date advocate. 
35 Wilson, Problem, 597 ebulliently exclaims, The abundance of internal evidence to the 
contrary clearly outweighs the opinion of Irenaeus.  See also Robinson, Redating, 221. 
36 Unless otherwise noted, all New Testament citations are my own translations from the 
Greek text NA28. 
37 So Robinson, Redating, 238-242; Robert A. Briggs, Jewish Temple Imagery in the Book of 
Revelation (New York: Peter Lang, 1999), 24.  However, Rowland, Heaven, 429, an early-date 
advocate, concludes, ...John is not here [Rev 11:1-2] dealing with an actual building but the temple 
as a symbol of a greater reality. 
Chapter 4 
books purpose: to prepare the Christian community for the imminent destruction of 
the temple in Jerusalem.38  Nevertheless, four lines of argumentation suggest a 
different conclusion to the imagery. 
 First, in Revelation, temple () imagery always refers to a heavenly temple 
accessible only to God and his faithful followers (including angels).  In Revelation 
3:12, the church in Philadelphia is told, I will make the one conquering ( ) a 
pillar in the temple () of my God [in heaven].  In 7:15, the great multitude in 
heaven worship before the throne of God day and night in his [heavenly] temple 
().  After the seventh trumpet in 11:19 (the same chapter as the text in question), 
the temple () of God in heaven is opened revealing the ark of his covenant.  
Again, in 14:15, 17 and 15:5, 6, 8, the temple is specifically labeled as being in 
heaven (14:17; 15:5), but this time, angels emerge from it with commands (14:15) 
and tools (15:6) for judgment.  In 16:1, a loud voice comes from the same 
heavenly temple commanding the seven angels to pour out the seven bowls of 
judgment on the earth.  After the final bowl (16:17), the same voice from the 
heavenly temple (16:1) declares, It is done  Finally,  occurs in Revelation 
21:22 in reference to the new heaven and the new earth, I did not see a temple 
() in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple (). 
 In Revelation,  consistently designates: a heavenly temple only accessible 
to God and his faithful followers (including angels).  If Revelation 11:1-2, then, 
refers to a temple on earth in the city of Jerusalem before its destruction in 70 C.E., it 
38  Westcott, Gospel, lxxxvii.  Cf. Craig S. Keener, Revelation (NIVAC; Grand Rapids: 
Zondervan, 2000), 36; Judith Kovacs and Christopher Rowland, Revelation: The Apocalypse of Jesus 
Christ (Oxford: Blackwell, 2004), 122-126. 
Chapter 4 
would be anomalous at best and careless at worst.  Instead, the temple in Revelation 
11:1-2 should be regarded with the same definition of  found everywhere else in 
the Apocalypse: a heavenly temple only accessible to God and his faithful followers 
(including angels).39 
 Second, the predominant parallel to the imagery of Revelation 11:1-2 is 
Ezekiel 40-48.40  In the preceding contexts of these two passages, both seers are 
commanded to eat a scroll (Ezek 3:1-3; Rev 10:9)41 and to deliver a prophetic 
message to Gods people (Ezek 3:4; Rev 10:11).  After a symbolic action 
communicates the message in both passages,42 a striking shift occurs between the 
two texts.  In Ezekiel 4:1-17, the prophet constructs a representation of Jerusalem 
under siege, foreshadowing the proclamations of impending judgment on the city 
(Ezek 5-12) and the destruction of the temple.43  The logical progression for the 
imagery and language of Revelation 11:1-2, then, would seem to parallel Ezekiel 4 
and the context that follows: the siege and destruction of the city and temple of 
Jerusalem.  This progression would strongly support the early-date interpretation and 
purpose of Revelation: to prepare Christians for the siege and destruction of the city

Chapter 4 
and temple of Jerusalem (66-70 C.E.).  But instead, Johns language and imagery in 
Revelation 11:1-2 parallels Ezekiel 40-48. 
 In both passages, the temple is measured (Rev 11:1; Ezek 40:3b 
[LXX]) by an agent of God (an angelic figure in Ezek 40:5bf. and John in Rev 11:1).  
Both agents are given a reed (Rev 11:1a; Ezek 40:3b [LXX]) as the 
measuring device for the temple.  In both passages, the measuring of the temple 
communicates the security and safety provided by Gods presence.44 Significantly, in 
Ezekiel 40-48, the temples measurement is envisioned when no temple in Jerusalem 
existed; it had been destroyed for over a decade.45  So why would Revelation 11:1-2 
bypass Ezekiel 4 and instead parallel Ezekiel 40-48?  The answer to this question 
comes in another parallel with Ezekiel: John is told to measure the temple at a time 
when the temple did not exist.46 
Third, the title the holy city (   ) in Revelation 11:2 
distinguishes this image from the great city (   ) in 11:8, 
referring to Jerusalem.  Specifically, the great city connotes rebelliousness against 
God whereas the holy city indicates faithfulness.  In 16:19, the seventh bowl is 
poured out and the great city (   ) splits into three parts collapsing 
the cities of the nations.  The next phrase is, Babylon the Great was remembered 
by God who gave her the wine cup of his fury and wrath.  Rebellious Babylon and 
the great city are connected throughout the Apocalypse.  In 17:18, the harlot is 
defined as the great city (   ) and in 18:10, 16, and 18 the kings of 
44 See Rev 21:15-17, 27; 2 Sam 8:2; Isa 28:16-17; Jer 31:38-40; Zech 1:16; Ezek 43:1-12.

Chapter 4 
the earth, the merchants, and the seaman all lament, Woe, woe, the great city ( 
  ), Babylon the strong city47  Climactically, in 18:21, a mighty angel 
proclaims everlasting judgment on Babylon the great city (  ).  While 
the city differs in Revelation 11:8 (the great city [   ] which 
is symbolically called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified),48 
rebellion against God is still present. 
The moniker the holy city, however, carries the opposite meaning: 
faithfulness to God.  After Revelation 11:2, the title is found in Revelation 21:2, 
And I saw the holy city (   ), the new Jerusalem, coming down out 
of heaven from God having been prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.  
Again, in 21:10, John describes, And [The angel] showed me the holy city ( 
  ), Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.  The final 
occurrence of the holy city is in 22:19, And if anyone might take away from the 
words of this book of prophecy, God will take away his share of the tree of life and 
the holy city (   ).  Thus, every occurrence of the holy city 
connotes intimacy and faithfulness to God in contradistinction to the rebelliousness 
of the great city. 
The incongruity of these two titles throughout Revelation suggests a sharp 
distinction between the image of 11:2 (the holy city) and the image of 11:8 (the 
great city).  Since 11:8 clearly states that the great city is where also their Lord 
was crucified (i.e., Jerusalem), the holy city in 11:2 is not the city of Jerusalem.  
47 Rev 18:10.  Rev 18:16, 18 each begin with Woe, woe, the great city. but do not 
include Babylon the strong city, although the referent is still Babylon.  In Rev 18:18, the seaman 
ask, What city is like the great city? 
48 Emphasis added. 
Chapter 4 
This further deteriorates the early-date assertion that Revelation 11:1-2 mandates a 
standing temple in the city of Jerusalem on the precipice of siege and destruction at 
the time of Revelations composition. 
Fourth, disregarding the previous three arguments, even if Revelation 11:1-2 
referred to the temples destruction, why would this necessitate a shift in 
Revelations date?  For example, Revelation 12 depicts a pregnant woman crying out 
in pain about to give birth (12:2).  Her child, whom the dragon rapaciously awaits 
(12:4b), is identified as the Messiah in 12:5: And she gave birth to a son, a male 
child, who will rule all the nations with an iron rod.49  This portrayal of Jesus birth, 
however, does not demand a date for the Apocalypse around the trek to Bethlehem.50  
Similarly, if Revelation 11:1-2 does depict the destruction of the temple, which is 
unlikely, a date change is still not necessary.51 
In sum, the early-date conclusion that Revelation 11:1-2 proves the temple in 
Jerusalem was still standing when the Apocalypse was composed is highly unlikely.  
The analysis of  in Revelation, the parallels to Ezekiel 40-48, the designation 
the holy city, and the alleged historical allusions unnecessary shift in date 
demonstrate that Revelation 11:1-2 is inadequate to overturn the late-date option of 
the early Christian witnesses.

Revelation 13:17b-18666 and Emperor Nero52 
 A second key text for early-date advocates is Revelation 13:17b-18.53  In this 
text, the enigmatic number 666 is equated to the name of the beast or the number of 
his name.54  Following other scholars,55 early-date supporters link 666 to Caesar 
Nero through gematria.  Transliterating the Greek form of Caesar Neron into 
Hebrew (56,(  the numerical value of each Hebrew letter is added together 
resulting in 666.57  While many other names have been proposed for 666 throughout 
history,58 a textual variant for 666 bolsters the viability of Caesar Nero. 
 The number 666 is found in the earliest and most reliable manuscripts.59  
However, two other numbers emerge in the manuscript corpus: 66560 and 61661.

Chapter 4 
While 665 has been sufficiently dismissed through scribal error,62 the 616 tradition is 
more difficult to jettison.  First, early attestation for 616 is quite strong.  In addition 
to the late 3rd c. C.E. to early 4th c. C.E. document known as p115,63 Irenaeus 
acknowledges the existence of the 616 tradition ca. 180 C.E.  After describing 666, 
Irenaeus writes: 
I do not know how it is that some have erred following the ordinary mode of 
speech, and have vitiated the middle number in the name, deducting the 
amount of fifty from it, so that instead of six decads they will have it that 
there is but one.Others then received this reading without examination; 
some in their simplicity, and upon their own responsibility, making use of the 
number expressing one decad.64 
Although Irenaeus considers 616 erroneous and spurious, he demonstrates its strong 
tradition even at the time of his writing.  In light of this evidence, J.N. Birdsall 
concludes, The reading 616 at 13,18 is, then, ancient and widespread.65 
 Thus, any interpretation of 666 that cannot also explain the 616 variant 
should not be considered a viable option.  The Caesar Neron option accounts for 
both numbers: 666 (as seen above) and 616.  The Latin form of Caesar Neron is 
rendered Caesar Nero.  If this moniker is transliterated into Hebrew ( ), the 
numerical value equals 616.  So, Caesar Nero can explain both 666 and 616.  This 
conclusion leads early-date advocates to suggest that Revelation cryptically gives the 
modern audience a clue to its date through the mark of the beast.  Nevertheless, the 
60 665 is found in: fam 16112344. 
61 616 is found in: C arm4 Tyc2  p115 (P.Oxy. 4499).

Chapter 4 
Caesar Nero(n) interpretation of the beasts number is inadequate for at least five 
reasons. 
 First, no early church documents interpret 666 as Caesar Nero or even just 
Nero.  In fact, David Brady concludes that this option appears originally to have 
been suggested independently by four German scholars, each claiming priority.66  
These four scholars wrote from 1831-1837, which makes the development of this 
option quite late. 
 Second, while there is early testimony of Nero as the cipher of 616, the 
methodology drastically differs from the Latin Caesar Nero option.  In ca. 438 
C.E., the Liber Genealogus document solves the 616 cipher by adding up the 
numerical value of the letters in the Latin word for Antichrist (= 154) and then 
multiplying by four, since Nero has four letters in his Latin name.  The number 
acquired is 616.  Thus, Nero was referred to as a solution for 616 at a somewhat early 
date (5th c. C.E.), but the methodology is significantly different from the modern 
Nero option.67 
 Third, the Caesar Nero option does not explain why 616 (a more difficult 
reading) would occur later than 666 (a less difficult reading).  It only offers another 
name, among many, to explain the enigmatic number through creative manipulation.  
No explanation is offered for why a Latin-name-for-Nero interpretation (616) 
arises so early in contrast to a Greek-name-for-Nero interpretation (666).  The 
66 David Brady, The Contribution of British Writers Between 1560 and 1830 to the 
Interpretation of Revelation 13.16-18 (Tbingen: Mohr, 1983), 292. 
67 This does not mean that the modern option is incorrect, but that the modern option is just 
that: modern. 
Chapter 4 
suggestion of an interpretative possibility for 616 does not show why 616 exists as a 
variant at all.68 
 Fourth, why would Revelation use an honorific title (Caesar) for Nero in a 
cipher?  If it is a cryptic description of Nero only discernible to the Christian 
community, then why call him King Nero instead of Infidel Nero, Donkey 
Nero, or some other pejorative label?  The honorific Caesar Nero for 666 (or 616) 
is awkward at best and counterproductive at worst given the overall trajectory of the 
book thus far, not to mention the material that follows. 
 Fifth, disregarding the previous four arguments, even if 666 (616) refers to 
Nero, why would this necessitate a shift in Revelations date?  As in the case of 
Revelation 11:1-2, a reference to a past event (like Jesus birth in Revelation 12) 
does not demand a date concurrent with the historical allusion.  Thus, if Revelation 
13:18 does allude to Caesar Nero(n), which is unlikely, a date change is still not 
necessary.69 
 In sum, while Caesar Nero offers an interpretation for 666 and 616, it does 
not provide conclusive evidence for a pre-70 date of the Apocalypse.  The absence of 
any early Christian attestation to Caesar Nero as 666, the vastly different 
methodologies between early and modern Nero explanations for 616, the disregard 
for why the 616 variant even exists, the inexplicable honorific Caesar Nero in 
contradistinction to the books trajectory, and the alleged historical allusions 
68 Another possible solution to the 666/616 conundrum is the Greek word for beast () 
and its genitive form ().  See Wood, Simplifying, 138-140. 
69 Weiss, Offenbarung, 22.  In addition, the identification of 666 (616) with a Roman 
Emperor reduces the symbol of the beast(s) down to the Roman Empire alone.  The beast imagery 
in Revelation, however, far exceeds the Roman Empire in its scope and application.  For discussion on 
Romes relationship with the beast imagery, see Chapter 7 below (pp. 261-275). 
Chapter 4 
unnecessary shift in date demonstrate that Revelation 13:18 is inadequate to overturn 
the late-date option of the early Christian witnesses.  
Revelation 17:9-11The Seven Kings 
 In Revelation 17, the Seer is invited to view the punishment of the great 
harlot (17:1).  John is carried away in the Spirit to the desert where the harlot is 
seated on a beast with seven heads and ten horns (17:3-4).  Written on the womans 
forehead is Mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of prostitutes and the 
abominations of the earth (17:5).  Astonished at the sight (17:6b), John, like other 
apocalyptic visionaries, receives an explanation from the attendant angel (17:7).  In 
Revelation 17:9-11, the angel states: 
This calls for a mind having wisdom.  The seven heads are seven hills where 
the woman sits.  And they are seven kings: five fell, one is, the other has not 
yet come.  And when he comes, it is necessary for him to stay a little while. 
And the beast, who was and now is not, is an eighth [king].  He is from the 
seven and goes to destruction. 
Despite manifold interpretative proposals, early-date advocates designate these three 
verses as the crux of the problem70 and the leading objective evidence for 
Revelations date of composition.71 
 The early-date perspective asks two primary questions of this text: [1] With 
which emperor should the list of seven kings begin? and [2] Should the list include 
Galba, Otho, and Vitellius?  Once the initial question is answered, the five fallen 
emperors (17:10a) are counted, and contingent upon the answer to the second 
70 Bell, Date, 97. 
71 Kenneth L. Gentry, Jr., The Beast of Revelation (Powder Springs, Ga.: American Vision, 
2002), 137 [his emphasis].  Wilson, Early Christians, 170-171 offers a helpful chart listing six 
different interpretative categories for this passage.  Incredibly, these six categories are still an 
oversimplification of the variations within each category.  See also Hort, Apocalypse, xxvi; Robinson, 
Redating, 242-248; Rowland, Heaven, 403.   
Chapter 4 
question, the emperor that is (17:10b) is selected, which ostensibly gives 
Revelations date.  The answers to these two questions divide the early-date 
advocates into three reigning emperor categories: Nero (54-68 C.E.), Galba (8 June 
68-15 January 69 C.E.), and Vespasian (69-79 C.E.). 
 Some early-date proponents begin their list of seven kings with Julius 
Caesar based on the precedent set by Suetonius in the Lives of the Caesars, Sib. Or. 
5.12-51, and 2 Esd 11-12.72  With this starting point, the last of the five fallen kings 
is Claudius (41-54 C.E.) and Nero is the sixth king who is.  The answer to the 
second question divides this camp into two additional groups: (1) those who see 
Galba as the seventh king to come73 and (2) those who see Vespasian as the 
seventh king to come.74 
 Other early-date proponents reject Julius Caesar as the starting point and 
appeal to Tacitus Hist. 1.1, which, some say, presents Augustus as the first 
emperor.75  With this starting point, the last of the five fallen kings is Nero, but the 
sixth king is only determined by the answer to the second question: Should the list 
include Galba, Otho, and Vitellius?  If the answer to this question is yes, then 
Galba is the sixth king that is and Otho is the seventh king to come.76  If the

76 So Robinson, Redating, 243; Bell, Date, 100; Trudinger, Nero Redivivus, 44; and 
Rowland, Heaven, 403-413.  Oftentimes either the eighth king (Vitellius) is not discussed for this 
option or, as Trudinger, Nero Redivivus, 44 states, Because the current emperor at the time of 
writing (one is 17:10), Galba, was at deaths door, and Nero had not yet returned, the writer made 
the very understandable prediction that the seventh emperor (one is yet to come) would not reign for 
long.  Then after him would come an eighth who was also one of the seven.  This would be Nero, in 
the writers mind; Nero redivivus, returning to cause havoc and persecution about which the writer is 
warning his faithful Christian readers. 
Chapter 4 
answer to this question is no, then Vespasian is the sixth king that is and Titus is 
the seventh king to come.77 
 These three emperor options for early-date advocates (i.e., [1] Nero, [2] 
Galba, or [3] Vespasian) are addressed in reverse order, starting with the least 
supported option (Vespasian).  While some of the objections to the Galba option 
could be leveled as well, the primary point of contention for the Vespasian option is 
the answer to the second question: Should the list include Galba, Otho, and Vitellius?  
If it is more viable to include these three civil war emperors in the list, then the 
Vespasian option suffers as a legitimate conclusion.   
 The primary argument for the omission of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius comes 
from the phrase in Suetonius, Vesp. 1 that regards them as rebels in a revolution 
(rebellione trium principum) instead of emperors in power.  Suetoniuss point, 
however, is not to discredit the legality of their reign as justified emperors but to 
describe the instability of the Roman Empire during the tumultuous period of their 
legitimate reign.78  There is no indication that Suetonius considered these three rulers 
as anything less than emperors of Rome.  Indeed, all three are featured in individual 
chapters in Suetoniuss book entitled The Lives of the Twelve Caesars. 
This affirmation of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius is not unique to Suetonius.  As 
Albert Bell remarks, No ancient writer of whom I have knowledge omits these three 
men from his account of Roman history.79  For instance, 2 Esd 11:1-12:3, an

79 Bell, Date, 99. 
Chapter 4 
apocalypse written in the reign of Domitian, depicts an eagle-like beast emerging 
from the sea with twelve wings and three heads (11:1).  In the visions interpretation 
(12:10-51), this eagle is identified as the fourth kingdom of Daniel and symbolizes 
the Roman Empire (12:11).  The twelve wings of the eagle stand for twelve 
successive kings that reign one after another (12:14, Charlesworth).  Usually the 
second king, who reigns for a longer time than any other of the twelve (12:15, 
Charlesworth), is interpreted as Augustus who reigned for almost 42 years (27 
B.C.E.-14 C.E.)the second longest is Tiberius at about 23 years (14 C.E.-37 C.E.).  
In 12:22-28, the eagles three heads, also a part of the twelve wings, are interpreted 
as the Flavian dynasty.  Consequently, the twelve emperors in this vision contain 
Galba, Otho, and Vitellius just like Suetoniuss account of The Lives of the Twelve 
Caesars.80 
 Still further, Eutropius (Breviarium ab urbe condita 7.12, 16-18) includes the 
three emperors, Plutarch (Galb. 27.6) states that the Senate declared these rulers  
  , and even numismatic evidence from seven different cities in 
Asia Minor confirm that these rulers were recognized across the empire as the 
emperors of Rome.81  Thus, there is no historically viable reason to omit Galba, 
Otho, and Vitellius from the list of Roman emperors, thereby casting significant 
doubt on the Vespasian option for early-date advocates. 
80 In fact, the civil war and distress of Galba, Otho, and Vitelliuss time is referenced in 
12:18, In the midst of the time of that kingdom great struggles shall arise, and it shall be in danger of 
falling; nevertheless it shall not fall then, but shall regain its former power (cf. Suet., Vesp. 1).  Sib. 
Or. 5.12-51 also includes Galba, Otho, and Vitellius as emperors. 
81 For a discussion of the numismatic evidence, see Wilson, Early Christians, 173 who 
relies heavily on A. Burnett, M. Amandry, and P. P. Ripolls, Roman Provincial Coinage, 2 vols. 
(London: British Museum Press, 1992). 
Chapter 4 
 Identifying Galba as the king who is (Rev 17:10) falters through two lines 
of argumentation.  First, this option begins with Augustus following Tacitus (Hist. 
1.1; Annals 1.1) who ostensibly omits Julius Caesar because he ruled before the 
imperial power was concentrated in the hands of one man (Tacitus, Hist. 1.1, 
Church and Brodribb).  After demonstrating that Tacitus designates both Julius and 
Augustus as the Caesars (Ann. 4.34) and then lists them as masters of the empire 
(Ann. 13.3), Adela Yarbro Collins, a late-date advocate, retorts: 
Tacitus is making a critical judgment about Roman historians and not 
defining the beginning of the empire as such.Tacitus failure to mention 
[Julius Caesar] in this context may be due simply to the fact that his rule was 
too short to be of significance for the practical matter Tacitus is discussing.  
Furthermore, Tacitus does not begin his own history with Augustus, but with 
Galba.82 
In addition, Josephus, Ant. 18.32 refers to Annius Rufus (Prefect of Judea 
from 12 B.C.E.-15 C.E.), as ruling at the time of Augustus death, the second 
emperor of the Romans (Whiston).83 Similarly, Sib. Or. 5.12-15, 2 Esd 12:15 (see 
above), and Suetonius, The Lives of the Twelve Caesars all refer to Julius Caesar as 
the first emperor.  To deny Julius Caesar as the first emperor from an inferred 
reference in Tacitus in lieu of the other historical witnesses to the contrary is 
historically dubious.  Therefore, the early-date option beginning with Augustus 
suffers from this significant omission. 
Second, historical oddities compound if the Apocalypse was written 
between June 68 and 15 January 69, when Galba was killed (or a few weeks later, 
assuming that news would be slow to reach John on his island retreat).84  This 
82 Collins, Myth and History, 386. 
83 Also, Josephus, Ant. 18.224 (Whiston) declares, Now Gaius was the fourth emperor 
84 Bell, Date, 100. 
Chapter 4 
timetable offers the Apocalypse an applicable life span of twenty-seven months.85  
To exclude from this time period the exile of John to Patmos, it must be assumed that 
Nero exiled him, although no historical evidence exists.86  Furthermore, this begs the 
question, Why would Nero kill Peter and Paula Roman citizenbut only exile 
John within the same time period?  This oddity increases in light of Neros cruelty 
to Christians during this period.87  Although other objections could be raised,88 these 
two lines of argumentation sufficiently conclude that the Galba option for Revelation 
17:9-11 is inadequate to overturn the early Christian witness to a late date. 
Nero as the sixth king (17:10b) avoids some of the pitfalls of the previous 
two options: it includes Galba, Otho, and Vitellius89 and it begins with Julius Caesar 
as the first emperor.  Nevertheless, the Nero option suffers from the presence of the 
Nero myth in Revelation.  At some point after Neros suicide on 9 June 68 C.E.,90 
rumors circulated that Nero had either not died and escaped to the East to wait for the 
opportune time to return to his throne (redux) or, even more audacious, that he died 
but would resurrect with the same result (redivivus).91  In the decades that followed, 
three different figures claimed to be a recovered Nero (redux): [1] 69 C.E. in the 
85 With the temple destroyed in September 70 C.E., a twenty-seven month life span assumes 
John completes writing the document in June 68 C.E. (Galbas accession) and begins circulation the 
same month.

reign of Vitellius,92 [2] ca. 80 C.E. in the reign of Titus,93 and [3] ca. 89 C.E. in the 
reign of Domitian.94   
While all three figures claimed to be Nero, none of them claimed to be a 
resurrected Nero (redivivus) but a Nero who did not commit suicide and has now 
returned (redux).95  In fact, Adela Yarbro Collins writes: 
It is important to note that in the references to the Nero legend in the Greek 
and Latin authors there is no indication that the legend involved the return of 
Nero from the dead.  The presupposition of this form of the legend was that 
Nero had not in fact died, but was living somewhere in secrecy, preparing to 
regain powerthe persistence of the belief is not surprising since Nero was 
only 31 or 32 when he died in 68.96 
As time passed, the Nero redivivus tradition would likely increase, given that a 
longer period of time would necessitate a redivivus and not merely a redux. 
 Revelation 13:3, 12, 14; and 17:9-11 describe both Nero redux and redivivus 
myths for the beast from the sea.  Revelation 13:3 portrays a blow of death ( 
  ) to a head of the beast.  After a miraculous healing (), 
the whole earth is astonished and follows the beast.97  The same language for this 
apparent redivivus is found in 13:12 (     ), but 
Revelation 13:14 describes the infliction of the beast with the more ambiguous 
   (blow of the sword).  In spite of this blow, the beast still lived

( 13:14b), suggesting a possible redux.  Furthermore, scholars agree that 
the source for the language and imagery of the eighth king to come in Revelation 
17:9-11 is the Nero redivivus myth.98 
 The Nero myth in Revelation (both redux and redivivus) presents significant 
problems for the Nero option.  Indeed, the myths of Neros return or resurrection 
must be preceded by his death.  Since the Nero myth is found in the Apocalypse, 
how can Nero be the king who is at the time of Revelations composition?  
Furthermore, the existence of the Nero redivivus myth in Revelation indicates a later 
date, in that all three Nero pretenders claimed redux and not redivivus.99 
Still further, all three options (Vespasian, Galba, and Nero) share the same 
methodological flaw: counting emperors.100  Like other apocalyptic texts,101

The Parthians, dwelling just east of the Euphrates, were prominent in the Nero return rumors and 
even harbored the third Nero pretender for a time (Tac., Hist. 1.2; Suet., Nero 57.2).  See Collins,

100 There are several late-date advocates (Weiss, Offenbarung, 32-33) that acquiesce to this 
same methodology (i.e., counting emperors).  For modified counting methodologies that select 
different emperors as starting points for different reasons (e.g., Christs death, imperial cult 
development, Christian persecution, etc.) and include/excluded various emperors for various reasons,

addition, Sweet, Revelation, 23-24; and Charles, Revelation, 2:58-61 view Rev 17:9-11 as a Pre-70

Revelation through this imagery, see Andr Feuillet, LApocalypse: tat de la question (Paris:

Chapter 4 
Revelation communicates through symbolic imagery, especially symbolic 
numbers.102  In addition to the wide array of numbers throughout Revelation,103 the 
number seven is used fifty-five times.104  In Jewish literature, the number seven was 
often associated with completeness or totality (i.e., the complete cosmos was 
created in its totality in seven days in Genesis 1).105  Revelation adopts this Jewish 
interpretation for the number seven throughout the entire book: the slain lamb of 
Revelation 5:6 has seven horns and seven eyes (complete power and total 
101 A documents genre should govern the interpretative methodologies.  For instance, 
Suetonius, The Lives of the Twelve Caesars is a completely different genre than the Apocalypse.  The 
former communicates history through lists, chronologies, and significant events.  The latter 
communicates a subject narrative through symbolic imagery characteristic of apocalyptic literature.  
Therefore, different questions and interpretative methodologies are appropriate for Suetonius that are 
inappropriate for Revelation.  Some suggest 2 Esd 11-12 legitimates the counting methodology in Rev 
17:9-11, but Collins, Myth and History, 385 retorts: If the vision has any interest in completeness, 
it is expressed in these two series of wings.  The heads, on the other hand, represent three emperors 
selected from the total list.  The descriptions of the heads (2 Esd 11:29-32, 12:22-28) indicate that 
they stand for Vespasian, Titus and Domitian.  It is quite clear then that these three emperors are 
represented both by three of the twelve major wings and by the three heads.  The use of imagery in 2 
Esdras, however, does not support the assumption that the seven heads of Revelation 17 represent all 
the emperors of Rome up to the actual or supposed time of writing.  If there is an analogy between the 
two, the ten horns might be taken as a complete list of emperors and the seven heads as a selection.  
But the similarity between the two should not be pressed, and one cannot assume that the author of 
Revelation was following the example of 2 Esdras 11-12 or that he used traditional images in exactly 
the same way.  See also Collins, Crisis, 60.

knowledge), the earthquake of Revelation 11:13 kills seven thousand people (the 
complete number of deaths), and even the three sets of seven judgments (seals, 
trumpets and bowls) indicate the complete and total judgment of God.106  
Consistently in Revelation, the number seven symbolizes completeness or 
totality.  It would be anomalous, then, to surmise that the number seven in 
Revelation 17 follows a different interpretative methodology (counting) than the 
number seven in the rest of Apocalypse (symbolism).107 
Moreover, John was not obligated by history to select the number seven for 
the kings of Revelation 17, but rather, the number seven alludes to Daniels 
apocalyptic vision.  In Daniel 7, four beasts emerge from the sea (7:2-3): the lion-like 
beast (7:4), the bear-like beast (7:5), the leopard-like beast with four heads (7:6), and 
the fourth beast adorned with ten horns (7:7).  These four beasts, interpreted by the 
attendant angel as four kingdoms (7:17), instruct the beast imagery in Revelation 
13:1-2athe beast comes out of the sea (Dan 7:2-3) with ten horns (Dan 7:7) and 
resembles a leopard, a bear, and a lion (Dan 7:2-6).  Significantly, the seven heads of 
the beast in Revelation 13:1bwhich are the seven kings in Revelation 17:9-10a
also parallel Daniel 7 and the four beasts who have a total of seven heads (i.e., one 
head for the first, second, and fourth beasts and four heads for the third beast).  John 
did not therefore choose the number seven to parody the amount of rulers in the 
empire; the number seven was chosen for him by one of his sourcesDaniel 7.108 
106 All three sets of seven judgments brings the world to its complete destructionseals (Rev 
6:12-17), trumpets (Rev 11:15-18, esp. v. 18), and bowls (Rev 16:17-21). 
107 Mounce, Revelation, 21 adds, Since the seven heads are also seven hills (17:9) and the 
eighth is one of the seven (17:11), it is probably unwise to base a literal computation on what appears 
to be a highly symbolic figure.

Chapter 4 
Given the significant flaws and methodological peculiarities in each emperor 
option, Revelation 17:9-11 fails to offer conclusive evidence for an early-date of 
Revelations composition.  Thus, the early Christian witness to a Domitianic date 
remains unassailed. 
Conclusion 
 The early Christian witness to the date of Revelation decisively points to the 
end of Domitians reign (92-96 C.E.).  If conclusive internal evidence dictates a 
different date of composition, then the early Christian witness should be disregarded.  
However, the internal evidence offered by early-date advocates (i.e., Rev 11:1-2; Rev 
13:18; and Rev 17:9-11) proves insufficient.  In the absence of any internal evidence 
to the contrary, the tentative conclusion of a Domitianic date is pursued further.  The 
next chapter considers the late-date in its socio-historical context specifically 
addressing the alleged persecution of Christians under Domitian.109 
told.  See also Friesen, Imperial, 141; Elisabeth Schssler Fiorenza, The Book of Revelation: Justice 
and Judgment (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1985), 20, 185); Beasley-Murray, Revelation, 38.  It is often 
objected that the number seven has a historical referent due to the fact that there were seven churches 
in Asia Minor addressed in Revelation 2-3.  Caird, Revelation, 218 retorts, No one supposes that he 
wrote to seven churches because there were only seven in the province of Asia, nor even because there 
were only seven in his diocese, a diocese so erratic as to contain Ephesus but not Magnesia or Tralles, 
Laodicea but not Colossae or Hierapolis. 
109 Traditional internal evidence for a late-date includes: Nero myth (see discussion above), 
the parallel between Revelation 1:16 and the coin of Domitians son holding seven stars (RIC 209A, 
213) minted in 82-84 CE [E.P. Janzen, The Jesus of the Apocalypse Wears the Emperors Clothes, 
in Society of Biblical Literature 1994 Seminar Papers (ed. E.H. Lovering, Jr.; Atlanta: Scholars, 
1994), 653; Kraybill, Imperial, 64], the use of Babylon for Rome [Friesen, Imperial, 138-140; 
Kraybill, Imperial, 33; Kraybill, Apocalypse, 29-30; Thompson, Revelation, 14; Collins, Crisis, 57-58;

the church in Smyrna (Rev 2:8-11) and Pol. Phil 11.3 [Collins, Crisis, 75; Beale, Revelation, 16-17; 
cf. Zahn, Offenbarung, 1:34; Mounce, Revelation, 19].  Adding to these common indices, the next 
chapter addresses the socio-historical problem of Domitianic persecution and concludes that 
Revelations nuanced portrayal of persecution attests precisely to the late date.

The Date of the Book of Revelation pt. 2: 
The Socio-Historical Context of the Flavian Dynasty 
 The inquiry into the date of Revelation is not complete without an analysis of 
Christian persecution in Domitians reign.1  As seen below, early-date advocates 
argue that the text of Revelation reflects a time of intense persecution by the empire; 
Neronic persecution is widely documented while Domitianic persecution eludes the 
historical annals.  Thus, this chapter focuses on the socio-historical context of the 
Flavian Dynasty to consider the possibility of persecution under Domitian and, by 
extension, a Domitianic date for Revelation.  This examination, then, both completes 
the investigation of Revelations date of composition and presents potential points 
of conversation for the subject narrative.  
The Problem: The Alleged Domitianic Persecution 
The oft quoted remark by John A. T. Robinson positions the early-date 
objection, One thing of which we may be certain is that the Apocalypse, unless the 
product of a perfervid and psychotic imagination, was written out of an intense 
experience of the Christian suffering at the hands of the imperial authorities, 
represented by the beast of Babylon.2  With this in place, early-date advocates 
argue that there is little or no evidence from Roman sources for the persecution of 
Christians under Domitian.3  Normally, this is followed by an examination of the

Christian persecution under Nero in 64 C.E.4 which allegedly aligns with the socio-
historical context demanded by Revelation: mass killings.5  According to this 
argumentation, the late-date advocates have a two-fold problem: [1] the text of 
Revelation demands mass persecutions of Christians by the Roman Empire and [2] 
there is no evidence of Domitianic persecution of Christians. 
Traditional Late-Date Reconstruction of Domitianic Persecution 
Traditionally, late-date advocates have attempted to depict Domitian as a 
tyrannical leader who includes Christians in his terror.6  Although the last half of that 
statement may be difficult to prove, Domitian as a tyrant ruler, primarily at the end 
of his reign, does have precedent amongst Roman historians.7  Suetonius suggests 
that Vespasian was aware of Domitians evil disposition, and throughout 
[Vespasians] own reign endeavored to keep [Domitian] as much as possible apart 
from public affairs.8 As the text continues, Titus adopts the same policy toward 
Domitian, which so inflamed Domitians hatred that he is believed several times to 
have attempted his brothers life, and in [Titus] last illness to have taken means to

make his recovery impossible.9  Dio Cassius adds Titus death-bed lamentation (I 
have made but one mistake) and interprets the singular error as surrendering the 
empire of the Romans to a man like Domitian, whose character will be made clear in 
the continuation of [Dio Cassius] narrative.10 
Late-date advocates argue that even though Domitian masks his evil for quite 
some time,11 a turning point occurs in 89 C.E. when Domitian was forced to suppress 
the conspiracy of the highly trusted Antonius Saturninus.12  Suetonius writes, After 
his victory in the civil war he became even more cruel, and to discover any 
conspirators who were in hiding, tortured many of the opposite party by a new form 
of inquisition, inserting fire in their privates; and he cut off the hands of some of 
them.13  This event precipitated the final years of Domitians reign characterized as 
cruel and terrifying,14 in that family,15 philosophers,16 playwrights,17 and even 
Roman officials18 were in danger of his tyranny.  Dio Cassius recounts:

during which Domitian, leaving now no interval or breathing space of time, but, as it were, with one 
continuous blow, drained the life-blood of the State (Church and Brodribb).  Also, [Unknown 
Author], An Inscription Dug out of the Ruins of a Palace at Rome, Universal Magazine of 
Knowledge and Pleasure, 50.367 (1772: Mar): 117, transmits an inscription found in Rome, Under 
this monument repose the ashes of Domitian, the last of the Caesars, and the fourth scourge of Rome; 
a tyrant no less deliberate than Tiberius, no less capricious than Caligula, and no less outrageous than 
Nero:--When satiated with issuing edicts to spill human blood, he found an amusement in stabbing 
flies with a bodkin:--His reign, though undisturbed by war, occasioned no less calamity to his country 
than would have happened from the loss of twenty battles:--He was magnificent from vanity, affable 
from artifice, and implacable from cowardice:--He flattered incessantly the soldiery who governed 
him, and detested the Senate, who caressed him:--While living, he was deified, and the assassins 
alone, whom his Empress had sent to dispatch him, could convince him of his mortality:--This 
monster governed during fifteen years, yet the administration of Titus, the delight of human kind, was 
confined to twoYe passengers Who read this inscription, blaspheme not the gods 
15 Suet., Dom. 10.4. 
Chapter 5 
It would be impossible to discover the total number of those who were 
executed by Domitian. Indeed, he condemned himself so severely for this 
course that, in order to prevent any remembrance of those who were put to 
death from surviving, he prohibited the entering of their names in the records. 
Furthermore, he did not even send any communication to the senate regarding 
those who had been put out of the way, though he sent their headsand 
caused them to be exposed in the Forum.19 
Late-date advocates then suggest that a cruelty suspicious of all mankind20 
could easily include mass persecutions of Christians, with the deaths of Clemens and 
Domitilla as marquee Christian examples.21  Indeed, this exact picture is found in 
the description of Domitian in Eusebius Hist. eccl. 3.17:  
When Domitian had given many proofs of his great cruelty and had put to 
death without any reasonable trial no small number of men distinguished at 
Rome by family and career, and had punished without a cause myriads of 
other notable men by banishment and confiscation of their property, he 
finally showed himself the successor of Neros campaign of hostility to God.  
He was the second to promote persecution against us, though his father, 
Vespasian, had planned no evil against us.22 
Therefore, so the argument goes, the Domitianic time period did include mass 
persecutions of Christians by the Roman Empire.

Chapter 5 
Modern Response to Domitianic Persecution 
 Nevertheless, to prove that Domitian was a tyrannical ruler, particularly at the 
end of his reign, does not prove that he engaged in mass persecution of Christians.  
Indeed, the lack of corroboration by Roman sources for the assertions of Domitianic 
persecution by Christian sources is quite troublesome and should not be easily 
discounted.23  Recently, Leonard Thompson exposed these weaknesses through 
historical skepticism and developed an entirely different picture of Domitians 
interaction with Christians.  
 Thompson depicts Domitian as a relatively good emperor who suffers from 
Roman writers that distort virtually every area of Domitians public and state 
activity during the time of his emperorship.24  For example, regarding the 
punishment of Flavius Clemens and Domitillareferenced by late-date advocates of 
Christian persecutionThompson writes: 
Dio says that Domitian charged Flavius Clemens and his wife Domitilla with 
atheism, a charge on which many others who drifted into Jewish ways were 
condemned (67.14.2).  Dio is apparently contrasting Domitian here to Nerva 
(68.1.2).  It is difficult to assess the standard sources in light of their obvious 
bias against Domitian and their attempt to portray him as evil and unjust.25 
According to Thompson, these biases of the Roman elite developed out of frustration 
toward Domitians economic and political policies, his actions toward relatives 
and/or friends (i.e., exile), as well as his hindrance to career advancement.26   
23 Examples of these Christian sources usually include: Eusebius, 1 Clement, and Revelation, 
although some include 1 Peter and Hebrews as well.

Chapter 5 
In response, writers such as Pliny the Younger, Tacitus, and Suetonius 
emphasized Domitians negative qualities and neglected his positive actions, 
changing posteritys perception of his reign (i.e., Dio Cassius).27  Trajan harnessed 
this bitterness to promulgate his own new era through the intentional slander of 
Domitian.28  Consequently, these writers do not preserve history but Roman 
propaganda that intentionally distorts the actual reign of Domitian.  Therefore, 
according to Thompson, these sources cannot be trusted to construct a history of 
Christian persecution at the end of the first century.   
Instead of these biased authors (i.e., Pliny, Suetonius, Tacitus, and Dio 
Cassius), Thompson prefers the writings of Quintilian, Statius,29 and Martial, all 
writing under the reign of Domitian.30  Primarily focusing on the use of Lord and 
God in reference to Domitian, Thompson suggests that the writers during 
Domitians time present an emperor who deflects heightened adulation,31 contrasting 
27 Thompson, Sociological, 155; Thompson, Revelation, 96.  For the positive perspective 
of Domitians administrative abilities, see David Magie, Roman Rule in Asia Minor to the End of the 
Third Century after Christ (Princeton: Princeton University, 1950), 1.566-92; B.W. Jones, The 
Emperor Domitian (London: Routledge, 1992), 114.  For a similar treatment of Tacitus, see Candida 
R. Moss, The Myth of Persecution: How Early Christians Invented a Story of Martyrdom (New York: 
HarperOne, 2013), 139. 
28 Thompson, Revelation, 115. 
29 For adulation of Domitian by Statius, see Franz Sauter, Der rmische Kaiserkult bei 
Martial und Statius (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1934). 
30 See Thompson, Sociological, 156-158.  Thompsons overall point is not to argue against 
the late date of Revelation; he argues for the theme of persecution to be explored in the context of the 
seers linguistic universe rather than in the time and space of first-century Asia (p. 148). 
31 Thompson, Sociological, 157 points to Statius, Silv. 1.6.81-84 as evidence of Domitians 
refusal of the title Lord [contra Kenneth Scott, The Imperial Cult Under the Flavians (New York: 
Arno Press, 1975), 109 who points out that this statement by Statius occurs early in Domitians reign].  
Thompson uses this passage to even explain away references in Martial to Domitian as Lord and 
God (Martial, Epigrams 5.3; 5.5; 7.2; 7.5; 7.34; 8.2; 8.82; 9.28; 9.66; see also 10.72).  After he 
acknowledges Martials usage, he states (without further explanation), Statiuss comment on 
Domitians reticence to being called dominus is probably an accurate reflection of Domitians view 
throughout his reign (p. 158, n. 24). 
Chapter 5 
the megalomaniac presented in the biased writings.32  After his analysis of the 
unbiased writings, Thompson concludes that no mass persecution of Christians 
occurred under Domitian and, more than likely, just the opposite reality.33 
A couple of points of critique, however, significantly weaken the likelihood 
of Thompsons reconstruction.  First, the promulgation of Trajans new era over 
and against the Flavian dynasty through anti-Domitian rhetoric does not coalesce 
with the complete picture in the biased writings.  While there is a consistent 
disdain toward Domitian, the biased writings herald the Flavian dynasty as the 
redeemer of Rome.   
During the year of the four emperors (69 C.E.), the future of the Roman 
Empire was in flux as civil war raged even in the city of Rome itself.34  The 
emergence of Vespasian and the establishment of the Flavian Dynasty, then, was a 
welcomed interruption to the empires uncertainty.  Indeed, under Trajan, Suetonius 
writes, The empire, which for a long time had been unsettled and, as it were, 
drifting, through the usurpation and violent death of three emperors, was at last taken 
in hand and given stability by the Flavian family (Vesp. 1.1, [Rolfe, LCL]).  As 
Suetonius continues, this favorable description of the Flavian dynasty strikingly 
contrasts his hostile depiction of Domitian, This house was, it is true, obscure and 
without family portraits, yet it was one of which our country had no reason whatever 
to be ashamed, even though it is the general opinion that the penalty which Domitian 
paid for his avarice and cruelty was fully merited.  Therefore, in writings under 
32 Suet., Dom. 13.2; Pliny, Pan. 33.4; 52.6; Dio Cass. 67.4.7; 67.13.4.  See also Philostratus, 
Vit. Apoll. 8.4. 
33 Thompson, Sociological, 153-154; Thompson, Revelation, 95. 
34 Tacituss Histories details these events leading up to the accession of the Flavian Dynasty. 
Chapter 5 
Trajan, while Domitian is scandalized, the Flavian dynasty is celebrated; while 
Domitian is harshly discredited, the Flavian dynasty is honored.35 
This distinction is also visible following the Senates decision to pass 
damnatio memoriae on Domitians legacy.36  Instead of eradicating the Imperial Cult 
temple featuring Domitian in Ephesus, the temple was rededicated to Vespasian.37  
Once again, the derision of Domitian is separated from the honor and admiration of 
the Flavian dynasty.  This dissonance indicates that the picture of Domitian in the 
biased writers may not be as biased as Thompson suggests.   
The emergence of Trajans new era, therefore, did not necessitate complete 
contempt for the entire Flavian dynasty.  Instead, Domitian emerges as a great 
aberration in in a favorably remembered family.  To completely disregard, then, the 
negative picture of Domitian by the biased writers is a highly questionable 
historical methodology. 
Second, the bias for Pliny, Suetonius, and Tacitus (inherited by Dio 
Cassius) as a result of Trajans favor38 can equally be leveled against the unbiased 
writings of Quintilian, Statius, and Martial.  All three of these writers prospered 
35 While Thompson, Revelation, 100 acknowledges this distinction, he still awkwardly 
asserts that Trajan used the anti-Domitian rhetoric because adjustments had to be made in order to 
fabricate a break with the Flavian period (p. 115).

under Domitian,39 with Quintilian even serving as the tutor of Domitians great-
nephews.40  Furthermore, if Domitian was tyrannical in the least bit, it would serve 
the contemporary writers well to paint the emperor in a favorable manner in order to 
avoid punishment.  Indeed, depicting a reigning, cruel tyrant in a favorable light is 
far more likely than a retrospective conversion of someone into a tyrant that never 
was one. 
Third, Thompson does not entertain the possibility that the benevolent picture 
painted by Quintilian, Statius, and Martial was the result of hidden transcripts.  
Although this point is developed more fully below,41 hidden transcripts were 
implemented broadly in Domitians reign.42  In fact, Quintilian teaches in his schools 
of rhetoric the art of linguistic deception in which the speaker pretends to say 
something other than that which he actually does say.43  Quintilian even specifies 
that linguistic deception should be implemented if it is unsafe to speak openly.44  
39 Thompson acknowledges this point, at least in a cursory manner (Thompson, Revelation, 
103, 106-107), and ironically, Thompson, Revelation, 222 (n. 4) admits that Martial (an unbiased 
writer) was supported by Pliny (a biased writer).  For further discussion and critique see Thomas B. 
Slater, On the Social Setting of the Revelation to John, NTS 44 (1998): 232-256 (esp. 236-237).

is in keeping with this pessimistic authors general conviction that, since the late Augustan age, all 
imperial history was distorted by fear if written during the lifetime of its subjects, and by resentment if 
after their deaths. Moreover, what Tacitus actually asserts is that criticism of a member of the 
Flavian faction had been impossible: in other words, historians had not been free to say all they 
wished.Our overall impression is that before Tacitus came to the subject, very little had been 
written at Rome about the reign of any Flavian.  It was too difficult, too dangerous, or perhaps simply 
unfashionable. 
Chapter 5 
Thus, one of Thompsons unbiased writers admits to and even advises others to 
use hidden transcripts during the reign of a tyrant.   
Therefore, Thompsons presentation of Domitian as merely the victim of 
effective negative propaganda is highly unlikely.  The depiction of Domitian as a 
cruel tyrant, primarily at the end of his reign, in Suetonius, Tacitus, Pliny, and Dio 
Cassius should not be discounted as Thompson attempts.  Yet neither does this 
conclusion justify the assertion that Domitian directed mass persecutions of 
Christians.45  
Three Key Problems: A Path to a New Way Forward 
At this point, early-date advocates of Revelation may conclude: since Roman 
sources do not attest to mass persecution of Christians under Domitian (necessitated 
by the text of Revelation), then the Apocalypse must be dated to the time of Nero.  
This conclusion, however, suffers from three key problems: [1] What definition of 
persecution should govern the historical inquiry into the time of Domitian?  Both 
early- and late-date proponents assume that persecution equals mass killings of 
Christians.  But is persecution that one-dimensional?  [2] Does the text of 
Revelation actually reflect a time period of Christian mass killings?  Again, both 
early- and late-date proponents assume that the Apocalypse portrays a time period of 
mass killings of Christians.  But are present mass killings actually found in 
Revelation?  [3] How does the picture of Domitian explain the increase in Christian 
killings throughout the second and third centuries?  The increase in Christian 
45 Those who deny Domitianic mass persecution include: Leon Hardy Cranfield, The Early 
Persecutions of the Christians (New York: Columbia University Press, 1913); Adela Yarbro Collins, 
Dating the Apocalypse of John, BR 26 (1981): 34; idem, Crisis, 54-110; Gerhard A. Krodel, 
Revelation (Peabody: Hendrickson, 1991), 10-12. 
Chapter 5 
martyrdom and imperial derision during this time period does not develop 
spontaneously.  But if there is no persecution of Christians under Domitian in any 
form, then how does such an atmosphere emerge in the early second century?  
Answers to these three queries dispel persistent assumptions and offer a new path of 
historical inquiry into Domitianic persecution of Christians. 
A Definition of Persecution 
 When Domitianic persecution is discussed, oftentimes, whole arguments and 
broad conclusions never mention a definition of persecution.  So scholars 
pronounce that no convincing evidence exists for a Domitianic persecution of the 
Christians,46 or there is no solid evidence that Christians suffered persecution by 
the Roman state underDomitian.47  Yet, they offer no definition for the 
persecution that they so easily dismiss.   
Surveying the various authors, however, reveals that the persecution sought 
after in the historical documents is mass killings of Christians in the form of some 
law, edict, or direct act of the emperor.48  This assumed definition of persecution, 
though, overlooks two key aspects.  First, the acuity or intensity of a persecution is 
quite relative to the group persecuted.49  This is not to suggest that the persecution is

imagined or merely a perceived crisis by the subject group50 but that actual 
persecution may exist for the subject group that is imperceiveable to others (posterity 
included).  The size of the community and the amount of deaths experienced in the 
community does effect whether or not the persecution is considered intense or 
even widespread for that community.   
For example, in a community of five hundred people, only one death can be 
catastrophic for the group, whereas in a city of fifty-thousand people one death may 
not even be noticed by all.  Therefore, it is quite presumptuous to assume that only a 
few killings of Christians did not constitute an intense persecution from the 
perspective of this group,51 given that the community of Christians across the empire 
would not have been a high percentage of the Roman population.52 
 Second, persecution as mere killing simply ignores the subject perspective.  
This reduction asserts what evidence constitutes as suffering without allowing the 
voice of the victims to dictate the inquiry.  As James C. Scott articulates, We know 
relatively little about a Malay villager if we know only that he is poor and 
landless.To know the cultural meaning of his povertyis to learn the shape of his 
indignity and, hence, to gauge the content of his anger.53  To adapt Scotts point to 
the present discussion, it would be foolish to assume that Malay villagers do not 
suffer or experience persecution simply because they are not being killed by the

social elite.  The complexities of persecution stretch far beyond whether someone is 
alive or dead; some circumstances suggest that while the people are living they are 
treated as if they are not.  Similarly, to reduce the persecution of Christians down to 
mass killings is to overlook the multilayered nature of persecution, as well as the 
complexities of suffering.54  What is needed is a more balanced articulation of the 
definition of persecution. 
 Persecution can be physical, non-physical, or both.  Physical persecution 
includes, but is not limited to: banishments/exiles,55 beatings,56 and even 
executions.57  While most historical inquiries do not move beyond this category, non-
physical persecution is just as invasive in the life of the victim.  Non-physical 
54 Persistently, authors discount the subjects perspective in the definition of persecution.  So, 
in her attempt to virtually eradicate any evidence of Christian persecution in the first three centuries 
C.E., Moss, Ancient, 50 asserts, Just as certain physical ailments seem mild by contrast to life-
threatening illness, so too social marginalization becomes inconsequential when measured against 
genocide.  Elsewhere, Moss, Myth, 15, 153 discounts prejudice against Christians and even 
portrays Decius as the victim of unfair, negative Christian propaganda: Christian writers describe 
Decius as wicked and his decree as one of the machinations of the devil.  Its easy to see why they 
thought this.  In principle the decree required that Christians apostatize or die.  Just because the 
Christians saw the decree as a manifestation of the work of Satan in the world, however, doesnt mean 
that Christians were being persecuted.  In fact, Decius may not even have had the Christians in mind 
when he passed the legislation (Moss, Myth, 148, see also 150-151, 164).  This complete disregard of 
the subjects point of view allows Moss to irresponsibly conclude: When Christians were 
marginalized, denied legal rights, ostracized from society, or otherwise threatenedthis is not 
persecution (Myth, 159).  See also Laura Salah Nasrallah, Christian Responses to Roman Art and 
Architecture: The Second- Century Church Amid the Spaces of Empire (Cambridge: Cambridge 
University Press, 2010), 408.  While completely ignored by Moss in her projects, Postcolonial 
criticism and the examinations of dominance in chapter 1 above (see pp. 40-61) issue a strong critique 
of her definition of persecution and her dismissal of the subject perspective.  As Fiorenza, Justice, 9 
insightfully observes, Moreover, the answer to the [question of persecution] will also depend on 
whose perspective we adopt.  One could argue from the perspective of well-to-do white Americans 
that no harassment, denigration, discrimination, or oppression of blacks existed at the time of Martin 
Luther King, Jr., although King was assassinated.  The perspective and experience of blacks would be 
quite different.  Similarly, the author of Rev. has adopted the perspective from below and expressed 
the experiences of those who were powerless, poor, and in constant fear of denunciation.  See also

persecution includes, but is not limited to: slander,58 deception,59 ostracism,60 
economic (re)distribution,61 symbolic/oppressive taxes,62 proselyte restriction,63 and 
fear/pressure to compromise.64   
All of these elements of persecution must be taken into account when 
investigating Domitians persecution of Christians.  To limit the definition of 
Christian persecution to mass killings is simply to ignore the multifaceted nature of 
persecution and suffering that includes both physical and non-physical forms.  Such 
negligence not only suppresses the perspective of the victim, but also leads to poor 
historical conclusions based on inadequate sociological assumptions.

Chapter 5 
Picture of Persecution in Revelation  
 As mentioned above, the traditional picture of Revelation is a text that 
reflects persecution of Christians implicitly defined as mass killings.  Early-date 
advocates, like Mark Wilson, use this picture to place Revelation in Neros reign:  
The internal evidence in Revelation suggests localized persecution in Asia 
while in other parts of the empire, particularly Rome, massive persecution 
had produced innumerable martyrs.  This picture of widespread tribulation is 
compatible with an early date during or after the reign of Nero, but 
incompatible with the historical evidence for a late date during Domitians 
reign.65 
With no definition of persecution, Wilsons conclusion of massive persecution that 
had produced innumerable martyrs is allegedly based on internal evidence in 
Revelation.  But is this the picture that Revelation reflects?  Does the text of the 
Apocalypse depict a contemporary mass killing of Christians?   
 To be sure, Revelation is a book of conflict,66 but who is in conflict, the type 
of conflict (physical and/or non-physical), and when the conflict occurs varies 
broadly throughout.67  Physical persecution emerges in the Apocalypse in a wide 
array of images and forms.  For example, allusions to Jesus sacrificial death occur 
throughout (5:6, 9, 12; 11:8; 12:11; 19:13; etc.) and passages like Revelation 12:11b 
and 13:10 call Christians to imitate Jesus patient endurance in suffering.  These 
passages, and others like it, create a vague trajectory of physical persecution that may 
include death but does not necessitate it.  In fact, in addition to Christian killings in 
65 Wilson, Early Christians, 174. 
66 Conflict of some form can be found in: Rev. 1:9; 2:2, 3, 4, 5b, 6, 7b, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 
16, 17b, 19b, 20-23, 26; 3:3, 9, 12, 16; 5:6, 9, 12;  6:2, 4, 6, 8b, 9, 11, 12-17; 7:2b, 14b; 8:5, 7, 8-9, 
10-11, 12; 9:3-11, 15-19; 11:2b, 5, 7, 10b, 13, 18; 12:4, 7, 8-9, 12b, 13, 15-16, 17; 13:6, 7, 10b, 15, 
16-17; 14:8, 9b-11, 12, 13a, 19-20; 16:1, 2, 3, 4, 5b, 6a, 6b, 8-9, 10-11, 14b, 19b; 17:6, 14, 16; 18:8b,

Chapter 5 
Revelation,68 general physical sufferings,69 imprisonments,70 and even 
banishments/exiles71 are found as well. 
 Equally important is determining when the various types of physical 
persecution (especially killings) occur: past, present, or future.  Indeed, Revelation 
seems to locate Christian mass killings in the indefinite past rather than the 
present.  For example, when the fifth seal is broken (Rev 6:9), the text depicts the 
souls of those having been slain because of the word of God and because of the 
testimony they had retained.  Boldly, this group asks, Sovereign Lord, holy and 
true, how long until you judge the ones residing on of the earth and avenge our 
blood? (6:10).  The response in 6:11 is that they were told to continue to abide a 
little longer, which indicates they had already been waiting for vengeance for an 
indeterminate period of time.  Indeed, Samuel A. B. Mercer and Leicester C. Lewis 
conclude that the martyrs under the altar do not profess or appear to pertain, any or 
all of them, necessarily to the present or the immediate past, but only to the indefinite 
past, extending possibly over quite a long period.72 
68 General killings: Rev 6:9-11; 17:6a; 18:24; 20:4 (see also Rev 13:15; 14:13).  Specific 
killing: Antipas in Rev 2:13.  Adela Yarbro Collins, Persecution and Vengeance in the Book of 
Revelation, Apocalypticism in the Mediterranean World and the Near East: Proceedings of the 
International Colloquium on Apocalypticism (ed. David Hellholm; Tbingen: Mohr, 1983), 742, (n. 
71) suggests that Antipas is tried and executed by the provincial governor.

Domitian, AThR 2.1 (1919): 14.  See also Kraybill, Imperial, 37.  Cf. Rev 7:9-14; 20:4-6. 
Chapter 5 
Still further, Revelation 18:20, 24 includes Old Testament prophets as victims 
of the mass killings.  In Revelation 18:20, during the dirge over Babylon,73 a voice 
cries out, Rejoice over her heaven and saints and apostles and prophets, because 
God judged her for her judgment of you.  Revelation 18:24 continues, And in her 
was found blood of prophets and saints, and of all the ones having been slain on the 
earth.74  The inclusion of Old Testament deaths locates the mass killings of the 
faithful in Revelation in the indefinite past rather than the present. 
In fact, Revelation only offers two examples of present physical persecutions, 
only one of which involves the death of a Christian.  Revelation 1:9 records a 
physical persecution in the form of the banishment/exile of John,75 and Revelation 
2:13, to the church at Pergamum, mentions Antipas who was put to death in your 
citywhere Satan lives.76  While the latter is an example of the killing of a 
Christian, this is the only clear example mentioned in the whole book of Revelation, 
and it is the killing of one Christian and not mass killings of Christians.  
Revelation does, however, seem to indicate that physical persecution leading to death 
will increase in the indeterminate future in its emphasis on patient endurance77

necessary for the impending tribulation.78  But present Christian mass killings are 
absent from the text. 
 Non-physical persecution attested in the book of Revelation dominates the 
contemporary picture of the audience.  Throughout the text, Revelation depicts 
slander,79 deception,80 and wealth (re)distribution81 as non-physical persecutions 
used against the first century Christians of Asia Minor.  These weapons are used to 
seduce Christians into worshiping the dragon and his beast.82 Revelation 14:9-12 
accents the intensity of this present assault: 
And a third angel followed them saying in a great voice: If anyone worships 
the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, 
he will also drink from the wine of Gods fury, the one having been mixed 
undiluted in the cup of his wrath.  And he will be tormented in fire and sulfur 
before the holy angels and before the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment 
rises for ever and ever.  And the ones worshiping the beast and his image 
(and anyone who receives the mark of his name) have no rest day or night.  
This calls for patient endurance from the saints, the ones obeying Gods 
commands and Jesus faithfulness.83 
Revelation portrays a contemporary setting in which non-physical 
persecution is experienced in a heightened manner and that has, at times, resulted in 
physical persecution.  The contemporary non-physical persecution develops an

atmosphere that increases the potential for more physical persecution in the 
indeterminate future, reflecting the physical persecution from the indeterminate 
past.84  In the face of both types of persecution, then, Revelation issues a clarion call 
to Christians for patient endurance as they worship God alone.85

86 Candida Mosss recent works scrutinize martyrdom traditions in the first few centuries of 
church history.  While she does admit that some people were cruelly tortured and brutally executed 
(Myth, 125; see also 88, 105), the overall analysis calls into question the historical validity of virtually 
every martyrdom account: The fact of the matter is that there are no stories about the deaths of 
martyrs that have not been purposely recast by later generations of Christians in order to further their 
own theological agendas (Myth, 17; see also 124).  In response, seven points must be taken into 
account.  First, Mosss investigation is driven by an (understandable) ideological aversion to 
American religious conservatism that disrupts her perception of the evidence at hand.  After 
presenting a modern-day martyrdom account that precipitated unbridled violence (Myth, 3), Moss 
concludes, This point is not merely academic.  The view that the history of Christianity is a history of 
unrelenting persecution persists in modern religious and political debate about what it means to be 
Christian.  It creates a world in which Christians are under attack; it endorses political warfare rather 
than encouraging political discourse; and it legitimizes seeing those who disagree with us as our 
enemies (Myth, 21).  Her solution to this disturbing predicament is to, on some level, eradicate the 
martyrdom narrative (Myth, 13) so that each situation would have to be judged on its own merits 
(Myth, 14).  Misuse of martyr accounts, however, does not necessitate eradication of hagiography, but 
censure and correction for the abuser.  Nevertheless, this trajectory results in her refusal to 
acknowledge evidence to the contrary.  As Ephraim Radner, Unmythical Martyrs: Review of The 
Myth of Persecution by Candida Moss, First Things 223 (2013): 55 retorts, William Caves 
massively influential studies in the late seventeenth century of the early Churchs martyrs and their 
outlooks, for instance, gave rise not to pogroms but to the renewal of charitable works, education, and 
mission, to Methodist revival, and finally, if indirectly, to the Evangelical commitment to 
abolitionism.  Second, Moss envisions the historians task as recovery of the events as they actually 
happened (Myth, 100; see also 92-93).  In search for precise historical reports of what actually 
happened (Myth, 93), Moss concludes, The conclusion is inescapable that none of the early 
Christian martyrdom stories is completely historically accurate.  Even if portions of the accounts are 
possible and even probable, we cant be sure that they provide us with accurate information about the 
manner in which the Christians died.we cannot know for certain that the details of these stories are 
true (Myth, 124).  Such criteria renders all historical inquiry impossible.  As Steve Mason, Josephus 
and the New Testament (Peabody: Hendrickson, 1992), 234 accurately states, history, comprising 
pure facts about the past, does not exist anywhere.  By definition, the pastVespasians campaign 
against the Jews, the career of Josephus in Galilee, or the aims of John the Baptistno longer exists.  
So it is not immediately accessible to us.  This does not render the historical task meaningless, 
however, but clarifies the interpretive task and appreciates the complexities of historical 
reconstruction.  Third, her criteria of authenticity, detectable but never clearly stated, postures all 
historical evidence against the martyrdom traditions.  Specifically, if a text betrays scriptural allusions 
(Ancient, 63-65, 125-126) of any kind, Moss concludes that doubt is certainly caston the texts 
status as an eyewitness report (Ancient, 63).  Positing that all of the early Christian martyr stories 
have been altered (Myth, 124), Moss observes, What this means with respect to the authenticity of 
the account is that the narrative is not pristine or unedited (Myth, 117).  Startlingly, she pejoratively 
quips, Are we venerating saints or scribal errors? (Myth, 117).  If scriptural allusions discredit an 
Chapter 5 
 The final query addresses the escalation of Christian killings in the second 
and third centuries C.E.  As early as 108 C.E. with the martyrdom of Ignatius,87 
Christians experience an increase in the physical persecution that leads to death.  The 
trials of Christians under Pliny the Younger (ca. 111 C.E.),88 the martyrdom of 
accounts authenticity, then even Jesus crucifixion could be discounted.  Even still, as Maureen A. 
Tilley, Review: Ancient Christian Martyrdom by Candida Moss, TS 74.2 (2013): 486 remarks, If 
this were so, [Moss] would need to discount the photographic record and the eyewitness testimony of 
opponents of the Mexican martyr Padre Miguel Pro, S.J. (d. 1927), whose execution exhibits many 
parallels with the passion of Jesus and the martyrdom of Polycarp.  Fourth, Mosss conclusions, at 
times, do not follow the evidence and argumentation provided.  For example, in her conclusion for the 
Martyrdom of Polycarp, Moss states, The unvarnished truth is that we dont know when this story 
was written.  Theres no single piece of evidence that can help us pin down the date of the texts 
composition precisely, but if we have to make an educated guess, then we would say that the account 
was written in the third century, when voluntary martyrdom and relic collection had already emerged 
as religious practices.  What this means is that the earliest martyrdom account, the document that 
scholars believe began and fed interest in martyrdom, is a pious fraud (Myth, 104, emphasis added).  
Although a bit forceful, Radner, Unmythical, 54 accurately reflects on this progression, 
Speculations become probabilities, which become assertions, which become facts, which prove the 
early Christians fraudulently invented martyrdoms.  Sixth, as stated above (footnote 54), Moss 
persistently adopts the perspective of the elite (Myth, 163) and ignores (if not vilifies) the subject 
perspective.  As evidence to prove that Christians were stubborn, petulant, difficult, and, at times, 
completely incomprehensible (Myth, 179), Moss offers the second-century Martyrs of Lyons account 
in which a martyr named Sanctus refused to give the judge any informationand instead answered 
all questions by saying, I am a Christian (Myth, 178).  She continues with this critique of Sanctus 
(and other Christian martyrs), Although we might be able to empathize with Christian refusals to 
worship the emperor, this sort of behavior was for some the kind of unnecessary stubbornness that 
invited trouble.  To an ancient Roman observer this practice seemed perverse.  Is it really necessary to 
refuse to give ones name in a trial?  Even in modern American trials in which defendants regularly 
take the fifth in order to avoid answering questions, theyre not usually evasive about their own 
names.  To the Romans, and in anyones estimation, the Christians were difficult in the courtroom.  
The problem with this conclusion is that it assesses the situation purely from the perspective of the 
dominant elite.  In the ancient world, oftentimes, names revealed a lot more than just a persons 
appellation.  Indeed, names could reveal familial origin, location, allegiances, and more.  From the 
subject perspective, if Christians were fearful of further persecution for their family, it is not 
unthinkable, then, for the response to be vague in order to protect others.  Seventh, her reconstruction 
of religio-political issues in the Roman world suggest not the absence of increased hostility in the 
second and third centuries C.E., but just the opposite.  Moss, Myth, 175-176 accurately states, The 
Christians, as is by now clear, would not participate in the imperial cult, and to the Romans, this state 
of affairs was dangerous.  From an ancient perspective, the presence of a religiously noncompliant 
group in any community was a threat to that community.  Human flourishing was a delicate affair, and 
religion was one way in which health, political success, independence, good harvest, fine weather, and 
all aspects of everyday life were managed.  The Christians threatened all of this.  They threatened to 
disrupt the pax deorum (peace of the gods) and, in doing so, invited destruction on everyone.  For 
the Romans, Christians nonparticipation in the imperial cult was threatening.  Their stubbornness was 
not just disrespectful and iconoclastic; it could potentially bring down the empire.Christian 
subversiveness was, in the eyes of the Romans, far-reaching and dangerous.  Therefore, while Mosss 
work positively encourages further discussion regarding hagiography and historicity, her broad 
conclusions of the socio-historical context of the second and third centuries are deficient.

Chapter 5 
Polycarp, the bishop of Smyrna (ca. 155 C.E.),89 and the persecution of Christians 
under Marcus Aurelius in Lyons (ca. 177 C.E.),90 to name a few, exemplify a 
heightened physical persecution of Christians in the second century91.  This possibly 
prompted the composition of Tertullians Apologeticus (ca. 197 C.E.) to absolve 
Christians of further physical persecution.  Nevertheless, this precedent continues 
throughout the third century with the persecutions of Decius (ca. 250 C.E.) and 
Diocletian (ca. 284 C.E.).92 
As James C. Scott advises,93 the manifestation of violence in the public 
transcript does not indicate the initial point of tension between the sovereigns and the 
subjects.  Instead, the violence of a peasant revolt94 is evidence of tension that 
existed below the surface for quite some time (i.e., offstage in the hidden 
transcripts).  Similarly, the dramatic display of physical persecution toward 
Christians in the second and third centuries suggests the time period that led up to 
these manifestations of violence contained latent tension between the Roman society 
and the Christian community.  As a result, it is odd to assume that Domitians reign, 
and even his brother and father before him, was only congenial towards the 
Christians in light of what follows shortly thereafter.   
A more believable reconstruction is an atmosphere of tension under Domitian 
in which non-physical persecution was heightened and which, at times, resulted in

physical persecution (sometimes even death).  This was then exacerbated early in the 
second century under Trajan and progressed in intensity thereafter.  This explanation 
not only fits the historical evidence more adequately, but also coincides with the 
picture depicted in Revelation described above. 
A New Way Forward:  
The Persecution of Christians Under Domitian 
 So is there evidence to support such a setting for Christians under the reign of 
Domitian?  Three trajectories of the socio-historical context coalesce to provide an 
answer to this query: [1] the Anti-Jewish propaganda of the Flavian Dynasty, [2] an 
intensification of the Anti-Jewish environment in Domitians reign, and [3] the lack 
of distinction between the Christians and the Jews after 70 C.E. 
Anti-Jewish Propaganda of the Flavian Dynasty 
 The relationship between the Jewish people and the Roman Empire in the 
Julio-Claudian dynasty was full of highs and lows.95  Even though Julius Caesar and 
Augustus were generally convivial with the Jewish people, the reigns of Tiberius, 
Caligula, and Claudius were not as cordial.  In fact, the Jews were expelled from 
Rome in the reigns of both Tiberius96 and Claudius,97 and Caligula even attempted to 
have a statue placed in the temple in Jerusalem.98  Nevertheless, these actions were 
more the exception in the Julio-Claudian dynasty rather than the rule.  After the 
Jewish rebellion of 66-70 C.E., however, the accession of the Flavian dynasty

inaugurated a distinct shift.  As Martin Goodman notes, The conquest of Judaea in 
70 CE was celebrated in Rome with a degree of hostile propaganda unique in Roman 
celebration of a suppressed revolt.99  In fact, as seen below, the victory of the 
Jewish War served as the foundational myth for the entire Flavian dynasty.100 
 As Suetonius points out, the Flavians suffered from a lack of imperial 
heritage since they were not a part of the Julio-Claudian line.101  As a result, they 
were hungry for propaganda102 to justify their claim to the throne.  Just as 
Augustus used his victory over Mark Antony and Cleopatra to validate his claim to 
the throne, so too did the Flavians exploit the Judean revolt as their battle of 
Actium.103  The subjugation of the Jewish people not only restored peace to an 
empire in disarray, but it also functioned as a justification for the perpetual reign of 
the Flavian family.104  Therefore, the Anti-Jewish sentiment in the Flavian Dynasty 
was intensified due to its centrality in their foundational myth, which is seen in: [1]

Rome, in Flavius Josephus and Flavian Rome (eds. Jonathan Edmondson, Steve Mason, and James 
Rives; New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), 170.  Goodman goes on to write, The suppression 
of other revolts in the Julio-Claudian period left no mark at all in the city of Rome itself...By contrast, 
the civic centre was largely remodeled to reflect the victory over the Jews and their God (pg. 171).

Rome; [3] Flavian numismatics; and [4] the implementation of the fiscus Iudaicus. 
The Flavian Roman Triumph in 71 C.E. 
 In J.W. 7.116-157, Josephus gives a detailed, eyewitness account of the 
elaborate Roman triumph celebrated for the Flavian victory over their enemies 
(7.157).105  The entire city of Rome attended the spectacle (7.122) to watch the spoils 
of war paraded through the streets, which included silver, gold, and ivory running 
along like a river (7.134).  Along with seven hundred of the most eminently tall 
and handsome captives (7.118),106 elaborate depictions of many resemblances of 
the war (7.142), from a variety of locations throughout the entire rebellion, were 
heralded throughout the procession.  These images celebrated the subjugation of the 
Jewish people (the enemy): 
For there was to be seen a happy country laid waste, and entire squadrons of 
enemies slain; while some of them ran away, and some were carried into 
captivity; with walls of great altitude and magnitude overthrown, and ruined 
by machines; with the strongest fortifications taken, and the walls of most 
populous cities upon the tops of hills seized on, and an army pouring itself 
within the walls; as also every place full of slaughter, and supplications of the 
enemies, when they were no longer able to lift up their hands in way of 
opposition. (7.143-144) 
105 All Josephus quotes that follow are from The Works of Josephus (trans. William Whiston; 
Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson, 1987) unless otherwise noted.  Rajak, Josephus, 218; Kraybill, 
Imperial, 143-144 (n. 11).  For discussion of the Roman triumph in imperial propaganda, see pp. 119-
106 This detail emphasizes the magnificence of Romes accomplishment: the greater the 
appearance of the enemy, the greater the victory of the Romans.  The same logic is used for those in 
the great number of the captives dressed in a variety of garments to conceal from the sight the 
deformity of their bodies (7.138). 
Chapter 5 
According to Josephus, these depictions allowed the audience to experience the 
battles, affording a most lively portraiture of itself (7.142), in such vivid 
representation that it was as if they had been there really present (7.147).107 
The most elaborate depictions, however, were reserved for the destruction of 
the temple itself (7.148).  Certain elements from the razed holy place caught 
Josephuss attention in the procession: the golden table, of the weight of many 
talents, the candlestick made of gold (7.148), and with the last of all the spoils, 
the Law of the Jews (7.150). 
The conclusion of the Roman triumph highlighted the grand entrance of the 
three key figures of the newly inaugurated Flavian dynasty.  Vespasian and Titus 
both rode in the traditional quadriga reserved for the triumphant general, while 
Domitian rode beside them on a horse that was worthy of admiration (7.152).  The 
procession came to a halt at the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, where, according to 
Josephus, the Roman custom was to stand still until the announcement of the 
parades climactic moment: the execution of the key enemy leader (7.153).  When 
word came that the general of the enemy, Simon bar Giora (7.153-154), had been 
executed, great jubilation erupted and a magnificent feast began (7.156).  For this 
was a festival day to the city of Romefor the end was now put to their civil 
miseries, and for the commencement of their hopes of future prosperity and 
happiness (7.157).   
The Roman triumph of 71 C.E., then, was more than a mere celebration of the 
subjugation of an enemy of Rome; it was also the public pronouncement of the 
succession of a new dynasty.  As Mary Beard accurately states, Josephus picked up 
107 Nasrallah, Christian Responses, 162, 242; Portier-Young, Apocalypse, 148-149. 
Chapter 5 
the official spin and made the spectacular ceremonial of 71 the key dynastic moment 
where Julio-Claudian history stoppedand Flavian history started.108  Thus, the 
destruction of the Jewish people in Flavian propaganda is not merely an example of 
military prowess, but it is also a powerful symbol of the Flavian legitimacy to 
reign.109  Naturally, this creates an environment that intensifies Anti-Jewish 
sentiments across the empire. 
The Flavian Reconstruction of the City of Rome 
 The Jewish subjugation was not just celebrated in the moment of the Roman 
triumph; the Flavian dynasty cemented the display of their dominance over the 
Jewish people into the structure of the city of Rome itself.110  During the reign of 
Nero and the internal conflict in 68-69 C.E., the city of Rome endured significant 
alterations, many would say for the worse.  As a result, Vespasian inaugurated an 
extensive rebuilding program (carried on by his sons) in the city of Rome intending 
to restore Rome to herself.111  Aware of this significant opportunity, the Flavians 
utilized this renovation to decorate the city with their dynastic propaganda, and their 
central choice of imagery was the victory over the Jews.  As Jonathan Edmondson 
notes, The defeat of the Jews and the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple were 
enshrined in the very fabric of the urban centre and hence in Roman public memory, 
reminding the inhabitants of the city of the decisive role played by Vespasian and

Titus in that victory.112  Three Flavian constructions demonstrate the perpetuation of 
their foundational myth: [1] The Templum Pacis (Temple of Peace); [2] The 
Arch of Titus; and [3] the Colosseum. 
 In 75 C.E., Vespasian completed the construction of the temple of Peace, 
which was funded by the spoils from the Jewish War.113  More significantly, the 
temple of Peace celebrated the Flavian defeat of the Jews by adorning the Flavian 
monument with the cultic vessels from the temple in Jerusalem, including the 
massive golden table and the golden candlestick featured in the Roman triumph of 71 
C.E.114  This declared that the peace of Rome restored by the Flavians was 
inextricably linked to the subjugation of the Jewish nation in 70 C.E. 
 Similarly, Domitian completed two other structures in the city of Rome 
changing the landscape of the city and enshrining the defeat of the Jewish people: the 
Arch of Titus115 and the Colosseum.116  Domitian erected the Arch of Titus in 82 
C.E. in honor of his brothers victory over the Jewish people.  This static propaganda

114 Josephus, J.W. 7.148, 160-161.  Josephus continues in 7.162, But still he gave orders that 
they should lay up their Law, and the purple veils of the holy place, in the royal palace itself, and keep 
them there.  See also Nasrallah, Christian Responses, 163.  For the significance of similar actions by 
the Seleucid Empire, see Portier-Young, Apocalypse, 151, 153. 
115 The Arch of Titus described here is located on the Via Sacra near the Roman Forum.  The 
remains of another arch in the Circus Maximus is also thought to have been dedicated to Titus, 
constructed in his lifetime, and also in celebration of the triumph over the Jewish people (Aitken, 
Reading, 83).  Steve Mason describes the message of this alternate Arch of Titus, The main points 
come out in the inscription on the arch of Titus that formerly stood in the Circus Maximus: under his 
fathers guidance Titus had subdued the people of the Judaeans and destroyed the city of 
Hierosolyma Everyone knew what subdued and destroyed meant: a barbarian urbs direpta, 
demolished by the irresistible ferocity of Roman arms and then given to the soldiers for revenge 
(Figured Speech, 254-255). 
116 Construction on the Colosseum (or the Flavian Amphitheater) began under Vespasian 
and was likely finished under Titus in 80 C.E.  Nevertheless, Domitian added the underground tunnels 
as well as more seating in the Colosseum to complete the structure that stands today.  For further 
discussion, see Keith Hopkins and Mary Beard, The Colosseum (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard 
University Press, 2011), 2. 
Chapter 5 
depicts the spoils of the Jewish warwith the central focus on the golden 
menorah117frozen in time and cemented into the memory of the empire as key 
symbols of the Flavian foundational myth.  This arch stands in the shadow of the 
Flavian Amphitheater also known as the Colosseum.  Like the temple of Peace, the 
Colosseum was built with the treasures acquired from the Jewish War.118  As a result, 
the gladiatorial games that filled the Colosseum and celebrated Roman dominance 
were housed in the structure financed by Jewish subjugation.  
 Thus, the Flavian dynasty satisfied its thirst for imperial propaganda by 
exploiting the suffering and destruction of the Jewish people in 70 C.E.  To insure 
that the message of Flavian dominance was secure, Vespasian and his sons 
reconstructed the city of Rome, devastated by the civil wars, with the conquest of the 
Jewish people as their central symbol of victory.  This foundational myth 
embedded in the very buildings of Flavian Rome would naturally cultivate an 
environment of Anti-Jewish sentiment.119 
Flavian Numismatics 
 As discussed in chapter three, coins are billboards for imperial propaganda.  
The images and captions of each coin are an opportunity for the sovereign narrative 
to be communicated to the subjects of the empire.  As a result, evidence of Anti-
Jewish sentiment in the Flavian dynasty, if it truly existed, would naturally find a 
place in this static propaganda.

 Beginning in 71 C.E., Vespasian minted coins heralding the subjugation of 
the Jewish people, as seen below.120 
The obverse of the coin shows Vespasian crowned with laurel worn in the Roman 
triumph121 with a caption that celebrates him as the victorious general and emperor of 
the Roman Empire.  On the reverse of the coin, a Jewish female is seated in a 
position of mourning while a Jewish male stands behind a palm tree and in front of a 
pile of weapons with his hands bound behind his back.  The caption articulates what 
the imagery connotes: IUDEA CAPTA.  Judea had been captured.122

122 As Edmondson, Introduction, 10 suggests, the similarity between this Flavian coin 
(IUDEA CAPTA) and Augustus coin minted to celebrate the victory of the Battle of Actium 
(AEGYPTO CAPTA) should not be overlooked.  In the same manner that the battle of Actium 
inaugurated Augustuss reign, so too did the victory of the Jewish War inaugurate the reign of the 
Flavians.  Both battles, then, served as their particular foundational myths to bring legitimacy to 
their claim to the throne. 
Chapter 5 
 This coin was the first in a series of coins, with similar imagery and captions, 
minted to celebrate the defeat of the Jewish people.123  The coins all communicated 
the same message: Rome had captured Judea.  This coinage, however, was not 
limited to the reign of Vespasian.  Indeed, around 79 C.E., Titus minted coins 
celebrating the triumph over the Jewish people,124 and even though Domitian did not 
have a direct role in the Jewish War, he issued coins with IUDEA CAPTA as late as 
85 C.E.fifteen years after the war ended.125 
 The depictions on these celebratory coins and the consistency with which 
they were minted throughout all three Flavian emperors indicate the centrality of the 
Jewish War to their foundational myth.  The Flavians used the Roman coinage as 
imperial billboards to communicate the Anti-Jewish sentiment which fueled their 
legitimacy to the throne.  Judea had been captured, and the Flavians had begun to 
reign. 
The Implementation of the fiscus Iudaicus 
 The Roman civil wars in 69 C.E. not only contributed to the instability of the 
entire empire, but the structures in the city of Rome itself also suffered from the war.  
In fact, the Capitoline temple dedicated to Jupiter was completely destroyed by fire.  
Tacitus laments this event: 
This was the most deplorable and disgraceful event that had happened to the 
Commonwealth of Rome since the foundation of the city; for now, assailed 
by no foreign enemy, with Heaven ready to be propitious, had our vices only

allowed, the seat of Jupiter Supremely Good and Great, founded by our 
ancestors with solemn auspices to be the pledge of Empirewas destroyed 
by the madness of our Emperors.  (Tac., Hist. 3.72 [Church and Brodribb]) 
Immediately, Vespasian seized the opportunity to gain favor for the Flavian dynasty 
by rebuilding the temple to Jupiter.126  However, he did so in a manner that 
celebrated the defeat of the Jewish nation. 
 For decades, the Roman Empire allowed the Jewish people to pay a tax to 
support the temple in Jerusalem, causing some enmity throughout the empire.127  
After the destruction of the temple in 70 C.E., though, the Flavians did not allow the 
Jewish people to rebuild this cultic center, which was a source of both identity and 
rebellion.  As a result, the Jewish tax paid to the temple in Jerusalem was now 
redirected to Rome to pay for the restoration of the temple to Jupitera tax known 
as the fiscus Iudaicus (Jewish Tax).128 
Symbolically, the fiscus Iudaicus communicated at least three key messages.  
First, the Roman Jupiter had conquered the Jewish Yahweh.  The destruction of the 
Jewish temple by pagans was difficult enough, but now, the Jewish people, 
through the fiscus Iudaicus, were to fund the construction and upkeep of a pagan 
god.  As Edmondson notes, The victory of Jupiter over Yahweh could not have 
been advertised more dramatically.129 
 Second, the tax was punishment to the Jews for their rebellion.  Rome was 
not content with retribution on the Jewish rebels alone.  The fiscus Iudaicus fell as

much on the Jews of Egypt and of Rome as on the suppressed rebels of Judea.130  
Through this tax, all of the Jewish people in the empire were punished for the 
rebellion. 
 Third, the tax was a clarion call to the Jewish people to integrate into Rome.  
As Martin Goodman suggests, the redirection of the Jewish tax from the temple of 
Yahweh in Jerusalem to the temple of Jupiter in Rome communicated, both 
symbolically and practically, that the Flavian state had brought Jewish worship to 
an end.131  Unable to acquire the necessary funds, the Jewish hope to rebuild their 
cultic center in Jerusalem was distinctly mitigated.  The result, as James Rives notes, 
was to offer another structure that endowed the Jews with a distinctive corporate 
identitythe new tax, payable as it was to Jupiter Optimus Maximus, clearly worked 
to link the Jews to Rome and its god.132  This tax, then, pressured the Jewish people 
to conform to the Roman sovereign narrative and perpetuated Anti-Jewish sentiments 
throughout the Roman Empire.  
Summary 
 The Flavian dynasty needed substantive justification to replace the Julio-
Claudian line.133  So the Flavians reformulated the suppression of the Jewish 
rebellion in 70 C.E into a magnificent victory over a foreign enemy satisfying their

need for dynastic propaganda.134  As Martin Goodman notes, The new emperor 
could boast of no other achievements, so he made as much capital as he could from 
the defeat of the Jews.135  Through both static and enacted propaganda, the defeat of 
the Jews behaved as a foundational myth for the Flavian dynasty cemented into the 
ever present memory of the Roman and Jewish communities.   
 As a result, an Anti-Jewish atmosphere was fostered throughout the Roman 
Empire.  As Rives notes, the Jewish War no doubt led the Roman elite to view 
Jewish tradition with increased hostility.136  Indeed, following the events of 70 C.E., 
Roman writers found it difficult at times to restrain their hatred for the Jewish 
people,137 just as entire cities expressed Anti-Jewish hostility both during and after 
the Jewish War.138  Even the Christian historian Eusebius, in discussion of 
Hegesippus records, states, [Hegesippus] also relates that Vespasian after the 
conquest of Jerusalem gave orders that all that belonged to the lineage of David 
should be sought out, in order that none of the royal race might be left among the

allow what with us is forbidden (5.4); Jews also have all their other customs, which are at once 
perverse and disgusting, owe their strength to their very badness (5.5); and the Jewish religion is

Jews; and in consequence of this a most terrible persecution again hung over the 
Jews.139  While this previous quote is likely overstated, the significance of the 
statement to the time period should not be missed: the Flavian dynasty fostered an 
environment of Anti-Jewish sentiment due to the centrality of the subjugation of the 
Jewish people in the Flavian propaganda. 
Intensification of the Anti-Jewish Environment in Domitians Reign 
 During Domitians reign, the Anti-Jewish environment intensified.  Like his 
father and brother, Domitian suffered from a lack of imperial lineage to justify his 
reign,140 and yet unlike his father and brother, Domitian had no military 
accomplishments on which to rely.  Domitian had been too young to take part in the 
victory of the Jewish War,141 and when he attempted military conquest in Gaul and 
Germany at the beginning of Vespasians reign, it resulted in memorable 
embarrassment for the brash young prince.142  Consequently, Domitian seems to 
overemphasize the Flavian dynastic glory acquired in the subjugation of the Jewish 
people in 70 C.E., disguising the insecurity of his meager credentials to claim the 
throne.  Hence, an intensification of the Anti-Jewish environment arose in the time of 
139 Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 3.12. 
140 Domitians concern is evident in his building efforts that emphasize the exaltation of 
Vespasian and Titus as well as draw visual connections between the Flavian dynasty and Augustus. 
See Edmondson, Introduction, 11-12; Jones, Domitian, 79-98. 
141 Southern, Domitian, 17-23.  It is true that Domitian did take part in the Roman triumph in 
71 C.E., but Josephus notes (J.W. 7.152) that Domitian did not ride in the quadriga with his father and 
brother, reserved for the victorious general(s) of the war.  Instead, he rode on a horse next to them, 
thereby participating in the glory of the parade but with a clear distinction of his actual role in the war 
itself. 
142 Suet., Dom. 2; Tac., Hist. 4.75-86.  Tac., Hist. 4.86 even suggests that Domitian 
unsuccessfully attempted to commandeer some of the army to overthrow his father and brother.

Domitian which is evident in: [1] Imperial Actions; [2] Imperial Writings; and [3] 
Policy Shifts Under Nerva.143 
Domitianic Imperial Actions 
 Two imperial actions in the time of Domitian suggest an intensification of the 
Anti-Jewish environment: [1] the unique implementation of the fiscus Iudaicus and 
[2] the execution of Clemens and the exile of Domitilla.  At the beginning of 
Domitians reign, the exaggerated rigor and possible expansion of the collection of 
the fiscus Iudaicus precipitates an atmosphere at the end of his reign in which 
punishment for Jewish living could even involve the execution and exile of 
prominent Roman elites. 
 In the early to mid-80s, multiple factors required Domitian to generate more 
funds.144  At the beginning of his reign, Domitian benevolently nullified debts and 
declined taxable inheritances; these altruistic actions did not capitalize on possible 
income for the empire.145  In 82 C.E., Domitian renovated the imperial coinage 
drastically increasing the metal standards for all newly minted coins, a standard only 
143 In addition to these three lines of inquiry, the building projects and numismatics under 
Domitian also contributed to an Anti-Jewish environment (see pp. 181-185 above).  Outside of his 
imperial palace on the Palatine hill (Suet., Dom. 14; Martial 1.70; 8.36; 9.13; 12.15), Domitian rebuilt 
the temple of Jupiter after a fire in 80 C.E. (Dio Cass. 66.24; cf. Suet., Dom. 5), erected the Arch of 
Titus (see pp. 181-183 above), and completed the Colosseum [see Leon Yarden, The Spoils of 
Jerusalem on the Arch of Titus: A Re-investigation (Stockholm: Astroms, 1991)].  For more 
discussion on the building program under Domitian, see James C. Anderson, Jr., A Topographical 
Tradition in Fourth Century Chronicles: Domitians Building Program, Historia: Zeitschrift fr Alte 
Geschichte 32.1 (1983): 93-105; Jean L. Girard, Domitien et Minerve: une prdilection impriale, in 
Aufstieg und Niedergang der rmischen Welt: Geschichte und Kultur Roms im Spiegel der neueren 
Forschung (ed. Wolfgang Haase; Berlin: Gruyter, 1981), 233-245.  Regarding numismatics, as 
described above (pp. 183-185), fifteen years after the Jewish war ended, Domitian (in 85 C.E.) issued 
a coin with the caption: IUDEA CAPTA (RIC 280).  As Goodman, Fiscus, 171 confirms, By 81 CE 
both Vespasian and Titus, the generals who had directed the Judaean campaign and could take direct 
credit for its success, were dead, but propaganda about the war did not come to an end.

argumentation utilized below, see Williams, Domitian, 204.

rivaled by Augustus himself.146  In addition, at the end of the Chattan War in 83 C.E., 
Domitian rewarded the imperial army a significant raise.147  As a result, the financial 
situation in Rome developed into a significant problem, and regardless of Domitians 
initial attempts, he had difficulty in easing his burdens.148 
Embarrassed, Domitian employed questionable methods to accumulate 
wealth resorting to every sort of robbery.149  Dio Cassius relays the disgraceful 
actions, For, as he had no funds from which to make his expenditures, he murdered 
many men, hauling some of them before the senate, but bringing charges against 
others when they were not even present in Rome.  He even went so far as to put some 
out of the way treacherously by means of drugs secretly administered.150  
Domitians unique and sometimes cruel methods to alleviate the financial strain151 
146 Southern, Domitian, 53, 60.  Southern also points out, For three years these high 
standards prevailed, then in 85 there was a debasement of the fine metal content that took the coinage 
back to the Neronian standard of 64, which was still higher than the standard with which Vespasian 
and Titus had operated.  The coinage remained at this level for the rest of Domitians reign (p. 61).

149 Suet., Dom. 12.1 (Rolfe, LCL). 
150 Dio Cass. 67.4.5 (Cary, LCL).  Dio Cassius 67.4.6 (Cary, LCL) continues, Many of the 
peoples tributary to the Romans revolted when contributions of money were forcibly extorted from 
them; among these were the Nasamones.  They massacred all the tax-collectors and so completely 
defeated Flaccus, the governor of Numidia, who proceeded against them, that they even plundered his 
camp.  In agreement, Suet., Dom. 12 states, Reduced to financial straits by the cost of his buildings 
and shows, as well as by the additions which he had made to the pay of the soldiers, he tried to lighten 
the military expenses by diminishing the number of his troops; but perceiving that in this way he 
exposed himself to the attacks of the barbarians, and nevertheless had difficulty in easing his burdens, 
he had no hesitation in resorting to every sort of robbery. The property of the living and the dead was 
seized everywhere on any charge brought by any accuser. It was enough to allege any action or word 
derogatory to the majesty of the prince.  Estates of those in no way connected with him were 
confiscated, if but one man came forward to declare that he had heard from the deceased during his 
lifetime that Caesar was his heir (Rolfe, LCL). 
151 In response to the accusation that this situation suffers from historical embellishment, 
Southern, Domitian, 61, writes, The confiscations are too well attested (though they are perhaps 
exaggerated in scale) to deny that they occurred.  They were certainly in evidence towards the end of 
Domitians reign, as attested by Plinys story of Corellius Rufus, old and very sick, but determined to 
live through his constant pain at least one day longer than the Emperor in order to deprive the robber 
(latronus) of the pleasure of claiming his property. 
Chapter 5 
intersected with the Anti-Jewish trajectories of the Flavian dynasty in an 
intensification of the fiscus Iudaicus. 
 Although scholars debate whether Domitian expanded the Jewish tax or 
merely closed the loopholes,152 the majority of scholars agree that the fiscus 
Iudaicus was collected with intensified rigor.153  Suetonius, Dom. 12.2 (Rolfe, LCL) 
concurs, Besides other taxes, that on the Jews was levied with the utmost rigour, 
and those were prosecuted who without publicly acknowledging that faith yet lived 
as Jews, as well as those who concealed their origin and did not pay the tribute levied 
upon their people.154  That the intensification was motivated by financial difficulties 
in no way eliminates that this was a type of persecution against the Jews.155  As 
Jonathan Edmondson notes, The operations of the fiscus Iudaicus seem to have 
become even more intrusive under Domitian, as general hostility towards the Jews 
increased.156   
In particular, Suetonius records a striking eyewitness account of the extent to 
which this tax was enforced under Domitian in Rome: I recall being present in my

154 Emphasis added.  Suetonius appears to identify two groups: [1] proselytes to Judaism and 
[2] those born Jewish.  In light of the point in Williams, Domitian, 199, that proselytes on 
conversion literally became Jews, those who lived as Jews, as Suetonius describes them, were 
liable to pay the Jewish tax [see also E. M. Smallwood, Domitians Attitude toward the Jews and 
Judaism, CP 51 (1956): 1-13; Keresztes, Jews, 4-5].  The second group is those who were born 
Jews but avoided the tax, possibly due to their apostasy or in rejection of the symbolic subjugation of 
the Jewish people [see K. J. Neumann, Der rmische Staat und die allgemeine Kirche bis auf 
Diocletian (Leipzig: Veit, 1890), 1.7; Adolf Hausrath, Neutestamentliche Zeitgeschichte (Heidelberg: 
Bassermann, 1874), 3.296].  It is possible, then, that both groups could have contained Christians [So 
George Edmundson, The Church in Rome in the First Century (London: Longmans, 1913), 222].

youth when the person of a man ninety years old was examined before the procurator 
and a very crowded court, to see whether he was circumcised (Dom. 12.2 [Rolfe, 
LCL]).157  In an honor/shame society, to be stripped naked in public would have been 
appalling, especially for a Jew who found this to be completely odious.158  Ronald 
Syme concludes, The ruthless exaction of the Fiscus Iudaicus is not a mere by-
product of financial straits, but is something very much like a persecution.159 
 Domitians actions in the fiscus Iudaicus reveal an imperial atmosphere in 
which Anti-Jewish sentiments were intensified; this is accentuated through his 
actions in 95 C.E. toward the prominent, noble Roman couple: Clemens and 
Domitilla.  Dio Cassius records a startling account:  
And the same year Domitian slew, along with many others, Flavius Clemens 
the consul, although he was a cousin and had to wife Flavia Domitilla, who 
was also a relative of the emperors.  The charge brought against them both 
was that of atheism, a charge on which many others who drifted into Jewish 
ways were condemned. Some of these were put to death, and the rest were at 
least deprived of their property.  Domitilla was merely banished to 
Pandateria.160

inception of his reign, which read: FISCI IUDAICI CALUMNIA SUBLATAabolition of

Christians: Graeco-Roman Views (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984), 105.  For more 
discussion on Nerva and this mint, see pp. 207-209 below].  Some suggest that Domitian was simply 
neutral toward the Jews in his collection of the tax and Suet., Dom. 12.2 is merely an example of 
Domitians meticulousness.  In response, Williams, Domitian, 203 states, This interpretation, 
common though it is, is impossible to accept.  [1] No evidence is ever offered in support of the 
contention that Suetonius is exaggerating and there is no reason to suppose that he was.  [2] None of 
his other personal reminiscences about his adulescentia is ever criticized on this score.  Why should 
this one be treated any differently?  [3] That the incident itself is inherently plausible is confirmed by 
Martial VII.82a contemporary poem whose humour resides in the unsuccessful attempts of a certain 
Menophilus to conceal his circumcision by the means of a giant fibula.  This surely shows, given the 
frequent topicality of Martials humour, that the deliberate concealment of circumcision was in all 
likelihood a feature of the time.

The two-fold accusation of atheism161 and Jewish living has caused endless 
speculation as to whether Flavius Clemens and Flavia Domitilla were converts to 
Judaism162 or converts to Christianity.163  Even though a precise conclusion on this 
issue is highly suspect, the significance of this account, often overlooked, is the 
disclosure of the magnitude of Domitians Anti-Jewish sentiments. 
 In the immediate context preceding Dio Cass. 67.14.1-3, both Vespasian164 
and Titus165 refuse to punish victims of similar accusations leveled against Clemens 
and Domitilla.166  Dio Cassius, then, presents Domitians actions against Clemens 
and Domitilla as a clear example of Domitians deviation from the balanced rule of 
his father and brother.167  Whether Clemens and Domitilla were converts of Judaism 
or Christianity is inconsequential; what is noteworthy is that, according to Domitian, 
the accusation of Jewish living was sufficient to merit execution and/or banishment

of Romans with uniquely high social status.168  These imperial actions, then, indicate 
a significant intensification of the Anti-Jewish environment in the reign of Domitian.  
The Anti-Jewish foundational myth of the Flavian family was not merely 
continued, but exaggerated in his reign. 
Domitianic Imperial Writings 
 When Domitian is the audience of imperial writers, his interests and 
sentiments affect not only what is written but also how it is written.  Domitians 
intensification of the Anti-Jewish atmosphere is evident in two categories of 
writings: [1] Anti-Jewish Writings for Domitian and [2] Jewish Writings under 
Domitian.  While the former contains writing topics influenced by Domitians 
particular taste, the latter exhibits writing methods that intend to avoid Domitians 
detection.  Both categories, however, reveal an atmosphere in which Anti-Jewish 
sentiments were widespread and, indeed, expected. 
 Anti-Jewish elements in the writings for Domitian are significant in that the 
author writes in order to connect with his primary audience.  As Margaret H. 
Williams notes, that Domitian was, at the very least, deeply unsympathetic to 
Jews and Judaismis surely indicated quite clearly by the stridently anti-Jewish tone 
and subject matter of much of the literature that was dedicated to him.169  In 
particular, Williams argues that the Anti-Jewish poems by Martial and Quintilian, 
168 Clemens was a consul with Domitian in 95 C.E., and both Clemens and Domitilla were 
the parents of Domitians two adopted heirs (both of whom were educated by Quintilian [Inst. 4.1.2]).  
See Suet., Dom. 15.1. 
169 Williams, Domitian, 205. 
Chapter 5 
both writing for Domitian, indicate the poets knew what material their audience 
would enjoy.170  
 According to Williams, the poems of Quintilian and Martial share the same 
sentiments as Domitian in other areas besides the Anti-Jewish element.  She notes 
Quintilians outbursts against philosophers and Domitians drive against them171 
and describes Martial as a conformist in every way in that it is hard to find any 
topic, whether sexual, religious, social or political, where he does not toe the party 
line.172  In other words, both Quintilian and Martials content reflects the attitudes 
and sentiments of their audience, Domitian. 
 With this in place, Williams provides examples of Anti-Jewish elements in 
Quintilian and Martial.  For example, Quintilian refers to Moses as the founder of 
the Jewish superstition and labels the Jews a race which is a curse to others.173  
Similarly, Martial mocks the Jewish people for their peculiar practice of 
circumcision174 and even their subjugation to Rome.175  With Domitian as the 
170 These sources, along with Statius, are considered the unbiased writings by Thompson in 
his argument against an anti-Christian Domitian (see pp. 160-165). 
171 Williams, Domitian, 197. 
172 Williams, Domitian, 197.  In support of this claim, she cites: Martial 1.24; 7.58; 9.27, 
47; 6.2 (cf. Suet., Dom. 7.1). 
173 Inst. 3.7.21 (Butler, LCL).  Williams, Domitian, 206 suggests a significant motivation 
for Quintilians Anti-Jewish references, Penned in all probability after the downfall of Quintilians 
patron, Flavius Clemens, it is usually seen, and rightly so, as a deliberate attempt on Quintilians part 
to demonstrate that he was clean on the sensitive subject of Judaizing, whatever the unfortunate 
proclivities of his erstwhile patron. 
174 Martial 7.30, 35, 82; 11.94.  Williams, Domitian, 205, states, Book VII, in fact, is 
notable for the greatest concentration of anti-semitic poems anywhere in Martial.  Martial 7.99 
dedicates this book to Domitian. 
175 Martial 7.55.  See also Martial 4.4 and 12.57. 
Chapter 5 
intended audience, the works of Martial and Quintilian indicate that Anti-Jewish 
attitudes and sentiments were warmly received in the current environment.176 
 To limit the evidence to Anti-Jewish literature written for Domitian, though, 
ignores the significance of the Jewish writings under Domitian, particularly the 
works of Flavius Josephus.  Traditionally, Josephuss works have been treated as 
straight forward presentations of history, but recently, historians have questioned 
the validity of such a conclusion.177  Describing the Roman world in the first-century 
C.E., Vasily Rudich writes, It was an uncanny world of illusion and delusion, of 
ambivalences and ambiguities on all levels of social interaction.178  While the work 
of James C. Scott labels this type of interaction hidden transcripts,179 the ancient 
world commonly referred to it as irony.180   
D.C. Muecke defines irony as the art of saying something without really 
saying it.  It is an art that gets its effects from below the surface.181  As mentioned 
176 Williams, Domitian, 197-198.  Other contemporary and later writers that share this 
same Anti-Jewish trajectory include: Tac., Hist. 5.5.1-13; Philostratus, Vit. Apoll. 5.33; Origen, Cels. 
5.41. 
177 Josephuss occasion/purpose for writing (i.e., Flavian propaganda, recording of history, 
Jewish apologetic, etc.) has been widely debated.  For further discussion, see Seth Schwartz, Josephus 
and Judaean Politics (Leiden: Brill, 1990), 1-2, 8, 10-11, 209; Rajak, Josephus, 185, 195-197; idem,

above, this form of communication was even taught in the schools of rhetoric.182  
Quintilian instructs: 
Similar, if not identical with this figure is another, which is much in vogue at 
the present time. For I must now proceed to the discussion of a class of figure 
which is of the commonest occurrence and on which I think I shall be 
expected to make some comment. It is one whereby we excite some suspicion 
to indicate that our meaning is other than our words would seem to 
implyhidden meaning which is left to the hearer to discover.183 
According to Quintilian, an environment in which it is unsafe to speak openly 
(9.2.66) is precisely the setting in which irony, or hidden transcripts, should be 
used.  Indeed, Dio Chrysostom, Or. 3.13, writing about Domitians reign, states, It 
used to seem necessary to everyone to lie, on account of fear.184 
As Steve Mason points out, this elusive practice of irony was known by the 
Roman rulers185 and even, at times, attempts to eradicate it were implemented.186  
Domitian, for example, is described as executing Hermogenes of Tarsus because of 
some allusions in his History,187 as well as Helvidius alleging that in a farce 
composed for the stage he had under the characters of Paris and Oenone censured 
Domitians divorce from his wife.188  Regardless, the practice of hidden 
transcripts thrived in the Roman world, even in the works of the Jewish Historian: 
Flavius Josephus.

Although hidden transcripts are found in all of Josephuss writings,189 the 
shift in content and tone between Jewish War (written in the time of Vespasian and 
Titus)190 and the Antiquities of the Jews (written in the reign of Domitian)191 
highlights Domitians Anti-Jewish intensification.  In the reign of Vespasian, 
Josephus was favorably treated,192 probably due to his well-known prophetic 
proclamation of the forthcoming emperorship of Vespasian.193  During this time, 
Josephus wrote Jewish War, in which the Romans are generally presented in a 
favorable light.194  Written under Domitians reign, the Antiquities of the Jews, 
however, offers a distinct shift in tone as Josephus constantly references the forgotten 
Jewish religious liberties.195

Vespasians accession to the throne.  For example, Suet., Vesp. 5.6 (Rolfe, LCL), one of 
[Vespasians] high-born prisoners, Josephus by name, as he was being put in chains, declared most 
confidently that he would soon be released by the same man, who would then, however, be emperor.

Chapter 5 
This shift seems to indicate not only a change in content but, more 
importantly, an alteration in the environment of the Jewish people.  As Shirley Case 
notes, The change of tone and difference of emphasis in the discussion of certain 
topics in the Antiquities, as compared with the War, clearly indicate that the Jews 
were much less at ease in the time of Domitian than even in the early years 
immediately following their subjugation by Titus.196  A hidden transcript in the 
Antiquities of the Jews surfaces in three key differences with Jewish War: [1] Ironic 
Discrepancies; [2] Ironic Omissions; and [3] Ironic Additions. 
 When Jewish War and the Antiquities of the Jews are compared, ironic 
discrepancies emerge in key events.  For instance, Josephus goes to great lengths in 
J.W. to demonstrate that Titus did not want to destroy the temple in 70 C.E.197  In 
Josephuss account, Titus called together some of his trusted officials to decide 
what should be done about the holy house (6.238).  After listening to their opinions 
(6.239-240), Titus came to this conclusion:  
Although the Jews should get upon that holy house, and fight us thence, yet 
ought we not to revenge ourselves on things that are inanimate, instead of the 
men themselves; and that he was not in any case for burning down so vast a 
work as that was, because this would be a mischief to the Romans 
themselves, as it would be an ornament to their government while it 
continued (6.241). 
So Titus commanded the cohorts to make their way through the ruins, and quench 
the fire (6.243).  Threatening the success of the Roman army (6.244-248), Titus 
refused to give in to the temptation to destroy the temple with fire and instead chose 
196 Case, Josephus, 13.  See also Mason, Audience, 78; Schwartz, Josephus, 17; Cohen, 
Josephus, 236. 
197 Rajak, Josephus, 206 calls this account the most notable instance of compassion ascribed 
to Titus.  For further discussion, see Rajak, Josephus, 206-213; cf. Mason, Audience, 100). 
Chapter 5 
to storm the temple with his whole army (6.249).  Nevertheless, the temple was 
still set on fire.   
In response, Josephus blames every possible agent for the fire except Titus: a 
wayward soldier (6.251-252), the Jews themselves (6.251), and even God (6.250).  In 
an effort to completely absolve Titus of the fire whatsoever, Josephus portrays Titus 
strenuously attempting to stop the already raging inferno: 
And now a certain person came running to Titus, and told him of this fire, as 
he was resting himself in his tent after the last battle; whereupon he rose up in 
great haste and, as he was, ran to the holy house, in order to have a stop put to 
the fire; after him followed all his commanders, and after them followed the 
several legions, in great astonishmentThen did Caesar, both by calling to 
the soldiers that were fighting, with a loud voice, and by giving a signal to 
them with his right hand, order them to quench the fire; but they did not hear 
what he said, though he spake so loud, having their ears already dinned by a 
greater noise another way; nor did they attend to the signal he made with his 
hand neither, as still some of them were distracted with fighting, and others 
with passion (6.254-257). 
Josephus records one last ditch effort to quench the fire after Titus entered the holy 
place and found it to be far superior to what the relations of foreigners contained 
(6.260).  At this point, Titus came in haste and endeavored to persuade the soldiers 
to quench the fire, and gave order to Liberalius the centurion, and one of those 
spearmen that were about him, to beat the soldiers that were refractory with their 
staves, and to restrain them (6.262).  And yet, because of the zeal of the soldiers and 
their hatred of the Jews (6.263), the fire began to engulf the entire temple.  
Josephus emphatically ends the account with, And thus the holy house burnt down, 
without Caesars approbation.198 
 Therefore, in J.W., Josephus painstakingly depicts Titus as the failed hero 
who tenaciously fought to save the temple of Yahweh from conflagration.  It is quite 
198 J.W. 6.266 [emphasis added]. 
Chapter 5 
peculiar, then, when Josephus, in an unapologetic and flippant manner, records in the 
Ant. 20.250, Accordingly the number of the high priests, from the days of Herod 
until the day when Titus took the temple and the city, and burnt them, were in all 
twenty-eight.199  Regardless of whether Titus actually attempted to stop the fire or 
not,200 the Antiquities of the Jews (written under Domitian), refuses to offer any 
pardon, and in direct contradiction to J.W., implicates Titus in the burning of the 
temple and the city of Jerusalem.  The Roman ruler does not appear benevolent to the 
Jewish people at all; instead, he is the direct perpetrator of the temples devastation.  
Such a shift does not indicate new historical information at Josephuss disposal, but 
supports a significant alteration in the relationship between Josephus and the Flavian 
dynasty under Domitian.201 
 Similarly, Josephus seems to utilize hidden transcripts by ironically 
omitting details and events from Ant. that prove quite significant in J.W.  For 
instance, in J.W., a central symbol of Jewish loyalty to Rome is the temple sacrifices 
199 Emphasis added.  Rives, Flavian, 147, records three other sources that attest to Titus 
burning the temple: [1] Dio, in his very different version of these events, which unfortunately 
survives only in Byzantine epitomes (66.62-3), simply describes the Romans storming the Temple and 
says that when the soldiers hung back because of superstitious fear, Titus forced them on[2] there 
are two accounts from Latin Christian writers of the early fifth century CE.  Sulpicius Severus says 
that Titus summoned a council and considered whether or not to destroy the Temple; some argued 
there was no need, but others, including Titus himself, thought that it ought to be destroyed so that the 
religio of the Jews and the Christians could be more fully wiped out (Chron. 2.30.6-7)[3] Orosius 
reports that after the Temple had been taken, Titus deliberated whether to burn it or preserve it as a 
monument to his victory.  But since the Church was already spreading throughout all the world, it was 
Gods will that the now useless Temple be destroyed, and so Titus did (7.9.5-6).  See also b. Gi. 56b. 
200 Rives, Flavian, 147-148, however, accurately states, Josephus was thus apparently 
alone in his insistence on Titus attempts to preserve the Temple.  Moreover, his account of the 
destruction contains discrepancies that confirm the assumption that he deliberately shaped his 
account. 
201 Mason, Flavius, 571 and Case, Josephus, 15 also point out the discrepancy between 
J.W. and the Ant. in regards to the depiction of Herod.  In particular, they describe the praise of 
Herods building programs in J.W. (1.407, 422-428) and the condemnation of his building programs in 
Ant. (15.328-330, 363-365); the grandeur of Caesar and Roma statues described in J.W. (1.414) and 
the negligence of the statues in the same account in Ant. (15.339); and the benevolent act of 
introducing Roman games in Judea in J.W. (1.415-416) and the same performances as violations of 
the Jewish religion that even lead to an assassination attempt in Ant. (15.288). 
Chapter 5 
for the wellbeing of the emperor.  In J.W. 2.197-198, Petronius declares to the Jewish 
people Caligulas decision to erect an imperial statue in the temple in Jerusalem.  The 
Jews naturally protest: 
Petronius then quieted them, and said to them, Will you then make war 
against Caesar?  The Jews said, We offer sacrifices twice every day for 
Caesar, and for the Roman people; but that if he would place the images 
among them, he must first sacrifice the whole Jewish nation; and that they 
were ready to expose themselves, together with their children and wives, to 
be slain. 
The sacrifices for Caesars wellbeing, then, are evidence of Jewish fidelity to the 
Roman Empire.  Likewise, in J.W. 2.409, Josephus identifies the true beginning of 
our war with the Romans as the cessation of the sacrifices for the emperor.  
Comparable with other acts of treachery like killing Roman soldiers (2.408), the 
eradication of the sacrifices for the emperor was opposed by high priests and 
principal men (2.410)202 because of its symbolic potency. 
 It is telling, then, that Josephus does not describe the Jewish sacrifices for the 
wellbeing of the emperor in Ant. at all.  In fact, Ant. 16.157-158 seems to emphasize 
a different trajectory altogether.203  Just before this text, Josephus describes the 
institution of the Olympic games by Herod, which involved, among other things, 
imperial sacrifices (16.148-149).  Then, Josephus criticizes Herod for [1] severe 
punishments (16.151) and [2] his self-aggrandizement in his demands for honor 
(16.156), including honorable actions paid to Caesar himself (16.157).  In response, 
Josephus states, But now the Jewish nation is by their law a stranger to all such 
things, and accustomed to prefer righteousness to glory; for which reason that nation 
was not agreeable to him, because it was out of their power to flatter the kings 
202 See also J.W. 2.413-415. 
203 Rajak, Political Thought, 239. 
Chapter 5 
ambition with statues or temples, or any other such performances204  Without any 
clarification for ways in which the Jewish people honor and show loyalty to the 
empire, Josephus ends his account of Herods crimes as to his own courtiers and 
counsellors, and of his benefactions as to foreigners and those that had no relation to 
him (16.159).   
 This ironic omission indicates a shift between J.W. and Ant.  In J.W. Josephus 
goes out of his way to highlight the Jewish peoples loyalty to Rome through 
sacrifices for the wellbeing of the emperor.  Ant. is oddly silent on this issue, if not 
offering trajectories to the contrary.  This indicates not just a shift in Josephuss 
content but a shift in the Jewish/Roman relationship under the reign of Domitian. 
Finally, Josephus includes ironic additions in Ant. that are either not found in 
J.W. or drastically enhanced.  For example, Shirley Case points out that imperial 
decrees are a new feature in the Antiquities that do not appear in J.W.205  Although 
several decrees surface throughout Ant.,206 none display a hidden transcript more 
plainly than an edict issued by Caesar Augustus, inscribed upon a pillar in the 
temple of Caesar (16.165), and in favor of the Jews poorly treated in the cities of 
Asia (16.160-161): 
Caesar Augustus, high priest and tribune of the people, ordains thus:Since 
the nation of the Jews have been found grateful to the Roman people, not 
only at this time but in times past also, and chiefly Hyrcanus the high priest, 
under my father, Caesar the emperor, it seemed good to me and my 
counsellors, according to the sentence and oath of the people of Rome, that 
the Jews have liberty to make use of their own customs, according to the law 
of their forefathers, as they made use of them under Hyrcanus, the high priest 
of Almighty God; and that their sacred money be not touched, but be sent to 
Jerusalem, and that it be committed to the care of the receivers at 
204 Josephus, Ant. 16.158 [emphasis added]. 
205 Case, Josephus, 10-20. 
206 Ant. 19.281-285, 287-291, 303-311. 
Chapter 5 
Jerusalem.but if any be caught stealing their holy books, or their sacred 
money, whether it be out of the synagogue or public school, he shall be 
deemed a sacrilegious person, and his goods shall be brought into the public 
treasury of the Romans.And if anyone transgress any part of what is above 
decreed, he shall be severely punished. (16.162-165) 
 This decree offers a potent critique of the Anti-Jewish actions of Domitian 
contemporary with the texts composition.  The decree begins with Augustus musing 
over the positive affections between the Roman people and the nation of the Jews 
(16.162).  This forms the foundation for Augustuss declaration that the Jews should 
not be persecuted for their customs (16.163).  Augustus continues and specifically 
demands the protection of the Jewish sacred money that was sent to Jerusalem 
(16.163).207  He mandates that the punishment for violating this prohibition is to 
identify the person accurately as sacrilegious and to strip them of their goods 
(16.164).  Ironically, the sacred money was rerouted after 70 C.E. to the temple of 
Jupiter through the fiscus Iudaicus, which Domitian collected with egregious rigor 
(see discussion above).   
The fact that Josephus puts this decree in the mouth of Caesar Augustus 
should not be easily overlookedfor the sovereignty of Augustus far outweighs the 
claims of Domitian.  Indeed, Josephus seems to use this decree, and others, as a 
threat aimed at Domitian.  The peril announced by Augustus at the end of the decree 
rings especially potent: And if anyone transgress any part of what is above decreed, 
he shall be severely punished (16.165).  The decree, only found in Ant., functions as 
207 See also Ant. 14.216; 16.166, 167-168, 171. 
Chapter 5 
a hidden transcript in which Josephus records history in the past in order to 
dialogue with the present Anti-Jewish intensification under Domitian.208 
 In sum, Josephus in J.W. displays a much different tone than what is found in 
Ant.  This shift indicates a change in the social situation of the Jewish people under 
Domitian.209  The presence of hidden transcripts in the rhetorical ironies above210 
suggests an attempt by Josephus to critique the present situationan intensification 
208 Case, Josephus, 17-19; James S. McLaren, Jews and the Imperial Cult: From Augustus 
to Domitian, JSNT 27.3 (2005): 263-271 point out the ironic addition of Gaius Caligula in the Ant. 
compared to the brief treatment of the emperor in J.W.  In particular, J.W. 2.184-203 gives a cursory 
account of the attempt by Caligula to put a statue of himself in the temple in Jerusalem (ca. 40 C.E.).  
As Case, Josephus, 18, indicates, the story was told without drawing there from any notable 
lessons to warn rulers against a similar procedure, except that the violent death of Gaius would teach 
sobriety to his successor [War, II, 208].  In Ant. 18.257-308; 19.1-211, however, Josephus articulates 
the events of Caligula in great detail and length.  At the conclusion of this discourse, Josephus, in a 
strikingly candid manner, states the purpose of this ironic addition, [Caligulas] death came very 
fortunately for the preservation of the laws of all men, and had a great influence upon the public 
welfare; and this happened most happily for our nation in particular, which had almost utterly perished 
if he had not been suddenly slain; and I confess I have a mind to give a full account of this matter 
particularly, because it will afford great assurance of the power of God, and great comfort to those 
that are under afflictions, and wise caution to those who think their happiness will never end, nor 
bring them at length to the most lasting miseries, if they do not conduct their lives by the principles of 
virtue (19.15-16emphasis added).  This shift seems to describe, almost too clearly, the situation in 
which Ant. was composed under Domitiana time of Jewish affliction. 
209 See Mason, Flavius, 579-587, for discussion on the ironic critique of Tiberius as a 
tyrant ruler in Josephus and the parallels between Domitian and Tiberius known in Josephuss 
contemporary setting. 
210 In addition, Steve Mason, Figured Speech, 272 points out the decidedly anti-
monarchical, senatorial aristocracy that is prominent in Ant.  In light of the contentious relationship 
between Domitian and the Roman Senate [So Unknown Author, Inscription, 117; Syme, 
Antonius, 12-21; Pleket, Domitian, 296-315; Price, Ritual, 178], the description in Ant. 4.223-224 
is startling: Aristocracy, and the way of living under it, is the best constitution; and may you never 
have any inclination to any other form of government; and may you always love that form, and have 
the laws for your governors, and govern all your actions according to them; for you need no supreme 
governor but God. But if you shall desire a king, let him be one of your own nation; let him be always 
careful of justice and other virtues perpetually; let him submit to the laws, and esteem Gods 
commands to be his highest wisdom; but let him do nothing without the high priest and the votes of 
the senators; let him not have a great number of wives, nor pursue after abundance of riches, nor a 
multitude of horses, whereby he may grow too proud to submit to the laws. And if he affect any such 
things, let him be restrained, lest he become so potent that his state be inconsistent with your welfare 
[see also Josephus, Ant. 6.36; 11.111; 14.91].  This depiction of the ideal government 
anachronistically offered by Moses to the Jewish nation [Josephus, Ant. 5.15, 43, 44, 135] seems, as in 
the ironies before, to be more than a mere a discussion of effective politics.  Instead, it appears to 
critique the current governance of Domitian, which provided an Anti-Jewish environment that directly 
impacts the welfare of the Jewish people.  Indeed, Josephuss critique of Domitian becomes quite 
potent when he describes all of the Roman Emperors as tyrants in Ant. 19.187; 19.230.  For critique 
of Domitian in J.W. 7.85-88 through excessive flattery, see Mason, Audience, 100. 
Chapter 5 
of Anti-Jewish sentiment perpetuated by Domitianwhile ostensibly discussing 
events from the past.211  Thus, the Anti-Jewish Writings for Domitian and Jewish 
Writings under Domitian both reflect the same intensified Anti-Jewish atmosphere in 
Domitians reign. 
Policy Shifts Under Nerva 
 On 18 September, 96 C.E., Domitian was assassinated, and Nerva ascended 
to the throne.212  Immediately, Nerva began to reverse the more abusive actions and 
policies instituted by Domitian that, according to Dio Cassius, included: accusations 
of maiestas (68.1.2), reliance on informants for accusations (68.1.2-3), the illegal 
confiscation of property (68.2.1), and poor financial management (68.2.2-3).   
More significantly, Nerva specifically targeted the abuse of the Jewish people 
under the reign of Domitian.  In light of the accusations against Clemens and 
Domitilla described above,213 Nervas actions described in Dio Cass. 68.1.2 would 
have significant implications for the Jewish people: Nerva also released all who 
were on trial for maiestas and restored the exiles; moreover, he put to death all the 
slaves and the freedmen who had conspired against their masters and allowed that 
class of persons to lodge no complaint whatever against their masters; and no persons 
were permitted to accuse anybody of maiestas or of adopting the Jewish mode of 
life.214  This description, in the context of many other abuses, indicates that under

the reign of Domitian the Anti-Jewish element played a significant role, which Nerva 
would not replicate. 
Furthermore, Nerva issued a unique coin (shown below)215 between 
November 96 C.E. and the summer of 97 C.E.216 
The obverse pictures Nerva crowned with laurel, similar to Vespasians coin above.  
On the reverse, the Jewish date palm symbol, which stood in between the Jewish 
subjects on Vespasians coin, dominates the center of the coin.  Significantly, the 
caption around the coins reverse reads: FISCI IUDAICI CALUMNIA SUBLATA, 
which translates as the malicious accusation of the treasury for the Jewish tax has 
been removed.217  Martin Goodman notes the significance of this caption:  
The term sublata is otherwise unattested on Roman coins, and, although it 
was not uncommon to advertise remission of taxes, an abusive term 
(calumnia) in reference either to the treasury responsible for taxes, or to those 
who brought accusations to the treasury, or to the whole notion of the tax, is 
extraordinary, and perhaps only possible when a new emperor wished to

make an exceptionally strong statement of disassociation from the previous 
regime.218 
The Anti-Jewish atmosphere under Domitian escalated to such an extent that 
Nervas initial policy changes, celebrated in the propaganda of imperial coinage, 
highlighted the shift in the treatment of the Jewish people.  Such evidence 
corroborates the conclusion that, although there was an Anti-Jewish precedent in the 
Flavian dynasty, the Anti-Jewish environment was intensified during the reign of 
Domitian. 
The Lack of Distinction between Jews and Christians in Domitians Reign 
So how does an intensified Anti-Jewish environment impact the inquiry into 
Christian persecution (physical and non-physical) under the reign of Domitian?  This 
inquiry is addressed through the answer to another question: Did the Romans see a 
clear distinction between the Jews and the Christians?219  If so, then the Anti-Jewish 
sentiment of the Flavian dynasty would have little effect on the Christian community.  
If not, then the intensified Anti-Jewish environment under Domitian drastically 
increases the possibility of physical and non-physical persecution of Christians. 
Traditionally, historians have assumed that following the events of 70 C.E. 
the Jewish and Christian communities emerged on the imperial scene as completely 
218 Goodman, Gentile Attitudes, 176.  See also Keresztes, Jews, 6.  Thompson, 
Sociological, 161, aware of the significance of this point, avoids the apparent conclusion about 
Nervas reign by, irresponsibly, stating: Nerva, who followed Domitian, may have been more lenient 
towards the Jews; the reverse side of a coin from his reign reads: fisci Iudaici calumnia sublata But 
the exact social context for this legend is not know; it may not be related at all to a change of policy 
between Domitian and Nerva. 
219 This question should be distinguished from similar queries like: Is Christianity distinct 
from Judaism at the end of the first century? or Did Christians view themselves as completely 
separate from Jews?  While related, neither of these questions address the query of this chapter: 
How were these subject groups viewed by the Roman sovereign elites? 
Chapter 5 
separate and unique groups.220  As Samuel A. B. Mercer states at the beginning of 
the twentieth century, It is as nearly certain as very many historical facts of distant 
time can be, that since Neros day intelligent Romans had been able to distinguish 
Christians as a sect, Jewish indeed in origin, but separated from Judaism.221  Or 
more recently, Savas Agourides remarks: 
after the destruction of Jerusalem, this kind of control was over and the 
severance of Christianity from Judaism was complete, so that the Christians 
appeared to the Roman government as an independent body, in which 
perhaps there was a greater inherent political threat than in the stubborn 
Jewish fanaticism.222 
This conclusion, however, is challenged by four observations: [1] the re-
categorization of the Jewish people after 70 C.E.; [2] the Christian practice of Jewish 
customs; [3] Christian identity rooted in Jewish scriptures; and [4] Roman 
unfamiliarity with Christians in the second century C.E. 
The Re-Categorization of the Jewish People 
 The events and actions surrounding 70 C.E. display an intentional effort by 
the Flavian dynasty to completely assimilate the Jewish people into the Roman 
Empire.223  As discussed above,224 the destruction of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem 
and the implementation of the fiscus Iudaicus carried significant symbolic and

Mediterranean City, in The Ways that Never Parted: Jews and Christians in Late Antiquity and the 
Early Middle Ages (eds. Adam H. Becker and Annette Yoshiko Reed (Tbingen: Mohr, 2007), 16 also 
suggests the options of: 28-30 C.E.; ca. 50 C.E.; and even 135 C.E.  Fredriksens ultimate conclusion 
is posed in the question in her closing line, What Parting of the Ways? (p. 63).  For more discussion,

Chapter 5 
practical implications: Yahweh had been subjugated to Jupiter, and therefore, the 
Jews should switch their complete allegiance to Rome.225 
 Joseph Rives argues persuasively that the complete destruction of the temple 
and the city of Jerusalem by the Flavians,226 and actions thereafter,227 indicates their 
intentions to not merely quell future revolts but, more significantly, to eliminate the 
anomalous cult organization that made the Jews throughout the Roman world into a 
people with an alternative focus of loyalty and national identity.228  Rives argues 
that the key point of contention was the Jews were not just a geographically located 
cult like Artemis of the Ephesians.  Instead, Judaism was vigorously practiced by 
Jews all over the empire, as is evidenced in their participation in the Jewish 
festivals as well as the Jewish temple tax.229  Rives articulates the threat of such a 
cultic structure:  
From Vespasians point of view, this anomalous organization would have 
made the Jews to some extent a shadow civitas, a people who identified 
themselves primarily not with the city in which they lived nor even with 
Rome, but with Jerusalem and its cult.  Jerusalem would thus have appeared 
as a kind of rival to Rome, the only other city whose citizens, so to speak, 
were scattered through the empire.230 
This cultic structure, then, offered a national allegiance for the Jewish people that 
significantly hindered their assimilation into the Roman Empire.

228 Rives, Flavian, 164. 
229 Rives, Flavian, 162. 
230 Rives, Flavian, 163.  As further evidence, Rives cites Agrippa Is letter to Gaius in 
Philo, Leg. 281, [Jerusalem] is the capital not of the single country of Judaea but also of most other 
countries, because of the colonies which it has sent out. 
Chapter 5 
Consequently, the Flavian dynasty took distinct measures to eradicate this 
cultic center so that in the eyes of ordinary pagans, such actions were most naturally 
interpreted as the end of worship of the Jewish God.231  In particular, following the 
destruction of the temple in Jerusalem, Vespasian mandated the destruction of the 
Jewish temple in Leontopolis as well.232  As Shirley Case notes, To be sure, they 
destroyed the temple in Leontopolis, in order that no focal point for the cultivation of 
national sentiment might remain.233  In other words, the destruction of the temple in 
Jerusalem was meant to remove all obstacles for Jews to assimilate into the Roman 
Empire, and the existence of another temple offered a relocation of the cultic center, 
thereby perpetuating the Jewish national identity. 
Furthermore, the implementation of the fiscus Iudaicus offers a similar 
trajectory.  With the redirection of the Jewish tax from the temple of Yahweh in 
Jerusalem to the temple of Jupiter in Rome, the Flavians intended to integrate the 
Jewish nation into the Roman Empire by directly connecting their allegiance to 
Jupiter in their annual payments.  The tax functioned as a guide for the Jewish people 
along the path to their new identity found in the chief god of the Romans.234 
These actions, and others like them, imply that, from the Flavian perspective, 
the Jewish national identity had been eliminated.  This result demanded a re-

Flavian Rome (eds. Jonathan Edmondson, Steve Mason, and James Rives; New York: Oxford 
University Press, 2005): 63-78 argues further that Herod Agrippa II, despite his significant role in the 
victory in 70 C.E., is not appointed the client king of Judea because in the eyes of the Flavians 
Judea (i.e., the old kingdom of the Jews) no longer existed. 
Chapter 5 
categorization of the Jewish people as a whole.235  From the moment that the 
Temple was destroyed, Jonathan Edmondson notes, Jerusalem and, more broadly, 
Judaea lost their defining centrality to Judaism.  Henceforth, Judaism would become 
by definition a diasporic cult, as was that other cult that derived from it, 
Christianity.236  This re-categorization of the Jewish people contributed to a lack of 
clear distinction between the Jews and the Christians from the perspective of the 
Romans.237   
The Christian Practice of Jewish Customs 
 As late as Tertullian in the early third century, Christians were still accused of 
hiding under the shadow of the Jewish religion238  Such accusations grew out of 
the various similarities between Christians and Jews in their customs and choices of 
daily living.  For example, the Christians, like the Jews, practiced monotheism,239 
even worshiping the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Moses.240  The Christians, like the 
Jews, rejected idolatry.241  The Christians, like the Jews, celebrated religious 
festivals.242  Indeed, as early as Ignatius (early 2nd century C.E.)243 and as late as 
235 So Theodor Mommsen, Der Religionsfrevel nach rmischem Recht (Leipzig: R. 
Oldenbourg, 1890), 424f. 
236 Edmondson, Introduction, 24.  
237 As Edmondson, Introduction, 20, notes, With the destruction of the Temple of 
JerusalemJews and Christians now became widely scattered, diasporic communities, defined by 
religion rather than by place of residence.

Chapter 5 
Origen (3rd century C.E.),244 Christian leaders were concerned with the common lay 
practice of Jewish customs. 
 In particular, the Jewish practices of the Sabbath, circumcision, and dietary 
restrictions were widely acknowledged as key demarcations of the Jewish people.245  
Yet, Christians also practiced these customs throughout the first few centuries.246  
From the Roman perspective, such overlap would significantly distort Christian and 
Jewish distinctions. 
Similarly, consistent Christian attendance at Jewish synagogues further 
blurred the lines.247  In fact, Margaret H. Williams points out that even the 
organizational structure of the Christian churches reflected the Jewish synagogues, 
with the churches apparently still called a synagogue in the second century.248  J.

Regarding Melito of Sardiss Peri Pascha, Rajak, Jewish, 448-449 remarks, the contemporary 
information to be gleaned from the poem is essentially no more than that the synagogue still held a 
powerful attraction for the Christians of his day, causing considerable anxiety to the local leaders of 
the church.  For the significance of synagogues for diasporic Jews, see Rajak, Jewish Community, 
10-12. 
248 Williams, Domitian, 201.  Cf. Jas 2:2.  Although the exact identity of Jamess audience 
is debated (i.e., Christians in general, Jewish Christians, Jewish communities, etc.), the significant 
point for the study at hand is that a Christian leader (Jas 1:1; Acts 15:13-21) uses Jewish grammar in a 
document canonized by the Christian community. 
Chapter 5 
Nelson Kraybill adds that, at times, prominent leaders in the Christian community 
like Paul (Acts 7:54-8:3; 9:1-2) and Crispus (Acts 18:8; cf. 1 Cor 1:14) once played 
influential roles in the Jewish community.249  From Romes perspective, then, the 
difference between Jews and Christians was increasingly convoluted.  In addition to 
the lack of a Jewish cultic center, Christians practiced distinctly Jewish customs.250  
Christian Identity Rooted in Jewish Scriptures 
 From its inception, the Christian community claimed Jewish scriptures as its 
own.251  These Hebrew texts were the battle grounds for issues regarding Jesus 
identity as well as their own.  As Judith M. Lieu states, in sharp opposition to 
their pagan contemporaries, [Christians and Jews] shared, often, as we have 
suggested for Justin [Martyr], literally, the same text and the same exegetical 
principles, yet this became their most flexible weapon in denying each others 
world.252  Indeed, based on Old Testament texts, the Christian community 
envisioned itself as the True People of God continuing the task of Yahweh in 
Christ.253   
In Justin Martyrs Dialogue with Trypho (mid-2nd century C.E.), the identity 
of the Christian community is a central point of contention.  In blatant conflict with 
Jewish claims, Justin responds, For the true spiritual Israel, and descendants of 
Judah, Jacob, Isaac, and Abrahamare we who have been led to God through this 
249 Kraybill, Imperial, 169.

253 Rev 1:5 and 1 Pet 2:9-10 apply titles that fulfill Old Testament promises to the nation of 
Israel (Exod 19:3-6) to the Christian community.  Cf. Phil 3:13; Jas 1:1; Gal 6:16; Rev 7:1-8. 
Chapter 5 
crucified Christ254  This redefinition of the title Israel, now applied to 
Christians, parallels Revelation 2:9 and 3:9.  Both texts utilize the same phrase to 
encourage the Christian communities: the ones claiming to be Jews themselves yet 
they are not.  Commenting on these two texts in Revelation, Adela Yarbro Collins 
aptly concludes: the remarks imply that John was not content to find a new name 
to express his own self-understanding and that of his community of faith, but that he 
claimed the name .255  Thus, at the exact same time, both groups attempt to 
occupy the same ideological space: the true followers of Yahweh. 
From the perspective of the Jewish and Christian communities, their 
concurrent claims to be the true followers of Yahweh were from the same text and 
yet quite distinct.  From the sovereign perspective, however, the nuances are 
concealed, as Gallio determined, in questions about words and names and your law 
(Acts 18:15).  This textual and linguistic overlap, then, naturally contributed to a 
situation in which the Roman Empire conflated the two groups into one. 
Roman Unfamiliarity with Christians in the Second Century C.E. 
 The number of Roman writers leading up to and contemporary with Trajans 
reign (98-117 C.E.) who do not mention Christians in their text is notable.256  What is 
more striking is the significant lack of familiarity by those authors who do mention 
254 Justin, Dial. 11 (Donaldson).  Cf. Gal 3:7, 27-29; Romans 2:18-19; 9:6-7a; Origen, Cels. 
2.8.  See also Daniel Boyarin, Border Lines: The Partition of Judaeo-Christianity (Philadelphia: 
University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004), 73; Lieu, History, 83. 
255 Collins, Persecution, 739-740.  See also Collins, Crisis, 75, 85-86; Slater, Social, 251; 
Thompson, Revelation, 138; Rajak, Jewish Community, 21.  For the evolution of this linguistic 
category in the late 2nd-early 3rd century C.E., see Steve Mason, Josephus, Judea, and Christian 
Origins: Methods and Categories (Peabody: Hendrickson, 2009), 141-165 (esp. 155-156). 
256 Authors that do not mention Christians: Lucan (ca. 65), Quintilian (ca. 100), Silius 
Italicus (ca. 103), Martial (ca. 104), Juvenal (late first to early second century C.E.), Florus (ca. end of 
Trajans reign to Hadrian), and Plutarch (ca. 120).  Nevertheless, at least Quintilian, Martial, Juvenal, 
and Plutarch show knowledge of the Jews in their writings. 
Chapter 5 
Christians in the second century C.E.257  Pliny the Youngers Ep. 10.96 offers a 
telling example. 
 Born in 61 C.E., Pliny the Younger spent the majority of his adolescence 
under the Flavian dynasty.  In the reign of Domitian, Pliny saw his political career 
accelerate to new heights, from his election to Quaestor in 89 C.E. to Tribune of the 
People in 91 C.E.,258 positions which offered, at times, close company to the emperor 
himself.  In 110-112 C.E., Pliny is appointed governor of Bithynia and empowered 
by Trajan to address some troubling issues in the region.  Given his political 
background, Plinys perspective on Christians is highly valued in that his knowledge 
of the Jewish sect would reflect the understanding by the Roman elite at the time of 
Domitian as well as the time of Trajan. 
 In the opening lines, Pliny states that the occasion of his letter is due to his 
own ignorance and need for clarification from Trajan.  Pliny writes, Having never 
been present at any trials concerning those who profess Christianity, I am 
unacquainted not only with the nature of their crimes, or the measure of their 
punishment, but how far it is proper to enter into an examination concerning 
them.259  In what follows, Pliny requests help concerning two key problems: [1] 
257 Both Suetonius and Tacitus, writing in the second century, mention Christians as well as 
Jews.  Suet., Claud. 25.4 seems to misspell Christos when he writes, Since the Jews constantly 
made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he expelled them from Rome (Rolfe, LCL).  As 
Williams, Domitian, 199, suggests, [Suetonius] is surely just writing with his invariable common 
sense and customary knowledgeability about things Jewish.  Writing in the second century as well, 
Tac., Ann. 15.44, on the other hand, offers a more accurate depiction of Jesus, although referring to 
him as Christus as if it is his proper name.  Yet, he still seems to depict the Christians in the same 
language used in Tac., Hist. 5.5 in his description of the Jewish people. 
258 For a summary of Plinys career under Domitian, see Henry F. Pelham, The Younger 
Pliny, The FNRev 27.158 (1880): 227-248. 
259 Pliny, Ep. 10.96 (emphasis added).  All Pliny the Younger quotes that follow are from 
Letters by Pliny the Younger (trans. William Melmoth; 9 vols.; The Harvard Classics; New York: 
Collier & Son, 1909-1914) unless otherwise noted. 
Chapter 5 
how to properly implement trials for Christians and [2] which Christian beliefs merit 
punishment. 
 Pliny details the trials he conducted concerning those who have been 
brought before [him] as Christians.  At the time of interrogation, those who 
confessed to being a Christian were threatened with physical punishment and offered 
the opportunity to repent up to three times, at which point, if they refused, Pliny 
executed them.  Once again, Pliny indicates his lack of awareness regarding the 
Christian beliefs: For I had no doubt that, whatever the nature of their creed might 
be, a contumacious and inflexible obstinacy certainly deserved to be punished.260  
During the trials, those who denounced being a Christian were forced to prove their 
allegiance to Rome through three actions, after which they were set free: [1] invoke 
the gods; [2] offer prayer, incense, and wine to an imperial cult statue of Trajan; and 
[3] curse Christ.  The explanation for these three elements indicates, once again, 
Plinys lack of familiarity with Christians: none of which those who are really 
Christians, it is said, can be forced to do.261 
 Subsequently, Pliny begins to describe some of the Christian beliefs and 
practices disclosed during his forceful interrogation:   
They affirmed the whole of their guilt, or their error, was, that they met on a 
stated day before it was light, and addressed a form of prayer to Christ, as to a 
divinity, binding themselves by a solemn oath, not for the purposes of any 
wicked design, but never to commit any fraud, theft, or adultery, never to 
falsify their word, nor deny a trust when they should be called upon to deliver 
it up; after which it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble, to eat 
in common a harmless meal.  From this custom, however, they desisted after 
260 Emphasis added. 
261 Emphasis added.  In response to the question, Where did Pliny learn such a procedure?, 
Charlesworth, Observations, 32 and Keresztes, Jews, 22 conclude that it was from his political 
experience under Domitian (about twenty years earlier). 
Chapter 5 
the publication of my edict, by which, according to your commands, I forbade 
the meeting of any assemblies. 
Instead of clarity, the Christian confessions only provided greater confusion for 
Pliny, After receiving this account, I judged it so much the more necessary to 
endeavour to extort the real truth, by putting two female slaves to the torture, who 
were said to officiate in their religious rites: but all I could discover was evidence of 
an absurd and extravagant superstition.  Regardless of his tactics, Pliny is unable to 
clarify the Christian beliefs, although he is convinced they deserve some sort of 
punishment. 
 Curiously, when Trajans response is examined, only one of Plinys inquiries 
is addressedthe proper procedure for Christian trials: 
You observed proper procedure, my dearest Secundus, in investigating the 
charges against the Christians who were brought before you.  It is not 
possible to lay down any general rule for all such cases.  Do not go out of 
your way to look for them.  If indeed they should be brought before you, and 
the crime is proved, they must be punished; with the restriction, however, that 
where the party denies he is a Christian, and shall make it evident that he is 
not, by invoking our gods, let him (notwithstanding any former suspicion) be 
pardoned upon his repentance.  Anonymous informations ought not to be 
received in any sort of prosecution.  It is introducing a very dangerous 
precedent, and is quite foreign to the spirit of our age.262 
Through all of the praise and instruction, Trajan never addresses one of the central, if 
not primary, issues in Plinys original letter: the lack of knowledge and clarity about 
the Christian beliefs which mandate punishment.   
Indeed, it is this unfamiliarity that also characterizes the Roman perception of 
Christians throughout the middle of the second century C.E.  For example, in 
Hadrians letter to Servianus (ca. 130), Christians are emphatically described as 
262 Pliny, Ep. 10.97Trajans response to Pliny [emphasis added]. 
Chapter 5 
worshipers of Serapis,263 while Epictetus (ca. 130), as recorded by Arrian, seems to 
confuse Jews and Christians by referring to one who has been baptized as a 
Jew.264  The inaccuracy of these mid-second century Romans suggests a distinct 
ignorance in familiarity with Christians as late as the reign of Hadrian. 
In sum, these four observations suggest that Christians were not seen as a 
distinctly separate group from the Jews in the time of Domitian.265  The Roman elite 
were unfamiliar and unconcerned with the ideological nuances that distinguished 
these two groups in their respective perceptions.  Therefore, the intensification of the 
Anti-Jewish environment under Domitians reign not only offers a highly contentious 
period for the Jewish people but for Christians as well.266  This depiction is 
congruent with the setting reflected in the text of Revelation: a time period of non-
physical persecution that, at times, escalated into physical persecution.267 
Conclusion 
 The book of Revelation does not suggest a socio-historical context in which 
the Roman Empire is presently implementing mass killings of Christians.  The 
Apocalypse remembers in the indefinite past and anticipates in the indefinite future 
physical persecutions that lead to death.  Yet, Revelation reflects a present setting of

267 N.B.: This chapter has not relied on the, sometimes exaggerated, claims of Christian 
writers from the end of the first century to the fourth century C.E. to come to this conclusion.  Only at 
this point, then, is it appropriate to mention that the conclusion stated above is substantiated by the 
following documents: 1 Clem. 1.1; 5.1-2; 7.1-4; Eusebius, Hist. eccl. 3.17-20, 39; 4.18, 24; 5.8, 18;

Aitken, Reading, 82; Parker, Domitian, 43; and Luke-Acts see Donald W. Riddle, First Clement,

Chapter 5 
escalated tension for Christians due to non-physical persecution that has, at times, 
resulted in physical persecutions of various typesjust not mass killings.   
The socio-historical context of Domitians reign matches this description.  
The Flavian dynastys Anti-Jewish foundational myth was intensified under 
Domitian.  Since the Roman elite at the end of the first century did not perceive 
Christians as a distinctly separate group from the Jews, an Anti-Jewish 
intensification would impact Christian communities as well, offering the exact 
setting that Revelation demands.   
Thus, in contradistinction to the early-date advocates, the socio-historical 
setting of Domitians reign confirms the late-date of Revelation (92-96 C.E.)268 and 
in no way militates against it.  This conclusion offers both a date of composition and 
a context in which points of conversation can now be observed within the 
Apocalypse.  Indeed, if Revelation does interact with the empire, it would be natural 
for key imagery of the Flavian foundational myth to emerge in the subject text.  
Therefore, through this Alter-Imperial lens, Revelation 20:7-10 is examined for 
points of conversation to offer a new perspective on a notoriously difficult text.

Section 3: 
The Alter-Imperial Paradigm  
and the Book of Revelation  
Chapter 6 
Chapter 6: 
An Alter-Imperial Interpretation of Revelation 20:7-10 
 Why must Satan be released?  This question has plagued scholars for 
centuries, and it surely was on the hearts and minds of the original recipients of the 
Apocalypse as well.  The tension felt in Revelation 20:7-10 arises from Revelation 
20:1-3.  In this text, an angel from heaven binds the dragon, the ancient serpent, 
who is the devil and Satan (20:1-2) and imprisons him in the Abyss for a thousand 
years (20:3a).  The jubilation from those who heard this message (1:3) still resonates 
two-thousand years later.  And yet, the celebration is short-lived.  The text continues 
in 20:3b with, After these things, he must be let out for a short time.  It is at this 
point that the question emerges: Why must Satan be released? 
 In Revelation 20:4-6, the readers attention is diverted by a vision of souls of 
the faithful witnesses reigning with Jesus in heaven1 and a beatitude for those who 
overcome.2  This brief reprieve, however, dissolves in Revelation 20:7: And when 
the thousand years are completed, Satan will be let out from his prison.  The 
dramatic tension created by the anticipation of the events that follow once again 
prompts the question: Why must Satan be released? 
1 The word throne () in Revelation is used 47 times (out of 62 in the NT)44 times 
connected to agents of God and 3 times applied to agents of evil.  Each time throne is connected to 
evil, it is on earth (2:13; 13:2; 16:10).  Conversely, each of the 43 times (excluding Rev 20:4-6) 
throne is connected to agents of God, it is in heaven.  The only exception to this pattern would be 
Revelation 20:4-6.  In fact, throne is used 2 times in the immediate context of Rev 20:4-6 (20:11, 
12), both of which are in heaven.  Moreover, the imagery of the throne comes from Dan 7:9-10, 22, 
which is located in heaven.  Since there are no clear indicators that mandate the reign of Christ and his 
saints on earth in 20:4-6, it logically follows that the reign takes place in heaven.   
2 There are seven beatitudes in Revelation (1:3; 14:3; 16:15; 19:9; 20:6; 22:7; 22:14).

Inadequate Options: Three Recent Interpretive Approaches 
 Over the past 125 years, Revelation scholarship has primarily utilized three 
interpretive approaches to explain the images of the Apocalypse: intertextual 
explorations, historical inquiries, and sociological investigations.3  Regarding 
Revelation 20:7-10, each approach, however, proves inadequate for different reasons.   
First, intertextual explorations provide little interpretative help.  Given that 
the book of Revelation contains over 500 allusions to the Old Testament in 404 
verses, it would be safe to assume that the Old Testament offers a cogent explanation 
for the images of Revelation 20:7-10.4  Nevertheless, the Old Testament only 
establishes some aesthetic symbolic referents, such as: four corners of the earth,5 
the sand of the sea,6 fire from heaven,7 and Gog and Magog.8  While this helps 
3 As stated in the introduction (p. 3), these three categories are not mutually exclusive.  Often 
interpreters will use all three approaches to develop their interpretations.  Nevertheless, in order to 
analyze the typical attempts to solve the problem of the release of Satan, these three categories 
helpfully organize the interaction with the imagery in Rev 20:1-10.

govern some of the images,9 the primary image of the passage (the release of Satan) 
has no Old Testament referent whatsoever.10 
Second, historical inquiries and sociological investigations are simply 
disregarded by scholarship in Revelation 20:7-10.  Presumably due to the assumption 
that the release of Satan has no analogous equivalent in Roman culture, even the 
historically focused works of Colin J. Hemer, William M. Ramsay, Wes Howard-
Brook/Anthony Gwyther, and the sociologically oriented Leonard Thompson 
disregard historical trajectories for Revelation 20:7-10.11  In fact, the text is simply 
ignored by these works.12 
 As a result, study of Revelation 20:7-10 is dominated, for better or worse, by 
a fourth interpretative approach: theological systems.  Although coming to distinctly 
different conclusions, premillennial and amillennial interpreters attempt to explain

literarkritische Studie zu Offb 19,11-21,8 (BZNW 148; Berlin: Gruyter, 2007), 174 mildly observes, 
Biblische Zitate sind in 20,1-10 weit seltener als in 19,21. 
10 In addition, there are no Old Testament connections to the binding and imprisonment 
of Satan.  However, in 1 En. 10:4-14 Azazel is bound and thrown into darkness (see also 1 
Enoch 88:1), paralleling Rev 20:1-10 (so David E. Aune, Revelation (3 vols.; WBC 52A-52C; 
Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 1997-1998), 1078-1079; Bauer, Messiasreich, 186-187; Lohmeyer, 
Offenbarung, 161; Lohse, Offenbarung, 105; J. Massyngberde Ford, Revelation (AB 38; Garden City: 
Doubleday, 1975), 330.  Yet, significantly, there is never any release; the actions to Azazel are 
eternal (Cf. 4 Ezra 13:9b-13; Cf. 14:4b-6; T. Levi 17.8-11).  As Bauer, Messiasreich, 187 concludes, 
Fr eine zeitlich begrenzte Fesselung eines Widersachers Gottes mit erneuter Loslassung in der Art 
von Offb 20,1-3.7-10 dagegen finden sich in der jdischen Apokalyptik keine Parallelen.

12 Rev 20:7-10 is mentioned in Hemer, Letters, 131, but it is not applied to a historical 
parallel.  Instead, he connects Gog in 20:8 with Ezekiel [see also Hemer, Letters, 259 (n. 39); 260 (n. 
52)].

the release of Satan by forcing the image into their theological schemas.13  
Premillennials encounter substantial difficulties with the events in Revelation 20:7-
10, when presented with the question: From where does Satans army come?14  
Specifically, upon Satans release, he goes out and deceives the nations from the 
four corners of the earth and gathers them for battle (20:7) against the people of 
God (20:9).  This evil army is as numerous as the sand of the sea (20:8), but from 
where did such a large number of evil come?  
At the end of Revelation 19:11-21, the divine warrior casts the beast and false 
prophet into the lake of fire, which is followed by the complete destruction of 
rebellious humanity with the divine warriors sword:      
  (19:21).15  This complete annihilation of evil in Revelation 19:20-21 
directly precedes the binding and imprisonment of Satan (20:1-3) and the reign of 
Christ and his followers (20:4-6) for a thousand years.  According to 
Premillennialism, in this thousand years, the world (20:1-6) enjoys utopian bliss, 
where the lion rests with the calf and the child plays with the vipers (Isa 11:6-9; 
65:17-25): complete peace and unity over all creation.16  Nevertheless, the idyllic 
13 Postmillennial and Preterist perspectives are not included in the following analysis due to 
the general lack of attention to (or complete negligence of) the release of Satan by both positions. 
14 Premillennials believe the second coming of Christ (Rev 19:11-21) inaugurates a utopian 
reign on earth (Rev 20:1-6).  In this context, Premillennials (or Premillennialism) refers to both 
Dispensational and Historic Premillennials.  Although Historic Premillennials will take issue with this 
conflation, the difficulties met by an earthly millennial kingdom are shared by both theological 
systems. 
15 Although a premillennial advocate, David J. MacLeod, The Second Last Thing: The 
Millennial Kingdom of Christ (Rev. 20:4-6), BSac 157 (2000): 329 writes, The text implies that all 
the armies that followed the beast will be destroyed.   
16 So Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, Kingdom Come: The Final Victory (Carol Stream, Ill.: 
Tyndale, 2007), 31-32; cf. Holtzmann, Offenbarung, 355.  The Isaiah texts, however, do not parallel 
Revelation 20:4-6, but instead, Revelation 21-22 in the description of the new heaven and the new 
earth (i.e., Isa 65:16-18 and Rev 21:1; Isa 65:17, 19-20 and Rev 21:4; Isa 65:16-17 and Rev 21:5; Isa 
65:17 and Rev 21:22; Isa 11:6-12 and Rev 21:24-26; Isa 65:22-23 and Rev 22:3; Isa 65:16-17 and Rev 
22:6).  
Chapter 6 
scene is shattered in Revelation 20:7-10 when Satan is released, deceives the nations, 
and gathers evil humanity, once again, for battle.  But if the rebellious nations are 
completely destroyed in Revelation 19:21, then who does Satan deceive upon his 
release in Revelation 20:7-8?17 
 Premillennials answer this question by suggesting that there will be some in 
the utopian millennium who rebel even though Satan is bound.18  However, this 
answer leads to further difficulties for the theological system that results in odd 
assertions, such as: the necessity of multiple bodily resurrections separated by the 
thousand years,19 the rebellious some as non-resurrected persons born in the 
millennium,20 and the army Satan gathers after his release as only those who are born 
after the year nine-hundred in the millenniumsince non-resurrected bodies cannot 
live longer than one-hundred years even in the utopian world.21  Such theological 
alchemy can only be described as forced conjecture. 
 Furthermore, amillennial interpretations likewise prove inadequate.22  
Generally speaking, amillennials suggest the release of Satan points to a time of 
17 R. Fowler White, Reexamining the Evidence for Recapitulation in Rev 20:1-10, WTJ 
51.2 (1989): 321.  I. Howard Marshall, The Christian Millennium, EvQ 72.3 (2000): 229 (n. 26) 
states, Rev. 20:3 seems otiose if there is nobody left for Satan to deceive  Cf. Merrill Tenney, The 
Importance of Exegesis of Revelation 20:1-8, BSac 111 (1954): 144 who simply ignores the 
destruction of all the nations in Revelation 19 altogether. 
18 LaHaye and Jenkins, Kingdom, 36, 53-54, 260 suggest that the utopian millennium will 
still have: brothels, drugs, alcohol, sexual sins, murder, robbery, and even pornography.  
19 So Craig Blomberg, Historic Premillennialism in the Book of Revelation, in Dragons, 
John, and Every Grain of Sand: Essays on the Book of Revelation (ed. Shane J. Wood; Joplin, Mo.: 
College, 2011), 153-156; Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, Glorious Appearing: The End of Days 
(Wheaton, Ill.: Tyndale, 2004), 325; LaHaye and Jenkins, Kingdom, 25, 43-44, 61.

21 LaHaye and Jenkins, Glorious, 356.  For death in the millennium see: LaHaye and Jenkins, 
Glorious, 356; LaHaye and Jenkins, Kingdom, 32, 46-48. 
22 Amillennials believe the thousand-year reign (Rev 20:1-6) describes the time period 
between Christs first and second comings. 
Chapter 6 
increased and widespread persecution of Gods people right before Christs final 
coming and the judgment of the world (Rev 20:11-15).23  This interpretation suffers, 
though, with the opening phrase of 20:7a, And when the thousand years are 
completed (     ).  If, as the amillennials suggest, the 
thousand years is defined as the Church Age, then the second coming occurs in 
20:7a, which would put the release of Satan (20:7b) and the supposed persecution 
(20:8-9) after the advent.  Therefore, any interpretation that suggests a significant 
persecution by Satan right before the second coming of Christ (based on this 
passage) must omit the opening phrase of 20:7a, which places the events of Satans 
release after the thousand years. 
 Theological systems, then, struggle to develop a coherent explanation of 
Revelation 20:1-10.  As Christopher Rowland observes, The problem with the 
eschatology of Revelation is that we have few parallels from Jewish literature of, 
what one might term, a two-stage expectation for the future kingdom of God.24  
Without interpretive parallels, conjecture and speculation reign.

Revelation 20:7-10 and Revelations Structure 
From intertextual explorations to historical inquiries to sociological 
investigations to theological systems, the interpretative approaches to Revelation 
20:7-10 have provided little clarity, causing many to preclude this text from 
significant scholarly discussion.  However, the Apocalypses placement of this 
imagery in the overall narrative demands that this text not be easily set aside due to 
its enigmatic nature; it is the penultimate moment before Revelations zenith (21:1-
8).  It is a climactic image, not superfluous drivel. 
 A scholarly consensus of Revelations literary structure is quite elusive.  
Some divide the book broadly into three divisions,25 while others posit various 
creative solutions: six divisions of seven,26 seven divisions of seven,27 six sets of 
six,28 and elaborate chiasmi29all filled with theories of interludes,30 redaction,31 
25 Rowland, Heaven, 11-12 separates the book into: [1] Rev 1-3; [2] Rev 4-22:5; and [3] Rev 
22:6-21.  With more sophistication, Martin Karrer, Die Johannesoffenbarung als Brief: Studien zu 
ihrem literarischen, historischen und theologischen Ort (Gttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1986), 
226-228 also divides Revelation into Rowlands three parts, but divides Rev 4-22:5 into three further 
sections due to detectable thematic shifts.  The body, however, is not disconnected from Rev 1-3, for 
as Karrer, Johannesoffenbarung, 223 states, Obwohl also im Corpus der Apk deren Adressaten 
(gemeinden) nicht mehr namentlich erwhrnt werden, bleiben sie als ins Auge gefate und 
angesprochene Leser und Hrer prsent. 
26 Austin Farrer, A Rebirth of Images: The Making of St. Johns Apocalypse (Boston: Beacon, 
1963; repr., Eugene, Ore.: Wipf & Stock, 2007), 45-49 structures the book: [1] Seven MessagesRev 
1-3 (125 lines in the Greek Bible); [2] Seven SealsRev 4-7 (133 lines); [3] Seven Trumpets8-
11:14 (122 lines); [4] Seven Non-Labeled Visions11:15-14:20 (144 lines); [5] Seven Vials15-18 
(159 lines); and [6] Seven Non-Labeled Visions19-22 (148 lines).  For further discussion (both 
critique and affirmation), see Adela Yarbro Collins, The Combat Myth in the Book of Revelation 
(HDR 9; Missoula: Scholars, 1976; repr., Eugene, Oreg.: Wipf & Stock, 2001), 13-19. 
27 Beale, Revelation, 114 favors a sevenfold division ([1] Rev 1-3; [2] Rev 4-7; [3] Rev 8:1-
11:14; [4] Rev 11:15-14:20; [5] Rev 15-16; [6] Rev 17:1-21:8; [7] Rev 21:9-22:21), although he also 
finds an eightfold division (separating 17:1-21:8 into 17:1-19:10 and 19:11-21:8) plausible.  See also 
Elisabeth Schssler Fiorenza, The Book of Revelation: Justice and Judgment (Philadelphia: Fortress, 
1985), 175. 
28 Through redaction criticism, J. Massyngberde Ford, Revelation (AB 38; Garden City: 
Doubleday, 1975), 46-50 offers a series of six sextets for the original Apocalypse: [1] Rev 6:1-17 
(6:1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-11, 12-17); [2] Rev 8:7-11:14 (8:7, 8-9, 10-11, 12-13; 9:1-12; 6:13-11:14); [3] 
Rev 12:1-14:20 (12:1-2, 3-6; 13:11-18; 13:11-18; 14:1-5, 6-20); [4] Rev 16:2-21 (16:2, 3, 4-7, 8-9, 
10-11, 12-16, 17-21); [5] Rev 17:1-19:10 (17:1-6, 7-18; 18:1-8, 9-20, 21-24; 19:1-10); [6] Rev 19:11-
20:15 (19:11-16, 17-18, 19-21; 20:1-3, 4-10, 11-15). 
Chapter 6 
and recapitulation.32  The diversity of conclusions illustrates the complexity of 
Revelations structure.  Indeed, J. Massyngberde Ford celebrates, The construction 
of this apocalypse is unique; in fact, it is the most exquisitely and artistically 
constructed of all the apocalypses.33 
 Nevertheless, scholars generally agree that some sort of shift occurs in and 
around Revelation 12:1, viewing it as the beginning of a new division34 or a new 
sequence35 that inaugurates the second half of the book.36  Richard Bauckham 
29 Barbara Wootten Snyder, Combat Myth in the Apocalypse: The Liturgy of the Day of the 
Lord and the Dedication of the Heavenly Temple, (PhD diss., Graduate Theological Union and 
University of California, Berkeley, 1991), 84 constructs this chiasmus: [A] Rev 1:1-20; [B] Rev 2-3; 
[C] Rev 4-5; [D] Rev 6:1-8:1; [E] Rev 8:2-9:21; [F] Rev 10; [G] Rev 11; [G] Rev 12; [F] Rev 13; 
[E] Rev 14; [D] Rev 15-16; [C] Rev 17-20; [B] Rev 21:1-22:5; [A] Rev 22:6-21.  In more broad 
terms, Fiorenza, Justice, 175 offers this chiasmus: [A] Rev 1:1-8; [B] Rev 1:9-3:22; [C] Rev 4:1-9:21; 
11:15-19; [D] Rev 10:1-15:4; [C] Rev 15:1, 5-19:10; [B] Rev 19:11-22:9; [A] Rev 22:10-22:21.  
Highlighting the sevenfold division of this chiasmus, Fiorenza, Justice, 176 adds, Even more 
significant with respect to Rev. is the fact that the golden candelabra which appears on the arch of 
Titus in Rome consists of a centerpiece paralleled on either side by three pieces and thus exhibits the 
pattern ABCDCBA. 
30 Rowland, Heaven, 417-419, 433-434 lists the following as interludes or interrruptions: 
[1] Rev 7; [2] Rev 10:1-11:14; [3] Rev 17-18.  See also Werner Georg Kmmel, Introduction to the 
New Testament (Nashville: Abingdon, 1966), 457-458 adds: Rev 12-14. 
31 Weiss, Offenbarung, 45-145 argues for a redaction tradition in an earlier and shorter 
Ancient Johannine-Apocalypse (Die alte Johannes-Apokalypsepp. 45-113) discernible from the 
later additions of the Remaining Components of the Apocalypse (Die brigen Bestandteile der 
Apokalypsepp. 113-145); cf. Holtzmann, Offenbarung, 303.  Ford, Revelation, 55-56 envisions the 
Apocalypse as a Christian redaction of John the Baptists revelation (Rev 4-11pp. 50-53) and a 
disciple of John the Baptist (Rev 12-22pp. 54-55).  After surfacing grammatical oddities in Rev 
20:1-10, Bauer, Messiasreich, 184 concludes, Diese Beobachtungen legen es nahe, dass sich der 
Abschnitt 20,1-10 aus verschiedenen Traditionsstcken zusammensetzt, die kaum miteinander 
abgeglichen sind. For discussion and critique of the redaction position, see Fiorenza, Justice, 160-
32 Collins, Combat Myth, 8-19, 43, 207-243; Beale, Revelation, 121-144; Richard Bauckham,

Lowery, Rhapsody, 121-143. 
33 Ford, Revelation, 46.  However, she inaccurately continues, So masterfully is the text 
arranged that one cannot doubt the work of an editor.  Cf. Fiorenza, Justice, 16; Bauckham, Climax, 
34 Ford, Revelation, 194-195. 
35 Collins, Combat Myth, 157. 
36 Karrer, Johannesoffenbarung, 227-230; Adela Yarbro Collins, Crisis & Catharsis: The 
Power of the Apocalypse (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1984), 112; Mounce, Revelation, 229; Perkins, 
Revelation, 53.  Although Farrer, Rebirth, 45 argues that the second half begins in 11:15 while Aune, 
Chapter 6 
observes, Most attempts to discern the structure of Revelation have found it 
particularly difficult to see how chapters 12-14 fit into the overall structure.The 
beginning of chapter 12 seems an uncharacteristically abrupt fresh start, devoid of 
literary links with anything that precedes.37  Indeed, Revelation 12-14 seems to 
interject its content into the sequence of seven seals (6:1-8:5) and seven trumpets 
(8:6-11:19) that would appear to progress seamlessly to the seven bowls (15:1-16:21) 
that follow.  In contrast to redaction theories, however, Bauckham accurately 
concludes, It seems we must accept that the abrupt transition is intentional.  John 
has made it abrupt precisely in order to create the impression of a fresh start.38 
 Significantly, Revelation 12 replaces the foreground with images and 
characters previously found in the background of Revelation 1-11.39  So, while Satan 
is found in Revelation 2:9, 13, 24; and 3:9, he appears in Revelation 12:3 as a great 
red dragon (  ) and dominates the plot that follows (12:3-6, 7-9, 
10-12, 13-17; 13:1-10, 11-18; 16:12-16; 20:1-3, 7-10; cf. 14:9-12; 17:3-17; 18:2-
19:2; 19:17-21).  Similarly, an enigmatic beast arises from the abyss in Revelation 
11:7 (      ) and kills the two witnesses.  In 
Revelation 13, the beast imagery is bifurcated and defined in the beast from the sea 
(13:1-10) and the beast from the earth (13:11-18), both of whom play significant

11, 12-17; 19:17-21; cf. 20:4-6, 10).  Thus, Revelation 12-14 introduces the key 
antagonists of the storyline: Satan, the two beasts, and Babylon.40 
 In what follows, the key antagonists pursue (12:17; cf. 17:13-14; 19:19; 
20:9a) and conquer (13:7; 18:24; 19:2) the saints through deception (12:9; 13:14; 
16:13-16; 18:23; 19:20), violence (13:7, 10, 16; 16:5-6; 17:6; 18:24; 19:2), and 
intimidation (13:3, 4, 5-6, 8, 12-13, 14-17).  The amalgamation of victorious and 
fearful images (i.e., 12:7-9 and 12:17) accentuates the tension in the storyline: 
conquest of the dragon (12:11-12a) and yet his unbridled fury (12:12b), destruction 
of the prostitute (17:1) and yet her inebriation on the blood of the saints (17:6).  The 
presence of the key antagonists immerse the narrative in conflict awaiting 
resolution.41 
 In Revelation 18:1-20:10, the tension is resolved.42  Beginning with Babylon 
in Revelation 18, the key antagonists are each destroyed in the opposite order they 
were introduced.43  Introduced second, the two beasts from Revelation 13 are 
disposed second by being thrown into the lake of fire (19:20) at the appearance of the 
rider on the white horse (19:11-16).  In dramatic fashion, the great red dragon is 
bound by an angel (20:1-2) and imprisoned (20:3) for 1,000 years, after which his 
destruction befalls (20:7-10).44   
40 Babylon is mentioned for the first time in Rev 14:8 in a proleptic proclamation of 
judgment (see Rev 16:19).  The destruction of the prostitute who bears the name Babylon the Great 
on her forehead foreshadows the destruction of Babylon vividly described in Rev 18:1-19:3.   
41 Collins, Combat Myth, 29. 
42 Fiorenza, Justice, 172-173 supports a minor chiasmus in this text: [A] the city of Babylon 
(Rev 17:1-19:10); [B] the judgments of the two beasts and Satan (Rev 19:11-21:8); [A] the city of the 
New Jerusalem (21:9-22:9). 
43 Fiorenza, Justice, 56; Lowery, Rhapsody, 135-136. 
44 Rowland, Heaven, 434-435 argues for recapitulation in these events: Although there 
seems to be a duplicate of this final battle in 20.7ff., the point of the two is completely different.  The 
Chapter 6 
Finally, tension resolves, consummation occurs, and the promises of 
Revelation 2-3 are realized.  The climactic divergence of the key antagonists 
complements the vivid convergence of the new heaven and the new earth (21:1-8).  
In the letters to the seven churches (2:1-3:22), each conclusion contains a promise to 
the one conquering ( 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21; cf. 21:7) fulfilled only in 
the new heaven and new earth (21:1ff.).  Thus, the climactic tension in Revelation 
20:7-10 precipitates Revelations pinnacle in 21:1-8.45   
As the penultimate moment in the narrative, then, Revelation 20:7-10 
demands significant investigation.  Yet, if intertextual explorations are insufficient, 
historical inquiries and sociological explorations deficient, and theological systems 
contrived at best, then how does one answer the question: Why must Satan be 
released?46  A closer examination of Revelation 20:1-10 offers some clues. 
Johns Portrait: Overlooked Anomalies in Revelation 20:1-3, 7-10 
 In Revelation 20:1-3 and 7-10, there are important details used to paint the 
picture that are oftentimes overlooked or seen as anomalous.  First, Revelation 20:1-
3 describes two actions done to Satan by the angel from heaven: (1) Satan is bound 
and (2) he is imprisoned.  Along with the key to the Abyss, the angel from heaven 
first in 19.11f. deals with the destruction of the beast and its followers, whereas the second is 
concerned with the power behind the beast, the Devil himself.  See also Bauckham, Climax, 19-21; 
Boxall, Revelation, 286. 
45 Rowland, Heaven, 423, 436; Farrer, Rebirth, 45; Kmmel, Introduction, 458. 
46 Other attempts to answer this question include: Charles T. Chapman, The Message of the 
Book of Revelation (Collegeville, Minn.: Liturgical, 1995), 122 spiritualizes the event to avoid the 
question; Virgil A. Cruz, Jesus Shall Reign: A Biblical Understanding of the Millennium, RefR 52.2 
(1998-1999): 89-90 suggests God is setting up a divine mouse trap for evil humanity dormant 
throughout the millennium; John F. Walvoord, The Revelation of Jesus Christ (Chicago: Moody, 
1966), 303 contends that God is justifying his actions of judgment before man; Jonathan MacKinney, 
Revelation: Plain and Simple (Longwood, Fla.: Xulon, 2006), 453 argues that the event intends to 
reveal Satans true nature for all to see. 
Chapter 6 
holds the great chain that he uses to bind Satan.  The term  (chain) 
describes the shackles that bind the hands of the captive47 and sometimes even his 
feet as well.48  Thus, the portrait painted shows Satan as a criminal bound with 
manacles in 20:2.49  In a separate event, the angel imprisons Satan in the Abyss in 
20:3a.  With these two distinct actions by the angel (binding and imprisonment), 
Satan awaits his foretold release for a thousand years (20:3b). 
In Revelation 20:7, one of these actions is undone while the other is never 
mentioned.  The release of Satan is specifically labeled in the text as a discharge 
from his prison (   20:7).50  While the release from prison is 
appalling, it is important to note the picture John paints. The events in Revelation 
20:1-3 are only partially reversed; the text never mentions that Satan is unbound 
from his chains.51 In other words, Satan is released from his prison still bound in 
shackles.52 
47 Acts 12:7; Philo, Flacc. 74. 
48 Mark 5:4; Luke 8:29; Acts 21:33.  Cf. Acts 28:20; 2 Tim 1:16; Eph 6:20; Wis 17:16. 
49 Mounce, Revelation, 361. 
50 The prison in 20:7 is equivalent to the abyss of 20:3, since that is the location into which 
he was thrown.  See Ben Witherington III, Revelation (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 
2003), 247; Beale, Revelation, 1021; and William H. Shea, The Parallel Literary Structure of 
Revelation 12 and 20, AUSS 23.1 (1985): 43. 
51 Revelation expects the audience to follow its imagery throughout the text without 
necessatating a full explanation every time it is used.  For example, the term key () is used 4 
times in Revelation (1:18; 3:7; 9:1; 20:1).  The initial usage in 1:18 governs the symbolic 
interpretation of the other three usages.  In 1:18 the keys refer to Jesus sovereignty over death and 
Hades attained through his life, death, and resurrection.  Thus, the key in Rev 3:7; 9:1; and here in 
20:1 refers to the same sovereignty achieved through Christs ministry.  The prior articulation of the 
key imagery in 1:18, then, precludes repetition of its full explanation in 20:1 as the angel exerts 
authority over Satan in his binding and imprisonment.  Similarly, the beast imagery of Rev 17 
assumes the reader remembers the significance and nuances of the beast from the sea in chapter 13.  
Still further, with the introduction of the false prophet imagery in Rev 16:13; 19:20; and 20:10 in 
tandem with the beast, Revelation expects the audience to connect this new image (the false 
prophet) with the ministry, nuances, and allegiances of the beast from the earth in Rev 13the second 
part of the beastly duo.  In other words, the text expects the audience to follow its imagery. 
52 Ekkehardt Muller, Microstructural Analysis of Revelation 20, AUSS 37.2 (1999): 232. 
Chapter 6 
Second, Revelation 20:3b indicates that Satan does not escape or claw his 
way out of his prison; instead, he is released by means of a divine mandate.  The 
Greek word , translated must, is defined in similar contexts as a Greek 
particlewhich means it is necessary, [and] was often used with the sense of 
divine destiny or unavoidable fate.53 In other words, the  designates the divine 
necessity for Satan to be releasedit is orchestrated by God, not by Satan.54  This is 
emphasized by the passive released () in 20:7, where the action is done to 
Satan and not by Satan.  So although the text ostensibly shows Satan leading an 
escape and rebellion, between the lines the text discloses a divine hand that guides 
and directs Satan, for purposes yet to be revealed. 
In sum, the picture painted in Revelation 20:1-3 and 7-10 shows Satan bound 
by an angel from heaven and then thrown into prison.  After a thousand years, Satan 
is released by God from prison to march across the breadth of the earth, while still 
bound with manacles.  So, what is John trying to communicate with these details?  
What does this imagery depict?  Put another way, Why must Satan be released?   
The answer does not surface in Old Testament allusions or theological 
schemas; instead, the picture is found in points of conversation with the Roman 
Empire. As described in chapter three above, imperial ideology was communicated 
in the public transcript through static (i.e., coins, altars, statues, etc.) and enacted 
(i.e., rituals, processions, ceremonies, etc.) propaganda.  These depictions of the 
sovereign narrative saturated the Roman world, including the cities of Asia Minor in 
53 , BAG: 172.

Chapter 6 
Revelation 2-3.  It is from this reservoir of images (points of conversation) that the 
Apocalypse constructs the picture of Satans release.  More specifically, Revelation 
20:7-10 depicts the release of Satan through a key conduit of the Flavian 
foundational myth: the Roman triumphal procession.55 
The Roman Triumph in the Roman Empire 
 Scott J. Hafemann describes the Roman triumph as the most important and 
well-known political religious institution of the period.56  As argued in chapter three 
above,57 the Roman triumphal procession uniquely unites the three key messages of 
the Roman sovereign narrative in one moment of enacted propaganda.  The Roman 
triumph is a celebration of the dominance of Rome that anticipates a lasting peace 
through the subjugation of a defeated enemy, all of which is brought about by the 
favor of the gods.   
Indeed, as seen in the previous chapter, the Roman triumphal procession of 
71 C.E. played a prominent role in the foundational myth of the Flavian dynasty
imperial propaganda to legitimize their claim to the throne.58 This potent event, 
however, is not just imperial propaganda.  The Roman triumph is an invitation for 
55 The terms Roman triumphal procession, triumphal procession, Roman triumph, and 
triumph are used interchangeably.

for an Etruscan origin for the procession in the late sixth century B.C.E. [so David Andrew Thomas,

ordained Roman dominance.59    
Key Features in the Roman Triumphal Procession60 
At the inception of the triumphal procession, the city streets are crowded with 
people in white garments attempting to catch glimpses of the parade.61  The 
procession displays a wide array of plunder from the military victory that heralds the 
wide-reaching dominance of Rome, including foreign weaponry,62 exotic plants and 
animals,63 royal furniture,64 and brilliant treasures.65  The spoils are punctuated by 
lists of lands conquered,66 placards with military statistics,67 and vivid depictions of 
battles in the war.68  The cumulative effect of these elements is to experientially

Theologies of Resistance in Early Judaism (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2011), 162-163. 
60 Although there is no set template for every triumphal processionfor each triumph 
contained nuances and artistic liberties that emphasized the emperors desired messagethe frequent 
repetition of certain features has led to a general consensus by scholars on some of the key elements 
in each triumph.  For further discussion, see Keith Hopkins, Conquerors and Slaves (Cambridge:

displace the observer from the side of the city streets to the frontlines of the 
celebrated battle.  Indeed, as Josephus recounts the visual displays of the Flavian 
triumph over the Jews in 71 C.E., he lauds that it is as if [the onlookers] had been 
there really present.69 
 Furthermore, the presence of subjugated enemy soldiers amidst the booty 
accentuates audience participation in the Roman triumph.  As Ovid details Tiberius 
triumph in 12 C.E., Before him, silver counterparts of the conquered walls, 
barbarian towns were carried with pictured men upon them, rivers and mountains and 
battles in deep forests, shields and spears in a confused pile, and from the gold of the 
trophies kindled by the sun, the buildings of the Roman forum turned to gold.  So 
many chieftains bore chains upon their vanquished necks that they could almost 
suffice to be the enemy [army].70  The defeat of a weak opponent, however, does not 
carry much honor or dignity, and therefore, the tallest and most beautiful captive 
soldiers are reserved for the triumphal procession.71  Marched in their native 
costumes,72 the enemy captives, at times, are forced to reenact moments of their

defeatmoments that bring humiliation for the defeated enemy and adulation for the 
captivated audience.73   
The rapturous atmosphere, however, reaches its pinnacle with the emergence 
of (1) the triumphant emperor and (2) the chief enemy leader bound in chains.  The 
emperor enters the parade in a chariot pulled by four white horses, known as the 
quadriga.74  If the members of the royal family do not accompany the emperor in the 
quadriga, then sometimes they ride in close proximity on single horses.75  Typically 
the emperor is dressed in a tunic ordained with palm designs and draped with a 
purple toga laced with gold thread.76  The emperor also bears a crown upon his 
head77 and key depictions of Jupiter to emphasize his divine connection.78 
73 Josephus, J.W. 7.142-147, many resemblances of the war, and those in several ways, 
and variety of contrivances, affording a most lively portraiture of itself; for there was to be seen a 
happy country laid waste, and entire squadrons of enemies slain; while some of them ran away, and 
some were carried into captivity; with walls of great altitude and magnitude overthrown, and ruined 
by machines; with the strongest fortifications taken, and the walls of most populous cities upon the 
tops of hills seized on, and an army pouring itself within the walls; as also every place full of 
slaughter, and supplications of the enemies, when they were no longer able to lift up their hands in 
way of opposition. Fire also sent upon temples was here represented, and houses overthrown and 
falling upon their ownersOn the top of every one of these pageants was placed the commander of 
the city that was taken, and the manner wherein he was taken (emphasis added).  See also Josephus,

Chapter 6 
 Directly in front of the triumphant emperors quadriga marches the splendid 
fruit of victory:79 the chief enemy leader bound in chains.80  The significance of this 
element can hardly be overstated.  Following the battle of Actium,81 Dio Cassius 
records Augustus zeal to capture Cleopatra alive to carry her back for his triumph 
(51.11.3), which even includes a resuscitation attempt after her successful suicide 
(51.14.3).  Her death is excessively grieved by Augustus, as if he had been 
deprived of all the glory of his victory (51.14.6; Cary, LCL).  To salvage this 
essential feature of his triumphal procession, Augustus has an effigy of the dead 
Cleopatra upon a couch carried in the parade, so that in a way shewas a part of 
the spectacle and a trophy in the procession.82   
Indeed, emperors stretch to great lengths to have the chief enemy leader 
present at the triumphal processioneven imprisoning the captive leader for years 
after the end of the battle in order to recall them for the magnificent parade.  As 
Cicero observes, But even those who have triumphs, and who on that account keep 
the generals of the enemy alive a longer time, in order that, while they are led in 
triumph, the Roman people may enjoy an ennobling spectacle, and a splendid fruit of 
78 Aune, Revelation, 3:1051.  Livy 10.7.10 (Foster, LCL) says the emperor was decked with 
the robes of Jupiter and some scholars suggest that the face of the emperor was painted with red to 
parallel Jupiter (based on Pliny, HN 33.1-2). These symbols (along with others) suggest that the 
emperor was intentionally portrayed as both god and king (so Versnel, Triumphus, 84-93; Thomas, 
Revelation, 42-58).  For a complete discussion, see Beard, Triumph, 219-256. 
79 Cicero, Verr. 2.5.77 (Yonge).  Beard, Triumph, 124-125, ancient writers are almost 
unanimous in identifying their place in the procession: ante currum, in front of the generals 
chariot.this phrase, in fact, is repeated so often that it seems almost the standard term in ancient 
triumphal jargonboth in literary texts and inscriptionsfor leading a victim in a triumphal 
procession.  See also Dio Cass. 51.21.9; Livy 6.4.

victory.83  The bound enemy leader is even found in static propaganda as a 
metonymy of the Roman triumph.84   
The march of the captive leader is thus an essential feature of the triumphal 
procession.  The final destination of the parade is the steps of the temple of the god 
Jupiter.85 It is here that the audience waits in silence for the commencement of the 
pinnacle moment of the Roman triumph.86  Hafemann writes, At the climax of the 
pageant, those prisoners and royalty who had been led in triumph and were not 
destined to be sold into slavery were executed in honor to the victor as the ultimate 
sign of his conquest and in homage to Romes deity.87 
The triumphal procession is both the climax of honor for Rome and the 
climax of humiliation for Romes enemy.88  A Roman triumph is enacted propaganda 
that impresses the sovereign narrative of Rome into the mind of the onlooker, whose 
role blurs between observer and participant.  In the triumphal procession, the 
dominance of Rome accents the favor of the gods, who provide the empire with

The Roman Triumph in Imperial Propaganda 
It comes as no surprise, then, to find the Roman world inundated with 
imagery in static propaganda from the Roman triumph.89  In addition to the Fasti 
Triumphales with over two hundred triumphs inscribed in the public forum,90 
triumphal processions are referenced over three hundred times in Roman literature.91  
The depictions of the triumph decorated the cities92 and adorned imperial coinage,93 
89 Beard, Triumph, 18-19 describes the significance of the Roman triumph in static 
propaganda, Public spectacles are usually ephemeral eventsIt is, of course, in the interests of the 
sponsors to ensure that the memory lasts, to give the fleeting spectacle a more permanent form, to 
spread the experience beyond the lucky few who were present on the day itself (cf. Thomas, 
Revelation, 3, 27).  In the time of Augustus, the triumphal procession experienced a major shift when 
the ritual was restricted only to members of the royal family.  Some see this action to be a political 
move to consolidate power and adulation to one man and one family.  It was also at this time that the 
Roman triumphal imagery began to inundate the empire through coins, monuments, buildings, and 
other forms of propaganda.  Beard, Triumph, 296 sees this as the inauguration of the age of the 
triumph.  For a full discussion, see Beard, Triumph, 61-71, 294-305; Miriam Griffin, Urbs Roma, 
Plebs and Princeps, in Images and Empire (ed. Loveday Alexander; Sheffield: Sheffield, 1991), 42; 
and Thomas, Revelation, 29-30, 47-49. 
90 The Fasti Triumphales (also known as the Fasti Capitolini) begins with the presumed first 
triumph of Romulus (735 B.C.E.) and ends with Lucius Cornelius Balbus (19 B.C.E.).  For more 
discussion, see Beard, Triumph, 61-67.

immersing the subjects of the empire in this potent symbol of dominance and divine 
favor.94   
In fact, as seen in chapter five above, the Flavians used the Roman triumph in 
71 C.E. as a moment that marked the definitive announcement of the new dynasty 
in Rome.95  The triumphal procession was enacted propaganda that celebrated the 
inauguration of a dynastic shift in the history of Rome.  Indeed, the Flavian 
foundational myth consistently references the triumph in static propaganda to 
remind the empire of their legitimate claim to the throne.  As seen on the coin below 
(minted in 70-71 C.E.),96 the obverse depicts the profile of Vespasian crowned with 
laurel.  
94 Beard, Triumph, 265 describes the Roman triumph as embedded in the day-to-day 
political, social, and cultural world of Rome, with innumerable links and associations, both personal 
and institutional, to other ceremonies, customs, events, and traditions.

The reverse portrays Vespasian in the Roman triumph of 71 C.E.  Riding in the 
quadriga, Vespasian extends a palm branch over the head of a trumpeter while being 
crowned by Victory.  Directly in front of the four horses, a Roman soldier escorts a 
captive whose hands are bound behind his back.  As heralded in the triumphal 
procession of 71 C.E., the coin loudly proclaims the accession of the Flavian dynasty 
in its symbolism as well as its caption: TRIVMP AVG.97 
Still further, the city of Ephesus (Rev 2:1-7) had a magnificent temple 
dedicated to the imperial cult worship of the Flavian family98 along a main city road 
that leads to the agora past the frequented bath houses, public restrooms, and even 
the local Jewish synagogue.99  In this location of intersection, just outside of the 
imperial cult temple, sacrifices in honor of the emperor were offered on an altar 
decorated with static propaganda. 
As can be seen in the museum of Ephesus today, this open air altar at the 
Flavian temple (pictured below) is decorated with Roman triumph imagery.

98 This temple in Ephesus has traditionally been labeled the temple of Domitian, but Steven 
J. Friesen, Twice Neokoros: Ephesus, Asia, and the Cult of the Flavian Imperial Family (Leiden: Brill, 
1993), 29-49 (esp. 35-38) forcefully argues that the more accurate title is the temple of the Sebastoi.  
He concludes on page 36, Thus, on the basis of the description of the cult in the temple inscriptions, 
it is clear that the provincial cult of the Sebastoi in Ephesus was a cult for the emperors of the Flavian 
family, and perhaps included Domitia.  For further analysis, see Friesen, Neokoros, 69, 155-156; 
idem, Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John: Reading Revelation in the Ruins (New York: 
Oxford University Press, 2001), 43-55; S.R.F. Price, Rituals and Power: The Roman Imperial Cult in

symbolizing the spoils of war marched in a triumphal procession.

All of the spoils of war from both sides direct the attention of the passerby to the two 
figures in the middle.  One stands in Roman military garb, a weapon raised, looking 
down at the second figure: a seated, single bound captive awaiting his execution.   
In addition to other Roman triumph depictions throughout the empire, the 
imagery on the altar in Ephesus reiterates the Flavian foundational myth with the 
triumphal procession of 71 C.E. (enacted propaganda) frozen in stone (static 
propaganda) at its climactic moment: the execution of the chief enemy leader.  As 
Mary Beard concludes in her masterful work The Roman Triumph, I have come to 
read the Roman triumph in a sense that goes far beyond its role as a procession

through the streets.  Of course it was that.  But it was also a cultural idea, a ritual in 
ink, a trope of power, a metaphor of love, a thorn in the side, a world view, a 
dangerous hyperbole, a marker of time, of change, and continuity.106  Thus, the 
pervasiveness of the triumphal imagery in the imperial propaganda of Rome and in 
the Flavian sovereign narrative presents the Roman triumphal procession as a key 
point of conversation for subject texts, like the book of Revelation.107 
The Roman Triumph in Revelation 19:11-21 
 Building upon the suggestion of David Aune, David Andrew Thomas argues 
persuasively for the Roman triumph as the driving imagery behind key symbols in 
Revelation 19:11-21.108  Summarily, in Revelation 19:11, Jesus enters the scene on a 
106 Beard, Triumph, 333. 
107 So 2 Cor 2:14 (NRSV), But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal 
procession, and through us spreads in every place the fragrance that comes from knowing him.  
Similarly, Col 2:15 (NIV) states, And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public 
spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.  For further discussion on these two texts, see 
Lamar Williamson, Led in Triumph: Pauls Use of Thriambeuo, Int 22 (1968): 317-322; Hemer, 
Letters, 147; Beard, Triumph, 14 (n. 14); Peter OBrien, Colossians, Philemon (Waco: Word Books, 
1982), 127; Peter Marshall, Metaphor, 302-317; cf. Rory B. Egan, Lexical Evidence on Two 
Pauline Passages, NovT 19 (1977): 34-62.  Scholars suggest Roman triumph parallels in other 
biblical passages as well, including: Ephesians 4:8 [Thomas, Revelation, 63-66]; Mark 15:16-32 [T.E. 
Schmidt, Mark 15.16-32: The Crucifixion Narrative and the Roman Triumphal Procession, NTS 41 
(1995): 1-18; Paul Brooks Duff, The March of the Divine Warrior and the Advent of the Greco-
Roman King: Marks Account of Jesus Entry into Jerusalem, JBL 111.1 (1992): 55-71].  In the mid-
second century C.E., Tertullian, Apol. 50.1-3 (ANF 3:54-55) writes, In that case, you say, why do 
you complain of our persecutions? You ought rather to be grateful to us for giving you the sufferings 
you want. Well, it is quite true that it is our desire to suffer, but it is in the way that the soldier longs 
for war. No one indeed suffers willingly, since suffering necessarily implies fear and danger.  Yet the 
man who objected to the conflict, both fights with all his strength, and when victorious, he rejoices in 
the battle, because he reaps from it glory and spoil. It is our battle to be summoned to your tribunals 
that there, under fear of execution, we may battle for the truth. But the day is won when the object of 
the struggle is gained. This victory of ours gives us the glory of pleasing God, and the spoil of life 
eternal. But we are overcome. Yes, when we have obtained our wishes. Therefore we conquer in 
dying; we go forth victorious at the very time we are subduedThis is the attitude in which we 
conquer, it is our victory-robe, it is for us a sort of triumphal car.  See also Lactantius, Inst. 1.11;

108 Aune, Revelation, 3:1050-1052; Thomas, Revelation, 21-89.  Thomas conclusion, 
however, suggests that in addition to the Roman triumph, the Nero Myth influences the images and 
language of Rev 19:11-21.

white horse and is labeled in 19:16 with the regal designation king of kings and lord 
of lords.  Jesus army surrounds him and is dressed in fine linen, white and clean 
(19:14), like the onlookers of a Roman triumph.109 Revelation 19:12 describes Jesus 
as adorned with many crowns, in reference to the crowns obtained in battle and 
celebrated in the triumph.110 
Still further, instead of military apparel, Jesus approaches the alleged battle 
with attire that celebrates his victory on the crosshis robe dipped in blood (19:13).  
As Beard observes about the Roman triumph, Though a military ceremony in many 
respects, there is no sign that the general ever appeared in military garbs.  Quite the 
reverse: his war was over.111  Indeed, while portrayals of war play out in the 
imagery that follows (19:19-21), no war is actually fought; there is only an 
execution.  This is the second out of three scenes in Revelation in which the evil 
army is gathered () to make war (Rev 16:14, 16; Rev 19:17, 19; and 
20:8).112  Each time, however, there is no battle, just an annihilation.  
The no battle motif reiterates the battle has already been won on the cross 
(Rev 1:17-18; 5:6, 9-10, 11-12).  Indeed, Revelation 12:10-11a celebrates the 
military victory over the dragon (12:1-9), Now have come the salvation and the 
power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah, for the accuser 
of our comrades has been thrown down (), who accuses them day and night

before our God.  But they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb113  As 
David Barr concludes, Of course no war is narrated, for the battle is already won by 
the faithful testimony of Jesus. Of course, the warrior wears a bloodied robe, for he 
has bled for this victory114  Thus, like triumphal processions, Jesus approaches 
the event with dress that heralds his war was overa robe dipped in blood.115  At 
this point, Thomas concludes that Revelation 19:11-21 depicts Jesus as the 
triumphant emperor riding victoriously in his triumphal procession.116   
This conclusion, however, overlooks some significant details as well as the 
subsequent context.  Indeed, in Revelation 19:11-21, Jesus is portrayed with 
significant elements of the imperial family in the Roman triumph, but it is remiss to 
assume that he is the triumphant emperor.  First, he does not ride in a chariot pulled 
by four white horses (a quadriga).117  Although rare exceptions to the presence of the 
four white horses do exist,118 numismatics and architecture show that the quadriga 
113 NRSV (emphasis added).  In Rev 12, the word  (hurled) is reiterated in 
connection to Satan (Rev 12:9 [2x], 10, 13).  This same word is used to describe Satans imprisonment 
in 20:3 and his descent into the lake of fire in 20:10.  Cf. Rev 19:20.

See also: Witherington, Revelation, 244.  Thompson, Revelation, 217 (n. 14) refers to Rev 20:7-10 as

Fiorenza, Justice, 121; Rowland, Heaven, 434, 436; cf. Nasrallah, Christian Responses, 167.  For 
more discussion, see pp. 275-287 below. 
115 Although Thomas does not make this point, it supports and follows his trajectory of 
triumphal imagery in Rev 19:11-21. 
116 Thomas, Revelation, 74-84, 86-89. 
117 As acknowledged but dismissed by Aune, Revelation, 3:1052 and Thomas, Revelation, 4, 
75-76. 
118 In one of Pompeys triumphs in the first century B.C.E., in order to present himself like 
the god Bacchus, he used elephants to pull his chariotalthough his experiment was ultimately 
unsuccessful (see Pliny, HN 8.4; Plutarch, Pomp. 14.4; Granius Licinianus 36.3-4).  The origin of the 
tradition of four white horses goes back to the triumph of Caesar in 46 B.C.E. (Dio Cass. 43.14.3), 
which intentionally paralleled Jupiter who had his chariot drawn by white horses (Herodotus 7.40; 
Aeschylus, Pers. 386-387).  See Beard, Triumph, 234-236 and Versnel, Triumphus, 67. 
Chapter 6 
was an essential feature of the imagery of the Roman triumph by the time of 
Domitians reign.119   
Second, the triumphal procession climaxes with the triumphant emperor at 
the end of the parade, not at the beginning.120  As stated above, after the procession 
of the spoils of war and depictions of victory, the chief enemy leader bound in chains 
marches directly in front of the quadriga of the triumphant emperor as the pinnacle 
of the event.121 While it is conceivable that a member of the imperial family (i.e., a 
son) could be amongst the spoils on a single horse,122 the emperor himself does not 
process amongst the spoils, because the quadriga is an essential feature at the end of 
the procession.123  These two points suggest that although Jesus is presented as a part 
of the imperial family celebrated in the triumph, he is not depicted as the triumphant 
emperor.   
So why does Revelation 19:11-21 distinguish Jesus amidst the procession on 
a single white horse (19:11)?  The Flavian Roman triumph in 71 C.E. offers a 
significant parallel to this depiction.  In this event, seared in the minds of Jews and 
Christians alike, Vespasian, the newly inaugurated emperor, rides in the quadriga 
with his son Titus, who was a key general in the victory over the Jewish nation.124  
Domitian, however, rides in the triumph on a single white horse in close proximity to 
119 See footnote 74 above.

Chapter 6 
his father (Vespasian) and brother (Titus).125  This striking parallel suggests, then, 
that John intentionally depicts Jesus in Revelation 19:11-21 as the son of god who 
rides in his fathers triumphal procession on a single white horse.  This distinction 
not only draws a connection to the Flavian foundational myth, but it also signals 
there is more of the parade to come.  The procession is not over, but just beginning. 
 So if Jesus begins the triumphal procession in Revelation 19:11-21, then how 
does Revelation 20:1-10 fit into the Roman triumph imagery?  The answer to this 
question is also the answer to the question that began this chapter, Why must Satan 
be released?   
The Roman Triumph in Revelation 20:7-10 
Triumphal procession allusions abound in Revelation 19:11-21, but the 
climactic feature of the triumph has not yet appeared in the imagery of the 
Apocalypse: the march of the chief enemy leader bound in chains.  As Thomas 
summarizes: 
The most important element of [the Roman triumph] was the parading of live 
prisoners, especially enemy commanders, princes, and kings.  Their eventual 
sacrifice at the Capitol reveals that the triumph was meant to be more than 
just a celebration of a past victory or even a means to relive it.  The triumph 
was an act of consummation.  The victory for the triumphator was not 
complete until his hated foe was no more, and the triumph was the ordained 
means to realize this crucial final detailUntil the triumph, therefore, the 
matter was officially and deliberately (if not essentially) left open.126 
Again, the significance of the bound enemy leader for the triumphal procession can 
hardly be overstated.127  Although at times the triumph does not occur for months or 
125 Suet., Dom. 2.1 (Rolfe, LCL), [Domitian] also attended [Vespasian and Titus] 
triumph over Judaea riding on a white horse.  See also Josephus, J.W. 7.152; Dio Cass. 65.12.  See 
also footnote 75 above. 
126 Thomas, Revelation, 38. 
127 See pp. 240-242 above. 
Chapter 6 
even years after the battle was won, the chief enemy leader is not killed but 
imprisoned to preserve this crucial final detail of the procession when the wars 
delayed consummation becomes a reality.128 
 Similarly, Revelation 20:1-3 contains the delay motif with the persistent 
reiteration that the dragon is subjugated for 1,000 years (20:2, 3).  Satan is bound 
(20:2) and imprisoned (20:3a) to preserve him for the divinely ordained moment of 
his release, which is emphasized in 20:3b, he must be let out for a short time.  The 
linguistic connection in Revelation 20:2a to Revelation 12:9 reminds the reader of 
the catalyst for Satans defeat: the victory in the battle at the cross.129  Similar to 
Jesus attire in Revelation 19:13, the actions taken toward Satan indicate that while 
the battle is won, victory was officially and deliberately (if not essentially) left 
open to await the consummation at Gods triumphal procession. 
As mentioned earlier, while Satan is released from prison after the 1,000 year 
delay in 20:7, he is not released from his shackles.130  Through the  in 20:3b and 
the unseen hand that releases Satan from prison, God is pictured in Revelation 20:7-
10 as sovereignly leading Satan, the bound captive, to Gods intended destination: 
128 See Beard, Triumph, 163-167, 202; Thomas, Revelation, 38; Cicero, Att. 4.18.4; Dio Cass. 
37.47-48; 39.65. 
129 Rev 12:9,              .  Rev 
20:2a,            .  Further linguistic connections 
reiterate this point.  The word  (key) in 20:1 is first used in 1:18 in connection to Jesus 
authority attained at his death, And I am the Living One, that is I was dead and yet behold I am living 
for ever and ever.  And I have the keys () of death and hades.  The word  (threw) in 
20:3 is also used in 12:9 [2x], 10, 13 when Satan is hurled down (12:10) and conquered through 
the blood of the Lamb (12:11).  See also Rev 5:6, 9-10, 11-12. 
130 See pp. 233-234 above.  Cf. Dio Cass. 49.40.3-4; Plutarch, Ant. 50.4; Vell. Pat. 2.82.3-4; 
Strabo, Georg. 2.14.15.  In addition, Seth Schwartz, Josephus and Judaean Politics (Leiden: Brill, 
1990), 6 compounds the oddity if Satans shackles had been removed: But Titus suggested that 
Josephus chains be severed, a ceremonial annulment of captive status; for this is done to those who 
have been bound unjustly (BJ 4.628).  Thus Josephus acquired epitimia (BJ 4.629).Josephus 
seems to be describing a form of restitution in integrum, the restoration of a captive, slave, etc., to his 
status quo ante 
Chapter 6 
Satans execution.131  Reminiscent of enemy captives in Roman triumphal 
processions, Satan reenacts in a dramatic fashion the moment of his defeat.132  As in 
the previous two battles in Revelation 16 and 19, the enemy is gathered for war, 
but there is only an annihilation, because like other triumphs, the battle is already 
Bringing to mind the placards that list statistics and the names of conquered 
lands in other triumphal processions, Revelation 20:7-8 celebrates the magnitude of 
131 See p. 235 above.  While the text states that Satan is tormented day and night for ever 
and ever, the language of execution is still appropriate for at least two reasons.  First, the imagery 
intends to communicate the final destination of a non-physical being in a location that is consistently 
emphasized as eternal and therefore not bound by the constraints of space and time (Rev 14:11; 
19:3; cf. Rev 11:15; 21:25, 27; 22:5).  Within these parameters, then, the only way to communicate 
something comparable to a death or an execution would be a perpetual state of punishmentor 
eternal torment.  Second, similar language to execution is associated with the lake of fire two 
times in the immediate context of Rev 20:7-10.  In Rev 20:14 and 21:8, the lake of fire is defined as 
the second death, which clarifies the emphasis intended when Satan is thrown into the lake of fire in 
20:10it is his annihilation, death, execution, and/or place of eternal torment.  Without moving 
further into the nature of metaphoric language, it is sufficient, here, to conclude that the use of 
execution in connection to Satans final destination is altogether appropriate and even expected 
given the context of the passage and triumphal imagery developed in the text thus far.  See Friesen, 
Imperial, 156; Thompson, Revelation, 89-91. 
132 As stated previously (see pp. 121-122, 179-181, 237-239), a key feature of a Roman 
triumph is the dramatization of the vanquisheds moment(s) of defeatelaborate depictions of many 
resemblances of the war (Josephus, J.W. 7.142).  Likewise, Revelations imagery and grammar 
surrounding Rev 20:7-10 invokes the same connotative and denotative feature in Satans release.  
First, as stated above (pp. 225-227), the complete annihilation of rebellious humanity in Rev 19:20-21, 
directly preceding the binding and imprisonment of Satan (20:1-3) and the 1,000 year reign (20:4-6), 
prompts questions like, If the rebellious nations are completely destroyed, then who does Satan 
deceive in 20:7-8?  From where does an evil army as numerous as the sand of the sea (20:8) come?  
The peculiar presence of this legion suggests that this is not a new occurrence of prior actions and 
opportunities by Satan, but a dramatization of a previous defeat.  In addition, as stated above (pp. 227-
228), the entire event of Satans release is introduced with the phrase, And when the thousand years 
are completed  Thus, this event (e.g., the release, the deception, the gathering, the siege, the defeat, 
etc.) occurs after the second coming.  Like the presence of the previously defeated army, this 
syntactical demarcation suggests that the actions after 20:7a should not be viewed in the same manner 
as parallel actions and opportunities for Satan prior to the second coming.  Given Revelations 
emphasis on Satans defeat at the cross and yet delayed consummation (12:10-12; 19:13; see pp. 275-
287 below for more discussion on this point), it is not surprising to find Satans actions after the 
second coming in 20:7a described with similar language for his actions before the second coming 
when he was defeated (i.e., deception12:9; 13:14; 16:13-16; 18:23; 19:20;  20:8; gathering 
together16:14, 16; 19:17, 19; 20:8; etc.)for a Roman triumph dramatizes the defeat of the 
vanquished with parallel imagery yet in fundamentally different settings.  So, if Rev 20:7-10 utilizes 
the Roman triumph as a point of conversation, actions and imagery reminiscent of the previous 
battle are expected but, fundamentally, are not the same actions, which, by definition, is a 
reenactment. 
Chapter 6 
this military victory with the pronouncement of the enemy leaders army as 
numerous as the sand of the sea.133  Indeed, the names Gog and Magog appear in 
the middle of the text like a banner announcement conjuring up images of a great 
Jewish battle with cosmic implications.134  The reenactment of their defeat depicts 
the bound enemy leader in siege of the barracks of the saints, that is the beloved 
city,135 which ends with the conflagration of the enemy army (20:9).136  At this 
point, the climactic moment of the triumphal procession is achieved: Satan, the chief 
enemy leader in chains, is disposed in the lake of fire (20:10).   
As in other Roman triumphs, the bound captive leader is not at the beginning 
of the parade (e.g., Rev 19:11-21) but is put on display as the climactic spoil of 
war that precedes the emergence of the triumphant general.137  It comes as no 
surprise, then, that immediately following this context is the magnificent procession 
133 Aune, Revelation, 3:1095 defines the phrase as a metaphor for great abundance (cf. Gen 
41:49; Job 29:18; Ps 139:18; Jer 15:8; Hab 1:9; Pr. Man. 1:9; Jos. Asen. 1:2; Gk. Apoc. Ezra 2:32; 
3:2.  Used for an army: Josh 11:4; Judg 7:12; 1 Sam 13:5; 1 Macc 11:1).  Ironically, this metaphor is 
used in Gen 22:17; 32:12 to describe the people of God. 
134 The term Gog is only found in the Bible in 1 Chr 5:4; Ezek 38-39; and in Rev 20:8.  
The term Magog is only found in the Bible in Gen 10:2; 1 Chr 1:5; Ezek 38-39; and in Rev 20:8.  
Boring, Revelation, 209 notes, By Johns time, Jewish tradition had long since transformed Gog of 
Magog into Gog and Magog and made them into the ultimate enemies of Gods people to be 
destroyed in the eschatological battle.  Cf. Amos 7:1 (LXX); Sib. Or. 3.512; 3 En. 45:5; b. Sanh. 97b. 
135 The term  (surrounded) in 20:9 is used elsewhere to describe a military siege (2 
Kgs 6:14; 18:13-19:37; Isa 29:3; 36:1-3; Luke 19:43; 21:20; Jdt 7:19-20; 1 Macc 15:14). 
136 In agreement with footnote 132 above, Richard C. Beacham, Spectacle Entertainments of 
Early Imperial Rome (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999), 40 states, The primary expressive 
element of a [Roman triumph] is, of course, the ranks of marchers, whoare simultaneously the 
performers as well as a highly effective living scenic device, whose controlled and coordinated 
movement and sounds can stimulate a powerful emotional response in the spectators.The event is 
also defined and the emotional response to it informed by a motivating purpose: in the case of the 
triumph, to celebrate an entire panoply of entitiesthe gods, the state, the conquering general, his 
soldiers, the captured plunder and the victory.

of the one on the throne in 20:11-21:4, which concludes with a depiction of the 
consummation of the celebrated victorycosmic Pax (21:5-22:6).138   
Conclusion 
A Roman triumphal procession functions to bring the audience into enacted 
propagandato bring the audience into the battle and immerse them in the drama of 
the victory of the war.  The audience, then, actually becomes a participant in the 
propaganda and not just an observer of the images.  The same is true here in 
Revelation 20:7-10. 
According to Revelation, the war is won through Christs victory on the cross 
(i.e., Rev 12:10-11; 19:13).  The battle, however, is left open-ended until the 
triumphal procession.  Jesus appears in Revelation 19:11-21 as the son of God on a 
white horse, beginning the triumph that culminates in the emergence of the one on 
the throne in 20:11-21:4.  A central feature of this triumph is depicted in 20:1-10 
when Satan is bound and imprisoned (20:1-3) to await his role in the parade.  
Bringing to mind other chief enemy leaders, the dragon is released from his prison 
and led in chains to reenact his own defeat (20:7-10).   
Given the saturation of triumph imagery in Roman static propaganda and the 
central feature of the triumphal procession in the Flavian foundational myth (i.e., 
the public transcript), the recipients of Revelation can view the release of the 
bound enemy leader (i.e., a point of conversation) not as an event to fear but as the 
consummation of a victorious promise (i.e., a hidden transcript).  As in the Roman 
triumph, this image is the climax of both honor and humiliation.  So, Why must 
138 The first time the one on the throne is portrayed is in Rev 4:1-11.  This scene is heavily 
reliant on Ezek 1:1-3:13.  In Ezekiels text Gods throne and the events around it are portrayed in 
chariot-like depictions, reminiscent of the Roman Emperors quadriga in the Roman triumph.

Satan be released?  Satan is released so that he can participate in Gods triumphal 
procession. 
Chapter 7 
Chapter 7: 
The Alter-Imperial Paradigm: 
Revelation and Empire Studies 
How does Revelation interact with the empire?  The Alter-Imperial paradigm 
engages this question through several key elements.  First, the grammar of the 
sovereign narrative is analyzed through the imperial billboards that saturate the 
empire.  The static and enacted propaganda of the Roman public transcript provide 
insight into the grammar used to articulate the Roman sovereign narrative.  As a 
result, analysis of the imperial propaganda not only allows the voice of the empire to 
be heard more clearly but also allows the echoes of the sovereign narrative in the 
subject texts to be more readily detectable. 
Second, the date of the subject text is established.  To understand what 
interaction takes place between the subject text and the sovereign narrative, it is 
important to establish when the conversation occurs.  This acknowledges the 
individual emphases of the sovereign narrative by the various emperors and dynasties 
in their imperial propaganda.  A date of composition isolates the images and 
conversations relevant to the socio-historical context, which for the book of 
Revelation is at the end of the reign of Domitian (92-96 C.E.). 
Third, the Alter-Imperial paradigm develops the socio-historical context of 
the subject texts date.  This offers a more detailed picture of how the Roman 
sovereign narrative was communicated and enforced during that time period.  Thus, 
potential points of conversation with the sovereign narrative emerge that may be 
utilized in contemporary subject texts.   
Chapter 7 
With the date of the Apocalypse at 92-96 C.E., the imperial propaganda of 
the Flavian dynasty emphasized not only the restoration of Pax and the favor of the 
gods under their reign (after the instability of the civil wars of 68-69 C.E.) but also 
the restitution of Roman dominance visible in the complete subjugation of the Jewish 
nation (from which Christians were not readily distinguished by the Roman elite).  
Therefore, Anti-Jewish elements were central features in the Flavian dynastys 
foundational myth, which is celebrated on coins, with building projects, and in the 
Roman triumph of 71 C.E.  This static and enacted propaganda of the Flavian 
dynasty offers points of conversation for the book of Revelation. 
Fourth, the points of conversation are used to mine the subject text for 
imperial intersections.  To test the effectiveness of the Alter-Imperial paradigm, 
Revelation 20:7-10 (the release of Satan) functions as a case study.  While this 
passage occurs at a climactic moment in the narrative, it is a notoriously difficult text 
that previous interpretative approaches in Revelation scholarship (i.e., intertextual 
explorations, historical inquiries, and sociological investigations) fail to explain 
adequately.   
Through the Alter-Imperial paradigm, however, the Roman triumphal 
procession proves to be an informative point of conversation that offers a new 
interpretation of the release of Satan.  Specifically, Satans binding (20:1-2) and 
imprisonment (20:3) are only partially reversed in 20:7-10.  Through divine 
ordinance and guidance (20:3b, 7b), Satan is released from his prison yet still in 
shackles (20:7).  As the ancient serpent dramatizes his military defeat (20:8-9), he is 
marched in Gods triumphal procession which, like other triumphs, ends in the 
dragons execution (20:10).  The Roman triumph, then, is not just an essential feature 
Chapter 7 
of the Flavian foundational myth that communicates the key messages of the 
Roman sovereign narrative, but it is also a key point of conversation through 
which subject texts like Revelation can interact with the empire. 
Nevertheless, while this offers a lucid interpretation for a problematic text 
(Rev 20:7-10), it does not answer the overall question of the Alter-Imperial 
paradigm: How does Revelation interact with the empire?  It merely offers a new 
parallel to be considered.  An additional step must be taken in order to answer this 
question and to demonstrate how the Alter-Imperial paradigm impacts the book of 
Revelation and Empire Studies as a whole.   
Alter-Imperial Implications of Revelation 20:7-10: 
The Grammar of Rome and the Target of Eden 
The common assumption that Revelation is an anti-imperial document 
defuses serious analysis of the imagery in the Apocalypse, because it forces the 
conversation in one direction: subversion of the empire.  At this point in the analysis, 
the Alter-Imperial paradigm could fall prey to the same temptation as other Empire 
Studies advocates and simply conclude that the use of Roman triumph imagery in 
Revelation 20:7-10 intends to subvert the Roman Empire.  In other words, the use of 
a key Roman propaganda piece in Revelations subject text displays an anti-Roman 
intent for the entire document.1  This conclusion, however, overlooks the 
implementation of the imperial imagery in the release of Satan.  Indeed, the 
triumphal procession imagery in Revelation 20:7-10 reveals the key antagonist of the 
subject narrative: Satan.  Not Rome.   
1 As J. Nelson Kraybill, Apocalypse and Allegiance: Worship, Politics, and Devotion in the 
Book of Revelation (Grand Rapids: Brazos, 2010), 62 asserts, If Christians adapted signs and 
symbols from the Roman Empire and used them in exclusive worship of God and the Lamb, the 
borrowing was politically subversive. 
Chapter 7 
Rome in Revelation 
 This shift from Rome to Satan as the primary enemy of the text challenges 
Revelation scholarship on multiple fronts.  The anti-imperial assumption not only 
positions Rome as the central target of the Apocalypse (instead of Satan), but it also 
influences the interpretation of imagery throughout the entire book.  Still further, the 
assumption and the interpretation(s) have a reciprocal relationship that leads to 
sweeping anti-imperial conclusions.  The Alter-Imperial interpretation of Revelation 
20:7-10, however, challenges Revelation scholarship to rethink the function of Rome 
throughout the Apocalypse. 
For instance, the two beasts of Revelation 13 are broadly deciphered as 
follows: [1] the beast from the sea (13:1-8) represents the Roman Empire2 and [2] the 
beast from the earth (13:11-18) represents the imperial cult.3  This interpretation,

the sea, and commentators almost unanimously identify this beast with Roman hegemony.  In fact, 
this Beast from the Sea symbolism borders on allegory (cf. p. 159).  J. Nelson Kraybill, Imperial Cult 
and Commerce in Johns Apocalypse (JSNTSup 132; Sheffield: Sheffield, 1996), 26, 170 and Collins, 
Crisis, 58-59, however, suggest that, in addition to the Roman Empire as a whole, the first beast could 
also refer to the Emperor alone (cf. Fiorenza, Justice, 7).  For the two beasts as the emperor Hadrian 
and Antonius Polemon, see Thomas Witulski, Die Johannesoffenbarung und Kaiser Hadrian: Studien 
zur Datierung der neutestamentlichen Apokalypse (FRLANT 221; Gttingen: Vandenhoeck &

Chapter 7 
however, impacts more than just the commentary of Revelation 13:1-18.  As J. 
Nelson Kraybill notes, The two beasts, which loom so large in Johns symbolic 
world, provide the key to understanding Revelation as a whole.4  Indeed, the images 
of the two beasts as Romein conjunction with the beast in Revelation 17 and the 
destruction of the two beasts in Revelation 19lead interpreters to conclusions about 
the Apocalypse as taking a resistant stance5 against the oppressive power of the 
Roman Empire6 that guides the reader to a confrontation with Romes power and 
cult.7  Nevertheless, the Alter-Imperial paradigm suggests that this conclusion 
reduces the message of the Apocalypse by overinflating the significance of Rome in 
Revelation 13 and throughout the rest of the text.   
Three observations support this view.  First, Rome as the fulfillment of the 
imagery of the two beasts is consistent with the Old Testament allusions to Daniel 
7:1-7 in Revelation 13:1-8, but it does not adequately explain the modification to the 
Old Testament imagery in Revelation 13:11-18.  The parallels between the first beast 
in Revelation 13:1-8 and the four beasts in Daniel 7:1-7 include: the beast in 
Revelation 13 originates from the sea (Rev 13:1; Dan 7:3); it has the same total of 
heads as the four beasts in Daniel 7;8 it has the same number of horns (Rev 13:1b; 
Dan 7:7b); it resembles a leopard (Rev 13:2; Dan 7:6), a bear (Rev 13:2; Dan 7:5), 
and a lion (Rev 13:2; Dan 7:4); it is given authority to rule (Rev 13:2b, 4, 5; Dan 
7:6b) and  it is connected to arrogant utterances (Rev 13:5, 6; Dan 7:8b, 11a); and it

head, while the third beast in Dan 7:6 has four heads, which totals seven heads. 
Chapter 7 
made war against Gods people and conquered them (Rev 13:7; Dan 7:19, 21).9  The 
obvious interdependence between these two texts has been widely recognized in 
Revelation scholarship,10 and it is these parallels that drive the conclusion that the 
beast from the sea represents the Roman Empiregiven that Daniel 7:16b-17 states 
that the four beasts from the sea represent four successive empires.11   
If the beast imagery stopped in Revelation 13:1-8, then the conclusion that 
the beast from the sea represents Rome would be incontrovertible.  Nevertheless, 
Revelation modifies the Danielic imagery to include a second beast from the earth 
(Rev 13:11-18).  This unparalleled addition is traditionally explained through another 
Old Testament allusion to the Leviathan-Behemoth myth in Job 40-41.12  Yet, as 
David E. Aune points out, this second Old Testament layer is more aesthetic than 
substantive:  
These two beasts clearly reflect the Jewish myth of Leviathan, the female 
monster from the sea, and Behemoth, the male monster from the desert.  
Though this allusion provides a visionary framework for 12:18-13:18, the 
unity thereby imposed on the text unit is only superficial since important

Chapter 7 
features of the Leviathan-Behemoth myth are omitted and replaced with 
motifs derived from the myth of the eschatological antagonist.13 
In other words, the Leviathan-Behemoth myth offers parallel imagery of two beasts 
in Jewish literature in which one comes from the sea and the other comes from the 
earth (although the gender of the beasts in Revelation 13 are unspecified), but it does 
not explain important questions like: If Rome is the sole referent for the beast 
imagery in Revelation 13, then why introduce a second beast at all?  Why is the 
Leviathan-Behemoth parallel necessary if the author of Revelation wanted the 
imagery to center on the Roman Empire?  Isnt Daniel 7 alone sufficient to 
accomplish this anti-imperial goal?   
This intentional modification of Daniel 7 in Revelation 13 is not satisfied 
with an application to the Roman Empire alone.  Indeed, the parallel to Daniel 7 
conclusively points to an imperial connection with Rome, but the second beast 
modifies the imagery unnecessarily if the kingdom of Rome is the key targetfor in 
Daniels pattern, a second beast would indicate a second, successive kingdom, which 
no one argues for in Revelation 13.  Thus, this modification suggests that there is not 
a one-to-one correlation between Daniel 7 and Revelation 13, although they are 
clearly related.  While Rome is involved in the discussion in Revelation 13, it does 
not completely satisfy the nuances of the imagery or the intended message.  Thus, 
Revelation 13 could simultaneously connect Rome to its overall point but still hold 
that the overall point stretches beyond Rome.   
This possibility is supported by the second observation: the beast imagery 
throughout Revelation must be measured cumulatively.14  In Revelation 17:1-18, the 
13 David E. Aune, Revelation (3 vols.; WBC 52A-52C; Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 1997-
1998), 2:728. 
Chapter 7 
imagery of the beast appears once again as a prominent feature in the text.  Still 
described with the seven heads, ten horns, and covered with blasphemous names 
(Rev 17:3b; cf. 13:3), the beast from the sea in Revelation 13 is not connected with a 
second beast from the earth in this text but with a prostitute who is riding on the 
beast (17:3, 7).  The text describes the prostitute as sitting on seven hills (17:9) and 
as the great city having sovereignty over the kings of the earth (17:18), which has 
led Revelation scholars to widely acknowledge her as a symbol for the Roman 
Empire.15   
As Revelation 17:1 indicates, the purpose of this vision is to depict the 
destruction of the prostitute (17:16-17)the Roman Empire.16  Significantly, the 
prostitute is brought to her ruin by the beast and the ten horns, who make her 
naked, eat her flesh, and burn her with fire (17:16).  This graphic depiction of 
her defeat, followed by an elaboration of Romes defeat in Revelation 18, surfaces an 
awkward tension in the interpretation of Rome in Revelations imageryhow can 
Rome be both the prostitute (the one destroyed) and the beast (the one destroying) in 
this imagery?  As Kraybill uncomfortably summarizes, the beast [the Empire] will 
hate the whore [Rome].17

Chapter 7 
Accentuating the distinction between the prostitute and the beast, the 
eschatological onslaught launched by the beast and the ten horns against the Lamb 
and his faithful followers (17:12-14) seems to indicate that the ministry of the 
beast extends beyond the destruction of the prostitute.  Still further, the destruction of 
the beast and the false prophet are reserved for a completely separate account in 
Revelation 19:11-21, which is separated from the destruction of Babylon (Rome) in 
Revelation 1818 and the destruction of Satan in Revelation 20:7-10.  This cumulative 
picture of the beast(s) in Revelation 13, 17, and 19 indicates that while the image is 
associated with Rome, it is not exhausted in Rome.  Indeed, the beast is intentionally 
distinguished from Rome in its ministry and defeat, which is extended and supported 
by the third observation: Revelation purposefully connects figures of good and evil 
in deliberate pairings.19 
The pairings communicated through homologies and contrarieties,20 or 
parallels and parodies, bring into greater clarity the placement of Rome in the book 
of Revelation and, on some level, govern the interpretative possibilities for imagery 
referents to the Roman Empire.  Revelation scholars commonly recognize that the 
beast from the sea (Rev 13:1-8) is paired with Jesus in similar and contrasting

Wengst, Pax Romana and the Peace of Jesus Christ (trans. John Bowden; Philadelphia: Fortress, 
1987), 123.  Intriguingly, Lohmeyer, Offenbarung, 150, although ultimately denying Romes 
connection to Babylon (p. 151), draws a linguistic connection between Rev 18:12 and the Flavian 
Roman triumph (Josephus, J.W. 7.5.4) through the word  (silk). 
19 Thompson, Revelation, 87 refers to these pairings as dyads.  For a great discussion of the 
definition of boundaries in Revelation, see Thompson, Revelation, 75-86.

Chapter 7 
depictions that include:21 the presence of horns (Rev 13:1b; cf. 5:6b); the possession 
of diadems (13:1b; cf. 19:12a); the inscription of a name (13:1b; cf. 19:12b); the 
reception of authority (13:2b; cf. 5:7); the recipient of worship (13:4, 8; cf. 5:8, 9-10, 
12, 13); the leader in war (13:7; 19:19; cf. 19:11, 15); and, the most conspicuous 
parallel, the (apparent) death and resurrection motif (13:3; cf. 1:5a, 18; 5:6a; 13:8).   
Similarly, the Spirit of God in Revelation parallels the beast from the earth: 
as the second beast is intimately connected to the first beast (13:12a; 13:15), the 
Spirit is intimately connected to the Son (5:6; 19:10; 22:6); as the second beast 
practices a ministry of proclamation (13:13-14; 16:13; 19:20; 20:10), the Spirit 
practices a ministry of proclamation (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:1, 6, 13, 22; 22:17); as the 
second beast leads humanity to worship the agents of evil (13:12, 14b, 15), the Spirit 
leads humanity to worship the agents of good (1:10; 4:2, 5; 21:10).22  In Revelation, 
both the Spirit of God and the beast from the earth function as a key connection 
between humanity and divinityneither receiving worship, but both connecting 
humanity to contexts of worship through their ministries that proclaim the glory of 
the previous dyad (the beast from the sea and the Son) as well as a third pairing: the 
one on the throne (God the Father) and the dragon (Satan). 
The actions of the first two dyads are directly connected to the authority and 
aims of the third pairing.  In Revelation 13:1, Satan stands on the shore and, by his

Bauckham, Climax, 431-441; Blount, Revelation, 247-249; Boxall, Revelation, 188. 
22 A possible connection between the second beast and the Spirit occurs in Rev 11:11 and 
13:15 through a wordplay.  In both verses, the word  is used in connection with bringing 
something to lifethe two witnesses (11:11) and the image of the first beast (13:15). 
Chapter 7 
authority, summons the beast from the sea.23  Satan gives all of his authority to the 
beast (13:2b) and even allows the beast to be worshipped by humanity alongside of 
the dragon (13:4)who also has seven heads, ten horns, and diadems (12:3; cf. 
13:1b).  The dragons authority is used by the beast from the sea to continue to make 
war (13:7; cf. 12:7, 17)24 against God and his followers through slander (13:6; cf. 
12:8-9, 10b, 12b) and physical dominance (13:7, 10; cf. 12:4b, 7-8, 17).25  Thus, the 
ministry of the beast from the earthwho has the voice of a dragon (13:11b)does 
not just connect humanity to worship of the first beast, but also completes the triad of 
evil in Revelation by perpetuating the aims of the dragon (13:15b, 16-17) through the 
authority of the dragon (13:12). 
Likewise, in the triad of good, the Father holds a sealed scroll in his right 
hand (5:1) that no one can open (5:3) until the emergence of the Son, who appears as 
a slain lamb (5:5-6, 7, 9).  The authority of the Father is extended to the Son (2:26-
27) in the imagery through parallel titles,26 shared worship,27 and depictions of both 
23 As Friesen, Imperial, 202 declares, [John] wrote that the Beast from the Sea received its 
power, throne, and great authority from the Dragon, not from Jupiter or some other Olympian. 
24 The noun  is used eight times, and every time it is in connection with evil (9:9; 
11:7; 12:7, 17; 13:7; 16:14; 19:19; 20:8).  The verb , however, is used for both good (2:16; 
12:7a; 19:11) and evil (12:7b; 13:4; 17:14).  Cf. Collins, Combat Myth, 29. 
25 In addition, both Satan (2:9) and the beast from the sea (13:1, 5, 6) are linguistically 
connected with the word . 
26 Alpha and OmegaRev 1:8; 22:6 (the Father) and 22:13 (the Son); Beginning and 
EndRev 22:6 (the Father) and 22:13 (the Son).  The Son is also referred to in the parallel title 
First and the Last in Rev 1:17 and 22:13.  In addition, Rev 1:14 depicts the one like a son of man 
(Rev 1:13; cf. Dan 7:13) with hair white like wool, which is reminiscent of the description of the 
Ancient of Days on the throne in Dan 7:9. 
27 The same heavenly agents that worship God the Father in Rev 4 (i.e., the four living 
creatures4:6b-8 and the twenty-four elders4:10-11) worship the Son in Revelation 5 both alone 
(5:8-10) and together with the Father (5:13b-14).  This is in addition to the worship of the Lamb by 
multitude of angels that worship him (5:11-12), the great multitude in heaven (7:9-10worship of 
both the Father and the Son), and all of creation in heaven and on earth (5:13). 
Chapter 7 
reigning on the throne in heaven.28  This authority is used by the Son to bring 
resolution to the rebellious (2:4-5, 14-16, 20-23; 3:1b-3, 15-20; 6:12-17; 19:11-21) 
and transformation to the faithful (1:5-6; 2:10b, 17b, 26-27; 3:12, 21; 5:9-10; 7:14b-
15; 20:4-6), both of which are direct attacks on aims of the triad of evil.  Like the 
beast from the earth, the ministry of the Spirit, then, connects humanity to worship of 
the Son (and the Father) and completes the triad of good in Revelation by 
perpetuating the authority and aims of the Fatherfor in Revelation, worship is 
war.29 
The articulation of the cosmic triads, however, does not complete the pairings 
evident in the text.  Indeed, in Revelation, both triads collect a group of followers
the triad of evil through deception (12:9; 13:14; 16:13; 19:20; 20:8, 10; cf. 2:20) and 
the triad of good through sacrifice (1:4-6; 5:9-10; 7:14-15)that functions as the 
human manifestation of the respective triad.  To emphasize the connection the group 
of followers reflects the triad to which they belong in their appearance,30 actions,31 
and even in their seal of allegiance32the bride of Christ, that is the New Jerusalem 
(the Church), reflects the cosmic triad of good (God the Father, the Son, and the 
28 God the Father is introduced as sitting on the throne in heaven in Rev 4:2-6a, and the Son 
is introduced as the slain Lamb standing in the midst of the throne in Rev 5:6.  See also Rev 3:21; 
7:9, 10, 17; 22:3. 
29 Rev 8:1-5; 13:4, 8, 12, 15; 14:7, 9, 11; 15:4; 16:2; 19:20; 20:4b.  See also Friesen, 
Imperial, 176, 209; Thompson, Revelation, 53-73. 
30 For example, the prostitute in Rev 17:4 and Babylon in 18:16 are dressed in the color 
, which is the color of the beast in 17:3 (cf. 18:12), and the bride of the Lamb (21:9b) 
brilliantly shines like jasper, which is reminiscent of the appearance of the one on the throne in Rev 
4:3 who also radiates like jasper. 
31 So the followers of the triad of evil blaspheme (16:9, 11, 21; 17:3; cf. 2:9; 13:1, 5, 6) and 
deceive (2:20; 18:23; cf. 12:9; 13:14; 19:20; 20:8, 10), and the followers of the triad of good sacrifice 
(2:13; 13:10; 17:16; cf. 1:5, 18; 5:9) and bear witness (2:13; 17:6; cf. 1:5; 3:14). 
32 The followers of the triad of evil receive the  of the beast on their foreheads 
(13:16-17; 14:9, 11; 16:2; 19:20; cf. 20:4), and the followers of the triad of good receive the  
of God on their foreheads (7:2; 9:4; 14:1). 
Chapter 7 
Spirit) and the prostitute, that is Babylon (the Roman Empire), reflects the cosmic 
triad of evil (the dragon, the beast from the sea, and the beast from the earth).  This 
intimacy is evident, for instance, in the actions of physical and non-physical 
persecution by Roman society (Jews and Romans alike) attributed to Satan (the 
leader of the triad of evil) in Revelation 2 and 3 with phrases like: I tell you, the 
devil will put some of you in prison (2:10); I know where you livewhere Satan 
has his throne (2:13); I know the slander of those who say they are Jews and are 
not, but are a synagogue of Satan (2:9; cf. 3:9).33  As Leonard Thompson observes, 
In the process of nesting or extending the environment through metaphors 
and homologues nothing is left behind.  Minor local issues do not drop out as 
the seer moves to global and cosmic environments; rather, they are taken up 
into the cosmic.  Everythinglocal, global, animal, vegetable, mineral, 
divinekeeps its own place as it is taken into a larger unified system or 
ordered world.34 
In the Apocalypse, then, the cosmic triads are intricately interwoven into the 
existence of their followers, although they remain distinguishable images. 
Although the overall purpose of these pairings is to accentuate the sharp 
contrasts between the two groups in order to exhort the audience to decide for one 
or the other,35 the dyads also directly impact the interpretation of the beasts in 
Revelation 13 as Rome.  To be sure, the Roman Empire and the imperial cult are 
connected to the beasts in that Rome is the human conduit of the cosmic triad of evil; 
therefore, it is appropriate and even expected to see reflections of Rome in the 
imagery of the triad of evil.  Yet, it would be remiss to reduce two-thirds of the 
33 Collins, Crisis, 152 writes, Likewise, the fear of the hearers is not denied or minimized.  
On the contrary, it is intensified.  The hostile Jews and Roman authorities are not just ill-disposed 
human beings, but they have all the power of Satan on their side.  Cf. Friesen, Imperial, 188; 
Fiorenza, Justice, 54, 68.

Chapter 7 
cosmic triad of evil (the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth) down to the 
geographically and chronologically located group of followersRome.  In other 
words, these pairings reveal that to regard Rome as pure, self-sacrificial, and 
benevolent (a follower of the triad of good) is just as inaccurate as overinflating 
Romes significance in usurpation of the triad of evil.  In Revelation, Rome is 
categorized as a dispensable follower rather than a member of the cosmic triad of 
evil itself. 
The Battle Is Bigger than Rome 
Overall, these three observations challenge the anti-imperial assumption that 
sees Rome as the central target in Revelation 13 and throughout the rest of the 
Apocalypse.  In Revelation 13, the intentional modification of the imagery in Daniel 
7:1-7, with the inclusion of the second beast, is explained in the cumulative picture 
of the beast that follows.  Indeed, in Revelation 17:1-18 and 19:11-21, the imagery 
distinguishes Rome from the beast in the depiction, duration, and destruction of each 
entity.  Additionally, the good and evil pairings throughout the Apocalypse bring 
further clarity to the relationship of Rome and the beast imagery.  The triad of good 
(God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit) and its followers (the bride/New 
Jerusalemthe Church) parallel the triad of evil (Satan, the beast from the sea, and 
the beast from the earth) and its followers (the prostitute/Babylonthe Roman 
Empire), which subordinates Rome to the cosmic imagery of the beast.  Thus, to 
reduce Revelations primary target down to Rome is to miss the key antagonist 
Chapter 7 
completely.  For in Revelation, Satan is not dependent on Rome for success, but 
Rome is dependent on Satan for its authority and prosperity.36 
In fact, for the triad of evil, Rome is dispensable (Rev 17:16-18).  The 
moniker Babylon for Rome (Rev 17:5; 18:2, 10, 21; cf. 14:8; 16:19) invokes 
connections of imperial dominance over the people of God (Ps 137:1-4; Isa 39:6-7; 
Jer 20:4-6; 21:2-10; 22:25; 24:1; 27:6-9; Ezek 17:12; 24:2; Dan 1:1-2) and even the 
destruction of the temple (2 Kgs 25:8-15; Jer 39:8; 50:28; Dan 1:1-2).  In addition, 
the Babylon parallel contains an emphatic proclamation of the kingdoms 
destruction (Isa 13:19; 14:4, 22; 21:9; 39:1; 43:14; 48:14; Jer 25:12; etc.), and yet, an 
often overlooked detail of this imagery is that the destruction of Babylon only signals 
its replacement by another empire, another prostitute. 
The proclamation of Babylons replacement in Daniel 5:28 is visually 
depicted in Nebuchadnezzars dream in Daniel 2:31-40 as well as Daniels vision in 
Daniel 7:1-7.37  In each visualization, the currently reigning Babylon is the initial 
empirethe head of gold (Dan 2:38b) and the lion/eagle beast (Dan 7:4).  
Nonetheless, each vision emphasizes the dispensable nature of Babylon in that the 
mighty kingdom is replaced by three successive empires after its destruction (Dan 
2:39, 40; 7:5, 6, 7, 16b-17).  In other words, Babylonlike Sodom, Egypt, and 
othersis just another kingdom in a long line of kingdoms that are destroyed and 
replaced.  The use of this image in Revelation, then, emphasizes that Rome does not 
just parallel Babylons victories but also its dispensabilityfor the war is bigger than 
Rome. 
36 Contra Friesen, Imperial, 188 who states, Once Roman hegemony is destroyed, Satan 
himself is confined for a thousand years so that he will not deceive the nations (20:3,  ). 
37 See also Isa 45:1; Jer 50:27-33; 51:20-23. 
Chapter 7 
 Similarly, the Old Testament monikers for the false teachers in Revelation 2-
3 contain, on a smaller scale, the same emphasis of the dispensable nature of the 
human agents for the cosmic triad of evil.  The false prophets in the churches of Asia 
Minor are more recent iterations of the Satanic deception found in the proclamations 
of Jezebel (Rev 2:20; cf. 1 Kgs 16:29-33; 19:1-2; 21:5-23, 25; 2 Kgs 9:22), Balaam 
(Rev 2:14; cf. Num 31:16; Deut 23:4; Josh 13:22; 24:9-10; Neh 13:2), and others 
(Rev 2:6, 15; cf. Ezek 13:15b-16; Jer 20:6; 23:25; 29:21) used by the triad of evil to 
war against the triad of good and its followers.  The prophets, like Rome, are 
dispensable for the triad of evil in this ongoing battle.   
Still further, the saturation of the Apocalypse in Old Testament allusions 
suggests that the key enemy in this battle is trans-geographical and trans-generational 
(outside of space and time),38 which emerges in the use of Jezebel, Balaam, Sodom, 
Babylon, and Egypt to refer to present opposition.39  Thus, the hermeneutical avenue 
of the Seers expression (the Old Testament) does not allow us to reduce the 
complete application of the battle down to something in space and time alone (i.e., 
Rome).  In other words, Revelation is inundated with the Old Testament not because 
the imagery is merely analogous to Revelations present situation, but because it is a 
continuation of the same battle against the same key antagonist: the dragon, that 
ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan (Rev 20:2b; cf. 12:9).40  This battle began 
before Rome existed and will continue after Rome has fallen, because the battle is

39 Cf. Lohmeyer, Offenbarung, 151. 
40 Anathea E. Portier-Young, Apocalypse Against Empire: Theologies of Resistance in Early 
Judaism (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2011), 75, 77.  Thompson, Revelation, 83 rightly labels Satan as 
the most powerful and concentrated image of evil in Revelation. 
Chapter 7 
bigger than RomeSatan is the chief enemy leader in Gods triumphal procession 
(Rev 20:7-10). 
This conclusion, however, does not suggest that Revelation is indifferent or 
affirming towards Rome.  Indeed, given the relationship between Satan and Rome in 
the Apocalypse, in Revelation 20:7-10, there is an indirect anti-Roman element.  
Thus, to destroy the dragon who is sovereign over the triad of evil (Rev 13:2b, 7, 11-
12, 15) and its prostitute (Rev 17:9, 18) attacks Romes source of power and 
authority in Revelation.  Nevertheless, a tangential negative by-product of a much 
larger event is hardly equivalent to an anti-imperial intent for the entirety of the 
document.41  Instead, Satans role in Gods triumphal procession affirms the picture 
developed throughout the rest of the Apocalypse: Rome is not the key antagonist in 
the subject narrative. 
 In the middle of physical and non-physical persecution, the identity of the 
true target in the war can be easily misconstrued.  The imagery of the Apocalypse, 
though, clarifies the central enemy for the Christians in Asia Minor, because if the 
enemy is unknown or unclear, then it heightens the possibility of unwitting 
compromise or fighting the wrong battle in the wrong way and missing the essential 
target.  Thus, Revelation blurs the lines of the old and present manifestations of the 
evil triads attack to emphasize the key enemy in the battle: Satan.42   
Indeed, Revelation 20:7-10 is centrally concerned with the destruction of the 
dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan (20:2) and not the Roman 
41 Contra Friesen, Imperial, 213 who calls the Roman Empire [Revelations] chosen 
adversary, and concludes, In Johns system, then, there was no legitimate place for earthly 
empire.John was not just anti-Roman; he was anti-empire (p. 208).  See also Fiorenza, Justice, 
42 Even Friesen, Imperial, 169 refers to Satan as the major cosmic antagonist of Revelation. 
Chapter 7 
Empire.  With the triumphal procession parallel, the most potent Roman imagery is 
reserved not for the empire, but for the antagonist of Eden (20:2).  From the Alter-
Imperial perspective, Rome is simply too small a target to deserve mention in Gods 
triumphal procession.  In other words, to suggest an anti-Roman intent in the 
triumphal procession imagery in Revelation 19:11-20:10 or throughout the entirety 
of the document is to oversimplify the message by over-exaggerating the Roman 
Empire.  Thus, an anti-imperial approach regionalizes what for Revelation is cosmic. 
The Alter-Imperial Revelation 
 From an Alter-Imperial perspective, the book of Revelation does not reflect 
an anti-imperial intent with the destruction of Rome as its goal; instead, the 
Apocalypse uses imperial imagery to reveal the key antagonist (Satan) and to 
construct the alter-empire of the triad of good.43  This recent iteration of the 
ancient battle does not merely replicate the exact same story of God vs. Satan 
reflected in the Old Testament allusions.  As the first chapter of the Apocalypse 
indicates, this is a revelation of Jesus Christ (1:1) whose victory at the cross not 
43 In this context, the word construct (and create) indicates: building what does not exist, 
repairing what has fallen into disrepair, and fortifying what remains.  Therefore, the construction of 
the alter-empire does not envision simply the creation of something brand new, but instead, calls to 
overcome or strengthen what remains also fall into the category of construct.  Additionally, the 
verb tense constructs or creates is intentionally ambiguous to preserve the past, present, and future 
actions that contribute to the overall construction.  As Thompson, Revelation, 85 indicates about the 
cross in Revelation, There is a permanence to the crucified Lamb that cannot be captured by locating 
the crucifixion in time, for example under Pontius Pilate or in the first century of the Common Era.  
To put it differently, the crucifixion is much more than a momentary event in history.  That 
permanence is captured in the Book of Revelation through spatial, not temporal, imagery.  The slain 
Lamb appears not only on earth but also in heaven, close to the throne (5:6).  The Lamb was not slain 
at a particular moment in time; rather the Lamb was slain before time.  The seer describes that time in 
spatial language: the Lamb was slain from the foundation of the world (13:8, cf. 17:8).  The 
crucifixion is enfolded in the deep, permanent structures of the seers vision, and it unfolds in the 
life of Jesus and those who are his faithful followers. 
Chapter 7 
only constructs an alter-empire but provides it with the politics of conquest in this 
cosmic war.44 
The Construction of the Alter-Empire 
 The creation of the alter-empire dominates the imagery of the first chapter 
and resonates throughout the rest of the Apocalypse.  The triad of good is 
collectively revealed to the audience (1:4a) in Revelation 1:4b-5a: Grace and peace 
to you from him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the seven spirits 
before his throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the 
dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.  This initial depiction of the triad of 
good introduces the groups identifying grammar45 and directs the readers attention 
to the triads collective purpose: the construction of an alter-empire.   
Indeed, Revelation 1:5b-6a proclaims, To the one loving us and having 
released us from our sins by his blood, and he made [] us into a kingdom
priests for his God and Father.46  The juxtaposition of the terms kingdom and 
44 While Fiorenza, Justice, 4 does advocate Jesus as the one who has created an alternative 
reign and community, she reduces the target in the following phrase from Satan down to the Roman 
Empire.

46 Fiorenza, Justice, 72 states, The verb poieinrefers here to concrete persons who are 
given a new dignity, it should probably be understood in the sense of investing or installing 
someone.  The usage of poiein in this sense is not found in classical Greek, but in the LXX and in the 
NT, Kai epoisen is so used in Mark 3:14-19 where it refers to the institution of the twelve (And he 
appointed twelve), and in Acts 2:36, where it refers to the investiture of Jesus as Lord and Messiah 
by God.  The closest parallel to Rev. 1:6 is, however, found in 1 Sam 12:6; 1 Kings 12:31 and 13:33-
34, where the aorist epoisen is also used in connection with the accusative of hiereis.  Both OT texts 
emphasize that in the Northern Kingdom every member of the nation could be installed by Jeroboam 
as a priest without having to come from the Levitical tribe.  Thus Rev. 1:6 maintains that Christ 
Chapter 7 
priests47 alludes to the declaration by God on Sinai (Exod 19:3-6) that if the people 
of Israel, recently freed from their bondage in Egypt (19:4), submit to Gods 
covenant and sovereignty (19:5), then God pronounces that from among all nations 
you shall be a treasured possession to me.  Although all the earth is mine, you shall 
be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (19:5b-6).48  This Old Testament 
allusion, then, invokes a context in which the liberating acts of God create an alter-
empire (a holy nation).  Thus, in Revelation 1:4-6, the triad of good is introduced 
and linked to the exodus-event found in the sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross that 
creates a kingdom and priestsan alter-empire. 
Still further, allusions to Daniel 7 in Revelation 1 emphasize the same 
kingdom construction theme through the identity and actions of Jesus.  After the 
four beasts in Daniel 7:1-7, the vision shifts its attention in Daniel 7:9, As I 
continued to watch, thrones were placed and the Ancient of Days was seated.  His 
clothing was white like snow and the hair of his head was pure white like wool.  His 
throne was like a flame of fire and its wheels burning fire.  After witnessing the 
multitudes standing before the throne (7:10) and the destruction of the fourth beast 
(7:11-12), Daniel sees coming upon the clouds of heaven, one like a son of man 
installed the redeemed to kingship, to be priests for God, the Father.  For a good discussion on Rev 
1:4-6, see Fiorenza, Justice, 70-73. 
47 The Greek construction of these terms in Rev 1:6 (   ,   
   ) differs from the LXX of Exod 19:6 (       
 ) and the MT (                             ), all of which differ from the parallel 
reference in Rev 5:10 (        ).  However, the translation 
of all three parallel each other in that [1] God (or Jesus) initiates the formation of the people, [2] into a 
kingdom, [3] which is composed of, characterized as, or manifested through the actions of priests (or 
priesthood).  As a result, in what follows, the phrase kingdom and priests will be used to reference 
the parallel as a whole and yet does not ignore the linguistic nuances of each reference.

Chapter 7 
approaching the Ancient of Days (7:13).  The vision reaches its climax in 7:14 with 
the proclamation of his kingdom: [The one like a son of man] was given dominion 
and glory and sovereignty.  And all peoples, nations and languages glorified him.  
His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not cease, and his kingdom is one 
that will never be destroyed.   
Building on this imagery, Revelation 1 presents Jesus as the one like a son 
of man (Rev 1:13; cf. Dan 7:13) with hair white like wool (Rev 1:14a; cf. Dan 
7:9b) as white as snow (Rev 1:14b; cf. Dan 7:9b) with his eyes like a flame of 
fire (Rev 1:14b; cf. Dan 7:9b).49  Thus, the Danielic images of the Ancient of 
Days and the one like a son of man are blurred together in the disclosure of Jesus 
on Patmos.  These allusions adjoin not just the characters of the two contexts, but 
also the intended actions of the figures: the construction of an alter-empire.   
As Daniel 7:14 depicts the sovereignty of the one like a son of man who 
secures everlasting dominion for his indestructible kingdom, Revelation portrays 
the sovereignty of Jesus attained through the suffering on the cross which created an 
alter-empire.  So Revelation 1:5 connects Jesus authoritative appellation the ruler 
of the kings of the earth with his designation as the faithful witness who was the 
firstborn of the dead.  Similarly, Revelation 1:17b-18 declares Jesus sovereignty 
over death and Hades after the crucifixion summary, I was dead, but look, I am 
alive for ever and ever,50 and Revelation 5:12 pronounces that Jesus is worthy to 
receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and

50 See also Rev 2:8; 3:14. 
Chapter 7 
blessing precisely because he is the Lamb who was slain.51  So, as discussed in 
chapter 6 above, the sovereign power of the rider on the white horse in Revelation 
19:11-21 deliberately rests in the context of his robe dipped in blood (Rev 19:13).  
The sacrifice secures the sovereignty.52  
 In Revelation, the paradoxical sovereignty attained through suffering creates 
an alter-empire.  Parallel to Revelation 1:5b-6, the sacrifice of Jesus creates a 
kingdom and priests in Revelation 5:9-10:  
And they sang a new song, saying: You are worthy to take the scroll and to 
open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased for 
God ones from every tribe and tongue and people and nation [Dan 7:14].  
And you have made them into a kingdom and priests [Exod 19:6] for our 
God, and they will be sovereign on the earth.53 
The sacrifice, then, secures sovereignty and creates an alter-empire.  Even in the new 
heaven and new earth (Rev 21:1), the triad of goods sovereignty is connected to the 
imagery of the sacrificial Lamb of Revelation 5 (Rev 21:27; 22:3), who provides 
(21:22-23; 22:1) and protects (21:1b, 12, 25, 27) for the alter-empire (21:9; 21:14) 
which in turn serves (priests)54 and reigns (kingdom) with the triad of good for ever 
and ever (22:5).  Throughout the entire book, therefore, sovereignty and sacrifice 
converge in Jesus who constructs a kingdom and priests.

53 Commenting on Rev 5:9-10, Thompson, Revelation, 59 concurs, The messianic king 
gains victory through his death, and as a result he redeems and creates from all peoples a new, 
Christian people, an international community of kings and priests (political and religious elements 
combine here also) who will reign upon earth.  See also Thompson, Revelation, 70. 
54 In 22:3, the term for serve is the cultic ritual term . 
Chapter 7 
The Politics of Conquest for the Alter-Empire 
As mentioned above, the Apocalypse describes the followers of each triad in 
imagery that corresponds to the triad to whom they belong.55  So blasphemy and 
deception are as intricate to the followers of the triad of evil as sacrifice and witness 
are to the followers of the triad of good.56  Unsurprisingly, then, Revelation 1:9 
states, I, John, your brother and co-partner in the suffering and kingdom and patient 
endurance in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos due to the word of God and the 
witness of Jesus.57  The kingdom that John espouses reflects suffering and 
patient endurancewhich correspond to the sovereignty of the triad of good 
attained through the sacrifice of Jesusas a part of the call to witness as the Lamb 
witnessed (Rev 1:2, 5).  In other words, in Revelation, Jesus sacrifice (suffering 
and patient endurance) does not just create the existence of the kingdom alone, 
but also the politics of conquest (witness) for the alter-empire. 
 At the core of the alter-empire in the Apocalypse is the motif of conquest.  
As the agents of evil attempt to conquer the agents of good (Rev 6:2; 11:7), the 
churches of Asia Minor are persistently called to conquest with the phrase the one 
conquering ( ).58  Whether rebellious or faithful, all of the churches in Asia 
Minor are addressed in the language of conquest.  So the song of the Lamb (15:3)59 
55 See pp. 269-271 above. 
56 See footnote 31.  See also Thompson, Revelation, 78. 
57 Emphasis added.  See also Rev 20:4-6 where the souls of those who had been beheaded 
because of their witness for Jesus sit in a position of sovereignty on thrones (20:4, 6) and reign 
with Christ. 
58 The phrase   (the one conquering) is used in 2:11, 26; 3:5, 12, 21 and the phrase 
  (to the one conquering) is used in 2:7, 17. 
59 Rev 15:3 also mentions the song of Moses, which includes an allusion to Exod 15:1-
18a passage in the context of conquest.  In this account, due to the parting of the Red Sea, Moses 
and the Israelites marched on the dry ground of the sea in their Exodus from Egypt.  Before the 
conquest of the Egyptian army in Exod 15:19, Moses and the Israelites sang a song of victory in 
Chapter 7 
is sung by the ones conquering the beast (15:2 ) and the one 
conquering (21:7 ) inherits the new heaven and the new earth (21:1).  
Correspondingly, this conquest is both possible and congruent with the depiction of 
Jesus as the Lion of the tribe of Judah (5:5) who conquered (5:5) 
through his sacrifice as the slain Lamb (5:6).60  Indeed, the political end of 
Revelation, linguistically and pictorially, is the kingdom of the world became the 
kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall be sovereign for ever and ever 
(11:15b).61   
With conquest as a central feature of the Apocalypse, the methodological 
question of How does Revelation interact with the empire? may shift to a related 
(but separate) question, How does Revelation call the church to interact with the 
empire?62  This latter question posits the existence of an alter-empire (of sorts) and 
acknowledges the goal of conquest, but the mode or form of the politics embraced 
by the alter-empire in order to attain conquest over evil becomes a key point of 
contention.  More specifically, if an anti-imperial intent of Revelation is assumed, in 
which God is exalted because of his actions of liberation.  Similar to Rev 15:4, Exod 15:11 exclaims, 
Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods?  Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in 
splendor, doing wonders? (NRSV) 
60 See also Rev 17:12-14 where the Lamb will conquer (17:14b) the beast from 
the sea and the ten kings who make war (17:14a). 
61 See also: Rev 1:7; 5:9; 7:9; 14:6 (cf. 11:9; 13:7), 14-20; 18:21-24; 19:11-21; 21:8. 
62 This latter question is prominent in the studies by Brian K. Blount, Can I Get a Witness?:

Apocalypse; Michael J. Gorman, Reading Revelation Responsibly: Uncivil Worship and Witness

Chapter 7 
which Rome is the central target for the conquest, then destructive conclusions 
emerge that present awkward tensions within the text as a whole. 
The anti-imperial assumption63 in Revelation manifests itself in comments 
like, Johns vitriolic attack upon Rome,64 [Johns] fierce anti-Roman stance,65 or 
a purely negative attitude towards [Rome]is put uncompromisingly in the 
apocalypse of John.66  From this vantage point, the purpose of the Apocalypse is 
intricately interwoven into the destruction of the Roman Empire.  As Adela Yarbro 
Collins muses, the overall tone of Revelation suggests that John would rather have 
seen conflict between Rome and Christians intensified than abated.67  Thus, the 
anti-imperial assumption, in which the destruction of Rome is the political end, 
logically concludes that In Johns world, Christians should seek out clashes with the 
state.68  If Rome is the key antagonist, then the politics of conquest necessitates a 
call to violence against Rome or anti-imperial actions that contribute to the empires 
demise, which is the perceived goal of the document.   
Yet Revelation calls the churches to reflect the politics of conquest displayed 
in the triad of good: sacrificial non-violence.  Revelation 1:5 designates Jesus as the

envy, hatred, resentment, vengefulness, and aggression of the weak against the strong.  Its only 
positive function may be that it could serve as a reminder to the privileged that the system which 
benefits them may be causing real hardship to others  [citing Adela Yarbro Collins, Persecution and

Chapter 7 
faithful witness because of his sacrificial death that secures the sovereignty needed 
for conquest (see also Rev 3:14; 19:11).  While this paradoxical sovereignty creates 
an alter-empire, it also redefines the form by which victory is attainedthe 
necessary mode of the alter-empires politics of conquest.  The faithful () 
follower(s) of the triad of good throughout Revelation is the witness () to a 
testimony () interwoven with depictions of his or her own suffering and 
sacrifice.  Thus, John is exiled on the island of Patmos because of the testimony 
() of Jesus (Rev 1:9), and the Christians of Smyrna are exhorted to be 
faithful () until death with the promise of the victors crown of life (2:10).  
The fifth seal in Revelation 6:9 reveals the souls of those having been slain due to 
the testimony () they had retained, which parallels the depiction in 
Revelation 20:4 of the souls of those having been beheaded due to the testimony 
() of Jesus  who are, consequently, reigning on thrones with authority to 
judge.69  Indeed, the only other figure besides Jesus (1:5) labeled faithful witness 
is Antipas from Pergamum (2:13), who was killed among youwhere Satan 
resides. 
 To mirror the triad of goods politics of conquest, then, is to bear witness 
faithfully to the testimony of Jesus that, if necessary, submits to suffering, sacrifice, 
and even death.  In fact, Revelation 13:9-10 blatantly prohibits violent acts by the 
churches when confronted by the triad of evils abrasive politics of conquest: If 
anyone has an ear, let him hear: If anyone is to be taken as a prisoner of war, as a 
prisoner of war he goes off.  If anyone is to be killed by the sword, by the sword he is 
69 See also Rev 11:3, 7, where the two witnesses () are killed by the beast from the 
abyss upon the completion of their testimony (). 
Chapter 7 
to be killed.  This requires patient endurance and faithfulness () from the 
saints.  Shockingly, this call for sacrificial nonviolence is juxtaposed with the 
depiction of the furious dragon waging war against those retaining the testimony 
() of Jesus (12:17) and the great prostitute drunk on the blood of the 
witnesses () of Jesus (17:6).  Within the conquest motif, then, the 
Apocalypse exhorts its audience to mirror the triad of good in the reaction to the 
violent assault of the triad of evil and its followers. 
 The anti-imperial assumption, at this point, creates an awkward tension with 
the sacrificial images and exhortations in Revelation.  Although the nonviolent call is 
widely recognized in Revelation scholarship,70 its existence presents an 
uncomfortable incongruence for the anti-imperial trajectory.  So while Collins says 
that John would rather have seen conflict between Rome and Christians 
intensified,71 she also writes the book of Revelation was written to avoid violence 
rather than to encourage it.  The faithful are called upon to endure, not to take up 
arms.72  Likewise, Kraybill calls Revelation a vitriolic attack upon Rome, and yet 
he also concedes:  
[John] longs for Romes demise, but never issues a call for violent revolution.  
In contrast to the Zealot model of armed resistance, faithful Christians must 
respond with patient endurance rather than violence: If you are to be taken 
captive, into captivity you go; if you kill with the sword, with the sword you 
must be killed (Rev. 13.10).73

Chapter 7 
The anti-imperial assumption about Revelation, then, cannot easily dismiss 
the nonviolent call inherent in the politics of conquest of the triad of good.  If the 
central target of the book of Revelation is the Roman Empire, then the call for 
nonviolence is consigned to either hopeless surrender to the might of Rome (i.e., they 
had no other option) or a dissonant position in a futile attempt of resistance by just 
being different from the violent empire.74   If the central target is Satan, however 
(as the Alter-Imperial interpretation of Revelation 20:7-10 suggests), then the 
exhortation of sacrificial nonviolence becomes the means through which conquest is 
secured.   
Indeed, in Revelation 12, the dragon unsuccessfully launches an assault on 
the newborn male child, who will rule all the nations with an iron rod (12:4b-5) 
and on the angelic army in heaven (12:7-9).  This defeat of the triad of evils chief 
leader is celebrated in 12:10, At this very moment, the salvation and the dominion 
and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ came into existence.  For 
the accuser of our brothers, the one accusing them before our God day and night, was 
thrown down.  In the next verse, the catalyst of this cosmic conquest is revealed: 
They conquered () [Satan] through the blood of the Lamb and through the 
word of their testimony (), for they did not cling to life even in the face of 
death.75  Thus, when the sacrificial death of Jesus is imitated by his followers, the 
key antagonist of Revelation is conquered.  As a result, the nonviolent exhortation is 
an articulation of the politics of conquest of the triad of good through which the 
defeat of Satan is secured and awaits consummation in Gods triumphal procession. 
74 Cf. Friesen, Imperial, 200. 
75 The last phrase for they did not cling to life even in the face of death is the NRSV 
translation of the idiomatic:        . 
Chapter 7 
This Alter-Imperial interpretation brings lucidity not only to the contentious 
call for nonviolence in Revelation, but also to the peculiar possibility, and at times 
depiction, of the repentance of the rebellious agents of evil.  For example, although 
persistently characterized as followers of the triad of evil,76 the kings of the earth 
favorably carry their glory into [the new Jerusalem] in Revelation 21:24.  After 
describing this oddity as more than a little surprising, Steven J. Friesen concludes, 
The literary background and utopian character of Revelation 21 suggest that the 
statement [in Rev 21:24] offers us insight into Johns view of the true goal of earthly 
rulers.77   
Similarly, the false prophetess Jezebel is offered time that she might 
repentfrom her sexual immorality in Revelation 2:21, but she does not want to 
repent.  As a result, she is promised a bed of suffering along with all of the ones 
committing adultery with herunless they repent of her deeds (2:22).  In regards to 
this passage, Leonard L. Thompson remarks that in Revelation, even the most 
blasphemous have the possibility of transformation through repentance and can cross 
the boundary from unfaith to faith.78  So like the rebellious churches of Asia Minor 
(2:5, 16, 21-22; 3:3, 19), the followers of the triad of evil are called to repentance and 
not merely consigned to destruction (9:20, 21; 16:9, 11).   
Once again, the anti-imperial assumption that envisions the church as pitted 
against the empire79 creates an awkward tension in Revelations imagery, given that 
76 Rev 6:15 (cf. 19:18); 16:14; 17:2 (cf. 18:3, 9), 18; 19:19. 
77 Friesen, Imperial, 209. 
78 Thompson, Revelation, 84. 
79 Thompson, Revelation, 192 writes, Here John is unambiguous.  Within his vision of 
reality, he and all those who wear the white garments are pitted against the evil empire. 
Chapter 7 
part of the goal for the triad of good is the repentance of the agents of evil.  As 
Elisabeth Schssler Fiorenza summarizes, Only when we acknowledge that 
Revelation hopes for the conversion of the nations, in response to the Christian 
witness and preaching, will we be able to see that it does not advocate a theology of 
resentment80  The hope for repentance, then, seems to subvert the anti-imperial 
assertion and yet seems perfectly congruent with the alter-empires particular politics 
of conquest.   
The Implications of Revelation 20:7-10 
The goal of Empire Studies is to resurrect the voice of the marginalized, not 
to detect only subversion in a subject text.  It is far different to suggest that a subject 
text uses Roman imperial imagery to construct an Alter-Imperial message than to say 
that the imagery is used with the sole intent of attacking the Roman Empire.  On 
some level, the sovereign narrative dictates the grammar of the marginalized voice.  
Therefore, imperial language in a subject text does not mean the empire is the center 
of the discussion or that the intent is exclusively subversive; instead, the subject 
narratives interaction with the empire may be complicit, subversive, both, or neither. 
In Revelation 20:7-10, the release of Satan for Gods triumphal procession 
functions as a multifaceted clarifying agent for the churches of Asia Minor.  At this 
climactic moment in the Apocalypse, the Roman triumph is a point of conversation 
with the sovereign narrative that provides the grammar of conquest and defeat that 
includes a delay and imminent consummation.  Significantly, Revelation attributes 
the position of the chief enemy leader in the triumphal procession to Satan and not 
80 Elisabeth Schssler Fiorenza, Invitation to the Book of Revelation (Garden City, N.Y.: 
Doubleday, 1981), 119. 
Chapter 7 
Rome.  This application clarifies not only the identity of the subject texts primary 
target, but also the identity of the alter-empire that Jesus sacrifice creates.  
The physical and non-physical persecution of the Domitianic Roman Empire 
generates a discordant conclusion to Revelations proclamation that Jesus is the 
ruler of the kings of the earth (1:5) who creates a kingdom and priests (5:9; cf. 
1:6) to be sovereign on the earth (5:10).  Thus, if the battle is with Rome, then the 
apparent inference is failure for the churchfor if the measure of conquest is 
prosperity, territory, or military victories, then Rome is the clear victor.  Yet, if the 
battle is with the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, then 
conquest is redefined and, indeed, the conclusion is secure: the battle has already 
been won through Christs suffering and sacrifice. 
Thus, Revelations demand for nonviolence and hope for repentance calls the 
church to interact with the empire in a manner that only makes sense if Rome is not 
the primary target.  From the perspective of the prostitute, the alter-empires politics 
of conquest fail.  From the perspective of the cosmic triads, the alter-empires 
politics of conquest secure the victory celebrated in Gods triumphal procession, in 
which Satan, the chief enemy leader, marches bound in chains (Rev 20:7-10).  As 
Friesen notes:  
The demonic pretender to world dominion is worshipped for his ability to 
defeat all opponents [Rev 13:4, 7-8].  The figure who is truly worthy of 
receiving worship and dominion, on the other hand, is described precisely as 
the one who was victimized and defeated [Rev 5:5-6, 9-10, 12].The 
meaning of history is revealed in the one who suffers violence, not in the one 
who inflicts violence.81 
81 Friesen, Imperial, 176. See also Blount, Witness, 69-70, 87. 
Chapter 7 
In other words, the illusion of victory is dissolved when the true enemy is clarified.  
To attack Rome with the weapons of Rome (violence) falls prey to the Satanic 
deception that Rome is the true target.  Satan as the chief enemy leader in Gods 
triumphal procession, then, reorients the churches of Asia Minor to attack the true 
target (the dragon) with the Lambs politics of conquest (Rev 12:11) in a battle that is 
not in jeopardy but merely awaiting consummation. 
This Alter-Imperial perspective allows for complicity with the Roman 
sovereign narrative (Rev 17:18) and simultaneous subversion (17:16-17), alongside 
of a constant call and plea for the churches to witness with the hope of repentance for 
the people of Rome (21:24).  Other times, neither complicity nor subversion are in 
view, for the Apocalypse uses Roman imagery to clarify a cosmic battle that far 
surpasses the empire.  Thus, the implementation of Roman triumphal procession 
imagery in Revelation 20:7-10 does not necessitate an anti-imperial intent.  Instead, 
the Alter-Imperial paradigm reveals that, in Revelation, Rome is just collateral 
damage in the cosmic story that involves not just the destruction of Satan but the 
construction of the alter-empire.   Rome provides the grammar while Eden provides 
the target.   
The Alter-Imperial Paradigm:  
Revelation and Empire Studies 
 To answer the question, How does Revelation interact with the empire? the 
Alter-Imperial paradigm repositions the theoretical background to engage the subject 
text through points of conversation with the Flavian socio-historical context.  
Methodologically, then, the imperial propaganda that communicates the Roman 
sovereign narrative provides the entry point for the subject narratives imagery.  
Chapter 7 
Given the 92-96 C.E. date of the Apocalypse and the centrality of the Roman 
triumph in 71 C.E. for the Flavian foundational myth, triumphal procession imagery 
emerges as a likely candidate for interaction with the subject text.  The parallels 
between Revelation 19:11-20:10 and the Roman triumph bring clarity to a 
notoriously enigmatic text (the release of Satan) and, by implication, to imperial 
imagery and interaction throughout the Apocalypse.   
The Alter-Imperial paradigm, however, does not intend to replace or supplant 
Revelation scholarship over the past 125 years, but integrate the studies into this 
broader approach.  For example, studies on the imperial cult in Revelation82 or the 
Leto-Apollo combat myth in Revelation 1283 are valuable parallels to the Roman 
Empire on their own accord.  Nevertheless, if these points of conversation are 
assimilated into the Alter-Imperial paradigm, sharper insights emerge through 
questions like: How did the imperial cult function in Flavian propaganda?  What role 
did the combat myth play in the inauguration of the Flavian dynasty?  Does Domitian 
use images of Apollo in his unique sovereign narrative?  
In other words, moving from the specific observations (i.e., the imperial cult, 
combat myth genres, etc.) to the broader context (i.e., the Roman sovereign narrative 
in Flavian propaganda) highlights the importance of the specificity of the 
contributions from Friesen, Kraybill, Collins, and others while moving the parallels 
beyond anti-imperial assumptions through further analysis.  Indeed, the points of 
conversation in the subject text must be used to resurrect the marginalized voice 
through questions like: Is the parallel used with the intention to subvert the Empire?  
82 Friesen, Imperial; Kraybill, Imperial. 
83 Collins, Combat Myth. 
Chapter 7 
Or does the imagery support the Empire?  Or is the imagery simply used as grammar 
to make a point that is far larger than the empire?   
This analysis treats the imperial parallel as intentional, but it does not assume 
the intent.  The questions do not assert subversion or complicity, but instead, they 
allow for either or both or neither.  For as Revelation 20:7-10 illustrates, Roman 
imagery may be used in the construction of the alternative empire to engage an 
enemy that is of greater significance in the subject narrative than the empire itself.  
Thus, the empire provides the grammar but is not the primary target. 
In addition, the Alter-Imperial paradigms shift to the broader Roman context 
encourages Revelation scholars to ask different questions and view passages anew.  
For instance, as discussed in the introduction, the Leviathan-Behemoth myth only 
offers an aesthetic explanation for the two beasts in Revelation 13an intentional 
modification of Daniel 7:1-7without substantive elucidation.84  Broadening the 
imperial inquiry through the Alter-Imperial paradigm, a potential point of 
conversation emerges in the question, Does the Remus and Romulus myth (found 
on Flavian coinage)85 offer an explanation for the twin beasts in Revelation 13? 
Similarly, the Alter-Imperial paradigm may help clarify the debate and 
confusion surrounding the referent to the seven kings in Revelation 17:10.  Although 
Revelation scholars argue extensively over which emperors fulfill the seven kings 
parallel,86 in the broader Roman context, the emperors were not the sole rulers that 
surface in the imperial sovereign narrative.  Indeed, the foundational myth of Rome 
84 See pp. 4-6 above. 
85 Vespasian: RIC 70; 194; 204; 228; 241; 442.  Titus: RIC 66.  See also Virgil, Aen. 1.267-
296; Suet., Aug. 7; Dio Cass. 53.16.6-8; and the Ara Pacis Augustae on pp. 297-299 below. 
86 See pp. 145-155 above. 
Chapter 7 
begins with seven kings starting with Romulus and ending with the usurpation of the 
republic-led Senate.  Thus, the Alter-Imperial paradigm asks, Are the seven kings in 
Revelation 17 an allusion to the seven kings of Rome that were replaced with the 
republic (cf. the ten kings in Rev 17:12-14)? 
While other questions could be asked,87 in the Alter-Imperial paradigm, the 
purpose of these potential parallels is not to find new and provocative imperial 
referents to the imagery in Revelation.  Instead, these potential points of 
conversation should be used to observe how the Apocalypse interacts with the 
Roman sovereign narrative in its construction of an alter-empire.  In other words, the 
Alter-Imperial paradigm both encourages and tempers our exploration of the 
question, How does Revelation interact with the empire? 
Still further, the Alter-Imperial paradigm carries implications for Empire 
Studies beyond just the book of Revelation.  It challenges Empire Studies (i.e., Paul, 
Jesus, etc.) to stop assuming anti-imperial intent and to engage in the complexities of 
the subject voice that speaks on its own accord.  The pursuit of strictly anti-Roman 
parallels in the subject text is not a resurrection of the marginalized voice but an 
agenda-driven analysis that dictates the contours of the text.  This approach, 
ironically, subjects the text to the anti-imperial tyranny of the Empire Studies 
interpreter who is forced to ignore or gloss over texts like 1 Peter 2:13-21. 
In contrast, a perspective that suggests that the early Christian community 
was more focused on the construction of an alter-empire than the deconstruction of 
the Roman Empire allows for both Romans 13:1-7 and 1 Thessalonians 5:1-3
87 Such as, Does the temple in heaven with its doors opened in Revelation 15:5 parallel 
the ritual of the temple of Janus in the Roman sovereign narrative?  See pp. 114-116 above. 
Chapter 7 
complicity and subversion.  For as Revelation 20:7-10 shows us, Rome is simply too 
small of a target for the early Christian communities; they envision their battle on a 
far grander stage than what the public transcript could even contain.  Rome is just 
another prostitute in league with the triad of evilfor Satan is the bound enemy 
leader who marches at the climactic moment of Gods triumphal procession, not the 
emperors.  Therefore, to reduce imperial inquiry down to mere subversion is to 
ignore the important nuance and purpose of the subject text: the construction of a 
kingdom that far surpasses the limes of the Roman world.

Static Propaganda: The Ara Pacis Augustae Altar 
 In 13 B.C.E., Augustus returned to Rome from a significant tour in Gaul and 
Spain.  When news reached the city that he was shortly to return, excitement filled 
both the senate and the plebs.  Augustus proudly recounts, When I returned from 
Spain and Gaulafter successful operations in those provinces, the senate voted in 
honour of my return the consecration of an altar to Pax Augusta in the Campus 
Martius, and on this altar it ordered the magistrates and priests and Vestal virgins to 
make annual sacrifice.1  The altar was dedicated on the Campus Martius in 9 
B.C.E.,2 near the Horologium-Solarium, and is referred to in scholarship as: the Ara 
Pacis Augustae.3  In addition to its influence on other structures across the empire,4 
the importance of the Ara Pacis is found in the vivid imagery that canvasses the 
structure and powerfully communicates the Roman Sovereign Narrative.5 
1 Res gest. divi Aug. 12 (Shipley, LCL).  Cf. Dio Cass. 54.25.1-4.  On the date of the Ara 
Pacis, see Salvatore Settis, Die Ara Pacis, in Kaiser Augustus und die verlorene Republik (eds. M. 
Hofter, et al.; Berlin: Zabern, 1988), 401; Paul Rehak, Aeneas or Numa? Rethinking the Meaning of 
the Ara Pacis Augustae, The ABul 83.2 (2001): 190; and Peter J. Holliday, Time, History, and Ritual 
on the Ara Pacis Augustae, ABul 72.4 (1990): 544. 
2 See Ovid, Fast. 1.709-22.  Inez Scott Ryberg, The Procession of the Ara Pacis, MAAR 19 
(1949):  84 attempts to fix the date of the dedication to July 4, 13 B.C.E. instead of January 30, 9 
B.C.E. due to the fact that Agrippa, depicted in the procession on the Ara Pacis, was dead in 12 B.C.E.  
Unconvinced, most scholars opt for the traditional date of the dedication and explain the procession as 
more of an idealized picture rather than an actual historical event, so J.M.C. Toynbee, The Ara 
Pacis Augustae, JRS 51 (1961): 155; A.H. Borbein, Die Ara Pacis Augustae: Geschichtliche 
Wirklichkeit und Programm, JdI 90 (1975): 242-266; and John Bertrand Lott, An Augustan

Kaiserzeit, in Miscellanea Capitolina (Instituto Archaeologico centum semestria feliciter peracta 
gratulantur Iuvenes Capitolini, 1879), 11-16 is credited as the first to call the altar by this name.  See 
Stefan Weinstock, Pax and the Ara Pacis, JRS 50 (1960): 44 who does not believe that the altar 
examined below is actually the Ara Pacis mentioned in Res gest. divi Aug. 12, and see Toynbee, 
Augustae, 153 for a response to this skepticism.

discussion, see Nancy Thomson de Grummond, Pax Augusta and the Horae on the Ara Pacis

Appendix D 
 As you approach the front of the altar, the foundation myths of Rome 
combine to invite the viewer to further investigate the vivid imagery as they frame 
the open door at the top of the stairs that leads to the place of sacrifice.  On the top 
left panel, although badly damaged, Mars and Faustulus, the father and adopted 
father respectively, stand over the she-wolf suckling the twin baby boys, Remus and 
Romulus, the latter of which will found the city of Rome and become its first king.6  
On the top right panel, Aeneas, the mythic Trojan ancestor of the Romans and 
Augustus,7 is shown offering sacrifices to the Penates after landing in Latium. 
Fig. 1: Front of the Ara Pacis.8 
 This is not the first time, however, that these two mythic figures have been 
brought together in imperial propaganda to serve the Roman Sovereign Narrative.  In 
Geschichte 43 (1994): 128 even suggests that the Ara Pacis was still intact in the middle of the fourth 
century C.E., although this is speculative. 
6 For a thorough investigation of the various accounts of this myth, see T.P. Wiseman, 
Remus: A Roman Myth (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995).

fact, in Virgils Aeneid, just before Jupiter decrees Rome an empire without end 
(1.278), the god of the sky traces the lineage of Aeneas: 
[Aeneas] shall wage a great war in Italy, shall crush proud nations, and for 
his people shall set up laws and city walls, till the third summer has seen him 
reigning in Latium and three winters have passed in camp since the Rutulians 
were laid low. But the lad Ascanius, now surnamed Iulusshall fulfill in 
empire thirty great circles of rolling monthsthen for thrice a hundred years 
unbroken shall the kingdom endure under Hectors race, until Ilia, a royal 
priestess, shall bear to Mars her twin offspring. Then Romulus, proud in the 
tawny hide of the she-wolf, his nurse, shall take up the line, and found the 
walls of Mars and call the people Romans after his own name. (1.255-277) 
In the Aeneid (1.278-296) as well as in the Ara Pacis, the fulfillment of these 
foundation myths comes to fruition in the reign of Augustus.  As the altar propagates, 
the dominance of Rome that would lead to the cessation of war and unfettered peace 
that Aeneas and Romulus could only look forward to was now present in 
Augustus9a reality that was secured by the gods and therefore deserving of 
worship through sacrifices on an altar.10 
9 Virgil, Aen. 1.278-296 (Fairclough, LCL). 
10 Rehak, Aeneas,196 argues that the top right panel does not depict Aeneas but Numa 
Pompilius, the second king of Rome after Romulus.  Although this suggestion has not been widely 
embraced by scholarship, the implications of this shift would still support the overall Sovereign 
Narrative argued in this chapter, in that the reign of Numa Pompilius is connected to the establishment 
of peace, which is cause for worship and sacrifice to the gods. 
Fig. 2: Back of the Ara Pacis. 
Appendix D 
A similar emphasis is found on the back panel of the altar through the 
portrayal of two mythic women.11  Although badly damaged, the top right panel is 
reconstructed to display the goddess Roma seated on a pile of weapons, which 
displays dominance in foreign conquest.

 The identity of the woman in the center of the top left panel is the subject of 
wide debate, with a multitude of identities suggested: Tellus,14 Italia,15 Venus,16 
Ceres,17 Pax,18 or a combination of multiple identities.19  Regardless of which option 
is chosen, scholars agree that this scene depicts blessings of peace.  The presence of 
fruits and grains,20 the sheep and cow,21 the two children on her lap,22 the two 
creature-riding attendants,23 and even the rocky throne upon which she is seated24 
causes the debating scholars to agree on one key point: the panel communicates 
universal Pax.25  As Karl Galinsky concludes, whether Tellus, Venus, Pax, or

19 Galinsky, Polysemy, 457 is the primary architect of this position, which he refers to as 
the polysemous interpretation.  In explanation, Galinsky, Polysemy, 457 writes: The 
intentionally multiple iconography of the Tellus relief on the Ara Pacis Augustae deliberately was 
designed to create multiple meanings and associations. The guiding idea was to represent the concept 
of the Pax Augusta not simply, such as by means of one image, but by evoking the richness of its 
ramifications.  Others that emphasize different combinations of identities, although sometimes with a 
caveat of a primary referent, include: Mark D. Fullerton, The Domus Augusti in Imperial 
Iconography of 13-12 B.C., AJA 89.3 (1985): 481; Krister Hannell, Das Opfer des Augustus an der

25 Arguing for the identity of the woman as Tellus, Holliday, Time, 550 concludes, 
the Tellus panel describes the pax terra marique parta established through the efforts of the Julian 
Appendix D 
Ceres, the deity and her companion figures personify the abundance of vegetation 
and the blessings of peace on land and sea.26 
 When viewed in concert, the two women on the back of the altar sing the 
song of Romes history that acclaims a universal peace achieved through war.  The 
celebration of conquest on the panel with Roma perched on the pile of weapons 
complements the approbation of Pax on the panel with the mysterious woman 
surrounded with images of blessing.  In other words, the Roman Empire is the ruler 
of the kings of the earth, because they are favored by the gods, which is evident in 
that Pax canvasses the world. 
 On all four sides of the altar, the bottom half is covered with seemingly 
innocuous vegetation.  Upon closer examination, however, the choice of this 
overflowing floral scroll offers another voice to the images on this altar saturated in 
the Roman Sovereign Narrative.   
Fig. 5: Close up on the floral scroll found on all four sides of the altar.27 
line.  Arguing for Ceres, Spaeth, Goddess, 92 concludes, The figure of Ceres on the Ara Pacis 
therefore helps to reinforce the political message of the altar, that the princeps Augustus provides the 
blessings of peace to Rome and her citizens. Arguing for a multivalent interpretation, Toynbee, 
Augustae, 154-155 concludes, But the composition in which they are combined here most aptly 
expresses that picture of Golden Age bounteous Nature and rural prosperity which is the setting of 
the Pax Augusta in some Augustan poetry. 
26 Galinsky, Polysemy, 472.

Fig.6: Front of the altar with vegetal scroll observable down the side of the altar.28 
The significance of this pattern is found in its peculiarities.  Scholars point out the 
oddity of the same vine on the altar producing flowers and grapes, the presence of 
plants from differing seasons, and even the company of both wild and cultivated 
vegetation on this flowing floral scroll.29  It is almost as if the vegetation on the Ara 
Pacis is so eager to produce in abundance that it violates the laws of nature.30  This 
oddity, however, fits nicely into the Sovereign Narrative when the words of Tibullus 
(55 B.C.E.-19 B.C.E.) are taken into account:  
Meanwhile let Peace tend our fields. Bright Peace first led under the curved 
yoke the cows about to plow the fields; Peace nourished the vine plants and 
stored the grape juice so that pure wine might flow for the son from the 
father's jar. In peace shine the hoe and plowshare, but decay masters the sad 
arms of  the  harsh soldier in the darkness.Then come to us, nourishing 
Peace, and hold the wheat stalk in your hand, and let fruits pour out in front 
of your shining breast.31

This picture of peace depicted in the vegetation is complete when it is noted that 
above the floral scroll on the two side panels is a procession of multiple figures, 
which includes: Gaius and Lucius Caesar (heirs to the Augustan throne), their father 
Agrippa, and Augustus himself.32  The implication is that the abundance of 
vegetation that bursts forth due to the universal and timeless peace on the bottom 
panel is due to the accomplishments of the figures on the top panelabove all, 
Augustus.33

Zanker, Power, 217-218.  Charles Brian Rose, Princes and Barbarians on the Ara Pacis, AJA 94.3 
(1990): 455, however, argues forcefully that the identity of the two boys do not correlate to Gaius and 
Lucius, but instead are barbarian children due to their clothes, headwear, shoes, necklace, and 
hairstyle.  Similarly, Diana E.E. Kleiner and Bridget Buxton, Pledges of Empire: The Ara Pacis and 
the Donations of Rome, AJA 112.1 (2008): 59 argues that the boys are specifically barbarian 
pignora, or pledges of empire.  Even with this barbarian conclusion, however, both authors affirm 
the overall Sovereign Narrative of the Ara Pacis communicated in this chapter.  Rose, Princes, 461 
states the presence of the barbarian boys indicated that peace with these regions had finally been 
achieved through the efforts of Augustus and Agrippa, and Kleiner and Buxton, Pledges, 57 
concludes, The Ara Pacis features child pledges connoting the three continents, and, along with their 
Roman peers, advertises Augustus claim to be world conqueror. 
33 Galinsky, Polysemy, 465 notes amidst the vegetation of the Ara Pacis a scorpion in one 
section and a snake attacking a birds nest in another, which he suggests indicates unremitting 
work against harmful obstacles in the Virgilian articulation of the Golden Age.

Appendix D 
 The Ara Pacis Augustae utilizes easily recognizable images and allusions 
from the Roman Sovereign Narrative to communicate to the educated and 
uneducated alike that the favor of the gods blesses the Roman world with abundant 
peace through the victories of Augustus.  Also, scholars point out that the location of 
the Ara Pacis Augustae next to the Horologium-Solariuman obelisk, dedicated in 
10 B.C.E., acquired in the defeat of Egypt that functions as a giant sundial
strengthens the connection among Augustus, Roman Dominance, and universal 
Pax.35  On Augustuss birthday (September 23), the shadow cast by the obelisk 
pointed to the Ara Pacis Augustae altar, the significance of which Peter J. Holliday 
comments, a monument commemorating an Augustan military victory was 
associated with a monument commemorating the Augustan peace in a very personal 
way.36 
 Still further, it would be remiss to view the Ara Pacis as merely a piece of 
static propaganda divorced from its enacted functionfor every year, the ceremonial 
sacrifice pledged on the altar invited the viewer not only to witness the Sovereign 
Narrative but to participate in it.37  As John Elsner explains:  
There is a reciprocal relation of art-object and viewer, viewer and art-object, 
that creates a dialogue out of which meaning is born. In looking at the altar, 
Roman viewers did not simply see images of a sacrifice that once happened.  
They saw a cultural process in which they themselves became involved.In 
ritual action (which is always process, a dynamic that leads to and beyond the 
act of sacrifice), the altar relief is static: not only as a particular furnishing 
and stage of ritual action but also as a representation of a single frozen 
moment (even if that moment is in fact a symbolic conflation of actual 
moments).  The altar relief engages in a play with the viewer as he

participates in the ritual; it constantly summarizes and conflates a 
multifaceted diachronic rite in a synchronic and schematic space.38 
The Ara Pacis Augustae, then, functions as a collision of both static and enacted 
propaganda that melds the three key messages of the Roman Sovereign Narrative 
into one fluid experience.  For the images, the location, and the ritual sacrifice of the 
Ara Pacis invite the viewer to partake in a world in which the Roman Empire is the 
ruler of the kings of the earth because they are favored by the gods, which is evident 
by the blessings of the universal Pax enjoyed under the reign of Augustus.39

Saturn.
