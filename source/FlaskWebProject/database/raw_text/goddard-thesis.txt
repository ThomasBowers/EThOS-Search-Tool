The animation presented in the bottom right corner of odd page numbers from 1-145
corresponds to particle density slices of a deformation induced fission process, starting from
an initial state with 20 = 1.19. The time interval is 12.5 fm/c.
On the bottom left corner of even page numbers from 146-2, the animation corresponds
to particle density slices of a boost induced fission process, starting from an initial state with
20 = 0.89. The boost provides 225 MeV of collective energy instantaneously in the form of a
quadrupole excitation. The time interval is 25 fm/c. In both cases, the isolines are separated
by 0.05 particles/fm3.
Abstract
This thesis is concerned with the application of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock method,
adopting the Skyrme effective nuclear interaction, to investigate induced nuclear fission
processes. Three-dimensional, symmetry-unrestricted constrained Hartree-Fock calcula-
tions of 240Pu are presented to obtain the static potential energy surface corresponding
to an increasing quadrupole deformation. The time-dependent Hartree-Fock method
is applied to evolve in time these deformed states. Different types of fission process
are considered. Firstly, the evolution of static configurations which are deformed suf-
ficiently such that they fission upon time evolution, without any external excitation,
(deformation-induced fission) is investigated. The fragments smoothly form during a
gradual evolution of the static state (taking up to  1500 fm/c for scission to occur),
and the resulting fission products agree well with experimental neutron-induced fission
data. The kinetic energy released in the process is also shown to compare well to ex-
perimental results. Secondly, the effect of providing an external excitation field to static
configurations which would not otherwise fission (boost-induced fission) is investigated.
Upon application of an instantaneous excitation, the evolution of the densities displays a
violent oscillatory behaviour as the state evolves to fission, in contrast what was seen for
the case of deformation-induced fission. The resulting fission products lie at the edges
of typical mass distributions obtained from experiment. The evolution of the densities
following the application of a gradual excitation field demonstrates behaviour similar
to deformation-induced fission, suggesting that the timescale for the energy deposition
has consequences regarding the fission dynamics. The comparison to experimental results
following the application of a gradual excitations field is improved compared to an instan-
taneous excitation. Overall, the results provide a significant exploratory investigation of
fission treated as a dynamic process, and suggest that the time-dependent Hartree-Fock
method has potential to be applied further to describe the dynamics of nuclear fission.

Introduction
Theoretical nuclear structure physics is concerned with describing the properties of the many-
body microscopic system of fermions known as the atomic nucleus. The nucleus is a complex,
self-interacting (correlated) system comprised of positively-charged protons and uncharged
neutrons, bound together by the nuclear strong interaction. Chemical elements are defined
by their atomic number, Z, which corresponds to the number of protons in the nucleus, and
for each element there can exist isotopes with varying numbers of neutrons, characterised by
the neutron number N . The atomic mass of the nucleus A is simply the sum N + Z.
There exist in the region of 300 stable isotopes which are found naturally on Earth; for
light nuclei these are typically found in isotopes with Z  N , but as the nuclear systems
grow heavier, stable isotopes typically have an abundance of neutrons. This is because the
Coulomb interaction between protons is repulsive, so that proton-rich systems tend to be
unstable. Observation of isotopes away from the region of stability is an ongoing area of
research [1]. Knowledge of the properties of unstable nuclei allows physicists to test their
understanding of nuclear synthesis and astrophysical processes, and further to verify the
understanding of the behaviour of nuclear systems by providing experimental observations to
compare to theories. Over 3000 isotopes have been experimentally observed, from Z = 1 to
118 [2].
Stable and unstable isotopes may be synthesised in the laboratory using techniques rang-
ing from nucleon capture and stripping and transfer reactions at low and intermediate energies
[3, 4], to extreme processes at high energies such as spallation and fragmentation [5, 6]. Mod-
ern radioactive beam facilities have opened up a new region of discovery for unstable isotopes
[7], and results from future studies will provide key to verifying predictions made by theo-
1. INTRODUCTION
retical models employed to describe the structure of nuclei. As many as 6000 isotopes have
been predicted to exist [8].
For those unstable isotopes, a transition into a stable configuration will occur by under-
going one or more decay process. These transitions can be as simple as an excited state (an
isomer) losing energy by the emission of a photon (-decay), and therefore the isotope will
keep its identity following the process. Other decays include the emission of an -particle, or
processes such as + or  decay [3, 4]. Following decays of these types, the initial isotope will
transition to a neighbouring configuration defined by a new N and Z. The aforementioned
processes are well known, but not an exhaustive list of decay mechanisms. For example,
exotic  decay processes are predicted to occur; neutrinoless double-beta decay is a topic of
interest in modern nuclear physics [9].
Nuclear fission (see [4, 10, 11] for general introductory discussions and reviews) presents
itself as perhaps the most dramatic decay process, where it becomes energetically favourable
for the nucleus to split into two fragments. The mass difference between the parent nucleus
and daughter nuclei is distributed between the daughters, mainly in the form of translational
kinetic energy. The process can occur spontaneously in some cases [12, 13], and may be in-
duced using a multitude of processes, typically through the absorption of particles or photons
[11].
Harnessing the energy released in fission reactions is routinely performed in nuclear reac-
tors for energy production. However, it is the application of fission in weaponry which has
spurred intense research into the process since its discovery. The social and political implica-
tions of nuclear weaponry has ensured the profound impact that the discovery of fission has
had upon modern history [14].
1.1 A Brief Account of the Experimental Discovery and The-
oretical Descriptions of Nuclear Fission
Research led by Fermi in 1934 [15] demonstrated that following the capture of thermal neu-
trons by heavy elements, new radioactive isotopes could be formed. Fermis initial interpre-
tation of the decays of these isotopes was through chains of  and  decays. Pursuing these
investigations, in 1938 Hahn and Strassmann identified decay products of medium charges
(which we know today to be fission products). Following communication with one of Hahns

Descriptions of Nuclear Fission
collaborators, Meitner, Hahn and Strassmann published their results in 1939 [16]. The nu-
clear reaction was named fission by Meitner and Frisch, based on the namesake process
in cell biology. Meitner and Frisch described nuclear fission in terms of an incompressible
charged liquid drop model (LDM), which demonstrated the nucleus splitting into two when
subjected to extreme deformation. Following the publication by Meitner and Frisch [17],
the basic theoretical understanding of nuclear fission was rapidly established. It was veri-
fied independently that a charged droplet becomes unstable to fission when the ratio of the
Coulomb energy to twice the surface energy exceeds unity [18, 19]. The seminal paper by
Bohr and Wheeler [20] established the concept of the surface energy in terms of deformation
parameters.
Calculating the potential energy of a charged liquid drop as a function of increasing
elongation (and therefore deformation) introduced the concepts of the potential energy surface
(PES) and the fission barrier, shown in Fig. 1.1. For the PES corresponding to the liquid
drop model (labelled LDM in the Figure), there exists a potential barrier of height Ebarrier.
Energy must be added to the system to overcome the barrier, thus allowing the nucleus to
fission (the so-called activation energy [4]). Bohr and Wheeler presented calculations of the
energy required to produce a critical deformation in their 1939 paper [20], and thus estimated
fission barrier heights for various actinide nuclei.
The LDM provided an adequate explanation of the mechanism of the fission process,
enough such that nuclear weaponry could be developed during the course of the 1940s. How-
ever, the liquid drop model was lacking with respect to several factors [21]. Firstly, the
resulting fission fragments are always symmetric; nuclei often fission into asymmetric frag-
ments. Additionally, the LDM lacks the inclusion of quantum mechanical ingredients, which
are often essential to accurately describe nuclear structure effects.
It wasnt until the late 1950s-1960s that a renaissance in the calculation of fission barriers
began. In 1955, Swiatecki proposed a shell correction to be included in the LDM calcula-
tions [22], based upon the difference between LDM calculated masses and experimentally
observed ground state masses. This allowed a more accurate calculation of experimentally
observed spontaneous fission half-lives, based upon calculating the transmission of a quantum
mechanical wave function through a potential barrier.

Figure 1.1: Illustration displaying the form of potential energy surfaces as a function of increas-
ing elongation. The Liquid Drop Model (LDM) displays a single potential barrier. Bohr and
Mottleson reasoned that if enough energy was applied so that the nucleus may become critically
deformed beyond the peak of the barrier, fission may occur. Experimental results obtained in
later years suggested that a double-humped barrier exists for actinide and heavy nuclei. Micro-
scopic shell corrections allow the LDM to possess this structure, displaying a prominent isomeric
state (IS) as well as the ground state (GS). See text for further discussion.
Perhaps the most significant breakthrough was in the mid-1960s when Strutinksky pro-
posed a method to calculate the shell correction as a function of increasing deformation
[23, 24]. This began the era of macroscopic-microscopic calculations, where some quantum-
mechanical shell effects were incorporated into the LDM calculations, and produced double-
humped potential surfaces for actinide and heavy nuclei (see Fig. 1.1, PES labelled LDM+Shell
Correction). These demonstrate two fission barriers beyond the global minimum of the PES
(the ground state), and a prominent local minimum, which corresponds to a long-lived fis-
sion isomer. Experimental evidence had been obtained to verify this structure [25, 26]. For
example, the excitation spectra and lifetimes of isomeric states could be measured [27]. Fur-
ther, without the multiple barriers in the PES, theoretical calculation of spontaneous fission
half-lives for heavy nuclei yielded values which were far too short.
As early as the 1970s Mller and Nix began pursuing a more thorough investigation of the
PES by calculating the energies of hundreds of nuclear shapes with more complex deforma-
tions within the macroscopic-microscopic approach [28, 29]. The most modern calculations
published by Mller determine the potential energies of millions of configurations using a five-
dimensional parameterisation. Fission pathways are determined by analysing the topography

of the multi-dimensional PES [30, 31, 32, 33].
Parallel to the development of the macroscopic (and macroscopic-microscopic) approach
for describing the properties of the atomic nucleus, with advances in computational abilities
the treatment of the nucleus as a many-bodied quantum-mechanical system became possible.
In the early 1970s Vautherin and Brink demonstrated that the Hartree-Fock method could
be applied (with considerable success) to describe ground-state properties of nuclei when
adopting an effective nucleon-nucleon interaction [34]. This method, analogous to the Kohn-
Sham Density Functional Theory (DFT) [35, 36] allows the nucleus to be described using the
concept of a mean-field. Each nucleon in the system interacts with the averaged effect of
all the other nucleons, and this average mean-field is in turn determined by the presence of
the nucleon, which leads to a self-consistent problem.
In contrast to this approach, the most fundamental modern models for describing proper-
ties of nuclear structure are ab initio techniques, which adopt a bare nuclear interaction [37].
Modern calculations include up to four-body interaction terms [38]. The form of the nuclear
interaction is a key ingredient to many-body nuclear theory (and is not considered at all
in purely macroscopic calculations). As early as 1935, Yukawa presented the concept of the
bare nucleon-nucleon force being mediated by pion exchange [39]. In the 1980s and 1990s, the
concepts of Quantum Chromodynamics and Effective Field Theory developed significantly,
allowing a fundamental description of the nucleon-nucleon interaction [40].
Ab initio methods adopting bare nuclear interactions are limited to describing nuclei of
light masses; perhaps the most advanced calculations are breaking into the A=50-100 mass
regions [41]. For studies of nuclear fission, where actinide nuclei are typically of interest
(Z=89-103), the application of an ab initio approach is unfeasible at present.
In contrast, mean-field calculations assuming effective interactions allow access to the
entire nuclear chart [8]. Effective nuclear interactions are fitted phenomenologically to exper-
imental data, and have been proven to be remarkably successful when adopted in Hartree-
Fock calculations [21, 42]. The zero-ranged Skyrme effective interaction [43] has been used
extensively in Hartree-Fock calculations since the work of Vautherin and Brink. Finite-range
interactions, such as the Gogny interaction [44], are also frequently used.
The Hartree-Fock method using the Skyrme effective interaction has been applied to
calculate fission barriers as early as 1973, where constrained Hartree-Fock calculations were
1. INTRODUCTION
performed by Flocard et. al [45, 46] to determine the minimum energy configuration of nuclei
subject to a fixed quadrupole deformation. The double-humped structure of the PES was
obtained. This result was remarkable, considering that other than the choice of the Skyrme
interaction, the structure was obtained without the inclusion of any other corrections or
additional parameters. This confirmed that within such a framework, the shell effects needed
to describe the structure of the fission barriers are intrinsically included.
The early calculations performed by Flocard included symmetry restrictions due to the
limitations of computational ability. Modern Hartree-Fock solvers are capable of performing
symmetry-unrestricted calculations, and have also increased the number of constraints to
investigate a higher dimensional PES [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]. Typically the octupole defor-
mation is constrained simultaneously with the quadrupole deformation, so that the effects of
mass asymmetry may be investigated.
Advances in the description of fission barriers has been impressive over the past 40-50
years, both from the perspective of the shell-corrected liquid-drop model and constrained
Hartree-Fock. However, both approaches are lacking in the description of nuclear fission as
a dynamic process. Using these models, fission is essentially analysed by calculating a series
of static configurations to determine the optimum path from the ground state to fission,
essentially describing an adiabatic process. This adiabatic assumption may be valid as a
nuclear state gradually transitions towards a fissioned configuration, but around the point
of scission the dynamics become non-adiabatic as the neck breaks and the fragments rapidly
accelerate away from one another due to the Coulomb interaction [53].
The time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method has been applied to describe the non-
adiabatic dynamics of nuclear fission since the late 1970s. The method allows static Hartree-
Fock states to be time-evolved within a microscopic framework. Negele et al. published one
of the best known early applications of the method to nuclear fission in 1978 [54]. They
analysed the dynamics of 236U, initialising their calculations from quadrupole-constrained
static configurations either side of the peak of the second static fission barrier. Due to com-
putational limitations, axial and reflection symmetry was assumed, and a simplified nuclear
interaction was applied with no spin-orbit force. Time-dependent pairing was included in or-
der to break the symmetries of the system to allow fission. A number of fission configurations
were found when evolving the initial state with various pairing strengths. The authors con-

cluded that symmetry unrestricted calculations and the inclusion of a spin-orbit interaction
were necessary to further investigate the dynamics of fission.
During the 1980s, several other investigations were published. For example, the work
of Okoowicz et al. [55] in 1983. The approach of Ockoowicz was to apply a quadrupole
excitation to a nuclear state either side of the second static fission barrier. The static states
were created using either a single-centred or two-centred trial wave function. Pairing was not
included in the calculations, and once again axial symmetry was imposed and no spin-orbit
force included. The authors demonstrated that fission could be induced in axially symmetric
calculations with the absence of a pairing force to break symmetries. They found applying a
quadrupole excitation (or boosting) allowed the static configurations built from two-centred
trial wave functions to fission. Those built from single-centred trial wave functions, how-
ever, failed to fission. They concluded that different angular momentum boosts should be
explored in future work, suggesting that quadrupole shape deformations may not be the most
appropriate degree of freedom to invoke for inducing fission dynamics.
Jung et al. [56] published work in 1988 investigating the effect of inducing fission either
by instantaneously changing the ground state density, or applying a boost. In addition
to quadrupole boosts, they investigated excitations with more exotic spatial profiles in an
attempt to describe multi-fragmentation and single fragment emission, as well as fission.
Their brief results presented for fission also investigated the the effect of bisecting the nucleus
with a plane of zero density, and they established a limiting value of separation where the
Coulomb repulsion would drive the two halves of the nucleus apart.
Application of TDHF for the investigation of fission all but stopped for several decades,
presumably due to the symmetry restrictions imposed when performing the calculations.
With advances in computation power, a new generation of three-dimensional, symmetry
unrestricted TDHF codes has been developed (e.g. [57, 58, 59]). In 2010 Umar et al. [60]
investigated fusion-fission of 240Pu by colliding 100Zr and 140Xe, and then fissioning the
composite system by applying velocity boosts. By performing density-constrained TDHF
calculations of the fissioning nuclei, the potential barriers of the system could be investigated.
In 2014, Umar and Simenel [53] applied TDHF to investigate the formation and dynamics
of fission fragments in the symmetric fission of 264Fm during the non-adiabatic stages of the
fission process.
1. INTRODUCTION
Few studies have been performed using modern TDHF solvers, and it is timely for these
exploratory investigations to be expanded to determine the suitably of TDHF to investigate
the dynamics of fission. A realistic description of fission as a dynamic process will com-
plement and expand upon previous theoretical attempts to describe the process with static
calculations, as done during the course of the past 80 years.
1.2 Scope of this Thesis
After appropriate modification to investigate the physics of interest, the Hartree-Fock and
time-dependent Hartree-Fock solver Sky3D [57] will be applied to study the dynamic prop-
erties of nuclear fission. Chapter 2 will summarise the Hartree-Fock and time-dependent
Hartree-Fock methods, adopting the Skyrme effective nuclear interaction.
The fission properties of the actinide nucleus 240Pu will be investigated, as this isotope is
often used for benchmark calculations within the mean-field approximation [61]. The func-
tionality to perform constrained static Hartree-Fock calculations will firstly be incorporated
into Sky3D, so that the static PES corresponding to the quadrupole degree of freedom may
be obtained. The results of the constrained Hartree-Fock calculations will be presented in
Chapter 3, and the configurations obtained may then be used as starting points for time
evolution.
Two types of dynamic fission process will be investigated using TDHF. In Chapter 4,
deformation-induced fission will be presented. For this process, the initial states are those
static configurations which are deformed sufficiently so that upon time evolution a fissioned
configuration will be reached.
Chapter 5 will explore boost-induced fission, where a quadrupole excitation field either
with an instantaneous or Gaussian temporal profile will be applied. The states to be investi-
gated are those which are not deformed sufficiently to undergo deformation-induced fission.
The results presented in this thesis, and an outlook for future work, will be summarised in
Chapter 6.
Applications of Many-Body Theory to
a Nuclear System
2.1 Microscopic Many-Body Systems
Non-relativistic microscopic many-bodied systems are described by the Schrdinger equation,
H = E , (2.1)
where H is the Hamiltonian operator,  the many-body wave function, and E is the energy.
The many-body wave functions which are solutions to the Schrdinger equation contain the
ground state and excitation spectrum of the system. A general Hamiltonian describing a
nuclear system, H, consists of a one-body kinetic energy operator and an operator describ-
ing the nucleon-nucleon interaction. This term describes two-body, three-body, ..., N -body
interactions. In practice, however, this contribution is often truncated at the level of two-
body interactions due to the technical difficulty of solving the equations. Even effective field
theories, which present themselves as cutting edge techniques capable of describing realistic
interactions in a nuclear system, are limited to 4-body interactions [38].
Few cases exist where the exact many-body description of a nuclear system is known [62].
In general, simplifications are required to create tractable problems. These typically include
restricting the Hilbert space of the many-body wave function, and making approximations in
the form of the nucleon-nucleon interaction.
2. APPLICATIONS OF MANY-BODY THEORY TO A NUCLEAR
SYSTEM
2.1.1 The Many-Body Wave Function and Slater Determinants
The many-body wave function is a mathematical construct postulated to describe all the avail-
able information of a microscopic quantum system. Within a quantum mechanical description
of a nuclear system governed by the Schrdinger equation, one must adopt a many-body wave
function describing an N -particle system
 = (r1, ..., rN ) . (2.2)
The co-ordinate r is chosen to represent the space, spin and isospin degrees of freedom (r, , q)
for each particle, such that 
dr . (2.3)
In this thesis, the nuclear wave function will be written as (r), with the spin and isospin
degrees of freedom left implicit for brevity.
The simplest way to build an antisymmetric many-body wave function out of N single-
particle states, i, with i = 1, ..., N , is a Slater determinant

(r1) . . . 1(rN )
. . .
(r1) . . . N (rN )
 . (2.4)
The consequence of the wave function being anti-symmetric is that the Pauli principle is
enforced, which is a fundamental necessity for a system of indistinguishable fermions. The
Slater determinant is convenient for expressing a many-body wave function, however it is
not the most general form. At the price of allowing feasible calculations, the description of
particle-particle correlations within the system is sacrificed (other than those intrinsically
defined by the Pauli principle). In the context of this thesis, the most important correlation
that needs to be explicitly accounted for is the short-range pairing interaction, which will be
discussed in Sec. 2.5.1.
2.2 The Hartree-Fock Method
The Hartree-Fock approximation is used to describe a many-body system of fermions in
terms of an effective single-particle problem. A starting point is to consider a non-relativistic
Hamiltonian which contains only one-body kinetic terms and a two-body nucleon-nucleon
2.2 The Hartree-Fock Method
interaction v:
i,j=1
i 6=j
vij . (2.5)
An effective nucleon-nucleon interaction is usually used in Hartree-Fock calculations [21,
42].The Skyrme effective interaction is a popular choice, and will be discussed in Sec. 2.3.
The aim of the Hartree-Fock method is to approximate the two-body Hamiltonian oper-
ator as an effective single-particle potential. The many-body wave function that is a solution
to the eigenvalue equation,
H = EHF , (2.6)
is a Slater determinant. The energy EHF is the Hartree-Fock energy, which is an approx-
imation of the exact energy E. The single-particle wave functions i, with corresponding
eigenvalues i, can be expressed by
hi(r) = ii(r) , (2.7)
where the effective single-particle Hamiltonian is given by
2i + v
. (2.8)
The operator vHF acts as an effective single-particle potential. This Hartree-Fock potential,
and therefore the Hartree-Fock energy, can be recovered by minimising the expectation value
of the two-body Hamiltonian. This is analogous to the Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory
(DFT) [35, 36], with the philosophical difference that in DFT, only the densities have physical
significance, and the wave functions are auxiliary objects. In DFT, the existence of an energy
density functional is postulated in its most general form. An energy functional is provided and
minimised to determine the ground state. From the Hartree-Fock perspective, the nucleon-
nucleon interaction is provided, and the energy density functional is determined by minimising
the energy of the system.
2.2.1 The Ritz Variational Principle
The energy functional for a system in a state  can be expressed by
E[] 
|H|
|
. (2.9)
2. APPLICATIONS OF MANY-BODY THEORY TO A NUCLEAR
SYSTEM
The Ritz variational principle is an important concept for variational calculations, which
can be applied to quantum many-body theory. It states that the many-body wave function 
that makes the energy functional E[] stationary, where  is allowed to vary over the whole
Hilbert space, is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian H belonging to the eigenvalue E [63]. It
is this variational principle which can be used to derive the Hartree-Fock equation.
The Ritz variational principle may be demonstrated by considering an infinitesimal vari-
ation of . The corresponding variation of the functional is given by
E[]
 |H| 
 | 
 |H  E| 
 | 
. (2.10)
Assuming the variation of E[] vanishes for an infinitesimal variation , the relation
 |H  E|  = 0 (2.11)
is recovered. If this relationship is satisfied for an arbitrary variation (that is, considering
an unrestricted wave function), then the Schrdinger equation H|  = E|  is recovered
[21, 63]. If the variation in Eq. (2.10) was taken with respect to  rather than , the
Hermitian conjugate of the Schrdinger equation would be recovered.
The variational principle has powerful implications. The eigenfunctions which satisfy the
variational principle correspond to the lowest energy many-body state within the restricted
space of the wave function. A trial wave function, however, must be chosen such that the
expectation value of the Hamiltonian (Eq. (2.9)) may be evaluated. The average value of the
energy from trial wave functions will always be equal to or greater than the energy of the
ground state:
E[]  E[0] . (2.12)
Therefore, the ground state serves as a lower bound for variational calculations.
In the case of the Hartree-Fock approximation, the Ritz variational principle is applied by
constructing a trial wave function which is (and always remains) a Slater determinant . The
wave function is then determined by making the expectation value of the energy stationary
with respect to infinitesimal variations of the wave function when inserting a Hamiltonian
containing one and two-body operators. Unless the ground state Hamiltonian belongs to the
class of the Slater determinant wave functions, the state  which makes the energy functional
stationary will not be a true eigenstate of the Hamiltonian.
2.2 The Hartree-Fock Method
The philosophy of the Hartree-Fock method, however, is that the Slater determinant 
can be a very good approximation to the eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. One must be aware
that EHF is not necessarily equivalent to the eigenvalue E that would be obtained from solving
the full many-body problem exactly. The variation of the energy functional is equated to zero
to find a stationary value, and for the case of the Slater approximation it may be written
0 = 
|H| 
i (r)i(r)dr
, (2.13)
where i is a Lagrange multiplier that insists upon the orthonormalisation of the single-particle
wave functions in the subspace of the solution.
2.2.2 Derivation of the Hartree-Fock Equation from the Variational Prin-
ciple
The Hartree-Fock equation may be derived by performing the variation of the general two-
body Hamiltonian given by Eq. (2.5) in the restricted subspace of the Slater determinant.
The variation can be performed separately with respect to (r) or (r), assuming the
other is an independent variable. It sufficient to consider only one, as taking the variation
with respect to the other produces the adjoint equation.
The expectation value of H may be written
|H| =
i (r)
i(r) dr
i,j=1
i (r)
) v(r, r)i(r)j(r
) drdr
i,j=1
i (r)
) v(r, r)j(r)i(r
) drdr . (2.14)
2. APPLICATIONS OF MANY-BODY THEORY TO A NUCLEAR
SYSTEM
The variation given by Eq. (2.13) can be performed explicitly
(x)
|H| 
i (r)i(r) dr
(x) +
j (r
) v(x, r)(x)j(r
) dr
i (r) v(r,x)i(r)(x) dr
j (r
) v(x, r)j(x)(r
) dr
i (r) v(x, r)(r)i(x) dr  (x)
(x) +
j (r) v(x, r)(x)j(r) dr
i (r) v(x, r)(r)i(x) dr  (x) . (2.15)
The vector x is introduced to represent the position, spin and isospin co-ordinates of the
conjugate wave function (x), which the variation is taken with respect to. The sums over
the wave functions can be rewritten in terms of the one-body density matrix
(r, r) =
i (r
)i(r) . (2.16)
For the case where r  r, the local density may be written
(r, r)  (r) =
i (r)i(r) . (2.17)
This allows Eq. (2.15) to be written as the Hartree-Fock equation
(r) =
(r) v(r, r) dr
(r)
(r, r) v(r, r)(r
) dr . (2.18)
The single-particle energy of each orbital is now written in terms of a kinetic energy term
and the one-body, non-local Hartree-Fock potential:
vHF(r)i(r) =
(r) v(r, r) dr i(r)
(r, r) v(r, r)i(r
) dr . (2.19)
which may be inserted into Eq. (2.8) to define the Hartree-Fock single-particle Hamiltonian.
2.3 The Hartree-Fock Method with Skyrmes Effective Interaction
Expressions for the Hartree-Fock energy EHF can be determined by inserting the Hartree-
Fock equation (Eq. (2.18)) into the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (Eq. (2.14)) [64].
The Lagrange multipliers  may be interpreted using Koopmans theorem as the particle
ionisation energies, that is, the energy required to remove the particle in state  from the
nucleus. One must be aware that the sum of the single-particle energies is not equal to
the Hartree-Fock energy. As the interaction between particles i and j is identical to the
interaction between particles j and i, a double counting will occur when summing the single-
particle energies, which must be corrected for. For the application of Hartree-Fock with
effective nucleon-nucleon interactions, it will be shown in the following that the energy of
the system may be determined by constructing and integrating a universal energy density
functional which describes the nuclear system.
2.3 The Hartree-Fock Method with Skyrmes Effective Inter-
action
Skyrme proposed an effective interaction in 1959 [43] to describe the effective nucleon-nucleon
interaction in the particle-hole channel. The underlying assumption was that the interaction
could be expressed by an expansion on the range of the interaction, starting from a zero-
range and building up the inter-particle dependence in terms of derivatives. This interac-
tion therefore contains a zero-range contact term, and momentum terms which arise due to
higher orders in the expansion. These momentum terms allow some finite-range effects to be
captured. Reference [65] instructively demonstrates that taking the zero-range limit of the
finite-range Gogny interaction results in the same momentum dependence included in the
Skyrme interaction.
The proposed interaction included both a two and three-body interaction term, and was
successfully adopted by Vautherin and Brink in Hartree-Fock calculations for nuclei in the
early 1970s [34, 66]. The work of Vautherin and Brink demonstrated remarkably good results,
reproducing experimentally observed binding energies and nuclear radii across the nuclear
chart to a reasonable degree of precision, despite the simple mathematical form assumed for
the nuclear interaction.
Use of the Skyrme interaction has remained popular in Hartree-Fock calculations for over
40 years, allowing descriptions both of properties of nuclear structure and nuclear matter.
2. APPLICATIONS OF MANY-BODY THEORY TO A NUCLEAR
SYSTEM
This popularity has held due to the fact the zero-range interaction vastly reduces the com-
plexity of calculations as both the direct and exchange terms have the same mathematical
form [42, 61, 67]. This allows the energy density functional of the system to be expressed
solely in terms of local densities.
Effective interactions with finite ranges, such as the Gogny interaction [21, 44] are argued
to capture more realistic physics, as intuitively one would expect a local interaction to be
unable to reproduce the long or intermediate range properties of the nuclear interaction. In
particular, when describing nucleon-nucleon pairing correlations, a finite-range interaction
would be more desirable [44].
With increased computational power, recent efforts have begun utilising finite-range in-
teraction forces in three dimensional, symmetry unrestricted calculations [47]. However, due
to the fact that the Skyrme interaction provides remarkably good results in comparison to
calculations using finite-range effective interactions, with the added advantage of being con-
siderably less demanding to use, it remains a popular, practical choice to date when pushing
Skyrme Hartree-Fock (or equivalently, Density Functional Theory) calculations of nuclei to
modern limits.
2.3.1 Functional Form
The Skyrme interaction [43] contains a two and three-body part and describes the nucleon-
nucleon interaction in terms of a zero-range expansion. The two-body part stems from the
contact term and momentum dependence, and also includes spin exchange, spin-orbit [68]
and tensor effects. It can be written (adopting the notation from Ref. [69]):
v(2)(r1, r2) = t0
1 + x0P
(r1  r2)
1 + x1P
k2(r1  r2) + (r1  r2)k2
1 + x2P
k(r1  r2)k
+ iW0k(r1  r2) (1 + 2) k
3(1  k)(2  k) (1  2)k
(r1  r2)
(r1  r2)
3(1  k)(2  k) (1  2)k2
3(1  k)(2  k) (1  2)k
(r1  r2)k2
. (2.20)
2.3 The Hartree-Fock Method with Skyrmes Effective Interaction
Here, k and k are the momentum operators, which are defined by
k = 
(1 2)
k =
(1 
2) . (2.21)
The operator k acts to the right (upon the wave function), and k to the left (upon its
complex conjugate). The 1, 2 are the Pauli spin matrices operating on particle 1 and 2,
respectively. The spin-exchange operator P is defined by:
P =
(1 + 1  2) . (2.22)
The t0, t1, t2, x0, x1, x2,W0, te and to are all free parameters, which define a unique Skyrme
parametrization. They are typically fitted to nuclear structure data, nuclear matter prop-
erties, or equations of state. To date, over 200 parameterizations have been published by
various authors [70]. The term proportional to t0 corresponds to the contact interaction, and
the t1 and t2 correspond to the momentum dependence which allows the description of some
finite-range effects. The term proportional toW0 is the spin-orbit part of the nucleon-nucleon
interaction. The time-even and time-odd tensor terms, proportional to te and to, were widely
neglected for many years since the initial proposal by Skyrme, and hence are not included in
many parameterizations. Recent studies of nuclear structure properties have been dedicated
to investigating the effect of the re-inclusion of these terms [67, 69, 71, 72].
The three-body term is also assumed to have zero-range, and is formally equivalent to a
density dependent two-body term [34]. It is included in the functional by the term propor-
tional to t3:
v(3)(r1, r2) =
1 + x3P
r1 + r2
(r1  r2) . (2.23)
The exponent  was taken in early parametrizations to be equal to unity [34, 66]. However, in
later publications other values, 1/6 <  < 1/3, have been subsequently explored to improve
the compressibility properties of nuclear matter [73, 74]. Taking the exponent to be other
than unity disassociates the term from a zero-range three-body force. At that point, it should
be considered as a density-dependent part of the interaction [75].
The full Skyrme interaction vskyrme can be written as the sum of Eqs. (2.20) and (2.23).
The total binding energy of the system in the Skyrme Hartree-Fock (SHF) approach can
be expressed as the sum of the kinetic energy, the potential energy (which is recovered from
2. APPLICATIONS OF MANY-BODY THEORY TO A NUCLEAR
SYSTEM
integrating the Skyrme energy density functional), and the Coulomb energy due to the charge
of protons:
E = Ekinetic + ESkyrme + ECoul . (2.24)
Each contribution can be defined in terms of local densities and currents, which are in turn
obtained from the non-local one-body density and spin density matrices [69, 76, 77]
(r, r) =
q(r, r
) =
i,,q
i (r
, , q)i(r, , q) (2.25)
S(r, r) =
,,q
q(r, r
)|| =
i,,,q
i (r
, , q)i(r, , q) , (2.26)
where  = 1/2 is the spin projection, and q is the isospin projection, denoting proton or
neutron wave functions or densities. The operator  denotes the elements of the Pauli
spin matrices. Note here that the spin and isospin degrees of freedom are explicitly written,
whereas they have often been implicitly assumed. The following local densities can be defined
from the non-local densities:
(r) = (r, r)|r=r
(r) = (  )(r, r)|r=r
S(r) = S(r, r
)|r=r
T(r) = (  )S(r, r
)|r=r
j(r) = 
( )(r, r
)|r=r
J(r) = 
( )S(r, r
)|r=r
F(r) =
( +
)S(r, r
)|r=r . (2.27)
The local densities are the scalar particle density (r) (time-even), the scalar kinetic density
(r) (time-even), the vector spin density S(r) (time-odd), the vector spin-kinetic density
T (r) (time-odd), the vector current density j(r) (time-odd), the tensor spin-current density
J (r) (time-even), and the vector tensor-kinetic density F (r) (time-odd). The subscripts
,  indicate the components of the Cartesian co-ordinates. It can also be convenient to
define a (time-even) spin-orbit density as the anti-symmetric part of J [76, 78]
J(r) =
J(r) . (2.28)
2.3 The Hartree-Fock Method with Skyrmes Effective Interaction
When performing static Hartree-Fock calculations for even-even nuclei, the time-odd den-
sities have no effect upon the result, so are generally neglected [42]. This vastly simplifies the
form of the energy density functional by assuming that if a state is occupied, so is its time-
reversed partner. For time-dependent calculations of even-even nuclei, however, the minimum
densities required to allow the energy density functional to conserve Galilean invariance un-
der local gauge transformations include some time-odd terms [76] (also see Appendix A).
The minimum densities required to investigate the dynamics of even-even nuclei within time-
dependent Hartree-Fock are the particle density (r), the spin density S(r), the current
density j(r), the spin-orbit density J(r), and the kinetic density (r) [57].
2.3.2 Constructing the Energy Density Functional
Each contribution to the energy density functional given by Eq. (2.24) can be written in
terms of the local densities given by Eq. (2.27). The contribution from the kinetic term is
given by:
Ekinetic =
(r)dr . (2.29)
The Coulomb term depends upon the charge density of the system, although it is common
practice to approximate the charge density with the proton density p(r). The Coulomb term
contains a local part given by [57]
EdirectCoul =
p(r)p(r
|r  r|
drdr , (2.30)
and an approximation of the non-local exchange part is given by [79]:
exchange
Coul = 
p(r)
3 dr . (2.31)
The total Coulomb contribution to the energy density functional ECoul is the sum of the
direct and exchange Coulomb terms.
The Skyrme potential contains a direct and exchange term:
vskyrme = ij|v|ij  ij|v|ji
= ij|v(1 Pij)|ij . (2.32)
The exchange Pij is accounted for by inserting a term containing the exchange operators
(1 PM PPq). The Majorana operator PM applies a spatial exchange, the isospin operator
2. APPLICATIONS OF MANY-BODY THEORY TO A NUCLEAR
SYSTEM
Pq applies an exchange of isospin between the wave functions, and the spin exchange operator
P exchanges the spins (Eq. (2.22)). The Majorana operator has a value of +1 if the power of
the momentum operator is even, or 1 if it is odd. The isospin operator Pq is equivalent to the
term q1q2 , q  {p, n}, forbidding mixing of isospin states. As an aside, some modern studies
have been dedicated to the construction of an isospin invariant Energy Density Functional
framework [80].
The contribution to the EDF from the Skyrme potential term can therefore be determined
Eskyrme =
i (r
2) vskyrme(r1, r2)(1 PM PPq)
 i(r1)j(r2) dr1dr2dr1dr
2 |r1=r2=r1=r2 . (2.33)
Each term of the Skyrme interaction (Eqs. (2.20) and (2.23)) must be inserted and evaluated,
and then the full energy contribution can be taken as the sum of the individual terms. The
individual contributions must be evaluated before the limit is taken.
Taking into account only the minimum densities required to describe the ground state
and dynamics of even-even systems, the Skyrme energy functional can be written explicitly.
It is common practice [57, 61] to reformulate the resulting terms using the coefficients defined
b0 = t0
1 + 1
b0 = t0
1 + 1
1 + 1
b1 =
1 + 1
1 + 1
b2 =
1 + 1
b3 =
W 0 , (2.34)
which allows the contributions to the energy density functional to be separated into the
following terms:
dr , (2.35)
b1[  j2] b1
[qq  jq2]
dr , (2.36)
2.3 The Hartree-Fock Method with Skyrmes Effective Interaction

+2 
dr , (2.38)
Els =
b4[  J + S  ( j)] b4
[q  Jq + Sq  ( jq)]
dr . (2.39)
Some Skyrme forces add further refinements to the definition of the energy density func-
tional, for example the SkI subset attempt to add isospin freedom to the spin-orbit term by
giving different weightings to the proton and neutron states [81] (i.e. b4 6= b4).
The overall result of adopting the Skyrme interaction is that the total energy of the system
as given in Eq. (2.24) can be expressed purely in terms of local densities, which leads to the
apparent equivalence between SHF and DFT.
2.3.3 The Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian
The Hartree-Fock single-particle Hamiltonian can be defined from the variation [57, 76]
E = h , (2.40)
where E = E[] describes the energy density functional of the system. As the wave functions
completely define the local densities of the system, it is customary to separate the single-
particle Hamiltonian into the mean-field potentials that arise from variations of the energy
functional with respect to the different densities [34, 76]. Reference [76] presents the resulting
Hamiltonian for the case of inclusion of all the time-odd and time-even densities (not inclusive
of tensor terms, see e.g. [77]), whereas for the TDHF code Sky3D [57] the energy density
functional used is one which includes the minimum terms for the time evolution of even-even
nuclei.
The single-particle Hamiltonian (used in Sky3D) can be written [57]:
hq = Uq(r)  [Bq(r)] + i ~Wq(r)  () + q(r) 
[  Iq(r) + Iq(r)  ] . (2.41)
2. APPLICATIONS OF MANY-BODY THEORY TO A NUCLEAR
SYSTEM
The first term, Uq, can be obtained by performing the variation of E with respect to the
particle density  (dropping the argument r of the densities here for brevity):
Uq = b0 b0q + b1  b
1q  b2+ b
+1  b3
q  b3
 b4  J  b4  Jq . (2.42)
Next, by performing the variation with respect to the kinetic density  , the effective mass
term Bq can be written:
+ b1 b1q . (2.43)
The variation with respect to the spin-orbit density J yields:
~Wq = b4+ b4q . (2.44)
By considering the variation of the energy with respect to the time-odd current density j the
Iq = 2b1j + 2b1jq  b4 S  b
4 Sq (2.45)
is given. Finally, the variation with respect to the spin density S gives:
q = b4 j  b4 jq . (2.46)
2.3.4 Implementation of the Skyrme Hartree-Fock Method
The Skyrme Hartree-Fock equation boils down to a non-linear differential equation, and it
is solved for the ground state Slater determinant. This Slater determinant is comprised of
the single-particle wave functions i (with energy eigenvalues i). The single-particle wave
functions in turn define the densities, which define the mean fields, which define the single-
particle Hamiltonian. Therefore, the equation has to be solved in a self-consistent manner.
Typically, the starting point is a guess of the single-particle wave functions, often assum-
ing the form of a harmonic oscillator. From this, the initial density and mean-field is defined.
In the solver Sky3D, the Hartree-Fock equation is solved using a gradient step method accel-
erated by kinetic energy damping [82]. The wave functions are initialised in a 3D Cartesian
grid at iteration n = 0, and then are driven to the ground state by the operation:
(n+1) = O
(n) 
T + E0
h(n)  (n) |h
(n)|(n) 
(n)
. (2.47)
2.3 The Hartree-Fock Method with Skyrmes Effective Interaction
Here, O is an orthogonalisation operation; at each iteration n a Gram-Schmidt orthogonali-
sation is performed upon all the single-particle wave functions. The operator T is the kinetic
energy operator,  is a parameter determining the step size (typically in the range 0.1 to 0.8)
and E0 is the damping regulator. The damping regulator should be of the order of the depth
of the mean-field potential. The self-consistency of the problem is apparent here; (n+1) is
defined by the Hamiltonian h(n), and from (n+1) new densities are built, which are used to
calculate the new mean fields, which determine h(n+1).
The convergence of the scheme is tested numerically at each iteration step. Within Sky3D,
the convergence is measured by considering the energy variance of the single-particle states,
which is a way to test how good the i are as eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. This criterion
can be defined by
 |
, (2.48)
where
2 =  |h
2|  2
 =  |h| . (2.49)
Typical calculations converge with  in the order of 104 to 105.
There are, of course, other ways to determine the ground state solution. The imaginary
time method is another historically well used technique for Hartree-Fock iteration schemes
[83]. Further techniques may be used to accelerate the convergence of the solution, from
simply linearly mixing the densities from iteration n to n+ 1, to sophisticated mixing tech-
niques, such as Broydens method [84]. As an aside, the Broyden method has been proven
to be remarkably successful when performing calculations in a harmonic oscillator basis [47].
We have tried to implement this method within Sky3D. We have found that, when working
in a 3D Cartesian basis, the method would not provide any additional speed-up. This is in
contrast to our findings in a spherically-symmetric code. All in all, this suggests that the
3D geometry is incompatible with Broydens mixing. To further test this hypothesis, we
used a basic 3D Hartree-Fock code using a simplified version of the Skyrme nucleon-nucleon
interaction (containing only the t0 and t3 terms). Mixing either the densities, mean fields or
both between iterations showed no improved convergence compared to the case of a simple
linear mixing.
2. APPLICATIONS OF MANY-BODY THEORY TO A NUCLEAR
SYSTEM
As a final comment, Hartree-Fock minimisation schemes find local extrema; depending on
the initial configuration of the harmonic oscillator guesses, the final solution may correspond
to an isomeric state rather than the ground state solution. This may not be an issue if these
states are of interest, but to determine the global minimum it is best to perform several
Hartree-Fock calculations with the initial harmonic oscillator starting in an oblate or prolate
configuration.
2.4 Constrained Hartree-Fock
There can be many instances where it may be desirable not to calculate the global Hartree-
Fock ground state, but the Hartree-Fock minimum subject to certain conditions. For example,
techniques such as the Generator Co-ordinate Method can be implemented upon a superpo-
sition of mean-field states with different shape degrees of freedom imposed via constraints
[67]. Specifically to this work, investigating increasingly deformed Hartree-Fock states up
to the point of fission is a reasonable method to obtain initial states for time-dependent
investigations.
Constrained Hartree-Fock (CHF) is a constrained optimisation problem, where various
methods can be applied to impose the auxiliary conditions to the minimisation in the iter-
ation scheme. The simplest Linear Constraint Method (LCM) is the technique of Lagrange
multipliers [48]. The minimisation of the expectation energy of the energy functional E[]
can be subjected to a generic constraint on the expectation value of an operator . Therefore,
the variation of
E = E + (   0 ) (2.50)
can be considered. The Lagrange multiplier will drive the expectation value towards the
desired value, 0, as the Hartree-Fock equation is solved.
The technique can fail to enforce constraints in nuclear Hartree-Fock calculations [48],
requiring the use of refined methods. Another technique, as discussed in Refs. [85, 86] utilises
the method of Lagrange multipliers, but allows the constraining conditions to be violated
throughout the iterative procedure up until the final  is determined. The technique aims
to reduce numerical instabilities and improve convergence upon the desired value of the
constraint, and has been successful implemented in nuclear Hartree-Fock codes [87, 88].
2.4 Constrained Hartree-Fock
Another historically well-used technique for implementing constraints in nuclear Hartree-
Fock theory is the Quadratic Penalty Method (QPM) [21, 45, 48], which minimises the energy
of the system subject to
E = E + c(   0 )2 . (2.51)
The parameter c(> 0) is known as the penalty parameter. The energy of the system will be
a minimum when  = 0, and this is enforced as c tends to , allowing convergence on the
exactly desired value of . Unfortunately, for very large values of c the system can become
numerically unstable; in many cases the QPM cannot enforce the exactly specified auxiliary
conditions.
A third technique, the so-called Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) [89, 90] has been
demonstrated in Ref. [48] to be a powerful method to enforce constraints in nuclear DFT
calculations, both providing numerical stability and the ability to converge precisely upon
the specified value of the constraint. This method will be summarised and its integration
into the solver Sky3D discussed in the following Sections.
2.4.1 The Augmented Lagrangian Method
The Augmented Lagrangian Method, as presented in Ref. [48], can be viewed as a hybrid of
the linear and quadratic constraint methods. The energy density functional is augmented to
contain extra terms corresponding to the constraint upon the expectation of the operator ;
E = E + (  0) + c(  0)2
= |H|+ 
||  0
||  0
, (2.52)
To compute the minimum energy subject to the desired value of the constraint, the variational
derivative can be taken. This allows the modified single-particle Hamiltonian to be expressed
in terms of the original (unconstrained) Hamiltonian, and an additional part which drives
the solution towards the desired value,
E = h| = h|+ |+ 2c
||  0
|
= h|+ 2c
  0()
| , (2.53)
where 0() = 0  /2c. The Lagrange multiplier  is updated iteratively as
k+1 = k + 2c(  0) . (2.54)
2. APPLICATIONS OF MANY-BODY THEORY TO A NUCLEAR
SYSTEM
Throughout the iterative procedure, the multiplier k will converge, resulting in a stationary
value of the energy subject to the desired constraint. An initial value of 0 = 0 is often
adopted. Reference [90] also contains an algorithm for updating the stiffness parameter c.
As with other constraint methods, in principle the method can be generalised to enforce
an arbitrary number of auxiliary conditions, which can be added into the expression for the
mean-field given in Eq. (2.53).
2.4.2 Implementation of the ALM in a Nuclear SHF Solver
The ALM can be implemented in a straightforward manner into a Hartree-Fock iteration
scheme. The algorithms are presented in Refs. [48] and [90]. The ALM single-particle Hamil-
tonian h, as given in Eq. (2.53), can be substituted in place of the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian
into the iteration scheme (Eq. (2.47)). Once the Hamiltonian has been applied to all the
single-particle wave functions for a single iteration, the Lagrange parameter is updated via
Eq. (2.54). Convergence is defined by the simultaneous conditions that both the fluctuations
in the single-particle energies and difference between the desired and current values of the
constrained observable are sufficient small.
Initial values for  and c can be chosen arbitrarily. The parameter  was always chosen
to start from 0. The parameter c requires a little more fine tuning: too large values of c can
result in numerical instabilities if the difference between the desired and current expectation
value of the constrained observable is large. To overcome this, c may be increased iteratively
as the calculation converges upon the desired value. An algorithm for this purpose is detailed
in Ref. [90].
Figure 2.1 shows an example of the evolution of various observables and parameters
associated with enforcing a constraint upon the quadrupole deformation parameter 20 (see
Appendix B for the definition) for the nucleus 46Ti. The calculation starts from a state with
20 = 1.21, and the desired value is 1.24. An oscillatory behaviour is observed as the shape of
the nucleus converges; this is due to linear mixing of the scalar densities between iterations.
The panel i) shows the evolution of the expectation value of 20 throughout the iterative
procedure, and the panel ii) displays the absolute magnitude of the difference between the
expectation and the desired value at each step. Panel iii) displays the convergence of the

stiffness constant c throughout the process, which starts from a value of 50.
The shape is observed to oscillate around the desired expectation value. These oscillations
are quickly damped by the increase of the c parameter, and a converged solution is obtained
after about 900 iterations.
2.5 Correlations Beyond the Static Mean-Field
The Hartree-Fock approach provides only the lowest order microscopic description of the
nucleus. Due to the Slater determinant approximation of the many-body wave function, the
method breaks symmetries and does not include various correlations that must be considered
to truly describe the ground-state correlations of the atomic nucleus [61, 67]. This does not
imply that the Hartree-Fock method is intrinsically flawed, but rather that the method can
be considered as a starting point for methods that go beyond the mean-field approximation.
In the context of this work, static solutions to the Hartree-Fock equation are required for
initial configurations to perform dynamic calculations. Therefore, the complex procedure of
2. APPLICATIONS OF MANY-BODY THEORY TO A NUCLEAR
SYSTEM
restoring symmetries and adding correlations to these static states will be neglected. The
only correlation beyond the mean-field that will be considered for the static calculations is
short-range pairing correlations.
2.5.1 Pairing Correlations
Pure Slater determinant states are appropriate for describing doubly-magic, spherical nuclei
[61], where single-particle levels are filled below the Fermi energy, and empty above. For
these nuclei, there is a large energy difference between the highest occupied state and the
next empty one. However, when investigating nuclei away from these shell closures, the
concept of quasiparticles is more appropriate: nucleons can in principle occupy any level.
Occupation is determined as a probability of the single-particle state being a particle (filled)
or hole (empty) state. Due to the fact the energy levels near the Fermi surface are nearly
degenerate in energy, there can be an appreciable scattering of occupation probability, so
pairing is required to obtain a unique ground state [21, 42, 61, 67]. Inclusion of pairing in
a Hartree-Fock scheme therefore allows the inclusion of some particle-particle correlations,
which the pure Slater determinant cannot describe.
The most general pairing mean-field scheme is Hartree-Fock Bogliubov (HFB), which
introduces the concept of quasiparticle states which are related to the single-particle states by
the Bogoliubov transformation [21, 42, 67]. This scheme intrinsically includes pairing effects,
however the HFB method is computationally expensive to apply. The Bardeen-Cooper-
Schrieffer (BCS) pairing scheme is an approximation of full HFB, and is a popular technique
for modelling the short-range pairing correlations in deformed nuclei. The approach, as first
described by Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer to describe superconductivity [91], was applied
to nuclear structure physics with considerable success by Belyaev in 1959 [92]. The BCS
approach simplifies the pairing scheme by forcing the pairing potential to be diagonal in the
basis of the eigenstates of the mean-field Hamiltonian [67].
Recent investigations have shown calculations using the BCS approximation can quan-
titatively include most of the information HFB provides. Reference [93] demonstrates that
BCS pairing with a finite-range pairing potential is a good substitution for HFB, and Ref.
[94] discusses simply renormalising the BCS pairing field to capture most of the information
given by HFB employed in the relativistic mean-field model.
2.5 Correlations Beyond the Static Mean-Field
Within the scope of this thesis, pairing has been described entirely within the BCS scheme,
which will be discussed in the following Sections.
2.5.2 The BCS Pairing Model
As mentioned previously, the need to incorporate a pairing scheme arises as single-particle
wave functions making up a pure Slater determinant are no longer an appropriate basis for the
description of deformed nuclei. Within the BCS scheme, it is assumed that pairs of nucleons
which are symmetric under time reversal (known as Kramers degenerate) can be coupled by
a short-range pairing force into states of zero total angular momentum j. In other words,
the nucleons pair into states within an angular momentum j shell with projection quantum
numbers mj and mj . The BCS state can be constructed from the vacuum by creating pairs
denoted by k and k. These states are time reversed partners of one other, corresponding to
the angular momentum projected partners mj and mj . The states |k, k make up the whole
single-particle space:
|BCS =
(uk + vka
|0 . (2.55)
Here, k is used to label the single-particle states, and k the time reversed partner. The
product only runs over positive k, as for each k > 0 there exists the conjugate state k < 0.
The probability of occupation of the state |k, k can be interpreted as |vk|2, whereas |uk|2 is
associated with the probability the state remains empty. This interpretation as a probability
arises from the normalisation of the BCS state:
BCS|BCS = 0 |
(uk + vkakak)
(uk + vk a
k)| 0
(u2k + v
k) (2.56)
= 1 . (2.57)
The BCS state has some qualities that makes it different from a pure Slater determinant.
Notably, the BCS wave function does not conserve particle number. This can be realised
from considering the mean square deviation of the expectation value of the number, which
can be defined by
N2 = BCS|N2|BCS  BCS|N |BCS2 , (2.58)
2. APPLICATIONS OF MANY-BODY THEORY TO A NUCLEAR
SYSTEM
and can be evaluated to 4
k>0 u
k [42]. This uncertainty arises from partially occupied
states, that is, states where uk or vk are not equal to 0 or 1, respectively.
Taking into account these properties of the BCS state, as with the discussion of the
Hartree-Fock method in Sec. 2.2, where the many bodied wave function was a pure Slater
determinant state, a Hamiltonian containing one and two-body interactions may be consid-
ered. It is customary to to write the Hamiltonian in terms of a single-particle part (following
the Hartree-Fock approximation), and a pairing field which is described by a separate pairing
interaction, vpair. In this case, the following expectation value of the BCS Hamiltonian can
be written [21]:
BCS|HBCS|BCS =
k|t|kv2k +
k,k0
kk|v|kk  kkv2kv
k,k>0
kk|vpair|kk  kkukvkukvk . (2.59)
The first two terms run over all the configuration space, acting only upon particle states
(which have occupation probability v2k). The last two-body term acts upon pairs, therefore
the sum runs only over positive k. Considering the expectation value of the BCS Hamiltonian
in this form allows the Hartree-Fock and BCS equations to be coupled and solved (commonly
referred to as HF+BCS). A simple interaction is often assumed in the pairing channel for
convenience when performing HF+BCS calculations [95].
As with the Slater determinant case, the variation of the expectation value of the BCS
Hamiltonian can be taken to find the ground state energy. As the basis was seen to allow
violations of particle number, a Lagrange multiplier  must be included in the BCS Hamil-
tonian to ensure particle number is conserved. The variation can be replaced by a partial
derivative as the BCS wave function is defined by the vk:
0 = BCS|HBCS  N |BCS
BCS|HBCS  N |BCS . (2.60)
Explicitly performing the variation (see, e.g. Refs. [21, 42]) gives several results. Firstly,
the BCS equation can be written:
2kukvk + k(v
k  u
k) = 0 (2.61)
2.5 Correlations Beyond the Static Mean-Field
where the single-particle energies obtained from the Hartree-Fock scheme 0k are modified:
k = 
k   . (2.62)
This allows the Lagrange parameter  to be interpreted as the Fermi energy.
The gap parameter k is given by:
k = 
kk |vpair| kk  kkukvk . (2.63)
Finally, expressions for the probability of the pair state (k, k) as either a particle or hole state
may be written:
v2k =
1 k
2k + 
 (2.64)
u2k =
1 + k
2k + 
 . (2.65)
Figure 2.2: Occupation probabilities as a function of k for three different gap parameters. The
non pairing case ( = 0) shows a sharp cutoff of occupation at the Fermi energy. The central and
right panel present two cases of pairing interactions; as the pairing gap parameter is increased,
the occupation of states about the Fermi energy transitions to zero more gradually.
Figure (2.2) shows an example of the occupation probability of a single-particle state as a
function of the single-particle energy k for different pairing gaps, for the case of a simplified
pure pairing interaction [21]. In this case, the pairing gap  is fixed for each state k. For the
case of  = 0, there is a sharp cutoff of occupation at the Fermi energy, which is equivalent
to a pure Slater determinant state. The transition from particle to hole states is governed
by the magnitude of , requiring comparison to nuclear structure data to fit the strength of
the pairing interaction. In the application of pairing in the work for this thesis, however, the
pairing gap k is solved explicitly for each k following Eq. (2.63).
2. APPLICATIONS OF MANY-BODY THEORY TO A NUCLEAR
SYSTEM
2.5.3 Implementing BCS Pairing in a Nuclear SHF Solver
When implementing BCS pairing within the Hartree-Fock framework, the problem requires
solutions to the BCS equation to determine the occupation amplitudes v2k (Eq. (2.64)), the
pairing gaps k (Eq. (2.63)) and the single-particle energies obtained from subtracting the
Fermi energy  from the Hartree-Fock single-particle energies (Eq. (2.62)). These equations
are non-linear, and can be solved by iteration [57] for proton and neutron states separately.
The densities needed to describe the energy density functional (as discussed in Sec. 2.3.1)
in this basis can be modified to account for the pairing occupation v2k of each single-particle
state. For example, the particle density matrix becomes (the index i here running over all
single-particle states):
(r, r) =
v2i 
)i(r) . (2.66)
In practice, the sum cannot be performed over an infinite number of states, therefore the
size of the pairing space must be chosen carefully. Using a realistic pairing interaction,
the probability of occupation scattering into states well above the Fermi energy will reduce
towards zero. This justifies the energy-dependent cutoff of level occupation adopted in some
calculations [67, 96]. If using a simplified zero-range pairing interaction, as is often adopted,
a cutoff of occupation is needed as scattering can occur over any energy range.
From an alternative perspective to an energy-dependent cutoff, the scattering of occu-
pation across a shell closure will be greatly reduced due to the large energy differences of
the levels above and below the closure. The size of the pairing space Nmax for proton and
neutron states can be chosen reasonably from the approximate relation [57, 67]:
Nmax,q = Nq +
N2/3q . (2.67)
Here, Nq refers to the number of protons (Z) or neutrons (N) in the nucleus being investi-
gated.
When including pairing effects, the energy contribution to the SHF energy density func-
tional is dependent upon the form assumed for the pairing potential. A typical choice
within the Skyrme Hartree-Fock framework is to use a zero-range pairing interaction, en-
suring that the terms are of the same form of a Skyrme interaction with only t0 and t3
terms [61, 67, 95, 96]. The pairing interaction using the so-called density-dependent delta
2.6 Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock
interaction (DDDI) is a function of the nuclear density (r), and is given by
vpair(r1, r2) =
(1 P)
(r1  r2) , (2.68)
where a different strength parameter V0,q can be used for particles of different isospin q,
and may be adjusted for different locations throughout the nuclear landscape. The nuclear
saturation density 0 is typically taken to be 0.16 fm3, but in the case where 0 , the
volume delta interaction (VDI) is recovered. The exponent  is usually taken to be equal to
unity. Some modern Skyrme parametrizations propose use of a pairing interaction which is
a mix of the DDDI and VDI interaction [97, 98, 99].
The energy contribution from the pairing term can be evaluated analogously to the energy
contribution from the Skyrme interaction (Eq. (2.33)). By defining the pseudo-pairing density,
(r, r)q =
Nmax,q
uivii(r
)i(r) , (2.69)
where the sum is performed over time-reversed partners [57], and neglecting time-odd con-
tributions to the energy density functional (as by definition the pairs are symmetric under
time reversal), the energy contribution can be evaluated to [67, 96]:
Epair =
qp,n
2q(r)V0,q
dr . (2.70)
where q(r) is the local pairing density. When accounting for pairing correlations, this term
must be added into the energy density functional given by Eq. (2.24).
2.6 Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock
In general, a non-relativistic system will obey the time-dependent Schrdinger equation as it
evolves in time:
d|(t)
= H|(t) . (2.71)
The time evolution of a many-body wave function , which spans the entire Hilbert space,
from t = t0 to t = t1 can therefore be deduced by applying the time evolution operator to
the state |(t = t0) :
|(t1) = eiHt/~|(t0) . (2.72)
The time-dependent Schrdinger equation can only be solved exactly for a few special cases,
motivating the need for approximations. The time-dependent Hartree-Fock equation was
2. APPLICATIONS OF MANY-BODY THEORY TO A NUCLEAR
SYSTEM
first written down by Dirac in the 1930s [100] to describe atoms by considering the time
evolution of the self-consistent mean-field. The procedure was applied to nuclear dynamics
in the 1970s [76], but early calculations suffered from computational limitations, requiring
spatial symmetries to be assumed. Modern TDHF solvers can evolve Slater determinants in
three dimensional, symmetry unrestricted frameworks [57, 58, 59].
As with the stationary Hartree-Fock equation, a fundamental assumption in time-dependent
Hartree-Fock is that the many-body wave function is the Slater determinant (r, t). The vari-
ational principle can be applied to obtain the equations of motion for the path of least action
to describe the time evolution of such a system. The action can be written:
St0,t1 [(r, t)] =
dt(r, t)|
|(r, t) . (2.73)
Due to the Slater determinant approximation, the two-body, three-body,..., N -body density
matrices can be expressed in terms of the one-body density. For a Hamiltonian containing
one and two-body terms, the two-body density can be written in terms of one-body density
matrices, plus a correlation term which describes two-body collisions beyond the mean-field
approximation. Within TDHF, by definition the two-body correlation term is equated to
zero. The technique, however, does include some correlations that go beyond the concept
of a mean-field. Although two-body collisions (two-body friction) are neglected in TDHF,
TDHF does include what is known as one-body friction, that is, collisions between particles
and the wall of the mean-field [21].
As with Hartree-Fock, time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations may be performed using
the Skyrme effective interaction [76, 101]. Analogously to the static case, one can draw an
equivalence between time-dependent Hartree-Fock and time-dependent Density Functional
Theory.
2.6.1 Derivation of the Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock Equation from the
Variation Principle
The time-dependent Hartree-Fock equation may be recovered by minimising the action S
defined by Eq. (2.73) (see, e.g. Ref. [101]). This is equivalent to performing the variation
S = 0, applied with the boundary conditions (t0) = (t1) = 0. The time-dependent
Hartree-Fock equation will therefore yield deterministic trajectories, which will always follow
the path of least action.
2.6 Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock
As with the static Hartree-Fock equation, the variation can be performed with respect to
the single-particle wave function (x, t), or the conjugate (x, t); the TDHF equation or
its conjugate will be recovered depending on the choice. The action can be written in the
dri (r, )
i(r, ) E[()]
, (2.74)
where here the energy expectation E[()] is written as a functional of the time-dependent
one-body density (which in turn is determined by the single-particle wave functions). The
time co-ordinate is denoted by  . The variation of the action with respect to (x, t) can be
performed:
(x, t)
(x, t)
E[()]
(x, t)
. (2.75)
The functional derivative of E[()] can be rewritten using a change of variable,
E[()]
(x, t)
drdr
E[()]
(r, r; )
(r, r; )
(x, t)
, (2.76)
and by writing the non-local density explicitly as
(r, r; ) =
i (r
, )i(r, ) , (2.77)
the variation of this density with respect to (x, t) can be performed to yield
(r, r; )
(x, t)
= (r, t)(r
  x)(t ) . (2.78)
This results in Eq. (2.76) reducing to
E[()]
(x, t)
E[(t)]
(r,x ; t)
(r, t) . (2.79)
The Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian can be substituted into the above relationship using:
h(r,x, t) =
E[(t)]
(r,x ; t)
. (2.80)
This allows Eq. (2.75) to be written in the form of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock equation:
(x, t) =
dr h(r,x, t)(r, t) . (2.81)
This equation describes the time evolution of the single-particle wave function  interacting
with the self-consistent mean-field. Adopting the zero-range Skyrme interaction allows the
TDHF equation to be written in terms of the local spatial co-ordinate r:
(r, t) = h(t)(r, t) . (2.82)
2. APPLICATIONS OF MANY-BODY THEORY TO A NUCLEAR
SYSTEM
Reference [21] details some properties of the TDHF equation. The total energy, or-
thogonality of the wave functions, product character (that is, the wave function is a Slater
determinant) and the average expectation values of symmetry operators (such as particle
number and linear and angular momentum) are conserved for all time. The fact that orthog-
onally is conserved is extremely convenient, allowing TDHF calculations to be performed
using massively parallel computation techniques [57]. The TDHF equation produces deter-
ministic trajectories as the wave functions evolve, and the wave functions display microscopic
reversibility.
2.6.2 Time-Dependent Applications of Pairing Correlations
Several recent TDHF studies have been dedicated to investigating the effects due to the
inclusion of time-dependent pairing correlations within time-dependent Hartree-Fock calcu-
lations. Full time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (TDHFB) has been implemented for
investigations of collective resonances [102, 103], whereas Canonical-basis time-dependent
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov [104], or equivalently time-dependent Hartree-Fock coupled with
time-dependent BCS pairing [105], has been implemented both for small (e.g. collective res-
onances [106, 107]) and large amplitude (e.g. fusion and particle transfer reactions [108, 109,
110]) TDHF calculations.
In this thesis, the fixed occupation amplitude (FOA) approximation has been assumed:
the ground state is calculated using HF+BCS, then the occupations of the single-particle
states are fixed at the value defined from the static solution throughout time evolution.
The contribution to the energy functional from pairing is taken to be zero for the TDHF
calculations.
The effects of time-dependent pairing upon the nuclear dynamics in comparison to adopt-
ing the FOA has been shown in some cases to be significant for large amplitude applications of
TDHF. References [108, 109] show, for example, inclusion of time-dependent pairing reducing
the fusion cross section in sample reactions. A study of the effect of time-dependent pairing
upon fission dynamics within TDHF presents itself as a natural extension of this work.
2.6 Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock
2.6.3 Implementation of the Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock Method
The single-particle wave functions can be evolved in time via the TDHF equation (Eq. (2.81))
by writing it as the integral equation
|i(t+ t)  = T (t, t+ t)|i(t)  , (2.83)
where T is the time evolution operator:
T (t, t+ t) = exp
 t+t
h(t) dt
. (2.84)
A small t is used to obviate the problems of time ordering due to the discrete time step.
This operation can be performed efficiently on a discretised 3D grid using a Taylor expansion
to represent the exponential (typically of the order of 4-6), and adopting a predictor-corrector
strategy when evolving the wave functions [57].
In principle, the time evolution is unitary, therefore the single-particle orthonormalization
and energies are conserved [21]. If the Slater determinant is a true eigenstate of the Hartree-
Fock Hamiltonian, when time evolution begins, nothing will happen.
For this thesis, the time evolution of deformed initial configurations will be examined;
many of these will not be eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Therefore it may be of interest to
simply evolve the Slater determinants in time to observe their behaviour. Other scenarios
can of course be considered; it is common practice to apply time-dependent external fields or
kinetic energy boosts to the system to investigate the physics of interest, ranging from small
amplitude collective excitation modes [111, 112], to large amplitude fission or fusion studies
[53, 60, 101, 113, 114]. Both approaches will be studied in time-dependent calculations of
fission in Chapters 4 and 5.
2. APPLICATIONS OF MANY-BODY THEORY TO A NUCLEAR
SYSTEM
Initial Conditions
Experimental studies of nuclear fission have been ongoing since the discovery of the process
in 1938 by Hahn and Strassmann [16]. The actinide nuclide 240Pu has long been a case of
interest, as spontaneous fission presents itself as a decay mechanism with significant proba-
bility (relative to other isotopes in the actinide region), allowing quantitive comparisons to
be made between spontaneous and induced fission [115, 116, 117, 118]. Studies have demon-
strated a multitude of techniques known to induce fission, including neutron-induced fission,
fission induced by more complex projectiles, and photo-fission [115, 119]. Recent experimental
campaigns have also been investigating the process of beta-delayed fission [120].
Investigations of spontaneous fission within TDHF are prohibitive. To reach a fissioned
configuration from the ground or isomeric state, the nucleus must tunnel through the barriers
in the potential energy surface (PES). TDHF allows a quantum mechanical description of
single-particle wave functions, but the collective motion is semi-classical, forbidding tunnelling
to occur. Therefore, TDHF is suitable for investigating induced, rather than spontaneous,
fission processes.
To describe induced fission within TDHF certainly presents a challenge; namely choosing
a method which will induce the process. We will follow two different strategies. Firstly,
deformation-induced fission (DIF), where an initial state which is deformed such that fission
is the most favourable way for the wave functions to evolve (thereby assuming the process
inducing the reaction has already occurred). Secondly, boost-induced fission (BIF), where an
excitation is provided during the time evolution that will allow the nucleus to fission.
The latter strategy can be justified by analogy to other investigations using TDHF. Col-
lective giant resonances are often explored by calculating a ground state Slater determinant,

then applying a small amount of energy in the form of a multipole boost to represent a phys-
ical process having occurred. For example, giant dipole excitation modes can be investigated
by adding a small amount of energy in the form of a collective dipole operator, modelling
the absorption of a photon [111, 112]. As the quadrupole degree of freedom is important
when describing fissioning shapes, a large amplitude collective quadrupole excitation could
be applied to a Slater determinant to mimic a process which induces nuclear fission [55, 56].
This will be investigated in Chapter 5.
A logical place to begin an investigation of fission within a microscopic framework is to
examine the PES for the nucleus of interest. These are obtained by performing an energy
minimisation with respect to constraints imposed upon the shape degrees of freedom. Early
studies focussed upon constraining the quadrupole degree of freedom [45, 46]. The typi-
cal observed behaviour in actinide nuclei for the binding energy as a function of increasing
quadrupole deformation is to follow a multi-humped pathway (see Fig. 3.1). Although the
multi-humped behaviour of the energy surface cannot be measured directly, experimental
evidence points towards the characteristic structure [25, 26]. Starting from the ground state,
increasing the quadrupole deformation will result in encountering a first fission barrier. By
increasing the deformation further, a secondary minimum, corresponding to an isomer, is
found. Beyond this, a second fission barrier is encountered, and past this the general consen-
sus is that it becomes more energetically favourable for the nucleus to fission. The energies
EA, EB and EII presented in Fig. 3.1 correspond to those defined in Ref. [33] as the energy
difference between the ground state and the peak of the first fission barrier, the energy dif-
ference between the ground state and the peak of the second fission barrier, and the energy
difference between the ground state and fission isomer, respectively. In some exotic cases,
triple-humped potential surfaces are expected [26, 50, 121, 122].
Modern symmetry unrestricted DFT solvers have extended the PES for multiple con-
straints, for example simultaneously constraining the quadrupole and octupole degrees of
freedom to explore two-dimensional deformation surfaces [48]. The approach of calculating a
multi-dimensional PES to describe fission within a microscopic framework has enjoyed much
recent attention [48, 49, 50, 51, 52]. Another method used to explore fission pathways is to
apply a shell-corrected macroscopic liquid drop model, which has been used to investigate
five-dimensional deformation space. This technique has been applied to perform exhaustive

topographical surveys of deformation space to deduce fission properties of static configura-
tions [30, 31, 32, 33].
However, this approach of calculating the PES to describe fission, regardless of the number
of dimensions, is limited to producing a series of static solutions which attempt to describe
a dynamic process. Performing shape-constrained DFT calculations produce Slater determi-
nants which contain no internal excitation. Some attempts have been made to account for
finite temperature effects [51], but as fission is a dynamic process, translational motion and
collective excitations should be present. Time-dependent techniques may therefore yield new,
insightful results as they can describe the dynamics of a fissioning system. Within the scope
of this thesis, the PES will be investigated to produce static Slater determinants of varying
deformation. The time evolution of these Slater determinants will then be investigated using
TDHF.
3.1 Shape Constraints
Within the Hartree-Fock (or DFT) framework, the PES of a nucleus may be explored by
performing a series of constrained Hartree-Fock (CHF) minimisations. As discussed in the
previous Chapter, CHF techniques allow the calculation of the Slater determinant of min-
imum energy, subject to an auxiliary constraint. In all further discussions the Augmented
3. INITIAL CONDITIONS
Lagrangian Method (ALM) has been used to impose the auxiliary conditions (see Sec. 2.4.1).
3.1.1 Defining the Shape of a Nucleus
The starting point to perform CHF calculations of a nucleus is to chose an observable which
may be constrained. In the context of an investigation of fission, the shape of the nucleus
is a logical degree of freedom to consider. The nuclear shape may be defined by relation to
the spherical harmonics. Figure (3.2) shows the spherical harmonics Yl,=0, l = 1, .., 4 in
comparison to a circle of fixed radius. The quadrupole (l = 2) degree of freedom provides
a measurement of the elongation of the nucleus. The octupole (l = 3) deformation provides
a quantification of deviations from mass reflection symmetry. Measurements of the hexade-
capole (l = 4) deformation can be used to infer information regarding neck formation [123].
The mathematical expression of the Yl0 is given explicitly in Appendix B.
l = 1 l = 2 l = 3 l = 4
Figure 3.2: The spherical harmonics Yl0, l = 1, ..., 4 with respect to a circle of constant radius.
The shape of the nucleus will be defined with respect to these. Note that the l = 1 (dipole) case
corresponds to a shift in the centre of mass, rather than a deformed shape.
The shape of standard nuclear states may be written in terms of an expansion of spherical
harmonics; there is no reason why one should not include terms beyond l = 4, or restrict 
to zero. However, when performing CHF calculations or measuring the nuclear deformation,
a small selection of relevant parameters is typically used to characterise the nuclear shape.
In the context of this work, the deformation parameters l0, l = 1, ..., 4 have been defined
as a measurement of the deformation, relating to the first four spherical harmonics. These
deformation parameters are given explicitly in Appendix B.
Alternate useful parameterisations may also be defined: for example the Bohr-Mottleson
deformation parameters describe the quadrupole degree of freedom and the corresponding
3.1 Shape Constraints
triaxiality via the ,  representation [42]. In this representation,   0 and 0    60
(see Appendix B). This parametrisation is advantageous as it gives a measure of triaxial
deformation. For non-zero values of , if  = 0 the shape is purely prolate deformed. For
 = 60 the shape is purely oblate deformed. Other measures of  represent a triaxial shape.
3.1.2 Choice of Constraint for Studying Fission
For fission studies, undoubtedly the quadrupole degree of freedom is of importance, as it
describes the elongation of the nucleus. Additionally, as many nuclei are observed to fission
with asymmetric mass distributions, the octupole degree of freedom is vital to describe any
mass reflection asymmetry. As previously mentioned, modern DFT solvers are able to perform
symmetry unrestricted calculations which allow, in principle, any and multiple degrees of
freedom to be explored.
Constraints can be imposed from alternate perspectives to study fission in static calcula-
tions. Some studies assume a priori knowledge of the fission fragments [53, 124], and constrain
the distance between the two centres of mass to generate initial states before investigating
time evolution.
Within the scope of this work, no a priori knowledge of the fission fragments is assumed.
From a static perspective, fission is explored by gradually increasing the deformation of the
nucleus from the ground state. Only the quadrupole deformation will be constrained; the
purpose of this thesis is not to pursue an in-depth investigation of multiple shape-constraints
in Hartree-Fock calculations, but rather to use the technique to produce initial states to then
investigate their time evolution. All other degrees of freedom are assumed to settle into the
configuration of minimum energy [21]. References [33] and [32] warn that this may not always
be the case, arguing that a constrained minimisation will not necessarily follow the optimum
fission pathway. They suggest that a complete topographical survey of the deformation space
may be required to determine the static fission pathways. Such a survey may be possible
within the shell-corrected macroscopic model employed in such studies, but is beyond the
scope of current CHF calculations. It bears mention that the method applied in Ref. [33] can
only explore the explicitly parameterised nuclear shapes, whereas Hartree-Fock calculations
can in principle explore every shape degree of freedom, and determined the minimum energy
configuration for a given constraint. It is purely down to the numerics of the calculation if
3. INITIAL CONDITIONS
a state which is not the energy minimum configuration for a given constraint is converged
upon.
3.1.3 The Principal Axis Co-ordinate Frame
The principal (or intrinsic) axis of the nucleus is an essential concept when performing static
or time-dependent calculations in three dimensions: there is no requirement that the ori-
entation of the Slater determinant must align with the lab co-ordinate frame [57]. Simply
performing a constrained minimisation upon the 20 parameter defined with respect to the
fixed lab co-ordinate axis may cause the Slater determinant to rotate. This is because the
Hartree-Fock minimisation seeks the most bound configuration, and it has no knowledge of
the orientation of the nuclear state. Figure 3.3 illustrates this point with a crude cartoon.
For the case i), 20 is defined with respect to the lab frame. The measurement of 20 for case
ii), also measured in the lab frame, could yield the same value. Therefore, a Hartree-Fock
minimisation constraining 20 would converge upon whichever state has the greater bind-
ing energy. This can be problematic when a state like ii) is targeted in the minimisation
procedure, as in general less deformed states are more bound.
In the case iii), the principal z axis corresponds to the lab x axis shown in case i), as
the shape is very slightly deformed. The principal axis corresponds to that of the greatest
elongation. In the case iv), again the principal axis frame is chosen to define 20. Due to this
choice, the value of the quadrupole deformation is well defined regardless of any rotations in
co-ordinate space, allowing convergence upon the desired state.
Practically, the principal axis co-ordinate frame can be determined by first building the
(3 3) quadrupole tensor measured in the lab frame, as defined by
Qij =
dr(r)
3rirj  r2ij
. (3.1)
The tensor should take into account a centre of mass correction (the origin of the co-ordinate
system must be at the centre of mass of (r)), and once built may be diagonalised. The
diagonalisation yields three eigenvalues Qi. These are ordered by absolute magnitude, and
the largest Q3(= Qprinc) is chosen to relate to 20 as measured in the principal axis frame by
[111]

Figure 3.3: Cartoon displaying the comparison of multipole shapes in the lab xz frame [cases

] vs. the principal axis x  z frame [cases iii
and iv
]. When the Slater determinant
is free to rotate in co-ordinate space, use of the principal axis co-ordinate frame is essential to
define the nuclear shape via the l0 deformation parameters.
Diagonalising the quadrupole tensor also produces a set of eigenvalues, which can be used
to map the rotation from the lab frame to the principal axis frame. These eigenvectors make
the components of the rotation matrix R,
xy
R11 R12 R13R21 R22 R23
R31 R32 R33
where r = (x, y, z). This rotation matrix can be used to determine the fixed axis and the
single rotation around that axis which transforms from one frame to the other, allowing an
intuitive picture of the alignment of the nucleus. By use of the Euler-Rodrigues formula for
3D rotations [125], the rotation angle  can be defined as
 = arccos
(Tr R 1)
, (3.3)
and the axis of rotation n:
(3 Tr R)(1 + Tr R)
R32 R23R13 R31
R21 R12
 . (3.4)
Special cases arise when Tr R is equal to 1 or +3. In the case of an improper rotation,
detR = 1, and the rotation is followed by a reflection about the rotating axis.
3. INITIAL CONDITIONS
The rotation matrix, which is determined by considering the quadrupole tensor, may
therefore be used to explicitly determine the multipole deformation parameters as measured
in the principal axis frame.
3.1.4 Caveats When Performing Constrained Hartree-Fock Calculations
Three-dimensional, symmetry unrestricted calculations are preferable for describing the atomic
nucleus, but performing such calculations does not come without difficulties. Several prob-
lems encountered when integrating the ALM to enforce shape constraints in the solver Sky3D
will be briefly discussed.
3.1.4.1 Exploring The Space of Nuclear Configurations and Masking
Due to the choice of basis used in Sky3D, the wave functions are in principle free to explore
the entire space within the numerical grid. As the Hartree-Fock minimisation will converge
upon stationary points, instances may occur where multiple energy minima exist for a desired
expectation of 20 (they may have, for instance, different octupole or hexadecapole deforma-
tions). The CHF calculation will have no bias to converging in either minimum. Multiple
minima may correspond to competing fission pathways, which can differ significantly in en-
ergy. When performing CHF calculations to obtain the quadrupole PES, it is preferable to
explore fission pathways separately, rather than having configurations jumping between two
or more minima. It is this jumping between fission pathways that is the main criticism Refs.
[32, 33] present regarding the calculation of fission barriers using CHF.
Clearly, the most thorough way to explore the space of nuclear configurations is to enforce
multi-dimensional constraints. For example the macro-micro calculations performed in Ref.
[30, 32, 33] simultaneously constrain the elongation, mass asymmetry, left and right fragment
deformation, and the neck thickness of the nucleus, resulting in the order of millions of
possible configurations. As the number of constraints increases, the ambiguity in describing
the nuclear shape will lessen. Unfortunately, calculating this many configurations within a
self-consistent microscopic framework would require an unrealistic amount of time. Future
modifications to Sky3D could reasonably increase the number of simultaneous constraints to
two, in line with the solver HFODD [47].
For the results presented in this thesis, where only one constraint is applied upon the
quadrupole degree of freedom, a masking procedure has been adopted. This limits the space
3.1 Shape Constraints
which the nuclear wave functions can explore, allowing a single fission pathway to be explored
where the nuclear shape gradually evolves, rather than abruptly jumping between competing
energy minima.
The masking function M(r) is a Fermi function which equals unity inside the nuclear
surface, and transitions smoothly to zero outside of the nucleus. It is included when cal-
culating the expectation value of the multipole deformation parameters. This effectively
removes contributions from the wave functions which extend far beyond the nuclear surface
when determining the expectation value of the deformation parameters. This function must
be chosen carefully to allow room for the density to change shape as the iterative procedure
moves from one constrained configuration to the next.

Figure 3.4: Masking procedure. Panel i) shows a slice of the particle density in the xz plane.
The binary mask shown in panel ii) is represented with a value of 1 if the grid point is inside
the nuclear surface, and 0 if the point is outside. The masking function shown in panel iii) is
then used to mask the particle density when calculating the expectation value of the deformation
parameters. See text for more details.
A robust strategy to define M(r) uses an autonomously updating mask (see Fig 3.4),
which has been applied successfully in the axially symmetric Hartree-Fock solver SKYAX
[88]. At each iteration, the maximum value of the isoscalar density max is determined. A
grid point inside the nucleus is defined as one where (x, y, z)  max
, and all others are
3. INITIAL CONDITIONS
outside. A binary array corresponding to the density may then be stored, which is true for
grid points inside the nucleus, and false outside.
The next step is to determine for every grid point the minimum distance to the nuclear
surface. This is a costly process, requiring the order of (NxNyNz)2 operations. However,
one can check to see if the nuclear surface has changed at each iteration. If it has not, then
recalculation of the mask is not necessary. With the minimum distance to the nuclear surface
of each grid point, D(xi, yi, zi), stored in an array, the masking function can then be defined
M(x, y, z) =
1 + exp [(D(x, y, z) ) /]
, (3.5)
where
D(x, y, z) =
+D(x, y, z), D outside
D(x, y, z), D inside
. (3.6)
The parameters  and  modulate how rapidly the mask tails off at the nuclear surface, and
typical values were chosen to be 3.5 and 0.5 fm, respectively.
This masking technique can adjust to the changing nuclear shape over a PES without
manual input. However, one must be aware that the definitions of the deformation parameters
will change slightly every time the mask readjusts, which in some rare occasions caused
convergence problems.
Due to the nature of the mask being fixed to grid points, this method was found to
be unsuitable for use when measuring observables in large amplitude TDHF calculations,
requiring an alternate strategy to be adopted. For dynamic calculations, the mask is defined
relative to a fixed distance from the centre of mass (see Chapter 4). The masking strategy
described in this Section generally proved to give good results for CHF calculations, and has
been adopted for the results presented in this Chapter.
3.1.4.2 Defining Odd-l Deformation Parameters
When defining the principal axis co-ordinate system with respect to the quadrupole tensor,
one must be aware that odd-l deformation parameters can only be determined up to an abso-
lute sign. This is due to the unrestricted nature of the 3D calculations performed. Conversely,
even-l deformation parameters are insensitive to mass asymmetry along the principal axis.
For example, consider an octupole deformed nucleus in the case where the principal axis
z aligns with the lab z axis. The measurement of 20 will be identical, regardless of whether
3.2 Test Case: 46Ti
the positive z axis points in the direction of the positive or negative z axis. However, as the
definition of odd l deformation parameters contain a factor of z raised to an odd power, the
measurement of 30 will differ by an absolute sign depending on which direction the positive
principal axis points along. A consistent definition of 30 can be judged by examining the
particle density.
3.2 Test Case: 46Ti
The nucleus 46Ti was chosen as a test case for implementing the ALM in Sky3D, selected
as a sample nucleus expected to show a well-deformed global minimum. Due to the fact
that it is a relatively light nucleus compared to those in the actinide region, calculations
are less computationally demanding, and methods for investigating fission using Sky3D can
be relatively quickly tested and verified before applying the framework to cases of greater
interest.
Relatively few investigations of fission in this mass region have been performed. Light
nuclei are stable to spontaneous fission, and require large excitations to induce the process.
The fission of 44Ti has been studied via a 280 MeV fusion reaction of 32S+12C44Ti [126,
127]; the composite system was excited enough to allow fission decays to become energetically
possible. This leads to the expectation that the calculated fission barrier for 46Ti will be large.
Additionally, as the nucleus is significantly lighter than those in the actinide region, the PES
would not be expected to display the double-humped structure typical of actinides.
3.2.1 Specifics of the Calculation
The ground state and constrained Hartree-Fock calculations were performed using the SkM
effective interaction [128] in a regularly spaced Cartesian grid of 36 36 36 points, ranging
from 17.5 fm to 17.5 fm in the x, y, and z directions. The interaction SkM is fitted,
amongst other nuclear structure properties, to fission barrier data, which makes it a logical
choice to use in this investigation. Traditionally the interaction contains a centre of mass
correction, which has been neglected.
Pairing was implemented using the BCS scheme, assuming a volume-delta interaction.
The number of single-particle wave functions was chosen to span to 50 proton and 50 neutron
states. Pairing strengths V0 were 258.96201 and 279.08200 MeV for neutrons and protons,
3. INITIAL CONDITIONS
respectively [96]. The quadrupole deformation parameter 20 was constrained in the range
0.150 to 1.40, incrementing in steps of 0.03. The ground state was calculated initially in an
unconstrained Hartree-Fock minimisation to serve as a starting point for the calculation of
the PES. Some ground state properties are listed in Table 3.1.
Table 3.1: Brief summary of ground state properties of 46Ti, calculated using the SkM Skyrme
effective interaction. Further details of the calculations are included in the text. The ground
state is prolate deformed and axially symmetric.
Nucleus Binding Energy rms Radius 20 30 40
[MeV] [fm]
46Ti -379.68 3.555 0.171 0.000 0.100
The Lagrange multiplier  used to apply the constraint using the ALM was initially set
to zero, and the stiffness constant c was initially set to 50. The measurements of the density
were masked when performing the calculations, as described in Sec. 3.1.4.1. Convergence
was defined when the absolute difference between the desired and current expectation value
of 20 was less than 106, and the fluctuations in the single-particle energies were less than
104, averaged over the 30 most recent iterations.
Once a state was converged upon, the Lagrange multiplier was reset to zero, and the
stiffness constant c to 50. The desired value of 20 was increased, and the process repeated
for the next state, using the previous configuration as the starting point for the calculation.
3.2.2 Results
The quadrupole PES for 46Ti is shown in the top left panel of Fig. 3.5. As expected, the
results imply that 46Ti is highly stable against fission decay, with a calculated potential barrier
height in the order of 50 MeV. The system eventually fissions into two symmetric 23Na nuclei,
where beyond this point the total binding energy of the system begins to increase once more
as the two fragments separate. Throughout the PES, triaxial and octupole deformations are
negligible. An interesting feature as the nucleus necks to the point of scission is a back
bending of the hexadecupole deformation parameter 40 (top right panel of Fig. 3.5). This
can be explained from the definition of the parameter (see Appendix B, and Fig. 3.2). As
the neck vanishes, the hexadecupole deformation initially decreases. However, as the two
fragments separate in space, the z4 term dominates, causing 40 to rapidly increase once
more.

Overall, reasonable results have been obtained, verifying the implementation of the ALM
in Sky3D. The method may be applied to investigate actinides or heavy nuclei within studies
of nuclear fission.
3.3 Benchmark Case: 240Pu
The reproduction of the double-humped fission barriers of actinide nuclei are often used as a
benchmark test for nuclear models [61]. Due to wealth of data available from experimental
[115, 116, 117, 118] and theoretical [23, 33, 46, 129] studies of the nucleus, 240Pu presents itself
as a strong candidate for a benchmark test of TDHF to investigate induced nuclear fission.
The static quadrupole constrained PES will firstly be calculated to provide a selection of
initial states for time evolution.
3. INITIAL CONDITIONS
3.3.1 Specifics of the Calculation
The ground state and constrained Hartree-Fock calculations were performed using the SkM
effective interaction in a regularly spaced Cartesian grid of 40 40 40 points, ranging from
19.5 fm to 19.5 fm in the x, y, and z directions. The fission barrier properties of 240Pu were
considered when fitting the SkM effective interaction [128]. Flocard et. al published the
first self-consistent calculations of the barrier for the nucleus in 1974 using the SIII effective
interaction [46]. The interaction SkM was applied to barrier calculations by Bartel in 1982
[128], and was further optimised, resulting in the SkM interaction. Both the early studies
imposed axial symmetry, and in the case of the calculations by Flocard, reflection symmetry
perpendicular to the elongation of the nuclear was enforced. The double-humped structure
of the PES was reproduced in both cases, and measurements of the barrier heights may be
used for comparison to this work.
Pairing was once again included within the calculation; 184 neutron and 126 proton single-
particle wave functions were used. The pairing strengths adopted were the same used as in
the 44Ti case discussed previously. Due to the existence of a prominent local minimum in
the PES (corresponding to the fission isomer), by choosing a highly prolate deformed initial
harmonic oscillator width, Hartree-Fock calculations were found to converge in this minimum
without imposing shape constraints.
Table 3.2: Brief summary of some ground state and isomer properties of 240Pu, calculated using
the SkM Skyrme effective interaction. Further details of the calculations are included in the
text. Both the ground state and isomer are prolate deformed and axially symmetric.

240Pu -1778.91 6.418 0.682 0.000 0.547
This provided two initial points for the CHF calculations, starting at either the ground
state or isomeric state to explore the PES. Some properties of the ground state and isomer are
presented in Table 3.2. Flocard and Bartel reported ground states of greater binding energy
in their work; -1801.5 and -1822.6 MeV, respectively. The differences may be attributed
to several factors. Firstly, adoption of different Skyrme effective interactions may lead to
significant differences. Additionally, the calculation performed in this work contained no
3.3 Benchmark Case: 240Pu
centre of mass correction. Pairing correlations were treated differently, as Flocard chose the
pairing strength to be proportional to the surface of the nucleus, whereas Bartel adopted
a constant pairing matrix element. Further, the method used to apply the constraints was
different; we use the Augmented Lagrangian Method, whereas the Quadratic Penalty Method
was used in early CHF investigations (see Sec. 2.4). The early calculations performed also
enforced spatial symmetries. In principle, this should not have any effect as the ground state
and isomer as they do not demonstrate any triaxial deformation or reflection asymmetries,
but the enforced symmetry may have some effect upon the numerics of the calculation, and
will certainly have an effect upon the calculated fission barriers.
3.3.2 Results
The PES for 240Pu is shown in Fig. 3.6. As the PES is far more complex than the case of 46Ti,
a colour scheme has been imposed to correspond to measurements of the different multipole
parameters for the same configuration. Two fission barriers are seen in the quadrupole degree
of freedom (top left panel of Fig. 3.6), peaking at 20 = 0.50 and 0.86 respectively. The
ground state and isomeric state correspond to the two minima in the PES next to these
barriers. Table 3.3 presents a comparison between various features of the PES calculated in
this work to results presented in References [46], [128], [33] and [129]. The Table contains
measurements of the fission barrier heights and energy difference between the ground and
isomeric state, as defined in Fig. 3.1.

Figure 3.6: Resulting PES for 240Pu following a constraint of the quadrupole deformation
parameter 20. Once the second barrier has been passed, a significant octupole deformation
(corresponding to mass asymmetry) develops. The isolines in the 2D slices of the 3D density
correspond to 0.05 particles/fm3. It is interesting to note that even for states far beyond the
second barrier, scission has not yet occurred.
When comparing the mean-field calculations of this work with that of [129] (Table 3.3),
a difference in EA and EB of the order of 1 MeV is found. This could be attributed to
the difference in effective nuclear interaction adopted, and further, the HFB calculations of
[129], in principle, treat pairing correlations more completely than the CHF calculations of
this work. The barrier calculations of Flocard [46] determine EA to be of a similar value to
this work, which is somewhat surprising, as the axial symmetry enforced in the calculations
would be expected to produce a barrier approximately 1-2 MeV higher. This demonstrates
that there are other significant differences in the calculations compared to this work. The
difference in effective interaction, the treatment of pairing and the centre of mass correction
are factors which may contribute significantly. The second barrier height (EB) of Ref. [46] is
3.3 Benchmark Case: 240Pu
almost double that of this work, which is unsurprising as reflection symmetry was enforced,
removing the possibility of the calculations to explore octupole deformed shapes.
The barrier heights obtained by Bartel et. al are in agreement to within  1 MeV of this
work, which is perhaps unsurprising due to the similarities between the interactions SkM and
SkM. The differences can likely be attributed to factors such as the treatment of pairing and
any centre of mass corrections. As reflection asymmetry could be explored, EB is significantly
lower than the result presented by Flocard. The value obtained for EII is notably lower than
any of the other results, which is perhaps surprising.
Upon comparing the results of the mean-field calculations to those of the macroscopic-
microscopic calculations (shell-corrected Finite-Range Liquid Drop Model), the values of EA
and EB presented are 2-4 MeV lower for the macroscopic models. The differences likely stem
from the ingredients of the different models; in the mean field calculations the only param-
eters are those defined in the Skyrme interaction and those which define the treatment of
pairing. In the macroscopic-microscopic calculations, the energies are defined by the fixed
five-dimensional parameterisation [33], whereas in principle the mean field calculations ex-
plore an infinite dimension deformation space. When comparing the calculated values to
experimental data, the lower values of EA, EB and EII presented in Ref. [33] agree more
closely to the experimental values. It must be emphasised, however, that the experimental
values are extracted in a model-dependent manner from fission cross section data. Assump-
tions made when extracting the barrier heights from this data will have implications upon
the deduced values [26]. Therefore, assessing the merits of a PES calculation based solely
upon reproducing these values may be inadvisable.
Figure 3.6 shows a prominent octupole deformation setting in at the second fission barrier
(top middle panel), as would be expected [61]. The relationship between the quadrupole
and octupole deformation parameters for the configurations along the PES is shown in Fig.
3.7 (top left panel). Although the calculations have been performed constraining only one
deformation degree of freedom, the behaviour observed is typical for the optimum static
fission pathway obtained in quadrupole-octupole constrained deformation surfaces calculated
using DFT [48, 50].
Figure 3.7 also displays the relationship between the quadrupole and hexadecupole de-
formation parameters (top right panel). Near the peak of the first and second barrier, the

Figure 3.7: Octupole deformation as a function of quadrupole deformation (top left) and

PES of 240Pu. The octupole deformation, corresponding to a mass asymmetry, rapidly onsets
after the second fission barrier is passed. The bottom right panel shows the Bohr-Mottleson 
parameters for the calculated states, which confirm that triaxility is explored significantly in the
region of the first fission barrier.
hexadecupole deformation is seen to sharply drop, then recover. This corresponds to a tran-
sitioning shape as the neck region of the nucleus thins. By increasing the quadrupole defor-
mation beyond these points, the elongation of the state increases, which allows the value of
40 to increase once more as the z4 term in the hexadecupole operator dominates.
The 3D calculations verify that triaxialty is explored at the first fission barrier. This is
demonstrated by observing a non-zero measurement of  when calculating the Bohr-Mottleson
 deformation parameters (lower left panel of Fig. 3.7). This shows the barrier is not only
defined for 20. Being able to explore this degree of freedom lowers the calculated barrier
height with respect to axially symmetric calculations [61]. Triaxiality is explored significantly
in the range 0.36  20  0.59. Other than the region corresponding to the first barrier,
trixiality is virtually negligible, therefore  = 20. Even for the resulting states where  is
non-zero,   20.
One interesting comparison to the results of the calculations for Ti (Fig. 3.5) is that
the Pu nucleus has not fissioned in the range of 20 considered, even for states beyond the
3.3 Benchmark Case: 240Pu
second fission barrier. The slices of the density shown in Fig. 3.6 display an increasingly
deformed shape rather than two separate fragments. Due to a competing fission pathway,
the PES could not be explored all the way to the point of scission (see Sec. 3.3.3). Despite
the emergence of this competing fission pathway, a large selection of increasingly deformed
states have been obtained. These range from configurations with a quadrupole deformation
less than that of the global Hartree-Fock minimum, to configurations well beyond the second
fission barrier.
3.3.3 Competing Fission Pathways
When performing constrained Hartree-Fock calculations, it was noticed that once the quadrupole
deformation was increased beyond 20 = 1.25, the configuration jumped abruptly to a com-
peting fission pathway. This behaviour was due to the numerics as the calculations converged
and proved to be unavoidable, even when adopting the masking procedure described in Sec.
3.1.4.1. This can be explained by considering the density slices presented in Fig. 3.8; a
mask around the one-fragment configuration will not inhibit a transition to the two-fragment
configuration, as the two-fragment configuration fits in the one-fragment masking region.
The competing fission pathway was explored, starting from the state after the calculations
jumped pathway. From this configuration, the deformation was incrementally reduced. This
competing pathway is shown in Fig. 3.8, coloured in blue, and may be compared to the
original pathway, which is coloured in red. Once the quadrupole deformation was reduced
below 1.01, the Hartree-Fock minimum was observed to jump back onto the original fission
pathway.
The competing pathway, referred to as the two-fragment pathway in Ref. [129], displays
remarkably different configurations to that of the one-fragment pathway. Even with identical
quadrupole deformations, the octupole and hexadecupole deformations, and total energy
differ significantly. It is exactly this behaviour that the authors of Refs. [33] and [32] identify
as a flaw when using CHF to explore the PES. However, this flaw may be exploited in this
instance to gain an insight of a competing fission pathway, without having to include a higher
number of constraints in the CHF calculations.
Unlike the case of 46Ti, which cleanly splits upon fission in the CHF calculations (Sec.
3.2.2), the fragments in the two-fragment pathway do not have an integer particle number.

Figure 3.8: One (red line) and two-fragment (blue line) fission pathways for 240Pu. The arrows
in the top left panel show which direction the PES was explored in. Beyond 20 = 1.25 the
one-fragment pathway jumps into the two-fragment pathway, and this state was used for the
initial configuration for investigating the latter pathway. Sample density slices on the competing
pathways with the same 20 are shown in the lower panels. The isolines are seperated by 0.05
particles/fm3.
For example, for the case of 20 = 1.19, the fragments have A1, Z1 = 107.14, 43.14, and
A2, Z2 = 132.85, 50.85 (to two decimal places). All the fragments in the two-fragment
pathway correspond, to the nearest integer particle number, to 10743 Tc and
51 Sb. It would be
instructive to project the individual fragments onto a good particle number [131]. This would
give access to a mass distribution, but such an analysis is beyond the scope of this work.
It warrants mention that the mass distributions of the two-fragment solutions differ signif-
icantly from the experimentally observed distributions: the most probable mass split for ther-
mal neutron-induced or photon-induced fission in 240Pu is A  100 and A  140 [115, 116].
A discussion of the significance of the intercept of the one and two-fragment pathways in
light of TDHF fission results will be presented in Sec. 4.1.4.
Overall, a large selection of constrained Hartree-Fock states have been determined for
240Pu. The calculations provide qualitatively consistent results to other modern mean-field
investigations of 240Pu [129]. They present themselves as initial configurations to commence
an investigation of induced fission using time-dependent Hartree-Fock.
Time Evolution of Constrained
Hartree-Fock States
The time evolution of the constrained Hartree-Fock (CHF) states obtained for 240Pu (as
described in Chapter 3) may be investigated using the time-dependent Hartree-Fock method.
The analysis will focus on the states on the one-fragment fission pathway, starting from
configurations beyond the fission isomer (that is, those with 20 > 0.68). This Chapter
will investigate the effect of releasing the imposed shape constraints and time evolving the
constrained static states, to gain an insight of the deformation-induced fission (DIF) process
as described by time-dependent Hartree-Fock.
The Sky3D code provides the capability to time-evolve the static Hartree-Fock states
obtained in the previous Chapter. As the single-particle wave functions remain orthogonal,
dynamic calculations can be performed efficiently using Message Passing Interface (MPI) on
high performance computing facilities [57]. At every time step, the wave functions can be
allocated onto separate nodes, where the time iteration may be performed. After all the wave
functions have been iterated one step, they can be collected to obtain the densities, which in
turn define the time-dependent single particle Hamiltonian.
TDHF calculations may be performed in a larger grid than that used to calculate the
initial (static) state. The Slater determinant, which is a solution to the CHF problem, is
placed in a grid of of dimension (NxNyNz) with its centre of mass at (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0). The
wave functions are set (close) to zero for all the space which exceeds the dimensions of the
static solution. The wave functions are then re-orthonormalised before time evolution begins.
One important consideration is that excited states will decay by particle emission in
TDHF. This corresponds to the dispersion of the wave functions as time evolves. The dimen-
4. TIME EVOLUTION OF CONSTRAINED HARTREE-FOCK STATES
sions of the grid and the boundary conditions will have some effect upon the measurements
of observables, as the single particle wave functions, especially those of emitted particles, are
free to explore the entire space of the calculation. Spherical TDHF calculations can be per-
formed in a continuum [132, 133]. Some attempts have been made to reproduce continuum
calculations in 3D, but the methods are computationally expensive and may not be suitable
for large amplitude processes [134, 135].
When analysing the nuclear dynamics, a masking procedure is once more adopted to
define the nucleus. This allows contributions to the observables from the tails of the wave
functions to be eliminated. This ensures that consistent results are obtained with different
choices of grid dimension. This mask was chosen to be of the form of a Fermi function, in
line with the masking procedure described in Chapter 3 for the static case. A generalisa-
tion becomes necessary in the dynamic case as the fragments in a post-fissioned system will
propagate through space. For dynamic calculations, the mask is defined by a fixed distance
from the centre of mass, which is not necessarily a grid point. This is in contrast to the mask
described by Eq. (3.5), which was computed relative to discrete grid points. If the mask
is defined relative to grid points, as the fragments propagate through space, the mask will
jump between grid points, resulting in a slight discontinuity in the time evolution of any
measurements performed.
For a fissioning system, once the system splits into two fragments, a separate mask is
defined for each fragment. This will be discussed in more depth in Sec. 4.2. For the non-
fissioning case, the mask is chosen so that the initial measurement of the integrated particle
density for the deformed 240Pu state contains over 239.9999 particles at time t = 0 fm/c.
The time evolution of the CHF solutions yielded two general cases. Firstly, where the
nucleus is sufficiently deformed so that the repulsive Coulomb interaction is able to drive the
configuration to fission. Secondly, states which fail to fission. The non-fissioning case will be
discussed first.
4.1 Non-Fissioning States
A selection of states along the one-fragment PES (Fig. 3.6), starting from just beyond the
static fission isomer (20 = 0.682), were evolved using TDHF. For these calculations, the
initial static Slater determinants were placed in a grid of 42  42  42 points, ranging from
4.1 Non-Fissioning States
20.5 to 20.5 fm in the x, y and z directions. The states were evolved in time up to 9000
fm/c. The time increment was chosen to be t = 0.25 fm/c, and 8 terms were used in the
expansion when applying the time evolution operator (see Sec. 2.6).
The non-fissioning static configurations which will be presented are in the range 20 = 0.710
to 1.07. Due to the different masking approach used in dynamic calculations compared to
the static calculations the initial values at t = 0 of the multipole deformation parameters
differ slightly. As we shall see, differences in the time evolution due to, for instance, pairing
neglect are no larger than than 1%.

Figure 4.1: Time evolution of multipole deformation parameters from different initial states (the
corresponding 20 of the static state is labelled). Note that for the initial states with 20 = 0.71
and 0.77, the octupole deformation is negligible for the time elapsed in the calculation.
The time evolution of the multipole deformation parameters for the non-fissioning states
are compared in Fig. 4.1. From a brief inspection of the Figure, it can be seen that the
evolution of the quadrupole deformation parameter is unique for each state presented (that
is, the lines in the top left panel never cross). This suggests that the TDHF wave functions
for each configuration are exploring a different minimum in quadrupole deformation space.
The distinct differences in the evolution of the non-fissioning states, which arise depending
on whether the initial state is deformed below or beyond the second static fission barrier, will
be explored.

The time evolution of the multipole deformation parameters for three states with an initial
quadrupole deformation below the second static fission barrier (which peaks at 20 = 0.860)
are shown in Fig. 4.2. For all cases, the initial static solutions have an almost negligible

octupole deformation. Upon time evolution, the elongation of the nucleus (measured by
the quadrupole deformation parameter) reduces to a certain extent. This may be seen,
for example in the top left panel of Fig. 4.2, where quadrupole deformation reduces from
 0.71 to  0.695 within 200-300 fm/c. The initial drop in elongation corresponds to a
rearrangement of the density: within time-dependent calculations energy is conserved, but
collective motion and internal excitations are allowed. Additionally, pairing is not included in
the time-dependent calculations. The initial deviation of nuclear shape could be due to the
fixed occupation approximation adopted in the dynamic calculations. In other words energy
is being rearranged, in which case density oscillations are expected.
Following the initial decrease in elongation, a behaviour which resembles a collective giant
resonance begins. This is characterised by the small-amplitude, high-frequency vibrations in
4.1 Non-Fissioning States
the quadrupole and hexadecupole deformation (left and right columns of Fig. 4.2).
For the case with static deformation 20 = 0.71 (top row of Fig. 4.2), the octupole defor-
mation of the nucleus remains negligible throughout time evolution. This is unsurprising, as
the initial state displays mass symmetry between the upper and lower halves of the nucleus.
As no external field is applied which breaks this symmetry, no octupole deformation will
develop during the TDHF calculation [21]. In contrast, the state with initial deformation
20 = 0.77 (middle row of Fig. 4.2) shows evolution of the octupole deformation oscillating
about zero. The amplitude of this vibration is small: the octupole deformation throughout
time evolution is practically un-noticeable when examining the particle density. Additionally,
the frequency of vibration is far slower than that of the quadrupole and hexadecupole param-
eters. Although in principle odd and even-l vibrational modes may couple in non-spherical
nuclei [136, 137], due to the differences in frequency it appears that the l = 3 mode is not
coupled with the l = 2 or l = 4 mode.
For the state with initial deformation 20 = 0.83 (bottom row of Fig. 4.2), the octupole
parameter has an initial value very close to zero, but upon time evolution a dramatic evolution
of the nuclear shape occurs. The nuclear shape explores a slowly alternating mass asymmetry,
oscillating about zero octupole deformation. The quadrupole deformation displays a drift
due to the moving centre of mass of the system. This effect is not visible in the evolution
of the hexadecupole deformation parameter, as the higher order terms in the definition of
the parameter (proportional to z4) drown out this effect. The initial configuration is close to
the peak of the static fission barrier (see Fig. 3.6), and the dynamics demonstrate that mass
asymmetry begins to be explored significantly at this point.
An instructive way to examine the excitation modes of a nucleus undergoing a small am-
plitude collective excitation is to perform Fourier analysis. This transforms the signal from
the time into the frequency (and therefore energy) domain, allowing a decomposition of the
dominant collective excitation modes corresponding to the oscillations of the nuclear shape.
Historically, some studies of Giant Resonances have been performed by calculating a con-
strained Hartree-Fock minimum, and observing the behaviour upon releasing the constraint
and time-evolving the wave functions [138].
Typically, when Fourier analysis is applied, it is to investigate the response of the nucleus
to a specific excitation, delivered in the time profile f(t), to obtain a strength function
4. TIME EVOLUTION OF CONSTRAINED HARTREE-FOCK STATES
[21, 139, 140]. Practically, within TDHF calculations, this is determined by computing the
expectation of an observable  as a function of time
(t) = (t) ||(t) . (4.1)
This is then Fourier transformed into the frequency domain:
() =
eit(t) dt , (4.2)
as is the time profile of the function which provides the excitation, thus obtaining f(). The
strength function is then defined by:
S() = 
()
f()
. (4.3)
In the case investigated in this thesis, however, there is no well-defined strength function
as no initial excitation is applied to determine the corresponding nuclear response. Instead,
the spectral power function
P() =
Re ()
Im ()
(4.4)
is defined. As it will be shown in the following, this will serve to identify the dominant
collective excitation energies of the nucleus.
To obtain the spectral power, the evolution of the multipole moments must be centred
around zero. Further, any drifts of the central values of the multipole moments associated
to a spurious nuclear motion need to be eliminated. For the cases presented in Fig. 4.2, this
is a simple procedure which can be done by performing an average fit to the evolution of
the deformation parameters. This fit is then subtracted from the evolution of the multipole
moments. For the case of the quadrupole deformation parameter for the state with initial
20 = 0.83 (bottom left panel of Fig. 4.2), two Gaussian functions have been fitted and
subtracted to remove the drift caused by the moving centre of mass.
From the results of this subtraction process (shown in Fig. 4.3), the spectral power can
be obtained. Figure 4.4 shows the resulting power spectrum. For the case of the octupole
power spectrum for initial 20 = 0.83, not enough signal was present to perform the Fourier
transform (bottom centre panel of Fig. 4.2).
In the process to obtain the power spectra, a windowing technique was used to force
the signal to reduce to zero by the end of the calculation time to suppress any artefacts

[57]. The resolution of the spectra is defined by the measurement time, and is of the order
~ = 
[139]. Some authors smooth the power spectrum to eliminate the fragmentation,
which may be caused by boundary condition effects. This procedure may further be justified
when comparing to experimental data, as detectors have a finite resolution. For the results
presented, however, no such smoothing will be applied, as it is not necessary when identifying
the dominant excitation modes.
The qualitative features of the evolution of the multipole moments and their corresponding
power spectrum presented so far may be compared to one another. The quadrupole power
spectra for the cases of 20 = 0.71 and 0.77 have in common a strong peak at 4 MeV (top
left and middle left panels of Fig. 4.4, respectively). Additionally, both show a second well-
defined peak. For evolution of the state with deformation 20 = 0.71 the second peak is
around 1 MeV (top left panel of Fig. 4.4), whereas for evolution of the state with deformation
20 = 0.77 the second peak lies between 6-7 MeV (middle left panel of Fig. 4.4). For the case
with initial deformation 20 = 0.83, the dominant quadrupole excitation mode lies slightly
higher, between 4-6 MeV.
In all three cases, the dominant peaks in the hexadecupole spectra lie at the same ener-

gies as those in the quadrupole spectra (comparing the left and right columns in Fig. 4.4).
This feature is expected due to the strong coupling between quadrupole and hexadecupole
excitation modes.
A low-energy peak is visible in the octupole power spectrum for the evolution of the state
with initial deformation 20=0.77 (middle centre panel in Fig. 4.4). The peak is sharp, corre-
sponding to very well-defined mode. The peak lies away from the energies of any excitation
modes attributed to quadrupole or hexadecupole vibrations, verifying that the octupole mode
seen in Fig. 4.2 (middle row) is not coupled with the quadrupole or hexadecupole modes.
As mentioned, no power spectrum could be calculated, due to the lack of signal, for the
evolution of the octupole deformation for the state with initial deformation 20 = 0.83. It
can be seen in the bottom centre panel of Fig. 4.3 that the oscillation undergoes half a cycle
in approximately 7000 fm/c, which would correspond to a collective excitation energy in
the region of 0.1 MeV. This sits far away from any excitation energies corresponding to the
quadrupole or hexadecupole modes for this state (bottom left and bottom right panels of Fig.
4.4).
For comparison, a benchmark calculation of the collective giant quadrupole resonance
4.1 Non-Fissioning States
(GQR) of 240Pu has been performed. Figures 4.5 and 4.6 show the evolution of the de-
formation parameters for the ground state and isomeric state following an instantaneous,
small-amplitude, isoscalar boost applied via a quadrupole field. The power spectrum is
shown, rather than the strength function, for direct comparison to Fig. 4.4. In both cases,
the density remains mass symmetric throughout the time evolution, therefore no octupole
power spectrum is obtained.

Figure 4.5: Evolution of quadrupole and hexaducople deformation parameters for the ground
state of 240Pu following a small amplitude, isoscalar, instantaneous quadrupole boost (top). The
bottom panels show the corresponding power spectrum.
For the GQR calculations, in the quadrupole power spectrum both for the ground state
and isomeric state, the dominant excitation mode lies between 4 and 5 MeV (Figs. 4.5 and
4.6, bottom left panels). This is directly comparable to the quadrupole power spectrum
determined from the evolution of the deformed static states, shown in Fig. 4.4 (left column).
The common peak in the spectra around the same energy could be interpreted as a GQR. The
quadrupole and hexadecupole spectra for the ground state GQR spectra shows a secondary
peak around 10 MeV (Fig. 4.5), which is not observed in any of the spectra in Fig. 4.4, or
that for the isomer GQR (Fig. 4.6).
There are other dominant excitation modes in the quadrupole and hexadecupole spectra
presented in Fig. 4.4 that do not appear in the spectra corresponding to the ground state
GQR (Fig. 4.5). However, peaks are observed in the spectra corresponding to the isomer GQR

at these energies, as well as the dominant mode around 4 MeV (Fig. 4.6). In other words,
for the three states investigated in this Section, the system oscillates collectively around a
quadrupole minimum with similar properties to that of the isomer GQR, rather than that of
the ground state GQR.
Qualitatively, a picture of the evolution of collective excitation modes with increasing
deformation can be observed in Fig. 4.4. The quadrupole and hexadecupole excitation modes
appear to couple strongly together in all cases, which is unsurprising when considering the
shapes that the multipole deformations physically correspond to. In the only case where
the octupole power spectrum could be extracted, the excitation frequency is significantly
different to the quadrupole and hexadecupole modes, demonstrating that the l = 3 mode is
not coupled strongly to the even-l modes.
4.1.2 Evolution of the State at the Peak of the Static Fission Barrier
The time evolution of the static state at the peak of the second fission barrier (20 = 0.86) is a
case of interest. If the static barrier has physical implications regarding fission, the evolution
of the states at the peak of the barrier would be expected to display behaviour different to
those deformed below the barrier.
4.1 Non-Fissioning States
Figure 4.7 displays the evolution of the multipole deformation parameters for the state
with initial deformation 20 = 0.860. Unfortunately, the calculation became numerically
unstable beyond 4000 fm/c. As the non-fissioning states presented in the previous Section
could be evolved safely up to 9000 fm/c (Fig. 4.2), it can be speculated that this is due
to a non-linear behaviour as the configuration evolves, and the state is indeed a point of
significance along the PES.

Figure 4.7: Time evolution of multipole parameters for the state at the peak of the static fission
barrier (20 = 0.860). A significant rearrangement of the nuclear shape is seen to occur.
Some features of the evolution may be commented upon. The development of the octupole
deformation is perhaps the most striking feature. Like the case evolved from the static state
with 20 = 0.83 (Fig. 4.2, bottom row), which lay just below the peak of the barrier, a
significant octupole deformation is explored The initial state with 20 = 0.86 has a very small
mass asymmetry (30  0.01), which develops as the nucleus rearranges configuration upon
time evolution to oscillate about 30  0.2.
In contrast to the state evolved from 20 = 0.83, the octupole deformation seems to begin
to explore an energy minimum at a non-zero value, rather than slowly oscillating about zero.
This implies that there is a more favourable configuration which may be explored in TDHF.
Quadrupole and hexadecupole oscillations are also observed as the state is evolved in time,
with a drift corresponding to the evolution of the octupole deformation as the centre of mass
4. TIME EVOLUTION OF CONSTRAINED HARTREE-FOCK STATES
adjusts significantly (left column of Fig. 4.7). Not enough signal is present to calculate a
power spectrum. Qualitatively, the oscillations in the quadrupole and hexadecupole mode
correspond to a collective excitation energy of 4 MeV, which is similar to that observed for
the excitation peak shared in common in the quadrupole and hexadecupole spectra for all
three states in Fig. 4.4 (and also in the ground state and isomer GQR spectra (Figs. 4.5 and
4.6)). A transitionary behaviour is undergoing in the evolution of this state; as well as giant
resonance-type behaviour occurring in the quadrupole and hexadecupole modes, the nucleus
is undergoing a large amplitude rearrangement in the octupole degree of freedom.
Fission is not observed in the time scale for which the calculation was performed. An
investigation of the time evolution of those initial states deformed beyond the static fission
barrier (that is, initial 20 > 0.86) will be presented in the next Section.
4.1.3 Evolution of States Beyond the Static Fission Barrier
Beyond the peak of the static fission barrier, the time evolution of several increasingly de-
formed initial states still failed to display fission within 9000 fm/c. This is perhaps surprising,
as naively one may have assumed that the static barrier corresponds to the threshold for fis-
sion. The evolution of the multipole deformation parameters for these states is presented in
Fig. 4.8.
Qualitatively, one observes dramatically different behaviour in the time evolution of the
multipole deformations for these states compared to Fig. 4.2. The elongation is seen to rapidly
increase during the first 300-500 fm/c of time evolution (corresponding to an increase 20,
left column of Fig. 4.8). The most extreme case is seen in the bottom left panel of the Figure,
where the quadrupole deformation increases from 20  1.07 to 20  1.11 in this time. This
is in contrast to that seen for the evolution of states below the static fission barrier (left
column of Fig. 4.2), where the initial quadrupole deformation was seen to decrease within the
first 200-300 fm/c, and in the most extreme case the initial drop in 20 was less than 0.02.
Beyond the initial increase in elongation, Fig. 4.8 displays slow, large amplitude oscil-
lations setting in. Compared to the states below the static fission barrier (Fig. 4.2,) these
oscillations are substantially slower. They will correspond to lower energy modes in a power
spectrum.

Figure 4.8: Time evolution of multipole parameters for initial states which were solutions to
the CHF calculations (labelled on the right hand side). All of the initial states are deformed
beyond the peak of the static fission barrier (20 > 0.86).
For the initial configurations with 20 = 0.89 and 0.95 (first and second rows from the
top in Fig. 4.8), the behaviour of the quadrupole deformation is more complex than the other
two cases (20=1.01 and 1.07). The evolution of the quadrupole deformation for these cases
(20 = 0.89 and 0.95) shows a regions of rapid increase, then an oscillation about a plateau,
then another rapid increase followed by another plateau.
An octupole deformation is also observable in all cases (centre column of Fig. 4.8). This is
unsurprising in itself, as the initial configurations are significantly octupole deformed. How-
ever, an interesting feature is noticeable for the evolution of the states with initial deformation
20 = 0.95 and 1.01. The changes in octupole deformation are roughly in phase with either
the evolution of the hexadecupole parameter, or both the quadrupole and hexadecupole pa-
rameters. For the giant resonance cases observed previously (Fig. 4.2) the octupole modes
did not seem to be coupled strongly with the quadrupole or hexadecupole modes. This fea-
4. TIME EVOLUTION OF CONSTRAINED HARTREE-FOCK STATES
ture, in addition to the other differences observed between the evolution of the multipole
deformations above and below the fission barrier, could suggest that the mechanism driving
the dynamics is different, and not typical of a giant resonance. This point will be elaborated
shortly.

Figure 4.9: The time evolution of the multipole moments (Fig. 4.8) have been centred around
zero, and will be used to obtain power spectra. The order of the polynomial fitted to the data
has been noted. See text for more details.
Fourier analysis can be applied analogously to the procedure in the previous Section. The
subtraction procedure to centre the oscillations about zero is far more challenging here. Figure
4.9 shows the evolution of the multipole deformation parameters following the subtraction.
The polynomial order of the function fitted to the data and subsequently subtracted is stated
on the Figure. These fits ranged from a constant fit (0th order) to a 4th order polynomial. A
similar procedure has been used to eliminate spurious motion for systematic investigations
of the GQR in Ref. [107].
The resulting power spectra are shown in Fig. 4.10. These differ drastically to those seen

for the evolution of states below the static fission barrier (Fig. 4.4). Qualitatively, the power
spectra for all three deformation parameters show dominant excitation modes at low energies
(below 2 MeV), and secondary excitation modes still at energies far below what was observed
for the states below the fission barrier (Fig. 4.4). One must be cautious when interpreting the
spectra presented in Fig. 4.10. Although great care has been taken to centre the evolution of
the multipole moments about zero, any remaining drift in the original signal will cause low
energy artefacts to appear in the power spectrum.
Several results have been obtained so far which suggest that the mechanism driving the
evolution of the nuclear shape differs significantly when starting from a configuration below
or beyond the barrier. The evolution of the state with initial deformation 20 = 1.01 will
be used to illustrate the hypothesised mechanism which drives the dynamics for the non-
fissioning states beyond the second fission barrier.

of the state with 20=1.01. The density can be seen to be rearranging during the time
evolution, and a striking feature is seen beyond 6000 fm/c. The nucleus begins twisting
and rotating; energy is being transferred from potential energy into collective kinetic and
rotational energy1. This behaviour has been observed in other studies [141]. The slow, large
amplitude oscillatory behaviour of the multipole deformation parameters (second row from
bottom of Fig. 4.8) suggests that, due to the Coulomb repulsion between the upper and lower
lobes, the nucleus is attempting to fission. This is in line with the macroscopic model of
Bohr and Wheeler [20], where the effect of the charge on an incompressible liquid drop is a
crucial ingredient to describe the fissioning process. Within macroscopic liquid drop models,
the surface term competes with the repulsive Coulomb force to inhibit fission; it costs energy
to form an increasingly deformed shape. The TDHF calculations present a similar behaviour,
1this observation should be investigate further to ensure that it is not caused by the numerics of the
calculation

but the mechanism is microscopically and not phenomenologically included.
Within the TDHF calculations, energy is transferred into collective motion as the nucleus
attempts to rearrange into a configuration where it is able to fission (Fig. 4.11). Figure 4.12
displays the current vectors j(r), corresponding to Fig. 4.11. The 2D vectors of the x  z
component of the current is a useful aid when interpreting the dynamics of the system. As
the current vectors in the different panels of Fig. 4.12 are normalised to the same length,
they may be directly compared to one another. They display a significant rearrangement
of the particle density throughout the time evolution. The vectors show a particle flow that
demonstrates the top and bottom lobes of the deformed nucleus are not moving in phase with
one another, which suggests they are behaving like separate, interacting, fragments rather
than a single nucleus. At some points (such as 8250 fm/c), the magnitude of the current
4. TIME EVOLUTION OF CONSTRAINED HARTREE-FOCK STATES
vectors is far greater, demonstrating translational motion as well as collective excitations as
the nucleus rearranges. All in all, this further shows that the behaviour is not typical of a
collective giant resonance, and that a different mechanism is driving the nuclear dynamics.
To strengthen the picture that the dynamics of the nucleus are due to competition between
the repulsive Coulomb and attractive terms in the energy density functional, the contribution
to the total energy of the system from the Coulomb energy (defined in Sec. 2.3.2) is shown
in Fig. 4.13 throughout the time evolution for two cases. The Figure displays the evolution
of the Coulomb energy for the state with deformation 20=0.71, which is below the static
fission barrier and undergoes giant resonance-type behaviour (left panel), and for the state
with 20 = 1.01, which is beyond the static fission barrier (right panel).

deformed state lies below the second static fission barrier, and the more deformed state beyond.
See text for further discussion.
For the giant resonance cases observed where the state is initially deformed below the
static fission barrier (Fig. 4.2), the strong force drives the collective nuclear excitations. For
the state with initial deformation 20 = 1.01, the oscillation of the Coulomb energy coincides
with the oscillations of the deformation parameters shown in Fig. 4.8. The Coulomb force
increases the elongation, causing the total Coulomb energy to reduce as the charged lobes
of the deformed nucleus move apart. The attractive terms in the energy functional then
draw the nucleus back together, causing the Coulomb energy to increase once more as the
elongation reduces. Due to this effect dominating over small amplitude resonances, all three
of the deformation parameters are seen to follow large amplitude oscillations in phase with
one another (second row from the bottom in Fig. 4.8).
4.1 Non-Fissioning States
Figure 4.13 (left panel) displays that the fluctuations in the Coulomb energy for the
evolution of the state with 20 = 0.71, which is undergoing a collective giant resonance. The
fluctuations in the Coulomb term are small compared to where the initial state is deformed
beyond the fission barrier (right panel of Fig. 4.13). For these giant resonance cases, the
fluctuations in the Coulomb energy follow the small amplitude vibrations in the nuclear
shape as the proton density rearranges. For the cases beyond the barrier, it is the Coulomb
term which is driving the large amplitude oscillations of the nuclear shape.

Figure 4.14: With no Coulomb interaction, the time evolution of the initial configuration 20 =
1.01 displays high-frequency, small amplitude vibrations in the quadrupole and hexadecupole
degrees of freedom. As the static configuration was calculated with the Coulomb interaction, the
overall deformation of the nucleus collapses as the Coulomb force played a significant part in
defining the initial configuration.
For illustrative purposes, the calculation evolving the state with initial 20=1.01 is re-
peated without the Coulomb interaction. The resulting evolution of the multipole deforma-
tion parameters is shown in Fig. 4.14. Unsurprisingly, the figure shows a rapid decrease in
elongation. This is as the static configuration was calculated with the Coulomb interaction;
removing this will cause the nucleus to collapse into a more stable configuration. Most im-
portantly, on top of the rapidly decreasing quadrupole and hexadecupole deformations, a
small amplitude, high-frequency oscillation can be observed (left column in Fig. 4.14), which
was not present in the corresponding panels in Fig. 4.8. The frequency of these vibrations in
4. TIME EVOLUTION OF CONSTRAINED HARTREE-FOCK STATES
the quadrupole and hexadecupole modes are qualitatively similar to those seen for the giant
resonance cases (Fig. 4.2).
Overall, there is significant evidence suggesting the origins of the mechanism responsible
for the slow, large amplitude oscillations of the nuclear shape observed for non-fissioning con-
figurations beyond the static fission barrier. It lies in the competition between the Coulomb
force trying to cause fission, and attractive nuclear potential terms in the energy functional
countering this effect. As the states are evolved in time, they begin to explore significant
collective motion as the nucleus attempts to find a pathway towards fission. It can only be
speculated as to whether with a long enough time evolution the states eventually fission.
Figure 4.8 shows, for example, in the bottom left panel (evolved from 20=1.07), that the
quadrupole deformation oscillates around a gradually increasing average. This increase is
very slow, and performing a TDHF calculation to explore time evolution beyond 10,000 fm/c
will be computationally expensive, and may begin to encounter numerical instabilities.
For the evolution of the states below the static barrier (Sec. 4.1.1), the required tunnelling
through the barrier implies a forbidding time scale for fission within TDHF. For the non-
fissioning cases investigated in this Section, where the initial deformation exceeds that of the
second static fission barrier, the time scale for fission is at the very least inhibiting when
performing TDHF calculations.
4.1.4 Intersection of the One and Two-Fragment Fission Pathways
One striking characteristic of the static one and two-fragment pathways is the intersection
point that separates those initial states which fission upon time evolution from those which
do not (states undergoing deformation-induced fission will be investigated in the next Sec-
tion). Figure 4.15 displays this. The separating line (drawn between 20=1.07 and 1.10 on
Fig. 4.15) between the inhibiting and allowed regions for fission does not correspond to a
threshold in the dynamic calculations. Figure 4.8 displays, for example, that the state with
an initial deformation just below the separating line can evolve dynamically to a state with
deformations beyond this very same line, but without fissioning (see Fig. 4.8, bottom row).
For configurations starting with a deformation below the static fission barrier (20 <
0.860), tunnelling is required to reach a fissioned state. This is forbidden in TDHF calcula-
tions. Beyond the barrier, it has been seen that there exists a region where fission is inhibited,

Figure 4.15: Static one and two-fragment fission pathways (red and blue lines, respectively).
For TDHF calculations three regions may be defined when following the one-fragment pathway;
one in which fission is forbidden within TDHF time scales, one in which the time scale is in-
hibiting, and one which fission is allowed. The dividing lines are drawn at 20 = 0.860 and
20 = 1.085. See text for more details.
and it will shortly be demonstrated that beyond the intersection of the one and two-fragment
pathways, fission is allowed within the considered time scales of the TDHF calculations. An
intuitive explanation may be given for the significance of this point of intersection on the
PES with regard to fission occurring upon time evolution.
In TDHF, energy is conserved. It is due to the inclusion of excitations (internal and
translational) that nuclear configurations may change upon time evolution. For the states
which undergo fission (allowed region in Figure 4.15, 20 > 1.085), for a given value of 20,
the two-fragment state is more bound than the one-fragment state. Therefore, for a one-
fragment state to evolve into a two-fragment configuration at a constant 20, energy must
be transformed from potential energy into excitation energy, which is allowed. Of course,
the picture is not really that simple as the significance of the static PES becomes less clear
in the dynamic case. Other configurations may be explored which do not correspond to the
static fission pathways. Further, a slight change of configuration will be required to move
from the static one-fragment state to a fissioned configuration. In other words, the exact
configurations on the two-fragment pathway cannot be reached dynamically from the one-
fragment pathway, but an excited two-fragment configuration of a similar deformation can.
The intuitive reasoning presented is that as the static two-fragment state is more bound than
the corresponding one-fragment state, the optimum TDHF trajectory is to evolve the one-
4. TIME EVOLUTION OF CONSTRAINED HARTREE-FOCK STATES
fragment static state towards an excited fissioned configuration by undergoing only a modest
rearrangement of the nuclear shape.
In the inhibited region of Fig. 4.15 (0.86  20  1.085), for a given 20 in the one-
fragment pathway, the two-fragment state with the same 20 is less bound. Due to energy
conservation, the one-fragment state cannot move to the two-fragment state at the same
20. The only way to reach a two-fragment solution of equal binding energy (or an excited
configuration with greater binding energy) is through a significant change in deformation and
rearrangement of the nuclear state, which accounts for the inhibiting time scale for fission to
occur.
Further investigation of the link between static and dynamic configurations using Den-
sity Constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock [60, 85], would certainly be of interest. This
method allows the dynamic configurations to be frozen, removing internal and collective ex-
citations, thus bridging between static and dynamic configurations. A study of this nature,
however, is beyond the scope of this thesis.
4.2 Fissioning States
For the static states with a quadrupole deformation at and beyond the threshold of 20 = 1.10,
binary fission was seen to occur as the wave functions were evolved in time. The calculations
to obtain the data for this Section were performed in a larger grid of size 4848160 points,
corresponding to 79.5 to 79.5 fm in the z direction, and 23.5 to 23.5 fm in the x and
y directions. The calculations were set to end once the separation of the centre of mass of
the two fragments exceeded 100 fm. This cutoff avoids spurious effects due to the fragments
approaching the grid boundaries.
Figure 4.16 shows the typical time evolution of the particle density for the fissioning case
by presenting 2D slices of the 3D density at various times for the state with initial deformation
20 = 1.19. The scission point is difficult to define in a calculation involving quantum
mechanical wave functions and densities. We take an operational approach and define it as
the time when the point of minimum density between the fragments along the principal axis
of the system is less than 0.05 particles/fm3. As we shall see in the following, this is also

separating. For the case where the initial quadrupole deformation is 20 = 1.19 (presented

in Fig. 4.16), it takes between 775-800 fm/c for the density between the two fragments to
drop below this threshold. Figure 4.17 displays sample current vectors corresponding to the
particle density slices presented in Fig. 4.16. The current vectors display the system smoothly
transitioning into a two-fragment configuration; compared to Fig. 4.12 there is no dramatic
rearrangement of the particle density during time evolution. Throughout the calculation, the
currents in two preformed fragments are clearly distinguishable, and do not interact with one
another. The central region has negligible current, and the two lobes stretch against each
other. The magnitude of the current vectors in Fig. 4.17 gradually increases as the fission
occurs; beyond the point of scission they will increase rapidly as the fragments accelerate
away from one another.
The states with static deformation 20 = 1.10, 1.13, 1.19 and 1.25 were evolved in time
to investigate the fission of the different initial configurations. The time evolution of the

multipole moments for these states are shown in Fig. 4.18. These measurements have been
sharply cut off at the point of scission. An analysis of the post-scission fragments will be
presented in Sec. 4.3. Figure 4.18 shows the evolution of the nuclear shape up to the point of
fission for the considered initial configurations. Different nuclear shapes are explored as the
nucleus evolves from the various static states. Other than the case with static 20 = 1.25, as
20 and 40 increase, 30 remains virtually constant.
The chosen dynamic pathway towards fission, depending on how the particles rearrange
during the time evolution, may have significant consequences upon the properties of the
post-fission system. This will produce a range of fission fragments, depending on the initial
configuration which is time-evolved. Once again, this differs from the static case, where
CHF calculations following the one-fragment fission pathway will only produce one resulting

fissioned configuration. The distribution of fission products obtained with TDHF is in line
with experimental investigations (see Sec. 4.3).
The time scale required for the initial configuration to fission varies. The least elon-
gated case, with 20 = 1.10 takes  1250 fm/c for scission to occur. Figure 4.18 shows
the quadrupole deformation increasing rapidly for approximately 600 fm/c (red line in the
Figure). Between 600-1200 fm/c, the rate of increase in quadrupole deformation reduces as
the nucleons rearrange out of the neck into the upper and lower fragments. Small oscillations
in the octupole deformation can be seen as the system transitions into the preferred config-
uration. Beyond 1200 fm/c, the neck rapidly vanishes as the fragments take form and begin
to separate, resulting in the rate of increase of the quadrupole and hexadecupole parameters
to accelerate.
For more deformed initial states, the time taken to fission is significantly shorter. This
can be explained as the initial configuration has fewer particles in the neck region. Upon time
evolution, less rearrangement is required for the two fragments to take form, and the Coulomb
interaction rapidly drives the configuration to fission. The most extreme case investigated is
4. TIME EVOLUTION OF CONSTRAINED HARTREE-FOCK STATES
that with initial deformation 20 = 1.25. Figure 3.6 shows the initial density for this state
(bottom right panel Fig.), and it seems that two fragments are already taking form, connected
only by a thin elongated neck which rapidly dissipates into the top and bottom fragments
upon time evolution.

Figure 4.19: Evolution of the decomposed energy density functional for the fissioning systems.
The calculations are terminated when the fragments are separated by 100 fm. For reference, the
vertical lines in the panels corresponding to the kinetic energies show the scission point. The
total energy is conserved within fluctuations no greater than 4 MeV.
The evolution of the decomposed contributions to the energy density functional for the
fissioning cases are presented in Fig. 4.19 (see Sec. 2.3.2 for the definitions of the terms).
The decomposed energy density functional for the entire system is shown; the fragments will
4.2 Fissioning States
be analysed separately in Sec. 4.3. Figure 4.19 displays the evolution of the energy density
functional up to and beyond the point of scission. Total energy is conserved within the TDHF
calculations, within fluctuations of less than 4 MeV (shown on the bottom right panel of Fig.
2.3.2).
The dynamic calculations allow translational motion and internal excitations. For the
energy released in the fissioning case, nuclear binding energy is expected to be transformed
mainly into the translational kinetic energy of the fragments. The following definition is
usually employed in calculating the nuclear collective kinetic energy [57],
Ecoll. kin. =
j(r)2
dr , (4.5)
from the particle density (r) and the current density j(r). This collective kinetic energy
contains contributions from internal excitations of the nucleus, such as resonant excitations,
and the translational kinetic energy of the post-fission fragments. It is presented in Fig. 4.19
(second panel from the bottom, right column), separately from the total kinetic energy. It is
difficult to untangle the collective excitation energy attributed to the internal excitation of the
fission fragments, to that attributed to translational motion. In fission reactions the energy
release is typically attributed to 80% in the form of translational energy, and the other
20% is released in the form of  rays, prompt neutron emission and radioactive decays of
the fragments [4]. In our TDHF calculations, these effects may not be described. Therefore,
we will demonstrate that the excitation energy of the fissioned system is dominated by the
translational kinetic energy, with a small contribution from internal collective excitation of
the fragments. This will be discussed in Section 4.3.4.
During time evolution, the individual components of the energy functional may be sepa-
rately examined. The physical interpretation of the evolution of each term of the integrated
energy functional shown in Fig. 4.19 may not necessarily be simple. It is useful to identify
which densities contribute to the separate terms to qualitatively explain the behaviour of the
energy functional (see to Sec. 2.3.2):
 The E0 and E3 terms: Both these terms are derived from the particle density. Although
the total particle number is conserved throughout time evolution, the local particle
density varies significantly during the fission process. As particles rearrange from one
into two fragments, a neck region of low density emerges, resulting in a decrease in
4. TIME EVOLUTION OF CONSTRAINED HARTREE-FOCK STATES
magnitude of both terms. Upon scission, the magnitude of these contributions rapidly
increases as two dense local regions, corresponding to the two fragments, emerge. For
both the E0 and E3 terms, the energy varies over a range of approximately 400 MeV
during the time evolution of the considered states.
 E1 term: The E1 term contains contributions from the kinetic, particle, and current
densities. The term looks qualitatively similar to the E0 and E3 terms (although the
E0 term is negative). This suggests the that density that governs the E0 and E3 terms,
the particle density, is also the most relevant contribution governing the E1 term. In
comparison to the E0 and E3 terms, the energy varies over a much smaller range of
approximately 25 MeV during time evolution.
 E2 term: The E2 term contains the Laplacian of the particle density, and is commonly
associated with a surface term. As the particles rearrange into the two fission fragments,
this term increases in magnitude. This can be intuitively explained as the two-fragment
system will have a combined surface region which is greater than that of the initial
configuration. The gain in energy for this term up to the point of scission is dependent
upon the deformation of the initial configuration; it is seen to increase by as much as
45 MeV for the static configuration with 20 = 1.10.
 Coulomb term: The Coulomb energy is determined from the distribution of the charged
protons. The magnitude of the Coulomb term slowly decreases as the nucleus elongates.
At the point of scission, the rate at which the term reduces rapidly accelerates as two
charged fragments separate from one another in co-ordinate space. At infinite fragment
separation, the Coulomb term will reduce to the contributions of the Coulomb energy
for each nucleus, without further interactions. The reduction in the term is of the order
of 200 MeV as the system evolves.
 Kinetic and Collective Kinetic terms: The kinetic energy can be determined from inte-
grating the kinetic density. As mentioned above, the contribution to this energy from
collective motion (assumed to be predominantly translational beyond scission, rather
than internal collective excitation) can be decomposed according to Eq. (4.5). The
collective energy is initially small, corresponding to the internal currents as the nucleus
slowly rearranges into a fissioned configuration (see inset in collective energy panel).
4.2 Fissioning States
The state with initial deformation 20 = 1.10 shows the most gradual transition to
fission. An initial increase then decrease in collective energy is seen before scission,
which corresponds to the (previously discussed) rapid initial elongation, then extended
rearrangement phase as the configuration evolved (see Fig. 4.18). In contrast, the state
with 20 = 1.25 is already close to the point of scission, so that the Coulomb interaction
between the two lobes rapidly drives the configuration to the scission point (within the
first few hundred fm/c), where translational motion rapidly accelerates once the neck
ruptures. This shorter timescale could explain the more extreme behaviour observed in
the evolution of the other terms in the energy functional as the particles in the neck have
less time to rearrange into the two fragments. At the point of scission, the collective ki-
netic energy rapidly increases at a similar rate to the reduction in the Coulomb energy.
The threshold collective kinetic energy associated with the scission point is between 6
and 8 MeV in all the cases presented. The vertical lines corresponding to the scission
points are displayed in the panels corresponding to the kinetic and collective kinetic
energies in Fig. 4.19. The definition adopted for scission1 is justified by considering the
rapid increase of collective kinetic energy at this point. The gain in the total kinetic
energy beyond the scission point can be attributed to the gain in collective energy, and
is of the order of 150 MeV in the time considered. This relates to the loss in Coulomb
energy beyond the point of scission, as would be expected.
 Spin-Orbit term: The spin-orbit contribution contains complex contributions from dif-
ferent densities, making it hard to qualitatively identify how the different densities
contribute to the term. It is typically associated with shell effects, and the oscilla-
tions observed may indicate the importance of the term in the dynamic evolution of
the nuclear state. The final approximately constant values observed following scission
correspond to the sum of the two independent spin-orbit terms of the separate frag-
ments. The notably different behaviour of the term for the state with initial deformation
20 = 1.25, compared to the others, suggests different shell effects are acting. Indeed,
the masses of the fission products are significantly different from the other cases (see
Sec. 4.3.2). The term has significant contributions from time-odd densities, so that the
1time at which neck density is below 0.05 particles per fm3 along the principal axis of the system
4. TIME EVOLUTION OF CONSTRAINED HARTREE-FOCK STATES
evolution can explore configurations which may not be accessible on the static PES.
The term varies by less than 30 MeV during time evolution.
In experimental studies of fission, it is customary to measure the kinetic energy of the
fission fragments. We can find an analogous observable within TDHF making use of the
collective kinetic energy, defined by Eq. (4.5), and assume the translational kinetic energy
dominates this term. Referring to Fig. 4.19, the collective kinetic energy and Coulomb
energy are both expected to plateau as the separation of the two fragments becomes large.
Unfortunately, the Coulomb force is long-ranged; the energy due to the interaction of two
charged fragments reduces proportionally to 1
, where r is the separation. Increasing the
dimensions of the numerical grid is extremely computationally expensive. Therefore it is
preferable to interpolate the collective kinetic energies to a large time to estimate the value
as the separation r tends to .
A simple approximation to the time-dependent behaviour can be made from classical
mechanics. Let us assume two point-like fragments with charges Zu and Zl, and masses Mu
and Ml. If the two fragments fission from a ground state due to the Coulomb force, and
convert all this energy into translational kinetic energy, energy conservation implies:
l = 
. (4.6)
Here, M are the masses of the upper and lower fragments, v the velocity, and Z the charge.
The constant  is the Coulomb constant. As momentum must be conserved
Muvu +Mlvl = 0 , (4.7)
the Eq. (4.6) may be rewritten, substituting for vu
. (4.8)
For a given fissioned system, Mu,Ml, Zu and Zl are constant. A differential equation for

where all the constants are combined into . Performing the integration r

allows the solution
r3/2 = r
(t t0) (4.11)
to be written. According to this approximation, r is approximately proportional to t2/3. By
assuming that the loss in Coulomb energy is equal to the gain in collective kinetic energy
(that is , ECoul = Ecoll), a fit of the form
f(t) = a+
(t c)3/2
(4.12)
can be performed to interpolate the collective kinetic energy to larger values of t. Figure
4.20 shows a sample interpolation of the collective kinetic energy assuming the above form
for the case of initial deformation 20 = 1.10. The fit is performed over three time ranges:
once the centres of mass are separated beyond 30 fm, 50 fm and 60 fm, respectively. As the
separation tends to , the fit parameter a can be interpreted as the final collective kinetic
energy. Table 4.1 contains the values obtained for each of the fissioning cases with different
distance fits. As a crude method to represent the uncertainty in the value, the mean value
of the interpolated fits has been presented with the standard deviation as an uncertainty.

In comparison to the experimentally measured kinetic energy of the fissioning systems
displayed in Table 4.2, the theoretical values presented in Table 4.1 seem rather too high in
most cases. However, the experimental values correspond to an average kinetic energy. We
only have access to one single fissioning event per static state, and a larger sample of theo-
retical results would be required to enable a quantitative comparison. Further discussion of
methods to deduce the energy released by the fission reaction within TDHF will be presented
in Sec. 4.3.3.
4.3 Fragment Analysis
Beyond the point of scission, it is preferable to consider a two-fragment system. The pub-
lished distribution of Sky3D has some capacity to analyse two-fragment dynamics [57], and a
4.3 Fragment Analysis
version has been modified further to investigate the fissioning system and extract some useful
observables.
4.3.1 Masking
The masking procedure used to investigate the non-fissioning dynamic case can be generalised
to investigate the fissioning system. For a two-fragment system, the published version of
Sky3D measures the total quadrupole moment of the system and obtains the principal axis.
The dividing plane is then defined as that which is perpendicular to the point of minimum
density along the principal axis, as shown in Fig. 4.21. An interpolation is performed to
obtain this dividing plane, as the centre of masses of the two fragments may not necessarily
lie on integer grid points. Observables relating to the two fragments may then be deduced
by integrating the densities either side of the dividing plane.
Dividing Plane
Principal Axis
Figure 4.21: Two-fragment dynamics may be investigated by defining the dividing plane of the
system. The dividing plane is defined to be normal to the principal axis at the point of minimum
particle density.
This process is then taken taken a step further by adding a mask around each fragment.
The masks are of the form of a Fermi function (as used in all other cases), and are chosen to
extend to a fixed distance from the centre of mass of the fragments. They are recalculated
at every step to follow the movement of the fragment. One caveat of this method, however,
is that the masks must not overlap when measurements are taken (see Fig. 4.22, left panel).
In other words, the fragment analysis cannot begin at the point of scission: the particles
4. TIME EVOLUTION OF CONSTRAINED HARTREE-FOCK STATES
must be separated sufficiently before observables may be calculated. Once the fragments are
separated sufficiently so that the masks do not overlap (Fig. 4.22, right panel), the masks may
be used to integrate quantities of interest over the region defining the individual fragments.
These quantities include, for example, the particle number, the energy density functional and
the deformation parameters.

Figure 4.22: Demonstration of masking procedure used. The particle density is represented
with red isolines separated by 0.05 particles/fm3. The masking functions (blue) are spherical
Fermi functions around the centre of mass of the fragments. The isolines for the mask are (from
closest to the fragment outwards) 1, 0.1 and 0.01. Measurements of observables corresponding
to the individual fragments are only valid when the masks do not overlap (right panel).
4.3.2 Mass Distributions
As the post-fission fragments are excited, they may decay by particle emission. TDHF dis-
plays this decay by the dispersion of the wave functions from the region of central density
(corresponding to the nucleus). When masking the region around the nucleus, this decay re-
sults in a reduction in the integrated particle density over time. For the cases of deformation-
induced fission (DIF) examined in this Chapter, this decay is of the order of 0.1-0.2 particles
during the time evolution.
The dispersion of the wave functions, in addition to the fragments not having a well-
defined (i.e. integer) particle numbers, makes identification of the fission products difficult.
4.3 Fragment Analysis
In line with experimental studies, the pre-emission fragments should be identified. This may
be done by integrating the total density in each half of the numerical grid separated by the
dividing plane. For this process, the masking procedure is not applied. For consistency,
the measurement is taken as soon as the system identifies as a two-fragment system, that
is, when the density connecting the fragments along the principal axis drops below 0.05
particles/fm3. An uncertainty in the particle number of the fragments may be associated
with the fluctuation of this measurement throughout time evolution, which is less than 0.05
particles for the considered cases.

These fragment masses can be compared directly to experimental data. Table 4.3 displays
the resulting mass distributions obtained from this theoretical study. The two-fragment static
configuration is included for comparison (see Sec. 3.3). The Table also includes the particle

number rounded to the nearest integer: although it is beyond the scope of this thesis, it
would be of interest to project the individual fragments onto the particle number [131] to
obtain a distribution.
Table 4.4 contains experimental data taken from Refs. [115, 116] listing the most likely
masses of the fission fragments. The references study various fission processes in 240Pu,
including spontaneous fission, thermal neutron-induced fission, and various energy photon-
induced fission. The spontaneous fission data has been included for completeness.
It must be emphasised that fission produces a range of masses; the values quoted in
Table 4.4 correspond to the most likely fissioned configuration. Referring to Fig. 4.23, which
displays data for neutron-induced fission, the obtained theoretical values fall well within the
experimentally obtained mass distribution. The different distributions shown in the Figure
are for various energy neutron-induced fission; as the energy increases the distribution of
the fission fragments becomes, on average, more symmetric (the central region of the mass
distribution on the right panel of Fig. 4.23 can be seen to be filling in). The theoretical data
has been binned and normalised to the maximum value of each experimental data set so that
visual comparisons may be drawn. With the limited data set available, the TDHF results
seem to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data.

text for more details.
The result of the two-fragment static solution is also displayed on Fig. 4.23 for qualitative
comparison (see Sec. 3.3.3). Although the fission products lie within the mass region of the
4.3 Fragment Analysis
experimental data, for the various static two-fragment configurations the mass split was seen
to be constant (to an integer nucleon number). Time evolution of these two-fragment static
solutions will not produce a varying mass distribution as the fragments are already well de-
fined. The constant configuration of the two-fragment solution corresponds to an optimum
static two-fragment configuration. The variation (and therefore distribution) of post-fission
fragment masses will only arise due to the dynamic evolution of one-fragment static solu-
tions, allowing configurations which do not correspond to two-fragment static solutions to be
explored.
4.3.3 Energy of Fission Fragments
By applying masks around the spatial regions of the fission fragments, the energy density
functional corresponding to the individual fragments may be obtained. However, interpreting
the results is not simple in the two-fragment case. The nuclear part of the energy density
functional is short-ranged, allowing the functional to be integrated in the spatial region cor-
responding to the individual fragments. The Coulomb interaction, however, is long-ranged;
as well as the Coulomb interaction within the individual fragments, there is a contribution
from their interaction with one another. Further, the fragments were seen to decay by par-
ticle emission, which will also impart some time dependence upon the integrated energy
corresponding to the individual fragments.

4. TIME EVOLUTION OF CONSTRAINED HARTREE-FOCK STATES
The time evolution of the total integrated energy functional corresponding to the heavy
(upper) and light (lower) fission fragments is shown in Fig. 4.24. The time measurement at
tsep = 0 begins when the fragments are sufficiently separated such that the masks no longer
overlap (see Fig. 4.22). To a good approximation, the fragment total energies are constant,
but a slight drift is observed over time due to the long-range effects of the Coulomb interaction
and particle decay. Only the total integrated energy of the post-fission fragments is shown in
Fig. 4.24; the evolution of the decomposed terms corresponding to the individual fragments
showed no remarkable behaviour. The fragment energy at the cutoff time will be denoted
The total excitation energies of the fragments (which is the sum of the translational and
internal collective kinetic energies) may be examined in comparison to calculations of the
corresponding ground states. This method will complement the approach of interpolating
the total collective kinetic energy of the system, as presented in Sec. 4.2, and should produce
comparable results.
The solver Sky3D has been applied to deduce the ground states of the fission fragments
(to the nearest integer particle numbers). Here, it is debatable that the energy functional in
Sky3D contains all the terms required to calculated odd-odd and odd-even nuclei. The full
time-odd contribution is presented in Ref. [77], and the functional in Sky3D does not include
all these terms. However, as the functional used for the static calculations is consistent with
that applied to dynamic calculations, Galilean invariance is conserved. The functional used in
Sky3D therefore satisfies all the invariance properties required to perform static calculations
of odd-odd and odd-even nuclei, even if the functional is not in its most complete form.

using the SkM interaction. The fragment total energy at the cutoff time is denoted by E (see

4.3 Fragment Analysis
Pairing has been neglected in these calculations. For odd numbers of protons or neu-
trons, the blocking approximation [21] must be applied if pairing is to be included. This
approximation removes one state from the pairing scheme. An element of trial and error is
required to determine which state must be removed. However, the total pairing contribution
to the energy functional will typically be of the order of 010 MeV, which is small compared
to the excitation energies in the fissioning case. Therefore, for a qualitative comparison of
the excited state energy to the ground state energy, it is not unreasonable to neglect this
correlation.
Two measurements of the total excitation energy of the system are now performed, either
by interpolating the evolution of the collective kinetic energy, or by comparing the ground
state fragment energies to the excited fragment energies. Figure 4.25 displays the mean
interpolated collective kinetic energies presented in Table 4.1, compared the total fragment
excitation energy (Eheavy frag. + Elight frag.) for each fissioning case. The error bars in the
values of E display an uncertainty of 10 MeV, which serves to take into account that pairing
was not included for the ground state calculations, and also that only nearest-integer nuclei
are considered. For the interpolated collective energy, the values presented are the mean
of the three interpolations performed at different fragment separations, with the standard
deviation taken for the error (see Table 4.1).

Figure 4.25 shows that within the error bars, the results from the two techniques produce
4. TIME EVOLUTION OF CONSTRAINED HARTREE-FOCK STATES
consistent values of the energy released in the fission process. It would be of interest to obtain
these values to a greater accuracy, both by performing the calculations up to the point where
the Coulomb interaction is negligible, and obtaining ground state energies incorporating
pairing correlations. It is interesting to note that the measurement E is always lower,
which may indicate a systematic effect worth further investigation. As mentioned, these are
both measures of the total excitation energy of the system. Section 4.3.4 will demonstrate a
technique which may be used to decouple the translational kinetic energy from the internal
collective excitation energy.

Figure 4.26 shows experimental measurements of the kinetic energy reproduced from Ref.
[116] for thermal neutron-induced fission in 240Pu. The range of collective kinetic energies
deduced in this Chapter are marked with a shaded box. By attributing the deduced total
excitation energies solely to translational kinetic energy, this assumes that the internal collec-
tive excitation of the fragments are comparatively small. This will be demonstrated shortly.
Despite the limited sample of theoretical data, the results agree well with the experimental
range of values.
4.3.4 Collective Excitation Modes of Fission Fragments
As mentioned, the excitation energy of the fission fragments is assumed to be dominated
translational kinetic energy. However, as well as translational motion, the fragments un-
dergo collective vibrations due to internal excitation. The collective excitation modes of the
4.3 Fragment Analysis
fragments may be investigated using the same procedure which was applied to the excited
non-fissioning nuclei, as discussed in Sec. 4.1. Unfortunately, due to the limitations in the
numerical grid size (the z direction spanned 160 grid points, ranging from -79.5 to 79.5 fm),
a signal corresponding to the evolution of the multipole parameters of the individual frag-
ments could only be measured for approximately 1000 fm/c before the grid boundaries were
approached. For a signal of this length, the resolution of the calculated power spectrum is of
the order ~ = 
[139], giving an energy resolution of approximately 1.5 MeV for a signal
lasting 1000 fm/c.
A novel approach was developed to extend the measurement time. Rather than performing
the calculations in an unpractically large numerical grid, a Galilean transformation will be
applied to the fission fragments to remove their linear momentum. The evolution of the static
configuration with 20 = 1.25 will be presented as an example.
Inside the masked regions of space corresponding to the fragments, the linear momentum
may be calculated (not containing the nucleon mass) by integrating the current density:
pfrag =
j(r)dr . (4.13)
This momentum therefore has units of velocity [57]. The linear momentum of the fragments
may then be instantaneously removed by applying the following Galilean boost to the single
particle wave functions:
(r) = exp
i(pfrag.r)
Afrag
(r) , (4.14)
where Afrag is the integrated particle density corresponding to the fragment, and (r) are
the single-particle wave functions. The Galilean transformation should be applied in the
masked region of space with the corresponding momentum for each fragment. The effect of
the transformation is to effectively boost the particles in the opposite direction with the exact
momentum they are propagating with.
Figure 4.27 shows the decomposed energy functional for the fissioning case with initial
20 = 1.25. The Galilean transform was applied when the separation of the fragments reached
100 fm, and the calculation terminated at separation 105 fm. Upon application of the trans-
formation, the panels corresponding to the total energy increases in absolute magnitude
by approximately 140 MeV as the collective kinetic energy drops by the same amount. This

corresponds to the excitation energy of the system due to translational motion being instanta-
neously removed. This invariably demonstrates that the total excitation energy is dominated
by contributions from translational motion, rather than internal collective excitations.
The collective kinetic energy drops instantaneously to  1.1 MeV following the trans-
formation (see inset panel corresponding to collective kinetic energy in Fig. 4.27). As the
translational energy is removed at this point, this remaining collective energy is the sum of
the internal excitation energy shared between the two fragments. Reference [53] discusses an
4.3 Fragment Analysis
alternative method to deduce the internal collective excitation energy of the fragments, but
the method applied assumes a priori knowledge of the fission products of the system.
The internal collective excitation energy is small compared to the total excitation en-
ergy released in the fission process, deduced to be  180 MeV (see Fig. 4.25, 20 = 1.25).
This justifies the previous assumption that the final collective excitation energy deduced in
TDHF is dominantly translational kinetic energy, so it may therefore be compared to the
experimentally measured kinetic energies (Fig. 4.26).
The energy functional (Fig. 4.27) may be compared to that in Fig. 4.19, where the calcu-
lation was terminated at the point where the transformation is applied in this case. Figure
4.27 demonstrates that the nuclear potential part of the energy functional is unaffected by
the transformation. The calculation was performed in a grid of identical dimensions to those
presented in Fig. 4.19 (48  48  160 points), and the time elapsed has effectively doubled
from those previous calculations. As the measurement time of the post-fission fragments has
been elongated, the resolution of the resulting power spectra will be enhanced accordingly.
As the Coulomb interaction is long-ranged, even at 100 fm separation there is an interac-
tion between the fragments. Translational motion resumes after the Galilean transformation
is applied, and the translational kinetic energy slowly increases (can be seen by the gradual
increase of the collective kinetic energy in Fig. 4.27 following the transformation). Therefore,
the centre of mass separation eventually reaches 105 fm and the calculation is terminated.
In principle, one could re-apply the Galilean transformation at every iteration to extend the
time of the calculations to an even greater extent.
The evolution of the multipole deformation parameters are shown in Figs. 4.28 and 4.30,
corresponding to the heavy and light fragment, respectively. The calculated power spectra are
shown in Figs. 4.29 and 4.31. The resolution of the spectra is approximately 0.6 MeV, which
is a significant improvement of the resolution of 1.3 MeV that would be obtained without
extending the measurement time.
Within the resulting spectra presented for the heavy fragment in Fig. 4.29, there is a
well-defined peak for each multipole parameter between 1-3 MeV. For the light fragment,
Fig. 4.31 shows a well-defined peak for each multipole parameter between 4-6 MeV. Another
noteworthy feature of the spectra is that both Figs. 4.29 and 4.31 share a defined peak in
the quadrupole spectra at 4 MeV. This suggests that the two fragments share an excitation

Overall, this Chapter has presented a variety of fission products resulting from deformation-
induced fission processes, with different excitation characteristics. Within the results de-
scribed by TDHF, DIF seems to be a slow, gradual process, where the collective energy
is small up until around point of scission. At this point, the translational kinetic energy
rapidly increases. This translational kinetic energy corresponds to the dominant form of en-
4. TIME EVOLUTION OF CONSTRAINED HARTREE-FOCK STATES
ergy release (> 99% in the case examined). The experimentally measured neutron-induced
fission products and kinetic energies compare well with the results obtained using TDHF.
This demonstrate the potential of applying time-dependent Hartree-Fock to describe fission
phenomenon within a fully microscopic framework.
Boost-Induced Fission using
Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock
This Chapter is concerned with investigating methods which induce fission for initial con-
figurations where the process is either forbidden or inhibited within the time scale of time-
dependent Hartree-Fock (see Fig. 4.15). This will be referred to as boost-induced fission
(BIF), in contrast to the cases of deformation-induced fission (DIF) presented in the previous
Chapter.
Large-amplitude collective motion may be induced by applying an external field to the
system. A reasonable choice for this external field is one which will provide a quadrupole
excitation, in line with References [55, 56]. The external excitation field may be applied
instantaneously, or within a time-dependent profile. Both cases will be discussed.
5.1 Instantaneous Velocity Boosts
An external field may be instantaneously applied to the system at t = 0 by applying the
gauge transformation ei(r) to the single-particle wave functions. This corresponds to a
velocity boost which carries the profile of (r). The spatial profile, (r), is chosen here to
be proportional to a quadrupole field. Due to the gauge invariance of the Skyrme interaction,
the energy added by this boost is purely in the form of collective kinetic energy [78, 143] (see
Appendix A).
Two initial configurations will be investigated; the fission isomer of 240Pu (20 = 0.682),
and a state just beyond the peak of the second fission barrier, with static deformation
20 = 0.890. The isomer sits in a region where fission is forbidden within TDHF time
5. BOOST-INDUCED FISSION USING TIME-DEPENDENT
HARTREE-FOCK
scales, whereas the state with deformation 20 = 0.890 sits in the region where fission is
inhibited within the timescale of feasible TDHF calculation (see Fig. 4.15).
5.1.1 Application of an Instantaneous Quadrupole Excitation Fields
To investigate BIF, an instantaneous quadrupole excitation field will firstly be applied to the
static isomeric state. The current vectors j(r) resulting from the application of this velocity
field at t = 0 are shown in Fig. 5.1, alongside the particle density.

field applied instantaneously to the isomeric state (20 = 0.68) at time t = 0. The current vectors
have been normalised to a visually instructive length.
The energy added by the instantaneous excitation field may be calculated in a straight-
forward manner due to the simple form of the quadrupole operator (see Appendix A). The
scaling factor  may be chosen to provide an excitation of Ekin using the relation

Figure 5.2 shows the evolution of the deformation parameters following quadrupole veloc-
ity boosts applying different amounts of energy to the isomeric state. In all cases an initial,
rapid increase in quadrupole deformation may be seen within the first 50 fm/c (top left panel
of Fig. 5.2). Following this, for an excitation below the threshold energy required to induce
5.1 Instantaneous Velocity Boosts
fission, the nucleus draws back to its original quadrupole deformation, and then begins low
frequency, large-amplitude vibrations (red, green and blue lines in Fig. 5.2). As the initial
configuration is mass symmetric, and the excitation was of a pure quadrupole nature, no
octupole deformation is induced as the mass symmetry is conserved (top right panel of Fig.
5.2).

In all cases, the evolution of the hexadecupole deformation demonstrates that the nucleus
necks significantly between 100-150 fm/c, which can be seen by the characteristic drop in
magnitude as the elongation increases (bottom left panel of Fig. 5.2). This was seen in the
evolution of the static configurations for the constrained Hartree-Fock (CHF) calculations
presented in Fig. 3.7. This behaviour was not observed in the DIF cases (Fig. 4.18), as
the initial configurations were deformed such that they were already displaying significant
necking.
Figure 5.2 shows that the threshold energy for inducing fission with this field is 175 
Ethresh.  200 MeV. This can be seen clearly in the evolution of 20 (top left panel in Fig. 5.2,
purple line). Above the threshold for fission, the quadrupole deformation gradually increases
(whilst oscillating) as the system moves to a fissioned configuration. These oscillations in the
quadrupole deformation parameter were not seen for the DIF cases investigated, where the
5. BOOST-INDUCED FISSION USING TIME-DEPENDENT
HARTREE-FOCK
system smoothly evolves to a fissioned configuration (see Fig. 4.18). These oscillations may
be interpreted as an effect due to the large excitation energy applied, and will be commented
upon further shortly.
Figure 5.3 displays slices of the 3D particle density for various times for the fissioning
case (200 MeV excitation) presented in Fig. 5.2. The resulting mass symmetry of the fission
fragments suggests that this process is not inducing fission in a manner comparable to DIF,
where a range of fission products with asymmetric masses were observed, which agreed well
with sample experimental results (see Fig. 4.23).

Figure 5.3: 2D slices of the 3D density at various times following an instantaneous 200 MeV
quadrupole excitation upon the isomeric state. The isolines are separated by 0.05 particles/fm3.
The results quash the naive assumption that the instantaneous quadrupole excitation
will simply move the nucleus by the corresponding energy along the static potential energy
surface (PES). The static PES fission barriers were seen to be  10 MeV (see Fig. 3.6), and
the energy required for BIF is an order of magnitude greater than this. All of the energy
5.1 Instantaneous Velocity Boosts
from the boost is imparted in the form of collective kinetic energy, and in both the static and
dynamic cases, the potential energy is identical at t = 0. Therefore, the instantaneous boost
causes the picture to depart from the static PES at t = 0, as the dynamic state now contains
considerable internal excitation, despite the initial shape being identical.

velocity boost to the isomeric state. In both cases, the initial boost energy is imparted to
the system as collective kinetic energy at t = 0. Figure 5.4 shows the resulting evolution of
the energy functional for a 150 MeV instantaneous excitation (red lines) compared to a 200
MeV excitation (green lines), which demonstrates BIF. For both cases presented, other than
the collective and total energy, all of the contributions to the energy functional are initially
identical.
Looking at the evolution of the collective kinetic energy (second panel from the bottom,
right column) in Fig. 5.4, the collective kinetic energy provided by the excitation field is
rapidly absorbed into the nuclear terms of the energy functional. The bulk of the excitation
energy is absorbed within the first 50-100 fm/c, and by 200-250 fm/c a roughly constant
collective energy ( 5 MeV) remains for the fissioning case up to the point of scission (see inset
panel). This  5 MeV corresponds to internal currents induced by the boost as translational
motion does not set in until after scission occurs. As it will be seen, this significant internal
collective excitation energy corresponds to a dramatic behaviour as the densities rearrange
into a fissioned configuration. For the DIF case (Fig. 4.19), the collective energy was orders
of magnitude smaller up until around the point of scission, which emphasises that the process
5.1 Instantaneous Velocity Boosts
for instantaneous BIF is physically different to that of DIF.
Figure 5.5 displays 1D slices of the particle density along the principal axis of the nucleus
for different times following the application of the 200 MeV instantaneous excitation, which is
instructive when examined in conjunction with the 2D density slices presented in Fig. 5.3. It
can be seen in Fig. 5.5 that the particle density follows an initial rapid elongation (comparing
the density at 0 fm/c to 50 fm/c). This corresponds to the initial drop in absolute magnitude
of the terms in the EDF (Fig. 5.4). This is as the particle density is rapidly stretched and
spread out over a larger volume. By considering the definitions of the terms in the energy
functional (see Sec. 2.3.2), a stretched shape with a sparse local particle density will cause
a decrease in magnitude in all the terms in the energy functional where the particle density
contributes significantly.
Following the initial stretching of the nucleus between 0-50 fm/c, Fig. 5.5 displays the 1D
density slice being drawn back sharply (t=100 fm/c in Fig. 5.5 ). The 1D slice of the particle
density at this time displays a prominent dip around z = 0. The particle density is now
spatially localised at the two ends of the nucleus, causing the terms in the energy functional
to rapidly increase in magnitude (Fig. 5.4). It is following this drawing back that necking
begins to develop, which can be seen when examining the particle density at t = 100 fm/c
in Fig. 5.5. The current vectors corresponding to Fig. 5.5 are displayed in Fig. 5.6, and they
provide a useful visual aid when examined in conjunction with the particle density slices. The
current vectors at t = 100 fm/c demonstrate necking occurring as the particle flow draws in
at the neck region. This coincides with the time at which the characteristic behaviour of the
hexadecupole deformation parameter corresponding to necking occurs, as seen in the bottom
left panel of Fig. 5.2.
By 250 fm/c, the density is seen to be more evenly distributed over the slice along the z
axis (Fig. 5.5), causing the amplitude of the oscillating terms in the energy functional (Fig.
5.4) to reduce somewhat in comparison to the behaviour at earlier times. The energy from
the boost has been mostly absorbed into the nuclear potential part of the energy functional,
and  5 MeV of collective energy remains, corresponding to the currents which the boost has
induced. The E2 term of the energy functional (left column, second panel from top in Fig.
5.4) for the fissioning case levels off at approximately 375 MeV, in comparison to the non-
fissioning case at 325 MeV. For the fissioning case, the extra energy in this term is due to the

The normalisation factors for the vector arrows from t = 250 to t = 900 are the same (=N),
and for other times the normalisation factor has been rescaled so that the panels are visually
instructive. The normalisation factors are N/10, 3N/10 and 3N/10 for t = 0, t = 50 and t = 100,
respectively, and 4N/10 and 3N/10 for t = 1000 and t = 1100.
nucleus necking as it fissions, which creates a greater surface compared to the non-fissioning
system.
Beyond 250 fm/c, the density gradually transitions into a fissioned configuration (Fig. 5.3).
Oscillations in the deformation can be seen (Fig. 5.2) as the shape evolves, this sloshing is
related to the internal current induced by the boost. They correspond to the oscillations seen
in the evolution of the terms in the energy functional (Fig. 5.4) as the configuration varies.
The current vectors presented in Fig. 5.6 complement the particle density slices presented in
Fig. 5.3 to give further insight of the dynamics of the system. Compared to the sample slices
of the current density presented for the DIF case (Fig. 4.17), the evolution of the current
density is far more dramatic for instantaneous BIF. The vectors show that following the
5.1 Instantaneous Velocity Boosts
initial stretching phase (t = 0 to t = 50 fm/c), as the current vectors reverse direction and
the drawing in phase begins (between t = 50 and t = 250 fm/c), a shockwave-type behaviour
sets in. We define this shockwave-type behaviour to correspond to an area with well-defined
current vectors moving in phase in opposite directions, leaving a static void behind. This
is perhaps most clearly observable in the panel of Fig 5.6 corresponding to t = 600 fm/c.
The oscillatory nature of the deformation parameters (Fig. 5.2) and decomposed terms of the
energy functional (Fig. 5.5) suggest that after the initial shockwave occurs (as the direction
of the currents is reversed between 50 and 100 fm/c), the behaviour continues and another
shockwave occurs when the particle flow hits the central region, and reverses direction once
more. This corresponds to the sloshing effect seen in the evolution of the densities and the
energy functional. This behaviour continues until 800-900 fm/c, where beyond this point the
nucleus has rearranged such that it can evolve into a fissioned configuration.
In the evolution of the E0, E1 and E3 terms for the BIF case (Fig. 5.4, green line), around
the point of scission ( 900-1000 fm/c) there is a small increase in the average value which
the oscillations are based around. By comparing the average of the oscillating values of the
terms before and after fission, the E0 and E3 terms increases by 250-300 MeV, and the E1
term by 15-25 MeV. The oscillatory nature of the evolution of these terms make these values
approximate, but they may be compared to the typical changes in magnitude observed in
the DIF case at the point of scission (Fig. 4.19) of  400 MeV for the E0 and E3 terms, and
 25 MeV for the E1 term. These differences may be attributed to the different final fission
products for the BIF case considered here to the DIF cases considered previously, as it is the
local particle densities within the fragments that will determine the post-scissioned values of
the E0 and E3 terms.
A similar investigation of BIF using instantaneous excitation fields may be considered,
starting from the static state with quadrupole deformation 20 = 0.89. The state lies just
beyond the peak of the second static fission barrier, and was seen in the previous Chapter to
fail to fission within a time evolution of 9000 fm/c (see Fig. 4.8). For this static state, mass
asymmetry is present. Due to this, octupole degree of freedom may be explored. Figure 5.7
shows the evolution of the multipole parameters following quadrupole excitations of various
energies. It can be seen in the top right panel of Fig. 5.7 that for the fissioning case the
octupole deformation parameter increases in magnitude from 30 = 0.3 to 0.7 by the

Figure 5.7: Evolution of multipole moments for the initial state with 20 = 0.89, following an
instantaneous quadrupole excitation. For the fissioning case following a 225 MeV boost, scission

cut off at this point.
point of scission. Figure 5.7 demonstrates that the threshold energy required to induce
fission for this state is in the range 200  Ethresh  225 MeV. Figure 5.8 shows the time
evolution of the particle density following an instantaneous quadrupole excitation delivering
225 MeV of energy. The Figure demonstrates that asymmetric fission fragments are indeed
produced within this BIF process, with scission occurring between 1700-1750 fm/c.
The threshold energy for BIF is greater in this case (225 MeV) compared to the 200 MeV
boost required for the isomeric state (Fig. 5.2). This is a surprising result when considering the
static PES. One may have assumed as the initial configuration is more deformed (20 = 0.89)
compared to the isomer (20 = 0.68), that less energy should be required to induce fission.
However, as previously mentioned, by applying an instantaneous boost the state is removed
from the static configuration and the corresponding PES. At t = 0, despite the particle density
being identical to the static configuration, the boosted state contains a large excitation in
the form of collective kinetic energy. It can be reasonably assumed that this highly excited
state does not correspond to the static counterpart and a violently energetic evolution will
commence. Within the first few hundred fm/c, the bulk of the excitation energy is absorbed
into the nuclear terms of the EDF, and the configurations encountered during this time (see
Figs. 5.3 and 5.8, for example) do not resemble anything encountered on the static PES (Fig.

the threshold instantaneous boosts required to observe BIF for the isomer and the state with
static deformation 20=0.89. Application of the instantaneous excitation field to the state
with initial deformation 20 = 0.89 results in asymmetric fission products. The bulk of the
excitation energy is in both cases absorbed into the nuclear terms of the energy functional
within the first few hundred fm/c (Fig. 5.4 is representative), and the remaining excitation
is on the form of internal collective kinetic energy as a current is induced. Scission does not
occur until well after the boost is applied ( 1000-2000 fm/c, see Figs. 5.3 and 5.8), demon-
strating that it is not the boost itself that directly induces fission, but rather that it provides
the collective energy required for the densities to rearrange into a fissioned configuration. The
final collective kinetic energies of the fissioned systems have been deduced using the interpo-
lation procedure described in Sec. 4.2. As discussed in Sec. 4.3.3, the collective energy may
be assumed to be dominated by the translational kinetic energies of the fragments. The mass
distributions obtained for this state (20 = 0.89) by BIF will be compared to experimental
data and DIF results in Sec. 5.2.5.

So far, only the threshold instantaneous BIF cases have been presented. Use of instan-
taneous quadrupole boosts which impart more energy than the deduced threshold are now
briefly investigated for the configuration with static deformation 20 = 0.89. Table 5.2
presents the fission products following different energy excitations. By interpolating the col-
lective kinetic energy of the systems following the different boosts, the translational kinetic
energy of the system may be deduced by assuming that the collective energy is dominated
by translational kinetic energy. To verify that this assumption still stands, the interpolated
5.1 Instantaneous Velocity Boosts
collective energy for the 225 MeV excitation may be compared to the 400 MeV excitation, as
the final fission fragments are the same. Therefore, due to the Coulomb interaction imparting
the translational kinetic energy, the resulting values should agree within uncertainties if the
contribution from internal collective excitations are small. The resulting interpolated energies
agree within uncertainties, demonstrating that the energy released in BIF is still dominantly
translational kinetic energy, even for boost energies beyond the threshold for fission. It can
also be seen from Table 5.2 that the interpolated collective kinetic energies, which are inter-
preted as the energy release, agree within uncertainties for a charge difference of 1 in the
fission products.
The evolution of the energy functionals for the 225 and 400 MeV excitations applied to
the state with 20 = 0.89 display two different time scales for fission (Fig. 5.9). Scission
occurs within 450 fm/c for the 400 MeV excitation, and takes approximately 1650 fm/c for
the 225 MeV excitation. The point of scission is marked on the panels corresponding to
the kinetic and collective kinetic energies in Fig. 5.9. In both cases presented, the bulk of
the initial excitation energy is absorbed within the first 0-100 fm/c (Fig. 5.9, right column,
second panel from bottom). The period of the oscillations in the other terms of the energy
functional are initially similar for both energy boosts (within the first 0-200 fm/c), although
the amplitude of the oscillations for the 400 MeV case are larger.
To explain the differences in the fission timescales when applying the 225 and 400 MeV
excitations to the state with initial deformation 20 = 0.89, it is helpful to examine 1D slices
of the particle densities for both cases as the system evolves. These are displayed in Figs.
5.10 and 5.11 for the 225 and 400 MeV excitations, respectively. For the 225 MeV excitation,
where a longer fission timescale is observed, the behaviour is similar to that where a 200 MeV
excitation was applied to the isomer (Fig. 5.5). Following the application of the boost, the
nucleus is stretched, and then draws sharply back in within the first 100 fm/c (Fig. 5.10).
By 300 fm/c, virtually all of the excitation energy has been absorbed, and the remaining
collective energy corresponds to the induced current (Fig. 5.9). The density has recovered
in the central region (Fig. 5.10, t = 300), and it is here that the shockwave behaviour sets
in, as seen previously for the isomer (most clearly when analysing the current vectors in Fig.
5.6). During this phase, the densities slosh around as the particle flow travels outwards, then
sharply reverses direction, and continues oscillating in this manner. Beyond 1600 fm/c, the

particles in the neck have mostly transitioned into the two lobes, and the Coulomb repulsion
drives the configuration to scission.
When applying the 400 MeV excitation, a much faster timescale is observed for fission
(Fig. 5.9). Figure 5.11 displays the corresponding 1D density slices as the system evolves,
and as is seen from the evolution of the energy functional (Fig. 5.9), the amplitude of the
oscillations in the decomposed terms for the first 500 fm/c are much larger than the 225 MeV
case. This corresponds to the more significant current induced by the excitation, and it
5.1 Instantaneous Velocity Boosts
can be seen by comparing the collective kinetic energy of the system that  20 MeV of
collective kinetic energy remains (400 MeV boost) in comparison to  10 MeV (225 MeV
boost) following the initial absorption phase (Fig. 5.9, inset panel). This suggests that the
shockwaves in the evolution of the densities are more energetic, which can be verified by
the larger amplitude of the oscillations of the terms in the energy functional within the first
500-750 fm/c (Fig. 5.9). This allows the configuration to rearrange more rapidly. Indeed, the
initial state requires far fewer oscillations of the particle flow moving outwards then inwards
before the nucleus rearranges such that the Coulomb repulsion drives the configuration into
two fragments. Here, scission occurs between 400 and 500 fm/c.

It is interesting to observe the differences in the E0  E3 and spin-orbit terms in Fig.
5.9 once the systems have fissioned. This suggests that the final fragments have different
deformations (that is, the particle density is arranged differently), despite having the same N
and Z. This difference in shape configuration results from the trajectory followed to fission
due to the differences in the energy deposited by the boosts and the currents induced.
Increasing the energy beyond that which was observed to produce the faster fission
timescale has been observed to induce a different fission process entirely, producing ternary

5.2 Time-Dependent External Fields
fission products. An instantaneous excitation providing 800 MeV of collective energy to the
state with initial 20 = 0.89 displays this fission mechanism (Fig. 5.12). An investigation
of this fission mode would require a straightforward modification of Sky3D to incorporate
three-fragment analysis, and may be of interest for future work when comparing the different
types of fission seen for DIF to instantaneous BIF.
5.2 Time-Dependent External Fields
As it has been demonstrated, the threshold excitation to observe BIF with an instantaneous
boost requires an excitation depositing energy of the order of 200 MeV for the cases con-
sidered. As the energy is all deposited at t = 0, the correspondence between the static
configuration and the state which is time-evolved is distorted due to the instantaneous, high-
energy excitation. This leads to a dramatic evolution of the state. Adding energy to the
system gradually may allow the densities time to smoothly evolve into a fissioned configura-
tion, in a manner comparative to DIF. In this Section, the external excitation will be applied
gradually via a time-dependent profile. The isomer and configuration with 20 = 0.89 will be
considered. The spatial form of the excitation will be kept as a quadrupole field, consistent
to that considered in the previous Section (Eq. (5.2)).
The single-particle Hamiltonian hq acting on the proton and neutron states can be modi-
fied to include the time-dependent external field Uext.,q(r, t), which was chosen to be isoscalar,
affecting both the proton and neutron states in an identical manner. The single particle
Hamiltonian is augmented by [57]
hq(t) = hq(t) + Uext.,q(r, t) . (5.3)
Here, the external field Uext.,q(r, t) is given by
Uext.,q(r, t) =  f(t)q(r) . (5.4)
The constant  must be tuned as it scales the amount of energy added to the system, and
q(r) is the spatial profile of the field (chosen to be proportional to the quadrupole field). It
is more difficult to tune  to add the desired energy to the system, due to the non-trivial way
it enters the time evolution compared to the case of the instantaneous boost (Eq. (5.1)). The

temporal profile of the excitation field is characterised by f(t), and in all cases considered it
takes the Gaussian form:

The profile is centred around 0, and has a width  . Values of 0 will be investigated in the
region 150-800 fm/c and  will be taken as approximately 0
5.2.1 Applying Time-Dependent External Fields to the Fission Isomer
Boost-induced fission can be investigated using a time-dependent quadrupole excitation field.
As it was seen before, due to the mass symmetry of the initial state and the choice of
excitation field, no octupole deformation is induced during the time evolution. An initial
choice of 0 = 500 fm/c and t = 150 fm/c was adopted to describe the temporal profile of
the external field. Figure 5.13 displays the evolution of the multipole moments subject to
an external field with different strengths . For the fissioning case, (blue line on Fig. 5.13,
 = 0.0095), the evolution of the multipole moments of the system have been sharply cut
off at the point of scission. In those cases where the nucleus fails to fission, the quadrupole
deformation reverts back to the original value once the external excitation ends (red and
green lines in Fig. 5.13). Oscillations in the quadrupole and hexadecupole degrees of freedom
(left column in Fig. 5.13) are visible beyond this.
Figure 5.14 displays 2D slices of the particle density for the fissioning case ( = 0.0095).
Symmetric fission into two 12047 Ag fragments is observed, identical to the case where the
instantaneous quadrupole excitation field was applied (Fig. 5.3). When applying the time-
dependent excitation field (Fig. 5.14), visible deviations from the initial density are only
visible after 300-400 fm/c, whereas Fig. 5.3 shows a dramatic immediate change in the nuclear
configuration following the instantaneous excitation. The timescale for scission to occur is
comparable the instantaneous BIF case (Fig. 5.3), requiring approximately 1050 fm/c for the
time-dependent field and 950 fm/c for the instantaneous boost.
The current vectors corresponding to the particle density slices presented in Fig. 5.14 are
shown in Fig. 5.15. The observed behaviour may be compared to the DIF example (Fig.
4.17) and the BIF case presented where an instantaneous boost was applied to the static
isomer (Fig. 5.6). For the time-dependent BIF case, Fig. 5.15 shows current vectors where
the flow of particles moves outwards into the two fission fragments, which gradually increase

in magnitude up to 800 fm/c. At this point the external field becomes negligible. Beyond 800
fm/c, a current has been induced, and the nucleus has reconfigured itself so that it evolves to
fission without further influence from the excitation field. It will be shown that the collective
energy corresponding to this current is small compared to the instantaneous BIF case. The
system continues evolving into a two-fragment configuration without the flow of particles
begin drawn back inwards, similarly to the behaviour seen for the DIF case (Fig. 4.17). In
the DIF case, the currents in the two forming fragments point in opposite direction, with
little contribution from the neck region. Here, for the time-dependent BIF case, there are
initially far more particles in the neck (the initial configuration is less deformed), resulting
in a significant particle flow in this region, especially around 600-700 fm/c (Fig. 5.15).
Compared to the instantaneous BIF case (Fig. 5.6), where a shockwave-type behaviour
was seen in the time evolution of the current density, the behaviour observed as the configu-
ration evolves when using a time-dependent external field (temporally extended BIF) is far
less dramatic. Unlike instantaneous BIF, there is no sloshing or oscillations in the density
during the time evolution. This suggests a physically different transition to the fissioned state
is occurring for temporally extended BIF, similar to that seen for DIF.
It is instructive to examine the integrated contributions to the energy functional for all

three cases of the time-dependent excitation field (where one leads to BIF) presented in Fig.
5.13. The decomposed energy functionals are presented in Fig. 5.16. The Figure displays the
temporal profile of the external field as a visual aid in the bottom left panel. The energy
added to the system by the field for the different scaling parameters  can be read off the panel
corresponding to the total energy (bottom right). It is remarkable to observe that fission has
been induced in the case where  = 0.0095 by adding 52 MeV of energy to the system. A
threshold of 41  Ethresh  52 may be deduced. This compares to 175  Ethresh  200 MeV
which was required for the instantaneous quadrupole boost (Fig. 5.2). When applying a time-
dependent excitation field, energy is deposited into the system in a more gradual manner. In
doing so, less excitation energy is needed to bring the system to fission. This suggests that
not only energy deposition, but also the timescale for the energy deposition, matters in terms
of fission dynamics.

Figure 5.15: Current vectors corresponding to the particle density slices preseneted in Fig.
5.14. The external field peaks at 0 = 500 fm/c with width =150 fm/c, so the excitation field
has reduced to a negligible magnitude by t = 800 fm/c. The vectors have been normalised to be
visually instructive. The normalisation factor (N) is the same in each panel, other than t = 1100
fm/c, where it is 3N/5.
The time evolution of the contributions to the energy functional shown in Fig. 5.16 may
be compared to the case of the instantaneous BIF presented in Fig. 5.4. Some parts re-
main similar; for example upon scission the Coulomb and collective kinetic energies display
behaviour characteristic of two repulsively charged fragments accelerating away from one
another (second and third panels from the bottom on the right of Figs. 5.16 and 5.4).
The evolution of the E0, E1, E2 and E3 terms are drastically different when comparing
the cases of instantaneous and time-dependent BIF (top two rows in Figs. 5.4 and 5.16).
For the case presented of instantaneous BIF applied to the isomer (Fig. 5.4), all four of these
terms were seen to display a prompt reduction in magnitude during the first 50-100 fm/c as
the configuration underwent rapid, dramatic elongation. Following this, the magnitude of the

Figure 5.16: Time evolution of the integrated contributions to the energy functional when
applying a time-dependent external field to the isomeric state. The time profile of the external
field is displayed in the bottom left panel. The case with scaling constant  = 0.0095 is seen to

terms recovered as the particle density evened out, and oscillated violently as shockwaves
in the evolution of the densities set in.
For the time-dependent BIF case (blue line on Fig. 5.16), the evolution of the energy
functional displays behaviour which is more qualitatively similar to the DIF cases (Fig. 4.19).
The E0, E1 and E3 terms for the time-dependent BIF case in Fig. 5.16 display a gradual
decrease in magnitude, which upon scission recovers (at 900-1100 fm/c), and then undergoes
5.2 Time-Dependent External Fields
small oscillations about an approximately constant value. These small oscillations in the
post-fissioned system correspond to the collective excitations of the fission fragments. For
the case of the instantaneous boost (Fig. 5.4), the E2 term shows an initial reduction in
magnitude of approximately 100 MeV. In contrast to this, for the time-dependent excitation
(Fig. 5.16), the evolution of the E2 term shows only a dip of  5 MeV in magnitude at
around 500 fm/c as the shape configuration starts changing, before rapidly increasing by
approximately 50 MeV as the surface of the nucleus increases.
The absolute variation in the magnitude of the terms in the energy functional for the time-
dependent BIF case, compared to the instantaneous boost cases, are small. For example, the
E0 term in Fig. 5.16 for the fissioning case varies from the original value by less than 1500
MeV. For the instantaneous BIF case presented in Fig. 5.4, the E0 term displays a maximum
fluctuation of  5000 MeV from the initial value during time evolution. The fluctuation for
the time-dependent BIF case is closer to that observed for DIF, where the maximum variation
of the E0 term during time evolution is in the region of 400 MeV (Fig. 4.19).
The collective kinetic energy displayed in Fig. 5.16 is negligible up to  300 fm/c, and
displays an initial peak just beyond the maximum of the external field time profile (inset in
second panel from the bottom, right column). It is interesting to observe that the collective
kinetic energy reduces after the external field peaks (before scission occurs). At approximately
1000 fm/c for the fissioning case it rapidly increases once more as the system transitions into a
fissioned configuration. This behaviour is similar to that seen for the DIF cases examined (Fig.
4.19). This suggests that the time-dependent external field has induced internal currents and
gradually transitioned the nucleus into a configuration where fission becomes energetically
favourable, but it is not the external field itself which forces the system to fission. In both BIF
cases, where either an instantaneous or time-dependent excitation was applied, the excitation
energy from the boost is dissipated mainly into the nuclear terms in the functional. The
induced current, corresponding to the collective energy up until around the point of scission,
is small in comparison to the total excitation energy added to the system. However, this
current is much larger for instantaneous BIF: no shockwave-type behaviour is observed in
the time-dependent BIF case as the energy is slowly released into the nucleus and a gradual
evolution of the densities occurs.
The collective kinetic energy of the system shown in Fig. 5.16 may be interpolated to
5. BOOST-INDUCED FISSION USING TIME-DEPENDENT
HARTREE-FOCK
a large time, and a value of 221(1) MeV is obtained to correspond to the energy released
in the fission process (dominantly as translational kinetic energy of symmetric 12047 Ag fission
fragments). This is in good agreement to the value obtained for the case of the instantaneous
quadrupole boost (218(8) MeV, Table 5.1). This agreement is unsurprising considering the
fission products are identical, and it is the Coulomb interaction which imparts most of the
final collective energy to the system in the form of translational kinetic energy.
5.2.2 Fragment Excitation Modes Following Boost-Induced Fission
The excitation modes of the fission fragments following the time-dependent excitation ap-
plied to the isomer may be compared to those obtained with the 200 MeV instantaneous
quadrupole excitation. Unlike those power spectra presented in Sec. 4.3.4, the measurements
of the deformation parameters of the fragments have not been extended by applying Galilean
transformations to remove translational motion. In future work, they would certainly benefit
from this technique as it would allow for extended measurements.

in Fig. 5.18 displays a much broader peak for the 200 MeV instantaneous boost compared
to the time-dependent field, although both are centred around 4 MeV. The time-dependent
field also displays a noticeable secondary peak at 8 MeV. Insufficient signal was collected to
obtain the power spectrum for the octupole deformation for the time-dependent excitation
field. Referring to Fig. 5.17, a low frequency and large amplitude power spectrum would be
expected in comparison to the octupole spectrum for the 200 MeV instantaneous boost. This
is deduced by the signal oscillating far more slowly for the case of the time-dependent field
(top right panel of Figure 5.17). Both cases display a fragmentation in the hexadecupole
power spectra (bottom left panel of Fig. 5.18), and the time-dependent BIF case peaks at
slightly higher excitation energies.
Ideally, with more signal, the power spectra would be presented with a greater resolution,
and a higher quality comparison could be made. Even with the limited resolution available,
despite the fission fragments being identical, it seems that their excitation modes differ de-
pending on the method used to induce the fission process. The differences may relate to the
fission induced by the instantaneous boost, which imparted a violent internal excitation as
the nucleus evolved, compared to the fission process induced by the gradual excitation.

Figure 5.19: BIF using excitations with three different time profiles. The narrowest (green)
has 0 = 150 fm/c with width t = 50 fm/c (case A), the case in red has 0 = 500 fm/c with

fm/c. The widest case, C, (blue line) has 0 = 800 fm/c and width  = 250 fm/c. Upon
the limit   0, instantaneous boosts are recovered. It may be seen that the energy
functional (Fig. 5.19) for case A behaves more similarly to the instantaneous boosts used
in the previous Section (see, for example, Fig. 5.4 and 5.9). The evolution of the energy
functional for case A (Fig. 5.19) displays an initial sharp reduction in magnitude of the terms
in the functional (other than the collective kinetic energy) at 150 fm/c, corresponding to
the centroid of f(t). Beyond this point, oscillations kick in, and the nucleus transitions to
a fissioned configuration within 500 fm/c. The large oscillations in the terms of the energy
functional suggests a shockwave-type behaviour, as seen for the cases of instantaneous BIF
(Figs. 5.4 and 5.9), is occurring as the densities evolve. The initial fluctuation in the energy
terms upon application of the external field A is of a much smaller magnitude than the case
of the instantaneous boost, however. Taking the E0 term for example, the initial spike shows
a peak dropping in magnitude by  3000 MeV from the starting point (Fig. 5.19), which
compares to the  5000 MeV seen for the instantaneous boost applied to the isomeric state
(Fig. 5.4).
It is interesting to observe that the final values of the E0, E1 and E3 terms are approxi-
mately equal for the two more gradual profiles (cases B and C). The case with the shortest
temporal profile (A) plateaus with a magnitude approximately 1000 MeV less both for the
E0 and E3 terms, and 15-20 MeV less for the E1 term. The differences in the E0 and E3
terms when comparing case A to cases B and C suggests that the final fragments are less
deformed, and the density is more compact, for the cases B and C.
For case A, a sharp drop in the magnitude of the E2 case occurs initially, as was seen when
applying instantaneous boosts (Fig. 5.4). Here, the drop in magnitude is approximately 30
MeV, which is much smaller than the drop of approximately 100 MeV seen for the application
of the instantaneous boost to the isomer (Fig. 5.4). This suggests that with the short time
profile a less extreme, but none the less similar, behaviour compared to the application of an
instantaneous boost is occurring. This sharp drop in the E2 term is not seen for the cases
B and C, which suggests the process is much more similar to the gradual evolution seen for
DIF (no drop in the E2 term was seen in the time evolution for DIF, see Fig. 4.19).
The wider temporal profiles of cases B and C show a much more gradual transition in the
energy functional as the system is evolved to fission. No large amplitude, rapid oscillations
5. BOOST-INDUCED FISSION USING TIME-DEPENDENT
HARTREE-FOCK
are seen in the evolution of the terms of the energy functional (Fig. 5.19), and the behaviour
during the transition to fission is more reminiscent to that seen for the DIF cases before (Fig
4.19). This suggests that the shockwave-type behaviour in the evolution of the densities,
which was seen for excitations delivered in a shorter or instantaneous time profile, is not
occurring as the system smoothly evolves to fission. This observation points to a physically
different process occurring. The temporally extended BIF for cases B and C has similar
properties to DIF. In contrast, instantaneous BIF displays a violent oscillatory evolution of
the densities as the system fissions. This once more demonstrates that the timescale of the
energy deposition matters in terms of the resulting fission dynamics.
The initial drop in magnitude in the values of the E0, E1 and E3 terms for case C are
similar to that of the case B (Fig. 5.19). Comparing the initial drop in magnitude of the E0
term, a drop of approximately 1000 MeV is seen for both cases B and C, compared to the
drop of  3000 MeV for case A. In fact, the main difference observed between cases B and
C is that the evolution of the E0, E1 and E3 terms show a recovery in absolute magnitude
corresponding to scission, at a later time of  1250 fm/c for case C, compared to around 950
fm/c for case B.

meric state when applying time-dependent external fields with different temporal profiles. The
final collective kinetic energy, corresponding to (mainly) translational kinetic energy has been

Table 5.3 demonstrates the effect of varying the time-dependent profile f(t) upon the
threshold energy required to induce fission, this can also be seen in the bottom right panel
of Fig. 5.19. In all cases, the final interpolated kinetic energies, corresponding to the energy
release, displayed in Table 5.3 agree within uncertainties. As all three cases produce identical
fission fragments, this demonstrates once more that the energy release is dominated by the
translational kinetic energy due to the Coulomb interaction between the fission products.
The application of a time-dependent excitation ensures that the static and dynamic states
5.2 Time-Dependent External Fields
at t = 0 are the same (unlike the application of an instantaneous boost, where a large
excitation is deposited at t = 0). It can be seen that the shortest time profile (case A, green
line in Fig. 5.19) requires significantly more energy to induce fission than the more gradual
fields (cases B and C). The lowest energy observed to induce fission for case A was 110 MeV,
which is approximately half of that which was required for the instantaneous boost (see Fig.
5.2). The wider fields (cases B and C) demonstrate a significant reduction in the required
excitation energy compared to case A, with the lowest energies required found to be 52 and 45
MeV for cases B and C, respectively. As the temporal profile of the external field is widened,
the energy required to induce fission is reduced. The comparative threshold energies for cases
B and C suggest that an adiabatic limit may be approached when using an even more gradual
temporal profile for the external field (up until the point of scission).
5.2.4 Applying Time-Dependent External Fields to the State with Initial
Deformation 20 = 0.89
A time-dependent external quadrupole field may be applied to the state with initial defor-
mation 20 = 0.89 to investigate the BIF process. Using the temporal profile described by
Eq. (5.5), the parameters 0 = 500 fm/c and t = 150 fm/c were used to specify the peak
and width of the profile. Figure 5.20 displays the evolution of the multipole moments using
various scaling parameters, . For  = 0.007 the system is observed to fission, which is
demonstrated by the rapid increase of elongation in the quadruple deformation following the
application of the field, shown on the top left panel of Fig. 5.20. The octupole degree of
freedom is also explored due to the initial mass asymmetry of the static configurations (top
right panel of Fig. 5.20), and for the fissioning case increases in magnitude from 30 = 0.3
to the region of 0.5 at the point of scission.
The evolution of the particle density up to the point of scission is displayed in Fig.
5.21. The final fission products are asymmetric. Upon scission, the products are: A1, Z1 =
145.05(5), 56.32(5) and A2, Z2 = 95.02(5), 37.69(5). To the nearest integer particle number,
this gives 14556 Ba and
35Sr. The mass distributions of this BIF process will be compared to
DIF, as well as experimental results, in Section 5.2.5.
Figure 5.21 displays no visible changes in the particle density slices until 300-400 fm/c,
unlike the case where an instantaneous boost was applied (Fig. 5.8). The evolution of the
particle density to fission is seen to take longer for this excitation (2050 fm/c) than the

application of the threshold 225 MeV instantaneous boost to the same state, which took
approximately 1700 fm/c (Fig. 5.8). The influence of the external field is negligible by 800
fm/c, and beyond this the neck region smoothly rearranges into the two fission fragments.
Referring to Fig. 5.22, which displays the decomposed integrated energy functional for the
system, the threshold energy required to induce BIF using the specified time-dependent
excitation field is 32  Ethresh  40 MeV. This energy compares to the 225 MeV required
for the minimum energy case of instantaneous BIF for this state (Fig. 5.7). Once again it
demonstrates that when applying a gradual evolution, a significantly lower threshold energy
is required to induce fission, compared to the application of an instantaneous high-energy
boost.
The evolution of the E0, E1 and E3 terms of the energy functional for the fissioning case
(blue line in Fig. 5.22) display that the nucleus moves to an elongated configuration in the
first 500 fm/c (displayed by the drop in magnitude). During the time between 500 and
2000 fm/c, slight fluctuations are observed in the terms as the configuration rearranges due
to the current induced by the excitation. The fluctuations are small; for example the E0 term
varies by less than 250 MeV whilst in this elongated configuration. Around 2000 fm/c, at
the point of scission, the characteristic increase in magnitude of the E0, E1 and E3 terms are

increase beyond an initial peak at 800 fm/c, increasing by approximately 20 MeV between
t = 800 and t = 2000 fm/c as the two-fragment configuration gradually forms.
As with the other cases where a time-dependent external field has been considered (Fig.
5.19), the collective kinetic energy in Fig. 5.22 shows an initial peak near the centroid of the
temporal profile of the field, which then reduces as the excitation field ends (inset in collective
kinetic energy panel of Fig. 5.22). The collective kinetic energy for the fissioning case remains
constant at around 1 MeV once the external field ends, which corresponds the current induced
by the field. This collective energy is significantly less than that seen for instantaneous BIF
for the 225 MeV boost (see Fig. 5.9) and is more comparable to that seen for DIF before
scission (see Fig. 4.19). Beyond 2000 fm/c, a rapid increase in collective kinetic energy is

seen around point of scission as translational motion sets in (Fig. 5.22).
As the system took longer to fission than the other BIF cases, the calculation was ter-
minated at 3000 fm/c, where by this point the fragment separation was only 75 fm. By
interpolating the collective kinetic energy from the points where the fragment separation was
40 fm and 50 fm, the average value obtained to correspond to translational energy at large
times is 207(9) MeV. This value is reasonable when compared to experimental data, falling
within the distribution of kinetic energies obtained from thermal neutron-induced fission
5.2 Time-Dependent External Fields
displayed in Fig. 4.26.
Once again, it has been demonstrated that with the use of an external field with a gradual
time-dependence, fission may be induced requiring energy an order of magnitude lower than
an instantaneous boost. The evolution of the energy functional (Fig. 5.22) when applying
the time-dependent excitation field shows a smoother, less dramatic transition as the one-
fragment system evolves into a two-fragment system, compared to the application of an
instantaneous or short excitation field (Figs 5.9 and 5.19).
5.2.5 Comparing the Masses Obtained using BIF to DIF
The mass distributions obtained from the DIF processes examined in the previous Chapter
(Table 4.3) may be compared to those obtained from the BIF processes investigated. For
BIF, only those cases where the static configuration had mass asymmetry will be considered.
Due to the symmetric nature of the excitation fields applied, an initial configuration with no
octupole deformation will be unable to explore this degree of freedom, therefore symmetric
fission fragments will always be obtained.
Figure 5.23 displays a comparison between the masses obtained from the DIF cases pre-
sented in the previous Chapter (red bars in Figure), and the BIF cases examined in this
Chapter. For the BIF cases, the asymmetric fission products obtained from the initial state
with 20 = 0.89 have been included. The blue bars correspond to the masses obtained using
instantaneous excitations (Table 5.2), and the green bar to the sample temporally extended
time-dependent excitation field (Sec. 5.2.4).
As was presented in the previous Chapter, the DIF fission products fall well within the
experimentally obtained mass distributions. This suggests that investigating DIF within
TDHF corresponds to a process which is similar to the typical experimental methods used to
induce fission (see, e.g. Ref. [115]). The instantaneous BIF cases investigated have displayed
a different process. When applying instantaneous boosts to the static state with deformation
20 = 0.89, the resulting masses fall on the edge of the experimentally obtained results, dis-
playing a mass distribution which is more asymmetric (blue bars in Fig. 5.23). This suggests,
that although fission may be induced with such a technique, that the mechanism does not
correspond to typical experimentally observed fission processes. It also bears mentioning that
the threshold energy of 225 MeV required for BIF starting from the state with 20 = 0.89

is at least an order of magnitude larger than that required to induce fission in experimental
studies. For example, photo-fission may be induced in 240Pu using a 12 MeV endpoint en-
ergy bremsstrahlung source [115] (although such a process corresponds to a dipole excitation,
rather than the quadrupole excitation examined).
When performing BIF and applying the excitation field with a temporally extended time-
dependent profile, the energy required to induce fission is significantly reduced. For the
application of a field with a temporal profile characterised by a Guassian peaking at 0 =
500 fm/c with width  = 150 fm/c, the minimum energy found to induce fission was 40
MeV. The sample mass distribution (green bar in Figure 5.23) lies closer to the peak of the
experimental distribution than the other BIF examples. This suggests that the process is more
closely linked to the dynamic evolution observed for DIF. This assumption is strengthened by
comparing the behaviours during time evolution; the time-dependent BIF case (Sec. 5.2.4)
5.2 Time-Dependent External Fields
displayed a small collective energy up until the point of scission and no shockwave-type
behaviour as the densities evolved, which is in line to what is observed for the DIF processes
(see Sec. 4.2). Comparing the results of DIF to instantaneous and temporally extended BIF,
it could be concluded that the experimentally observed fission fragments are formed during
this smooth, gradual evolution to fission, rather than in the violent, dramatic process seen to
occur for instantaneous BIF. The comparison of instantaneous BIF to temporally extended
BIF demonstrates that the timescale for the energy deposition has important consequences
regarding the fission dynamics.
Overall, different approaches for inducing fission processes within TDHF have been pre-
sented and compared. It would be of interest to further investigate the connection between
DIF and temporally extended BIF, as this smooth, gradual evolution to scission appears to
have important consequences regarding the formation of the fission products.
5. BOOST-INDUCED FISSION USING TIME-DEPENDENT
HARTREE-FOCK
Conclusions and Outlooks
In this thesis, the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method has been applied to inves-
tigate the dynamics of nuclear fission in 240Pu. The 3D Skyrme-Hartree-Fock code Sky3D
was modified to include a constraint on the quadrupole deformation using the Augmented
Lagrangian Method. The static potential energy surface (PES) was calculated with respect
to this constraint. As well as the one-fragment static fission pathway, a competing pathway
of two-fragment configurations was explored. The point at which these pathways met was
interpreted to have significance in the dynamics upon the time evolution of the static states.
Starting from the calculated one-fragment PES, the dynamics of fission were investigated.
Deformation-induced fission (DIF) was explored first, by releasing the quadrupole constraint
and time-evolving a selection of states situated around and beyond the second static fission
barrier. Three behaviours were observed. For those states with a quadrupole deformation
below the peak of the fission barrier, vibrations corresponding to a collective giant resonance
mode were seen. For these states, DIF is forbidden in TDHF, as a collective tunnelling
through the barrier must occur to reach a fissioned configuration.
A different behaviour was observed for the evolution of states which were situated beyond
the peak of the second static fission barrier, but before the critical point where the static one
and two-fragment pathways intercepted. Upon time evolution up to 9000 fm/c, these states
also failed to fission, but the dynamics were not typical of collective giant resonant modes.
The repulsive Coulomb force attempted to drive the configuration towards fission, but due to
competition with the attractive terms in the energy functional, scission did not occur. DIF is
inhibited for these initial configurations, and it can only be speculated if these states would
eventually fission with a longer time evolution.
6. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOKS
For states with a static deformation exceeding the intersection of the one and two-fragment
fission pathways, DIF was observed upon time evolution. It was interpreted that for these
states, as a static two-fragment configuration exists with greater binding energy than the one-
fragment configuration, that it was energetically possible for the one-fragment configurations
to evolve to fission with only a modest rearrangement of the densities. The evolution from the
static states to a fissioned configuration displayed a gradual rearrangement of the densities up
until around the point of scission. At this point, the Coulomb repulsion between the fragments
overpowered the nuclear potential, and translational motion set in as the fission products
rapidly accelerated away from one another. The timescale for DIF varied depending upon
the deformation of the initial state. The least deformed configuration demonstrated a phase
where the densities rearranged lasting approximately 1500 fm/c before scission occurred,
whereas the most deformed configuration was initially close to the point of scission and the
neck ruptured within 100-200 fm/c.
A selection of fission products was observed for the various initial configurations consid-
ered. When compared to experimental measurements of neutron-induced fission processes,
the agreement of the calculated fragment masses demonstrated promising results. The energy
released was shown to be dominantly translational kinetic energy, and agreement between
theory and experiment was found to be reasonable when comparing the calculated and mea-
sured kinetic energies of the post-fissioned systems.
For those states where DIF failed, boost-induced fission (BIF) was investigated. For this
process, a quadrupole excitation field was applied either instantaneously, or gradually with
a Gaussian time profile. Two states were investigated: the fission isomer (20 = 0.68) and a
state just beyond the peak of the second barrier, with static deformation 20 = 0.89.
Minimum excitation energies of the order of 200 MeV were required when applying in-
stantaneous boosts to the considered states to induced fission, which is an energy significantly
greater than the calculated static fission barrier heights ( 8 MeV). In these processes the
excitation energy, which was deposited as collective energy at t = 0, was absorbed within
the first 100-200 fm/c into the nuclear potential terms of the energy density functional. A
significant current was also induced, and a violent evolution of the state ensued, which was
in contrast to the gradual rearrangement of the densities observed for DIF.
The fission products obtained when applying various instantaneous boosts to induce fis-
sion in the state with 20 = 0.89 fell on the edges of the considered experimental mass
distributions, showing tendency to be more asymmetric. These results suggest that the
instantaneous BIF process does not compare physically to the process of neutron-induced fis-
sion. The pre-scission states demonstrated rearrangements of both energy and density which
was far more extreme than the DIF process. Different timescales for fission were observed
when various energy instantaneous boosts were applied, ranging from hundreds to thousands
of fm/c. Observation of ternary fission products using instantaneous excitations far beyond
the minimum threshold to induce fission may warrant further investigation to examine the
dynamics of these instantaneous BIF processes within TDHF.
When applying a quadrupole excitation field with a Gaussian time profile, the energy
required to induce fission was found to reduce significantly. For example, when exciting the
fission isomer, the minimum energy required to observe BIF with an instantaneous excitation
was 200 MeV, in comparison to 45 MeV with an temporally extended excitation field centred
around 800 fm/c with width 250 fm/c. Similarities in the evolution between temporally ex-
tended BIF and DIF were apparent, displaying a smooth, gradual evolution of the densities
up to around the point of scission. When evolving the state using temporally extended BIF,
the timescale for scission was approximately 2000 fm/c, during which the rearrangement of
the energies and densities were far less extreme compared to the instantaneous BIF pro-
cesses investigated. This timescale compares to the DIF case with the least deformed initial
configuration.
In both types of BIF process (instantaneous and temporally extended), the evolution is
such that the nucleus absorbs all the energy of the boost and rearranges substantially before
fission. During this rearrangement process, currents build up and the nucleus splits into
fragments. The length of this rearrangement phase is more or less independent of the type of
boost, which suggests the density rearrangement is a robust mechanism for fission that does
not carry memory of the initial excitation process.
For the state with 20 = 0.89, when applying a time-dependent external field centred
around 500 fm/c with a width of 150 fm/c, BIF was observed requiring an excitation energy
in the region of 40 MeV (compared to 225 MeV for the instantaneous excitation applied to
the same state). The resulting fission products agreed better with the experimental results
6. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOKS
for neutron-induced fission. This improved agreement of the mass distributions between ex-
periment and theory for non-violent fission processes (DIF and temporally extended BIF)
suggests that the fragment formation is mostly determined an evolution of this type. Investi-
gations of BIF could be extended to examine widening the time profile of the excitation even
further, as the comparison between instantaneous BIF and temporally extended BIF demon-
strated that the timescale for the energy deposition has important consequences regarding
the fission dynamics.
In conclusion, with the advances of computational power and the development of 3D
symmetry-unrestricted codes, time-dependent Hartree Fock presents itself as a promising tool
for describing nuclear fission processes. In particular, the DIF and temporally extended BIF
processes investigated agreed well with the experimental results of neutron-induced fission.
TDHF allows the flexibility to apply external excitation fields with different spatial and
temporal profiles, so that different types fission processes may be examined. The results
presented in this thesis serve to justify future investigation of fission phenomenon using the
time-dependent Hartree-Fock method.
Future work could investigate the inclusion of a number of effects. It would be of interest
to determine whether time-dependent pairing would have any significant impact upon the
results observed in this thesis. Such an extension to Sky3D is a feasible modification to
bring its abilities in line with other modern studies using TDHF [104, 106, 107, 109]. The
inclusion of a three-body analysis within Sky3D would be essential to further investigate the
BIF process which was seen to lead to ternary fission fragments. Additionally, increasing
the number of constraints when calculating static states [47] would allow a wider selection of
initial configurations to investigate the dynamics of fission. Alternatively, existing Hartree-
Fock solvers which are capable of enforcing multiple shape constraints could be modified to
produce static configurations which may be time-evolved using Sky3D.
From another perspective, rather than collecting a larger sample of results using the
techniques investigated in this thesis, the distribution of fission products could be computed
explicitly using different methods. It would be of interest to project the resulting fission
products onto a good particle number [131]. Further, a fluctuation of the particle number
could be deduced by applying the Balian-Vnroni variational principle [101, 144, 145, 146].
This would allow an enhanced mass distribution probability to be deduced, even with a
limited number of TDHF fission events.

Gauge Transformation of the Skyrme
Energy Density Functional
A.1 Gauge Transformation properties of Local Densities
An instantaneous kinetic energy boost can be applied to the single particle wave functions
by applying the gauge transformation [143],
i(r) = e
i(r) (r) , (A.1)
where (r) is an arbitrary spatial profile. The Skyrme energy density functional must be
gauge invariant (which implies that it is also invariant under Galilean transformations). To
prove this, one must consider the effect the gauge transformation has upon the local densities
which define the energy density functional of the system.
A.1.1 Particle Density
The (non-local) density matrix is defined in the Hartree-Fock picture:
(r, r) =
(r
)(r) . (A.2)
Taking the limit r  r gives:
(r) =
|(r)|2 . (A.3)
The boosted particle density following the gauge transformation may be defined by:
(r, r) = ei((r)(r
(r
)(r)
= ei((r)(r
)) (r, r) . (A.4)
A. GAUGE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SKYRME ENERGY
DENSITY FUNCTIONAL
Taking the limit r  r gives:
(r) = (r) . (A.5)
This demonstrates that the particle density is invariant under gauge transformations. Due to
this, all terms in the energy density functional (Eq. (2.24)) that are solely dependent upon
(r) (the E0, E2, E3 and ECoul terms) are invariant under gauge transformations.
A.1.2 Spin Density
The spatial components  = x, y, z of the spin density S are defined by:
S(r, r
,,
(r
) 
, (r) , (A.6)
where , are the components of the Pauli spin operator. At r
  r, one finds:
S(r, r) =
,,
(r) 
, (r) . (A.7)
The boosted spin density may be written:
S(r, r
,,
ei(r
) (r) 
, e
i(r) (r)
= ei((r)(r
)) S(r, r
) . (A.8)
The limit therefore yields
S(r) = S(r) . (A.9)
This demonstrates the spin density is invariant under the gauge transformation ei(r).
A.1.3 Current Density
The components of the current density j are defined by:
j(r, r
) = 
( )(r, r
( )
)(r)
(r
)(r)
)(r) . (A.10)
At the limit r  r
j(r) = 
(r)(r)
(r)(r) . (A.11)
A.1 Gauge Transformation properties of Local Densities
The boosted current density is defined as:
j(r, r
) = 
( ) e
i((r)(r)) (r, r)
(r)
ei((r)(r
)) (r
)(r)
+ ei((r)(r
)) (r
(r)
(r
ei((r)(r
)) (r
)(r)
 ei((r)(r
(r) . (A.12)
Taking the limit r  r gives:
j(r) = 
(r)
|(r)|2 + (r)
(r)
(r)
(r)
(r)
|(r)|2 
(r)
(r)
(r)
(r)
= j(r) +(r)(r) . (A.13)
Consequently, the current density transforms under a gauge transformation as j(r) 
j(r) +(r)(r). The additional term is proportional to the gradient of the gauge angle.
A.1.4 Kinetic Density
The kinetic density  is defined by:
(r, r) =   (r, r)
(r
)  (r) . (A.14)
At the limit r  r:
(r) =
(r)  (r) . (A.15)

The current j(r) is zero for a static state, so the kinetic density transforms under a gauge
transformation as (r) (r) + |(r)|2(r). The additional term, as seen for the current
density, is proportional to the gradient of the gauge angle.

A.1 Gauge Transformation properties of Local Densities
The tensor spin-current density transforms under a gauge transformation as J(r) J(r)+
S(r)(r). The additional term, once again, is proportional to the gradient of the gauge
angle.
A.1.6 Spin-Orbit Density
The Cartesian components of the spin-orbit density J(r) are defined from the tensor spin-
current density as,
J(r) =
J(r) , (A.22)
where  is the Levi-Civita symbol, and , ,  tun over x, y, z. The spin-orbit density may
be written explicitly as
J(r) =
Jyz  JzyJzx  Jxz
Jxy  Jyx
 . (A.23)
The boosted spin-orbit density is defined analogously to the tensor spin-current density:
J(r) =
J(r) + S(r)(r)
, (A.24)
or explicitly as
J(r) =
Jyz(r) + Sz(r)y(r)
Jzy(r) + Sy(r)z(r)
Jzx(r) + Sx(r)z(r)
Jxz(r) + Sz(r)x(r)
Jxy(r) + Sy(r)x(r)
Jyx(r) + Sx(r)y(r)
 , (A.25)
Or alternatively, in the more convenient form of
J(r) = J(r) S(r)(r) . (A.26)
The spin-orbit density transforms under a gauge transformation as J(r)  J(r)  S(r) 
(r). For all the densities which are not invariant under the gauge transformation, the
extra term is always proportional to the gradient of the gauge angle (r). It will be shown
shortly that due to the combinations of densities that appear by construction in the Skyrme
energy density functional, the energy density functional as a whole is invariant under a
gauge transformation. As a consequence of gauge invariance, the functional is also Galilean
invariant.
A. GAUGE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SKYRME ENERGY
DENSITY FUNCTIONAL
A.2 Gauge Invariance of the Skyrme Energy Density Func-
tional
The E0, E2 and E3 terms of the Skyrme energy density functional only depend explicitly on
the local particle density (see Sec. 2.3.2). As this density, (r), has been shown to be gauge
invariant, the three terms in the energy density functional are also invariant. The remaining
terms are the E1 term and Els terms, and it will be shown in the following that they are
invariant under gauge transformations of the local densities.
A.2.1 E1 Term
The E1 term contains the combination of densities E1
E1 = (r)(r) j(r)2 . (A.27)
By replacing the densities by their gauge transformed versions, the gauge transformed density
combination becomes
E1 =
(r) + |(r)|2(r) + 2(r)  j(r)
j(r) +(r)(r)
. (A.28)
Expanding this expression gives
E1 = |(r)|2(r)2 + (r)(r) + 2(r)(r)  j(r)
 |(r)|2(r)2  j(r)2  2(r)(r)  j(r)
= E1 , (A.29)
and hence the E1 term is gauge invariant.
A.2.2 Els Term
The remaining term in the Skyrme EDF is the spin orbit term Els, which contains the
combinations of densities Els:
Els = (r)  J(r) + S(r) 
 j(r)
. (A.30)
Appendix A of Ref. [76] demonstrates that this term may be rewritten:
Els = (r)  J(r) + j(r) 
 S(r)
. (A.31)
A.3 Energy Added by Instantaneous Boosts
By replacing the densities by their gauge transformed versions, the combination of densi-
Els = (r) 
J(r)
S(r)(r)
j(r) + (r)(r)
 S(r)
(A.32)
is obtained. The expression may be expanded and written in the form
Els = (r)  J(r) + j(r) 
 S(r)
+ (r)(r) 
 S(r)
 (r) 
S(r)(r)
. (A.33)
Making use of the identity
  (AB) = B  (A)A  (B) , (A.34)
the transformed density combination may be written
Els = (r)  J(r) + j(r) 
 S(r)
+ (r)(r) 
 S(r)
+ (r)S(r)  ((r)
 (r)(r) 
 S(r)
= Els , (A.35)
making use of the relation
(r) = 0 . (A.36)
This shows the combination of densities in the Els term is gauge invariant, and therefore it
has been demonstrated the entire Skyrme energy density function is also invariant.
This is an important result when considering a dynamic system adopting the Skyrme en-
ergy density functional. First and foremost, it demonstrates that even for even-even nuclei,
some time-odd densities are required to conserve Galilean invariance in the dynamic case.
Additionally, it proves that velocity-dependent interactions induced by a gauge transforma-
tion will only affect the kinetic energy (see Eq. (2.24)). In contrast, the nuclear EDF and
the Coulomb parts are invariant under gauge transformations.
A.3 Energy Added by Instantaneous Boosts
The adopted energy density function of the nuclear system is given by
E = Ekin + Eskyrme + Ecoul . (A.37)
A. GAUGE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SKYRME ENERGY
DENSITY FUNCTIONAL
As the contributions from the Skyrme and the Coulomb terms are gauge invariant, the only
energy contribution to the system from an instantaneous velocity boost applied by the trans-
formation (r) ei(r)(r) is in the form of kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is given by:
Ekin =
i (r)  i(r) . (A.38)
Substituting in the gauge transformed expression for the kinetic density (Eq. (A.17), noting
that j(r) for an initial static state is zero) gives:
Ekin =
(r)  (r)
d3r|(r)|2(r)
= Ekin + Ekin . (A.39)
The excitation energy, Ekin, is equivalent to a collective kinetic energy as (r) may be
interpreted as a velocity field [143]. The amount of energy imparted by the boost can be
computed precisely. Defining  as a scaling factor for the boost field ((r)  (r)), the
energy becomes
Ekin =
A2 |(r)|2  , (A.40)
where A is the integrated particle density. As A is constant, the energy is proportional to
the square of the boost strength . By rearranging for ,
Ekin
A |(r)|2 
, (A.41)
the magnitude of the boost may be fixed for a given Ekin.
A.3.1 Quadrupole Boost
As an example, to excite the nucleus by adding collective kinetic energy via a quadrupole
velocity field, one may consider
(r) = (2z2  x2  y2) . (A.42)
Therefore,
|(r)|2 = 2(4x2 + 4y2 + 16z2) . (A.43)
A.3 Energy Added by Instantaneous Boosts
Rearranging for , the relationship is given:
Ekin
A 4x2 + 4y2 + 16z2 
, (A.44)
which may be used to add a precise amount of excitation energy to an initially static config-
uration at t = 0 in the form of a collective quadrupole velocity boost.

The spherical harmonics, Ylm(), are defined by
Ylm(, ) = (1)m
2l + 1
(l m)
(l +m)
cos()
eim . (B.1)
Here, Plm
cos()
are Lagrange polynomials. When expressing the spherical harmonics, Ylm,
in Cartesian co-ordinates, it is convenient to take into account the following conversions from
spherical to the Cartesian co-ordinate system:
x = r sin  cos
y = r sin  sin
z = r cos  . (B.2)
Here,  is the polar angle, and  the azimuthal angle. The distance r may be defined as
r2 = x2 + y2 + z2 . (B.3)
The spherical harmonics Yl0, l = 1, ..., 4, will be given explicitly in the following (Y00 is
constant (= 1
)). These are the spherical harmonics which are required to defined the
deformation parameters lm used in this thesis (see Appendix B.2).
B.1.1 l = 1,m = 0

Y20(, ) =

(B.5)
B.1.3 l = 3,m = 0
Y30(, ) =

(B.6)

Y40(, ) =

8z4  24x2z2  24y2z2 + 3(x2 + y2)2
. (B.7)
B.1.5 l = 2,m = 2
The real part of the spherical harmonic Y22 is needed (as well as Y20) to define the Bohr-
Mottleson ,  parametrisation. The spherical harmonic is given by
Y22(, ) =
e2i sin2 
(x+ iy)2
, (B.8)
and the real part is
Y22(, ) =
x2  y2
. (B.9)
B.2 Deformation Parameters
The multipole moment Qlm is defined with respect to the centre of mass of the system by
the integral [57]
Qlm =
(r)rlYlm dr , (B.10)
where (r) is the particle density and Yl0 the spherical harmonic defined previously. The
dimensionless deformation parameter 20 is defined from the quadrupole moment Q20 [111]:
20 =
Ar2
(B.11)
B.2 Deformation Parameters
where here, r2 is the root mean square radius defined by
rn =
d3r rn(r)
, (B.12)
for the case n = 2, and A is the particle number.
Following the definition of the quadrupole deformation parameter 20, deformation pa-
rameters of a different order are defined:
10 =
30 =
Ar3
40 =
Ar4
The 4
constant scaling factor is included in the definition of 20 in Ref. [111], so it has been
adopted for consistency with the other deformation parameters.
The Bohr-Mottleson ,  parameters may be defined also, which gives a measurement of
the quadrupole deformation and the corresponding axial asymmetry [42]. In this case, the
deformation parameter 22 must be additionally considered. The parameter 22 is defined
from Q22, and is given by
22 =
. (B.13)
The parameter  is defined by combining 20 and 22
(20)2 + 2(22)2 , (B.14)
and  is defined by
 = atan
. (B.15)
The principle value of the atan function is in the range   , so 2 must be added to
negative values of . The parameter  can take a range of values from 0  360, but only
the 0  60 range is of interest, as the other sectors correspond to equivalent configurations
[42]. A value of  = 0 corresponds to an axially symmetric prolate deformed shape and
a value of  = 60 corresponds to an axially symmetric oblate deformed shape. Any other
values of  correspond to a triaxial deformation.
