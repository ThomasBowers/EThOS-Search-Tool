Lay Summary
Coloured final states are ubiquitous at hadron colliders such as the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). Therefore understanding high energy perturbative quantum chromody-
namics (QCD) at these experiments is essential not only as a test of the Standard Model,
but also because these processes form the dominant background to many searches
for new physics. One such standard candle is the production of a dilepton pair in
association with dijets. Here we present a new description of this final state (through
the production of a Z0 boson and virtual photon). This calculation adds to the fixed-
order accuracy the dominant logarithms in the limit of large partonic centre-of-mass
energy to all orders in the strong coupling s. This is achieved within the framework
of High Energy Jets. This calculation is made possible by extending the high energy
treatment to take into account the multiple t-channel exchanges arising from Z0 and
 -emissions off several quark lines. The correct description of the interference effects
from the various t-channel exchanges requires an extension of the subtraction terms
in the all-order calculation. We describe this construction and compare the resulting
predictions to a number of recent analyses of LHC data. The description of a wide
range of observables is good, and, as expected, stands out from other approaches in
particular in the regions of large dijet invariant mass and large dijet rapidity spans.
In addition we also present the application of the High Energy Jets framework to
two new experimental scenarios. Firstly, we show a comparison of High Energy Jets
matched to the ARIADNE parton shower to an ATLAS study of gap activity in dijet
events. We see that our description agrees well with the data throughout and in many
distributions gives the best theoretical description. This shows the extra logarithmic
corrections are essential to describe data already in LHC Run I. Secondly, we present
a study of Z0/ plus dijets at 100 TeV. We compare the behaviour of the high energy
logarithmic enhancements to the QCD perturbative series at 7 TeV and 100 Tev and see
that at any high energy hadronic Future Circular Collider (FCC) the effects described
by our resummation become significantly more important.
Abstract
Coloured final states are ubiquitous at hadron colliders such as the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). Therefore understanding high energy perturbative quantum chromody-
namics (QCD) at these experiments is essential not only as a test of the Standard Model,
but also because these processes form the dominant background to many searches
for new physics. One such standard candle is the production of a dilepton pair in
association with dijets. Here we present a new description of this final state (through
the production of a Z0 boson and ). This calculation adds to the fixed-order accuracy
the dominant logarithms in the limit of large partonic centre-of-mass energy to all orders
in the strong coupling s. This is achieved within the framework of High Energy Jets.
This calculation is made possible by extending the high energy treatment to take into
account the multiple t-channel exchanges arising from Z0 and gamma* -emissions off
several quark lines. The correct description of the interference effects from the various
t-channel exchanges requires an extension of the subtraction terms in the all-order
calculation. We describe this construction and compare the resulting predictions to a
number of recent analyses of LHC data. The description of a wide range of observables
is good, and, as expected, stands out from other approaches in particular in the regions
of large dijet invariant mass and large dijet rapidity spans.
In addition we also present the application of the High Energy Jets framework to
two new experimental scenarios. Firstly, we show a comparison of High Energy Jets
matched to the ARIADNE parton shower to an ATLAS study of gap activity in dijet

a study of Z0/ plus dijets at 100 TeV. We compare the behaviour of the high energy
logarithmic enhancements to the QCD perturbative series at 7 TeV and 100 Tev and see
that at any high energy hadronic Future Circular Collider (FCC) the effects described

the process Q2. The data points fitted are of varying degrees of formal
accuracy ranging from next-to-leading order in s (NLO) to next-to-
next-to-next-to-leading order in s (N

the transverse momenta in the event, HT , for inclusive dijets at a 7 TeV

2.3 Feynman diagrams for calculating the O(s) correction to 
  qq.
Fig. (2.3a) is the leading order contribution, A0. Figs. (2.3b)(2.3d) are
the virtual corrections Av, Ase1 and Ase2 respectively and figs. (2.3e)
(2.3f) are the real emission contributions Ar1 and Ar2 respectively. . . . 23
2.4 The ratio of the inclusive Higgs plus three jet cross-section to inclusive
Higgs plus two jet cross-section shown for centre-of-mass energies of
14TeV (similar to the current LHC), 33TeV and 100TeV (possible energy
scales for a hadronic future circular collider). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29
2.5 The probability of a third jet emission in W plus inclusive dijets as a
function of the rapidity gap between the two leading jets in rapidity at
the D experiment at the Tevatron experiment. The data are compared
to a number of fixed-order generators plus the leading logarithmic
accurate HEJ and the NLO accurate Blackhat+Sherpa. . . . . . . . . . 30
2.6 A simple importance sampling example (see eqn. (2.90)). The integrand,
f(x), is shown in blue, the importance sampling distribution is shown
in green and, for comparison, the uniform probability density function
used in the nave case of no importance sampling is also shown (in red). 43
2.7 The absolute value squared of the Z0 propagator for a range of values of
the invariant mass squared of the Z0, p2Z . We see that, as expected, it
is strongly peaked at the Z0 mass and, as such, is an ideal candidate for
using importance sampling. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 44
2.8 Recent parton distribution function fits from the HERA experiment. The
observed variation in f(xa/b, Q

reduce the variance of a Monte Carlo approach to computing eqn (2.41)

order in s in figs. (3.2a), (3.2b) and (3.2c) respectively. . . . . . . . . . 51
3.3 The leading logarithmic contributions to qg  qg at NLO. The uncrossed
diagram, MNLO,IIqQqQ, shown in (a) exchanges two gluons in the t channel
and the crossed diagram, MNLO,XqQqQ, case (b) exchanges two gluons in
the u channel and is related to (a) (up to a colour factor) via a crossing
symmetry . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 56
3.4 Three processes contributing to exclusive four jet production. (a) has
the maximum number of gluons exchanged in the t-channels (three) and
will dominate in the High Energy limit, (b) and (c) only have two and
one gluon which can reggeise. As such as we move from (a) to (c) we
will lose powers of large logarithms but maintain the same power of s
and therefore we can reasonably approximate quad-jet production by
neglecting (b) and (c) in the High Energy limit. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 59
3.5 The limiting behaviour of qg  qg in the regions of phase space where
either yg  yq or yq  yg. The intermediate diagrams indicate the flow
of colour through the process. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 60

of the transverse momentum, k. Emissions are required to be well
separated from the emitting parton by enforcing a cut of r  0.5 Figure

shown for a slice through the final state phase-space defined
by eqn. (4.5). We compare to the leading order result obtained from
MadGraph aMC@NLO. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 80
4.3 The matrix-element squared divided by the square of the partonic centre-
of-mass energy for qQ  ZqQ with the Z0 decaying to an electron-
positron pair for the phase space slice described in eqn. (4.5). Increasing
values of  represent increasing rapidity separation between the jets.
The different lines show the contributions from different terms in the
calculation: only emission from the forward or the backward quark line
(black, dashed and green, dotted), their sum without the interference
term (magenta, dotted) and their sum including interference (red, solid)
which is seen to agree exactly with the LO result (blue, thick solid). . . 82
LIST OF FIGURES
4.4 The matrix-element squared divided by the square of the partonic centre-
of-mass energy for qQ Z/qQ with the Z/ decaying to an electron-
positron pair. The O(2sW ) tree-level contribution as described in HEJ
(red, dashed) exactly matches that of MadGraph aMC@NLO (blue, solid).
The terms corresponding to the production of a Z0 boson only (green,
dotted) significantly undershoots the full result. The virtual photon
terms are, therefore, clearly an important contribution to the matrix
element away from the Z0 Breit-Wigner peak. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 84
4.5 A slice through phase space for the Z/+ 3 jet final state. The slice
defined is akin to that described for the 2 jet case in fig. (4.2) where as
 increases we pull apart all three jets and the leptonic decay products
are emitted increasingly far into the forward direction. . . . . . . . . . . 86
4.6 A slice through phase space for the Z/+ 3 jet final state. The slice
defined is akin to that described for the 2 and 3 jet case shown in fig. (4.2)
and fig. (4.5) respectively. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 87
4.7 Examples of both real and virtual diagrams contributing to 2  3
scattering. In fig. (4.7a) the p2 has been drawn with a dashed line to
denote it is not resolvable. In fig. (4.7b) the final state momenta have
been labelled in a seemingly strange way - this was done to make clear
the cancellation when working through the algebra. . . . . . . . . . . . . 95
4.8 The effect of varying cut on the differential distribution in the rapidity
gap between the two leading jets in p, yj1,j2, with the Njet = 2, 3, 4
exclusive selections shown from left to right. cut = 0.2 (red), 0.5

gap between the two extremal jets in rapidity, yjf,jb, with the Njet =
2, 3, 4 exclusive selections shown from left to right. cut = 0.2 (red), 0.5

4.10 These plots show the inclusive jet rates from (a) HEJ and (b) other theory
descriptions and data [2]. HEJ events all contain at least two jets and do
not contain matching for 5 jets and above, so these bins are not shown. 107
4.11 These plots show the invariant mass between the leading and second-
leading jet in pT . As in Fig. (4.10), predictions are shown from (a) HEJ
and (b) other theory descriptions and data [2]. These studies will inform
Higgs plus dijets analyses, where cuts are usually applied to select events

leading and second leading jet in pT from (a) HEJ and (b) other theory
descriptions and data [2]. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 108

show the di-lepton invariant mass range from 30-60 GeV and lastly

figs. (2.9b-e) which probe regions away from the Breit-Wigner peak two

Chapter 1
Introduction
1.1 A Little History
The Standard Model is a gauge quantum field theory describing three of the four
observed fundamental forces - with the inclusion of gravity remaining elusive. Its local
gauge structure is given by:
SU(3)c  SU(2)L  U(1)Y . (1.1)
The subscripts on the groups are simply a convenient notation. The c on SU(3)
indicates that it is the strong colour coupling being described. The L on SU(2)
stands for left and indicates that all right-handed states are in the trivial representation
of the group and the Y on the U(1) indicates that this is the hypercharge group and
not the electromagnetic group.
The SU(3)c group describes the strong nuclear force (Quantum Chromodynamics or
QCD) and its 8 gauge generators give us the massless spin-1 gluons, G
a(x), a = 1, . . . , 8,
present in the standard model. There are three weak boson states, W
a (s), a = 1, . . . , 3,
associated with the SU(2)L group and a further one, B
(x), which comes from the
U(1)Y group.
The only remaining boson to complete the standard model arises from the complex
scalar Higgs field whose ground state is not invariant under the action of SU(2)L 
U(1)Y . This field breaks the standard model gauge symmetry to
SU(3)c  U(1)em, (1.2)
1.2. Thesis Outline
where the U(1)em refers to the electromagnetic charge. After this Spontaneous
Symmetry Breaking occurs three of the four aforementioned bosons, W
a (s) and B
acquire mass and combinations of them are physically realised as the experimentally
observed electroweak bosons; the massive states W, Z0 and the massless photon, .
The photon and the Z0 bosons are of particular importance in the work that follows.
The fundamental particle content of the Standard Model also includes fermions. These
are spin-1/2 particles which obey the spin-statistics theorem (and hence the Pauli
exclusion principle) and comprise, along with the gluons which bind the nucleus
together, all known visible matter in the universe. The fermions are structured in
three so-called generations, shown in tab. (1.1) and can be further subdivided into
quarks and leptons. Quarks are colour triplets under QCD but are also charged under
the electroweak group. The up (u), charm (c) and top (t) quarks have electric charge
while the down (d), strange (s) and bottom (b) quarks have 1
. Leptons are not
charged under SU(3) and so do not couple to the strong sector directly. The charged
leptons e,  and  have electric charge 1 and the neutrinos are neutral.

1.2 Thesis Outline
The aim of this thesis is to detail the importance of a certain class of perturbatively
higher-order terms in events with QCD radiation in the final state. In particular we
will consider high energy corrections to parton-parton collisions with a Z0 or  in
association with high energy QCD radiation in the final state.
In chapter 2 I will begin by introducing quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the
strong sector in the standard model, and detail how we might use this to calculate
physical observables (such as cross-sections and differential distributions) at hadron
colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider. I will discuss how these observables
fall prey to divergences in QCD-like quantum field theories with massless states and
talk briefly about how such divergences can be handled. I will then describe how the
computationally expensive integrals derived in subsequent chapters may be efficiently
evaluated using Monte-Carlo techniques.
In chapter 3 the details of QCD in the High Energy limit are discussed. After
completing a few instructive calculations we will see how, in this limit, the traditional
fixed-order perturbation theory view of calculating cross-sections fades as another
1.2. Thesis Outline
subset of terms, namely the Leading Logarithmic terms in s
, become more important.
I will discuss previous work in the High Energy limit of QCD and how this can be
used to factorise complex parton-parton scattering amplitudes into contractions of
currents which, when combined with gauge-invariant effective gluon emission terms
and the Lipatov ansatz for virtual corrections can be used to construct approximate
high-multiplicity matrix elements.
In chapter 4 the work of the previous chapter is extended to the case where there is
a massive Z0 boson or an off-shell photon, , in the final state. A current for this
process is derived and the complexities arising from two separate sources of interference
are explored. This new expression for the matrix element is seen to be in exact
agreement when compared to the leading order in s generator MadGraph5 aMC@NLO
(v5). The higher order corrections to this result must then be regularised to treat
the divergences discussed in chapter 2 and this process is presented. The procedure for
matching this regularised result to Leading Order results is shown and the importance of
the inclusion of these non-resummation terms is discussed. Lastly, three comparisons
of the High Energy Jets (often abbreviated to HEJ and pronounced High) Z+Jets
Monte Carlo generator to recent experimental studies ATLAS and CMS at the LHC are
shown and discussed.
In chapter 5 we discuss the results of a lengthy study of jet production from the ATLAS
collaboration. This analysis was a thorough look at BFKL-like dynamics in proton-
proton colliders and the HEJ predictions are seen to describe the data well in the
regions of phase-space where we know the effects of our resummation become relevant.
We compare the predictions from both partonic HEJ and HEJ interfaced with ARIADNE,
a parton shower. Although the interface to ARIADNE increases the computational
complexity significantly; we see that the corrections it contributes significantly improve
the description of data.
In chapter 6 we show a study of Z/+Jets at a centre-of-mass energy of 100 TeV
relevant for the discussion of the next generation of high energy particle physics
experiments (such as any Future Circular Collider) which are currently of great interest
to the community at large. We see that the higher-order perturbative terms are much
larger at 100 TeV relative to 7 TeV data and predictions. Moreover, the regions of
phase-space relevant for this thesis; that of high energy wide-angle QCD radiation is
especially enhanced and, therefore resumming these contributions will be essential for
precision physics at any Future Circular Collider.
Finally, in chapter 7 I summarise the results of the above chapters and provide a short
outlook for future work.

Hadronic Colliders
2.1 The QCD Lagrangian
We obtain the QCD Lagrangian by considering the spin-1
Dirac Lagrangian for the
case of a fermionic fields  each with mass m:
LD = i
i/ m
j , (2.1)
where i is itself a vector of 3 fermion fields in the fundamental representation of SU(3)
with i = 1, . . . , 31. This is manifestly invariant under the global SU(3) transformation
i  ei
aTaiji (2.2)
where a = 1, . . . , 8, a are constant and T a are the generators of the SU(3) group. We
choose to promote this global symmetry to a local one by relaxing the constraint that
a are constant and instead allow them to depend on a space-time coordinate i.e.
a = a(x). (2.3)
1The choice of 3 here is, again, well experimentally verified. Here we will work explicitly with the
gauge group SU(3) although many of the results which follow can be derived with a more general
special unitary group SU(Nc).
2.1. The QCD Lagrangian
This breaks the SU(3) symmetry but we can recover the required invariance by
replacing the usual partial derivative term with a covariant derivative defined by:
Dij = 
ij  igsA
aT aij , (2.4)
where gs is the QCD coupling constant and A
 is the QCD gauge field associated with
the gluon. With this replacement the local SU(3) invariance of eqn. (2.1) is recovered.
We must also include the effect of the kinetic term for the gluon field in our theory
which we do by considering the field-strength tensor for Aa, F
 . This is given by:
F a = A
  Aa + gsfabcAbAc (2.5)
where fabc are constants which define the algebra of the SU(3) group and are given by
[T a, T b] = ifabcT c. (2.6)
Eqn. (2.6) is what makes QCD fundamentally different from Quantum Electrodynamics
(QED): the simple fact that the generators of the underlying group do not commute
makes performing calculations in QCD significantly more complicated than its Abelian
cousin QED.
In summary then, the QCD Lagrangian is given by
LQCD (classical) = 
F aF
a +
i /D mf
j , (2.7)
where we have now generalised to the experimentally proven case of 6 flavours of quark
in our model (outlined previously in tab. (1.1)). This is referred to as the classical
QCD Lagrangian since we have not included quantum effects such as loop corrections.
The full quantum Lagrangian is as follows [65]:
LQCD =
ij mf
F aF
a 
(Aa)
+ (ca)Dab cb, (2.8)
where D is the covariant derivative in the adjoint representation given by
2.2. The Partonic Cross-Section
Dab = ab  gsfabcAc. (2.9)
The final two terms arise from the treatment of a degeneracy in the QCD path integral
which is caused by the gauge symmetry we enforced earlier - as a result we are only
able to define a gluon propagator once we have fixed the gauge which is achieved by
including by the penultimate term in eqn. (2.8).  is a free parameter in this process
and, as we will see when we come to define the gluon propagator, its choice defines
a specific gauge. The final term is a mathematical quirk of this process and c and
c represent the resulting QCD ghost and anti-ghost fields respectively. They are
unphysical since they represent spin-0 anti-commuting fields.
2.2 The Partonic Cross-Section
Now we have a complete Lagrangian for QCD we can begin to move towards physical
observables. The first step towards this is the Lehman-Symanzik-Zimmerman (LSZ)
reduction formula. This gives us a relation between the scattering amplitude from some
initial state into some final state, f |i  f |S|i where S is the scattering matrix, and
a time-ordered vacuum expectation operator of a product of fields. Here we briefly
present the argument behind the LSZ formula for the case of 2  2 scattering using
scalar phi-cubed theory for simplicity. The Lagrangian for this theory is given by:
Lphi-cubed =
+
2  g
3. (2.10)
We can Fourier expand the field, (x), in terms of its annihilation and creating operators
as follows:
(x) =
2E(2)3
a(~k)eikx + a(~k)eikx
, (2.11)
and inverting this we find the following form for the creation operator a(~k):
a(~k) = i
d3xeixk(0  E)(x). (2.12)
We expect that as time flows forward to + (or backwards to -) the field, (x),
become asymptotically free and therefore we can neglect any interaction effects in these
2.2. The Partonic Cross-Section
extremes. From eqn. (2.12) it is straightforward to show that:
a(~k, t =) a(~k, t = ) = i
d4xeixk(2 +m2)(x). (2.13)
Clearly this would be zero if we only consider the free theory where g = 0 in eqn. (2.10)
- intuitively this is correct since once we remove any interaction terms a state we create
at t =  should flow to t = unaltered. However, more generally for an interacting
theory it will be non-zero and eqn. (2.13) gives us a relationship between asymptotically
free initial and final states. Using eqn. (2.13) (and its hermitian conjugate) we can begin
to look at the scattering from a 2 particle initial state |i to some 2 particle final state
|f, k1 + k2  k1 + k2, this is given by:
i|j  0|T
a( ~k1,)a( ~k2,)a( ~k1,)a( ~k2,))
|0, (2.14)
where T denotes the time-ordered product of operators. After substituting for the a
and a operators and seeing that the time-ordering means that all of the remaining
annihilation/creation operators end up acting on a vacuum state which they annihilate
we are left with:
i|j = i4
d4x1d
4x2d
ik1x1(2x1
+m2)eik
2x2(2x2
+m2)
eik1x1(2x1 +m
2)eik2x2(2x2 +m
(x1)(x
2)(x1)(x2)
This is the LSZ reduction formula for 2 2 scattering in phi-cubed theory. It reduces
the problem of finding scattering amplitudes to the calculation of time-ordered product
of fields under the assumption that we may treat the fields at t =  as free.
The next step is to see how we can calculate these time-ordered products. This is most
conveniently done by taking functional derivatives of the QCD path integral given by:
Z[J, , , , ] =
DADDDcDcei
d4x(LQCD+AaJa+
a+aa+caa+aca), (2.15)
where Ja, a, a, a and a are source terms which we target with functional
derivatives and we have left the sum over quark flavours implicit. In order to proceed we
2.2. The Partonic Cross-Section
break down eqn. (2.1) into a free Lagrangian, LQCD,0, and an interacting Lagrangian,
LQCD,I as follows:
LQCD = LQCD,0 + LQCD,I ,
LQCD,0 = i
i/ m
  Aa)(Aa  Aa)
(Aa)
+ (ca)(c
LQCD,I = gs
T aij
j  gs
fabc(A
  Aa)AbAc
fabef cdeAaA
cAd  gsfabccacbAc.
We can then rewrite eqn. (2.15) as a combination of functional derivatives acting on
the free QCD path integral, Z0 as:
Z[J, , , , ] = exp
d4xLQCD,I
iJa
Z0[J, , , , ],
(2.16)
where Z0 is identical to eqn. (2.15) but with the free Lagrangian in place of the full
Lagrangian. We can solve Z0 exactly which yields the propagators for the gluons,
quarks and ghosts, respectively:
0|Aa(x)Ab (y)|0 =
(2)4
eik(xy)ab
g  (1 )k
, (2.17a)
0|i
(f )
j (y)|0 =

eik(xy)ijff 
i(/k +m)
k2 m2 , (2.17b)
0|ca(x)cb(y)|0 =
(2)4
eik(xy)ab
. (2.17c)
We can read off the remaining QCD vertex factors directly from the interaction
Lagrangian (or - more rigorously derive them by Taylor expanding eqn. (2.16) and
disregarding any irrelevant diagrams such as those where no scattering occurs or those
with bubble contributions). We will use u(p) and v(p) are Dirac spinors which solve
the free Dirac equation for a plane-wave:
2.2. The Partonic Cross-Section
(i/pm)u(p) = 0 (i/p+m)v(p) = 0. (2.18)
The full set of rules for the vertices and propagators are summarised in tab. (2.1) and
the remaining Feynman rules may be summarised as:
1. Incoming external lines with spin s and momentum p are given a factor of u
i (p)
i (p) for quarks or anti-quarks. Similarly outgoing external quark or anti-
quark lines get a factor u
i (p) or v
i (p). If the external particles are not coloured
the procedure is the same but of course the spinors will no longer be SU(3)
fundamental vectors. External gluons with momentum p, polarisation  and
colour a are replaced by a(p) or a(p) for either incoming or outgoing states.
2. For each vertex or propagator in the Feynman diagram insert the corresponding
mathematical expression (see tab. (2.1)). The order of the Lorentz indices must
be the same as that found by tracing the fermion lines in the diagram backwards,
3. A factor of (1) must be included for each anti-fermion line flowing from the
initial state to the final state,
4. A factor of (1) must be included for each fermion, anti-fermion or ghost loop in
the diagram
5. An integration over any unconstrained momenta in the diagram must be included
with measure: 
(2)4
, (2.19)
where k is the momenta in question and the integral is understood to run over
all four momentum components from zero up to infinity,
6. A diagram dependent symmetry factor must be included,
7. Lastly, for an unpolarised calculation we must sum over initial spin and colour
and average over all possible final spins and colours.
The result of following these Feynman rules is what we refer to as the matrix element,
iM. We will now detail how we go from the matrix element of some scattering process
to a useful physical observable: the partonic cross-section, . The matrix element
is related to the fully-differential cross-section by Fermis golden rule which, for a
scattering process pa + pb  p1 + . . .+ pm is given by

the preceding equations i and j represent fundamental colour indices, a and b represent
adjoint colour indices and, where present, f and f  represent fermion flavour. All Greek

chapters to include the considerations of parton distribution functions and jet clustering
algorithms for the initial and final states respectively).
2.3 Divergences and Regularisation
In the preceding section we saw that any unconstrained momenta in a Feynman diagram
must be integrated over to account for all possible ways the momenta in the process
may flow. We refer to these contributions as loop-level corrections. When calculating
these corrections we encounter divergences of various kinds which can be divided up
into three classes based on how they arise.
2.3.1 Ultraviolet divergences
Ultraviolet divergences (UV) occur when all the components of a loop momenta grow
large, k  , such that k2 becomes the dominant term in propagator. Since these
extremely high momentum modes correspond to physics at very short distance scales
we choose to interpret these divergences as an indication that our theory is only an
effective theory and we shouldnt attempt to apply it to all scales. We can quickly spot
diagrams with these pathologies with a power counting argument. For example, one
might have a diagram which results in a term such as the following:
k2(k2 m2) , (2.21)
where m is some finite mass. In the UV region where k   this is asymptotically
2.3. Divergences and Regularisation
equal to:
, (2.22)
which is clearly logarithmically divergent.
2.3.2 Infrared and collinear divergences
Infrared and collinear divergences (IRC) occur in theories with massless gauge bosons,
such as the gluon in QCD, since a particle may emit any number of arbitrarily such
bosons with infinitesimally small energy and we would never be able to resolve them. In
contrast to the UV divergences the IR becomes important in the region of phase space
where k2  0. A similar power counting analysis to that above can be applied here.
For example if we consider the one-loop correction to the vertex diagram in massless
phi-cubed from section (2.2) we would find an integral of the form [73]:
(2)4
k2(p1  k)2(p2 + k)2
, (2.23)
where k is the loop momentum, q = p1 + p2 is the incoming momentum and pi the
outgoing momenta. Writing each momentum in light-cone coordinates with p1 in the
plus-direction, p2 in the minus-direction, such that:
p1  (p+1 , 0,~0) p2  (0, p
~0). (2.24)
and taking the Eikonal approximation, we have:
dk+kk2T
(2)4
(2k+k  k2T )(2p
)(2p2 k
dk+kk2T
(2)4
(2k+k  k2T )(k)(k+)
(2.25)
where q2 = 2p1 p2 since pi are massless. Here we can further subdivide the divergences
into a soft sector and a collinear one.
2.3. Divergences and Regularisation
Considering first the soft regime where we let all the components of our integration
variable, k become small at the same rate, that is, k
  
q2 where  0 then after
a change of variables eqn. (2.25) becomes:
, (2.26)
which diverges logarithmically for small lambda. The collinear sector follows similarly
if we now look at the following scaling:
q2 k  2
q2 k2T  
q2. (2.27)
As we decrease  we make k increasingly collinear to either p1 or p2. Using this scaling
we exactly reproduce eqn. (2.26) and therefore we also have a collinear divergence.
2.3.3 Regularising divergences
If we are to extract any useful information from diagrams contributing above leading-
order we must find ways to control these divergences. These methods are called
regularisation schemes. The general approach with all regularisation schemes is to
introduce a new parameter to the calculation which is used to get a handle on exactly
how the integral diverges. Once we have performed the integration we take the limiting
case where the effect of the regulator vanishes and we will see that the divergence
now presents itself as some singular function of the regulator. There are many ways
to regularise divergences each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Here we
briefly describe three common approaches.
Given that the integrands seen so far only diverge in certain regions (very large or
very small momenta) perhaps the most obvious thing to do is to manually alter the
limits of our integration. This is the momentum cut-off scheme. We simply replace the
upper (lower) bound with some finite large (small) value, 2. This will regulate any
UV (soft) divergences and allow us to complete the calculation provided there are no
collinear singularities which this approach cannot regulate. While this method has the
advantage of being conceptually very simple it also has the disadvantage of breaking
translational and gauge invariance. Worse still is that simply limiting the integration
to avoid the extremities has no effect on the collinear sector.
2.3. Divergences and Regularisation
An alternative which does keep both gauge and translational invariance is the Pauli-
Villars regularisation scheme [67]. In this picture we introduce an extra field which has
the opposite spin-statistics and therefore has the effect of suppressing the very high
mass region in the integrand as follows
(2)4
p2 m2 
(2)4
p2 m2 
p2 M2
, (2.28)
where M is the mass of the Pauli-Villars field with mM . However, once again this
does not treat any problems in the IRC sectors.
Lastly we have dimensional regularisation. Here we analytically continue the number
of dimensions in our integral away from d = 4. We still want to be able to return to
our physical four dimensional theory and so we choose
d = 4 2 (2.29)
where  is the regulator by which we control the divergence. Clearly then the limit  0
would recover our original theory. It is worth noting that there are many conventions
for defining epsilons but up to signs and factors of 2 they are equivalent. Dimensional
regularisation treats both the UV and the IRC divergences and translational and gauge
invariance are preserved. The disadvantage is that this modification changes the Dirac
algebra relations which typically makes computing the integrals more involved.
When working in d dimensions the QCD coupling is no longer dimensionless. We can
see this since the action is dimensionless and therefore we have
[L] = d. (2.30)
By considering the kinetic terms of the gluon and quark fields we can see that we must
[g] + 2[] + [A] = d, (2.31)
and therefore
[g] =
. (2.32)
2.4. The QCD Beta Function
In order to artificially fix this and restore the coupling to its dimensionless state we
introduce a scale parameter, r, as follows:
g = g0r
2 . (2.33)
The introduction of this scale has important consequences for our theory. Here we
follow the instructive example from [68]. Say we have some dimensionless observable,
R, which depends on one large scale, Q, which is much larger than all other scales
in the problem (e.g. the quark masses). One would assume that R is approximately
independent of this large scale but when we come to regulate and renormalise the
divergences we have seen in this section the problem becomes one involving two scales
and R develops a dependence on the ratio of these scales,
. Since r is completely
arbitrary R must be independent of it for our theory to give meaningful predictions i.e
if we now consider R as a function of both the QCD coupling strength, s, and the
ratio of the scales we must have that
+ 2r
= 0. (2.34)
For convenience we define t = ln
and (s) = 
and so we can write (2.34) as
R(et, s)
 (s)
R(et, s)
= 0. (2.35)
This can be solved by defining the running QCD coupling,  = (Q2)
 (Q2)
, (2.36)
where  = (Q2) admits the boundary condition (2r) = s. Therefore the scale
dependence of our observable R comes about through its dependence on s only.
2.4 The QCD Beta Function
QCD has two striking features which are not immediately apparent from the Lagrangian
derived above. The first is asymptotic freedom. This is the fact that at high energies
the QCD coupling strength becomes increasingly weak and it is this which allows us to
perform a perturbative expansion of physical observables such as cross-sections. The
2.4. The QCD Beta Function
second feature is confinement. Confinement is the reason we do not observe bare quarks
and gluons in nature, instead we only see colourless bound states of these fundamental
QCD partons. This is because at very low energies the coupling strength becomes
increasingly strong.
As we saw in section 2.3 when we renormalise QCD to remove the ultraviolet
singularities we introduce a scale dependence in the coupling strength, s = s(r).
This can be interpreted as a measure of our ignorance of the true high-scale theory
which governs nature, that is to say, we believe QCD is the right theory only up to
some scale r. The evolution of s with r is given by the renormalisation group
equation:
= (s(
r)), (2.37)
where (s) is the beta function. It can be expanded perturbatively as a series in s
as follows:
(s) = 0s
1 + 1s + 2
s + . . .
, (2.38)
where the perturbative coefficients, i, can be calculated using the methods of
section (2.2). For example the leading order contribution, 0, is given by:
0 = 11
. (2.39)
If we truncate eqn. (2.38) at leading-order in s then we can solve eqn. (2.37) and we
see that the coupling, s(r), runs with the following form:
1 + (2r)
. (2.40)
It is clear from this (since in the standard model we have nf  6 and therefore 0 > 0)2
that as Q2 tends to zero the coupling strength becomes very large and at high values for
Q2 we see that s(Q
2) 0. This later limit is exactly the asymptotic freedom property
of QCD and it holds even when we include the higher order terms we neglected in the
2The number of fermions we consider depends on the energy scale we are at. Clearly we must be at an
energy larger than the mass of any given quark for it to be produced. This was experimentally observed
in the famous R-ratio where the ratio of the e+e  hadrons cross-section to the e+e  + cross-
section was investigated
2.5. QCD Factorisation at Hadronic Colliders
leading-order approximation used to arrive at eqn. (2.40) [27]. It is an essential result
in that it allows us to perform perturbative expansions of observables and without this
none of the following work would be possible. The evolution of the strong coupling with
Q2 is shown in fig. (2.1), it shows several extracted values of s based on six various
types of experiment. For example, the hadronic collider predictions include studies
of the ratio of the 3-jet inclusive cross-section to the 2-jet inclusive cross-section as a
means of finding the strong coupling [37].

 We note, however, that in many such studies, like those based on exclusive states of
jet multiplicities, the relevant energy scale of the measurement is not uniquely defined.
For instance, in studies of the ratio of 3- to 2-jet cross sections at the LHC, the relevant
scale was taken to be the average of the transverse momenta of the two leading jets [379],
but could alternatively have been chosen to be the transverse momentum of the 3rd jet.

2.5 QCD Factorisation at Hadronic Colliders
So far we have only talked about the very general idea of two particles interacting and
scattering off one another into some final state which we are interested in. This is too
simple a picture when we are considering hadronic colliders such as the Large Hadron
Collider (proton-proton), the Tevatron (proton-antiproton), HERA (proton-lepton) or
a potential Future Circular Collider (FCC) with a hadronic initial state.
At experiments we collide QCD bound states with one another but in practice when
calculating cross-sections we perform a sum over the possible combinations of initial
states we may encounter in the two incoming hadrons. In order to do this we must
have a good understanding of the dynamics of the partons inside the onrushing hadrons;
2.6. From Partons to Jets
this understanding is encoded in the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs). A PDF,
fi/H(x,Q
2) is a function which tells us how likely we are to find a parton of type i
carrying a fraction, x, of the total hadrons momentum in a hadron, of type H, during
a collision occurring at an energy scale Q. Because the PDFs contain non-perturbative
information we cannot compute their properties in the same way as we calculate cross-
sections, instead they are determined by fitting to data from a range of experiments
(such as those mentioned above). Once we have the PDFs we can compute the physical
hadronic cross-sections, , by convoluting two of them - one for each hadron - with the
partonic cross-section for the scattering of partons of type i and j, ij , discussed in
section (2.2) and summing over the possible initial partons as follows:
(Q2) =
fa,fb
dxadxbfa/Ha(xa, Q
2)fb/Hb(xb, Q
2)ij(s(r), 
r , 
f ). (2.41)
Eq. (2.41) can be intuitively understood as the separation of scales; the long distance
physics of the PDFs is manifestly distinct from the short distance hard scatter contained
in the partonic cross-section. The scale at which we separate the long and short range
physics is called the factorisation scale, f . As with the renormalisation scale it is
not a priori clear what is the correct factorisation scale and results of perturbative
calculations are often quoted with a scale uncertainty band derived from varying this
parameter.
2.6 From Partons to Jets
As alluded to in section (2.4) the computation of scattering amplitudes can only take us
so far when comparing simulations to experiments. In particular, the final state quarks
and gluons in our perturbative picture of QCD differ from the confined hadrons observed
at hadronic colliders: It is well known that final state QCD partons fragment and emit
showers of additional radiation before finally they becomes colourless bound states in
a process known as hadronisation. This process is not perturbatively well-understood
since it occurs below a scale, QCD, at which QCD becomes non-perturbative, i.e. the
coupling constant of the theory has become too large for us to legitimately truncate a
perturbative expansion. There are models for both the parton shower behaviour of the
energetic final state partons, such as Pythia [72], Herwig [39] and Sherpa [56] as well
as models for the hadronisation such as the Lund string model [23] implemented in
various physics software packages but most relevantly (for the remainder of this thesis)
- in the Ariadne code [18,63].
2.6. From Partons to Jets
All high energy collider experiments see a great deal of QCD radiation in the final
state. This radiation, produced through the mechanisms outlined above, appears in
columnated structures called jets and so it is at the jet level that we may compare
our simulated results to actual measurements. The question of how we best map from
the two or more parton level to the jet level is not a trivial one: a single high-energy
(or hard) parton may split and form two final state jets but equally two low energy
(or soft) partons may combine into a single jet.
There are several approaches to this problem include the SISCone algorithm [70] and
Pythias own implementation CellJet [71]. However the most commonly used family
of jet reconstruction algorithm are know as the sequential recombination algorithms.
This group of approaches include the Cambridge-Aachen, kT and anti-kT algorithms.
The general algorithm, as given in [33], is:
1. Given a list of final state partons calculate some generalised distance, dij , between
all possible combinations of jets i and j as well as diB, for all i, where B is the
beam-line,
2. We identify the smallest value of these. If, say dab is the smallest, we combine
partons a and b. If however daB is the smallest then we call a a jet and remove
it from the list of partons,
3. We then recompute all the generalised distances and repeat steps 1 and 2 until
no further partons remain,
The generalised distances are defined as
dij = min(k
i, k
diB = k
(2.42)
where ki is the transverse momentum of the i
th parton, R is a free parameter in the
clustering which relates to the size of the jets and R2 is the distance in the detector
metric between the two partons given by R2 = 2 + y2 where  and y are
the angular distance (about the beam line) between the partons and the rapidity gap
between the partons respectively. The parameter, p, specifies precisely which clustering
algorithm we are using; p = 0 reduces eqn. (2.42) to the Cambridge-Aachen scheme
while p = 1 give the kT and anti-kT algorithms respectively. The question of which
to use is outlined in detail in [33] but we give a brief summary here.
The choice of jet algorithm boils down to a handful of key properties the algorithm
2.7. Perturbative QCD and Resummation
must exhibit. Given a set of hard QCD final states we require that the result of the
clustering algorithm, i.e. the jets and jet shapes, are not unduly sensitive to additional
soft and collinear radiation. This is intuitively clear since, for example, a final state with
a single high energy quark with momentum, kT i, may radiate infinitely a multitude of
infinitely soft gluons, kTsi , which may, or may not, be collinear to the original parton
- but since kTsi  kTi the result must be a single jet, jT i, which has jT i  kT i.
Any algorithm which satisfies this is said to be infra-red and collinear (IRC) safe. We
also want an algorithm which is insensitive to the hadronisation model used, or any
possible extra multiple-parton or experimental pile-up emissions since these things are,
at present, poorly understood. It is also worth mentioning that since jet clustering
algorithms are used in experimental triggers to quickly catagorise events they should
be as computationally cheap as possible.
Although the Cambridge-Aachen algorithm has advantages in some experimental
searches such as studies where the substructure of jets is of particular interest [6,31], the
most widely used sequential recombination algorithm is the anti-kt algorithm (p = 1)
and so all of the work which follows and all of the experimental comparisons made will
use this as the method for mapping simulated parton level results to a more useful set
of jet level results. The jet size parameter R varies between experiments but is typically
either 0.4 for ATLAS analyses or 0.5 for CMS analyses.
2.7 Perturbative QCD and Resummation
In section 2.2 we saw that we could separate out the QCD Lagrangian into free and
interacting components and that vacuum expectations of time ordered fields could
be found by taking functional derivatives of the free partition function (eqn. (2.16)).
Since terms which give rise to interactions in the Lagrangian come with a factor of
the coupling strength, g, Taylor expanding the exponential in eqn. (2.16) will yield an
infinite series of terms and, in principle, in order to compute any physical observable
exactly we must calculate all of these. Of course in practice this is not possible. We
must choose a subset of terms from this infinite array which we reason will give the
best possible approximation to the full series.
2.7.1 Fixed-order Perturbation Theory
The fixed-order perturbative approach operates on the assumption that since, as we
saw in section 2.4, the coupling strength s in the expansion becomes small at large
energy scales we may simply truncate the series at some power of s. For example
2.7. Perturbative QCD and Resummation
given a cross-section of some scattering X  Y we wish to calculate, the fixed order
picture of the expansion would be:
XY = 
is(Q
2)C(i)XY (2.43)
where C(i)XY are the coefficient terms which encode the kinematics of the diagrams
contributing at each order in the series. Since we expect that the more terms we
can calculate the better our truncated series will approximate the full result we should
choose N as large as possible though in principal it is determined by the complexity and
the computational cost of the relevant calculation of the coefficient functions. Recent
progress has allowed the automation of next-to-leading order QCD calculations (N = 2)
in packages such in MadGraph aMC@NLO (v5) [13], BlackHat+Sherpa [28], MC@NLO [48]
and Powheg [47]. It is not known in general how to compute multi-loop (N  2)
calculations and while process specific calculations have been completed [32, 50, 52], it
is still very much a hot topic in theoretical particle physics.
It is important to note the limitations of this fixed-order scheme. For example, if we
were to consider NLO corrections to dijet production we would only be able to produce
final states with two or three jets (since we can only have one extra real emission).
Clearly this is a limitation since high energy partons can radiate arbitrarily many
extra gluons into the final state. Fig. (2.2) shows precisely this phenomenon, the NLO
calculations (shown in green and black) are limited to jets  3 while the predictions
from POWHEJ+PYTHIA and HEJ which include higher-order corrections predict a higher
average number of jets. Note that the higher-order corrections here are not the same
in the case of POWHEJ+PYTHIA and HEJ (although the two predictions have been seen to
both agree well with data in the past [9]. Also note that although the scale uncertainty
band of the NLO calculation does exceed jets = 3 this is not a result of the formalism
but instead comes about as the result of the instability of NLO at large values of HT .
This scale dependence of observables will be discussed in more detail in chapter 3.
There are frameworks to allow the merging of NLO calculations of different multiplic-
ity. A comprehensive review of such methods may be found in [11].
We now summarise an instructive fixed-order calculation of the next-to-leading
corrections to quark-antiquark pair production via an off-shell photon [44]. The full
calculation can be found in appendix A.

2.7.2 An Example Fixed-Order Calculation
The Feynman diagrams which need to be included for the leading order and next-
to-leading order corrections to the   qq process are shown in fig. (2.3). We
refer to fig. (2.3a) as the tree level diagram, fig. (2.3b) as the vertex correction and
figs. (2.3c) and (2.3d) as the self-energy corrections. Figs. (2.3e) and (2.3f) are the real
corrections. Since the virtual corrections all have the same final state they must be
summed and squared together. To make the order of each term in the perturbative
expansion clear we extract the s factors from the Ai here. Therefore:
|M12|2 =|A0 + sAv + sAse1 + sAse2|2 +O(2s)
=|A0|2 + 2s<{A0Av}+ 2s<{A0Ase1}
+ 2s<{A0Ase2}+O(2s),
(2.44)
We can see then that to O(s) we have four contributions to consider, but the two self-
energy contributions will have the same functional form so it would seem that in practice
we only need to perform three calculations - it turns out this is not the case; we will
find that the divergence associated with exchanging a soft gluon in fig. (2.3b) can only

Figure 2.3: Feynman diagrams for calculating the O(s) correction to 
  qq.
Fig. (2.3a) is the leading order contribution, A0. Figs. (2.3b)(2.3d) are the virtual
corrections Av, Ase1 and Ase2 respectively and figs. (2.3e)(2.3f) are the real emission
contributions Ar1 and Ar2 respectively.
2.7. Perturbative QCD and Resummation
be cancelled if we also include the soft divergences that arise from figs. (2.3e) to (2.3f).
At first glance this seems very peculiar since these diagrams have different final states
and therefore should have no business contributing to this calculation. However, since
the gluon can be emitted with vanishingly small momentum it would be experimentally
impossible to detect and therefore the final states would look the same to an imperfect
observer.
It is the cancellation of these divergences that will be shown in detail in the next two
sections. Figs. (2.3a), (2.3b) and (2.3e) will be calculated in detail while the result for
the self energy expressions will be omitted since it can be cancelled by choosing to work
in the Landau gauge [44]. Since we expect both UV and IR divergences we choose to
work in the dimensional regularisation scheme detailed previously.
The Leading Order Process
If we let the pair-produced quarks have charge Qe then we have:
A0 = ieQu2(k2)v1(k1)r(p), (2.45)
where we have used the QED Feynman rule for a quark-antiquark-photon vertex:
iQe, the is are the spins of the quarks, r is the polarisation of the incoming photon
and p = k1 + k2 is the momentum carried by the incoming photon. Performing a sum
over all polarisations, spins and colours and integrating of the two particle phase space
in d = 4 2 dimensions gives:
0 = 3Q
(d 2)
, (2.46)
where we have neglected the quark mass terms since they are negligible in the High
Energy limit. It is important to note that in the limit   0 (i.e. d  4) the Born
cross-section remains finite.
2.7. Perturbative QCD and Resummation
The Virtual O(s) Corrections
The virtual correction graphs are shown in figs. (2.3b), (2.3c) and (2.3d). We will begin
by calculating the second term in eqn. (2.44). Using the Feynman rules we have:
(2)d
u2(k2)(igsT aij)
i(/k1 + /k)
(k1 + k)2
(ieQ) i(
/k2  /k)
(k2  k)2
(gsT aij)r(p)
g + (1 )
v1(k1).
Av = ig2seQ2 Tr(T aT a)u2(k2)
(2)d
N1(k1, k2, k)
k2(k1 + k)2(k2  k)2
v2(k2),
where the numerator of the fraction is given by:
N1(k1, k2, k) = (/k1 + /k)(/k2  /k)
g + (1 )k
. (2.48)
From eqn. (2.44) we see we need A0Av and upon calculating that we are left with the
cross-section contribution from the virtual diagrams in terms of the Born cross section:
(6 4E  4L) + E(3 E)
 8 + 
+ 2  L2  (2E  3)L
(2.49)
where L = ln
and E is Eulers constant. We can now see that the result for the
vertex correction is gauge independent as the  dependence has completely cancelled.
We also see that the parameter introduced to fix the coupling to be dimensionless, ,
appears in the final result; this is often the case when using dimensional regularisation
and the modified minimal subtraction renormalisation scheme.
The Real O(s) Corrections
The real gluon emission diagrams which contribute to the O(s) corrections are
figs. (2.3e) and (2.3f). These diagrams have an indistinguishable final state and so
the real contribution, Ar, will be of the form:
2.7. Perturbative QCD and Resummation
|Ar|2 = |Aleft +Aright|2 = |Aleft|2 + |Aright|2 + 2AleftAright, (2.50)
where Aleft and Aright refer to figs. (2.3e) and (2.3f) respectively and are given by:
Aleft = QeigsT aiju(k2)
/k1 + /k
(k1 + k)2
v(k1), (2.51a)
Aright = QeigsT aiju(k2)
/k2 + /k
(k2 + k)2
v(k1). (2.51b)
In the calculation of the terms of eqn. (2.44) it will be useful to write the energy
fractions for each particle as xi =
(where i = 1 is the external antiquark, i = 2
is the antiquark and i = 3 is the external gluon). In terms of these invariants the
contraction of any two external particles simplifies to pi  pj = 12s(1 xk) which (since
we are still assuming our quarks can be taken to be massless) gives a simple expression
for the Mandelstam variables. Evaluating the modulus squared terms gives:
|Aleft|2 =

Tr(T aT a) Tr(/k2

Summing these expressions and integrating over the three particle phase space yields:
(6 + 4E + 4L) E(3 E)
+ L2 + (2E  3)L
for the real diagram contribution to the cross section. As in the case of the virtual
corrections this is divergent in the limit   0 and exhibits a residual dependence on
Cancellation of divergences
Having now found the vertex corrections and the real corrections up to O(2) we
can write the next-to-leading order cross-section by simply summing eqns. (2.49)
2.7. Perturbative QCD and Resummation
and (2.7.2):
NLO = r + v =
0. (2.53)
So the total cross-section to next-to-leading order accuracy is:
 = 0
+O(2s). (2.54)
The fact that the infrared divergences in both the real and virtual emission NLO
diagrams cancel is an example of the KLN theorem [60] which states that the Standard
Model is completely free of infrared divergences at all orders.
2.7.3 Resumming Higher-Order Corrections
As we have seen we can evaluate the truncated perturbative series and, provided we
remember to include higher multiplicity diagrams which contribute in the soft limit,
we will be left with a finite result which is invariant under gauge transformations.
It would seem then that this is the best way to proceed: we calculate as many corrections
as we can and reason that all of the higher-order terms we have neglected are suppressed
by powers of a small expansion parameter - the strong coupling, s. If this is indeed
the case we should see that each time we go to a higher-order in perturbation theory
our series begins to converge. For example the effect of the NLO terms should be small
relative to the LO terms etc. It turns out that this is not true for all observables. To
motivate this we give a schematic expansion of some variable we wish to calculate, O:
O =s
2 + b1L+ c11
4 + b2L
3 + c2L
2 + d2L+ e21

where L is some logarithm which may be large. A fixed-order scheme aims to exactly
calculate as many of the rows of equation (2.55) as possible under the assumption that
all remaining terms are sufficiently suppressed to ignore. The problem with this picture
is that the logarithms may be large enough that the combination nsL
2n  O(1). In
2.7. Perturbative QCD and Resummation
this case it would appear that it would be better for us to calculate the first column of
the terms (called the leading logarithmic or LL approximation) than to find the first
row of terms (the LO approximation).
Fig. (2.4) shows how the ratio of the inclusive Higgs-plus-three jet cross-section to
inclusive Higgs-plus-two jet cross-section varies as a function of the rapidity gap between
the two leading jets in pT [15]. The HEJ prediction is formally leading logarithmic
accurate (with leading order matching for final states with up to three jets) while
MCFM [35] is formally next-to-leading order accurate. It is shown in chapter 3 that this
rapidity gap is approximately equal to the logarithm, L. Hence, as we move to large
y(j1, j2) we increase the size of L in eqn. (2.55) and the terms neglected by the fixed-
order scheme (but captured by a LL calculation) grow in size. The ratio of the inclusive
(n+ 1)-jet to n-jet cross-sections is an interesting probe of the convergence of the QCD
perturbative expansion since we are directly comparing the size of the higher order
contributions to the LO terms. Fig. (2.4a) shows that at a centre-of-mass energy of 14
TeV (the energy scales close to be being achieved at the LHC) even at modest rapidity
intervals of around 4.0 we see that half of all events contain extra radiation and when
we pull the leading jets apart further in rapidity this increases to three quarters of all
events.
Furthermore, figs. (2.4b) and (2.4c) show that as we increase the centre-of-mass energy
to that of a potential hadronic future circular collider, 33 TeV and 100 TeV respectively,
these enhanced higher-order terms become even more important - in the case of dijets
with a separation of y(j1, j2)  8.0 at a 100 TeV collider almost 90% of the cross-
section is coming from the next-to-leading term in the perturbative series: this is clear
evidence that is not generally sufficient to think of the expansion as being controlled
by only the strong coupling constant, s.
We can also test this against existing data; fig. (2.5) show the probability of extra
jet activity in inclusive W-plus-dijets as a function of the rapidity gap between the
two leading jets in rapidity, y(jF , jB), taken from a very detailed study by the D
collaboration [7] at the Tevatron experiment. This is similar to the ratio of the inclusive
3j and inclusive 2j cross-sections described in fig. (2.4). We observe the same behaviour
that as we pull apart the dijets we see a marked rise in the probability of extra emissions
but, more importantly, we see that the data show this strongly increasing trend too.
The remaining chapters of this thesis will focus on deriving a formalism for calculating
these higher-order corrections in order to describe Z/ events at high energy hadronic
colliders. However, we must first derive some technical methods for performing
calculations.

The probability of emission of a third jet in inclusive
W + dijet events is strongly correlated with the mean
number of jets in the event presented in Figs. 21 and 22.
However, with the probability observable, we specifically
focus on the emission of a single additional jet beyond
the two used to define the dijet rapidity interval.

The probability of third jet emission as a function of
the rapidity span between the two leading jets is approx-
imately 15% and is shown in Fig. 23 in comparison to
a variety of theoretical predictions. Both parton shower
and matrix-element plus parton shower matched MC pro-
grams underpredict the overall emission rate, particularly
at large rapidity separations where these programs pre-
dict a drop in jet emission not supported by the data.
Unlike the MC predictions that underestimate the high-
pT radiation at large rapidity separations, hej and NLO
blackhat+sherpa approaches are able to model the
constant jet emission dependence well.
As a function of the most rapidity-separated jets, a
significant variation in third jet emission probability is
observed in the data. At the smallest rapidity separa-
tions, emission probabilities are  0%, but at the largest
rapidity spans, half of all inclusive W + dijet events are
found to have a third high-pT jet present. This measure-
ment is shown in comparison to a variety of theoretical
models in Fig. 24.

The exact correlation of jet emission probability with
rapidity interval is dependent on the interplay between
two effects: the increasing phase space for high-pT emis-
sion between jets versus the probability to actually emit
into that rapidity interval (which decreases at large ra-
pidity separations due to steeply falling PDFs as Bjorken
x  1). There is some evidence that as we approach the
largest separations studied, PDF suppression may be be-
ginning to dominate over the increased phase space (in
both the highest-pT jet and most rapidity-separated jet
configurations). Proper modeling of W + n-jet behav-
ior, particularly in the most rapidity-separated jet case,
will be important for understanding central jet vetoes in
future VBF Higgs studies.

2.8. Spinor-Helicity Notation
2.8 Spinor-Helicity Notation
We now move towards the more mechanical aspects of this thesis to discuss a technique
which eases calculations. In chapters 3 and 4 we choose to work in the spinor-helicity
formalism [41, 43]. This is a very convenient choice of notation which allows us to
quickly evaluate complicated strings of products of Dirac spinors and Dirac matrices
which would otherwise be troublesome to work with.
We begin by looking at the case of massless particles; this is relevant for high energy
QCD since gluons are massless and the quark masses are negligible compared to the
energy scale in a typical scattering process. The massless Dirac equation can be solved
by using a plane-wave expansion with some momentum dependent coefficient functions,
u(p) and v(p) where p is the momentum carried by the particle and must satisfy the
on-shell condition p2 = 0. This expansion gives the following equations:
(/p+m)u(p) = 0,
(/pm)v(p) = 0.
(2.56)
Each of these equations has two independent solutions which we identify as the helicity
states, u(p) and v(p). We use the following notation for these spinors:
u(p) =| p, u(p) = p | . (2.57)
In the massless limit we also have the following relation u(p) = v(p) which allows us
to use the same notation for both quarks and anti-quarks. Often the helicity information
will be suppressed in the interests of being concise. We also define the following spinor-
brackets:
pk = p | k+, [pk] = p+ | k. (2.58)
In this language we have the following useful identities:
2.8. Spinor-Helicity Notation
ij[ij] = sij i |  | i = 2ki
ij = ji [ij] = [ji]
i |  | jk |  | l = 2[ik]lj k |  | l = l |  | k
ijkl = iklj+ ilkj [ij][kl] = [ik][jl] + [il][kj]
i+ |/k|j+ = [ik]kj i |/k|j = ik[kj]
In the calculations here we use the following convention for spinors. We express the
parton momenta in terms of light-cone coordinates where p = Epz and p = px+ipy.
For outgoing positive (negative) helicity partons, u+(p) (u(p)) we have:
u+(p) =

p p|p|

u(p) =


(2.59)
respectively. While for incoming positive (negative) helicity partons moving in the
positive z direction, u+(p) (u(p)) we have:
u+(p) =


u(p) =


(2.60)
respectively. Lastly for incoming positive (negative) helicity partons moving in the
negative z direction, u+(p) (u(p)) we have:
u+(p) =


u(p) =


. (2.61)
We also use following form for the Dirac matrices:

2.8.1 Spinor-Helicity Calculations with Massive Partons
To do calculations with massive partons using the spinor-helicity formalism we must be
very careful since all of our favourite identities and tricks rely on the spinor brackets,
|i, representing massless partons with p2i = 0. We begin by defining fundamental
spinors [29] which we can use to build more general spinors and go from there. For
some k0, k1 satisfying k
0 = 0, k
1 = 1 and k0  k1 = 0 we can define positive and
negative helicity spinors as follows:
u(k0)u(k0)  /k0 (2.64a)
u+(k0)  /k1u(k0), (2.64b)
where  =
(1+5) is the helicity projection operator. In order for these to be valid
spinors they must satisfy the following completeness relations:
u(p)u(p) = /p+m (2.65a)
u(p)u(p) = /p (2.65b)
2.8. Spinor-Helicity Notation
The spinors in eqn. (2.64) can easily be shown to satisfy these as follows:
u(k0)u(k0) + u+(k0)u+(k0) = /k0 + /k1u(k0)u(k0)/k1,
= /k0 + /k1/k0/k1,
= /k0 +
k1(1 5)k0k1,
= /k0 +
k1k0k1(
  5),
= /k0 +
k1k0k1(2
  + 25g  5),
= /k0 + k1k0k1+
(2g  ),
= /k0 + 2/k1k0  k1  +/k1/k1/k0,
= /k0 + +/k0,
where we have used ,  = 2g , , 5 = 0 and /k1/k1 = k
1 = 0. This proves the
property of eqn. (2.65a) and inserting the definition of  gives:
u(k0)u(k0) + u+(k0)u+(k0) =
(1 5)/k0 + (1 + 5)/k0,
= /k0,
which is eqn. (2.65b) for a massless particle.
We can use these fundamental spinors to form spinors for any given momenta, p (which
has p2 = 0), as follows:
u(p) = /pu(k0)
2p  k0
, (2.68)
provided we dont have p k0 = 0. Once again it is easy to show that this spinor satisfies
2.8. Spinor-Helicity Notation
the necessary conditions, for example:
u(p)u(p) =
2p  k0
/pu(k0)u(p)/p,
2p  k0
/p/k0/p,
4p  k0
/p(1 5)/k0/p,
2p  k0
pk0p
(2g  ),
2p  k0
(2/pp  k0  /p/p/k)),
= /p.
So far so good. This can also be generalised so that we can build massive spinors from
our fundamental ones. We can use
u(q, s) =
2q  k
(/q +m)u(k) (2.70)
to describe a quark with spin 4-vector s, mass m and momentum q. To confirm this
we go through the same procedure as above:
u(p, s)u(p, s) =
2q  k0
(/q +m)u(k0)u(q)(/q +m),
2q  k0
(/q +m)/k0(/q +m),
4q  k0
(/q +m)(1 5)/k0(/q +m),
4q  k0
/q/k0/q +m/k/q +m/q/k0 +m

(/q +m),
1 + /s5
(/q +m),
2.8. Spinor-Helicity Notation
where the last line defines the spin vector s = 1
q  m
qkk. Conjecturing a similar form
for an antiquark spinor with spin 4-vector s, mass m and momentum q:
v(q, s) =
2q  k
(/q m)u(k) (2.72)
leads to:
v(p, s)v(p, s) =
2q  k0
(/q m)u(k0)u(q)(/q m),
/q m
/q +m+
q  k0
/k0 
q  k0
/q/k0
1 + /s5
(/q m).
One last check that is worth performing is that these spinors actually satisfy the Dirac
equation for both the quark and antiquark case. For the quark:
/qu(q, s) =
2q  k0
/q(/q +m)u(k0),
2q  k0
(m2 +m/q)u(k0).
We now define some momentum q through the relation q = q+k0 such that q
2 = 0 and
q  k0 = q  k0. Since q2 = 2q  k0 = m2 we may write
/qu(q, s) =
(m2 +m/q)u(k0),
= (m+ /q)u(k0).
2.8. Spinor-Helicity Notation
We can now back substitute from the definition of u(q, s) in eq. (2.70) to get:
/qu(q, s) =
2q  ku(q, s),
= mu(q, s),
which is the Dirac equation for a quark. The result for antiquarks follows similarly.
Now we have forms for massive quarks and antiquarks in terms of massless spinors we
can use all of the spinor-helicity machinery to make our computations more efficient.
Slightly more useful forms of equations (2.70) and (2.72) can be found by decomposing
q into massless components once again: q = q + k. Then from eq. (2.70):
u(q, s) =
(/q + /k +m)u(k),
|q+q+|k+ |qq|k+ |kk|k+ |kk|k+m|k
[qk]
|q++ |k,
and similarly for the other helicities and the antiquarks:
u(q,s) = qk
|q+ |k+, (2.78a)
v(q, s) =
[qk]
|q+  |k, (2.78b)
v(q,s) = qk
|q  |k+. (2.78c)
We can now construct spinors for states with the on-shell condition p2 = m2 for non-
zero mass, m. By performing a Lorentz boost such that we are in the comoving frame
we can write the momenta, p, of parton (denoted p in this new frame) as:
p = (x, y, z)p
 = (m, 0, 0, 0) , (2.79)
where ~ are the parameters of the Lorentz boost. In this frame it is trivial to decompose
the momenta in to two null momenta
2.9. Monte Carlo Techniques
p2 =
p+ + p
where p+ = (m,m, 0, 0) and p = (m,m, 0, 0). Then in order to find the basis vectors
back in the original frame we simply boost by ~:
p2 =
(x,y,z)p
(x,y,z)p
 k1 + k2.
2.9 Monte Carlo Techniques
2.9.1 One Dimensional Integration
Integrals are ubiquitous in every field of physics and particle physics is no different.
We have already seen many examples where meaningful physical results can only
be obtained after computing an integral, including: the convolution of the parton
distribution functions with the partonic cross-section seen in section 2.5 and the more
complex multi-dimensional integrals seen in section 2.7.2 for the calculation of the
one-loop correction to quark-antiquark production.
For some of the integrals derived here it is not always feasible (and sometimes not even
possible) to calculate them analytically. In these situations we must use a numerical
approach to approximate the exact result. Such approaches generally fall into one
of two categories; quadrature or Monte Carlo random sampling approaches. The
most appropriate solution depends on the integrand itself, and in particular our prior
knowledge of the integrand, and the number of dimensions we are integrating over.
We begin by considering the one-dimensional case. Given an integral:
f(x)dx, (2.81)
we can use well known results such as the Compound Simpsons Rule to approximate
the integral by
I  h
(f(x2i2) + 4f(x2i1) + f(x2i)) +O(N4), (2.82)
2.9. Monte Carlo Techniques
where N is the number of subdivisions of the integral domain (a, b) and xi = a+
i(ba)
are the points at which we sample the integrand. The error quoted on eqn. (2.82)
only shows the dependence on the sampling rate and it should be noted that there are
other factors arising from the size of the domain of integration and on derivatives of
the integrand, f(x). The O(N4) scaling of the error in this method makes it a good
choice for numerics in one-dimension.
The Monte-Carlo approach to approximating eqn. (2.81) would be to pseudo-randomly
select a series of N points, xi, from within the domain of integration and then compute
the integral as follows:
I  IMC =
f(xi) +O(N
2 ). (2.83)
Convergence of this result is assured by the weak law of large numbers (also known
as Bernoullis Theorem) which states that for a series of independent and identically
distributed random variables, {X1, . . . , XN}, each with E(Xi) =  the sample mean
approaches the population mean as N . That is,
X1 +   +XN
= . (2.84)
We can see this explicitly since the expectation of IMC under the continuous probability
density function p is:
Ep[IMC ] = Ep
f(xi)
Ep [f(xi)]
f(x)p(x)dx
2.9. Monte Carlo Techniques
where p(x) = 1
ba is the uniform probability distribution for x  (a, b). Hence,
Ep[IMC ] =
f(x)dx
f(x)dx = I.
Since the convergence of the Monte-Carlo approximation clearly scales significantly
worse than the case for the quadrature approach it would seem that it is not worth
considering and, indeed, for a single dimension it is not. However, the picture changes
when we consider integrals in dimension d  2.
2.9.2 Higher Dimensional Integration
In the case of higher dimensional integrals e.g.
[a,b]
f(~x)d~x =
 x1=b1
x1=a1
  
 xn=bn
xn=an
f(x1, . . . , xn)dx1 . . . dxn, (2.85)
we can still look to generalisations of the quadrature methods touched on in the section
above however the convergence of these methods is now less favourable. Quadrature
methods have errors which scale with the number of dimensions we are integrating over,
e.g. O(N 4d ) for the Compound Simpsons Rule. We can argue this intuitively since
if we have N points in one dimension to get an error which scales as O(N4) then
in two dimensions we would require N2 to achieve the same density of samplings and
hence N2  O(N4) N2  O(N 42 ) and more generally O(N 4d ) for d dimensional
integrals.
By comparison the error of a Monte Carlo approximation stays fixed at O(N 12 )
regardless of the number of dimensions in the integrals. We are spared from this so-
called curse of dimensionality by the Central Limit Theorem which states that for a
sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables X1, . . . , XN each
with variance 2 we have:
X1 +   +XN NE(X1)
limN N (0, 1), (2.86)
where N (0, 1) is the normal distribution with mean zero and variance 1. Using the
additive and multiplicative scaling of the normal distribution we get the more intuitive
2.9. Monte Carlo Techniques
result:
limN N
, (2.87)
where  is the mean of the variables Xi. The variance of a normal distribution is well
known and we can use this to see that for a d-dimensional integral we can approximate
our uncertainty as:
[a,b]
f(~x)d~x = V f  V
f2  f2
(2.88)
 V f  V MC
, (2.89)
where V is the volume of the domain of integration, f =
i f(xi) and f2 =
i f(xi)
2.9.3 Variation Reduction Techniques
In eqn. (2.89) we saw that the error estimate of a Monte Carlo approximation depends
not only on the number of points sampled, N , but also on MC . We can try to reduce
MC by reducing how variable the integrand is over the domain of integration, for
instance in the trivial example where our integrand is f(x) = f0, a constant, it is clear
that one Monte Carlo sample is sufficient to compute the integral exactly. Previously
when computing Ep[IMC ] we used a uniform probability density function but in fact
we are free to use any distribution we like to perform the integration. This can be seen
through the change of variables:
Ep[IMC ] =
f(x)p(x)dx,
f(x)p(x)q(x)
IMCp(x)
where q(x) is our importance sampling distribution. For example let us consider the
integral

The integrand of eqn. (2.90) is shown in fig. (2.6) along with two potential choices
of importance sampling density functions. The uniform distribution (in red) will
sample the integrand equally across the domain however it is clear from looking at
the functional form of eqn. (2.90) and fig. (2.6) that it isnt the most efficient approach
since it is strongly peaked towards the right hand side of the domain. Hence that
is where the largest contribution to the Monte Carlo sum will come from. However
if we sample the modified integrand using pseudo-random numbers generated from a
distribution proportional to x4 (shown in green in fig. (2.6)) we can reduce the variance
of our approximation significantly. Tab. (2.2) shows how the approximation improves
as we vary the number of samples, N , for the two cases of q  U(0, 0.5) and q  x4.

case.
Tab. (2.2) clearly shows the value of an importance sampling approach; this result
converges to the correct result much faster than when we sample uniformly. Of course
this tactic relies on us having some prior knowledge of the behaviour of our integrand in
order to select the correct probability density function to use which, in more complicated
examples is not always possible3. A more realistic, and relevant, example of importance
sampling comes from the cross-section for the production of a Z0 boson in association
with dijets. The matrix element squared for such a process will have following form:
|MZ0+jj |2 
p2Z MZ + iZMZ
 f(QCD, EW) g(Kinematic), (2.91)
3More novel approaches whereby the sampling distribution is modified to improve convergence as
the Monte-Carlo iterations are calculated, such as the VEGAS algorithm, exist but they will not be
discussed here.

for comparison, the uniform probability density function used in the nave case of no
importance sampling is also shown (in red).
where pZ is the momentum carried by the Z
0 boson, MZ is its mass, Z is its width,
f(QCD, EW) will contain all of the coupling information and g(Kinematic) encodes
the remainder of the matrix element. When using a Monte-Carlo approach to generate
events of this kind we can use the schematic form of eqn. (2.91) to a priori select an
appropriate probability density function to sample from. Fig. (2.7) shows the squared
Z0 propagator. Obvious comparisons with fig. (2.6) can be drawn in the sense that
were we to generate events with a uniform spread of values for p2Z we would end with a
very slow rate of convergence by oversampling areas where the integrand is very small
and slowly varying.
Another good example of importance sampling is found in how we sample the incoming
partons in our simulations. Simple momentum conservation considerations lead us to
values for the Bjorken scaling variables of our incoming partons, xa and xb, and we can
use these to intelligently sample the available partons. The nave way to perform the

sum over all possible incoming states would be to uniformly choose a random number
corresponding to one of the light quarks, one the light anti-quarks or to a gluon4. We
can, however, do better than this by using what we know about how the parton density
functions vary with xa/b - fig. (2.8) shows this behaviour as measured by the HERA
experiment. By choosing to randomly sample then incoming parton types according
to the relative values for the parton density functions we can, once again, reduce the
variance of our numerical integrations as much as possible. In chapter 4 we will see
an example of the effect of picking an importance sampling distribution which is not
relevant for the problem at hand - in this case it was necessary to change the way we
sampled a Breit-Wigner because of specific experimental invariant mass cuts applied
to the decay products of a Z/ boson.
4Here we mean all except the top and anti-top. The parton density functions for these are not
available and, even if they were, they would be small enough that we could safely ignore their
contribution to cross-sections.

Chapter 3
High Energy QCD
In this chapter we look in detail at the High Energy limit of QCD. We begin by defining
this limit and looking at how basic 2 2 scattering behaves at leading order and next-
to-leading order in s before discussing how, in this limit, scattering amplitudes may
be conveniently expressed as a contraction between two vector current terms. Finally,
we show how we may adorn 2 2 matrix elements with real and virtual corrections by
way of an effective vertex for real emissions and the Lipatov ansatz respectively. In this
way we construct an approximate description of 2  n scattering in the high energy
limit.
3.1 The High Energy limit
The High Energy limit of QCD, also referred to as the Multi-Regge Kinematic (MRK)
limit is defined in terms of the kinematics of the final state. We require a strong rapidity
ordering of all outgoing radiation as well as all the emissions having similar transverse
momenta. Mathematically:
y1  y2      yn and |p1|  |p2|      |p(n1)|, (3.1)
where we define the rapidity of a final state particle as
E + pz
E  pz
(3.2)
where E is the energy of particle and pz is the z component of its momentum. We can
3.2. Mandelstam Variables in the High Energy Limit
state the criteria in eqn. (3.1) equivalently as:
sij  for all i, j with |pi| fixed, (3.3)
where sij = (pi+pj)
2 is the invariant mass of a pair of outgoing partons. We sometimes
parametrise the final states instead using pseudo-rapidity, , rather than rapidity.
Pseudo-rapidity is simply related to the angle of the outgoing state to the beam, :
 =  ln tan 
. (3.4)
For massless states eqn. (3.2) and eqn. (3.4) are equivalent.
3.2 Mandelstam Variables in the High Energy Limit
The 2  2 QCD scattering amplitudes can be expressed in terms of the well-known
Mandestam variables s, t and u, which, in terms of the momenta in the process, are
given by:
s = (pa + pb)
t = (pa  pb)2,
u = (pb  p2)2,
(3.5)
where pa, pb are the incoming parton momenta and p1, p2 are the outgoing parton
momenta. When working in the high energy limit it is convenient to re-express these in
terms of the perpendicular momentum of the outgoing partons, p, and the difference
in rapidity between the two final state partons, y. If we parametrise our outgoing
states as
p1 = p1
cosh(y1), cos(1), sin(1), sinh(y1)
p2 = p2
cosh(y2), cos(2), sin(2), sinh(y2)
(3.6)
then we can express eqs. (3.5) as follows:
3.3. qQ-scattering at High Energy (at LO)
s = 4p2 cosh
t = 2p2 cosh
u = 2p2 cosh
(3.7)
In the limit of hard jets well separated in rapidity, i.e. y , these are approximated
s = p2e
t = p2,
u = p2ey.
(3.8)
From eqn. (3.8) it is clear that the hard, wide-angle jet limit, i.e. y , pi ,
is equivalent to the High Energy limit since as y grows large s will grow exponentially
large while t will stay fixed. Rearranging for y in the above equations yields:
y = ln
. (3.9)
This is a useful result because it directly relates the kinematics of an event to a
(potentially) large logarithm. It is already apparent from eqn. (3.9) that a final state
with large rapidity gaps between jets will carry with it a large logarithm as seen in
eqn. (2.55), L = ln
, and therefore we may need a more careful inspection of our
perturbative expansion than the fixed-order approach.
3.3 qQ-scattering at High Energy (at LO)
Here we consider the simplest example; the case of qQ  qQ for all negative helicity
partons (the capital Q implies it is a different flavour to q). There is only one diagram
which contributes shown in fig. (3.1). Using the Feynman rules detailed in section 2.2
we can write the matrix element as:
3.3. qQ-scattering at High Energy (at LO)

, (3.11)
where t = (pa  p1)2. Writing the contraction of these two current terms in terms of
light-cone coordinates we have:
iMLOqQqQ = ig
pa p
p+1 p
i2 +
p1 p
, (3.12)
where eii =
|pi| . We now approximate the kinematics in such a way that we may
write eqn. (3.12) in a factorised form once again. Specifically we consider that the
scattering can be thought of as two incoming partons glancing off one another. That
is, we assume that p+1  p
1 , p
2  p
2 with pa (pb) moving in the backwards (forward)
direction. We can further assume that p1  pa and p
2  p
b and with this we see
that (3.12) becomes:
iMLOqQqQ =
igsT d2b
, (3.13)
which is factorised in the sense that each scalar term in brackets depends only on
one quark line; either on the pa/1 line or the pb/2 line. We see that the amplitude for
qQ qQ is dominated by the s kinematic variable. We can express this as:
MLOqQqQ  s
(t), (3.14)
3.4. qg scattering at High Energy
This is exactly the behaviour expected when a particle exchanged in the t-channel has
reggeised [24,40,74]. (t) is the Regge trajectory and is equal to the intrinsic spin of
the state exchanged. In our example we have a gluon exchanged and accordingly we
can see from eqn. (3.13) that (t) = 1 for qQ qQ at leading order.
It is also interesting to consider the same process but with helicity structure qQ+ 
qQ+. The calculation proceeds similarly to the qQ  qQ and when we write
the result in terms of two vector currents we get:
iMLOqQ+qQ+ = ig
1||a  b||2
, (3.15)
which is still manifestly expressible as a contraction of two vector currents. The
contraction can be written approximately as 2[a2]b1  2[a2]2a = 2u. However
when we continue on and take the High Energy limit of eqn. (3.15) we get:
iMLOqQ+qQ+ = ig
pa p
p+b p
= ig2sT
(3.16)
So we see that in the strict High Energy limit we have that s = u exactly. Whereas
when we leave the amplitude in terms of vector currents we are able to keep more of
the physics by keeping s  u; at the LHC t and k2 can often differ significantly and
so the over-approximating the kinematics here would lead to a poor description of the
data.
3.4 qg scattering at High Energy
We now explore the more involved case of qg+  qg+ scattering. At leading order
this consists of the three diagrams shown in fig. (3.2). We use the following gauge
choice for the gluon polarisations:
+2 =
b||2
2b2
2 = 
b||2
2[b2]
(3.17)
+b = 
b||2

2 =

(3.18)
3.4. qg scattering at High Energy
For simplicity we choose to write everything in terms of negative helicity spinor-helicity
brackets; to describe positive helicities we can use the transposition property of spinor-
helicity brackets discussed in section 2.8.
Figure 3.2: The s, t and u channel diagrams contributing to qg+  qg+ at leading
order in s in figs. (3.2a), (3.2b) and (3.2c) respectively.

where we have neglected the quark mass term since we are in the High Energy limit.
The propagator has momentum q = pa + pb = p1 + p2 and therefore:

MLOqg+qg+,s = T

We use the completeness relations for /pa/b and see that:

Using q2 = sab = ab[ba] and t = 2b[b2] we have:
MLOqg+qg+,s = T
[2a]ab
ab[ba]2b[b2]b||21||a. (3.23)
We must now calculate explicitly the spinor product brackets using the conventions for
spinors outlined in the previous chapter, for example:
[2a] =u+2 u
a = 
p+a p
|p2 |
. (3.24)
After calculating the other brackets in eqn. (3.23) we see:
MLOqg+qg+,s = T
p+2 p
|p2|
b||21||a (3.25)
Which can be simplified to give the final result:
MLOqg+qg+,s = T

b||21||a (3.26)

3.4.2 t-channel
The matrix element for the t-channel diagram, shown in fig. (3.2b), is:
iMLOqg+qg+,t = T

 igs
 ig
ua gs
g(pb  q) + g(q + pb)  g(pb + p2))

2gpb + 2gp2  g(pb + p2)
(3.28)
which cancels completely and therefore:
MLOqg+qg+,t = 0, (3.29)
in this gauge.
3.4.3 u-channel
The matrix element for the u-diagram, shown in fig. (3.2c), is:
iMLOqg+qg+,u = T
(p1)
 igs
i(/q +mc)

(/pa  /p2)
(3.30)
Where we have used q = pa  p2. By direct comparison with the procedure used for
the s-channel we can see the result will be:
3.5. qQ-scattering at High Energy (at NLO)
MLOqg+qg+,u = T
|p2|
b||21||a. (3.31)
The total total matrix element is given by the sum of eqs. (3.26), (3.29) and (3.31)
which is:
MLOqg+qg+ =
|p2|
T 2aeT
 T baeT 2e1
b||21||a
, (3.32)
We also see that eqn. (3.32) has the same spinor-helicity brackets contracted as
eqn. (3.11) and so the dominant behaviour of qg+  qg+ in the high energy limit
as predicted by Regge theory. In the High Energy limit we have pb  p
2 and so
eqn. (3.32) could be simplified further to:
MLOqg+qg+ = i
|p2|
f2bcT ca1
b||21||a
. (3.33)
which is identical to the result found in the previous qQ  qQ calculation (save for a
phase which cancels at the amplitude squared level and a different colour factor). The
kinematics of eqn. (3.32) are exactly in the form of two currents contracted as seen in
section 3.3. We have:
|MLOqgqg|2 =
|MLOqQqQ|2, (3.34)
in the High Energy limit. In practice we actually choose not to take the High Energy
limit to obtain eqn. (3.33) so as to approximate as little as possible. Even without this
extra approximation eqn. (3.32) is still exactly the form of a t-channel gluon exchange
as seen in eqn. (3.11).
In section 3.9 we will return to this result and the results of section 3.3 and discuss how,
despite their simplicity, they act as a basis and can be used to construct very general
approximate forms for matrix elements which could now otherwise be evaluated
3.5 qQ-scattering at High Energy (at NLO)
Before we continue on to look at how we might add extra real emissions to high energy
matrix elements we briefly look at higher order (in s) corrections to the process we
3.5. qQ-scattering at High Energy (at NLO)
studied in section 3.3. So far we have seen the leading order processes with a t-channel
exchange are enhanced but in eqn. (2.55) we sketched out a form for the perturbative
expansion which also had enhanced contributions at higher order.
Here we continue on from section 3.3 and calculate the virtual diagrams which
contribute a leading logarithm for qQ qQ at next-to-leading in s [40, 74].
We might expect that the next-to-leading order diagrams with the maximal number
of t-channel exchanges will give the greatest enhancement and, indeed, this turns out
to be the case. These diagrams are shown for the case of qQ  qQ in fig. (3.3). We
can rule out the other virtual diagrams which contribute at this order since they will
contain (anti-)quark propagators along the pa/1 or pb/2 lines and in the high energy
limit these will be suppressed.
The diagrams in fig. (3.3) can be elegantly computed by using the Cutkosky rules
which are used to relate two sub-diagrams to the imaginary part of a higher order
diagram through the Optical theorem. This can be seen very quickly since the scattering
matrix, S, must be unitary i.e. SS = 1. If we write this instead in terms of the
transition matrix, T , defined by S = 1 + iT then we immediately have that
 i(T  T ) = T T. (3.35)
The left hand side of which can be written as twice the imaginary part of T . If we now
let T represent the transition from some initial state |i to some final state |f then we
can write this as:
2iIm(i|T |f) =
i|T |pp|T |f, (3.36)
where we have inserted a sum over a complete set of states |p. Pictorially we cut
propagators by forcing them on-shell with delta functions and inserting a complete set
of states.
For example the uncrossed amplitude in fig. (3.3a), MNLO, IIqQqQ, may be expressed as a
combination of two copies of the amplitude arising from fig. (3.1):
MLOqQqQ = g
1||a  2||b
, (3.37)
as follows:

where Im() denotes the imaginary part, k is the loop momentum, q is the momentum
transfer and  denotes Hermitian conjugation. The sum over a complete of states here
corresponds to integrating over all possible momenta flowing around the loop. In the
High Energy limit we can perform the integration to give:
MNLO, IIqQqQ
= 42ss C1(T a, T b)
k(k  q)
, (3.40)
where C1(T a, T b) is the colour factor for the diagram in fig. (3.3a) and k is the
transverse component of k. We can now relate the imaginary part of the amplitude to
the full amplitude by conjecturing that the amplitude will be logarithmically enhanced
as follows:
MNLO, IIqQqQ =Re(M
NLO, II
qQqQ) + iIm(M
NLO, II

and defining MNLO, IIqQqQ as the leading logarithmic coefficient of the matrix element:

where we have used that s

and assuming that MNLO, IIqQqQ is real we see that:
MNLO, IIqQqQ
=  1
MNLO, IIqQqQ
 (3.43)
and we can therefore reconstruct the real part of the amplitude as:
MNLO, IIqQqQ
= 4
C1(T a, T b) ln
k(k  q)
. (3.44)
The crossed-diagram, (3.3b), also contributes a leading logarithmic piece and is related
to eqn. (3.3a) by a crossing symmetry and so we simply replace s with u in eqn. (3.44)
and calculate a new colour factor, C2(T a, T b):
MNLO, XqQqQ
= 4
C2(T a, T b) ln
k(k  q)
. (3.45)
But in the high energy limit s  u (this is clear from eqn. (3.8)) and so we can
combine these terms and express the leading logarithmic part of the NLO correction in
terms of the leading order result:
MNLOqQqQ =
(q) ln
MLOqQqQ, (3.46)
where:
(q) =
k(k  q)
. (3.47)
From eqn. (3.46) we can see the logarithmic enhancement explicitly; there is still a
suppression from the inclusion of an extra factor of s with respect to the leading order
term but as we have seen previously the logarithm is related to the kinematics of the
final state - namely - the rapidity gap between the outgoing quarks p1 and p2 and this
can be large enough to compensate for the smallness of s. Eqn. (3.47) will clearly
3.6. t-channel Dominance
diverge when we come to integrate over the soft region (where k is very small). This
divergence will be treated, i.e. regularised and explicitly shown to cancel, in chapter 4.
3.6 t-channel Dominance
In what follows we construct high multiplicity matrix elements by approximating
the full result by the contraction of two currents and a number of effective vertices.
This choice allows us to construct all the matrix elements which contain the leading
logarithms.
As a simple example we consider the production of 4 exclusive jets in the High Energy
limit. We present a brief argument for precisely which diagrams contribute these leading
logarithms. Although heuristic it is sufficient to motivate the construction of high
multiplicity amplitudes from t-channel gluon exchanges with the understanding that
any other diagrams will be formally sub-leading. Fig. (3.4) shows three diagrams which
all contribute at leading order in s; fig. (3.4a) has three gluons exchanged in the t-
channel and so its amplitude will have propagator terms which goes like:
M(a) 
(pa  p1)2(pa  p1  p2)2(pa  p1  p2  p3)2
, (3.48)
By contrast figs. (3.4b) and (3.4c) will have, in place of (3.48):
M(b) 
/pa  /p1
(pa  p1)2(pa  p1  p2)2(pa  p1  p2  p3)2
, (3.49)
M(c) 
(/pa  /p1)(/p4  /pb)
(pa  p1)2(pa  p1  p2)2(pa  p1  p2  p3)2
, (3.50)
respectively. Since in the High Energy limit we have pa  p1 and pb  p4 it is clear that
M(b) and M(c) will be suppressed with respect to M(a). We call the configurations
with a maximal number of gluons exchanged in the t-channels an FKL configuration;
For example fig. (3.4a) is an FKL configuration while fig. (3.4b) and fig. (3.4c) are
non-FKL configurations.
A formal argument for which processes dominate in this limit was given by Fadin and
Lipatov [25, 62]. They found that, in the High Energy limit, scattering amplitudes
3.6. t-channel Dominance
Figure 3.4: Three processes contributing to exclusive four jet production. (a) has the
maximum number of gluons exchanged in the t-channels (three) and will dominate in
the High Energy limit, (b) and (c) only have two and one gluon which can reggeise. As
such as we move from (a) to (c) we will lose powers of large logarithms but maintain the
same power of s and therefore we can reasonably approximate quad-jet production by
neglecting (b) and (c) in the High Energy limit.
scaled in the same way as was predicted by Regge theory. This states that in the large
invariant mass region a 2 n matrix element has a limiting behaviour determined by
the maximum spin of any particle which could be exchanged in the t-channels between
final state partons neighbouring in rapidity. We can then find the scaling of a process,
for example qg  qg, in particular regions of phase space where either yg  yq or
yq  yg simply by drawing the associated colour connection diagrams for it. This is
shown in fig. (3.5). Since when we have yg  yq it is only possible to exchange a colour
singlet (with spin one half) the cross-section will be dominated by the region where
yq  yg. The case for 2  n is similar with the limiting behaviour of the matrix
element given by
MHE2n  s112    s
(n1)
(n1)n. (3.51)
Eqn. (3.51) now makes the previous discussion regarding figs. (3.4) formally clear since
fig. (3.4a) will scale like:
MHE24  s12s23s34, (3.52)
in the High Energy limit while figs. (3.4b) and (3.4c) will scale like:
MHE24  s
12 s23s34, (3.53)
3.6. t-channel Dominance
MHE24  s
12 s23s
34 , (3.54)
respectively. Since sij are all large here, the processes with a (anti)quark exchanged in
the t-channel will be highly suppressed relative to fig. (3.4a).
To further illustrate this we can look at the various processes contributing to the
exclusive two jet cross-section. Tab. (3.1) shows several examples of parton level
processes and their exact leading order matrix elements [68]. We can see clearly
from this that any process which can proceed via a t-channel gluon exchange has a
term proportional to s2/t2 which will dominate in the High Energy limit; for example
qQ  qQ can only go via a t-channel diagram. Conversely, processes in which a t-
channel gluon diagram can not contribute are suppressed in this limit. For example
qq  QQ can only proceed via an s-channel gluon and we can see that in the limit
s   and keeping t finite its matrix element tends to 4/9u2
which is O(1) in the
High Energy limit (since s  u here). Processes like gg  gg have diagrams with and
without the exchange we are interested in and, as such, only some of the terms from
the exact leading order matrix element contribute - but they do still contribute.
yg  yq
|M| / s1/2
yq  yg
|M| / s1
Figure 1: The two lines above illustrate the two possible rapidity orders for the process qg  qg.
In the first case, where the rapidity of the gluon is greater than the quark, the allowed colour
connection is a singlet corresponding to a quark exchange in the t-channel. This leads to a
contribution to the amplitude which scales as s1/2. In the second case, the allowed colour
connection is an octet which corresponds to a gluon exchange in the t-channel and a scaling of
s1. The latter will clearly be the dominant configuration in the limit of large s.
We have thus identified the flavour-assignments of partons which will yield the dominant con-
tribution in the limit of large invariant mass between the jets, for any given configuration of
the transverse momenta: the dominant contribution is obtained in the flavour configurations
which allow for colour-octet (gluon) exchanges between all neighbouring particles. We call these
FKL configurations. Within High Energy Jets we concentrate on describing to all orders in the
strong coupling these scattering amplitudes, which contribute to the leading power behaviour of
the cross section.
These scaling arguments are unaffected by the additional emission of an electroweak boson and
specifically here we discuss the description with an additional Z boson or virtual photon. The
emission of an electroweak boson is viewed merely as an electroweak correction to the underlying
QCD dijet production.
We begin by considering qg-initiated processes where the quark is the backward-moving incoming
parton and take the leptonic decay of the Z/. The ordering described above motivates a unique
definition of t-channel momenta, namely if pa is the momentum of the backward quark, pb is
the momentum of the forward gluon and y1  y2  ...  yn, one then defines ti = q2i , where
q1 = pa  p1  p`+  p` and qi = qi1  pi for 2  i  n. Furthermore, the leading contribution,
which satisfies the requirement of maximal t-channel gluon exchanges, arises purely from the
outgoing state where all of the intermediate particles in rapidity (those labelled 2 to n 1) must
be gluons. As discussed later, the factorisation property of amplitudes in the high-energy limit
then allows us to describe the emission of each of these gluons with an independent effective
emission vertex, a generalised Lipatov vertex V  [19], multiplying the corresponding expression
for the equivalent 2  2 process, qg  qg(Z/ )``+ (see Fig. 2). At matrix-element-squared
level this gives

each process in which we take u = s - from this we can see that, in this limit, those
processes which admit a t-channel gluon exchange dominate.
3.7 Effective Vertices For Real Emissions
In order to generalise what we have done so far to higher multiplicity scattering events
we begin by considering qQ qQg in the high energy limit. The five diagrams which
contribute at leading order are illustrated in fig. (3.6). The diagram where the extra
gluon is emitted from the t-channel gluon is given by:
Mt-channel =
ta1tb2

(3.56)
In the High Energy limit the second term in each of the lines is suppressed with
respect to the first and can therefore be disregarded. This turns out to be equivalent
to considering p2 as a soft emission using the Eikonal approximation. The resulting
3.7. Effective Vertices For Real Emissions
The spinor formalism clearly displays the factorisation in the t-channel of the scattering,
i.e. within the spinor formalism, the impact factors are clearly identified as the quark currents;
in contrast, the spinor product rewriting of Eq. (11) mixes momenta from the two quark lines.
The standard procedure for extracting impact factors using the helicity formalism [20] applies
the kinematic approximations valid in the MRK limit. In terms of invariants, the square of the
colour and spin averaged and summed scattering matrix element for qQ  qQ is
s2 + u2
. (15)
The u2-terms arise from scattering of quark currents of different helicities, and spoil the factori-
sation implied in Eq. (6) from being exact, necessitating the consideration of kinematic limits of
the squared scattering matrix element. This despite the fact that for processes which proceed
only through a t-channel gluon exchange, the starting expression in terms of spinor strings is
already factorised.
In the MRK limit (of infinite rapidity separation between the scattered partons), the expres-
sion for the colour and helicity summed and averaged matrix element simplifies to the 2-jet part
of Eq. (6) since all allowed helicity scatterings give the same result in the limit and
|[a b] 2 1| = s, t  |p|2. (16)
This is the lowest order results in Eqs. (4)(6).
3.2 Multi-Parton Production
In this section we will develop the picture of the scattering of two quark currents to take into
account the emission of additional gluons. We first consider adding one extra gluon to the
qQ  qQ scattering we have taken as our model so far; this may be emitted from the t-channel
gluon or from each of the external quark lines, Fig. 7.
Firstly the three gluon vertex in the t-channel emission gives a contribution of
Cgg3s
u(p1)u(pA) u(p3)u(pB) 
 ((q1 + q2)
g + (p2  q2)g  (q1 + p2)g) ,
where Cg = Twa1aAf
wi2vT va3aB . In the MRK limit, we can use Eq. (9) for the spinor strings, and
q1 = p3  pB + p2 and q2 = pa  p1  p2 to get
2g3s
pA(s3B + 2s2B) + p
B(s1A + 2s2A) + (q1 + q2)
. (18)
The MRK limit (Eq. (1)) gives s2B  s3B and s2A  s1A so we are left with
AMRKg =
2g3s s
2pA
+ (q1 + q2)
. (19)
Figure 7: We add contributions where the 3rd jet (red) is emitted from the t-channel gluon, and
from each of the four external quark lines.

MEik. = (igs)321||a3||bf2deT b3bT e1a
ta1tb3
p+  p2
ta1 
p  p2
, (3.59)
which has a colour factor similar to that found for the diagrams with a gluon emitted
from the t-channel gluon. We choose to symmetrise eqn. (3.59) by returning to pa/1
and pb/3 explicitly in place of p+ and p respectively:
3.7. Effective Vertices For Real Emissions

(3.60)
We now consider (3.55). The final term contracts the two currents and so it is only
the first two terms which need to be massaged into the right form. Once again we
approximate using pa  p1 = p+ and pb  p3 = p to write the currents as momenta.
Upon doing this we find:
Mt-channel =
ta1tb2
f i2jT i1aT
8ei(p+p  p2  pp+  p2) (q1 + q2)1||a3||b
(3.61)
where  is a phase resulting from the spinor conventions detailed in chapter 2. Now
using that s  2p+ p = 121||a3||be
i we can write all three terms as something
proportional to the desired current structure:
Mt-channel =
ta1tb2
f i2jT i1aT
21||a3||b
p  p2
 p
p+  p2
 (q1 + q2)
(3.62)
Similarly to before with MEik. we choose to include as much of the actual kinematic
information as possible by symmetrising (3.62) to get:
Mt-channel =
ta1tb2
f i2jT i1aT
21||a3||b
 (q1 + q2) +

(3.63)
Since eqns. (3.63) and (3.60) have the same colour factor we can simply sum them to

and SqQqQ contains the current contraction. Eqn. (3.65) is manifestly gauge invariant
which can be checked explicitly by calculating pg  V . It is, however clearly divergent:
if any of pa, pb, p1, p2 or p3 becomes soft then the momenta contractions in the
denominators of eqn. (3.65) will become zero. We organise the cancellation of
divergences in the following chapter.
Armed with eqn. (3.65) and the quark and gluon currents we can calculate high
multiplicity matrix elements by generalising eqn. (3.71) to include contractions of this
effective vertex expression. For example the 2  3 matrix element squared for qQ
scattering is therefore given by:
|MtqQqgQ|2 =
4(N2c  1)
ha,hb,h1,h2
|Shahbh1h2qQqQ |
gsCA
V (q1, q2)V(q1, q2)
(3.66)
This can be generalised to the 2  n matrix element by simply including more
contractions of effective vertices
|MtqQqggQ|2 =
4(N2c  1)
ha,hb,h1,h2
|Shahbh1h2qQqQ |

(3.67)
3.8. Virtual Corrections To All Orders
Using eqn. (3.67) we can describe the real emission higher order corrections but this
expression is manifestly divergent.
3.8 Virtual Corrections To All Orders
Thus far we have a prescription for approximating high energy scattering amplitudes
with additional real radiation added through the effective vertices described in
section (3.7). However, to complete our picture we must also include the virtual
corrections to the process in a similar way to the example shown in section (2.7.2).
This is important not only since these processes obviously contribute to the process
but also because, as we saw in the one loop   qq calculation, the soft divergences
in eqn. (3.65) need to be cancelled. Both the cancellation in section (2.7.2) and the
cancellation we will see here are examples of the KLN theorem [65] which states that
the soft and virtual divergences in QCD must cancel for inclusive processes.
In the High Energy limit we may include the virtual corrections to all orders in s by
using the Lipatov ansatz [62]. This is a prescription where t-channel gluon propagators
are replaced with a dressed version:
e(qi)i,i1 , (3.68)
where:
(qi) = sCAq
d2+2k
(2)2+2
k2(k  qi)2
2, (3.69)
and i,i1 is the rapidity gap between the external gluon legs emitted from the
dressed gluon. Similarly to eqn. (3.65) in the preceding section this new expression
for the propagator contains divergences arising from the soft limit of the integral in
the expression for (qi). In the following chapter we show in some detail that these
divergences cancel with those mentioned in section 3.7.
The keen reader will have noticed that eqn. (3.69) is exactly what we found in our
next-to-leading order calculation in eqn. (3.47) expressed in 2 + 2 dimensions rather
than 2 (save for a few numerical factors). This is no coincidence and, indeed, is the
source of the ansatz. Higher order (in s) calculations [40,45] have shown that to two
loops the leading logarithmic virtual part of the full 2  2 amplitude agrees exactly
with what we get when we Taylor expand the exponential term in eqn. (3.68).
3.9. High Energy Jets
3.9 High Energy Jets
3.9.1 The High Energy Jets Framework
The High Energy Jets framework is the basis of the later chapters of this thesis. Details
of this framework beyond the brief summary presented here may be found in [17, 19
21,58].
3.9.2 Factorisation Into Currents
The High Energy Jets framework is based, in part, on the observations of sections (3.3)
and (3.4). In these sections we saw that in the High Energy limit we can write down
matrix elements in the form of two vector currents contracted over a t-channel pole.
While one could argue that the fact that the qQ qQ matrix element would factorise
into a contraction of two vector currents with a t-channel pole was obvious (since the
only contribution was from a t-channel diagram), it was not at all obvious that this
would also be the case for the qg  qg amplitude. It can also be shown that the same
structure is found even in the case of gluon-gluon scattering [21].
It turns out that this factorisation into a form with only a t-channel pole holds for all
the helicity configurations where the helicities of the incoming-outgoing parton lines
remain unchanged (aside from those in the Colour Accelerated Multiplier or CAM,
factor [20]). For those diagrams where the helicity is flipped we find poles in s and u and
so these contributions are heavily suppressed in the High Energy limit. The fact that
all of the approximate helicity averaged matrix elements squared for any combination
of incoming partons, a and b, can be written as:
|M22| 
ha,hb,h1,h2
a (pa, p1) jb,(pb, p2)
, (3.70)
is exploited in High Energy Jets to express more general matrix elements (those with
higher multiplicity or more complicated final states) approximately.
Here is a convenient place to define the t-channel factorised form for matrix elements,
MtqQqQ, in which we extract the t poles from the rest of the matrix element [19]. We
write the square of eqn. (3.11) as:
|MtqQqQ|2 =
4(N2c  1)
ha,hb,h1,h2
|Shahbh1h2qQqQ |
2, (3.71)
3.9. High Energy Jets
where Nc = 3 and CF = 4/3 for QCD, S is the matrix element for a 2  2 process in
the form of a contraction of two currents, and ti are the squared t-channel momenta -
in this case t1 = (pa  p1)2 and t2 = (p2  pb)2.
While for the 2  2 examples in section (3.3) and section (3.4) eqn. (3.71) is just an
exact rewriting of a previous result, we will use the form shown here to generalise to
describing extra final state radiation in the next section at which point the t-channel
factorisation weakens to an approximation of the full result (but one which contains
enough of the underlying physics to be useful nonetheless).
Extending eqn. (3.71) to higher multiplicity final states within the High Energy Jets
framework is then done by using chains of products of effective vertices discussed in
section (3.7) (for the real emissions) and the Lipatov ansatz described in section (3.8)
(for the virtual emissions):
|MtqQqggQ|2 =
4(N2c  1)
ha,hb,h1,h2
|Shahbh1h2qQqQ |
gsCA
titi+1
V (qi, qi+1)V(qi, qi+1)e
(q2i )yi,i+1
(3.72)
Eqn. (3.71) can also be easily generalised to describing different final states by using
different current expressions in the contraction in S. For example by constructing a
current describing a W boson being emitted from an incoming-outgoing quark line we
can then write down the matrix element for the process qq  (W )eqQ using
eqn. (3.71) with S
hahbh1h2
qQqQ replaced with:
hahbheheh1h2
qq(W)eeqQ = j
W(pa, p1, pe , p) j(pb, p2). (3.73)
3.9.3 The High Energy Jets Monte Carlo
The High Energy Jets framework is implemented in a general purpose Monte Carlo,
referred to as HEJ, and publicly available at http://hej.web.cern.ch/HEJ/. This
C++ package is under continual development to test and improve it and the work of
chapter 4 was a major contribution of the author to it (among many other changes and
improvements).
Here we briefly summarise the main aspects of the software aspects of High Energy
http://hej.web.cern.ch/HEJ/
3.9. High Energy Jets
Jets. A general HEJ run consists of three main stages.
1. Setup: at which point a user defined input file is parsed and, based on the
specifics of the input, one of several class hierarchies is initialised after which
essential components for the physics stage are constructed including: an interface
to a PDF package (either MSTW or LHAPDF (v6)), a (pseudo-)random number
generator and a physics analysis class structure.
HEJ comes with a stand-alone analysis class which implements many standard
operations and is therefore sufficient in most cases. It may also be interfaced
with the Rivet analysis package; this is particularly useful when comparing Monte
Carlo results to data since many experimental analyses are implemented in Rivet
routines and it is, in principle, just a matter of plugging in the right analysis name.
2. Monte Carlo Generation: In the Monte Carlo stage of a HEJ run we proceed
iteratively over a (typically very large) number of events. For each event we
must generate a point in phase space; a number of outgoing partons and their
momentum. With this information we can use our knowledge of xa and xb and the
importance sampling ideas discussed in chapter 2 to randomly generate parton
types for our incoming partons - there are, of course, additional constraints which
are process dependent to consider. For example, we will never select a gluon-gluon
incoming pairing if we wish to calculate the matrix element for Z/+jets in an
FKL configuration since there is no such contribution.
Once we have a definite phase space and the incoming types have been specified
we can calculate the matrix element using some generalisation of eqn. (3.71)
- the exact matrix element used will depend on the final state multiplicity and
the process chosen by the user in stage (1). Virtual corrections are also included
at this stage. Lastly we perform a multiplicative matching to the exact leading
order matrix element provided by MadGraph aMC@NLO (v5), the details of which
will be discussed further in chapter 4.
We include the 2-, 3- and 4-jet non-FKL contributions as exclusive sums to correct
the total cross section. This is done separately to the resummation Monte Carlo
calls, it can either be computed as a stand-alone run and then summed with
the FKL matched resummation events upon completion or both FKL and non-
FKL configurations can be calculated as a single run. In practise the majority
of the computer time is spent on these non-FKL terms as processes such as
gg  (Z/ )e+eggggg are complex matrix elements and therefore are slow
to evaluate even at leading order.
3.9. High Energy Jets
3. Analysis: In the analysis stage the event is passed to either the HEJ analysis
framework or to Rivet. Here we enforce kinematic constraints on our final state
to study the regions of phase space we are interested in - or those regions probed
by a particular experimental analysis whose results we wish to compare to. In
HEJ it is possible perform a complete run un-cut whereby the generated events
are outputted before the analysis phase into a given format (ROOT N-tuples, LH
events and HepMC (v2) records are all supported). This is preferable when the same
generation can be reused multiple times however for very long runs outputting
all of the events becomes unfeasible due to storage requirements (this was the
case for the work presented in chapter 5) and we must take the second option
of performing HEJ analyses on-the-fly i.e. cutting as we iterate through events,
binning into histograms and discarding event details.
While this breakdown is a good broad strokes overview of HEJ there are hundreds
of intricacies which must be treated along the way. One worth mentioning is the
calculation of scale uncertainty bands for predictions. In section (2.3) we discussed
how some given observable, R, will depend on the renormalisation scale, r, or more
specifically - how it must not. Our theory is, after all, meaningless if its predictions
are effected by a choice of an unphysical scale. However, when we do our perturbative
expansion (through a resummation or fixed-order approach) we develop a dependence
on this scale. It is important to understand the size of this dependence and so when
generating Monte Carlo predictions we must produce not only a central prediction for
each value but also an associated scale uncertainty band. For fixed-order calculations
this is simply a case of varying s through the value of r but since the High Energy
Jets matrix element contains scale dependence through the QCD coupling and the
Lipatov ansatz we must evaluate entire matrix elements at a variety of scales to properly
understand our dependence and to provide meaningful predictions. The factorisation
scale must also be varied (in tandem with varying r) to get a complete scale uncertainty
band and this is run by default as part of HEJ.
In a standard partonic HEJ run we evaluate the matrix element for each event at 76
different scale choices. 76 because we give four choices for the central scale and for each
central scale we take 5 values for r and f (the central value multiplicatively scaled
by 1/2, 1/
2, 1,
2 and 2) but exclude the combinations where the relative ratio is
greater than 2 - leaving 19 for each central choice. The remaining combinations form
an envelope of predictions for each bin in each plot which indicate our dependence on
the renormalisation and factorisation scales. Scale bands are shown in all integrated
distributions in chapters 46.

3.9.4 Matching to ARIADNE
The HEJ scheme for describing all-order corrections to jet rates at hadronic colliders
is based on the limit in which emissions are both hard and well separated. Of course,
some radiation at hadronic colliders is soft or produced collinear to other radiation (or
both) and such emissions also lead to large logarithmic enhancements similar to those
discussed in this work and so it is obviously advantageous to describe both. These
effects can be included through a parton shower description.
HEJ has been matched to the ARIADNE parton shower [18]. ARIADNE [63] is based on the
Lund colour dipole model [54] which attempts to describe final state QCD radiation
resulting from a hard scatter: it considers the splitting of colour dipoles into more colour
dipoles rather than partons splitting to more partons. It calculates the probability of
an emission from the splitting function, D(p2, y), as being approximately given by:
D(p2, y) 
|Mn+1|2
|Mn|2
, (3.74)
where z is the energy fraction carried by the emission. From this one defines no-
emission probabilities, (p21, p
2), which give us the probability that no extra
radiation is emitted as we evolve the squared transverse momentum of a parton between
two scales p21 and p
(p21, p
2) = exp
dyD(p2, y)
. (3.75)
Matching HEJ to ARIADNE is very different to the usual hard-scatter matching to a
parton shower. As we will see in chapter 4, HEJ includes radiation down to a very soft
scale and so were we to perform a nave matching to a parton shower we would be
double-counting all of the soft non-collinear radiation. Fig. (3.7a) shows the average
ARIADNE splitting function, D/z, compared to the equivalent expression in HEJ for
30 GeV jets. The extra emissions were required to be at least r = 0.5 away from
the emitting parton in order to probe only the soft contributions coming from the
shower. HEJ includes soft emissions and therefore we expect to see that the majority
of the emissions from ARIADNE are already being described by the partonic description.
Indeed fig. (3.7a) shows that, aside from extremely soft radiation, the average splitting
function of HEJ is indeed greater than that of ARIADNE. Fig. (3.7b) shows a similar
comparison where the extra emissions were required to have transverse momentum of
10 GeV but no cut on r was applied so that we are now investigating the effect
3.9. High Energy Jets
of the collinearity of the extra emission on the splitting function. This time we see
a much bigger difference in the splitting functions at low values of r, i.e. collinear
emissions. This is expected since one of the key approximations required to derive our
matrix element expressions is that emissions are well separated in rapidity. At values
of r greater than the jet definition of 0.6 we see that as in the soft radiation case the
HEJ splitting function is greater than the shower splitting function. When generating
showered events with HEJ+ARIADNE we must be careful not to double count terms; it is
clear from figs. (3.7a) and (3.7b) that soft and wide-angle emissions are taken care of
by HEJ and so it would be a mistake to allow ARIADNE to also generate these.
An outline of the algorithm for matching ARIADNE to HEJ is as follows:
 HEJ generates a partonic state. The extremal partons are required to form jets
while the gluon emissions from the effective vertices are allowed to be soft (but
still above some very soft scale, cut (e.g. 0.2 GeV).
 ARIADNE then begins its dipole cascade. Each additional dipole generated by
ARIADNE is checked to see if it is an emission that could have been generated by
HEJ. If it could be a High Energy Jets emission then the emission is rejected with
probability rHEJ/rARIADNE, where:
rHEJ =
|Mtn+1|2
|Mtn|2
, (3.76)
rARIADNE =
|Mn+1|2
|Mn|2
. (3.77)
Any emission which could not have been generated by HEJ is automatically kept,
e.g. gluons splitting to quark-antiquark pairs, gluon emissions outside of the
extremal partons in rapidity or emissions between the High Energy Jets soft cut-
off, cut.
 Upon completion of the cascade the final state is passed to PYTHIA to perform
hadronisation.
3.9.5 Comparisons to data
The High Energy Jets framework has been thoroughly tested for a number of
the currently available final states (jets, W+jets and Z/+jets) against other
theoretical descriptions and experimental data in analyses by the ATLAS, CMS and
D collaborations [1, 35,7, 36,58].
3.9. High Energy Jets
These studies probe wide ranges of experimental observables with a variety of cuts
designed to probe specific regions of phase space. High Energy Jets is seen to provide
an excellent description of data in all of these studies in the regions of phase space
close to the High Energy limit. Interestingly there are cases where HEJ is seen to be
competitive with other state-of-the-art theoretical descriptions even when we are far
from this strict limit. We now discuss a few specific examples of comparisons to data.
In fig. (2.5) we see that the probability of a third emission from a dijet system
(constructed from the most forward and backward jets in the event) in addition to
a W boson. As we pull apart the dijet system there is increasingly more phase space
into which we can radiate extra emissions and so the probability of emission increases.
We see that HEJ and BlackHat describe the data well across the full range of the
dijet rapidity, yjF ,jB , while the other generators considerably underestimate the dijet
activity.
Fig. (3.8) describes the differential distribution for W plus dijets in terms of the
invariant mass of the dijet system defined by the two leading jets in p, m12. The
logarithms resummed by High Energy Jets become significant for large values of m12
and so we expect that HEJ should describe this distribution well while fixed-order
schemes who cannot capture these large logarithmic corrections may not. In fact,
HEJ gives the best description of data across almost the entire range of mjj with
the other theoretical predictions only agreeing with data below an invariant mass of
approximately 300 GeV, deviating badly by 2 TeV. This high invariant mass region is
an important region for VBF studies and so it is important that we are able to describe
QCD emissions here. The failure of fixed order calculations show that perturbative
stability already begins to breakdown in 7 TeV LHC data. This is a challenge we must
face in LHC run II and as we will see in chapter 6 this is a challenge we must face at a
potential high energy Future Circular Collider.

average) larger than that from ARIADNE.
5 Results
In this section we compare first the effective splitting function from HEJ with that of
ARIADNE, in both the soft and the collinear regions. We then study in details the effects
of the shower on a sample event-configuration from HEJ , before moving on to a study of
the resulting shower profiles, which are compared to ATLAS data. Finally, we discuss the
impact of the shower on a few observables discussed in e.g. Ref. [20, 3537], which are
sensitive to the description of hard, radiative corrections.
5.1 Comparison of Splitting Functions
In Fig. 2 we compare the average value of the splitting functions D/z calculated in ARIADNE
and with HEJ (Eq. (4.1)), after division with s (to remove the effects of a different
evaluation of s in ARIADNE and HEJ ), as a function of the transverse momentum of the
trial emission. The average is over each bin in the distribution, for an unweighted HEJ event
sample of 26 GeV dijets, where at least one reconstructed jet above 30 GeV is required in
the post-shower analysis. We have used only the subset of ARIADNE trial splittings where
the original dipole consists of partons from HEJ , and where the trial splitting is at least
a distance R = 0.5 away from any of the original HEJ partons. This is to test only the
soft (but not collinear) description in the two frameworks. Generally, the effective splitting
functions for wide-angle emissions are quite similar in HEJ and ARIADNE. However, we
see that, on average, the ARIADNE splitting function is larger than the effective splitting

function from HEJ only for emissions of transverse momenta less than about 10 GeV, and
then only by a small amount. This means that effectively, wide-angle emissions harder than
about 10 GeV are automatically vetoed in the subtraction mechanism, since the probability
for emissions is larger in HEJ than in ARIADNE.
We see by comparing the explicit numbers that the HEJ splitting function (after
division by s) tends to
in the MRK region of semi-hard, wide-angle emissions. This
is the result of the full tree-level QCD (and the pure BFKL formalism).
In Fig. 3 we compare the average value of D/z in ARIADNE and that arising from
HEJ for a sample of ARIADNE trial emissions (again from original HEJ partons) of harder
than 10 GeV in transverse momentum, as a function of the distance r (in (rapidity,)) to
the nearest HEJ parton. Here we see that at small r, the ARIADNE splitting function is
an order of magnitude larger than the subtraction term from HEJ . The HEJ subtraction
term is (on average) larger than the (average) ARIADNE splitting function only for r > 0.6,
which in this case was also chosen as the jet size parameter in the anti-kt jet clustering.
The change in behaviour for the effective HEJ splitting function at the jet-size parameter
is because of the use of two different effective emission vertices, depending on whether or
not the additional HEJ -emissions are collinear to the partons extremal in rapidity.

Chapter 4
Z/+Jets at the LHC
Except where otherwise referenced the work in this chapter and the subsequent chapters
refers to work undertaken by the author as part of the High Energy Jets collaboration.
This work is the theoretical foundation for the full-flexible parton level Monte Carlo
generator soon to be publicly available from
http://hej.web.cern.ch/HEJ/
and is published in [58].
4.1 Introducing Z/+Jets at the LHC
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has opened up a new range of energies for hadronic
collisions. It has already been a resounding success with the discovery of the scalar
Higgs boson completing the particle content of the Standard Model (SM). Hadronic
colliders, by their very nature, lead to final states with large amounts of QCD radiation
and being able to accurately describe this is essential. Both the SM and many Beyond
the Standard Model theories predict events with multiple hard jets in the final state
and as seen in the previous chapter this can pose a serious problem for fixed-order
descriptions.
The current best approach for describing QCD radiation is through the use of a Monte
Carlo (MC) generators using the principles outlined in section 2.9. A wide range
of such MC generators are available implementing everything from the fixed-order
perturbative schemes discussed in chapter 2 to parton shower models which resum
the logarithms arising from soft and collinear logarithms. The current state-of-the-
art for fixed-order is the next-to-leading order calculation of Z/ plus 4 jets by the
http://hej.web.cern.ch/HEJ/
4.1. Introducing Z/+Jets at the LHC
BlackHat collaboration [57] while jet production in association with Z/ has only
been computed for QCD merged with a parton shower for up to 2 jets [34, 69]. This
soft and collinear radiation is experimentally observed to cascade from outgoing high
energy quarks and gluons in chaotic patterns we refer to as jets. While parton showers
do a good job of describing the composition of jets they cannot be expected to give the
correct description of the large invariant mass region based solely on their resummation
of soft and collinear logarithms. Merging parton showers with fixed order schemes helps
give a better description of multi-jet states however the current state-of-the-art for the
fixed order component is still limited to next-to-leading order in s (with the exception
of the recent N3LO result [14]).
In the High Energy Jets framework we aim to resum the large logarithmic corrections
arising from well separated (in rapidity), hard final state jets. We capture these
important terms by calculating those diagrams which contribute a leading logarithm
in the High Energy limit at all orders in s.
In the remainder of this chapter we discuss how we can describe the production of
di-leptons plus multiple hard jets through the emission of an electroweak Z0 boson
and an off-shell photon, . We do this by constructing a current describing Z/
emission from one of the incoming quark or anti-quark lines and then combine this
with a passive quark or gluon current as was described in section 3.9.2. The effective
vertex derived in section 3.7 can then be used to generalise the resulting matrix element
to give an approximate description of the (Z/ )e+e + n jets final state valid in
the High Energy limit of QCD discussed in chapter 3. The interference present from
the multiple possible emission sites of the Z/ is described exactly by a generalisation
of the t-channel picture which allows for multiple chains of momenta flowing through
the reggeised gluons in the t-channel. This approach requires a new regularisation
procedure to carefully render the resulting matrix element finite when we consider the
cancellation of poles from the Lipatov propagator terms and the effective vertices. We
also treat the interference arising from the two distinct emissions (Z0 and ) exactly.
The formal accuracy of the description given here is LO+LL. The leading order accuracy
is achieved by performing a multiplicative matching to exact matrix elements generated
using MadGraph aMC@NLO. As discussed in section 3.9 this required a completely new
matching set-up and this too is described later in this chapter along with some of the
other computational challenges encountered along the way.
Finally we present a comparison of results from High Energy Jets Z/ plus jets to
several recent experimental studies at the LHC; both from the ATLAS collaboration
and from the CMS experiment. We see that we describe the data well in these studies
4.2. Constructing Z/+jets
and, in particular, in the regions of phase-space with large rapidity gaps and high
invariant mass High Energy Jets gives a better description of the data than the other
fixed-order and fixed-order plus parton shower predictions included.
4.2 Constructing Z/+jets
We now consider the construction of a current and an all orders inclusive cross-section
for the Z/. We start by looking at just the Z0 emission from a single fermion line.
4.2.1 A Current for Z0+Jets
For any given initial state (excluding the case of gluon-gluon scattering which will not
contribute an FKL configuration) there are two possible emission sites for the Z0 per
fermion i.e. two for qg and qg scattering and four for qq, qq and qq scattering. The
emission sites on a single fermion line are illustrated in fig. (4.1). In the language of
currents discussed previously we call the left hand side of fig. (4.1) jZ . It is given by:
jZ =

4.2. Constructing Z/+jets
We can expand the quark and lepton momenta using their completeness relations which,
in terms of spinor-helicity brackets, is given by:
/pi = |i+i+|+ |ii|. (4.2)
This fixes the helicity of the incoming quark, hin, and the outgoing quark, hout, to
be identical, and we are left with a current which only has four possible helicity
configurations depending on hq = hin = hout and the electron helicity, he:
jZ (hq, he) = C

2pa1hq ||ahq  1hq ||e+hqe
||ahq  1hq ||ehqe

(pin  pZ)2
(4.3)
We can then express amplitudes for Z0 plus jets in terms of contractions of a Z0
emitting current with either a quark or gluon current discussed previously. Taking the
concrete example of qg  Zqg we can write the matrix element as follows:
|MtqgZqg|
(pa  p1  pe+  pe)2(pb  pn)2
hq ,he,hg
|jZ (hq, he)jg(hg)|2. (4.4)
We will investigate the behaviour of eqn. (4.4) for a slice through the final state
phase-space where each particles momenta is parametrised by:
pi =ki
cosh(yi); cos(i), sin(i), sinh(yi)

1 = e+ =  + 0.2 e = ( + 0.2),
y1 =  y2 =  ye+ =  ye =  1.5,
(4.5)
So as  increases we pull the two jets apart in rapidity. In this phase space slice
the lepton pair are emitted in the forward region and so the physical picture is that
the incoming quark with pa  p1 = p+ emits a Z0 and then a t-channel gluon (or a
t-channel gluon and then a Z0).
We then observe the behaviour shown in fig. (4.2): as we pull the jets apart in rapidity
(i.e. as we go to large ) we see that the matrix element approaches a constant; this
is the result which would be obtained by using the BFKL formalism in which all jets
are taken be infinitely well separated in rapidity.
As we expect for the case of 2  2 scattering we see exact agreement between our
expression and the leading order result obtained from MadGraph aMC@NLO [12]. It is
clear that the BFKL limit is not reached until relatively large values for , therefore it
would be a poor approximation were we to just take the infinite rapidity limit of this
as our expression for the Z0 matrix element.
The picture becomes more complicated when considering the qQ  ZqQ scattering
since there are now four possible places where the (anti-)quark may emit the Z0.
In previous work by the High Energy Jets collaboration the case of W plus
multiple hard jets was treated by attaching the boson to a single external quark line
probabilistically [17]. In the case of W the interference terms arising from multiple
boson emission sites is small and can be neglected, the reason for this is two fold.
Firstly, the emission of the W changes the flavour of the emitting quark line and so
the final state will differ in almost all diagrams depending on where you emit (and
hence there is no interference allowed), the exceptions to this are processes such as
uu (W )e+ eud where either line could have been the emitter and so these are
PDF suppressed. Secondly, in order to have interference the W boson must be able
to be emitted from multiple legs and have the same charge wherever you attach it -
again this is because the W will decay to a distinct final state and no interference can
occur. With these constraints in mind there are far fewer diagrams which contribute
to the interference effects in W-plus-jets. However as we will see later in the case of
Z/ this leads to an approximate matrix element which differs significantly from the
leading-order result and so here we will include not only the contributions to the matrix

element arising from the Z0 being emitted from both (anti-)quark legs separately but
also the resulting interference term.
4.2.2 Z0 Emission Interference
Our high-energy description of the matrix elements relies on the correct description of
the t-channel momenta, and this obviously depends on which of the quark lines the Z0
was emitted from. We therefore need to modify the simple framework outlined above.
We will use the subscript a (b) to label the current at the lowest (highest) end of the
rapidity chain. We then define ta (tb) to be the t-channel momentum exchanged when
the bosons are emitted at the lowest (highest) end of the rapidity chain. Then the
amplitude squared for qQ qQ(Z0 )e+e is given by:

a  jb
ja  jZ
{(jZ0a  jb
)(ja  jZ
(4.6)
where ja,b are the pure quark currents defined previously. The coupling constants of the
Z0 to the relevant quarks and leptons are contained within jZ
(hq, he), as in eqn. (4.1).
Fig. (4.3) shows the value of this matrix element squared scaled by the squared partonic
centre-of-mass energy for increasing rapidity separation of the two jets. Once again the
result is compared with that obtained from the full, tree-level matrix elements from
MadGraph aMC@NLO. The slice through phase space here is the same as that used in the
previous section given by eqn. (4.5). Fig. (4.3) also shows the separate contributions
to the total matrix element squared coming from the Z/ emission from the forward
moving quark line (black, dashed) and emission from the backward moving quark line
(green, dotted). In this phase space slice, the leptons also have an increasing positive
rapidity and so the forward emission matrix element describes the full matrix element
most closely, with the contribution from backward-emission falling at large values of y.
The sum of the forward and backward emission matrix elements neglecting interference
(magenta, dotted) significantly overestimates the final result. Once the destructive
interference effects have been taken into account, the full sum (red, solid) correctly
reproduces the LO matrix element (blue, thick solid). It is therefore clear that at low
rapidities the inclusion of the interference effect plays an important role in the accuracy
of the matrix element.
Fig. (4.3) shows that in the region of very high rapidity separation the full matrix
element squared (scaled by s2 and an irrelevant phase space factor) approaches a
constant. We could have predicted this behaviour by considering eqn. (3.16); in the
strict High Energy limit all the absolute rapidity information becomes lost and we only
have dependence on s and the transverse momenta of the outgoing partons (we still
have information about the rapidity gap through s using eqn. (3.8)). In this case we
also have the Z0 propagator and its couplings to the partons and leptons to consider
but the kinematics of the t-channel gluon still dominates. The limit approached can
be easily evaluated by applying the high energy limit, since in the y  limit only
the forward emission term contributes we have:

4.2.3 Photonic Interference
Since any virtual Z0 decaying to an e+e pair could also have proceeded via an off-shell
virtual photon, , we must also include these processes and the resulting interference
between the Z0 and .
The  emission matrix element is similar to that of the Z0-only matrix element
shown in eqn. (4.4) and the same story applies with the possible emission sites causing
interference. All that needs to be changed is the propagator term and the couplings
of the boson to the emitting (anti-)quark and the decay products. The full current for
Z/ emission is then obtained by summing the two separate currents as follows:
 (hq, he) = j
 (hq, he) + j
(hq, he). (4.8)
Then upon squaring eqn. (4.8) we will automatically include the interference terms from
the cross-terms. The inclusion of the virtual photon terms is particularly important
when studying a combined lepton invariant mass, (pe+ + pe)
2, far from the Z0 Breit-
Wigner mass peak. This can be seen in fig. (4.4), where slices through phase space
are shown similarly to fig. (4.3), but now for an (a) lower and (b) higher value of the
di-lepton mass. In both cases, the contribution of the virtual photon processes is above
4.2.4 The 2 n Matrix Element
Armed with eqn. (4.8) we can extend eqn. (4.4) in the obvious way to form a complete
matrix element for the emission of a Z/ boson. We can also describe the various
possibilities (qq, qg and gq) simply by substituting the currents which apply in any
given situation. Of course, in practice we use the importance sampling techniques
discussed in chapter 3 to randomly sample the possible incoming parton types and so
all combinations of currents are included.
Following in the vein of the previous chapter we now look to extend our description
to higher multiplicity final states. Since our expression for the effective vertices are
independent of the currents at either end of the t-chain we can write the squared
matrix element for qQ (Z/ )e+eq(n 2)gQ as:

TheO(2sW ) tree-level contribution as described in HEJ (red, dashed) exactly matches
that of MadGraph aMC@NLO (blue, solid). The terms corresponding to the production of
a Z0 boson only (green, dotted) significantly undershoots the full result. The virtual
photon terms are, therefore, clearly an important contribution to the matrix element
away from the Z0 Breit-Wigner peak.

In the case of n = 2, this reduces back to eqn. (4.6). If either a or b is an incoming gluon
then there are only two possible emission sites for the Z/ once again and therefore
we only need calculate one t-channel momenta chain and one can set the relevant j
b to zero in eqn. (4.6).
Fig.s (4.5) and (4.6) show the phase space slices for qQ  (Z/ )e+eqgQ and
qQ (Z/ )e+eqggQ respectively, we see the same behaviour as observed for the
2 jet final state described in fig. (4.2). For these higher multiplicity final states we only
approximate the leading order matrix element however we see that at large rapidity
separations our approximation converges to the exact result as indeed it must in the
High Energy limit.
Eqn. (4.9) gives us the all-orders real corrections to Z/ plus jets which we wish
to sum for all n. However, before proceeding to calculate the cross-section we must
carefully render eqn. (4.9) finite by including the corresponding virtual corrections
whose divergences will cancel the pathologies in the effective vertices.
4.3 Regularising the Z/+Jets Matrix Element
4.3.1 Real Soft Emissions
To calculate useful quantities such as cross sections etc. we must integrate equation
eqn. (4.9) over all of phase space. However, as discussed in chapter 2 problems arise
when we attempt to integrate over the soft regions of phase space. It is well understood
that the divergences coming from soft real emissions cancel with those coming from
virtual emissions and so we must explicitly show this cancellation and calculate the
remaining finite contribution multiplying the (n1)-final state parton matrix element.

Figure 4.5: A slice through phase space for the Z/+ 3 jet final state. The slice
defined is akin to that described for the 2 jet case in fig. (4.2) where as  increases we
pull apart all three jets and the leptonic decay products are emitted increasingly far
into the forward direction.
In the previous work on W emission the finite remainder from this cancellation was
found to be [16,19]:

where i1,i+1 is the rapidity span of the final state partons either side of our soft
emission and |~qj|2 is the sum of squares of the transverse components of the jth t-
channel gluon momenta. cut is a parameter we choose which defines the soft region.
That is, any real emission satisfying p2  2cut we consider a hard perturbative emission
while any emission with p2 < 2cut we consider too soft to be resolved.
Here we investigate the cancellation of these divergences for Z0 emission and most
importantly whether the finite term is of the same form for the interference term which
was previously excluded.

Figure 4.6: A slice through phase space for the Z/+ 3 jet final state. The slice
defined is akin to that described for the 2 and 3 jet case shown in fig. (4.2) and fig. (4.5)
respectively.
We start by looking at a 2  n process and take the limit of one final state parton
momentum, pi, becoming small. Because of the form of eqn. (4.9) this amounts to
looking at the effect of an external gluon becoming soft on our expression for the
effective vertex for real emissions.
We can immediately see that for pi going soft the gluon chain momenta going into,
and coming out of, the jth emission site will coincide: qj+1  qj , therefore:
V (qj , qj+1) = 2qj  2
b + 2
pa (4.11)
Furthermore we can see that the two final terms from the bracketed expressions will
dominate as pj  0 and so we can approximate the full vertex by:
4.3. Regularising the Z/+Jets Matrix Element
V (qj , qj+1)  2
b + 2
pa. (4.12)
In eqn. (4.9) we have three terms involving the effective vertex; quadratic terms
like V 2(qtj , qt(j+1)) and V
2(qbj , qb(j+1)) and interference terms like V (qtj , qt(j+1)) 
V (qbj , qb(j+1)). The procedure for the V
2 terms follows similarly for both the quadratic
top-line emission and bottom-line emission terms and so only the calculation for top-line
emission is shown here.
V 2(qtj , qt(j+1)) Terms
Upon squaring eqn. (4.12) and imposing the on-shell conditions for pa and pb we have:
V 2(qti, qti) = 
sbisai
q4ti (4.13)
We must now explicitly calculate the invariant mass terms. Since we are in the High
Energy regime we have that p+a  pa , pa and p+b  p
b , pb therefore we may take:
sab = 2pa  pb  2p+a pb , (4.14)
sbi = 2pb  pi  2pb p
i , (4.15)
sai = 2pa  pi  2p+a pi . (4.16)
Using this we can write eqn. (4.13) as:
V 2(qti, qti) = 
|~p1|2
q4ti, (4.17)
Now looking back to eqn. (4.9) we see that each vertex is associated with factors of
q2ti q
t(i+1)
but since the emission is soft qti = qt(i+1) and this becomes q
ti . That factor
conspires to cancel with the corresponding factor of q4ti in eqn. (4.17). Including the
additional factors of CA and gs the finite factor remaining is given by:
|~p|2
, (4.18)
4.3. Regularising the Z/+Jets Matrix Element
V (qti, qt(i+1))  V (qbi, qb(i+1)) Terms
Taking the mixed dot-product of the two vertex terms we have:
V (qti, qti)  V (qbi, qbi) = 
saisbi
ttitbi, (4.19)
having simplified the expression using p2a = 0 and p
b = 0 once again. The invariant
mass terms here are identical to those we saw in the V 2 terms and the products of
ttitbi also appear in the denominator of the interference term in eqn. (4.9). After this
cancellation we are left with exactly what we had before in eqn. (4.18). Since the same
factor comes from all three terms at the amplitude squared level we factor them out
and express the amplitude squared for an n-parton final state with one soft emission
in terms of an (n 1)-parton final state amplitude squared multiplied by the common
factor:

Integration of Soft Divergences
As discussed above the divergences contained in eqn. (4.20) only become apparent after
we have attempted to integrate over phase space. The Lorentz invariant phase space
integral associated with pi is given by:
d3~pi
(2)32Ei
|~p|2
. (4.21)
It is convenient to exchange the integral over the z-component of momentum with one
over rapidity, y2. Rapidity and transverse momentum are related through the definition
of rapidity given in eqn. (3.2) and the Jacobian of this transformation is given by:
Therefore upon performing the change of variables the phase space integral reads:

, (4.22)
where we have analytically continued the integral to 2 + 2 dimensions to regulate
the anticipated divergences and introduced the parameter  to keep the coupling
dimensionless in the process. We have also introduced an upper bound on the
transverse momentum integration of cut - this parameter will be discussed in more
detail later. Converting to polar coordinates and using the result for the volume of a
unit hypersphere gives the integrated soft contribution:

As promised eqn. (4.23) is clearly divergent in the limit where  0.
4.3.2 Virtual Emissions

4.3.3 Cancellation of Infrared Divergences
We now have all the necessary ingredients to show how the infrared contributions
from soft real emissions and virtual emissions cancel leaving our integrated matrix
element finite. The only subtlety being that we must sum two diagrams with different
multiplicity final states to see the cancellation. This is because they are experimentally
indistinguishable; the 2  (n  1) virtual diagram has (n  1) resolvable partons in
the final state and we only see (n 1) of the final states partons from 2 n process
because we consider one of the emissions too soft to resolve.
The matrix element squared for the real emission diagram with one soft parton will
look like:

where we have taken the ith gluon to be soft. After including the virtual corrections
via the insertion of the Lipatov ansatz the 2 (n 1) matrix element squared is:

We can now go through term-by-term to show the divergences cancel and find the finite
contribution to the matrix element squared. As when we calculated the soft terms the
arguments for the pure top- and bottom-line emissions follow similarly and so here we
will only state the procedure for the top emission.
For the top line emission we identify the following terms that will appear in the sum of
the 2 (n 1) virtual and 2 n real matrix elements. The finite contribution, Ftop,
to the matrix element is given by:
Ftop =
(2)2+24
i1,i+1
(+ 1)
2cut
+ e2(qti)i1,i+1 . (4.31)
Extracting the relevant power of the strong coupling from the exponential and
substituting for (qi) gives:

+O(2).
(4.34)
For the terms arising from the bottom quark-line emission we have:
Fbottom =
sCAi1,i+1

, (4.35)
Lastly, for the interference terms we expand the exponential with both top-line emission,
qti, momenta and bottom-line emission, qbi, momenta to get:

Eqn. (4.36) is a new result which allows the inclusion of the interference terms shown
to be important in previous discussion. We can now express the regulated qQ 
Z/q(n 2)gQ matrix element as follows:

(4.37)
where we have defined

. (4.38)
There is one final improvement we can make to eqn. (4.37). The expressions we obtain
upon taking the soft limit of the three effective vertex terms, V 2t , V
b and Vt  Vb, are
not exact and there are sub-leading terms which we can account for. We therefore
have to account for the difference between, e.g V 2(qi1, qi)/(ti1ti), and its strict
limit of 4/p2i for values of pi below cut. In practice, we include this correction for
ccut < |p| < cut with ccut = 0.2 GeV and find stable results around this value (see
section 4.4).
We are, at last, in a position to move forward and form an expression for an all-orders
gauge invariant finite matrix element for Z/ plus jets. Before pressing on we now
discuss an example calculation showing explicitly the finite nature of matrix element
expression.
4.3.4 An Explicit Check: 2 3 Scattering
Consider the case of 2  3 scattering where on of the final state momenta, p2, has
become soft. A contributing soft diagram is shown in fig. (4.7a) and one example of a
contributing virtual diagram of the same order is shown in fig. (4.7b). When p2 goes

strange way - this was done to make clear the cancellation when working through the
algebra.

4.4 Subtractions and the cut scale
We now show the stability of the High Energy Jets predictions with respect to the cut
scale described above.
We increase our sensitivity to the parameter by showing results for FKL momentum
configurations only. The non-FKL samples which are included to give the total cross
sections have no dependence on cut and would therefore dilute any dependence in the
full sample. We begin with tab. (4.1) where we show the value of the cross section
for different values of cut for exclusive 2-, 3- and 4-jet samples. The cuts applied are
the same as in section 4.7.1. It is clear that the cross section does not display a large
dependence on the value of cut.

Fig. (4.8) shows the effect of the same variation in cut on the differential distribution
in both the rapidity gap between the two leading jets in p, yj1,j2, (a)(c), and the
rapidity gap between the two extremal jets in rapidity, yjf,jb, (d)(f). Results are
shown for exclusive 2-, 3- and 4-jet samples in each case. The distributions also show
a very weak dependence on the choice of cut. In practice, our default chosen value for
cut is 0.2.

4.5 The Differential Z/ Cross-Section
Starting from eqn. (4.37) we can write down a total (differential) cross section obtained
by summing over all values of the number of final state partons, n, and integrating over
the full n-particle phase space using an efficient Monte Carlo sampling algorithm [16,22]:

where xa,b are the momentum fractions of the incoming partons and ffk(xk, Qk) are the
corresponding parton density functions for beam, k, and flavour fk. The function cut
imposes the desired cuts on the final state. The minimum requirement is that the final
state momenta cluster into at least two jets for the desired jet clustering algorithm.
In the regions of phase space where all final state particles are well separated in rapidity,
this gives the dominant terms in QCD at all orders in s (the leading logarithmic
terms in s/t). However, in other areas of phase space, the differences due to the
approximations used in |MHEJreg
qQZ/q(n2)gQ|
2 will become more significant as we saw in
figs. (4.2), (4.5) and (4.6). We therefore further improve upon eqn. (4.43) by matching
our results to fixed order results. Here, we match to high-multiplicity tree-level results
obtained from MadGraph aMC@NLO [12] in two different ways. This amounts to merging
tree-level samples of different orders according to the logarithmic prescription of HEJ.
1. Matching for FKL configurations:
As described in chapter 3, these are the particle assignments and momentum
configurations which contain the dominant leading-logarithmic terms in s/t.
The first step of the HEJ description was to develop an approximation to
the matrix element for these processes which was later supplemented with the
finite correction which remained after cancelling the real and virtual divergences:
|MHEqgZqg|
(eqn. (4.4)) or |MHEqQZqQ|
(eqn. (4.9)). The approximation is
necessary to allow us to describe the matrix element for any (and in particular,
large) n and for including both the leading real and virtual corrections. However,
if the parton momenta cluster into four or fewer jets (these may have arisen
from many more partons), the full tree-level matrix element remains calculable.
In these cases, we perform the matching multiplicatively, so we multiply the
integrand of eqn. (4.43) by the ratio:
4.5. The Differential Z/ Cross-Section
|MfullqQZ/q(k2)gQ(pa, pb, {j
i})|2/|MHEJqQZ/q(k2)gQ(pa, pb, {j
i})|2. (4.44)
Here, {ji} are the jet momenta after a small amount of reshuffling. This is
necessary because the evaluation of the tree-level matrix elements assumes that
the jet momenta are both on-shell and have transverse momenta which sum to
zero, neither of which is true in general for our events due to the presence of
extra emissions. Our reshuffling algorithm [21] redistributes this extra transverse
momentum in proportion to the size of the transverse momentum of each jet. The
plus and minus light-cone components are then adjusted such that the jet is put
on-shell and the rapidity remains unaltered. This last feature ensures that after
reshuffling the event is still in an FKL configuration.
2. Matching for non-FKL configurations:
Away from regions in phase space where the quarks and gluons are well-separated,
the non-FKL configurations will play a more significant role. These have so far
not been accounted for at all, and hence we add three exclusive samples of leading-
order two-jet, three-jet and four-jet leading-order events to our resummed events.
These two matching schemes complete our description of the production of Z/ with
at least two jets, including the leading high-energy logarithms at all orders in s.
Tabs (4.2) and (4.3) show the effect of the matching to leading order on the total cross
sections of various FKL configurations for 2 and 3-4 jet processes respectively. We
see that although the resummation-only result often gives a good approximation to the
exact leading order result it sometimes differs but that this difference is corrected for by
our matching. Tab. (4.4) shows the total cross sections generated by HEJ for 2-, 3- and
4-jet processes which contain non-FKL configurations. Once again we see that after
the inclusion of the extra exclusive sums we are in good agreement with the leading
order result.
In the next sections, we discuss the computational aspects of the work presented here
and compare the resulting predictions from this formalism to LHC data from recent
ATLAS and CMS analyses.

4.6 Z/+Jets: Computational Aspects
The physics presented in the preceding sections is a significant departure from work
previously done by the High Energy Jets collaboration. As such developing the Monte
Carlo for Z/ plus jets was a serious undertaking; the inclusion of the aforementioned
interference terms required that two t-channel chains of momenta and vertices be
computed and carried throughout the evaluation. Furthermore to correctly calculate
at the amplitude level the way the High Energy Jets currents are constructed in the
codebase needed to be modified. Since the virtual corrections are scale dependent it
was necessary to change large sections of code to work with multiple copies of t-chains
and multiple scales.
In previous HEJ releases the matching mentioned above was performed using MadGraph
version 4. However, due to increases in speed and efficiency we chose to match the
Z/+jets HEJ matrix elements to MadGraph aMC@NLO version 5. While this might
seem like a trivial change the underlying computational work was anything but simple;
since the latest version of MadGraph outputs matrix elements in C++ (as well as

Fortran 90) a completely new approach to incorporating matching was required. A
novel abstract factory design pattern was employed to efficiently construct and call
the relevant leading order matrix element. In this way we avoided the necessity of
having extremely large matching files containing O(18, 000) lines of code which was
very difficult to debug and improve; instead this new structure allowed the matching
code to be reduced to only a few thousand lines since the abstract factory class
presents a uniform interface and therefore almost all of the process specific lines became
unnecessary (some process specific content remains due to the distinction made between
FKL and non-FKL configurations).
Throughout the course of this work it became apparent that the High Energy Jets
codebase, as it was at the time, needed to be restructured. Each physics process (pure
jets, W+jets, Higgs+jets and Z/+jets) was structured individually as a stand-alone
piece of code. This became a problem when testing and modifying HEJ since there are
large sections of code which are the same regardless of what electroweak boson emission
(if any) we are concerned with, for example the parton distribution function calls are
almost entirely the same no matter which code is run. To improve upon this situation
a unified HEJ package was created. This was a complete restructuring of the code into
a form in which a general HejGen polymorphic base class can be constructed abstractly
and then made concrete depending on user input. The unified version of the code is
an improvement in that it is much more user friendly, and significantly easier to test
and extend. This work entailed being one of the primary authors of the new design for
High Energy Jets and will soon be released as HEJ (v2).
Lastly a word about the generation of High Energy Jets predictions for comparisons
to data. The sections and chapters which follow contain theoretical predictions to
experimental analyses. These predictions were generated using distributed computing

both locally in Edinburgh and using the CERN GRID system. The former required
the development of a set-up to distribute, execute and finalise jobs across a large
network of machines standard desktop machines (i.e. not actual computing nodes)
distributed through Edinburgh University. This was a time-consuming process however
without this system it would not have been possible to produce the interesting results of
chapter 5 (which also contains a discussion of the computational challenges of generating
HEJ+ARIADNE predictions). The GRID distributed computing work was available only
in the final stages of this work because it became clear it was necessary (had it been
available sooner the aforementioned local distributed computing set-up could have been
avoided completely). This involved a good deal of learning to work with distributed
systems and working with the Ganga batch submission system which was, again, time-
consuming.

4.7.1 Z/+Jets at the ATLAS Experiment
We now compare the results of the formalism described in the previous sections to data.
We begin with a recent ATLAS analysis of Z0-plus-jets events from 7 TeV collisions [2].
We summarise the cuts in tab. (4.5).
Lepton Cuts pT` > 20 GeV, |`| < 2.5
+` > 0.2, 66 GeV  m`+`  116 GeV
Jet Cuts (anti-kT , 0.4) pTj > 30 GeV, |yj | < 4.4
Rj` > 0.5
Table 4.5: Cuts applied to theory simulations in the ATLAS Z0-plus-jets analysis
results shown in Figs. (4.10)(4.13).
Any jet which failed the final isolation cut was removed from the event, but the event
itself is kept provided there are a sufficient number of other jets present. Throughout
the central value of the HEJ predictions has been calculated with factorisation and
renormalisation scales set to F = R = HT /2, and the theoretical uncertainty band
has been determined by varying these independently by up to a factor of 2 in each
direction (removing the corners where the relative ratio is greater than two). Also shown
in the plots taken from the ATLAS paper are theory predictions from Alpgen [64],
Sherpa [51, 55], MC@NLO [49] and BlackHat+Sherpa [26, 57]. We will also comment on
the recent theory description of Ref. [46] .
In Fig. (4.10), we begin this set of comparisons with predictions and measurements of
the inclusive jet rates. HEJ and most of the other theory descriptions give a reasonable
description of these rates. The MC@NLO prediction drops below the data because it only
contains the hard-scattering matrix element for Z/ production and relies on a parton
shower for additional emissions. The HEJ predictions have a larger uncertainty band
which largely arises from the use of leading-order results in the matching procedures.
The effect of normalising our predictions (taking scale variations into account both in
the numerator and denominator) on the size of our scale uncertainty bands is discussed
later in this section.
The first differential distribution we consider here is the distribution of the invariant
mass between the two hardest jets, Fig. (4.11). The region of large invariant mass
is particularly important because this is a critical region for studies of vector boson
fusion (VBF) processes in Higgs-plus-dijets. Radiation patterns are largely universal
between these processes, so one can test the quality of theoretical descriptions in Z/-
4.7. Z/+Jets at the LHC
plus-dijets and use these to inform the VBF analyses. It is also a distribution which
will be studied to try to detect subtle signs of new physics. In this study, HEJ and
the other theory descriptions all give a good description of this variable out to 1 TeV,
with HEJ being closest throughout the range. The merged sample of Ref. [46] (Fig. 9
in that paper) combined with the Pythia8 parton shower performs reasonably well
throughout the range with a few deviations of more than 20%, while that combined
with Herwig++ deviates badly. Fig. (3.8) shows the equivalent distribution from a
recent ATLAS analysis of W+dijet events [5], that distribution was extended out to
an invariant mass of 2 TeV and, as discussed in section 3.9, almost all of the theoretical
predictions deviated significantly while the HEJ prediction remained flat. This is one
region where the high-energy logarithms which are only included in HEJ are expected
to become large.
In Fig. (4.12), we show the comparison of various theoretical predictions to the
distribution of the absolute rapidity difference between the two leading jets. It is
clear in the left plot that HEJ gives an excellent description of this distribution. This
is to some extent expected as high-energy logarithms are associated with rapidity
separations. However, this variable is only the rapidity separation between the two
hardest jets which is often not representative of the event as harder jets tend to be
more central. Nonetheless, the HEJ description performs well in this restricted scenario.
The next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation of Blackhat+Sherpa also describes the
distribution quite well while the other merged, fixed-order samples deviate from the
data at larger values. The merged samples of Ref. [46] (Fig. 8 in that paper) describe
this distribution well for small values of this variable up to about 3 units when combined
with Herwig++ and for most of the range when combined with the Pythia8 parton
shower, only deviating above 5 units.
The final distribution in this section is that of the ratio of the transverse momentum of
the second hardest jet to the hardest jet. The perturbative description of HEJ does not
contain any systematic evolution of transverse momentum and this can be seen where
its prediction undershoots the data at low values of pT2/pT1. However, for values of
pT2 & 0.5pT1, the ratio of the HEJ prediction to data is extremely close to 1. The
fixed-order based predictions shown in Fig. (4.10) are all fairly flat above about 0.2,
but the ratio of the data differs by about 10%.
We have seen that in all of the figures presented in this section HEJ has scale uncertainty
bands significantly larger than other theoretical descriptions, including Alpgen who
also have only leading order accuracy. From fig. (4.10) we see that we describe the
experimentally observed inclusive two jet rate very well and, as such, do not require
4.7. Z/+Jets at the LHC
normalisation to agree with the data. However, applying a normalisation procedure
which consistently applies scale variation simultaneously in numerator and denominator
significantly reduces the size of the scale uncertainty bands for High Energy Jets (or
any theoretical prediction). In figs. (4.14a), (4.14b) and (4.14c) we show the normalised
results from figs. (4.13a), (4.12a) and (4.11a). We see that, as expected, the central
value of HEJ still describes the data well in the regions discussed above and now the size
of the theoretical uncertainty band is significantly reduced (for example a reduction of
approximately a factor of 250 is seen in the last bin of the p2/p1-distribution). This
illustrates that varying R and F leads to a change in overall normalisation but not to
any significant change in shape. Therefore, it is still valuable to discuss the quality of
agreement of the central line, despite their apparently large accompanying uncertainty
bands.

Figure 2. (a) Measured cross section for Z ( ``) + jets as a function of the inclusive jet multiplicity,
Njet, and (b) ratio of cross sections for successive inclusive jet multiplicities. The data are compared
to NLO pQCD predictions from BlackHat+SHERPA corrected to the particle level, and the
ALPGEN, SHERPA and MC@NLO event generators (see legend for details). The error bars indicate
the statistical uncertainty on the data, and the hatched (shaded) bands the statistical and systematic
uncertainties on data (prediction) added in quadrature.
Figure 3(b) presents the exclusive jet multiplicity ratio for events where the leading
jet has a transverse momentum in excess of 150 GeV. The observed ratio R(n+1)/n is now
steeply increasing towards low jet multiplicities, a pattern described by the central values of
the BlackHat+SHERPA calculations, by the generator ALPGEN and approximately also
by SHERPA. The observed cross-section ratios have been fitted with a pattern expected
from a Poisson-distributed jet multiplicity with the expectation value n, R(n+1)/n =
. The
Poisson scaling provides a good overall description of the jet multiplicity observed in data
for the selected kinematic regime, with n = 1.02  0.04, where the uncertainty includes
statistical and systematic components.
The scaling pattern is also investigated for a preselection typically employed in the
selection of particles produced via vector boson fusion (VBF). Figure 4 presents the absolute
cross section as a function of the exclusive jet multiplicity and R(n+1)/n after requiring two
jets with mjj > 350 GeV and |yjj | > 3.0, in the following referred to as VBF preselection.
The data are consistent with the BlackHat+SHERPA prediction. SHERPA describes the
multiplicity well whereas ALPGEN overestimates R3/2.

Cross sections as a function of the inclusive and exclusive jet multiplicities and their

been extended to regimes with larger jet multiplicities and larger jet transverse momenta.
In addition, the sample has been compared to theory in specific kinematic regions governed
by large logarithmic corrections.
In general, the predictions of the matrix element plus parton shower generators and
the fixed-order calculations are consistent with the measured values over a large kinematic
range. MC@NLO fails to model not only higher jet multiplicities but also the transverse
momentum of the leading jet. The transition from staircase to Poisson scaling of the exclu-

is observed in the data.

the fixed-order calculations are consistent with the measured values over a large kinematic
range. MC@NLO fails to model not only higher jet multiplicities but also the transverse
momentum of the leading jet. The transition from staircase to Poisson scaling of the exclu-
sive jet multiplicity ratio, expected from theory when introducing a large scale difference,
is observed in the data.
In events where two jets have passed a VBF preselection, the cross sections for higher

ALPGEN and by BlackHat+SHERPA. The tendencies observed in the modelling of the
distance in  and in rapidity are reflected in the measurement of the R spectrum of the
leading jets. SHERPA models a too flat spectrum for both  and R. The offset of
15% of the SHERPA prediction from the observed cross section in the bulk of the data in
figures 11 and 12 is consistent with the results presented in figure 2(a) for the inclusive
Z ( ``) +  2 jets cross section.

A veto on a third jet is used to reject Z + jets background in selections of Higgs boson
candidates produced by VBF. Figure 13 shows the transverse momentum and rapidity dis-
tributions of the third jet after the VBF preselection, as defined in section 10.1, normalized
to the inclusive Z ( ``) cross section. The predictions by BlackHat+SHERPA, ALP-
GEN and SHERPA are consistent with the measurements. Figure 14 shows the fraction of
events which have fulfilled the requirements of a VBF preselection that pass in addition a
veto on a third jet in the central region (|| < 2.4) as a function of the minimum trans-

4.7.2 The W+Jets to Z/+Jets Ratio at the ATLAS Experiment
In this section we present predictions for the ratio of Z/+Jets to W+Jets at
all orders in s. We compare to the recent study undertaken by the ATLAS
collaboration [3]. While W plus jets and Z/ plus jets are both relevant separately
for Standard Model physics and beyond the ratio of the two processes is particularly
interesting as a precision test since many of the systematic errors which limit the
W, Z/-plus-jets measurements cancel in the ratio. The cuts for both final states
are summarised in tab. (4.6).

4.7.3 Z/+Jets at the CMS Experiment
We now compare to data from a CMS analysis of events with a Z/ boson
produced in association with jets [59]. We show, for comparison, the plots from that
analysis which contain theoretical predictions from Sherpa [51, 55], Powheg [10] and
MadGraph aMC@NLO [12].The cuts used for this analysis are summarised in tab. (4.9).

Rj` > 0.5
Table 4.9: Cuts applied to theory simulations in the CMS Z0-plus-jets analysis results
shown in Figs. (4.15)(4.17)
As in the previous section, any jet which failed the final isolation cut was removed from
the event, but the event itself is kept provided there are a sufficient number of other jets
present. The main difference to these cuts and those of ATLAS in the previous section
is that the jets are required to be more central; || < 2.4 as opposed to |y| < 4.4. This
allows less room for evolution in rapidity; however, HEJ predictions are still relevant
in this scenario. Once again, the central values are given by F = R = HT /2 with
theoretical uncertainty bands determined by varying these independently by factors of
two around this value. HEJ events always contain a minimum of two jets and therefore
here we only compare to the distributions for an event sample with at least two jets or
above.
We begin in Fig. (4.15) by showing the inclusive jet rates for these cuts. The HEJ
predictions give a good description, especially for the 2- and 3-jet inclusive rates in this
narrower phase space. The uncertainty bands are larger for HEJ than for the Sherpa and
Powheg predictions due to our LO matching prescription (those for MadGraph aMC@NLO
are not shown).
In Figs. (4.16) (4.17), we show the transverse momentum distributions for the second
and third jet respectively (the leading jet distribution was not given for inclusive dijet
events). Beginning with the second jet in Fig. (4.16), we see that the HEJ predictions
overshoot the data at large transverse momentum. In this region, the non-FKL matched
components of the HEJ description become more important and these are not controlled
by the high-energy resummation. The HEJ predictions are broadly similar to Powhegs
Z0-plus-one-jet NLO calculation matched with the Pythia parton shower. In contrast,
Sherpas prediction significantly undershoots the data at large transverse momentum.
Here the MadGraph aMC@NLO prediction gives the best description of the data.
Fig. (4.17) shows the transverse momentum distribution of the third jet in this data
sample. Here, the ratio of the HEJ prediction to data shows a linear increase with
transverse momentum (until the last bin where all the theory predictions show the
same dip). Both the Sherpa and Powheg predictions show similar deviations for this
variable while the MadGraph aMC@NLO prediction again performs very well.

4.7.4 Differential Drell-Yan at the CMS Experiment
Throughout the course of this work many analyses were used to compare High Energy
Jets to experimental data. Though we usually only take part in studies illuminating
for a discussion of higher order logarithmic corrections of QCD processes at hadronic
colliders the CMS collaboration asked that I contribute numbers (on behalf of the High
Energy Jets collaboration) to a study of double-differential Drell-Yan at the LHC [38].
In particular, we consider the Drell-Yan cross-section differential in both the pseudo-
rapidity gap between the reconstructed Z/ boson and the leading jet in p and
in the invariant mass of the di-lepton decay products. This is not a region of phase
space where resummation is expected to reign supreme and we therefore anticipate that
the effect of matching our High Energy Jets amplitudes to exact leading order results
obtained using MadGraph aMC@NLO will be significant.
The study focussed on 0-, 1- and 2-jet events in addition to a di-muon pair; since we
can only describe final states with at least two jets we only consider the later final state.
The final state cuts applied in this analysis are shown in tab. (4.10).

Lepton Cuts p1 > 20 GeV, p2 > 10 GeV,
|| < 2.1, |Z/ | < 2.5
Jet Cuts (anti-kT , 0.5) pTj > 30 GeV, |j | < 4.5
Table 4.10: Cuts applied to theory simulations in the CMS Drell-Yan analysis results
shown in Figs. (4.18a)(4.18e)
Fig. (4.18a) shows the distribution in the absolute rapidity gap between the recon-
structed Z/ and the leading jet in p for a reconstructed di-muon mass in the Z
peak range (defined as 60-120 GeV). We see that both the leading order exact and
HEJ give a good description of data in this range. Figs. (4.18c) and (4.18e) show the
same distribution but for a reconstructed Z/ mass of between 30-60 GeV and 120-
1500 GeV respectively. Here we see that both MadGraph aMC@NLO and HEJ give a poor
description of the data but agree well with one another. This is exactly because the HEJ
predictions are being driven by the leading order matching in the regions considered.
This is a good consistency check of both the High Energy Jets matching scheme and
the implementation of the importance sampling in HEJ.
In HEJ the production of the Drell-Yan decay products via a Z0 boson or an off-shell
photon is implemented by using exactly the importance sampling scheme shown in
chapter 2, eqn. (2.91) and fig. (2.7) - that is we focus our matrix element evaluations
predominantly around the Z0 mass peak. Fig. (4.18b) was generated using the standard
importance sampling (which is not designed for this range of invariant masses) while
fig. (4.18c) was generated using a modified importance sampling approach which was
better suited for probing the low mass end of the Breit-Wigner distribution. Clearly
using an intelligently chosen importance sampling scheme makes a big difference to the
results - since, although the integrals are formally equal, when we come to perform the
Monte Carlo integration we must use what computational resources we have to focus
on the regions which contribute most to the integral. Figs. (4.18d) and (4.18e) show the
same distribution now for an invariant mass of between 120 and 1500 GeV, once again
fig. (4.18d) was calculated with the default importance sampling whereas fig. (4.18e)
used a modified scheme: the same behaviour can be seen with the default sampling
describing the data poorly and being statistically limited.

4.8 Z/+Jets Conclusions
In this chapter we have discussed augmenting the theoretical description of inclusive
Z/-plus-dijets processes with the dominant logarithms in the High Energy limit at
all orders in s. In particular, the description constructed here is accurate to leading
logarithm in s/t. This is achieved within the High Energy Jets framework. We began
in chapter 3 by motivating and describing the construction of an approximation to
the hard-scattering matrix element for an arbitrary number of gluons in the final
state. This uses factorised currents for electroweak boson emission and outer jet
production combined with a series of (gauge-invariant) effective vertices for extra QCD
real emissions.
In contrast to previous HEJ constructions (for pure jets, W -plus-jets and Higgs boson-
plus-jets), the complete description of the interference contributions between Z and 
processes and between forward and backward emissions required a new regularisation
procedure. This is described in section 4.3 where we showed explicitly the cancellation
of real and virtual divergences by using the Lipatov ansatz to include the dominant
contributions in the High Energy limit of the all-order virtual contributions. The
method by which we match our matrix element to the leading order matrix elements
was also outlined here. In this way we achieve the formal accuracy of our Monte Carlo
predictions to Leading Logarithmic in s/t and merge Leading Order predictions in s
for the production of two, three or four jets.
In sections 4.7.1 and 4.7.3 we compared the predictions of our construction to Z/-
plus-jets data collected at the ATLAS and CMS experiments during Run I. We see
excellent agreement for a wide range of observables and can be seen to describe regions
of phase space well where some other fixed-order-based predictions do not fare as well.
Discrepancies between HEJ and data which occur only do so in regions where we do
not expect this description to perform as well, for example where there is a large
ratio between pT1 and pT2. We also discuss properties of other available theoretical
descriptions.
This all-order description of Z/-plus-dijets allows predictions for the ratio of
W+dijets to Z/+dijets at all-orders in s for the first time. This is an extremely
important analysis as many theoretical and experimental uncertainties cancel in this
ratio and in section 4.7.2, we show that we correctly reproduce the ratios of the total
cross sections.
Just as for previous analyses of LHC data, it is found that the high-energy logarithms
contained in HEJ are necessary for a satisfactory description of data in key regions of
4.8. Z/+Jets Conclusions
phases space, e.g. at large values of jet invariant mass. Such regions of phase space
are crucial for the analysis of Higgs boson production in association with dijets for
example. The impact of the high-energy logarithms will only be more pronounced at
the larger centre-of-mass energy of LHC Run II, and beyond at a possible future circular
collider. The HEJ framework and Monte Carlo is the unique flexible event generator
to contain these corrections and will provide important theoretical input for the study
of important processes at LHC Run II and beyond.
Chapter 5
Dijets and Gap Jets at ATLAS
Here we present the results of a complex experimental study of the effects of jet vetoes
and azimuthal decorrelations in dijet events [4]. High Energy Jets is compared to both
data and state-of-the-art fixed-order perturbative QCD predictions supplemented with
radiation by merging with a parton shower from POWHEG+PYTHIA8 and POWHEG+HERWIG
(both implemented through the POWHEG BOX package [66]).
The data are taken from 7 TeV proton-proton collisions as observed by the ATLAS
experiment in two distinct data sets referred to as 2010 data and 2011 data. The
experimental cuts applied to these data sets differs and both are outlined in tab. (5.1).
2010 Jets (anti-kT , 0.6) pTj > 20 GeV, |yj | < 4.4
pT1 > 60.0 GeV, pT2 > 50.0 GeV,
Q0 = 20 GeV
2011 Jets (anti-kT , 0.6) pTj > 30 GeV, |yj | < 2.4
pT1 > 60.0 GeV, pT2 > 50.0 GeV
Q0 = 30 GeV, yjj > 1.0
Table 5.1: Cuts applied to theory simulations in the ATLAS dijets analyses. Q0 is the
gap jet veto scale. The results are shown in figs. (5.1)(5.6).
This study focused on additional jet activity in dijet events where the dijet system
is constructed using the two leading jets in pT - this, is in stark contrast to defining
dijets by the most forward and most backward jets: naturally the p choice favours
high transverse momentum dijets in the central region (and hence with relatively small
rapidity gaps) while the forward-backward dijet system definition typically lead to softer
systems with bigger rapidity spans [7]. These two jets are required to be significantly
harder than any additional jets with extra cuts on the leading and sub-leading jets
of 60 GeV and 50 GeV respectively. After tagging the two leading jets in the event
and additional jet radiation is only considered in the rapidity interval bounded by the
dijets as a QCD correction. Within the two data sets defined in tab. (5.1) a further
subdivision was made. For both the 2010 and 2011 data a subset of events was defined
by vetoing events with extra QCD radiation in the rapidity interval bounded by the
dijet system above some veto scale Q0. It should also be noted that the 2011 data set
required a minimum rapidity gap of 1.0 between the leading jets (for both cases with
and without the gap jet veto) in order to encourage a large rapidity span into which
extra radiation may arise. In summary, the full breakdown of this analysis then is into
four event categories; 2010 data with and without a veto applied to gap jets and the
2011 data with and without a veto applied to gap jets.
I generated the predictions for these analyses on behalf of the High Energy Jets
collaboration at the request of the ATLAS collaboration. Predictions for both the
partonic HEJ calculation (shown in green in this chapter) and the HEJ+ARIADNE
calculation (shown in orange) were calculated. As discussed in chapter 3 ARIADNE
is a parton shower package based on the Lund colour cascade dipole model. As per the
algorithm outlined in section 3.9, the steps necessary to remove the double counting
in this interfaced package (which arises from HEJ and ARIADNE both generating soft
radiation) make generating large data samples which can be used to give statistically
significant predictions for the challenging regions of phase space considered here is
extremely computationally demanding. The generation of these predictions was so
demanding several changes were made to the HEJ codebase; the size of event files
generated meant that the analysis framework for High Energy Jets required rewriting
so that binning to histograms could occur on-the-fly. As discussed in section 4.6, this
analysis was initially run using local computing resources however it quickly became
apparent that this would not be sufficient, at which point it was necessary to switch
to running HEJ on the CERN grid computing cluster - this was the first time this was
done.
A central scale was chosen based on previously agreement with data seen in a previous
ATLAS comparison to gap jets [1]; this set of 19 scale combination form an envelope of
predictions for each bin in each plot - this spread is then represented by the green bands
shown in the figs. (5.1)(5.6). Due to the structure of the matrix element evaluations
within HEJ+ARIADNE we can only afford one scale choice per event and, as such, we
cannot provide scale variation uncertainty bands with our showered numbers. To be
clear this is not a limitation of the physics since it is entirely possible to evaluate each
matrix element multiple times - it is only a computational consideration. As seen in
chapter 4, the renormalisation scale appears in a non-trivial way in the High Energy
Jets matrix element. It is contained implicitly in the strong coupling constant which is
contained within the virtual corrections exponential. As such we cannot simply generate
predictions at a single scale and then re-weight events at the post-analysis level. This
is further complicated in HEJ+ARIADNE because of the additional scale dependencies in
the parton shower description.
The orange bands shown with the HEJ+ARIADNE predictions throughout this chapter
are the statistical bands shown at the 68% confidence level. The calculation of these
statistical bands had to be completed manually - that is to say, not using the out-of-
the-box result provided by ROOT since many of the individual distributions required
calculating ratios of distributions for which the statistical errors in the numerator and
denominator are highly correlated. It was seen that the nave statistical uncertainty
bands were not representative of the actual uncertainty. The bands presented were
calculated using a statistical bootstrapping approach: given a Monte Carlo sample
comprising N events we repeatedly form bootstrap samples each of which also with N
events by randomly selecting subsets of the full sample (allowing for repetition). Once
a sufficient number of these have been generated we have a distribution of results for
each bin in each histogram and we can easily form a statistical uncertainty band which
contains 68% of the bootstrapped samples in each bin.
Here observables were studied as a function of two properties of a dijet system. The
rapidity gap between the dijets, y, and the mean traverse momenta of the dijet
system, pT . For small y we expect to see fewer gap jets since there is a limited region
in which extra jets may be clustered before they are clustered in to the dijet system
itself. Conversely, as we pull the dijets apart in rapidity we expect to see an increase
in additional QCD radiation (since there is a larger phase space in which to radiate).
Similarly for pT , we expect that events with harder dijet systems will have higher gap
activity simply because they can cheaply add extra radiation.
Throughout the remainder of this chapter the left hand figures, (a), show data and
predictions for the 2010 data set with respect to the rapidity span of the dijet system,
y, while the right hand figures, (b), show data and predictions from the 2011 data set
with respect to the mean transverse momenta of the dijet system, pT , with a rapidity
gap enforced.
We begin by discussing the gap fraction, f(Q0), defined as:
f(Q0) =
jj(Q0)
, (5.1)
where jj is the total dijet cross section passing the cuts in tab. (5.1) and jj(Q0) is
the dijet cross section passing the cuts plus the extra veto on additional gap scales for
a scale choice Q0.
Fig. (5.1) shows the gap fraction with a veto scale of 20 GeV in fig. (5.1a) and a
veto scale of 30 GeV in fig. (5.1b). The data are shown in black with the inner bars
representing the statistical uncertainty while the outer lines are the total uncertainty
arising from statistical and systematic effects. The behaviour observed is in line with
our expectation discussed previously since the gap fraction decreases at both large y
and large pT . We can see the best description of both data sets is given by HEJ+ARIADNE
(excluding two very high pT bins where the predictions from HEJ+ARIADNE are visibly
statistically limited). The partonic HEJ prediction overshoots both data sets meaning
that we underestimate the jet activity in the gap region while the predictions from
POWHEG plus parton showers overestimate the QCD radiation here. The big difference
between the partonic and showered HEJ lines in fig. (5.1) indicates clearly that in this
region of phase space it is not sufficient to only describe the wide-angle logarithmically
enhanced terms resummed within the High Energy Jets framework and that the soft and
collinear logarithms added by interfacing to ARIADNE play a very important role - equally
it is clear from the differences between HEJ and the other theory descriptions that we
cannot completely describe data without resumming the High Energy logarithms. It
is visible from fig. (5.1) that the scale variations shown in partonic HEJ (since the
HEJ+ARIADNE bands are statistical only) are quite significantly bigger than that shown
by the other predictions. This is expected since we only include matching up to leading-
order whereas POWHEG is formally NLO accurate. In pure fixed-order calculations it is
well observed that as higher order terms are included a better control of the scale
uncertainties is achieved.
Similarly, when we study the mean number of jets in the rapidity interval shown for
in fig. (5.2) we see that HEJ+ARIADNE and POWHEG+PYTHIA8 give the best description
of the data. Once again the partonic HEJ prediction undershoots the data significantly
when describing both of the dijet characteristics while POWHEG+HERWIG overestimates
the jet activity.
We now turn to look at the azimuthal decorrelations of dijet systems. These are defined
as cos(n( )) with n = 1, 2, . . . and  is the azimuthal separation between the
leading dijets. Here we only consider the first and second moments. We follow the
notation of [4] and rewrite the second moment as cos(2). Clearly for a final state
with two partons momentum conservation will enforce that the jets be in a back-to-
back configuration i.e. they will have  =  and both cos( ) and cos(2)
will simply be constant at 1.0. As additional partons are emitted the moments will

depart from the straight line as the constraint softens and the extra radiation allows
for  < . These moments have long been seen as an excellent test of the difference
between DGLAP QCD parton showers and BFKL-like resummations [42]. Indeed it is
in these figures where we see the biggest difference between HEJ and the POWHEG plus
parton shower results.
Fig. (5.3) shows the first azimuthal moment for the inclusive selection. We see that
in the 2010 study HEJ+ARIADNE and both POWHEG descriptions slightly underestimate
cos(  ) while the partonic HEJ result slightly overestimates. However, the
evolution of the first azimuthal moment with respect to pT shows a clear difference
between the two formalisms. Partonic HEJ does not radiate sufficiently to predict the
correct decorrelation at low mean transverse momentum (which is understood since it
does not include the parton shower effects) while both POWHEG descriptions cause too
much decorrelation at low pT . The best description of the data is given by HEJ+ARIADNE
since it adds extra emissions to High Energy Jets which improves our description of the
decorrelation. Once again it is clear that the low p region of fig. (5.3) is extremely
sensitive to shower effects - not only because there is a large difference between HEJ and
HEJ+ARIADNE but also because the two POWHEG plus shower results differ significantly.
Another variable thought to be a good test of DGLAP vs. BFKL physics is the ratio
of the second moment to the first moment, this is shown in fig. (5.4). Once again we do
see a sizeable difference in the predictions given by the two resummations. Similarly

to fig. (5.3) we see that interfacing to the ARIADNE package brings the partonic HEJ
prediction into much better agreement with the data and that the parton showers alone
does not give a good description of data. We remark on the similarity of the POWHEG
prediction that that of HEJ+ARIADNE here, given the stark contrast of the underlying
physics in these two descriptions it is not at all expected. This similarity has also been
observed in previous studies and has been discussed in [9].
The two remaining figures are similar to figs. (5.3) and (5.4) but with the addition of
the jet veto applied to events. Similarly to the inclusive case we see that the partonic
HEJ predictions overestimates the correlation for the 2010 and the 2011 data sets while
the NLO plus shower predictions, once again, undershoot the decorrelation. Given the
statistical limited data available (especially for the 2010 gap jet vetoed data set) it is
more difficult to draw clear conclusions here but certainly the inclusion of the ARIADNE
shower improves the High Energy Jets results.
Lastly we have the ratio of the second azimuthal moment to the first azimuthal moment
for the events which pass the additional jet veto. HEJ+ARIADNE and POWHEG+PYTHIA8
come closest to describing the data however there is some disagreement; in particular
no one gives a good description of the evolution of this ratio at low pT .
In summary, the best description of the data overall is given by HEJ+ARIADNE and
POWHEG+PYTHIA8 while parton level HEJ overestimates (underestimate) the gap fraction

(the mean number of jets in the rapidity gap) and overshoots both the first azimuthal
moment and the ratio of the second to the first azimuthal moment. POWHEG+HERWIG
describes the data poorly for the gap fraction, the mean number of gap jets and the
azimuthal decorrelations. From this it is clear that while the logarithmically enhanced
resummed in the High Energy Jets framework are important in regions of phase space
where we have large rapidity gaps (such as the analyses described here) there are equally
important contributions arising from the logarithms given to us by the interface with
a parton shower. It is clear that no one package describes all of the data presented
and therefore the LHC is probing challenging reasons of phase space and thus more
attention is needed. This study also strongly motivates further development of High
Energy Jets with other parton shower descriptions.

growing effort to discuss where we go next as a high energy collider physics community.
A wide range of options have been put forward including the Compact Linear Collider
(CLIC) experiment [8] and the International Linear Collider (ILC) experiment [30].
While both of these machines are designed to be precision electron-positron linear
colliders they have very different designs; CLIC would operate at around a centre-of-
mass energy of 3 TeV and use cutting edge accelerating technology whereas the ILC
would collide at 0.5 TeV (with a possible upgrade to 1 TeV to follow).
There are, however, other suggestions on the table. Of particular interest for this
work is the prospect of a hadronic Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh). There are other
possible initial states such as hadron-lepton or a lepton-lepton being discussed but we
will focus on the FCC-hh here since the resummation developed in chapters 3 and 4 is
most relevant here.
One particularly exciting scenario is that of a 100 TeV hadronic collider housed in an
extended tunnel approximately 100 km in circumference at the CERN site in Geneva.
Such a machine would make an excellent discovery machine since it would cover a
vast range in partonic centre-of-mass energies. The energies probed here would be
orders of magnitude higher than ever seen at a hadronic collider and so this would
be an invaluable test of high scale QCD. Similarly to physics at the current LHC the
dominant background would be QCD in nature and so in order for us to be able to
extract useful information about potential new physics we would need to be able to
model this QCD background with incredible precision. Current state-of-the-art for
many QCD processes is still limited to next-to-leading order in s although progress
is being made towards improving this to next-to-next-to-leading order in some key
physics processes. For example, Higgs production via gluon fusion is already known at
N3LO [14]. However, as in the preceding chapters we will instead investigate the effects
of the higher-order logarithmically enhanced contributions to the perturbative series.
As discussed in chapter 2 these terms are not all captured by any fixed-order scheme
The results of chapters 4 and 5 clearly show that these effects are already important at
a the 7 TeV for both dijets and Z/+dijets respectively. We therefore expect that at
a 100 TeV FCC-hh we would see a greater effect from the terms enhanced in the High
Energy limit.
Here we present a study of Z/+dijets at a centre-of-mass energy of 100 TeV. The
final state cuts are outlined in tab. (6.1). For each figure we show the equivalent result
calculated at 7 TeV with a jet pT cut of 30 GeV (which was found to be in excellent
agreement with data in chapter 4) as well as the 100 TeV predictions for jet cuts of
30 GeV, 60 GeV and 100 GeV. The choice of jet cut is an interesting problem since it
the best variable for weeding out physics other than the hard perturbative scatter. For
example, even at the 7 TeV LHC a QCD study with a jet cut of, say, 10 GeV would be
a test of multiple parton interactions and underlying event and not so much of a test of
the hard scatter. While this is a perfectly valid analysis to do it is not the best choice
if our aim is to test and improve our understanding of perturbative QCD. The same
argument applies for a 100 TeV collider only more so As we go to increasingly higher
centre-of-mass energies we need to raise our jet cuts so as to ensure the data we hope
to describe is as unpolluted as possible. We may also need to narrow our jet radius to
keep the jet multiplicities to an experimentally manageable level. Each figure shows
the ratio of the 100 TeV prediction to the 7 TeV prediction to emphasise any features
which may otherwise be hard to see - such as changes in shape at difference energies
and with different cut criteria. The 7 TeV results are shown in
Lepton Cuts pT` > 20 GeV, |`| < 2.5

Table 6.1: Cuts applied to theory simulations for the 100 TeV Z-plus-jets analysis
results shown in Figs. (6.1a)(6.4c). We apply only one jet cut of 30 GeV to the jets in
the 7 TeV analysis, shown in purple in the figures, but separately study the 100 TeV
jets with cuts of 30 GeV, 60 GeV and 100 GeV shown in the figures in red, green and
blue respectively.
We begin by discussing what is by far the most uninteresting figure in this thesis (at
least at first glance); fig. (6.1a) shows the differential distribution in the azimuthal
separation of the two leading jets in pT , j1,j2. It is clear that although the cross-
section of the 100 TeV study with 100 GeV jets is significantly greater than that of the
7 TeV result the increase in cross-section is uniform throughout the range of j1,j2
- this is clear from the ratio. What makes the uninteresting fig. (6.1a) so interesting
is that if QCD behaved exactly the same at 100 TeV as it did at 7 TeV we would
expect all of the plots in this chapter to have a ratio line which was a perfectly straight
line which would merely reflect the increase in cross-section we would expect to see.
However, this turns out not to be the case. We can also see that as we increase the
minimum p requirements in the 100 TeV study we see the cross-section decreases, as
we would expect it to do, and we induce a more interesting behaviour in the ratio of
the predictions to the 7 TeV line. This can be easily understood since as we force the
jets to higher values of transverse momenta the back-to-back topology becomes more
favourable and hence more of the total cross-section is found at |j1,j2|  .

Figure 6.1: Fig. (6.1a) - The differential cross-section for Z/ plus inclusive dijets as a
function of the azimuthal separation of the dijet system. Fig. (6.1b) - The cross-section
for Z/ plus inclusive dijets as a function of the number of jets, Njet.
Fig. (6.1b) shows the breakdown of the Z/+dijets cross-section in terms of the
inclusive number of jets, Njets. Once again we see that the total integrated cross-section
grows as we go to higher energy but we also see, at least for the 30 GeV jets, that the
relative contribution to the cross-section increases as we go to higher jet multiplicity.
This is direct evidence that the convergence of the QCD perturbative expansion worsens
as we go to higher centre-of-mass energies. Clearly then resummation effects such as
those described by High Energy Jets become more important at a prospective FCC-
hh machine and will need to be included not only in order to understand the QCD
background well enough to extract and study new physics but also in order for precision
tests of QCD. As we increase the jet cut to 60 GeV we see that the ratio with respect to
the 7 TeV prediction becomes a little flatter and at a cut of 100 GeV the prediction is
identical to that at 7 TeV save for an extra order of magnitude in the total cross-section.
We can understand this by considering the effect of requiring high transverse momenta
on rapidity and therefore rapidity gaps; it is energetically very expensive to emit high
p radiation outside of the yj  0 region and therefore we can suppress the effects of
the logarithmic corrections by limiting the access to phase-space where they are most
important. It should be noted that although increasing our jet cuts to 100 GeV at a
future machine will help suppress higher-order corrections and therefore improve the
convergence of our s expansion it would not solve the problem - i.e. although the
physics of 100 GeV jets at 100 TeV would be closer to that at 7 TeV (modulo an
increased cross-section) that simply means we would be left with the same problems,
detailed in previous chapters, as we have at our current generation of colliders. We also
need to see the effect of the increased cut criteria on the distributions before selecting
a value to actually propose. Fig (6.1a) and fig (6.1b) stand in stark contrast to one
another - forgetting for a moment the added question of the correct choice of jet cut
and just focussing on the comparison of 30 GeV jets at centre-of-mass energies of 7 TeV
and 100 TeV - we see how important the issue of the convergence of the perturbative
series is at an FCC; at this energy even sophisticated fixed-order schemes may not be
able to describe data.
Fig (6.2a) shows the differential distribution in the absolute value of the rapidity span
between the two leading jets in pT , y
j1,j2. We see that as we go to large rapidity gaps
between the dijets the relative increase in the cross-section grows by almost a factor or
10 as we pull the hardest two jets apart in rapidity. This is precisely the effect of the
logarithmic corrections as we saw in chapters 3 and 4. Therefore to correctly describe
QCD radiation patterns with large rapidity separations at an FCC we must capture
at least these leading logarithms. As discussed above we see that requiring harder jets
puts a limitation on the rapidity ranges available to radiation and therefore suppresses
these effects - however, even when we consider only extremely hard jets above 100 GeV
the enhancement is still visible and still leads to a two-fold increase in cross-section in
dijet events with a large rapidity span.

as a function of the absolute value of the rapidity gap between the dijets, yj1,j2.
Fig. (6.2b) - The differential cross-section for Z/ plus inclusive dijets as a function
of the invariant mass of the dijets, mjj .
In fig. (6.2b) we show the differential cross-section in the invariant mass of the two
leading jets in pT . Similarly to the discussion of fig. (6.2a) regions of large dijet
invariant mass, mjj , are exactly the regions we expect to have significant higher-
order perturbative corrections at play. Indeed, at large invariant mass there is a factor
O(10) increase compared to systems with small reconstructed mass when compared to
the 7 TeV prediction. As we make the p jet cut more stringent we induce a large
suppression at values of mjj equal to or below the transverse momentum cut, this also
shifts the invariant mass peak to higher values. But more importantly, we see the same
behaviour at very large dijet mass as for the softer cut of 30 GeV.
Figs. (6.3a), (6.3b) and (6.3c) show the transverse momentum distributions for the
second, third and fourth leading jet in p respectively. We observe that for all three
variables there is a significant increase in the high p region at 100 TeV though here
this can be understood not just in terms of an enhancement caused by logarithmic
corrections but also simply because at a prospective FCC there would be extra energy
available to radiate jets with large transverse momentum. We see that as we move to
60 and even 100 GeV cuts there is a small effect in the cross-section but that the shape
of the ratios with respect to the 7 TeV remains approximately unchanged. Note that
the 100 GeV prediction is not present in fig. (6.3c) since all the events have been cut
from the region in question.
Figs. (6.4a), (6.4b) and (6.4c) show the distributions in terms of the absolute value of
the rapidity of the second, third and fourth leading jet in p. Once again we observe
the expected behaviour with an increase in QCD radiation at large values for rapidity
at 100 TeV relative to at 7 TeV clearly visible. In fig. (6.4a) we see that an increase in
the jet p cut has little effect on the shape of the ratio lines since there is still ample
energy to access those rarefied regions of very forward and backward phase-space. By
contrast for figs. (6.4b) and (6.4c) we see that the higher jet cuts begin to take a toll on
the jet activity at high values of |yj | and we see that the relative rates are suppressed
in these regions.
In summary, we see that the theoretical ideas discussed in chapters 3, 4 and 5 and shown
to be present in 7 and 8 TeV LHC data would be even more pervasive at a prospective
high energy hadronic future circular collider. The regions of phase space, such as those
with very high invariant mass or large rapidity gaps, which are poorly described by
fixed-order schemes at the (relatively) moderate energy ranges of the LHC would be
impossible to describe correctly upon raising the energy to 100 TeV. We see that it is
possible to somewhat protect the convergence of the QCD perturbative expansion by
enforcing stringent jet transverse momentum cuts and that doing so would still lead
to a significant increase in the measured total cross-section in Z/ plus dijet events.
However, even minimum jet p cuts of 100 GeV are not sufficient to completely negate
the effect of the large logarithmic corrections described in previous chapters.

Chapter 7
Conclusions and Outlook
In this thesis we have studied the perturbative description of Quantum Chromodynam-
ics at colliders including the current Large Hadron Collider and a possible hadronic
Future Circular Collider. In chapter 2 we gave an overview of a few key components
required to perform the calculations seen in later sections. In particular, the question
of the validity of truncating this expansion at fixed order in s was raised since the
presence of large logarithm corrections could mean that the convergence of any such
truncated series would be in question.
In chapter 3 we specifically discussed the High Energy limit of QCD processes and
how, in this limit, simple 2 2 scattering processes can be expressed as a contraction
of currents over a pole in the momentum transfer variable, t. We saw that the
next-to-leading order corrections to these simple processes contained an unexpected
enhancement in exactly the form discussed earlier; a logarithm of s/t which would be
large in the limit in question. The idea of t-channel dominance was generalised to more
complicated processes using ideas from Regge theory. We were able to include extra
real and virtual corrections by way of an effective vertex term and the Lipatov ansatz
respectively. We concluded with a discussion of the High Energy Jets framework for
describing all-order corrections to dijet events at hadronic colliders built upon these
results; in particular we saw that in the High Energy limit we can describe processes
in terms of contractions of current and discussed the software set-up of High Energy
Jets in the form of the publicly available HEJ package.
In chapter 4 we focussed on dijet events in the presence of a di-lepton pair produced by
the decay of a Z0 electroweak boson and an off-shell photon, . We were able to derive a
current describing the Z0 emission and saw that, for the two jet case, this agreed exactly
with the leading order result. This was extended to include emission of a photon as well
as the resulting Z/ interference. We saw that the interference term arising from the
multiple possible boson emission sites neglected in previous work by the High Energy
Jets collaboration was no long small and, therefore, developed the tools to be able to
include all possible emission sites for a boson and the interference terms. This result was
then extended to arbitrarily high multiplicity final states through the aforementioned
effective vertex. Due to the inclusion of the interference term it was necessary to develop
a new regularisation for the Z/ plus jets matrix elements - this was done and the
resulting scheme was explicitly shown to be finite upon performing the phase space
integration. The resulting regularised matrix element was shown to be independent
of our phase-space regularising parameter, cut. The procedure by which the HEJ
matrix elements are matched to the leading-order exact matrix elements (provided by
MadGraph aMC@NLO) was then detailed and a summary of the computational challenges
encountered throughout this work was presented. We concluded by comparing the
HEJ Z/ plus jets package to several recent experimental comparisons from both the
ATLAS and CMS experiments. HEJ was seen to be in excellent agreement with the
data in the regions where the logarithms we capture are significant. In regions where
the effect of the high energy logarithms are not the dominant force, such as the double-
differential Drell-Yan study presented, we see that HEJ agrees well with the leading
order prediction since in these regions the fixed-order matching we include becomes
significant. Any deviations are well understood.
In chapter 5 a study of dijet and gap events was presented. Four separate final states
were considered in which the HEJ package interfaced with the parton shower ARIADNE,
HEJ+ARIADNE, gave an excellent description of data throughout. We saw that partonic
HEJ alone was not able to correctly describe the data highlighting the importance of
the collinear logarithms added by the parton shower resummation. The fixed-order
plus parton shower schemes also struggled to give good agreement with data indicating
that, already at centre-of-mass energies of 7 TeV, it is necessary to resum the higher
order logarithmic corrections included within the High Energy Jets framework.
In chapter 6 we presented an analysis of inclusive dijets in association with a Z/
decaying to a di-lepton pair at 100 TeV. Three possible final state cuts were shown
with possible minimum transverse momentum jet cuts of 30, 60 and 100 GeV. We saw
that at 100 TeV the convergence of the fixed-order QCD perturbative series could be
seriously undermined by the logarithmic corrections discussed in this thesis; this was
somewhat neutralised by enforcing a jet cut of 100 GeV and even here we are only
able to reduce the problems at 100 TeV to something comparable to those observed
at 7 TeV. The regions of phase space where there were dijets spanning large rapidity
intervals or with high invariant mass were seen to be most effected by the increased
centre-of-mass energy.
To conclude, the effect of large logarithmic corrections on inclusive dijet events in
association with a Z/ boson is seen to be large. Certainly a good description of
data throughout the entire phase-space would not be possible without an attempt to
capture at least the leading logarithmic terms in s/t at all orders in s. More generally
correctly describing QCD events at hadronic colliders is not possible without resumming
the logarithms significant in the High Energy limit but this, alone, is not the full picture.
We have seen throughout this work that, although the leading logarithmic terms are
undoubtedly important, it is also necessary to include as many of the terms described
by current fixed-order approaches as possible. In the experimental studies of chapters 4
and 5 HEJs predictions have scale variation bands which are significantly larger than
the fixed-order descriptions. This is well understood to be linked to our leading order
matching - therefore the highest priority for High Energy Jets is to modify the matching
scheme within the High Energy Jets framework must be improved to allow matching
the next-to-leading order in s matrix elements. Unfortunately this is not as simple as
just replacing our current MadGraph aMC@NLO interface to instead call an NLO matrix
element since this would cause us to double count contributions. Furthermore the
collinear terms neglected by High Energy Jetss wide angle approximation must also
be considered. We saw in chapter 5 that there are regions of phase space where the
logarithms contributed by ARIADNE are necessary for us to describe data and that, once
included, we gave the best description of data. To that end it would be excellent to
interface HEJ with more of the current state-of-the-art parton showers such as HERWIG
and PYTHIA.
Armed with next-to-leading order accuracy and a range of possible parton showers the
description of data at 7, 8, 13 or even 100 TeV would be, I believe, excellent in many
final states and troublesome regions of phase space currently of interest to experimental
and theoretical physicists alike.
Appendix A
Next-to-leading order corrections
for  qq
Here we present the full calculation for the next-to-leading order corrections (in s) to
  qq which was summarised in chapter 2. The diagrams contributing at NLO were
depicted previously in fig (2.3).
The Leading Order Process
If we let the pair-produced quarks have charge Qe then we have:
A0 = ieQu2(k2)v1(k1)r(p), (A.1)
where we have used the QED Feynman rule for a quark-antiquark-photon vertex:
iQe, the is are the spins of the quarks, r is the polarisation of the incoming photon
and p = k1 + k2 is the momentum carried by the incoming photon. To proceed we can
square and since we are typically interested in unpolarised calculations we perform a
sum over all polarisations, spins and colours:
|A0|2 = 3
e2Q2[u2(k2)
v1(k1)][v
1(k1)
v2(k1)]
(p)
(p). (A.2)
We now use Casimirs trick [53] to convert this spinor string into a trace, using the
replacements
 = g and the completeness conditions for spinors:
|A0|2 = e2Q2 Tr[/k2/k1], (A.3)
where we have used the high energy limit to discard the quark mass terms. This trace
can be evaluated in arbitrary dimensions to give, in the high energy limit:
|A0|2 = 6e2dQ2s(d 2), (A.4)
where we have defined the usual Mandelstam variable s = (k1+k2)
2 = 2k1k2 and define
e2d = e
24d where  has units of mass in order to make the coupling e dimensionless.
To find the leading order cross-section we divide by the particle flux and multiply by
the two particle phase space which is given by:
d2d2R2 = 2
1 (
(d 2) s
2 , (A.5)
where R2 is the two particle phase space in d dimensions. Combining these factors and
defining e =
0 = 3  22d1
(d 2) s
2 4d4Q2s(d 2) 1
= 3Q2
(d 2) .
(A.6)
and finally using x(x) = (x+ 1) we get:
0 = 3Q
(d 2)
. (A.7)
It is important to note that in the limit   0 (i.e. d  4) the Born cross-section
remains finite.
The Virtual O(s) Corrections
The virtual correction graphs are shown in figs. (2.3b), (2.3c) and (2.3d). We will begin
by calculating the second term in eqn. (2.44). Using the Feynman rules we have:
(2)d
u2(k2)(igsT aij)
i(/k1 + /k)
(k1 + k)2
(ieQ) i(
/k2  /k)
(k2  k)2
(gsT aij)r(p)
g + (1 )
v1(k1).
Av = ig2seQ2 Tr(T aT a)u2(k2)
(2)d
N1(k1, k2, k)
k2(k1 + k)2(k2  k)2
v2(k2),
where the numerator of the fraction is given by:
N1(k1, k2, k) = (/k1 + /k)(/k2  /k)
g + (1 )k
. (A.9)
From eqn. (2.44) we see we need A0Av:
A0Av =g2se2Q2 Tr(T aT a)[v1(k1)u(k2)] (A.10)
u2(k2)
(2)d
N1(k1, k2, k)
k2(k1 + k)2(k2  k)2
v1(k1)
r(p)
(p). (A.11)
Now performing the spin/polarisation/colour sum and average gives:
A0Av = 
(2)d
N2(k1, k2, k)
k2(k1 + k)2(k2  k)2
, (A.12)
where:
N2(k1, k2, k) = Tr[/k1(/k1 + /k)(/k2  /k)/k2]
g + (1 )k
. (A.13)
Before we can proceed any further we must evaluate the trace term in eqn. (A.13).
As mentioned briefly in section 2.3.3 this is not as easy as it seems because, although
the Dirac matrices still satisfy the Clifford algebra, the various identities for their
contractions and traces change when we are in d dimensions. Two useful examples are
shown below:
 = d (A.14a)
 = (d 2)nu (A.14b)
Using the FORM package [61] to perform the two trace terms present gives:
Tr[/k1(/k1 + /k)(/k2  /k)/k2] = s[s(8 4d) +
(k1  k)(k2  k)
(32 16d)
 (16 8d)(k1  k  k2  k) + k2(16 12d+ 2d2)],
(A.15)
Tr[/k1(/k1 + /k)(/k2  /k)/k2]kk = s[(k1  k)(k2  k)(16 8d)
+ k2(8 4d)(k2  k  k1  k) k4(4 2d)],
(A.16)
where s = 2k1  k2 and we have used the on-shell relations. After factorising the terms
quadratic in d and combining the two trace terms we arrive at:
A0Av = 4s
(2)d
N3(k1, k2, k)
k2(k1 + k)2(k2  k)2
, (A.17)
where:
N3(k1, k2, k) = 2s+
8k  k1k  k2
+ (6 + 2)(k  k1  k  k2) + k2(d 4)
 4(1 )k  k1k  k2
 (1 )k2.
(A.18)
Combining this with the particle flux and the two particle phase space we can write
an expression for the vertex corrected cross-section. Once again we scale the couplings
such that they remain dimensionless by defining g2d = g

N3(k1, k2, k)
k2(k1 + k)2(k2  k)2
where we have expressed the virtual rate as a multiplicative correction to the Born
level rate. We must now use the Feynman parametrisation to re-express the product
of propagators as a sum by introducing new integration variables. Using:
(ay + b(1 y))2 , (A.20)
we have:
v = 
(2)d
N3(k1, k2, k)
(k2  2k  ky)2k2
, (A.21)
where ky = yk1(1y)k2. Examining now the integrand we see there are two different
k dependences and so we partition the terms as follows:
v = 
(2)d
N (1)3 (k1, k2, k)
(k2  2k  ky)2k2
N (2)3 (k1, k2, k)
(k2  2k  ky)2k4
, (A.22)
where,
N (1)3 (k1, k2, k) = 2s+
8k  k1k  k2
+(6+2)(kk1kk2)+k2(d4)(1)k2, (A.23)
N (2)3 (k1, k2, k) = 4(1 )k  k1k  k2. (A.24)
Differentiating eqn. (A.20) with respect to a and b we get the following useful
parametrisations:
(ax+ b(1 x))3 ,
6x(1 x)
(ax+ b(1 x))4 .
(A.25)
and taking a = k2  2k  ky and b = k2, simplifying the denominators and performing
a change of variables K = k  xpy yields:
v = 
(2)d
2xN (1)3 (k1, k2,K + xky)
(K2  C)3 +
6x(1 x)N (2)3 (k1, k2,K + xky)
(K2  C)4
(A.26)
where C = x2p2y. The change of variables modifies the numerator terms to:
N (1)3 (k1, k2,K + xky) = 2s+K
+ d 5 + 
 (3 + )xs+ x2ys(1 y)(3 d ),
(A.27a)
N (2)3 (k1, k2,K + xky) = (1 )
x2ys2(1 y) 2s
. (A.27b)
We can now perform the integrations over K with the aid of the following result:
(2)d
(K2)m
(K2  C)n =
i(1)mn
Cmn+
(m+ d
)(nm d
)(n)
. (A.28)
Looking at the K structure of eqs. (A.27) we can see that there are going to be four
forms of eqn. (A.28) needed in this calculation. I will not show the calculation for every
integral but will show one as an example of how the calculations can proceed. Consider
the contribution of the first term of eqn. (A.27a):
I = 4s
(2)d
(K2  C)3
= 4si
dxx(4)
2C3+
)(3 d
)(3)
(A.29)
From above we see that C = x2ky = x2y(1 y)s and so:
I = 4si(4)
2 (3 d
)(s)3+
dxx5+dy(2+
2 )1(1 y)(2+
2 )1,
(A.30)
Therefore:
I = 4si(4)
(s)3+
(d 4) . (A.31)
Choosing d = 4 +  (with the intention of taking the limit   0 once it is safe to do
so), and manipulating the gamma functions to expose the pole structure gives:
(2)d
(K2  C)3 = 4(s)
2 i(4)2
1 + 
(1 + )
(A.32)
which is clearly divergent in the limit   0. The other integrals follow similarly and
the combined result can be expressed as:
1 + 
(1 + )
 8 + 4
1 + 
, (A.33)
where we have used s =
. Expanding the product of gamma matrices for   0
gives:
1 + 
(1 + )
2 +O(3), (A.34a)
= 1 +
+O(2), (A.34b)
where E is Eulers constant. Finally then we have:
(6 4E  4L) + E(3 E)
 8 + 
+ 2  L2  (2E  3)L
(A.35)
where L = ln
. We can now see that the result for the vertex correction is
gauge independent as the  dependence has completely cancelled. We also see that the
parameter introduced to fix the coupling to be dimensionless appears in the final result;
this is often the case when using dimensional regularisation and the modified minimal
subtraction renormalisation scheme.
The Real O(s) Corrections
The real gluon emission diagrams which contribute to the O(s) corrections are
figs. (2.3e) and (2.3f). These diagrams have an indistinguishable final state and so
the real contribution, Ar, will be of the form:
|Ar|2 = |Aleft +Aright|2 = |Aleft|2 + |Aright|2 + 2AleftAright, (A.36)
where Aleft and Aright refer to figs. (2.3e) and (2.3f) respectively and are given by:
Aleft = QeigsT aiju(k2)
/k1 + /k
(k1 + k)2
v(k1), (A.37a)
Aright = QeigsT aiju(k2)
/k2 + /k
(k2 + k)2
v(k1). (A.37b)
In the calculation of the terms of eqn. (2.44) it will be useful to write the energy
fractions for each particle as xi =
(where i = 1 is the external antiquark, i = 2
is the antiquark and i = 3 is the external gluon). In terms of these invariants the
contraction of any two external particles simplifies to pi  pj = 12s(1 xk) which (since
we are still assuming our quarks can be taken to be massless) gives a simple expression
for the Mandelstam variables. Evaluating the modulus squared terms gives:
|Aleft|2 =
Q2e2g2s
(k1 + k)4
Tr(T aT a) Tr(/k2
(/k1 + /k)
/k1(/k1 + /k)), (A.38a)
|Aright|2 =
Q2e2g2s
(k2 + k)4
Tr(T aT a) Tr(/k2
(/k2 + /k)
/k2(/k2 + /k)), (A.38b)
AleftAright =
Q2e2g2s
(k2 + k)2(k1 + k)2
Tr(T aT a) Tr(/k2
(/k1+/k)
/k1(/k2+/k)). (A.38c)
Evaluating the trace terms and rearranging in terms of the energy fractions gives:
|Aleft|2 = 32Q2e2g2s
)2 1 x1
1 x2
, (A.39a)
|Aright|2 = 32Q2e2g2s
)2 1 x2
1 x1
, (A.39b)
2AleftAright = 64Q2e2g2s
 2 1 x3
(1 x1)(1 x2)
. (A.39c)
Summing these expressions gives:
|Ar|2 = 32Q2e2g2s
)2 x21 + x22
(1 x2)(1 x1)
) 2 2x1  2x2 + x1x2
(1 x2)(1 x1)
(A.40)
As with the virtual contributions, we are interested in the observable cross-section and
so we must include the phase space factor for a three particle final state. Unlike the two
particle phase space calculation the three particle phase space,
d3d3R3, cannot be
integrated completely and we are left with a differential in terms of the energy fractions
defined above:
dx1dx2
16(2)3
(2 + )
1 z2
2, (A.41)
where z = 1 21x1x2
. Combining eqs. (A.40) and (A.41) with a flux factor gives:
dx1dx2
2Q2e2g2sF (x1, x2; )
(2 + )
1 z2
2, (A.42)
where we define F (x1, x2; ) as the algebraic factor in square brackets from eqn. (A.40).
Switching to a dimensionless coupling and introducing s as above comparing with the
Born cross-section in eqn. (A.7) this can be written as:
dx1dx2
2s0
F (x1, x2; )
(2 + 
1 z2
2. (A.43)
Integrating over the allowed region of x1 and x2 gives:
2s0
(2 + 
1 z2
F (x1, x2; ). (A.44)
We can define a change of variables x2 = 1  vx1 to decouple these integrals and
therefore:
2s0
1 + 
1 + 3
. (A.45)
Further expanding the Gamma functions gives:
(6 + 4E + 4L) E(3 E)
+ L2 + (2E  3)L
As in the case of the virtual corrections this is divergent in the limit  0 and exhibits
a residual dependence on .
Cancellation of divergences
Having now found the vertex corrections and the real corrections up to O(2) we can
write the next-to-leading order cross-section by simply summing the two:
NLO = r + v =
0. (A.46)
So the total cross-section to next-to-leading order accuracy is:
 = 0
+O(2s). (A.47)
The fact that the infrared divergences in both the real and virtual emission NLO
diagrams cancel is an example of the KLN theorem [60] which states that the Standard
Model is completely free of infrared divergences at all orders.
