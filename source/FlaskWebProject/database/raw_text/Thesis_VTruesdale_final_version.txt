Abstract
A detailed nuclear-decay spectroscopy and the -delayed fission of the neutron defi-
cient isotopes 194,196At are presented in this work. An isotopic beam was produced
using the selective Resonance Ionization Laser Ion Source (RILIS) and ISOLDE
mass separator (CERN). The fine-structure  decay of 196At allowed the low-energy
excited states in the daughter nucleus 192Bi to be investigated with new states being
discovered. The -decay branch was also derived with a value of b(
196At)= 2.6(1)
%. Further to this, the half-lives of 196At and 196Po were deduced, with values of
0.358(5) ms and 5.8(1) s respectively. Additionally, multipolarities were assigned to
some of the  transitions that were observed in 192Bi. A preliminary -decay study
of 194At was also carried out.
A -delayed fission study of 196At, and a preliminary DF study of 194At were
also performed. A mixture of symmetric and asymmetric fission fragments of mass
distributions of the daughter isotope 196Po (populated by  decay of 196At) were
deduced, based on the measured fission fragment energies. A DF probability
PDF (
196At) = 9(1)105 was determined.

Introduction
The work in this thesis focusses on the astatine isotopes 194,196At, indicated by the
red squares in Figure 1.1. These nuclei are situated close to the proton drip line and
lie 18 neutrons away from the  stability line. Specifically, it will investigate their
decay properties, in particular,  decay and the rare decay process of beta-delayed
fission (DF). The astatine nuclei for the experiments were produced artificially at
the ISOLDE facility in CERN.
Astatine is one of the rarest elements on Earth and has no stable isotopes. The
rarity of this element is reflected in its Greek name o (astatos), which
means unstable. There is a small amount of astatine present naturally on Earth,
but this is primarily from the decay of radioactive elements in the Earths crust
[1]. The element astatine was first discovered in 1940, using the bombardment of a
bismuth target with alpha particles produced in the Crocker Radiation Laboratory
which was situated in Berkeley at the time [2] (it is now in UC Davis [3]).
1.1 Physics Background
1.1.1  Decay
Alpha radiation was first discovered in 1899 by Rutherford [5] and shown to be the
emission of doubly-charged helium. Along with Rutherford, it was also investigated
by Geiger and Nuttall and in a quantum mechanical formulation by Gamow and,
Guerney and Condon in 1928 [6] The -decay systematics for the Z = 82 region
have been previously explored in a paper by Andreyev et al. [7]. Further details on
 decay are discussed in Section 2.4.
1.1. Physics Background 2

nuclei are shown in black. The nuclei decaying predominantly by  decay are shown
in yellow, those by +/EC in pink and those by  in blue. Adapted from [4].
1.1.2 Fission
Seventy-seven years ago, Hahn and Strassmann published their paper Uber den
Nachweis und das Verhalten der bei der Bestrahlung des Urans mittels Neutronen
entstehenden Erdalkalimetalle [8], in English Concerning the Existence of Alka-
line Earth Metals Resulting from Neutron Irradiation of Uranium[9]. This paper
presents the discovery of fission. The name fission however was not coined by Hahn
and Strassmann, but by Meitner and Frisch, who used the phrase in their paper
Disintegration of Uranium by Neutrons: a New Type of Nuclear Reaction [10]. It
is in this paper by Meitner and Frisch that the first understanding of the fission pro-
cess was put forward, with the authors comparing it to a liquid drop and as such If
the movement is made sufficiently violent by adding energy, such a drop may divide
itself into two smaller drops.[10]. The discovery of fission however, could have been
made anytime between 1934 and its actual discovery, were it not for errors made by
various groups of scientists and the belief that it was impossible to split heavy nuclei
into lighter fragments [11]. In 1934, when the first experiments were made in Rome
by Fermi and his group, an article appeared by Ida Noddack, Uber das Element
93, [12] in which she questioned Fermis discovery of element 93 [13]. In her paper,
she says that Fermi should have compared his new radioelement with all known
1.2. Motivations 3
elements. (english translation [14]) and therefore exclude all other possible nuclei.
Noddack then continues in her paper to say that it is possible that a distinctly
new nuclear reaction could have taken place that had not been observed and if
heavy nuclei are bombarded by neutrons then it is possible that the nucleus breaks
up into several large fragments[12, 14]. The process of fission is being described,
but although the various groups were likely to have seen it, at the time it was not
thought possible that a nucleus could behave in this manner. The partnership of
Curie and Savitch could have been the first to discover fission in 1938, if they had
correctly identified the 3.5 hour half-life activity as lanthanum instead of originally
as an isotope of actinium. Possibly, due to contaminants, they were not able to
identify it as lanthanum, even though it exhibited all the correct properties [15].
Since then, different types of fission have been identified. These are particle-
induced fission discovered in 1939 [8], spontaneous fission in 1941 by Pertzhak et al.
[16], spontaneously fissioning isomers by Polikanov et al. in 1962 [17], beta-delayed
fission (DF) by Kuznetsov et al. [18, 19], Coulomb excitation/Coulex fission in 2000
by Schmidt et al. [20, 21], photofission see e.g. Csige et al. [22] and a surrogate
type of fission, see review by Escher et al. [23].
1.2 Motivations
Generally, most experimental information about the mechanism of nuclear fission
can be discovered at low excitation energies. This is because in low-energy fission
the interactions between macroscopic and microscopic effects can be studied, in
contrast to high energy fission where the microscopic effects are washed out [24].
Previously, low-energy fission was studied by spontaneous fission of the nuclides for
which this is possible (limited to heavy actinides and transactinides), and through
particle induced fission with thermal neutrons and light projectiles such as protons,
deuterons and  particles. These methods only accessed a limited number of nuclei,
mainly those beside the valley of -stability from thorium to rutherfordium and
above [24]. Through the use of Coulex-induced fission using relativistic radioactive
beams, the area of nuclei studied could be extended to the very neutron-deficient
isotopes of At-Rn [20, 21].
Beta-delayed fission is a two-step process in which the parent  decays followed
by the fission of the excited daughter nuclide. It is important in the study of low-
energy fission (E  Bf ) as it allows access to fission data for exotic nuclei that
otherwise do not fission from their ground state. By the end of the 1990s less than
1.2. Motivations 4
Figure 1.2: Mass distributions of selected nuclei in different regions of low-energy
fission. The diamonds in particular relate to DF with the filled diamonds repre-
senting cases where the mass distribution has been measured [24].
20 cases of DF had been found, all of them in the heavy actinides. Reviews of
the data found in these cases have previously been done by Hall and Hoffman [25]
in 1992 and by Kuznetsov and Skobelev [26]. In his paper from 1987, Lazarev et
al. [27] note that the conditions for DF to occur can be found in the preactinide
region, in particular for the neutron-deficient nuclei from Tl to Bi. In this paper
he took the example of 180Tl as being a potential candidate for DF. Experimental
data were then obtained (this has been further studied in references [28, 29, 30]) and
from the analysis in the paper, it was concluded that some of the odd-odd nuclei in
the region of 180Tl to 196At would be likely to decay by DF. Further motivations
are discussed in the following section, the fission fragment mass distributions and
relevance to the r-process in astrophysics.
Although DF is one of the main goals of this work, data on the -decay prop-
erties of 194,196At were also obtained.  decay is the dominant mode of decay for
these nuclei and as such the properties of the  decay were investigated.
1.2. Motivations 5
1.2.1 Mass Distributions
An area of fission studies of particular interest is the mass distribution of the fission
fragments (FFs). The calculated mass distributions (MDs) for a selection of nuclides
which decay by low-energy fission in the region of interest are shown in Fig. 1.2. It
is only by studying low-energy fission, and therefore the microscopic effects, that it
is possible to explain asymmetric mass distributions [30]. The plot shown in Fig. 1.2
can be split into two main areas, the transuranium and the lead regions, the former
demonstrating mostly the asymmetric mass split (e.g. uranium isotopes) while the
latter predominantly symmetric, especially in the vicinity of 208Pb.
Predictions of the fission fragment mass distributions expected in the lead region
used in the analysis of the DF of 180Tl were taken from the five dimensional (5D)
macroscopic-microscopic model by Moller et al. [31], see Fig. 1.3. In this case, as
will be seen in Section 2.6.2, the experimentally obtained asymmetric mass distribu-
tion was not expected before the experiment, but in the latter analysis was found to
be explained by all theories. After the publication by Andreyev et al. [30], a follow
up theoretical study was published by Ichikawa et al. [32]. This study compared
the potential energy surfaces (PES) of 180Hg against 236U. Since 180Hg fissions asym-
metrically, which is in agreement with the calculations, and nuclei which are found
in the 208Rn region fission symmetrically, see Fig. 1.3, it is therefore of interest to
study the nuclei that lie between these nuclei. In this study, the nuclei investigated
were 194,196At.
1.2.2 Nuclear Astrophysics
The work in this thesis concentrates on the proton-rich portion of the Segre Chart.
If attention is turned to the neutron-rich nuclei of the chart, then the process of
DF is expected to have an impact on the astrophysical r-process. In the r-process,
heavier nuclei are formed through successive neutron captures and  decays. DF
affects this by creating fission recycling, which changes the distribution of elements
of the r-process path, or even terminating it [34]. This means that not only can
it influence the abundances of nuclei which are in the region of A  90 - 130, but
by also terminating the r-process, it can affect the production of the super-heavy
elements [35].
The degree to which DF influences the r-process is important if the age of the
Galaxy is to be calculated using actinide chronometers. A method to calculate the
age of the Galaxy is to use the production ratio of r-process nuclides, especially of

the long-lived trans-bismuth nuclei, and compare them with the observed ratio at
the time the Solar System formed. This gives the nucleosynthesis duration, which in
turn can be used to calculate the age of the Galaxy. To produce an accurate answer
for the age of the Galaxy, reliable information is required on how DF affects the r-
process [34]. By improving understanding of the mechanism of DF, this knowledge
can be applied to models, which in turn, can be used to improve understanding of
the r-process.
1.3 Previous Studies of 194,196At
1.3.1 Previous studies of 194At
194At was first seen by S. Yashita using the SASSY gas-filled magnetic separator at
California University Berkeley [36]. The results from Yashitas 1984 PhD thesis gave
the -decay energy as 7.20(2) MeV and a half-life value of 180(80) ms [36]. In 1995,
Leino et. al [37], performed experiments at the gas-filled separator RITU, JYFL,
University of Jyvaskla, Finland, where they proposed the existence of two isomers.
The -decay energies of these isomers were 7.14 MeV and 7.19 MeV, with half-lives
of 40 ms and 250 ms respectively. The most recent paper is by Andreyev et al. [38]
1.3. Previous Studies of 194,196At 7
from an experiment carried out at SHIP in GSI (Darmstadt, Germany). Using the
reaction 141Pr(56Fe,3n)194At, two isomers were seen with the most intense -decay
energies for each being 7178(15) keV and 7190(15) keV. The half-lives of the parent
states of these  decays are 310(8) ms and 253(10) ms respectively. The recent paper
by Nyman et. al [39], describes an experiment in which 194,196At were produced in
the 2n and 4n evaporation channels of the 51V + 147Sm reaction, respectively. They
saw a low and high spin component for 194At also. The energies and half-lives that
they deduced were 7174(8) keV and 240+4030 ms for the low spin isomer, and 7156(5)
keV and 300+5040 ms for the high spin isomer.
There has only been one published paper on the DF of 194At, which was in 2009
by Andreyev et. al [40]. The data originated from the same study at SHIP (GSI)
as for the  decay.
1.3.2 Previous studies of 196At
Previous studies mainly used complete fusion reactions with heavy ions to produce
the 196At nuclei. The first identification of 196At was made by Treytl et al., in
1967 using the Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator at Berkeley [41]. The reactions used
by this group were 185Re(20Ne,xn)205xAt and 187Re(20Ne,xn)207xAt. The reaction
products that recoiled from the thin target were thermalised in helium gas and
collected on a silver foil. This foil was then placed in front of a Si(Au) surface
barrier detector. They detected a single  decay with an energy of E = 7055(7)
keV with a total number of counts for 196At of 60103. A study by Morita et al.
[42], at RIKEN (Tokyo, Japan) used the gas-filled recoil separator GARIS and a
position sensitive silicon detector. The energy found was reported to be 7053(30)
keV, with a half-life of 320+22090 ms. The statistics for their experiment however, are
low with only six position and time correlated events being observed. Enqvist et al.
[43] carried out a study using the RITU gas-filled separator, and the complete-fusion
reaction 170Yb(35Cl,xn)205xFr. The 196At was produced as a daughter of 200Fr, its
-decay energy and half-life values were determined as 7044(7) keV and 390+270120
ms, respectively. At RIKEN using GARIS, Pu et al. [44] in a continuation of the
experiment by Morita et al. [42], 196At was also produced via the pxn channel.
They found an energy for 196At of 7065(30) keV and a half-life of 253(9) ms. An
experiment by Smith et al., [45] was carried out by using the recoil decay tagging
(RDT) technique and the RITU gas-filled separator. They determined the energy
of the 196At peak to be 7048(5) keV with a total number 60(1)103  decays. The
1.4. Thesis Outline 8
half-life value that they measured was 0.388(7) s. The study of 196At by De Witte et
al. [46] at ISOLDE (CERN, Geneva) , reported an -decay energy of 7055(12) keV,
with a half-life of 389(54) ms. A more recent study at RITU by Uusitalo et al. [47],
also reported seeing 196At in the fusion-evaporation reaction 141Pr(60Ni,xn)201xFr
with an -decay energy of 7048(12) keV and a half-life of 350+290110 ms. The recently
published paper by Nyman et al.,[39] (mentioned above), gives an -decay energy
of 7047(5) keV and a half-life of 350+5040 ms. A paper published by Kalaninova et
al. [48] reported two  decays of 196At with -decay energies of 7045(5) keV and
6732(8) keV. A half-life of 350(90) ms was deduced for the much stronger 7045(5)
keV  decay.
The first DF study of 196At was performed by Lazarev et al. [49] in 1987. He
used a fusion-evaporation reaction 159Tb(40Ca, 3n)196At and mica detectors. The
use of mica foil detectors did not allow the measurements of  decay. However, they
did see 148 fission events with a half-life of 0.23+0.050.03 s.

Chapter 2
Theory
2.1 Liquid Drop Model (LDM)
The idea of comparing a nucleus to a liquid drop was first proposed by Gamow in
1929 [50]. The formation of this idea into a model, however, lies in the semi-empirical
mass formula developed by von Weizsacker [51] in 1935 and Bethe and Bacher in
1936 [52]. It was further developed by Bohr and Wheeler in relation to fission in
1939 [53]. The liquid drop model is also an example of a macroscopic model.
By assuming that the nucleus can be compared to a liquid drop, then this analogy
can be used to calculate the binding energy of a nucleus. This was realised by
Weizsacker and defined in what is known as the semi-empirical mass formula. The
form of this formula is [54]:
M(Z,A) = Zmp +Nmn B(Z,A)/c2 (2.1)
, where M,Z,A are the mass, atomic number, mass number respectively, mp is
the mass of a proton, mn is the mass of a neutron, B is the binding energy and c is
the speed of light. The last term, the binding energy can further be defined as:
B = avA asA
3  ac
(A 2Z)2
+  (2.2)
, where av = 15.85 MeV, as = 18.34 MeV, ac = 0.71 MeV and aA = 23.21 MeV
[55]. These parameters are in fact adjusted to a fit of known properties of some
masses of nuclei. The first three terms in Equation 2.1 are the volume, surface
and Coulomb contributions, respectively. These contributions represent those that
would be required to calculate the energy of a charged liquid drop. The volume term
2.2. Spherical Shell Model 10
depends linearly on the mass of the nucleus. This is due to nucleons only interacting
with several nearest neighbour nuclei because of the short range of the nuclear force.
This makes the binding energy per nucleon constant, and therefore, proportional to
the volume, see Fig. 2.1. However, nucleons which are situated at the surface of
a nucleus will experience a lower binding energy as they will not be surrounded
by nucleons, unlike those away from the surface. The surface term is therefore
proportional to the surface area of the nucleus, or liquid drop. The Coulomb term
needs to be considered due to the electrostatic force, acting repulsively, between
protons [6]. Although the use of Equation 2.1 treats the nucleus as a liquid drop,
the final two terms are added to account for the specific number of protons and
neutrons in the nucleus. The fourth term, the symmetry term, comes from the
Pauli principle, whereby it prevents the occupation of an orbital by two identical
particles with identical spins. If nucleons could occupy any of the orbitals, then the
maximum binding energy would be when they occupied the lowest orbitals possible.
Energetically, if only this term were considered, then the symmetric distribution of
Z = N = A/2 would be favoured. The final term is the pairing term. Nucleons
tend to form pairs, with zero spin. The  term is therefore positive if the nucleus is
even-even since all the nucleons will be coupled, negative if the nucleus is odd-odd
and 0 if it is odd-even [55].
Although the liquid drop model is macroscopic, the mass equation shows that in
order to calculate the total energy, both the macroscopic and microscopic energies
need to be considered. This gives:
Etotal = Emacroscopic + Emicroscopic (2.3)
, where the liquid drop model represents the macroscopic part and the shell
model corrections represent the microscopic.
2.2 Spherical Shell Model
The Shell Model is an example of a microscopic model. A fundamental assumption
of the Shell Model is the motion of a single nucleon is governed by a potential
caused by all the other nucleons[54]. If the nucleons are considered in this manner,
then it allows nucleons to occupy a series of levels or shells, and within those levels, a
series of sub-levels or sub-shells. The occupancy of these various shells and sub-shells
is governed by the Pauli Exclusion principle which requires protons and neutrons to

drop model along the beta stability line. The blue line is the total binding energy
per nucleon [56].
be considered separately. The existence of the magic numbers is also due to the
shell structure of the nucleus. Comparing the separation energies of neutrons and
protons with that predicated by the semi-empirical mass formula, then very visible
jumps are seen at very particular numbers; 2,8, 20, 28, 50, 82 and 126.
The theoretical basis of the shell model is that the nuclear Hamiltonian can
be written as the sum of an independent-particle Hamiltonian (H0) and a residual
interaction V shown as [57],
H = H0 + V (2.4)
. In order to calculate the potential of the shell model, two models are usually
considered in the solving of the three dimensional Schrodinger equation as starting
models. These are the Infinite Well and the Harmonic Oscillator Potentials, see Fig.
2.2. These two models were able to replicate the magic numbers of 2, 8 and 20, but
higher numbers could not be produced by these models, see Fig. 2.3. These models
were also not realistic, as both would require an infinite amount of energy in order
to separate a neutron or proton.
2.2. Spherical Shell Model 12
Figure 2.2: Graph of different potentials used to solve the Schrodinger equation.
The Harmonic Oscillator and Woods-Saxon are given as examples in the text [58].
2.3. Nilsson Model (deformed approach) 13
An improved model was developed to represent the nuclear potential more re-
alistically, the Woods-Saxon Potential model. The shape of this potential is about
half-way between the harmonic oscillator and infinite square well potentials, see Fig.
2.2 and is a good representation of the matter density distribution within the nuclei
due to having more of a flat bottom distribution [59]. It is given in the form,
V (r) = 
1 + exp[(r R)/a]
(2.5)
, where V (r) is the potential energy and V0 is the well depth. This can be
adjusted to give the correct separation energy. A typical value would be 50 MeV. R
is the mean radius and is given by R = 1.25A1/3 fm where A is the mass number. a
is the skin thickness and has a typical value of 0.524 fm [54]. This potential again
can provide the magic numbers of 2, 8 and 20 but fails at higher values, see Fig.
In 1949 the model was improved by Maria Goeppert Mayer and Hans Jensen,
who suggested, that similar to atomic physics, the nuclear potential should be a
combination of a central potential and a strong spin-orbit interaction [61]. The
spin-orbit interaction can be written as,
Vso(r)l.s (2.6)
, and causes the re-ordering of the levels. Each spherical level is now split into
two, l + 1/2 and l - 1/2 depending on the orientation of L and S relative to each
other. From Fig. 2.3 it can be seen that as L + 1/2 decreases, L - 1/2 increases in
energy. It is therefore possible to give the states a total angular momentum j = l +
s [54].
2.3 Nilsson Model (deformed approach)
While the above described shell model can only be applied to spherical nuclei, the
Nilsson model can be applied to nearly all deformed nuclei, and hence is one of
the most successful models developed. It describes single particle motion within a
non-spherical potential. This potential can be represented as [62],
V = V0(r) + V2(r)P2(cos ) (2.7)
. In this case it is appropriate to use an axially symmetric single particle Hamil-

tonian with the form,
H = T + V (2.8)
m[x(x
2 + y2) + zz
2] + Cl  s + Dl2 (2.9)
. The first two terms are representative of the kinetic energy and the harmonic
oscillator potential, as seen in Equation 2.8. The third and fourth terms are from
the spin-orbit interaction and an attractive term respectively [63]. The term Dl2 is
only seen in relation to the harmonic oscillator potential. The purpose of the term
is to make the bottom of the potential flatter and therefore closer in shape to the
Woods-Saxon potential, which in turn has greater similarity to the actual density
distribution in nuclei. The one-dimensional oscillator frequencies are defined by
x, y and z in the x,y and z directions. Furthermore, this condition satisfies
Hi = Eii (2.10)
, where i is a Nilsson wavefunction of the form [62],
i = jC
jj (2.11)
, in terms of the spherical shell model wavefunctions, j which is weighted on
the configuration mixing coefficients Cij.
In the spherical shell each of the single particle state energy levels has a degen-
eracy of 2j+1. If nuclei are deformed, then this no longer holds. The energy levels
are now dependent on the spatial orientation of the orbit relative to the core [54].
This is demonstrated in Figure 2.4, where a valence nucleon with a single j orbit has
been placed in a prolate deformed potential. In this situation the orbit at position
K1 will have a lower energy than the orbit labelled K2.
The orbit orientation can be defined by , the projection of total angular mo-
mentum j of the odd nucleon on the symmetry axis (orbital and spin s) [64]. This
is shown in Figure 2.5 where
 = +  (2.12)
, is the projection of angular momentum and projection of intrinsic spin along
the symmetry axis respectively [64].
2.3. Nilsson Model (deformed approach) 16
Figure 2.4: Comparison of two single-particle orbits K1 and K2. These orbits are
shown at two diferent inclinations in relation to a prolate nucleus [62]
On the diagram, K is given as the total angular projection J, since in this case, it
is only the axially symmetric nuclei that are considered. Since the rotational angular
momentum for low-lying states is perpendicular to the symmetry axis Z, then K =
 [62]. The angle between the symmetry axis Z, and the total angular momentum
j, can be written as,
 = sin1
(2.13)
. In the first instance, the nuclei have reflection symmetry for either of the
possible two  directions. The same energy will therefore be given to the + and
- components which gives the levels a degeneracy of 2 [54]. Considering a prolate
deformation, the state which has the smallest  value is the one which will interact
most strongly with the core. This means it will be more tightly bound and hence
lowest in energy. These states then increase as  + 1,  + 2 etc. On the oblate
side, the converse is true. The state with the highest  value is the lowest state,
and then follows as  - 1,  - 2 etc. A simplified version of the Nilsson diagram can
then be produced, see Fig. 2.6.
However, if the rate of change of  is now considered, then it is seen to change
2.3. Nilsson Model (deformed approach) 17

each of the letters can be found in the text.
slowly for low values of K and faster for high values of K. This implies that the
difference in energy will be smaller for low K values and larger for higher values of
K. The corresponding simplified Nilsson diagram is shown in Figure 2.7.
To be able to build the full Nilsson diagram, several j values need to be combined.
Since, according to quantum mechanics, it is not possible for two levels with the
same quantum numbers to cross, then this means that no lines which have the same
K value can cross in the Nilsson diagram. They therefore repel each other. The
different j values can now be included to show the deformations where the orbit
energies intermingle [62]. The relevant Nilsson diagrams are shown in Figures 2.8
and 2.9.
The Nilsson orbits are labelled as,
K[Nnz] (2.14)
, where K is as previously described,  is the parity, N is the oscillator shell
quantum number, nz is the number of nodes in the wave function along the z axis
and  is the component of the orbital angular momentum along the z axis [62],[59].
From previous, we defined K = . Eqn. 2.12 can therefore be re-written as,

(2.15)
, where  is the intrinsic nucleon spin projection on the symmetry axis.
2.4 Alpha Decay
In 1909, six years after Rutherford had measured the charge to mass ratio of the 
particles, he also showed that the  particles were helium nuclei, 4He. Alpha decay
is an effect of Coulomb repulsion, which has a greater effect for heavy nuclei, as the
force increase at a rate of Z2 compared to the specific nuclear binding force which
increases as A. Spontaneous emission of an  particle can be written as [54],
ZXN 
Z2 X
N2 +  (2.16)
. This spontaneous decay however, can only take place if the Q-value is greater
than 0. The Q-value can be calculated as the difference in initial and final masses
of the system. It can be written as,
Q = (mX mx m)c
2 (2.17)
, where the Q-value is the energy released in the  decay and mX and mx are
the masses.
The kinetic energy of the fragments, TX + T is also equal to the Q-value.
Equation 2.17 can now be modified to read,
Q = (mX mx m)c
2 = TX + T (2.18)
. If it is assumed that the momentum of the parent is 0 and the momentum
of the daughter and  particle is 0 (thus, assuming momentum conservation in 
decay) then this allows the Q value to be re-written as,
Q = T
mx +m
(2.19)
. It is typical for the  particle to carry away approximately 98% of the Q-value,
and the recoil daughter the remaining 2% [54], with A having a value of  200.
It was noticed by Geiger and Nuttall that the larger the emitted  particle energy,
the shorter the lifetime. This is reflected in what is known as the Geiger-Nuttall law

which describes this experimental observation. The law can be expressed as [55],
log T1/2 = a(Z) +
(2.20)
, where T1/2 is the half-life, and a(Z) and b(Z) are empirically-deduced constants
which are different for each Z value.
The theory of  decay was presented both independently and simultaneously by
Gamow (1928) [65] and Gurney and Condon (1928) who stated that disintegration
is a natural consequence of the laws of quantum mechanics without any special
hypothesis [66, 6]. The basis of the theory put forward, is that a pre-formed 
particle is assumed to be in the nucleus, trapped there by the Coulomb barrier. The
region in which it can move is determined by the potential of the daughter nucleus.
The  particle can however escape by tunnelling through the Coulomb barrier.
The process of  particle tunnelling is shown in Figure 2.10. Here, V(r) is the
potential energy between the daughter nucleus and the  particle, and is plotted as
a function of the distance r between them. The height of the Coulomb barrier is
represented as B. For the nuclei of interest, typical values are B  2025 MeV, with
2.4. Alpha Decay 23
a Q value of  78 MeV showing that the process of  decay is sub-barrier one.
At a distance of Rr the potential can be thought of as a square well (as this is
just the nuclear potential), with a depth -U. The  particle is able to move in this
region and has an energy of Q + U [54]. The region between R and b forms the
potential barrier. Here it is seen that the potential is larger than energy available,
Q. Due to quantum mechanics, the  particle has a probability to tunnel through
this barrier, which is represented by the point b on Figure 2.10. The potential over
the interval dr can be thought of as many trapezoidal barriers through which the 
particle needs to tunnel in order to escape the nucleus. If r > R, then the potential
V(r) varies as 1/r and so R/b = Q/B.
The probability of the  particle tunnelling through the barrier is given as,
P = e2G (2.21)
, where G is the Gamow factor given by,
[V (r)Q]
2dr (2.22)
, and can be evaluated to,
[cos1
x(1 x)] (2.23)
, where x = R/b = Q/B [54, 6].
The probability formula given in Eqn. 2.21 can be extended to give an expression
in terms of the decay constant, namely,
 = Pfe2G (2.24)
, where  is the decay constant, G is the Gamow factor, P is now the pre-
formation probability and f is the frequency of presenting at the barrier [6]. If this
equation is combined with that in Equation 2.23 and values are inserted, it can be
shown that the half-life is strongly dependent on Q and since the barrier height
also increases with Z, then this also leads to an increase in the half-life.
Angular momentum I can be carried by an  particle. A parity change is
possible with the decay, and therefore a selection rule must apply. In the case of
 decay, if the initial and final parities are the same, then l must be even; if the
parities are different, the l must be odd [54]. This focuses on decays between initial
2.4. Alpha Decay 24
and final states, but it needs to be remembered that an initial state can populate
different final states in the daughter nucleus. This is known as fine structure.
The reduced width for  decay can be written as,
(2.25)
, where 2 is the reduced width, h is Plancks constant,  the decay constant and
P is the barrier penetration factor [67]. If rates of  decay are being discussed, it is
usual to refer to the hindrance factor (HF) which can be defined as
T1/2()exp
T1/2()theor
(2.26)
, where T1/2 indicates it is the partial half-lives that are considered [68]. Pri-
marily, this is the ratio between the rates of the ground state and the excited state
 decay intensities, multiplied by the ratio of the barrier penetration factors. This
however, does not take into account any effects from the centrifugal barrier. If it is
possible to assign an angular momentum to an  decay, then a factor similar to the
HF can be defined, however, the barrier penetration factor needs to be taken into
account if allowing for any centrifugal barrier effects [67]. This is described by the
expression,
l(l + 1)~
(2.27)
, where l is the angular momentum of the  particle,  is the reduced mass and
R is the relevant radius [69]. This can further be shown by Fig. 2.11 in which the
potential energy of  decay is modified due to the centrifugal potential.
As mentioned previously, most simplified models assume that the  particle
already exists within the nucleus and its rate of decay is determined by the potential
barrier of the nucleus. When the half-lives of the  decay are investigated, it can be
seen that some decays have a longer half-life than would be expected. One reason
for this is that a change in spin can lengthen the half-life. This however, cannot
always alone describe why some half-lives are longer than expected. This suggests
that in some nuclei the process of creating an  particle is different.
This difference is most likely to occur in the nuclei which have an odd neutron,
proton or both. Most  decay theories relate to even-even nuclei, in which the
neutrons and protons are all paired off. To create an  particle, it therefore requires
two of these pairs to join. In nuclei that have an odd proton, neutron or one of each
2.5. Electromagnetic Transitions 25

tial. Adapted from [70].
(for odd-odd nuclei), then this particle can block access to pairings and that level
is no longer accessible to  particle formation. In some cases, as in 196At, although
the odd particles do cause some blocking, they are mainly spectators with the decay
occurring in the even-even core as will be shown in Chapter 6 based on reduced
widths values.
2.5 Electromagnetic Transitions
If a  - ray transition is considered, proceeding from an excited initial level of
angular momentum Ii and parity i to a final level of If and parity f , then due to
conservation of momentum it is required that,
~Ii = ~L+ ~If (2.28)
. This will give a range of L values from the largest Ii + If and the smallest
|Ii  If | [54]. The radiation that is emitted can either be electric or magnetic and
depends on the parity of the initial and final levels. If there is no change in parity
then the radiation emitted is said to have even parity and if there is a parity change,
2.5. Electromagnetic Transitions 26
then it will have an odd parity. This can be summarised into selection rules as
shown,
  = no: even electric, odd magnetic
  = yes: odd electric, even magnetic
. There is an exception to the rule. This is when Ii = If = 0 as L = 0 is
forbidden. This is because L  1 due to the photon having an intrinsic spin of 1
and there are no monopole transitions. Therefore, transitions where Ii = If = 0 can
either decay by internal conversion (see Section 2.5.1) or the competing process of
pair production, if the energy is greater than 1022 keV.
For each decay that occurs, it is possible to calculate the transition probability.
The probability per unit time is therefore [54];
(L) =
P (L)
2(L+ 1)
0~L[(2L+ 1)]2
)2L+1
[mfi(L)]
2 (2.29)
. In quantum mechanics, the radiation is emitted as discrete photons and so the
matrix element of the multipole operator is required. It is of the form [6];
Mfi(L) =
fm(L)i d (2.30)
, where the integral is over the whole volume of the nucleus, the wavefunctions
f and i refer to the final and initial states of the nucleus and m(L) is related to
the multipole moment. This will then give a transition probability for the electric
multipole of;

(ML) 
8(L+ 1)
L[(2L+ 1)]2
)2( ~
40~c
)2L+1(
(2.32)
. Estimates of these transition probabilities can be made by using an independent
particle picture and considering transitions of a nucleon moving from one single-
particle orbit to another, without affecting the rest of the nucleus. These estimates

are known as Weisskopf single particle estimates. As they are estimates, often
they do not give correct theoretical values compared with the measured values. It
is possible to say that if the calculated value is greatly reduced, then there may
be poor matching of the final and initial levels. If the values are much larger, it
suggests that the assumption that the transition is due to the single particle alone
is not correct. An example of this is the strongly enhanced 2  0 E2 decays in
the strongly-deformed nuclei. This effect is due to collective enhancement of the E2
decay strength [64].
By considering the reduced transition probability (Bsp(L)) and through the use
of simplifying assumptions i.e. single particle, the following expressions can also be
produced.
Bsp(EL) =
(2.33)
Bsp(ML) = 10
Bsp(EL) (2.34)
. These are the Weisskopf single particle estimates [6]. If the substitution R = R0A
is made, then it is possible to get estimates for the lower multipole orders. Examples
are shown in Table 2.1 [54].
These multipoles may mix. The most common type of mixing that occurs, is
the electric quadrupole E2 with the magnetic dipole M1. This will occur when the
levels are such that the selection rules allow both to be permitted [71]. The strength
of each in the mix can be calculated and is expressed in general terms as
< Jf ||E2||Ji >
< Jf ||M1||Ji >
(2.35)
, where Jf and Ji are the final and initial states respectively.
2.5. Electromagnetic Transitions 28
2.5.1 Internal Conversion
Instead of  emission, the excitation energy can be directly transferred to an orbital
electron, which is then emitted. This is called internal conversion. It also occurs in
0+  0+ decays as no  transitions are allowed. If nuclear recoil is omitted, then
the ejected electron has a kinetic energy of,
Eel = E Be (2.36)
, where E is the transition energy and Be is the binding energy of the electron
in a specific electron shell [6]. It is possible to determine which shell the electron has
been emitted from, as it will have a specific energy depending on its shell location.
The electrons can therefore be labelled depending on which shell they originated
from e.g. K,L,M. When an electron is emitted from an orbit, an electron from
a higher shell will drop down to take its place. This results in the emission of
characteristic X-rays or Auger electrons.
In some decays, internal conversion is the preferred method of decay over gamma
decay. Therefore, when calculating the decay probability for gamma decay, the
contribution from internal conversion needs to be accounted for. The total decay
probability can therefore be written as the sum of two components; one from the
gamma decay and one from the internal conversion,
t =  + e (2.37)
. This can be re-written as [54],
t = (1 + tot) (2.38)
, where tot is the total internal conversion coefficient. This is defined as the
ratio of the electron emission rate (Tic) to the gamma emission rate (T) [72] and
is written as,
tot =
(2.39)
. This is for the total internal conversion coefficient, which is made up of the
internal coefficients of each of the shells, such that,
2.6. Fission 29
. Each of these shell coefficients can also be broken further to give the subshell
contributions.
2.6 Fission
As stated before, the process of fission can be likened to that of a liquid drop,
first described by Meitner and Frisch [10] and further compared to a liquid drop by
Bohr and Wheeler [53]. Although Bohr and Wheeler [53] were able to explain the
process of fission, they could not explain why the actinides predominantly fissioned
asymmetrically. The liquid drop model (LDM) therefore describes fission as the
potential energy changes that are seen when there are shape distortions caused by
the interaction of surface and Coulomb effects [73]. This picture however, does not
take into account any shell effects or interactions caused by independent particle
motion in the parent fissioning nucleus and/or in the fission fragments. The LDM
was also found to not be sufficient to explain everything that was known by fission
by the end of the 1950s [74]. The process of fission can therefore not be considered
as a macroscopic model only, but as a macro-micro model in which shell effects also
play a part.
In order to understand the measured values (e.g. mass-energy distributions,
neutron multiplicities) and describe them theoretically, shell effects need to be taken
into account [59]. It is these shell effects that are the reason for complex two-
humped structures of fission barriers in some nuclei (fission isomers). Corrections
were therefore made to the LDM in the form of shell corrections by Strutinsky [75].
The importance of shell structure becomes apparent when looking at asymmetric
mass distributions of fragments, particularly those of heavier masses. The mass of
the heavy fission fragment group tends to be constant at A  140, whereas the mass
of the light fission fragment group increases as the parent mass increases [54].
Therefore the macroscopic-microscopic model uses the LDM as the macroscopic
part, and the shell model as the microscopic. However different variants of the LDM
and shell model can be used, and have been used by different authors.
The second model type that can be used are the self-consistent microscopic
models which are based on the Hartree-Fock Bogoliubov (HFB) method [76]. In
these models there is no macroscopic part, and this model was used in the work by
Ghys et al. [77].
Depicted in Fig. 2.12, is the potential-energy surface (PES) as a function of the
deformation of the nucleus, of which the fission barrier is a point on this PES. At
2.6. Fission 30

deformation. Marked on the diagram are the saddle point and the height of the
fission barrier. Adapted from [58].
2.6. Fission 31
the saddle point, in most cases, the fission fragments have not yet fully separated.
If the nucleus is able to traverse the barrier, it reaches the scission point, where the
neck that has formed between the fragments breaks and the fragments separate. On
Fig. 2.12 this occurs on the downward slope of the potential-energy curve after the
saddle point. Since it is possible for the developing fission fragments to exchange
nucleons, this leads to a variety of fission fragments being formed. This produces a
spread of products varying in mass, proton and neutron number. Once scission has
occurred the fission fragments are accelerated by the Coulomb repulsion between
them [78].
2.6.1 Total Kinetic Energy
Of the energy released in fission, the largest amount is distributed to the kinetic
energy of the fragments. The values indicate that the average total kinetic energy
of the fission fragments does not depend on the initial excitation energy to a high
sensitivity. This means that almost all of the kinetic energy of the fission fragments
comes from the Coulomb repulsion which acts on the fission fragments after scission.
The total kinetic energy varies linearly with Z2/A1/3. This can be shown visually
in Fig. 2.13 which was developed by Viola et al. [79] and provides a summary of
TKE data for various nuclides.
However it was first noted by Terrell in 1959 [80] that since the kinetic energy
of the fragments is caused by the Coulomb repulsion then it can be said that,
Z1Z2e
R1 +R2
(2.41)
. If it assumed to fission symmetrically and the radius is taken as R = r0A
then it can be said that,
)1/3r0A1/3
(2.42)
. Although this shows the dependence already mentioned, the magnitude of r0
will be too great. This is due to the fragments being assumed to be spherical [73].
This however is just a general guide and should not be depended upon since mass
distributions can vary greatly from the expected values.

nucleus [79]
2.6. Fission 33
2.6.2 Mass Distribution
The mass distribution of fission fragments can be classified in two distinct modes,
symmetric fission and asymmetric fission. The observation of asymmetric fission
helped in the development of the nuclear shell model [81].
Asymmetric fission appears to be associated more with low-energy fission pro-
cesses, rather than symmetric fission at the higher E [54].
The first explanation of distinct fission modes was proposed by Pashkevich [82] in
1971. At the transition state, the decision to fission asymmetrically or symmetrically
is due to the difference in height for each of the fission barriers relating to the
mass distribution. However, at the scission point, it is the average TKE difference
that is the determinant. Fig. 1.2 provides a graphical summary of low-energy
fission studies. It can be seen that the mass distributions fall into three categories,
asymmetric, symmetric and bimodal mass distributions. It is noted in a paper by
Itkis et al. [83], that around A 200, asymmetric fission is no longer favoured
energetically.
The case of 180Tl
In 2010, Andreyev et al. published a paper entitled New Type of Asymmetric
Fission in Proton-Rich Nuclei [30]. This paper discusses the DF of 180Tl, whose
 decay daughter is 180Hg and was expected to fission symmetrically. The latter
is believed to fission symmetrically since common arguments state that shell effects
in the fragments determine mass distributions. For comparison, the predominant
asymmetric mass split of heavy actinides is believed to be due to the strong shell
corrections of the fission fragments in the vicinity of the doubly-magic 132Sn. In the
case of 180Hg, a symmetric fission would lead to 90Zr, (Z) = 40, which is a semi-magic
number and a neutron number (N) = 50 which is one of the magic numbers. The
fission of 180Hg however, was found to be asymmetric. The asymmetric fragment
distribution can be seen clearly in Figure 2.14.
To explain why 180Hg fissions asymmetrically instead of symmetrically, Ichikawa
et al. [32] produced the potential energy surface plot as shown in Figure 2.15 where
the macroscopic-microscopic approach was used.
The blue area to the left of Fig. 2.15 is the ground state of 180Hg. Moving
out of this ground state there is an asymmetric valley and a symmetric valley. The
symmetric valley is much deeper than the asymmetric valley and lies lower in energy
at larger elongations. The entrance to the symmetric valley also lies at a much higher
2.7. Beta-delayed Fission 34

expected to fission symmetrically.
excitation energy than the entrance to the asymmetric valley. The two valleys are
separated by a ridge, which as the elongation increases, disappears. It would then be
expected that the system would then fall into the symmetric valley. This however is
not the case, as by this stage a well-developed neck has formed, restricting the flow
of mass between the forming fragments. This makes it un-energetically favourable
to change from the asymmetric valley to the symmetric valley [30].
2.7 Beta-delayed Fission
Beta-delayed fission (DF) is a two-step exotic decay process. Specifically on the
neutron-deficient side, relevant to this work, a parent nucleus (A, Z ) beta decays
to an excited state in the daughter nucleus (A, Z-1 ), and if the excited state lies
close to or above the fission barrier, then there is a probability that fission will
occur. The fission from these states near the top of the fission barrier occur, in
effect, instantaneously (10141015 s) whereas the timescale for populating the
states that may fission is determined by the half-life of the precursor nuclide [27],
hence the delayed fission. Therefore in DF the fission is from an excited state(s) in
2.7. Beta-delayed Fission 35
Figure 2.15: The above plot shows the potential energy surface of 180Hg as calculated
by Ichikawa et al. [32]. The ground state of 180Hg is seen on the left hand side, at
q2 = 0, and mass-asymmetry  = 0. Although a deep symmetric valley is present,
there is a large barrier that would need to be overcome in order to enter this valley.
The red crosses indicate areas where there are small potential energy changes.

chart. The QEC and Bf are indicated on the diagram [58].
the daughter but that the time behaviour of the fission is determined by the parent.
The fission of the nucleus is however in competition from from other decay modes,
i.e.  and particle decay. This competition, and the  strength function, affect the
probability of DF occurring.
The probability of DF can be determined from experiment using:
PDF =
, (2.43)
, where NDF is the number of fission events measured and N is the number of
 decays.
DF is a low-energy fission process where the excitation energy of the fissioning
daughter nucleus is limited by the QEC value of the parent -decaying isotope. In
the lead region, this is normally a value of between 912 MeV. Fig. 2.17 shows
the variation of QEC(At) and Bf (Po) for the DF of astatine isotopes in the mass
range of interest. For the lightest neutron deficient nuclei the QEC (Finite Range
Droplet Model/Finite Range Liquid Drop Model (FRDM/FRLDM) [84, 85]), QEC
(AME2012 [86]), Bf (FRDM/FRLDM), Bf (Thomas Fermi (TF) [87]) are plotted
showing the decrease in QEC as Bf increases. This plot also demonstrates why it is

only odd-odd nuclei that have been found to DF. It can be seen that the parent
astatines QEC values which have an even A have an energy  2 MeV higher than the
odd - A astatines. This QEC difference and the production of an even-even daughter
(which fissions more easily) is why DF has only be observed for the odd-odd nuclei.
This however can prove to be problematic due to the smaller mass astatine isotopes
having more than one state present with a  branch. Also, it is not always known
which state is the ground state, which is a general problem with odd-odd nuclei [24].
Calculating the QEC-Bf difference for
194At, the FRDM/FRLDM estimate is
194At)-Bf (
194Po)= -0.04 MeV. In comparison, the value for 196At isQEC(
196At)-
196Po)= -1.19 MeV for the FRDM/FLRDM, which is smaller.
This will likely be reflected in the value of PDF which, as shown in the text, will
be smaller than that of the lighter astatines. The value of -1.19 MeV also indicates
that it will be sub-barrier fission that occurs in this case.
If it is assumed that the only criterion for DF to occur is based on QEC-Bf ,
there would be a large number of nuclei for which DF could be observed (except
2.7. Beta-delayed Fission 38
the -stable ones). Therefore by having a b which is non-zero and > 1%, this limits
the number of potential nuclei that can DF to  100 [24]. In Fig. 1.2 the diamonds
represent the known DF cases of which there are only 26.

Experimental Method
3.1 ISOLDE Facility
All results discussed in this thesis are from experiments carried out at ISOLDE.
The layout of the ISOLDE [88] facility can be seen in Figure 3.1. Highlighted on
the figure are the locations of the High Resolution Separator (HRS) and General
Purpose Separator (GPS) targets, the mass separators themselves and the beamline
that was used in these experiments. These will be discussed further in this chapter.
3.1.1 Proton beam and Target
The protons are supplied to ISOLDE from the PS-Booster (PSB). The PSB is made
from four synchrotron rings which receive protons from Linac2 at 50 MeV. These
protons are then accelerated to 1.4 GeV. However, with the recent energy upgrade
that took place in 2013 - 2014, the PSB is now able to supply 2 GeV protons. The
protons are delivered as a series of pulses, with a duration of 2.4 s and a spacing
interval of 1.2 s. The pulses are grouped together in bunches that can contain 36 to
42 pulses to create a supercycle which typically has a duration of 4050 s. The
pulses in each supercycle are either directed to ISOLDE or diverted to other set-ups.
Typically 50% of the pulses in the supercycle will be sent to ISOLDE [90].
There are two target stations at ISOLDE, one for each of the mass separators.
Different target materials are available and over 60 elements have been produced for
study. The choice of target depends on the type of study being performed and the
yield of the radioisotope to be produced. In the case of the experiments discussed
here, a thick 50 g/cm2 UCX target was used, as shown in Figure 3.2 [91]. The UCX
target is composed of round discs, which are contained in a tantalum tube, which is
3.1. ISOLDE Facility 40
Figure 3.1: Layout of the ISOLDE facility. Labels on the figure indicate the main
components of the facility. These are the HRS and GPS targets and associated mass
separators, and the position of the Windmill system that was used. Image taken
from [89]
heated to temperatures of between 1700  and 2400  [92].
When a high-energy proton hits the UCX target, three main processes can oc-
cur. These are spallation, fission and fragmentation reactions [91]. Each of these
processes is demonstrated in Figure 3.3.
This results in a large spread of products ranging from the very light to the heavy
nuclei that the target material is made from. Spallation is a two stage process.
The first stage, referred to as the intra-nuclear cascade (INC) occurs when the
projectile (travelling at relativistic speeds) smashes into the target nuclei. Due to
relativistic effects the wavelength of the projectile is such that it causes nucleon-
nucleon collisions which form the INC. In stage two the remaining nucleus had
thermal excitation energy and angular momentum. The nucleus therefore de-exites
by evaporating large numbers of protons, neutrons and  particles and emitting
-rays until it reaches ground state [93]. Spallation reactions mainly populate the
neutron-deficient side of the nuclear chart. In the fragmentation process a variety of
isotopes that are close to the target and projectile nuclei are produced. It can also
produce very light nuclei. The third process is fission, in which the excited target
nucleus splits into two nuclei, with the release of neutrons. The fission process

mainly creates the nuclei found on the neutron-rich side of the chart of nuclides
[94]. This is because typically the nuclides that will readily undergo fission tend
to be neutron-rich and therefore the daughter products they produce will also be
neutron-rich. The astatine isotopes in this work were produced through spallation
reactions. The reaction products travel by diffusion and effusion from the target
chamber to the ion source through a transfer tube, as shown in Figure 3.4.
3.1.2 Ion Sources
Due to the high temperature of the target, then it is possible to get release times of
under a second since the target is in carbide form. All the nuclei initially produced
are in the atomic (neutral) state. Therefore to extract them from the target, they
need to be ionised in an ion source. By applying a potential the ions can then be
extracted from the source. There are three different types of ion sources at ISOLDE;
surface, plasma and laser sources. These are outlined in the following subsections,
but emphasis is placed on laser ion source, which was utilised in this work. An
overview of each element produced at ISOLDE and its ionisation process can be
seen in Figure 3.5.
3.1. ISOLDE Facility 43

the method by which the ionisation occurs. Some elements can be ionised by two
methods. These elements are shown as boxes containing more than one of the colours
[58].
3.1. ISOLDE Facility 44
Surface Ionisation
Surface ionisation has proven to be a very successful method to produce positive and
negative ions of charge 1+ or 1. In this process, an atom comes into contact with a
heated surface and gains or loses an electron before being re-emitted as an ion [95].
The efficiency of surface ionisation is given by the Saha-Langmuir equation,
)exp[
(I  )
], (3.1)
, where n+, na are the number of ions and atoms per cm
3, respectively,  is the
work function at temperature T ,  is the charge on an electron, k is the Boltzmann
constant, I is the ionisation potential and +, a are the statistical weights of ions
and atoms, respectively [96]. Ionisation efficiencies of 50-100% can be obtained for
elements that have an electron affinity greater than 2 eV or an ionisation potential
less than 5 eV [97]. Examples are francium and thallium isotopes, the former being
one of the easiest elements produced at ISOLDE by surface ionisation.
Typically, this is a non-selective ion source, which does not provide strong el-
ement selectivity, except for specific cases of very easily-ionised elements, such as
francium.
Plasma Ion Source
The plasma ion source can be used in cases where it is not possible to ionise an
element by surface ionisation. Most ISOL plasma ion sources were based on the
Forced Electron Beam Induced Arc Discharge (FEBIAD) design [98]. The ion source
contains a gas mixture, argon and xenon in the case of ISOLDE, which is ionised by
electrons which have been accelerated between the transfer line and the extraction
electrode. The electrons can have energies of between 100 and 200 eV. This electrons
are then capable of ionising any other atoms that are present in the ion source. The
ion source installed at CERN is the MK5 high temperature plasma ion source, with
a maximum temperature  1900  and has the advantage that the same current
which is used to heat the transfer line, from target to ion source, also heats the disc-
shaped cathode [99]. This is also a non-selective ion source, whereby all elements
produced in the target will be ionised with comparable efficiencies.

3.1.3 Resonant Ionisation Laser Ion Source
The principle of a resonant laser ionisation source (RILIS) is to provide a multi-step
ionisation process. Due to the nature of this process, a high degree of ionisation
selectivity for a specific element can be achieved. A schematic demonstrating these
ionisation methods is shown in Figure 3.7. The ionisation process can be effectively
carried out by the use of pulsed laser systems. The laser photons are used for
ionisation and have precise wavelengths to match the electron transition energies of
an ionisation scheme. The ionisation stage involves a valence electron being excited
in steps until it is above the ionisation potential.
The final step to ionise the atom can either be a non-resonant photo-ionisation
to the continuum or, a resonant step into an auto-ionising or Rydberg state [100].
In the case of a Rydberg state, the atom is ionised with removal of an electron by a
constant or pulsed electric field, absorption of an infra-red photon, or by a collision
[92].
The confinement and extraction of the ions within the hot ion cavity source is
identical to surface ion sources. The time taken for atoms to diffuse out of a hot cav-
ity source is approximately 0.1 ms. This time is small compared to diffusion/effusion
time from the target, which ensures that the conditions are suitable for ionisation

via a Rydberg state.
of any short-lived isotopes. However, to ensure efficient interaction with the atoms,
the lasers need to have a pulse repetition rate of at least 10 kHz [101]. Although
the hot cavity does act as an impedance, it can only delay the effusion of atoms for
approximately 100 s until the next laser pulse is able to interact with the atoms
[92]. The ionisation scheme for astatine is shown in Figure 3.8. The development of
the scheme is described in the PhD thesis by Rothe [102].
After ionisation to the 1+ charge states, the ions are extracted using a potential
of 3060 keV. After extraction, the ions are then mass separated by GPS and HRS,
see next section. A summary of this whole process is depicted in Figure 3.9, which
also shows three possible detector systems. The detector system pertaining to this
experiment, the Windmill, will be discussed in detail in Section 3.2.1.
3.1.4 Mass Separation
There are two mass separators at ISOLDE, the General Purpose Separator (GPS)
and the High Resolution Separator (HRS). Although each separator has its own
target, they are both fed into a common beam line to allow the beam to be sent to
any of the experimental lines. The GPS is the smaller of the two separators. Using
3.2. Detector System 47

an electrostatic switchyard magnet, three masses can be sent through beamlines
known as mass lines. These are identified as the low, central and high mass lines.
The low and high mass lines can select mass ranges at 15% to the central mass
line [88]. These three beams can be transported simultaneously to three different
experimental set-ups in the experimental hall, however in practice this method is
rarely used. The mass resolution m/m of GPS is approximately 2400 [88].
Whereas GPS has only one bending magnet, HRS has two magnets. One is
located at 90 for the first separator stage, and 60 for the second separator stage
[104]. Unlike the GPS, only one beam of a specified mass can be produced at HRS.
The mass resolution of HRS is > 5000 [105].
3.2 Detector System
After mass separation the beam is transported to one of the three detection sys-
tems, being ISOLDE Farady cups, the Windmill decay spectroscopy setup and
ISOLTRAP, the MR-TOF mass separator [103]. The Windmill detector system
used in these experiments was designed and built at the Instituut voor Kern-en
Stralingsfysica, KU Leuven, University of Leuven.
3.2. Detector System 48
Figure 3.9: The summary of the production process for our experiments. The
astatine, produced in the reactions between the beam of protons and the UCX
target, is ionised using the RILIS system. The ionised astatine is then extracted
using a 30 kV potential. The astatine travels through a mass separator where the
mass of interest is selected. This beam of relevant mass astatine is then directed to
the detection station. Depending on the type of measurement that is being carried
out, different detection stations will be utilised. Shown in the above diagram are the
ISOLDE Farady cups, the Windmill  decay spectroscopy set-up and ISOLTRAP,
the MR-ToF mass separator[103].
3.2. Detector System 49
3.2.1 Windmill
The Windmill is a vacuum chamber containing four silicon detectors and an alu-
minium rotating wheel. Placed equidistantly around the wheel are ten carbon foils
of thickness 20g/cm2. A picture of the inside of the Windmill chamber is shown
in Figure 3.10.
Figure 3.10: Picture of inside the windmill chamber while it is open. The rotating
wheel is clearly seen in the centre of the chamber. Although mainly hidden behind
the wheel, Si1 and Si4 can be seen. The silicon detectors and carbon foils are
labelled.
The beam enters the chamber through the hole of a surface barrier annular
detector (43-051F). This detector is known as Si1. The annular detector has a
depletion depth of 300 m with an active area of 450 mm2 and a central hole of
8 mm. The beam then implants into one of the carbon foils. The thickness of
the carbon foils required for this experiment was determined using the program
SRIM [106]. The carbon foils needed to be thick enough to stop the incoming
30-60 keV beam to allow implantation, but thin enough to allow  particles and
fission fragments to escape with a minimal amount of energy loss. Situated behind
the carbon foil is a second surface barrier detector known as Si2. This detector is
totally-depleted (47-038D) with a depletion depth of 300 m and and active area
3.2. Detector System 50
of 300 mm2. The Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of the annular and totally
depleted detectors are 25 keV and 20 keV respectively for  particles, measured
with the 5.486-MeV -decay from 241Am [107]. The pairing of Si1 and Si2 allows
for coincidence measurements of the fission fragments. This is important as only for
coincident events can the mass distribution be extracted (as explained in Chapter
5). The location of Si1 and Si2 is known as the implantation position. After a
supercycle is finished, the wheel is rotated 144 anticlockwise using a step motor to
the decay position [108]. Two Passivated Implanted Planar Silicon (PIPS) detectors
are situated here in the same geometry as Si1 and Si2. These detectors are known
as Si3 (74256) and Si4(74257) [58]. The thickness of the detectors was 300 m with
an active area of 300 mm2[109]. The FWHM of an  particle is 15 keV using 5.486-
MeV  particles from 241Am. The use of Si3 and Si4 allows long-lived daughter and
granddaughter products to be studied. The positioning of all four silicon detectors
can be seen in the schematic shown in Figure 3.11 and the photographs in Figure
3.12.
Silicon detectors are a type of semiconductor detector. For a semiconductor
detector to work, a junction needs to be formed. A commonly used junction is the
pn junction. These are formed using specialised techniques to join to n- and p-type
semiconductor material in one crystal. For a semiconductor material to be n-type
it will have been doped by an impurity that will result in an excess of electrons.
Conversely, a p-type semiconductor material is one which has been doped with an
impurity to produce an excess of holes [110] The formation of a pn junction creates
an area around the junction depleted of charge carriers. Since the concentration
difference of holes and electrons in each material is different, holes will initially
diffuse towards the n-type region and electrons towards the p-type region. This
causes a charge buildup on either side of the junction, and hence an electric field.
This electric field, in turn, creates a potential difference across the junction, known
as the contact potential. This changing potential is the depletion region. This area
has no charge carriers and any electron-hole pairs that are produced by ionising
radiation will be removed by the electric field [111]. This generates an output signal,
which will be proportional to the energy of the incoming ionising radiation, which
can then be displayed using analysis software.
Although a detector with the above description will work, it will have a very
poor performance. If an external voltage is applied, in particular a reverse-bias, the
performance is found to improve considerably. In this configuration the holes and
electrons are attracted away from the junction with the effect that the depletion
3.2. Detector System 51
region increases in size. This increases the volume of material that can be used for
detection purposes and any charge carriers created in this region can be collected
quickly. The depletion region width can be adjusted by altering the external applied
voltage. A higher external voltage will produce a wider depletion region. There is
however, a limit to the voltage that can be applied. The resistance of the semi-
conductor determines this limit and if this resistance is exceeded, the junction will
breakdown and no longer operate in the required manner.
There are also two High Purity Ge detectors as part of this set-up, one detector
directly behind Si2, and the second at 90 anticlockwise with respect to the first as
shown in Figure 3.13. These are known as Ge1 and Ge2. Germanium detectors can
detect  rays through three interactions that  rays have with matter. These are
the photoelectric effect, compton scattering and pair production. In these processes,
the  ray loses energy through absorption or scattering. Some  rays, however, will
not interact and pass straight through a material losing no energy.
To construct a germanium detector a large piece of high quality germanium is
heated to further remove any impurities, and this process is repeated until the impu-
rity levels are very low. A single large crystal can then be grown from this material.
Depending on which impurities are remaining in the crystal, it can be either mildly
n- or p-type. HPGe detectors are normally operated as fully depleted detectors. Ap-
plying a reverse bias to the crystals electrical contacts creates a depletion region.
The lower the impurity levels, the larger the depletion region for a given voltage.
Silicon Detectors and Fission Fragments
Fission fragments have much larger masses than  particles and this leads to per-
formance effects occurring in the silicon detectors. This is commonly known as
pulse-height defect (PHD) [113, 111]. Due to their larger mass, the fragments will
lose more energy when passing through the entrance window than lighter particles of
the same energy. Fission fragments also create a high density of electron-hole pairs
due to their high effective charge. This cloud affects the external electric field,
and electron-hole pairs are not moved straight away resulting in a higher chance of
recombination compared to the detection of  particles. Diffusion will dissipate the
cloud and the pairs will drift again under the influence of the electric field, but with
a delay. This means that the detector calibration will differ for different particle
types. A particular calibration method is therefore used for fission fragments which
will be described in Section 5 along with further details of PHD.

3.2.2 Electronics
Digital electronics were employed for both experimental runs. Nine Digital Gamma
Finder (DGF) modules were available of which eight were utilised at a time, leaving
one spare module. The modules are numbered from 0 to 8. In the 2011 run, modules
0 - 7 were used, but due to problems with module 7 in 2012 it was replaced with
module 8. The layout of the modules for the 2011 and 2012 experimental runs are
shown in Figure 3.14a and 3.14b.
Out of the channels on the modules used for Si1-Si4 and Ge1-Ge2, only the top
and bottom channels were utilised for the energy and timing respectively. Module
6 is used for the pulser and only the top channel is used on this DFG. The timing
module (7 or 8) uses all four channels. To control the timing of the system, multiple
clocks were used. These clocks are set depending on the number of pulses in the
supercycle and which number of pulse in the supercycle is the first to be sent to
either HRS or GPS depending on the mass separator used. The main clocks utilised
are listed below with the method by which it was set.
 DAQ Delay: (first proton pulse number to be sent to HRS or GPS -1) x 1200
ms + 834 ms. The 1200 ms is the time between successive proton pulses in
the supercycle and the 834 ms represents the signal time from being received
to being transmitted to the recording equipment.
 Windmill: number of proton pulses in the Supercycle x 1200 ms - 1100 ms -
100 ms. The 1200 ms is the time between successive proton pulses as set for
the DAQ Delay . The 1100 ms is the time taken for the Windmill to turn, and
the extra 100 ms is there to make sure it has turned.
 DAQ Ready: This is the time of the Windmill clock - 100 ms. This ensures
that no collecting happens while the Windmill is still turning.
 Beam Gate: Same as the DAQ ready clock.
By using these clocks the data acquisition can be triggered to start at the be-
ginning of the delayed SC, determined by the DAQ Delay clock. The system is also
connected to a beam gate in the ISOLDE control room, which provides a time signal
for the time between the proton pulse and when mass separator is able to send the
beam to the set-up [58]. There are also auxiliary timers for the Proton Pulses and
Supercycle.

Analysis of HRS Data
4.1 Calibration of the - and -Decay Spectra
In this section the method by which the  and  spectra were calculated is detailed.
In Chapter 5 the calibration specific to fission will be discussed. Any calibration
methods discussed in this chapter will be appropriate for both the 2011 (HRS) and
2012 (GPS) data unless stated otherwise.
4.1.1  Spectra Calibration
Depending on the data being recorded, the energy range of the silicon detectors
could be altered. Since in most runs fission fragments also needed to be recorded, the
energy range was set from  200 keV to 100 MeV. In this section the calibration of
the -decay energy range (5  8 MeV) will be discussed, while the fission calibration
is discussed in Chapter 5.
Initially the silicon detectors were set-up and roughly calibrated using a 241Am
source. This could not be used for the actual calibration due to the decay pattern
of 241Am. There are three main  decays at energies of 5485.6 keV, 5442.8 keV and
5388.0 keV. The 5485.6 keV is the strongest of the lines, but if the energy resolution
of the detectors were to be above  30 keV then the second strongest peak (5442.8
keV) may not be resolved creating a broader peak. There is also a 60 keV  transition
in coincidence with the 5486 keV decay, which creates a conversion electron. This
conversion electron can cause a shoulder in the 241Am peak due to summing of the
5486 keV  particle and the conversion electron if both are registered in the same
detector. The point at which the 241Am source sits is offset from silicon detector,
which means the calibration source is not sitting directly in line with the detector.
4.1. Calibration of the - and -Decay Spectra 57
To calibrate the  decay spectra more precisely, the known peaks of the decay
daughters of 196At, 192Bi (after 196At  decay) and 196Po (after 196At  decay) were
used. Both of these nuclides have well known energies of 6060(5) keV and 6521(5)
keV, respectively [114]. Using an uncalibrated spectrum and the energy values of
these peaks, the spectra were calibrated by assuming a linear relationship between
the energy E, the channel number Ch, the gain A, and the offset B to give;
E = A Ch+B (4.1)
. In this case, it was possible to find the gain value A, by calculating the gradient
between the two well known peaks. This could be done by using the noted variables
to give,
E2  E1
Ch2  Ch1
(4.2)
, where E1 and E2 are the quoted energies of the  decay peaks, and Ch1 and
Ch2 are the centroid channel numbers of the uncalibrated spectra. By rearranging
Eqn. 4.1.1 and substituting in the values of A, E and Ch for one of the peaks the
offset can be calculated using;
B = E  (A Ch) (4.3)
. The calculated A and B values were then entered into the analysis code to be
able to calibrate all of the data files. This process had to be repeated while working
through the data files due to the calibration shifting as the runs progressed.
The  decay energies were determined using the first set of 196At files that were
obtained in May 2011 (containing 13 files). The resulting fitted spectrum is shown
in Fig 4.1 where all 13 of the run files have been used to increase the statistics. The
plot (b) in Fig. 4.1 shows the error on the fit as,
residual =
(number of counts number in fit)
number of counts
(4.4)
. Two methods were trialled for fitting the spectra. The first was using an
interactive program, whereby the peaks were identified by selecting the limits by
clicking on the plot. The background of the plot was also selected in this manner.
The peaks were then fitted with a Gaussian function using these limits and the
selected limits of background. This allowed the background to be taken into account
4.1. Calibration of the - and -Decay Spectra 58
Figure 4.1: -decay energy spectrum for 196At taken at HRS showing the tails fitting
procedure that was used. This spectrum uses all 13 run files from the first set of
data files. A similar plot is shown in Fig. 6.1 (b), but for only the first 6 run files
as will be explained.
4.2. Efficiency of the silicon detectors 59
with the fit. The information obtained from using this method included the centroid
value, FWHM and content of the peak. The second method, and the one which was
used to determine the energy of the peaks, was a called a tails fit. In this method,
the limits of the peaks were inputted as part of a code, along with the limits for
a boundary background region. In this fit however, the tails of the  decay peaks
are also taken into consideration. This accounts for the shape of the peak and
an overlap that is seen between peaks. The fit therefore provides a more accurate
representation of the shape of the peak. The second fit is demonstrated in Fig. 4.1.
Using the fitted spectrum information, a plot was produced to detail the energies
of the peaks as found by the HRS runs, see Fig. A.1 in Appendix A. Again, in this
instance, all 13 files and the data from Si1 and Si2 were used.
4.1.2  Calibration
To calibrate the HPGe detectors, standard calibration sources were used to produce
calibration spectra. Four calibration sources were used, 137Cs, 60Co, 133Ba and
152Eu. Using the standard source spectra, the HPGe detectors were calibrated using
a similar method to that described above.
4.2 Efficiency of the silicon detectors
The efficiency of the silicon detectors was calculated by V. Liberati (see [58] for
details) using the Geant Monte Carlo simulation program. This gave geometrical
efficiencies plots for the Si1 and Si2 detectors. Recent work by colleagues at Leuven
[78] discovered that the measured absolute efficiencies were lower by a factor of 2.
However the absolute value of the Si detector efficiency is not used in the deriva-
tion of the branching ratios in this work, see Section 6.3. In order to determine
experimentally the absolute efficiency the following method was used. 241Am has
the advantage of being an  emitter (used to calibrate the silicon detectors) and
emits a 60 keV -ray (can be used for the HPGe detectors). Therefore to calculate
the absolute efficiency the ratio was taken between the number of  coincidences
and the number of  counts. This gave efficiencies of  9(1) % for Si1 and 15(1) %
for Si2.
4.3. Efficiency of the HPGe Detectors 60
4.3 Efficiency of the HPGe Detectors
To determine the absolute photopeak efficiency of the HPGe detectors to different
 ray energies, the efficiency of the each of the  rays emitted by the standard
calibration sources was calculated. These were then plotted to produce an efficiency
curve. An experimental data point was also plotted using the 192Bi 184 keV  ray.
The efficiency was calculated from;
N,tot
(4.5)
, where N is the number of counts seen and N,tot is the total number of -rays
emitted. To determine N the number of counts is taken from a fit of the peak in
the spectrum. To calculate the total number of -rays emitted N,tot, the activity
of the source needed to be calculated for the date when the data was collected. A
correction was applied to account for the time that had passed between the source
being produced and calibrated at the factory and being used at the experimental run.
The original and calculated activities are given in Table 4.1. Using the calculated
values, the activity of each of the -rays from the sources were corrected for their
branching. The efficiency for the experimental data point was calculated from,
(1 + total) (4.6)
, where N is the number of   coincidences, N is the number of counts in
the related -decay peak and total is the conversion coefficient taken from [72].
The calibration curve produced is shown in Fig. 4.2. This graph includes a
point calculated from the 184 keV  transition of 192Bi, as the multipolarity of this
transition is already well known. This multipolarity and the calculation of those for
196At transitions will be discussed further in Section 6.3.1.
As can been seen from Fig. 4.2, some of the points do not sit where expected.
This graph has been constructed from different calibration source sets which are
indicated by the different coloured points.
4.4 Analysis Code
The data were collected as .bin files which were converted to .root files through
the use of a C++ analysis code. The code was originally developed by a previous
member of the collaboration then further developed by V Liberati [58]. The use

of this code allowed all analysis to take place and produce all the relevant spectra.
Any required modifications to the code were made by the author of this thesis.
4.4.1 Rassmussen Code
To calculate the -decay reduced widths, a Fortran 90 code was utilised. The code is
based on the work by Rassmussen [67, 115]. The code was modified to take account
of branching, and the intensity of the particular  decay. The modification to the
code was carried out as part of this PhD work. The new version of the code will
now be used for the calculations of reduced - decay widths from all future data.
Chapter 5
Schmitt Calibration for Fission
Events
As was mentioned in Section 3.2.1, silicon detectors suffer from an effect called Pulse
Height Defect (PHD) when detecting high mass particles like fission fragments. PHD
is the difference in energy between the actual energy of the incoming (in this case)
fission fragment, and the energy registered by the detector when calibrated using 
particles. There are three main contributors to the energy loss in PHD.
The first, is the energy loss by the fragment as it passes through the entrance
window or dead layer of the detector. The amount of energy lost will be dependent
on the thickness of the entrance window or dead layer. The second reason is that
the fission fragments travel at lower velocities near the end of the track, which
means nuclear collisions become important. These lead to recoil nuclei, which also
have low velocities, reducing the probability of electronic collisions occurring. This
reduces the efficiency of electron-hole pair production, which in turn, reduces the
energy collected by the detector (known as non-ionising collisions). Linked into these
reasons, and therefore rate, of energy loss is the stopping power of the medium. This
can be described by the Bethe-Bloch formula normally given as,
4ZNA
 ln(1 2) 2
(5.1)
, where dE
is the rate of energy loss per unit length,  = c the ion velocity, ze the
electronic charge, m is the mass of the electron, NA Avagadros number, A and Z the
atomic mass and atomic number of the material, and  the density of the stopping
material [6]. For particles with velocities much less than  then the formula can be
simplified to,
4ZNA
(5.2)
, where the symbols have the same meaning, except now v is used to indicate the
particles velocity. Thirdly, it is expected that there is a high rate of electron-hole
recombination in the plasma that is created along the fission fragment track. This
effect should be reduced by an increase in bias voltage, however this has a limit or
electrical breakdown of the detector can occur. Therefore by creating a high electric
field, this should help minimise this third contributor [110]. This means that it is not
possible to perform a linear calibration similar to the one used for the  particles.
A particular method for calibration was therefore developed by Schmitt et al. [116],
and further improved upon by Weissenberger et al. [117].
As seen in Section 4.1.1, typically the calibration equation can be written in the
form,
E = C1x+ C2 (5.3)
, where x is the pulse height, E is the energy and C1 and C2 are constants. There
is still a linear relationship for the fission fragments, but now that relationship leads
to a mass dependence on the constants. The equation can be re-written as,
E = (a+ a
M)x+ b+ b
M (5.4)
, where, like in Eqn. 5.3, x is the pulse height and E is the energy. In Eq. 5.4,
the constants a, a
, b, and b
relate to the detector itself and M is the mass of the
ion. In order to calculate this set of constants, the mean pulse heights of light and
heavy fragments from a reference fission fragment spectrum are used [28]. In order
to calculate these values Weissenberger defined them as [117]
a = A/(PL  PH) (5.5)
/(PL  PH) (5.6)
b = B  aPL (5.7)
PL (5.8)
. The constants A, A
, B and B
are specific for a fissioning isotope. Values were
calculated for these constants by both Schmitt et al. [116] and Weissenberger et
al. [117]. New values were calculated by L. Ghys and were listed in a collaboration
report [118].
The calibration was performed at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble.
In this case, fission fragments from the 235U(n,f) reaction were used. The fission
fragments can then be separated using their mass-to-charge ratio (A/q) and their
energy-to-charge ratio (E/q) [118].
However, both the energy and mass of the fragments are not known in Eqn. 5.4.
In order to solve this, extra equations are needed to form a system of equations.
To do this, the mass and momentum conservation laws are used. This gives the
equations:
E1 = (a1 + a
1m1)x1 + b1 + b
1m1, (5.9)
E2 = (a2 + a
2m2)x2 + b2 + b
2m2, (5.10)
1 = m
2 , (5.11)
Af = m
2 (5.12)
, where the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the Si1 and Si2 detectors, the  represents
the values before any neutron emission and Af is the mass of the fissioning nuclide
[28]. Using this method only coincident fragments can be used, as the values need
to be inserted simultaneously into the above equations. The energy and mass values
before and after possible neutron emission are related. This relationship is formed
from the energy losses that the fragment will experience. This allows the initial
energy (Ei ) and mass (m
i ) as;
Ei = Ei + Ei, + Ei,cf + Ei,dl, (5.13)
mi = mi + i (5.14)
, where Ei, is the energy taken away by neutron emission, Ei,cf is the energy
lost in the carbon foil and Ei,dl is the energy lost in the dead layer of the detector.
This value is already taken into account in the previous calibration constants if the
fragments are detected at the same angle as where the constants were calculated.
To calculate the energy that is lost to any neutrons, the method by Balagna et al.
[119] was implemented by Elsevier et al. [28], giving the set of equations;

solve these equations and produce calibrated fission spectra. This still required the
calculation and input of all the variables. The code, however, was modified from
the layout of equations given in [28]. Instead of explicitly stating the energy lost to
any neutrons, the terms for the variables B and C were each divided by Fi. Table
5.1 shows the variable values that were inputted for each detector.
The b
i and bi are calculated values pertaining to the detectors themselves and
were calculated from the experiments at ILL. The a
i and ai value were calculated
using both information from ILL and the  calibration value from these experiments.
This can be represented as;
AIS534 =
aIS534
(5.22)
, where A is equivalent to ai and A
can be calculated in the same manner which
then represents a
i. The xi values are not included in the table as they were extracted
by the program. The values for the carbon foils and 196At were calculated by S. Sels
[120] using the SRIM program. The astatine ions are implanted into the carbon
foils, which are 20 g/cm2, or 888 A, thick. The SRIM calculation was re-run as
part of this work with the implantation depth shown in Fig. 5.1.
The energy loss relevant to each detector is different due to the depth of foil the
fission fragments need to escape from. An energy loss therefore had to be calculated
separately for each detector. As the ion of interest, 98Mo is used as this represents
the symmetrical fission fragment from 196Po. The energy value used is  74 MeV as
this represents half the average TKE. This results in energy loss values of 0.3 MeV
for the fission fragments travelling towards Si1 and 1.1 MeV for fission fragments
travelling towards Si2.
To calculate the actual energy that was lost, the sum of all sources of energy loss
was taken to give total values of 1.1 MeV and 1.9 MeV for Si1 and Si2 respectively
[121]. These values were used in the final calculations.

shows how far the fission fragments will need to travel to escape the carbon foil, and
therefore how much energy they will lose.

 Decay Results of 196At
6.1 Alpha Decay
In comparison to the data of HRS, approximately 50 times more  decays of 196At
were collected in Experiment II at GPS but the quality of data and extracted infor-
mation is very different. As will be shown below, due to the availability of HPGe
detectors and the much cleaner spectra obtained during the HRS experiment, ex-
periment I data were used in the data analysis for fine-structure -decay studies and
for the deduction of the  and -branching ratios for 196At. The GPS data however,
being more abundant, was used for the DF investigation. A summary of the HRS
and GPS experiments are given in Table 6.1, while further details of the calibrated
spectra can be found in Section 4.1.1 and Appendix A.
Figs. 6.1(a,b) show part of the energy spectra measured in Si1 and Si2 for the
GPS and HRS runs, respectively. As seen in Fig. 6.1(a), there is mass contamination
from the  decays of the heavier 197201At isotopes. In this spectrum only the main
peak of 196At (6.22107 counts) is seen, with no fine structure decays visible. This
is due to the lower mass-resolving power and, possibly, a non-optimal GPS tuning
in Experiment II. Despite being strongly suppressed by GPS, these masses still
weakly leaked through the separator due to their much larger production yields in
comparison with 196At. In contrast to this, due to the higher resolving power of HRS
and the use of extra slits in the respective beam line of ISOLDE, these contaminants
are fully absent in the experiment at HRS, see Fig. 6.1(b), which corresponds to 30
min of data collection when the HPGe detectors were connected. As will be seen,
only the  decays of 196At, and of its daughter products, 192Bi (after  decay) and
196Po (after  decay) are present.

Fig. 6.1 (b) clearly shows seven -decay peaks including the main 7053(9) keV
peak (which has been mentioned in past literature see Section 1.3.2), and a previ-
ously identified fine structure peak. This has an energy value of 6746(9) keV and
has been seen recently in a study by Kalaninova [48]. The other two peaks however
were previously unobserved. They have energies of 6644(11) keV and 6854(9) keV
and are attributed to the fine structure decay of 196At as will be shown. Also present
on the plot are the  decay daughter 196Po at 6521(9) keV and the  decay daughter
192Bi at 6063(9) keV and 6244(10) keV. The intensities of the peaks were also cal-

culated for each of the  decay peaks, and this information (along with branching)
was used to calculate the reduced  widths of the peaks. A summary of these peaks
and those seen in the previous studies can be found in Table 6.2.
The HPGe detectors were only connected for six of the run files. Therefore any
   analysis only used these files to ensure that any calculated values were not
distorted, due to a larger number of  decays not corresponding to the  counts.
The HRS spectrum shown in Fig. 6.1 (b) therefore reflects this reduction in the
number of files.
Unfortunately, the HPGe detectors could not be connected during the GPS run.
The detectors were calibrated and set-up but it was found that the dead time was
too large to obtain anything useful from the detectors. The rate on Ge1 was noted
to reach 8 kHz while sitting in position. An attempt was also made to connect the
detectors for the 194At run but rates were still > 2.5kHz and almost all the peaks
were suffering from summing.
Fig. 6.1(c) shows the  coincidences for the  decays from panel (b), within a
600 ns coincidence time interval. The strongest 7053 keV  decay of 196At would not
be expected to have any coincident events, therefore the small number of coincident
events in the broad range of -ray energies is considered as random. Four areas of

could be seen. This was drawn by plotting all events in Ge1 against all events in

coincidences.
interest are marked by G1, G2, G3 and G4 in Fig. 6.1(c). The projections on
the -energy axis from these three regions are shown in Fig. 6.6(a), (b), (c) and (d).
From the HRS run, a    matrix was produced, as shown in Fig. 6.2. The
matrix was created as a 2D histogram, by plotting the events from Ge1 against those
from Ge2. Although coincidences were looked for, there were none apparent in the
matrix, probably because of the low number of counts, and no timing conditions
being applied. The spectrum recorded by Ge1 (directly behind Si2) is shown in
Fig. 6.3. There are strong lines at energies 70.3(1), 80.3(1) keV which are likely to
be X-rays, and three  rays at energies 368.1(1), 426.1(1) and 439.6(1) keV. It is
unclear which nuclides these belong to. The energies of interest are marked on the
-ray energy spectrum where they correspond to  ray coincidence event energies.
To reduce the number of random counts, timing conditions were applied to the
coincidences. Areas of coincidences were chosen to examine the timing structure.

energies of the coincident  transitions which are shown by the arrows. The energies
in brackets are for the strong  transitions that are present in the spectrum. The
nuclides to which they belong are not known.
This was carried out to confirm if the coincidences came from  rays or X-rays.
Examples of the timing structures for each are shown in Fig. 6.4 and Fig. 6.5.
The  ray has a well defined time structure whereas the X-ray does not. This
can be seen in Fig. 6.4 and Fig. 6.5. Where the  timing structure has a peak,
showing the  rays are prompt, the X ray structure does not have this single peak,
indicating that the emission of X rays does not have the same prompt signal as 
rays. This structure could also be caused by the properties of the HPGe detectors
themselves. At low energies, the timing properties of HPGe detectors for low energy
events becomes worse due to the electrical field not being as defined. This is because
for low energy rays, the interactions will take place near the surface of the detector.
This confirmed that the low energy coincidences were X-rays. The X-rays seen are
likely to be either characteristic X-rays from the lead shielding, or possibly caused
by the emission of the alpha particle ionising the atom. Using these plots as a guide

It can be seen that the timing has a peak value after which the peak falls away as
time increases.
it was determined that an ideal timing interval between the  particle and the  ray
was 600 ns. The differences in spectra, depending on applied time gate, can be seen
in Appendix B.
Both Fig. 6.1(c) and Fig. 6.6(a) show the known coincidences between the
6060(5)-keV  decay of 192Bi and the 184 keV E1 -ray transition in the daugh-
ter 188Tl [122], see decay scheme in Fig. 6.7. As expected, no coincident events are
seen for the full-energy 6244-keV  decay of 192Bi. By comparing the number of
192Bi single  decays in Fig. 6.1(b) and coincident 6060-184 keV events in Fig. 6.6(a),
the absolute -ray efficiency at 184 keV was deduced as 10(1) % (see Section 4.3
for method). This value was used to normalize the -ray efficiency calibration curve
produced with the use of the standard -ray sources.
Starting with the 6746 keV  decay peak, it was determined to be in coincidence
with the 115.7(3) keV, 185.4(2) keV, 199.9(1) keV, 221.1(4) keV and 316.1(13) keV
 lines. For all  transition values, the actual energy with error will be given the first

time it is mentioned, thereafter rounded values will be used. The coincident events
of 6746  316 keV have a Q,tot=Q(6746)+E(316) value that is consistent with
the 7053 keV decay. This establishes an excited state at 316 keV in 192Bi. Based
on the observation of the 6732(8) keV fine structure  decay of 196At, the study by
Kalaninova et al. [48] proposed the existence of the 320(10) keV excited state in
192Bi. However, due to low statistics, no respective  rays were observed. The 200
keV and 116 keV  rays are also in coincidence with the 6746 keV decay and the 
ray energies sum to 316 keV. Therefore the 116 and 200 keV transitions are placed in
a cascade parallel to the 316 keV decay, with the 116-keV  ray feeding the 200 keV
state. It can be seen in Fig. 6.6(b) that the intensities of the 116-keV and 200-keV 
rays strongly differ, which is explained by the difference in their internal conversion,
after the difference in the calculated respective detection efficiencies were allowed
for (relative error of 8%), see Section 6.3.1.
The weak 6644 keV  decay forms an excited state at 409(11) keV in 192Bi.
However, a full energy  ray transition is not seen in this work. It is in coincidence

with the 200 and 221 keV, and tentatively with the weak 152.5(8) keV  decays as
seen in Fig. 6.6. The existence of the 200 and 221 keV coincidences, requires the
presence of a 209(11) and 188(11) keV transition. These are shown as dashed lines
in the decay scheme and as are yet unobserved. The 221 keV is in coincidence with
both the 6644 keV and 6746 keV fine structure  decays. This fact suggests that an
excited state at 221 keV should be present in 192Bi, possibly feeding directly to the
-decaying state in this nucleus. This level has therefore been tentatively placed in
the decay scheme in Fig. 6.7. The observation of 6746-221 keV coincidences also
requires the presence of a (yet unobserved) 95 keV decay from the 316 keV state to
the 221 keV state. The weak 185 keV decay was not placed in the decay scheme
of 196At  192Bi. The 6854 keV  decay is in coincidence with the 200 keV with
a Q,tot=Q(6854)+E(200) value which is deemed to be in good agreement within
error of the Q value of the full energy peak of 7053 keV. The 6854 keV  decay was
therefore assigned as feeding the 200 keV level. The    plots for each  decay
are shown in Fig. 6.6(a, c, e, g). The corresponding  projections are shown in Fig.
6.6 (b, d, f, h).
6.2 Half-lives
Different methods were used in order to deduce the half-lives of 196Po and 196At. As
196Po has a known half-life in seconds, the decay data from the Si3 and Si4 decay
detectors were used. Since there is no beam implantation at the decay detector site,
any data here will only be the decay of 196Po. By plotting the decay curve of the
polonium, an exponential curve was fitted. The decay curve and fit are shown in Fig
6.8. The half-life was determined by using only one detector, then by plotting both
detectors together. The final half-life was taken to be as (T1/2) = 5.8(1) s which
is in agreement with, but more precise, than the previous values of 5.5(5) s [123],
5.8(2) s [124] and 5.8(2) s [125].
To determine the half-life of 196At, the data from HRS was used due to the
contaminant products in the GPS data. From the literature, 196At is known to have
a half-life in the order of hundreds of ms. The astatine will therefore decay fully
in the carbon foil at the position of the implantation detectors. Since there will be
implantations occurring at the same time as decays, it is not possible to simply fit
an exponential to the decay curve, as seen in the case of 196Po. By plotting the
decay of 196At, it becomes apparent that the decay is a series of grow and decay
peaks, that replicate the timings of the proton pulses. To find the half-life the

total 356(6) 360(5) 358(5)
grow and decay method therefore needs to be used, as fully described in [29]. As
a brief overview, the grow and decay method is when the structure of each proton
pulse peak is drawn. It is the shape of this peak that gives the method its name. As
implantation is occurring, then the peak grows from the alpha events being recorded.
Once implantation stops, then only the decay curve remains until the next proton
pulse arrives. This is why there must be sufficient time between proton pulses, as
otherwise, the decay curve from the previous pulse may not have fully decayed before
growing again.
The timing plot produced is shown in Fig. 6.9 where the pulses are 1.2 s apart.
It can be seen that if the proton pulses are in succession, there is not enough
time to fully decay before the peak grows again with the next implantation. It is
therefore not possible to fit to these peaks. Instead, peaks are chosen where there is
a large enough time gap to fully decay. By fitting these peaks, the half-life can be
determined. The peaks can also be shifted when calculating the half-lives to give a
higher number of counts in each peak. Shifting the peaks only works if the timings
of groups of peak are exactly the same.
Although the half-life of the main peak in 196At is taken as the overall half-life,
the half-life for each of the astatine peaks was also calculated. Table 6.3 gives the
values that were calculated and which peaks were used for each. The half-lives of
the fine structure peaks are in good agreement with each other and previous values
from the literature (if known), see Table 6.2. The overall half-life can be given as
the main peaks half-life due to the dominance of this peak. The errors are higher on
the smaller fine structure peaks due to lack of statistics which meant it was harder
to obtain a neat fit.
6.3. Branching Ratios 80
6.3 Branching Ratios
In order to calculate the branching ratio, the following formula was used,
196At) =
196At)
N(196At) +N(196At)
(6.1)
, where N and N are the number of  and  decays of the relevant nuclide
respectively. The number of  decays cannot be seen directly and are therefore
deduced from the number of 196Po  decays and the b of
196Po. The term N can
be re-written as,
196At) = N(196Po) =
196Po)
1 b(196Po)
(6.2)
. To deduce these values the data from the HRS experiments were used. Al-
though there were more counts available in the GPS data, as seen in Section 6.1, the
 spectrum for the HRS data is much cleaner for determining the number of counts
in the relevant peaks. Before being able to find the number of counts, files needed
to be selected that had the same supercycle (SC) structure. As will be explained
later, the structure of the SC needs to be considered and therefore it is not possible
to use files which have different structures. On examination of the files used for the
energy determination, it was discovered that only three of these files appeared to
have the same structure. Only these files were therefore used for the branching.
Firstly, the total number of 196At needed to be determined. This was done by
fitting the four 196At  decay peaks (as done in Appendix A ) then taking the
number of counts and associated error, and totalling the four values. By using the
previous fitting method, a background is already included in the fit and therefore
does not need to be calculated separately. The time over which the -decay energy
spectrum is drawn will be explained later when discussing the 196Po.
Secondly, the number of 196Po decays needed to be calculated. As the number
of  decays cannot be measured directly, the number had to be inferred from the
number of  decays of 196Po seen, with multiple corrections. Since it is possible
for 196Po to be produced directly in this experiment, a measure of the amount of
directly produced 196Po was needed. This was found by running a file during which
the lasers were tuned on the ionisation of astatine and with the resonant transition
laser blocked. As no 196Po could therefore be from the  decay of 196At, any 196Po
decays that were seen had to be produced directly. The laser off file was run for
1495s and 34(6) counts were seen, evidence indicating its direct production in the
6.3. Branching Ratios 81
target by surface ionisation in the ion source. Since the laser on file was run for
3503s, this number of counts needed to be scaled. With a scaling factor of 2.34, the
number of directly produced counts were 80(14). This amount of directly-produced
196Po was estimated as 0.43% of the total 196Po  decays measured in the HRS
run and was subtracted from the total number of counts in the 196Po peak.
The 196Po has a half-life of  6s. It will therefore not only decay at the implan-
tation detectors position, but also at the decay detectors position. The number of
decays in the decay detectors can be found by determining the number of counts
in the 196Po decay peaks. There is however a consideration to be made. When the
first supercycle (SC) starts, the foil will be at the implantation position. When the
supercycle ends, the wheel rotates and the foil moves to the decay position. The
implanted/decay counts in Si3 and Si4 associated with SC 1, are actually collected
during SC 2. This is shown in Fig 6.11.
From Fig. 6.11, it can also been seen that a similar problem will occur at the
end of a run. If after a number N of SCs the data acquisition system is stopped, the
decay counts from SC N will actually be in SC N + 1 which is not being recorded.
To mitigate against this problem, not only did files that had the same number of
SCs require to be used, but the times of the 1st, 2nd, last and 2nd last SCs needed
to be found. This meant that time conditions could be placed upon the  decay
energy spectrum for the implantation and decay detectors, and only the SCs where
both the parts were present were plotted. This gives 2680(52) decay counts in the
decay detector position. During the movement of the foil between the two positions,
the 196Po will still be decaying, but these decays will not be recorded. The number
of missed decays needs to be calculated.
Firstly, the time structure from the 196Po decay in Si2 was drawn over one SC.
This represented all the  decays that were seen in a particular SC. Secondly, the
time structure for the 196Po in Si3 was drawn on the same plot. To draw this
structure however, several considerations needed to be made. Depending on which
of the SC is drawn for the implantation detector, then the following SC needs to be
drawn for the decay structure. The time structure will need to be time shifted on
the axis as not only did the decay occur after implantation, but the time taken for
the windmill to turn also needs to be included. This will give a gap between the
two time structures which represents the missing counts.
In this case, the two time structures did not match and therefore a scaling factor
had to be introduced. The scaling factor was deduced by fitting the beginning of the
decay curve in Si3 to the end of Si2. Since the plots have been scaled, the difference

calculate the branching ratio. The manner in which each of these numbers is applied
is described in the text.

in counts also needs to be accounted for. This is found by taking the difference in
counts between the two integrals of the fits on Si2 and Si3. This number will be
subtracted from the total. The number of counts missed by the movement of the
windmill was calculated using the approximate geometry of the shape of the gap.
The gap can roughly be split into a rectangle and a triangle.
The number of counts missing from the rectangle can be calculated by multiply-
ing the number of bins in the gap along the x-axis, by the number of counts that
give the height of the start of Si3. The number of counts in the triangle can be
calculated by multiplying the difference in height of the end and start of Si2 and Si3
by the number of bins and halving the number. Adding these two values together
will give the number of counts missed due to the movement of the windmill. The
final plot that is produced is shown in Fig. 6.12.
The last correction to be considered is the branching ratio of the 196Po, b(
196Po)
= 94(5)% [125]. Only the  decay of the 196Po is detected which means the number
of  decays of the 196Po need to be calculated to have the total number of 196Po.
The numbers used in the branching ratio calculation are shown in Table 6.4.
Once all corrections have been accounted for, the branching ratio could then be
be calculated. Firstly the total number of 196At is found by totalling the integral
values from all four of the 196At peaks. This gives a total of  535000 counts.
Secondly the number of 196Po decays using the corrections noted above in Table 6.4
is found from,
No. of 196Po = a  b + c + d  e 
b(196At)
(6.3)
6.3. Branching Ratios 83
, where a is the integral from the implantation detector, b is direct production
counts, c is the integral from the decay detector, d is the movement of the windmill
and e is the scaling factor for the decay detector. Therefore the branching ratio can
be be calculated as,
N(196Po)
Ntotal
(6.4)
. The experimental branching ratios of b = 2.6(2)% and b = 97.4(2)% were
deduced for the first time for 196At.
6.3.1 Multipolarities
Before calculating the multipolarities of the 196At  transitions, the process was
first tested using the    coincidence from 192Bi. This multipolarity is already
well-known as an E1 [122]. The method of calculation could therefore be tested to
ensure that the expected answer was found.
To calculate the multipolarities, the generic expression:
(1 + tot) (6.5)
, was used where N is the number of  decays for a specific  line in the singles
spectrum (see Fig. 6.1 (b)), N is the respective number of    coincidences
observed in Fig. 6.1 (c),  is the detector efficiency at a specific energy, and tot is
the total conversion coefficient of the respective  ray.
The -ray transitions that are coincident with the fine structure  decay of 196At
are all prompt, which limits their multipolarity to E1, M1, or E2. Based on the
estimation of the total conversion coefficients total, it is possible to deduce more
precisely the multipolarity for the 200, 116 and 316 keV decays.
As seen in Fig. 6.7 the 316 keV level, which is fed by the 6746 keV decay, de-
excites through the cascade of 200 and 116-keV transitions and also by a weak cross
over full energy 316 keV decay. This allows the intensity balance (see Eqn. 6.3.1)
between the feeding 6746 keV  decay and the following de-excitation, by accounting
for the coincident 116 and 200 keV decays. The latter requires that their intensities

. As part of the intensity balance according to Eqn. 6.3.1, the intensity of the
observed Bi K-X rays in Fig. 6.6 (c), provides a further constraint on the possible
multipolarities. Therefore, to deduce the total conversion coefficients (thus, multi-
polarities) and the possible mixing ratios for the 116 and 200 keV  rays, the number
of N(6746) = 1783(43) counts from Fig. 6.1 (b) corrected for X-ray contribution
needed to be used. The corrected values for each  ray using Eqn. 6.3.1 are given
in Table 6.5.
Based on the values of N(6746-200)=88 cts and N(6746-116)=23 cts taken
from Fig. 6.1 (b) and corrected for the relevant  efficiencies, the total experimental
conversion coefficients of tot using Eqn. 6.3.1 were calculated as tot(116)=5.6(5)
and tot(200)=1.05(1). The comparison with the calculated total conversion coef-
ficients from [72] as seen in Table 6.5 suggests mixing of M1+E2 for both 116 and
200 keV  rays, with the likely mixing ratio being 50(5)% for them both. Therefore
the most likely multipolarity for the 316 keV transition is likely to be E2, due to
the mixing of the cascade  rays. To show that this method is correct, the number
of X-rays can be calculated to confirm that the number seen, is reproduced. In this
case (since they are K X-rays) the k value is used instead.
6.4 Discussion
From the results found in the previous sections, a new decay scheme for 196At was
produced, Fig. 6.7. Although both of the long-lived states of the  daughter are
shown, from the  plot in Fig. 6.1 (c) it is clear that only the I=(3+) -decaying
state in 192Bi, resulting from the [h9/2  p3/2] configuration is populated. This is
because only the coincident 6060-184 keV events are seen. The spin/parity states
that are assigned to the 192Bi are tentative values based on  decay systematics.
This is fully discussed in [122].
In order to build the decay scheme, the  decay energies were taken first. From
both the  decay spectra and the    spectra, the main  decay peak of energy

6.4. Discussion 86
7053 keV is believed to be the ground state to ground state transition. Placing
this in the decay scheme establishes the Q value of the system. To assign a spin
to the ground state of 196At, then based on the fact that the decay appears to be
unhindered (2=26.6(20) keV), then the same spin of I
=(3+) and configuration of
[h9/2  p3/2] should be assigned. This assignment was also suggested in the work
by Kalaninova et al. [48]. The reduced width values for all of the  decays were
calculated with the assumption of L = 0 and the results of an output file for 196At
are given in Appendix C.
Taking each of the fine structure  decays in turn, they, and their coincident 
rays can be placed into the decay scheme. The 6854 keV  decay is in coincidence
with the 200 keV  ray and by summing the Q and E values, then within error,
is equivalent to the full energy  decay peak. This therefore establishes an excited
state at 200 keV. The 200 keV is also in coincidence with the 6746 keV, and 6644
keV  decays. Taking the 6746 keV  decay first, it has a difference from the 7053
keV peak of 307 keV. On the    plot no coincidences were seen at this energy,
as noted in Section 6.1 there are coincident events with a 116 keV and 316 keV.
Since the 200 keV has already been placed in the scheme, the 316 keV establishes
an excited state at 316 keV where both the 316 keV and the 116 keV originate. The
116 keV decays to the 200 keV state forming a cascade. There is also a 185 and
221 keV which are in coincidence with the 6746 keV  decay. The 185 keV has not
yet been placed in the decay scheme due to uncertainty of where it should be. The
221 keV is also seen in coincidence with the 6644 keV. This establishes an excited
state at 221 keV. If this state exists, then this requires the existence of a 95 keV
transition from the 316 keV excited state. This has been tentatively added to the
decay scheme.
Aside from the 200 and 221 keV  rays, the 6644 keV was not seen to be coinci-
dence with any other  rays. However, the nature of the 6644 keV itself establishes
an excited state at 409 keV. Therefore, a 188 and 209 keV have been tentatively
placed in the decay scheme. It could also be expected that there will be a full en-
ergy  transition of 409 keV, but this also has not been seen. The 6644 keV is also
tentatively in coincidence with a weak 152 keV. This has not been placed in the
decay scheme. It is hoped that with more statistics, the placing of these  rays can
not only be verified but that those which are tentative can be firmly said to be seen,
and the expected  rays are also seen.
As seen from the decay scheme, tentative spins/parities have been assigned to
the excited states of 192Bi. Based on the deduced -ray multipolarities for the 116
6.4. Discussion 87
(M1+E2), 200 (M1+E2) and 316 (E2) keV transitions, a spin/parity of 2+-4+ is
assigned to the 200 keV state, and a range of spins 1+5+ for the state at 316
keV. The specific choice for the 316 keV however will also depend on the value
of the M1+E2 multipolarity assignment for the 116 keV decay. To assist in the
assignments, the hindrance factors of the  decays that feed into these states can
also be used.
The much smaller reduced -decay width for the fine structure 6644 and 6854
keV  decays indicate their hindered nature, with hindrance factors of 22(6) and
74(1), respectively relative to the 7053 keV decay. Especially for the 6854 keV de-
cay, its relatively large hindrance factor cannot be explained by only the presumed
small angular momentum change of L=2 between the (3+) parent and (2+/4+)
daughter state at 200 keV. This suggests that a change of configuration may also
be required. However the decay to the 316 keV state has a relatively small hin-
drance factor of 4.2(5), if a L=0 decay is considered. This is close to the accepted
definition of unhindered decays (HF<4). If instead a L=2 decay was considered
(due to deduced E2 multipolarity for the 316 keV transition), then an even smaller
hindrance factor of HF = 2.5(3) would be obtained. The 6746 keV decay appears
to only have a small configuration change between the parent and daughter states.
In order to check the placings of  transitions it was also possible to calculate
the intensity ratios of the  rays. The decay of the 316 keV excited state in 192Bi
proceeds via the 316-keV E2 or the 116 keV mixed M1+E2  ray transitions. A
theoretical ratio of I(116)/I(316)= 100 for the intensities of the 116 and 316 keV
decays was estimated according to the Weiskopf half-life estimates from Firestone
[64], assuming M1 and E2 multipolarities respectively. The calculated value from
the data however was found to be  12 (see Appendix D) which also indicates that
mixing is occurring.
The half-life value that was determined for 196Po is consistent with its quoted
value in literature. For the 196At, the value that was used was that of the main 196At
peak. The half-lives for each of the fine structure peaks was calculated individually,
with the values being of the same magnitude as the main peak.

DF of 196At
7.1 DF
The -delayed fission of 196At (fission of 196Po after  decay of 196At) has been
observed in both the experiments at HRS and GPS. Only 14 fission events were
observed in the HRS data and 284 events in the experiment at GPS. Therefore, in
the following analysis only the data from GPS is discussed. The energy spectrum
of single fission events that were observed in the GPS run, either in the Si1 or
in Si2 detectors, in the energy range 30 MeV - 90 MeV is shown in Fig. 7.1.
Out of 284 single fission events, 68 are coincident events, with both coincident
fragments travelling back-to-back, measured by Si1 and Si2. Fission fragment mass
distributions can only be deduced from the measured coincident events which have
been calibrated using the Schmitt method as discussed in Chapter 5. This method
was also applied in other studies carried out by the collaboration, in particular for
178,180Tl [126, 28], 194,196At and 202Fr [77].
Before continuing with the results from 196At, the results from 180Tl are shown.
These provide an ideal comparison for discussing the features of the DF.
Approximately four times the statistics were collected for 180Tl than for 196At,
including coincidence fission fragment-ray data. The two-dimensional Si1-Si2 co-
incidence plot for DF of 180Tl in Fig. 7.2, shows two distinct clusters of points,
clearly demonstrating the asymmetric fission of the daughter (after  decay) isotope
180Hg. The TKE plot, Fig. 7.3 shows a single Gaussian shape with the most prob-
able value of TKE(180Hg)=133.20(14) MeV and FWHM of 15.0(9) MeV [28]. This
proves that only one fission mode is present in 180Hg in this case. The total fission
fragment mass distribution, (black line) in Fig. 7.4 for 180Hg, clearly shows an asym-

metric distribution, with the most probable heavy and light fission fragment masses
of MH= 100(1) and ML = 80(1). In summary, all three plots clearly demonstrate
that in the DF of 180Tl only a single (asymmetric) fission mode is present.
In contrast to 180Tl it can be seen that, whereas the 180Tl data show two distinct
clusters in the 2D coincidence plot, a broad fission fragment area is observed for
196At, as seen in Fig. 7.6. Also, instead of a single Gaussian-like TKE distribution
observed for 180Hg, the TKE distribution for 196Po is much broader, suggesting that
fission does not occur by a single fission mode. Fitting the whole broader distribution
with a single Gaussian fit, gives the most probable value of TKE(196Po)=147(1) MeV
with FWHM of 24.2(9) MeV, see Fig. 7.5.
The points in Fig. 7.6 that have TKE values above and below the most probable
TKE values are shown by the blue and green colours, respectively.
The black solid line in Fig. 7.7 shows that 196At has a triple-humped mass
distribution, with the most probable fission fragment masses, deduced from the
Gaussian fit, being 88(2), 98(2) and 108(2), as seen in Fig. 7.7. Considering this

line.
information, along with the broader TKE distribution, gives convincing evidence
that at least two distinct fission modes are present in the fission of 196Po. The fission
fragment masses of ML = 88 and MH = 108 represent the light and heavy peaks
of the asymmetric mass distribution respectively, while the MS = 98 corresponds
to the symmetric mass distribution. As a second test, the 2 value was compared.
Based on the fit, this gave a 2 value of 1.331 and number of degrees of freedom as
2. Using a standard 2 table, the 20.05 value = 5.991. The fit 
2 value is less than
this, meaning this fit is likely to a 95% confidence level. As a comparison, Fig. 7.8
shows the same mass distribution, but in this case a single Gaussian has been fitted
to the distribution. Using the 2 values again, then the single Gaussian distribution
has a value of 50.58 and 20 degrees of freedom. This gives a 20.05 value of 31.410
making this fit unlikely.
The difference in fission modes of 196Po can further be investigated by examining
the mass distributions for events with the TKE values above and below the most
probable TKE. The distributions for 196Po are shown by the blue dotted lines and
solid green lines lines in Fig. 7.9. Notably, both the higher TKE and lower TKE mass
distributions have the same two-humped structure seen in case of 180Hg, which again

mass distributions would be the same shape.

confirms that only a single asymmetric fission mode is present in this nuclide. In
contrast to 180Hg, the fission fragments of 196Po with the higher TKE values, shown
by the blue colour, indicate a mainly symmetric mass split. The mass distribution
of events with the lower TKE values, shown by the green colour, appear to be a mix
of symmetric and asymmetric modes. This slight mixing of the asymmetric mode
to symmetric mass distribution (and vice versa) in the two distributions is probably
due to the selection procedure for fission events, based on the most probable TKE
value, leading to variations in the mass distributions.
In order to produce the calibration and the mass distribution plots, the starting
mass number had to be assessed by considering the possibility of neutron emission
before fission. The mass A = 196 was taken as the mass number of the fission-
ing 196Po nucleus. It was used since the neutron separation energy, Sn (
196Po) =
10490(40) keV, is above the QEC (
196At) = 9570(30) keV preventing neutron emis-
sion from 196Po after -decay of 196At. The emission of prompt neutrons from fission
fragments was taken into account, and from energy considerations, the maximum
number of neutrons that could be emitted is two per fission event. For the calibration
7.1. DF 101
process however, it was assumed that no prompt neutrons were emitted.
It was not possible to deduce the Z values of the fission fragments with the
current data. The most probable Z value was therefore deduced by assuming that
the N/Z ratio for the fissioning parent is approximately conserved for the fission
fragments as described by the unchanged charge distribution [127]. In this case for
196Po, the N/Z ratio = 1.33. A second method by which the Z values could have
been found would have been to use the minimum potential energy model [128]. It
can be simplified to Zf/Af = Z1/A1 = Z2/A2, however once one Z value is found
the other can be deduced by subtraction.
For the symmetric mass distribution, the most probable nuclide is 98Mo which
has a N/Z ratio = 1.33 and is stable. For the asymmetric mass distribution, the
masses which contribute most to the peaks are A = 88 and A = 108. Using the
same ratio method (N/Z), the Z values were deduced to be ZL = 38 and ZH = 46.
This gives possible identification of the fragments as 88Sr, which has a N/Z = 1.32
and 108Pd , N/Z = 1.35. Taking the average of these two ratios gives 1.34. Both of
these nuclei are stable.
The maximum number of neutrons that can be emitted in the fission of 196Po
can be estimated by comparing the calculated energy release Qfis(
196Po) with the
deduced average TKE. The calculated energy release values can be determined as,
Qfis(A,Z) = M(A,Z)M(A1, Z1)M(A2, Z2) (7.1)
, where A = A1 + A2, Z = Z1 + Z2, and M is the mass excess of the respective
nuclei. The maximum fission energy release (assuming no neutron emission) was
calculated for the symmetric component as,
Qfis(0n) = M(
196Po)M(98Mo)M(98Mo)
= 1348388114.888114.8
= 162776.6keV
= 162.78MeV (7.2)
. The maximum excitation energy of the two fission fragments can be calculated
7.1. DF 102
Emax,tot = QEC +Qfis(0n) TKE
= 9570 + 162776.6 147000
= 25346.6keV
= 25.35MeV (7.3)
. This available energy is shared between the two fission fragments, -rays and
any emitted neutrons. Unfortunately due to the HPGe detectors being disconnected
there is no  energy information. It is therefore not possible to state how much
energy the -rays will use. Looking at the neutron separation energy (Sn) of the
fragments, it can be determined if it is possible for neutron emission to occur.
Taking 98Mo , the neutron separation energy is Sn = 8.64 MeV. Multiplying this by
a factor of two, to account for the two fragments, gives a total energy of 17.28 MeV.
Although lower than the maximum energy available, the remaining energy may not
be enough to account for any -rays, or the kinetic energy of the neutrons. It is
therefore extremely unlikely that two neutrons will be emitted, but it is possible
that one neutron could be emitted.
For the possible fragments from the asymmetric mass distribution, the maximum
fission energy energy release is calculated using a similar method giving,
Qfiss(0)n = M(
196Po)M(88Sr)M(108Pd)
= 1348387921.489524.4
= 163962.8keV
= 163.96MeV (7.4)
. This gives the maximum available excitation energy of the fragments as
Emax,tot = QEC +Qfiss(0n) TKE
= 9570 + 163962.8 147000
= 26532.8keV
= 26.53MeV (7.5)
7.1. DF 103
. The neutron separation energies for the probable fission fragments are; Sn
(88Sr) = 11.11 MeV and Sn (
108Pd) = 9.22 MeV. This gives a total energy of 20.33
MeV which, when deducted from the total excitation energy, only leaves 6.2 MeV.
It is therefore likely that only one neutron emission could occur.
When the TKE was drawn, it became apparent that there seemed to be a high
and a low TKE. Fitting a Gaussian to the low and high sections gives values of
144.9(8) MeV for the low and 154.7(10) MeV for the high, leading to a difference of
 10 MeV between the average TKE of each section, when the values are rounded.
The split between the low and high appears to occur at  151 MeV. The 2 value
for fitting these two peaks was 9.019 with 8 degrees of freedom, leading to a 20.05
value of 15.507 making this likely. As a comparison for the single Gaussian fit, the
2 value was 22.25 with 14 degrees of freedom giving a 20.05 value of 23.685.
Compared to the mass distributions for the high and low TKE using the values of
147 MeV, Fig. 7.9 the mass distributions for using 151 MeV as the limit, Fig. 7.10,
produces a different mass distribution. This difference occurs in regard to the shape
and number of counts in the asymmetric and symmetric fission mass distributions.
Instead of mass distributions that are much more clearly split into symmetric and
asymmetric for high TKE and low TKE respectively, the 151 MeV mass distribution
are more mixed for both the high and low TKE.
For both the high and low TKE (using the 151 MeV split), the probable fission
fragments were deduced for all the coincidence events, in addition to those noted
above. Taking the high TKE first, the symmetric nuclide is identified to be 98Mo.
The same calculations were applied, but this time the Emax.tot value = 21.34 MeV.
Assuming that two neutrons in total are emitted, their energy will sum to be 17.28
MeV. Since the separation does not leave 8 MeV when subtracted from the total
available, it is unlikely that two neutrons would be emitted.
Considering the low TKE value, the asymmetric pair is 88Sr, 108Pd. Although
Fig. 7.10 does indicate a second pairing, in this section they are considered to be
caused by the binning of the plot. This pairing of 88Sr, 108Pd has already been
calculated, but with the change in TKE energy the total energy available is now
Emax,tot = 22.53 MeV. In this case  8 MeV is not available, which means two
neutron emission is again not possible in this case. The mass and energy information
for the two TKE values are summarised in Table 7.1.
For completeness, the TKE for 1 and 2 neutron emission have been briefly looked
at. Using the same analysis as previously, the average over the whole TKE for 1n
emission was taken to give a value of 147.5(14) MeV. For 2n emission, the mean
7.1. DF 104

TKE is 147.8(16) MeV. A fit was performed on the peaks that can be considered to
make up the low and high TKE regions. This gave values of 145.8(10) MeV for the
low TKE peak of 1n emission, and 156.4(40) MeV for the high TKE peak. Doing
the same for the 2n file gave 146.3(8) MeV for the low TKE peak and 156.4(8) MeV
for the high TKE peak. The mass distributions for the low and high TKE regions
for both 1n and 2n emission are given in Appendix E.
7.2 Probability of BDF
By definition, the probability of DF can be calculated from:
PDF =
NDF (
196At)
N(196At)
(7.6)
, where NDF is the number of observed fission events and N(
196At) is the total
number of 196At nuclei that decay by  decay. Only the GPS data for NDF and
N were used as the statistics were more numerous. However, due to contaminants
in the 196Po region for the GPS data, the ratio of counts of the 7053 keV 196At peak
and the 6521 keV 196Po peak from the HRS run was used. As the branching ratios
7.3. Discussion 106
will be constant, then the ratio of these peaks should also stay constant, allowing
the number of counts in the 6521 keV peak in the GPS data to be calculated. The
PDF was deduced as 9(1) 105.
7.3 Discussion
Comparing the mass distribution with the example of 180Hg given in Section 2.6.2 it
is clear that 196Po does not exhibit the clear asymmetric split of 180Hg. This indicates
that the fission of 196Po produces a mixture of both asymmetric and symmetric
fission. As a check , the FWHM of the TKE can be compared. For the 180Hg
plot the TKE (180Hg)=133.2(14) MeV and a FWHM of 15.0(9) MeV [28], and for
196Po the values were TKE(196Po)=147(1) MeV with a FWHM of 24.2(9) MeV. This
shows the 196Po TKE spectrum is much broader, which suggests that more than one
fission mode is present.
Investigation of the TKE and mass distribution indicated that the mass distribu-
tions produced from the low and high TKE, based on the average value of 147 MeV,
produced a more defined symmetric/asymmetric mass split than the plots using the
TKE split of 151 MeV. This suggests that the value of 147 MeV for the average
TKE should be taken as the referred value. To confirm whether this is the case, two
methods can be used. The simplest method is to change the binning of the mass
distribution to determine if the symmetric/asymmetric split becomes more defined.
A second method would be to increase the statistics which would either increase
the prominence of the split or it would become one distribution, giving a clearer
indication of what is happening.
Recently, the potential energy surface (PES) for the fission of 196Po was cal-
culated by using the microscopic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory with the
D1S Gogny interaction as seen in [129]. HFB is a ground state theory in which the
mean field and pairing field influence each other. The PES showed a broad and
flat plateau, with many weakly pronounced valleys and ridges, that did not exceed
a 12 MeV energy difference. This was discussed by Ghys et al. [77] in which it
was seen that pattern in the PES for 196Po, without well-defined shell corrections,
should lead to several fission paths. These fission paths could produce a mixture
of symmetric and asymmetric mass distributions, which is more in agreement with
this experiments data.

Results of 194At
Part of the data set collected at both the May 2011 and May 2012 runs were 194At.
Unfortunately the amount of data collected for this nuclide is less than that for 196At.
Apart from one run, no HPGe detectors were connected. However, the  statistics
in the run are low. This therefore limits the information that can be learned from
the data in this file. The data present can still be used to infer a situation, but
cannot be said to be conclusive. This will restrict other areas of analysis, such as
the decay scheme, as regards to what can be accomplished.
Previously, both an  decay and DF studies, were performed by A.N. Andreyev
et al. [38, 40]. The data for both these studies came from an experiment performed
at the Separator for Heavy Ion Products (SHIP) at GSI, Darmstadt. They used the
141Pr(56Fe,3n)194At reaction. The 400 g/cm2 thick 141Pr targets were mounted on a
target wheel. After separation by the SHIP velocity filter, the evaporation residues
were implanted into a 16 strip position-sensitive silicon detector (PSSD). To mea-
sure any    coincidences, a large volume four-fold segmented clover germanium
detector was installed behind the PSSD. There were also three time-of-flight detec-
tors in front of the PSSD to allow the reaction products to be separated from any
scattered beam particles. In the work presented in this thesis, the 194At was studied
at ISOLDE in a similar manner to 196At (as described in the preceding Chapters).
8.1. Alpha Decay 108
8.1 Alpha Decay
To calibrate their spectra, Andreyev et al., used the lines of other nuclei produced
in the reaction through other reaction channels. Although this method has been
used for the previous nuclide 196At, it was deemed not suitable in this case. As seen
in the paper by Andreyev et al., they found 194At to have an isomer. This leads to
two  decay energies for 190Bi which, without knowing the  decay that is present,
means they cannot be used. The energies for the two bismuth  decays are also
very close in energy, leading to the possibility of both being present, but not being
clearly separated. It is is also apparent that in this work fewer peaks are being seen
than in the work by Andreyev. This also leads to uncertainty as to which peaks are
being seen. This is also why the values of the 194At peaks are not reliable to use.
As a trial, the values for the main peaks were used as calibration values and it was
found, that even if one of the peaks matched, then none of the others did. This also
gave weight to the argument to not use this method of calibration.
A different calibration method was therefore utilised for this data. In this ex-
periment the isotopes of astatine were produced in sequence as the experiment pro-
gressed. Initially, the calibration for the 196At data was used. This however appeared
to not fit the energies of the 194Po and 190Bi peaks (which although not used for
the calibration, are still used as guidance values). It therefore seemed likely that
the calibration had shifted during the run of 195At. A calibration of these data was
performed and the values of the energy peaks corresponded, within error, to the
NNDC [114] values. Using this new calibration, 194At was recalibrated, and pro-
duced values for the 190Bi and 194Po that were within the error margin of previously
determined values [130, 131].
The calibrated -decay energy spectrum is shown in Fig. 8.2, with the energies
of the peaks marked. Comparing the values of those believed to be 194At with the
values determined by Andreyev et al., it can be seen that they do not match, see
the decay scheme in Fig. 8.1. It was also noted that the energies of two of the
194At peaks were very similar in value to those seen in the analysis of 196At. To
clarify if they were indeed 194At peaks, the half-lives were deduced. This will be
fully described in Section 8.2.
The half-lives were found to be different, implying that the peaks did belong
to 194At. From Fig. 8.2, the energies of the 194At peaks are 7051(11) keV,7106(11)
keV and 7157(10) keV, 194Po 6850(11) keV and 190Bi 6446(10) keV. Comparing once
again to Andreyev, it can be seen that there were more lines present than in this

thesis work. It is likely that this is in part due to a crucial difference between the
two experiments. At ISOLDE, there is almost a total absence of  + e summing
effects compared to the experiment at SHIP. This is because at SHIP, the nuclei
are implanted into a position sensitive silicon detector (PSSD) which causes the
summing effects, from conversion electrons, to be more problematic. These effects
include the creation of new peaks, shifting peaks or causing them to broaden. In the
ISOLDE experiment, the nuclei are implanted into a carbon foil (which is thinner),
reducing the summing effects and therefore producing clearer spectra.
Although not part of this work, an experiment was performed in September 2014
using laser selectivity to study the hyper fine structure (HFS) for 194At. This had
the advantage that isomer separation becomes possible. HPGe detectors were also
connected to give  data. It is expected that the analysis of the data will shed more
light on the decay of 194At.
8.2 Half-lives
The half-lives of 194Po and 194At were calculated using the grow and decay method
since they decayed within the implantation detector. Due to smaller statistics, the
peaks were not as defined as those for 196At. This meant the error on most of the
peaks is large. Taking the half-life of 194Po first, the value in literature is 0.392(4)s
from the study by Wauters et al. [131]. It was found that the timing structure in
the runs used for this work, did not produce well defined decay curves, see Fig. 8.3.
Due to this, deciding where the limits of the fit should be was not as obvious as
in the case of 196At. To produce a peak that had (when the y-axis was logged) a
straight line decay, the binning had to be altered. In Fig. 8.4 a zoomed in area
of Fig. 8.3 is shown, which has been fitted. The half-life was determined to be
0.590(177) s, which is a greater value than that quoted in [131], and has a 2/ndf
value of 0.09701/1.
The individual values of the three 194At peaks are only given, since without
knowing to which isomer the peaks belong, an overall value cannot be taken. The
three half-life values are 0.433(107) s, 0.727(80)s and 0.470(163) s for the 7051 keV,
7106 keV and 7157 keV -decay energy peaks respectively. An example of one of
the fits is given in Fig. 8.5.
The 190Bi half-life however, could be calculated by fitting an exponential function
to the decay curve, since the 190Bi decayed at the decay detectors position. This
gave a half-life value of 5.4(4) s, see Fig. 8.6. This can be compared to the values

by Andreyev et al. which were 6.2(1) s and 6.3(1) s for the two isomers seen in that
study [38].
8.3 Branching Ratios
The same method was used to calculate the branching ratio of 194At as in the
analysis of 196At. The method, however, is simplified in this case, as 194Po appears
to fully decay at the implantation detector position due to its shorter half-life of
0.757 ms. This means that no corrections need to be included for the movement of
the windmill. The total number of counts of 194Po does not need to be determined
by considering the timings of the supercycles. Since all the polonium decays at the
implantation position, no counts need to be accounted for at the decay detectors
position. Therefore no SC constraints need to be applied. It is not possible, however,
to determine if any 194Po is present, with no lasers tuned for astatine ionisation, as
there are no dedicated files for this. This can therefore not be included in the
calculation, and it needs to be assumed that all counts of 194Po are from the  decay
of the 194At. The branching ratio was therefore calculated from,

(8.1)
This gives a value of b(
194At) = 8(1)%. From the study by Andreyev et al. [40],
they calculated a value of  8.3 % for the  branching of both isomers. This value
is in agreement with the calculated value in this work.
8.4 Discussion
As mentioned in Section 8.1 the number of -decay peaks seen in this work is less
than those seen by Andreyev et al.. One reason, as previously mentioned, is the
 + e summing which would be much more prevalent at SHIP. A second reason
for this could be, that in this work, only one of the isomers is being populated. In
order to determine if this is the case, more data would be required, including  
spectra. An experiment was run in 2014 in which the laser spectroscopy of 194At
was carried out. This will provide  information, HFS measurements and possibly
greater statistics. The data from this experiment will help to clarify the issues in
this work, but the data is not part of this thesis and so will be analysed at a later
date. Another method by which it can be seen if one or two isomers are present is
to look at the FWHM of the peaks [78]. This gives a FWHM of 45 keV, 39 keV
and 49 keV (lowest energy astatine peak first) for 194At, 36 keV for 194Po and 51
keV for 190Bi. These values would suggest that the peaks with larger FWHM values
could potentially be two peaks that cannot be resolved by the silicon detectors. The
energy values of the 194At energy peaks are also different from those in previous
literature. These values tend to be greater than those found in this work.
Regarding the half-life value for 194Po, further work will need to be pursued,
ideally with greater statistics. From the analysis carried out in this thesis, it is
apparent that the method used to calculate the half-life does not produce reliable
results with low statistics. The half-lives of the 194At peaks, although closer to the
values that have been seen previously, also have a large error for two of the peaks.
This again indicates that the fitting method needs to be improved for low statistics.
In his paper, Andreyev et al. have placed two 190Bi peaks in the decay scheme, each
with a half-life of  6 s. In this work only a single peak is seen, which could indicate
only one isomer is being excited, or the two peaks are not resolved. Therefore only
one half-life value was deduced, which is lower than the values seen previously.
To fully present an -decay study of 194At, more data will be required, especially

 coincidence data which would allow a decay scheme to be built for this nuclide.

Preliminary DF Results of 194At
9.1 DF
The fission data for 194At was calibrated using the Schmitt calibration as described
in Chapter 5. DF was observed in both the HRS and GPS runs. From the HRS
data, 6 single fission events were seen, of which two are coincident events. In the
GPS run, 382 single fission events were seen, out of which 107 are coincident fission
events. Due to the greater number of statistics, only the GPS data are considered.
The total energy spectrum of the fission events seen in Si1 and Si2 is shown in Fig.
9.1 over the energy range 3090 MeV. To determine the mass distribution, only the
coincident events are used. Following the same analysis method as used for 196At,
the fissioning polonium mass was taken to be A = 194. This was determined after
looking at the neutron separation energy, which is Sn = 10720(40) keV and the QEC
(194At) = 10293 (30), stopping any neutron emission after the  decay from 194At to
194Po. For the calibration process, it was assumed that no neutrons were emitted. To
determine whether it was energetically possible for prompt neutrons to be emitted
from the fission fragments, a comparison was made of the total kinetic energy with
the energy released. From this it is possible to deduce how many, if any, neutrons
were emitted. Before this calculation could be carried out, more information was
required about the identity of the fission fragments and the TKE of the system.
The TKE was plotted and a Gaussian fitted to give the mean energy. This gave
a value of 146(1) MeV. The fit is shown in Fig. 9.3. The 2D coincidence energy plot
is shown in Fig. 9.2. Comparing this to the 2D energy plots from 180Hg and 196Po,
it is similar to the latter. This indicates that 194Po fissions with both a symmetric
and asymmetric mass distribution.

is much more similar to the latter.
9.1. DF 119
To try and ascertain which fission fragments were present, the mass distribu-
tion was then plotted. This mass distribution plot, seen in Fig. 9.4 appears to
show five peaks. It is likely that this is caused by the binning applied. It should
be noted however, that attempts to change the binning to give an asymmetric and
symmetric mass distribution, as seen in the case of 196At, were unsuccessful. By
fitting the peaks, FWHM were obtained. From these it was seen that, the symmet-
ric distribution has a FWHM  7(2) u, The asymmetric pair of peaks beside the
symmetric peak have a FWHM  6(3) u and  6(2) u respectively. The second
asymmetric pair have a FWHM  3(1) u and  3(1) u respectively. This shows
that the one asymmetric pair of fission fragments has a FWHM of almost half the
symmetric peak. The other asymmetric pair however, have a FWHM almost the
same as the symmetric peak. This could suggest that due to the binning the ap-
parent two asymmetric pairs could actually just be one asymmetric distribution. If
however the speculation is made that the five peaks are actually present, then this
could be evidence of both isomers fissioning. In that case, what is being seen is
that both fission bi-modally, giving rise to a symmetric mass distribution and an
asymmetric distribution. Since the symmetric distribution will be constrained to a
mass by the nature of the mode, this could account for the peak being wider than
the other peaks. The two asymmetric distributions would therefore represent each
of the isomers. Further analysis for five peaks is given in Appendix F.
Applying a Gaussian fit to the three peaks, would give masses for the symmetric
peak of 97(2) and the asymmetric peaks as 84(2) and 110(2).
As seen before for 196Po, the mass distribution can be compared using a multiple
Gaussian fit, Fig. 9.4 and a single Gaussian fit, Fig. 9.5. With the multiple Gaussian
fit, as shown in Fig. 9.4, the 2/ndf value is 21.74/21, which when compared with
the 2 tables, it is less than the 95 % confidence level making this fit likely. For
a single Gaussian fit, the 2/ndf value is 2.647/3, which is also less than the 95 %
confidence level of 7.815, which would make this fit also likely. This shows that for
the mass distribution of 194Po, even though it is suggesting that multi-modes are
present, greater statistics are needed in order to fully confirm this.
Taking the symmetric mass distribution, the energetics of the distribution can
be calculated. Using the formula,

Emax.tot = QEC +Qfiss(0n) TKE
= 10.293 + 164.082 145.6
= 28.78MeV (9.2)
The neutron separation energy for 97Mo is 6.82 MeV. Assuming that a neutron
is emitted from each fission fragment, then the energy required is 13.64 MeV. This
still leaves 15.14 MeV for the emission of any  rays, making two neutron emission
possible. Since there were no HPGe detectors connected, it is not possible to see if
there are any  rays emitted and at which energies.
9.2. Probability of DF 122
For the asymmetric mass distribution of 194At, the assumption that the fission
fragments will have the same N/Z ratio (1.31) as the fissioning parent is again
applied. The fission fragments were identified as potentially being 84Rb and 110Ag.
Carrying out the same calculations as above, it is found that in the case of 84Rb,
then 20.90 MeV is available. The neutron separation energy Sn for
84Rb is 8.76 MeV
and for 110Ag the neutron separation energy Sn is 6.81 MeV. Taking these values, it
is seen that there is not enough energy available to allow for two neutron emission.
9.2 Probability of DF
To calculate the probability of DF, the same formula from 196At was used. In this
case however, only an estimate of the probability can be made. Since it cannot be
confirmed if both isomers are present, then it cannot be said if both isomers or only
one will fission. Therefore, the total number of 194At counts will need to be used in
the calculation. Again the polonium peak is not well defined in the GPS data due
to contaminants, so the ratio was taken of the 194Po to the total number of 194At in
the HRS run. This ratio was then used with the GPS file in order to calculate the
number of polonium counts in the -decay energy peak. This gave a PDF value of
0.86(3) %. In the DF study by Andreyev et al. [40] they calculated an estimated
value of the PDF , assuming that in one case, only one isomer fissions, and in the
second case, that both isomers fission. For only one isomer fissioning, their value
was  1.6% which is around twice the value calculated in this work. When they
assumed that both isomers fissioned, then the value was  0.8 % ( assumption was
also made that the two isomers had the same  branching of  8.3 %). This value
for both isomers fissioning is in good agreement with the PDF calculated in this
work.
9.3 Discussion
The 2D coincidence plot clearly shows that the DF of 194At is a mix of asymmetric
and symmetric fission. As was the case with 196At, the plot does not have defined
regions, indicating that only one fission mode is present.
The probability calculated for 194At is much larger than that for 196At. A greater
probability would be expected for 194At, as by referring back to Fig. 2.17 then it
can be seen that the trend is increasing for the more proton rich astatine isotopes.
9.3. Discussion 123
This calculated probability however, is not truly reflective of the 194At, since it is
not possible to determine from the data used in this work whether both isomers
are present or not, or if one, or both, lead to DF. It can be speculated that both
of the isomers do fission, based on the work by Andreyev et al. [40]. The values
for both the  branching and PDF were determined by a qualitative estimate and
are in good agreement with the estimated values in this thesis, which were deduced
from experimental data.

Conclusions
To conclude, this work has produced an updated decay scheme for 196At. Two
previously unseen fine structure decays have been observed, with confirmation of a
third fine structure peak that was observed in a previous study. Using the limited 
 coincidence data available, new  transitions have been seen with multipolarities
assigned. The new excited states in 192Bi have tentatively been assigned spins and
parities. The  branching ratio of 196At has been determined with a value of 2.6(1)
%. The half-lives of 196Po and 196At were calculated and found to be in agreement
within the error of previous studies. Half-life values were also deduced for the fine
structure peaks of 196At. Due to the limited statistics in the weaker fine structure
peaks, the error on these values tended to be much larger. The overall half-life of
196At was deduced as 358(5) ms.
The DF of 196At has also been investigated at ISOLDE. It is concluded that
the decay of 196Po is multi-modal, with both asymmetric and symmetric mass distri-
butions present, as shown by the triple-humped structure of the mass distribution.
This triple-humped fit was further confirmed by examining the 2 values of the fit
to determine that a single Gaussian fit was unlikely. The plot does show a mirror
plane at A = 98, but this is due to the condition m2 = Af m1 from the calibration
of the fission fragments. Further investigation of these modes, and the TKE, have
shown that the symmetric fission can be associated with the high TKE, and the
asymmetric with low TKE. The fission fragments were determined to be 98Mo for
the symmetric fission, and 88Sr, 108Pd for the asymmetric fission by utilising the
N/Z ratio that was calculated from the fissioning parent. The value of the TKE was
further investigated to attempt to determine if the split seen in the TKE plot was
an artefact of the binning.
When using this energy as the boundary between low and high TKE, instead
of the mean, it was found that the mass distribution changed. While the mass
distribution for the mean value gave a mass distribution that had a clear symmetric
mass and asymmetric masses at high and low TKE, the distributions at the split
were more mixed in nature for the high and low TKE. However, the mean value
of TKE was used in analysis. A comparison of the 2 values however, suggest
that fitting the TKE as two Gaussians would be the more likely outcome. To rule
out the TKE consisting of two separate energy distributions, or confirm, a further
experiment would need to take place that recorded a larger number of statistics
for analysis. In order to provide a complete study, any future experiments should
attempt to record  data. Not only would this assist in the placing of  rays in the
decay scheme, but could also allow the study of fission- coincidences.
Preliminary work was also conducted with 194At. From this, the energies of the
 decay peaks were determined to be different from those in a previous study. It is
likely that the diffence in energy values could be caused by  + e summing. The
number of peaks seen in this work compared to the previous study was also reduced.
It was not possible, in this case, to determine if both, or only one, of the isomers is
populated. Due to there being no HPGe detectors attached, with the exception of
one run, no  coincidences work was possible. This limited the analysis work that
could be carried out. It is hoped however that a subsequent study which, although
focussed on laser spectroscopy, will provide additional data so a full analysis of 194At
can be performed.
A preliminary DF study was also carried out on 194At. Again, due to it not
being known if both, or one isomer was, fissioning, it was not possible to carry out
a full study of the DF. Therefore, although properties of the DF were calculated,
these should be treated as estimated properties. The estimated  branching and
PDF did concur with those deduced by qualitative estimation in a previous study.
Based on the assumptions made in it, then it can be suggested that both of the
isomers may fission. The fission of 194Po was also observed to be multi-modal, with
symmetric and asymmetric fission modes, associated with the high and low TKE
respectively. In this case however, it can be speculated that there appeared to be
a greater number of distinct fission fragment pairings produced in the asymmetric
mass distribution for 194Po than for 196Po.
For both of these nuclides, further study needs to be carried out if the proper-
ties are to be fully understood. This has been partially carried out with the laser
spectroscopy study of 194At, which forms, along with this work, part of a larger
collaboration studying the properties of nuclides located in the lead region of the
nuclear chart.

The  decay spectrum from the GPS run can be seen in Fig A.2. Marked on it

isotopes are similar in value to the fine structure peaks seen in the HRS spectrum.
In order to confirm that they were indeed fine structure peaks,    analysis was
required.

It is therefore unlikely that two neutrons would be emitted. At most, only one
would be emitted.

The neutron separation values are Sn:

It is therefore possible that two neutrons would be emitted in this case.

Mass distributions for 196Po
Assuming 1 Neutron and 2
Neutron Emission
The mass distributions for 1n and 2n emmission are shown in Fig. F.1 and Fig. F.2
respectively. The plots have been drawn in the same manner as those in the main
text, with the total mass distribution as the black solid line, the high TKE as the
blue dashed line and the low TKE as the solid green line.
Appendix F. Mass distributions for 196Po Assuming 1 Neutron and 2 Neutron
emisson. 140
Figure F.1: 1n fission fragment mass distribution. The high TKE shows a mainly
symmetric mass distribution and the low TKE an asymmetric mass distribution.
Figure F.2: 2n fission fragment mass distribution. The high TKE is a symmetric
mass distribution while the low TKE is an asymmetric mass distribution.
Appendix G
194At DF Fission Fragment
Calculations for the Asymmetric
peaks
From Fig. G.2, the TKE distributions by mass were drawn. The dominating red
line is the symmetric mass distribution. It has the highest TKE distribution. The
asymmetric peaks were then drawn in their pairs to see how the TKE distributions
varied. As can be seen in Fig. G.2, there is a slight difference in TKE distribution
of these peaks. The pale blue and pink over-lapped lines refer to peaks 5 and 1, of
masses 114 and 80 respectively. The green and dark blue over-lapped lines are peaks
2 and 4 with masses of 87 and 107 respectively. A Gaussian fit was also applied to
these five main peaks as seen in Fig. G.1. The masses of the asymmetric fission
fragments are 80(1), 87(1), 107(1) and 114(1) MeV. The symmetric mass fragment
is at 97(1) MeV and is most likely to to be 97Mo.
The fission fragments were identified as 80Br, 113In and 87Sr, 107Pd. The same
calculations as in the main text were carried out for each pair.
For 80Br, 113In then the maximum available energy is 154.25 MeV. The neutron
separation energies Sn(
80Br) and Sn(
113In) are 7.89 MeV and 9.45 MeV respectively.
If two neutrons were to be emitted, then only 1.6 MeV would be left, therefore only
1 neutron at most can be emitted. For 87Sr, 107Pd then the maximum available
energy is 162.25 MeV the neutron separtation energy Sn(
87Sr) and Sn(
107Pd) are
8.43 MeV and 6.54 MeV. Taking these values it is seen that there is enough energy
available to allow for two neutron emission.
