Abstract 
The symbiosis between plants of the legume family and nitrogen-fixing rhizobia 
underpins global food security. Legume crops are a major source of protein in human 
diets, either directly or indirectly as feed for livestock. Application of inoculant rhizobial 
strains is common practice in many areas, as plant growth is often nitrogen limited and 
the symbiosis can significantly enhance yields. However, rhizobial strains and outcomes 
of the symbiosis vary widely. This variation has also been studied by evolutionary 
biologists interested in the stability of mutualisms. They proposed that plants may 
prevent establishing symbioses with ineffective strains (partner choice), or provide them 
with fewer resources (sanctioning). I studied both mechanisms, combining modelling 
and experimental approaches. 
 Mathematical modelling was used to predict how plants should allocate resources 
to maximise growth rates, depending on rhizobial nitrogen provision and carbon 
requirements and on soil nitrogen conditions. The use of marked mutant strains  easily 
distinguishable and differing in a single rhizobial characteristic  overcame previous 
experimental difficulties. It was found that pea (Pisum sativum L.) plants are not able to 
exert partner choice, but do sanction in a more complex way than was previously 
established. In line with model predictions, resources were preferentially allocated to the 
single  best available  strain, so that resources allocated to an intermediate-fixing strain 
depended on whether or not a strain providing more nitrogen was available. Contrary to 
model predictions, there was no indication of discrimination based on rhizobial carbon 
requirements. 
 The results cannot be explained by resource allocation in proportion to nitrogen 
received, and indicate systemic integration of information from different nodules. I 
formulate a hypothesis about the underlying plant regulatory mechanisms, and discuss 
implications of the results for selecting inoculant strains and enhancing yields in the 
field. Future work will rely on further integration of theoretical and applied methods and 
perspectives.

1.1 Overview 
In this chapter the context for the research conducted in this thesis is provided, and the 
aims and objectives are defined. The legume-rhizobia symbioses are of tremendous 
importance in agriculture, but have also been studied by evolutionary biologists 
interested in the stability of mutualisms. These two perspectives have in common that 
questions are asked about how the natural variability in rhizobial strains, especially in 
how much nitrogen they provide, affects plant growth. The approach in this thesis is to 
combine methods and ways of thinking from those two perspectives, and to ask and 
address questions relevant for both.   
 The aim is to understand how plants respond to variability in rhizobial strains, 
from the perspective of optimising plant growth. The symbiosis and plant growth are 
inextricably linked, since carbon and nitrogen are the main constituents of plant growth, 
and in the symbiosis carbon from the plant is exchanged for nitrogen from rhizobia. A 
large part of understanding the plant response to rhizobia is therefore about 
understanding resource allocation. Hypotheses on possible ways of resource allocation 
tend to be simple to formulate, but their implications for plant growth much harder to 
predict. Mathematical modelling is therefore used to convert simple ideas about resource 
allocation into measurable outcomes for plant growth. Thus, modelling is used to 
formulate testable hypotheses which are addressed in growth room experiments.  
 Background on the symbiosis and organisms involved is provided (1.2) before 
the literature from the two perspectives on the symbiosis is reviewed and it is explained 
how they are combined in this thesis (1.3). Carbon and nitrogen metabolism in plants is 
briefly discussed given their importance for plant growth and the symbiosis (1.4). Then, 
it is explained why mathematical modelling can be helpful in addressing the questions 
that arise (1.5), and the choice of model system for the experiments is introduced (1.6). 
The chapter concludes with setting the aims and objectives, and an overview of the thesis 
(1.7).  
1.2 The legume-rhizobia symbiosis 
1.2.1 Organisms involved 
Bacteria living near, on and in plant roots can tremendously affect plant growth. This is 
illustrated at one extreme by pathogenic bacteria1, and at the other extreme by the 
positive effect of plant growth promoting (rhizo)bacteria (PGPR), which enhance plant 
growth via diverse mechanisms2. The term symbiosis, the living together of unlike 
organisms, covers both extremes while mutualism refers only to the situation in which 
both organisms benefit from the interaction35. Both terms are applied to situations in 
which atmospheric nitrogen-fixing bacteria nodulate plant roots, likely because it is not 
always easy to define benefits received by both plant and bacteria4. In contrast, the 
organisms involved in the interaction are clearly defined and limited to particular groups 
of both plants and bacteria.  
 Nitrogen-fixing bacteria were first isolated from a root nodule in 1888 and called 
Rhizobium leguminosarum6. Since then, many more bacteria have been isolated and 
continue to be discovered7. Classification was initially based mostly on phenotype on the 
host plant, but is now based on genetics using 16S and core housekeeping genes6. 
Defining species is complicated by lateral transfer of genes involved in the symbiosis6, 
and rather than using species, the term strain is often used, also to denote mutants of 
naturally occurring strains. The term rhizobia is applied to any species nodulating plant 
roots (and in some species shoots8) in the Gram-negative phylum Proteobacteria, which 
includes genera from the Alpha subdivision such as Rhizobium, Azorhizobium, 
Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium, and Ensifer (formerly Sinorhizobium) and from the 
Beta subdivision such as Burkholderia6,9. There are bacteria capable of fixing nitrogen 
which are not considered rhizobia, such as species in the genus Frankia which also 
nodulate plants but are distinct from rhizobia as they are Gram-positive and form a 
different type of nodule on actinorhizal plants such as Alnus and Casuarina10,11. In 
addition, there are numerous nitrogen-fixing bacterial genera which are free living, or 
live associatively or endosymbiotically with plants, as in the case of sugar cane and the 
fern Azolla.12  
 For plants, the ability to engage in a symbiosis with nodulating nitrogen-fixing 
bacteria first arose around 70 million years ago13 and is limited to the Rosid I clade14. 
Within this clade, the symbiosis with rhizobia is almost exclusively limited to the legume 
family (Leguminosae or Fabaceae)14,15. Species in the genus Parasponia (Cannabaceae, 
but formerly classified as Ulmaceae16) are the only non-leguminous plants forming 
symbioses with rhizobia17. Eight other families in the Rosid I clade are actinorhizal and 
form symbioses with Frankia14. The majority of the 19,500 species in the legume family 
form nitrogen-fixing symbioses, but not all species do15. It is generally agreed that the 
ability to form the symbiosis has been gained and lost several times7,9,18, which raises 
questions about the evolutionary stability of the legume-rhizobia symbiosis (see 1.3.1). 
Legume phylogenies continue to be updated, but a clade of special importance is the 
Inverted Repeat Lacking Clade (IRLC). This clade arose around 40 million years ago 
and contains many temperate and agronomically important legumes, such as pea (Pisum 
sativum), vetch (Vicia spp.), lentil (Lens culinaris) and clover (Trifolium spp.), but not 
common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and soybean (Glycine max)9,19,20.  
1.2.2 Establishment of the symbiosis 
 The symbiosis between a legume plant and rhizobia needs to be established anew 
every plant generation, as rhizobia are not transmitted via the seed. The process is well 
studied and reviewed2126. A germinating legume plant in need of nitrogen will release 
chemical signals such as flavonoids into the soil26,27. Rhizobia in the rhizosphere, usually 
saprophytic when free-living28,29, may use the root exudates as a carbon source or as a 
guide to the plant root30,31 and respond by synthesizing Nod factors (lipo-chito-
oligosaccharides)2126. Nod factors are perceived by the plant via receptor-like-kinases 
with an extracellular LysM domain3234. Variable functional groups of the Nod factors 
are key to host specificity: a given legume will not form a symbiosis with any rhizobial 
strain9,35,36. Some legume species are very selective (for example those in the IRLC, such 
as pea) and only form symbioses with a few strains, while others are more promiscuous 
(for example common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris)9,37), and there is even variation within 
species38. Nod factor binding to the receptor starts off two parallel processes: the 
infection of the plant root by rhizobia, and the formation of the nodule22 (Figure 1-1).  
 The infection most commonly occurs via curling of the root hair around bacteria 
and the formation of an infection thread, providing rhizobia access to cortical cells in the 
nodule primordium9,22. In some species, rhizobia enter via the epidermis without root 
hair curling and infection thread formation9. The formation of the nodule meristem from 
which the nodule is formed is guided by plant hormones, especially auxin and 
cytokinin22. The nodule meristem is persistent in some plant species, leading to 
indeterminate nodules with a cylindrical shape, while other species form spherical 
determinate nodules which cannot continue to grow9,39,40. Inside nodules, bacterial cells 
are contained in a symbiosome membrane within the infected plant cells41. Although 
mixed infection nodules do occur, bacterial cells within a nodule tend to be clonal 
descendants of a single bacterium30,42. In some species, the bacterial cells responsible for 
nitrogen fixation are significantly enlarged and become unable to reproduce. Whether or 
not such bacteroids are formed depends on the host plant, as revealed by experiments 
with the same strains on different hosts43,44. In most agriculturally relevant crops, 
indeterminate nodules contain non-reproductive nitrogen-fixing bacteroids along with 
viable non-fixing bacteria, while determinate nodules contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria 
which are still able to reproduce, but this is not the case for all species45. Eventually, 
nodules senesce and rhizobia are released back into the soil4648.  
1.2.3 Nutrient exchange in the symbiosis 
The core of the symbiosis is the exchange of nitrogen fixed by rhizobia for carbon fixed 
by the plant. The details of how this exchange is achieved are, however, far from fully 
understood, and there is considerable variation among species. Exchange of resources 
takes place in the infected plant cell and involves two membranes: the symbiosome 
membrane, and the bacterial membrane within49 (Figure 1-2). Depending on plant 
species, a single symbiosome contains one or multiple bacteria or bacteroids23. Infected 
plant cells are interspersed with uninfected plant cells in the fixation zone, which is 
surrounded by vascular bundles connecting the nodule to the rest of the plant via phloem 
and xylem (Figure 1-1)49.  
 Carbon enters the infected cell as sucrose from the phloem49, but is provided to 
the rhizobia as dicarboxylic acids50,51, especially malate49. Ammonia (NH3) is thought to 
diffuse across the bacterial membrane, and to be transported across the symbiosome 
membrane via either an ammonia (NH3)
52,53 channel, or a non-specific cation channel 
transporting ammonium (NH4
+)54,55. Outside the symbiosome, ammonium is 
incorporated into amino acids or ureides by the infected plant cell and exported to the 
xylem49,51. Plants are thus divided into amide or ureide exporters56.  
Figure 1-1. Schematic overview of the nodulation process for indeterminate (left) and 
determinate (right) nodules. Figure reproduced from Ferguson et al., 201057. 
 The bacterial metabolism in the symbiosis is very different from the metabolism 
in the free-living state and seems to a large extent under plant control49,58. Because fixed 
nitrogen is exported as ammonia and not further incorporated into amino acids, the 
bacterial cells become dependent on the plant not only for carbon, but also for amino 
acids5861. Again, the details seem to be dependent on species23, but transporters for 
amino acids62 and various other nutrients such as iron63, magnesium64, sulfate65 and 
zinc66 have been identified.  
1.2.4 Outcome of the symbiosis 
The outcome of the symbiosis has been studied mostly from a plant perspective4, and 
more specifically in terms of how much nitrogen the plant has received or how much the 
growth has been enhanced. Different measures have been adopted. First, plants grown 
with rhizobia were compared to each other or to non-fixing reference plants in terms of 
dry matter produced or nitrogen content67,68. Later, estimates of nitrogenous compounds 
in the xylem69, and direct measurements of nitrogen fixation rates such as acetylene 
reductions70 and H2 evolution
71 also became available. Stable isotope analysis has been 
used to quantify the proportion of nitrogen provided by rhizobia even under field 
conditions69. Every method has its limitations68, but it has become clear that there is 
considerable variation in the outcome of the symbiosis. Some strains provide much more 
nitrogen than others7276, and for a given strain the nitrogen provided may also depend on 
host plant species36,77. The amount of nitrogen provided is denoted the effectiveness of 
the rhizobial strain and variation among strains has been studied from two perspectives: 
by evolutionary biologists interested in the stability of mutualisms and by agronomists 
interested in enhancing yields. 
Figure 1-2. Schematic overview of an infected plant cell containing a symbiosome (dark 
green) which in turn contains a bacteroid (orange). The plant provides the bacteroid with 
carbon (as malate), amino acids and various other nutrients. In return, the bacteroid provides 
the plant with nitrogen in the form of ammonia, which is incorporated into amino acids in the 
infected plant cell, in this case asparagine (Asn), before being exported to the xylem. All 
compounds exchanged have to pass both the symbiosome and the bacteroid membrane and not 
all transporters have been identified. Figure reproduced from Udvardi and Poole, 201349.  
1.3 Different perspectives on the legume-rhizobia symbiosis 
1.3.1 The legume-rhizobia symbiosis from an agricultural perspective 
Due to the symbiosis with rhizobia, legumes are rich in nitrogen and therefore protein78
80. Their nutritional value has been valued since the beginnings of agriculture. The first 
plants that were domesticated to become crops around 10,000 years ago in the Fertile 
Crescent not only included grains like wheat and barley, but also legumes like chickpea, 
lentil, pea and bitter vetch81. Later (6,000-9,000 years ago), soybean (Glycine max) was 
domesticated in China82,83. In the New World, species of the genus Phaseolus were 
domesticated and especially common beans (P. vulgaris) have been cultivated across the 
Americas84. Wherever agriculture developed, legumes were domesticated alongside 
cereals or tubers85. Today, legumes continue to be a crucial source of protein in human 
diets. Pulses  legumes of which the grains are eaten  contribute 33% to dietary protein 
nitrogen79, reason enough for the United Nations to have designated the year 2016 as the 
International Year of Pulses. But legumes are also used as green manure, and important 
pasture and fodder crops79,86,87. Around 80% of soybean grown globally is processed for 
animal feed, accounting for 4% of global livestock feed intake88. In total, biological 
nitrogen fixation in agricultural systems amounts to 50-70 Tg nitrogen per year12. For 
comparison, synthetic nitrogen fertiliser inputs into agricultural systems are about 120 
Tg nitrogen per year87. The energy needed to produce those fertilisers via the Haber-
Bosch process accounts for 1.4% of the global energy use89.  
 Agricultural research on the legume-rhizobia symbioses is primarily concerned 
with enhancing crop yields. The variation in effectiveness of rhizobial strains in 
providing nitrogen and enhancing yields was acknowledged early on, and ineffective 
strains are common72,90,91. A significant effort has therefore been invested in finding and 
isolating highly effective rhizobial strains to use them as inoculants, first done 
commercially in the UK and USA in 189567. The use of inoculants, most commonly in a 
peat base applied to seed, is standard practice in many areas of the world67,90. However, 
inoculants are not always effective, or only temporarily effective, at enhancing yields. 
Elite inoculant strains often fail to form sufficient nodules on the plant root, because 
resident bacterial populations are more competitive in colonizing the plant root, and in 
surviving in the soil environment over longer periods of time67,72,90,9295. This has been 
called the competition problem95. Research into selecting effective and competitive 
strains to use as inoculants is ongoing96100.  
1.3.2 The legume-rhizobia symbiosis from an evolutionary biology perspective 
The legume-rhizobia symbiosis has been widely used as a model system to study the 
evolutionary stability of mutualisms17. Mutualisms puzzle evolutionary biologists, as it 
often seems that one or both partners could gain by providing fewer resources to the 
symbiotic partner, and instead direct these towards their own fitness. Ultimately, this 
may lead to the symbiosis breaking down3,17,42,101103. In the legume-rhizobia symbiosis, 
rhizobia could (partially) forgo energy-costly nitrogen fixation, and instead use resources 
received from the plant for reproduction or to make storage compounds42. Theory 
predicts that such strains, sometimes called cheats in this literature, are likely to arise in 
the legume-rhizobia symbiosis for two reasons42,104,105. First, a single legume plant 
usually hosts multiple rhizobial strains106109. Therefore, for each of those strains it 
would be beneficial to obtain plant resources while leaving the nitrogen fixation to the 
other strains. Second, rhizobia are horizontally transmitted, which means that plant and 
rhizobial fitness are not closely interdependent42,104,105.  
 Two mechanisms have been proposed that would prevent ineffective strains from 
spreading through the rhizobial population, causing the mutualism to break 
down42,104,105,110,111. By exerting partner choice, plants might prevent the establishment of 
ineffective strains. This would mean that plants discriminate against ineffective strains 
and preferentially form nodules with more effective strains104,105,110. Evidence for partner 
choice has been claimed105,110,111, but interpretation of results is problematic because 
natural strains were used, which differ not only in how much nitrogen they provide, but 
also in how competitive they are at colonising the plant root. Alternatively, plants might 
sanction ineffective rhizobial strains by allocating fewer resources to those strains once 
the symbiosis is established and nodules have been formed42,104,105. Modelling studies 
have shown that sanctioning can be selected for in plants112, and that this could maintain 
high levels of nitrogen fixation in rhizobial populations113. Experimental evidence for 
sanctioning has been provided by using argon gas to force rhizobia to fix no or less 
nitrogen, which resulted in smaller nodules containing fewer viable bacteria114116. Also 
in naturally occurring strains, ineffective nodules have been reported to be smaller than 
effective nodules117. But it remains unclear how sanctions work and how resources 
would be allocated among multiple rhizobial strains.  
1.3.3 Combining the two perspectives 
Although the two perspectives on the legume-rhizobia symbiosis seem very different at 
first glance, they have in common that both are interested in how the variation in 
effectiveness of rhizobial strains affects plants. The approach in this thesis is to combine 
the methods and ways of thinking from both the agricultural and the evolutionary 
biology perspectives to ask and address questions relevant for both fields. For example, 
the question of whether plants exert partner choice based on how much nitrogen strains 
provide is one aspect of rhizobial competitiveness with which agricultural research is 
concerned. It can be addressed using techniques which were developed to study 
competition between rhizobia118 (chapter 3). The idea of sanctioning raises questions 
about plant resource allocation to different rhizobial strains. Differential resource 
allocation to nodules has received little attention so far from an agricultural perspective, 
but may be relevant to understand under what conditions rhizobial strains effectively 
enhance yields.  
 Understanding sanctioning has the potential to inform agricultural research. From 
an evolutionary biology perspective, sanctioning can only be a mechanism to stabilise 
the symbiosis when plants reduce rhizobial fitness of less beneficial strains. At the same 
time, sanctioning can only be selected for in plants when it directly increases plant 
fitness. Plant fitness is increased if, by sanctioning, the plant avoids loss of resources to 
strains that provide little benefit. Since fitness and yields are often both measured in seed 
output, understanding how and when plants sanction rhizobial strains to increase their 
fitness may help in understanding how to increase yields. For example, soil nitrogen 
availability may affect sanctioning, and understanding how may inform whether elite 
rhizobial strains for inocula are best selected under low or high soil nitrogen conditions. 
In order to understand sanctioning, sanctioning is mainly considered from a plant 
perspective in this thesis. 
 From a plant perspective, sanctioning is a question of optimising resource 
allocation among rhizobial strains so that no resources are lost on strains which provide 
little benefit. Currently, it is unclear what optimal resource allocation would look like. 
The theory of sanctioning is based on the idea that rhizobial strains may cheat on plants 
by diverting carbon obtained from the plant away from nitrogen fixation and into 
rhizobial fitness. The main implication of such a diversion is that carbon costs per gram 
nitrogen fixed are increased, and thus that efficiency of nitrogen fixation is decreased (in 
addition to any other natural variation in efficiency that may already exist). In the 
literature about sanctioning, it is generally assumed that as a result less nitrogen is fixed, 
and thus that cheating strains are less effective. But alternatively, plants might simply 
provide more carbon to less efficient strains to (partially) keep up the rate of nitrogen 
fixation, as it has been argued that plants are not generally carbon-limited119. Natural 
strains are known to vary both in effectiveness (how much nitrogen they provide)7276, 
and in efficiency (carbon costs per gram nitrogen fixed)120122, but it is unclear on what 
basis plants would sanction strains. This is not helped by the fact that the terms 
effectiveness and efficiency are sometimes used interchangeably and that knowledge is 
sometimes confounded, for example when effectiveness is expressed as yield differences, 
which may be affected by both.  
  By taking a plant perspective and approaching sanctioning as a question of 
resource allocation, other aspects of sanctioning receive less attention in this thesis. For 
example, the effects of differential resource allocation on rhizobial fitness are more 
briefly considered. It is acknowledged that the effects on rhizobial fitness need to be 
understood to know how the mutualism has persisted over millions of years, and also to 
understand how to maintain rhizobial populations effective at enhancing yields in 
agricultural soils. But plant effects on rhizobial fitness cannot be understood without first 
understanding how plants allocate resources to rhizobia. The focus of the thesis is 
therefore on understanding how plants allocate resources to rhizobial strains  which 
may differ both in how much nitrogen they provide and how efficiently they do so. 
Whether or not ineffective or inefficient strains fit the definition of a cheat123, or are for 
other reasons ineffective or inefficient, is also given less attention.  
 The question of resource allocation to rhizobia by the plant comes down to 
balancing obtaining nitrogen and spending carbon, because carbon and nitrogen are the 
main constituents of plant growth and plants provide rhizobia with carbon and receive 
nitrogen in return. Although resource allocation to nodules has received little attention, 
balancing carbon and nitrogen uptake and use through allocation of resources to shoot 
and root has been a major field of research for many years given the agricultural 
relevance of understanding what limits plant growth. So while sanctioning may help in 
understanding how to enhance legume yields, the agriculturally driven research on 
carbon and nitrogen metabolism may help in understanding sanctioning. 
1.4 Carbon and nitrogen metabolism 
1.4.1 Carbon and nitrogen: the backbone of life 
Life requires many nutrients, but carbon and nitrogen form the backbone of life and are 
needed in the greatest quantities124126. All tissue is made with both carbon and nitrogen 
atoms, meaning that carbon and nitrogen metabolism are intimately linked126134. Plants 
have access to a potentially infinite amount of carbon: as long as they have access to 
light and water, they can fix atmospheric carbon via photosynthesis. Nitrogen, in 
contrast, is usually limiting for plant growth124,125,135137. Plants have therefore evolved 
intricate ways of monitoring and coordinating carbon and nitrogen uptake127131,133,134. A 
lot of work has been done on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, although work has 
been extended to agriculturally relevant crops such as wheat, maize and rice. Some work 
has been done on legumes, especially the model legume Medicago 
truncatula125,126,138,139. Progress has also been made by comparing plants with bacteria 
and fungi128,140, and even mammalian systems141, since carbon and nitrogen metabolism 
is so central to life that some aspects are conserved across kingdoms. 
1.4.2 Plant nitrogen uptake and assimilation 
Plants usually take up nitrogen from the soil via their roots. Although nitrogen-
containing organic compounds such as urea and amino acids can be taken up directly, the 
predominant sources are nitrate (NO3
-) and ammonium (NH4
+) ions131,140,142144. Legumes 
have nitrogen fixation as an additional source, but also take up nitrogen via their roots 
and the mechanisms seem to be the same as for non-legumes143,145. How much of the 
nitrogen is provided via roots in legumes depends on conditions, and can range from 0 to 
100%.  
 Whatever the original source of nitrogen, ultimately the plant forms organic 
compounds from the ammonium ion (NH4
+). The ammonium may originate from direct 
uptake, from amino acid degradation, from nitrogen fixation, or from the reduction of 
nitrate via nitrite (by nitrate and nitrite reductase respectively). Ammonium is 
incorporated into the amino acid glutamate, via the combined action of glutamine 
synthetase (GS) and glutamate oxoglutarate amidotransferase (GOGAT). Glutamate is 
consequently used to form other amino acids143,146149. The assimilation of nitrogen into 
amino acids, combining carbon and nitrogen atoms into a single molecule, is the most 
direct link between carbon and nitrogen metabolism146.  
 On a larger scale, this link translates to the need for coordinating carbon and 
nitrogen uptake, and therefore shoot and root architecture132,143,144,150153. For example, 
the shoot to root ratio tends to be smaller in nutrient deficient conditions as more 
resources are allocated to the root to take up the required nutrients143,150. How the root 
grows also depends on local nutrient availability. The control of lateral root growth in 
response to local nutrient concentrations is well established140,143,144,150152. Regulation is 
complex, involving both local and systemic signalling pathways132,152,154,155. Recent 
advances in this field continue to elucidate roles of various signalling molecules131, plant 
hormones132,140,151, transcription factors140,151,155157 and regulatory microRNAs140,158. 
 Adding nitrogen-fixing nodules to the equation makes the puzzle even more 
intricate, but there may also be synergies. Regulatory systems are at least partially 
integrated159162, as exemplified by formation of fewer and smaller nodules in nitrate rich 
environments163165. And the idea of allocating resources to nodules based on how much 
nitrogen they provide (what evolutionary biologists have called sanctioning) is 
essentially the same as allocating resources (by growing roots) where nutrients are 
available. The question is how plants coordinate carbon and nitrogen metabolism and 
distribute resources over shoot, root and different nodules. Mathematical modelling can 
be useful in addressing this question. 
1.5 Mathematical modelling of the legume-rhizobia symbiosis 
1.5.1 Why mathematical modelling can be useful 
The idea that plants orchestrate growth of different tissues to enhance their fitness is 
simple, but the implications are not. Roots and nodules provide different amounts of 
nitrogen, while requiring different amounts of carbon, and the shoot provides carbon and 
requires nitrogen. It becomes impossible to mentally and verbally consider different 
ways of plant resource allocation, and the effects on plant growth of different rhizobial 
strains and soil nitrogen concentrations. Mathematical models can be useful in situations 
like this, where the outcomes are often counterintuitive. Simple ideas can be written as 
mathematical equations relatively straightforwardly, after which the complex outcomes 
can be studied. Sometimes it is possible to find analytical solutions, but today computers 
make it feasible to study model outcomes even if the model is too complex to study 
analytically166168. The computer-generated numerical solutions are also useful in 
checking analytical solutions. Mathematical modelling is a tool167,169, and as with any 
tool, how useful it is depends on how it is used. It is therefore important to be clear about 
the aims of the modelling, and how it is to be used170.  
1.5.2 How the mathematical modelling is used 
Colloquially, a model is often interpreted as how things should be, but the scientific 
definition is usually a simplified version of reality167,170,171. This is a rather broad 
definition, and encompasses anything from maps, to ball-and-stick models of molecules, 
verbal arguments, and sets of mathematical equations. Mathematical models are a set of 
hypotheses, in the form of mathematical equations, which together describe a process 
and explain an outcome of interest167,170,172,173. In some cases, there can be confidence in 
the hypotheses and assumptions that describe the process and models can be used to 
predict future events. Models for space travel that make use of well-established physical 
laws are an often-used example167,170,172. In other cases, there is more uncertainty about 
the set of hypotheses, but the model is used for predictions anyway, as is the case with 
weather and climate models170.   
 Mathematical models can also be used to compare reality with the hypotheses in 
the model. Statistical models are used to make sense of observations (for example how 
the outcome of interest is affected by a treatment) given what is assumed to be known 
about the data (for example that they are normally distributed). Deterministic (non-
stochastic) mathematical models are more often used to probe the hypotheses. The idea 
is that it is possible to get closer to an understanding of reality by repeatedly going 
through the process of developing a model, comparing the model outcome with reality, 
discovering discrepancies, re-developing the model etc. Even though the model will 
never become a perfect representation of reality, the process can be useful167169,171,173. 
Developing the model forces one to think through a problem very carefully. The model 
itself may allow for in silico experiments so that actual experiments that need to be done 
can be fewer and better informed169,171,174, and modelling can help in generating new 
hypotheses168,172.  
 Modelling is in many ways based on judgement and subjective, and therefore 
sometimes called an art167,170,172. The two major judgements are about what is going to be 
modelled, and in how much detail. A farm can be modelled by describing corn yields 
based on temperature and fertiliser regimes. But if market prices are not considered the 
model wont help to understand why the corn yield dropped when the farmer switched to 
wheat. So the processes described in the model determine what can be learned. Models 
can be made to match reality better by adding ever more details, but this is not always 
desirable. Complex models tend to be applicable only to very specific situations, and 
although they may describe an outcome rather well they may not advance understanding, 
if it is unclear which processes are described by the added complexity167,170.  
 To simplify models, complex processes are often condensed into a single 
parameter value167,169,171. For example, the complex process of photosynthesis may be 
summarised into a single value in a model of forest canopy growth175, while in another 
model the rate of photosynthesis may be the outcome of interest and be modelled as a 
function of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which in turn can be the subject of a model 
concerning climate change with parameters about the car industry. So what is a 
parameter and what is a model outcome depends on the questions asked in the model, 
and models can be made more complex by replacing parameters with more equations167. 
Parameters themselves can also be of interest, and models are used to establish probable 
values of parameters (parameter space)176, or to determine how much the outcome of a 
model depends on the parameter value (parameter sensitivity analysis)167,168. 
Determining which processes are to be modelled and in how much detail is the art of 
modelling. Because there are so many different possibilities, none of which will match 
reality exactly, it is said (first by G.E.P. Box) that all models are wrong, but some 
models are useful170. 
 In this thesis, a mathematical model of plant growth is used to study hypotheses 
about plant resource allocation to shoot, root and nodules, depending on soil nitrogen 
availability and different rhizobial strains. The aim of the modelling is to predict how a 
plant should allocate resources in order to optimise plant growth. These predictions form 
hypotheses which are tested in experiments. Actual resource allocation may of course 
deviate from the predicted optimum for various reasons, but these discrepencies inform 
further model development and experiments and thus advance our understanding. The 
model presented in this thesis is intended to capture the essentials of plant growth, but is 
not intended to be an accurate or realistic representation of plant growth. The model is 
not specific to a certain species of legume or rhizobia. Therefore, little emphasis is 
placed on obtaining precise parameter values of key parameters (for example, the rate of 
photosynthesis), although values were remained within a range of biologically realistic 
values. The strength of the modelling lies not in its realism, but in using mathematical 
logic to structure thoughts and generate testable hypotheses. 
1.6 Experimental model system 
In order to test hypotheses generated by the model, it is necessary to manipulate how 
much nitrogen rhizobial strains provide and how much carbon they use. I chose the 
model rhizobial strain Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae (Rlv) 3841 for use in 
experiments. The strain is a spontaneous streptomycin-resistant derivative of Rhizobium 
leguminosarum bv. viciae 300177, of which the genome has been published178, and its 
widespread use in labs means that many mutant derivatives are available, or can be 
generated relatively easily. Rlv3841 readily forms indeterminate nodules with pea 
(Pisum sativum), a legume in the agronomically important IRLC group of legumes9 
which is easy to grow in growth rooms. We used cultivar Avola, which has also been 
widely used (see for example58,179181). A closely related Rhizobium leguminosarum 3841 
strain (biovar phaseoli) forms determinate nodules with bean (Phaseolus 
vulgaris)9,178,179, which may be useful in future studies considering possible differences 
in sanctioning mechanisms between determinate and indeterminate nodule types. 
1.7 Aims and objectives 
In this thesis, the aim is to understand how plants respond to strains which differ in how 
much nitrogen they provide, and how efficiently they do so. More specifically, the 
objectives are to: 
i) Establish whether legumes preferentially establish a symbiosis by forming 
more nodules with strains that provide more nitrogen. Such preferential 
nodule formation has been called partner choice by evolutionary biologists, 
and is one aspect of the competitiveness of rhizobial strains with which 
agricultural researchers are concerned. This objective is addressed in chapter 
ii) Establish how plant resources should be allocated to different rhizobial strains 
for optimal plant growth: are resources best divided among multiple strains, 
or should they only be allocated to the best available strain? Should resources 
be allocated based on effectiveness, or (also) on efficiency of nitrogen 
fixation? And how does soil nitrogen availability affect resource allocation to 
and among rhizobial strains? This objective is addressed through a 
mathematical model of plant resource allocation in chapter 4. 
iii) Establish how pea plants actually allocate resources to different rhizobial 
strains. The model predictions are tested by measuring resource allocation to 
rhizobial strains differing in how much nitrogen they provide and how much 
carbon they take, under varying soil nitrogen concentrations. This objective is 
addressed in chapter 5 and addresses the question of how sanctioning works, 
which may also have agriculturally relevant implications.  
Each chapter is presented in the form of a research paper, and is preceded by a brief 
overview of the aims of that chapter. Chapter 3 has been published in Scientific 
Reports182. Chapter 4 and chapter 5 are being combined to form a single substantial 
publication (in preparation). For each of the objectives, findings are discussed in the 
appropriate chapter, and summarised and synthesised in a general discussion 
(chapter 6). Chapter 2 describes general methods and provides background on the 
methods used. Specific methods and experimental designs are presented at the end of 
each chapter, except for the chapter presenting the mathematical model (chapter 4) 
in which methods are provided first so that results can be better understood. 
References are provided at the end of each chapter. Supplemental information is 
gathered at the end of the thesis, but split out per chapter consistent with how it was 
published if applicable. Formatting of chapters and reference styles have been 
adapted to create a uniform style throughout the thesis.

2 General materials and methods 
The value and utility of any experiment are determined by the fitness of the material to 
the purpose for which it is used []. 
Gregor Mendel, Experiments in plant hybridization, 1865 
2.1 Overview 
This chapter describes the general methods for the experimental work described in this 
thesis. Experimental designs and specific methods are described in each chapter. General 
methods of growing plants (2.2) and culturing bacteria (2.3) are described first, and then 
the various post-harvest procedures for data collection (2.4). 
2.2 Plant growth 
2.2.1 Seed sterilisation and germination 
Pea (Pisum sativum L. cv Avola) seeds were surface sterilised by immersing them in 
95% ethanol in a sterile flask for 30 seconds, washed with sterile distilled water once, 
immersed in 2% bleach (sodium hypochlorite, NaClO) for five to six minutes and then 
rinsed with sterile distilled water five to ten times to remove all traces of bleach, 
transferring the seeds to a clean sterile flask after around half of the washes. Under sterile 
conditions, peas were then transferred to 0.8% distilled water agar plates. Around 8 peas 
were placed on a single plate, plates were stacked in groups of around five, wrapped in 
aluminium foil and stored at room temperature. After around five days, peas that had 
germinated and which displayed emergent radicles were used for planting.  
2.2.2 Nitrogen free nutrient solution 
At planting, plants were supplied with 75 mL of nutrient solution containing all essential 
nutrients except nitrogen (unless otherwise stated), so that rhizobial nitrogen fixation was 
the sole nitrogen source for plant growth. The formulation is 2.67 times more 
concentrated as in Poole et al., 19941 to allow for decreased water holding capacity of a 
different substrate, and consisted of: 2.67 mM CaCl2  2 H2O, 276 M KCl, 2.13 mM 
MgSO4  7 H2O, 26.67 M Fe EDTA, 93.33 M H3BO3, 24 M MnCl2  4 H2O, 2.13 M 
ZnCl2, 1.33 M Na2MoO4  2 H2O, 0.8 M CuSO4  5 H2O, 1.33 g/L KH2PO4 and 1.52 
g/L Na2HPO4.  
2.2.3 Planting and growth conditions 
Planting was done in the fume hood under sterile conditions. Sterile nitrogen free 
nutrient solution (75 mL per plant) was mixed with 1 mL of the appropriate rhizobial 
inoculum (or sterile water for water controls), and poured over 500 mL pots (Azlon, 
Fisher) containing a mixture of silver sand and fine vermiculite (equal volumes) which 
had been autoclaved. Using sterile tweezers, a pre-germinated pea was then placed in the 
centre of the pot, the substrate just covering the pea. Pots were labelled, covered with 
cling-film, and placed in the growth room (21 C, 16 hour photoperiod). For each 
experiment, pots were placed in a single block and randomised within that block (Figure 
2-1). After two to five days, the cling-film was slit with a sterile knife to allow the 
emerging seedling to grow through the hole in the cling-film. Plants were grown for 
three to six weeks. From two weeks onwards, plants were watered with distilled sterile 
water as necessary.  
Figure 2-1. Pea plants growing in growth room. (a) Three experiments can be seen in three 
separate blocks. (b) Close-up of plants in the growth room. The cling-film covering the pots 
protects against cross-contamination of rhizobia between pots.  
2.2.4 Harvest 
At harvest, plants were removed from the growth room and taken out of the pot by 
removing the cling-film and gently pouring the substrate out of the pot while lightly 
shaking the plant. Unless acetylene reductions were carried out, roots were gently 
washed with water to remove sand and vermiculite from the root systems. Depending on 
the further procedures, shoots remained attached to the roots, or shoots were snipped off 
just above the pea, leaving the pea attached to the root system unless it fell off. 
2.3 Bacterial strains and culture conditions 
2.3.1 Bacterial strains 
Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae 3841 (Rlv3841) is the parent strain from which all 
other strains used here are derived. Rlv3841 is a spontaneous streptomycin resistant 
mutant of UK field isolate 30024. It has been an often used lab strain in the past four 
decades, nodulating both pea (Pisum sativum) and broad bean (Vicia faba), and its 
genome was published in 20064. Over the years, mutations in the genome or addition of 
plasmids via conjugations has led to many derivative strains of Rlv3841. The strains 
used here are presented in Table 2-1.

2.3.2 Culture conditions 
Rhizobium strains were grown at 28 C on Tryptone Yeast (TY) medium (5 g/L tryptone, 
3 g/L yeast extract, 6 mM CaCl2)
10, usually solidified with agar (1.75% w/v). Strains 
were grown on TY agar plates (petri dish) for three to four days to prepare for further 
use, to count colonies, or to carry out selections. Strains were grown on TY agar slopes 
(universal containing 10 mL agar solidified at an angle to increase surface area) for two 
to three days to grow up bacterial cultures for planting. TY agar was supplemented with 
antibiotics as was appropriate for the strain (see Table 2-1). If colonies needed to be 
distinguished via gusA marker genes, the TY agar was supplemented with 400 g/mL X-
glcA or magenta-glcA (Sigma-Aldrich) (see 2.4.3 for further explanation on GusA 
staining). 
2.3.3 Preparation of rhizobial inocula 
To prepare rhizobial inocula, strains were grown on TY agar slopes for two or three days 
at 28C. Slopes were then washed with 5 mL sterile distilled water, and the liquid now 
containing the rhizobia transferred to a clean Falcon tube. A sample of 1 mL was used to 
establish rhizobial density using spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 600 nm (Thermo 
Scientific Helios Gamma). Slopes were then diluted down with sterile water to OD600 = 
0.1 (corresponding to approximately 1 x 108 cells ml-1), and from there to the appropriate 
final inoculation density (1 x 102  1 x 108 cells ml-1). For mixed inoculations, rhizobial 
inocula were mixed in the appropriate ratio.  
2.3.4 Storage 
Rhizobial strains were kept on TY agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotics in 
the cold room (7 C) for short-term storage (up to a few weeks). For long term storage, 
strains were kept at -80 C in TY medium with 15-20% glycerol. 
2.4 Post-harvest procedures 
2.4.1 Shoot dry weight 
To measure shoot dry weight, shoots were placed in paper envelopes and incubated in a 
70C oven for at least 24 hours. Dried shoots were then taken out of the envelope and 
weighed using an Acculab Sartorius Group scale model ALC-80-40.  
2.4.2 Measuring nitrogen fixation by acetylene reduction 
Acetylene reduction rapidly became an often used assay of nitrogen fixation rates after it 
was developed at the end of 1960s11. The method has also been extensively criticised, 
the main concern being that reduction rates are affected during the assay12 and by 
disturbing the root system13. The assay is also only suitable for measuring rates of 
nitrogen fixation at a specific point in time, not over the lifetime of a plant14. Alternative 
methods include measuring nitrogen accumulation in plants grown with rhizobia as the 
sole nitrogen source, and stable isotope analysis in which 15N in plant tissue is measured 
after incubation in a 15N-enriched atmosphere (virtually all atmospheric nitrogen is 
14N)14. These methods also have their problems, and are considerably more time-
consuming. Acetylene reductions have therefore remained a standard way of measuring 
nitrogen fixation rates. 
 Acetylene reductions provide a measure of nitrogen fixation rates because the 
nitrogenase enzyme that normally reduces atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) 
(Reaction 2-1), also reduces acetylene (C2H2) to ethylene (C2H4) (Reaction 2-2)

HCCH+2H++2e-

          H2C=CH2 
Reaction 2-2 
The nitrogenase activity is greater for acetylene reduction than for nitrogen fixation16, so 
a measure of nitrogen fixation rates can be obtained by incubating nodulated roots in an 
atmosphere with acetylene and measuring the amount of ethylene produced by gas 
chromatography17.  
 Roots were placed on a damp piece of tissue paper in 250 mL Schott bottles (total 
volume 320 mL) with rubber seal lids, taking care not to damage any part of the root or 
attached shoot. With a syringe, 8 mL of air was removed from the Schott bottle and 
replaced by 6.4 mL of acetylene gas, resulting in a concentration of 2% acetylene inside 
the bottle. After incubation for one hour, three replicate samples of 1 mL were taken 
from the bottles. The samples were analysed by gas chromatography (Clarus 480, 
Perkin-Elmer).  
 To calculate the amount of ethylene produced, the fraction of acetylene converted 
was calculated as % ethylene / (% ethylene + % acetylene), based on the percentages 
ethylene and acetylene measured in the samples. The initial amount of acetylene added 
was 261.5982 mol (based on 6.4 mL of gas added and 24.465 L mol-1). Multiplying the 
fraction of acetylene converted by the amount of acetylene initially added, yields the 
amount of ethylene produced.  
2.4.3 Distinguishing strains based on GusA and CelB staining 
The gusA and celB marker genes were used to visually distinguish between rhizobial 
strains after nodule formation on plants. The gusA gene, derived from E. coli, encodes 
for -glucuronidase (GUS)18. Providing strains which have the gusA gene with 
glucuronide substrates such as X-glcA (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl--D-glucuronide) or 
magenta-glcA (5-bromo-6-chloro-3-indolyl--D-glucuronic acid), results in precipitates 
staining nodules containing the strain blue or magenta, respectively19. The gene is not 
naturally present in plants, nor in Rhizobium strains, and therefore very useful as a 
marker gene18. The celB gene used as a marker comes from the hyperthermophilic 
archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus. It encodes a thermostable -glucosidase with a high -
galactosidase activity, which is active up to 100 C19. Plants and Rhizobium naturally 
have high -galactosidase activity, but this is not thermostable and can easily be 
inactivated with heat treatment19. Thus, heat treating nodules before supplying the X-gal 
substrate (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl--D-galactoside) renders only nodules containing 
strains with the thermostable celB marker gene blue19. Staining for GusA and CelB is 
fatal for rhizobia, so the method is incompatible with, for example, counting viable 
rhizobia.  
 To stain nodules based on gusA and celB marker genes, a post-harvest protocol 
(as previously described19) was followed. Roots were submerged upside down in 40 mL 
phosphate buffer (NaH2PO4 7 g/L, Na2HPO4 7.2 g/L, EDTA 1 mM (pH 8), Sarkosyl 1%, 
Triton 1 mL/L), in 50 mL Falcon tubes covered with aluminium foil, as the substrates are 
light sensitive. For GusA staining, X-glcA or magenta-glcA (Sigma-Aldrich) was added 
to a final concentration of 200 g mL-1 and the roots were incubated overnight at 28 C. 
For CelB staining, roots were submerged in preheated phosphate buffer and incubated at 
70 C for at least one hour. Then, X-gal (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final 
concentration of 250 g mL-1 and the roots were incubated overnight at 37 C. If just a 
single strain was marked, the gusA marker gene was used and nodules were stained 
either blue (X-glcA) or magenta (magenta-glcA). If two strains were marked, GusA 
staining (using magenta-glcA) and CelB staining were done sequentially, transferring the 
roots to fresh (preheated) phosphate buffer after the GusA staining. Stocks of X-glcA, 
magenta-glcA and X-gal solutions were made at 20 mg mL-1 in dimethylformamide 
(DMF), and usually made fresh for each use. 
2.4.4 Photographing root systems 
Root systems of harvested plants were usually photographed for later data collection and 
preservation. Roots were gently washed to remove sand and vermiculite if this had not 
already been done. They were carefully dried with tissue paper, and then spread out on 
120 mm x 120 mm square petri dishes, making sure that all nodules were visible. The 
root systems were photographed by John Baker (Department of Plant Sciences, 
University of Oxford). Photographs were taken against a black background (black cloth) 
and against a white background (light box underneath the plate). The lids of the petri 
dishes were removed before taking the photograph and roots were illuminated from two 
sides. Photographs were taken using Nikon D300 or D700, with an exposure time as 
needed and no flash. 
2.4.5 Microscopy 
Microscopy was used to identify mixed nodules, and to capture nodule phenotypes of 
both mixed and singly infected nodules. Photographs were taken using a dissecting 
microscope (Leica M165 FC) with accompanying software (LAS v4.5).  
2.4.6 Counting nodules and measuring nodule area 
The photographed root systems were used to count nodules and measure their area. 
Nodules were counted while marking them in Microsoft Paint, to make it easier to keep 
track of which nodules were counted and allowing for zooming in as necessary. To 
measure nodule area, the ten largest nodules of each strain were selected by eye and 
marked in Microsoft Paint. To reduce variability within treatments, the ten largest, 
rather than randomly selected, nodules were measured to ensure nodules of similar 
developmental stage were compared (younger nodules are smaller). Then, each 
photograph was opened in ImageJ v1.49v20. The scale was set using 10 mm of the scale 
bar, and for each nodule, the contour around it was drawn so that the ImageJ software 
could measure the area inside the drawn shape. If nodules of different strains were 
measured, the picture file was not closed between measuring the different strains, so that 
the same scale bar settings were used for all nodules on a given plant. Photographs of 
root systems were processed in this way in random order within each experiment.

3.2 Abstract 
In legume-rhizobia symbioses, specialised soil bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen in return 
for carbon. However, ineffective strains can arise, making discrimination essential. 
Discrimination can occur via partner choice, where legumes prevent ineffective strains 
from entering, or via sanctioning, where plants provide fewer resources. Several studies 
have inferred that legumes exercise partner choice, but the rhizobia compared were not 
otherwise isogenic. To test when and how plants discriminate ineffective strains we 
developed sets of fixing and non-fixing strains that differed only in the expression of 
nifH  essential for nitrogen fixation  and could be visualised using marker genes. We 
show that the plant is unable to select against the non-fixing strain at the point of entry, 
but that non-fixing nodules are sanctioned. We also used the technique to characterise 
mixed nodules (containing both a fixing and a non-fixing strain), whose frequency could 
be predicted using a simple diffusion model. We discuss that sanctioning is likely to 
evolve in preference to partner choice in any symbiosis where partner quality cannot be 
adequately assessed until goods or services are actively exchanged.
3.3 Introduction 
Across the globe primary productivity is nitrogen limited1. This limitation has been 
overcome for plants in the family Fabaceae (commonly known as legumes) through a 
mutualistic association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria collectively called rhizobia2. The 
nitrogen provided through this symbiosis makes legumes rich in protein and important 
crops in human diets3. But, as ineffective strains will inevitably arise through mutation, 
there is the potential for the relationship to break down. Ineffective strains are known to 
be common, at least in some situations, which for agricultural legumes means poor yields 
and reduced nutritional quality4,5.  
 Theory predicts that ineffective strains could be successful within legume  
rhizobia symbioses for two reasons6,7. First, rhizobia are not transmitted directly from 
parent plant to offspring. Instead, plants acquire rhizobia from the soil through an 
intricate signalling process in which bacteria enter specialised root nodules, where they 
fix nitrogen in return for plant-derived carbon8. This horizontal transmission means that 
rhizobial fitness is not perfectly aligned with the fitness of the host plant7. Second, 
although each nodule is usually occupied by the clonal descendants of a single rhizobial 
bacterium9,10, a plant is usually infected by multiple rhizobial strains11,12. Thus, a non-
fixing strain can potentially thrive by taking plant resources while leaving the costly 
process of nitrogen fixation to others7,13. To prevent losing resources to ineffective 
rhizobial strains that provide little or no nitrogen, legumes have two options: partner 
choice or sanctions7.  
Partner choice is usually defined as any mechanism that allows detection of 
suitable partners before a mutualistic relationship is established7,1315, while sanctioning 
is a mechanism to discriminate against low-quality partners once the relationship is 
underway6,7,1316 (although confusingly partner choice has also been used to describe a 
broader concept which includes sanctioning13,17,18). Partner choice might seem to be the 
more attractive option as resources are not wasted setting up a relationship that is 
doomed to fail. But crucially, effective partner choice requires accurate assessment of the 
quality of partners in advance13. This is likely to be problematical for any symbiosis in 
which key traits are not manifested prior to the relationship being established. For 
example, in the legume-rhizobia symbiosis, nitrogen fixation does not begin until the 
bacteria have entered the roots and nodule formation is sufficiently advanced for rhizobia 
to have differentiated into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids8. Once nodules are established they 
can be sanctioned, if they prove to be ineffective, by cutting off their supply of carbon, 
oxygen or other nutrients and this has been demonstrated empirically using argon gas to 
force nodules to fix less nitrogen1921.  
Despite the empirical support for sanctioning and its apparent advantages, there 
are nevertheless several studies that claim evidence for partner choice7,14,15. However, the 
interpretation of these studies is problematic because the tested strains are rarely isogenic 
 meaning that strains differ in several traits, and not just in how much nitrogen they 
provide. Most importantly, strains are likely to differ in their competitiveness in 
colonizing plant roots and forming nodules. A range of traits affects competitiveness: 
examples including motility22, production of antibiotics23 and the secretion of proteins 
and polysaccharides involved in biofilm formation and root attachment24. Such 
differences in competitiveness explain why poorly-fixing strains can also end up 
occupying a higher proportion of nodules  a problem that is often encountered when 
developing effective strains for use in agricultural settings4,25,26. Thus comparing the 
nodulation success of naturally occurring strains is difficult to interpret as a test of 
partner choice.  
To test whether plants can directly assess the effectiveness of potential rhizobia 
prior to nodulation we created a non-fixing mutant from a fixing strain and compared 
their success in colonising pea plant nodules. There are several key genes involved in 
nitrogen fixation8, any of which could undergo a mutation that would render the gene 
non-functional and hence transform the fixing into a non-fixing strain. We chose the nifH 
gene in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae (Rlv) 3841, and created a non-fixing 
mutant that was otherwise identical to its fixing parent strain. We then assessed when 
and how the plant discriminated between the two strains. To identify strains, they were 
marked with gusA or celB marker genes, rendering strains magenta or blue (respectively) 
following the application of a simple post-harvest staining protocol. Insertion of marker 
genes solves a secondary problem as it is usually extremely time-consuming to identify 
different strains using antibiotic markers and this limits the number of nodules that can 
be assessed.  
 One possible complication is that a non-fixing strain can potentially thrive via 
mixed nodules (where two different bacteria have entered and colonised). If a non-fixing 
strain can take advantage of mixed nodules to increase its fitness at the expense of the 
fixing strain, then this would provide a route by which non-fixing strains could increase 
in frequency. Currently little is known about the frequency at which mixed nodules 
occur, and the relative fitness of strains within mixed nodules. The staining protocol 
rendered mixed nodules easily visible, so we assessed the frequency of mixed nodules 
under different inoculation densities. We discuss mixed nodules, partner choice and 
sanctioning in the context of the evolutionary stability of the legume-rhizobia symbiosis.
3.4 Results 
In single inoculations, the non-fixing mutant strain reduced shoot mass and formed small 
white nodules, while the fixing parent strain formed larger pink nodules (indicating the 
presence of leghaemoglobin) (Figure 3-1).  
Figure 3-1. Comparison of the non-fixing strain RU3940, (a, c) and the otherwise isogenic 
fixing strain Rlv3841 (b, d). After five weeks of growth, plants inoculated with the non-fixing 
strain (a) had reduced biomass and produced fewer peas than those inoculated with the fixing 
strain (b). The non-fixing strain formed white (c) rather than pink (d), nodules, indicating a 
lack of leghaemoglobin. Scale bars indicate 200 m.  
3.4.1 Partner choice 
To test for partner choice, we varied the ratio of the fixing: non-fixing strains in the 
inoculum (1:10, 1:1 and 10:1) and counted the number of fixing and non-fixing nodules 
after three weeks. In the absence of partner choice, we expect the percentage of nodules 
containing the fixing strain to reflect the percentage in the inoculum. In other words, we 
expect a 1:1 relationship between the percentage of fixing nodules and the percentage of 
the fixing strain in the inoculum (a slope of 1.0 through the origin). We found that the 
percentage of nodules containing only the fixing strain exactly reflected the percentage 
of the fixing strain in the inoculum (Figure 3-2). The slope of the regression line was 
0.99  0.02 (95% CI [0.95, 1.02]) and this is not significantly different from 1.0 (t39 = -
0.835, p = 0.41). The intercept was not significantly different from zero (t39 = -1.338, p = 
0.189). Whether the fixing strain was marked with gusA or celB had no impact on the 
proportion of fixing nodules formed (t37 = -0.177, p = 0.861) or on the interaction with 
the inoculum ratio (t37 = -0.189, p = 0.851). Thus, pea plants do not discriminate between 
fixing and non-fixing strains prior to nodule formation and are therefore unable to 
exercise partner choice against the mutant strain.  
Figure 3-2. We found no evidence of partner choice. (a)  (c) show pea root systems with 
stained nodules following inoculation with different ratios of a fixing celB (blue) 
marked strain (3841 celB) and a non-fixing gusA (magenta) marked mutant strain 
(OPS0365): (a) 1:10 (fixing:non-fixing); (b) 1:1 (fixing:non-fixing); (c) 10:1 
(fixing:non-fixing). (d) The percentage of nodules containing only the fixing strain 
exactly reflected the percentage of the fixing strain in the inoculum. The slope of the 
regression was 0.99  0.02, 95% CI [0.95, 1.02] and this is not significantly different 
from one (t39 = -0.835, p = 0.41). 
3.4.2 Nodule size 
In the absence of partner choice, sanctions remain the only option for discriminating 
against non-fixing strains. If pea plants are able to sanction and differentially allocate 
resources on the basis of the nitrogen provided, we expect nodules containing a fixing 
strain to be larger than nodules containing a non-fixing strain. We therefore measured the 
sizes of a sample of nodules colonised by the different strains. Nodules containing the 
nitrogen-fixing strain were significantly larger than nodules containing the non-fixing 
strain (paired t-test, t13 = 7.7176, p = 3.307 x 10
-6), indicating that pea plants 
preferentially allocated resources to fixing nodules, supporting sanctioning. Fixing 
nodules had an average area of 1.20  0.07 mm2 (mean  s.e.), and non-fixing nodules 
were 0.68 mm2 (95% CI [0.49; 0.87]) smaller  less than half of the area of fixing 
nodules (Figure 3-3). 
 Figure 3-3. Legumes sanction non-fixing 
nodules. Nodules containing the fixing 
strain were significantly larger than 
nodules containing the fixing strain (paired 
t-test, t13 = 7.7176, p = 3.307 x 10
indicating that pea plants preferentially 
allocated resources to fixing nodules. 
3.4.3 Total number of nodules 
Each pea plant formed 183  12 nodules (mean  s.e.) on average. The total number of 
nodules (Figure 3-4) decreased as the percentage of nitrogen-fixing nodules increased 
(slope =  0.88  0.34, t39 = -2.565, p = 0.0143), probably because the nodulation 
process is inhibited once fixing nodules have been successfully established. A ten-fold 
increase in the percentage of nitrogen-fixing nodules resulted in 72 fewer nodules in total 
(95% CI [9, 135])  a decrease of about 30%. 
 Figure 3-4. Total nodule number. The 
total number of nodules decreased as 
the percentage of fixing nodules 
increased (slope =  0.88  0.34, t39 = -
2.565, p = 0.0143). Regression with 
95% confidence interval shown. 
3.4.4 Shoot mass 
After three weeks of growth we found no differences in shoot dry mass among 
treatments, including water controls, (F3, 44 = 2.1921, p = 0.1024), presumably because 
the pea seeds contain large reserves of nitrogen. However, after five weeks of growth, 
independently grown plants inoculated with non-fixing RU3940 weighed 0.32  0.04 
grams (mean  s.e.) while plants inoculated with the fixing strain Rlv3841 weighed 0.68 
 0.04 grams, a significant difference of 0.37 grams (95% CI [0.23, 0.51]). 
3.4.5 Frequency of mixed nodules 
The staining technique allowed clear visualization of mixed nodules, which occasionally 
appeared to result from multiple independent infections (Figure 3-5A), but normally 
consisted of two  a fixing and a non-fixing strain (Figure 3-5B, C). Mixed nodules 
occurred at an average frequency of 2.02%  0.35% (mean  s.e.), and the frequency 
depended on the inoculum ratio (Figure 3-5D). According to a simple diffusion model 
(in which we assume that the two rhizobial strains in the soil are well mixed) the 
predicted frequency of mixed nodules (F) is simply given by F = pq, where p is the 
frequency of the fixing strain, q is the frequency of the non-fixing strain and  is the 
unknown probability with which two bacteria simultaneously enter the same nodule; 
hence: F  pq. We regressed F against pq (encounter rate, Figure 3-5D) and found that 
the frequency of mixed nodules indeed increased in proportion to the increase in 
encounter rate: a  three-fold increase in encounter rate increased the odds of a mixed 
infection 3.5 times (95% CI [2.2, 5.9], n = 41). In an additional experiment, we varied 
the total inoculation density, as the diffusion model also predicts that mixed nodules 
occur more often at higher densities of rhizobia. As predicted, we found that the 
percentage of mixed nodules increased with inoculation density (slope = 1.87  0.41, t18 
= 4.545, p = 0.000251). A 10-fold increase in inoculation density, increased the 
percentage of mixed nodules by almost 2%.

seems to have been infected by more than two rhizobia. The nitrogen-fixing strain is celB

(OPS0365). (b) Microscopic image of a mixed nodule on a pea root infected by two rhizobia.

The gusA marked nitrogen-fixing strain (3841 gusA) is magenta, and the celB marked non-

probability that different strains encounter each other during nodule formation is higher (t39 = 
4.913, p = 1.65 x 10-5). Generalised linear model with quasibinomial distribution and logit 
link function shown with 95% confidence interval.  
3.4.6 Fitness of rhizobial strains within mixed nodules 
To assess the relative fitness of fixing versus non-fixing strains within mixed nodules, 
we measured the area occupied by each strain as indicated by the area stained blue versus 
magenta (or vice versa). We found that the percentage of nodule area occupied by the 
fixing strain ranged from 1.1 to 99 %. Unfortunately, although the staining technique is 
valuable in visualizing mixed nodules, we conclude that it cannot be reliably used to 
assess the relative fitness of different strains within mixed nodules. The percentage of the 
nodule occupied by the fixing strain depended highly on the marker used to identify the 
fixing strain (t218 = 14.49, p < 2 x 10
-16). If the fixing strain was marked with gusA, it 
appeared to occupy 31% of the nodule (95% CI [27.5; 33.6%]), but if the fixing strain 
was marked with celB, it appeared to occupy 75% of the nodule (95% CI [68.7; 80.0%].
3.5 Discussion 
We created a non-fixing but otherwise isogenic mutant to mimic a process that might 
occur in nature, where a mutation arises in a fixing rhizobial strain, rendering it 
ineffective. We found that pea plants could not discriminate between these fixing and 
non-fixing strains prior to nodule formation. Pea plants were therefore unable to detect 
whether the potential partner was effective at fixing nitrogen and could not prevent the 
formation of non-fixing nodules. Our results are supported by an early study using 
similar isogenic strains27, but this study was severely limited in sample size and has 
therefore been overlooked. 
 Our results indicate that partner choice is not a robust mechanism against 
ineffective strains as pea plants were unable to prevent non-fixing strains from entering. 
It could be argued that legumes may use genes other than nifH to assess the nitrogen 
fixation capacity of fixing strains before nodule formation; however we believe that this 
is unlikely. A mutation rendering a strain less effective can arise in any gene and 
effective partner choice would then require a mutation in the plant genome to detect this 
change. If the new mutation stops the cheat from entering, then it will spread through the 
plant population; however, given that rhizobial generation times are much faster than 
host plant generation times28, it seems that the host plants will be locked in an 
evolutionary arms race that they are doomed to lose; hence partner choice seems to be an 
ineffective way to stabilise the mutualism in the long term21. Furthermore, partner choice 
is susceptible to dishonest signals13.  
 In contrast, we found that pea plants did discriminate against ineffective 
strains via sanctioning, which has been previously reported using argon gas to replace 
atmospheric nitrogen1921. In our experiment, nodules containing the non-fixing strain 
were roughly half the size of fixing nodules, indicating reduced plant resources. In 
contrast to the case of partner choice, sanctioning can stabilise the mutualism in the long-
term. If a mutation arises that allows a plant to detect and sanction a partner that is not 
delivering the goods it would be effective against a wide variety of future ineffective 
strains. Thus, sanctioning allows an instantaneous response to ineffective strains and 
does not require specific recognition genes or rely on honest signals. Sanctioning is 
therefore a more robust13 mechanism against ineffective strains and can provide long-
term stability to legume-rhizobia mutualisms16,29.  
However, any discussion of sanctioning should take into account both plant and 
rhizobial fitness. Sanctioning can only be selected for when it saves plant resources and 
thus increases plant fitness. The reduced nodule size that we and others20,21 have seen 
indicates that plants allocate fewer resources to non-fixing nodules. Whether this reduced 
resource allocation also reduces rhizobial fitness and thus stabilises the mutualism on 
evolutionary time-scales is more difficult to establish. This may depend on whether or 
not the nitrogen-fixing bacteroids can still reproduce (usually determinate nodules), or 
are terminally differentiated and unable to reproduce (indeterminate nodules)30. In 
studies using argon gas, reduced rhizobial fitness has been shown in both determinate19,20 
and indeterminate21 non-fixing nodules. However, in a study using a non-fixing isogenic 
strain, the fitness of non-fixing rhizobia was not reduced in determinate soybean nodules 
up to five weeks old31. Because effects on rhizobial viability may emerge later in the 
sanctioning process, perhaps the best test would be a multigenerational experiment, 
where in the first generation plants are inoculated with both fixing and non-fixing strains, 
and new plants are then repeatedly grown in the same soil for several generations to see 
how quickly the non-fixing strain is eliminated. It would be of special interest to perform 
such an experiment with both indeterminate and determinate species.  
Evidence from other mutualisms suggests that whether partner choice evolves in 
preference to sanctioning critically depends on how well partners can assess quality prior 
to establishment of the mutualistic relationship including the potential for dishonest 
signalling. For example, clients of the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus have evolved 
partner choice to counter cheating by individuals that take healthy tissue while removing 
parasites32. Partner choice is highly effective in this mutualism because the quality of 
service is known from previous experience and there are repeated interactions between 
individuals. In contrast, sanctioning has evolved in mutualisms between yucca moths and 
fig wasps and their respective plant hosts. In both cases the insects deposit seed-eating 
larvae in the flowers of host plants in return for pollination. In these mutualisms, plants 
cannot prevent eggs being laid nor assess partner quality, hence sanctioning has evolved: 
flowers containing too many eggs33, or too little pollen33,34 are selectively aborted. 
While our study shows that partner choice is not a robust mechanism to exclude 
ineffective strains, legumes do not form symbioses with all potential rhizobial strains. 
Instead, an extensive signalling process3537 between legumes and their rhizobial partners 
can impose a high degree of selectivity on the relationship36,38,39, although the degree of 
selectivity varies greatly among hosts39. There are two explanations for this selectivity 
that are commonly proposed and are not mutually exclusive. First, specificity may arise 
in order to prevent the entry of pathogenic bacteria which utilise similar signalling 
pathways to gain access to host roots38,40,41. Second, by fine-tuning signalling pathways 
to target rhizobia that are particularly effective for a specific host, legume species might 
achieve greater nitrogen-fixation efficiency42,43. This is likely to be true if host 
environments are sufficiently different that specialization by rhizobia is selected for. 
Support for specialization comes from the observation that a single rhizobial strain can 
vary greatly in its effectiveness among hosts42. This type of co-evolutionary process is 
separate from the need to avoid non-fixing rhizobia, which can arise by mutation at any 
time, in any strain, even those that are usually highly effective. That these two processes 
are indeed separate is supported by the fact that the genes involved in nitrogen fixation 
(nif and fix genes) are only expressed once the symbiosis has been established44 and are 
different from the signalling genes involved in infection (nod genes)45. Currently, 
genomic analyses are shedding more light on the selective pressures affecting both 
legume and rhizobial genes4648.  
 Sanctioning is a robust mechanism against ineffective strains, but requires hosts 
to monitor partner quality and provide resources accordingly. Currently, little is known 
about the exact mechanism behind sanctioning in legume-rhizobia symbioses, and 
whether it only takes place at the nodule level, or also occurs within nodules13,16. If 
sanctioning takes place at the nodule level, mixed nodules could be a way for ineffective 
strains to avoid sanctions6,13,49. Indeed certain endosymbionts, even those belonging to 
different genera and lacking any genes for nitrogen fixation, have been shown to co-
infect nodules by piggybacking on the genuine symbionts as they infect the root 
hairs50. Whether mixed nodules allow ineffective strains to persist depends on the 
frequency of mixed nodules, and on the relative fitness of fixing and non-fixing strains 
within mixed nodules. Estimates of the frequency of mixed nodules in the literature 
range from 2% to 74%6,51. Our findings at least partly explain this variability as the 
frequencies we found could be adequately represented by a simple diffusion model, 
which predicts that more mixed nodules are expected: (1) at high rhizobial densities; (2) 
when the proportions of different strains are similar; and (3) when rhizobia diffuse more 
easily, which might occur, for example, under wet conditions. Although the staining 
technique is valuable in identifying strains and characterising mixed nodules, it could not 
be used reliably to assess fitness of rhizobial strains within mixed nodules. Further work 
on the mechanism of sanctioning, how it is affected by external conditions such as soil 
nitrogen, and how it affects rhizobial fitness will help illuminate how the legume-
rhizobia mutualism has persisted for much longer than humans have been around to reap 
its benefits.
3.6 Methods 
3.6.1 Bacterial strains and culture conditions 
We used Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae (Rlv) 3841 strains labelled at identical 
positions in the chromosome with either a gusA or a celB marker gene52 (Table 1). Non-
fixing mutants of these strains were made by replacing the nifH gene with a nifH gene 
disrupted by a spectinomycin resistance cassette (nifH::Spc). Rhizobium 
leguminosarum only has a single copy of the nifH gene53, which is essential for nitrogen 
fixation54 . First, an unmarked non-fixing strain was made, then the non-functional nifH 
gene was transduced into the marked fixing strains. To make the unmarked non-fixing 
strain, the nifH gene was amplified by PCR (2,660 bp product) using primers p950 and 
p951 that contain a SacI and SpeI restriction site and cloned into pCR2.1 in Dam- E.coli 
SCS110 (Stratagene) (pRU1907). A  spectinomycin cassette from pHP45-Sp was 
cloned between two NruI sites within nifH resulting in a 166 bp deletion, and the 
nifH::Spc fragment was cloned into the suicide vector pJQ200SK (pRU1908). Plasmid 
pRU1908 was conjugated into Rlv3841, and cells were plated on TY agar with 
gentamicin (20 g ml1) and then on AMS agar supplemented with 10% sucrose, 10 mM 
NH4Cl, and spectinomycin (100 g ml
1) to select for gene replacement. Strain RU3940 
was found to contain the correct nifH::Spc mutation by PCR mapping using pOT 
forward with either p1002 or p1118 in separate reactions. To confirm differences in the 
nitrogen-fixing capacity of the two strains, we performed acetylene reductions on plants 
inoculated with either RU3940 or Rlv3841. RU3940 does not fix nitrogen (0.05  0.02 
(mean  s.e, n = 3) mol ethylene per plant per hour, which is not different from water 
control plants (t6 = -0.025, p = 0.98)), whereas the parent strain Rlv3841 does fix 
nitrogen (2.58  0.33 (mean  s.e, n = 3) mol ethylene per plant per hour). 
The nifH::Spc cassette from non-fixing strain RU3940 was transduced into the gusA or 
celB marked strains using phage RL3855, yielding non-fixing gusA (OPS0365) and celB 
(OPS0366) marked strains which are otherwise isogenic to their fixing gusA and celB 
marked parent strains. Correct insertion of the nifH::Spc cassette from RU3940 was 
confirmed by PCR mapping using pOT forward with either oxp460 or opx461 in 
separate reactions (Supplementary Fig. S1 online). Enzyme assays on free living cultures 
confirmed conservation of the gusA and celB marker genes in the non-fixing mutants 
(Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Fig. S3 respectively). Bacterial cultures were 
maintained on TY agar56 with 500 g ml1 streptomycin (all strains) and 100 g ml1 
spectinomycin (RU3940, OPS0365 and OPS0366 only).  
3.6.2 Plant growth 
Pea (Pisum sativum cv Avola) seeds were germinated in the dark for five days on agar 
plates at room temperature and then transferred to 500 ml pots containing a mixture of 
silver sand - fine vermiculite (1:1 v/v) substrate, 75 ml nitrogen free nutrient solution (as 
in Poole et al.57 but 2.67 times more concentrated) and 1 ml rhizobial inoculum. Peas 
were grown in the growth room at 21 C with a 16 hour photoperiod. 
3.6.3 Experimental designs 
To test for partner choice, we applied rhizobial inocula consisting of 1:10, 1:1 and 10:1 
ratios of fixing to non-fixing strains. To exclude any effect of the gusA or celB marker 
genes, both combinations were tested: fixing gusA (3841 gusA) with non-fixing celB 
(OPS0366) strains and fixing celB (3841 celB) with non-fixing gusA (OPS0365) strains. 
Total inoculum density for all treatments was 1 x 104 cells per pot. Rhizobial cultures for 
the inocula were spread-plated to confirm numbers of rhizobia in the inocula. In a fully 
randomised design, we grew 49 plants in total: six treatments plus a water control (no 
rhizobia), all replicated seven times. Plants were grown for 21 days without additional 
watering.  
 To assess the effect of inoculation density on the frequency of mixed nodules, 
plants were inoculated with 1:1 ratios of fixing gusA (3841 gusA) to non-fixing celB 
(OPS0366) strains at total densities of 1 x 102, 1 x 103, 1 x 106 and 1x 108 cells per pot. 
In a fully randomised design, we grew five plants at each inoculum density plus two 
water controls. Plants were grown for 38 days and watered with sterilised water as 
needed after 21 days.  
 To test for differences in markers on the percentage of the nodule area occupied 
by the fixing strain, six plants were grown in an additional independent experiment, 
inoculated with 1:1 ratios of fixing celB (3841 celB) to non-fixing gusA strains 
(OPS0365) at a total density of 1 x 10^8 cells per pot. Plants were grown for 37 days and 
watered with sterilised water as needs after 21 days. 
 To assess the phenotype of non-fixing mutant strain RU3940, plants were 
inoculated with either fixing strain Rlv3841 or non-fixing strain RU3940 and grown for 
four or five weeks in independent experiments.  
3.6.4 Harvest 
At harvest, roots were gently washed and then stained for gusA and celB marker genes58. 
In aluminium covered tubes, roots were incubated overnight at 28 C submerged in 
phosphate buffer (7 g L-1 NaH2PO4, 7.2 g L
-1 Na2HPO4, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8), 1% 
Sarkosyl, 1 ml L-1 Triton) supplemented with 0.2 mg ml-1 Magenta-glc (5-bromo-6-
chloro-3-indolyl--D-glucuronide). In fresh phosphate buffer, roots were then incubated 
at 70 C for 1 hour 45 min. After cooling down, X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl--D-
galactopyranoside) was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mg ml-1 and roots were 
incubated overnight at 37 C. This yielded visibly magenta (gusA marked strains), blue 
(celB marked strains) or magenta and blue (mixed) nodules (Fig. 2 A-C). Shoots were 
dried at 70 degrees Celsius for 24-72 hours and then weighed.  
3.6.5 Data collection 
Roots were carefully laid out so that all nodules were visible and then photographed. 
Two people independently counted blue and magenta nodules from photographs taken of 
whole roots, zooming in as necessary, and the average was taken as the final count. 
Mixed nodules were counted and photographed using a dissecting microscope (Leica 
M165 FC) with accompanying software (LAS v4.5). To estimate size of nodules 
containing fixing versus non-fixing strains, we measured the area of nodules from the 
photographs taken of the whole root, using ImageJ v1.49v59, which allowed for 
measuring areas of irregular shapes. Ten fixing and ten non-fixing nodules were 
randomly selected for each of the 14 plants inoculated with a 1:1 ratio of fixing to non-
fixing strains (7 of which had the gusA marked fixing strain and 7 had the celB marked 
fixing strain). To estimate the percentage of mixed nodules that was occupied by the 
fixing strain, we measured the areas of blue and magenta in all mixed nodules for which 
this was possible (distinct enough areas of blue and magenta), using ImageJ. Additional 
microscopy was done on whole nodules (five-week-old nodules). Images were taken 
with a dissecting microscope (Leica M165 FC) with accompanying software (LAS v4.5). 
3.6.6 Statistical analyses 
We tested for partner choice by regressing the percentage of nodules containing nitrogen-
fixing rhizobia against the percentage of nitrogen-fixing rhizobia in the inoculum. If 
plants do not exert partner choice, we expect a 1:1 relationship (a slope of 1.0). Water 
controls and mixed nodules were excluded from this analysis. To test whether the 
presence of gusA versus celB marker genes affected competitive ability, we carried out 
an ANCOVA with the marker gene as the categorical variable. Results presented are 
from the regression model without this interaction, as marker genes did not affect the 
slope (t37 =  0.189, p = 0.851) or intercept (t37 =  0.177, p = 0.861) of the regression 
line. The intended inoculation ratios were used as the explanatory variable, as it was 
confirmed using colony counts that the actual ratios in inocula did not deviate by more 
than 11% from intended inoculation ratios (n = 6, mean  s.e. 3.78  1.49 %, 
Supplementary Table S1 online). Accounting for this deviation did not change results, 
and if anything would lead to a decrease of the estimate of the slope (whereas for partner 
choice we would expect an increase of the estimate of the slope). 
 To test for differences in size between fixing and non-fixing nodules, we 
performed a paired t-test on the average size of ten nodules, pairing fixing and non-fixing 
nodules of each plant. To test whether the total number of nodules formed depended on 
the ratio of fixing to non-fixing strains in the inoculum, we regressed the total number of 
nodules against the percentage of fixing strain in the inoculum. Shoot mass was also 
regressed against the percentage of the fixing strain in the inoculum. To assess the 
frequency of mixed nodules, we analysed how the occurrence of mixed nodules 
depended on the inoculation ratio of fixing to non-fixing strains with a generalised linear 
model using a quasibinomial distribution and a logit link function (because data were 
expressed as proportions and there was significant overdispersion). We also regressed 
the percentage of mixed nodules against the log of the total inoculation density. Whether 
the fixing strain was marked with gusA or celB had no impact on the proportion of mixed 
nodules detected (t37 = 0.494, p = 0.62493) or on the interaction with the encounter rate 
(t37 = 1.137, p = 0.26301), so we present results from analyses which do not include this 
interaction. To assess fitness of fixing to non-fixing strains within mixed nodules, we 
used a linear model testing for the effect of the marker (gusA or celB) used to mark the 
fixing strain. Individual nodules were seen as the unit of replication, and this was 
confirmed to be a valid assumption as the plant from which nodules came accounted for 
only 9% of the variation in the data. All analyses were performed in R version 3.0.260.

4.1 Overview 
This chapter describes a mathematical model of plant growth which was used to 
investigate plant resource allocation to rhizobia in the case of (i) a single strain and (ii) 
multiple strains, under variable soil nitrogen conditions. The aim of the modelling is to 
formulate hypotheses, which are then tested experimentally (chapter 5). In contrast to 
other chapters, methods are described before the results, because a description of the 
model is needed for the results to make sense. Mathematical derivations are described in 
numbered boxes, but full verbal explanations are given in the main text as well. The 
results are to be published together with the results of chapter 5. An excerpt of the R 
code used to implement the model, showing the approach followed, can be found in 
Appendix C. The full version of the R code is available in the Oxford Research Archive 
(ORA-Data) repository, DOI: 10.5287/bodleian:BDVypApax. 
4.2 Abstract 
Plants of the legume family can obtain nitrogen via both root uptake and rhizobial 
nitrogen fixation. Rhizobial strains vary in how much nitrogen they provide 
(effectiveness) and in how efficiently they do so, both of which may affect plant growth. 
It has been suggested that plants sanction strains providing little benefit by reducing 
resource allocation. Sanctioning can be selected for if plant growth is enhanced by 
differentially allocating resources to rhizobial strains. But it is unclear how plants should 
allocate resources among multiple strains to optimise growth, and whether optimal 
resource allocation depends only on how much nitrogen strains provide or also on how 
much carbon they demand.  
 We used mathematical modelling to establish how plants should allocate 
resources to maximise growth, and therefore fitness and yield. The model is based on the 
assumption that plant growth is either carbon- or nitrogen-limited. Analytical solutions 
were derived for optimal resource allocation to (i) a single rhizobial strain, and (ii) 
multiple rhizobial strains, under variable soil nitrogen conditions. The model explicitly 
describes easily observable outcomes  the dry mass of different plant tissues  and can 
therefore be used to formulate testable hypotheses. 
 We found that strains with high carbon demands should only be invested in by 
strongly nitrogen-limited plants, so that a threshold soil nitrogen concentration can be 
defined for each rhizobial strain, beyond which they should no longer receive resources. 
The value of this threshold concentration depends on both the effectiveness and the 
efficiency of the strain. We further predict that it is always optimal to allocate all 
resources to the single best available rhizobial strain. Dividing resources among multiple 
strains is always sub-optimal, but different strains may be optimal under different 
conditions. We describe experiments which can test these hypotheses.
4.3 Introduction 
The symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia provides plants of the legume family with 
an alternative source of nitrogen besides root uptake of soil nitrogen. The symbiosis can 
enhance plant growth, as nitrogen is the limiting nutrient in many soils1. But the nitrogen 
from the symbiosis comes at a carbon cost, which may be considerable, as up to 14% of 
newly sequestered carbon is allocated to nodules2. Rhizobial strains vary in how much 
nitrogen they provide (effectiveness)37 and in the carbon cost per gram nitrogen fixed 
(efficiency)2,8,9, both of which may affect plant growth. The effects on plant growth of 
the variability in rhizobial strains has been studied from an evolutionary biology 
perspective1014 and from an applied, agricultural perspective1519. Here we address 
outstanding questions shared by both fields.   
 Evolutionary biologists have studied the legume-rhizobia symbiosis asking how 
the mutualism has persisted over time, and predicted that cheating rhizobial strains are 
likely to arise which increase their fitness by (partially) forgoing nitrogen fixation and 
instead diverting carbon obtained from the plant into storage compounds or the 
reproduction of non-fixing bacteroids10. It was suggested that plants sanction such 
cheating strains by providing fewer resources, thus decreasing their fitness and (as a 
side-effect) preventing their spread through the rhizobial population10. Previous 
modelling has shown that sanctioning could be selected for in plants11 and that this in 
turn leads to the evolution of increased levels of nitrogen fixation in rhizobial strains12. 
Experiments using argon gas13,20,14, and nifH mutant strains which are non-fixing 
(chapter 321) indicated that effectively fixing nodules are larger, and thus received more 
resources, than less effective nodules. But although one study included intermediate rates 
of nitrogen fixation20, it remains unclear how plants would allocate resources among the 
multiple strains they are usually infected with2225. In addition, it is generally assumed 
that cheating strains provide less nitrogen, since part of the carbon obtained from the 
plant is directed into increasing rhizobial fitness rather than into nitrogen fixation. 
However, it has been argued that plants are not usually carbon limited26, so alternatively 
plants may provide more carbon to cheating strains to keep up the rate of nitrogen 
fixation, especially when nitrogen is limiting plant growth. Therefore, another question is 
whether sanctioning is based just on how much nitrogen is provided, or also on carbon 
costs per gram nitrogen fixed.  
 From an agricultural perspective, the varied effects of rhizobial strains on yields 
have led to a search for elite inoculant strains18. Again, the distinction between effective 
and efficient strains is not usually made, as measures such as yield differences confound 
both traits. Although it has been acknowledged that plants may differentially allocate 
resources to nodules and that this may affect yields27, more emphasis has been placed on 
finding strains effective at enhancing yields which are also competitive and form 
sufficient numbers of nodules18. On the other hand, it is well established that plants 
regulate resource allocation to the shoot and different parts of the root in response to 
nutrient availability2834. Carbon and nitrogen are the main constituents of plant tissue 
and their uptake and use are tightly regulated to maximise plant growth32,3542. For 
example, more resources are allocated to root growth when nitrogen is limiting28,31. From 
a plant perspective, sanctioning is just an extension of this regulation of carbon and 
nitrogen uptake. Differential resource allocation to nodules based on how much nitrogen 
they provide and/or how much carbon they cost can only be selected for in plants if it 
enhances plant fitness, irrespective of the effects on rhizobia. Therefore, understanding 
how plants sanction and allocate resources to different strains may help in understanding 
which rhizobial strains positively affect yields and under which conditions. For example, 
soil nitrogen is known to affect resource allocation to nodules8,4346 and if different 
rhizobial strains are affected in different ways, this may inform whether effective 
inoculant strains should be selected under low or high soil nitrogen conditions.  
 Here, we use mathematical modelling to ask how plants should allocate resources 
to roots and nodules in order to maximise plant growth. In particular, we ask (i) how 
resources should be allocated among multiple rhizobial strains, (ii) whether resources 
should be allocated solely on the basis of nitrogen provided, or whether the plant should 
take account of the carbon costs per gram nitrogen fixed and (iii) how soil nitrogen 
affects resource allocation to different rhizobial strains. We use mathematical modelling 
because even though the questions asked are simple, the outcomes are counterintuitive. 
A mathematical model can be used to make quantitative predictions about the nature of 
optimal allocation, and thus generate hypotheses, which can be tested using experiments. 
In contrast to previous models of the symbiosis11,12, we explicitly model plant growth 
and growth of different tissues, so that predictions are in the form of observable 
quantities, such as nodule mass. 
4.4 Methods 
4.4.1 Model description 
4.4.1.1 Basic model: constant soil nitrogen and a single rhizobial strain 
The model describes the growth of a single plant both above and belowground. The 
aboveground tissue fixes carbon, while the belowground tissue is allocated to two pools: 
(1) roots, which take up nitrogen directly from the soil; and (2) nodules, which house 
rhizobia that can fix atmospheric nitrogen. New plant tissue of any kind requires a fixed 
ratio of carbon to nitrogen, so that plant growth is either carbon- or nitrogen-limited47. 
The plant obtains carbon via photosynthesis, and nitrogen via roots and/or rhizobial 
strains. All tissues respire carbon for maintenance, although the model allows this to 
occur at different rates. For example, nodules may have higher carbon demands than 
roots as nitrogen fixation is more energy intensive than direct uptake from the soil 
(estimated averages of 6 g C per gram N5,46 versus 2 g C per g N9,48,49 respectively). We 
use the model to determine the best plant growth strategy by assuming: (i) that 
maximising the instantaneous growth rate will lead to maximum total final plant size; 
and (ii) maximum total final plant size will be selected because larger plants have higher 
fitness (from an evolutionary perspective) and higher yields (from an agricultural 
perspective). For simplicity, flowering is not modelled and nodules are not modelled 
individually. Each rhizobial strain is represented by a single (total) nodule mass.  
 Mathematically, the model is based on a previous model considering plant 
growth and allocation in the absence of rhizobia47. The carbon-limited growth rate () 
at a given point in time depends on the rate of photosynthesis () and the current biomass 
of aboveground tissue () minus the carbon demands of existing shoot (), root 
() and nodules () (Eq. 1a). Thus, carbon demands of existing structures are met 
before resources can be allocated to new growth and the model does not allow for 
senescence and redistribution of resources. The nitrogen-limited growth rate () is 
given by the sum of root nitrogen uptake and nitrogen fixation by nodules. Root nitrogen 
uptake depends on current root biomass (), soil nitrogen concentration (), and 
root uptake rate (), while nitrogen fixation is given by nodule mass () and the 
nitrogen fixation rate (). The terms in the nitrogen-limited growth rate are multiplied 
by the tissue C:N ratio () so that both growth rates are expressed as mg carbon day-1 
(Eq. 1b): 
 () =  ()  ()  ()  () (1a) 
 () =  ()() +  () (1b) 
The actual growth rate achieved is the minimum of the carbon-limited and nitrogen-
limited growth rates (Eq. 1c): 
 () =  min ((), ()) (1c) 
Growth is then distributed over shoot, root and nodules (Eq. 2) (Figure 4-1). A fraction 
() of the total growth is allocated to aboveground biomass (Eq. 2a), and the remainder 
(1  ) to belowground biomass. The growth belowground is split between roots and 
nodules by allocating a fraction () to nodules (Eq. 2c) and the remainder (1  ) to 
roots (Eq. 2b).

= (1  ()) (1  ()) ()

The values of the allocation parameters ( and ) determine how resources are allocated 
to shoots, roots and nodules. Values of allocation parameters leading to maximum 
instantaneous growth rates could be analytically derived and were numerically 
confirmed. 
Figure 4-1. Schematic representation of the mathematical model. The model assumes that 
plant growth is either carbon- or nitrogen-limited and is used to ask how resources should be 
allocated to shoot, root and nodules for optimal growth rates. For simplicity, nodules are not 
modelled individually and each rhizobial strain is represented by a single (total) nodule mass.  
4.4.1.2 Extension with variable soil nitrogen concentration 
The pool of soil nitrogen is unlikely to be a fixed quantity. To test whether allocation to 
rhizobial strains changes when soil nitrogen supply rates change over time (which is 
likely in reality), the model was extended with the option of a dynamic (()) rather 
than a fixed () soil nitrogen concentration. Soil nitrogen concentrations were made 
dynamic by replacing the parameter for the soil nitrogen concentration with an equation 
describing the change in concentration over time as a function of fertilisation (or 
remineralisation) () and root nitrogen uptake, taking into account the volume of soil 
available to the root () (Eq. 3).

4.4.1.3 Extension with multiple rhizobial strains 
In order to see how a plant should allocate resources between two strains which differ 
both in their effectiveness (how much nitrogen they fix) and their efficiency (how much 
carbon they require), we included a second rhizobial strain. This requires adding terms 
and equations to the model, which can indeed be extended to include any number of 
strains using the same methodology. The carbon-limited growth rate is now affected by 
the carbon demands of the two strains (Eq. 4a), while the nitrogen-limited growth rate 
now depends on nitrogen provision by two rhizobial strains (Eq. 4b).  
 () =  ()  ()  ()
 ,,()  ,,() 
 () =  ()() +  ,() +  ,() (4b) 
The actual growth rate achieved remains the smaller of the carbon-limited and nitrogen-
limited growth rates (Eq. 1c). Growth is again allocated to aboveground and 
belowground tissue as determined by the fraction invested in shoot growth (). Growth 
belowground is allocated to the two different strains ( and , with  +   1), and 
the remainder to roots (1     ) (Eq. 5).

4.4.2 Model implementation 
All results are based on analytical solutions for optimal values of allocation parameters  
(allocation to aboveground biomass) and  (allocation to nodules within belowground 
biomass (1  )). Results are therefore not dependent on specific parameter values used 
in the model implementation. The model was implemented with specific parameter 
values to check analytical solutions and to generate graphs. Implementation was in R 
version 3.3.250 and all code is available as supplementary material (Appendix C). 
Parameter values used in this implementation are presented in Table 4-1 and were 
chosen using three sources: (1) those used in Guilbaud et al., 201447, who chose 
parameters suitable for an annual plant with a growth period of 30-200 days, (2) 
experimental conditions used in this work (chapter 5), and (3) reasonable estimates 
sourced from the literature or in relation to already defined parameters. For example, 
although the model allows for any rate of nodule respiration (), it was taken to be a 
linear function of nitrogen fixation with an efficiency () between 2 and 10 mg carbon 
per mg nitrogen fixed2,8,9,51,52.

 The optimal value of allocation to aboveground biomass () was found 
analytically, following the approach used in Guilbaud et al., 201447. By defining the 
growth rate at time  +  and assuming that maximum growth is achieved when carbon 
and nitrogen are equally limiting at all times (() =  () and ( + ) =
 ( + )), it is possible to solve for the optimal value of allocation to aboveground 
biomass () (Box 4-1). Numerical simulations were used to confirm that the analytical 
solution did indeed maximise growth rates, and resulted in a root:shoot ratio of about 0.3 
in the absence of rhizobia, which is comparable with values in the literature for 
soybean55. This value for growth allocation to shoots () was therefore used in all 
subsequent analyses. 
Box 4-1. Derivation of optimal allocation of new growth to aboveground tissue (f) 
The derivation of the optimal allocation of growth to the shoot is based on the 
assumption that optimal growth is achieved when carbon and nitrogen are equally 
limiting, following the approach of Guilbaud et al., 201447: 
 ()             =      () (B1.1a) 
 ( + )  =      ( + ) (B1.1b) 
where growth at time  +  (in the case of a single rhizobial strain) is defined as: 
 ( + ) =  ( + )  ( + )  
 ( + )   ( + ) 
(B1. 2a) 
 ( + ) =  ( + ) +  ( + ) (B1. 2b) 
in which 
 ( + ) =  () + ()() (B1. 3a) 
 ( + ) =  () + (1  ())(1  ())() (B1. 3b) 
 ( + ) =  () + (1  ())()() (B1. 3c) 
Substituting equation B1.3 into equation B1.2 into equation B1.1, cancelling out 
() = () and dividing by () leads to: 
 ()  ()  (1  ()  ()  ()())  ()
+ ()()      = 
(B1. 4) 
 (1  ()  () + ()()) +  ()   ()() 
Rearranging results in an equation for optimal allocation to shoot growth: 
 +   + (   +  (   ))
   +  +   + (   +  (   ))
 (B1. 5) 
Following the same approach for the case of two rhizobial strains leads to: 
 +   + (,   +    ) + (,   +     ) 
   + (,   +    ) + (,   +     )
 (B1. 6) 
 To run the model, initial values for shoot, root and nodule masses had to be 
chosen. To use the analytical solution for optimal allocation to shoot (), carbon and 
nitrogen must also equally limit growth at time  = 0. This was achieved by assuming 
that there are initially no nodules and that the initial allocation to root and shoot mass 
immediately following germination are such that carbon- and nitrogen-limited growth 
rates are equal ( = ) (Box 4-2).  
Box 4-2. Derivation of initial conditions. 
Derivation of the initial shoot and root mass follows the approach of Guilbaud et al., 
201447 and is based on the assumptions that (i) carbon and nitrogen are equally 
limiting growth at time  = 0, (ii) initially there are no nodules, and (iii) the combined 
initial root and shoot mass must equal the seed mass. Therefore, at time  = 0:

4.5 Results 
4.5.1 Allocation to a rhizobial strain depends on its effectiveness and efficiency and on 
plant nitrogen status 
The analytically-derived optimal proportion of belowground growth allocated to nodules 
() (Box 4-3) depends on how much carbon a strain respires relative to how much 
nitrogen it provides, and the carbon and nitrogen uptake rates of the plant itself. Given a 
rate of nitrogen fixation (), there is a threshold value of rhizobial carbon use () 
above which the plant should not invest in the nodule (Eq. 6).  
 Invest in nodules ( = 1) if: 
 <      +    
 +    
The threshold value above which the plant should cease investing in nodules is higher 
when the plant is more strongly nitrogen limited. In other words, strongly nitrogen-
limited plants should still invest in rhizobial strains with high carbon demands, while 
plants which are only weakly nitrogen limited should not invest substantial carbon in 
nitrogen fixation (Figure 4-2). When the rate of nitrogen fixation in nodules is equal to 
the rate of nitrogen uptake by roots ( =  ), the plant should only invest in nodules if 
they respire less carbon than the roots ( < ), which is unlikely. For a given 
rhizobial strain the model thus predicts that the plant should switch between investing all 
belowground growth in nodules when the external nitrogen concentration is low, to 
investing all belowground resources in roots when some critical value of the external 
nitrogen concentration is reached: a plant with both roots and nodules is always sub-
optimal. A plant without roots is viable because the model makes the simplifying 
assumption that the only role of roots is to take up nitrogen, and ignores other root 
functions such as anchorage and uptake of water and other nutrients. 
Figure 4-2. Optimal allocation to nodules is all or nothing and depends on rhizobial nitrogen 
fixation and carbon use, and how nitrogen limited the plant is. Only nitrogen-limited plants 
should invest in strains with high carbon demands.  
 From a rhizobial perspective, the threshold soil nitrogen concentration at which 
the plant would cease to invest in them increases when they are more effective (larger ) 
or more efficient (smaller , with  =    ), which can be seen by rewriting 
Equation 6 as a function of the threshold soil nitrogen concentration (Figure 4-3): 
 Invest in nodules ( = 1) if: 
 ( +    )
( +   )
The relative importance of providing more nitrogen (effectiveness) versus doing so at a 
lower carbon cost (efficiency) depends on net plant carbon fixation rates: The threshold 
value is more strongly affected by efficiency when carbon fixation rates are small, and 
more strongly affected by effectiveness when carbon fixation rates are higher and the 
plant is more nitrogen-limited.  
 Figure 4-3. The threshold concentration of 
soil nitrogen above which plants should 
cease to invest in nodules is higher for 
more effective (larger ) and more 
efficient (smaller ) rhizobial strains. 
Box 4-3. Derivation of optimal allocation to nodules (). 
Optimal allocation to nodules (the value of parameter ) was found by considering the 
carbon-limited () and nitrogen-limited () growth rates at time  + . Growth at 
time  +  (in the case of a single rhizobial strain) is defined as: 
 ( + ) =  ( + )  ( + )  
 ( + )   ( + ) 
(B3. 1a) 
 ( + ) =  ( + ) +  ( + ) (B3. 1b) 
in which 
 ( + ) =  () + ()() (B3. 2a) 
 ( + ) =  () + (1  ())(1  ())() (B3. 2b) 
 ( + ) =  () + (1  ())()() (B3. 2c) 
Both the carbon-limited and the nitrogen-limited growth rates are linear functions of 
how much growth is allocated to the shoot (), but non-linear functions of allocation to 
nodules () (since  is a non-linear function of ). Therefore, if roots and nodules 
provide equal amounts of nitrogen and use equal amounts of carbon per gram tissue 
( =   and  = ), both growth rates are independent of allocation to 
nodules () and a linear function of allocation to the shoot (). The carbon-limited 
growth rate increases as more resources are allocated to the shoot (larger ), while the 
nitrogen-limited growth rate decreases (Figure 4-4a). The maximum growth rate is 
achieved when carbon- and nitrogen-limited growth rates are equal, and this yields the 
optimal value of allocation to the shoot () (Box 4-1).  
 If nodules provide more nitrogen than roots without respiring more carbon, 
increasing allocation to nodules () increases the nitrogen-limited growth rate while 
the carbon-limited growth rate is unaffected. The maximum growth rate is achieved 
when carbon and nitrogen are equally limiting, and is highest when all resources are 
allocated to nodules ( = 1) (Figure 4-4b). Of course, providing more nitrogen than 
roots without respiring more carbon is unlikely. Instead, increasing allocation to 
nodules () increases the nitrogen-limited growth rate, but decreases the carbon-
limited growth rate, as nodules respire more carbon than roots (Figure 4-4c). As long 
as the increase in the nitrogen-limited growth rate increases the overall growth rate 
more than the decrease in the carbon-limited growth rate, optimal allocation remains 
allocating all resources to nodules ( = 1). But there comes a point where the carbon-
limited growth rate is decreased so much by allocating to nodules, that the maximum 
growth rate is achieved by ceasing allocation to nodules ( = 0) (Figure 4-4d). The 
maximum growth rate always occurs at the extreme ends of allocation to nodules ( =
0 or  = 1), so that optimal allocation to nodules is all or nothing. We can express the 
point where plants should switch from allocating to nodules ( = 1) to allocating to 
roots ( = 0) in mathematical terms:  
 Invest in nodules if:  
 ( + )=1 > ( + )=0 (B3. 3) 
(Since the optimal value for allocation to the shoot () is already known, carbon-
limited and nitrogen-limited growth rates are equal ( = ) at all times, so either 
the carbon-limited or the nitrogen-limited growth rate can be considered for further 
derivations.)  
Substituting equation B3.2 into B3.1 into B3.3 gives:  
 Invest in nodules if:  
 (1  =1) >  (1   =0) (B3. 4) 
Substituting for allocation to shoots () (see Box 4-1) and rearranging yields the 
optimal allocation to nodules (): 
 Invest in nodules ( = 1) if:  
 <      +    
 +    
(B3. 5) 
Figure 4-4. Allocation to nodules is always all or nothing. The overall growth rate is 
defined to be the minimum of carbon- and nitrogen-limited growth rates and is highest 
where carbon and nitrogen are equally limiting growth (red dots), at the optimal value of 
allocation to the shoot (). (a) Nodules and roots provide equal amounts of nitrogen ( =
 ) and respire equal amounts of carbon ( = ). The carbon-limited growth rate 
(dashed line) increases as more growth is allocated to the shoot (), while the nitrogen-
limited growth rate (solid line) decreases. Roots and nodules are essentially identical; hence 
growth rates are independent of allocation to nodules (). (b) Nodules provide more 
nitrogen than roots ( >  ) and respire the same amount of carbon ( = ). For 
a given allocation to aboveground biomass (), the nitrogen-limited growth rate is higher if 
more resources are allocated to nodules (larger , darker lines), while the carbon-limited 
growth rate is unaffected. Maximum growth rates for different values of allocation to 
nodules () are indicated by red dots, and the growth rate is highest when all resources are 
allocated to nodules ( = 1). (c) Nodules provide more nitrogen than roots ( >  ) but 
also respire more carbon ( > ). Increased allocation to nodules (larger , darker 
lines) increases the nitrogen-limited growth rate but decreases the carbon-limited growth 
rate. The overall maximum growth rate (red dots) is (just) increased more by the increase in 
the nitrogen-limited growth rate than it is decreased by the decrease in the carbon-limited 
growth rate. Hence, the growth rate is again maximised when all resources are allocated to 
nodules ( = 1). (d) Nodules provide more nitrogen than roots ( >  ) but also respire 
substantially more carbon (  ). The maximum growth rate (red dots) is 
decreased more by the decrease in the carbon-limited growth rate than it is increased by the 
increase in the nitrogen-limited growth rate. The growth rate is highest when no resources 
are allocated to nodules ( = 0). Since the highest growth rates are always at either  = 0 
or at  = 1, optimal allocation to nodules is all or nothing.  
4.5.2 Allocation to a rhizobial strain depends on other strains present on the same plant 
In the case of two or more rhizobial strains, optimal allocation was found to be similarly 
all or nothing, and the plant should allocate to the single  best available  strain (Box 
4-4). If one of the two strains respires too much carbon for the nitrogen it provides (given 
the plant nitrogen status), then obviously resources should be allocated to the strain 
whose carbon demand does not exceed the threshold value (Eq. 6). But even if both 
strains would be a good option and preferred over the root, one of the two will be the 
better option. Strains providing a lot of nitrogen for little carbon (bottom right corner) are 
a better option than strains providing less nitrogen and/or using more carbon (strains 
closer to the threshold line), so that a second threshold line can be drawn for choosing 
between strain A and strain B (Figure 4-5), the slope of which depends on nitrogen 
provision and carbon use of strain A and net plant carbon fixation (Eq. 8).  
 Invest in strain B ( =  0 and  =  1) if: 
, <      +     
, +    
 Consider for example a strain (A) which is both effective and efficient. A second 
strain (B) would only be better if it provides even more nitrogen or does so even more 
efficiently (Figure 4-5), while it might still be preferred over the root even if it less 
effective or efficient than strain A. This means that investment in a rhizobial strain will 
depend on the other strains present on the same plant. A plant might invest in a given 
strain, should it be the only one present, and yet cease to invest in the same strain when a 
better one is available. Since the same argument can be made for comparing a strain C 
with strain A, the prediction is that optimal resource allocation entails investment in a 
single  the best available  rhizobial strain.  
 Which strain is the best available strain depends on conditions, as the relative 
importance of higher nitrogen fixation versus more efficient fixation depends on the 
degree of carbon limitation experienced by the plant (Eq. 8). When net plant carbon 
fixation is low (   is small), the slope of the threshold line is close to the 
efficiency of strain A (  ), so that strain B will be chosen over strain A when it is 
more efficient than strain A. At higher net carbon fixation rates (   is large), the 
slope of the threshold line increases (and the intercept becomes more negative), so that 
strain B will be chosen over strain A when it fixes more nitrogen, even when fixation is 
somewhat less efficient. Because the model assumes a rootless plant is viable, no 
resources are allocated to the root when the plants invests in rhizobia, so that the soil 
nitrogen concentration does not affect the choice between strain A and B.  
 Figure 4-5. Optimal allocation entails 
investing in a single  best available  
rhizobial strain. Given a strain A, the plant 
should only allocate resources to a more 
effective or efficient strain B (dark grey 
area). Therefore, if strain B is preferred 
over the root, but not over strain A (red 
dot), it will be invested in only in the 
absence of strain A. 
Box 4-4. Derivation of optimal allocation to two or more rhizobial strains. 
A plant will only invest in a rhizobial strain if it provides more nitrogen or does so 
more efficiently than the root, and thus meets the condition in Equation 6. If two 
different strains meet this requirement, then the plant could choose to invest in one or 
both (therefore,  +  = 1, so that  = 1  ). Optimal allocation to two 
rhizobial strains (the values of parameter  and ) is found by considering the 
carbon-limited () and nitrogen-limited () growth rates at time  =  . Growth at 
time  =   in the case of two rhizobial strains is defined as: 
 ( + ) =  ( + )  ( + )  
 ( + )   ,,( + )
 ,,( + ) 
(B4. 1a) 
 ( + ) =  ( + ) +  ,( + )
+  ,( + ) 
(B4. 1b) 
in which 
 ( + ) =  () + ()() (B4. 2a) 
 ( + ) =  () + (1  ())(1    )())() (B4. 2b) 
 ,( + ) =  ,() + (1  ())()() (B4. 2c) 
 ,( + ) =  ,() + (1  ())()() (B4. 2d) 
For a given strain (A) with nitrogen fixation rate () and efficiency ( =
 ,  ), the growth rate at time  =   is a non-linear function of the nitrogen 
fixation and respiration rates of strain B, and allocation to strain B (Figure 4-6). When 
strain A and strain B respire equal amounts of carbon per gram nitrogen fixed, overall 
growth rate is highest when allocating all resources to strain A (if strain A fixes more 
nitrogen), or all resources to strain B (when strain B fixes more nitrogen). The overall 
growth rate is independent of resource allocation when the strains provide equal 
amounts of nitrogen (strains are indistinguishable) (Figure 4-6A). If strain B respires 
more carbon per gram nitrogen fixed than strain A, then allocation to strain B only 
results in higher growth rates if strain B provides considerably more nitrogen than 
strain A (Figure 4-6B). If the difference in efficiency of nitrogen fixation becomes too 
large, growth rates remain highest by allocating to strain A, even if strain A provides 
less nitrogen (Figure 4-6C). Again, growth rates are highest at extreme ends of 
allocation, so by either allocating all resources to strain A, or to strain B. Analogously 
to comparing roots with nodules, this yields a criterion to choose between strain A and 
strain B.  
 Invest in strain B if: 
(B4. 3) 
 ( + )=0 & =1 > ( + )=1 & =0  
Substituting equation B4.2 into equation B4.1 into equation B4.3 leads to: 
 Invest in strain B if ( = 0 and  = 1): 
(B4. 4) 
 (1  =0 & =1) >  (1  =1 & =0) 
Substituting for allocation to shoots () (see Box 4-1) and rearranging yields the 
optimal allocation to nodules strain B: 
 Invest in strain B if ( = 0 and  = 1):  
, <      +     
, +    
(B4. 5) 
Optimal allocation means that the plant allocates all resources to either strain A or to 
strain B. If strain B is the better choice, the same argument can be made for comparing 
strain B with strain C. Therefore, given a soil nitrogen concentration, there will always 
be a single rhizobial strain to which all resources should be allocated for maximum 
growth. 
Figure 4-6. Optimal allocation to two rhizobial strains. The dotted vertical line indicates the 
rate of nitrogen fixation of strain A (). All belowground growth is allocated to nodules 
( +  = 1), since a choice between two strains only needs to be made if both strains are 
preferred over the root. (a) If strain A and strain B respire equal amounts of carbon per 
gram nitrogen fixed (, = ,), investing in strain B leads to higher growth rates 
when strain B fixes more nitrogen than strain A (  >  ). (b) If strain B respires more 
carbon than strain A (, > ,), investing in strain B only leads to higher growth 
rates when strain B provides considerably more nitrogen than strain A (    ). (c) If 
strain B respires much more carbon than strain A (,  ,), allocating all 
resources to strain A leads to the highest growth rates, even if strain B provides more 
nitrogen.  
4.6 Discussion 
We developed a model to establish how plants can maximise their growth rate, and thus 
fitness and yield, by differentially allocating resources to roots and to nodules differing 
in how much nitrogen they provide and how much carbon they demand. We found that: 
(i) strongly nitrogen-limited plants should invest in rhizobial strains with high carbon 
demands, while weakly nitrogen-limited plants should not. Thus, a plant should cease to 
invest in a rhizobial strain above a threshold value of soil nitrogen concentration. This 
threshold concentration is higher for both more effective and more efficient strains, and 
the relative importance of the two depends on plant carbon fixation rates; (ii) Optimal 
allocation entails investing in either roots, or a single  best available  rhizobial strain. 
Dividing resources among multiple strains is sub-optimal. Therefore, a strain might 
receive resources when present on its own but not when a better alternative is available 
to the plant. Which strain is the best strain may be different under different conditions as 
plants should invest more carbon in obtaining nitrogen when they have higher carbon 
fixation rates. Model outcomes can be compared to observations. 
 The model predicts all-or-nothing investment in either the root or nodules, so that 
a given rhizobial strain only receives investment up to a threshold soil nitrogen 
concentration, which is lower for less effective or less efficient strains. In reality of 
course roots are always formed, as they are needed for purposes other than nitrogen 
uptake. Nevertheless, the effect of soil nitrogen, especially in the form of nitrate, on both 
the number and size of nodules is well established. At higher soil nitrogen 
concentrations, generally fewer and smaller nodules are formed44,45,56. The effects of 
nitrate have been reported to be strain dependent5658, but it remains unclear whether 
there is a correlation with how much nitrogen strains provide or how efficiently they do 
so. Based on the model predictions, it would be expected that more effective and 
efficient strains are found in higher soil nitrogen environments. Indeed, others have 
suggested that the Inverted Repeat Lacking Clade (IRLC) group of legumes evolved 
increased control over the symbiosis, rendering it more beneficial, because they evolved 
in fertile, formerly glacial, areas59.  
 The model predicts all-or-nothing resource allocation to different strains, so that 
all resources are invested in the single  best available  strain. Effective strains have 
been shown to form larger nodules than ineffective strains13,14,20,27,60,61 (and chapter 321), 
but this observation does not give insight into whether the plant actually invests all 
resources in the single, best available strain. For example, different nodule sizes could 
also arise from the plant allocating resources to strains in proportion to nitrogen received, 
which could be regulated locally. But the all-or-nothing allocation predicted by the 
model, in which resource allocation depends on other strains present on the same plant, 
would require integration of information across the root network and could not arise 
through local regulation alone. There is some evidence that advanced regulatory 
mechanisms to achieve such integration exist. For example, integration is required to 
regulate compensatory root growth in nutrient-rich patches when part of the root system 
is exposed to nutrient poor conditions62. But, even if regulatory mechanisms for optimal 
resource allocation to nodules are feasible, resource allocation may still deviate from our 
model predictions because of other constraints, such as the number of nodules formed by 
different strains. 
 The model prediction of investment in a single strain is not necessarily at odds 
with the observation that legumes tend to be infected by multiple strains2225. Resource 
allocation to multiple strains could arise because the best available strain only forms 
small numbers of nodules, or forms nodules late in the growing season, and cannot meet 
the nitrogen requirements of the plant. Such constraints are not currently included in the 
model. Furthermore, the model might predict investment in multiple strains through 
time, as the best strain to invest in depends on external conditions. In the model, the 
choice between strains is only affected by net carbon fixation rates and not by soil 
nitrogen, since a rootless plant is assumed to be viable and when resources are allocated 
to rhizobia no resources are allocated to the root. In reality, soil nitrogen is likely to 
affect the strength of carbon limitation and thus to affect the choice between strains. It 
remains to be seen how likely carbon limitation is under field conditions and thus 
whether the efficiency of nitrogen fixation plays a role in choosing between strains. It 
seems plausible that carbon fixation could be limited by availability of nutrients other 
than nitrogen and that this in turn may affect resource allocation to nodules. Phosphorus 
deficiency for example has been shown to affect carbon allocation to nodules because 
more carbon was allocated to the root63.  
 The model could be further developed to address some of the outstanding 
questions, for example by including other nutrients (thereby also preventing rootless 
plants) and by more explicitly modelling the nodulation process, so that uneven nodule 
numbers and sequential inoculation could be taken into account. But the model has 
already provided hypotheses, which can be tested in experiments, and guide further 
model development. In particular, the model predicts that: (i) a rhizobial strain with 
reduced nitrogen fixation or increased carbon demands will form large nodules when 
singly inoculated on a nitrogen-limited plant, but small nodules when co-inoculated with 
a more effective or efficient strain, and; (ii) nodules cease to receive resources above a 
certain threshold level of soil nitrogen, and the concentration at which this happens is 
lower for strains providing less nitrogen. These hypotheses can be tested in growth room 
experiments using strains that differ in how much nitrogen they provide and how much 
carbon they demand, but are otherwise similar and thus have equal chances of 
nodulation. Chapter 5 provides tests of these hypotheses.

5 Resource allocation in the legume-rhizobia symbiosis 
In all things of nature there is something of the marvellous.

5.1 Overview 
In this chapter results are presented from experiments conducted to test hypotheses 
generated by modelling the legume-rhizobia symbioses (chapter 4). The results are to be 
published together with the results of chapter 4. Results are discussed briefly, but their 
implications for future research are discussed in chapter 6. Supplementary information 
can be found in Appendix D and contains: (i) supplementary results; (ii) information on 
data; and (iii) R code used to analyse the data. The data that support the findings of this 
study are available in the Oxford Research Archive (ORA-Data) repository, DOI:

5.2 Abstract 
Plants are known to balance carbon and nitrogen uptake by adjusting resource allocation 
to the shoot and root in response to local nitrogen availability. In the case of legumes, 
which form symbioses with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, this balancing act also includes the 
nodules in which rhizobia reside. Rhizobial strains differ in (1) how much nitrogen they 
fix (effectiveness), and (2) the carbon required to do so (efficiency). As both carbon and 
nitrogen are valuable resources to the plant, this variation among strains may affect plant 
growth. We used a plant growth model to generate predictions about optimal resource 
allocation to different rhizobial strains which we test here. 
 We used derivatives of rhizobial strain Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae 
Rlv3841 which differed in either the rate of nitrogen fixation, or the carbon cost (per 
gram nitrogen fixed), but were otherwise similar. We inoculated plants with different 
combinations of those strains to test whether resource allocation to less effective or 
efficient strains (that provide less nitrogen or require more carbon) depends on whether 
or not a better, alternative strain is available. We also assessed whether the effect of soil 
nitrogen on resource allocation to nodules depends on how much nitrogen strains 
provide.  
 We found that plants preferentially allocated resources to the most effective 
strain. An intermediate-fixing strain received fewer resources when co-inoculated with a 
more effective strain than when co-inoculated with a non-fixing strain, in line with 
model predictions. In contrast, plants did not preferentially allocate resources to more 
efficient strains. Resource allocation to a strain with increased carbon costs per gram 
nitrogen fixed did not depend on whether or not a more efficient strain was available. 
Increasing soil nitrogen concentrations lead to reduced investment in nodules. For 
effective strains this was mostly due to a reduction in nodule size; for less effective 
strains, this was mostly due to a reduction in nodule number. Our results indicate that pea 
plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to compare nitrogen provision from 
different nodules, integrate information, and adjust resource allocation accordingly. 
5.3 Introduction 
Carbon and nitrogen are the main constituents of plant tissue. To maximise growth rates, 
plants have evolved mechanisms to tightly control uptake of carbon and nitrogen, 
adjusting resource allocation to the shoot and different parts of the root in response to 
local nutrient availability15. Legumes can also obtain nitrogen through a symbiosis with 
nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, in exchange for carbon6. Rhizobial strains vary in how much 
nitrogen they provide711 (effectiveness) and how much carbon they require per gram 
nitrogen fixed1214 (efficiency), both of which may affect plant growth and therefore 
fitness and yield. Plants may withold resources from strains that provide little nitrogen, 
which is called sanctioning if it also reduces rhizobial fitness1519. Persuasive evidence 
for sanctioning has been provided in the case of fixing and non-fixing strains1921. 
However, it is less clear: (i) how resources would be allocated among multiple rhizobial 
strains with different effectiveness; (ii) whether the efficiency of rhizobial strains also 
affect plant resource allocation; and (iii) how soil nitrogen affects resource allocation to 
strains of different effectiveness. Here, we conducted experiments to test predictions 
about resource allocation from a theoretical model (chapter 4).  
 Through mathematical modelling, predictions were made about the nature of 
optimal resource allocation (chapter 4). The model predicts that plants should invest all 
resources in the single, best available strain, rather than provide resources to multiple 
strains (for example, in proportion to the nitrogen they provide). The best available strain 
is more effective or more efficient, and the relative importance of these two 
characteristics depends on the extent of carbon-limitation in the plant. The model also 
predicts that plants cease to invest in rhizobial strains above a threshold soil nitrogen 
concentration, which is higher for more effective strains. However, allocation of 
resources may deviate from model predictions, for example, if plants lack the required 
regulatory mechanisms or if not all aspects are under plant control. Establishing how 
plants actually allocate resources therefore requires experiments, which have so far not 
been easy to design so that hypotheses about resource allocation can be properly tested. 
 Split-root experiments have been instrumental in studying resource allocation to 
roots in response to local nutrient availability5, and have also been used with nodulated 
roots2225. However, it is not technically feasible to create more than two or maybe three 
different compartments, making it difficult to study allocation to the multiple rhizobial 
strains that infect a typical legumes individual2629. It is also problematic to discriminate 
between resource allocation to a part of the root which receives more nitrogen and 
resource allocation to specific nodules which provide more nitrogen, as nodules 
containing different strains may sit very close to each other on normal (non-split) roots 
(see chapter 321). 
 Another difficulty is the natural variation in both how much nitrogen strains 
provide711 and how much carbon they use1214. Investment to rhizobial strains is 
predicted to depend on both (chapter 4), but to understand the effect of these two 
different aspects of rhizobial behaviour on resource allocation requires strains that vary 
in one aspect but not the other. This is near impossible to achieve with naturally 
occurring strains. To overcome this problem, previous studies have used argon gas to 
manipulate the amount of atmospheric nitrogen available to rhizobia19,20,24,25,30, and 
therefore their rate of nitrogen fixation. However, this requires the use of either split-root 
experiments19,20,24,25, or encasing nodules in a chamber20,30, which can only be done at a 
late stage of nodule development, thereby missing the earlier stages of resource 
allocation.  
 Here, we use a set of mutant strains derived from Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. 
viciae (Rlv) strain 384131 to experimentally manipulate either effectiveness or efficiency 
in strains that are otherwise similar. Insertion of spectinomycin resistance genes led to 
non-fixing mutant strains (chapter 321), and also a strain fixing nitrogen at intermediate 
rates32. The gusA and celB marker gene system was used to discriminate between strains 
post-harvest (chapter 321). To manipulate carbon use, we made use of the lux reporter 
gene system which is widely used to study gene expression. The set of genes causes 
bacteria to emit light, and is normally placed under the control of a specific promoter, so 
that the amount of light emitted reports on the levels of gene expression33. We used the 
system to increase the amount of carbon used per nitrogen fixed, by putting lux genes 
under control of the nifH gene promoter, essential for nitrogen fixation. Each photon of 
light produced requires 20 molecules of ATP, so a considerable energetic burden is 
placed on strains expressing the lux genes34,35. Thus, we increased carbon usage during 
nitrogen fixation without interfering with other aspects of rhizobial function, for 
example, in root colonisation success.  
 The rhizobial strains varying in how much nitrogen they provide and how much 
carbon they require were used to test model predictions about plant resource allocation. 
Specifically, we tested whether: (i) in nitrogen-limited environments plants will allocate 
resources to strains that provide less nitrogen or demand more carbon, if such a strain is 
the only option, but will sanction the same strain if a better alternative is present, and (ii) 
resource allocation to a given strain drops rapidly above a critical level of soil nitrogen, 
and the concentration at which this happens is lower for strains providing little nitrogen. 
5.4 Results 
Results are presented based on measuring nodule size (area) of the ten most-developed 
(largest) nodules, so that variation in size due to developmental stage was accounted for, 
but similar results were obtained based on randomly selecting ten nodules (Appendix D, 
supplementary material). 
5.4.1 Characterisation of intermediate-fixing strain LMB827 
To study resource allocation to strains that differ in nitrogen provision, we made use of 
non-fixing (OPS0365 and OPS0366 (Fix), chapter 321) and intermediate-fixing 
(LMB827 (FixInt)32) derivatives of strain Rlv3841 (Fix+)31. The intermediate-fixing strain 
is not fully characterised genetically, but contains a duplication of fixC, the first copy of 
which is disrupted with the omega spectinomycin cassette (Spc). The strain has the 
following genetic structure; fixABCfixCSpc, followed by fixCX, nifA, nifB. As Spc is 
highly polar, it prevents auto-upregulation of nifA from the nifA promoter in front of 
fixA, restricting its expression to the basal constitutive promoter in fixC32. It therefore 
fixes nitrogen at reduced rates as compared to Rlv3841 (2.5  0.2 versus 3.6  0.2 mol 
ethylene plant-1 hour-1 respectively at 28 days post inoculation)32. Nodules of the 
intermediate-fixing strain are pink, but slightly paler than fixing nodules (Figure 5-1). In 
single inoculations (single root or split-root with the same strain on each half-root), the 
intermediate-fixing strain formed intermediate-sized nodules. Intermediate-fixing 
nodules were 2.66 mm2 (95% CI [2.21, 3.11]), which is 0.80 mm2 (95% CI [0.17, 1.43]) 
larger than non-fixing nodules and 0.49 mm2 (95% CI [0.08, 0.90]) smaller than fixing 
nodules (Figure 5-2).

nodules. Symbols indicate data from

5.4.2 Resource allocation to an intermediate-fixing strain depends on whether or not a 
more effective strain is available to the plant.  
To test whether plants allocate resources to the single  best available  rhizobial strain 
based on nitrogen fixation rates, we co-inoculated plants with different combinations of a 
fixing strain (Rlv3841 gusA36; Fix+), a non-fixing nifH mutant strain (OPS0365 or 
OPS0366 (chapter 321); Fix) and a strain fixing nitrogen at intermediate rates 
(LMB82732; FixInt). The fixing and non-fixing strain were gusA or celB marked so that 
after a post-harvest staining procedure it was easy to visually determine which nodule 
contained which strain (Figure 5-3 and Figure 5-6).  
Figure 5-3. Resource allocation to an intermediate-fixing strain depends on which other strain 
is present on the plant. Pea root sections (2x2 cm) of roots inoculated with different 
combinations of a non-fixing strain (Fix, OPS0365), an intermediate-fixing strain (FixInt, 
LMB827) and a fixing strain (Fix+, Rlv3841 gusA). (a) Unmarked FixInt strain co-inoculated 
with gusA marked (blue) Fix strain. (b) Unmarked FixInt strain singly inoculated. (c) 
Unmarked FixInt strain co-inoculated with gusA marked (blue) Fix+ strain. Plants were grown 
for 28 days without external nitrogen. 
 In two independent experiments, the intermediate-fixing strain was co-inoculated 
with the non-fixing strain (OPS0365), the fixing strain (Rlv3841 gusA), or itself (single 
inoculation) (Figure 5-3). Nodule size of the intermediate-fixing strain depended on 
which other strain was present on the plant (F2, 26 = 53.2537, p < 0.0001) (Figure 5-4). 
Nodules formed by the intermediate-fixing strain measured 2.80 mm2 (95% CI [2.50, 
3.10]) when singly inoculated, and were of similar size when co-inoculated with the non-
fixing strain (a non-significant difference of 0.06 mm2, 95% CI [-0.30, 0.42]). However, 
in the presence of the fixing strain, nodules of the intermediate-fixing strain were less 
than half this size (a significant difference of 1.54 mm2, 95% CI [1.18, 1.90]). For 
comparison, the nodule sizes of the non-fixing and the fixing strains, as measured on the 
same plants, are shown in Figure 5-5. In the presence of the fixing strain, nodules of the 
intermediate-fixing strain became as small as non-fixing nodules (t18 = 0.60612, p = 
0.552). Thus, the difference in size between the intermediate-fixing strain and the fixing 
strain was larger when both strains were co-inoculated than in single inoculations 
(significant interaction between strain and type of inoculation (singly or co-inoculated), 
F1, 36 = 17.36887, p = 0.0002). The intermediate-fixing strain typically formed about 
50% of the total nodules on the plant (46  13% (mean  s.e.)), independent of whether 
the competing strain was fixing or non-fixing (F1, 8 = 3.3892, p = 0.1029), indicating that 
it was equally effective at colonising the roots and forming nodules.

the same plants, is indicated as an orange 
triangle for reference. Points represent an 
average based on measuring ten nodules. 
Symbols indicate data from independent

days without external nitrogen. 
 These results were repeated in an experiment in which all three strains were co-
inoculated in equal ratios, the non-fixing strain now being celB marked strain OPS0366 
(chapter 321) (Figure 5-6). Again, the non-fixing strain and the intermediate-fixing 
strain formed equally small nodules (a non-significant difference of 0.19 mm2, 95% CI [-
0.15, 0.53]), while the fixing strain formed significantly larger nodules (a difference of 
2.92 mm2, 95% CI [2.58, 3.26]), as compared to the non-fixing strain) (Figure 5-7). 
These results indicate that plants allocate resources preferentially to the strain that fixes 
the most nitrogen, and fewer resources to other strains present on the plant. As a result, 
resource allocation to an intermediate-fixing strain depends on whether or not a better 
fixing strain is available to the plant.

are more than twice as large. Each point 
represents the average of ten nodules. 
Plants were grown for 29 days without 
external nitrogen. 
5.4.3 Reduced resource allocation results in reduced nitrogen fixation rates of the 
intermediate-fixing strain 
To test whether the reduced resource allocation to the intermediate-fixing strain by the 
plant also resulted in reduced nitrogen fixation, a split-root experiment was performed. 
Again, plants were co-inoculated with different combinations of a fixing strain (Rlv3841 
gusA36), a non-fixing nifH mutant strain (OPS0365, chapter 321) and a strain fixing 
nitrogen at intermediate rates (LMB82732). The split-root design allowed us to measure 
acetylene reduction rates of the focal strain on one half-root, given the presence of 
another strain on the second half-root. Using the split-root system, we again observed 
that the intermediate-fixing strain formed smaller nodules when co-inoculated with the 
fixing strain than when co-inoculated with the non-fixing strain (Figure 5-8), although 
this difference was not quite significant (a difference of 0.71 mm2, 95% CI [-0.04, 1.46], 
t11 = -2.069, p = 0.0628). The reduction in nodule size was associated with a reduction in 
the rate of nitrogen fixation. Half-roots with the intermediate-fixing strain reduced 
acetylene at a rate of 0.99 mol hour-1, 95% CI [0.57, 1.40] when co-inoculated with the 
non-fixing strain, but this rate was reduced by 0.65 mol hour-1, 95% CI [0.02, 1.27] in 
the presence of the fixing strain (t7 = -2.435, p = 0.04512)  a significant reduction of 
66%. Nitrogen fixation rates were positively correlated with nodule size (t10 = 2.714, p = 
0.0218). For every mm2 increase in average nodule size of the most developed nodules, 
half-roots reduced 0.91 mol hour-1, 95% CI [0.16, 1.67] more acetylene. (Figure 5-9). 
This suggests that nodule size is a good proxy for nitrogen fixation rates.

shoots) of plants grown for 28 days 
without external nitrogen. 
5.4.4 Soil nitrate availability affects resource allocation to nodules in a strain-dependent 
manner 
To test whether the effect of soil nitrate on nodule size and number depends on how 
much nitrogen each strain provides, plants were inoculated with a fixing strain (Rlv3841 
gusA36), an intermediate-fixing strain (LMB82732) or a non-fixing strain (OPS0365, 
chapter 321) at a range of external nitrate concentrations. Nodules of all strains decreased 
in size as soil nitrate availability increased (F1,79 = 106.20611, p < 0.001) (Figure 5-10). 
The interaction between soil nitrate concentration and rhizobial strain was not quite 
significant (F2, 79 = 2.59777, p = 0.0808), but the effect was most pronounced for the 
fixing strain (a steeper slope as compared to the non-fixing strain, a difference of -2.25 
mm2 / g KNO3, 95% CI [-4.95, 0.46]). Nodules of the fixing strain were largest at zero 
soil nitrogen (1.43 mm2, 95% CI [1.05, 1.81] larger than non-fixing nodules), but similar 
in size to the less effective strains at higher soil nitrogen concentrations (Figure 5-10). 
 The number of nodules also decreased with increasing soil nitrate concentrations 
(F1,79 = 129.7125, p < 0.001) (Figure 5-11). This effect depended on rhizobial strain 
(strain x nitrate interaction, F2,79 = 7.4144, p = 0.0011) and was least pronounced for the 
fixing strain (a less steep slope as compared to the non-fixing strain, a difference of 378 
nodules / g KNO3, 95% CI [145, 611]). The fixing strain formed the smallest number of 
nodules at zero soil nitrogen (96 fewer nodules, 95% CI [63, 129]), but all strains formed 
similar numbers of nodules at higher soil nitrogen concentrations (Figure 5-11).

function of soil nitrate availability for all 
strains. The effect is most pronounced for 
the fixing strain (black circles), which at 
zero nitrogen forms the largest nodules, 
while at high nitrate concentrations all 
nodules are similar in size. Nodule size for 
each plant was based on the average of ten 
nodules. Points represent mean  s.e. of 3-
6 replicate plants grown for 27-29 days.

5.4.5 Resource allocation to a strain with increased carbon costs does not depend on 
whether or not a more efficient strain is available to the plant.  
To test whether plants sanction less efficient strains, we compared resource allocation to 
a strain with increased carbon demands (LMB553; Lux+, which emits light when fixing 
nitrogen due to lux genes under control of nifH promoter) and the reference strain 
(LMB542; Lux, with lux plasmid but no promoter) in both single and co-inoculations. 
We found that the Lux+ strain formed slightly smaller nodules than the Lux strain in 
both single inoculations (a non-signifianct difference of 0.69 mm2, 95% CI [-0.12, 1.50], 
t12 = 1.8584, p = 0.08781) and in co-inoculations (a significant difference of 0.80 mm
95% CI [0.32, 1.29], t10 = 3.6922, p = 0.004162) (Figure 5-12). Both strains were 
slightly smaller in co-inoculation than in single inoculations (a difference of 0.687 mm2, 
95% CI [0.06, 1.32]), which is possibly an artefact of measuring the twenty largest 
nodules in co-inoculation and only the ten largest nodules in single inoculation. 
However, the difference in size between the Lux+ and Lux strains was similar whether 
the strains were present on their own or co-inoculated (no significant interaction between 
strain and inoculation type (singly or co-inoculated), F1,32 = 0.0678, p = 0.796216). Thus, 
although nodules respiring more carbon are smaller, there is no indication that plants 
preferentially allocated resources to strains requiring less carbon, when given the choice. 
In fact, Lux+ nodules were found to be very well developed in co-inoculated plants 
(Figure 5-13).  
Figure 5-12. Nodule sizes of strains with increased carbon costs per gram nitrogen fixed 
(Lux+; LMB553) as compared to the control strain (Lux; LMB542). The carbon-costly Lux+ 
strain formed slightly smaller nodules than the Lux strain, but the difference was independent 
of whether strains were singly or co-inoculated. Therefore, there is no indication that plants 
preferentially allocated resources to a more efficient strain, given the choice. Plants were 
grown for 29 days without external nitrogen. 
Figure 5-13. Root sections (2x2 cm) of pea roots co-inoculated with strains carrying the lux 
plasmid under the nifH promoter (Lux+; LMB553), which is emitting light when fixing 
nitrogen, and a strain carrying the lux plasmid without a promoter (Lux; LMB542), which 
does not emit light. (A) The NightOwl image (Berthold Technologies) shows which nodules 
are emitting light (1000-10000 cps). (B) Standard photography image in which nodules found 
to emit light are indicated with arrows. Nodules emitting light appeared to be as well 
developeded as nodules not emitting light. Therefore, there is no indication that plants 
sanctioned nodules which used more carbon per gram nitrogen fixed.  
5.5 Discussion 
We used otherwise similar strains differing in both their effectiveness and their 
efficiency to investigate: (i) how plants allocate resources among multiple strains; (ii) 
whether allocation to rhizobia is based only on nitrogen provided, or also on carbon 
required; and (iii) how allocation to different strains is affected by external soil nitrogen. 
Mathematical modelling predicted that optimal resource allocation entails investing in 
the single  best available  strain, and that both effectiveness and efficiency may 
determine which strain is best. The model also predicted a sharp decrease in resource 
allocation to nodules above a threshold soil nitrogen concentration, which is lower for 
less effective strains (chapter 4). Model predictions were partially upheld. We found 
that plants preferentially allocated resources to more effective strains, so that a strain 
fixing nitrogen at reduced rates formed smaller nodules when co-inoculated with a fixing 
strain than when co-inoculated with itself or with a non-fixing strain. In contrast, nodule 
size of a strain with increased carbon demands was not affected by the presence of a 
more efficient strain. Increasing soil nitrogen concentrations reduced mostly nodule size 
of the effectively fixing strain, and mostly nodule numbers of less effective strains. At 
high external nitrogen concentrations, all strains formed similar numbers of nodules of 
similar sizes.  
 Our results indicate that plants preferentially invest in the most effective strain, at 
the expense of a less effective strain, when both are present. This result is in line with 
model predictions, but is likely to be contingent on numbers of nodules formed. The 
reduction in nodule size of the intermediate-fixing strain was associated with a reduction 
in nitrogen-fixation rates of those nodules, so that nitrogen fixation potential was lost. 
Investing in a better strain makes sense if such a strain is present, but if only very few 
nodules are occupied by the more effective strain, it is possible that more resources will 
be allocated to the intermediate-fixing strain. The reduction in nodule size may not be so 
dramatic when nodule numbers are unequal, as was the case in our experiment. Further 
modelling taking into account numbers of nodules formed, and experiments with a range 
of ratios of the different strains, can help to elucidate how important nodule numbers are. 
An early study37 indicates that biases in nodule numbers may have smaller effects than 
expected. Effectively fixing nodules increased in nodule size as they decreased in nodule 
number, so that nitrogen fixation potential did not linearly decrease with the number of 
effectively fixing nodules formed37.  
 Plants did not discriminate among strains differing in efficiency, contrary to 
model predictions. Nodules of the less efficient strain were slightly smaller than the 
reference strain, but the difference in size was independent of whether the more efficient 
strain was co-inoculated or not. There is therefore no indication that plants discriminated 
between the two strains and supplied fewer resources to the less efficient strain. We 
cannot exclude the possibility that the strain fixed less nitrogen, so that total carbon 
demands did not increase much. However, carbon demands per gram nitrogen fixed were 
increased, and the plant did not discriminate on this basis. One possibility is that the 
difference in efficiency was too small to be relevant. Light emission is energy-
intensive34,35, but so is nitrogen fixation38, so the relative increase may have been small. 
However, the difference in nodule size indicates that there was indeed a difference 
between strains, and the model predicts any difference to be relevant. Nonetheless, it 
could be that only more strongly carbon-limited plants discriminate among strains based 
on efficiency. Alternatively, pea plants lack the required sensory mechanisms to detect 
how much carbon different nodules use and discriminate between strains based on 
nitrogen provision, but supply carbon as needed for respiration. To see whether 
discrimination based on efficiency is possible, it would be worthwhile repeating the 
experiment using even less efficient strains (possibly using another system than the lux 
genes), or in more carbon-limited plants, for example by providing nitrogen and shading 
leaves. 
 Strains differing in how effectively they provide nitrogen were affected by soil 
nitrogen in different ways, but we did not observe the predicted sharp decrease in 
resource allocation beyond a strain-dependent threshold nitrogen concentration. 
Differences in responses between strains may be better observed in a more sophisticated 
flow-through system in which external nitrogen concentrations are kept constant over the 
growing season. But if differences are small they may also be of little relevance in the 
field. The differential effects on nodule number and size may be more relevant, if 
unsurprising. It is well established that soil nitrogen affects nodule number and size3941, 
that plants with larger nodules tend to have fewer nodules40, and that the number of 
nodules formed is subject to a process called autoregulation, which is known to overlap 
with nitrate signalling42. The relevance lies in the fact that the stronger effect on nodule 
size of the more effective strain meant that at high soil nitrogen concentrations all 
nodules were of similar size. Therefore, growing plants under conditions of high external 
nitrogen may lead to less effective discrimination between strains. Indeed, others have 
found that breeding plants in highly fertile environments has led to newer soybean 
varieties being less effective at discriminating between strains43. 
 In contrast to earlier studies on sanctioning and resource allocation to nodules, 
our results cannot be explained by resource allocation proportional to nitrogen received. 
Earlier studies on sanctioning compared a more and a less effective strain, and the 
observed smaller nodule sizes of the less effective strain could be explained by local 
regulation based on nitrogen fixation rates. One other study included multiple rates of 
nitrogen fixation, and found that intermediate-fixing nodules received intermediate 
amounts of resources30. However, only a small number of nodules could be exposed to 
treatments for a short period of time, given the limitations of using argon gas, making 
interpretation difficult. The regulation of nodule number and size in response to soil 
nitrogen requires systemic regulation based on plant nitrogen status, for which pathways 
are being elucidated42,44,45, but resource allocation to individual nodules may still be 
proportional to nitrogen received and locally regulated. In contrast, our finding that pea 
plants preferentially allocated resource to the single  best available  strain, means that 
plants must regulate resource allocation in a more complex way. Co-inoculated plants 
must have been able to compare nitrogen fixation rates of multiple nodules, and adjust 
resource allocation accordingly, indicating the ability to integrate information in a more 
sophisticated way than previously established. This finding raises questions about how 
differential resource allocation might be regulated mechanistically, how it affects 
rhizobial populations in the soil, and how widespread these sophisticated mechanisms 
may be in the legume family. 
5.6 Methods 
5.6.1 Bacterial strains and culture conditions 
We made use of derivatives of R. leguminosarum bv. viciae (Rlv) strain 384131, which 
differ in how much nitrogen they provide or how much carbon they use per gram 
nitrogen fixed. For strains differing in how much nitrogen they provide, we used a gusA 
marked fixing strain (Rlv3841 gusA36), and gusA or celB marked non-fixing strains 
(OPS0365 and OPS0366 respectively), which are completely ineffective at fixing 
nitrogen due to insertion of a spectinomycin resistance cassette in the nifH gene which is 
essential for nitrogen fixation (chapter 321). As an intermediate-fixing strain, we used 
LMB827 which fixed nitrogen at reduced rates due to a complex insertion of the 
spectinomycin resistance gene32. For strains differing in how much carbon they cost per 
gram nitrogen fixed, we used strains carrying a plasmid with lux genes either without a 
promoter (LMB54246, not emitting light), or under the nifH promoter (LMB553 (Poole 
lab,47, emitting light when fixing nitrogen). Strains were stocked at -80C in 15-20% 
glycerol, and otherwise maintained on TY agar48 medium at 28C, supplemented with 
500 g ml-1 streptomycin (all strains) and 100 g ml-1 spectinomycin (OPS0365, 
OPS0366 and LMB827 only) or 5 g ml-1 tetracycline (LMB542 and LMB553 only). 
Further details on all strains can be found in Table 2-1 (chapter 2).  
5.6.2 Plant growth 
Pea (Pisum sativum cv Avola) were surface sterilised (immersed first in 95% ethanol for 
30 s and then in 2% sodium hypochlorite for 5-6 min, rinsed with distilled water) and left 
to germinate on 0.8% distilled water agar plates in the dark at room temperature. For 
single root experiments, peas were planted after five days by transferring them to 
sterilised 500 ml Azlon beakers filled with a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of sand and fine 
vermiculite, to which 75 ml sterilised nutrient solution (as in Poole et al., 199449, but 
2.67 times more concentrated, nitrogen-free unless otherwise stated) and 1 ml of the 
appropriate rhizobial inoculum (or water as control) was added at planting. For the split-
root experiment, the last few millimetres of the emerging radicle were cut off after three 
days to induce lateral root formation50, and seedlings were left to grow on agar for a 
further ten days. At planting, two Azlon beakers were prepared as described for the 
single roots and taped together, after which the root system was equally divided over 
both beakers, with the pea seed being kept in place with cling-film on the rim of the two 
beakers. In all experiments, beakers were covered with cling-film, which was slit a few 
days after planting to allow the seedling to grow. Plants were grown in the growth room 
(21C, 16 hour photoperiod) for four weeks after planting, and watered with distilled 
water as necessary from two weeks onwards.  
5.6.3 Experimental designs 
To test how plants allocate resources among strains differing in how much nitrogen they 
provide, intermediate-fixing strain LMB827 was competed against non-fixing strain 
OPS0365, itself, or fixing strain Rlv3841 gusA by inoculating plants with 1:1 mixtures of 
the strains at a total density of 1 x 102 cells pot-1. Two independent experiments were 
conducted, with each experiment consisting of five replicate plants per treatment plus 
two water controls grown in a fully randomised design. Resource allocation among three 
strains was tested by inoculating plants with a 1:1:1 mixture of the fixing strain (Rlv3841 
gusA), the intermediate-fixing strain (LMB827), and non-fixing strain OPS0366, at a 
total density of 1 x 102 cells pot-1. Eight plants and two water controls were grown in a 
fully randomised design.  
 To study how resource allocation among strains affects acetylene reduction rates, 
both intermediate-fixing strain LMB827 and fixing strain Rlv3841 gusA were competed 
against non-fixing strain OPS0365, intermediate-fixing strain LMB827 and fixing strain 
Rlv3841 gusA in a split-root design. Control plants had the non-fixing strain on one half-
root and water control on the second half-root. Rhizobial inocula were always 1 x 102 
cells half-root-1. Five plants per treatment were grown in a fully randomised design.  
 To study the effect of soil nitrogen availability on strains differing in nitrogen 
fixation, plants were grown with each of the strains (non-fixing OPS0365, intermediate-
fixing LMB827 and fixing Rlv3841 gusA) separately (density of 1 x 102 cells pot-1), at a 
range of nitrogen concentrations. Potassium nitrate (KNO3) was added to the nitrogen-
free nutrient solution, resulting in 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 and 0.3 g KNO3 added plant
Three plants per treatment plus water controls were grown in a fully randomised design. 
The experiment was repeated independently, but with only 84% of the original nutrient 
solution. The difference in nitrogen concentration is accounted for in the analysis, while 
other nutrients are so much in abundance that results are unlikely to be affected.  
 To test whether resource allocation to nodules depends on carbon costs per gram 
nitrogen fixed, plants were grown with a strain with increased carbon costs per gram 
nitrogen fixed due to lux genes under control of the nifH promoter (LMB553), an 
otherwise isogenic strain lacking the promoter (thus never emitting light, LMB542), or 
both strains co-inoculated (density of 1 x 102 cells pot-1 in all cases). In a completely 
randomised design, we grew seven replicates for each of the single inoculations, twelve 
replicates for the co-inoculation treatment, and two water control plants.  
5.6.4 Harvest 
At harvest, plants were gently removed from the pots and shaken to remove any clinging 
substrate. For acetylene reductions, the half-root with the competing strain was removed 
and the half-root with the focal strain (with shoot attached) was transferred to 250 ml 
Duran bottles with airtight neoprene lids. Bottles contained a bit of wet tissue paper to 
prevent drying of the samples. Acetylene was added with a syringe through the lid to a 
final concentration of 2%. After one hour incubation at room temperature, three samples 
were taken from the jar and analysed for acetylene and ethylene by gas chromatography 
(Clarus 480, Perkin-Elmer).  
 For GusA and CelB staining36,51, roots were gently washed with water, and 
submerged in 40 ml phosphate buffer (7 g L-1 NaH2PO4, 7.2 g L
-1 Na2HPO4, 1 mM 
EDTA (pH 8), 1% Sarkosyl, 1 ml L-1 Triton) in Falcon tubes covered with aluminium 
foil. For GusA staining, Magenta-glc (5-bromo-6-chloro-3-indolyl--D-glucuronide) was 
added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg ml-1 and roots were incubated overnight at 28C. 
If additional CelB staining was necessary, roots were then transferred to fresh preheated 
phosphate buffer and incubated for  2 hours at 70C to destroy endogenous -
galactosidase activity, after which X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl--D-galactoside) 
was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mg ml-1 and roots were incubated overnight at 
37C.  
 To manipulate the amount of carbon used for nitrogen fixation, we used a strain 
with lux genes under the control of the nifH promoter (LMB55347), and a reference strain 
with the lux plasmid but no promoter (LMB542, Poole lab,46). The lux genes encode the 
luciferase enzyme which converts energy-rich compounds into light52,53, which can be 
detected using sensitive charge coupled device cameras54. To detect whether nodules 
were emitting light, roots were carefully laid out on 120 x 120 mm2 plates and imaged 
with a NightOwl II camera (Berthold Technologies) at an exposure time of 120 seconds 
using inbuilt IndiGO software v2.0.5.0.  
 After any treatment, roots were gently washed, carefully laid out on 120 x 120 
mm2 plates so that all nodules were visible, and photographed for further data collection.  
5.6.5 Data collection 
From the photographs taken of the root systems, the number of nodules formed by each 
strain was counted. Nodule size per plant and per strain was estimated by measuring the 
area of the ten most developed (largest) nodules, so that variation in size due to 
developmental stage was accounted for. Using the software ImageJ55 v1.49v, areas of 
irregular shapes could be accurately measured. Strains were discriminated (if necessary) 
based on GusA or CelB staining, or based on light emission, in which case the NightOwl 
images were used to indicate which nodules were emitting light. Nodule sizes were 
measured from the standard photography images in all cases for consistency.  
5.6.6 Statistical analyses 
For all experiments, a single data point per plant and per strain was obtained by 
averaging the nodule area measurements of the ten most developed (largest) nodules. 
Nodule sizes of strains when only one strain was present on the plant were analysed in a 
mixed effect model with experiment as random effect. Nodule sizes of the intermediate-
fixing strain were analysed as a function of the competing strain in a mixed effect model 
including experiment as a random effect. To compare the size of non-fixing nodules with 
nodules of the intermediate-fixing strain in the presence of the fixing strain, a two-sided 
t-test assuming equal variances was performed. To confirm that the difference in nodule 
size between the intermediate-fixing strain and the fixing strain depended on whether 
they were co-inoculated or not, a mixed-effect model was fitted with nodule size as 
function of strain (FixInt or Fix+), inoculation (single or co-inoculation) and the 
interaction, with experiment as random effect. The percentage of nodules formed by the 
intermediate-fixing strain was analysed as a function of competing strain (Fix or Fix+), 
with experiment as random effect. The triple inoculation experiment was analysed as a 
mixed-effects model, including plant as random effect, to account for the fact that on 
each plant nodule sizes of all three strains were measured.  
 The results of the split-root experiment were analysed in linear models, 
modelling either nodule area or ethylene produced half-root-1 hour-1 (average of three 
technical replicates) of the intermediate-fixing strain as function of the competing strain. 
The acetylene reduction rates per half-root of the intermediate-fixing strain were 
regressed against average nodule size in a linear model.  
 The effects of soil nitrate availability on nodule sizes and numbers of different 
strains were analysed in a mixed-effect models, modelling nodule area or number of 
nodules as a function of both strain and nitrate concentration (ANCOVA), including the 
interaction, and accounting for experiment as a random effect.  
 To test for the differences in resource allocation to strains with increased carbon 
costs per gram nitrogen fixed, we used a linear model in which we analysed nodule area 
as a function of strain (Lux and Lux+), including the interaction with treatment applied 
(single or co-inoculation). To obtain 95% confidence intervals of the differences in size 
between the two strains, we did a two-sided t-test (single inoculations) and a paired t-test 
(co-inoculation).

6.1 Overview 
This chapter gives an overview of the results (6.2) and discusses them in a more general 
context than was done in each chapter. Implications of the findings and avenues for 
future research are highlighted (6.3). The chapter ends with general conclusions (6.4). 
6.2 Summary of results 
My aim in the work described in this thesis was to establish how legume plants respond 
to rhizobial strains which differ in how much nitrogen they provide and how much 
carbon they use, and therefore in how effective they are at enhancing plant growth. First, 
in chapter 32 it was established that pea plants are not able to exert partner choice and 
discriminate against non-fixing strains before establishing the symbiosis: fixing and non-
fixing but otherwise isogenic strains have equal chances of forming a nodule on the plant 
root. It was discussed that partner choice is unlikely to evolve as a mechanism to protect 
against ineffective strains as it requires accurate detection of a trait which does not 
become apparent until after the symbiosis has been established. Such accurate detection 
is unlikely given the potential for dishonest signalling by the rhizobia3. Furthermore, 
even if plants could evolve a mechanism to detect mutations in nitrogen fixation, the 
shorter generation time of rhizobia4 as compared to plants would always put plants one 
step behind. It was argued that sanctioning is a more robust mechanism against 
ineffective strains  requiring no specific recognition signals and relying just on 
differential resource allocation based on benefits received. I corroborated earlier 
findings2,5,6 that nodules providing little nitrogen are smaller, indicating reduced plant 
resource allocation.  
 In chapter 4, I further explored how plants might differentially allocate resources 
to rhizobial strains in a model of plant growth and resource allocation. I considered 
strains varying in how much nitrogen they provide and how much carbon they use, under 
varying soil nitrogen conditions, and asked how plants should allocate resources to 
achieve maximum growth rates. The model predicted that optimal resource allocation 
involves allocating all resources to the single  best available  strain. Therefore, 
resource allocation to a given strain depends on other strains present on the same plant. 
Both effectiveness and efficiency determine which strain would be the best strain to 
invest in, and the relative importance depends on how nitrogen limited the plant is. The 
model also predicted that plants should cease to invest in nodules above a threshold soil 
nitrogen concentration  which is higher for more effective and for more efficient strains.  
 In chapter 5, I tested the model predictions in growth room experiments. I found 
that a strain fixing nitrogen at intermediate rates formed intermediate-sized nodules when 
singly inoculated or co-inoculated with a non-fixing strain, but formed smaller nodules 
when co-inoculated with a fixing strain. When plants were inoculated with three strains 
(non-fixing, intermediate-fixing and fixing), the fixing strain formed large nodules while 
the two other strains formed equally small nodules. So, in line with model predictions, 
resource allocation to a rhizobial strain depended on other strains present on the plant 
and resources were preferentially allocated to the single  best available  strain. In 
contrast to model predictions, resource allocation to a strain with increased carbon 
requirements did not depend on whether or not a more efficient strain was present. I 
could also not detect a threshold concentration of soil nitrogen which was strain-
dependent, but I did find that at high soil nitrogen concentrations all strains formed 
similar numbers of nodules of similar sizes.  
 The results of this thesis have implications for three lines of further research: i) 
understanding how sanctioning is regulated in the plant; ii) understanding the 
evolutionary dynamics of the symbiosis; and iii) how the knowledge gained can be used 
to select for effective (inoculant) strains and to enhance yields. 
6.3 Implications and future work 
6.3.1 Plant regulation of sanctioning 
The results of chapter 5 indicate that plants regulate nodule growth systemically and 
integrate information across the root system. Previous studies showing that ineffective 
nodules were smaller than effective nodules2,5,6 could be explained by a model in which 
resource allocation was proportional to nitrogen received. This type of regulation can be 
carried out locally, i.e. at the level of individual nodules or even bacteroids. In contrast, 
the findings presented in this thesis indicate that pea plants are able to compare nitrogen 
received from different nodules and adjust resource allocation  and therefore nodule 
growth (or vice versa)  accordingly. This integration of information requires systemic 
regulation. Systemic regulation of nodule initiation, growth, and activity was considered 
before sanctioning was even suggested, because of the observations that nitrate supply 
affects nodule initiation and growth, and that plants tend to have few large nodules, or 
many small nodules7,8. It was proposed that concentrations of nitrogenous compounds in 
the phloem entering the nodule, obviously dependent on plant nitrogen status, affect 
nodule growth and activity, possibly through regulation of oxygen supply8. However, 
this model does not explain how nitrogen fixation rates of different nodules are 
compared. Here, I propose an alternative mechanism based on cytokinin concentrations.  
 Regulation of nodule development based on nitrogen in the phloem seems 
plausible at first sight, but open questions remain, especially given the results described 
in this thesis. Undeniably, nitrogenous compounds circulating through the plant affect 
nodules. Nitrogen does not only come out of nodules, but also goes into the nodules911. 
Bacteroids rely not only on plant-derived carbon, but also on amino acid supply from the 
plant9,11,12. This supply can be used to regulate nodule activity and bacteroid 
development, as has been shown11,13. However, it remains unclear how plants would 
sense how much nitrogen comes out of nodules, and compare it to nitrogen levels in the 
plant or to other nodules, which is required to explain the observed results. Forming an 
idea of how plants might sense and compare how much nitrogen nodules provide is 
extremely difficult, since levels of the different nitrogenous compounds in the phloem 
fluctuate during the day14, as do rates of nitrogen fixation1517. In addition, both the 
amino acids in the phloem18 and the type of nitrogenous compounds exported from 
nodules19,20 are species-dependent. The regulation of nodule growth and its dependency 
on nitrogen fixation rates has received little research attention, but insight may be gained 
from research on systemic regulation of nodule initiation, and from research on nodule 
development.  
 Nodule initiation is systemically regulated in a process called autoregulation of 
nodulation (AON)21, in which cytokinin is an important regulator. Cytokinin is induced 
in the early stages of infection and is needed to initiate the cortical cell divisions that will 
lead to nodule formation2228. Localised high concentrations can induce formation of 
pseudonodules even in the absence of nodulating rhizobia29,30. Nodule formation 
subsequently inhibits initiation of other nodules, again through regulation by cytokinin. 
Cytokinin induces the formation of CLE peptides (CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED)3134, 
which are perceived in the shoot by LR-RKK (leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase) 
receptors, in turn inducing a shoot-derived systemic signal inhibiting further nodule 
formation3537. In split-root experiments, addition of cytokinin to one half-root decreased 
nodule formation in the other half-root38. Autoregulation of nodulation overlaps with 
nitrate signalling pathways. Cytokinin concentrations correlate with nitrogen supply in a 
range of species39,40, nitrate also induces formation of CLE peptides (sometimes but not 
always the same as the rhizobia-induced CLE peptides31,36,37) and reduces nodulation via 
the same LRR-RK receptors as AON36,41. So, it seems that although locally high 
cytokinin concentrations are needed to induce cortical cell divisions at the start of nodule 
formation, systemically increased cytokinin levels  through formation of nodules or 
uptake of soil nitrogen  reduces nodulation. 
 Nodule growth is regulated by the nodule meristem, which has been likened to 
lateral root meristems based on similar developmental processes4244. Cytokinin is a key 
regulator of meristem activity27,28,4447. In lateral roots, cytokinin stimulates root 
elongation30,48 and in nodule meristems, cytokinin receptors and response genes are also 
active24,27,4951. Cytokinin levels are especially high in nodule meristems of young, 
developing nodules, but decline with maturity, and cytokinin is involved in preventing 
early senescence44,52,53. Given the known roles of cytokinin in systemic regulation of 
nodule numbers and in regulation of nodule meristems, it is tempting to speculate that 
cytokinin is also involved in systemically regulating nodule growth and size.  
 Systemic regulation of nodule size based on cytokinin concentrations could be 
envisioned as follows (Figure 6-1): nodules grow faster and/or senesce later when the 
cytokinin concentration in the nodule is high compared to the concentration in the 
incoming phloem. The concentration in the nodule is determined by the rates of nitrogen 
fixation, and the concentration in the rest of the root system is determined by plant 
nitrogen status. Such regulation could explain the observed results. In single 
inoculations, under low external nitrogen conditions nodules of the fixing strain grow as 
their cytokinin concentration is higher than the root. By fixing nitrogen, they increase 
systemic levels of cytokinin thus inhibiting further nodule formation (AON). Thus, few, 
large nodules are formed and increasing external nitrogen affects mostly nodule size 
(chapter 5). In contrast, nodules of ineffective strains grow less since their cytokinin 
levels are not much higher than levels in the root, but systemic levels of cytokinin are 
also not increased so that new nodules continue to be formed. Thus, many, small nodules 
are formed and increasing external nitrogen affects mostly nodule number (chapter 5). 
Nodules of an intermediate-fixing strain would grow in the absence of a better strain, 
since cytokinin concentrations in the nodules would be relatively high compared to the 
root system. However, the presence of a better fixing strain on the same plant increases 
systemic cytokinin levels, so that the cytokinin concentration of the intermediate-fixing 
nodules does not exceed the root concentration and nodules fail to grow (chapter 5). 
Under this hypothesis, it would be possible that resources are allocated to more than one 
strain if the differences between strains are small. Regulation based on cytokinin 
concentrations, which depend on rates of nitrogen fixation, would also explain why I 
failed to see discrimination based on differences among strains in carbon requirements. 
 Some evidence is available to support the proposed hypothesis of systemic 
regulation of nodule size via cytokinin concentrations. First, there is an indication that 
cytokinin levels may correlate with nitrogen fixation rates. Nitrogen fixed by rhizobia is 
incorporated into glutamine in the plant cytosol as the first step in amino acid 
formation5458. Recently, it was shown in rice that cytokinin levels are increased not only 
in response to nitrate, but also in response to glutamine, through upregulation of ipt 
genes which encode for the first and rate-limiting step in cytokinin production40. It has 
also been shown that several ipt genes are expressed in Lotus japonicus nodules. 
Different ipt genes are expressed at different stages, and one gene (LjIPT3) was 
expressed specifically in vascular bundles and required for full development of mature 
nodules by preventing senescence59. Furthermore, in Medicago truncatula, the cytokinin 
response gene MtRR4 has been proposed to negatively regulate cytokinin signalling in 
mature nodules50. Intriguingly, mutant nodules with reduced expression of MtRR4 
continued to grow despite not fixing nitrogen when the wild-type nodules were already 
senescing60. 
 Testing the proposed cytokinin-based regulation still requires a lot of work, and 
the devil is likely to be in the details. There are several different cytokines which can 
also be interconverted, and their levels are tightly regulated both spatially and temporally 
by continuous production and degradation61. Cytokinin interacts with other plant 
hormones such as auxin62,63 and ethylene32,64 in regulating processes, and microRNAs 
have been shown to alter sensitivity to cytokinin, so that cytokines can have different 
effects at different stages of development65,66. A first step would be to obtain data on ipt 
gene expression or cytokinin concentrations in individual nodules under differing 
circumstances, including different combinations of strains on the same plant and under 
different nitrogen concentrations. It would also be worthwhile to manipulate cytokinin 
concentrations in the nodule and see what the effects on nodule growth are. 
Understanding plant genetic aspects of regulation would be easier in for example 
Medicago truncatula, for which plant mutant libraries exist67. Another approach would 
be to develop a simple mathematical model in which nodule growth is related to the 
difference in cytokinin concentrations between root and nodule. Such a model could be 
used to see whether the observed results can indeed be obtained based on this 
mechanism, and what the difference in cytokinin concentrations is likely to be, which 
can subsequently be compared to data.  
Figure 6-1. Hypothesis of cytokinin-based regulation of nodule initiation and development. 
The hypothesis explains integration of information needed to compare different nodules and 
adjust resource allocation accordingly. Cytokinin concentrations in the root system depend on 
plant nitrogen status, and cytokinin concentrations in the nodule depend on rates of nitrogen 
fixation. Only nodules with higher cytokinin concentrations than the root develop. Therefore, 
only nodules of the most effectively fixing strain(s) (darker colours) will develop and a strain 
fixing nitrogen at intermediate rates (outlined nodules) will form small nodules when a more 
effective strain is present.  
6.3.2 The legume-rhizobia symbiosis from an evolutionary biology perspective 
The legume-rhizobia symbiosis has been studied by evolutionary biologists interested in 
understanding the stability of mutualisms68. They predicted ineffective strains are likely 
to arise for two reasons3,69,70: (i) legume hosts tend to be infected with multiple strains71
74, so that in the absence of sanctions, each strain can potentially divert resources from 
the energy-intensive process of nitrogen fixation into rhizobial fitness, leaving nitrogen 
fixation to other strains, and (ii) rhizobia are horizontally transmitted and therefore their 
fitness is uncoupled from the plants fitness3,69,70. Partner choice and sanctioning were 
proposed as possible mechanisms preventing the spread of ineffective strains3,69,70,75,76. In 
this thesis, it was shown that pea plants are not able to exert partner choice, since fixing 
and non-fixing strains which were otherwise similar formed equal numbers of nodules on 
the plant root (chapter 32). With regards to sanctioning, I: (i) supported previous 
results5,6  which were based on experiments using argon gas  with experiments using 
mutant strains, showing that effectively fixing nodules are larger than non-fixing 
nodules, indicating they received more resources (chapter 32); (ii) showed that plants 
preferentially allocated resources to the single  best available  strain, so that resource 
allocation to an intermediate-fixing strain depended on whether or not a better alternative 
was available (chapter 5), in line with predictions about optimal resource allocation 
(chapter 4); (iii) found no indication that pea plants sanctioned based on carbon 
demands of strains (chapter 5), which contrasted with model predictions (chapter 4); 
and (iv) showed that at high soil nitrogen concentrations resource allocation to all strains 
became similar, indicating that sanctioning may be less effective in fertile environments 
(chapter 5). The results described in this thesis have implications for further research on 
the legume-rhizobia symbiosis from an evolutionary biology perspective.  
  The effects of sanctioning on rhizobial fitness have not been directly addressed 
in this thesis, but nonetheless the findings may contribute to understanding how 
sanctioning affects rhizobial fitness. There is considerable evidence that reduced 
resource allocation leading to smaller nodules does indeed decrease fitness of the strains 
in those nodules, as fewer viable bacteria are present5,6,77. Nonetheless, ineffective strains 
in the field are common7880. This is sometimes portrayed as a paradox81, but in fact the 
two are not mutually exclusive for several reasons. Firstly, rhizobial fitness does not 
depend solely on resources received from the plant, but also on survival in the soil82. 
Secondly, mixed infection nodules could be a way for ineffective strains to avoid 
sanctioning if nodules are sanctioned on the level of whole nodules, rather than 
individual bacteroids3,69,83 (as discussed in chapter 32). If nodule size is regulated by the 
nodule meristem, as proposed here (6.3.1), sanctioning would indeed take place on the 
whole nodule level. Third, strains of different effectiveness may coexist even in the 
presence of sanctioning81,84. Modelling predicted that the best strain to invest in may 
depend on external conditions (chapter 4) and resource allocation to a strain fixing 
nitrogen at reduced rates was substantial when the plant had no better alternative 
(chapter 5). In addition, sanctioning may not always result in near-complete reduction of 
resource allocation to the less effective strain. For example, the less effective strain may 
still receive a relatively large proportion of resources when few nodules of a more 
effective strain are present (discussed in chapter 5). Under the hypothesis of regulation 
based on cytokinin concentrations in the nodules (6.3.1), if strains differ only slightly, 
differences in resource allocation may also be small. Modelling plant sanctions with 
different combinations and proportions of strains combined with (multigenerational) 
experiments could shed more light on how sanctioning affects rhizobial fitness.  
 In the literature about sanctioning, it has generally been assumed that the 
diversion of plant-derived carbon away from nitrogen-fixation into rhizobial fitness leads 
to reduced rates of nitrogen fixation. I argued that it is equally possible that nitrogen-
fixation is not reduced, but the plant simply allocates more carbon. I therefore tested 
whether pea plants discriminate among strains based on how much carbon they require 
for nitrogen fixation, and found no indication that plants discriminated based on 
efficiency (chapter 5). This result indicates that rhizobial strains may increase their 
fitness by demanding more carbon without reducing their rate of nitrogen-fixation. In 
fact, the model predicts that the higher the rate of nitrogen-fixation, the more carbon a 
plant should be willing to invest in a given rhizobial strain (chapter 4). Interestingly, 
rhizobial strains have been described which synthesise compounds called rhizopines 
during effective nitrogen-fixation, and (later) use them as a carbon source8587. However, 
the role of these rhizopines remains to be elucidated and it is unlikely that they act only 
as a growth substrate86. 
 From a plant perspective, it would be interesting to see how the evolution of 
sanctioning relates to other aspects of legume evolution and how widespread sanctioning 
can be expected to be. The experiments described here were conducted on pea plants, 
which are part of the Inverted Repeat Lacking Clade (IRLC)88. Legumes in this group 
evolved relatively recently (39 million years ago89). It is therefore possible that the 
sophisticated mechanisms that underlie the observed resource allocation to the single  
best available  strain are limited to this clade. On the other hand, in the symbiosis with 
arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi which is older than the rhizobial symbiosis90  
preferential resource allocation to strains providing more phosphorus has been shown91. 
Furthermore, regulation may be widespread if it is based on mechanisms evolved for 
resource allocation to roots in heterogeneous environments92. IRLC legumes form 
indeterminate nodules88 and if nodule size is regulated by the meristem (6.3.1), this 
raises questions about how effectively regulation can take place in determinate nodules. 
But discrimination based on effectiveness has been shown, and was in fact first shown, 
among effective and less effective determinate (soybean) nodules5. So regulation of 
resource allocation in response to effectiveness seems to be widespread, but it remains to 
be seen whether resource allocation to the single  best available  strain, as observed 
here, is also widespread. IRLC legumes are known for forming symbioses with a narrow 
range of strains88 (in contrast to promiscuous nodulation, thought to be ancestral93). 
Possibly, allocating resources to the single  best available  strain works best when few 
strains are present (in this thesis up to three strains were tested), but less well in 
promiscuous species infected with many strains, each potentially forming only a small 
number of nodules. Repeating the experiments in a wider range of legume species, and 
even with AM fungi, may help in understanding how widespread the observed 
mechanisms of sanctioning are. 
6.3.3 The legume-rhizobia symbiosis from an agricultural perspective 
From an agricultural perspective, the legume-rhizobia symbiosis has been studied with 
an emphasis on enhancing yields. A major approach has been, and continues to be, 
finding and selecting rhizobial inoculant strains competitive in colonising roots and 
effective at enhancing yields94100. By addressing the question of partner choice, I studied 
one aspect of rhizobial competitiveness and the finding that an ineffective strain can be 
equally competitive as an effective strain (chapter 32) helps explain the difficulties in 
using inocula to enhance yields94,95,100,101. I studied sanctioning both theoretically 
(chapter 4) and experimentally (chapter 5), proposing that understanding how plants 
allocate resources to different rhizobial strains may also help in understanding how to 
select for elite strains, and how to effectively use rhizobia to enhance yields. The 
findings presented in this thesis are limited in that they are based on a single plant 
species using a single set of similar rhizobial strains. Further research as outlined above 
(6.3.1 and 6.3.2) can be imagined to be of future help in understanding how to enhance 
yields. For example, understanding how sanctioning is regulated genetically may guide 
plant breeding efforts. Understanding whether sanctioning is as effective in promiscuous 
species can guide which varieties need to be used under different circumstances. 
Soybean varieties for example differ in how promiscuous they are, and release of 
varieties has been tailored to specific circumstances before102. The current results also 
provide some suggestions for further work in the lab and under field conditions, 
especially if the results can be confirmed for a wider range of species.  
 In the lab, screening for effective rhizobial strains is often done by singly 
inoculating plants with each strain to be tested94,97,98,103. This process is labour intensive 
and time consuming. The results from this thesis indicate that screening might work just 
as well  or even better  when plants are co-inoculated. In single inoculations, the 
intermediate-fixing strain may have scored well in the traditional approach, forming 
relatively large nodules, albeit slightly smaller than the more effective strain. However, 
by co-inoculating the two strains the difference in size became larger, thus more clearly 
indicating which strain was more effective (chapter 5). Obviously, being able to screen 
strains by co-inoculating plants has the potential to save a lot of time and effort 
compared to single inoculations. Ideally, this approach would need to be coupled with 
fast and easy identification methods of the strains, so that differences in competitiveness 
can be simultaneously assessed. It seems that co-inoculation screening would be best 
performed under low soil nitrogen conditions, as is common practice94,97,104, as 
differences between strains became smaller with increasing soil nitrogen (chapter 5). 
 In screening for effective rhizobial strains, often used indicators are nodule 
number, nodule weight, plant yield and plant nitrogen content79,97,98,100,105. In this thesis, 
nodule size  as measured from photographs  was successfully used as an indicator of 
rhizobial effectiveness. The strain known to have the highest rate of nitrogen fixation 
formed the largest nodules, which was in line with previous observations based on 
nodule weight5,6 (chapter 32). Although it may be worthwhile to establish the 
relationship between nodule size and weight for different species, nodule size may be a 
very good alternative indicator of rhizobial effectiveness. Using nodule size has the 
advantage of being non-destructive, so that nodule sizes could be followed over time. 
Measuring nodule size is also less time consuming and labour intensive than picking and 
drying nodules to obtain nodule weights. However, development of good software to 
count and measure size of nodules is strongly recommended. Given the technological 
advances in image processing106 this seems feasible, and automating the process would 
not only save a lot of time and effort, but potentially yield more accurate and consistent 
results. 
 Under field conditions, understanding the dynamics of rhizobial strains and how 
they affect crops becomes even more difficult than under lab conditions. Lab-selected 
strains need to be tested under field conditions100, and effects of inoculation are 
varied95,100,101. There is no shortage of studies, but there is a need to understand the 
varied effects of rhizobial inoculants. Meta-analyses such as recently performed for 
soybean100 may prove crucial in obtaining this understanding, but the authors also 
indicated that simple and cheap methods for measuring nitrogen fixation need to be 
developed. Although an indirect measure of nitrogen fixation rates, using nodule size 
may be a possibility to explore. If adequate software is developed, obtaining complete 
distributions of nodule sizes on plants in the field could become as simple as taking 
pictures of excavated root systems. Data on nodule sizes may be used to guide what is 
limiting nitrogen fixation. For example, if most of the sampled plants have small 
nodules, but a few plants have a few very large nodules, this could indicate the presence 
of an effective yet not very competitive strain. If, on the other hand, most plants form a 
decent number of large nodules but yields remain low, this could indicate that the best 
available strain is not very effective at providing nitrogen under the particular conditions, 
or that something other than rhizobial nitrogen fixation limits yields. The method could 
also be used to screen populations of indigenous rhizobia, which is another aspect in 
need of attention100. It remains to be seen how informative data on nodule sizes can be, 
but it seems possible that information obtained can be helpful in understanding how 
(inoculant) rhizobial strains may enhance yields. 
6.4 General conclusions 
In this thesis, the legume-rhizobia symbiosis was studied from two perspectives  
evolutionary biology and agriculture  by integrating modelling and experimental 
approaches. The combination of two perspectives helped in addressing questions relevant 
for both. The methods developed because of the agricultural interest in competitive 
rhizobial strains could be used to address the question of partner choice posed by 
evolutionary biologists. The idea of sanctioning as proposed by evolutionary biologists 
was approached in a less theoretical manner as a question of optimal resource allocation, 
similar to the way agricultural researchers have long studied root growth in 
heterogeneous environments. This led to a more complete understanding of sanctioning, 
which in turn has implications for our understanding of using rhizobia to enhance yields. 
Modelling helped to formulate well-informed and testable hypotheses. Experiments 
supported some, but not all, model predictions, illustrating the importance of combining 
both approaches. Testing the model predictions relied on independent manipulation of 
several rhizobial characteristics. This could be achieved using mutant strains, 
overcoming previous experimental difficulties, and highlighting that evolutionary and 
applied questions in the field are unlikely to be answered without the solid foundation of 
lab-based groundwork. Looking forward, combining modelling and experimental 
approaches can be expected to further advance our understanding of legume-rhizobia 
symbioses. Undoubtedly, a deeper understanding will further enhance our appreciation 
for both legumes and rhizobia, and for how they together underpin our food production.

Policing the legume-Rhizobium 
symbiosis: a critical test of partner 
choice

In legume-Rhizobium symbioses, specialised soil bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen in return for carbon. 
However, ineffective strains can arise, making discrimination essential. Discrimination can occur via 
partner choice, where legumes prevent ineffective strains from entering, or via sanctioning, where 
plants provide fewer resources. Several studies have inferred that legumes exercise partner choice, 
but the rhizobia compared were not otherwise isogenic. To test when and how plants discriminate 
ineffective strains we developed sets of fixing and non-fixing strains that differed only in the expression 
of nifH  essential for nitrogen fixation  and could be visualised using marker genes. We show that the 
plant is unable to select against the non-fixing strain at the point of entry, but that non-fixing nodules 
are sanctioned. We also used the technique to characterise mixed nodules (containing both a fixing and 
a non-fixing strain), whose frequency could be predicted using a simple diffusion model. We discuss that 
sanctioning is likely to evolve in preference to partner choice in any symbiosis where partner quality 
cannot be adequately assessed until goods or services are actively exchanged.
Across the globe primary productivity is nitrogen limited1. This limitation has been overcome for plants in the 
family Fabaceae (commonly known as legumes) through a mutualistic association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria 
collectively called rhizobia2. The nitrogen provided through this symbiosis makes legumes rich in protein and 
important crops in human diets3. But, as ineffective strains will inevitably arise through mutation, there is the 
potential for the relationship to break down. Ineffective strains are known to be common, at least in some situa-
tions, which for agricultural legumes means poor yields and reduced nutritional quality4, 5.
Theory predicts that ineffective strains could be successful within legume  Rhizobium symbioses for two 
reasons6, 7. First, rhizobia are not transmitted directly from parent plant to offspring. Instead, plants acquire rhizo-
bia from the soil through an intricate signalling process in which bacteria enter specialized root nodules, where 
they fix nitrogen in return for plant-derived carbon8. This horizontal transmission means that rhizobial fitness is 
not perfectly aligned with the fitness of the host plant7. Second, although each nodule is usually occupied by the 
clonal descendants of a single Rhizobium9, 10, a plant is usually infected by multiple rhizobial strains11, 12. Thus, 
a non-fixing strain can potentially thrive by taking plant resources while leaving the costly process of nitrogen 
fixation to others7, 13. To prevent losing resources to ineffective rhizobial strains that provide little or no nitrogen, 
legumes have two options: partner choice or sanctions7.
Partner choice is usually defined as any mechanism that allows detection of suitable partners before a mutu-
alistic relationship is established7, 1315, while sanctioning is a mechanism to discriminate against low-quality 
partners once the relationship is underway6, 7, 1316 (although confusingly partner choice has also been used to 
describe a broader concept which includes sanctioning)13, 17, 18. Partner choice might seem to be the more attrac-
tive option as resources are not wasted setting up a relationship that is doomed to fail. But crucially, effective part-
ner choice requires accurate assessment of the quality of partners in advance13. This is likely to be problematical 
for any symbiosis in which key traits are not manifested prior to the relationship being established. For example, 
in the legume-Rhizobium symbiosis, nitrogen fixation does not begin until the bacteria have entered the roots 
and nodule formation is sufficiently advanced for rhizobia to have differentiated into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids8.

Once nodules are established they can be sanctioned, if they prove to be ineffective, by cutting off their supply of 
carbon, oxygen or other nutrients and this has been demonstrated empirically using argon gas to force nodules 
to fix less nitrogen1921.
Despite the empirical support for sanctioning and its apparent advantages, there are nevertheless several 
studies that claim evidence for partner choice7, 14, 15. However, the interpretation of these studies is problematic 
because the tested strains are rarely isogenic  meaning that strains differ in several traits, and not just in how 
much nitrogen they provide. Most importantly, strains are likely to differ in their competitiveness in colonizing 
plant roots and forming nodules. A range of traits affects competitiveness: examples include motility22, produc-
tion of antibiotics23 and the secretion of proteins and polysaccharides involved in biofilm formation and root 
attachment24. Such differences in competitiveness explain why poorly-fixing strains can also end up occupying 
a higher proportion of nodules  a problem that is often encountered when developing effective strains for use 
in agricultural settings4, 25, 26. Thus comparing the nodulation success of naturally occurring strains is difficult to 
interpret as a test of partner choice.
To test whether plants can directly assess the effectiveness of potential rhizobia prior to nodulation we cre-
ated a non-fixing mutant from a fixing strain and compared their success in colonising pea plant nodules. There 
are several key genes involved in nitrogen fixation8, any of which could undergo a mutation that would render 
the gene non-functional and hence transform the fixing into a non-fixing strain. We chose the nifH gene in 
Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae (Rlv) 3841, and created a non-fixing mutant that was otherwise identical to 
its fixing parent strain. We then assessed when and how the plant discriminated between the two strains. To iden-
tify strains, they were marked with gusA or celB marker genes, rendering strains magenta or blue (respectively) 
following the application of a simple post-harvest staining protocol. Insertion of marker genes solves a secondary 
problem as it is usually extremely time-consuming to identify different strains using antibiotic markers and this 
limits the number of nodules that can be assessed.
One possible complication is that a non-fixing strain can potentially thrive via mixed nodules (where two 
different bacteria have entered and colonised). If a non-fixing strain can take advantage of mixed nodules to 
increase its fitness at the expense of the fixing strain, then this would provide a route by which non-fixing strains 
could increase in frequency. Currently little is known about the frequency at which mixed nodules occur, and 
the relative fitness of strains within mixed nodules. The staining protocol rendered mixed nodules easily visible, 
so we assessed the frequency of mixed nodules under different inoculation densities. We discuss mixed nodules, 
partner choice and sanctioning in the context of the evolutionary stability of the legume-Rhizobium symbiosis.
Results
In single inoculations, the non-fixing mutant strain reduced shoot mass and formed small white nodules, while 
the fixing parent strain formed larger pink nodules (indicating the presence of leghaemoglobin) (Fig.1).
Figure 1. Comparison of the non-fixing strain RU3940, (a,c) and the otherwise isogenic fixing strain Rlv3841 
(b,d). After five weeks of growth, plants inoculated with the non-fixing strain (a) had reduced biomass and 
produced fewer peas than those inoculated with the fixing strain (b). The non-fixing strain formed white (c), 
rather than pink (d), nodules, indicating a lack of leghaemoglobin. Scale bars indicate 200 m.

Partner choice. To test for partner choice, we varied the ratio of the fixing: non-fixing strains in the inoc-
ulum (1:10, 1:1 and 10:1) and counted the number of fixing and non-fixing nodules after three weeks. In the 
absence of partner choice, we expect the percentage of nodules containing the fixing strain to reflect the percent-
age in the inoculum. In other words, we expect a 1:1 relationship between the percentage of fixing nodules and the 
percentage of the fixing strain in the inoculum (a slope of 1.0 through the origin). We found that the percentage 
of nodules containing only the fixing strain exactly reflected the percentage of the fixing strain in the inoculum 
(Fig.2). The slope of the regression line was 0.99  0.02 (95% CI [0.95, 1.02]) and this is not significantly different 
from 1.0 (t39 = 0.835, p = 0.41). The intercept was not significantly different from zero (t39 = 1.338, p = 0.189). 
Whether the fixing strain was marked with gusA or celB had no impact on the proportion of fixing nodules 
formed (t37 = 0.177, p = 0.861) or on the interaction with the inoculum ratio (t37 = 0.189, p = 0.851). Thus, 
pea plants do not discriminate between fixing and non-fixing strains prior to nodule formation and are therefore 
unable to exercise partner choice against the mutant strain.
Nodule size. In the absence of partner choice, sanctions remain the only option for discriminating against 
non-fixing strains. If pea plants are able to sanction and differentially allocate resources on the basis of the nitro-
gen provided, we expect nodules containing a fixing strain to be larger than nodules containing a non-fixing 
strain. We therefore measured the sizes of a sample of nodules colonised by the different strains. Nodules contain-
ing the nitrogen-fixing strain were significantly larger than nodules containing the non-fixing strain (paired t-test, 
t13 = 7.7176, p = 3.307  106), indicating that pea plants preferentially allocated resources to fixing nodules, sup-
porting sanctioning. Fixing nodules had an average area of 1.20  0.07 mm2 (mean  s.e.), and non-fixing nodules 
were 0.68 mm2 (95% CI [0.49; 0.87]) smaller  less than half of the area of fixing nodules (Fig.3).
Total number of nodules. Each pea plant formed 183  12 nodules (mean  s.e.) on average. The total num-
ber of nodules (Fig.4) decreased as the percentage of nitrogen-fixing nodules increased (slope = 0.88  0.34, 
t39 = 2.565, p = 0.0143), probably because the nodulation process is inhibited once fixing nodules have been 
successfully established. A ten-fold increase in the percentage of nitrogen-fixing nodules resulted in 72 fewer 
nodules in total (95% CI [9, 135])  a decrease of about 30%.

10:1 (fixing:non-fixing). (d) The percentage of nodules containing only the fixing strain exactly reflected the 
percentage of the fixing strain in the inoculum. The slope of the regression was 0.99  0.02, 95% CI [0.95, 1.02] 
and this is not significantly different from one (t39 = 0.835, p = 0.41).

Shoot mass. After three weeks of growth we found no differences in shoot dry mass among treatments, 
including water controls, (F3, 44 = 2.1921, p = 0.1024), presumably because the pea seeds contain large reserves 
of nitrogen. However, after five weeks of growth, independently grown plants inoculated with non-fixing 
RU3940 weighed 0.32  0.04 grams (mean  s.e.) while plants inoculated with the fixing strain Rlv3841 weighed 
0.68  0.04 grams, a significant difference of 0.37 grams (95% CI [0.23, 0.51]).
Frequency of mixed nodules. The staining technique allowed clear visualization of mixed nodules, which 
occasionally appeared to result from multiple independent infections (Fig.5A), but normally consisted of two  
a fixing and a non-fixing strain (Fig.5B,C). Mixed nodules occurred at an average frequency of 2.02%  0.35% 
(mean  s.e.), and the frequency depended on the inoculum ratio (Fig.5D). According to a simple diffusion 
model (in which we assume that the two rhizobial strains in the soil are well mixed) the predicted frequency of 
mixed nodules (F) is simply given by F = pq, where p is the frequency of the fixing strain, q is the frequency of 
the non-fixing strain and  is the unknown probability with which two bacteria simultaneously enter the same 
nodule; hence: F  pq. We regressed F against pq (encounter rate, Fig.5D) and found that the frequency of mixed 
nodules indeed increased in proportion to the increase in encounter rate: a  three-fold increase in encounter 
rate increased the odds of a mixed infection 3.5 times (95% CI [2.2, 5.9], n = 41). In an additional experiment, we 
varied the total inoculation density, as the diffusion model also predicts that mixed nodules occur more often at 
Figure 3. Legumes sanction non-fixing nodules. Nodules containing the fixing strain were significantly larger 
than nodules containing the fixing strain (paired t-test, t13 = 7.7176, p = 3.307  106), indicating that pea plants 
preferentially allocated resources to fixing nodules.

increased (slope = 0.88  0.34, t39 = 2.565, p = 0.0143). Regression with 95% confidence interval shown.

higher densities of rhizobia. As predicted, we found that the percentage of mixed nodules increased with inocu-
lation density (slope = 1.87  0.41, t18 = 4.545, p = 0.000251). A 10-fold increase in inoculation density, increased 
the percentage of mixed nodules by almost 2%.
Fitness of rhizobial strains within mixed nodules. To assess the relative fitness of fixing versus 
non-fixing strains within mixed nodules, we measured the area occupied by each strain as indicated by the area 
stained blue versus magenta (or vice versa). We found that the percentage of nodule area occupied by the fixing 
strain ranged from 1.1 to 99%. Unfortunately, although the staining technique is valuable in visualizing mixed 
nodules, we conclude that it cannot be reliably used to assess the relative fitness of different strains within mixed 
nodules. The percentage of the nodule occupied by the fixing strain depended highly on the marker used to iden-
tify the fixing strain (t218 = 14.49, p < 2  1016). If the fixing strain was marked with gusA, it appeared to occupy 
31% of the nodule (95% CI [27.5; 33.6%]), but if the fixing strain was marked with celB, it appeared to occupy 75% 
of the nodule (95% CI [68.7; 80.0%].
Discussion
We created a non-fixing but otherwise isogenic mutant to mimic a process that might occur in nature, where a 
mutation arises in a fixing rhizobial strain, rendering it ineffective. We found that pea plants could not discrim-
inate between these fixing and non-fixing strains prior to nodule formation. Pea plants were therefore unable 
to detect whether the potential partner was effective at fixing nitrogen and could not prevent the formation of 
non-fixing nodules. Our results are supported by an early study using similar isogenic strains27, but this study was 
severely limited in sample size and has therefore been overlooked.
Our results indicate that partner choice is not a robust mechanism against ineffective strains as pea plants were 
unable to prevent non-fixing strains from entering. It could be argued that legumes may use genes other than nifH 
to assess the nitrogen fixation capacity of fixing strains before nodule formation; however we believe that this is 
unlikely. A mutation rendering a strain less effective can arise in any gene and effective partner choice would then 
require a mutation in the plant genome to detect this change. If the new mutation stops the cheat from entering, 
then it will spread through the plant population; however, given that rhizobial generation times are much faster 
than host plant generation times28, it seems that the host plants will be locked in an evolutionary arms race that 
they are doomed to lose; hence partner choice seems to be an ineffective way to stabilise the mutualism in the long 
term21. Furthermore, partner choice is susceptible to dishonest signals13.
In contrast, we found that pea plants did discriminate against ineffective strains via sanctioning, which has 
been previously reported using argon gas to replace atmospheric nitrogen1921. In our experiment, nodules

containing the non-fixing strain were roughly half the size of fixing nodules, indicating reduced plant resources. 
In contrast to the case of partner choice, sanctioning can stabilise the mutualism in the long-term. If a mutation 
arises that allows a plant to detect and sanction a partner that is not delivering the goods it would be effective 
against a wide variety of future ineffective strains. Thus, sanctioning allows an instantaneous response to inef-
fective strains and does not require specific recognition genes or rely on honest signals. Sanctioning is therefore 
a more robust13 mechanism against ineffective strains and can provide long-term stability to legume-Rhizobium 
mutualisms16, 29.
However, any discussion of sanctioning should take into account both plant and rhizobial fitness. Sanctioning 
can only be selected for when it saves plant resources and thus increases plant fitness. The reduced nodule size 
that we and others20, 21 have seen indicates that plants allocate fewer resources to non-fixing nodules. Whether 
this reduced resource allocation also reduces rhizobial fitness and thus stabilizes the mutualism on evolutionary 
time-scales is more difficult to establish. This may depend on whether or not the nitrogen-fixing bacteroids can 
still reproduce (usually determinate nodules), or are terminally differentiated and unable to reproduce (indeter-
minate nodules)30. In studies using argon gas, reduced rhizobial fitness has been shown in both determinate19, 
20 and indeterminate21 non-fixing nodules. However, in a study using a non-fixing isogenic strain, the fitness of 
non-fixing rhizobia was not reduced in determinate soybean nodules up to five weeks old31. Because effects on 
rhizobial viability may emerge later in the sanctioning process, perhaps the best test would be a multigenerational 
experiment, where in the first generation plants are inoculated with both fixing and non-fixing strains, and new 
plants are then repeatedly grown in the same soil for several generations to see how quickly the non-fixing strain 
is eliminated. It would be of special interest to perform such an experiment with both indeterminate and deter-
minate species.
Evidence from other mutualisms suggests that whether partner choice evolves in preference to sanctioning 
critically depends on how well partners can assess quality prior to establishment of the mutualistic relationship 
including the potential for dishonest signalling. For example, clients of the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus have 
evolved partner choice to counter cheating by individuals that take healthy tissue while removing parasites32. 
Partner choice is highly effective in this mutualism because the quality of service is known from previous experi-
ence and there are repeated interactions between individuals. In contrast, sanctioning has evolved in mutualisms 
between yucca moths and fig wasps and their respective plant hosts. In both cases the insects deposit seed-eating 
larvae in the flowers of host plants in return for pollination. In these mutualisms, plants cannot prevent eggs being 
laid nor assess partner quality, hence sanctioning has evolved: flowers containing too many eggs33, or too little 
pollen33, 34 are selectively aborted.
While our study shows that partner choice is not a robust mechanism to exclude ineffective strains, legumes 
do not form symbioses with all potential rhizobial strains. Instead, an extensive signalling process3537 between 
legumes and their rhizobial partners can impose a high degree of selectivity on the relationship36, 38, 39, although 
the degree of selectivity varies greatly among hosts39. There are two explanations for this selectivity that are com-
monly proposed and are not mutually exclusive. First, specificity may arise in order to prevent the entry of patho-
genic bacteria which utilise similar signalling pathways to gain access to host roots38, 40, 41. Second, by fine-tuning 
signalling pathways to target rhizobia that are particularly effective for a specific host, legume species might 
achieve greater nitrogen-fixation efficiency42, 43. This is likely to be true if host environments are sufficiently dif-
ferent that specialization by rhizobia is selected for. Support for specialization comes from the observation that 
a single rhizobial strain can vary greatly in its effectiveness among hosts42. This type of co-evolutionary process 
is separate from the need to avoid non-fixing rhizobia, which can arise by mutation at any time, in any strain, 
even those that are usually highly effective. That these two processes are indeed separate is supported by the fact 
that the genes involved in nitrogen fixation (nif and fix genes) are only expressed once the symbiosis has been 
established44 and are different from the signalling genes involved in infection (nod genes)45. Currently, genomic 
analyses are shedding more light on the selective pressures affecting both legume and rhizobial genes4648.
Sanctioning is a robust mechanism against ineffective strains, but requires hosts to monitor partner quality 
and provide resources accordingly. Currently, little is known about the exact mechanism behind sanctioning in 
legume-Rhizobium symbioses, and whether it only takes place at the nodule level, or also occurs within nodules13, 
16. If sanctioning takes place at the nodule level, mixed nodules could be a way for ineffective strains to avoid 
sanctions6, 13, 49. Indeed certain endosymbionts, even those belonging to different genera and lacking any genes 
for nitrogen fixation, have been shown to co-infect nodules by piggybacking on the genuine symbionts as they 
infect the root hairs50. Whether mixed nodules allow ineffective strains to persist depends on the frequency of 
mixed nodules, and on the relative fitness of fixing and non-fixing strains within mixed nodules. Estimates of 
the frequency of mixed nodules in the literature range from 2% to 74%6, 51. Our findings at least partly explain 
this variability as the frequencies we found could be adequately represented by a simple diffusion model, which 
predicts that more mixed nodules are expected: (1) at high rhizobial densities; (2) when the proportions of dif-
ferent strains are similar; and (3) when rhizobia diffuse more easily, which might occur, for example, under wet 
conditions. Although the staining technique is valuable in identifying strains and characterising mixed nodules, 
it could not be used reliably to assess fitness of rhizobial strains within mixed nodules. Further work on the mech-
anism of sanctioning, how it is affected by external conditions such as soil nitrogen, and how it affects rhizobial 
fitness will help illuminate how the legume-Rhizobium mutualism has persisted for much longer than humans 
have been around to reap its benefits.
Methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions. We used Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae (Rlv) 3841 
strains labelled at identical positions in the chromosome with either a gusA or a celB marker gene52 (Table1). 
Non-fixing mutants of these strains were made by replacing the nifH gene with a nifH gene disrupted by a spectin-
omycin resistance cassette (nifH::Spc). Rhizobium leguminosarum only has a single copy of the nifH gene53, 
www.nature.com/scientificreports/
7Scientific RepoRts | 7: 1419  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-01634-2
which is essential for nitrogen fixation54. First, an unmarked non-fixing strain was made, then the non-func-
tional nifH gene was transduced into the marked fixing strains. To make the unmarked non-fixing strain, the 
nifH gene was amplified by PCR (2,660 bp product) using primers p950 and p951 that contain a SacI and SpeI 
restriction site and cloned into pCR2.1 in Dam- E. coli SCS110 (Stratagene) (pRU1907). A  spectinomycin 
cassette from pHP45-Sp was cloned between two NruI sites within nifH resulting in a 166 bp deletion, and the 
nifH::Spc fragment was cloned into the suicide vector pJQ200SK (pRU1908). Plasmid pRU1908 was conjugated 
into Rlv3841, and cells were plated on TY agar with gentamicin (20 g ml1) and then on AMS agar supplemented 
with 10% sucrose, 10 mM NH4Cl, and spectinomycin (100 g ml1) to select for gene replacement. Strain RU3940 
was found to contain the correct nifH::Spc mutation by PCR mapping using pOT forward with either p1002 
or p1118 in separate reactions. To confirm differences in the nitrogen-fixing capacity of the two strains, we per-
formed acetylene reductions on plants inoculated with either RU3940 or Rlv3841. RU3940 does not fix nitrogen 
(0.05  0.02 (mean  s.e, n = 3) mol ethylene per plant per hour, which is not different from water control plants 
(t6 = 0.025, p = 0.98)), whereas the parent strain Rlv3841 does fix nitrogen (2.58  0.33 (mean  s.e, n = 3) mol 
ethylene per plant per hour).
The nifH::Spc cassette from non-fixing strain RU3940 was transduced into the gusA or celB marked strains 
using phage RL3855, yielding non-fixing gusA (OPS0365) and celB (OPS0366) marked strains which are other-
wise isogenic to their fixing gusA and celB marked parent strains. Correct insertion of the nifH::Spc cassette 
from RU3940 was confirmed by PCR mapping using pOT forward with either oxp460 or opx461 in separate 
reactions (Supplementary Fig.S1). Enzyme assays on free living cultures confirmed conservation of the gusA and 
celB marker genes in the non-fixing mutants (Supplementary Fig.S2 and Supplementary Fig.S3 respectively). 
Bacterial cultures were maintained on TY agar56 with 500 g ml1 streptomycin (all strains) and 100 g ml1 
spectinomycin (RU3940, OPS0365 and OPS0366 only).
Plant growth. Pea (Pisum sativum cv Avola) seeds were germinated in the dark for five days on agar plates 
at room temperature and then transferred to 500 ml pots containing a mixture of silver sand - fine vermiculite 
(1:1 v/v) substrate, 75 ml nitrogen free nutrient solution (as in Poole et al.57 but 2.67 times more concentrated) and 
1 ml rhizobial inoculum. Peas were grown in the growth room at 21 C with a 16 hour photoperiod.
Experimental designs. To test for partner choice, we applied rhizobial inocula consisting of 1:10, 1:1 and 
10:1 ratios of fixing to non-fixing strains. To exclude any effect of the gusA or celB marker genes, both combina-
tions were tested: fixing gusA (3841 gusA) with non-fixing celB (OPS0366) strains and fixing celB (3841 celB) with 
non-fixing gusA (OPS0365) strains. Total inoculum density for all treatments was 1  104 cells per pot. Rhizobial 
cultures for the inocula were spread-plated to confirm numbers of rhizobia in the inocula. In a fully randomized 
design, we grew 49 plants in total: six treatments plus a water control (no rhizobia), all replicated seven times. 
Plants were grown for 21 days without additional watering.
To assess the effect of inoculation density on the frequency of mixed nodules, plants were inoculated with 1:1 
ratios of fixing gusA (3841 gusA) to non-fixing celB (OPS0366) strains at total densities of 1  102, 1  103, 1  106

and 1  108 cells per pot. In a fully randomized design, we grew five plants at each inoculum density plus two 
water controls. Plants were grown for 38 days and watered with sterilized water as needed after 21 days.
To test for differences in markers on the percentage of the nodule area occupied by the fixing strain, six plants 
were grown in an additional independent experiment, inoculated with 1:1 ratios of fixing celB (3841 celB) to 
non-fixing gusA strains (OPS0365) at a total density of 1  10^8 cells per pot. Plants were grown for 37 days and 
watered with sterilized water as needs after 21 days.
To assess the phenotype of non-fixing mutant strain RU3940, plants were inoculated with either fixing strain 
Rlv3841 or non-fixing strain RU3940 and grown for four or five weeks in independent experiments.
Harvest. At harvest, roots were gently washed and then stained for gusA and celB marker genes58. In alu-
minium covered tubes, roots were incubated overnight at 28 C submerged in phosphate buffer (7 g L1 
NaH2PO4, 7.2 g L1 Na2HPO4, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8), 1% Sarkosyl, 1 ml L1 Triton) supplemented with 0.2 mg ml1 
Magenta-glc (5-bromo-6-chloro-3-indolyl--D-glucuronide). In fresh phosphate buffer, roots were then incu-
bated at 70 C for 1 hour 45 min. After cooling down, X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl--D-galactopyranoside) 
was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mg ml1 and roots were incubated overnight at 37 C. This yielded visi-
bly magenta (gusA marked strains), blue (celB marked strains) or magenta and blue (mixed) nodules (Fig.2AC). 
Shoots were dried at 70 degrees Celsius for 2472 hours and then weighed.
Data collection. Roots were carefully laid out so that all nodules were visible and then photographed. Two 
people independently counted blue and magenta nodules from photographs taken of whole roots, zooming in as 
necessary, and the average was taken as the final count. Mixed nodules were counted and photographed using a 
dissecting microscope (Leica M165 FC) with accompanying software (LAS v4.5). To estimate size of nodules con-
taining fixing versus non-fixing strains, we measured the area of nodules from the photographs taken of the whole 
root, using ImageJ v1.49v59, which allowed for measuring areas of irregular shapes. Ten fixing and ten non-fixing 
nodules were randomly selected for each of the 14 plants inoculated with a 1:1 ratio of fixing to non-fixing strains 
(7 of which had the gusA marked fixing strain and 7 had the celB marked fixing strain). To estimate the percent-
age of mixed nodules that was occupied by the fixing strain, we measured the areas of blue and magenta in all 
mixed nodules for which this was possible (distinct enough areas of blue and magenta), using ImageJ. Additional 
microscopy was done on whole nodules (five-week-old nodules). Images were taken with a dissecting microscope 
(Leica M165 FC) with accompanying software (LAS v4.5).
Statistical analyses. We tested for partner choice by regressing the percentage of nodules containing 
nitrogen-fixing rhizobia against the percentage of nitrogen-fixing rhizobia in the inoculum. If plants do not exert 
partner choice, we expect a 1:1 relationship (a slope of 1.0). Water controls and mixed nodules were excluded 
from this analysis. To test whether the presence of gusA versus celB marker genes affected competitive ability, we 
carried out an ANCOVA with the marker gene as the categorical variable. Results presented are from the regres-
sion model without this interaction, as marker genes did not affect the slope (t37 = 0.189, p = 0.851) or intercept 
(t37 = 0.177, p = 0.861) of the regression line. The intended inoculation ratios were used as the explanatory var-
iable, as it was confirmed using colony counts that the actual ratios in inocula did not deviate by more than 11% 
from intended inoculation ratios (n = 6, mean  s.e. 3.78  1.49%, Supplementary TableS1). Accounting for this 
deviation did not change results, and if anything would lead to a decrease of the estimate of the slope (whereas for 
partner choice we would expect an increase of the estimate of the slope).
To test for differences in size between fixing and non-fixing nodules, we performed a paired t-test on the 
average size of ten nodules, pairing fixing and non-fixing nodules of each plant. To test whether the total number 
of nodules formed depended on the ratio of fixing to non-fixing strains in the inoculum, we regressed the total 
number of nodules against the percentage of fixing strain in the inoculum. Shoot mass was also regressed against 
the percentage of the fixing strain in the inoculum. To assess the frequency of mixed nodules, we analysed how 
the occurrence of mixed nodules depended on the inoculation ratio of fixing to non-fixing strains with a gener-
alized linear model using a quasibinomial distribution and a logit link function (because data were expressed as 
proportions and there was significant overdispersion). We also regressed the percentage of mixed nodules against 
the log of the total inoculation density. Whether the fixing strain was marked with gusA or celB had no impact 
on the proportion of mixed nodules detected (t37 = 0.494, p = 0.62493) or on the interaction with the encounter 
rate (t37 = 1.137, p = 0.26301), so we present results from analyses which do not include this interaction. To assess 
fitness of fixing to non-fixing strains within mixed nodules, we used a linear model testing for the effect of the 
marker (gusA or celB) used to mark the fixing strain. Individual nodules were seen as the unit of replication, and 
this was confirmed to be a valid assumption as the plant from which nodules came accounted for only 9% of the 
variation in the data. All analyses were performed in R version 3.0.260.

Supplementary figure 1 
Supplementary Figure 1. Confirmation of successful insertion of nifh::spec 
mutation into gusA and celB marked strains. Successful insertion yields gusA and 
celB marked nifh::spec (non-fixing) mutants. Primers were designed to bind in the 
spec cassette and upstream and downstream of the nifH gene, yielding fragments 
upstream and downstream of the spec cassette respectively. If the insertion worked 
correctly, PCR fragments upstream and downstream of the insertion have the same 
length in the marked mutants as in the original unmarked nifh::spec mutant (RU3940, 
black box). Multiple strains were made (8 celB strains and 9 gusA strains (strain 6 not 
included in PCR because gusA marker could not be confirmed)), some of which could 
not be confirmed. gusA marked strain 5 (OPS0365) and celB marked strain 2 (OPS0366) 
were used in this study (red boxes).  
Primers used for upstream fragment: oxp0460 (GCTTGATCATCGCCGGAAAC), 
binding before the start codon of the nifH gene, and pOT forward 
(CGGTTTACAAGCATAAAGC), binding in the spec cassette. Primers used for 
downstream fragment: pOT forward (binds in two places in spec cassette) and oxp0461 
(TGTCACCGCCGAAAACGATG), binding downstream of the nifH gene.  
Supplementary figure 2 
Supplementary Figure 2. Confirmation conservation of gusA marker gene. It was 
confirmed that the novel strains with the nifh::spec insertion still have the original 
gusA marker. The left hand plate contains the nitrogen-fixing strains on TY medium with 
streptomycin and X-glcA, the substrate which yields a blue colour if there is gusA 
encoded -glucuronidase activity. Only the gusA marked strain is blue (top section), not 
the unmarked wild type and celB marked strain, as expected. The plate on the right hand 
side contains nifh::spec mutants on TY medium with streptomycin, spectinomycin and 
X-glcA. Again, only the gusA marked strains OPS0364 (not used in this study) and

Supplementary Figure 3. Confirmation conservation of celB marker gene. It was 
confirmed that the novel strains with the nifh::spec insertion still have the original celB 
marker. Free living cultures provided with X-gal yield a blue colour if there is celB 
encoded -galactosidase activity. Replicate B (bottom) was not heat treated, so the 
endogenous -galactosidase activity yields a blue colour for all strains. Replicate A (top) 
was heat treated, during which endogenous -galactosidase was destroyed. Only the 
thermostable celB marked strains (celB marked nitrogen-fixing 3841, and OPS0366 (this 
study) and OPS0367) yield a blue colour. Unmarked original wild type 3841 and 
nifh::spec (RU3940) are white, just as gusA marked strains OPS0364 and OPS0365.

# This code is used to model plant growth and  
# resource allocation to rhizobia, under 
# different soil nitrogen conditions.  
## PART A: model functions 
#     - Single strain model constant soil N 
#     - Two strain model constant soil N 
#     - Two strain model dynamic soil N 
# Constant soil N means that the soil nitrogen concentration is constant over  
# the time course of the simulation, but the concentration 
# may of course be varied in different simulations.  
# Versions presented here use analytically derived 
# optimal values for parameters f (allocation to aboveground biomass) 
# and a (allocation to nodules). 
# Versions in which the user specifies the values for f and a 
# are simpler and can be found in the full version of the code. 
## PART B: code to run the model 
# The version presented here is to run a single simulation 
# To run multiple simulations, see the full version of the code.

Appendix D. Supplementary material chapter 5: Resource 
allocation in the legume-rhizobia symbiosis 
Overview 
The supplementary material of chapter 5 consists of: 
1. Results based on randomly selected (rather than most developed) nodules. 
2. ReadMe document for data 
3. R code used to analyse the data. 
The data and R code that support the findings of this chapter are deposited in the Oxford 
Research Archive (ORA-Data) repository, at DOI: 10.5287/bodleian:BDVypApax. 
1. Results based on randomly selected nodules 
In single inoculations, randomly selected nodules of the intermediate-fixing strain 
averaged 1.24 mm2, 95 % CI [1.06, 1.42], which is larger, but not quite significantly so, 
than Fix nodules (a difference of 0.21 mm2, 95% CI [-0.06, 0.47], and significantly 
smaller than Fix+ nodules (a difference of 0.29 mm2, 95% CI [0.04, 0.54] (Figure 1). 
These results are in line with our findings based on measuring the most developed 
nodules.  
 Figure 1. Nodule sizes of strains differing 
in effectiveness in single inoculations 
(Fix; OPS0365, FixInt; LMB827, Fix+; 
Rlv3841 gusA). Points represent an 
average of ten nodules. Symbols indicate 
data from independent experiments. Plants 
were grown for 28 days without external 
nitrogen. 
 In line with results based on the most developed nodules, average size of 
randomly selected intermediate-fixing nodules was decreased when co-inoculated with 
the fixing strain as compared to when co-inoculated with itself (a difference of 0.48 
mm2, 95% CI [0.29, 0.66]). Co-inoculation with the non-fixing strain led to slightly 
larger nodules of the intermediate-fixing strain (a difference of 0.29 mm2, 95% CI [0.09, 
0.46]) (Figure 2). Such compensation in nodule size when fewer effective nodules are 
present has been reported before1, but was not observed based on the ten most developed 
nodules. For comparison, average nodule sizes of randomly selected nodules of the Fix 
and Fix+ strain are shown (Figure 3). 
Figure 2. Nodule area of the intermediate-
fixing strain (LMB827) when co-
inoculated with a non-fixing strain 
(OPS0365), with itself, or with the fixing 
strain (Rlv3841 gusA). The overall mean is 
indicated with an orange triangle. Points 
represent an average of ten nodules. 
Symbols indicate data from independent 
experiments. Plants were grown for 28 
days without external nitrogen.  
 Figure 3. Nodule area of the non-fixing 
strain (OPS0365) and the fixing strain 
(Rlv3841 gusA), both when co-inoculated 
with the intermediate-fixing strain 
(LMB827). The mean size of the 
intermediate-fixing strain, as measured on 
the same plants, is indicated as an orange 
triangle for reference. Points represent an 
average of ten nodules. Symbols indicate 
data from independent experiments. Plants 
were grown for 28 days without external 
nitrogen. 
In line with results based on the most developed nodules, average size of randomly 
selected nodules decreased with increasing soil nitrogen concentrations (F1,79 = 
76.31602, p < 0.001), and at high soil nitrate concentrations all strains became similar in 
size (Figure 4).  
 Figure 4. Nodule sizes decrease as a 
function of soil nitrate availability. The 
effect was most pronounced for the fixing 
strain (black circles), which at zero 
nitrogen forms the largest nodules, so that 
at high nitrate concentrations all nodules 
are similar in size. Nodule size for each 
plant was based on the average of ten 
nodules. Points represent mean  s.e. of 3-
6 replicate plants grown for 27-29 days. 
KNO3 was added at planting in the stated 
amounts. Fix; OPS0365, FixInt; LMB827,

# Notes on acetylene reduction calculations: 
# STP = standard temperature and pressure:   
# 273.15 K (0 degrees C, 32 degrees F) and  
# an absolute pressure of exactly 100 kPa (1 bar). 
# At STP, 1 mol of acetylene occupies 22.41 L and  
# at 25 degrees Celsius it occupies 24.465 L  
# (can verify this using P1V1 / T1 = P2V2 / T2).  
# The area under a gas-chromatograph peak is proportional to  
# the amount ( moles ) of compound eluted. Hence, the molar percentage  
# composition of a mixture can be approximated by  
# comparing relative peak areas. 
# Initial concentration of acetylene is 2%  
# (added 6.4 mL of 100% acetylene gas and 
# total volume of bottle is 320 mL)

# At 25 degrees Celsius and normal pressure 1 mol of  
# acetylene takes up 24.465 L. So: 
results_ARA$uMol_Acetylene_Added <- (0.02 * 0.320 / 24.465) * 1000000 
# Then, calculate the percentage of acetylene converted to ethylene.  
# Perc_Ethylene and Perc_Acetylene give 
# the percentage of ethylene and acetylene (in terms of moles)  
# measured in sample,as derived from peak area by GC.  
# In most cases they add up to 100%,  
# in some cases there was a small percentage of something else.
