SYNOPSIS 
This thesis considers the problems associated with the analysis 
and prediction of rock slope behaviour in the environment of British 
surface coal mining. Its studies form part of a wider research 
program considering the stability of Coal Measures slopes and mine 
design. 
It considers the requirements for quantitative data in order 
to define slope environments. The results of a survey of a number 
of cases of slope instability are reported, together with the 
detailed history of instability encountered during the complete 
working life of one large mine. The conclusions gained from an 
analysis of this historical data contribute to the assessment 
of instability mechanisms and contributory factors and thence 
the design and application of analytical techniques. 
The need for integrated field monitoring and mapping, supported 
by laboratory testing, is stressed as the means of developing 
effective slope analysis methods. The results of monitoring projects 
at three mines in a range of slope settings are finally reported. 
These projects aim to characterize the extent of deformation 
arising during and after slope excavation and to assess the 
influence of various mining, geological and environmental factors.

INTRODUCTION 
Nationa1isation of surface coal mining in the U.K. occurred 
in 1952. The Opencast Coal Act 1958 then placed surface mining 
operations on a statutory basis and provided new terms of 
compensation and control over the planning of working operations 
and the restoration of land. In 1974 the Government, National 
Coal Board and mining unions co-operated to publish Plan for 
Coal which outlined a joint commitment to an expansion of the 
coal industry. Surface coal mining was thereby planned to increase 
annual coal production from 10 million tons to 15 million tons 
within six years. In the financial year 1979/80 the N.C.B. 
surface coal production was 13 million tons, providing an operating 
profit of fl09.7 million, in contrast to the deep mined production 
of 108.6 million.tons which incurred an operating loss of 138.2 
million. This significant contribution towards the viability of 
the N.C.B. is also supplemented by the surface mined production 
of half of the U.K. a~thracite requirements and substantial 
tonnages of coking coal. Surface coal output is also important 
in its use for blending with local colliery production. Other 
contributions are the reclamation of derelict areas, improvement 
in land usage through agricultural restoration and provision of 
leisure amenities on restored sites. 
The N.C.B. Opencast Executive operates around 80 mines at 
anyone point in time within six component regions in the U.K. 
This large number of sites and geographical dispersion entails 
that there is a wide range in mine setting relat~d to variation 
in geology, climate and other environmental factors. The extent 
- 2 -
and duration of U.K. surface mines thus range in scale from the 
Westfield O.C.C.S. (opencast coal site), the largest open pit 
operation in Europe extracting 20 million tons of coal to a 
depth of 214 m, down to numerous mines working reserves of less 
than .5 million tons to depths of less than 50 m. 
The creation of a surface mine excavation will induce 
deformation in the ground which comprises" the internal area of 
the mine as well as a limited extent of ground on the periphery 
of the mine boundary slopes. Such deformation may be induced 
entirely at first by the removal of the constraint previously 
aff~rded by the volume of ground excavated, i.e. constitute 
natural rebound on ground relaxation. Deformation must also 
be considered as arising from the loading induced by placement 
of spoil within or on the periphery of the mine excavation. The 
excavation will expose slopes containing acombination of 
geometrical, geological and hydrological features which under 
the possible influence of other factors may contribute to 
further de"formation with time. Geometrical features are controlled 
by mine planning, an important objective of which is to predict 
the behaviour of slopes upon excavation and thus design slopes 
whicn will minimise the hazards arising from excessive deformation, 
whilst affording a viable production plan. Success in slope 
design lies in the anticipation and avoidance of hazardous 
deformation and not in the effectiveness of remedial measures. 
The philosophy, prevalent in some overseas open pit operations, 
that design can allow for some slope failures, which are 
accommodated within production processes, is not tenable in the 
confined and more labour-intensive operations of U.K. surface 
- 3 -
coal mines. The structure and petrology of the mine rock and 
soil units primarily determine the overall strength of the slope 
and susceptibility to deformation. The groundwater regime is 
also a principal feature since it can contribute adverse 
motivating forces and weaken component materials within the 
slope structure. These three principal features are often 
complex and difficult to defi~e in the mine exploration phase. 
Their precise influence on deformational processes often are 
little understood. These problems have dictated that slope 
design has often approached an art rather than a science, with 
substantial reliance being placed on experience and intuition. 
Difficulty in design arises not only from lack of quantitative 
data to enable problem definition, but also from doubts over 
the suitability of analytical teChniques to evaluate alternative 
designs. 
Other factors which can interact with these principal 
features and significantly influence deformation include weather, 
mining activity and also time and deformation themselves. 
Variation in rainfall can influence the groundwater regime, 
promote increased motivating forces and contribute to physical 
and chemical weathering to weaken component materials and their 
discontinuities within slopes. The management of drainage on 
and near exposed slopes is important to reduce the ingress of 
water into slopes and minimize any contribution pf this water 
source to such processes. Low temperatures can induce ground 
dilation by frost heave or more permanent deformation by 
contributing to physical weathering and even impair groundwater 
flow by the freezing of groundwater seepage areas. Influential 
- 4 -
mining activity can comprise the actual sequence in which the 
slope is created. Some flexibility may be available in the 
adoption of a mining strategy so as to maintain a geometry to 
adequateiy limit deformation whilst creating the slope design. 
Blasting may be required within the mine to enhance the 
diggability of some rock units. This may give rise to adverse 
dynamic loading ip a slope and reduce the strength of its 
discontinuous rock mass. The existence of shallow or deep 
underground coal workings within or below the slope may have 
reduced the strength of the rock mass by inducing void migration, 
providing persistent subsidence fractures and affecting strata 
dips as well as influencing the characteristics of the ground-
water regime. The mining role of the slope will also govern its 
exposure duration. Internal slopes are of short life, generally 
up to 6 months, whilst external slopes, which comprise the main 
mine boundary slopes may be required to stand for several years 
dependent upon the scale of the operation. The life will govern 
the chances of the slope being influenced significantly by any 
of these factors under discussion. The scale, importance and 
life of the slope will also determine the extent of investigations 
and analysis invested in its design. The need arises, therefore, 
to consider both short-term and long-term slopes, defined by a 
working life below or above 6 months in duration. Some slope 
materials components and their discontinuities may reduce 
appreciably in strength with the duration of loading to a 
residual value, which may be of more realistic use in designing 
long-term slopes. Ground deformation itself, possibly at first 
due simply to rebound, can give rise to a progressive weakening 
of slope materials and their discontinuities. This strain-
- 5 -
softening characteristic can give rise to progressive development 
of further deformation into and along the affected slope. 
The mine geotechnical environment, principally controlled 
by geometry, structure, petrology and groundwater but also influenced 
by a wide range of supplementary factors is therefore complex and 
defies the scientific analysis for the prediction of ground 
deformation. Deformation up to a limiting value is tolerable, 
beyond which it becomes gross and represents intolerable hazard. 
The necessity to predict such behaviour is twofold. Firstly, 
on both external and internal mine slopes, as well as around 
peripheral dumped slopes, gross deformation can place at risk 
the safety of men and equipment. It can also incur extra costs 
in the undertaking of remedial measures, interfere with continuity 
of production and even result in depletion of recoverable reserves. 
As deformation reaches an intolerable limiting value the affected 
area may then be considered to be unstable. This "instability", 
evident by features such as the growth of delineating tension 
cracks, toe heave, dilation of joints and lipping along faults 
or bedding planes, must then be considered to be an imminent 
"failure" or "slide". As deformation progresses then access to 
the instability is reduced. It is at this stage, if not earlier, 
that some form of monitoring must .e implemented and the adoption 
of remedial, counteractive measures taken. Risk to men and plant 
at this stage may not be 'considered to be significant. As 
defo~ation continues, most probably accelerating, the 
instability develops into a failure, whereby the loss of all 
prospect of controlling deformation immediate to the affected 
area must be considered. The passage of time during the 
- 6 -
transition from instability to failure will largely govern the 
risk to personnel and plant. As a general observation the larger 
the depth of the affected volume then the longer is this time 
period, so safety can generally be ensured by satisfactory 
monitoring. Small, violent failures present greatest risk to 
personnel, e.g. minor rockfall, but these hazards can be 
effectively minimized by good housekeeping and conventional 
safe~y benChing. After the 'p' pavement failure at the Westfield 
mine in 1974 (see Chapter 2), which resulted in one fatality, 
the N.C.B. Opencast Executive instituted the post of Regional 
Geotechnical Engineer, whose principal area of concern is slope 
stability. This reflected the growing need for specialist 
personnel as both mining depths and the need to consider the 
impact of instability on areas outside the mine boundary increased. 
This latter need is the second major reason for the prediction of 
ground behaviour. 
Outside the mine boundary ground deformation could arise 
linked to the deformation of an external mine slope or a 
peripheral spoil dump. The limiting magnitude of tolerable 
deformation, however, may be far less than that defining a 
slope instability threatening the internal mine area. The 
nature of the British surface coal mining industry is such 
that many mines are set within close proximity to important 
features such,as housing and industrial developments, transport 
routes, bodies of water, and gas, water and electrical supply 
lines. Limiting ground deformation affecting the serious 
disruption of any such facilities is seldom defined, but 
nevertheless most critical. The impact of such deformation 
- 7 -
should also be minimized, simply as part of responsible management 
in times of growing environmental consciousness. From 1958 to 
1969 only 8 Public Inquiries affected proposed British surface 
coal mines. From 1969 to 1978, however, 32 Inquiries were held 
and 19 of these occurred in the latter three years of the period. 
This demonstrates the growing call for environmental protection, 
which involves ground deformation as one area of concern. 
Geotechnical design contributes to mine environmental planning 
and cannot afford to disregard external mine boundary zones in 
the prevailing climate of public environmental awareness. 
In 1976 the N.C.B. Opencast Executive initiated a series 
of.slope stability research projects to be undertaken by the 
Mining Engineering Department of Nottingham University under 
the supervision of the author and Dr. B. N. Whittaker. This 
thesis contains the results of various investigations into 
ground deformation which were undertaken by the author himself, 
in the role of researcher-supervisor. Other theses s.o far 
emanating from these projects have been produced by Young (1979), 
Rao (1980) and Rassani (1981). The various projects have been 
a~d to present an integrated approach to slope stability 
studies through combined field mapping and monitoring, laboratory 
and field materials testing, and modelling projects. 
There is one fundamental problem which hinders the prediction 
of the ground behaviour which may occur subsequent to excavation. 
This problem is that the factors which influence deformation are 
diverse, numerous and often interactive, as outlined previously. 
For this reason the analysis of both the contributory factors 
and the related mechanisms underlying deformation is complex and 
- 8 -
often hindered by a basic lack of quantitative data. The data 
requirement for adequate analysis is poorly-defined and the 
problem is further compounded by the practical difficulties of 
securing reliable, quantitative data to define the actual slope 
environment from borehole core and exposed slopes. Detailed 
case data on actual slope deformation by monitoring was until 
recently very sparse. The unavoidably subjective nature of the 
analysis of deformation that thus often results has prevented 
the development of adequate simulation techniques to aid design 
and back-analysis. Doubt exists over the suitability of existing 
analytical techniques for the assessment of ground behaviour. 
This arises principally from the lack of understanding of 
deformation mechanisms and the control exerted principally by 
structure, materials strength characteristics, groundwater and 
time. The development of appropriate simulation techniques can 
only be based upon the experience provided by data gained from 
the field monitoring of slope deformation and groundwater in a 
number of representative slope environments, clearly defined by 
mapping and materials testing. This will require systematic and 
integrated studies by techniques which must themselves be subject 
to development. 
This thesis aims to contribute towards the clearer definition 
of ground deformation mechanisms and contributory factors. It 
attempts wherever possible to report and analyse such features on 
a quantitative basis, with minimal subjectivity, and identify 
those features which require further attention. The suitability 
of data collection techniques is considered in the light of field 
experience with instability mapping and slope monitoring. 
- 9 -
The thesis initially presents in Chapter 1, a definition of 
the geotechnical and mining environment prevailing in U.K. surface 
coal mines and then establishes the problems associated with the 
analysis of slope deformation by simulatiQn techniques. The 
analysis of a detailed survey of various types of instability which 
affected mine slopes nationally during recent years is then 
reported in Chapter 2. The opportunity is also taken to outline 
a recommended procedure for the mapping and reporting of such 
instability cases. A detailed analysis of all instability cases 
associated with one mine during its complete producing life then 
follows in Chapter 3. This case study is not presented as being 
representative of all U.K. mine environments, but it provides more 
complete supporting data to analyse deformation modes and contributory 
factors as well as an unbiased view of the range and severity of 
instability hazards that can beset a mining operation. Slope 
monitoring features prominently in the thesis. Three detailed 
case studies are reported from a range of geotechnical and mining 
environments. Chapter 3 includes the analysis of a large instability) 
monitored on one of a mine's high external slopes, which < 
threatened the security of the internal and site boundary areas. ) 
The 10ng-teDD behaviour of the slopes in a deep void, as monitored ) 
over a 400 day period, is reported in Chapter 4. During this 'J 
period a sequence of instability events occurred which were 
principally influenced by groundwater and resulted in the eventual 
backfilling of the void. Chapter 5 finally records the ground 
deformation arising over a 600 day period from a sequence of 
shallow dragline cuts through a body of ground containing old 
underground workings. This monitoring project was aimed at 
defining the range and scale of deformation in the crest area 
- 10 -
of such a mining operation. It reflects the growing desire by 
the N.C.B. to quantify ground behaviour in order to aid mine 
design in ensuring the security of not only the internal mine 
working area, but also its external boundary zone. The 
opportunity is taken within these Chapters to critically assess 
the performance and suitability of the various monitoring 
techniques adopted. Slope monitoring is continuing in a range 
of settings and is aimed to reinforce the experience reported 
herein and by others (Young (1979), Rao (1980, in order to 
place mine slope design on a more scientific foundation.

CHAPTER 1 
THE ANALYSIS OF GROUND BEHAVIOUR IN BRITISH 
COAL MINE SLOPES 
This Chapter aims to identify the particular problems 
which affect the definition of a slope environment and the 
prediction of its behaviour upon exposure. Reference has 
already been made to the complex array of factors which can 
motivate and control slope deformation. This leads to 
difficulty in defining with confidence the complete slope 
setting and is compounded by doubts over therelevance of some 
data to slope analysis. The Chapter concludes by considering 
the requirements and effectiveness of various simulation 
methods in the analysis of stability. Occasional reference 
will be made to those specific case histories of instability 
which appear in later Chapters. Each such case history is 
identified by its own unique three-digit code. 
1.1: Geotechnical Definition of Slopes 
A coal mine slope comprises a discontinuous rock mass of 
many contrasting sedimentary units which is often overlain by 
appreciable superficials cover. The different petrological 
components can vary markedly in their physical, mechanical 
and structural characteristics. Their inherent strength and 
hydrological properties combine to produce a complex structure 
which is inhomogeneous and anisotropic. Igneous and metamorphic 
rock typ.s are unusual in British coal mine slopes. The rock 
mass is often further complicated by faulting and folding. 
- 12 -
Three major inherent features require prominent attention in 
the definition of a slope since they exert critical control 
over deformation. These are materials strength, structural 
geology and groundwater. They are considered in more detail 
with reference to specific cases of instability in later 
Chapters. Their characteristics in a slope will govern the 
deformation meChanism and consequently the selection of the 
appropriate simulation method. The effectiveness of the slope 
definition will thus directly control the quality of any slope 
analysis, used either for purposes of deformation prediction or 
baCk-analysis. 
1.1.1: Strength Properties of Geological Components 
Significant thicknesses of superficials may overlie the 
slope rockhead and comprise top-soil, sub-soil, peat and drift 
(glacial and alluvial) . The strength characteristics of such 
materials has received much attention in soil mechanics. Their 
low strength and susceptibility to further weakening by water, 
however, means that their extent and characteristics must be 
considered in the upper section of a mine slope, where slope 
angles may be required to be as low as 1 in 3 with routine 
use of roCkhead safety benches. Chapter 5 relates the key 
role played by boulder clay cover in the transmission of the 
deformation which was monitored in proximity to shallow drag-
line mining. In Northern England and Scotland the thicknesses 
of peat and glacial drift are generally greatest. In ~ny, 
shallow mines with thiCk superficials cover then the s~ability 
of such materials can dominate geotechnical considerations in 
- 13 -
slope design. In weak superficials, regardless of the slope 
depth, the deformation rear of the slope crest is likely to be 
influenced by the characteristics of such cover. 
It is essential in slope definition to identify weak rock 
components within which shear failure may propagate. These may 
be considered in two classes. The most important class, related 
to structural features, comprises persistent bedding, joint and 
fault planes whose strength may be inadequate to resist 
translational shear forces acting along their surfaces. The 
low shear strength of such features, so critical to stability, 
derives either from their low surface roughness, particularly 
in argillaceous rocks, or the inclusion of a low strength/high 
plasticity layer between their surfaces. This clay-rich infill 
may have been generated by prior shear movement. It may also 
contain pre-existing, polished and slickensided surfaces derived 
similarly from prior shear. Such low strength intraformational 
shears have been reported as "Clay Mylonites" , "Bedding Plane 
Shears", "Flexural Slip Shears" and "Intraformational Shears", 
Rao (1980). The low strength and thickness of such zones reduces 
significantly the probability of their recovery and identification 
in borehole core. The procurement of strength test data from 
core or slope exposure samples is similarly hindered. Where 
recent or penecontemporaneous weathering and movement have 
affected argillaceous rocks these can adopt weakened characteristics 
with contained intraformational shears, with thicknesses up to 
5 m, e.g. case 316. These zones propagate,slope instability 
which is primarily delineated by the structures to which they 
conform, i.e. planar or bi-planar failure - the commonest form 
of deformation (Chapter 2). Such deformation occurs along bedding 
- 14 -
planes (plates 2.1, 2.2, 2.20 and 3.8), roCk-seatearth or rock-
clay interfaces (Plates 2.10 and 3.27), and intraformational 
shears (Plates 3.3, 3.21 and 3.22). Laboratory direct shear 
strength data derived and compiled by Rao (1980) indicates that 
Coal Measures intraformational shears lie in the strength range 
C' 0-25 kN/m2 ~'6-l6. He also conducted mudstone-clay 
r ' r 
and siltstone-clay interface shear tests which gave a strength 
range of Cp 0-96 kN/m
, ~p 17-300  These were compared with 
a strength range of tested saw-cut mudstone joints of C 23 kN/m2, 
~ 24-270  Hassani (1981) reported a strength range for natural 
Coal Measure mudstone joints of C 0-46 kN/m2, ~ 22-390  Weak 
zones, pre-sheared by ancient movement, have strengths approaching 
the residual value. Those which have not been pre-sheared appear 
stronger but with peak strength values less than those of intact 
rock. Chapter 2 considers the role of stronger Coal Measures 
rock components, i.e. sandstones and siltstones, as reinforcement 
within slopes. Instability cases 209, 401, 402, 403 and 404 
indicate that such components can limit the height of penetration 
of any overlying failure zones. The feature of reinforcement, 
however, is difficult to assess since other factors such as 
groundwater and structure also exert a critical influence on 
stability. It can only be said that no instability cases have 
been encountered in slopes dominated by sandstone and siltstone 
without the adverse influence of weak zones, with the exception 
of minor wedge, toppling or rockfall incidents controlled by -
structure. 
The second class of weak s~ope component comprises units of 
weak argillaceous rock with low intact strength, often weakened 
further by softening from weathering as well as intense non-
- 15 -
systematic, smooth jointing. Evidence indicates that provided 
slopes of at least 20 m height are composed of such materials, 
with no reinforcement from stronger, more arenaceous beds with 
systematic joints of low intensity, then a characteristic multi-
planar instability can develop. Such instability is observed 
to exhibit a quasi-circular rotational deformation mechanism 
with no apparent dominant delineating structures, i.e. bedding 
planes, faults (see cases 248, 249, 401, 402, 403, 404, and 
Section 2.4.4). Ladanyi and Archambault (1970) reported model 
and theoretical studies to derive the shear strength of such 
closely jointed rock masses. The indications of such work were 
that shear planes, shear zones or kink bands can develop through 
such rock masses and that the shear strength of such failure 
surfaces can approach the residual strength of smooth surfaces 
in the rock type. This mechanism is receiving further study 
but demonstrates the value of having shear strength test data 
for smooth surfaces, as, well as intact rock,to aid slope design 
in such environments. Hassani (198l) reported the range of 
Coal Measure mudstone strengths as follows: compressive strength 
--- 5-45 MN/m2, tensile strength --- 0-4 MN/m2, triaxial 
strength --- shear strength 7-13 MN/m , internal angle of 
friction 30-33. Mudrocks in particular are prone to significant 
strength reduction with increase in water content and weathering 
(Hassani (198l)) and this presents problems in field sampling, 
protection and testing. Mudrocks, defined as containing less 
than 40% quartz (Spears (1980, comprise mudstones, shales, 
claystones and underclay seatearths. A need exists to develop 
a suitable field index testing technique sufficiently simple and 
sensitive to evaluate more precisely the variation in mudrock 
- 16 -
strength in surface mines. This should enable a more quantitative 
study of the control of deformation in argillaceous rocks and 
supplement point load testing (Dassani, Scoble and Whittaker 
(1980  
1.1.2: Structural Geology 
Coal Measure slopes are discontinuous rock masses defined 
structurally by bedding (including localised sedimentary structures 
such as cross bedding, washouts, slumping and convolute bedding), 
jointing and faulting. Structure can influence ground behaviour 
significantly, see Chapter 2, by provision of the following: 
- adverse strata dips -into mine excavations. 
- weak zones genetically related to structure, i.e. intraformational 
shears derived from faulting/folding activity. 
- adverse roCkhead dips into mine excavations. 
- joint or fault planes on which shear failure can occur, dependent 
upon their relative orientation-and location with respect to 
the slope face. 
- release or low tensile strength planes which serve to delineate 
the height, depth and length of instability volumes; these may 
be composite planes of joint surfaces and intact tensile fractures 
or persistent fault planes. They are critical in defining all 
instability based on planar shear features as well as smaller 
scale toppling and rockfall instabilities. 
- closely jointed weak rock components, see 2.1.1. 
- control over groundwater movement and hydraulic continuity 
between aquifers, see 2.1.3. 
- 17 -
Strata dips in British surface mines are normally below 80 
although in coalfield areas with more active tectonic history, 
principally areas of S. Wales and Scotland, this value can be 
exceeded and even approach 900  Two, sometimes three, joint 
sets are present and predominantly inclined at within 200 of 
the vertical. Regional trends are identifiable within coalfields 
(Cobb (1981. The brittle sandstones and siltstones exhibit 
systematic, planar jointing, defining block sizes up to as large 
as 30 cu m. Ductile argillaceous units tend to contain sytematic, 
planar joints, not necessarily more closely-spaced than in 
arenaceous rocks. They comprise, however, much smaller block 
sizes delineated by more intense non-systematic, planar and curved 
joints. These may correspond to "cross joints", (Price (1966. 
The susceptibility of argillaceous units to weathering as well as 
tbe influence of any blasting on adjacent ground dilation can 
hinder the identification of their systematic joint sets. Joint 
orientation and intensity is more difficult to identify in core 
logging where core orientation is often not feasible (see case 
247) and hole inclination is often subparallel to joint dips. 
R.Q.D. and joint frequency data from core logging can give an 
indication of relative strength of rock units. Such parameters, 
however, cannot be assumed to be entirely derived from jointing, 
since they are also influenced by bedding, mudrock fissility and 
fractures generated during drilling, transport and storage. In 
traditional open-pit slope stability analysis much emphasis is 
given to joint mapping, due to the provision by joints of 
surfaces to promote tetrahedral wedge failure, toppling and 
rockfall, (Hoek and Bray (1977), Goodman (1976. Emphasis is 
placed on joint orientation and persistence. Such mechanisms 
- 18 -
also operate in British Coal Measures slopes but do not so 
directly control the larger cases of instability, i.e. planar 
or bi-planar cases. This derives mainly from the comparitive 
absence of "master joints" (Price, (1966 in Coal Measures 
slopes and the dominant role played by the more prevalent 
bedding and faulting. The intensity of jointing appears to 
be an equally important feature in addition to orientation 
and persistence. This governs the overall strength and permeability 
of rock units, as well as the extent of void migration over old 
underground workings 
Coal Measure faults are often difficult to define within 
exploratory drill core and are often characterised from strata 
displacement data gained from boreholes. The commonest faults 
are steeply-dipping and hence difficult to intersect with 
vertical holes on the conventional exploration borehole spacing 
of 20 to 30 m. They cannot always be assumed to cause localised 
strata steepenins. Apparently minor faults with throws of 5 m or 
less can however cause adverse strata steepening in a monocline 
manner, which can be more adverse to stability than a more 
localised and disruptive strata displacement. Identification 
and sampling of clay-riCh fault gouge from drill core is also 
difficult. Prediction of the local disruptive effects of faults 
on both the sense and magnitude of strata displacements and 
gradients is at present based on little scientific technique and 
predominantly on local experience and intuition. Effective 
prediction is critical towoid slope instability as witnessed 
by the case studies in Chapter 2. Contrast Plate 1.1 where mine 
slope plan orientation with respect to faulting minimised

- 19 -
the influence of faulting, with Plate 3.26 where adverse slope 
orientation heightened the stability problems arising from 
faulting and an associated weak basal shear zone (case number 
317 and 318). Reverse and low-angle thrust faults are less 
common, but the latter are critical through their capability 
of defining large highwall wedges underlain by adversely 
intersecting fault planes. 
1.1.3: Groundwater 
various back-analyses undertaken on cases of instability in 
Chapters 3, 4 and 5 indicate the significant effect that assumed 
groundwater pressures can have on such calculations. Only over 
the last four years have piezometers begun to be used with any 
regularity in British mines. These are generally installed in 
external slopes prior to mining and as a result the benefits 
are largely yet to accrue from this practice. Quantitative data 
on groundwater pressures is rarely available for stability 
calculations. Piezometric data is basic to the prediction of 
both mine inflow quantity and seepage forces operative within 
slopes. The characteristics of drawdown in mine slopes, which 
comprise often complex arrays of confined or unconfined aquifers 
and aquicludes, has received little attention. Aquifers can 
comprise sandstones, siltstones and limestones whilst aquicludes 
or aquitards can comprise the argillaceous units, i.e. mudrocks, 
intraformational shear zones and fault gouge. British bituminous 
and anthracite coals are normally very pervious, in.contyast to 
lignite coals which can be very impermeable. The resultant 
perched water tables are evident from seepage horizons on exposed 
slopes, but the derivation of water pressure data from such flow 
- 20 -
features is purely subjective. There is a particular need to 
i~vestigate the range of water pressures that are actually 
operative on the basal failure planes of instabilities. The 
influence on slope drawdown also needs careful investigation. 
Groundwater can affect stability by reducing the effective 
stress acting on shear surfaces, increasing driving forces 
through hydrostatic pressures in tension cracks and weakening 
rock and joint strengths by physical and chemical weathering 
(prior and subsequent to failure). Mine floor heave due to 
groundwater pressure can be acute and lead to instability 
hazards in more recent, soft coal deposits, in which pre-
drainage of overburden has become established practice (Brealey 
(1965), Gloe et al (1971. The problems arising from the 
connection of superficial and confined slope aquifers to surface 
water sources is discussed with respect to a monitored slope 
in Chapter 4. The hydraulic, continuity provided across aquicludes 
by subsidence fractures above old underground workings is also 
a critical feature discussed, which can affect the drawdown of 
lower, perched water tables in slopes. Daughton, Noake and 
Siddle (1977) considered the influence of such underground 
workings on modifications to the Coal Measures hydrogeology 
of the S. Wales valleys. They emphasised the anisotropic 
nature of aquifers, where preferential groundwater movement 
vectors are controlled strongly by intensity, orientation and 
permeability of rock discontinuities as. affected by underground 
workings. 
- 21 -
Inundation and stability hazards to surface mines may arise 
in the proximity of slopes to old,flooded underground workings. 
This risk requires careful systematic study by exploratory bore-
holes and piezometers in order to realistically design barrier 
or stand-off distances for slopes. Similar hazards arise in 
the proximity to old, backfilled surface mine voids, as discussed 
in Chapter 4. Instability case 210 (Chapter 2) is another 
related example of the possible contribution to instability of 
groundwater, transmitted via old underground workings to affected 
slopes from old backfilled voids. Unsealed boreholes may also 
contribute to hydraulic connection between aquifers. 
Hydrostatic driving forces in slope areas of extension, 
i.e. tension cracks, can significantly affect stability. In 
many cases of instability, heavy rainfall is seen to correlate 
with the onset of gross slope deformation, see Chapters 2, 3 
and 4. Such precipitation and any associated increase in 
neighbouring river flows can contribute to increased ground-
water uplift forces on failure planes. The high incidence of 
rivers or river diversion courses close to British mines makes 
this often of prime concern. Precipitation can have a less 
delayed effect through the direct flooding of tension cracks. 
Benches should be kept clear of scree where accessible in order 
to identify cracking early. Common practice is to clay-fill 
tension cracks on their appearance. The management of drainage 
by ditches on slope boundaries an~ benches is important to 
prevent ingress of surface water into the slope. These should 
be based on an impermeable lining. There is evidence to suggest 
that tension cracks associated with instability are often 
-22 -
located conncident with such ditches, to the rear of slope 
crests (see Chapter 2 and Section 3.5). There is reason to 
investigate in the future the effects of such drainage 
excavations on the delineation of tension cracks or growth 
of instability. Further attention is also justified to define 
the influence of the placement of a backfill buttress on slope 
drawdown characteristics. This may present an impermeable 
cover to the slope and block any old underground workings 
which were effective drainage adits. Following the detailed 
surface and sub-surface monitoring of a prototype U.S. surface 
coal mine highwall, Miller and Hilts (1969) interestingly 
concluded that slope benches could be detrimental to stability 
by serving as collection points for surface water which might 
infiltrate into joints and cracks. They considered that the 
alternative flow of precipitation drainage down a continuous 
slope face, although promoting some erosion, was preferable 
to allowing water to accumulate on benches. Forming a highwall 
slope at a required inclination without benching would be 
difficult. Benches also serve an important role as a means of 
reducing risks from rockfall. Monitoring of precipitation and 
river flow levels is important to facilitate slope definition 
and also to anticipate ground behaviour in existing slopes, 
see Chapter 4. A recommended classification of precipitation 
intensity for such monitoring and reporting is discussed in 
Section 2.2.4.

1.2: Application of Simulation Methods 
Analysis of slope stability by use of a simulation computer 
program may be employed either for predicting ground behaviour 
or back-analysis of an actual instability. When used in either 
role the simulation must be an accurate representation of the 
actual mechanisms operative in the deformation. Analytical 
methods have been well developed in soils and hard rocks for 
civil engineering and open-pit mining design but the surface 
coal mine environment has to date received little attention. 
This environment often involves far more inhomogeneity and 
anisotropy with resultant complexity in deformation processes. 
The study of Coal Measures slope materials and structural 
strength combines many aspects of both soil and rock mechanics. 
The deformation processes and their controlling factors are 
the main consideration of this thesis. This section now aims 
to discuss the characteristics of observed instability cases 
reported in later Chapters since they determine the requirements 
of an effective simulation technique. A range of deformation 
modes exist, see Chapte~ 2; each tends to merit adaptations of 
various simulation methods. The author has written a number 
of Basic mini-computer simulation programs based on the following 
conventional two-dimensional limit equilibrium methods:-
- the Ordinary Method of Slices (Fe11enius Method) for circular 
failure surfaces (Fe1lenius (1936. 
- the Bishop Simplified Method of Slices for circular failure 
surfaces (Bishop (1955. 
- the Janbu Generalised Method of Slices for failure surfaces 
of arbitrary shape (Janbu (1973. 
- 24 -
- the Planar Method (Roek and Bray (1977 for planar failure 
surfaces. 
- the Bi-Planar or Wedge Method for a composite failure surface 
of two planes (Morgenstern (1968. 
A suite of three-dimensional Block Stability analysis programs 
have also been developed, based on vector geometry and the limit 
equilibrium concept. 
These programs have been used to conduct back-analyses of 
various instability cases subsequently discussed in Chapters 3, 
4 and 5. Detailed discussion of these methods is beyond the 
scope of this work. Critical comparison of their capabilities 
has been conducted by many workers including Whitman and 
Bailey (1967), Hoek and Bray (1977), Goodman (1976) :and 
Chowdhury (1978). The need arises, as experience grows from 
field and laboratory studies, to further develop such techniques 
to provide realistic simulation with minimal simplfications 
and generalisations. The following sections therefore consider 
those partic~lar requirements which are considered to govern 
the future evolution of analytical techniques for Coal Measures 
slope analysis. 
1.J.l: Materials Strength Representation 
The materials strength characteristics for slope analysis 
is conventionally derived from laboratory testing. No in-situ 
shear strength testing has yet been undertaken in British Coal 
Measures slopes. Careful back-analysis of actual slope 
instability cases offers the validation of laboratory strength 
- 25 -
data. Skempton (1964) highlighted the discrepancy encounter~d 
between laboratory and back-analysis data during clay slope 
instability analysis. In Coal Measures slopes to date, the 
lack of effective definition of structure, groundwater and other 
slope features operative in instability cases, has prevented any 
realistic assessment of laboratory data through back-analysis. 
This must be facilitated in future by clearer definition of slope 
environment, as discussed in Section 1.1. Materials strength 
data for Coal Measures slope analysis is particularly required 
for soils, closely jointed rock and also filled and unfilled 
rock discontinuities. This data must include assessment of the 
effects of weathering and anisotropy on shear strength. Coal 
Measures rock and joint strengths have been tested by Hassani 
(l~el) as part of a continuing research programme on behalf of 
the N.C.B. Opencast Executive. The conventional representation 
of shear strength is by the Mohr-Coulomb theory which relates 
the shear strength or shear stress, S, on the failure plane to 
the normal stress at failure, a, on the failure plane by means 
of the unit cohesion, C, and the angle of shearing resistance, 
41, as follows: 
S - C + atan41  
~is equation can be modified to account for the principle 
of effective stress, as follows: 
S  C' + a'tan' 
where cr' (. cr - u) is the effective normal stress on the failure 
plane, when the pore water pressure is. u. The Coulomb concept 
of cohesion and friction angle is only a means of mathematical 
- 26 -
sfmplification in representing shear strength. T~is convention 
is currently used in simulation techniques for Coal Measures 
slope analysis, and has been employed in the back-analyses in 
subsequent Chapters for this reason only. Laboratory studies 
have shown that the peak shear strength envelopes for Coal 
Measures rocks and their discontinuities, however, are non-
linear, concave downwards. Hassani (1981) proposed Power Law 
relationships between normal stress and ~hear 
strength for Coal Measures rocks and their discontinuities. 
This representation of strength should be given future consideration 
as it eliminates the possible overestimation of shear strength 
with reduced normal stress inherent in the use of the cohesion 
concept. BaCk-analysis reported in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 indicate 
the significant effect that sucn cohesion has in the calculation 
of factors of safety by limit equilibrium techniques. In order 
to accommodate the variation of shear strength along a slope 
failure plane derived from variation in normal stress the 
adopted simulation teChnique must incorporate some system :for 
subdividin~ the area of the failure plane. similar to the 
established two-dimensional methods employin~ slices. Extrapolating 
laboratory test data up to or beyond the normal stress range 
used in testing must be conducted with caution. 
Simulation methods need to develop the ability to represent 
the shear resistance offered by any combination of the following -
intact roCk, rock discontinuit~es (with a range of possible 
roughness and infill) and intraformational shear zones. Effective 
analysis entails an accurate assessment or prediction of the 
contribution of any of these features to the shear strength of 
a failure plane. Rock, discontinuities and overconsolidated 
- 27 -
clays all exhibit strain-softening Characteristics. Pre-existing 
shear planes in weak Coal Measures units may exhibit a shear 
strength at or close to the residual value (Rao (1980. Currently 
with conventional limit-equilibrium techniques the choice of 
using either peak or residual shear strength parameters is 
available to the analyst and may be used to derive upper and 
lower bound estimates of stability. The effects of surface 
roughness on Coal Measures d~scontinuity shear strength have 
been clearly demonstrated by Hassani (1981). Further work yet 
remains to fully define an effective empirical relationship 
between roughness and shear strength for the full range of 
Coal Measures rock discontinuities. Comparitively little work 
has been done on the strength of roCk-clay interfaces and the 
controlling influence of surface roughness and water. 
the prediction or field estimation of continuity of intact 
rock bridges on a failure plane is most conjectural. Intact 
rock breakage has been observed to contribute reinforcement to 
Coal Measures instability cases mainly on backs car and sidescar 
features delineating failure masses. The practical inability. 
of "digging-out" failure masses has meant that the contribution 
to basal failure planes has not effectively been observed. the 
tensile and shear strength of intact rock may in these circumstances 
contribute to the overall forces resistive to deformation. the 
displacements necessary on such planes to develop full peak shear 
strength for the rock and for the rock discontinuities differ 
appreciably. At tne displacement at which the rock peak shear 
strength is generated the discontinuities will develop strengths 
below their peak values to a degree controlled by their surface 
- 28 -
roughness. The deformational behaviour under sucn circumstances 
will thus be governed initially by the intact rock. Any 
significant increase of stress to the peak value of such intact 
bridges wi-th time could conceivably result in sudden, unanticipated 
deformation. The further development of deformation would then 
be fully controlled by discontinuity strength which conceivably 
could stabilize the slope. Alternatively a sudden catastrophic 
failure CQuid ensue. This raises the need to consider the influence 
of displacement in the analysis of Coal Measures rock slope 
deformation. Conventional limit-equilibrium analysis methods 
are founded on consideration of stresses acting on an assumed 
failure surface along its complete length, at the point of 
incipient failure. 
Coal Measures slope catastrophic failure does not appear to 
develop abruptly, with the exception of pavement slab slides 
and small rockfall, wedge and toppling failures. It is not 
apparent that shear failure in most cases of instability occurs 
simultaneously along entire failure surfaces. Examples of such 
progressive failure, either lateral or longitudina~, are given 
in the case studies of subsequent Chapters. Tension cracks have 
been observed to propagate into or along the slope from the 
affected area in a retrogressive manner. Their formation is 
often witnessed to be preceded by joint and bedding dilation, 
couloir development and rockfall on the instability face. 
Progressive faiiure analytical models appear to be necessary in 
order to incorporate the strain-softening characteristics of 
both rocks, soils and their discontinuities. Research is 
continuing on the laboratory testing of such characteristics 
- 29 -
as well as the development of a suitable simulation method to 
consider progressive failure and the underlying displacement 
history. 
Rao (1980) developed a simple progressive failure model 
for Coal Measures slopes to simulate rigid block progressive 
failure on a basal shear plane with strain-softening characteristics. 
This model requires further refinement to accommodate more complex 
slope profiles and the clarification of appropriate values for 
elastic moduli. input data. It provides a prediction of rebound 
displacements rearward from a slope face. Its continued 
development requires support from the precise monitoring of 
actual slope behaviour to provide the displacement characteristics 
of slopes, following their excavation. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 
contain detailed reports of slope monitoring studies undertaken 
at three British surface mines. Data from these and future 
monitoring projects should provide the basic experience on which 
to assess progressive failure model development. 
Slope environments may change significantly with time under 
the influence of changes in groundwater regime, weathering 
processes and min~ng activity in their proximity. Long-term 
stability assessment of external slopes can best account for 
this likelihood at present by conducting sensitivity analyses 
with a range of groundwater pressure dis~ributions and materials 
strengths. Little research has been conducted into the creep 
characteristics of discontinuities and intraformational shear 
zones, where creep strain would be anticipated to concentrate. 
Amadei and Curran (1980) after conducting some time-dependent 
direct shear joint tests in machined, sedimentary rock joints 
- 30 -
concurred with the finding of Dieterich (1972) that the static 
coefficient of friction increases with the logarithm of the 
duration of loading. They emphasised that the peak shear strength 
increases with time as a result and thus competes with the related 
creep deformation in governing the likelihood of failure with 
t~. Much work yet remains to be done before the time to failure 
of discontinuous rock masses due to creep can be predicted. Long-
term stability assessment until then is best undertaken by 
employing sensitivity analyses, higher safety factor ~equirements 
and considerations of progressive failure. 
ResearCh into the effects on slope deformation of mine 
blasting practice is sparse. Taylor (1979) related the likely 
influence of blast waves to the more superficial of failures. 
Case 247 indicates, however, that blasting may contribute to 
failures which although superficial, i.e. with low depth of 
penetration into a slope, may nevertheless present significant 
stability hazards. 
1.2.2: Geometrical Representation 
The distinct structural and geometrical setting of pavement 
and spoil slopes generate their own characteristic modes of 
deformation, see Chapter 2. Pavement slopes studies have been 
reported (Walton 'and Coat_s (1980); Brawner, Pentz and Sharp 
(1971 which consider various failure modes, see also Chapter 2. 
No detailed case studies have been conducted on British pavement 
slopes, however, which have adequately integrated deformation 
monitoring with investigations into materials strength, ground-
water and structural geology. The role of weak shear zones, 
- 31 -
groundwater, "cross-over" joints, strata buckling and intact rock 
breakage in pavement deformation still remains to be clarified, 
to develop reliable simulation methods. A similar observation 
can be made with regard to internal spoil slopes, see Section 3.7, 
although external tips have received full attention (Bishop (1973. 
Internal spoil slopes, however, exhibit distinct problems related 
to rock pavement characteristics, groundwater and emplacement 
techniques. The impact of loosewall instability on mine production, 
planning and viability can be significant. 
Minor rock slope modes appear to have received full attention, 
Le. toppling (}loek and Bray (1977 and rockfall (Watters (1979. 
These tend to affect most rock slopes and can present significant 
safety hazards, see Chapter 2. 
The subsequent Chapters clearly demonstrate that Coal 
Measures highwall and low wall slope instabilities are seldom 
symmetrical in plan or section. They also comprise one or two 
rigid blocks which may through differential deformation produce 
graben structures and represent the equivalents to the "active" 
and "passive" blocks in bi-planar analysis. Only at the post-
failure stage do these blocks generally degrade, under the 
influence of dilation; ingress of water and extended weathering 
to more granular groundmasses with toppling and flow deformation 
becoming predominant. This is well demonstrated in the southern 
highwall instability history, documented in Chapter 4. Rigid 
body stability analysis appears therefore to be appropriate for 
studying all but late post-failure deformation. 
- 32 -
Basal failure planes are frequently confined to single weak 
horizons but these often show variation in gradient, which may 
be induced by faulting or folding. The conventional two-dimensional, 
limit equilibrium, planar failure analysis, Hoek and Bray (1977), 
does not simulate such features adequately, particularly if 
strata steepening is localised, see Figure l.la. The irregular 
base entails that the failure mass must be subdivided into blocks 
or slices according to changes in base inclination. The analytical 
method must then account for inter-block or inter-slice forces 
in any such two-dimensional resolution of disturbing and resistive 
forces. Two alternative forms of two-dimensional limit equilibrium 
simulation are applicable to irregular base analysis, see Figure 
l.lb. The first form of simulation of an arbitrarily-shaped mass, 
with any distribution of strength values and water pressures, is 
based on a subdivision of the mass into vertical slices. Two. 
versions have found popular application - the Janbu and Morgenstern-
Price Methods, (Janbu (1973), Morgenstern and Price (1965). The 
second form of simulation involves subdividing the failure mass 
into two or more blocks - the bi-planar (tri-planar) wedge method. 
These two forms of s~lation also have the added benefit of 
accounting for shear failure occurring on any inclined backscar 
structure, which in more simplified planar models must be assumed 
to represent a deep tension crack. Figure l.le shows a cross-
section of the structural setting of an actual projected mine 
slope in a northern N.C.B. area. It demonstrates the problem posed 
by dip variation in predicting slope stability. In this particular 
example the main decision hinged on whether stability of the brQok 
at surface could be assurred with a 15 m stand-off and a 1 in 1 
or 1 in 2 batter, or whether the seams had to be worked to the

Asymmetry is also frequently evident in plan view when 
the growth of instability is governed by persistent structures 
such as jointing or faulting. These structurally-defined 
backscar and sidescar features are invariably easier to define 
in the field than the basal failure surfaces below unstable 
masses. The delineating back and side features are not in 
reality "no-tension" planes. They contribute resistive force 
components derived from the tensile strength of intact rock 
bridges, or the shear strength of intact rock and discontinuities 
if kinematics dictate that deformation has a shear component on 
their surfaces. The ideal s~lation should account for the 
additional rock mass strength from these delineating planes. 
If this is ignored then the shear strength of the basal failure 
plane is overesttm&ted by back-analysis. The direction of movement 
of such three-dimensional rigid bodies in Coal Measures slopes 
is governed by the geometry of both the basal and side planes. 
The side planes may not exhibit the same strength characteristics. 
The instability cases 205, 206 and 309 reported later, for example, 
show that initial gross deformation arose via differential 
deformation along the side planes of the instability masses. 
This arose from shear movement being precipitated along a weak, 
fault-based side plane whilst the other side plane was less 
distinctly defin~d by breakage through intact rock bridges and 
discontinuities. It is a repeated observation in Coal Measures 
rock slopes that where weak basal shear surfaces exist in slopes, 
- 35 -
then instability is seen to arise where weak and adversely-
orientated structures exist to permit the release of instability 
masses. The plan direction of movement of such rigid bodies 
is not necessarily perpendicular to the slope crest. Block 
rotation in plan is frequently observed and is related to the 
differential resistanc~ to deformation resulting from side plane 
strength variation referred to previously. Little attention has 
been given to the possibility that in practice the groundwater 
pressure distributions on basal, side and rear delineating planes 
may not be consistent during the period preceding failure. This 
may be relevant in circumstances where aquiclude features, such 
as fault planes, as well as composite planes of intact rock and 
joints, with a potentially different secondary permeability, 
delineate the instability mass  
These end effects derived from three-dimensional variation 
in geometry as well as strengths and groundwater pressures suggests 
that two-dimensional s~ulation techniques are only an approximate 
representation of rock slope deformation mechanisms, unless the 
slopes are homogeneous with respect to materials strength, structure 
and groundwater. They also are not capable of considering slope 
curvature in plan, demonstrated in Chapter 2 to significantly 
govern rock slope stability. 
Three-dimensional limit equilibrium, finite element or 
physical modelling methods offer the integration of end effects 
into slope analysis. Several parallel cross-sections through 
the slope, however, can be used to calculate an approximate, 
average slope safety factor, weighted by section area, from 
two-dimensional limit equilibrium techniques. This practice, 
- 36 -
however, does not account for the resistive forces offered by the 
overall delineating planes. 
three-dimensional limit equilibrium simulation techniques 
have been developed using stereographic projection" (Londe et al 
(1969), John (1968 and vector geometry (Wittke (1965), Goodman 
and taylor (1967. These have been applied mainly to strong 
rock slope analysis and largely consider the production of 
tetrahedral wedge failure based on structural planes whose 
intersection line daylights adversely into the slope profile, 
see Figure 1.3. In Coal Measures slopes, however, rigid blocks 
are defined most frequently by planar basal failure surfaces. 
A suite of mini-computer programs has been developed by the 
author based on vector geometry, (Patton and Hendron (1975, 
whiCh offers the ability to consider an appropriate range of 
block shapes for Coal Measures slope analysis. see Figure 1.2. 
1.2.3: Analysis in Practice 
Two- and three-dimensional limit equilibrium techniques are 
suited to routine use by practising mine engineers due to their 
relative s~plicity and adaptability to mini-computer usage. 
These techniques do not evaluate the overall stress distribution 
in a slope, which controls deformation and the development of 
failure zones. They consider only an assumed state of incipient 
failure. Finite element modelling for the stress analysis of 
slopes in both two- and three-dimensions is receiving increasing 
attention. The practical application of this method to Coal 
Measures slopes for use as a routine design aid is limited 
currently by the comparitive complexity and expense of the method.

Its use is also bindered by a lack of scientific data on the 
range of actual displacements that develop in exposed mine slopes 
or the appropriate values for materials input parameters required 
to characterize the slope mass. The ultimate employment of such 
a method must be eventually considered as a theoretical means 
of predicting deformation, rather than failure, e.g. for 
calculatinl safe stand-off distances from external utilities. 
Data on actual slope displacement characteristics, gained from 
field monitoring, is the basic need at present. This is not only 
necessary to control the application of stress analysis techniques 
but also provides the means of developing alternative predictive 
models based on empirical relationships. It is difficult to 
eavisaga the routine use of finite element methods in general 
slope desiln in British coal mines where so many slopes require 
consideration, each with its own complex petrological and 
.tructural environment. This may not, however, be the case for 
the design of long-term, important external slopes in the future, 
where consideration of progressive failure and creep mechanisms, 
as discus.ed earlier, also becomes relevant. 
Slope stability calculations currently in use in British surface 
coal mining employ two-dimensional limit-equilibrium methods to 
derive factors of safety. The use of different simulation methods 
may live values of such factors which differ by as much as 30%, 
(Chowdhury (1978, all other parameters being constant in the 
a liven slope may also vary, dependent on the consequences of any 
instability. There is also significant uncertainty in the input 
data for analysi., i.e. materials properties, groundwater pressure 
- 39 -
distributions, structural geology, failure mechanism and those 
factors whose influence remains most conjectural - blasting, old 
workings within high slopes and initial stresses. Allowance for 
some of these uncertainties can be made in analysis by considering 
upper and lower bound cases, e.g. high and negligibl~ groundwater 
pressures or peak and residual shear strengths. Sensitivity 
analysis may be conducted whereby input parameters are varied 
in turn and their impact on factor of safety computations assessed. 
A numberof sensitivity analyses have been conducted on instability 
cases in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 by limit equilibrium methods. These 
show the wide variation of friction angle with cohesion for varying 
groundwater conditions, at critical equilibrium, that can arise 
from such analysis. In the absence of laboratory test data for 
the shear strength characteristics of their failure surfaces and 
monitored groundwater pressures it is difficult to define a narrow 
range for these parameters by back-analysis. In the prediction 
of stability where failure mechanisms and surfaces are hypothetical 
this problem is heightened.. Sensitivity analyses with varying 
strength, failure surface geometry and groundwater parameters for 
any alternative failure mechanisms can provide a profuse volume 
of data from which optimum slope geometry selection may not be 
obvious. In this situation the appropriate selection for the 
failure surface geometry and mechanism is of outstanding 
importance. This can not only be aided bv a realistic slope 
definition but also by experience from past instabilities in 
a similar setting. It is hoped that the instability survey 
data presented in Chapter 2 will contribute to such experience. 
As an alternative to determining minimum safety factors with the 
above trial parameters, the principle of a resistance envelope 
- 40 -
may be applied (Chowdhury (l978)). Either approach, however, does 
not reduce the inherent uncertainty in the input data. It should 
be noted that a major drawback of three-dimensional analysis is 
that its use significantly increases the quantity of input data 
upon which analysis is based. 
Londe (Hoek and Bray (1977) suggested making allowance for 
input data uncertainty by using different factors of safety for 
each input parameter, dependent upon its associated degree of 
confidence. Developments in prebabilistic approaches to analysis 
may in future have realistic application to Coal Measures slope 
analysisr The present priority, however, must be to reliably 
define the characteristics of such slope masses and the pertinent 
deformation mechanisms. 
1.3: Summary 
It is considered that the most appropriate development in 
Coal Measures slope analysis should be the further evolution of 
both progressive failure and three-dimensional limit-equilibrium 
techniques. This should be supported by further detailed studies 
of the following:-
- the three-dimensional progressive nature of instability cases, 
with special attention to kinematics and structural control, 
see Figure 1.3. 
- the geotechnical characteristics of the weak Coal Measures 
rocks and their discontinuities, with emphasis on their 
strain-softening behaviour. This should accompany the 
assessment of the appropriate means of materials strength 
representation in simulation.

Such studies require the continuation of laboratory strength 
testing and slope monitoring programmes. Precise slope monitoring 
should also aim to generate eventual empirical relationships to 
aid future ground behaviour prediction. The eventual aim should 
be to inte~rate the progressive failure and three-dimensional 
block concepts into an economical program suite capable of 
manipulation on fu~ure ~ini-computer systems. 
The effectiveness of any slope analytical technique is 
completely governed by the quality of the input data. This 
dictates that reliably accurate definitions of slope settings 
are paramount. Improvements. in the provision of quantity and 
quality of data on structural geology, petrology, strengths, 
groundwater, weathering and underground workings are necessary. 
This may be aided by the following:-
- greater geotechnical usage of exploration boreholes, not only 
for geotechnical core logging and testing but also for more 
routine placement of piezometers and monitoring instrumentation. 
- development of geophysical borehole logging techniques to 
derive geotechnical as well as exploration data (Elkington 
(1981. 
- further development of standardised instability reporting on a 
national basis to pool a central fund of experience derived 
from instability case histories. 
The implication of improving the slope definition process 
is the need for close liaison between mining, geotechnical and 
geological personnel.

CHAPTER 2 
A SURVEY OF INSTABILITY CASES IN BRITISH 
SURFACE COAL MINES 
2.1: Introduction 
The preceding Chapter has discussed the problems involved 
in the analysis of slope stability in Coal Measures mine slopes. 
The need has existed to document the available data on past 
instability cases in such an environment in order to consolidate 
on ~his experience and aid future stability analysis and mine 
design. This Chapter presents the author's compilation of the 
details of mine instability case histories occurring principally 
over the last four years in N.C.B. surface mines. The data 
supporting each case study has been provided through discussion 
with N.C.i. geotechnical staff and by personal observations made 
by.the author in the N.C.B. Opencast Executive Regions .ince 1976. 
No systematic instability survey of this nature for British 
surface coal mining has been conducted before. The objectives 
of the study are to clarify the extent and nature of the pertinent 
failure modes and to assess the influence of various contributory 
factors. In the process the procedures of instability case 
investigation and reporting are also considered. 
Fifty-seven case histories have been documented in this 
Chapter which are each identified by a unique number from the 
range of 200 to 256 for subsequent reference. Chapter 3 details 
a further eighteen cases, coded 301 to 319, which were observed 
by the author during the working life of the Coalfield Farm mine. 
Chapters 4 and 5 relate a further seven cases observed in 
- 44 -
association with slope monitoring at the Lowther and Low Close 
mines, coded in the 400 and 500 series respectively. This 
Chapter concludes with an analysis of the case history data. 
Little has been published on instability cases in British 
coal mine slopes to date. Walton and Coates (1980) provided 
examples of footwall failure modes in South Wales mines. The 
detailed history of a deep side~all instability was reported by 
Leigh, ScobIe and Young (1980), whilst several examples of 
instability arising from underground workings were reviewed by 
Walton and Taylor (1977). Walton and Atkinson (1978) reviewed 
geotechnical considerations in the planning of surface coal 
mines, with some reference to British mining conditions. 
The geotechnical characteristics of thin clay bands, tested 
dur~ng investigations for the Butterwell mine, were reported by 
Stimpson and Walton (1970). The occurrence and engineering 
properties of similar bands at the operating Sisters and Horsley 
mines in the same region was also detailed by Salehy, Money and 
Dearman (1977), although similarly without reference to instability 
cases. Site investigations of a road cutting in Coal Me.sures 
which was subsequently monitored and remained stable were reported 
by Buist, Burnett and Sanders (1979). Instabilities associated 
with cuttings on the M62 in Coal Measures were descri~ed by 
Arrowsmith, Morris and Bradley (1972), with particular reference 
to adopted remedial measures, whilst prehistoric landslides in 
Coal Measures.were investigated by Early and Skempton (1972), 
Denness (1977) and Gostelow (1977).

The instability survey of this Chapter cannot be claimed to 
be unbiased or contain all cases of instability occurring over 
this period. Only since 1976 have Regional Geotechnical 
Engineers been in post within the N.e.B. Opencast Executive and 
formal geotechnical investigation and reporting of instability 
incidents has evolved regionally since their appointment. 
Practical constraints dictate that priority in such work is 
given to instability on external mine slopes which place at 
risk adjacent utilities or on slopes which threaten mine safety 
or production. As a consequence the more frequent, less 
significant cases have not generally in the past been reported 
in detail. The quantity and precision of geotechnical data in 
this survey is variable, being dependent upon the stage of 
deformation at which investigations were initiated, the degree 
of safe access available to the affected slope area and the 
significance of the instability, i.e. the magnitude of the 
consequences of the developing ground deformation. It is no 
exaggeration to state that in not one of the following case 
studies is there sufficient evidence to precisely characterise 
both the instability mechanism and causes. lhe environment 
of Coal Measures slopes is generally so complex that it is 
difficult to envisage this ever improving without detailed 
post-failure excavation and investigations. This would need 
to justify the consequent cost and impact on mine production. 
The need to gain quantitative data on slope deformation 
processes can be satisfied, however, by integrating monito~ing 
schemes into mining operations in a range of slope environments. 
These need to involve studies of (a) deformation, from survey 
- 46 -
teChniques (surface and borehole), (b) petrology and structure, 
from mapping (outcrop and core), (c) materials strength, from 
field and laboratory testing, (d) groundwater and weather, and 
(e) mine excavation strategy. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 relate the 
results of three such schemes undertaken in U.K. surface coal 
mines. The data considered in this Chapter, however, has been 
assembled by personal inspection of instability cases, by various 
engineers as well as the author, often after deformation has 
reached an advanced state and with little prospect of quantifying 
many relevant factors. This entails that there is inevitably a 
subjective element involved in the collection and interpretation 
of geotechnical data relating to instability cases. No formal 
procedures or guidelines exist to aid the collection of pertinent 
data economically in the field. Section 2.2 considers instability 
case mapping and documentation in more detail and justifies 
features of such work, based on personal experience, which are 
recommended in order to establish complete and relevant reporting. 
2.2: Instability Mappina and Documentation 
In Chapter 3 the benefits are clearly demonstrated of 
investigating all cases of instability on a mine. The 
apparently insignificant minor failures often provide evidence 
which can be used not only to predict later more serious 
failures, but also to clarify their subsequent interpretation. 
Such minor instabilities may also represent the initial phase 
of a more significant, progressive failure. They may also 
present serious hazards to personnel and plant. Identification 
of relevant evidence such as the location and characteristics 
of the failure' base may only be possible at this early stage. 
- 47 -
A major problem affecting the investigation of instability when 
well-advanced is the prevention of access to the basal and side 
areas by the risk to personal safety, or by the blanket cover 
provided by failure debris or backfill. The latter is invariably 
placed at the onset of gross deformation if the slope setting is 
critica. There is a real incentive to conduct investigations 
as soon as signs of slope distress first become apparent. The 
following five groups of features are those which are considered 
to warrant particular investigation in exposed slope instabilities 
in order to provide a complete interpretation of instability based 
on quantitative data with minimal subjectivity. 
2.2.1: Rock Mass Features 
These should be examined, in contrast to nearby exposed 
stable areas of the same slope, in order to identify any local 
features which may have determined the particular location of 
instability. 
STRUCTURAL 
- Jointing 
- dip and dip directions of existing sets (unaffected by 
deformation), particularly any low angle sets on which 
sliding may occur. Hoek (1977) quoted the recommended 
procedures for joint mapping in stability analysis 
proposed by Stauffer (1966)., These, however, require 
at least 100 joint poles. This number of joint exposures 
are not always accessible on a particular slope and the 
author also considers that in Coal Measures, with 
experience, the main joint sets can be identified 
- 48 -
satisfactorily and far more economically. This then 
affords more time for investigation of the accompanying 
features. This should not, however, prevent the use of 
such procedures in stable areas during less pressing 
times to characterise the mine rock mass structure 
thoroughly. 
- persistence and intensity within the slope rock units 
- identification of any local variation in the vicinity 
of exposed faulting and folding 
- roughness and aperture 
- recommended procedures for Coal Measures joint mapping 
have been documented by Cobb (1981). 
cleat orientation, which may aid investigation of old 
underground workings 
- Bedding 
- dips and dip directions over the failure area and in any 
appropriate floor exposures. The persistence of observed 
b~dding orientation into the affected slope is usually one 
of the most conjectural yet critical pieces of infonnation 
for failure analysis 
- local variation in orientation associated with faulting, 
folding, cross bedding, penecontemporaneous slumping 
and washout structures 
- Rockhead Orientation 
- a potential basal plane for deformation, see cases 
219 and 502. 
- 49 -
- Faulting 
dip and dip direction, noting any curvature in plan 
or section 
- nature of strata displacement and disruption, i.e. no~al, 
reverse or tear displacement and gouge thickness. Coal 
Measures faults of minor throw (less than 5 m) often 
exhibit a monocline type of structure. with gradual bedding 
steepening. This can be more adverse to stability than 
faults of larger throw with more abrupt strata displacement. 
Steepening and downwarping of strata in the vicinity of 
faults would appear to be unpredictable with the present 
state of knowledge. Either effect on strata gradients 
appear to occur on upthrow or down throw sides of faults 
and is often absent, see Plates 1.1 and 3.26. 
PETROLOGICAL 
- Nature and Extent of Exposed Component Materials 
- rock and superficials units. 
- fault gouge. 
- joint infill. 
- clay bands; since these are often less than 1 cm thick 
with little distinguishing colouration careful mapping 
is required to identify their existence and nature, noting 
also their persistence and association with particular 
rock horizons or structural features. They have been 
observed particularly associated with ironstone horizons 
in mudrocks and argillaceous seatearths, (Stimpson and 
Walton (1970), Salehy, Money and Dearman (1977), Rao (1980)). 
~ 50 -
- Weathering 
- fragmentation and weakening of rock units due to chemical 
or physical weathering below existing rockhead or ancient 
erosion surfaces, see case 316. 
- softening of joint surfaces. 
- couloir or undercutting development due to weathering 
of rock under a more competent, bridging unit, see case 
- Field Strength Index Test Data 
- Schmidt. Hammer, Pocket Penetrometer, Vane Tester, Point 
Load Tester (Hassani, Scoble and Whittaker (1980. 
2.2.2: Deformation Features 
Rock Mass 
- lipping OD shear surfaces, see Plates 2.10, 3.27 and 5.4, i.e. 
bedding planes, joints, faults, rockhead. 
- joint dilation, see Plate 3.27, possibly leading to couloir 
development, see Plates 2.9 and 3.10; also any accompanying 
ochre-staining if well-established. 
- toe heave or distress, more particularly in spoil or pavement 
slopes. 
- old workings - dimensions and extent of excavations and any 
attendant collapse structures. 
- identification of dilation over old workings by ochre-staining 
on joints due to water percolation in oxidising conditions. 
- 51 -
Tension Cracks 
- location, length, depth, horizontal and vertical displacement. 
- such features often display only vertical displacement and may 
not as such be true tension cracks but represent plane~ along 
which subsidence or shear failure may predominate. 
- shape and alignement, these may be linearly aligned with joint 
or fault trends; if arcuate in plan they may reflect a circular-
type of failure with lack of dominant structural control. 
- refraction through superficials and rock units. 
Backscar and Sidescars 
- orientation, particularly with depth. 
- thickness and nature of gouge. 
- orientation of slickenlines on gouge. 
amount of intact rock breakage versus release from jointing 
or faulting. 
Failure Debris 
- apparent preferred direction of movement. 
- rotation in plan and section; toppling and backtilt are often 
auxiliary modes of displacement and may not represent the 
primary failure mode. 
- manner of disaggregation, e.g. maintenance of large rigid 
blocks or deformation to irregular granular failure mass. 
- buckles or chevron pressure ridges in failed slabs. 
- angles of repose of debris faces. 
- minor rockfall, which may prelude the onset of deformation of the 
instability zone. 
- 52 -
2.2.3: Geometrical Features 
- length, height, wi.dth and volume of affected slope. 
- face and overall slope angles  
. - the above dimensions derived on subsequent occasions provide 
an assessment of the progressive nature of the failure. 
- such dimensions may in practice differ from the planned 
slope configuration, i.e. slopes may be oversteepened or 
undercut. 
- slope curvature in plan or section. 
- surcharge from topsoil, subsoil or overburden dumps on 
crest areas. 
2.2.4: Environmental Features 
- rock and debris groundwater seepage locations and flow rates. 
- available piezometric and river flow data, see 4.4. 
- preceding weather, particularly rainfall - it is recommended 
that this be reported for the preceding month and week under 
the following ranges, as mean IIIIl per day over that period:-
rainfall very heavy > 3 
heavy 2-3 
moderate 1-2 
light < 1 
- location of potential water sources - rivers, canals, drainage 
enannels, lagoons, old underground and surface mine workings. 
- location of underlying deep, longwall mine workings. 
2.2.5: Mining Features 
- sequence of excavation activities preceding the instability. 
- occurrence of any plan promontory arising from the mining 
sequence. 
- duration of exposure of the slope components. 
- extent of blasting in the slope vicinity. 
- the instability may have been triggered by mining activity. 
The data from these five groups then needs support from 
available geological and mining plans and sections together with 
evidence available from eye witnesses. An occasional difficulty 
may arise from a lack of exploration borehole data outside a 
mine site boundary when considering external mine slopes. Seam 
contour planes based on borehole data can provide a useful insight 
into bedding dip control in a slope area. Old workings surveyed 
during coaling operations can also provide useful supporting data. 
Integration of all of this data is then best presented with the 
aid of scaled plans and sections. 
The following section now presents the available details of 
the instability case studies surveyed to date. It is intended 
that these be later reinforced with the addition of further 
instability case studies by Cobb (1981). 
- 54 -
2.3: Instability Case History Data 
Table 2.1 provides a key for the plans and sections presented 
for the following case studies. Each case coded with the letter 
P indicates that it was inspected by the author, otherwise the 
letter D denotes that details have been obtained from N.C.B. staff. 
The following data has been derived for each case:-
H - vertical height from toe to crest of affected slope area, 
n.b. this is not necessarily the overall slope height. 
D - maximum plan distance from affected slope crest rearward 
to developed tension cracking. 
L - full plan length of affected slope. 
V - estimated volume of affected slope. 
A - vertical angle from toe to crest of the affected slope, 
n.b. this is not necessarily the overall slope angle. 
The cases have been grouped into four categories of slope -
highwall, low wall, pavement and loosewall. Although some 
failure types can occur on more than one slope category this 
grouping enables the assessment of instability hazards to be 
related to distinct mine slope types. The highwall category 
includes external and internal sidewalls and endwalls together 
with all advancing internal highwalls. Loosewall is intended 
to include all spoil slopes whether internal, within the mining 
area, or external, to the rear of boundary slopes. It is 
stressed once more that the quantity of data relating to each 
of these cases is variable and this must be borne in mind during 
subsequent analysis.

Instability also developed in the box-cut low wall over this period which carried the extra 
surcharge of a spoil dump on its crest, see also Figure 2.26. The base of this instability was 
observed to lie at its toe on hori~ons of varved clay within which displacement between individual 
varves was evident, see Plate 2.15. These hori~ons were not persistent into the highwall face.

This ease study va. re~orted by Walton (October 1972). One feature of interest is the 
localised st.epening of strata di~s fraaa 70 to 37 0 in the vicinfty of the reverse fault and 
the fact that this Val not evident on its downthrow side. The steepened strata dip resulted 
in OGe mudstone joint  t dipping at SO to 600 into the cut and the creation of a potentially 
UDstable 100 wedge. Considering the SIIIall mudstone block sizes mapped it is interesting to 
note that no fors of rotational failure occurred in this material.

re.ulted ill a semi-circular outline backacar, 6.6 m high and dippiDI at 8So, influenced by rotational failure 
through the superficiala. The drift wa. semi-lithified and ita cobble. had fracturad rather than been pluckad 
by the move_nt at the backlear. The bual failure plme I'm along the lINdstone beddin, which dipped into the 
cut at angles varyinl between 54 md 04. This contortion of strata appeared to be due to penecontempor-
anaOU' deformacioc. Illitial movement in the lINciltone UIldercut the drift cover which sub.equently failed. The 
mud.tone. wera ,oftaned and fragmented by weathering thou~h retailling cheir original bedding structure. They

Tha Iravels did not appear to be aaturatad and average rainfall only occurred in the preceding month. The 
inclination of the axcavated face did not appear to be excessive and a contributory factor.

2.4: Case History Analysis 
the Regions of the N.C.B. Opencast Executive are geographically 
dispersed. Each tends to have its own characteristics of mine 
setting, related to variations in geological and mining history. 
This is manifest in the regional variation of such features as 
superficial cover (e.g. peat, glacial and alluvial drift), post-
Coal Measures overburden, Coal Measures interburden, jointing/ 
faulting/folding related to tectonic histories, and weather. As 
a result each Region tends to have its own characteristic stability 
problems. This analysis does not consider this regional influence 
which is one aspect of a slopes survey being conducted by Cobb 
(1981)  
2.4.1: Geometrical Analysis 
Figure 2.56 shows for each slope category the variation with 
height of the values of depth, length, volume and slope angle for 
instabilities detailed in Section 2.3 and Chapters 3, 4 and 5. 
These range in size from less than 1000 cu m up to 2 million cu m. 
This simplistic approach takes little account of geometrical 
assymmetry and the values of a, D and A are presented as generalised 
values, representative of each instability. Plan assymmetry of 
an instability zone, in particular, is a common feature. Coal 
Measures failures are invariably progressive and the geometry as 
defined for this survey represents only that at a particular stage 
in the development of instability, not necessarily always the 
ultimate extent of failure. Nevertheless this approach clarifies 
the question of any relationship between these parameters, for

each slope category, and does serve to demonstrate their range 
in magnitude. The derivation of any statistically sound relationship 
would be of real value in the design of such mine slopes. 
2.4.1.1: Slope Type 
Statistics from 82 case studies are available for this 
analysis. The percentage of this total by slope category is 
as follows:-
Slope Instability 
Category 
highwall 
low wall 
pavement 
loosewall 
% of Total Instability 
Case Population 
The low number of slope cases other than from highwalls 
reduces the significance of their analysis. The above 
distribution refl~cts the following features:-
- on any mine,highwalls are likely to comprise a much larger 
areal extent than the other slope categories. 
- the above factor implies a greater likelihood of factors adverse 
to slope stability affecting some section of their exposure. 
_ the external sidewalls within the highwall category will tend 
to be exposed for longer durations and thus be more prone to 
time-dependent or progressive failure processes. 
_ pavement slopes are ,only exposed in steep-seam mines, generally 
confined to South Wales and Scottish coalfield mines. 
- 111 -
- with the above point in mind, howeve~.the proportional incidence 
of pavement failures, in comparitive1y few mines with pavement 
slopes (estimated as less than 10 out of a total of around 77 
mines operating at anyone point in time), is large. 
- the 10osewa11 category used here incorporates internal backfill 
slopes and external spoil mounds. 
- many loosewa11 failures are easily accommodated by mining 
operations and may not pose hazards to safety, plant or 
economics. These would often not be reported. In reality 
the incidence of 100sewa1l failures may be higher than indicated 
by these statistics. 
2.4.1.2: Inst~bi1ity Height (H) 
Figure 2.56 indicates the wide range of instability heights, 
which are distributed as follows:-
% of Total Instability Case Population 
H, m Higbwall Low Wall Pavement Loosewal1 Total 
< 10 7 1 0 0 8 
10-25 41 9 1 8 59 
25-50 21 0 3 4 28 
> 50 1 0 3 1 5 
This distribution reflects the following features:-
- the average depth of U.K. surface coal mines is 50 m, Bish, (1979). 
- some of the highwall and low wall instabilities are what in 
open-pit -mining might be termed bench failures. The only open-
pit operation in the U.K. is the Westfield Mine, with a planned 
maximum depth of 214 m. 
- 112 -
- instability does not appear to be related directly to height 
of exposure, with the apparent exception of overburden and 
pavement slopes. The latter also tend to fail afaer initiation 
to their full exposed height due to the continuity of their 
profile and geology. 
- detailed examination of highwall case data indicates that 
height exerts a less direct control through determining more 
the occasion when adverse structural settings are created. 
Height would appear to be important, not so much from its 
control on stress levels, but on kinematic feasibility and 
provision of low shear strength horizons, whilst its influence 
on groundwater pressures remains conjectural. 
2.4.1.3: Instability Slope Angle (A) 
The wide dispersion of H versus A data in Figure 2.56 for 
each slope category indicates that instability cannot be related 
solely to slope angle over the range of operating heights. Loose-
wall slopes offer the least complex environment in which a critical 
H versus A relationship might be applicable. As extreme examples 
compare case 255, an overburden mound dumped to a 50 m height at 
a slope face angle of 70
, with case 232, an internal loosewall 
placed to a 58 m height but with a slope face angle of 24. Both 
failures were significant and indicate that H and A cannot be 
used alone to predict stability but have to be used in recognition 
of other factors, i.e. materials characteristics, groundwater, 
placement method, pavement characteristics and orientation. 
Inadvertent oversteepening of highwall and loosewall slopes does 
trigger some failures and this stresses the need to monitor 
- 113 -
excavation angles during production, especially in critical 
environments. The greater concentration of instabilities in 
the range 60 to 80
for A is indicative of the fact that a large 
proportion of the highwa11 and low wall cases lay at or above 
the shallowest coaling level in a slope, or were bench failures 
and thus had a slope angle determined by the excavating plant. 
If also follows that these generally had H values of less than 
25 m. 
2.4.1.4: Instability Depth (D) 
This is a crucial parameter since it determines the extent 
of failure into the slope area overlying the base of failure. 
In external slopes it also governs the possible impact of 
instability on ground outside th~ mine site boundary. Any 
ability to predict the limits to lateral progression of a 
failure, i.e. its maximum D value, knowing the developed H 
value in a slope category would be of real benefit. Figure 2.56 
shows the dispersion of case studies for the H-D re lationship  
which are distributed as fo110ws:-

0.6-1 17 6 1 1 25 
1-5 39 1 2 5 47 
> 5 4 1 4 6 15 
In the cases with HID less than 0.6, this low value was not 
due to low values of H but more to high values of D. It is 
- 114 -
apparent that in highwal1 instability cases the occurrence of deep 
failure masses ia significant. The sparse number of cases for 
each of the other slope categories prevents any effective statistical 
analysis but the indication is that this may also be so for low 
walls and 100sewalls. The fact that observed pavement failures 
involve comparitively thin slabs supports the tentative statistical 
indication that such failures involve HID values usually well 
above one. 
Eight cases of highwall instability exhibited HID values 
below 0.6. All but one of these were released by faults (numbers 
205, 207, 214, 309, 317, 318 and 251) and were based on bedding 
horizons, steepened at the faulting and dipping into the cut. 
The remaining case (number 219) was not related to faulting but 
was a planar failure based at the rockhead junction between thick 
boulder clay and Coal Measures. The two low wall failures with 
HID values below .6 (cases 237, 239) were also planar bedding 
failures, whilst the one loosewall failure with such a low HID 
value (case 234) was also based on a planar feature, i.e. an 
inclined foundation. The common features of this group of lowest 
HID values are that they were based on planar horizons with low 
dips into the excavation. The role of faulting in highwall 
instability is discussed later in Section 2.4.3. Faulting would 
appear through its provision of a low tensile strength, release 
plane to enable deeper rigid block slides to occur. When release 
is provided in planar fa~lure ?y parting along joints and intact 
rock breakage then the potential failure depth would appear to be 
more limited, to give a likely HID range of 1 to 4, see cases 202, 
215 and 218. The highwall failures not controlled by bedding 
- 115 -
shear, i.e. multiplanar or quasi-circular mode, which involve 
joint shear and intact rock failure in argillaceous slopes also 
appear to be more limited in depth, within an HID range of 1 
to 4. 
The author recognises the danger of placing too much weight 
on parameters based purely on geometrical relationships without 
considering the interaction of a number of other relevant features 
such as groundwater and exposure time. The assessment of the limits 
to lateral depth of failure in slope design, according to projected 
geometry, petrology, structure and failure mode, using guidelines 
based on such HID analysis may be possible. The development of such 
a broad design tool would be of real value, particularly in the 
design of external mine slopes. It appears to justify further 
research using more case studies and detailed back-analysis. 
2.4.1.5: Instability Length (L) 
Figure 2.56 indicates the wide range of instability lengths, 
distributed as follows:-
% of Total Instability Case Production 
~ Highwall Low Wall 
Pavement Loosewal1 Total 
< SO 30 4 1 5 40 
50-100 23 5 3 3 34 
100-20 16 0 0 6 22 
> 200 1 1 1 1 4 
There is limited correlation between Hand L, and any simple 
height control over L is not distinct. The above data does indicate 
that 74% of instability cases developed to less than 100 m in length. 
- 116 -
The observed values of L however, as with D, are controlled 
significantly by the exposure time or stage of advancement of the 
failure. Cases 403 and 404 are good examples of the effect of 
exposure time when over a 400 day period with no interference 
from remedial measures the instabilities progressed longitudinally 
with an LID ratio increasing from 2 to 33 over this time. Many 
of the surveyed cases were backfill buttressed and thus not 
afforded the opportunity to develop to their fullest extent. 
The distribution of LID ratios for the instability cases 
is given below: 
% of Total Instability Case Population 
LID Righwall Low Wall Pavement Loosewall Total 
< 1 0 0 0 0 0

3-5 12 2 0 4 18 
5-10 21 0 3 5 29 
> 10 11 4 3 4 22 
This shows the wide variation in LID value when considering 
the cases collectively. There appears to be no simple relationship 
between Land D, in fact 78% of the case population had developed 
LID ratios in the wide range of 1 to 10. Note that for all 
instabilities L exceeded D. Detailed inspection of the survey 
cases indicated that longitudinal progression was limited by the 
following possible features - faulting, deep underground mine 
subsidence cracks, outlines of shallow underground mine collapse 
zones, outlines of excavated plan promontories, constraint afforded 
- 117 -
by excavated slope corners, and changes in controlling sedimentary 
structure or petrology, as well as time. The cases with low RID 
andlor high LID values tend to represent failures based on a 
persistent basal plane with insignificant variation in any of the 
above features in order to enable full progression of failure. 
Such persistent basal planes comprised sedimentary bedding planes, 
clay bands and junctions between sandstones and overlying weathered 
mudstones together with rockhead. Development of large D and L 
values also requires low gradients on such basal planes in order 
to avoid limiting convergence with the slope profile. This 
reflects the control exerted by rock mass structure on slope 
stability. 
2.4.1.6: Instability Volume (V) 
Figure 2.56 shows the variation of instability volume, V, 
with affected height, R. The distribution of V values is as 
fo1lows:-
~ % of Total Instabilitz Case Po~u1ation

25-100 16 4 1 5 26 
100-200 5 1 1 1 8 
>200 4 0 0 2 6 
In the highwa11 data all of the cases over 200,000 cu m in 
volume were related to faulting. Faulting, however, was evident 
to be responsible for a complete range of instability volume. 
- 118 -
The two loosewa11 failures in the same volume range arose from 
sliding of an internal backfill slope along a seatearth pavement 
and oversteepening of the face of a high overburden mound. The 
volume of these larger failures is generally an order of magnitude 
less than their equivalents in hard rock open pit mining, but 
this is mainly a reflection of the greater heights and lengths 
of slopes involved in the latter operations. The significance 
of the large British coal instability is just as great, however, 
in the context of the confined internal working areas and proximity 
to external utilities that exist in such mining. Failures of all 
sizes can place personnel and plant at risk. The survey data is 
biased in not containing representative cases of minor face rock-
fall which unless causing personal injury is seldom reported. In 
1980, at the Icehouse mine, East Midlands, ~hree men were seriously 
injured, whilst involved in coaling operations at the base of a 
8 m high face, by the fall of a single block of only 0.5 cu m in 
volume. The rockfall was released by two intersecting joint sets 
in weathered mudstone which provided an intersection line daylighting 
on the 700 face and facilitating this small wedge failure. 
- 119 -
2.4.2: Factors Contributing to Rock Slope Instability 
This analysis is based on an examination of each surveyed 
case study and the identification of those factors which have 
contributed significantly to its instability. It must be stated 
that this task has relied on the interpretation of the available 
data for each case study. It thus suffers from any inherent weakness 
in the data, as discussed in Section 2.2, and any consequent 
subjectivity in its interpretation. This study is aimed to 
provide a realistic indication of the significance and nature 
of those factors contributing to instability. These have been 
assessed for all cases and summarized in Table 2.4; n.b. case 
numbers 248 to 256 are not included in this table. 
2.4.2.1: Faulting 
This contributed to instability in three possible ways, one 
or a combination of which could be operative by providing: 
- release planes, as backscars or sidescars, with low tensile 
strength. 
localised adverse steepening of strata dips in their vicinity. 
low shear strength planes for translational Sliding of rigid 
blocks. 
Faulting contributed significantly to 49% of the highwall case 
population. Although clay bands or intraformational shear bands 
were observed in a number of mine slopes, mapping gave no clear 
indication of their genetic relationship to faulting. Asymmetry 
in plan of the affected area was common, delineated directly by 
the contributing fault planes. It was not possible to derive 
- 120 -
----:.~ .-- --:-
'--___ .-.:.-J.--'--' . ___ , --___ . ____ :-
TABLE 2 .4 FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO INSTABILITY 
- 121 -
any relationship between the onset of instability and the distance 
of the affected slope from contributory faulting. A limiting 
distance of this kind would be of assistance in designing stand-
off distances from faulting. Other factors besides geometry, e.g. 
materials strength and groundwater pressure, appear to have governed 
the wide range of this distance observed in the survey, e.g. cases 
200, 222, 223 and 318. 
2.4.2.2: Shear Zones 
This term is intended to represent weak horizons which 
provided the main basal plane for shear displacement. It 
represents clay bands, softened bedding planes, and seatearths, 
see Section 1.1. These contributed to 63% of the highwall 
instabilities. The data indicates that they are also the prime 
contributory factor to low wall and pavement instability. In 
some of the cases studied the presence of such zones could not 
be established due to lack of access and the above statistic may 
indeed be an underestimate. 
2:4.2.3: Old Workings 
Table 2.4 indicates those instabilities which appeared to 
be related to old underground workings and not simply those 
containing such excavations. Recognition of the direct contribution 
of old workings collapse to instability on slopes under 20 m high 
is relatively straightforward in comparison with assessing their 
role in higher and deeper instabilities, e.g. case 309. The 
contribution of old workings collapse to 25% of the highwall 
instabilities should thus be treated with caution. One example 
of old workings influence on pavement stability is provided by 
esse 246. 
- 122 -
2.4.2.4: Sedimentary Structures 
This group includes cross bedding, channel, washout and 
penecontemporaneous slumping structures together with folding. 
The latter feature was indicated to cause the main type of such 
influence on stability, primarily since localized strata steepening 
against faults was included under this heading. Their contribution 
was by providing adverse strata dips into excavations, in addition 
to fault limbs, e.g. cases 318 and 217. 
2.4.2.5: Water 
No quantitative data was available on groundwater pressures 
pertaining to any of the affected slopes studied except the 
Lowther south highwall, see Chapter 4. Water has thus been . 
assessed as a contributory factor in the survey cases if other 
indications of high groundwater pressures were evident. These 
comprised - excessive rainfall preceding instability initiation, 
heavy seepage from exposed horizons and debris and hydraulic 
continuity with water sources (rivers, canals, drainage ditches 
and lagoons). Such inspection indicated groundwater pressure 
to be a primary. factor, contributing to 51% of the highwall 
instabilities and a similar proportion of the other slope 
instabilities. The use of seepage flow rates to assess ground-
water pressures is conjectural. Scientific study has yet to 
define the drawdown characteristics of Coal Measures slopes 
and the influence of faulting on such. Section 3.5 relates 
the stability problems of a river diversion sited in proximity 
to external mine slopes whilst Chapter 4 presents a detailed 
example of the stability problems arising during and after the 
- 123 -
inadvertent flooding of a mine void by an adjacent river. The 
influence of adjacent rivers on mine slope groundwater regimes 
as well as concern over the security of such waterways are 
common problems faced during mine design in Britain. 
2.4.2.6: B.las~in9. 
This was not indicated to be an obvious contributory factor 
but requires more detailed scientific study to assess its influence 
more conclusively. 
2.4.2.7: Arenaceous Rock Co"mponents Thickness and Location 
The column headed Arenaceous in Table 2.4 gives the estimated 
% of arenaceous rock comprising the mass of each instability. This 
indicates a volumetric predominance of argillaceous sediments. 
Cases 203, and 401 to 404 indicate that where sandstones comprise 
the bulk of a slope with no contained shear zones then such units 
reinforce the slope mass strength and confine the base of any 
developing instability in overlying units to the upper surface 
of the sandstone. The cases do not indicate conclusively that 
the. greater intact strength of arenaceous units within such 
instabilities contributed to any significant reduced lateral 
development of deformation. 
2.4.2.8: Jointing 
This factor has been logged in Table 2.4 for any instability 
case if considered to have contributed significantly to instability 
by providing any of the following structural features: 
- 124 -
(a) Release planes to control the delineation of lateral and/or 
longitudinal extent of instability. Such control is indicated 
to be strong in small failures, (under 5000 cu m), butnot so' 
obvious in larger incidents, e.g. cases 224, 225, 226, 227. 
Composite release planes comprising joint and tensile fracture 
faces were evident in backscars and sidescars of planar 
failure, see Plates 2.19 and 3.29. The provision of such 
release planes in large failures is not, however, indicated 
to be sufficient alone to promote instability. 
(b) Single or composite shear planes inclined into the excavation 
leading to wedge and sliding type failures, (also related to 
strata dips and slope face angles), or smaller rockfall 
incidents, e.g. cases 221, 228. 
(c) Control over block size and orientation, such as to promote 
toppling, e.g. case 252. 
(d) Control over void migration above old underground mine workings 
e.g. case 229. 
In addition, those argillaceous slope sections which exhibit intense 
jointing, accompanying weathering effects, appear to be susceptible 
to quasi-circular rotational failure mechanisma in the absence of 
other structural controls, e.g. cases 248, 249, 402, 403, 404, see 
Section 1.1. 
Jointing so defined was indicated to be a contributory 
factor in 56% of the rock slope instability cases. 
- 125 -
2.4.2.9: Weathertng 
The reduction of intact rock and discontinuity strengths, 
discussed in Chapter 1, due to weathering appeared to contribute 
primarily to instability by adversely affecting the rock mass 
strength of mudrock units, see previous section on jointing. 
Case 209 and those detailed in Chapter 4 indicate the susceptibility 
to instability of upper slope sections com?rising mudrock units 
which were heavily jointed and softened under the influence of 
groundwater. Case 316 relates an example of a mudstone unit 
significantly softened and fragmented up to 5 m below an unconformity 
with overlying Permo-Trias, apparently due to ancient weathering 
and deformation processes. Similar rock mass strength reduction 
in mudstones was also observed in zones below rockhead under 
drift cover up to 28 m in depth. This suggests that weathering 
processes can influence mudstone strength to depths in excess 
of 10 m below ground level. 
2.4.2.10: Curvature 
The excavation of highwalls with significant plan curvature, 
i.e. promontory, were shown to present an adverse setting for 
fault-r~lated instability, e.g. cases 200, 201 and 207. Curvature 
in section, related to folding, was shown to have similar effects 
on pavement slab instabilities. 
2.4.2.11: Time 
Each instability case surveyed has been examined to assess 
the duration of exposure of the affected slope prior to instability 
becoming apparent. This time period has been classified as 
- 126 -
immediate (I), when less than one month, or long term (L) when 
greater.: This is intended to differentiate between those cases 
triggered by excavation which exposed an inherently unstable 
setting and those which appeared to require the development of 
additional processes. The latter might comprise time-dependent 
processes of creep within failure planes and intact rock, and 
strain-dependent progressive failure related to rebound, weathering 
and groundwater pressure; related themselves to both time and 
climate. The quantity and detail available for each instability 
case is inadequate for any further investigation of these processes. 
Detailed slope monitoring can only provide the data appropriate 
for such an analysis. 60% of the highwall cases and all low wall 
cases occurred within one month of exposure. Pavement slopes 
appeared to fall into both categories. Account must here be 
taken of the fact that long term instability of ' internal mine 
slopes may have been underestimated by the survey since such 
slopes usually have a working life of under a m~nth. 51% of 
the highwa11 cases were on external slopes. This appears to 
be unduly high considering the far greater exposure of internal 
slopes during the working life of a mine. It must be noted, 
however, that internal cases of instability are unlikely to 
receive the same status in reporting and investigation. This 
may explain their comparitive lack of representation. Chapter 
3 comprehensively records the stability history of all slopes 
during the working life of one large mine. 69% of highwall 
instability cases occurring during its life were on external . 
slopes. It would appear that external slopes are more prone 
to instability and this would apparently result from their 
greater period of exposure. This is significant when viewed 
- 127 -
in the lignt of the U.K. surface coal mining environment where 
surface utilities often lie in close proximity to mine site 
boundaries. 
2.4.3: Facto~ Contributing to Spoil Slope Instability 
Only eleven (13%) of the survey cases comprised spoil slopes, 
so no claim can be made that they are completely representative of 
the incidence and mode of all forms of spoil instability. Spoil 
herein is regarded as excavated superficials, overburden and 
interburden. The value of these cases is that they demonstrate a 
number of salient features affecting spoil slope stability. 
Eight cases concern internal loosewall slopes, and five of 
these relate to loosewall stability during the working life of 
the Coalfield Farm mine. These are ~iscussed in detail in 
Section 3.7 and demonstrate the importance of loosewall instability 
assessment in that this feature can control overall mine design 
and, if unanticipated, may result in costly amendments to working 
methods. Deep-seated planar or bi-planar failure modes were 
evident in loosewalls along pavement surfaces inclined at from 
SO to 70 , e.g. cases 310 and 231. Localised pavement steepening 
was evident as a possible contributory feature. The angle of 
repose of mine backfill lies consistently in the range 340 to 
350 in the U.K., although faces may stand temporarily at steeper 
induced inclinations. Oversteep or undercut loosewall slopes, 
greater than 400 , were evident to be unstable, e.g. cases 310, 
311, 312. Case 232 demonstrated that loosewall failures can be 
large, i.e. in excess of 100000 cu m, when based on deep-seated 
pavements. This study reveals the marked lack of field and 
- 128 -
laboratory test data on the physical, mechanical and hydrological 
characteristics of backfill slopes and pavement foundations. 
Case 254 involved an old backfill slope encountered during mining. 
Such backfill has received little study but constitutes an 
increasing number of mine slopes. The effects of softening and 
weathering associated with the re-establisbment of the water 
table and settlement have not been quantified for such material. 
Chapter 4 provides an example of the relevance of such study. It 
relates the flooding, subsequent drainage and final backfilling 
of a completed void. Future mining in an adjacent site is 
planned to work in close proximity to this backfilled void. 
Realistic design of slopes in such backfill is essential in order 
to optimize coal extraction in their vicinity with minimal risk. 
Case 234 indicates that sub-soil mound planar instability 
can be promoted by an adversely inclined original ground surface, 
7. The need to consider realistic overburden mound heights related 
to the hydrology and strength of underlying foundations in 
superficials is highlighted by case 233. This case, with 
additional reference to two other incidents, indicates that a 
critical mound height in the order of 20 m applies when underlain 
by thick 8uperficials but may be governed by groundwater, 
superificials characteristics and rate of loading. Extensive 
circular failure was generated in these cases with failure based 
well below the pavement and with significant toe displacement. 
Case 255 demonstrated the risk to stability of creating a steep, 
lQPsely-tipped overburden mound on top of dumped boulder clay. 
- 129 -
2.4.4: Failure Mechanisms 
The instabilities have each been ascribed a characteristic 
failure mode, see Table 2.4. 
2.4.4.1: Planar Translational Sliding (P) 
This mode was interpreted as representing 30% of the highwall 
instabilities, virtually all of the pavement and low wall cases 
and some of the loosewall cases. These represented failures which 
were based on a single planar horizon and defined to the rear by 
tensile release planes, e.g. cases 202, 215 and 219. Adverse 
basal planes were principally bedding shear zones, as well as 
daylighting fault and joint planes, mine pavements, rockhead and 
foundation surfaces. 
2.4.4.2: Bi-Planar failure (B) 
This mode was ascribed to an instability if shear failure 
along a second rear plane was evident in addition to the primary 
basal plane. Distinction between this and the former mode can 
be conjectural, especially if the lower plane is much longer than 
the upper. It is thought to most aptly represent planar failure 
with a second upper shear plane to the rear delineating a linear 
main backscar. This is typified by failure based on bedding, 
steepened up to a rear fault, with shear occurring either along 
the fault plane, e.g. cases 205 and 211, or beyond it to the 
surface by shear along or across bedding, e.g. cases 317 and 
318. This interpreted mode represented 3Sr. of highwall cases 
and was common in loosewall cases based on planar features such 
as mine pavements, old dump surfaces and original ground surfaces. 
- 130 -
2.4.4.3: Multi-Planar Failure (M} 
This is intended to represent a failure mechanism where one 
or two planar features are not defined as delineating the base of 
instability. An alternative descriptor for this mode might be 
quasi-circular in that, in section, rotation down to the rear 
is generally observed and the delineating tension cracks are 
often arcuate, reflecting a lack of persistent structural planes 
controlling the instability, see cases 248 and 402. This 
interpreted mode represented 25% of the highwall cases and one 
pavement failure, case 242. It appeared to be dominant in slope 
sections with weak rock mass st~ength and" lack of large scale 
structural control~ Reduced rock mass strength in argillaceous 
units related to weathering and ingress of water appeared to 
promote this failure mechanism. This appears to be a characteristic 
failure mode in South Wales mines, often developing on argillaceous 
highwall sections with dips of up to 200 into the slope and no 
prospect of structural control except by way of joint orientation 
and intensity, e.g. cases 216 and 248. Slope sections with any 
significant components of arenaceous rock were not observed to 
display this form of instability. 
Case 203 defies interpretation due to lack of diagnostic 
features. It has been classified as multi-planar but possibly 
is the only example encountered of a highwall bearing-capacity 
failure as outlined by Kvapil and Clews (1979). 
- 131 -
2.4.4.5: Circular Rotational Failure eC) 
This was not a common mode in the rock slopes, only 2 cases 
were observed. One case, 308, was observed in Permo-Trias over-
burden, comprising mainly marl, and the other was structurally 
controlled on a fold limb, case 315. It was a common mechanism 
in mine spoil and soil slopes which contained no adverse structural 
feature. 
2.4.4.6: Miscellaneous 
Failurewas observed to.develop in highwall slope sections 
where strata dips into the slope of 20
or more were associated 
with a slope face angle suCh as to form wedge failure based on 
a shear plane of composite joint surfaces with limited intact 
rock breakage, e.g. case 228. 
Toppling failures on highwalls were common in thickly-bedded 
sandstone units with persistent jointing, often promoted by 
er0sion of weaker underlying rock units, e.g. cases 227 and 252. 
Ravelling and rockfall from dilatant siltstone and sandstone 
blocks in high slope sections is a common feature arising from 
loosening due to weathering and erosion, and blasting. ' 
This miscellaneous category of failures represents small 
volumes of deformation but in the absence of good housekeeping, 
safety benches and surveillance they can pose a serious hazard 
to plant and personnel. This is due to the violent and rapid 
nature of ultimate failure and the often exposed situation of 
coaling operations at the base of even low internal faces, e.g. 
see Section 2.4.1.6. 
- 132 -
2.5: Summary 
A detailed compilation of 82 instability cases occurring 
principally over a four year period nationally has been presented. 
An analysis has assessed the characteristics and causes of the 
various types of slope instability present. Procedures for 
instability case investigation and reporting have been recommended 
since the depth and quality of suCh work is basic to interpretation, 
back-analysis and future mine slope design. 70% of the cases 
comprised highwall slopes which reflects the predominance of 
this slope type in mining methods, and as a result, analysis has 
tended to be concentrated on such slopes. 
The simplistic geometrical analysis undertaken indicated 
that no generally-applicable combinations of height-depth-length-
angle relationships are tenable as basic design tools. ~he 
cases demonstrated the range of complex slope settings with 
several interacting, controlling factors in addition to slope 
geometry. Slope height was concluded to be important in 
controlling the exposure of adverse structure and shear zones. 
Excavation depth did not directly correlate to incidence of 
instability. Large variation in instability depth and length 
of penetration were evident, in association with lateral and 
longitudinal progressive failure. Those failures of deepest 
penetration were associated with persistent basal planes, 
frequently released by faults. A tentative relationship between 
failure mode and penetrated height/depth ratio is proposed. In 
all cases penetrated length exceeded depth, i.e. plan elongation 
along the slope crest line existed. 
- 133 -
Plan outlines of instability cases predominantly demonstrated 
asymmetry, related to structural control, exemplifying the three-
dimensional aspect of Coal Measures slope stability. The precise 
profile of underlying basal failure planes was far more open to 
conjecture in interpretation. Full kinematic feasibility, 
provided by single sidescar planes, was not identified in many 
cases to be essential to preventing instabil~ty. Breakage along 
composite joint and intact rock bridge failure planes was evident 
where rock types were inherently weak and affected by groundwater 
pressures, particularly where other accompanying delineating 
failure planes were sufficiently weak and adversely orientated. 
Rotation both in plan and section was eyident in frequent 
instability cases. 
A wide range of instability volume was evident. The largest 
pose the greatest impact on mine external environment, production 
and economics but even the smallest was demonstrated to justify 
equal attention when concerned over hazards to personnel and 
plant. 
Eleven classes of contributory factors were assessed in the 
analysis of the survey population. Isolating the importance of 
one or two of these factors places at risk the identification of 
potential instability in the widely complex range of Coal Measures 
slope settings. An overall conclusion, however, is that the 
predominant causes of rock slope instability are adverse structural 
geology and weak basal shear planes. The influence of ground-
wat~r pressure on Coal Measures slopes has not been adequately 
defined and requires detailed scientific evaluation in the future. 
- 134 -
Exposure time has been indicated to exert strong control over 
stability. The remaining contributory factors need to be 
considered with reference to particular slope settings. 
This work is hoped to contribute to a more quantitative 
approach to Coal Measures slope analysis by fostering the greater 
utilization of the experience gained from historical data. This 
should reduce the geotechnical pr~b1ems posed in designing not 
only mine slopes, but also excavation strategy.

THE HISTORY OF GROUND DEFOR~TIOH ASSOCIATED 
WITH MINING THE COALFIELD FAR~1 MINE 
3.1: Introduction 
This Chapter has been devoted to the history and analysis of 
ground movement at the Coalfield Farm O.C.C.S. throug~ its working 
life, from May 1976 to September 1980. The site was located in 
Leicestershire and operated with a working area of 46 hectares to 
a maximum depth of 70 m. The initial calculated recoverable coal 
reserves were 3371187 cu m (4216556 tonnes) with an overall 
stripping ratio of 4.61:1. The use of a Ruston Bucyrus 1260 W 
walking dragline with a 24.5 cu m bucket on an 80 m boom made it 
one of the most productive of British mines. The contractual tonnage 
of 20325 tonnes per.week'was met consistently by the operating 
contractor, Merriman Meignam Ltd. 
During the life of the mine a number of cases of slope 
instability arose on both external and internal walls which were 
not fully anticipated. The case studies of all the significant 
instabilities have been documented herein from evidence gained by 
field visits to the mine by the author from 1976, supplemented by 
data supplied by N.C.B. mine and geotechnical staff. 
In the autumn of 1978 a major instability developed on the 
western external sidewall prompting a comprehensive monitoring 
scheme which involved the author and G. Young (1979) in conjunction 
with N.e.B. staff. Details of the monitored instability have 
subsequently been reported by Leigh, ScobIe and Young (1980). 
This Chapter affords the opportunity to comment further on the 
- 136 -
nature of that scheme and instability in the light of later 
developments. 
The nature of the stability problems encountered in the mine 
was varied and involved a number of factors which the author's 
analysis herein aims to highlight. Future stability problems at 
the outset of mining were not anticipated to be significant due 
to the camparatively shallow dips of the s~ams, not excessively 
worked from underground in the past, (the maximum allowance made 
in anyone seam was 7~% old workings). No significant faulting 
was identified as crossing the working area of the reserves. The 
Ibstock Fault, a major fault complex was established, as often is the 
convention, as the natural limit to mining in the north of the site. 
Some doubts over the strike cut highwall stability when working the 
final northern section up dip towards the fault did originally exist. 
The exte~t of the complexity of the faulting and the tendency for 
translational highwall failure were not however fully anticipated. 
Only as mining progressed through the site did the significance of 
the presence of low shear strength clay bands and local structural 
variation, in determining stability, become fully appreciated. 
The large west sidewall instability referred to earlier provided 
an unusual form of deformation linked to faulting traversing the 
mining area, which was originally considered of minor significance 
with regard to slope stability, with some con~ribution from a 
range of supplementary factors. 
The mine presented.a good example of how unanticipated stability 
problems can effect major changes to working methods. The initial 
mining plan involved strike cuts advancing south to north from the 
pavement in crop through a gentle synclinal struture to the Ibstock 
- 137 -
Fault. Localised steepening of the pavement on the southern syncline 
limb, however, resulted in significant loosewall instability. The 
mining method was then adapted to still remove the upper three Lount 
seams by strike cuts whilst subsequently mining the lower Yard and 
Low Main seams by shorter dip cuts, reducing the working effectiveness 
of the 1260 dragline. As a result of working the basal dip cuts 
from east to west the central length of the west external sidewall 
stood open for over two years, to a height of over 40 m, before the 
last dip cut was worked at its base. This terminal dip cut triggered 
the final episode in the history of fault-bound instability in the 
central west sidewali which, at one stage threatened the security of 
utilities and a farm outside the site boundary. This instability 
necessitated the premature curtailment of the last dip cut and 
highlighted the problem of undertaking remedial measures. Backfill 
bu~tressing of the by then 60 m high sidewall was anticipated at the 
t~e to require four months,before reacning its full level to become 
completely effective. Thus the limited flexibility of remedial 
measures was fully tested by this situation. 
A sequence of translational failures on the strike cut highwalls 
later, in proximity to the Ibstock Fault,. also necessitated the 
temporary use of dip cut working and shovel-truck operations. 
The N.C.B. anticipated the development of the northward 
extension of the Coalfield Farm O.C.C.S. in late 1980 in the form 
of a new mine, Coalfield Farm North O.C.C.S. This larger mine will 
work two additional deeper seams to a maximum depth in excess of 
100 m, in a. very similar geotechnical environment. The mine area 
will be traversed by a fault zone, the Ravenstone Mill Fault, 
parallel and similar in character to the Ibstock Fault. This 
- 138 -
Chapter is therefore also aimed in part to provide useful 
information on the likely factors affecting stability and planned 
monitoring at this new mine. 
3.2: Mine Geology 
The Coalfield Farm O.C.C.S. lies on the eastern side of the 
faulted Ashby Antic~ine sequence of Coal Measures which trends 
NNE-SSW and separates the South Derbyshire coalfield basin to the 
west and the Leicestershire coalfield basin to the east. The 
Anticline represents a block upthrown on its western margin by 
the regional Boothorpe Fault and on its eastern margin by a series 
of easterly downthrow faults, including the IbstoCk Fault. The 
Coal Measures on the minesite comprise a shallow syncline whose 
NNW-SSE axis runs perpendicular to the Ashby Anticline axis and 
parallel to the Ibstock Fault. The synclinal structure. results 
in minesite seam dips varying from 1 in 8 to the north-east in the 
incrop are~reducing to horizontal in the central area.and then 
rising to I in 15 to the south-west in the northern area approaching 
the Ibstock Fault boundary, see Figure 3.1. Localised increases 
in dips were observed, however, on both syncline limbs which 
contributed to loosewall and higawall instability during mining. 
The faulting and folding is thought to have been generated by an 
E-W maximum principal .compressive stress, developed during the 
Variscan orogeny and possibly influenced by the underlying Charnoid 
basement structure. This tectonic activity was followed by a 
period of pre-Permian erosion. Subsequent Permo-Trias deposition 
produced a sequence of basal breccias and sandstones followed by 
marls with generally horizontal dips above the irregular Coal 
Measures unconformity, with the Coal Ueasures faulting pattern

from subsequent probable Tertiary re-activation. The Permo-Trias 
were subsequently eroded and in places removed before the deposition 
of Pleistocene glacio-fluvial unconsolidated sands, pebble beds 
and gravels. 
The detailed characteristics of faulting on site were only 
defined by actual exposure during mining. Its general trend was 
NNW-SSE comprising normal faults dippi~g from 600 to vertical, 
usually with an easterly throw. These caused serious stability 
problems in the west sidewall and main highwall, as detailed in 
sections 3.6 and 3.8 later, due mainly to localised steepening 
of bedding dips in their proximity. 
Table 3.1 provides a summary of the general succession of 
rocks encountered on the minesite. Less than 5% of the sequence 
comprised arenaceous sediments. Details of the mechanical 
properties of various minesite rocks are presented in Table 3.2. 
'Severa1 coal seams were encountered .in the mine although the highest 
two, the Upper Lount Rider and Upper Lount, occurred only in the 
central and northern mine areas due to the synclinal structure. 
The Middle Lount, Nether Lount and Upper Lount Rider underclay 
seatearths were observed to contain persistent clay bands from 
10 to 30 mm thiCk, usually within 10 mm of the underside of the 
coal. These bands were generally dark grey to dark grey-brown 
when dry and contained discontinuous, listric shear planes which 
often defined lithic fragments up to 5 mm in length in a clay 
matrix. Two other less persistent, light grey clay bands were 
also observed in the mine, both within a sequence of mudstones, 
referred to by miners on site as 'leather jacket'. One occurred 
2 m above the Yard seam and the other 4 m above the Middle Lount

seam. The physical and mechanical properties of Bome of these 
clay bands resembled those encountered by previous workers in the 
Coal Measures of north and western England (Meigh and Henkel (1964), 
Stimpson and Walton (1970) and Sa1ehy et a1 (1977. Stimpson and 
Walton (1970), related their genesis to folding or gravitational 
sliding terming them 'Clay Mylonites~ whilst Matheson and Thomson 
(1973) identified similar gouge bedding zones related to valley 
rebound. Salehy et al (1977) termed them 'Intraformational Shear 
Zones' and related them to faulting. Their occurrence at Coalfield 
Farm O.C.C.S. and the proximity of the Ibstock Fault together with 
the relatively gentle folding would tend to support the latter view. 
Mining in the planned Coalfield North O.C.C.S. should provide the 
opportunity to study such bands in further detail. Table 3.2 
contains a summary of the physical and mechanical properties of 
some of these bands as well as associated rocks from the mine. The 
pale grey, underclay seatearth below the Yard seam was also the base 
of translational sliding as dips steepened in the proximity of the 
Ibstock Fault, see Section 3.8 and Plate 3.26. Such failure in 
the same locality was observed to generate impersistent clay bands 
less than 2 mm thick in the mudstone above and below the Yard seam. 
These were dark grey, stiff and uniform clay bands occurring within 
mudstone bedding planes as slip gouge. A further instance of 
translational sliding along a mudstone bedding plane is reported 
in Section 3.6, see Plates 3.7 and 3.8, where up to 15 mm of shear 
displacement on the bedding plane had resulted in polishing, but 
with negligible evidence of any derived clay gouge.

Figure 3.2 presents the results of joint surveys undertaken 
in the mine Coal Measures on four occasions through its working 
life. It clearly defines two dominant joint sets, both dipping 
from 800 to vertical. One set trending N340 W was sub-parallel 
to the Ibstock Fault whilst the other ran orthogonal to the main 
strike cut highwall at N60
E. The former set resulted in joint-
bound blocks often peeling from exposed strike cut highwall faces, 
aligned obliquely at from N4S
W to N60oW. These two joint sets 
compare closely with the Jl and J2 sets proposed by Weaver (1974) 
from comprehensive mapping in South Derbyshire. He proposed the 
derivation of major faulting and these joint sets as conjugate 
shears resulting from E-W late Carboniferous, pre-Permian 
compression. The joints were smooth, planar and spaced from 
6 to 10 m apart (NW trend) and 2 to 4 m apart (NE trend) with a 
tendency to intensify on both syncline limbs. Joint persistence 
in the Measures increased from 4 m to 10 m near the Ibstock Fault. 
In May 1978 on the highwall face of dip cut lID one NW-SE trending 
joint, filled with ankerite, was mappeq in the mudstone inter-
burden between the Yard and Lount seams. It was observed to have 
been displaced laterally in 1 to 2 em increments along both bedding 
planes and the clay band 2 m above the Yard seam. The apparent 
N-S movement is more likely to have been. caused by post-Triassic 
tectonic flexure of the sequence rather than any rebound or 
subsidence resulting from mining activities. Joint apertures of 
up to 40 mm were evident in the central dip cut area at the 
syncline base with up to three phases of contained mineral infill 
(calcite, ankerite followed by sphalerite or pyrite), Wood (1979). 
No evidence of solution effects or cavities were observed in the 
infill. Staining was not extensive except within a'few metres

above the old workings. Within 100 m of the Ibstock Fault the 
infill was observed to be a uniform, dark grey clay in apertures 
of 20 to 60 mm with no traces of mineralization. The NE-SW 
trending joints were generally more closely spaced, intensifying 
from a 2 m spacing in the southern mine area to 0.5 m in 
proximity to the IbstoCk Fault. They were planar, smooth, 
closed and unfilled, although in close proximity to the Ibatock 
Fault they were observed witn an aperture of 2 mm with some clay 
infill. 
Two main lpcalized structural variations from the overall 
synclinal structure were evident in the mine. An anticlinal 
structure trending NNE-SSW was observed to have developed from 
localised flexure of the Lount seams reducing in intensity with 
depth into the underlying Measures. This developed from a tWin 
structure in southerly cuts, see Figure 3.l9A, to a more intense 
single fold in the syncline basin, see Figure 3.19B and Platea 
3.20 and 3.21. It had completely disappeared within 100 m of 
the Ibatock Fault. The coincidence of old workings in seams 
on the fold limbs. and prescence of clay bands promoted the 
formation of unstable wedges in the Lounts benCh wall on the 
western fold limb in three successive strike cuts, see Section 
The second structural variation comprised a marked cross-
bedding of the mudstone-siltstone inteTburden between the Uppe~ 
Low Main seam and the Nether Lount seam, see Plate 3.1. This 
resulted in increased bedding dips within the interburden of 
up to 120 in a north-easterly direction and affected the 
stability of dip cut mining as detailed in Section 3.6.2. 
- 147 -
Plate 3.1: General view westward of strike cut l4a, November 1978 
3.3: Mine Hydrology 
No piezometers were installed on the minesite except in 
connection with the west sidewall monitoring scheme, see Section 
3.6. It is thus only possible to comment on groundwater 
observations made within the mine excavation . Between 4.5 
and 8.0 M1 (1 to 2 mill. gallons) per day were pumped from 
the mine during its life via settling lagoons into the loca l 
River Sence. A large proportion of this quantity was derived 
from the freely draining old underground workings of the Heather 
Colliery (circa 1870),particularly from the lower seams (Yard 
and Low Main coals) at the basal area of the syncline. The 
River Sence originally meandered north to south, 2 m within its 
own flood plain, through the centre of the minesit e area and was 
diverted before excavation commenced so as to run down the 
eastern mine boundary, see Figure 3.1. (Stability problems 
- 148 -
arising during the diversion scheme are discussed in Section 3.5). 
The original valley of the River Sence comprised a zone where 
pre-Pleistocene erosion had removed the Permo-Trias down to a 
level within the Coal Measures. This ancient valley then 
accommodated later Pleistocene drift deposits in which the 
modern river valley developed. The resulting structure 
contributed to instability within the upper bench of the strike 
cut highwall, see Section 3.8. The basal Permo-Triassic beds 
(basal breccia overlain by sandstone) were pervious and channelled 
drainage into the River Sence at these horizons above the 
irregular, impervious Coal Measures unconformity which fell 
generally to the south-east. The Pleistocene drift was also 
pervious and similarly channelled groundwater upon the impervious 
upper Permo-Triassic marls. The major Coal Measures aquifer 
of the area comprised the Wingfield Flags, a 20 m thick sequence 
of thinly-bedded siltstones and sandstones, about 50 m below 
the Lower Low Main pavement seam. This exerted no apparent 
influence on the mine groundwater regime. The Flags within 
the syncline structure constituted on artesian source of water 
fed at their incrop from the Permo-Trias basal aquifer and 
extracted by borehole to the south of the mine. Seepage on 
the mine Coal Measures slope faces indicated that some mudstone 
sections, but more particularly seatearth and clay band horizons, 
acted as aquitards influencing slope drawdown characteristics. 
During examination of the Coal Measures involved in slope in-
stability against the Ibstock Fault, the Yard and Lount seat-
earths were observed to act as strong aquicludes with seepage 
based at the seatearth-coal interfaces, see Section 3.8. No 
artesian water was encountered during the mining of the site 
- 149 -
with the exception of those instances when the Lower Low Main 
pavement seatearth was inadvertently punctured during mining 
on the sourthern syncline limb. This contributed to loosewall 
instability as discussed in Section 3.7. The main water flow 
directions above the Coal Measures in the Permo-Trias and 
Pleistocene were controlled by the topography of the respective 
intervening unconformities. This resulted in flow into the 
length of the old River Sence valley and also towards the north-
eastern end of the Ibstock Fault on the northern mining limit. 
All fault gouge examined in the field appeared to act as aquitards. 
Jointing aperture and continuity within the Coal Measures 
indicated a lower secondary permeability than the open systematic 
joints within the basal Permo-Triassic sandstones. Old workings 
in the Lount, Yard and Low Main seams contributed significantly 
to drawdown characteristics of the Coal Measures in conjunction 
with the argillaceous aquitards. 
3.4: Mining Methods 
The main method was centred on approximately 700 m long strike 
cuts advanced to the north by the RB1260W walking drag1ine (80 m 
boom length, 24.5 cu m bucket capacity) set on the Lount seams 
bench. It thus operated in chop-down and dragging modes to reduce 
a 15-20 em high face, at 70-750 , above and below the Lounts bench, 
casting onto the main loosewall where a Manitowoc crawler drag-
line (5.4 cu m bucket capacity) was employed where necessary to 
pull-back and rehandle. Rehandling proved to be necessary at 
times to maintain the natural loosewall angle of repose of 350 
and the 20 m wide Low Main coaling strip. Initial loosewall 
instability, see Section 3.7, resulted in a change in mining 
- 150 -
method down the southern syncline limb whereby the RB1260W mined 
the Yard and Low Main seams by a series of 200 m long dip cut. 
worked up dip from east to west, see Figure 3.1. This entailed 
that the external sidewalls stood exposed and unbuttressed over 
their central 500 m length' at least to the Lount bench level for 
2 years, longer than originally planned. Sidewall stability 
problems, see Sections 3.5 and 3.6, may not have been so marked 
if this had not been the case. The common problem of haul road 
routing into the Low Main/Yard and Lount coaling areas also 
affected stability problems. Haul roads were sited along the 
sidewalls and instability of the loosewall tended to be concentrated 
at unconstrained loosewall corners where haul roads entered 
coaling areas. Some initial instability of early eastern dip 
cut highwall~ was remedied by ,employing the RBl260W with the 
extended bench method, see Section 3.6.2. 
The need to maintain the security of external sidewalls 
with this mining method was highlighted by a potentially serious 
west sidewall instability, see Section 3.6. This incident 
demonstrated the limited choice of remedial measures and in 
particular the excessive amount of time ,required for effective 
backfill buttressing in such a situation. The western sidewall 
was closely flanked by a public road, water mains and farm , 
buildings. Instability of the e~stern sidewall, see Section 3.5, 
threatened the security of the diverted River Sence within the 
minesite boundary. These external constraints are quite 
representative of the problem of surface mining within developed 
rural or urban areas in Britain. 
- 151 -
In the final mining phase the logic of using the Ibstock 
Fault as the northern boundary became questionable as a series 
of final strike cut highwall failures occurred against the 
fault, see Section 3.8. Siting the main mine overburden mound 
over the zone of the fault also compounded the problems of 
instability. The original mine plan was to strike cut up 
to the fault. The cut orientation entailed that this occurred 
first at the eastern end of the fault and at this location the 
first of a sequence of failures was encountered. Short dip 
cuts were temporarily adopted to work along the fault westward 
and then the original strike cut system was readopted with the 
subsequent onset of final highwall instability problems. 
Employing dip cuts and working along the fault line would have 
minimized the length of exposed final highwall at any point in 
time. The situation was complicated by the planned siting of 
the northern extension of the minesite whose southern external 
slope was planned to correspond to the fault line. A possible 
alternative mine plan would have been to place the northern 
mine boundary to the north of the fault line and thus work 
through Fhe fault to leave a final highwall in stable ground. 
This, however, would still not have altered the fact that the 
Ibstock Fault complex presented an inherently unstable structuTe, 
not readily amenable to large dragline operations. 
Old underground workings were heaviest in the Low Main coal 
bottom leaf with typically 30% solid, 50% gob slack and 20% 
wotking voids. The overlying Yard seam on the eastern side of 
the minesite, where directly overlying the Low Main coal, was 
used for development headings which stood well at a 1.8 m 
height with very little timber support. The only serious 
- 152 -
collapse of Low Main coal workings was encountered on the east 
end of the strike cut highwall as detailed in Section 3.8. 
Security of the drag1ine was not threatened on the Lounts bench 
by any void migration above the Yard or Low Main coal.. The 
bottom leaf of the Nether Lount seam was next heaviest worked. 
typically with .25 m solid top leaf. 1.0 m solid middle leaf 
and 1.0 m bottom leaf with 70% gob slack and 30% working voids. 
The Middle Lount was only sporadically worked in the centre of 
the minesite. Workings mainly comprised short 10ngwa11 panels 
with subsidiary room and pillar areas. Particular contribution 
of old mine workings to slope stability is discussed in more 
detail in later sections. 
3.5: Stability of the Eastern Highwall 
The working of the mine required the diversion of the River 
Sence along a route parallel to the eastern highwall. The 
diversion was initially attempted by excavating a channel in 
the Permo-Trias marl overburden. Circular rotational failures 
developed within one week of exposure in the Channel walls cut 
at 340 (1 in 11) and again at an amended slope of 180 (1 in 3). 
Concern over the long-term stability of the diversion led to 
the adoption of a buried 1.65 m diam~ter concrete-sectioned 
culvert to carry the diversion.. Within 6 months of creation 
of the sidewall, whiCh defined the eastern side 'of the initial 
dip cut mining boxcut, instability developed over a SO m length 
of the wall. This was first reported on 11/10/1977 (case number 
301) and is detailed in Plate 3.2 and Figure 3.3. The Coal 
Measures true dip in the area was SO to 3.60 (1 in 11 to 1 in 16) 
to the north east, subparallel to the sidewall crest. The

failure mechanism was multi-planar and based at its toe on the 
Nether Lount seatearth. The sequence above the Lount seams 
comprised mainly thinly-bedded mudstones, contorted and 
softened to a depth of 5 m below the Permo-Trias unconformity. 
This softened zone was encountered later in the eastern highwall 
i~stability of November 1978 reported in Section 3.8.3. Movement 
of the failure mass revealed an underlying failure plane at its 
mid-height consisting of a uniform, plastic, light grey clay 
gouge, from 10 to 15 em thick, dipping at 450  Table 3.2 
reports the index properties tested on the gouge. Mapping 
beneach the gouge revealed that the Lount seams had been 
downthrown westward at this plane by 2 m. The existence of 
such a normal fault in this location had not been noted from 
exploratory drilling or surveys in mine workings. The Nether 
Lount, Yard and Low Main seams had been workedheavily under 
the failure zone, see Figure 3.3, but no evidence of void 
migration above any of these seams could be observed. It 
seems unlikely that such marked downthrow and thickness of 
gouge could have been generated as an overbreak feature, however, 
during void migration above old workings. Explanation of the 
confinement of the instability to above the Lount level on the 
sidewall may be partly explained by the existence of adequately 
low shear strength seatearths under the Lount seams. A major 
compo~ent of the failure mass was mudstone backfill, used in 
the construction of the river diversion, which appeared to be 
saturated and remoulded. Plate 3.2 illustrates the significant 
lipping which developed within a week of the original faiiure, 
in its backscar surface. The lipping was concentrated on a 
softened mudstone bedding plane, 2 m above the Middle Lount 
- 155 -
seam. It extended from the bedding plane incrop below the 
Permo-Trias for some 100 m northwards along the sidewall with 
reducing intensity. It apparently represented displacement 
derived from rebound within the upper 5 m of mudstones. These 
were softened and broken from weathering in the proximity of 
the overlying unconformity as well as displaying a marked 
contorted and sheared structure, see Plate 3.3. Similar 
features were observed within the same sequence in the eastern 
main higbwall, see Section 3.8.3 where the possibility of it 
being of penecontemporaneous origin is discussed.

Rainfall recorded on site over this period is detailed in 
Table 3.3 and shows the significant rise in rainfall recorded 
in the two weeks preceding the failure. The influence of loose 
fill in the diversion cutting close to the slope crest may have 
led to high water pressures on the fault plane and reduced the 
overall strength of the failure plane. Back-analysis of the 
failure conducted by bi-planar and Fellenius methods is detailed 
in Table 3.4. The latter method gives indications of an 
inherently less stable failure configuration but this results 
from the inabiLity to fit a circular base to the failure. The 
bi-planar analysis indicates that limiting equilibrium would 
have existed along the failure plane at a cohesion range of 
0-50 kN/m2 and friction angle range of 30 to 400  
Six months after the initial east sidewall failure a 
further 60 m length of wall became unstable, first reporte'd on 
22/4/1978 (case number 302), see Figure 3.3. The failure 
mechanism was again multi-planar, threatening the river 
diversion. It was a deeper-seated failure. however, and 
day lighted just above the Nether Lount seam. The failure zone 
again comprised weak poorly-compacted backfill and mudstone. 
representing a northward l,ongitudinal extension of the previous 
failure (case 301). The mudstone true dip was 10 at N640E 
and failure daylighted on a mudstone bedding plane along which 
seepage and clay infill were evident. The sidewall by this 
point in time had been backfill buttressed up to the Lount 
seams and no signs of distress were.observed below this horizon. 
Similar fault clay gouge was observed in the exposed base 
failure plane. Rainfall recorded on site over the period is 
reported in Table 3.3. Onset of failure does correlate to an

increase in rainfall and this may have triggered the ultimate 
movement. Further northward progression of instability was 
constrained by the intact corner of the main strike cut to 
the north. The increased lateral extension of this second 
failure was possible related to the divergence of the river 
diversion cutting eastward from the sidewall crest and north-
east trend of the apparent normal fault. 
The failure has been back-analysed by the bi-planar and 
Fellenius methods, see Table 3.5. Better agreement between 
these two sets of results was gained due to the closer resemblance 
of the failure surface to a circular path. The s~ear strength 
along the failure plane at limiting equilibrium was indicated 
to be 25 to 300 in friction angle up to a cohesion of SO kN/m2 
One year later a more serious failure developed in the 
east sidewall (case 303), on 2/4/1979. This involved a 70 m 
length of sidewall and extended eastward into the adjacent 
top soil dump, see Figure 3.4. The river diversion culvert 
within the failure mass was ruptured and displaced 4 m west-
ward. The failure was located in the north-eastern corner of 
the mine within 40 m of the Ibstock Fault and as a consequence 
the Coal Measures were beginning to rise north-eastwards at 
around 50 in the area of the instability. The failure, however, 
appeared to be based close to the Permo-Trias base. Groundwater 
flow, in the Permo-Trias controlled by the basal aquifer and 
Coal Measures unconformity, was concentrated towards this 
north-eastern mine corner. The failure debris appeared to be 
saturated, although this could well have been attributed to 
leakage into the mass once the culvert had been displaced.

The location of the top soil mound surcharge and the diversion 
cutting also enhanced the possibility of failure. The failure 
also coincided with the areal extent of old workings in the 
Nether Lount seam, only 12 m below the failure base. This 
would appear to be more than coincidental and an overbreak 
pattern associated with old workings collapse could have reduced 
the constraints to failure, disrupted the culvert and defined 
the areal extent of failure. Table 3.3 shows the rainfall 
during the period. Very high and prolonged rainfall appears 
to be linked to the propagation of the failure. In the two 
prior sidewall failures, inspection within the culvert di4 not 
reveal any obvious leakage into the adjacent ground. This 
could not be claimed in the instance of this third instability 
and the possibility exists that caving of the Nether Lount 
workings,activated by excavation of the sidewall or loading 
induced by top soil dumping,may have.caused culvert rupture 
and leakage into the Permo-Trias and upper Coal Measures, 
with subsequent increase in already high groundwater pressurel. 
The indicated shear strength along the failure plane at limiting 
equilibrium from a back-analysis using the Fellenius and bi-
planar methods, lee Table 3.6, is a friction angle of 10 to 200 
over a cohesion range uP.to 50 kN/m
 Back-analysis indica~es 
that the failure surface would ha~e possessed much lower shear 
strength values and been influenced by higher groundwater 
pressures than existed in the earlier sidewall failures 301 
and 302. This may be related to a greater length of the surface 
being located at the Permo-Trias unconformity, possibly in the 
underlying weathered Coal Measures zone,and the rupture of 
the river diversion culvert.

The three cases of instability, 301 to 303, all exhibited 
certain common features: 
- preceded by heavy rainfall, 
- backscars located within the R. Sence diversion cutting, 
- underlain by old workings in the Nether Lount seam, 
- confinement to above the Lounts bench. 
The latter two features may be. related if collapse over the 
Nether Lount old workings was a major contributory factor 
initiated by slope rebound. The location of the river 
diversion culvert and top soil dump (case 303) in such close 
proximity to the sidewall crest appears to have contributed 
to instability. Culvert leakage at the onset of deformation 
into loose channel backfill must also have accelerated the 
failure process. The identification of the tendency for shear 
failure in a 5 m deep zone of weathered mudstone,immediately 
below the PeDno-Trias cover was also to be made in fu~ther 
instability on the east side of the mine, see Section 3.8.3. 
3.6: Stability of the Western Sidewall 
During the working life of the mine six major factors 
contributed to a sequence of instability incidents along the 
central section of the western external sidewall: 
- weak clay band horizons below the Upper Lount Rider, Middle 
Lount and Nether taunt seams, associated with seatearths, and 
Just above the Middle Lount and Yard seams in mudstones; 
- 164 -
- a large catchement area draining to this section of the wall, 
from which a watercourse originally ran to the River Sence 
in the centre of the minesite; 
- two high angle normal faults traversing the western half of 
the minesite oblique to the sidewall; 
- localised steepening of bedding associated with the above 
faults, resulting in dips into the excavation; 
- old underground wOTkings in the Nether Lount, Yard and Low 
Main seams; 
- the amended working method of strike cuts down dip to the 
Lount seams, followed by dip cuts down to the Lower Low 
Main pavement worked east to west, which resulted in an 
exposure life for the sidewall section in excess of two 
years, see Section 3.4. 
3.6.1: Initial Sidewall Instability, 1977 
On 23/10/1977 a large pentahedral wedge failure occurred 
in . the west sidewall, case number 304, see Figure 3.5. This 
was to provide the first evidence ofthe significance of a 
fault traversing the sidewall dipping at 500 to 700 northwards, 
which was to cause serious concern later in August 1978. The 
wedge was delineated to the south by the fault plane, which 
intersected with a composite northern plane comprising joint 
faces and intact rock bridges. The line of intersection, 
~ipping at 480 , did not daylight on the face and the wedge 
was based at the seatearth horizon of the Nether Lount seam. 
Plate 3.4 shows the wedge failure viewed from the north-east

on 5/11/1977. Mean dips and dip directions from field mapping 
are detailed in Figure 3.5. The fault was smoothly undulating 
with a 40 mm thick gouge, comprising finely brecciated Coal 
Measures mudstone and siltstone. Slickenlines on the gouge 
dipped at 470 in a direction NaSoE, subparallel to the line 
of intersection of the wedge side planes. This apparent direction 
of movement co~responded to the local mapped true dip direction 
of the Nether Lount seam and the alignement of the failure 
debris. The southern extent of the fault plane had peeled 
away as a -I m thick block to reveal a second minor" fault of 
s~lar attitude. A large area of the exposed fault faces was 
smeared with Permo-Trias clay, which might have been washed down 
into the faults upon their dilation due to any rebound arising 
from mining. Ingress of groundwater into the open areas of 
the fault from the overlying Permo-Trias may have contributed 
to instability. The base of the Permo-Trias was observed to 
provide a large issue of water to the wedge debris. Locally 
a seepage line within the Coal Measures was observed to 
coincide with a clay band 4 m above the Middle Lount seam, 
discussed later in section 3.7 related to its occurrence in 
mine highwail slopes. Table 3.3 indicates that 33 mm of 
rainfall was recorded on site in the preceding month although 
only 4 mm was recorded in the week immediately preceding 
failure. Two unlined drainage ditches were located on the 
slope crest in close proximity to the wedge and these are 
thought to have also contributed water to the underlying 
slope. As remedial practice a backfill buttress carrying 
a haul road was quickly placed at the foot of the wedge, 
developing no short term signs of distress, see Plate 3.5a.

The orientation of slickenLines, side plane intersection 
line, seam true dip and failure debris indicated that shearing 
had occurred primarily on the basal seatearth. The northern 
plane exhibited little evidence of shearing along joints and 
only limited breakage through intact 'rock, the latter principally 
through the Coal Measures strata. Exposure of drift-smeared 
joints in the upper face of the northern plane suggested that 
they had determined the initial location and orientation of 
the northern failure face. Initial failure appeared to 
have been precipitated by high groundwater levels within the 
side planes and base, which promoted shear movement eastward 
with the requisite tensile breakage through intact rock bridges 
on the northern planes' Coal Measures mudstones and siltstones. 
After initial fa~lure the wedge itself fragmented into several 
large. rigid blocks moving down the true dip of the base with 
the bulk of the mass rotating to the rear and sliding on the 
southern fault plane. The Nether Lount underlying the wedge 
had been worked from underground up to the fault, see Figure 
3.14, but no direct evidence could be gained of their extent 
within the slope or whether closure of these workings had 
contributed to failure. 
The next incident of instability on;the sidewall occurred 
50 m north from the wedge location on 5/1l/1977,after the 
strike cut highwall to the base of Upper Lount seam had 
exposed the wall at that point in September 1977. This 
instability, (case number 305), comprised a shallow planar 
failure eastward and orthogonal to the line of the sidewall, 
see Plates 3.6 and 3.7. The basal plane corresponded to a

weak clay band in the Upper Lount Rider seam seatearth, 0.5 m 
below the Coal Measures unconformity. Details of index and 
shear tests on samples of this horizon are contained in 
Table 3.2. A 70 m length of mainly Permo-Triassic beds 
comprised the eventual affected mass, see Figures 3.9 and 
3.10. These consisted of soft, saturated marls with a central 
2 m thick bed of massive, coarse-grained sandstone, underlain 
by aIm thick bed of soft, pervious basal breccia. The 
sandstone contained two joint sets dipping at SOo to 900 
with dip directions of 050
and 3400 , each with a consistent 
2 m spacing. All of these joints displayed apertures of 
20 to 60 mm, some with remoulded marl infill but apparently 
providing high hydraulic continuity between containing marl 
horizons. Table 3.3 indicates the onset of heavy rainfall 
in November 1977 whiCh undoubtedly contributed to the 
instability. Locally the Permo-Trias dipped at.OSo due 
east and the basal failure plane was mapped at its toe, 
see Plate 3.7, as dipping from 100 to 17
due east on the 
Upper Lount Rider seatearth. Table 3.7 reports a back-analysis 
undertaken using the plane failure method under varying ground-
water conditions with a base inclination of 10. This data 
indicates that the peak shear strength of the seatearth clay 
band, see Table 3.2, would not have been sufficient under 
high groundwater pressures to maintain stability. The 
residual shear strength, see Table 3.2, would correspondingly 
have been inadequate to prevent failure under moderate 
groundwater pressures.

3.6.2: Stability of Dip Cut Highwalls 
The next episode of instability was again related to the 
fault involved in the earlier wedge failure detailed in 
Section 3.6.1. During the period following that failure 
dip cuts were worked westward from a boxcut against the 
east sidewall to recover the Yard and Low Main seams, see 
Figure 3.1. The fault was encountered in all dip cuts 
westward from cut 90. 
The stability of the dip cut highwalls, as excavated 
westward will now be discussed since events occurring during 
their mining involved factors relating to the subsequent 
episodes of instability on the west external sidewall. The 
first factor constituted a weak shear, 2 to 5 m above the Yard 
seam, concordant to cross-bedding structure in the mudstone 
interburden, see Section 3.2 and Plate 3.1. 
Such a zone was first identified in the highwall of dip 
cut 3D in November 1977 by distinct lipping, see Plate 3.S, 
constituting from 5 DID to 15 mill of bedding plane shear 
displacement. Only a slight trace of clay gouge was seen 
on this zone which generally comprised a smooth, polished 
bedding plane, see .Plate 3.9. The IS m high face, cut at 
7So , appeared to be well drained with no evidence of seepage 
occurring along the shear zone. Table 3.3 details the rainfall 
recorded on site over this period . The Yard seam old workings 
underlying the slope at the time were seen to stand well as 
1.8 m high development headings with no evidence of overlying 
void migration. No tension cracks appeared on the Lounts

bench. The instability appeared to have been promoted by excavating 
a haul road down into the base coaling area from the Lounts bench 
at the down dip corner of the dip cut, i.e. the highwall - endwall 
corner. This reduced the down-dip constraint to failure whilst 
the up dip constraint was also weak, comprising backfill from 
prior strike cut mining down to the Low Main pavement. The 
possibility exists that this backfill may have been unstable 
and generated an additional downdip loading onto the dip cut 
highwall. Advancement to full failure of the bench was effectively 
terminated by adopting an extended bench method with the RB1260W 
dragline. 
More significant dip cut instability, case number 306, occurred 
on a similar horizon on 22/4/1978 in dip cut llD, see Figure 3.6A, 
except that a dark grey, plastic, clay band was evident at the 
basal failure plane, 10 to 15 mm thick. The RB1260W was at the 
time in the process of cutting the 10w-wall at the up-dip end of 
the cut and thus a promontory block, 30 m by 30 m in plan,was 
unsupported on its downdip side. Deformation continued with time 
until failure occurred on 25/4/1978, being confined to the east 
by the loosewall and delineated in plan by the NNE joint-controlled 
backscar. Translational sliding on the basal clay band had 
occurred which, due to the attitude of the local interburden 
cross-bedding J dipped at 10
in a direction N600 E, i. e. into 
the cut. The cut wall appeared to be well-drained with only 
slight seepage on the clay band horizon. Underlying old mine 
workings did not appear again to have contributed tQ the failure. 
Table 3.3 details the rainfall recorded on site over this period.

.is reported in Table 3.8 for this failure. It indicates that 
failure implied a very low shear strength existing on the bedding 
failure plane. In the bi-p1anar analysis the upper failure plane 
was assigned a cohesion of 25 kN/m
and frictionmgle of 300 , based 
on laboratory saw-cut siltstone direct shear testing. This indicated 
that a minimum friction angle of 180 with zero cohesion would have 
been necessary on the base surface to maintain equilibrium.

A third, similar instability, case number 307, developed 
on 5/5/1978 in the subsequent l2D dip cut. This again involved 
a clay band above the Yard seam conforming to the mudstone 
cross-bedding at a dip of 9
ESE, see Figure 3.6B. A 45 m 
length of the dip cut highwall was involved in the failure, in 
which the backscar area gave the impression of the backward tilt 
associated with a rotational failure mechanism. This derived 
from the fact that the majority of the wall involved in the 
failure comprised backfill above the Lount seam level, previously 
mined by strike cuts and in place for about 12 months. 
Deformation along the clay band had triggered the backfill 
failure. Inspection of the clay band at one location in the 
wall revealed that it had caused the dislocation of ankerite 
infill within a systematic joint, dipping 84
in a direction 
0660 , see the discussion on jointing in ~ection3.2. This 
dislocation of 2 em was into the north wall and provided 
evidence of recent movement on the clay band unlikely to be 
attributable to mining activity. The Yard seam had been heavily 
mined from old underground workings in the area but collapse 
features in the highwall were not evident. Table 3.3 indicates 
that heavy rainfall did not appear to relate to initiating this 
failure. Table 3.9 reports on a bi-planar and planar back-
analysis of this failure. The bi-planar method again employed 
saw-cut siltstone shear strength data on the upper failure plane. 
This resulted in an indicated minimum friction angle of 220 at 
zero cohesion on the lower failure plane, under dry conditions, 
in order to maintain equilibrium. It also demonstrated the 
potential influence of groundwater pressure which, as indicated,

would have necessitated an increase of up to 100 in the friction 
angle to maintain equilibrium. 
All three aforementioned dip cut incidents placed the 
RB1260W dragline at risk and showed its limited flexibility and the 
stability hazards associated with dip cut working. Similar clay 
band horizons above the Yard seam were identified westwards from 
dip cut 11D up to dip cut IsD. Their development from a non-
gouge zone in the eastern dip cuts to persistent 10 to 15 mm 
thick dark grey, uniform clay bands westwards indicates a 
tentative relationship with the proximity to the NW-SE faulting 
mentioned earlier in this section. Unfortunately, lack of access 
to some dip cut faces for detailed inspection prevents more 
concrete conclusions to be made. They may represent clay drapes 
within the cross-bedding of the mudstone/siltstone interburden 
or gouge developed from tectonically induced bedding plane 
slippage. This same NW-SE fault,.linked to the external west 
sidewall wedge failure of October 1977, was encountered westward 
in all dip cuts from cut 9D onwards. In cuts 9D, lOD and lID 
it initially resembled a possible monocline or roll structure 
in coaling areas. Instability was always associated with the 
fault in the dip cut highwalls and would initially develop with 
the formation of a couloir,where a small tetrahedral wedge had 
slid down the fault plane freed by dilation of mudstone joints, 
within one or two days of exposure. Plate 3.10 shows the 
formation of such a couloir in cut 13D with the Yard seam ~s a 
roof. It also shows the localised steenening of the Low Main 
seams in the proximity to the fault in the coaling area. A 
similar wedge slid and toppled on the fault plane in cut lsD. 
- 177 -
On 5/7/1978 it measured only 1 m high by 1 m wide by 1 m deep, 
but two days later it had developed to 7 m by 5 m by 3 m 10 s1ze, 
breaking up to the Lounts' bench level. The failure had extended 
by 12/7/1978 to a block size 18 m by 30 m by 15 m, see Figure 3.7 
and Plate 3.11 . During May , June and July 1978 little rainfall 
was recorded on site and no significant role appeared to have 
been played by groundwater in the development of these tetrahedral 
wedge failures, see Table 3.10 .

Summer 1978 . 
The wedge failure debris in the cuts was always dry and no 
evidence of high water pressures was evident on excavation through 
the footwall of the fault. Mapping of the fault in the cuts 
indicated that its dip ranged from 55
to 65
in a direction of 
0600 to 0650~simi1ar in character to its structure in the original 
west external sidewall of October 1977. The fault exposed in the 
cuts contained a 4 em thick layer of soft brecciated mudstone 
gouge with a highly polished upper surface. It was a normal 
fault which in fact was observed in dip cut 13D to split into 
two subparallel normal faults each with a 2 m northward downthrow, 
intensifying to 6 m by cut 16D. The fault when initially 
- 180 -
encountered in cuts 10D and 11D resembled a simple monocline. 
Previous strike cuts 3B and 4B had encountered another subparallel 
NW-SE normal fault with a northward down throw also intensifying 
westward, 30 m to the south. The original geological plan for 
the minesite did not indicate the identification of these faults 
prior to working. Their existence was identified, however, by 
exploration drilling west of the minesite in 1957, see Figure 3.8, 
and indicated their convergence near Thorntree Farm and the 
subsequent development of a single fault with a 17 m downthrow. 
In dip cuts l5D and 16D the bedding dips increased to 160 in the 
fault hanging wall and footwall strata,with localised steepening 
and thinning developing within a distance of 10 m. Mining dip 
cuts down dip rather than up dip towards the fault would have 
reduced its effect on stability in the cut, provided the southern 
100sewa11 possessed adequate stability. If a fault produces a 
sharp throw of strata, with little steepening of strata dips on 
either side, then this presents a less hazardous structure for 
stability than a less abrupt disruption of strata, but with more 
pronounced steepening of strata dips. 
It is considered significant that, at the time of the cut l5D 
failure, signs of distress were apparent in the backfill, placed 
150 m to the west against the original west sidewall wedge failure 
10 months before. The backfill moved some 5 em over a week into 
the cut, based some 2 m above the Lount seams level, see Plate 3.11. 
The failure mass was clearly defined by seepage corresponding to 
the base of the original wedge void. The possibility exists that 
at this time some displacement on the faults was occurring over a 
wider area. Strains resulting from such displacement were witnessed

5 weeks later in the form of surface cracking outside the mine 
boundary as discussed in Section 3.6.3. Visible signs of related 
deformation were not noted at the time in this area. It must be 
said, however, that there appeared to be no obvious need to search 
for such signs at the time. The possibility exists that the 
wedge backfill deformation was due to developing high water 
pressures,derived from seepage originating from the Permo-Trias 
and surface run off (16 mm of rain had been recorded in the 
previous week). 
Another fault-based wedge failure occurred whilst mining dip 
cut l6D, the final and westernmost cut, on 10/8/1978. The wedge 
involved the ground through to the original, buttressed west 
sidewall failure, case 304. It forced the abandonment of the 
l6D cut for fear of promoting a deeper seated failure at the 
Low Main seam level, see Figures 3.9 and 3.10 (Section D-D'). 
Evidence relating to the base of the failure was sparse due to 
the large volume of debris consisting partly of the original 
sidewall backfill buttress above the Lount seams. The indicated 
mode of failure was translational sliding of a 60 m long by 5 m 
high by 20 m wide block in front of the base of the original 
sidewall wedge void, surcharged by the wet backfill placed in 
that void. Sliding appeared to be based at a horizon above the 
Yard seam, possibly coincident with a clay band shear zone as 
previously identified in dip cut workings discussed earlier. 
The southern limit of the failure block was clearly the NW-SE 
fault plane extending below the Lount seams level. Plate 3.Sb 
shows the failure viewed from the east on 14/8/1978. Longitudinal 
rotation of the failure block occurred whereby the southern end 
- 183 -
of the block slid down and away from the fault plane, with apparently 
less constraint than the northern end, which required some breakage 
through intact rock to afford displacement. This mechanism bears 
resemblance to some fault-based failures observed at other mines, 
e.g. cases 204, 205, 206 and 214 in Chapter 2. 
Table 3.10 shows the dry summer experienced up to August 1978 
and the heavy rainfall, 77 mm, recorded on minesite in the three 
week period preceding the reoccurrence of the west sidewall 
instability. The old wedge backfill developed a high moisture 
content and moved with the continuation of rain in the manner of 
an earth flow. 
3.6.3: Final Sidewall Instability, 1978 
3.6.3.1: Instability History 
During the period that dip cut l5D was being mined,a shallow 
seated circular rotational failure occurred in the Permo-Trias of 
the west sidewall crest opposite Thorntree Farm, see Figures 3.9 
and 3.10 (section A-A'). This failure, case number 308, had 
developed over a three week period to its fullest extent by 
29/9/1978. Its location was just north of the previous shallow 
crest failure, case number 305, discussed in Section 3.6.1, but 
it was not based on any single planar bedding feature and was 
confined to the Permo-Trias. A number of similar failures had 
occurred in the Permo-Trias during forward reduction work on the 
site. The possibility, however, exists that this failure was 
related to the events initiating the major block instability 
just to the south on the sidewall at this time. Back-analysis

The final and most serious episode in the history of the 
west sidewall instability will now be analysed, case number 309. 
On 20/8/1978 settlement was noted to have occurred on a line 
across the Ravens tone Road whilst coaling of the Yard seam was 
underway in the final dip cut, 160. This settlement extended 
into a field in the adjacent Thorntree Farm as a linear crack 
with an initial maximum vertical down throw of 80 mm to the 
north-east, see Figure 3.9. The settlement across the Ravenstone 
Road required subsequent ramp resurfacing on twenty occasions. 
Over the following seven months the maximum crack displacement 
rose to 480 mm vertical and 250 mm horizontal. The initial 
movement must be assumed to have developed overnight. The large 
size of the bloc~,delineated by such a linear crac~ supported 
an initial hypothesis that deformation was due to settlement 
over old underground workings in the Lountand Yards seams which 
had terminated on encountering the fault. Figure 3.11 shows 
an isometric view of the affected area of the sidewall drawn 
from borehole data. It clearly shows the marked localised 
steepening of the bedding over the southern extent of the 
fault in the sidewall. 
Concern over the security of the slope, road and farm prompted 
the initiation of an intensified precise survey monitoring scheme 
by the N.C.B. This involved the monitoring of both horizontal 
and vertical displacement of survey stations along the Ravenstone 
Road, crack bolts traversing the crack in the field and points 
on the farm buildings, see Figure 3.9. Survey data indicated 
significant deformation continuing through September and October 
1978. In order to clarify the failure mechanism and aid

assessment of the likelihood of catastrophic failure the Mining 
Engineering Department were requested to install further monitoring 
instrumentation, undertaken by G. Young and the author in November 
1978. Plate 3.12 shows a view of the sidewall from the loosewal1 
to the south-east and the initial work of backfill buttressing 
in progress against its face. The anticipated 4 month duration 
of this activity to provide effective total support contributed to 
the concern over the 60 m high sidewall security. 
The University scheme comprised three borehole extensometers 
(El to E3) and nine ground tilt stations (Tl to T9), see Figure 
3.9. A continuity indicator was installed in extensometer borehole 
E1 to a depth of 26 m, Young (1979). The extensometers were of 
the constant-tension strain wire type with four anchor points 
spaced between the seams, see Plate 3.13. A continuous-recording 
ground tilt station was also installed on the down throw side of 
the crack in the field on 9/2/1979, see Plates 3.14 and 3.15. 
Two piezometers, P4 and P5 in Figure 3.9, were also installed 
by the N.C.B. in November 1979. These were single Casagrande 
standpipe piezometers with tips placed at the base of the Nether 
Lount seam (P4) and 8 m below the Nether Lount seam (PS). Young 
(1979) has described the monitoring scheme in detail and a 
broader overview of the incident has been reported by Leigh, 
ScobIe and Young (1980). 
Lack of space on the slope confined the borehole instrumentation 
to the slope crest. Unfortunately, no safe access was available 
to any area of the slope face. Throughout the monitoring period 
this prevented either close examination of the face or the 
installation of monitoring face stations as undertaken on the 
Lowther mine highwall, see Chapter 4. 
- 190 -
The deformation characteristics of the instability derived 
by monitoring were as follows: 
1. From July 1978 to March 1979 the survey stations on the 
Ravenstone Road, see Figure 3.9, always exhibited a larger 
horizontal and vertical displacement with increased southerly 
location, towards the fault plane. This feature also 
applied to the crack bolts and extensometer heads, see 
Figures 3.12 and 3.13. Good correlation was also evident 
in the data; for example, between November 1978 and January 
1979 the following settlements were observed - 190 mm for 
road station 2, 190 mm for crack bolt C and 200 mm for 
extensometer E1. Vertical and horizontal displacement 
rates also varied in parallel trends with time. From road 
station 12 soutbwards there was a marked increase in the 
magnitude of recorded displacements. This also applied to 
ground tilt station data. In February 1979 it was observed 
that the field crack was beginning to change its direction 
of extension from NW to NE, see Plate 3.14, heading for the 
slope crest in a direction which eventually would have taken 
it close to road station 12. 
These observations gave clear evidence that the instability 
comprised movement of a large, rigid block. This was bounded 
to the west by the extension of the NW-SE fault, encountered 
in the mine workings, and to the north by a developing NE-SW 
fracture. The b1ock,was rotating in plan anti-clockwise about 
a point lying between' the farm buildings and the slope crest. 
This mechanism bore some resemblance to that of the- original 
fault-bound wedge failure of October 1977.

2. The surveY,extensometer and ground tilt data all showed a 
pattern of cyclic movement. This is evident in Figures 3.12 
and 3.13. The cyclic pattern decreased in amplitude as the 
block equilibrium was established in April 1979. Broa4bent 
and Ko (1971) similarly reported observing that in large 
open-pit slope failures the displacement-time function to 
ultimate failure consisted of exponential decay curves. 
They proposed that such spasmodic behaviour could be 
attributed to changes in disturbing forces due to rising 
groundwater levels resulting from rainfall, excavation events 
or blasting and seismic vibrations. No such distinctly 
spasmodic behaviour has been previously reported for British 
Coa1 Measure slopes. The west sidewall instability represents 
one of the largest, estimated at 200000 cu m,which has been 
observed in British mines. The failures reported by Broadbent 
and Ko related to open-pit slopes in generally more competent 
rock types. The similarity in behaviour may be related to 
the resemblance in structural control over the failures, with 
the Coalfield rigid block sliding on a large area of fault. 
Zavodni and Broadbent (1980) attempted to quantify parameters 
associated with cyclic slide movement, comparing the 
displacement-time records of thirteen porphyry copper open 
pit slides, from 120000 to 3000000 tons in size. They 
defined two principal failure stages in their characteristic 
slope failure leading to total collapse: (a) Regressive 
Stage, during which the failure will re-stabi1ize if some 
external disturbance to the rock structure is removed: 
(b) Progressive Stage, during which the failure will 
gradually displace at an accelerating rate to the point 
- 194 -
of total collapse unless active control measures are taken. 
They noted that overall displacement records in bbth failure 
stages are apparently of simple exponential form with a 
definite break occurring at the onset-of-f~ilure point. 
This observation would comply with the famous characteristic 
exponential rise in monitored displacement rates leading to 
failure reported for the large Chuquicamata mine slide, 
Kennedy and Niermeyer (1970). The Coalfield data indicates 
that by November 1978 the failure had reached this Progressive 
Stage. The monitoring data showed that by March 1979 
equilibrium appeared to have been restored, most probably 
due to the growing effect of the backfill buttress operation, 
see Plate 3.11. 
A significant length of the sidewall block, about 50 m at the 
southern end of the rigid block,was in fact covered by a backfill 
buttress, the main loosewall, at the time the major crest cracking 
became first visible in August 1978. Sections CC' and DO' in 
Figur,e 3.9 indicate the buttress level by October 1978. The 
buttress unfortunately prevented observation of the wall in the 
fault outcrop area. The height of the sidewall and the location 
of the dip cut 16D void entailed that total buttressing would not 
be completed before February 1979. Since this appeared to be the 
only feasible remedial measure there was thus concern to attempt 
to establish with confidence the likelihood of catastrophic 
failure of the rigid block. During the winter 1978-79 a ~rack' 
continually reappeared running south-eastwards from the point 
where the main crest crack entered the backfill. Despite the 
addition of more backfill and compaction this backfill crack 
- 195 -
reappeared, aligned with the main crack, in sympathy with its 
activity. Opencast backfill deve100sa cohesive nature with time, 
Leigh and Rainbow (1979), and the load exerted by the face of 
the rigid block on the buttress could conceivably have promoted 
what at times comprised a 40 m long,crack supported by the 
backfill. 
The cyclic displacement of the failure block could be 
explained by the contribution of one or more of the following 
factors, dependent upon the actual mechanism of the failure: 
fault creep. 
spasmodic collapse of old undergound workings in proximity 
to the fault. 
variation in driving water forces related to rainfall and 
slope drainage. 
- consumption of energy during periods of active displacement 
due to secondary shearing of intact rock within the block, 
followed by a dormant period for the renewed accumulation 
of strain energy. 
periods of mining activity at the western end of the mine 
associated with dip cut 16D and subsequent strike cuts 13A 
and 14B. 
Whichever failure mechanism is postulated the block must have 
slid on a significant area of the fault. Cyclic block displacement 
may be explained by time dependent friction creating the stick-slip 
phenomenon, well established as a mechanism for shallow earthquakes 
along pre-existing faults. Dieterich (1972) and Amadei and Curran 
(1980) have reported studies of the time-dependent friction in 
- 196 -
rocks derived from direct shear laboratory testing. They reported 
that the coefficient of static friction for rocks increased with 
the logarithm of time that adjacent blocks remained in stationary 
contact and that this coefficient for surfaces with gouge exhibited 
a highly time-dependent behaviour. Spasmodic creep on the basal 
shear plane of the block and time-dependent breakage through intact 
rock bridges on the northern block restraining plane could both 
also have contributed to the cyclic displacement characteristics. 
On 22/2/1979 the continuous recording tiltmeter at the field crack 
recorded a spasm of displacement between 1530 hours and 2200 hours. 
In this period a backward tilt towards the fault of 0.16 mm/m 
developed until 2050 hours when a violent tilt caused the meter 
to momentarily record an off-scale value. This event coincided 
with a further extension of the field crack. Recorded rainfall 
had been very light in this month. This indicated that block 
displacement was occurring as short events linked to an overall 
cycle frequency of about 1 month. 
Old underground workings were mapped during coaling operations 
by the mine surveyors, in the Nether Lount, Yard and Low Main seams, 
see Figure 3.14. These workings all terminated along the line of 
each fault-seam intersection. Such mapping and exploratory drilling 
within the slope indicated that the old Nether Lount workings alone 
ran within the affected sidewall slope, working only ~p to the 
fault. Lee (1966) reported on a field study concerned with the 
underrated effect of faulting on mining subsidence. He concluded 
that differential movement is usually vertical, but that this can 
be accompanied by noticeable lateral and horizontal displacement. 
Initial contact with N.C.B. deep mining personnel established that

no deep contemporary workings underlay the slope. The remaining 
possibility then was that mining within the site had promoted 
differential settlement concentrated on the fault line due to 
reactivated subsidence of the Nether Lount seams. Inspection 
of the old Nether Lount workings had not revealed any significant 
overlying collapse features. The extensometer data recorded 
settlement, as well as shear activity, in the three boreholes 
but this could have been due to subsidence and/or the vertical 
component of shear down the steeply inclined bedding adjacent 
to the southern end of the fault, see Figures 3.10 and 3.11. 
The migration of groundwater from surface and the overlying 
basal Permo-Trias aquifer into the main tension crack may 
periodically have increased the overall disturbing force 
acting on the block and reduced the shear strength of the fault 
gouge. Similar dilation of discontinuities within the block 
may have allowed migration of groundwater into the block mass 
following periods of heavy rainfa1l,to increase the uplift 
water forces applying to any basal failure plane. The installed 
piezometers showed low static head values (1 to 1.5 m) with no 
significant variation related to rainfall. This may have been 
accounted for by the drainage afforded by old mine workings 
dipping into the mine excavation. The lack of data on ground-
water behind the fault and above the Lount seams does not 
permit any observation on the degree of hydraulic continuity 
behind the fault and above the Lount seams. Episodes of renewed 
block displacement do not correlate with heavy rainfall periods 
recorded on minesite. This w~u1d appear to discount any 
contribution to cyclic movement directly attributable to 
groundwater variation. 
- 199 -
Kvapil and Clews (1979} reported that cyclic displacements 
are a feature of their postulated Prandt1 mechanism of bearing 
capacity failure observed in some large open-pit failures. This 
they account for by alternating periods of internal rock breakage, 
consuming energy, and periods of calm during the subsequent 
accumulation of energy. 
3.6.3.2: Analysis of the Failure Mechanism 
Ground movement on the west sidewall adjacent to the fault 
may be attributed to one or any combination of four failure 
mechanisms, see Figure 3.15, which will now be considered. 
(i) Fault Creep Reactivated by Stress Relief Arising from 
Surface Mining Excavation 
This mechanism would require that displacement would affect 
a large area of the sidewall and could explain the periodic 
migration of the tension crack out into the backfill buttress. 
The fault defining the southern face of the rigid block was 
in fact accompanied by a second fault which cut the sidewall 
south of the block to meet the fault 108 m into the field and 
thence to continue as the single fault, see Figure 3.8. No 
visible ground deformation in the field provided any indication 
of this southerly sister fault,but cracking across the Ravenstone 
Road was observed in August 1978 coincident and aligned with its 
outcr~p position inferred from early drilling, see Figures 3.8 
and 3.9. This southerly road crack developed no additional 
displacement after August 1978. One week after its first 
appearance a major crack was discovered traversing the southern 
~ 200 -

- 201 -
end of the mine backfill and subsoil mound for over 300 m, see 
Figure 3.8 and Plate 3.16. The position and alignement of this 
crack corresponded closely to the southern fault. At this time 
the current mine workings, strike cut lIB, were 500 m north of 
this crack. The possibility of the crack representing the 
backscar of a large failure of the loosewall is considered to 
be remote, see Section 3.7. A less persistent, parallel crack 
was also observed to develop in August 1978 within the 10osewal~ 
70 m to the north. No further evidence of loosewa1l failure in 
the toe or intermediate slopes was- evident. These loosewal1 
cracks in common with the southern road crack did not develop 
any further after August 1978. The large linear loosewall crack 
would appear to be caused by a limited period of deformation of 
about one month along the line of the southern fault linked to 
the southern road crack. This deformation was initiated in late 
July 1978 at the time when the final dip cut 16D was working and 
the reactivated wedge failure occurred in the sidewall. 
Survey data shows that settlement was occurring along the 
Ravenstone Road in July 1978 before the cracking became evident 
in Thorntree Farm. This indicates that at the time of the 
reactivated sidewall wedge failure, triggered in July 1978 by 
mining cut l6D, movement was also occurring over a wider area 
where movement in the loosewa1l and crest area was associated 
with settlement along fault lines. These events indicate that 
by the excavation of dip cut l5D the sidewall had been sufficiently 
extended in depth to allow relaxation on both of the sister 
faults and that some deformation of the rigid block extending 
into the farm was occurring. The excavation of l6D would then

appear to have promoted the more marked cyclic deformation of 
the rigid block bounded by the northern fault. 
Survey points on Thorntree Farm house and barn from September 
1978 to March 1979 showed vertical displacements of from 45 mm to 
80 mm, whilst control points X and EP, 20 m and 50 m west of the fiel 
crack respectively, showed correspondingly lower values of 9 mm 
and 2 Mm. During the same period the survey crack bolts indicated 
differential vertical displacement of 367 mm at the southern end 
of the crack, reducing to 20 mm at the nqrthern end, where in fact 
the two bolts on the supposed stable southern edge of the crack 
scarp had themselves fallen an average of 84 mm over the.period. 
This indicates that settlement against the northern fault extended 
north-eastward beyond the visible crack whilst settlement in the 
vicinity of the southern fault was negligible. The barn lay 180 m 
west of the sidewall crest along the line of the northern fault. 
The developed change in trend of the field crack to the north-east 
did not represent simply the northern face of a single rigid block 
rotating into the min~ since settlement continued along the fault 
line past its north-western crack limit. The northern fault 
appeared to have been reactivated as far as 250 m along its length 
from the sidewall cres~ from observations on the farm buildings. 
From mid-September 1978 to February 1979 the road station 2 
on the southern rigid block area "displaced 368 mm vertically and 
252 mm eastward. This represents a declinaticn of 56
which 
compares closely with field-derived values for the north fault 
true dip. This indicates that movement simply down the dip of 
the north fault plane could account for the significant horizontal 
displacement monitored on the rigid block, although there is no 
- 203 -
direct measure of the fault dip within the sidewall. Locating 
the position of high angle faulting from seam displacement logged 
by exploratory drilling is'in itself an imprecise operation, but 
deriving fault dip angles is even more difficult. The interpretation 
of the sidewall drilling log from boreholes on a 30 m square grid 
to derive Figures 3.10 and 3.11 must, therefore, be viewed with 
this in mind and the precise details of the fault in the sidewall 
regarded as conjectural. 
Figure 3.16 shows the horizontal component and declination 
of the displacement for seven stations monitored on the sidewall, 
also for the period mid-September 1978 to February 1979. The true 
direction of movement cannot be derived since road station 
displacement was measured perpendicular to the road station line 
whilst the field crack displacements were measured perpendicular 
to the crack line. There is a marked increase southwards not only 
in horizontal displacement but in declination. If the block 
deformation derived solely from reactivation of the faulting 
mechanism, as depicted in Figure 3.lsA, then it should be expected 
that the values of movement declination on the down throw side 
should all lie in the range of 500 to 700 , since the fault 
maintained such a dip northwards. 
Unfortunately it was not possible to obtain settlement data 
at the fault exposure "in dip cut IsD or 16D coaling areas, which 
would have clarified the credibility of the hypothesis that 
reactivation of the fault played a major role in the instability.

(ii) Subsidence over Old Underground Workings 
Figure 3.14 shows the old workings mapped during coaling 
operations below the central west sidewall. Old workings in 
the Nether Lount and Yard seams entered the sidewall with the 
former seam carrying the heaviest working. Nether Lount workings 
were also encountered in boreholes E3 and PS during the 
instrumentation programme. In coaling areas the old workings 
were always seen to terminate abruptly against the fault on 
its downthrow side. No previous instances of old working 
subsidence promoting failure against a fault plane are known 
in surface coal mining. Lee (1966) only has reported on the 
concentration of ground strain which occurs with mining 
subsidence along fault lines. The features of the linear 
crack in the field resembled those reported in his survey of 
subsidence steps linked to faulting in South Yorkshire. It 
is possible that only incomplete convergence of the old workings 
on the downthrow side of the fault had occurred. Borehole PS 
reported on a 3.8 m high cavity in the Nether Lount seam. The 
removal of lateral constraint on the sidewall by mining may 
then have reactivated convergence, causing ground strain to be 
concentrated at the fault incrop. Lee reported on 4 case studies 
where earlier workings on the down throw side of faults created 
incomplete convergence which had remained until later underground 
workings on the opposite side reduced the stress across the fault 
plane to allow further movement - sliding down the plane. The 
steep dips of the Coal Measures at the southern end of the fault 
in the sidewall is another crucial factor which must ~e recognised . 
Caving in this area would possess a significant horizontal component 
- 206 -
and would fit the monitored survey data in the southern area of 
the block, see Figure 3.16. It would not, however, account for 
the lower declination and significant horizontal movement which 
occurred further north from the fault, e.g. road station 8 in 
Figure 3.16. The borehole extensometer data indicated that 
convergence occurred at the Nether Lount and Yard seams 
compensated by significant shear movement between these levels. 
The complex structural setting for the extensometers, suited 
to monitoring purely axial deformation, made the interpretation 
of data difficult. It is doubtful, however, whether the borehole 
inclinometer as an alternative would have given clearer results 
for any length of time if lateral shear movement of any 
significance was occurring across the boreholes. 
Subsidence then appears to have occurred in the southern block 
area. It is possible to conclude that this mechanism alone did 
not result in the overall area deformation. It would appear to 
have triggered the shear movement of the block, having been 
initiated itself by stress-relief arising from mining and possibly 
a wider reactivation of the fault as discussed earlier. It is 
conceivable that collapsed old workings provided a low shear 
strength zone conducive to shear displacement of the large block, 
particularly at its southern end. Finally it must also be 
recognised that original shear displacement of the block, along 
a basal horizon of old workings with incomplete convergence or 
another form of weak shear zone, may then have subsequently 
induced further collapse of old workings . The role of old 
workings collapse in the overall instability is conjectural 
without knowing the time when it occurred. This could only 
- 207 -
have been resolved if the borehole extensometers had been in 
place before deformation occurred along the fault. 
(iii) Translational Sliding along a Low Shear Strength Basal Plane 
Figure 3.lSC depicts this possibie failure mechanism whereby 
displacement of the rigid block could have occurred by sliding 
towards the void on one or more low shear strength planes. There 
is no reason to assume the simplification that the block's base 
was confined to a bedding structure. If the plan rotary movement 
of a single block towards the void is accepte~then a single base 
plane must have existed below the block though not necessarily 
conforming to bedding. The structural geology of the sidewall 
and the monitored survey data, see Figures 3.10, 3.11 and 3.16, 
suggest that this simplification is unlikely and that retrogressive 
failure was occurring north-westwards with several independent 
blocks involved. The previous wedge failures, steeper southern 
dips, fault location, and survey and extensometer data all support 
the view that block failure was initiated by instability at the 
southern end of the fault which continued there despite the 
initiation of backfill buttressing, see Figure 3.10. The reduction 
of movement declination northwards, see Figure 3.16, matches also 
the reduction of bedding dips northwards and suggests a block base 
plane/s related to bedding orientation. It is not conceivable 
that translational sliding alone could have resulted in such 
high movement declination values, see Figure 3.16. The parallel 
trend of the survey and extensometer data over the block supports 
the view that the failure mass approximated to a rigid block, 
which responded promptly to stress changes. This was supported 
by the appearance of just the single field crack and no apparent 
- 208 -
graben structures in the block. A minor crack in the baffle 
mound just west of the extensometers, see Figure 3.9, appeared 
in October 1978 but did not continue to show any further 
evidence of deformation. 
The most frustrating feature to hinder any interpretation 
of the failure mechanism was the complete lack of evidence of 
distress on the sidewall face during the complete period of 
its exposure. Resultant displacements monitored at the southern 
end of the block within 25 m of the sidewall crest exceeded 
250 mm, yet no appearance of lipping or bulging on the face 
could ever be discerned. Such features had been observed on 
failures to the north and in the east sidewall and main highwal1, 
see Sections 3.5 and 3.7. Such distress may have been concealed 
below a general cover of scree on the slope face but this is 
considered unlikely. If the sidewall problems had been anticipated 
or access to the face had been safe, see Plate 3.11, then it would 
have been appropriate to place survey stations in the slope face, 
as undertaken at the Lowther O.C.C.S. (see Chapter 4). Toe 
crushing or heaving was not observed. 
The previous wedge instabilities at the south of the block 
were based just below the Nether Lount seatearth and above the 
Yard seam respectively. The Yard seatearth later gave rise to 
translational failures in the main highwa11, see Section 3.8. 
Table 3.2 reports shear strength and index property data for 
such potential base shear planes. The borehole extensometer 
data indicated shear occurring at or above the Nether Lount 
horizon, Young (1979), at the south end of the blo.ck and more 
likely in the Permo-Trias in the north end. The continuity 
- 209 -
indicator in borehole El indicated negligible shear displacement 
occurring down to 26 m depth through the monitoring period. This 
thus reduced the possibility of any shear movement occurring at 
the southern block area within the Permo-Trias or Coal Measures 
above the base of the Middle Lount seam. A constriction 
developed in the piezometer tubing of P5 on December 1st 1978 
at a depth of 33.2 m, coincident with the base of the Nether 
Lount old workings. Insertion of rods fitted with a cutting 
shoe a month later encountered piezometer tubing flexure 1.25 m 
above the logged old workings roof. Significant shear displacement 
was indicated at this Nether Lount horizon of old workings. 
Monitored ground tilt data during.the instability period 
for stations T4, T5 and T6, see Figure 3.9, indicated a tilting 
of this southern end of the block towards the north and east, 
increasing in magnitude from T4 southwards to T6. This reflects 
a toppling mechanism at the crest which is most likely explained by 
the curvature down to the north-east in the Lount seams underlying 
this area, see Figure 3.11. Shear displacement towards the void 
at this horizon would have generated progressive surface toppling. 
The structural complexity of the sidewall exposes the 
limitations and validity of any form of back-analysis of the 
failure,in order to gain some insight into the likelihood of 
translational sliding on any particular horizon. This, however, 
is attempted herein by using a two-dimensional limit equilibrium 
method to examine the inherent stability of various depth blocks 
at sections B-B' and C-C', see Figures 3.9 and 3.10. Basal 
failure planes have been considered in the Permo-Trias and 
Nether Lount, Yard and Low Main seatearths, under varying 
- 210 -
groundwater conditions. The results of this back-analysis is 
detailed in Table 3.l2a and b. They indicate the relatively 
greater stability along the assumed failure surfaces in the 
northern area of the block resulting from the gentler bedding 
dip into the excavation and greater block depth. Accepting 
that these analyses have been conducted on the basis of 
significant assumptions they do indicate that, even under high 
groundwater pressures, failure along rock bedding planes was 
not probable. This is deduced by comparison with laboratory 
test data on saw-cut mudstone and siltstone samples, see 
Table 3.3. Values of low cohesion  50 kN/m2) accompanied 
by a friction angle of 100 to 150 are indicated as necessary 
to have permitted failure over the bl?ck base. This low shear 
strength was found in laboratory testing of the Nether Lount 
seatearth, see Table 3.3, although lack of similar test data 
on the Yard and Main seatearths precludes identifying this 
horizon as the main location for shear failure. The possibility 
even exists that the block base was not confined to the same 
horizon within the sequence and possibly transgressed up into 
the Permo-Trias in its northern area. It is difficult to 
envisage translational failure of the slope block on a single 
bedding plane, since any movement on the dome structure at the 
southern failure area would likely have resulted in a 
disaggregation of the block with the appearance of more 
tension cracks in the crest area.

(iv) Prandt1 Bearing Capacity TyPe of Failure 
The lack of evidence of translational failure on the sidewall 
face and the large values of movement declination for survey 
stations on the crest prompted consideration of a bearing capacity 
type of failure as described by Kvapi1 and Clews (1979). They 
based their hypothesis on observations of large open pit slope 
failures and proposed a model incorporating a Prandt1 wedge 
within the slope, separating an upper active zone and a lower 
passive zone. The pattern of deformation thus generated was 
that of large downward and outward displacement at the crest 
with little apparent displacement at the lower slope and toe, 
see Figure 3.15D. The rate of movement for such failures was 
reported to by cyclical. Such failure features have only been 
observed previously in U.K. coal mines in loosewal1s and at the 
Pithouse O.C.C.S., case 203, see Chapter 2. 
If this mechanism was operative on the west sidewall then 
signs of distress might have been expected to be observed on 
the face due to bulging derived from the activity developing in 
the Prandtl prism, as observed at the Pithouse O.C.C.S. failure. 
Ground tilt data indicated that during monitoring the block 
tilted west towards the fault at its rear but that the crest 
area was in fact tilting into the excavation. The.former tilt 
would be expected not only in the bearing capacity type of 
failure but also in any failure where the rearward section of 
a block was underlain by a volume moving forward at a faster 
rate or where subsidence was preferentially occurring at the 
fault. The forward rest tilt could have reflected either the 
- 214 -
onset of toppling, prompted by forward movement and a disaggregation 
of the rigid block, or subsidence into workings close to the 
face or a steepening of a main basal shear failure plane. 
3.6.4: Discussion 
The main West sidewall instability at Thorntree Farm remains 
the most intensively monitored incident in U.K. surface coal 
mining to date. The physical features of the instability were 
sUDple and consistent in behaviour through the period of 
deformation. The monitoring system functioned as intended with, 
in particular, an adequate frequency of observations. Despite 
this it is not possible to conclude with any certainty what the 
basic mechanism of failure was. The facts that the instability 
did not develop to the catastrophic stage, with no distress 
being observed on the slope face and the backfill buttress 
obscuring the southern, active face of the block meant that 
specific conclusions are conjectural. The final evidence is 
that displacement still appeared to be active on the crack across 
the Ravenstone Road in 1981, when the slope had. been fully 
buttressed for over a year. This points to subsidence of old 
workings, concentrated on the fault plane, as the likely cause 
of instability. There is little doubt that this was activated 
initially by surface mining activity. The effect of faulting 
on groundwater drawdown in such slopes has yet to be established. 
The incident h~ghlights the difficulty of simulating such an 
environment for back-analysis where there is a three-dimensional 
complexity and account needs to be taken of structural variation, 
old workings, groundwater, materials pr9perties and time. 
- 215 -
The incident, however, reinforces the evidence of Chapter 2 
that particular attention must be paid to identifying those faults 
traversing slopes, even at high angles, and deriving the associated 
nature.of bedding dips, old workings and low shear strength 
horizons. It also demonstrates that even minor failures during 
the working of a mine can provide evidence relevant to the later 
development of more significant deformation. 
3.7: Loosewall Stability 
Reference has already been made in Section 3.4 to the need 
to adapt the original strike cut mining operation to one involving 
additional dip cuts on the southern limb of the Coal Measures 
syncline. This arose from loosewall instability, case number 310, 
encountered in strike cuts 2B and 3B on pavement true dips of 
70 (1 in 8) and 50 (1 in 11). This involved movements of up to 
15 m down dip, based at the toe area on the Lower Low Main seat-
earth, buckling any Lower and Upper Low Main coal intact in the 
coaling areas. Toe stability was further reduced in this area 
of the syncline limb by acute local .steepening of the pavement 
up to 450 over distances of 10 m in places, together with attempts 
at creating loosewall faces in excess of 40
 During the working 
of this area the pavement seatearth was inadvertently punctured 
during mining and artesian groundwater pressures were observed 
though not quantified. It is conceivable that this source of 
groundwater created high water pressures at the toe of the loose-
wall as well as softening and reducing the shear strength of the 
material at the pavement interface.' A bi-planar back-analysis 
is reported in Table 3.13 which considers the slope setting at

the time with the greater face angle of 400 and varying groundwater 
conditions. A problem arises in such work concerning the appropriate 
values of opencast backfill physical and mechanical parameters to 
be adopted for computations. Bulk density will vary according 
to the depth and period of burial, degree of compaction, petrological 
constituents, method of placement, moisture content and degree of 
weathering. In July 1980 twenty samples of backfill were taken 
at Coalfield Farm from the current 100sewa11 face up to a depth of 
5 m. These 20 kg samples gave a mean moisture content of 15.1% 
and a mean dry bulk density of 1.35 Mg/m3  This indicates the 
lower range of density for fresh, relatively dry backfill existing 
on the sides of drag1ine mounds where instability often occurs 
as extensive, shallow and approximately planar failures, related 
to a form of bedding arising from the dragline dumping strategy. 
With deeper subsequent burial and compactio~with the re-establishment 
of a groundwater regime these values conceivably rise. 
Kilkenny (1968) reported dry opencast backfill bulk densities 
ranging from 1.44 Mg/m
to 2.08 Mg/m
(i.e. unit weights from 
14.1 kN/m3 to 20.4 kN/m
). These results, however, were obtained 
from four restored opencast minesites and to depths of only 9.75 m. 
He reported a sympathetic variation of backfill dry bulk density 
with shear strength. More comprehensive data needs to be obtained 
in the future in order to realistically study backfill stability, 
and at least 100 kg samples should be used for tests to account 
for its inhomogeneity. No data is available for the grading of 
the Coalfield Farm backfill although the maximum block size was 
approximately 1 m3 Plate 3.17 shows the tendency for larger 
overburden blocks to accumulate at the base of the loosewa1l and 
- 218 -
hence promote voids and permeability at depth in the vicinity of 
the pavement. Whether in reality this process creates a confined 
aquifer based on a seatearth pavement and gives rise to increased 
groundwater pressures and softening of pavement surfaces, or in 
contrast aids the drainage of a spoil slope is not clear. 
Bishop (1973) suggested that under drained conditions the 
brittleness of some rockfills and rock debris such as British 
colliery waste may be very much greater than that of other 
cohesionless fills. He emphasised that for rockfills and colliery 
waste continuous particle degradation occurs with strain at even 
relatively low stresses, and in the case of mudstones and shales 
the 'residual material' may be fine-grained, cohesive material 
of measurable plasticity. He referred to observations from the 
Aberfan Disaster investigation (Bishop, Hutchinson, Penman and 
Evans (1969. Material from Tip 7, with only 10% passing the 
200 sieve, gave a peak value for ~' of 39.5, in drained tr~axia1 
tests on 4 in diameter samples, but that this degraded to a 
cohesive material with a plasticity index of 16 and a residual 
value for ' of 171-1810 on the lower section of the slip surface, 
where a displacement of over 21 m was estimated. Strength data 
for S. Wales opencast backfill (Leigh (1979 from 10 to 30 m 
dept~with initial moisture contents of 4 to 18% and wet densities 
from 2.1 to 2.6 Mg/m3 gave the fo1lowing:-
Undrai1\ed triaxial peak strength - C' 39-95 kN/m
~' 30
Drained direct shear box strength - C' 10 kN/m2 ~' 28 p p 
- C' 35 kN/m2 ~' 10
- 219 -
The back-analysis of case 310, see Table 3.13, bas be~n conducted 
by the bi-planar method with values of 15 and 20 kN/m2 for backfill 
unit weight to examine the effect on stability calculations of 
suCh a range in parameters, with the slope face inclined at 40. 
The lower wedge base inclination has also been varied, with values 
of 8.8 and 6.8, to study the influence of pavement dip on this 
form of instability. The shear strength of this lower base failure 
plane was maintained constant at a cohesion of 20 kN/m2 and 
friction angle of 20, based on laboratory data for rock-remoulded 
clay interface direct shear tests, in order to approximate the 
pavement environment, see Table 3.2. These results indicate that 
the 2 variation in pavement inclination caused negligible effect 
on stability. The density and groundwater pressure variation, 
however, exerted a significant influence. At the point of limiting 
equilibrium the density reduction is indicated to reduce the 
required shear strength along the failure plane before failure 
initiates. Reduced density thus enhanced stability in this 
situation. The increased negative gradient on the lower density 
graph, as cohesion increases, indicates the more marked effect of 
the lower density on the decreasing frictional resistance 
requirements. 
occasional minor loosewall instability developed in 
subsequent northward mining at even gentler pavement inclinations 
but no examples could be observed where failure was seated on 
the pavement. The loosewall seldom showed any signs of seepage 
at its base and stood consistently at an angle of repose of 35. 
The working method entailed that the main haul roads into the 
basal seam coaling areas ran alongside each sidewall as well as 
Plate 3.17: Loosewall instability, 31st May 1978, Coalfield Farm O.C.C.S. 
Plate 3.18: Loosewall instability, 26th June 1978, Coalfield Farm O.C.C.S. 
- 220 -
centrally through the worked area. The exposed corner of the 
loosewall at the junctions of the haul roads and cut base was 
often the site of loosewall instability. Plates 3.17 and 3.18 
are views westward across the haul road to the eastern corner 
of the loosewall and show tension cracks associated with such 
instability. These tended to migrate westward as the basal 
seams were worked in that direction, particularly when the 
loosewall toe or face was oversteepened. 
During the excavation of strike cut lOB, in May 1978, the 
loosewall toe was cut back to win the Yard and Main coals due 
to inadequate casting by the RB1260W dragline. Plate 3.17 and 
Figure 3.17 show the 5 m thick failure along the 300 m of front 
loosewall face which consequently developed, case number 311. 
The overall failure surface appeared to conform to the bedding 
imposed on the loosewall by dragline dumping. Table 3.l4a 
reports the results of back-analysis conducted on this failure 
using the bi-planar method with assumed dry conditions and a 
dry bulk density of 15 kN/m
 The data indicate the relative 
stability of the slope and the low cohesion contribution to 
shear strength that would have been required to be operative 
in order to initiate failure. The shallow depth of the failure, 
the comparitively dry May of 1978 and the appearance of the 
loosewall indicated that groundwater pressures or weathering 
had not contributed to the instability. It would appear that 
the loose, uncompacted backfill was approaching a cohesionless 
material.

A similar oversteepening of the loosewall appeared to 
contribute to renewed instability, case numbers 312 and 313, 
in theloosewal1 above strike cut lIB. This developed over the 
last week of July 1978 on a pavement dip of li
(1 in 40), 
see Plate 3.18 and Figure 3.17. In this instance a deeper 
rotational failure developed along the 100sewa11 in addition 
to the thin approximately planar failures on the face, which 
stood temporarily at up to 55. Tables 3.l4b and 3.l4c report 
the back-analyses conducted on these two forms of failure. 
The deeper failure affected a 100 m length of the 100sewal1 
and developed over a five day period, after which it appeared 
to have stabilised. During this period no related signs of 
distress were observed in the toe of the spoil and the possibility 
was considered that it could represent a Prandtl bearing capacity 
type of failure as discussed earlier in Section 3.6.3.2. 
Disturbance of the face by the shallower failure, however, 
tended to preclude the gathering of more specific evidence. 
Case number 311, analysed dry by bi-planar and Fellenius 
methods, reported in Table 3.14a, shows"a relationship between 
cohesion and friction angle similar to that for case number 
312, indicative again of the dry, loose nature of the backfill. 
The steeper face angle, however, resulted in a less stable 
loosewall which is reflected in the higher range of friction 
angle at limiting equilibrium. The deeper rotational failure 
(case 313) back-analysis indicates also that a low cohesion 
component of shear strength existed at limiting equilibrium~ 
although the e"ffect of increased cohesion on friction angle 
under such conditions is less marked. For a cohesion range

0-20 kN/m2 then a friction angle range of 20-300 is indicated 
at failure, dependent upon groundwater conditions. 
During August 1978, when the first signs of distress 
appeared in the west sidewall at Thorntree Farm, tension cracks 
appeared, up to 60 m long and sub-parallel to the strike cut 
long axis, in the loosewall against the final dip cut l6D, 
~ee Figure 3.8. These cracks have been referred to in Section 
3.6.3 as reappearing during the autumn of 1978 despite the 
addition of further backfill and compaction from traffic. 
This failure, ease number 314, has been back-analysed dry by 
the bi-planar and Fellenius methods but with a unit weight 
of 20 kN/m2 to allow for backfill compaction, see Table 3.15. 
Three Fellenius circle radii have been used and this variation 
affected the cohesion-friction angle relationship only slightly. 
Under these conditions it is evident that the backfill failure 
plane must have possessed a cohesion of 0 to 30 kN/m2 and a 
friction angle of 10 to 20
for failure to have occurred. Such 
low required shear strength parameters indicates that a 
significant contribution to failure must have been played by 
groundwater pressures. No evidence of distress was observed 
in the loosewall toe in cut l6D and the possibility exists 
that the cracking was derived from stresses applied by the 
sidewall instability. Another more southerly and significant 
crack was also noted for the first time in August 1978, sub-
parallel to the Measures strike and traversing. the complete 
length of the subsoil mound, see Plate 3.16. The possibility 
also exists that both crack systems may have been related to 
displacement occurring along the sister faults converging at

Thorntree Farm and that they may represent evidence for 
reactivation of fault movement induced by mining activity, 
which may also have accounted for the sidewall instability. 
It may alternatively be speculated that they represent backfill 
settlement concentrated by underlying local steepening in the 
solid pavement, as indicated by the pavement seam contours 
in Figure 3.8. 
In conclusion, loosewall instability seated at its under-
lying pavement seatearth appeared to have been triggered at 
pavement dips exceeding 50 in the early stages of mining. 
The majority of later, less frequent, loosewall failures 
appeared to have been related to forming oversteep slope 
faces and toe removal. Back-analysis indicates that fresh 
backfill is approaching cohesionless material with a friction 
angle range of 30 to 350 whilst more significant cohesion 
develops with compaction. Any back-analysis is made 
particularly speculative by the basic lack of field and 
laboratory test data on the physical, mechanical and 
hydrolog~cal characteristics of mine backfill and its 
relationship to the mode of emplacement. 
3.8: Stability of the Main Highwall 
Four forms of significant instability arose during tne 
working life of the main strike cut highwall worked by the 
RBl260W walking dragline. These were associated with old 
underground workings in the central syncline area and then 
weak horizons and steepening bedding in the vicinity of the 
Ibstock Fault,on the northern limb of the main syncline.

3.8.1: Old Workings Caving in the Eastern Highwa11 
From November 1977 to July 1978 successive strike cut faces' 
at tbe eastern end of the higbwall experienced toppling failures; 
induced by caving into old workings in the Yard and Upper Low .( 
Main seams from the nearby Old Reather Colliery (circa 1870). ) 
Figure 3.18 and Plates 3.19 and 3.20 show the sequence of failures 
in the faces of cut lOB, lIB and l2B. The toppling zones in ~'\ 
these 20 to 25 m high faces were closely delineated by overbreak 
over a set of underground workings trending no~th-eastwards, so 
that as the cut progressed nor~hwards so the length of affected 
face reduced north of cut l2B. The face above the Yard seam 
comprised siltstone and sandstone, for strength data see Table 
3.2, interbedded with minor mudstone/ironstone horizons. In 
each instance, within 2 to 3 days of cutting the face, complete) 
closure of the old workings occurred within the failure zones. ~ 
resulting in dilation and intact 'rock breakage within the over-( 
lying burden leading to block toppling. Such closure, induced \ 
by surface mining, was only observed where both Yard and Low ~ 
Main seam old workings coincided. The failure zone was delineated'j 
by vertical overbreak features aligned with the long axis of the 
workings. Toppling of up to 5 m high columns was facilitated by 
the main vertical joint sets, see Figure 3.2, which tended to 
delineate each failure zone. Tension cracks on the upper Lount 
seams bench indicated that toppling never penetrated more than 
10 m back from the slope toe, with faces standing for up to 
5 months. Both joints sets exhibited a spacing of SO to 100 em, 
bedding thickness ranged from 10 to 70 em and the bedding dip 
over this area decreased northwards from 50 to zero.

3.8.2: Central Failure Associated with Folding.and Old Workings 
Evidence was provided in the mine during strike cut excavations 
that tectonic flexure of the Coal Measures strata had occurred 
above the Main seams reducing in amplitude with depth. This was 
best demonstrated by an isoclinal fold which was first encountered 
on the south syncline limb as a twin anticlinal structure, see 
Figure 3.19~, trending sub-parallel to the Ibstock Fault and 
developing northward into a single fold of reducing amplitude, 
see Plates 3.18, 3.20 and 3.21 . On 15/2/1978 in the strike cut \, 
lOA face a failure developed on the western limb of the fold,  
caused by collapse of old Middle Lount workings above the Nether 
Lount seam (case number 315). This was again an example of 
highwall failure developing where two seams had been worked 
heavily in coincidence, see Figure 3.l9B. During coaling of 
cut lOA the Middle Lount was observed to have suffered complete 
closure over most of its worked area and to overlie the Nether 
Lount which comprised 1.25 m of unworked top and middle leaves 
above 1 m of gob slack. The localised steepening of the bedding 
on the western fold limb combined with the old workings collapse 
promoted a circular rotational form of failure. This was based 
to the east, against the fold, on a clay band within the mudstone 
face which carried significant seepage, whilst tra~sgressing the 
bedding at its western and northern ends. A temporary overburden 
mound existed at the time ort the slope crest, providing extra 
surcharge and enhancing the overall circular appearance of the 
failure. In both preceding and successive strike cuts lipping 
was evident within clay bands in seatearths below both Lount 
seams, as well as within another dark grey clay band 8 m above

the Middle Lount seam. Index properties and shear strength data 
for a clay band in the Nether Lount seatearth are reported in 
Table 3.2. 
Rainfall recorded on site for the weeks preceding the 
failure was as fo11ows:-
week ending - 3/3/78 10 mm 
24/2/78 12 mm 
17/2/78 0.5 mm 
10/2/78 3mm 
.3/2/78 28 mm 
27/1/78 33 mm 
20/1/78 19 mm 
Heavy seepage in the fold vicinity and the high rainfall recorded 
in the three week period spanning the end of January suggests that 
high groundwater pressures may also have contributed to the failure. 
The failure surface was well-exposed and comprised 5 to 10 em 
of grey Carboniferous clay gouge developing into red Permo-Trias 
clay, sand and pebbles in its upper 5 m. Four polished, slicken-
sided shear planes were observed to be persistent at various levels 
within the gouge. Samples of the clay gouge were tested in a 
6 em square shear box. The samples were remoulded and tested over 
a range of moisture contents to give the following undrained 
shear strengths:-
Moisture content 31%, Cohesion 
2 2.9 kN/m , Friction angle 22 
25% 4.7 kN/m2 310 
22% 19 kN/m2 37.5 
17% 23.5 kN/m 2 41 
- 233 -
The moisture content at failure of the gouge in situ was unknown 
but the moisture content of the samples of exposed gouge was 21%. 
Dessication of the gouge on exposure would be expected, however , 
to have occurred. Denness (1977) reported a similar tenuous 
relationship between the liquidity index and undrained shear 
strength of undisturbed and remoulded Coal Measure materials 
involved in the Ironbridge landslide. He suggested, as a result, 
the use of vertical profiles of liquidity indices to define the 
vertical extent of local landslips. 
The failure mass moved almost due west down the steeper dip 
section against the fold at "a level coincident with the clay 
band, 8 m above the Middle Lount. This horizon is evident in 
Plates 3.21 and 3.22 from its associated line of seepage. It 
was also delineated on the exposed western and northern failure 
"surface areas by the subsequent appearance through the gouge of 
the seepage line. The western limit of the failure coincided 
with the line of entry of the old Lount workings into the highwall, 
see Figure 3.l9B. The toe area was also evident to coincide over 
the length of the failure with the two superimposed old Lount 
workings which would have provided a potential low shear strength 
horizon. Table 3.16 gives details of the back-analysis of this 
failure using the Fellenius and bi-planar methods with complete 
and limited drawdown. Assuming that the clay gouge would be close 
to its residual strength at'failure these results indicate that 
the cohesion and friction angle for the failure surface are in 
the range zero to 20 kN/m and 25 to 30 respectively. The. 
analysis was also undertaken with a slope profile without the 
overburden mound. This indieated that failure would have been

less likely if the mound had not been placed in such a position 
on the highwall crest, indicating a required failure shear strength 
of zero to 20 kN/m2 and friction angle of 150 to 220. As subsequent 
strike cuts were mined to the north there was no reoccurrence of 
instability against the fold. It reduced in amplitude northwards, 
see Plate 3.19, taken two cuts to the north, and the intensity 
of old workings in its proximity reduced. 
3.8.3: Eastern Failure Associat~d with an Argillaceous Shear Zone 
Plates 3.19 and 3.20 show the development in strike cuts l2A 
and 13A of the unconformity at the top of the Coal Measures. This 
arose from Pleistocene erosion of both Permo-Trias and Coal Measures 
with the deposition of fluvio-glacial drift in the resultant 
channel structures, directly upon the Coal Measures. Figure 3.20, 
Plate 3 . 1 and Plates 3.23 to 3.25 relate to the same structure also 
encountered at the eastern 150 m of strike cut l4A where instability 
developed from the end of November 1978, case number 316. Two 
zones of separate yet neighbouring instability developed - the 
westernmost and smallest failure, see Plates 3.23 and 3.24, was 
confined to a translational sliding block of mainly fluvio-g1acial 
drift (3 to 4 m of sands and gravels). A rear tension crack on 
the slope crest indicated that in transverse depth the two failure 
zones were linked. This bedding plane appea~ed to coincide with 
the location of the clay band 8 m above the Middle Lount discussed 
in Section 3.8.2 with regard to its role in promoting instability 
in the central highwall area. This clay band was not persistent, 
however, since it could not be located by inspection of the face 
on the more eastern failure's intact walls.

The eastern failure, see Plate 3.25, was sited over a wider 
extent of similar Pleistocene channel area. It had transgressed 
farther into the Coal Measures with its toe just above the Middle 
Lount seam and comprised a thicker sequence of Pleistocene drift 
underlain by a weak contorted section of mudstones and seatearths, 
with minor beds of siltstone. The mudstone/seatearth appeared 
in places as brecciated, with blocks up to 2 m large contained 
within a softened clay matrix. This zone was highly contorted 
with a number of complex and persistent, polished shear planes , 
transgressing the bedding. A reconstructed longitudinal view 
of this mudstone zone appears in Figure 3.20, based upon careful 
mapping of the failure debris only. The underlying failure base 
appeared to be a composite plane through the argillaceous sequence. 
Intact rock breakage and joint separation delineated the failure 
at its western and eastern ends. The overall bedding dipped

mudstone/seatearth horizon is speCUlative. It may represent a 
structure arising from penecontemporaneous. slumping or flexure 
associated with the anticline structure at the same horizon 
discussed in Section 3.8.2. Shirley (1955) described a similar 
contorted mudstone sequence which is found persistent just above 
the ~Fox Earth seam in" the East Midlands. He related its genesis 
to slumping promoted by Carboniferous earthquake activity  
. Taylor (1979) proposed that further observational evidence 
suggested that local slumping due to oversteepening during 
sandstone channelling is probably a more feasible explanation 
for the disturbed Fox Earth strata than seismicity. The weakened

mudstone at the Coalfield Farm mine, however, appeared to be limited 
in areal extent to the eastern side of the mine only. It was 
encountered in the upper section of the two east sidewall failures 
(case numbers 301 and 302), reported in Section 3.5. Its proximity 
to the Coal Measures unconformity and ancient river channels may 
explain the softening of the mudstone/seatearth but not necessarily 
the large scale existence of such polished shear planes. 
Negligible tilting of the failure blocks near the backscar 
and tension cracks indicated a mode of plane failure. Block 
toppling occurred near the base of the failure mass only. The 
failure has been back-analysed by the plane failure limit 
equilibrium method, see Table 3.17. A friction angle of 270 
with negligible cohesion for dry conditions agrees closely with 
the shear strength test data for dry saw-cut mudstone joints, 
see Table 3.2. Table 3.2 and Figure 3.21 also detail the results 
of direct shear testing undertaken on intact specimens together 
with polished shear planes from the mudstone-seatearth debris. 
The failure envelopes have been evaluated by both the conventional 
Coulomb's Law equation and a fitted Power curve. The indicated 
shear strength of the argillaceous shear zone is particularly low 
and indicates that failure was most likely triggered by shear 
along existing shear planes and through intact, weathered mudstone. 
Seepage in~o this zone from the overlying Pleistocene aquifer 
would have softened the mudstone further, as well as increased 
the groundwater pressures and contributed to an increase in 
driving forces. The crest tension cracks indicated that the 
failure, once established to the east, spread westwards resulting 
in secondary movement on the clay band mentioned earlier, thus 
creating the impression of a second independent failure. Only

minor precipitation was recorded on minesite in the preceding month. 
No old workings were encountered in the area in the Lount seams. 
An identical form of instability occurred in the same length 
of highwall in the subsequent strike cut lSA. 
3.8.4: Instability Against the Ibstock Fault 
The Ibstock Fault zone formed the final northern limit to 
the strike cut mining, see Figure 3.1, and resulted in localised 
steepening in the Coal Measures bedding from zero to 110 (1 in 5) 
to the south at the fault. Plate 3.26 shows coaling operations, 
viewed from the south-west, in the Lount seams during August 1979 
and the exposure of the fault with its northern hade. The Ibstock 
Fault in fact comprised a regional zone of NW-SE trending faults 
which at the eastern end of th~ site was mapped as three normal 
faults but which branched into six normal faults during its 
traverse to the western end of the site, see Figure 3.23. Strike 
cut mining against the fault progressed from east to west 
accompanied by a sequence of failures of significant proportions. 
3.8.4.1: Eastern Instability, 1979 
The orientation of the strike cuts meant that the eastern 
end of the highwall was first to reach the area of seam steepening 
against the Ibstock Fault, see Figure 3.1. During 23/10/1979 a 
major tension crack appeared, 0.5 mwide, on the Lount seams 
bench above cut 19B where Low Main coaling was underway. During 
the day the crack grew to delineate a large block, 70 m in depth 
back from the cut crest, on its western and northern flanks. 
Plate 3.26: Exposure of Ibstock fault on Lounts bench, August 1978, Coalfield Farm O.C.C.S. 
- 242 -
Lipping, up to 3 oms, was also observed at the base of the face 
of cut 19B immediately below the Yard seam. In this area of the 
minesite the Yard seam lay directly above the Main seams, separated 
only by a 10 to 15 mm thick light grey seatearth. This separation 
increased towards the western end of the highwa11 with a mudstone 
parting increasing to 8 m. During the night of 23/10/1979 15 mm 
of rainfall was recorded on site and by the morning the block of 
around 200000 cu m in volume was completely delineated by the 
final extension of tension cracking on its eastern side, where 
greater constraint appeared to be afforded by the sidewall slope. 
During the day on 24/10/1979 the block slid 15 m into the cut 
before stabilising. 
Examination of the failure, case number 317, revealed that 
a front 'active' block had moved down dip at the Yard seam level 
to the south-east arid away from an exposed fault plane which 
represented its rearward face. The fault plane dipped at 700 
to 750 in an azimuth direction of 055
 At its exposure it 
displayed a polished plan'ar face comprising a 5 em thick layer 
of uniform grey clay gouge. 
The western and part of the, eastern block limits appeared 
to relate in orientation to the two main joint sets. The 
orientation of the main eastern block limit and its appearance 
later in t~ suggests that it developed with a significant 
amount of intact rock breakage. The active block remained 
intact during movement, and separation along the two systematic 
joint sets occurred only at its front end with some consequent 
columnar toppling. 
- 243 -
Movement of the active block promoted the failure of a 
northern rearward block which quickly followed its movement 
southwards. This northern block, see Figure 3.22, reached 
equilibrium with a surface tilt of 15 to the south-west, 
abutting onto and sliding down the northern dipping fault at 
the rear of the active block. It comprised Coal Measures, 
Permo-Trias and Pleistocene overburden. 
Table 3.18 shows the results of a back-analysis of this 
failure considering only the active southern block, based at 
the Yard seatearth, using a plane failure limit equilibrium 
method and the cross-section of Figure 3.22. The steepening 
failure plane dip to the fault had to be represented by a plane 
at an overall dip of 90  Four groundwater situations have been 
simulated, as shown, and the cohesion parameter for the failure 
plane has been assumed as zero. This demonstrates that with 
moderate drawdown and a full head of water in the rear tension 
crack the Yard horizon would have required a 19
friction angle 
to maintain equilibrium. In contrast, if groundwater pressures 
are ignored this value reduces to 90  The actual groundwater 
pressure distribution is conjectural but thought to approximate 
to the situation of limited drawdown with no extra tension crack 
water driving forces at the time of initial failure. This would 
require a friction angle of 12
for equilibrium. 
The failure has also been back-analysed using the bi-planar 
method to study the interaction between the two blocks separated 
by the fault plane. Table 3.19 reports the results for dry 
conditions and for the limited drawdown on the active block, 
as considered in Table 3.18. There was a possibility that

high groundwater pressures existed north of the fault plane which 
may .have acted effectively as an aquitard. The results indicate 
again that the groundwater assumptions have a significant effect 
on the back-analysis results. If the assumptions that zero cohesion 
exists on both block undersides together with a friction angle of 
120 for the lower block base, then at limiting equilibrium the 
upper block base requires a minimum friction angle of 480 to maintain 
stability. Table 3.19 also shows the significant effect on the 
magnitude of this angle if the upper block base possesses cohesion, 
as would be expected since its failure would necessitate some 
intact rock breakage through Coal Measures and Permo-Trias. These 
data show the upper surface with a higher shear strengh than that 
derived from laboratory tests on saw-cut mudstone and siltstone 
joints"prepared from mine material, see Table 3.2. Tbis indicates 
the likely range of 40 to 60 kN/m

intact siltstone and mudstone test data, (Bas8ani, Whittaker and 
Scoble (1979. 
Figure 3.22 shows the difference in plan between actual and 
predicted PQsitions of the fault plane, indicative again of the 
inherent difficulty in specifying such faulting details from 
exploration drilling. It was only after exposure d~e to mining 
that the marked steepening in seam dips within 10 m of the fault 
was fully r,ecognised. A disquieting feature of the failure was 
the appearance of a rear tension crack running north-westward 
from the failed block parallel with tbe fault zone, see Figure 
3.22. As mining subsequently worked northern areas against the 
fault it became apparent that similar translational sliding away 
from the fault complex was occurring, see Section 3.8.4.2.

The remedial methods adopted required a shovel-truck operation. 
The final highwa11 was cut back to 1 in 1 in the Coal Measures and 
1 in 2 in the Permo-Trias and Pleistocene drift. Plate 3.28 shows 
the affected area in the final highwa11 eight months later. Mining 
continued using a series of short dip cuts northward from the 
vicinity of the failure, see Figure 3.1, using Caterpillar D9 
dozers and 245 shovels. In January, February and March 1980, 
during a wet winter, a persistent problem was the stability of 
the dip cut endwalls forming the final highwall, cut at 450  
Failures developed readily in a quasi-circular mode through the 
Coal Measures and Permo-Trias on the northern side of the fault 
zone with their toe sited on the steepening strata just above 
and below the Yard seam. 
3.8.4.2: Central and Northern Instabilities, 1980 
Strike cut mining with the RBl260W was readopted for working 
the central and northern length of the highwall up to the Ibstock 
Fault. Over this length of the northern site limit the Ibstock 
Fault developed into a complex o~ more than six normal faults 
with a contained graben structure. Each fault was of a normal 
nature dipping to the north and south with down throws ranging 
fran 1 m up to 25 m, see Figure 3.23. In April 1980 significant 
lipping was again evident on top of the Yard seatearth over a 
300 m length of the strike cut 23B highwall, accompanied by 
dilation of the main NW-SE joint set, see Plate 3.27. As the 
mining of the initial eastern ends of strike cuts 21B, 22B, 23B 
and 24B excavated the central section of the final highwal~ a 
set of tension cracks developed, up to 180 m from the highwall

toe, extending into the main overburden mound. On June 4th 1980 
as coaling commenced in the initial eastern end of strike cut 25B, 
removing further constraint, a failure developed above 
the Lount seams bench. By June 10th the tension cracks had continued 
to develop, the rearmost on the overburden mound having displaced 
by 1.9 m vertically and 2.5 m horizontally, as the failure toe 
moved 30 m horizontally into cut 25B at a lower horizon on the 
Yard seatearth, see Plate 3.28, Figures 3.23 and 3.24. A feature 
of this failure, case number 318, was that the upper overburden 
mound cracks indicated the development of a graben structure to 
the rear and a forward ground tilt between cracks. This resembled 
the retrogressive development of failure of the upper block 
behind the fault plane, reported in Section 3.8.4.1, at the' 
eastern end of the final higawall. 
May 1980 was initially dry and then 29 mm of rainfall was 
recorded on minesite in its latter half. The week precedinl 
the failure was dry up to June 7th after which 9 mm of rain was 
recorded up to June lOth, when 3 mm ~ell overnight. Equilibrium 
was restored on June 11th by forming a backfill buttress in cut 
25B and dressing back the scar slope by bulldozer. Movement 
associated with the overburden mound tension cracks continued 
through July but with no associated significant failures. 
On 13/7/1980 the face of cut 25B had extended 80 m north 
of the installed backfill buttress. Lipping of up to 5 em on 
the Yard seatearth was again evident along this length of exposed 
face. A sample of Yard seatearth was taken from the face and 
Table 3.2 records its index ~est data. The lipping was observed 
to occur directly at the interface between the coal and the

seatearth moisture content of 15% was found to increase to 25% 
within 2 em of the interface. The 20 em thick seatearth comprised 
uniform pale grey clay with no identifiable internal shear zones. 
Its upper 2 OR bad been significantly softened by the water seepage 
and failure displacement. 
The overall failure appeared to comprise a number of distinct 
blocks which progressively developed from the basic instability 
founded on the Yard seatearth. The three sets of tension cracks 
appear in crols-section and plan to have been related to the 
underlying faulting structure, see Figure 3.24-. The greater 
northward progression on this central highwall section, compared 
to the eastern section previously discussed, appears to be related 
to the fact that,in this area, the fault zone split into six 
branches, expanding northwards, whilst the overburden mound 
provided more surcharge of weak material and possibly higher 
groundwater pressures to the northern rear failure zone. The 
plan outline of the failure was related to the topography of the 
overburden mound, the location of the faults, and the dog-leg 
in the highwall line in this area. Mass movement occurred in 
the form of large rigid blocks delineated by significant dilation 
of tension cracks through the Coal Measures. Plate 3.29 shows 
the displacement on a tension crack through siltstones on the 
Lount seam benches on 13/7/1980 (taken at point Z on Figure 3.23).

Back-analysis has been conducted by the plane failure method 
on the block south of the fault zone, see Table 3.20, based on 
the Yard seatearth. Variation of the groundwater pressures and 
the assumption of zero cohesion on the failure plane indicates 
that for failure to occur at a friction angle of 12
, as indicated 
at the previous eastern highwall failure, case number 317, then higher 
groundwater pressures would have been necessary. This derives from 
the reduced inclination of the Yard seam over this more northern 
section of highwall and the greate~ depth of block, requiring 
higher uplift and driving water pressures. These may conceivably 
have been provided by hydraulic continuity between the failure 
plane and the overburden mound slope ,caused by dilation across 
one or more of the underlying fault planes.

upper block failure planes,each wi"th assumed zero cohesion indicates 
that the two larger northern blocks would have been unlikely to have 
failed with such geometries,unless much high groundwater uplift 
pressures existed over their bases. These models were intended 
to represent failure through the underlying Coal Measures by a 
combination of bedding plane slippage and breakage through intact 
rock. The two southern blocks behind the fault are indicated to 
have failed, with equivalent zero cohesion, at a required 300 to 
400 friction angle range which reduces to 16
to 240 for the two 
larger blocks. It seems unlikely that even a residual friction 
angle of a failure plane derived by intact mudstone/siltstone 
breakage would be this low. This data and the significant 
seepage observed at the Yard seatearth in the southern block 
toe indicates that high groundwater pressures existed north of 
the fault zone,which originally could have acted as an aquitard, 
reducing the extent of drawdown below the overburden mound. 
A large combination of block configurations could be back-
analysed. Plane failure of all blocks appeared to be indicated 
by the mass movements. One further simple model back-analysed 
is further considered to assess the possible alternative failure 
mode of one failure plane being common to much of all blocks 
north of the fault. This implies that li,ttle influence was 
exerted at depth by the other northerly faults, resulting in 
shear failure through the overburden and underlying rocks to a 
greater extent. Table 3.22, details the results of this analysis 
on the assumption that the front block failure plane possessed 
zero cohesion and a 120 friction angle and shows the combination 
of upper block cohesion and friction angle required for equilibrium

with the indicated higher groundwater pressures. The results 
indicate that failure could have arisen in this mode with the 
range of laboratory shear strengths established for saw-cut 
mudstone and siltstone joints, i.e. cohesion 20-25 kN/m2 and 
friction angle 25-300 , see Table 3.2. 
The back-analysis of both eastern and central highwall 
failures indicates that the Yard seam provided a sufficiently 
weak base for the block to the south of the fault plane to be 
regarded as an acti~e block. The bi-planar results t however, 
also indicate that the northern, upper blocks could also be 
regarded as active blocks. In the absence of specific ground-
water data, however, it would be unwise to be too specific 
about the failure plane shear strengths derived theoretically. 
The indicated range of shear strengths so derived are zero 
cohesion and 8 to 12
friction angle fo~ the.Yard'seam-seatearth 
interface; and 20 to 30 kN/m2 cohesion and 20 to 300 friction 
angle for the composite failure surface northward up through 
the Coal Measures and younger overburden. 
3.9: Summary 
This Chapter has attempted to compile all known data on the 
cases of instability occurring during the complete working life of 
the Coalfield Farm mine. It has demonstrated that - instability 
cases frequently reoccur with similar characteristics on dynamic 
internal mine slopes, or static external slopes with the pasaage 
of t~. Consideration of all instability cases during the operation 
of a mine is, therefore, justified in order to define the factors 
- 259 -
locally controlling stability in order to anticipate the reoccurrence 
of similar instability incidents, which may threaten more serious 
consequences. 
- faulting can promote instability when giving rise to 
localised steepening of strata dips. The precise nature of 
faulting could only be defined in the mine after exposure by 
mining excavation. Faults frequently branched and varied in 
their displacement and dip characteristics. The merits of 
considering faulting and its impact on slope stability at the 
initial stages of mine design were clearly appreciated. The 
orientation, stand-off distance and excavation sequence of 
slopes must all be considered carefully with respect to defined 
faulting. The problems posed by the development of instability 
along a fault system,established as the final highwall location 
in a mine were demonstrated. These may be associated with the 
effects of deformation enc~oaching outside the mine boundary,as 
well as providing complications if an extension to the mine is to 
be worked later up to or from the same boundary. 
- instability cases were predominantly based on weak shear 
zones, i.e. clay bands within seatearths or mudstones, mudstone 
and seatearth bedding surfaces, softened and pre-sheared mudstones 
and fault gouge. These resulted in the primary role played by 
strata dips, where such zones can conform to bedding and planar 
or bi-planar failure modes involve translational sliding on dips 
o often below 10. Many of these zones were not identified prior 
to production and this highlights the problem of their definition 
from exploratory drilling. This results from both a general lack 
of strata coring in advance of production as well as the difficulty 
of recovery and identification of such zones in cores. 
- 260 -
- problems existed in conducting instability back-analysis. 
Even when slope geometry and failure mechanisms were clearly 
defined, doubts over the nature of groundwater pressure distributions 
were significant. The necessity of having reference to a reliable 
range of-materials strength data from both laboratory testing and 
past instability back-analyses for slope analysis were also clearly 
demonstrated. 
- the control of structural geology over stability was of 
prime importance. Structural control was evident firstly by the 
provision of adverse strata dips either on a regional scale due 
to major folding or locally due to faulting, interburden cross-
bedding, prehistoric erosion profiles or minor folding. Structural 
control was exercised secondly by the provision of release planes 
for mass movement by faults. The main west sidewall failure would 
likely have developed to a 'catastrophic stage if the large rigid 
block had been provided with less constraint on its northern 
boundary by a second fault plane. The high angle of ,intersection 
in plan of the actual fault with the slope crest line and the 
lack of such a structure confined the incident to an instability 
rather than a failure. Jointing was seen to release only smaller 
masses and play a less direct role in defining the actual limits 
to development of large instabilities. 
- periods of high rainfall correlated to the visible onset 
of the majority of instabilities. Lack of piezometric data, however, 
precludes further analysis due to the uncertainty over whether 
rainfall contributed by either increasing groundwater pressures 
and actually triggering instability, or flooding existing tension 
cracks and reducing the overall strength of unstable masses, thus 
being of more influence on post-failure deformation. 
- 261 -
- as higher external slopes become more commonplace then 
serious thought should be given to contingency plans to anticipate 
the implications of remedial measures, applicable to any deep-
seated instability. The west sidewall instability showed the 
problems associated with establishing a remedial backfill buttress 
against a high slope. Slope drainage, considered in other surface 
mining fields as an often valid remedial measure, requires reliable 
knowledge of groundwater controls before justifying serious 
consideration. Mine design should aim to minimize the period of 
exposure of high slopes particularly where any doubts over 
stability exist. 
- stability problems in main loosewalls with strike cuts 
advancing down dip can have a serious impact on mine production. 
Loosewall stability was sensitive to pavement dip. Instability 
was also a,sociated with oversteep loosewall slopes and unconstrained 
slope corners at the entry of haul roads into coaling areas. 
- careful consideration should be given to the effects of 
external spoil dump surcharge and surface drainage location on 
slope stability. In the British planning environment which 
affords little surface area within minesites for choice of such 
location this is a difficult proposition. Contribution to 
instability was evident, however, from the loading afforded by 
spoil dumps, the delineation of unstable areas by river diversion 
channels and the possible ingress of water into slopes from 
surface drainage. The leakage of water from the east sidewall 
river diversion culvert may have resulted from collapse of old 
shallow underlying workings. 
- 262 -
- collapse over shallow underground workings contributed to 
failure in strike cut benches, particularly where two neighbouring 
seams were worked in coincidence. This gave rise to shallow 
toppling failures and a circular rotational failure in association 
with an overlying anticlinal structure. These failure zones 
were clearly defined by the orientation and extent of the under-
ground workings. The possibility of more extensive collapse 
affecting slope stability in high slopes was shown in the main 
West sidewall instability. In this incident subsidence over old 
workings, concentrated on a fault plane was evident. Whether other 
large failures on the East sidewall were actually related to old 
working void migration is conjectural. 
- the post-failure displacement characteristics of the large 
West sidewall block were cyclic, a feature which is now well 
.established for large, hard rock, open-pit mining failures. This 
showed the often equally important.benefit offered by monitor~ng 
systems in characterizing post-failure movement patterns as well 
as being used as predictive tools. In this role the monitoring 
scheme provided the capability of assessing the development of 
post-failure movement as well as offering an insight into the 
progressive or creep characteristics of ~he failure mechanism. 
The importance was clearly seen of providing simple and durable 
monitoring instrumentation which enabled the site Engineer to 
quickly and conveniently read the full range of instrumentation. 
The positive benefit of gaining the reassurance from monitoring 
instrumentaion that deformation was not active with such ease 
was clearly evident. The benefit arising from installing such 
systems before the onset of deformation was also clearly established. 
- 263 -
In such an environment as the West sidewall instability crucial 
information which a system should provide is the location of the 
base of the instability as this governs the magnitude of the hazard 
posed. 
At the time of writing (February 1981) a set of five borehole. 
equipped for inclinometers and extensometers have just been 
established along the. future crest of the west sidewall of the 
planned extension to the Coalfield Farm mine. These are located 
where a fault complex parallel to the Ibstock Fault cuts the proposed 
sidewall, which at that area will be over 100 m high. The placement 
of this system in advance of any mining is intended to build upon 
the experience of slope behaviour gained at the Coalfield Farm 
mine. It is also intended to serve as a predictive tool to 
anticipate any stability problems which may arise on this future 
external slope.

CHAPTER 4 
LONG TERM DEFORt~TION IN A DEEP VOID - LOWTHER 
NORTH EXTENSION MINE 
4.1: Introduction 
The monitoring scheme undertaken at the Lowther North Extension 
O.C.C.S. provided the opportunity to study slope deformation within 
a void (55 m deep, 250 m wide, 300 m long) in Coal Measures over a 
400 day period. During that time the void remained unworked, hence 
freeing the scheme of the limitations normally imposed by mining 
operations. The N.C.B. Opencast Executive requested assistance from 
the Mining Department, Nottingham University in May 1978 in order to 
monitor the void stability since at that time it was anticipated that 
the void would be required to stand secure for at least two years until 
initial mining of the then proposed adjacent Lowther West O.C.C.S. 
Various features discussed later indicated that stability could not 
be guaranteed over the required void life. It was decided from the 
outset to concentrate monitoring effort on the critical southern high-
wall slope of the void, see Plates 4.1 and 4.8. The south highwall 
stability was influenced by ,the following factors: 
- the need to maintain stability for in excess of two years; 
_ the existence of the River Aire running subparallel to and 
within 30-50 m 'of the highwa1l crest; 
- a line of sheet piling, installed in 1973 between the river 
and crest, aimed at minimizing the river influence on the 
slope groundwater regime (a line of piezometers were also 
- 265 -
established at this t~e to provide the means of monitoring 
groundwater conditions within the slope, although unfortunately 
all had become non-operative by May 1978); 
- a sequence of weak strata comprising the upper third of the 
wall (mudstones and superficials); 
- the presence of weak clay bands at different horizons within 
the slope sequence; 
- the extraction of deeper seams by longwal1 and room-and-pillar 
methods under the bigbwall area with attendant subsidence zones; 
- an area of convexivity in plan over the central length of 
bighwa11; 
- the presence of a circular rotational failure at the time in 
 the central length of the highwall and its potential to develop 
a lateral or longitudinal progressive nature  . 
Increasing attention is currently being given by the N.C.B. 
and government to the exploitation of Coal Measures voids, created 
by opencast mining, for waste disposal. The long term stability 
of such voids is therefore of increasing interest. 
This project represented the first formal attempt at monitoring 
the face and crest of a significant Coal Measures slope in the U.K. 
over a long period. It must be stated that the unfortunate short-
coming of th,is work is that monitoring was not undertaken until the 
void had been open for 15 months and consequently the short term 
post-excavation deformation history could not be established.

- 266 -
An important aspect of the scheme was that it provided the 
opportunity to study the problems associated with field monitoring 
and hence the actual design and procedures involved in this work 
are discussed in the Chapter. 
The void contained zones of instability in both the north 
and south highwalls at the commencement of the project, case number. 
401 and 402. During th~ monitored period instability progressed 
along the entire length of the north highwall, case number 403. 
In December 1978 a period of excessive rainfall resulted in the 
River Aire breaching the void floodplain bund at four points. The 
void was quickly inundated to hold 1046 Ml (230 million gallons) of 
water. The decision was then taken by the N.C.B. to pump the void 
dry and to backfill it with opencast spoil. The flooding had 
promoted a new zone of instability at the western end of the southern 
highwall whose characteristics were monitored, case number 404. 
The failure progressed and was monitored until August 1979 when 
finally buttressed by the backfilling operations. 
4.2: Mine Geology 
In August and September 1973 boreholes 478, 479, 480, 481 were 
completed in the planned position of the southern highwall crest for 
the installation of piezometers PI-PS, see Figure 4.la. Figure 4.1b 
shows the sequence derived from these borehole logs. It is of 
interest to note that at this point in time the general dip of the 
sequence was defined at 1 in 20 to the south, see Figure 4.1a. A 
tacheometer survey conducted in the void in June 1978, however, 
revealed a dip of 1 in 14 in a~more westerly sense, see Figures 
4.2 and 4.3, indicating the difficulty in predicting strata dip

the highwall, the Methley Savile Fault, but this wa. located at 
its far eastern end adjacent to the eastern backfill wall. 
- 273 -
4.3: Underground Workings 
No old underground workings were evident in the Top Barnsley 
Soft, Low Barnsley or Dunsil seams in the south highwall. Thele 
seams had been worked under the northern higbwall especially in 
the Top Barnsley Soft. Most workings were backfilled although two 
headings were encountered open and represented disused drainage 
adits. Void migration was evident above some of the workings up 
to a height of 3 m but no evidence of any significant collapse or 
localised steepening of dips was evident. A failure in the eastern 
end of the north highwall however might possibly have been related 
to localised steepening of bedding into the void, see Section 4.5.1. 
Experience of highwall instability in the previously worked 
Lowther North site in 1973, Walton (June 1973), indicated that 
translational sliding on weak clay bands could be induced in 
subsidence zones related to deeper underlying seam excavations, 
see Section 4.5.1. Subsidence zones overlying underground workinal 
comprise areas of residual compression and dilation/extension 
strains. Tbe existence of dilational strain zones behind slope 
crests can promote cross-strata fracture and dilation of existing 
discontinuities. This not only has the effect of providina 
potential block failure release planes parallel to the extension 
zone but also of promoting groundwater seepage acrosl existing 
aquiclude structures and possible internal erosion. Subsidence 
zones may also induce a reversal or steepening of discontinuity 
dips to the detriment of slope stability. This may be particularly 
hazardous where regional dips are gentle. 
- 274 -
Walton (June 1973) reported the existence of workinll, derived 
from a records search, in five underlying seams as follows:-
Seam Approx. Depth m Extraction m 
Warren House/Barnsley 46 No records available 
Haigh Moor 78 1.50 
Flockton 168 1.37 
Middleton Little 215 0.79 
Silks tone 242 0.84 
Beeston 325 1.17 
He defined the location of mining panel ribaides underlying 
the proposed Extension site southern highwall and the three attendant 
subsidence zones, see Figure 4.4. Their proximity to and alignment 
with the River Aire and the proposed highwall crest highlighted the 
need for further careful consideration of the planned excavation. 
One major concern involved the possible hydraulic connection of the 
River Aire through intennediate aquicludes to deeper aquifers. The 
groundwater ~plications are discussed later in Section 4.4. Further 
concern involved localised changes in bedding dip. He examined data 
provided by surface drilling and matched them with survey records 
from underground working in the Beeston and Flockton seams. These 
were largely in agreement in suggesting that the bedding dip was 
1 in 20 mainly towards the south and west into the proposed Ilope. 
The author derived a dip of the sequence in the western end of the 
void by survey techniques in 1978 with a value of 1 in 14 in a 
direction south of west, see Fig~re 4.2. This discrepancy il 
dis.cussed later since the author considers that the dip direction 
exerted some control over the subsequent highwall failures in the 
void.

No active underground mining occurred during the period which 
this study considers at the Lowther North Extension O.C.C.S. 
4.4: Groundwater - Southern Highwall 
Figure 4.5 shows the data .assembled for the working lives of 
the five Casagrande standpipe piezometers, PI to PS, installed in 
advance of the southern highwall of the Lowther North Extension 
site in August-September 1973, together with site rainfall and 
River Aire flow rates. They were installed to the north of a line 
of sheet piling which flanked the north bank of the River Aire. 
Unfortunately all of these piezometers were inoperative by the 
commencement of the survey monitoring program detailed later. They 
provide information, however, on the nature of the groundwater 
regime in the slope and the characteristics of drawdown during 
excavation of the mine void which occurred during their working 
lives. The piling operation had been undertaken to eliminate 
hydraulic continuity between the River and the southern highwall 
slope, being emplaced along its length into bedrock. Three aquifer 
structures were monitored by the piezometers - the alluvial gravel 
aquifer (P2 and PS), the channel sandstone aquifer (PI and P4) and 
the siltstone aquifer underlying the Low Bamsley seam (P3) , see 
Figure 4.1. 
The separate alluvial gravel piezometers showed a consistency 
in water level variation during their lives, together with those 
placed in the lower aquifers. From September to December 1973, 
over the first 100 days of groundwater monitoring the piezometers 
Pl, P3 and P4 showed a marked drawdown. The magnitude of drawdown 
increased with easterly location within the deeper sandstone

aquifers from 5 to 8 m. During this period, excavation to the 
depth of these aquifers was taking place in the laat work ins ar.a 
of the Lowther North site. Over this period ita alope face to 
this depth advanced from a position 290 m to 260 m north-eaat of 
boreholes 480/481. Drawdown then appeared to continue but at a 
much reduced rate until October 1974, i.e. over a 300 day period 
water levels in the san~stone and siltstone aquiferl fell by 3 m. 
During this period excavation to both aquifers continued on site 
but to the north of the existing nearest face to the piezometer 
line. This reduction in drawdown rate may allo have been due in 
part to the onset of persistent rain and consequent high river flow 
values in the first three months of 1974. 
From October 1974 to May 1975 the water level in the upper 
sandstone aquifer rose slightly, stabilised and then appeared to 
recommence its reduced drawdown rate. In the loweat aquifer, however, 
the established drawdown rate of 1 m per 100 days continued over 
this period. During this period the River Aire flow rate ro.e to 
pronounced higher winter levels. The behaviour of water levela in 
the sandstone aquifer and the overlying alluvial aravel aquifer 
were markedly sUnilar over this period. This would appear to 
indicate that some hydraulic continuity exiated at that time 
between the river, the gravel aquifer and the upper sandatone 
aquifer. This could have been afforded by breakage or joint 
dilation through the intervening aquiclude~, promoted by prior 
underlying longwall mining, see Section 4.3. 
The behaviour of the two piezometers (P2 and P5) in the 
alluvial gravel aquifer over this first 600 day period both showed 
an initial but less pronounced drawdown, rising with the onset of 
- 279 -
high river flow rates over the winter of 1974-75. Thi. aquifer 
however, in contrast to the underlying sandstone aquifer, .howed 
a more pronounced sensitivity to river flow values indicating a more 
effective hydraulic link between itself and the river. Thi. 
indicated that the sheet piling was not functioning effectively. 
A delay period of about 5 days elapsed between changes in river 
flow rate a~d piezometric level. Response to rainfall was lea. 
distinct. 
From May 1975 to November 1975 all three aquifer. experienced 
the onset of an increased rate of drawdown. This corresponded with 
a commencement of renewed excavation towards the piezometer line. 
Over this period the nearest highwall slope advanced westward to 
within 107 m of boreholes 480/481, to remain at that position until 
April 1975, from which point in time all piezometer. were inoperative. 
The sandstone and siltstone aquifers experienced similar drawdown 
rates, 2.7 m per 100 days. The drawdown rate for the alluvial 
gravel aquifer was less pronounced and this aquifer appeared to be the 
most affected by the variation of river flow rates. Once again the 
two upper aquifers both appeared to be linked hydraulically to the 
river in that the onset of the high winter 1975-76 river flow rate. 
stabilized their drawdown. The superior hydraulic link between the 
river and gravel aquifer was again demonstrated by the final ri.e 
in water level (P2) corresponding to this increased river flow. 
Excavation closer to the piezometers did then not recommence 
until the period April 1976 to August 1977 when the void directly 
north of their line, the subsequently survey-monitored south high-
wall, was finally created.

4.5: Stability History 
This section relates to the instances of instability observed 
in the Lowther North Extension and nearby Lowther North sites prior 
to the monitoring programme initiated by the author in May 1978. 
4.5.1: Northern Highwall 
In April 1973 a major failure of 64000 cu m occurred in the 
northern highwall in the previously worked Lowther North site, 
Walton (June 1973), 500 m north-east of the Extension site south 
highwall (case number 400). Walton identified a significant role 
being played in the failure by subsidence zones associated with 
two sets of deep mine panels, see Figure 4.6. The highwall in the 
failure area at that time ran parallel to the ribs ide of an under-
ly~ng panel in the Flockton seam with its extension zone in the 
highwall crest. The slope measures sequence corresponded to that 
described earlier for the Extension site and tension cracks observed 
to run parallel to the ribside and charged with water undoubtedly 
contributed to the failure by increasing water pre.sure in the 
slope and providing block release planes. The second mine panel 
involved was in the Haigh Moor seam where a barrier pillar had been 
left directly below the failure area. Tension cracks observed to 
be aligned with this pillar provided further dilational effect. on 
the ground ma.s as well as similarly influencing the groundwater. 
The western extremity of the failure closely followed the line of 
a small fault (23 em (9 ins) throw). The general dip of bedding in 
the area, see Figure 4.6, had an apparent component perpendicular 
to the face of approximately 1 in 25. Survey spot levels taken

subsequent to failure on the roof of the Top Barnsley Soft, however, 
indicated that the lateral component was pos.ibly .teeper, at 1 in 
11. Thi. demon.trates the difficulty of anticipating local dips 
with confidence. Translational sliding occurred mainly below the 
Low Bamsley seam. Data from laboratory teata undertaken on sample. 
from this clay band were reported in Section 4.2, (c'  0, peak 
shear strength, ~' - 200 , residual ~' - lO-120 ). Secondary sliding 
was also observed within the mudstone overlying the Top Barnsley Soft 
seam. Figure 4.7 reports a back-analysis conducted by plane failure 
with the assumption of a tension crack from the crest down to the 
base failure plane. This indicates that even with high groundwater 
pressures to promote failure the base plane must have had a very low 
shear strength. The laboratory strength data reported for samples 
from this horizon would have been sufficiently low, if they reflect 
in-situ strengths realistically, to have permitted failure. A key 
role was played by the orientation and persistence of lubsidence 
crackl from underground workings.

In Hay 1978, at the commencement of the deformation monitorina

'Extenlion lit. which was flanked at itl crelt by a haul road, rail-
way line and coal dilpolal point (case number 401). Thil initially 
comprised one rotational failure in the superficiall and weathered 
mudltonel at the we.tern extremity of the highwall, which commenced 
failing in .arly February, 1978. This initial failure wa. sited in 
an area where the superficials had earlier been removed because of 
the presence of running .ands and replaced with opencast backfill. 
This area had originally been lower-lying, saturated ground and

A second deeper failure zone developed at the ea.tern end of 
the exposed northern highwall in February 1978. In contrast to the 
western end zone its base transgressed into the sandstones under-
lying the upper mudstone sequence. In this length of the highwall 
the sandstones locally exhibited a marked channel .tructure. The 
cau.es of the deepening of the failure to the east is somewhat 
conjectural as close examination of the base of failure was difficult 
due to the development of scree on the slopes. In June 1979, see 
Plate 4.5, it was possible to examine the channel syncline in the 
sandstone and local dips of 150 to the south were measured. Old 
workings in the Dunsil seam may also have contributed to failure in 
this area. Similar channel structures were evident in the opposite 
south highwall without old workings where no such failure within 
sandstones developed. Figure 4.8 depicts the conjectural nature of 
the sandstone structure within the slope and the resultant doubt over 
the baae of the failure. October 1978 saw the eventual meeting of 
eastern and western failure zones. Both zones developed into earth-
flows with opposite migration trends, see Figure 4.8. After October 
1978 tension cracks developed in the backfill loose wall to the east 
and the ea.tern failure appeared to gain in depth. During the 
inundation of the void in late December 1978 water from the rear-
ward cut-off ditch breached the ground at the west to cut a deep 
gully by erosion through the mudstones, see Plate 4.17. During thi. 
period the earthflows accelerated and backsapping formed a virtually 
continuous backscar along the length of the wall by February 1979. 
No significant lateral or longitudinal progression of the failure 
occurred in the remaining eight month life of the void. The complete 
180 m of northern highwall comprising the failures involved approximately 
64000 cubic metres of ground. 
- 288 -
Figure 4.9 reports a back-analysis conducted through a central 
section in the north highwall failure by the Fellenius method with 
a 40 m radius failure circle. These results indicate that, even 
with high groundwater pressures, failure would have required low 
shear strength through the mudstones. Laboratory direct shear 
tests on smooth mudstone joints, see Table 3.2, indicate that such 
a range of low shear strength could have existed within the mud-
stone. These 'tests, however, did not account for the further 
weakening of the mudstones which would have arose from the effects 
of weathering.

4.5.2: Southern Highwall 
Two failure zones developed over the exposed life of the 
southern highwa1l. A central rotational failure of approximately 
11000 cubic metres already existed when the highwal1 was initially 
instrumented in May 1978 (case number 402). A larger, more complex 
failure was then later triggered during December 1978 in the western 
co~er of the highwa11 (case number 404), which developed 
progressively in predominantly a longitudinal sense to eventually 
assimilate the earlier central failure, see Section 4.7. 
The central failure was triggered in August 1977 and within 
two weeks developed a 2 m high backscar, see Figure 4.3. It then 
appeared to stabilise and on May 26th 1978 survey/tilt stations 
510, Sll, S12 were "installed on the centre line of the failure 
orthogonal to the crest, see Figure 4.3. The failure exhibited 
the "features of a rotational mechanism but in addition it was 
apparent that northward rotation had advanced to a g~eater extent 
towards its western end. This resulted in an additional component 
of tilt downward in a westerly sense, see Plate 4.1. The failure 
mass also provided evidenc& of two distinct blocks reflecting the 
observation that failure occurred retrogressively 10 m and then 
20 m back from the slope crest. Piezometer hole 478 had been 
placed centrally in the failure area in August 1973. Figure 4.5 
shows the piezometric data from this hole over a 31 month period 
but no data is available for the period immediately preceding the 
failure. Both piezometer P2 and P5 indicated that the superficials 
were hydraulically linked to the River Aire, despite the sheet 
piling. Water heads above the base of the superficials could 
- 290 -
have been up to 5 m, but this is conjectural since no piezometer 
data is available for the period of the failure. Even during 
relatively dry periods of the 1978 summer strong seepage occurred 
from the base of the failure zone originating from the superficials. 
The failure mass did not, however, degrade into the form of earth-
flow failure under the influence of water as witnessed on the 
opposite northern wall. The reason for the particular location 
of the failure in plan on the highwall is not structurally so 
apparent. The failure did, however, coincide with the promontory 
in the wall caused by its plan convexivity where side restraints 
to the failure block were weakest. This reasoning would also 
explain the fact that over the two year period from its initiation 
the failure did not progress longitudinally either westward or 
eastward. In common with the opposite north wall failure the 
failure zone was confined to the base of the mudstones which again 
was seen to contain the two clay band horizons. The additional 
tilt westward already noted was probably due to the observed 
westerly dip in the sequence and, as with the north wall failure, 
demonstrated a tendency for down-dip post-failure movement. This 
component of failure was subsequently identified by monitoring, 
see Section 4.7. 
Figure 4~10 reports a back-analysis conducted on a central 
cross-section through the rotational failure by the Fellenius 
method using 60 and 80 m radii to represent the bases involved 
in the lateral progression southward of the failure. This 
indicates similar shear strength along the base plane at failure 
as derived for the north highwall failure, c'  0, ~'  250

in the absence of borehole instrumentation. This was aided by 
the fact that the void was planned to remain open for an estimated 
two further years in which time no excavation or filling would 
occur in the void. Access could also be gained to relevant 
- 292 -
locations on the slope face to install survey targets and 
discontinuity displacement devices, a facility which ,was 
severely missed in the highwall monitoring program at Coalfield 
Farm, see Chapter 3. 
The monitoring project enabled the following to be considered 
for alternative survey methods: 
- accuracy and precision attainable in theory and practice; 
- equipment and manpower requirement to achieve desired 
standards; 
- design and field installation of survey stations; 
- number and location of reference, observation and target 
stations; 
- minimum monitoring frequency; 
- appropriate field survey techniques. 
Particular problems posed in designing the scheme were: 
- the depth and inclination of the slope, which necessitated 
siting observation stations close to the rim of the void to 
gain visibility down onto the face area; 
- the development of instability in the length of the northern 
highwall which precluded it as an area for observation 
station placement; 
- the need to design a simple yet comprehensive network which 
could be surveyed on each monitoring occasion by a small 
team, even if possible by one man; 
- 293 -
- in 1978 the N.e.B. Opencast Executive did not have available 
in the area any precise E.D.M. or levelling equipment. The 
author thus decided to employ more conventional equipment 
whenever possible since a lack of such precise equipment was 
widespread through the Executive's Regions and it was desirable 
to demonstrate what precision could be achieved with relatively 
unsophisticated instruments. 
4.6.2: Available Conventional Surveying Techniques and Equipment 
This section reviews the range of techniques considered 
available for monitoring at Lowther and discusses their application 
in the light of field experience gained by the author. 
4.6.2.1: Tacheometry 
Safe access on a slope is required for this technique since 
the method requires placement of a graduated staff or reflector 
at the points requiring location. When using traditional, non-
electronic instruments it provides a quick, convenient technique 
for slope mapping and low-precision monitoring. It is then suitable 
for deriving slope geometries for stability analysis, mapping 
tension cracks and monitoring accessible failures where moderate 
precision is adequate over short distances (100 m). The traditional 
self-reducing, optical tacheometer (S.R.T.) provides all the 
capabilities of a universal theodolite, measuring horizontal and 
vertical angles to better than 1 minute of are, together with the 
means of measuring true horizontal and vertical distances directly. 
There are two types of S.R.T. dependent upon whether the target 
- 294 -
staff is required to be held horizontal or vertical. Due mainly 
to differential refraction of the light rays the vertical staff 
S.R.T. accuracy (1/2000 to 1/3000) is inferior to the horizontal 
staff S.R.T. (1/3000 to 1/6000). The maximum accuracy of 
conventional theodolite tacheometry is recognised te be 1/600. 
Table 4.1 summarises some details of the commercial S.R.T. 
models. A natural limit on the use of S.R.T~ monitoring is the 
reduction in precision as the length of the line of sight exceeds 
50 m due to the difficulty in reading the staff with sufficient 
definition at such range. The monitoring technique is illustrated 
in Figure 4.11 where A, Band C are observation stations spaced no 
more than 50 m apart. Sighting would periodically be made from 
these points on to the target stations shown, measuring on each 
sighting the horizontal and vertical distances together with the 
direction to the target. The target in this instance would be a 
staff held vertically on each station. Target directions would 
be referenced as shown by using station D in stable ground. This 
example demonstrates the problem of needing to monitor the position 
of the observation stations as well as the target stations. This 
would be achieved by carrying survey control from D and other stable 
stations into the failure area. The range limitation of the S.R.T. 
dictates that observation stations are likely to be in close 
proximity to the failure zone and also out of range of the stable 
reference stations. Consequently an alternative survey technique 
would invariably be required to carry control into the observation 
stations. Control over observation stations is paramount and may 
consume an effort comparable to actual target station monitoring.

A promising development in instrumentation has been the 
recently introduced electro-optical tacheometer (E.O.T.) which 
consists of a short range E.D.M. instrument which can be combined 
with a one-second theodolite. This provides the ability to measure 
up to c. 2 km to an accuracy of (5-15 mm). The theodolite alone 
is capable of angular measurement for precise monitor'ing, and the 
addition of the E.D.M. extends its application. Table 4.2 provides 
details of some of the commercial range of instruments. Care is 
necessary when interpreting the specifications quoted by manufacturers 
for their instruments. A theodolite/tacheometer may enable a 
graduated circle reading for a pointing to be estimated for example 
to 0.2 seconds of arc. The angle, however, derived of necessity 
from two pointings may .only be capable of resolution in the same 
example to  2 seconds of arc. The accuracy of E.D.M. instruments 
is quoted as the accuracy of measuring slope distances. Consequently 
the calculation of plan distances is governed by the additional 
accuracy of the method used to reduce slope to plan distance. 
A survey network was establis~d by the author during April 1978 
in Llangollen, North Wales, contained within the larger existing 
Mining Engineering Department network, see Figure 4.15, and 
specifically aimed to serve as a field testing network for short 
range survey monitoring equipment and teChniques. Target stations, 
7 and 9, within the network consisted of 12 em by 12 em by I cm 
brass plates, resin-bonded to be level within cuts chiselled in 
the limestone rockhead, see Plate 4.6. Each plate contained two 
orthogonal rows of eleven holes bored precisely 1 em apart. Net- 
work observation stations 3, 4, 6 and 8 consisted of 7.5 em diameter 
capped steel pipe of 30 en length concreted into bedrock.

An exercise was conducted in April 1978 to assess the 
capabilities of E.O.T. displacement monitoring on this Llangollen 
network. The instrument used was a Kern DM501 E.D.M. mounted on 
a Kern DKM2A one-second theodolite. Plate 4.7 shows the instrument 
set over station 4. Observations were made in turrl from stations 
4 and 6 to the two target stations. The target reflector prism 
was centred respectively over each of the 1 em-spaced holes, 
numbered 1 to 22, in the brass plates. In each of these target 
positions the slope distance together with the direction and 
inclination of the sighting was measured. The height of the 
target and instrument at each of these positions was also measured 
and thence the horizontal and vertical distances between successive 
reflector pcsitions could be computed. The four lines of sight 
had the following characteristics: 
Difference in 
Line Slope Distance (m) 
Elevation (m) 
Gradient 
4-7 78.674 + 38.344 + 29
4-9 147.183 + 54.858 + 22
6-7 41.325 8.194 - 11
6-9 99.048 8.242 - 04
The lines thus represented a realistic range of characteristics 
which might be encountered in an opencast coal mine for shorter 
range monitoring work. 
Table 4.3 summarises the calculated horizontal and vertical 
displacements as measured between successive target points, which 
should be 0.010 m and 0.000 m respectively. These indicate that 
precision deteriorates with increase in length and inclination of

the sighting. This exercise required 4 man days to collect over 
700 data items. The large volume of readings necessitated that 
only one value of vertical and horizontal circle readings on the 
theodolite per sighting was read in order to conserve time. The 
displacement calculation is sensitive to any inaccuracy in horizontal 
and vertical angle measurement. Thus if more horizontal and 
vertical circle readings had been taken on face left and right 
positions then these standard deviation values could probably have 
been reduced significantly. These results demonstrate that reasonable 
precision in displacement measurement, conservatively  4 mm, can 
be achieved taceheometrically with a suitable E.O.T. with relative 
speed and convenience. Experience with Kern and other tripod-
mounted equipment has shown that centering errors and target or 
instrument height measurement errors can each often exceed 1 mm. 
Forced-centering therefore over observation and target stations 
may often be advised in order to improve precision. It became 
apparent during this work that a reflector prism over these 
relatively short distances was not a suitable target for theodolite 
pointing. The results indicated that good precision in actually 
locating points, conservatively  4 mm, can be achieved quickly 
and conveniently with an E.O.T. provided lines of sight are less 
than 200 m. This extension of range reduces the problems referred 
to earlier of adequately maintaining control over observation 
stations from points in stable ground. Occasions, however, may 
still arise in opencast environments when lines exceeding 200 m 
link observation and reference stations. Figure 4.12 illustrates 
such an instance where observation stations A, S, C, D and E would 
be used in the difficult task of monitoring deformation in the 
- 301 -
basal area of a significant pavement slope, e.g. the Llanilid or 
Westfield O.C.C.S. pavement slopes, see Chapter 2. 
The most recent development in survey instrumentation with 
application to monitoring slopes is the 'Electronic Total Station' 
(E.T.S.) which measures both angles and distances electronically. 
The Hewlett-Packard 3820A is a forerunner of this type and combines 
an electronic one-second theodolite, a five kilometer range distance 
measurer and a microprocessor in a single compact unit. Hodges and 
ScobIe (1980, 1981) recently reported on detailed field trials with 
the HP3820A. It was used to survey a laboratory base line, field 
base line, field closed traverse test network and the Llangollen 
test network (Hodges and ScobIe (1974. The authors findings were 
that the manufacturer's claimed performance was readily attained 
(slope distance range 5 km, accuracy  (5 mm + 5 ppm); angular 
resolution horizontal  2 seconds of are, vertical  4 seconds of 
arc). The instrument is ideally suited to undertaking slope 
monitoring and its compactness, range and speed of operation would 
facilitate increased productivity. It could be contemplated not 
only for use in the tacheometric mode but also for intersection, 
trilateration or triangulation work. The current deterrent is 
its cost, about 20,000 in 1980 but this factor will undoubtedly 
reduce over the next few years. 
The major drawback to using electronic instruments besides 
capital cost is the need to use prism reflectors. If reflectors 
are to be set over target stations then accessibility to the station 
is required. If target stations are ~n a highwall face or failing 
mass then this may not be feasible. One solution is to anchor 
- 302 -
prisms permanently to a target station, but conventional prism 
reflectors are expensive, e.g. 270 (1978) per prism for a DM501. 
Plastic reflectors as substitutes for prisms have been used in 
mining but these permit lines of sight only up to c. 200 m, over 
which range inadequate signal return strength is provided. A 
procedure was developed at the Brenda Mine (Blackwell, Pow and 
Keast (1975 to overcome the range deficiency of plastic 
reflectors. A method was established to accurately locate any 
observation position within range in the open pit void itself 
and then transfer this control to the reflector target so that 
observation stations were installed more frequently but with no 
interference from the development of nearby mine benches. A set 
of reference stations on the void periphery were observed from 
each observation station when in use. Angles and distances were 
measured and a combination of triangulation and trilateration used 
to calculate the observation station co-ordinates to  5 mm. 
Further problems associated with permanent reflectors of any 
kind are the formation of dirt and ice coatings which are difficult 
to clear if access is not available. 
Access to the face of the Lowther southern highwall could not 
be guaranteed for the duration of the monitoring period. The 
reliance on E.D.M. techniques to locate face stations was not 
therefore assured and such techniques were only employed to fix 
crest target stations and accessible stations on the eventual 
failure mass. 
- 303-
Mention should be made here of the effectiveness of monitoring 
face reflectors with E.D.M. alone. In the Hogarth Pit, Ontario 
(Brawner, Stacey and Stark (1975 highwall monitoring by tri-
angulation on a daily basis was discounted as being too slow and 
impractical as a long term program. It was decided to measure 
purely by E.D.M. across the pit to crest and face prism reflectors 
in a direction approximating to the line of movement. Their view 
was that this technique still gave an indication of the mode of 
failure and that even if the line of sight and movement directions 
differed by 450 then the scale of the time-movement graph would 
only be reduced by 30 per cent. Thus warning of impending 
instability was still readily available. The E.D.M. monitoring, 
however, was supplemented by periodic triangular surveys to obtain 
3-dimensional movement vectors. 
4.6.2.2: Intersection/Triangulation 
This technique provides for the remote monitoring of targets 
placed at inaccessible locations. It thus overcomes the difficulties 
referred to previously in connection with reflector requirements. 
In Figure 4.12, for example, if the target stations 1 to 11 were 
inaccessible then this technique could be used by observing from 
stations A to E. The principle of the technique is to measure the 
direction to a target on the same occasion from two observation 
stations of known position. In this event the line between the 
observation station~ is best established so as to be parallel with 
the expected direction of target movement, e.g. the west endwall 
for monitoring the Lowther south or nprth highwall slopes.

A major benefit of this technique is that E.D.M. equipment is 
not required for monitoring target stations provided the range from 
the observation station enables precise bisection of suitable targets 
with a precise theodolite. Thus in the above Figure, the direction 
and magnitude of the horizontal distance x is known precisely and 
checked regularly since it cannot ever be assumed that the observation 
stations are stable. Routine monitoring observations then consist 
of measured horizontal angles a and B, together with their respective 
vertical angles. The method hinges about the accurate measurement 
of angles with a precise theodolite. Theodolites may be classified 
as follows: 
(a) Low Order - reading by estimation in the ~ange 5"-15" 
(b) Universal or One-Second - reading directly to 1" 
(c) Precise - reading directly to 0.2" or better. 
- 305 -
Table 4.4 provides details of some of the commercially available 
theodolites in the two latter classes. The order of accuracy required 
in angular measurement is demonstrated by Figure 4.13 together with 
the influence of relative target observation station location. This 
shows that in order to maximise the angular change, a  due to target 
movement then a. should approach 900 and the length of the line of 
sight should be minimized. Note that if the line of target movement 
converges towards the line of the observation stations then undesirably 
the magnitude of a is effectively reduced per unit movement. In an m 
opencast coal site it will invariably be difficult to site observation 
stations so that D is of the order of less then 50 m without resorting 
to the Brenda Mine practice referred to earlier of regarding observation 
targets as temporary installations. Care is necessary in eliminating 
centering errors over observation stations as well as monitoring 
their stability conscientiously. Figure 4.14 shows the effect by 
example of undetected observation station movement on precision. 
This movement, B-B', changes the base line length and direction. the 
resultant changed horizontal angles TAB' and AB'T when used with the 
erroneous old base line length AB produces a false target movement 
in computations. The figure also demonstrates how the ratio of base 
line length to target range affects the sensitivity of the displacement 
calculation to base line errors. A compromise, however, must be 
made between maximising angles TAB, ABT and also the base line 
length to target range ratio.

4.6.2.3: Trilateration 
This technique enables the plan co-ordinates of the third point 
of a triangle to be found when the plan co-ordinates of two points 
and the lengths of the three sides are known. This relies heavily 
on distance measurement, which is more readily achieved precisely 
than angular measurement, and thus entails the use of E.D.M. equipment. 
The problems on slope faces then still arise over the need for access 
to a target station or alternatively for the use of permanently 
placed reflectors. It should be noted, however, that only slope 
distances are directly measured. Derivation of horizontal and 
vertical distances, therefore, in the absence of an E.T.S. requires 
the additional use of a theodolite or level. Precise Spirit levelling 
to targets on a slope face could be arduous if not impractical and 
trigonometrical levelling by theodolite would be normal practice in 
such an instance. Table 4.5 provides details of representative 
medium range commercial E.D.M. instruments. The Kern ME3000 is 
currently the most precise and expensive E.D.M. in this category 
although monitoring might be considered through occasional rental 
rather than purchase of such equipment. A possible alternative to 
E.D.M. equipment for measuring short horizontal distances, under 
40 m, employs the Sub-Tense Bar. A horizontal distance, e.g. an 
observation base line, can be measured with such a Bar and a one-
second theodolite to better than  5 Mm, if necessary by one person, 
provided the range is under 40 m. The effect of an error of 1 
second in the measured horizontal angle sub tended by the 2 metre 
bar at a range of 40 m is a plan distance error of 3.9 mm. Such an 
effect of angular error increases as the square of the range. 
- 308 -
4.6.2.4: Resection 
This is a method in which a target station may be fixed in plan 
by observing horizontal angles with a theodolite from it to a minimum 
of three visible reference stations. Figure 4.15 shows in plan the 
Llangollen Test Network of the Mining Engineering Department, 
Nottingham University, in which the average standard error of the 
horizontal angles, vertical angles and slope distances are  0.5 
seconds of are,  1.0 seconds of arc and  5 mm respectively 
(Hodges and Scoble (1980. Using this network as an 'ideal' case 
it was possible to calculate the plan co-ordinates of any selected 
station, e.g. E, using the actual horizontal angles measured in the 
network to stations C, T, S, Band R. When the seven possible 
combinations of measured angles were used the mean resected co-
ordinates calculated for E were found to agree to 19 mm in easting 
and 11 mm in northing with the accepted values. The effect of 
errors in measuring horizontal angles is demonstrated in an example 
where E is resected from B, S and C as follows: 
Error in observed angle BES Error in calculated co-ordinates of E, m 
(n. b. angle SEC unchanged) Easting Northing 
+ 10" 4.036 0.970 
+ 20" 7.895 1.880 
+ 01' 23.274 5.404 
If in the same example the plan co-ordinates of reference station C 
are altered by +0.05 m and the remaining data for a resection of E 
from B, Sand C is unchanged then the resulting errors in calculated 
easting and northing are + 0.615 m and + 0.175 m respectively. Thus 
great care is necessary in measuring horizontal angles and fixing 
- 309 -
reference stations. Resection again requires supporting trigono-
metrical or spirit levelling to compute elevation values. It also 
entails that a precise theodolite can be safely set over the target 
station in the monitored area. Resection would appear to have little 
application to precise slope monitoring. 
4.6. 3: ~1oni tori n9 Des i 9n a nd Procedures 
The southern highwa11 monitoring scheme was initiated to 
monitor the stability of the full exposed face and crest north of 
the River Aire. At the outset ~o possible future forms of in-
stability were postulated. The first was a shallow-seated rotational 
failure in the upper sequence of mudstones and superficia1s similar 
in nature to the rotational failures existing at the time in the 
southern and northern highwal1s. This was considered not necessarily 
to be associated with the existing central failure. The second 
possibility with more serious implications was the failure of a 
deep block, seated on one of the clay band horizons associated 
with the basal seams. A failure of this nature has been discussed 
earlier in Section 4.5.1 as encountered at the Lowther North O.C.C.S. 
At the start of the scheme the central rotational failure appeared 
to have stabilised but displacement was evident to be occurr~ng at 
the lower of two clay band horizons in the base of the upper mudstone 
sequence. 
It was decided to use target stations distributed over the full 
exposed height of highwal1 face in order to monitor the base movement 
of any possible failure, see Plate 4.1. This entailed the placement 
of nine face stations in order to provide sufficient areal coverage 
- 310 -
whilst also allowing for any future losses due to face erosion, 
ravelling promoted by failure, or burial under scree. Access to 
these stations could not be guaranteed through the life of the face. 
Target stations were also required in the slope crest area to 
monitor the progression of any deformation southward to the River 
Aire. 
The environment was essentially a flat topography around the 
deep void. Observation stations, therefore, needed to be sited 
close to the void rim in order to gain visibility both down on to 
the face as well as to the crest and reference stations at the same 
level. The only rUn area unaffected by instability was the western 
endwall which was well benched and appeared to be stable. 
An' intersection type of monitoring system was adopted originally 
for the following reasons: 
- economics prevented the use of prism reflectors permanently 
attached to face target stations and the range of some lines to 
targets would need to be in the order of 200 m so the use of 
plastic reflectors was discounted. This entailed that any E.D.M  
based technique to fix face target stations was dismissed. 
- access was initially possible to relevant face areas to 
install suitable intersection targets, see Plate 4.8. 
- target" co-ordinates were required to be fix~d to  1 cm. This 
precision limit was not thought to preclude the intersection 
scheme.

~ a system was desired which in fact did not require sophisticated 
survey instrumentation such as precise E.D.M. This was desirable 
so that monitoring could be undertaken by the N.e.B. Area surveying 
staff if ever they chose to take advantage of the monitoring 
network. 
This provided the means for routine monitoring to be under-
taken conveniently by one person if necessary. This consideration 
was also paramount in designing the system for maintaining control 
over the observation stations, as discussed later. 
The western endwall was a suitable location for a line of 
observation stations for intersection work, see Plate 4.9. The 
direction of this line could be established to be parallel with 
the anticipated direction of movement of any likely instability, 
i.e. northward, whilst maintaining sensibly short lines of sight. 
The observation stations would preferably have been sited farther 
southward along this line but, in such positions, visibility to 
the lower half of the slope face would not have been feasible. 
This, however, would have shortened the lines of sight still 
further and provided larger intersection angles, as discussed in 
Section 4.6.2.2. 
Each face intersection target Sl to S9 consisted of a white, 
10 mm diameter steel sphere welded on to one end of aIm long, 
10 mm diameter, steel rebar. These were anchored by resin grout 
into 25 mm diameter drill holes. Drilling was undertaken with an 
electric Wolf Sapphire drill, powered by a Kango 7HP portable 
generator. Target installation was completed by grouting a plastic 
- 312 -
coffee cup, painted bright red, behind the sphere, around the exposed 
length of rebar and to the rock face. This served as a distinct 
marker to aid target location by eye and theodolite. 
A line of three ti1tmeter stations, S10-Sll-S12, was installed 
orthogonal to the crest and river. These comprised 90 mm diameter 
steel standpipes, 1.7 m length with ground, cadmium-plated heads 
for ground tilt measurement by electro1eve1, see Plate 4.10. These 
were anchored with concrete in auger drill holes. A 1.5 mm diameter 
hole had been drilled at the centre of each head to constitute a 
survey point and also accommodate the temporary placement of a white, 
60 mm length pin as an intersection target. The remainder of the 
crest target stations, S13 and 514, comprised 40 em long, 10 cm 
diameter standpipes which were anchored by concrete to their full 
depth. These held a cap which also contained a 1.5 mm diameter 
hole to accommodate a target pin. 
Five observation stations, Wl to W5, were placed precisely 
in-line and about 30 m apart along the west endwall, see Figure 4.2. 
Stations W2 to W5 each comprised a 60 em long, 10 cm diameter steel 
standpipe. A 12 cm diameter, 1 em thick steel cap was designed to 
fit onto the top of the standpipe. It contained a line of five 
1.5 mm diameter holes drilled along a radius and could be locked 
onto the standpipe with the holes in any plan orientation with the 
aid of grub screws and Locktite fluid. Station WI of conventional, 
non-adjustable standpipe design was first fully anchored in a 
suitable location close to the void rim. A DKM2 one-second 
theodolite was then set over WI and used to align the drill holes 
for W2 and WS on the lower benches to the south, see Plate 4.9.

A standpipe was then anchored in each of these four holes. Then 
the following day the caps were attached and rotated (about the 
vertical) so that a target pin placed in one of the line of holes 
drilled in the cap was precisely coincident with the fixed alignment 
provided by the DKM2 at WI. Each cap was then locked in position. 
Five stations were installed to provide against any possible future 
losses due to instability of the highwa11 or vandalism. This 
proved to be a worthwhile investment in effort since one station 
was subsequently inadvertently excavated by the site Contractor 
and two were displaced by gullies formed by the void inundation 
at Christmas 1978. On each consecutive monitoring occasion the 
observation station base line provided a quick, convenient and 
precise method of ensuring that the observation stations were 
stable. By setting the DKM2 over W1 at an instrument height of 
1.65 m it was possible to set out the original direction W1-W5 
from reference station A. Then the telescope could be lowered 
to check the precise alignment of the target pins in each of W2 
to WS. Any displacement or tilt off-line could immediately be 
detected from the location of the target pins with reference to 
the theodolite vertical cross-hair. The higher elevation of Wl 
then enabled the vertical angle to be measured on both faces from 
WI to the point where each target pin entered its respective cap. 
This provided a quick and precise check on the elevation of each 
observation station by one person if necessary and with the added 
assurance of actually being able to see any relative movement of 
observation stations. 
- 314 -
Survey control was maintained over the observation stations 
using reference stations A, D and R in stable ground, see Figure 4.2. 
Station D could be resected from o.s. co-ordinate points in the 
locality. In order to ease computations station W1 was assumed 
initially to have total co-ordinates 0 m E, 1000 m N, 100 m 
elevation and the azimuth of W5-Wl was assumed to be 00  Level 
control was exercised by precise spirit levelling with a Wild NA2 
level and 2 m invar staff, see Plate 4.12, from reference to 
observation stations. A DKM2 theodolite, Sub-Tense Bar and MA100 
E.D.M. were used to fix plan co-ordinates, see Plates 4.9 and 4.13. 
On each monitoring occasion horizontal and vertical inter-
section angles were measured from the observation stations to the 
target by taking a minimum of three double-faced rounds with the 
DKM2 for which a specific booking sheet was designed, Figure 4.16. 
The dimensions of the white target sphere proved to be ideal for 
the length of lines of sight (100 to 200 m). The current observation 
station co-ordinates and intersection angles were then used as input 
for a computer program to calculate the target co-ordinates. 
Section 4 . 9 lists all target co-ordinates with time and the vectors 
of displacement, thence derived, appear in the next section. On 
three occasions the target stations SlO, Sll, S12 and S14 were fixed 
by both intersection and tacheometry using the MA100 and DKM2. 
These results appear in Table 4.6. Good agreement existed between 
the two versions of both Eastings and Reduced Levels but a marked 
difference appeared consistently over Northings. It is felt that 
this was more the result of errors in measuring horizontal inter-
section angles. These would have a more pronounced effect on 
Northings derived by intersection from WI and WS/W4 rather than

by tacheometry from WI. It is felt that the intersection co-ordinates 
derived during the scheme cannot conservatively be claimed to a 
precision better than 1 cm due to the difficulty associated with 
precise angular measurement. In order to improve precision then 
increasing the number of double-faced rounds of theodolite angles 
to six (Davison (1974 or the use of a precise theodolite, e.g. 
the Kern DKM3 or Wild T3, would have been necessary. 
At the start of the scheme two pairs of 50 em long, 15 mm 
diameter rebar rods were resin grouted horizontally into the mud-
stones adjacent to S7 and 58. Each pair was intended to monitor 
relative horizontal movement at the two clay band horizons. Each 
pair comprised parallel-aligned rebars, one below and above the 
clay band. The upper rebar contained a cup seating from which 
a plumb bob could be suspended. The lower rebar enabled the 
attachment of a measurihg scale, graduated in millimetres, which 
by means of an attached spitit bubble could be pivoted to a 
horizontal position. The plumb line could then be read against 
the measuring scale on subsequent occasions to derive the relative 
horizontal displacement occurring between the rebar horizons. 
During the period 28th to 30th December 1978 flood water from 
the River Aire and Fleakingley Beck flowed into the void. Stations 
Wi, W3, W5, 57, 59, 510 and 514 were lost in the process and the 
captive water level covered target stations Sl to 56. The inundation 
coincided with the onset of serious instability at the western end 
of the highwall, case number 404. Additional target stations 515, 
S16 and 517 were installed in January~ 1979 to help monitor the 
mechanism and progression of this failure. These consisted of 
50 cm long, 15 mm diameter steel rebars drilled to accommodate a 
- 318 -
target pin, see Plate 4.11. Observation station 0 was also installed 
at this time. Monitoring thence onwards was undertaken by the 
tacheometry technique, observing with the MA100 and DKM2 to the 
target stations on the failure and crest areas. An AGA Geodimeter 
120 was used on one occasion for this work. Monitoring was continued 
until remedial backfill was level with the highwall crest. The 
inundation unfortunately occurred in the middle of the Christmas 
holiday week. This and the fact that the failure area was too 
hazardous for work in the following fortnight meant that there is 
an unfortunate lack of monitoring data around the time of the 
failure. The monitored data, however, does enable an examination 
of the deformation preceding and subsequent to the failure. It 
also served to detect progression of the instability and to define 
the failure mechanism. At the time of the inundation a critical 
question re~ating to the location of the base of the new failure 
affected the selection of remedial methods. Four alternative methods 
were available. The first option of leaving the water in the void 
was completely unacceptable, representing a significant hazard and 
creating spoil disposal problems for nearby mining operations. The 
second option was to tip backfill into the flood-water, removing 
the water simply by displacement via an overflow channel into the 
river. This offered an immediate start to backfilling operations 
and saved the 'expense of pumping. It also avoided the possibility 
of instability induced by high water pressures in the highwall due 
to rapid drawdown resulting from pumping. The lack of piezometric 
data meant that the hydrology of the highwall at this time was 
conjectural. This option' however entailed that the backfill would 
effectively resemble a slurry, characterised by degraded spoil of 
high moisture content, without the benefit of compaction during 
- 319 -
placement. Subsequent settlement of the backfill would hence be 
significant. Pollution of the river by suspended solids without 
settlement lagoons would also result. A further deterrent was that 
the backfill would represent a significant hazard to any future 
opencast mine sites in close proximity. 
The third option was to pump the void floodwater concurrent 
with backfilling operations. The benefit of this option over the 
second was only that less subsequent settlement might occur with the 
backfill. It did, however, entail the additional expenses incurred 
in pumping whilst also presenting the probable need for settlement 
lagoons to avoid river pollution in th~ form of turbidity and 
sedimentation. 
The fourth option was eventually adopted. It necessitated 
.pumping the void dry before commencing backfilling. This could only 
be contemplated if no doubt existed over the fact that the new 
instability was only contained in the mudstones above water level 
and had stabilised. It must be noted here that the survey data did 
not enable the fact to be stated that no displacement was occurring 
below the water since stations Sl to S6 in the horizons below the 
mudstone were all under water. At an interim time during pumping 
it was possible to sight target S9 as the water level fell and this 
intersection data is discussed in the next Section. Data relating 
to the visible target stations, as discussed later, did however 
indicate clearly that above the water instability was shallow-seated 
in the mudstones based near the interface with the underlying channel 
sandstone. It also provided a means of estimating the likely 
behaviour of this upper highwall section. Complete information in 
this environment could only have been provided by borehole 
- 320 -
instrumentation. If the highwa11 instability was deep-seated then 
the removal of void water and rapid drawdown could have resulted in 
accelerated deformation. Benefits gained by this option were that 
dry, compacted backfill could be installed in lifts to promote 
future stability and minimise settlement. The pumped water was 
also least likely to be a pollutant. Figure 4.21 illustrates the 
structure of the failure zone at three cross-sections on day 257. 
Figure 4.17 shows the results of a back-analysis conducted on a 
cross-section through the failure ~case , using the Fe1lenius 
method with a radius of 50 m for the failure base. These results 
are very s~i1ar to those derived for the other south and north 
highwall failures, case numbers 401 and 402. They indicate that at 
failure, with zero cohesion, the mudstone failure plane exhibited 
a friction angle of 26.

4.7: Southern Highwa11 Deformation History 
4.7.1: Monitoring Data 
The monitoring data consists of survey data for the period 
9th June 1978 to 29th June 1979 (day 1 to 385). Ground tilt 
measurements were taken up to 6th August 1979 (day 423). This 
data is presented in Section 4.9. It has been classified by 
time periods determined by the dates of monitoring and the 
relative degree of deformation. Figures 4.18 to 4.25 are plans 
of the monitored area for each period showing failure features 
developed over the periods, together with vectors of movement 
calculated from ~he survey co-ordinates and changes in gro~nd 
tilt occurring in the period. Figure 4.26 shows the variation 
in ground tilt and elevation over the complete monitoring period. 
Survey stations Sl to S6 were placed in the face below the inter-
face between mudstones and channel sandstone, see Plate 4.1. 
Period up to day 166 (22nd November, 1978) 
This represents the data available up to the period of 
inundation, 28th-30th December 1978 (days 202-204). Over this 
period survey monitoring was mainly conducted by an intersection 
method. No visible signs of instability were evident apart from 
the central rotation~l failure, case number 401, which appeared to 
have stabilised. Examination of Figure 4.18 demonstrates, however, 
that some movement was occurring on the face and crest area. The 
measurement of the failure which subsequently developed places real 
significance to this data. Their significance at the end of 1978 
was not fully appreciated due to the low order of magnitude and 
the lack of experience in assessing deformation trends in Coal 
Measures slopes. The survey data indicated a consistent movement

slightly west of north into the void ranging from 2 to 4 cms. 
Changes in elevation are less consistent and many lie within the 
aimed precision of  1 em. In this light only stations in the 
upper mudstone sequence show significant elevation changes, all 
downward. The direction of movement and drop in elevation in the 
mudstone resembles closely the type of movement established in 
later monitoring when mudstone blocks initially displaced. The 
movement of 511, 512, 513 and S14 on the crest are particularly 
significant. 514 behind the rim in the corner of the void shows 
a comparatively large degree of movement. Its location approximates 
to the initial zone of instability developing in 1979 and indicates 
that there possibly was a period preceding the failure in October 
and November 1978 when ground strain was accumulating. S13 is 
particularly interesting sinee it subsequently became involved in 
the corner failure and also it was possible to monitor its movement 
up to day 385. Preceding day 166 S13 displaces in the same manner 
as determined by survey from observation station 0 in the following 
time period when it visibly failed within a large block. Sll appears 
to have displaced in a similar manner with little influence from 
the existing rotationa~ failure directly to its north whilst 512 
appears to have remained stable. Tilt data shows Sll toppling 
northward, initiating in September 1978, see Figure 4.26. This 
pattern of movement defines a block movement northwards defined 
at its rear by tensile strain between 511 and 512,' 510, within 
the failure mass of the rotational failure, shows the most north-
ward movement with a backward tilt reflecting rotation about a 
horizontal axis. There is a distinct component of tilt, however, 
in an east-west direction which possibly derives from a general 
- 325 -
large block movement west of northward. The central rotational 
failure thus appeared to be still operative, but contained within 
a larger block. 
The rebar stations installed to monitor relative displacement 
occurring at the two clay bands at the base of the mudstone indicated 
that horizontal movement over the lower clay band of 2.7 ems had 
occurred during the period. This should have been corroborated by 
the differential movement occurring between survey stations S7 and 
S8 located nearby, below and above the clay band respectively . 
The differential movement derived from S7 and S8 was 1.3 cms 
in the same direction. This discrepancy of 1.4 ems may have been 
due to the fact that the survey stations were about 2 m distant 
from the rebars, and perhaps demonstrated variation in differential 
movement over that scale. The precision claimed for survey co-
ordinate derivation did not match that for the rebar plumbing 
results, so the discrepancy may not be so significant. The anomaly 
may also result from one or more of the stations being grouted 
within a rock block whose deformation due to loosening and ravelling 
might not r~f1ect the general movement for the ground in the 
vicinity. This point must be borne in mind when installing and 
interpreting the data from such stations. It is intended that 
in future the rebar plumbing stations should also comprise face 
survey target stations. This has an important added benefit of 
providing a means of assessing survey precision. 
The survey stations below the mudstone show only minor upward 
movements in elevation but still exhibit some movement into the 
void with similar directions. Station Sl, however, showed no 
- 326 -
movement in any sense. This apparent anomaly may have been due 
to the fact that all stations but Sl lay within the plan promontory 
of the wall. 
The importance of this set of period's results is that what 
might appear to have been minor displacements in fact were 
significant in defining the characteristics of an impending 
instability. Figure 4.26 indicates that ground strain represented 
by ground tilt and vertical displacement occurred during the 
autumn with some correlation with heavy rainfall periods. 
- 327 -
Day 166 to 243 (plates 4.14 to 4.17) 
This covers the period when the inundation of the void occurred 
(day 202-204). The River Aire backed up Fleakingly Beck to a level 
such that overflow occurred at four major points, see Figure 4.3 
and Plate 4.17. In the western corner of the southern highwal1 the 
largest inflow gully was cut. Target stations Sl to S6 were flooded 
and only SS re-emerged as visible during pumping to be located on 
day 38S. S7, S8, S9 and S14 were lost within the failure area. 
S10 toppled over the face through an evident acceleration in movement 
of the existing rotational failure mass. Additional stations S15, 
S16 and S17 were installed on day 20S. Figure 4.19 de'picts the 
result of events over the period. Rapid northward movements were 
visible at the western end where an earthf10w mechanism was evident 
with horizontal movements estimated at the rate of 30 ems per day 
on day 166. The majority of the mass in this region consisted of 
opencast backfill tipped into the gully in early January in an 
attempt to dam the inflow. The ground mass was apparently saturated. 
Two major tension cracks, see Figure 4.19 and Plates 4.14 and 4.15, 
emanated from this earthf10w zone. These defined two large blocks 
moving apparently in a north-west direction to the void created in 
the earthf10w zone. The eastern block upper surface tilted north-
west at -5~ and the western block tilted b~ck south-eastward at -lSo. 
The migration of. the blocks westward had caused their vertical 
displacement to increase in a westward direction, see Plate 4.14. 
Ice breakage on the void lake indicated movement of failure debris 
over the wall only at the western earthflow zone. The western 
extremity of this zone was clearly defined by a linear scar wall, 
see Plate 4.16. The wall appeared to be relatively dry and remained

stable throughout the duration of the monitoring project. It 
comprised a section of mudstone with ironstone nodule horizons. 
The upper of the two clay bands was evident on the wall and 
exhibited no evidence of displacement. The lower clay band, 
the Barns1ey Rider underclay, lay covered below the level of 
'the earthflow. 2 to 5 cm of failure plane gouge covered part 
of the wall with linear slickenlines dipping at 36
to 400 , 
these were thought to relate to the general failure motion 
within the mudstone before the development of a predominantly 
earthflow mode of failure. 
Displacement data is only available for this period for 511, 
512 and 513. 513 lay on a developing eastern block apparently 
toppling north-westwards. It had moved north-westward by over 
3 m in plan and nearly 4 m in downward elevation. 511 and 512 
had not moved in plan reflecting the tendency for failure to 
develop longitudinally (eastward) and not laterally (southward). 
511, however, gave an indication of an initial tilt northward and 
elevation drop. This instance demonstrates the benefit of the 
sensitivity inherent in ground tilt measurement. Figure 4.26 
shows the two periods of heavy rainfall which appears to have 
triggered and maintained the failure. 
- 330 -
Day 243 to 257 (Flates 4.18 and 4.191 
The placement of additional station S16 in the failure mass, 
see Plate 4.19, and the movement of S13 confirmed over this period 
the tendency of failure blocks to move in an increasingly northward 
sense during their overall westward migration into the earthf10w 
zone. Plate 4.19 shows 516 in the zone where the mudstone block 
degraded, rotating about a horizontal axis to tilt southward at up 
to 250  The earthflow remained active and saturated with an , 
estimated rate of movement of 25 cms per day on day 243. Sll 
continued to exhiBit a northward tilt and tension cracks were 
observed to have migrated eastward in its direction. The three 
stations 512, S15 and 517 offered no evidence that failure mass 
was progressing southward.

Pumping had commenced in this period. S16 continued to move 
west of north but was decelerating. S13 moved in the same direction 
but accelerated as its parent.block apparently plunged, rotating 
down onto a deeper-based failure surface at 34
 The complete 
failure area began to assume a less complex geometry with only 
two tension cracks evident in the face. The easternmost of these 
two traversed the old central rotational failure which appeared to 
have no influence on the definition of the failure block pattern. 
Movement into the void at the eastern end of this block was obvious 
as the benches gradually fell away into the yoid. Sll showed no 
movement over the period although continuation of tension cracking 
eastern towards the station was evident. S12, SIS and S17 on the 
crest also showed negligible movement.

Day 264 to 292 (Plates 4.20 and 4.211 
As in the preceding week progression of the failure was 
demonstrated to be solely eastward. No crest stations exhibited 
any displacement. 513 and 516 exhibited similar rates of move-
ment as in the preceding period. The direction of movement of 
513 had changed to its most westerly magnitude as the parent 
block dropped 6 m in elevation, equal to the total drop of 513 
to date since the flooding. This must have represented a 
steepening rotary movement of the block down at 440 into the 
valley created by the northward earthf10w. It could not be 
accounted for by the moderate 40 dip of bedding.

Day 292 to 342 (Plates 4.22 and 4.23) 
During this period S16 disappeared into the earthflow. A 
marked change in direction of movement occurred for S13 from west-
ward to east of north. By day 342 the failure mass along the 
highwa1l appeared in the form of one simpler block. Decrease in 
volume was occurring slowly along itsface as it moved northward 
over the rim of the underlying sandstone. Its basal surface from 
the lack of tilt on its upper surface appeared to be planar and 
the whole volume appeared as a dis aggregated mass with seepage 
only occurring at its central and western parts, see Plate 4.23. 
It also became noticeable that some small displacement had occurred 
since 1978 in the channel sandstone along bedding planes carrying 
some seepage, see Plate 4.1 in comparison to Plate 4.23. The 
crest area appeared to have remained stable. Backfilling at the 
eastern end of the cut was commenced at the end of this period.

Day 342 to 385 
Backfilling had not during this period reached the elevation 
of the failure. The failure blocks on the face appeared to be 
decelerating in northward movement and the earthflow at the western 
end appeared to have stabilised. Indications of movement on the 
crest were apparent with very slight northward movements and tilts 
together with longitudinal extension of tension cracks. On day 
385 it was possible to sight target S5 again in the channel sand-
stone section. Since day 166 when last monitored, prior to the 
inundation, it had moved 4 cm north-eastward and dropped 10 em 
in elevation. There is always the possibility that scree dropping 
over the rim of the sandstones since day 166 knocked this station 
downward. The change in elevation represents an inclination of 
movement of _680 , which is either erroneous or derives from a 
contrasting mode of instability. More data on 85 and neighbouring 
sandstone targets would be necessary to comment further.

4.7.2: Interpretation of Southern Highwall Instability 
Station S14 had originally been installed on top of the western 
end of the sheet piling. Between day 105 and 166 it dropped 2 cm 
vertically, moving northward by over 1 cm. There was no significantly 
heavy precipitation over this period yet some indication of very 
slight ground deformation is indicated in the western corner by day 
166. The sequence of events which then followed are illustrated 
schematically in Figure 4.27. Unusually heavy precipitation of 
72 mm occurred between day 179 and 193, with 29 mm falling between 
days 179 and 186. The sheet piling did not cut off the west end of 
the highwall as installed. Hydraulic continuity between the slope 
and the River Aire which subsequently rose to flood level was thus 
possible beyond the piling in the area of the west endwall corner  
. It was at this location also that the bund was breached by the 
rising Fleakingly Beck on day 202. A gully was rapidly cut through 
the weak mudstones. Attempts were quickly made to stop flooding 
by tipping opencast spoil into the gully. High water pressures 
developing in the loose backfill and neighbouring weak mudstones 
resulted in the development of an earthflow in the west corner, 
confined solely to the ground west of the end of the sheet piling. 
The earth flow zone was clearly defined to the west by a straight 
north-south face of 65
in the mudstones. No structural feature 
explained the linearity of this face and it must be assumed that 
the constraint provided by the endwall ~esulted in such clearly 
defined limits. Gouge on the face exhibited slickenlines which 
indicated displacement in the mudstones along that line at -400  
This indicated that initial failure of the mudstone occurred by 
shear failure along this side plane and a base plane through the

base of the mudstone. Resultant dilation and water seepage then 
promoted the involvement of the mudstone in the earthflow. No 
westward progression of the failure occurred subsequently,due to 
adverse mudstone bedding dips to the west and the drainage of 
this area via the earthflow zone. The failure of the mudstones 
thence removed a westerly end restraint which triggered longitudinal 
progression of the failure eastward. This resulted by the breakage 
of the mudstone into three main blocks. These adopted a similar 
pattern of displacement rotating in plan northwards as they 
migrated down dip west towards the growing corner void. Initial 
vertical displacement tended to take the form of toppling which 
developed into backward rotation on approaching the void as an 
evidently deeper zone of disturbance was entered. 
20 mm of rain fell between days 228 and 221. contributing to 
the development of the instability eastward. By day 264 the zone 
of degraded mudstone in an earthflow mode had widened eastward but 
thinned with a gradual improvement in drainage. Deceleration of 
the flow resulted, but the longitudinal progression of the failure 
continued eastward, transgressing the old central rotational failure, 
case number 402. By day 285 the highwall instability had approached 
equilibrium having progressed eastward along the complete length of 
exposed highwall. Lateral progression southward from the crest had 
only been significant in the zone of the earthflow although survey 
data indicated at' this time slight indications of northward tilt 
and ground strain near the river. At no point did the failure zone 
penetrate into the underlying sandstones. 
- 345 -
4.8: Sumnary 
Ground deformation leading to catastrophic failure developed 
and was monitored over a 400 day period. Experience at a previous, 
nearby site had indicated that gross deformation might be anticipated 
in the mine slopes due to translational sliding of blocks on deep, 
flat-lying clay bands. Fractures propagated by deep mine subsidence 
were anticipated to provide both potential release planes and 
hydraulic continuity between significant confined aquifers and 
surface water to promote such failure. Such failure did not develop, 
however, despite evidence from piezometric data indicating that 
hydraulic continuity to aquifers at depth did exist. Drawdown of 
aquifer groundwater due to excavation appeared to outweigh recharge 
afforded by such hydraulic continuity and maintain groundwater 
pressures at levels which did not place such blocks at risk. Little 
evidence of any displacement on clay band horizons was observed. 
Progressive longitudinal failure developed on the north and 
south highwall slopes along their complete length. These failure 
zones were consistent in character, resembling that of a nearby 
failure over the same sequence in a highwall at St. Aidans O.C.C.S., 
case number 209 , chapter 2. These failures developed the following 
apparent, .common characteristics: 
- confined to a 20 m deep base in weak, fragmented mudstone with 
no vertical extension down into a 30 m thick strong sandstone 
foundation; 
- limited lateral penetration to less tQan 10 m rear of the 
slope crest but extensive longitudinal extension to affected 
lengths in excess of 180 m; 
- 346 -
the failure process was influenced by the overall strata dip -
failure progressed retrogressively up dip with movement occurring 
into the void with a down dip component; 
- promoted by ingress of water into the mudstone from the over-
lying alluvial aquifer, mine lagoons or river floods; 
- the basic failure mechanism appeared to be a quasi-rotational 
mode with the consequent development of earthflow features; 
- the shear strength at failure derived by back-analysis for the 
mudstone was in the range c'  0 to 20 kN/m
, ~'  20 to 250 , 
i.e. weaker than values obtained by direct shear tests on dry, 
smooth, unweathered mudstone joints. 
The same geological sequence in the west endwall slope, in sharp 
contrast, remained stable throughout its life. This resulted from 
the fact that here the strata dipped into the slope and a reduced 
slope angle of 23
had been cut into the upper mudstone sequence. 
The critical final south highwall failure highlighted the 
importance of groundwater and river flow monitoring in order to 
assess the effectiveness of sheet piling, flood bund and slope 
design in avoiding instability. 
The selected intersection method of survey monitoring 
integrated with ground tilt measurement met the requirements 
of precision, convenience and economy. The range of equipment 
and stations proved to be satisfactory and durable. The monitoring 
technique possessed a suitable sensitivity to delineate the onset 
of instability. The project, however, proved conclusively the 
necessity to monitor at an appropriate minimum frequency for the use of 
- 347 -
monitoring as a predictive tool. A weekly frequency of monitoring 
would have satisfied this requirement. It should also be noted 
that periods of inactivity in a mine, over weekends or vacations, 
cannot be guaranteed to be free of instability incident. The 
vagaries of the weather must be appreciated.

CHAPTER 5 
GROUND DEFORt1ATION ASSOCIATED WITH DRAGLINE 
MINING - LOW CLOSE MINE 
5.1: Introduction 
The Low Close mine is situated in Broughton Moor near 
Cockermouth, Cumbria. .It covers around 45 hectares and was 
initially planned to recover 900,000 tons of coal from 13 
seams, to a maximum depth of 97 m. The site mining contractor 
is Shepherd Hill Ltd. Coaling commenced on 1st April 1975 and 
700,000 tons of coal had been recovered by September 1979. 
This monitoring project was prompted by the need to 
reliably predict the magnitude and range of ground movements 
adjacent to working mine slopes. The deformation occurring 
over the short term resulting directly from mining excavation, 
as well as the long term, where an external mine slope may be 
exposed for a number of years, are two important aspects of 
this same problem. The short term deformation may in part 
be due to the actual movement of mine plant. Developing 
predictive tools is hindered by the fact that mine slopes 
may have similar geometries, excavated by comparable methods 
and equipment, but that these will invariably contain variations 
in geological, hydrological and old underground working features. 
The selection of an appropriate slope location for a monitoring 
project is hence difficult if it is required to generalise and 
apply results to other mine environments. Reliable evidence 
for predicting the ground deformation adjacent to future surface 
- 355 -
mines is of direct value as an aid to mine design in particular 
environments. U.K. surface coal mines are often unavoidably 
sited in close proximity to utilities such as roads, railways, 
rivers, pipelines and buildings. 
The Low Close monitoring project was regarded as the first 
of a series of such instrumented slopes which eventually would 
clarify the range of deformation associated with various mine 
environments. The instrumented slope at Low Close facilitated 
the study of a comparitively simple geological and working 
environment which was representative of a commonplace mining 
situation. At the time of the initiation of the project a 
public enquiry was imminent on a proposed opencast operation 
in northern England which involved a similar working enviroment 
with a natural gas pipeline in the vicinity of one of the proposed 
mine external slopes. 
The instrumented slope comprised a 13 to 17 m highwal1 
excavated by crawler drag line in a sequence of 15 to 20 m wide 
strike cuts. The Main seam was worked at its base, overlain by 
a sequence of mudstones and siltstones with an upper cover of 
boulder clay. Extensive old workings existed in the seams' 
leaves and the project enabled the first attempt at quantifying 
the behaviour characteristics of old workings in the vicinity 
of a working mine slope. This added element entailed some 
innovation in monitoring technique. A related benefit of the 
project was the opportunity to assess the performance and 
suitability of the adopted monitoring instrumentation and 
procedures. 
- 356 -
Previous work on ground deformation associated with mining 
activity is sparse. Burland et al (1977) reported on a comprehensive 
study of ground movement around a 29 m deep brick pit in over-
consolidated OXford clay, but other published research relates 
to shallow excavations, predominantly in soils and of a civil 
engineering nature. 
The instrumentation was installed in October 1978 to cover 
a panel of ground 80 m long by 45 m wide, sited orthogonal to 
the working strike cut highwall, see Figure 5.1. This layout 
was intended to provide a working life for the instrumentation 
equivalent to three strike cuts, worked from south to north by 
dragline. Funding dictated that six borehole extensometers 
could be employed to monitor subsurface vertical deformation. 
In order to study the behaviour of the old workings underlying 
the panel it was decided that all the extensometers be installed 
in boreholes drilled through the workings. Ideally, it was 
desirable to also install boreholes through pillar areas, but 
this would have entailed a reduction in the number of cuts 
effectively studied. One study priority was to determine the 
collapse characteristics with time of the old workings. 
The instrumentation panel was aligned along a central axis 
comprising the six constant tension borehole extensometers, El 
to E6, all sited through old workings and 10 m apart. Four 
extensometer reference points were installed in each borehole, 
three above and one below the old workings. An array of eleven 
ground tilt stations, Tl to TIl, were also installed in'two 
lines flanking the extensometer line by 10 m to the north and

south. The extensometer heads and tilt platforms also served 
as survey stations. In August 1979 an additional continuous-
reading ti1tmeter station, Tl7, was installed, see Figure 5.1. 
The panel instrumentation was then completed by installing four 
lines of survey stations, Sl to S16, andpiezometers L to N. 
The resultant density of monitoring stations was thus equivalent 
to a 5 m by 5 m grid which was considered to be adequate to 
define the development of any localised surface settlement due 
either to collapse over rooms or their intersections. Following 
the excavation of the first strike cut through the panel four 
tilt and eight survey stations were reinstalled at the rear of 
the panel, Tl3 to T16 and S17 to S24 respectively. Survey control 
was maintained by N.e.B. staff from two concrete survey pillars, 
P1 and P2, controlled within the mine survey network. 
Monitoring was maintained until September 1980, a period of 
671 days, representing three full strike cuts through the panel. 
A prolonged twelve month period elapsed between the first and 
second cuts which was not initially anticipated, arising f~om 
mine production problems and an industrial dispute. This 
extended interval, however, enabled a longer term study of the 
deformation of the second highwall and the provision of firm 
background data preceding the final two cuts. The highwall when 
the panel was initially instrumented had been standing for one 
month and so its complete post-excavation behaviour was not 
determinate. 
- 359 -
The selection of the location of the project panel, in 
coaling area 011, at the northern end of the highwall was 
unadvoidable as it was the only location to afford the required 
environment with an adequate panel depth of 80 m perpendicular 
to the highwall within the site boundary. This also afforded 
enough space between the western panel boundary and the site 
boundary for the mining contractor to place a haul road for 
forward reduction work in the adjacent southern coaling area, 
01, when subsequently required. The practical constraints to 
the choice of panel siting did, however, entail that there 
were subsequent occasions when the panel face was flanked to 
the north by a strike cut endwall. This was not the original 
intention at the project design stage, but arose from subsequent 
mining problems. 
The duration of the monitoring period was such that the 
project experienced two winters and two summers. The winter 
of 1978-79 and its following summer were both exceptional. 
The former was the coldest recorded this century and the latter 
the wettest. The influence of climatic effects on both deformation 
and its monitoring was thus an added aspect to the study. During 
December and January 1980 earthquake activity also occurred with 
its epicentre north of Carlisle, but no effect on the project 
monitoring was registered.

5.2: Project Slope Environment 
5.2.1: Geology 
The Low Close mine comprises a faulted block defined by 
two steeply-dipping normal faults, the Alice fault to the north-
east and the Bertha fault to the south-east. The strata is part 
of the Middle and Lower Coal Measures consisting of coal seams, 
shales, mudstones, siltstones and sandstones grading into shaly 
sandstones with seatearths and occasional thin clay bands. 
Impersistent bands of nodular ironstone are common throughout 
the section. 
The instrumentation panel was sited in working area DII of 
the site where only the' Main seam of the succession was extracted. 
This seam occurs in three leaves. The upper leaf is the Crow, 
on average 0.5 m thick. It is usually encountered unworked by 
previous underground operations and is separated from the middle 
leaf, the Metal, by a competent mudstone parting 0.9 to 1.8 m 
in thickness. The Metal in the project area was observed to 
have split into three further leaves of 0.3, 0.4 and 0.2 m 
thickness with an upper strong shale parting containing iron-
stone nodules (0.2 m thick) and a soft grey seatearth lower 
parting. The Metal was underlain by 0.3 m of weak shale and 
then the 0.8 m Cannel leaf. 
Figure 5.2 shows details of the panel geology in longitudinal 
section based on core logging of the extensometer boreholes. The 
Crow seam ~s overlain by a fairly consistent 5 m thickness of 
soft grey mudstone becoming more silty to its base, but markedly

softened and broken within 2 m of its overlying boulder clay cover. 
On exposure this mudstone weathered rapidly to typical maximum 
block sizes of 10 x 10 x 15 ODS by intact breakage along and 
across bedding planes, with little influence from the non-systematic 
jointing. Borehole core through this unit gave recovery values 
under 30% and zero R.Q.D. values, indicative of its weak and 
fragmented nature. Joint mapping in the mudstone and an over-
lying sandstone unit, exposed 100 m south of the project panel, 
indicated two joint sets in the highwall with the following 
characteristics: 
dominant set, 2-3 m spacing and persistence, flat, smooth, 
closed and non-filled, 850 dip on an azimuth of 0300 , 
- minor set, irregular spacing, persistence under 1 m, flat 
and curved, smooth, closed and non-filled, 800 dip on an 
azimuth of 1100  
The Crow seam appeared to be unworked in all panel boreholes, 
each of which encountered old workings in the Metal and Cannel 
seams. A cleat survey conducted in the unworked Crow seam revealed 
one dominant set, dipping at 880 on an azimuth of 0450 , often 
containing a 2-3 m thick pyrite infilling. A second, less well-
defined and more discontinuous set dipped at 860 on an azimuth 
of 1400  These cleat directions matched the two dominant 
directions of old workings in the Metal and Cannel seams at that 
locality, although examination of the mapped workings over a 
wider area indicated the regional variation in cleat direction. 
The parting between the Crow and ~~tal seams as observed in cores 
and panel faces cansisted of dark carbonaceous mudstone and shale 
- 363 -
with occasional ironstone nodule horizons. Jointing characteristics 
were similar to those in the overlying burden, but a greater degree 
of competence was indicated by a typical block size of 20 x 20 x 
30 ems. 
The true dip of the Coal Measures in the panel area was 
4.40 (1 in 13) in a direction 2010  
Superficial deposits of brown boulder clay with some sand 
and gravel cover the mine area, ranging from 2 m up to 28 m in 
thickness within occasional drift-filled channels. Figure 5.3 
shows isopachytes of drift cover in the panel area. This 
indicates the significant thickening of drift to the west and 
north in the panel vicinity, see Plate 5.10. The Low Close 
brown boulder clay is thought to be derived from glacial ice-
fronts emanating westwards from the Lake District. Further 
west in Cumbria the boulder clay also becomes red and sandier 
being derived from the Solway glaciation of predominantly 
Permo-Triassic rocks. 
5.2.2: Geotechnical Laboratory Testing 
Boulder Clay 
Two boreholes (7011 and 7005) were placed in the brown Low 
Close boulder clay within the project panel together with a bulk 
sample in October 1979, Rainbow (1980). Samples from this 
exercise were tested by the N.C.B. and are now reporte8. Table 
5.1 contains a summary of index properties. Multi-stage quick 
undrained triaxial compression tests were conducted on these

samples with no pore water pressure measurement. A 38 mm test 
cell was used with minus 6.3 mm materials at their natural bulk 
density and moisture content. These gave a mean cohesion of 
125 kN/m2 and a mean angle of internal friction of 18.5. Tests 
were also conducted in -a 100 mm cell for multi-stage quick 
undrained triaxial compression with measurement of pore pressure. 
These gave a mean cohesion of 20 kN/m and mean angle of internal 
o friction of 22.7. One-dimensional consolidation tests were 
carried out in an oedometer using a 100 mm consolidation cell 
at natural moisture content and bulk density values. These 
gave a mean coefficient of volume compressibility, for a 100 kN/m2 
increment, of 0.16 m
/MN. The voids raotio versus log pressure 
obtained from the one-dimensional consolidation of all samples 
conformed with that produced by over-consolidated clay. Table 
S.2 reports the results of consolidated-drained direct shear 
testing on remoulded samples over a range of moisture contents. 
A 6 x 6 em shear box was used with a range of 21 hour normal 
consolidation loading of 100, 200 and 300 kN/m2 A 0.037 mm/min 
strain rate was employed in the shearing stage. 
Coal Measures 
Field and laboratory tests made on the mudstone and shale 
units above and below the Crow seam are summarised in Table 5.3. 
Field readings were taken with a Schmidt Hammer (type L) on 
freshly exposed faces. Block samples were collected for laboratory 
uniaxial compressive strength and slake durability testing. Only 
five samples from the borehole core sticks could be used for

compressive testing (hole ES, S to 10 m depth) due to core 
breakage. 
The benefit 
of leav~ng the shale and its overlying Crow seam intact as 
part of the roof for old workings in the lower Cannel and 
Metal seams was always evident on inspection of exposed slope 
faces in the area. This indicated that partial collapse above 
old workings had generally occurred prior to contemporary 
surface mining, but had seldom migrated to a level above the 
Crow seam. The superior strength and durability of the shale 
is evident fram Table 5.3, and would likely be reinforced 
further in sections containing ironstone nodule horizons. 
5.2.3: Old Underground Workings 
'General - Broughton Moor on which the Low Close mine is 
sited has been the location of a number of past colliery operations. 
These underground workings operated mainly in the 19th Century 
although some mine plans of that age contain remarks such as 
"  working in part left by old men", Lawrence (1979). The 
most recent operating local collieries were the Bertha Pit 
(also named Broughton Moor Colliery on the north-west corner 
of the opencast site), abandoned in 1924, and the Buckhi1l 
Colliery (1 mile south-west of the s~te), abandoned in 1932. 
Exploration drilling, opencast mining and remarks on old records, 
however, indicate that the l~its to workings shown on available 
abandoned mine plans are not particularly precise. 
- 368 -
The Ten Quarters seam, highest in the mine sequence, was 
worked from the Bertha Pit. The nearest workings, dated 1870, 
occur 430 m south-west of the project panel. This seam is above 
the Main seam and is separated from the panel by a number of 
faults. The Main seam worked as the Crow, Metal and Cannel 
leaves occur under the panel area, although the Crow was usually 
unworked. It appeared that the old men were aware of the 
enhanced roof stability provided by leaving the Crow coal and 
its underlying strong shale parting. Detailed records dated 
1846, Lawrence (1979), show Main coal workings south-east and 
north-west from the Road End Pit in the Metal and Cannel seams, 
with records of older workings outside the limits indicated. 
Records dated between 1871 and 1887 show detailed workings 
from Bertha Pit, south-west of the Road End Pit again with 
remarks of old workings outside the shown limits. One plan, 
NC206, undated but for a remark of 1883 indicated workings, 
including shafts or bell pits, in the Metal seam extending 
under the project panel. These areas have subsequently been 
confirmed by drilling and mine excavations, see Figure 5.4. 
The Yard seam, 20 m below the Main and 0.5 m thick, was 
worked from the Bertha Pit up to 1924. Abandonment plans 
indicated that these workings did not extend under the project 
panel, and this is yet to .be confirmed by drilling or excavation. 
Old workings in the Little Main seam, 30 m below the Yard and 
0.5 m thick, underlie the project panel. The northern corner 
of the panel is also underlain by old workings in the Six 
Quarters seam, 25 m below the Little Main seam and 0.6 m thick.

The lowest sequence seam, the Upper Threequarters, 30 m below 
the Six Quarters seam and 0.9 m thick, was also worked under 
the project panel. 
Metal and Cannel Seam Workings in the Project Panel Area -
No evidence was encountered in drilling or excavation of old 
workings in the Crow leaf to the Main seam. As the strike cuts 
were taken through the project panel parti~ular care. was taken 
to survey the old workings in the Metal and Cannel seams. These 
are shown in Figure 5.4 and partial extraction was clearly by a 
roam and pillar mining method with wide variation in pillar 
size. The orientation of rooms follows closely the variation 
in cleat in the coal seams over the area. 
Figure 5.S is a longitudinal section through an old drive, 
aligned along the extensometer panel centre line, evident on 
the northern section of the initial panel face in October 1978, 
see Plate 5.1. No visible roof collapse was evident in this 
drive until 7 m inbye when void migration to 0.8 m above roof 
level into the Crow-Metal parting was evident.

Figure 5.5: Section through old mine drive in project panel

The next southern exposed drive in the same face, however, 
exhibited void migration to 3 m above roof level. A similar 
vertical limit to void migration was also observed in the panel 
boreholes although subsequent panel faces exhibited migr~tion 
up to 5 m above roof level. Collapse features above the Crow 
seam were not observed in the project panel surface area. No 
evidence of crown hole development or related subsidence was 
identified on the surface in the panel area during the project. 
Drive dimensions in the old workings ranged from 1 to 1.8 m in 
width and 2 to 3 m in height. The old Metal and Cannel workings 
often were found to be coincident, resulting in 3 m room heights.

5.2.4: Mining Method and Schedule 
The 13-17 m deep, 15-20 m wide strike cuts were worked from 
south to north by crawler dragline, (RB1l0 or Lima 2400), which 
produced panel face inclinations of 65-700  This -Was achieved by 
removing the Crow overburden from the highwall side and then 
subsequently removing the Crow/Metal and Metal/Cannel partings 
by moving to sit on the low wall. Coaling operations were 
conducted with a RB22 shovel. A c.alendar summary of monitoring 
and excavation events now follows, and is illustrated in Figure

Activity 
Last precise survey undertaken 
Remaining instruments removed to prepare for 
stand of Manitowoc 6400 approaching from south 
with 4th strike cut. 
Forward reduction in the southern end of coaling area DI was 
achieved with the crawler draglines or an 0 and K RH75 face shovel 
with 3 Terex R70 dump trucks'. This required a haul road to be 
created in February 1979 to provide truck access north-south along 
the highwall. 
The monitoring project was required to account not only for 
rebound deformation resulting from stress release due to mining, 
but also for deformation caused more directly by the operation 
of mine plant. The effect of such plant movement on panel ground 
deformation is discussed later in Section 5.4.5. The RBllO 
dragline working weight was 165 tonnes with a bearing pressure 
of 162 kN/m2 The Lima 2400 drag line working weight was 208 
tonnes with a bearing pressure of 91 kN/m
5.3: Monitoring System 
5.3.1: Panel Preparatlon 
During August 1978 prior to instrumentation the topsoil and 
subsoil was stripped from area DII to provide an even surface 
reflecting the local topography. This dipped gently to the south-
east as shown by the surface contours on Figure 5.1. In October 
1978 a secure fence was erected around the instrumentation panel 
- 376 -
to prevent entry of any vehicles. This was sequentially 
retreated as the strike cuts worked through the panel. 
Dragline movement was confined to within each 20 m wide 
cut as it was carried through the panel. Instrumentation 
directly within its path during such a traverse through 
the panel was removed when 20 m distant from the advancing 
dragline. 
5.3.2: Borehole Extensometers 
Six constant-strain wire extensometer installations, 
El to E6, were completed in October 1978, with four reference 
point anchors per hole, located as shown in Figure 5.2. Three 
anchors were inserted above the old workings and one anchor 
a minimum of 1 m below their floor in the Cannel seam seat-
earth. The anchor desi~~_~~~~~llation was developed 
specifically for the project to enable secure fixture within

weak and fragmented ground, with possible pronounced dilation 
due to void migration above old workings. Each reference 
point was grouted in place with Celtite MAlOO resin grout 
pumped within a 40 em long compartment sealed by an upper 
and lower sorbo-rubber seal. These anchors were sited at 
the appropriate horizon with extension insertion rods. Steel 
flanges at the top and bottom of the anchor provided support 
for the rubber seals and their 12.5 em diameter enabled their 
passage attached to the insertion rods down through the 12.7 em 
diameter drill casing. Once in position the anchor was held 
stationary whilst the casing was pulled by at least 1 m above 
- 377 -
the anchor. This then allowed the 17.0 cm diameter sorbo-
rubber seals to expand to seal off the anchor compartment 
prior to grouting. After having pumped full the sealed 
compartment with grout the grout feed tube was removed and 
reattached to the next anchor which then could be fed down 
the casing with the insertion rods to its required location 
in the hole. Consideration was given to prefabrication of 
the extensometer prior to field installation~buf-the adopted 
system enabled the-flexibility of selectfng the-- reference point 
locations upon completion of the drilling. Such features as 
the depth of boulder clay and extent of void migration could 
not be predicted reliably before drilling. Insertion through 
. casing was necessary in order to place anchors below voids or 
, i~~se ground. The large anchors were considered appropriate 
--. -. 
in such poor ground. The subsequentextensometer data shows 
that they provided effective anchorage with no indication of 
slippage. Plate 5.2 shows one of two such anchor points 
salvaged from borehole E3 in January 1980 when exposed by 
drag line excavation of the second cut through the panel. Field 
inspection of these points confirmed their secure fixing. 
The extensometers were of the constant-strain wire type, 
Young (1979), in which changes in wire length were recorded by 
micrometer depth gauge, reading di~e_ctly to 0.0001 m, on the 
measuring head. Frequency of reading was dictated by the 
mining activity, varying from hourly to fortnightly. Over 
a two day period in August 1979 a specific study was made of 
anchor displacement using dial gauges set permanently to reaq 
;'U . Jr. 
Plate 5.2: Salvaged E3 borehole extensometer reference point , January 1980 (unused one to rear).

on the measuring heads, see Section 5.4.5. Points were scribed 
on each measuring head to serve also as survey points. The 
complete borehole extensometer data is presented in Figure 5.7 
and tabulated in Section 5.8. This data has been computed per 
borehole as the reference point displacement relative to the 
lowest reference point (number 1 sited below the old workings) 
with respect to day 45. The use of day 45 as a datum was 
selected to allow ample time for the reference points to 
settle whilst affording sufficient background data prior to 
the first strike cut through the panel. It also corresponded 
to the day for which precise survey data was first available. 
The validity of the assumption of the stationarity of each 
reference point below the old workings could then be assessed-
------ ~.---.- -
by comparison with-precise levelling data. A comparison could 
be made of the measuring head, i.e. ground surface, vertical 
displacement so derived from the extensometer data with the 
corresponding displacement derived from precise levelling, 
again referred to day 45. 
5.3.3: Ground Tilt Measurement 
Eleven ground tilt stations were installed in the panel in 
October 1978, Tl to Tll. These consisted of 1.5 m long, 10 cm 
diameter steel standpipes which were concrete-grouted over 
their full length in 15 em diameter boreholes. Each standpipe 
held a machined, plated platform on which was measured the 
standpipe tilt in orthogonal directions (paralle~ and perpendicular 
to the panel long axis). Tilt measurements were ~~corded by a 
Tilt Measurement Ltd. electrolevel over the range 0-10 mm/m, 
Ver t ical displacement with t ime 
for borehole e.tensometer re ference points.

0-2 mm/m and 0-.5 mm/m, readings in the latter range being 
estimated to 0.001 mm/m. In February 1979, following the 
first cut, four tilt stations were re-installed at the rear 
of the panel, see Figure 5.1. Figures 5.8 and 5.9 show the 
variation in downward ground tilt for each station comprising 
the two lines through the panel, during the complete monitoring 
project. In August 1979 a continuous recording tiltmeter, T17, 
was installed 5 m to the rear of El to record automatically 
the ground tilt parallel to the panel long axis. It was also 
possible to manually measure the tilt perpendicular to th~s 
axis on monitoring occasions. A datum tilt station was also 
installed off-site beside a nearby hou~e to provide check data 
to assess any instrumental drift in the project e~ectro1evel. 
This proved to be negligible. All panel ground tilt stations 
were used as survey monitoring stations. 
5.3.4: Precise Surveying 
Precise surveys were conducted by N.e.B. Area staff, 
Huddart (1979), at intervals up to monthly, dependent upon 
mining activity in the panel area. Datum pillars Pl and P2, 
see Figure 5.4, were established some 180 m west of the panel 
rear boundary each with its own secure containing fence. Pl 
was fixed by bearing and EDM distance from mine beacons and 
levelled by standard precise practice. P2 was then located 
by bearing and distance. The distance between the pillars 
was divided into four bays and measured in both directions 
three t~es and on separate occasions py steel tape in catenary. 
Control was maintained on the pillars from the other mine beacons.

Precise levelling was undertaken with a Wild NA2 automatic 
precise level, equipped with a parallel plate micrometer, using 
a 2 m invar staff. On each monitoring occasion a level circuit 
was run from the pillars to survey station 517 in the panel, 
closing back on to the pillars. Misclosure was commonly less 
than 0.0001 m. From 517 the panel survey stations were then 
carefully levelled, by taking a double reading on each, with a 
precision of less than  0.0001 m. 
Sets of sixteen and eight stations specifically to serve 
as survey stations were installed in the panel in November 1978 
and February 1979 respectively. These initially consisted of 
1 m long, 0.01 m diameter steel rebars, with a brass cap 
containing a central 0.5 mm diameter hole. It was intended 
that these should be fully concrete-grouted in 1.2 m deep, 
. 10 em diameter holes. Difficulties were encountered in 
manually boring the holes by augering and the. later use of 
a stihl power auger only slightly overcame the problem of 
penetrating the boulder clay.. Several stations were consequently 
installed with insufficient concrete at depth and as a result 
the subsequent extreme temperatures of the 1978-79 winter 
and associated boulder clay surface heave caused the loss of 
some stations. These stations were relocated and a heavier 
2 em diameter rebar was used. 
The plan co-ordinates of stations 55, 56, 59, 510, T13, 
T14, TIS, TI6 and TI7 were derived by intersection from pillars 
Pl and P2 using horizontal angles measured with a Wild T2 
theodolite. This work presented the greatest challenge to 
- 384 -
precision. Three double-faced rounds of angles were taken to 
each target station with a maximum acceptable spread of 6 seconds 
of arc, and an overall standard error of  2 seconds of arc. The 
intersected stations were then used to tape to the remaining 
stations using a standardized steel tape to enable co-ordinate 
calculation by trilateration. Such taped distances should have 
been accurate to  0.001 m, but the intended reference marks 
on tilt and extensometer stations proved to be difficult to 
use and hindered achieving this standard. The estimated 
precision for the resolution of horizontal co-ordinates was 
 0.003 m with 75% confidence limits, Huddart (1979). A 
complete record of the co-ordinates and levels measured for 
each ~anel station during the project is given in Section 5.8. 
Figures 5.10, 5.11 and 5.12 show the vertical displacements 
of the three lines of stations, aligned along the panel long 
axis, over the complete monitoring period until lost by 
excavation. Note that although this data is shown as joined 
by straight lines, this has been done only to indicate the 
trend of movement and not to represent the actual behaviour 
of each station between monitoring occasions. The variation 
in plan co-ordinates and level of each station is also 
illustrated later in Section 5.4 for specific periods defined 
by mining activity. All computed displacements are illustrated, 
but the precision of the surVey monitoring system should be 
recognised when assessing the magnitude and direction of such 
computed deformation.

5.3.5: Piezometers 
Three Casagrande standpipe type piezometers (L, M and N) 
 were installed in the panel in October 1978, see Figure 5.1. 
These contained tips at 1 m (in boulder clay) and 13 to 14 m 
(below old workings). M and N were excavated in the first 
strike cut and L was excavated in the second cut. These were 
read at weekly to fortnightly intervals. Throughout their 
working lives they indicated steady, low groundwater pressures 
(less than 0.25 m head) at both horizons. In hindsight it 
would have been desirable to have had piezometers to the rear 
of the panel in order to study in more detail the extent of 
drawdown associated with successive strike cuts. 
5.4: Observed Monitoring Data 
5.4.1: Introduction 
The monitored ground movement is presented herein for a 
sequence of eleven periods over the duration of the project, 
as defined by various mining activities. Ground movement in 
the project panel is considered to result from the following 
possible causes: 
- removal of each volume of strike cut ground 
- variation in surface temperatures, precipitation and groundwater 
conditions 
- movement of mine plant, principally the crawler dragline at 
the front of the panel 
- 389 -
- ground instability developing at each working face 
- collapse above old underground workings, possibly linked to 
the aforementioned instability. 
Based on considerations discussed in Section 5.3, significant 
(i.e. reliablY identifiable) movement is regarded as that exceeding 
5 mm in plan, 1 mm vertically (at both surface and sub-surface) 
and 1 mm/m in ground tilt. A benefit of borehole instrumentation, 
in addition to the identification of collapse over old workings, 
is the ability provided to compare the extent of movement occurring 
in the surface drift cover with that below rockhead. 
In analysing deformation data there are two possible means 
of presentation - either as change from equivalent values on some 
initial reference day or as change between monitoring occasions. 
The former means of presentation provides the overall change to 
date, but tends to risk obscuring recent change and if the 
original reference day value is erroneous then this error affects 
all subsequently derived values of change. At the outset there 
was no specific idea of the extent of deformation that might 
ensue. Burland et al (1977) reported ground movement occurring 
within 60 m of the crest of a 29 m highwall in Oxford Clay. The 
release of in situ stress caused horizontal movement in to the 
excavation of up to 200 mm and settlement of up to 100 mm with 
pit base heave of up to 100 mm. The dominance of horizontal 
movement was at~ributed to the larger horizontal stress change 
occurring in the over-consolidated Oxford Clay. Progressive 
shear failure was identifie~ as occurring on horizontal bedding 
- 390 -
planas just above the brick pit base defining a rigid block 
movement. This environment was not directly comparable with 
the Low Close panel on the basis of geology and geometry. Cut-
base deformation was not considered in this study. Derivation 
of the highwall crest area deformation was the main study 
objective and the intense movement of mine plant during successive 
coaling operations in the cut base precluded the practical 
monitoring of movement in that area. Crofts et al (1977) 
summarised the horizontal movement monitored in 32 documented 
civil engineering trenches, from 6 to 28 m deep. The percentage 
ratio of horizontal movement to depth recorded in these instances 
varied from 0.05 to 0.75. Unfortunately, all such trenches 
contained various support systems and were cut vertically in 
a range of soils. Much research has been conducted into the 
phenomenon of natural valley rebound in sedimentary rocks. 
Matheson and Thomson (1973) describe this as a ubiquitous 
feature in North American areas where major river valleys are 
deeply incised into flat lying sedimentary rocks characterized 
by a low modulus of elasticity. They report that such rebound 
can by up to 10% of valley depth although a common range is 
3 to 5%, bearing in mind that this is a time-dependent phenomenon. 
They refer to immediate excavation rebounds associated with dam 
construction work which have been observed in the order of 1% of 
excavation depth. The Oxford Clay brick pit study did not have 
to contend with the movement of plant on the highwall crest 
since excavation was achieved with a planar, based at the toe 
of the wall. All attempts were made to ensure that the dragline 
was confined to the front 20 m wide panel zone, in making its 
- 391 -
northerly excavation run, thus remaining a minimum of 10 m from 
the nearest line of instrumentation. Undue transgression by 
plant was identifiable by means of close observation of plant 
tracks in the panel boulder clay which could then be assessed 
by examination of any anomalous behaviour of the nearby 
instrumentation at the t~e of transgression. Examination of 
the monitored data in the following sections will confirm that 
such transgression occurred but can be reasonably isolated from 
other factors affecting deformation. This project regarded the 
panel area, therefore, as a study area of ground deformation 
arising from mine plant loading, excavation rebound, collapse 
over old workings and climatic changes. The analysis will 
attempt to differentiate between the influence from these 
factors. 
5.4.2: Day 45-75 (Figure 5.13) 
During this period there was no mining activity within 200 m 
of the panel area. The period was moderately wet and very cold 
with he.avy overnight frosts, see Figure 5.7. 84 mm total 
precipitation was recorded on site over this period - an average 
of 2.8 mm per day. It is presented to afford background levels 
preceding the first monitored strike cut. The highwall face had 
been standing for one month at the beginning of this period. 
Within one week of its formation, the highwall cut developed an 
unstable zone defined by tension cracking just east of the eventual 
E6 location which was well developed by day 45, see Plate 5.1 and 
Figure 5.13. The failure zone extended 100 m south of the panel 
. and appeared to align with collapse over old, coincident drives

into the old mine void .

Movement of tiltmeter TIl indicated a southward widening 
of the unstable zone which was backed to the west by an 
approximately 10 m wide zone of tensile strain. Face failure 
appeared to comprise initial plane failu-e with subsequent 
later toppling at a more advanced stage. The failure mass 
movement direction was clearly defined to be south-eastwards 
away from the constraint of the cut endwal1 and possibly 
aided by the apparent dip of the Coal Measures parallel to 
the slope cres t. 
At this point in time the strike cut endwall lay opposite 
the northern panel boundary and the constraint to movement 
thus provided serves to explain the narrowing of the unstable 
zone northwards. Beyond 15 m from the slope crest there is 
no indication of significant horizontal or vertical movements. 
Some indication is given by the levelling and tilt data 
outside this zone of face failure that minor movement (less 
than 1 mm and 1 mm/m tespectively) occurred with no apparent 
relation to proximity to tHe cut face. This upward 
displacement over 50 m from the face was likely due to frost 
heave. Over this period several severe ground frosts occurred 
which loosened some grouted rebar survey stations. The 
tiltmeter ,and extensometer standpipes, more deeply and 
effectively installed in the ground, remained secure 
through this period. 
- 395 -
The extensometer data indicated no deformation above the old 
workings more than 15 m from the face. They indicated that 
deformation was confined to upward dilation of the boulder clay. 
Extensometer E3 gave what was to remain the strongest indication 
of collapse immediately above the old workings, which by day 100 
was to stabilise. The three lower reference points in El appeared 
to be settling upwards over this period, after which they remained 
stable and secure for the remainder of the project. Good agreement 
between extensometer and survey-derived vertical ground displacement 
was achieved over the period. Extensometer E6 demonstrated acute 
settlement principally in the boulder clay from the migration west-
ward of the adjacent face failure. Extensometer E5, however, 10 m 
west of the face failure indicated ground dilation in the upper 
half of the borehole and no movement directly above the workings. 
This would appear to be related to a form of ground relaxation 
west of the face instability backs car zone. 
5.4.3: Day 75-86 (Figure 5.14) 
During this period the first strike cut was taken northwards 
from a point over 200 m south of the panel centre line to within 
25 m of this line. Dry and very cold conditions persisted through 
this period and severe ground frosts continued.

Unfortunately no survey data is available for E5, E6 and TIl 
over this period. Consistent movement eastward towards the cut 
was demonstrated in the northern section of the panel with no 
significant vertical displacement. This contrasted with 
insignificant plan movement in the southern section of the panel 
where both drag line loading in the boulder clay and stress relief 
due to excavation unloading were expected to provide evidence of 
deformation. The possibility exists that eastward plan ground 
movement induced by rebound was counteracted temporarily in the 
vicinity of the drag line by north and westward deformation induced 
by drag1ine movements. The latter may also have resulted in the 
ground uplift, up to 2 mm, within 25 m of the dragline-occupied 
zone. Alternatively the pred'ominant uplift may represent an 
initial post-excavation relaxation zone. Figures 5.10, 5.11 
and 5.12 demonstrate that the panel area within 35 m of the cut 
endwa11 experienced uplift over this period intensifying south 
and eastward, towards the endwall. The uplift markedly arrested 
the previously established settlement of T6 and TS associated with 
the face failure mechanism and is attributed to the influence of 
the drag line loading in the front of the panel during its excavation 
run. Frost heave uplift would be unlikely to account for this 
trend of deformation. The predominant eastward plan movement in 
the northern panel section would have been expected to be accompanied 
by settlement as in the pr~ceding period in association with the 
face failure migration westward. 
- 398 -
Ground tilt over the period predominantly occurred downwards 
to the north-west, although the ground tilt response to excavation 
was generally low, see Figures 5.8 and 5.9. As will later be 
demonstrated, the ground tilt response to this initial first cut 
excavation occurred steadily over a longer term period. 
Subsurface deformation as exhibited by the extensometers also 
demonstrated an uplift over this period. They indicate that this 
upward dilation occurred predominantly in the boulder clay with a 
very small response in the underlying Coal Measures (under 0.5 mm). 
No significant collapse over workings was induced by the excavation 
beyond the slope face area. 
5.4.4: Day 86-151 (Figure 5.15) 
The first eleven days of this period saw the first strike cut 
extended to 30 m north of the panel centre line. No further mining 
activity occurred in the panel vicinity during this period. Rainfall 
was light, with a total of 123.7 mm b~ing recorded on site - an 
average of 1.9 mm per day. Low temperatures persisted with more 
regularity though less intense ground frosts, see Figure 5.7. 
This period represented one of the coldest U.K. winters on record. 
The lack of mining .activity after day 97 enabled the study of the 
longer term response of the tround to the first strike cut. 
Ground defermation in plan is predominantly perpendicular to 
and towards the fresh excavation within 35 m of its face. A zone 
of tensile strain developed 15 m baCk from the s~ope crest. Within 
a week of the completion of the cut this zone manifested itself in

the formation of tension cracks defining an area of instability 
encompassing E4 to T10. Deformation in plan was consistently in 
the form of settlement, see Figures 5.11 to 5.13. The magnitude 
of this settlement increased to the north and east. The nature 
of the combined eastward movement and settlement corresponds to 
rebound characteristics such as reported by Burland et al (1977). 
The horizontal displacement increased in the southern.panel 
area indicative of the constraint afforded by the cut endwall to 
the north. This did not apply to the panel area outside the face 
failure with regard, however, to settlement. The settlement activity 
appeared not only related to the proximity to the face, but also 
the thickness of the underlying boulder clay, see Figure 5.3. 
By the end of the period the settlement, excepting that 
associated with the face failure, appeared to have terminated. 
The extensometer data supported the levelling results, and showed 
no indications of collapse over old workings, with all significant 
movement confined to the boulder clay. 
The deformation recorded in this period appears to have 
resulted from the development of the face instability which may 
have been promoted by an initial rebound. No abrupt variations 
in ground tilt or elevation indicated that the face failure 
mechanism occurred smoothly. It developed within one week of 
cut completion to accelerate after day 110, see Section 5.4.5. 
- 401 -
5.4.5: Day 151-248 (Figure S.16} 
This period saw the passing of spring and the onset of summer 
1979. It was a warm period with light rainfall, 187 mm in total 
was recorded on site - an average of 1. 9 DID per day. No minin'g 
excavation occurred in the vicinity of the panel during this 
period. The reinstatement of subsidiary levelling stations, 
rendered insecure by winter frosts provide additional data for 
this period. 
No significant ground deformation in plan occurred in this 
time in the panel farther than 35 m from the slope crest. Within 
this distance from the crest the displacements were less consistently 
perpendicular to and into the excavation. The face failure 
developed significantly, migrating westward into the centre of 
the panel. It appeared to exert a major influence on ground 
defonnation. The failure was flanked to the west by a tensile 
zone with a vertical baCks car developing south-westwards through 
E4. Plate 5.4 shows the failure and panel area on day 215. This 
developing zone of instability was manifested in a settlement 
zone approximately 10 m wide extending centrally down the panel, 
generally westward, 10 m from the slope crest. It was flanked 
to the north, west and south by an apparent rim of uplift. The 
face failure appeared to be promoted by collapse over old 
coincident mining drives running in a direction 200 south of the 
panel centre line in the Cannel and Metal seams. The backscar on 
the face appeared to represent a vertical overbreak related to 
collapse over such drives and possibly was influenced by the 
dominant vertical joint set at 030
 Collapse appeared to occur

in a directiqn represented by the plan movement of E3 and E4 
contrasting with that of T4 and TlO. Both of the latter stations 
appeared to be in ground whose instability was triggered from the 
more central panel collapse. Outside of these collapse and 
attendant uplift zones no appreciable ground deformation was 
monitored. Plate 5.4 also shows the lipping evident on the north 
face at the base of the boulder clay, measured on day 215 at 8 em. 
T4, above this area, developed pronounced toppling north-eastwards 
but much less significant displacement into the cut. 
The extensometer data indicated no collapse of Coal Measures 
strata over their associated mining drives. The central subsidence 
zone appeared to be, therefore, a developing trough within the 
boulder clay promoted by failure over the particular mining drive 
within only 10 m of the slope face. 
5.4.6: Day 248-446 (Figure 5.17) 
During this period no mining excavation occurred in the 
vicinity of the panel due in part to a five week labour strike. 
It saw the end of a dry summer and a mild but extremely wet 
winter up to mid-January 1980, see Figure 5.7. 821 mm of total 
precipitation was recorded on site for the period - an average 
of 4.1 mm/day. The opportunity was thus provided to study the 
long term effects of the excavation of the first cut and the 
general deformation of the panel area over a total 349 day period, 
since the dragline left the area on day 97. It represented a 
prolonged period of mining inactivity which was to precede the 
excavation of the second strike cut.

Figure 5.17: Panel surface deformation over the period - day 248 to 446, Low Close O.C.C.S. 
- 405 - . 
The plan displacement over this period was consistently 
perpendicular to and into the excavation. The face failure 
exerted a growing influence westward on ground deformation, 
although tension cracking extended farther in this direction 
only a limited amount. The pattern of shallow failures seated 
on shear planes, dipping at 40-500 in the Coal Measures, similar 
to those encountered in the previous cut face, see Section 5.2.5, 
continued to develop in the southern panel area. Their nature 
contrasted with the deeper penetration of the central panel 
failure zone. It is concluded that these two characteristic 
failures are related to collapse over the two mining drive 
directions. The central panel settlement trough was again 
accompanied by a surrounding zone of uplift and t.ensile strain 
around 10 m wide and penetrated westward 15 m from the slope 
crest. The central face failure appeared to have stabilised 
in its westward migration with continue.d deformation being 
mainly confined to a southward migration and disaggregation 
of the failure block itself. Face lipping on the northern 
panel face at the boulder clay base developed further to 15 em 
with novisib1e signs of distress in the underlying Coal Measures. 
A block appeared. to be moving south of eastward into the central 
failure zone at the face with a backward rotation to the north. 
Its basal shear plane appeared to daylight at the boulder clay 
base, but no tension cracking appeared on the northern slope 
crest area. This volume of ground was cut through and examined 
in detail in the next strike cut, see Section 5.4.9 and Plates 
5.8 and 5.9. The block appeared to be moving on two horizontal 
shear planes in the boulder clay at,and 20 em above,the Coal 
Measures unconformity. Similar but gross displacement at rockhead 
is reported in instability case 219 at the Esh Winning mine, see 
Chapter 2. 
- 406 -
Ground tilt outside of the zone of face failure varied little 
over this period, see Figures 5.8 and 5.9. Examination of the 
levelling data, see Figures 5.10 to 5.12, indicates however that 
settlement over the whole panel area outside the face failure 
zone occurred during this period. In the previous period this 
was also noted to have occurred, but to have stabilised by the 
end of that period. Around day 210, however, it appears to have 
been reactivated and then continued into this period up to day 
280. This was then followed up to the end of this period, day 
446, by general uplift. Examination of the rainfall data over 
this 70 day span, see Figure 5.7, indicates that this period was 
very dry, as well as hot, and this general settlement would appear 
to be related to consolidation of the boulder clay due to the 
drawdown of its phreatic surface. The onset of ground surface 
uplift from day 280 also coincided with intensifying rainfall 
through the late summer into an extremely wet winter. It would 
thus appear to have been generated by the ground dilation resulting 
from a rising ground water level in the boulder clay. By this 
period, however, no piezometric data was available to confirm 
this strong correlation. The intensity of settlement and uplift 
appeared to be related to the thickness of the underlying boulder 
clay, intensifying north and westward, see Figure 5.3. 
Forward reduction of overburden in coal area DI, approximately 
300 m south of the project panel, at times required the use of 
trucks for spoil movement. This was accomplished by routing dump 
trucks northward up to and around the panel on a peripheral spoil 
road. Such trucking occurred over the following day number periods, 
97-104, 227-230 and 269-320. This plant movement, approaching within 
- 407 -
3 m of the panel fence in the western area was not intended in the 
original plans for the project. Some concern existed at the time 
as to the impact on ground deformation of this additional unintentional 
factor during a period of no other mining activity following the 
first strike cut. Up to fifteen trucks per hour passed the panel 
at the height of such stripping activity. These were Terex R70, 
70 ton capacity, trucks with occasional dozer and scraper traffic. 
Close inspection of the automatic tiltmeter (TI7) recorded ground 
tilt data showed no identifiable variation that could be linked 
to truck movement around the panel on the haul road, 26 m away at 
its closest point. On days 292 and 293 dial gauges were clamped 
to the four extensometer measuring heads to identify any strain 
wire weight movement related to the passage of these trucks. The 
gaugescould be estimated in reading to 0.0025 mm, see Plate 5.5. 
No variation in weight position was registered over the two day 
period, at a tUne when trucking was at its heaviest. During 
this same period a survey was undertaken of ground vibration in 
the panel area.bordering the haul road with a Cambridge Instruments 
Universal Vibrograph. This is a stylus-on-celluloid recorder 
which was run with a film speed of 4 mm per second. No vibration 
could be identified from passing trucks with this instrument, up to 
within 5 m of the vehicle tracks. During the periods of trucking 
the levelling and tiltmeter stations, flanking and closest to the 
haul road, showed vertical displacements which never exceeded 1 mm 
and appeared rather to be related to other factors affecting the 
remainder of the panel stations. This auxiliary study suggested, 
th~refore, that any significant ground deformation derived from 
trucking, if existent, must have been confined to within 5 m of 
the haul road.

5.4.7: Day 446-458 (Figure 5.181 
During this period the Lima 2400 dragline advanced the second 
strike cut from 120 m south to 1 m north of the panel centre line. 
In the last eleven days of the preceding period the RBllO dragline 
also removed a large part of the northern ground constraint in 
the neighbouring northern coaling area DIV, see Figure 5.6. So 
for the first tUne in the study the strike cut slope extended 
virtually as one continuous free face from north to south and 
presented the opportunity to assess the effect of endwall constraint. 
The weather was cold and moderately wet over this period. 30 mm 
total precipitation was recorded on site - an average of 2.5 mm 
per day. It thus presents the data regarding the immediate 
defonnation resulting from cut excavation. 
Inspection of Figures 5.10 to 5.1Z indicates a marked 
similarity in ground uplift, followed by settlement recovery, 
in this period compared with the period day 75-86 when the first 
strike cut began to be worked through the panel. This short term 
uplift is more marked in period 446-458 undoubtedly because the 
endwall at the end of the period was farther north into the panel 
and the northern constraint to the endwall had been eliminated. 
The stations in the vicinity of the crest now were also sited in 
thicker underlying boulder clay, see Figure 5.3, so the precise 
contributions of this combination of factors is difficult to 
resolve. This uplift zone appeared to be confined to within 20 m 
of the slope crest. Outside this zone the stations also exhibited 
the same trend of uplift followed by settlement, but the magnitude 
for all of these was less than 1 mm. The degree of uplift again

appeared to be related to the thickness of underlying boulder clay, 
reducing to the south. 
The overall pattern of plan displacement shown is less clear 
and must be treated with caution. The apparently anomalous plan 
displacements of El, E2 and Tl is attributed to movement of the 
drag line in their vicinity. The ground tilt and extensometer data 
indicates that aUnost all the deformation o~curred by the afternoon 
of day 451 when the endwall was 10 m south of the panel centre line. 
The abruptness of the change in magnitude in this data was the most 
significant registered in the project up to that point in time. 
Unfortunately, no survey data is available for day 451. Between 
3.00 p.m. on day 450 and 9.30 a.m. on day 451 the dragline was 
20 m to 10 m south of the panel centre line. By the end of this 
period when the dragline was in the central panel area the 
significan~ uplift and ground tilt had ceased. The first survey 
after the approach of the dragline into the panel was taken on day 
452. This showed good agreement with the uplift values indicated 
by the extensometers. Thus there was no indication of vertical 
displacement from day 451 to 452. Unfortunately on the night-
shift of day 451 the dragline crawled westward between E2 and 
T2 to a position level with El. Its tracks were immediately 
observed on the morning of day 452 within 2 m of El and were 
still obvious on day 516, see Plate 5.6. The s~rvey data for 
day 452 shows the marked effect on plan displacement of El, E2 and 
T2 which the dragline exerted. The combined monitoring data, 
however, indicates that little vertical movement was promoted by 
this unintended manoeuvre. Only survey data for 451, however, 
could have resolved the precise dragline effects with absolute 
- 412 -
certainty, but if the plan displacements for El, E2 and T2 are 
discounted then any rebound resulting purely from the excavation 
of the cut and not the dragline loading is indicated to have 
resulted again in plan displacement away from the excavation in 
the short term. The commencement of a southern zone of movement 
into the excavation with attendant settlement was indicated by 
T7. This was later to be manifested by face failure and crest 
tension cracking migrating northwards to th~ panel as discussed 
in the next section. Unfortunately station T8 was removed 
accidentally at this time in advance of the dragline passage. 
It was later reinstalled, but provides no data for this or the 
subsequent period. Extended discussion of plan displacement in 
particular is not justified over this period due to the undisciplined 
movement of the drag line. 
"The extensometer data indicate a subsurface deformation of 
post-excavation uplift followed by settlement, in parallel to the 
surface deformation. The magnitude of such vertical movements was, 
however, comparatively minor with a maximum amplitude of 1.5 mm, 
decreasing with the reference point depth. The movement was 
thus again confined predominantly to the boulder clay and no 
collapse or floor heave of the old workings was indicated. On 
day 452 careful excavation by the drag line enabled reference 
points 2 and 3 to be recovered from borehole E3, see Plate 5.2. 
These were found to be securely anchored to the borehole mudstone 
walls and confirmed the confidence placed in their installation. 
An interesting" feature was that the grout columns displayed in 
plan an ellipsoidal outline indicating plastic deformation of the 
borehole since reference point emplacement.

5.4.8: 458-471 (Figure 5.19) 
This period saw no mining activity in the panel area and 
represents an opportunity to study the intermediate term 
deformation associated with rebound from the second strike cut. 
46 mm total precipitation was recorded on site for this period 
- an average of 3.5 mm per day. No significant surface or 
subsurface ground deformation was observed vertically or in plan. 
over this period, confirming that the immediate ground response 
had virtually terminated. All vertical displacements were less 
than 1 Mm. Plan displacements, though insignificant, were however 
indicated to be consistent in their directions, i.e. away from 
the excavation, as in the immediate post-excavation period. This 
is attributed to remanent movement induced previously by dragline 
movement. 
5.4.9: Day 471-514 (Figure 5.20) 
This period saw continued mining inactivity in the panel area. 
It represents the passage of February and March 1980 with mild and 
moderately wet weather. 116 mm total precipitation was recorded 
on site for the period - an average of 2.7 mm per day. Over this 
period very little ground tilt occurred, see Figures 5.8 and 5.9. 
The panel surface area continued to rise, but only significantly 
in the northern part closest to the recent excavation. Plan 
displacement, in marked contrast to the preceding period, now 
adopted a direction into the excavation, with magnitudes tending 
to increase away from the new cut, increasing with depth of 
underlying boulder clay. Tension cracks relating to face failure

Failure resembled the form observed migrating northward on the

5.4.10: Day 514-558 (Figure 5.21)

cut, see Plate 5.6, to an endwall position 30 m north of the panel 
centre line after having left an initial section of the third cut, 
completed temporarily 104 m south of the centre line on day 514. 
At the end of this period the RElla also completed the first strike 
cut up into coaling area DIV maintaining a more continuous free cut 
face. This was the spring period of 1980, being exceptionally warm 
and dry. 22 mm total precipitation was recorded on site for the 
period - an average of 0.5 mID per day.

The extensometer and ground tilt data show the ground response 
best, due to their greater availability in comparison to survey 
data. The extensometers, see Figure 5.7, indicated a much le  
pronounced but immediate uplift in response to the continuation of 
the second cut excavation, which rapidly changed to a continued 
trend of accelerating settlement. Similarly the ground tilt 
response is less marked for the cut continuation period. By the 
end of the period, Figure 5.22, the panel has luffered almo.t 
exclusively from settlement. This intensified with proximity to 
the cut. The development of a tensile strain zone about is m back 
from and parallel to the slope crest bore resemblance to the I~ound 
deformation which developed prior to and after the first .trike cut 
without the influence of northern endwall conltraint. Thil would 
appear to have been related to developing face inltability and 
consolidation within the boulder clay due to drawdown durinl the 
dry spring. During the period no major fresh ten. ion cracka 
appeared within the panel although the southern face failure aone 
developed further as seen in Plate 5.7. On day 559 a survey wal 
made of a set of minor tension cracks in the panel .urface area, 
see Figure 5.21. These ranged in width from 5 mm to 20 mm, up to 
150 mm deep, in two distinct sets trending N.E. and N.W.N. with 
marked linear continuity. They appeared during the extremely dry 
April and May of 1980 and are attributed to dessication of the 
upper boulder clay. Their alignment, however, gives an indication 
of the relative orientation of the underlying Metal werkin.s and 
may have been related to preferential dewatering of the drift in 
zenes overlying the old mining drives with higher permeability due 
to void migration. They disappeared with the advent of rain at 
- 419 -
the end of May. Once aga~n the deformation was indicated to 
be occurring only within the boulder clay.

Plate 5.7: Face instability south of panel, day 516, Low Close O.C.C.S. 
On day 516 during the initial advance of the cut away from the 
panel centre line observations were made of the geology of the 
freshly exposed northern panel face, where pronounced lipping at 
the boulder clay base had been earlier observed, see Plate 5.4 and 
Section 5.4.4. Plates 5.8 and 5.9 provide cross-sectional views 
through this ground north of the panel centre-line a~ the junction 
between the boulder clay and Coal ~leasures. The lippLng was observed 
to be due to shear failure along two horizontal planes, spaced at

20 em vertically, in the drift. The most significant displacement 
appeared to have occurred on the lower plane directly at the junction 
between drift and rockhe,ad, 5 m below the slope crest. Both planes 
were smooth, dry, polished and gently undulating. The immediate 
underlying mudstone was fragmented and softened~ but it was difficult 
to determine the extent to which its dilation had been detennined 
by Quaternary weathering, shear movement of the overlying drift 
block, void migration from underlying old workings or the dragging 
activity of the Lima 2400. 
5.4.11: Day 558-585 (Figure 5.22) 
From day 577 the RBI10 extended the second strike cut north-
ward into coaling area DIV. This was followed by the excavation 
of the third strike cut by the Lima 2400 commencing on day 581, 
104 m south of the panel centre line, and continuing to day 585 
when it departed to the low wall of the cut with the endwall 10 m 
south of the panel centre line. During this period the weather 
continued warm and dry. 31 mm total precipitation was recorded 
on site for the period - an average of 1.2 mm per day. The latter 
four days of the period thus enable the immediate post-excavation 
deformation to be studied. 
Examination of the extensometer data for the period indicates 
a continuation of the settlement, confined to the boulder clay, 
related to the dry weather followed by an uplift resulting from 
the approaching plant in advance of the third cut. Survey data 
was only available for the first and last days of the period and 
does not show the late onset of uplift. This became perceptible

on day 584 using the extensometer data, when the dragline was 20 m 
south of the panel centre line, and on day 582 using the tiltmeter 
data when the dragline was 50 m south of the centre line. The full 
extent of uplift was to occur over the beginning of the next period. 
Plan displacement for the period comprises consistent excavation-
bound movement with a tensile strain zone around 15 m back from the 
slope crest. No indications of face instability were evident over 
the period, but instability was evident 25 m south of the panel centre 
line. Dragline movement is not considered to have influenced this 
pattern of deformation. It did not approach within 10 m of any 
monitoring station until ~oving north away from the endwall on day 
585 after the last readings for that day were taken. 
5.4.12: Day 585-626 (Figure 5.23) 
During the first eight days of this period the Lima 2400 
removed the partings in the Main coal from the low wall opposite 
the panel. From day 601 to 608 the RBllO then extended the third 
cut to 50 m north of the panel centre line. The period represents 
a warm and wet June in 1980. 120 mm total precipitation was 
recorded on site for this period - an average of 2.9 mm per day. 
Only one extensometer, El, remained intact after day 585 and it 
and Tl show a marked uplift (8-12 mm). This corresponds with the 
severest change in ground tilt recorded in the project for Tl, T13, 
T14 and T7. The severe tilt and extensometer changes all occurred 
between day 585 and 592. After day 585, up to day 601, no dragline 
was in the panel and in fact observations and enquiry showed that 
the dragline had wandered very close to the affe~ted stations on

its journey north out of the panel at the end of day 585. Up to 
day 585 the automatic tiltmeter Tl7 had remained stable with a slight 
tilt, less than 1 mm/m down to the north, which developed with the 
wet winter at the end of 1979. This changed abruptly at the end of 
day 585 by .S mm/m southwards. This could also only have been

1 m of El and T7, 1.5 m of Tl and 4 m of T1S. Dozer tracks were 
observed to be within 2 m of T13 and 3 m of T16. Thi. must account 
for the gross movement upward and away from the cut recorded for 
these points over the period. Plate S.lO shows a general view of 
the panel face on day 635 after having stood for one month. It

few had migrated to above the overlying Crow seam roof. Little sign 
of distress, including lipping, was evident on the cre.t and face 
which appeared to stand stable at an inclination of 70P and height 
of 15 m. This appeared to be related to the larger pillar dimensions 
in the old mine workings underlying this length of face. Extensameter 
EI continued to be read up to day 671 and to indicate no development 
of collapse over old workings, with settlement confined to the boulder 
clay. The remaining ground tilt stations were monitored up to day 
650, exhibiting some recovery in response to the dragline movement 
at the start of the period. Tl, T17 and T7 all developed tilt down 
towards the excavation defining a 15 m wide zone of influence back

from the crest by day 650. Tilt was more pronounced in the northern 
panel area, probably again related to the rapidly thickening boulder 
clay north from the panel. 
The accidental invasion of the inatrumented zone by the dragline 
at the outset of this period makes specific judlemant. of excavation 
rebound unwarranted. An indication i. liven. however, by the data 
of the ground deformation that can be generated when the zone of 
dragline movement on such a cre.t is extended to a 15 to 20 m wide

summary of the trend of surface deformation arisinl frOD the three 
cuts through the panel. The deformation data hal been interpreted 
cautiously bearinl in mind that it entail. derivinl areal deformation

are considered in preference to specific detailed analy.is. Significant 
deformation is regarded al comprising vertical and horizontal 
displacements equal to or in excess of I mm and 5 mm re.pectively. 
The pattern of deformation is now dilcu  ed aa related to thoae 
factors which from inspection of the data appeared to exert an 
influence on deformation characteristics.

5.5.1: Excavation Rebound 
This is intended to represent the ground deformation arising 
from the stress relief afforded by the removal of successive strike 
cut excavations. Isolation of the characteristics of rebound is 
hindered in the interpretation of the data by the influence of the 
additional factors of face instability, weather and plant movement. 
A one month-old slope was inherited at the beginning of the 
project which displayed a deformation pattern influenced by face 
instability until the first cut was excavate.d. Soon after exposure 
of the second face by this cut another significant zone of instability 
developed which also appeared to dominate the deformation pattern. 
During the one year period then preceding the second cut, continued 
development of the face instability and dry weather appeared to 
account for the maintenance of a similar deformation pattern. No 
significant deformation followed the second cut until after the 
lapse of two months when exceptionally dry weather is attributed 
to the onset of deformation together with development of face 
instability just south of the panel. The third cut post-excavation 
period represents the final forty days of the project when 
instrumentation only within 20 m of the slope crest remained intact. 
The data for this period is dominated by the influence of plant 
movement within the panel. 
The evidence indicates that conventional excavation rebound 
was not significant and that deformation resulted from other factors 
which will subsequently be discussed. 
- 428 -
5.5.2: Face Instability 
This occurred on the first two and near the third of the 
four exposed faces during the life of the project. These stood 
at 12 to 15 m, cut at 6S to 700  Face instability exerted a 
dominant influence on ground deformation in all cases. Two forms 
of instability were characterised, each resulting from collapse 
over old mine workings i~duced by the strike cut mining. The 
first form of instability resulted from collapse over ~ld drives 
aligned sub-parallel to the panel slope face. This resulted in a 
zone of catastrophic failure progressing laterally up to 5 m back 
from the slope crest. This was backed by a ,further 5 m wide zone 
of settlement and excavation-bound displacement, in turn backed by 
a 10 m wide zone of tensile strain and uplift. The constraining 
effect of the northern endwall of a cut when present was apparent 
in the reduction of the width and intensity of these zones in its 
vicinity. 
The second form of instability was associated with collapse 
along one overbreak feature aligned along an old mine drive 
o orientated at 70 to the slope crest. This resulted in catastrophic 
failure which penetrated 12 m back into the slope in the form of 
a wedge collapsing and toppling towards the cut. North of this 
wedge a further block was observed to move into the excavation on 
a sub-horizontal shear plane at the base of the boulder clay in 
response to forward movement of the wedge. Settlement within the 
boulder clay occurred behind these instability zones to a distance 
of 20 m back from the slope face. After 200 days of exposure the 
instability had developed a rearward 10 m wide zone of tensile 
strain and uplift. 
- 429 -
Extensometer data indicated that these cases of instability were 
induced by major collapse over old mine workings which occurred only 
after excavation had placed their location within 5 m of the fresh 
face. The most significant movement downward and into the cut was 
associated with face instability and farther than 12 m back from the 
slope crest, even after the passage of one year, this was seen to be 
confined only to the boulder clay cover. Face instability did not 
promote the collapse of old workings within the body of the panel, 
although on fresh exposure at each slope face many appeared to have 
old partial collapse features. 
Face instability occurred on the fourth strike cut face through 
the panel after the termination of the project and is described in 
Chapter 2. One motive for this project was to provide background 
data on the influence of old workings on slope crest deformation for 
the Edmondsley Mine in N.E. England.At the outset of the project 
this mine was at the planning stage, with the problem of a high 
pressure natural gas pipeline in the vicinity of its working area. 
In October 1980 the first coaling area, in a very similar setting 
to the Low Close study area, experienced face instability associated 
with old workings. This is also described in more detail in Chapter 
2 and bears many features in common with the observed Low Close face 
instabilities, see case number 230.

5.5.3: Weatner 
A period of one year elapsed between the first and second 
cuts with no mining activity in the panel. This period initially 
experienced a dry summer with an overall daily rainfall averaging 
less than 2 Mm. Settlement arising from face failure after having 
stabilised appeared to have been reactivated over the complete 
panel by this prolonged dry weather. There then followed a wet 
winter period with an overall daily rainfall averaging over 4 Mm. 
This is seen in the levelling data to have resulted in uplift over 
the panel area. The magnitude of both settlement and uplift was 
directly related to the proximity to;the slope crest and also the 
boulder clay thickness. Settlement was also pronounced through 
the panel during the 70 day period preceding the third cut. This 
coincided with low daily rainfall averaging less than 1 mm over the 
period and the appearance of two orthogonal dessication crack sets. 
Frost heave experienced in the initial wiriter period of the 
project caused the temporary loss of some survey levelling stations. 
This was a reflection of the inadequate design of these stations. 
No conclusive indication of frost neave effects can be isolated from 
the levelling data on the other stations which were anchored 
effectively at 1.5 m depth. A zone of uplift during the period of 
heavy frasts developed in the centre of the panel, but this backed 
the zone of face instability to which it may also have been related 
and generally was less than 1 mm with ground tilt variation of under 
1 mm/m. 
- 431 -
5.5.4: Plant Movement 
During the second and third strike cut excavations the drag line 
and dozer at times manoeuvred into the panel instrumented area and 
did not confine themselves, as requested, to the immediate 15 m wide 
zone at the slope crest. The pattern of tracks in the prepared 
drift panel surface clearly defined the extent of this wandering. 
When encroachment by plant was within 5 m of a point this resulted 
in significant uplift with plan displacement and tilt away from the 
plant in question (typically 8 mm, 10 mm and 2mm/m respectively). 
The extensometer data indicated that a temporary period of uplift 
followed by recovery through settlement accompanied and followed 
the presence of the drag1ine in the panel, whilst excavating each 
cut. The amplitude of this response was perceptible but less than 
1 mm as much as 40 m from the slope crest. Within 1 to 4 m from 
the moving dragline and dozer significant uplift and plan displacements 
(up to 12 mm and 59 mm respectively) were monitored in the panel 
drift cover. 
During the interval between the first and second strike cuts 
it was demonstrated that the movement of 70 tonne dump trucks behind 
the project panel did not promote any ground deformation farther 
than 5 m from the peripheral haul road. 
- 432 -
5.5.5: Boulder Clay Cover 
The magnitude of both settlement and uplift experienced on 
the panel surface appeared to be directly related to the thickness 
of underlying boulder clay. Plate 5.10 and Figure 5.3 show the 
marked thickening in drift north westward from the panel. Comparison 
of the levelling data for the northern and southern lines of stations, 
Figures 5.12 and 5.10 respectively, show that the same deformation 
trends exist, but the amplitude of vertical deformation increases 
by a factor of from two to three northwards. This corresponds with 
a drift thickness increasi~g from a value in the south of between 
3 and 4 m to a value of between 6 and 7 m in the north. Plate 5.10 
also shows the 1 m thick sand lens aquifer developing and dipping 
northwards to the north of the panel which would have enhanced the 
drainage potential of the drift in the northern area. 
5.5.6: Old Underground Mine Workings 
No surface ground deformation zones were ide~tified as being 
related to any underlying old workings. Such deformation was 
generated indirectly byold workings where their collapse occurred 
at the slope crest resulting in face instability. The pattern of. 
dessication cracks in the drift developing during prolonged dry 
weather bore resemblance to the position of underlying old workings 
and may have been an indication of the role of the workings as 
drainage adits to the overlying overburden. 
- 433 -
5.6: Discussion - Subsurface Ground Deformation 
The borehole extensometers provided data only on vertical 
displacement. This data has been presented in Figure 5.7 on the 
basic assumption that each lowest reference point had remained 
stationary throughout the project. The trend of displacement for 
all reference points and the good agreement between extensometer 
and survey-derived surface level variation supports this assumption. 
Marked disagreement occurred only once, in El at the end of its life 
when within close proximity to the slope crest. This is thought to 
have resulted from a survey error since there are a number of 
extensometer readings encompassing this one occasion which show 
good agreement and a sensible trend. 
The extensometer data indicate that virtually all of the 
vertical ground movement in the panel occurred within the boulder 
clay cover. E2 held one of its reference points only 0.5 m below 
the boulder clay junction whiCh began to show a deformation pattern 
similar to the overlying boulder clay 9nce the slope crest was 30 m 
away. E3 was the only extensometer to indicate any closure over old 
workings. It shows the progressive collapse with dilation up to 5 m 
above its old working in overlying mudstone with a maximum subsidence 
of 3 mm fo~ the point located 2 m above the roof. This collapse 
occurred gradually before the first cut which then appeared to 
trigger upward void migration. This subsequently stabilised over 
a 200 day period before removal of the instrument on the drag1ine 
approach for the second cut. 
- 434 -
The cause of the short term collapse of old workings at the 
slope faces (within two weeks of exposure) cannot be isolated. It 
may have resulted from dragline loading or its dragging operation, 
or else have been induced by a form of rebound not defined, due 
to the removal of instrumentation from the path of the advancing 
dragline. 
5.7: SUl1111ary 
No significant highwall rebound, due purely to the excavation 
of strike cuts as such, was defined during the project. 
A major influence on panel ground deformation was the development 
of highwall face instability induced by the collapse of old under-
ground workings. Instabi~ity appeared in two forms which were 
determined by the orientation and intensity of the old underground 
rooms underlying the slope crest. Gross deformation penetrated up 
to 12 m back from the slope crest dependent upon the form of 
instability. Significant deformation, comprising settlement, uplift 
and tensile strain zones, up to 40 m back from the slope crest, 
accompanied the development of face instability. Apart from within 
face failure zones all significant deformation appeared to be confined 
to the boulder clay cover. 
The eX~~~JtOmete.- data i~il:ateu--that- si-gnUi~-colla.p.l~9ver 
old underground workings only occurred within 10 m of the face 
associated with cases of face instability. Dragline ~ining activity 
appeared to exert no further influence on collapse. 
- 435 -
Settlement and uplift were monitored within the boulder clay 
corresponding to periods of very dry and very wet weather respectively. 
This was accompanied by plan displacement perpendicular to the slope 
crest, towards the excavation, and affected a zone across the panel 
width up to 40 m back from the crest. The magnitude of such deformation 
appeared to be directly related to both the proximity to the excavation 
and the thickness of underlying boulder clay. 
The monitoring data also gave indication of the gross surface 
deformation which mine plant operating in the slope crest zone was 
capab le of producing. Dragline movement unduly close to instrumentation, 
within 5 m, caused uplift and movement away from the machine to the 
extent of dominating any other possible influence on short term 
deformation in the vicinity. No monitoring could be undertaken in 
areas directly travelled over by the dragline during its passage 
through the panel, i.e. the 15 to 20 m wide zone at the slope crest. 
The instrumentation performed satisfactorily over the two years 
of the project. Survey procedures could be improved for future work 
of this nature by employing electronic distance measurement in order 
to improve the precision of plan displacement measurement and increase 
the frequency of data. Greater.control over the mining cycle would 
be advised in future studies in order to provide consistency in 
mining strategy and prevent truant wandering of plant into instrumented 
areas. The latter occurrence did, however, give an ins~ght into 
the effect of mining plant itself on ground deformation. 
In planning for future mining operations in the vicinity of 
critical utilities the project has provided an insight into the 
magnitude and areal extent of ground deformation arising from a 
- 436 -
number of factors. It must be stressed that this project provides 
useful data directly relevant to only one, albeit common, environment 
in surface mining. In this environment it indicates in particular 
the care needed in defining, in advance, the characteristics of 
underlying old workings to reduce highwall crest deformation. It 
leads to consideration of the possible strategies which might be 
adopted to prevent collapse in face areas in order to reduce crest 
deformation in critical localities  optimising highwall plan 
orientation with respect to old workings, reducing slope angles, 
excavating safety benches at rock head, controlled inducement of 
- .' ". - .. '> '.    ------ -- -' -. _ .. 
old working collapse on faces and filling old workings in face 
areas. Deformation to the rear of face instability zones being 
confined, as demonstrated, to superficials cover also indicates 
that benefits can be derived from concentrating on methods to 
minimize deformation in such cover in critical areas to the rear 
of mine slopes. 
This project was initiated with no prior availability of data 
on ground deformation in such an environment. It was iqtended to 
help enable a more quantitative approach to be adopted in the future 
planning of such mining operations in the vicinity of important 
utilities. Only by accumulating such experience from field studies 
can ground behaviour associated with mining be reliably predicted 
with allowance for the wide range of likely controlling factors.

CONCLUSION 
- 445 ,-
CONCLUSION 
It has been shown that the major control over rock slope 
deformation in British surface coal mines is exerted by materials 
strength, geological structure and groundwater. The weakest Coal 
Measures slope components provide the majority of surfaces for planar 
shear defoDnation. These may be considered to be clay-rich bands 
together with pre-existing shear planes or bedding planes in 
argillaceous strata. They are generally concordant with bedding 
and consequently strata orientation is critical to slope stability. 
Coal Measures rock joints, although occasionally exhibiting shear 
strengths approaching the weakness of the aforementioned, are of 
comparitively moderate persistence and hence intact rock bridges 
contribute to the strength of any composite surface controlled by 
joints. Coal Measures joints are usually close to orthogonal to 
bedding and so their provision of basal surfaces for deformation, 
by directly intersecting with exposed slope faces, is also controlled 
by strata orientation. Jointing has been observed to contribute 
to minor or bench failures in this manner. Intensely jointed and 
bedded argillaceous rock units, especially when weakened by 
weathering, appear to be prone to instability which may develop 
with a quasi-rotational mechanism. Progression of deformation in 
such rock, which is not controlled by single persistent discontinuities, 
has been observed to be confined to levels above any underlying 
stronger and less discontinuous units. Jointing and subsidence 
fractures can control secondary permeability and hydraulic continuity 
between rock units and hence influence groundwater pressure 
distributions. The nature of groundwater pressures in variou~ 
slope settings and the control exerted by mining activity is little 
understood. 
- 446 -
Growing experience from laboratory testing continues to clarify 
the strain-softening characteristics of Coal Measures rocks and their 
discontinuities. This has been matched by an increasing recognition 
of the progressive nature of instabilities observed in mine .lope  
Slope analysis techniques currently in use do not incorporate 
allowance for such characteristics. 
Slope failures predominantly comprise rigid masses which exhibit 
asymmetry in plan and section under the primary control of structural 
geology. The provision of adverse structural features to release 
masses close to limiting equilibrium is basic to the consideration 
of Coal Measures slope stability. These features appear not only to 
govern the stability of slopes but also the extent and rate of 
deformation. Faulting, besides providing adverse local strata 
steepening, also has been frequently observed to provide kinematic 
release by providing persistent planes for shear or tensile 
deformation. Release has also been observed to be afforded by 
composite surfaces through joints and intact rock. as well as 
subsidence fractures. 
Analytical techniques require development to provide realistic 
simulation of both this progressive and thre~-dimensional nature of 
slope deformation. This requires continued support from laboratory 
and field materials testing, slope monitoring and back-analysis case 
studies in order to relate theoretical to actual slope behaviour. 
Attention should be given to the continued accumulation of 
well-documented instability case histories. Their analysis offers 
the ability to assess contributory factors and deformation mechanisms 
together with the effectiveness of slope definition, mining strategy 
and geotechnical design. They represent the wealth of experience 
- 447 -
and, in themselves, provide a means of predicting slope behaviour 
in the range of possible mine environments. 
The quality of ground behaviour prediction is dependent not only 
upon the effectiveness of analytical techniques but also upon the 
quality of the initial slope definition. The reliable identification 
and characterisation of weak slope components, local variatio~s in 
strata dips, faulting and groundwater pressures is particularly 
important during mine exploration, as a prelude to mine design. 
This could be improved by the greater utilization of exploration 
boreholes and geophysical logging for geotechnical purposes. 
This thesis has featured the work from three extensive slope 
monitoring projects. Consideration has been given to the application 
of surveying techniques in slope monitoring since these are 
fundamental to any monitoring scheme. Borehole and surface 
monitoring methods continue to evolve in design and application 
as experience from such projects is gained and a variety of slope 
environments encountered. The benefits of slope monitoring, 
evident from this work, are twofold. Monitoring firstly offers 
the ability to identify slope deformation, anticipate the 
development of instability or failure, characterise the features 
of any post-failure deformation and support the design of re~edial 
measures. It secondly provides a quantitative means of characterising 
the nature of deformation mechanisms and their contributory factors. 
Only the monitoring of deformation and groundwater, supported by 
materials testing and field mapping, can provide access to the 
knowledge which is essential to the development of effective 
analytical techniques to aid mine design. This requires both the 
recognition of the value of geotechnical engineering and also the 
combined co-operation of mining, geological and surveying personnel 
as well as geotechnical engineers.
