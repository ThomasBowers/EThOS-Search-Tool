Abstract
The thick and seismically fast Precambrian continental remnants (cratons) provide fundamental clues
about the tectonic processes that operated on the early Earth. Eastern Canada is a natural laboratory
to study such processes: its geological record spans more than 3Ga of Earth history, including the
assembly of the largest Archean craton in the world, the Superior craton, which is surrounded by
global scale Proterozoic and Phanerozoic orogenic belts.
To investigate the crustal and lithospheric structure of eastern Canada, earthquake data recorded at
a new broadband seismic network were analysed, in conjunction with other permanent and temporary
networks. The QM-III (Quebec-Maine Across Three Sutures) network was deployed across the main
tectonic boundaries in eastern Canada, extending from Hudson Bay to the Atlantic Ocean.
Using H stacking and probabilistic inversion of receiver functions, bulk crustal composition (Vp/Vs
ratio), crustal thickness and shear wavespeed (Vs) were estimated beneath seismic stations. Post-
Archean crust is thicker (40 km), faster (dVs 0.2 km/s), more heterogenous and more mafic (Vp/Vs
1.76), suggesting increased crustal growth efficiency, possibly stimulated by mafic underplating.
Lack of correlation between Moho topography, elevation and gravity anomalies in Proterozoic terranes
indicate isostatic imbalance, best explained by strong mantle buoyant support.
An anisotropic seismic model of the Precambrian lithosphere was constructed using fundamental-
mode Rayleigh waves. Phase velocity heterogeneity and azimuthal anisotropy patterns reveal multiple
lithospheric layers within the Superior craton, with distinct tectonic origins. The upper lithosphere
is seismically fast (2%) and preserves Archean fossil anisotropy (1%), implying that plate-scale
deformation occured during the Archean. This layer partially extends beneath the adjacent Pro-
terozoic belt and survived subsequent metasomatism. The lower lithosphere is fast (2%), more
homogenous and weakly anisotropic (<0.5%), documenting post-assembly lithospheric growth in a
slow convection regime. Cratonization processes may be episodic and are not exclusively an Archean
phenomenon.

Introduction
1.1 Precambrian plate tectonics and mantle keels
The first continents on Earth formed more than 3 billion years ago (Ga), when Earth conditions were
likely very different. Cratons are the continental remnants from the Archean eon (>2.5Ga) and now
form the tectonically quiescent, stable cores of modern continents worldwide (Figure 1.1). Cratons are
geologically distinct from younger regions and are typically underlain by anomalously thick (300 km),
seismically fast (e.g Nettles and Dziewonski , 2008; Ritsema et al., 2011; Schaeffer and Lebedev , 2013),
and chemically depleted (Griffin et al., 2003) lithospheric roots, or keels.
The interior structure of cratonic mantle and its formation and evolution through time has been
widely debated. Contrasting generation models were proposed (Figure 1.2), ranging from vertically
dominant mechanisms, such as mantle plume melt extraction (e.g. Arndt et al., 2009; Hawkesworth
et al., 2010; Wyman and Kerrich, 2002) to multi-stage delamination of the lithosphere (e.g. Bedard ,
2006; Zegers and Van Keken, 2001). Conversely, laterally-oriented growth models analogous to modern
style plate tectonics include multiple island arc accretion episodes (e.g. Hammer et al., 2010; Miller
and Eaton, 2010; White et al., 2003), Himalayan scale continental collisions (e.g. St-Onge et al., 2006)
or underthrusting of oceanic crust (e.g. Bostock et al., 2010).
While much of the geological record on Earth can be interpreted in the context of active processes
occurring at the plate boundaries, no consensus has emerged concerning the extent to which modern
tectonic processes can be extrapolated to a much younger, hotter Earth (e.g. Griffin et al., 2003; Lee
et al., 2011). The uniformitarian plate tectonic model is well established for Phanerozoic (younger

than 542Ma) rocks. However, during the Precambrian (older than 542Ma), the thermochemical state
of the mantle was likely very different. Analogies with with modern-style plate tectonic mechanisms
are thus less certain (e.g. Arndt et al., 2009; Korenaga, 2013). Several studies of the early Earth
point to radically different models, with estimations of the onset of modern plate tectonic mechanisms
ranging between 4.1 Ga (e.g. Hopkins et al., 2008) and ca. 1Ga (Figure 1.3, Stern, 2005). The interior
structure, lateral extent and formation mechanisms of cratonic mantle and crust and their link to the
possible emergence of plate tectonics remain uncertain.
An early global compilation of wide-angle seismic data (Durrheim and Mooney , 1991) suggested that
crustal properties in cratonic regions may also be age dependent, with Archean (>2.5Ga) crust being
up to 10 km thinner than Proterozoic (2.5-0.5Ga) and Phanerozoic (<542Ma) terranes, due to a
secular change in mantle properties at the end of the Archean (Figure 1.4). However, the high seismic
velocity anomaly usually associated with cratonic material (e.g. Griffin et al., 2003; Jordan, 1988) has
been imaged beneath both Archean and Proterozoic terranes in some tomographic models (e.g. Bedle
and van der Lee, 2009; van der Lee and Frederiksen, 2005a; Yuan et al., 2011) while in others, it is
spatially confined to the Archean (e.g. Nettles and Dziewonski , 2008; Ritsema et al., 2011; Shapiro
and Ritzwoller , 2002). Increasing evidence suggests that an age-progressive mantle signature may in
fact represent vast amounts of geochemically modified in situ Archean mantle, underlying Proterozoic
terranes (e.g. Boyce et al., 2016; Griffin et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2013a).
Some keels have been found to comprise fast-wavespeed, chemically depleted upper layers, underlain
by a cold but compositionally less-distinct thermal boundary layer (e.g. Kopylova and Russell , 2000;
Yuan and Romanowicz , 2010), separated by a mid-lithospheric discontinuity (MLD, Figure 1.4). The
origin and depth of the intracratonic layers and the MLD remains unclear (Selway et al., 2015). The
nature of the MLD has been attributed to metasomatism (e.g. Savage and Silver , 2008), partial melt
(e.g. Thybo, 2006), elastically accommodated grain-boundary sliding (Karato, 2012), decrease in Mg
content with depth (e.g. Yuan and Romanowicz , 2010), stacked subduction of non-eclogitized oceanic
crust (e.g. Bostock et al., 2010) or peripheral deformation zones around thickened lithosphere above
mantle downwellings (Cooper and Miller , 2014).
High resolution images of the cratonic interiors and their surrounding regions are of central importance
to discriminate between the proposed formation hypotheses and to shed light on the geological mecha-
nisms that operated on the early Earth. Incoming seismic waves from teleseismic earthquakes (located
more than 30 away from the recording station) sample different rock structures and interfaces of the

crust and mantle beneath a seismic station. Wave propagation properties provide information about
the stratification, composition and temperature of the component layers. For example, the time of ar-
rival of P-to-S converted phases at the Mohorovicic discontinuity (Moho) and their subsequent crustal
reverberations can be used to infer the bulk composition of the crust and the Moho topography. These
can further be related to past deformational events or subsequent tectonic phenomena that reworked
the Earths crust through time. Surface waves of different frequencies are sensitive to structures at
different lithospheric depths. The phase velocity of Rayleigh waves can be related to rock composition
and temperature. Also, directional variation of the phase velocity can arise due to anisotropic olivine
crystal imbrication in the mantle, caused by mantle flow, alignment of melts, tectonic deformation or
a combination thereof. Broadband seismology imaging techniques can thus provide fundamental clues
about the geological processes that led to keel development.
1.2 Eastern Canada, the ideal natural laboratory for studying Pre-
cambrian lithosphere
Eastern Canada is the ideal natural laboratory to study the interior structure and evolution of Pre-
cambrian continents and their surrounding terranes. The region includes the most extensive area of
Archean crust in the world: the >2.5Ga Superior craton. The Superior craton was involved in multi-
ple supercontinent and Wilson cycles, leading to the building and stabilization of the Laurentian keel,
the core of the North American continent (Figure 1.5). Its edges have been reworked in collision with
multiple cratons throughout history: to the west, north and northeast, the Trans-Hudson and New
Quebec orogenies marked the collision with the Churchill craton around 1.9Ga; to the southeast, the
Himalayan-scale Grenville orogen resulted from the collision of the Superior with Amazonia 1.1Ga
ago, forming the Grenville Province. A series of subsequent break-ups and collisions marked the closure
of multiple Phanerozoic oceans, forming the Appalachian Province. The geological record of eastern
Canada thus captures crust and mantle from Archean to Phanerozoic (Figure 1.5), spanning 3Ga
of Earths history, making it an ideal place to test hypotheses concerning Precambrian continental
genesis and evolution. Additionally, the North American plate drifted on top of the Great Meteor
hotspot between 90 and 190Ma, leaving a track of igneous intrusions that cross-cut the major tectonic
boundaries, providing excellent opportunity to explore the extent to which terranes of different ages
are able to resist modification by hotspot tectonism.

28 Chapter 1. Introduction
1.3 Seismic imaging methods overview
Earthquakes are high energy, natural sources that radiate a variety of seismic waves which propagate
throughout the Earth and interact with the structures within. Assuming the convolutional model
(Equation 1.1), the Earth can be thought of as a linear filter to the original source time function of
the earthquake, S(t).
D(t) = S(t)  E(t)  I(t), (1.1)
where D(t) is the recorded data, S(t) is the source-time function of the earthquake, E(t) is the medium
impulse response function and I(t) is the recording instrument impulse response. Seismograph stations
at the surface, I(t), detect and record the ground motion generated by seismic waves. The recorded
seismogram (Figure 1.6), D(t), can then be used to infer information about the interior structure of
the Earth, E(t).
To investigate the geological structures beneath eastern Canada, I used earthquake data recorded at
permanent and temporary networks of broadband seismograph stations located across eastern Canada,
northern USA and Greenland. Additionally, a new 1000 km long quasi-linear network of broadband
seismographs, the QM-III array (Quebec- Maine Across Three Sutures, Figure 1.5) was deployed
between 2012 and 2015, from the southern tip of Hudson Bay to the Atlantic borderlands. The network
was part of a collaborative project between Rutgers University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory,
in USA, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Canada and Imperial College London. The network crosses
the main tectonic boundaries, from the Archean Superior Craton, through the Proterozoic Grenville
Orogenic province to the Phanerozoic Appalachian Province, spanning 3Ga of geologic history and
providing excellent opportunity to study the formation and evolution of continents through time.
Earthquakes radiate a variety of seismic waves that obey different propagation physics and are uniquely
sensitive to specific rock structures. Body waves, including S and P waves are the high speed, high
frequency, low amplitude waves that travel throughout the interior of the Earth. Surface waves, such
as Rayleigh and Love waves, are high amplitude, lower speed, lower frequency waves that propagate
mainly within the crust and upper mantle. Figure 1.6 shows a seismogram recorded at the broadband
station ACCN in northeast USA. Body waves can be identified in the 0.4-4Hz frequency band, while
surface waves are distinguished in the 0.005-0.03Hz range.
1.3. Seismic imaging methods overview 29
Incoming body waves from teleseismic earthquakes ( > 30) have an almost vertical angle of incidence
on the crust beneath a seismic station. Direct P waves interact with the crust-mantle boundary, where
they are converted to secondary S waves and subsequently reverberate within the crust (Figure 1.7).
These reverberations can be enhanced by deconvolving the vertical from the horizontal seismogram
recorded at individual stations (e.g. Langston, 1979), which should eliminate the source function and
the path propagation effects and result in the radial receiver function of the crust beneath the station
(Figure 1.7). Receiver functions can be used to infer information about the crustal thickness, bulk
crustal P to S wave speed ratio (VP /VS , a proxy for bulk crustal composition) and shear velocity
structure, providing fundamental insights about the tectonic processes that shaped the Laurentian
crust over time. To estimate the Moho depth and crustal composition, I processed data from 68
seismograph stations in southeast Canada, using the classical H   stacking of receiver functions
(Zhu and Kanamori , 2000). I then interpolated the measurements to build a topographic map of the
crust-mantle boundary, as well as a map of bulk composition of crust of different ages. Using a novel
probabilistic Bayesian waveform inversion technique (Bodin et al., 2012), I estimated 1D shear wave
velocity profiles of the crust and probabilities of discontinuities across the QM-III seismic array.
Rayleigh waves are coupled P and SV waves, with an elliptical particle motion in the vertical plane.
They propagate mainly in the crust and upper mantle, making them ideal for imaging the shear
wave velocity structure of the Earths upper 350 km. In a multi-layered Earth, Rayleigh waves are
dispersive, with short period waves sampling the shallower layers with a lower velocity, while longer
period waves propagate deeper in the Earths mantle, at higher speeds (Figure 1.8). To estimate the
Rayleigh wave phase velocity variation with period, I used a two-station waveform cross-correlation
method (Meier et al., 2004), which involved processing 180,000 earthquake seismograms simulta-
neously recorded at 48 broadband seismograph stations across eastern Canada, northern US and
Greenland. Using a Fourier decomposition of the measured apparent Rayleigh wave phase velocity,
I estimated the variation of isotropic and anisotropic velocity components at selected periods (De-
schamps et al., 2008), between 20 and 220 s. Lateral variations in isotropic phase velocity at each
period were interpreted in terms of temperature, composition and lithospheric thickness. The direc-
tional dependence of phase velocity is known to be caused by alignment of olivine crystals in response
to shear deformation, which can be preserved and used to interpret past geological events. Estimated
phase velocity anisotropy was compared with surface geological boundaries, absolute plate motion and
numerical models of mantle convection to diagnose the origin of cratonic mantle anisotropy.

32 Chapter 1. Introduction
1.4 Thesis summary
Chapter 2 (Geological and tectonic setting) describes the current geological knowledge about the
tectonic provinces that are part of the eastern Canadian landmass. Chapter 3 (Previous geophysical
work) is a review of the geophysical methods used to investigate the structure of the crust and upper
mantle of eastern Canada and the corresponding geological interpretations. Chapter 4 (Seismology
methods of imaging the crustal and upper mantle structure) gives an overview of the datasets and
the background physical and mathematical theory for the data processing techniques used in this
study. Chapter 5 (Crustal structure of southeast Canada imaged by receiver functions) presents
the datasets used for processing receiver functions, the estimated crustal seismic properties and their
geological interpretations in conjunction with previous geophysical work. Chapter 6 (Lithospheric
structure from surface wave tomography) focuses on the deeper lithospheric structure, imaged with
Rayleigh waves. It presents the earthquake datasets used for processing, the estimated phase velocity
results of the waveform cross-correlation method and the variation of isotropic and anisotropic phase
velocity with period. Interpretations of key features of the model are put forward. Chapter 7
(Conclusions) reviews all the key interpretations of the crustal and lithospheric imaging results in the
context of the formation and evolution of Precambrian continents. Chapter 8 (Future work) proposes
a range of possible methods that could improve the results and interpretations of this study, such as
depth inversions and thermochemical modeling of seismic velocity.
Chapter 2
Geological and tectonic setting
Eastern Canada records 3Ga of tectonic events leading to the formation and stabilisation of the
Laurentian protocontinent. It comprises the largest cratonic area in the world, the 3.1-2.6Ga Superior
craton (Card , 1990; Thurston and Chivers, 1990), whose eastern margin is flanked by the Himalayan
scale Grenville Province (Carr et al., 2000; Rivers, 2008), a 1.1Ga Proterozoic orogen, and the
440Ma Phanerozoic Appalachian orogenic belt (Hoffman, 1989a, Figure 2.1). The most recent
event that affected the area is the passage of the continent over the Great Meteor Hotspot between
160Ma and 80Ma (Sleep, 1990).
2.1 The Superior Craton
The stable Precambrian nucleus of the North American continent consists of a geologic assembly of
Archean cratonic blocks, assembled through a series of Paleoproterozoic collisions (Hoffman, 1988),
forming the Laurentian Shield (Figure 2.1). With an area of 1.6  106 km2, the Superor craton is
the largest province of the Laurentian Shield and the largest exposed area of Archean geology in the
world. The Superior craton is thought to have formed between 3.1 and 2.6Ga (Card , 1990; Thurston
and Chivers, 1990), through the north-south progressive accretion of microblocks of diverse tectonic
origins (e.g. Calvert et al., 1995; Lin et al., 1996; Ludden and Hynes, 2000; Thurston, 1991), although a
plate-tectonic style origin is debated (Clowes et al., 1998). Structural trends change from E-W trends
in the south and west, and N-S trends in the northeast. Also, a southward progressive younging of the
surface geological age has been recognised (Hammer et al., 2010). Card (1990) identified four types
of belts within the Superior Province (Figure 2.1): volcano-plutonic terrains of island-arc affinity (e.g.
Abitibi, La Grande River), metasedimentary accretionary prisms (e.g. Pontiac, Opinaca, Nemiscau),
34 Chapter 2. Geological and tectonic setting
plutonic complexes of continental affinity (Opatica) and high-grade gneiss complexes that could be
the result of deep erosion (Bienville, Minto; Percival et al., 1989). Moser and Heaman (1997) found
that the last zircon overgrowths in a lower crustal xenolith from Abitibi subprovince are 2.5Ga old,
with no evidence of subsequent modification.
The edges of the Superior craton were reworked during multiple Wilson and supercontinent cycles.
Also, failed rifting episodes at the paleocratonic margins of Laurentia generated radiating dyke swarms
across the craton, recording magmatic pulses at 2.5, 2.2 and 2.1Ga (Ernst and Bleeker , 2010). During
a global continental aggregation period at 1.8Ga, the Superior craton collided with several other
cratons. To the north and west, the collision with the Rae and Hearne domains resulted in the
Himalayan scale Trans-Hudson orogeny, remnants of which are submerged beneath Hudson Bay. To
the northeast, the New Quebec Orogen is the Paleoproterozoic vestige of the collision between the
Eastern Churchill Province and the Superior craton.
2.2 The Eastern Churchill Province
The Eastern Churchill Province (Figure 2.1) comprises an Archean core of uncertain origin, trapped
between two Paleoproterozoic orogenic belts: the New Quebec and the Torngat, orientated along
a general N-S axis (Wardle et al., 1990). The eastern coast of the Eastern Churchill Province is
another Archean cratonic remnant of the previously wider Nain province, which was separated from
its main landmass in Greenland by the Phanerozoic opening of the Labrador Sea (90Ma, Roest and
Srivastava, 1989).
2.3 The Grenville Orogenic Belt
The eastern margin of the Superior craton was reworked during the Grenville Orogeny (GO), one of
the largest tectonic episodes of the Proterozoic eon, a 100Ma long Himalayan scale event (Hynes and
Rivers, 2010) that marked the formation of the Rodinia supercontinent. Laurentia collided with Ama-
zonia around 1.1Ga (Li et al., 2008), strongly reworking the Laurentian cratonic margins, previously
involved in a long duration Andean-style subduction that preceded the Grenville Orogeny (Rivers,
1997). The Grenville Province has three main tectonic domains (Figure 2.1). The Allochthonous
Monocyclic terranes (AMT) in the SW are considered to be exotic terranes accreted to Laurentia
during a convergence period between 1080 and 1035Ma (Carr et al., 2000). The Allochthonous Poly-

36 Chapter 2. Geological and tectonic setting
cyclic Terranes (APT) comprise rocks originally part of a Laurentian continental margin-arc setting,
reworked during the Grenvillian orogeny and tectonically transported over the foreland, separated by
the Allochthon Boundary Thrust (ABT) (Figure 2.1). Much of the Grenville Province is underlain
by granulite- and upper amphibolite-facies rocks that are interpreted to have formed in the orogenic
mid crust during the GO at 1080-1050Ma (Rivers et al., 2002). Some regions appear to have es-
caped Grenvillian metamorphism and are termed collectively the Orogenic Lid. The Orogenic Lid
formed during extensional collapse and represents part of the upper orogenic crust that has been
down-dropped and is now adjacent to the exhumed high-grade mid crust. Also, the ABT shows
signs of extension, supporting the theory that the Grenville was a hot long duration plateau similar
to Tibet, that experienced progressive collapse and potentially mid crustal channel flow (Jamieson
et al., 2007; Rivers, 2008). After a 20Ma tectonic hiatus, the orogenic forces migrated towards the
foreland, similar to the Himalayas propagating thrust system. The Parautochthonous Belt (PB) was
formed between 1010 and 980Ma, as a response to the second orogenic Grenvillian pulse which caused
medium and high pressure metamorphism in the footwall of the ABT between the Grenville Front and
the ABT (Rivers, 2008). The Grenville Front (GF) is a low dipping thrust zone that marks the limit
of the Grenvillian metamorphic signature. It was also proposed that the GF is a pre-existing zone of
weakness, reactivated during the Grenville orogeny (e.g. Martignole and Calvert , 1996).
Massive magmatic intrusions comprise 20% of the surface geology in the Grenville Province (Fig-
ure 2.1). Anorthosite massifs are components of the AMCG (anorthosite-mangerite-charnockite-
granite/gabbro) suites and are highly feldspathic intrusive rocks with a geochemical signature unique
to Proterozoic times. Their ages range from 1.6Ga, 1.33-1.36Ga, 1.16-1.13Ga to 1.09-1.05Ga, which
appear coeval with massive magmatic pulses and convergent tectonism (Corrigan and Hanmer , 1997).
The petrogenesis of these intrusions is highly debated (e.g. Bedard , 2010). Anorthosites are generally
accepted to have fractionated from mafic material ponded beneath the crust (e.g. Ashwal , 1993; Cor-
rigan and Hanmer , 1997; Emslie, 1985; Musacchio and Mooney , 2002), although some geochemical
evidence points to a crustal origin (e.g. Duchesne et al., 1999) or even a mixture of crust and upper
mantle (e.g. Musacchio and Mooney , 2002, and references therein). Whether this period of voluminous
magmatism was triggered as a result of convective thinning or delamination of the lithosphere which
might have stimulated heat influx at the base of the crust, or evolved in a backarc system in an overall
convergent setting, if plate tectonics were active at the time, is uncertain.
The breakup of Rodinia led to the formation of the Iapetus Ocean (Kamo et al., 1995) in stages
2.4. The Appalachian Province 37
between ca. 600Ma and 550Ma (Cawood and Nemchin, 2001) and the opening of the Rheic Ocean at
ca. 480Ma (e.g. Cocks and Torsvik , 2002). Two failed rifts from this Paleozoic break-up episode scar
the crust of the Grenville Province: the Ottawa-Bonnechere graben, which cross-cuts the southern
portion (Mereu et al., 1986), and the St Lawrence rift system (Kumarapeli and Saull , 1966), located
on the eastern edge of the Grenville Province (Figure 2.1).
2.4 The Appalachian Province
Gondwana and Baltica collided with Laurentia between 480 and 260Ma, closing the Iapetus and Rheic
Oceans and forming the Pangea supercontinent by the Late Carboniferous. The Appalachian province
(Figure 2.1) is a remnant of this supercontinent cycle, comprising stacked terranes of Gondwanan/pan-
African affinity (Meguma and Avalon terranes), Laurentian margin (Humber zone), vestiges of the
Iapetus and Rheic Oceans (Gander) and accretionary complexes (Dunnage) (van Staal and Barr ,
2012, and references therein).
2.5 The Great Meteor hotspot track
Between 160 and 80Ma, the North American continent experienced hotspot tectonism (Sleep, 1990),
resulting in a hotspot track (Figure 2.1) that cross-cuts all the major tectonic boundaries in SE
Canada. At surface, the Great Meteor hotspot track is marked by dykes and kimberlite pipes in the
Superior (Griffin et al., 2004; Ji et al., 1996), igneous intrusions in the Grenville (Foland et al., 1986)
and the Appalachians and volcanic seamounts in the Atlantic (Duncan, 1984). However, the extent
to which hotspot tectonism affected the crust and the lithospheric mantle beneath these provinces is
uncertain.

Previous geophysical studies
3.1 Crustal structure
The crustal structure of the southeastern Canadian Shield has been previously imaged by a range of ac-
tive seismic surveys: the Abitibi-Grenville transects of LITHOPROBE (e.g. Clowes et al., 1996; Ham-
mer et al., 2010; Ludden and Hynes, 2000; White et al., 2000), the 1988 COCRUST surveys (Canadian
Consortium for Crustal Reconnaissance using Seismic Techniques) of the Ottawa-Bonnechere graben
(e.g. Mereu et al., 1986), the 1982 COCORP (Consortium for Continental Reflection Profiles) surveys
(e.g Brown et al., 1983), GLIMPCE (Great Lakes Multidisciplinary Program on Crustal Evolution)
surveys (e.g. Green et al., 1988) and the 1988 Grenville-Appalachian refraction experiment (e.g. Hughes
and Luetgert , 1991; Musacchio and Mooney , 2002).
In the Archean Superior craton, reflection seismic profiles are generally interpreted as 10-20 km thick
stacked terranes (Musacchio, 2004; White et al., 2003) above decollement surfaces (Hammer et al.,
2010). A northward-dipping zone of high reflectivity, penetrating the Moho and extending 30 km
into the upper mantle (line 48 in Figure 3.1), was detected beneath the Abitibi-Opatica boundary and
interpreted as a fossilized Archean subducted slab (Calvert et al., 1995). The crustal structure of the
Abitibi province comprises three layers (Calvert and Ludden, 1999): an allochthonous upper crust, a
middle crust of unknown affinity and a highly reflective lower crust. Gravity modeling (Telmat et al.,
2000) is consistent with a 40 km thick crust beneath La Grande, 36 km beneath Nemiscau and
44 km beneath Abitibi and Opatica (Figure 2.1) and estimated a decrease in upper crustal density
from Nemiscau and La Grande to Abitibi and Opatica subprovinces.
LITHOPROBE seismic profiles (Figure 3.1) image the GF as a low dip thrust system (Figure 3.2),
which implies that Archean lower crust extends beneath the Grenville Province for up to 250 km

(see Figure 2.1).
40 Chapter 3. Previous geophysical studies
(White et al., 2000). This observation has been used as a rationale for interpreting any significant deep
crustal features proximal to the GF as signatures of pre-Grenvillian tectonics. Two teleseismic receiver
function profiles crossing the GF (Figures 3.1,3.3) image a Moho ramp with a depth difference of
10 km, occurring 60 km SE of the Grenville Front (Eaton et al., 2006; Rondenay et al., 2000a) which
was interpreted as a fossilised Archean Moho feature linked to pre-Grenvillian subduction (Rondenay
et al., 2000a). A 10 km thickening of the crust beneath the PB, from 34-36 km directly beneath
the GF to 43 km, 60 km to the SE, was also detected in active seismic surveys (Martignole and
Calvert , 1996; White et al., 2000; Winardhi and Mereu, 1997). Other seismic characteristics that
appear to change across the Archean-Proterozoic boundary include an increase in P-wave velocity and
Moho sharpness (Winardhi and Mereu, 1997), and the emergence of sub-crustal reflective lamination
patterns beneath the Proterozoic (Mereu, 2000). The thickened crust on the Proterozoic side of the
GF (44 km) appears to thin towards the centre of the province to 36 km and thicken again to 50 km,
on LITHOPROBE line 52 (Figure 3.1, Martignole and Calvert , 1996). Seismic and gravity studies
further northeast (line 55, Figure 3.1) are consistent with a 53 km crust beneath the PB which thins
to 43 km beneath the APT (Eaton and Hynes, 2000; Eaton et al., 1995; Hynes et al., 2000).
The Grenville to Appalachian transition has been imaged both by passive and active seismic studies.
Jordan (1975) and Owens (1987) imaged a lower than average velocity lower crust (shear velocities of
3.4 and 3.6 km/s, respectively) overlain by a higher velocity mid-crust (4 km/s) in the southeastern
Grenville province (Figure 3.1). Taylor et al. (1980) imaged a relatively homogeneous Grenville crust
and a well-defined two layer Appalachian crust, with a 3.6 km/s upper layer overlying a 3.9-4.1 km/s
lower crust. Shear wave models obtained via surface wave analyses (Taylor and Toksoz , 1982) re-
vealed an increase in crustal thickness and shear wave velocity between the southern Grenville and
Appalachians. On the other hand, refraction seismic studies (Hughes and Luetgert , 1991; Musacchio
and Mooney , 2002; Musacchio et al., 1997) estimated a lateral decrease in velocity, crustal thickness
and Poissons ratio from the Proterozoic to Phanerozoic. The P wave velocity of the bottom 20 km of
the Grenvillian crust increases from 7.00 km/s to 7.24 km/s while Vp/Vs decreases from 1.84 to 1.81.
These gradients imply an increase in S wave velocity from 3.8 to 4 km/s, in contrast to earlier findings
(Jordan, 1975). High P wave velocities (>6.8 km/s) in the Grenville lower crust are also observed in
a number of wide angle seismic surveys across the Atlantic borderlands (Hall et al., 1998). The lower
crust beneath the Humber Zone (composed of Grenvillian basement) exhibits a Vp of 7.2 km/s (Michel
et al., 1992). Marillier and Reid (1990) found a similar lower crustal velocity (7.0 km/s) beneath the
Gulf of St Lawrence, in a Carboniferous basin that lies above the ancient Iapetus eastern oceanic

3.2 Upper mantle structure
The upper mantle structure beneath Eastern Canada has been investigated with seismological imaging
methods, including surface and body wave tomography (e.g. Boyce et al., 2016; Schaeffer and Lebe-
dev , 2014; Villemaire et al., 2012), receiver functions and SKS splitting (e.g. Darbyshire et al., 2015;
Frederiksen et al., 2006), which provided information about the distribution of seismic wavespeeds,
discontinuities and seismic anisotropy. Gravity (e.g. Dufrechou and Harris, 2013) and magnetotelluric
(e.g. Adetunji et al., 2014) modeling also placed constraints on the density and resistivity structure of
the lithosphere in the area.
An anomalously high-velocity and thick lithospheric root is imaged beneath much of the Canadian
Shield by global (e.g. Ritsema et al., 2011; Schaeffer and Lebedev , 2013), continental (e.g. Schaeffer
and Lebedev , 2014) and regional scale (e.g. Darbyshire et al., 2013) seismic tomography studies. The
bottom of the high-velocity lid is usually associated with the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary
(LAB), although the definition and location of its depth is highly variable between studies (Eaton
et al., 2009). While some seismic studies located it as shallow as 94 km (Rychert and Shearer , 2009),
or 150 km (e.g. Shapiro and Ritzwoller , 2002), most continental- (e.g. Bedle and van der Lee, 2009;
Schaeffer and Lebedev , 2014; Yuan et al., 2011) and regional-scale seismic models (e.g.Darbyshire et al.,
2013) show fast mantle velocities to depths of at least 200 km (Figure 3.4). Using S-receiver function
CCP stacking in Canada, Porritt et al. (2015) proposed a lithosphere thickness of 300 km beneath
the northeastern Superior craton (Figure 3.4). More recently, it has been proposed that the shallow
LAB detected mainly by S-receiver functions within cratonic regions is in fact a mid-lithospheric
discontinuity (MLD, e.g. Abt et al., 2010; Ford et al., 2010; Yuan and Romanowicz , 2010).
The lateral extent and edge geometry of cratonic keels, generally diagnosed from their high velocity
anomaly signature, vary across tomographic models. An interpretation of active seismic surveys of the
Canadian cratons (Snyder , 2002) suggested that the strong Archean cratonic mantle forms a wedge
which indents into more juvenile Proterozoic mantle (Figure 3.5). Beneath the Grenville, high velocity
and high resistivity material was detected in multiple seismic (Aktas and Eaton, 2006; Chen and Li ,
2012; Rondenay et al., 2000b) and magnetotelluric (Adetunji et al., 2014) studies, between 50 and
150 km depth, extending 300 km eastward beneath the Proterozoic. Interpretations of this feature

area.

include depletion of Fe with respect to Mg of Archean lithospheric material (Adetunji et al., 2014;
Chen and Li , 2012) or relict Proterozoic subduction signature (Aktas and Eaton, 2006). A recent
mantle tomographic study of the area (Boyce et al., 2016), detected a sharp lateral decrease in the S
and P wave velocity beneath the Archean-Proterozoic surface boundary, which was associated with
the signature of a metasomatic front (Boyce et al., 2016).
Whether or not fossil tectonic structures are preserved within the Archean mantle or how far it
extends beneath neighbouring provinces are ongoing debates. SKS splitting measurements at an array
of seismic stations crossing the GF in the southeast Superior province (Ji et al., 1996; Rondenay et al.,
2000b; Senechal et al., 1996) were found to be subparallel to Archean shear zones and consistently
oblique to electrical anisotropy measurements across the GF, suggesting a preserved fossil strain signal
in the lithosphere that extends beneath the Grenville Province (Ji et al., 1996). In a regional gravity
study, Dufrechou and Harris (2013) identified lithospheric scale lineaments that extend beneath both
the Superior and Grenville and presumably continue beneath the Baltic shield, previously docked with
the Superior craton in the Paleoproterozoic.
Electromagnetic surveys of the Archean-Proterozoic boundary imaged conductive zones that cross-
cut seismic reflectors, suggesting that the electrical signature beneath the Superior is controlled by
present day processes (Boerner et al., 2000). A more recent magnetotelluric model of the Precambrian
upper lithosphere however shows that the GF coincides with a change in electrical resistivity, from
a conductive Superior lithosphere to a highly resistive lithospheric scale structure ((up to 4 orders
of magnitude more resistive; Adetunji et al., 2014, 2015), dipping beneath the Grenville Province.
Adetunji et al. (2014) interpreted the dipping, high resistivity material as metamorphosed Archean
lithosphere partially extending beneath the Proterozoic orogen. Local domains of higher conductivity
are present at depths >160 km beneath the Abitibi subprovince and were interpreted as refertilized
lithospheric segments related to the Cretaceous Great Meteor hotspot. Refertilization represents the
introduction of hydrogen and carbon into the lithosphere during post-Archean subduction or plume
events (such as the Great Meteor hotspot) and can result in long lived electrical conductivity, as long
as no high temperature event occurred to subsequently remove these species (Adetunji et al., 2014;
Selway , 2014).
Cratonic keels have also been recognised to be vertically stratified (e.g. Bostock , 1998; Darbyshire
and Lebedev , 2009; Griffin et al., 2004; Yuan and Romanowicz , 2010). Multilayered anisotropy was
detected in several seismic studies (Darbyshire and Lebedev , 2009; Deschamps et al., 2008; Marone

and Romanowicz , 2007; Yuan and Levin, 2014) and an MLD with negative impedance contrast has
been imaged between 80 and 120 km depth (Abt et al., 2010; Romanowicz , 2009; Rychert and Shearer ,
2009). Joint inversion of SKS and surface waveform data (Yuan and Romanowicz , 2010) revealed a
double-layered lithospheric structure, with a chemically depleted layer overlying a colder, seismically
slower transitional layer, both preserving the fabrics of frozen-in anisotropy (Figure 3.5). Anisotropic
Rayleigh wave tomography of the western Superior upper mantle (Darbyshire and Lebedev , 2009) also
detected the existence of multiple anisotropic layers within the southern region of the Superior craton,
where the direction of the fast S-wave polarization gradually aligns with present day plate motion. In
western Superior, however, a vertically coherent anisotropy direction was observed (Darbyshire and
Lebedev , 2009). In the Proterozoic Grenville Province, SKS splitting results are generally oblique
to surface tectonic belts (Eaton et al., 2004) and laterally incoherent in the region of the Ottawa-
Bonnechere Graben, a Neoproterozoic failed rift (Figure 2.1, Frederiksen et al., 2006). Joint analysis
of magnetotelluric, SKS and receiver function data resulted in the interpretation of a multilayered
upper lithosphere above a uniformly anisotropic lower lithosphere, in the Great Lakes region (Figure
2.1, Frederiksen et al., 2006). Multiple domains of anisotropy were also detected north of the Great
Lakes region (Eaton et al., 2004), where SKS splitting directions correlate with the Ottawa-Bonnechere
failed rift (Figure 2.1) and a low S-wave velocity feature in the lower lithosphere, speculated to be
caused by the passage over the Great Meteor hotspot (e.g. Eaton and Frederiksen, 2007).

and possibly mantle plumes, is also debated. A low velocity corridor with respect to the ambient mantle
was detected in multiple regional tomographic studies in the southern section of the study area (e.g.
Aktas and Eaton, 2006; Boyce et al., 2016; Chen and Li , 2012; Darbyshire et al., 2007; Frederiksen
et al., 2007; Rondenay et al., 2000a,b; van der Lee and Frederiksen, 2005b; Villemaire et al., 2012)
and was frequently associated with Cretaceous refertilisation caused by the Great Meteor hotspot.
A P-wave tomographic model shows that the low-velocity corridor progressively narrows beneath the
Superior craton (Villemaire et al., 2012), implying that Archean mantle is more resistant to mantle
plume thermochemical erosion than younger terranes. Faure et al. (2011) suggested the low-velocity
corridor is a Neoarchean mantle scar associated with greenstone belt formation and subsequently
reused by Cretaceous tectonothermal events. Frederiksen et al. (2007) and Eaton and Frederiksen
(2007) noticed that the lower lithospheric signature of the hotspot is displaced from its crustal surface
expressions in the direction of the absolute plate motion, relating it to asthenospheric basal drag.
Most previous geophysical surveys are concentrated in the southern portions of Precambrian eastern
Canada, where Phanerozoic hotspot tectonism may have affected and reset structures linked with
older processes. Deep and detailed imaging of sections of the lithosphere far enough from the possible
plume-affected regions is necessary to infer unbiased information about the processes operating on
the early Earth. In this thesis, teleseismic data are used to image the structure of the Precambrian
crust and upper mantle, its lateral extent, anisotropic fabrics and the nature of intra-lithospheric
discontinuities. These seismic properties can be linked with tectonic processes operating at the time
of lithospheric formation and can place constraints on the onset of plate tectonics and keel growth
through time.

Broadband seismological methods of
imaging crustal and upper mantle
structure
4.1 Broadband seismographs and earthquake data
Earthquakes are naturally-occurring powerful energy sources that radiate seismic waves throughout
the Earth. These waves interact with the different structures within the planet and generate surface
ground motion detected by seismograph stations worldwide. By analysing the recorded earthquake
signals, information about the interior structure of the Earth can be inferred.
In this study, 3218 earthquakes with moment magnitude >5.5 that occurred worldwide between 2009
and 2015 (Figure 4.1) were recorded at broadband seismographs located in eastern Canada (Figure
4.1). Two passive seismological methods were used in this study to image the crust and upper mantle
of eastern Canada. Receiver function analysis focuses on S and P waves detected primarily between
0.03 and 5Hz (Figure 1.6) and provides 1D information about upper lithospheric structure directly
beneath the receiver. Surface waves are detected mainly within the 0.005-0.03Hz frequency band
(Figure 1.6) and were used to investigate the average upper mantle structure between pairs of seismic
stations.
All instruments whose recorded data was used for analysis are broadband seismographs, sensitive to a
large frequency range with a low corner frequency varying between 0.008Hz (Nanometrics Trillium
120) and 0.05Hz (Guralp CMG-40T) and high corner frequency values up to 50Hz (Guralp CMG-
40T) (Figure 4.2). The seismograph stations used in each study can be seen in Figure 4.1. For more

4.1.1 The QM-III Network
A new seismic network, the X8 QM-III EarthScope FlexArray (Quebec-Maine Across Three Sutures),
was installed in eastern Canada and the northeast USA during the summers of 2012 and 2013. This
project forms part of the EarthScope FlexArray program and is a collaboration between Rutgers
University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Universite du Quebec a Montreal and Imperial College
London. A quasi-linear profile stretches from central Quebec to the Maine coast, and a distributed
2D network is emplaced across the Canadian Maritime region (Figures 1.5 and 4.1).
Broadband solar-powered seismograph stations with sampling frequencies ranging between 40 and
100Hz were deployed across the Superior, Grenville and Appalachian regions: a transect that spans
>3 billion years of early Earth history. These stations were removed at the end of 2015 and were
serviced for data collection approximately twice a year. The first data collection took place in May
2014, in Nova Scotia. Figure 4.3 shows Dr. Ian Bastow and I collecting data from one of the QM-III

stations in Nova Scotia, Canada.
4.2 Receiver functions
Seismic waves generated by teleseismic earthquakes (epicentral distance > 30) interact with intra-
lithospheric discontinuities, where they undergo refraction, reflection and mode conversion. One of
these discontinuities is the crust-mantle boundary, the Moho, where an incident compressional (P)
wave is converted to a secondary shear (S) wave. The P-to-S wave subsequently reverberates within
the crust, generating PpPs, PsPs and PpSs multiples (Figure 1.7). The amplitude and timing of these
multiples are determined by the geological structure of the crust: its composition, thickness, presence
of intracrustal discontinuities.
In order to capture and enhance these phases and to remove the earthquake source signature (S(t),
Equation 1.1), the path effects and the instrument response (I(t), Equation 1.1), the horizontal seis-
mogram is traditionally deconvolved in time domain or divided in frequency domain by the vertical
trace, generating the receiver function (RF) of the crust (e.g. Burdick and Langston, 1977; Langston,
52 Chapter 4. Broadband seismological methods of imaging crustal and upper mantle structure
1979; Vinnik , 1977).
Hr(f) =
, (4.1)
where Hr(f) is the observed frequency domain radial receiver function/frequency response, R(f) and
Z(f) are the radial and the vertical component of the recorded seismogram, respectively and f is
frequency.
Ideally, the deconvolution should generate the impulse response of the crust beneath the receiver.
However, limited bandwidth instrument response (Figure 4.2), noise contamination, shallow reso-
nances and multiply scattered waves bias the result. Popular receiver function estimator methods
include frequency domain division with a spectral water level (Langston, 1979; Owens and Zandt ,
1985), damped spectral division (Ammon, 1991), maximum likelihood estimation (Qi-Yuan et al.,
1996), Wiener estimation (Gurrola et al., 1995), maximum entropy (Wu et al., 2003), iterative time
deconvolution (Ligorra and Ammon, 1999) and multi taper methods (e.g. Park and Levin, 2000).
Traditional deconvolution methods, however, may be numerically unstable and lose amplitude at long
time lags. To overcome these deficiencies, Helffrich (2006) proposed the extended time multitaper
correlation procedure (ETMTRF), designed to minimise spectral leakage, preserve phase information
and amplitudes at longer time lags.
In the ETMTRF procedure, the eigenspectra of recorded seismograms are estimated by multiplying
the time series seismograms with a sliding sequence of Slepian eigentapers. These are then converted
to frequency domain, stacked and divided to obtain the radial receiver function (Park and Levin,
2000):
Hr(f) =
k=0 Z
(k)(f) R(k)(f)
k=0 Z
(k)(f)  Z(k)(f)) + p(f)
, (4.2)
where Hr(f) is the multi taper frequency-domain radial receiver function, the k superscript indicates
the index of the Slepian eigentaper, Z(k)(f) and R(k)(f) are eigenspectra of the vertical and radial
seismograms (i.e. spectra of time domain seismograms multiplied with eigentapers), respectively.
To avoid zero division between stacked eigenspectra, the pre-noise power spectrum on the vertical
component, p(f), is used as an estimate of the frequency damping parameter. Prior to time-domain
conversion, the resulting receiver function is filtered with a cos2 spectral taper of the form cos2(

where the corner frequency fc=2Hz.
4.2.1 Crustal structure estimated with H- stacking
The first 30 s of the radial receiver function is dominated by a Moho P-to-S converted phase and
subsequent crustal reverberations PpPs, PsPs + PpSs (Figure 4.4). The arrival times of the three
phases are unique and depend non-linearly on the crustal thickness, ray parameter and the ratio of
compressional to shear wave velocity in the crust (Zhu and Kanamori , 2000):
tPs(H,) = H
 p2 
, (4.3)
tPpPs(H,) = H

tPsPs+PpSs(H,) = 2H
 p2, (4.5)
where tPs, tPpPs, tPsPs+PpSs are arrival times of the secondary shear waves converted at the Moho
discontinuity (Figure 1.7), H is the crustal thickness,  is the Vp/Vs ratio, p is the ray parameter of
the incoming P wave and V p and V s are compressional and shear wave velocities in the crust.
Laboratory experiments reveal that the ratio of V p to V s is highly sensitive to rock composition (Figure
4.5) and only weakly dependent on temperature (Christensen, 1996). Crack density and pore fluid
pressure effects are insignificant at pressures higher than 150MPa, although anisotropy, presence of
scatterers or partial melt may affect the measurement (Krishna and Ramesh, 2000; Zandt and Ammon,
1995). The Poissons ratio, , is the ratio of lateral contraction to longitudinal extension and can thus
be related to the ratio of shear to compressional velocities of waves sampling the medium:

)2  2

. (4.6)
Since travel times in Equations 4.3 represent relative arrival times of S with respect to P waves, the
dependence of H on Vs is much stronger than on Vp. Therefore, the system can be reduced to two
unknowns: Moho depth, H, and Vp/Vs ratio. Zhu and Kanamori (2000) showed that an uncertainty in
Vp of 0.1 km/s leads to an uncertainty in H of <0.5 km, while an uncertainty in Vp/Vs of 0.1 can result
in 4 km change in crustal thickness. Zhu and Kanamori (2000) and Chevrot and van der Hilst (2000)

developed a forward search algorithm that provides estimates of H and Vp/Vs beneath individual
seismograph stations, after correcting for variations in p. The amplitudes of all the RFs for individual
stations are stacked at the estimated arrival times of the reverberations for a plausible range of H and
Vp/Vs values (Equation 4.7).

The predicted travel-times, ti are given by Equations 4.3 to 4.5. H   stacking is now a widely
used method in seismology to estimate crustal properties (e.g. Eaton et al., 2006; Tugume et al.,
2012).
To improve the coherency of stacking, a phase weighted stacking approach was used (Schimmel and
Paulssen, 1997), in which the linear stack function is weighted by a time dependent coherency measure

quantitative measure of the phase similarity or dissimilarity and varies between 0 and 1. This method

et al., 2010).

reverberation; and the  exponent controls the sharpness of the filter applied to the linear stack and is
set to the value of 2 throughout the analysis, for a better detection of weak coherent signals (Schimmel
and Paulssen, 1997).
Based on previous refraction profiles and studies of Precambrian terranes (Musacchio, 2004; Nair
et al., 2006; Thompson et al., 2010), the compressional velocity Vp was chosen to be 6.5 km/s. The
weights wk are 0.5, 0.3 and -0.2 (to account for the negative polarity of the PpSs+PsPs phase).
As an uncertainty measure, the method of Eaton et al. (2006) was used to compute one standard
deviation contours (s) below the maximum of the phase weighted stack function s
(H,), according
to Equation 4.10:

where  is the standard deviation of all the stacked values and N is the number of stacked receiver

4.2.2 Shear wave velocity from Bayesian inversion
Receiver functions are inverted for 1D shear wave velocity models using a transdimensional Bayesian
approach (Bodin et al., 2012; Sambridge et al., 2013). Probabilistic estimation of shear wave velocities
is not an inversion procedure per se. At each iteration step, a random forward model is generated
and the fit to data influences the final probability distribution solution. The advantages of this kind
of inversion are the flexible initial conditions with minimal influence on the output, the relatively
unbiased and independent model sampling process, the versatility of the model parameters and the
innovative nature of the uncertainty quantification method. However, this non-linear process comes
at the expense of increased computational time and requires trial-and-error user-settings to ensure
convergence and sufficient model space sampling.
Following Bayesian theory, the posterior probability of a model given observed data p(m|dobs) is
proportional to the likelihood of observing the data given a particular model p(dobs|m) multiplied by
the a priori probability of the model p(m):
p(m|dobs)  p(dobs|m) p(m). (4.11)
Figure 4.6 shows examples of the way the probabilistic solution can be visualised. The solution space
is represented by the posterior probability distribution p(m|dobs). The slight mismatch between the
synthetic and estimated model may arise from the intrinsic ambiguity of receiver functions, which
are insensitive to absolute velocities of the medium. A trade-off may emerge between the estimated
depth to the layer interfaces and the absolute shear wave velocity of each layer. However, the good
RF vertical resolution (2 km) enables a good assessment of the sharpness of the imaged seismic
interfaces.
The generation of random models
The posterior distribution, p(m|dobs), is approximated with a large ensemble of Vs profiles, randomly
generated via a reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (rj-MCMC, Geyer and Mller ,
1994; Green, 1995, 2003), as implemented by Bodin et al. (2012). The random model generation
mechanism works as follows: at each step, a random parameter of the model is modified in either one
of the following ways.

1. An existing layer li may be randomly selected from the user-set layers interval [1,k] (where k
is user-selected maximum allowed number of layers) and assigned a random velocity value vi,
from the proposed Gaussian distribution centered at the current vi value, with a user-selected
variance 2v .
2. A new layer li+1 may be created with a newly assigned velocity value v
i+1, drawn from the
proposed Gaussian distribution pool, as before.
3. A layer may be randomly removed from the current model, without changing the neighbouring
velocity values.
4. The position of a random layer may be randomly changed.
5. The estimated data noise of a random parameter may be randomly changed to another value,
from the proposed Gaussian distribution of data noise values.

(vi  vi)
, (4.12)
where qv is the proposed Gaussian probability distribution for the velocity parameter and 
v is the
user-selected variance of the Gaussian function. The width of the proposal distributions are user-
selected by trial-and-error, to obtain an acceptance rate as close to 44% as possible (Rosenthal ,
2000). Each parameter has a similar associated Gaussian distribution, with user-assigned variance.
Figure 4.7 shows the distribution of perturbation values for the noise scaling parameter, randomly
chosen from a proposed Gaussian distribution, such as in Equation 4.12. The distribution follows a
Gaussian function, providing reassurance that the model space has been sufficiently sampled and is
well-converged.
A priori constraints
The probability density function, p(m), is derived from a priori information, such as the minimum
and maximum shear wave velocity values between which the model is allowed to vary, or the maximum
allowed number of layers. In this study, the maximum number of layers was set to 10 and the shear
velocity was allowed to vary between 2 and 5 km/s.

The likelihood of each proposed model
The likelihood function, p(dobs|m) for each model in the ensemble is parametrised with a Gaussian
function approximation and is derived from the misfit between the observed and the modelled data
and depends on the estimated distribution for data errors.
p(dobs|m) =
(2)n|Ce
(m)
, (4.13)
(m) = (g(m) dobs)TC1e (g(m) dobs), (4.14)
where (m) is the fit to observations and is defined as the Mahalanobis distance (Mahalanobis, 1936)
between the observed, dobs, and the estimated data, g(m). Ce is the covariance of the errors in the
observed data. Noise in the RF is modeled as a stationary multivariate normal distribution function
with zero mean and covariance Ce. The covariance matrix is also parametrised with a Gaussian
correlation law (defined in Bodin et al., 2012), where the noise variance and covariance are user-
chosen parameters. In a transdimensional Bayesian formulation, they directly determine the required
level of data fit, and hence the required complexity in the unknown model (i.e. the number of layers.).
In this way, the estimated level of errors in the receiver function acts as a damping parameter and the
estimated rate of fall-off of covariance with lag acts as a smoothing parameter.
The acceptance criterion of each proposed model
At each step, the proposed randomly-generated model is either accepted or rejected, according to the
acceptance probability of the model, (m|m), where m and m are the proposed and the current
model, respectively.
(m|m) = min
p(m)
p(dobs|m)
p(dobs|m)
q(m|m)
q(m|m
 |J |
, (4.15)
where p(m) and p(dobs|m) are the prior and likelihood probabilities of the current model, respectively.
q(m|m) is the Gaussian distribution of the proposed model m centered on the current model m, while
q(m|m) is the Gaussian distribution of the current model m centered on the proposed model m. J
is the Jacobian matrix of the transformation from m to m (Bodin et al., 2012).
62 Chapter 4. Broadband seismological methods of imaging crustal and upper mantle structure
The new model m is accepted with the probability (m|m), if   r, where r is a random number
between 0 and 1. This acceptance mechanism was shown to ensure a good convergence towards the
transdimensional posterior distribution p(m|dobs) (Green, 1995, 2003).
Model convergence, potential bias and uncertainty
The first part of the reversible jump Markov chain, called the burn-in period (Figure 4.7), is dis-
carded in the calculation of the final posterior probability distribution, because the random walk is
not stationary. After the burn-in part, the sampled models are asymptotically distributed according
to the posterior distribution and a final solution model and its uncertainty are calculated from the
mean and variance of the ensemble solution of the model parameters.
The inversion was performed on a phase stack of all the receiver functions recorded at a common
station, a procedure that generates one trace per station. This might introduce bias in estimating
the structure due to moveout and 3D effects. However, at crustal depths, the main focus of this
study, all waves have nearly vertical incidence angle, and moveout effects are likely to be negligible.
Backazimuthal variability and 3D effects are always potential issues in 1D inversions. In the Archean
terranes, the assumption of 3D homogeneity may be more appropriate, while in younger terranes,
dipping interfaces, Moho topography or other more complex structures could exist, affecting the
estimated profiles. Additional errors may arise from the assumptions that the medium is isotropic
and that Vp/Vs ratio is constant, while only allowing the number and thickness of layers and their
respective shear velocities to vary. A constant velocity value is assumed for each layer and allowed to
vary within a user defined interval. Layers with velocity gradients instead of constant velocities may
change the amplitude of the arriving wavefield compared to homogeneous layers (e.g. Wang et al.,
2000), providing a potential source of error.
Probability of discontinuity
The 2D posterior probability distribution can further be integrated to obtain a marginal probability
function (Figure 4.6). This function may be regarded as a probability to find a seismic discontinuity at
each depth point and may be considered a proxy for assessing the sharpness of a seismic discontinuity.
To demonstrate the sensitivity of the marginal probability to the gradient of the seismic discontinuity,
two synthetic half-space models were constructed: one with a sharp Moho (a sudden velocity jump
from typical crustal values, 3.4 km/s, to typical upper mantle velocities, 4.4 km/s) and one with a
4.3. Surface wave analysis 63
gradational Moho (Vs increase from 3.4 km/s to 4.4 km/s over a 10 km depth range). Figure 4.6
shows that the marginal probabilities associated with each synthetic model display a sharp and high
amplitude peak at a depth within 3 km of the true crust-mantle boundary depth, in the sharp Moho
case. In the gradual case, the gradient of the seismic interface is well recovered and the marginal
probability displays a lower amplitude spread peak, whose half-width equals the thickness of the
crust-mantle seismic transitional boundary.
4.3 Surface wave analysis
4.3.1 Rayleigh wave dispersion
Rayleigh waves are the highest amplitude seismic waves and travel with phase velocities that are period
dependent and sensitive to lithospheric depths 350 km. Figure 1.8 shows a vertical seismogram,
containing the high amplitude fundamental mode Rayleigh waves, and the difference in arrival time of
Rayleigh waves at different periods, demonstrating the phenomenon of dispersion. Figure 4.8 shows
the depth sensitivity of Rayleigh waves at selected periods. These represent the Frechet derivatives
of the phase velocity of the fundamental Rayleigh mode with respect to the S velocity (Lebedev and
van der Hilst , 2008):
K() =
C()
, (4.16)
where  is the angular frequency, related to period as 2/, K() is the sensitivity kernel, C() is
the phase velocity of the fundamental Rayleigh mode, and  is the S velocity.
The recorded displacement is approximated with a Jordan-Wenzel-Kramera-Brillouin (JWKB) re-
sponse to a moment tensor source on an isotropic, spherically symmetric Earth model (Snieder and
Nolet , 1987):
u(r, ) = p(r)[(i)1M : E(rs)](8k sin)1/2exp i
, (4.17)
where p(r) is the complex polarization vector, r is the location vector, M is the moment tensor for
a point source at location rs, E(rs) is the source strain tensor, k is the wavenumber and  is the
epicentral distance.
64 Chapter 4. Broadband seismological methods of imaging crustal and upper mantle structure
Figure 4.8: The depth sensitivity functions of Rayleigh waves at selected periods, estimated using
the ak135 Earth model. These are the Frechet derivatives of the phase velocity of the fundamental
Rayleigh mode with respect to the S velocity (Lebedev and van der Hilst , 2008).
The vertical displacement seismogram recorded at a seismic station is shown in Figure 1.8, along
with its amplitude as a function of time and frequency, to emphasize the frequency range for which
fundamental mode Rayleigh waves can be used in the two-station method analysis. Strong scattering
influences the 0.6-0.1Hz frequency range (10-16 s period). The vertical seismograms recorded at pairs
of seismic stations from the same event with similar backazimuth, are cross-correlated and a frequency-
dependent Gaussian bandpass filter is applied to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and minimize noise
and interferences with scattered waves. A subsequent time-domain frequency-dependent Gaussian
filter, centered around the peak amplitude time is applied to attenuate the side lobe effects arising from
fundamental-mode interference with higher modes. The cross-correlation function is then transferred
to the frequency domain:
() = U(r)2|[(i)1M : E(rs)]|2(8k)1(sin1 sin2)(1/2)exp i[k(1 2)], (4.18)
where  is the cross-correlation function and U(r) is the real, radial eigenfunction of the polarization
vector. Its complex phase is used to estimate the frequency-dependent phase velocity, c() (see Meier
et al., 2004; Sato, 1955, for a comprehensive description of the method and related equations):

in the denominator of Equation 4.19 produces n dispersion curves (solid black lines). The dashed
black line represents the dispersion curve estimated from a synthetic Earth model.
c() =
(1 2)
arctan{[()]/[()]}+ 2n
, (4.19)
where 1 and 2 are the earthquake epicentral distances with respect to the locations of each of the
two seismic stations. n is an integer that emerges from the intrinsic ambiguity of the arctan function
in the denominator. The phase velocity unwrapping procedure thus consists in picking the dispersion
curve from a non-unique range of curves represented by a discrete solution space (Figure 4.9).
4.3.2 Seismic tomography
Each dispersion curve yields an average phase velocity along the inter-station path it was estimated
for, as a function of period. The total phase velocity anomaly Ci can be written as the integral of all
the local anomalies (C(, )) at each grid knot of latitude , longitude , along the corresponding
path i:
66 Chapter 4. Broadband seismological methods of imaging crustal and upper mantle structure
Ci(, ) =
Ki(, )C(, )dd, (4.20)
where index i refers to the path for which the anomaly is computed andKi(, ) is the depth sensitivity
kernel of the Rayleigh wave that regulates the weight of each gridpoint along the path (Lebedev and
van der Hilst , 2008). The dependence on  is implied.
For each period, the local phase velocity anomaly at each grid knot, C(, ), can be decomposed into
isotropic and anisotropic contributions, following a Fourier series expansion, in terms of the horizontal
wave-number azimuth  (Deschamps et al., 2008; Smith and Dahlen, 1973):
C() = Ciso +A2 cos(2) +B2 sin(2) +A4 cos(4) +B4 sin(4), (4.21)
where the latitude (), longitude () and period (2/) dependence is assumed. This equation de-
scribes the general azimuthal anisotropic dependence of the Rayleigh wave phase velocity in a slightly
anisotropic medium, which has often been employed in studies of seismic imaging (e.g. Debayle et al.,
2005; Maggi et al., 2006; Yao et al., 2010). The 2 and 4 anisotropic contributions are:
C2 = A2 cos(2) +B2 sin(2), (4.22a)
C4 = A4 cos(4) +B4 sin(4). (4.22b)
Equation 4.20 is then discretized and a linear system of equations (one equation for each path) is built
(Deschamps et al., 2008):
d = Gm, (4.23a)
dT = (C1...CN ), (4.23b)
mT = (Ciso,1...Ciso,M A2,1...A2,M B2,1...B2,MA4,1...A4,M B4,1...B4,M ), (4.23c)
where N is the number of paths obtained at each period and M is the number of grid knots.
The system of equations is then solved independently at each frequency, using an LSQR algorithm
4.3. Surface wave analysis 67
(Least Squares with QR factorization, Paige and Saunders, 1982), which does not provide a covariance
matrix that can be used to quantify uncertainties. However, the fit to data may be expressed as the
variance reduction of the model at each frequency/period, and resolution and leakage tests evaluate
further the inversions ability to recover seismic structure (Section 6.2.3).
The A and B terms can further be combined to estimate the amplitude () and the azimuth of the
fast S-wave polarization (), for both 2 and 4 contributions (Equations 4.24a to 4.24b). These are
useful to visualize the anisotropy patterns across the model (Figure 4.10).

The importance of anisotropy
Previous studies noted the importance of accounting for anisotropy in inverting and interpreting
seismic data (e.g. Darbyshire and Lebedev , 2009; Deschamps et al., 2008; Forsyth, 1973; Hess, 1964).
To assess how much the solution deteriorates if anisotropy is neglected, the variance reduction of the
inverted models was calculated at all periods with 1) a purely isotropic inversion, 2) an inversion that
includes isotropic heterogeneity and 2 anisotropic variation, and 3) the full inversion which allows
for isotropic variations as well as 2 and 4 anisotropy. Figure 4.11 shows that the data fit decreases
up to 25% when a purely isotropic solution is forced on the inversion versus a full solution. The
phase velocity patterns are qualitatively similar if the inversion is set to calculate only the isotropic
component (Figure 4.12). However, the magnitude of the isotropic Vs anomaly estimated by an
isotropic-only inversion may increase or decrease up to 2% in areas where the anisotropy estimated
by the full inversion is 2% or at the model edges, where path coverage and cross-cutting is poor.
The velocity heterogeneity can thus be overestimated, leading to biased interpretations.
Anisotropic olivine crystals in the mantle are thought to have only a small 4 signal (Montagner
and Nataf , 1986), but the silica-rich nature of the continental crust (e.g. Christensen, 1996) means it
may have different anisotropic properties, rendering both the 2 and 4 anisotropy terms important
(e.g. Polat et al., 2012). Calculations of anisotropy for mineralogical and petrological upper mantle
models indicate that Rayleigh waves have weak 4 anisotropy dependence, as opposed to Love waves

(Montagner and Anderson, 1989; Montagner and Nataf , 1986). Spatial coherence between 2 and 4
terms in a study of the Hellenic subduction zone found weak directional changes in the 2 terms, if the
4 component is not accounted for in the inversion (Endrun et al., 2011). They also found a correlation
between higher 4 anomalies and regions with poorer ray path coverage. My results, however, do not
show such a correlation (Figure 4.12), indicating that 4 terms are not simply an indication of fitted
noise or a numerical strategy to improve data fit in less-resolved model regions. The roughness of
this component, defined as the average difference between the value at each grid-knot and the nearest
neighbour values, is also found to increase at longer periods (Figure 4.11.b). Interpreting the 4
anisotropy from a physical point of view is not straightforward: I speculate tentatively that it may
be a combination of Rayleigh-Love wave coupling effects or more complex mineralogical anisotropy
systems developed locally. I therefore follow the practice of previous studies that calculate both 2
and 4 terms (e.g. Darbyshire and Lebedev , 2009; Deschamps et al., 2008; Fry et al., 2010; Polat
et al., 2012), but focus the interpretation solely on the isotropic and the 2 anomalies, in the context
of upper-mantle structure.
Chapter 5
Crustal structure of southeast Canada
imaged by receiver functions
The contents of this chapter are published in the form of an article in Journal of Geophysical Research,
Solid Earth (Petrescu et al., 2016).
5.1 Introduction
An early global compilation of wide-angle seismic data by Durrheim and Mooney (1991) suggested
that crustal properties in cratonic regions may be age dependent, with Archean (>2.5Ga) crust being
thinner than Proterozoic (2.5-0.5Ga) and Phanerozoic (<542Ma) terranes, owing to the lack of a
mafic underplate layer (Figure 1.4). Secular variation in Precambrian crustal structure, implying a
slow change in rheological and compositional properties with geological time, has long been debated
(e.g. Thompson et al., 2010; Tugume et al., 2013) and is important to understand the formation and
evolution of the crust because most continental crust worldwide formed during the Precambrian (e.g.
Goodwin, 1996).
Durrheim and Mooney (1991) proposed that the difference in thickness and composition between
Archean and Proterozoic crust reflects a temporal evolution in mantle temperature and, consequently,
its ability to generate mafic partial melts (Figure 1.4). While some passive and active seismic surveys
from other cratons (e.g. the Yilgarn and Pilbara cratons in Australia, Dharwar craton in India, Sao
Francisco in Brazil, Rae and Hearne in Canada) support this hypothesis (e.g. Durrheim and Mooney ,
1994; Thompson et al., 2010), the results from studies of others (Arabian Shield, Tanzania craton)
do not (e.g. Abbott et al., 2000; Al-Damegh et al., 2005; Tugume et al., 2013; Zandt and Ammon,
1995).
5.2. Data and method 73
To investigate the crustal properties of Precambrian terranes, whether there is a marked difference
between Archean and Proterozoic crustal properties and its implication in the context of early Earth
tectonic processes, I used teleseismic earthquake data recorded at broadband seismographs located in
eastern Canada and northernmost USA. Eastern Canada is a representative region of the Precambrian
eon, with surface geology spaning 3 billion years of tectonic history. Receiver functions of the
crust beneath individual seismic stations were estimated using an extended multitaper procedure and
stacked using the H- algorithm, providing point estimates of crustal thickness and bulk crustal Vp/Vs
ratio. Receiver functions were also processed using a novel Bayesian probabilistic inversion method,
to estimate shear wave velocity and discontinuity probability profiles of the crust beneath seismic
stations (see Chapter 4 for a more detailed discussion of these methods).
The Moho sharpness and topography of the Precambrian Canadian crust is an indicator of past
deformational events that affected the crust >1Ga ago. Archean terranes appear to be composed of
three to four layers and underlain by a relatively flat, shallow and seismically sharp Moho. Proterozoic
terranes exhibit more structural complexity, with more heterogenous and seismically faster crustal
layers, multiple discontinuities and Moho topography of up to 10 km over short distances (60 km).
Interpretations of these results are corroborated with measurements of Bouguer anomaly and surface
topography. Differences between Archean and Proterozoic crust reflect a secular variation pattern of
tectonic processes that operated in each eon. However, a clear distinction may be obscured by later
tectonic events: the possibility of subsequent Moho resetting mechanisms through mafic underplating
and partially fossilised orogenic roots are also discussed.
5.2 Data and method
5.2.1 Seismic networks
Data come from broadband seismograph stations with sampling frequencies of 40 or 100Hz, located
across southeast Canada (Figure 5.1). Earthquakes at epicentral distances >30 from the study
region, with moment magnitude >5.5, were recorded mostly between 2010 and 2013, although some
station data from as far back as 2005 are used (Appendix A). Freely available data were downloaded
from a range of permanent (Canadian National Seismograph Network, CNSN; and Lamont-Doherty
Cooperative Seismograph Network, LD) and temporary (PO: POLARIS: Eaton et al., 2005) and
USArray Transportable Array, TA) seismograph networks (Figure 5.1). However, after data quality

control and H- processing, results for 67 stations were accepted (Figure 4.1, Appendices A and
5.2.2 H- stacking and Bayesian inversion of receiver functions
Receiver functions were computed and reliable H   stacking results were obtained for 67 seismic
stations across eastern Canada (Appendix B). H stacking results were interpolated to obtain Moho
depth and Vp/Vs ratio maps of eastern Canada (Figure 5.2). Also, the shear velocity structure was
estimated using transdimensional Bayesian inversion beneath 15 seismic stations, on or close to the
QM-III transect (Appendix D).
The quasi-2D crustal model was used to investigate differences in crustal structure properties from
Archean to Proterozoic to Phanerozoic terranes in a region that is far enough from the Great Meteor
hotspot not to have been significantly modified by hotspot tectonism. Figure 5.3 shows three shear
wave velocity profiles and the associated probability of discontinuity for a representative station from
each of the three main tectonic provinces.

5.3 Results
5.3.1 Receiver functions in the Superior craton
Receiver functions computed for stations located within the Abitibi subprovince indicate very different
crustal structures. Figure 5.4 shows the receiver functions computed for three stations within Abitibi:
CHGQ, QM70 and VLDQ. Station CHGQ lies just NW of the Grenville Front, on the Archean Superior
side. QM70 lies just 30 km NW of CHGQ and VLDQ lies 300 km SW of CHGQ. All three stations
are located in areas with similar surface geology, dominated by ultramafic volcanic rocks. However, it
is evident from the receiver function series that the crustal structure beneath station CHGQ is more
complicated than the other two. The receiver functions show multiple arrivals before and after the
Ps phase, which could be an effect of densely stacked intra-crustal thrust sheets. On the other hand,
receiver functions for station QM70 (Figure 5.4) show excellent backazimuthal coherency and a sharp
Ps phase, with no evidence of strong intracrustal multiples. Receiver functions at station VLDQ
lack the ringing effect that dominates the data from CHGQ and the estimated Vs profile is strikingly
similar to that of WEMQ (Figure 5.3).
5.3.2 Moho depth and bulk crustal composition of eastern Canada
Receiver functions from 12 seismograph stations in the eastern Superior craton are dominated by
coherent, high signal to noise ratio arrivals (Figure 5.2 and Appendix C), where the Moho Ps converted
phase and its multiples can easily be identified. Moho depths obtained via the H stacking method
range between 34 and 38 km, with an average of 35.871.41 km, while Vp/Vs ratios vary between 1.70
and 1.78 with a mean value of 1.730.02. These means exclude one anomalous station, KAPO, located
in the intracratonic Kapuskasing Structural Zone (Figure 2.1), where a crustal thickness of 47 km is
measured. The anomalously thick crust at this location is consistent with seismic refraction surveys
(e.g. Boland and Ellis, 1989).
In the Grenville Province, receiver functions generally show more complexity, with less backazimuthal
coherency of the Ps and multiple phases than the Superior Province (Figure 5.2). H   results from
46 stations show a 35-45 km range of crustal thicknesses (mean of 40.852.54 km) and a 1.70-1.88
range of Vp/Vs ratios (mean of 1.760.03). Along the QM-III transect, the crust thickens significantly
(7 km) from the Superior to the Grenville Province: Superior station QM70, 50 km NW of the
Grenville Front, is underlain by a 34 km thick crust while at QM60, 80 km SE of the Front, a 41 km

Moho depth was estimated (Figures 5.5, 5.6).
Seismic recordings from the Appalachian province are noisy and exhibit a ringing pattern that may be
due to sharp intracrustal discontinuities or to oceanic noise; both reduce the reliability of the H  
stacking results. However, 10 stations clearly detect the Moho, with H in the 32-42 km depth range
(mean H = 36.933.80 km) and Vp/Vs values in the 1.71-1.87 range (mean of 1.750.05). High Vp/Vs
ratios are found across the St Lawrence rift system (also coincident with the Grenville-Appalachian
tectonic boundary): stations A64 on the Grenville side and A21 on the Appalachian side show Vp/Vs
ratios of 1.78 and 1.82, respectively.
5.3.3 Shear velocity structure and the Moho character
Shear wave velocity profiles were estimated from receiver function Bayesian inversion at 6 stations in
the Superior craton: WEMQ, QM90, QM80, NMSQ, VLDQ and CHGQ (Figure 5.3 and Appendix
D). Most probabilistic velocity-depth profiles show a relatively consistent low velocity upper crust
(2.5 km/s) underlain by a 3.3 km/s, 12 km thick, mid-crustal zone. Also, a 3.6 km/s lower
crust of 15-18 km thickness, overlies 4.4 km/s uppermost mantle (Figure 5.7). Posterior probability
distributions on discontinuities indicate a high probability of discontinuity at about 10 km beneath
most stations in the Superior, and most prominently beneath station QM90 (Figure 5.7). Station
WEMQ lies within the La Grande granite-greenstone subprovince and is underlain by a roughly 4
layered crust and a seismically sharp Moho, while station QM90, also located within La Grande,
does not exhibit the fourth lower crustal layer (Figure 5.7). In the context of these results, a sharp
Moho is defined as a shear velocity change from typical lower crustal values (3.6-3.8 km/s) to typical
upper mantle values (>4.3 km/s) over a depth range of <2 km. The sharp Moho also shows a narrow,
high-amplitude peak in the probability of discontinuity function. The Vs profile of station CHGQ
(Figure 5.7, Appendix D) shows a seismically faster (3.7 km/s) lower crust in a depth range between
25 and 38 km, with little evidence for discontinuities. The upper crust (<20 km depth) seems to have
a multilayered fabric, with 3-7 km thick layers. H stacking was unsuccessful on CHGQ due to this
structural complexity.
Shear wave velocity profiles estimated from Bayesian inversion of receiver functions at stations located
in the Grenville Province (QM60, DMCQ, QM50, LMQ, A61, A64 and G53A, Appendix D) consis-
tently show a 2.5 km/s, 10 km thick upper crust, overlying a 3.6 km/s mid-crustal layer roughly
between 10 and 20 km depth and a higher velocity (3.8 km/s) 20 km thick lower crust (Figure 5.7).

Figure 5.6: The topography of the crust-mantle boundary beneath southeast Canada, estimated with
H   stacking of receiver functions.
The Moho depth obtained from Bayesian inversion beneath station QM60 has the signature of a double
discontinuity. The two probability spikes at 39 and 43 km depth might indicate the top and bottom
of a 4 km subcrustal layer of velocities comparable to the upper mantle (4.2-4.5 km/s). The Moho
is more gradational in the middle of the province. It is relatively sharp beneath station DMCQ (Vs
transition from crustal to mantle velocities occurs over a range of 3 km) but is gradational beneath
QM50 (the Vs transition occurs over 10 km and with a low probability of discontinuity: Figure 5.7).
These stations are located within or nearby the voluminous Lac-St-Jean anorthosite massif (Figure
2.1). The Moho sharpens beneath stations A61, A64 and LMQ, located on the Proterozoic side of the
St Lawrence Valley: the transition from crustal Vs to mantle Vs occurs over a smaller depth interval
(1-2 km) and the discontinuity probability has a higher and narrower peak. The Moho depth estimates
of the Bayesian and H   methods are slightly offset (2-5 km difference). Both methods, however,
make assumptions about the medium that might introduce discrepancies: the H stacking technique
is dependent on an assumed average crustal P wave velocity; the probabilistic inversion assumes the
Vp/Vs ratio to be fixed and the medium to be isotropic.
Bayesian inversions computed for stations QM20 and QM30 (Appendix D), within the Dunnage and

upper crust, a 10 km, 3.6 km/s mid crust and a 15 km 3.9 km/s lower crust. The upper mantle is
relatively faster (4.6 km/s) than the adjacent Grenville (Figure 5.7). The probability of discontinu-
ity function peaks at 20 km depth. This intracrustal discontinuity might be the source of strong,
backazimuthally coherent energy observed on the receiver functions that arrives between the P and
the Ps phases (for example, station QM20 in Figure 5.2). The Moho character beneath these stations
also exhibits a double spike probability of discontinuity.
In contrast to the adjacent Iapetus and Rheic Ocean related terranes, the Avalon zone, sampled
by station QM10, appears relatively homogeneous, with the exception of a high probability of an
interface at 10 km depth, dividing a 3 km/s upper crust from a mid-to-lower crust with velocities
that progressively increase from 3.6 km/s to mantle-like speeds of 4.5 km/s, with a very gradational
crust-mantle transition (Figures 5.7 and 5.9).
5.4 Discussion
5.4.1 Comparison with previous studies
In the Superior craton, Moho depth increases from 34 to 36 km beneath Nemiscau, Opatica and La
Grande subprovinces and to 40 km in the southwestern Abitibi greenstone province (Figures 2.1
and 5.5). These observations match the structural interpretation of a LITHOPROBE line crossing
the Abitibi-Opatica border, located further southwest (Calvert et al., 1995) and the collinear gravity
modeling study of Telmat et al. (2000). Most of the crustal Vp/Vs and Moho depth estimates agree
with the H   stacking results of Postlethwaite et al. (2014), to within 0.03 and 3 km, respectively.
However, a lower Vp/Vs ratio was identified beneath stations VLDQ and KAPO and higher beneath
station MALO.
Sixty kilometres SE of the GF, Moho depth increases from 36-38 km to 41-44 km (Figure 5.5), consis-
tent with wide-angle LITHOPROBE surveys (e.g. Martignole and Calvert , 1996; White et al., 2000;
Winardhi and Mereu, 1997). Two receiver function profiles also image a sudden 10 km Moho de-
pression 50 km SE of the Grenville Front (Figure 3.3, Eaton et al., 2006; Rondenay et al., 2000a).
Increased thickness beneath sections of the failed Iapetan Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben is also noted
in a previous seismic survey that cross cuts the graben (Green et al., 1988). A gradational Moho be-
neath the Grenville Province, near the St Lawrence Rift System, was also detected in an ambient noise
crustal model (Kao et al., 2013), in which the thickness of the crust-mantle transition is prescribed
84 Chapter 5. Crustal structure of southeast Canada imaged by receiver functions
by the difference in depth where the Vs increases to 50% and 85% of typical crust to mantle velocity.
H   results from Postlethwaite et al. (2014) also agree with the estimates in this study, except for
stations PKRO, NATG, ICQ, A21 and A64, where the estimated Vp/Vs ratios in this study differ by
as much as 0.13.
In the Appalachians, an average crustal thickness of 40 km determined from seismic refraction in the
Avalon Zone in Newfoundland (Marillier et al., 1994) is greater than that estimated in this study
for the Avalonian crust beneath station QM10 (33 km). The average crustal thickness of Phanerozoic
terranes (36.933.80 km) found in this study is slightly lower than the results of Taylor et al. (1980),
although different regions exhibit strong Moho depth differences, from 32 to 42 km. Moho depth has
also been reported to increase from 36 km beneath Maine to 40 km beneath Vermont in the northern
US (Hughes and Luetgert , 1991). Along the QM-III transect, a general trend of crustal thinning
was observed towards the Atlantic. Eastward crustal thinning beneath the Appalachians has also
been noted before (e.g. Musacchio et al., 1997; Nelson, 1992), although Hall et al. (1998) pointed
out that the crust beneath the mobile Appalachian belts (30-37 km) is thinner than at its margins
(Newfoundland part of Avalon - up to 40 km). Other Vs models, based on P and S traveltimes and
Rayleigh wave group and phase velocity inversions (Taylor and Toksoz , 1982; Taylor et al., 1980),
suggest a thicker crust beneath the Appalachians (40 km) than the Grenville (37 km). The average
Vp/Vs obtained for the Appalachian province from H   stacking, 1.750.05, is similar to the global
average (1.768, Christensen, 1996), but is slightly higher than the value of 1.73 reported by Musacchio
et al. (1997) based on refraction seismics in the southern Appalachian region (Vermont and Maine).
The shear velocity structure has some similarities with the Appalachian crustal model of Taylor and
Toksoz (1982), who also noted an increase in shear wave velocity between the southern Grenville and
the Appalachians. In an ambient noise crustal model, Kao et al. (2013) detected a sharp discontinuity
at 20 km, similar to the Appalachian shear wave velocity profiles (Figure 5.7).
5.4.2 Secular variation of crustal structure
Bulk crustal properties presented in Figure 5.8 correlate with tectonic province age (defined as the time
elapsed since the last tectonothermal event). The average H   results obtained for stations located
within the Proterozoic Grenville terranes (40.852.54 km and 1.760.03, respectively) are higher than
the values obtained for the Archean Superior craton (35.871.41 km, 1.730.02) and slightly higher
than the Phanerozoic Appalachians (36.933.8 km, 1.750.05). Laboratory experiments of shear

and compressional wave velocities on rocks of different compositions (e.g. Christensen, 1996) suggest
that increasing Poissons ratios reflect a decreasing content in SiO2, since the Poisson ratio of quartz
bearing rocks is lower than that of other rocks containing major crustal minerals including feldspar
and pyroxene, such as for example andesite and basalt (Figure 4.5). In view of these experiments,
the bulk crustal results suggest that Archean crust is on average thinner and more felsic than either
Proterozoic or Phanerozoic crust. Elevated Vp/Vs ratios could reflect higher grade metamorphic rocks,
like amphibolitic rocks and high-grade metapelites (e.g. Musacchio and Mooney , 2002, and references
therein). Moreover there are age-correlated differences in the seismic structure obtained through
Bayesian inversion. While Archean crust displays a 3-4 layered structure with shear velocity ranging
from 2 to 3.6 km/s, Proterozoic terranes show a higher degree of lateral crustal heterogeneity, and
a higher shear velocity, 20 km thick lower crust (3.8-4 km/s). Sub-Moho shear velocity is in the 4.4-
4.7 km/s range beneath this region (Figure 5.7).
Patterns of secular variation of thin and predominantly felsic Archean versus thick and more mafic
86 Chapter 5. Crustal structure of southeast Canada imaged by receiver functions
Proterozoic crust have been noted before by Durrheim and Mooney (1991), based on global com-
pilations of seismic refraction data. According to their hypothesis, hotter Archean lithosphere led
to pervasive komatiitic magma eruption, which left an ultra-depleted buoyant lithosphere beneath a
relatively thin crust (35 km). In contrast, more fertile mantle beneath the nascent Proterozoic crust
subsequently partially melted, causing mafic underplating that increased the thickness of the crust to
40 km and added mafic minerals to it. My results are generally consistent with this hypothesis. How-
ever, some global studies of Precambrian regions (Rudnick and Fountain, 1995; Zandt and Ammon,
1995) and teleseismic analysis in South African cratons (Tugume et al., 2012, 2013) and the Arabian
Shield (Al-Damegh et al., 2005) argue against the Durrheim and Mooney (1991) theory, finding no
significant differences in the crustal structure between Archean and Proterozoic crust. On the other
hand, tectonic-age correlation has been observed in the Rae and Hearne cratons in Northern Canada
(Thompson et al., 2010), the Sao Francisco craton in Brazil (Assumpcao et al., 2002), the Dharwar
craton in India (Ravi Kumar et al., 2001) and the Yilgarn craton and adjacent Proterozoic belts in
Australia (Clitheroe et al., 2000). The resolution of this issue may hinge on the distinction between
the age of the crust and the age of the orogenic event. Furthermore, the issue is obfuscated by the
likelihood that portions of Proterozoic crust, in northeastern North America as well as elsewhere, are
underlain by Archean crust at depth.
Minor correlations between geological age and bulk crustal properties occur within the Superior craton,
along the QM-III network. Moho depth increases from 34 to 36 km beneath Nemiscau, Opatica and La
Grande subprovinces and to 40 km in the southwestern Abitibi greenstone province (Figures 2.1 and
5.5), which is 100-200Ma younger than the provinces to the N-NW. The lack of large scale Archean
Moho topography may imply a paleo-lithosphere too weak to support any localized thickened crustal
roots at the time, if any had been generated. Nevertheless, the correlation of crustal thickness with
the progressive south-to-north ageing could imply a decrease in crustal growth efficiency with geologic
age. Uniformitarian models of continental growth consider the Superior craton to have been assembled
via progressive accretions onto its edges (e.g. Hammer et al., 2010, and references therein). However,
many geophysical and geochemical data are inconsistent with subduction or arc accretion and support
plume or rift models (e.g. Bedard , 2006). Bedard and Harris (2014) suggested a stagnant lid model,
with continental drift but no subduction in the Archean. If these models are correct, the differences
in Moho depth observed in Figure 5.6 may reflect a sudden change in the mode of crustal formation
towards the end of the Archean, as contrasted to a progressive increase in crustal growth rates with
time.
5.4. Discussion 87
5.4.3 Phanerozoic structure: the role of Wilson cycles
Variations in crustal thickness appear along the Appalachian orogenic strike as well as towards the
Atlantic borderlands. On the basis of seismic studies, the Moho beneath the orogenic core has been
proposed to be shallower than that of the margins of the Appalachian Province (van Staal and Barr ,
2012, and references therein). My data, however do not show such a trend, although Moho depths
exhibit local variations on the order of 8 km. The velocity model and discontinuity structure of
Phanerozoic terranes (Figure 5.11) indicate a strong discontinuity at 20 km depth and a double-
discontinuity Moho character (hereafter referred to as a double Moho) within Dunnage and Gander,
domains related to the Iapetus and Rheic Oceans. The strong difference in seismic structure between
adjacent Phanerozoic domains is consistent with the diverse nature of the tectonic domains that
assembled the Appalachian province.
Nelson (1992) argued that the crust of the Appalachian province was thin prior to the onset of
Atlantic ocean opening and that lithospheric scale delamination was responsible for the thinning of
the central orogen. Other models envisaged lower crustal eclogitization of the mafic material and large
scale partial melting with a resitite layer posing as upper mantle material, rather than lithospheric
reworking (Cook et al., 2010; van der Velden et al., 2004). However, this process would decrease
the impedance contrast between the lower crust and upper mantle. In contrast, the double Moho
character and high Vp/Vs ratios (Figure 5.9) indicate a predominantly mafic crust underlain by a layer
with sharp top and bottom interfaces. This geophysical signature could be associated with structural
emplacement of oceanic rocks beneath older continental crust (Cook et al., 2010). The Appalachians
record events from the closure of two oceanic tracts, the collision with Avalonia and Africa and the
opening of the Atlantic ocean on the same general axial trend. These important tectonic events likely
had an impact on the internal architecture of this now eroded orogenic province.
5.4.4 Precambrian crustal properties: original or reset signatures?
The assertion that bulk crustal properties are unequivocal evidence for a change in tectonic processes
over time might be too simplistic. Seismic signatures of the original crustal growth mechanism may
have been reset by subsequent tectonism, such as mantle plume-plate interaction or rift related mag-
matism. For example, multiple dyke swarms of different ages pervade the Superior craton. Dyke
complexes record magmatic pulses at 2.5, 2.2 and 2.1Ga that are linked with many episodes of exten-

sion at the paleocratonic margins of Laurentia (Ernst and Bleeker , 2010).
No indication of recent tectonism has been detected within the subprovinces La Grande, Nemiscau
and the metaplutonic Opatica. For example, Clowes et al. (1998) postulates that the lower crust of
the Opatica has been preserved since its juxtaposition with Abitibi 2.7Ga ago. The contemporary
Moho beneath these regions (stations WEMQ, QM90, NMSQ, QM80, QM70) may be the original
undisturbed Archean Moho, and therefore a product of Archean tectonics.
The receiver functions and crustal structure at station VLDQ in the Abitibi subprovince are very
similar to those at station WEMQ in the La Grande subprovince (Figure 5.3). Both Abitibi and
La Grande are typical granite-greenstone subprovinces and may have been formed in similar tectonic
settings. Bedard and Harris (2014) suggested that Superior subprovinces are not exotic, but once
belonged to the same continent that broke into smaller continental ribbons, subsequently reaccreted
to the Superior proto-craton. The observation of similar crustal structure between parts of Abitibi and
La Grande may be evidence that these subprovinces once belonged to the same supercraton.
Crustal structure within the granite greenstone Abitibi subprovince is highly variable. The striking
change in character of the receiver functions between CHGQ and QM70 (Figure 5.4) occurs over a
distance of <30 km. The seismic structure beneath CHGQ is also significantly different from station
VLDQ, located 300 km SW, also within Abitibi. A vertically heterogenous, 20 km thick upper crust,
with many internal interfaces, overlies a fast homogeneous lower crust beneath CHGQ. It could rep-
resent stacked volcanic sequences, erupted on top of a now buried homogeneous Archean basement.
The CHGQ structure might be evidence for intense magmatic activity at the cratonic margin, which
is the locus for several attempted rifting episodes (Ernst and Bleeker , 2010) and pre-existing zones of
weakness , reactivated during multiple Wilson cycles (e.g. Martignole and Calvert , 1996).
The Moho beneath stations in the metasedimentary Nemiscau and metaplutonic Opatica domains is
a gradational boundary, in contrast to the sharp Moho of the Abitibi and La Grande domains. Low
impedance contrast at the base of the crust could be caused by magmatic underplating or lower-crustal
metamorphic reactions, arising from crustal formation and/or modification. Both plate boundary
processes (e.g. Calvert et al., 1995) and plume activity (e.g. Benn and Moyen, 2008) could give rise
to a gradational crust-mantle transition.
Some intracratonic regions may have experienced modification, providing unreliable links with early
Archean mechanisms. The Kapuskasing Structural Zone, a 1.9Ga intracratonic uplift region in south-
90 Chapter 5. Crustal structure of southeast Canada imaged by receiver functions
western Abitibi (Figure 2.1), is underlain by exceptionally thick crust (47 km at station KAPO - not
shown on crustal thickness map), compared to the surrounding Archean terranes. This estimate is
consistent with results from wide-angle seismics (45-59 km; Boland and Ellis, 1989) and inferences
based on metamorphic grade (Percival and West , 1994). Studies performed on the deep crust exposed
in the Kapuskasing Structural Zone indicate a lower crust that was subject to complex deformation
and recrystallization during 2.7-2.4Ga (Percival et al., 1994). Lower crustal xenoliths exposed in
kimberlite pipes in Abitibi indicate zircon overgrowths during a 2.5Ga period of widespread exten-
sional magmatism associated with the Matachewan Ocean opening (Moser and Heaman, 1997), but
no evidence of lower crustal modification is found due to subsequent tectonic events such as the 1.1Ga
Mid-continental rift. This local increase in crustal thickness within the Archean could be supported
by a lithosphere that had already been stabilized, acquiring sufficient strength by 1.9Ga to withstand
tectonic modification.
The North American continent also drifted over the Great Meteor hotspot 160-90Ma ago. The track
appears to follow the strike of the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben, a failed rift associated with the opening
of the Iapetus Ocean. The crust is up to 44 km thick beneath the graben and Vp/Vs exceeds the high
value of 1.8 (green to blue colour scale in Figure 5.5), indicating a high mafic content. Receiver
functions at stations near the graben are complex, possibly due to reverberations within a thick
sedimentary layer or from multiple Ps arrivals from a complex Moho.. The high Vp/Vs values and
complex Moho are consistent with the injection of mafic material at the base of the crust during
lithosphere-hotspot interaction. Weakened lithosphere associated with the failed Iapetan rift may have
provided a path for hotspot magmatism in this region. Tomographic studies of the eastern Canadian
lithosphere (e.g. Frederiksen et al., 2007; Villemaire et al., 2012) image a low-velocity corridor in
the upper mantle that correlates spatially with the Great Meteor hotspot track at the surface, also
consistent with the injection of hotspot magmatic material into the lithosphere. The crustal thickness
variations observed in this region may represent a reset tectonic signature rather than an original
crustal feature.
5.4.5 Moho topography at the cratonic margin - relict Archean subduction?
Moho depth increases to 41-44 km sixty kilometres SE of the GF (Figure 5.5). LITHOPROBE seismic
profiles image the GF as a low dip thrust system, implying that Archean basement extends beneath
the Grenville province for up to 250 km (White et al., 2000) and that structures beneath the GF
5.4. Discussion 91
would be Archean.
The significant and sudden Moho depth increase SE away from the GF (Figure 3.3) was interpreted
by Rondenay et al. (2000a) as a relict continental-type subduction zone of Archean age, related to a
long-lived Andean style subduction which dominated the Laurentian margin between 1.71 and 1.23Ga
(Rivers, 1997). This frozen-in feature was assumed to have provided a pre-existing lithospheric scale
zone of weakness, reactivated during the Grenville orogeny. My data show that the increase in Moho
depth is not systematic along the full extent of the Grenville Province (Figure 5.6). In the southwest,
in the region crossed by the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben and the Great Meteor hotspot track, crustal
thickness increases from 34 to 44 km. Further northeast, along the QM-III transect, it only increases to
41 km. Other objections to the arc explanation include: the foreland arc magmatism southwest of the
Great Lakes associated with pre-Grenvillian Andean subduction (Rivers and Corrigan, 2000) does not
appear systematic along the full extent of the PB (Rondenay et al., 2000a), and the Bouguer gravity
anomaly does not appear to have a consistent subduction-like signature along the PB (Figure 5.10).
The lack of continuity of along-strike Moho character, foreland arc magmatism and subduction-like
gravity signatures point to a non-plate tectonic origin for this feature. Locally, the crust could have
thickened, and its Vp/Vs ratio raised, by the accumulation of magmatic material associated with the
Great Meteor hotspot at the cratonic edge.
5.4.6 Fossil mountain roots and isostatic mantle support
Neither the Bouguer gravity anomaly nor the surface elevation correlate with the Moho topography
along the Parautochthonous Belt (Figure 5.10). Thick crust ( 44 km) in the SW PB ( 47W,79N)
coincides with a negative Bouguer anomaly of about -60mGal and Vp/Vs between 1.71 and 1.73. The
thinner (41 km) and more mafic (Vp/Vs1.76) crust beneath the QM70-QM60-DMCQ section of the
QM-III transect coincides with the more negative Bouguer anomaly of -84 mGal, whereas isostasy
would predict a more positive anomaly (Figure 5.9).
Metamorphic reactions that cause the crustal root to lose buoyancy have been proposed to explain the
contrast between low surface elevation (350m height) and thick crust (e.g. Fischer , 2002). Partial
eclogitization has been invoked as a mechanism of preserving the mountain root of the Ural mountains
and the Trans-Hudson Orogen, arresting orogenic collapse (Leech, 2001). This process requires a fluid-
deficient regime to prevent the full eclogitization and delamination of the lower crust. Eclogites are
seismically indistinguishable from upper mantle material (Manghnani et al., 1974) and can decrease

the sharpness of the seismological Moho (Leech, 2001). My seismic models, however, show a relatively
sharp Moho beneath station DMCQ and a double Moho beneath station QM60 (both located in the
Grenville Province, Figure 5.9), which argues against the role of eclogitization in this part of the
orogen.
The crust beneath QM60 has a higher velocity (3.8-4.0 km/s) lower crust than adjacent Archean ter-
ranes. To the SW of the QM-III transect, the Vs and Vp of the lower crust derived from refraction
seismics (Winardhi and Mereu, 1997) are in the range of 3.75-4.0 km/s and 6.8-7.2 km/s, respectively.

are typically in the range of 6.2-6.4 km/s (e.g. Ruppert and Zandt , 1998). This dissimilarity might indi-
cate that this part of the Proterozoic lithosphere did not experience delamination. However, evidence
for post-thickening extensional collapse in some segments of the Grenville Province (Martignole and
Calvert , 1996), has been used to argue that the interior portion of the Grenville Province was part of
a large, hot and long lived high plateau, like modern Tibet, which progressively collapsed, before the
second orogenic pulse in which the orogen advanced into its former foreland (Rivers, 2009). Heatflow
values are low on average, ranging between 25 and 40mW/m2 (Jaupart et al., 2014; Levy et al., 2010).
In the partial eclogitization model of Leech (2001), low heatflow values and non-delaminated crust are
characteristics of arrested orogens with partially eclogitized roots.
In the southwest section of the GF, sub-crustal reflectivity patterns from a reflection seismic profile
(Mereu, 2000) have been associated with eclogitized lower crust that preserves lamination patterns
beneath the Moho (Eaton, 2006). A partially eclogitized layer would have a positive gravity anomaly
effect, since mafic material is dense. Assuming an infinite slab above a reference datum placed at
the crust-mantle boundary, a 35 km thick crust of average density =2800 kg/m3 with a 5-10 km thick
basal layer =3100 kg/m3 above 3300 kg/m3 mantle would yield a Bouguer anomaly of -49 to -55mGal
with respect to a 40 km thick crust. This value is 30-35mGal higher than that observed beneath the
QM-III transect (-85mGal), in the PB and parts of the APT, where the crust is 40 km thick (Figure
5.10). An eclogite layer at the base of the crust would thus result in a smaller negative anomaly than
that observed beneath the QM-III transect. However, we cannot preclude the possibility that the
gravity effect of a deep, higher density material such as eclogite, may be reduced, if the structure is
laterally limited. More complex thermochemical modeling and gravitational sensitivity analysis may
be required to evaluate the petrological relevance of each density model and the associated isostatic

implication (e.g. Hetenyi et al., 2007).
Overall, the crustal seismic structure beneath the Grenville along this section of the QM-III transect,
sharp to double Moho, high velocity thick lower crust (20 km) correlated with a region of highly
negative Bouguer gravity anomaly, is not consistent with an eclogitic lower crust, implying that mantle
structure is the primary buoyant support for isostatically imbalanced crustal roots. The extent and
age of cratonic lithosphere beneath the Grenville Province is not yet established, although some studies
point towards an Archean subcontinental mantle beneath parts of the Grenville crust, particularly in
the northwest. Tomographic models of North America (e.g. Bedle and van der Lee, 2009; Schaeffer
and Lebedev , 2014) image a fast cratonic root up to the Grenville-Appalachian boundary, implying
that the lithosphere beneath parts of the Grenville is likely of Precambrian age. A strong cratonic
subcontinental mantle is a better candidate for support of crustal roots beneath the Proterozoic
domains.
5.4.7 Precambrian gravitational collapse
Geological evidence points to a complex tectonic history of collision and orogenic collapse within the
Grenville Province. Rivers (2008, 2009) propose that part of the GP was a high elevation long duration
orogenic plateau, similar to modern Tibet. The collapse model represents the final stages of a cyclic
orogenic process in which lithospheric delamination triggers an abrupt increase in topography, and
hence gravitational potential. This uplift is followed by thermal weakening of the mid and lower crustal
segments and subsequent plateau collapse by outward radial flow over a timescale of tens of Ma. In
the collapse model of Rivers (2012) the final rheological structure of the collapsed orogen comprises
an uppermost crust that escaped the effects of metamorphism, with radially distributed normal sense
shear zones, an upper crustal region with subvertical structures and a decoupled weak mid-lower crust
that experienced subhorizontal extension in a channel flow regime. Moreover, orogenic collapse results
in juxtaposition of dry (granulite-facies) mid to lower crust with hydrous (amphibolite-facies and
locally greenschist-facies) upper crust (Rivers, 2012). These processes could leave a distinct seismic
signature in the impedance structure of the mid-crust.
My inferred shear velocity structures beneath stations across the Grenville Province (Figure 5.12) are
consistent with this layered structure (10 km uppermost crust, 5-10 km upper crust, high wave speed
20 km mid-lower crust). The probability of discontinuity is high at 10 and 20 km depth, perhaps rep-
resenting the petrological and rheological decoupling between the low grade metamorphic uppermost,

hydrous amphibolite facies upper, and potentially dry granulitic mid-lower crust. Channel flow of
mid-lower crust may have a smoothing effect on the crust-mantle boundary, increasing its seismic
sharpness. Shear velocity structures within the Grenville Province (Figures 5.11, 5.12) indicate strong
impedance contrasts at 20 and 40 km depth, with relatively high probability of discontinuity at the
Moho (except for stations located within anorthosite massif areas), suggesting sharp interfaces that
could be interpreted as the sheared top and bottom of an extensional mid-lower crustal channel. Pre-
vious magnetotelluric studies in the southwestern Grenville Province (Adetunji et al., 2014) observed
an increase in conductivity in the lower crust beneath an area considered part of the Orogenic Lid
(Rivers, 2012). Seismic profiles collinear with the MT studies (White et al., 2000) indicate the presence
of southeast dipping features rooting into a lower crustal decollement, supporting the lower crustal
channel flow hypothesis.
5.4.8 Mafic underplating, anorthosites and their implications for Proterozoic crustal
growth
The principal issues surfacing in petrological and geochemical discussions of the origin of AMCG
(anorthosite-mangerite-charnockite-granite/gabbro) complexes involve the amount of crustal material
in the fractionating mafic magmas that give rise to the anorthosite (Duchesne et al., 1999). Two schools
favour different amounts of crustal involvement based on geochemical and isotopic constraints and the
time taken for fractionation and emplacement (Ashwal , 1993; Bedard , 2010; Bybee et al., 2014; Emslie,
1985). The generation mechanism of AMCG complexes is still debated. Early theories of generation
for such widespread geochemically unique magmatism focused on anorogenic sources, such as rifting,
mantle plumes (Morse et al., 1988) and thermally insulated mantle superswells (e.g. Hoffman, 1989b;
Vigneresse, 2005). Later work invoked plate-tectonic processes such as lithospheric delamination
(e.g. Corrigan and Hanmer , 1997) and crustal imbrication (Duchesne et al., 1999). Durrheim and
Mooney (1991) suggested that massive partial melts, derived from a Proterozoic mantle that was
more fertile and cooler than the hot Archean mantle, ponded beneath the lower crust, providing the
mantle source for Proterozoic anorthosites. Mafic underplating would result in a gradational Moho
and a high-velocity lower crust, consistent with the Moho character estimated beneath station QM50.
Bybee et al. (2014) suggested the emplacement of the anorthosite components of AMCG complexes
at mid-crustal levels may have occured 100Ma after formation at the base of the crust and have
associated this event with Andean-style tectonics, which dominated the Laurentian margin for a period
of 500Ma, from 1.71 to 1.23Ga (Rivers, 1997). However, AMCG complexes younger than this age
98 Chapter 5. Crustal structure of southeast Canada imaged by receiver functions
are known in the GP (Corrigan and Hanmer , 1997) and the global distribution and restriction to
the Proterozoic (absence of anorthosites from the Phanerozoic or Archean geological records) points
towards a less conventional tectonic process (e.g. Bedard , 2010).
The widest anorthosite massif in the Grenville Province, Lac St-Jean, is traversed by the QM-III
network and sampled by stations QM50 and DMCQ. A large part of the Lac-St-Jean anorthosite
massif occurs within a highly negative Bouguer anomaly (about -70mGal) whose strength decreases
abruptly to -30mGal to the SE (Figures 5.9 and 5.10). The anomaly was tentatively interpreted to
reflect the presence of intrusive igneous rocks, an undefined lower crustal batholith or the continuation
of Archean rocks beneath Grenville allochthons (Dufrechou and Harris, 2013). LITHOPROBE seismic
profiles in the southwest (White et al., 2000) indicate that Archean basement extends as far as 250 km
eastward beneath the southwest Grenville Province, although its extent is more restricted further
northeast ( 100 km) (Martignole et al., 2000). Thus lower crust extension of Archean rocks as far as
the location of station QM50 (350 km SE of the Front) is improbable. The gradational Moho can
be explained by Proterozoic mafic underplating, which subsequently segregated into the feldspar-rich
anorthosite massifs and their gabbroic residue, which forms the dense and high velocity lower crust
and causes the Bouguer gravity anomaly. Evidence for ultramafic cumulates may be absent because
these rocks have sunk into the mantle. Alternatively, the lower crust may constitute the crustal restite
after formation of the MCG components of AMCG complexes, which is often of crustal, not upper
mantle, affinity.
5.5 Conclusion
H results display an age-dependent trend and suggest that the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic crust is,
on average, thicker and more mafic than the adjacent Archean domains. Proterozoic and Phanerozoic
terranes are also seismically faster and more heterogeneous than the adjacent Archean domains. The
lower crust beneath the Grenville Province and the Appalachians is higher velocity (3.8-4.0 km/s) than
beneath the Superior craton. This secular variation pattern occurs in Precambrian terranes in other
continents and agrees with the theory that mafic underplating may have been an especially important
mechanism for crustal growth during the Proterozoic.
A 5-10 km increase in Moho depth is observed about 50-60 km away from the Archean-Proterozoic
boundary, beneath the Grenville Province, suggesting Archean basement partially extends beneath
5.5. Conclusion 99
the province. The Moho does not, however, systematically increase in depth along the strike of the
orogen. Previous interpretations of this feature include a fossilized Archean slab. My results, however,
point to a rather localized accumulation of magmatic material at the edge of the craton related to the
Great Meteor hotspot.
Lack of isostatic balance inferred from the lack of correlation between topography and crustal thickness
of the Proterozoic belt indicates that a strong mantle provides the necessary suport for the relatively
thick crustal roots and that these may have experienced partial eclogitization, inhibiting the full
orogenic cycle.
The crust-mantle boundary is gradational and the bulk crustal Vp/Vs ratio is high beneath areas
pervaded by voluminous anorthosite intrusions, a predominantly Proterozoic igneous rock that forms
up to 20% of the Grenville Province. Mafic magmatic underplating may have been an important
process in the Proterozoic, providing the necessary mantle source for these intrusions and could have
been responsible for crustal growth in a vertical sense.

Lithospheric structure from surface
wave tomography
The contents of this chapter are published in the form of an article in Journal of Geophysical Research,
Solid Earth (Petrescu et al., 2017).
6.1 Introduction
The deep structure of cratons worldwide has been analyzed using a range of seismic imaging methods
and through kimberlite-borne mantle xenoliths. Broadband seismology studies detected multiple intra-
lithospheric seismic discontinuities (e.g. Abt et al., 2010; Romanowicz , 2009; Wirth and Long , 2014)
that may represent the bottom of the chemically-depleted layers and younger cratonic roots. Mantle
xenoliths in some cratons (e.g. the Slave craton in NW Canada and the North Atlantic craton in
Greenland, Bizzarro and Stevenson, 2003; Griffin et al., 1999; Kopylova and Russell , 2000) record
compositional stratification, although this is not evident in other cratons such as the Siberian or the
Kaapvaal cratons (e.g. Boyd et al., 1997). The existence of multiple anisotropic layers has also been
reported, with a change from lithospheric fabrics to present-day mantle flow beneath several stable
continental regions e.g. North America (Darbyshire and Lebedev , 2009; Yuan and Romanowicz , 2010),
South Africa (e.g. Adam and Lebedev , 2012), northern Europe (e.g. Plomerova and Babuska, 2010)
and Australia (e.g. Fichtner et al., 2010).
The nature of cratonic keels, the time and mechanism of formation, the 3D extent and internal fabrics
of their anomalously fast and thick lithospheric roots are debated. The fast seismic velocity generally
used to diagnose cratonic material was associated with chemical depletion of Fe with respect to Mg (e.g.
Jordan, 1988), although such a composition may be insufficient to account for the observed seismic

anomalies (e.g. Afonso et al., 2008) and to match the isostatically predicted high topography (e.g.
Eaton and Perry , 2013). Internal discontinuities such as the mid-lithospheric discontinuity (MLD)
and their origin have been associated with an increase in mantle fertility (e.g. Yuan and Romanowicz ,
2010), internal shearing (e.g. Levin and Park , 2000), plume underplating (e.g. Griffin et al., 1999) or
the top of subcreted slabs (e.g. Miller and Eaton, 2010). Imaging the internal structure and lateral
extent of cratonic mantle, and its transition to modern mantle, is thus central to understanding the
evolution of the mantle through time and its resistance to subsequent modification. Whether or not
Archean mantle extends beneath surrounding terranes or not is important, for example, for models of
crustal growth rates and recycling (e.g. Griffin et al., 2009).
To investigate the Precambrian mantle structure, earthquake data were used to construct a seismic
tomographic image of the eastern Canadian landmass. Using the dispersion properties of surface waves,
the variation of isotropic and anisotropic components of the Rayleigh wave phase velocity (Deschamps
et al., 2008) was estimated between 20 and 220 s, broadly sensitive to depths of 30-350 km. Variations
in phase velocity were used to infer the extent and relative thickness of the cratonic mantle beneath
the Archean and Proterozoic terranes. Measurements of seismic anisotropy allowed the detection of
fabrics from episodes of tectonic deformation and lithospheric growth of cratonic keels during the
Precambrian. The results provided evidence for the multistage mechanisms that participated in the
formation and evolution through space and time of a layered cratonic mantle.
6.2 Data and methods
6.2.1 Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion
Rayleigh waves travel with phase velocities that are frequency-dependent and are a powerful tool
to study upper mantle structure. By cross-correlating surface waveforms simultaneously recorded at
pairs of seismic stations, it is possible to estimate the path-averaged Rayleigh wave phase velocity
between them as a function of wave period (Meier et al., 2004).
Data from 3218 teleseismic earthquakes with Mw>5.5 which occurred worldwide between 2009 and
2014 (Figure 4.1) were recorded at 48 permanent and temporary broadband seismograph stations in
eastern Canada, Greenland, southern Baffin Island and northeast US (Figure 6.1). Data from stations
outside of the region of interest widens the aperture of the network, improving the resolution of the
model at the edges. Of 1128 possible station pairs, 500 simultaneously recorded earthquakes along

6.2. Data and methods 103
great-circle paths within 5 of the inter-station backazimuth and were thus usable for analysis.
The earthquake data were initially filtered between 0.05 and 0.03333Hz for visualisation and manual
quality control. The raw seismograms were cut 1000 s around the observed surface wave arrival
time and filtered with a third order, zero phase, bandpass Butterworth filter between 10 and 400 s,
to enhance the Rayleigh wave signal. The instrument response was removed and a synthetic CMG
3T seismograph instrument response was added. For each seismic station pair, recorded seismograms
with earthquake backazimuth similar to the inter-station direction within a 5 difference were cross-
correlated, following the procedure described in Section 4.3.1 (Meier et al., 2004).
The frequency-dependent phase velocity solution is non-unique (Figure 6.2g). The solution space
comprises a discrete set of dispersion curves, one for each value of n, a frequency-independent positive
integer introduced due to the intrinsic ambiguity of the arctan function. For each individual earth-
quake cross-correlation function (Figure 6.2e), the solution space is visually inspected and the portion
of the dispersion curve most similar to a theoretical global reference curve is manually selected (Figure
6.2g). The average of all the selected dispersion curves for each station pair is then calculated. Seismic
diffraction and fundamental mode Rayleigh wave interference with higher modes can introduce irreg-
ularities and roughness in the measured curve (e.g. Legendre et al., 2014). However, these effects are
frequency-dependent and are smoothed in the manual selection and averaging steps (Figures 6.2g,h).
The resulting dispersion curve is a path-averaged phase velocity variation of the Rayleigh waves sam-
pling the structures between the two stations. Using this method, 285 inter-station dispersion curves
were estimated (Figure 6.1) for the period range 20-220 s from 180,000 seismograms. The number
of curves accurately retrieved for each period varied between 189 and 276.
6.2.2 Measurement bias in the two-station method
Individual dispersion curves measured between pairs of seismic stations describe the average medium
properties between the two stations, which can be affected by the presence of strong lateral hetero-
geneity. Measuring the dispersion curves from multiple events from opposite directions enables the
detection of such heterogeneities and improves the measurement quality (Legendre et al., 2014). Lat-
erally heterogeneous media also generate seismic wave diffraction, introducing non-plane wave energy.
Surface wave diffraction arises from an inherently complex relationship between waves and hetero-
geneities (Pedersen, 2006) and is not taken into account by the method used here. This phenomenon
is manifested as irregularities in the dispersion curves (Figure 6.2). Between 10 and 250 measurements

were used for each station-pair (Figure 6.3) with seismic waves coming from opposite directions (Fig-
ure 6.2). These were sufficient to identify and exclude outlier dispersion curves, reducing the effects
of heterogeneity and diffraction (Lebedev et al., 2006; Meier et al., 2004), and resulting in smooth
dispersion curves (Figure 6.9).
Bias may arise from angular deviations of the surface wave propagation paths from their predicted
great-circle arc (Pedersen, 2006), with deviations of 20 possible (e.g. Cotte et al., 2000; Foster et al.,
2014). At short periods (20 s) great-circle arc deviations may be as high as 15 (Pedersen et al.,
2015). Foster et al. (2014) showed that the standard deviation of the distribution of great-circle arc
deviations decreases from 0.4 at short periods (20 s) to less than 0.1 at longer periods (100 s).
Pedersen (2006) estimated that phase velocities can be 0.5% different from the structural velocities
for a deviation of 10 and 2-2.5% for a deviation of 20. Meier et al. (2004) calculated that a deviation
of 15 amounts to a phase velocity increase by a factor of 1.035. To reduce the effect of great-circle
path deviations I imposed a 5 limit between the station-pair azimuth and the earthquake azimuth,
which should introduce an error <0.5% (Pedersen, 2006). Also, averaging over hundreds of dispersion
curves obtained from earthquake waves coming from opposite directions should significantly reduce
the impact on phase velocity from wrongly predicted arrival angles for a few events.
Lateral scattering strongly influences fundamental mode Rayleigh waves at periods 16 s (Meier et al.,
2004). The JWKB approximation used is insufficient to describe the complex wave propagation at
such short periods. This is reflected in the incoherent pattern observed in the spectrograms above
0.07Hz (Figure 6.2). For this reason short-period data were not used.
6.2.3 Phase velocity tomography
Inversion parametrisation and regularisation
The model was first parametrised with a triangular grid (Wang and Dahlen, 1995) with an approx-
imately constant interknot spacing of 40 km. The spacing was chosen to be sufficiently small for an
accurate integration of the Rayleigh wave sensitivity kernels, K(, ) (e.g. Lebedev and van der Hilst ,
2008). A larger triangular model grid was then constructed, with a 200 km interknot spacing similar
to the average interstation distance across the network. The obtained dispersion curves were com-
bined to estimate an average phase velocity C(, , ) at each latitude , longitude  and frequency
 knot.

6.2. Data and methods 107
As described in Section 4.3.2, C(, , ) can theoretically be related to five parameters that describe the
lithospheric structure (Ciso, A2, B2, A4 and B4) through a system of equations. The system was
solved numerically using the LSQR method (linear least squares QR algorithm: Paige and Saunders,
1982) with slight norm damping and lateral smoothing regularization. Damping penalizes the first
derivatives of the phase velocity anomaly distribution, with the effect of decreasing the amplitude of
the velocity anomaly. Lateral smoothing moderates the second spatial derivatives, spreading out local
anomaly peaks in the final velocity distribution (Darbyshire and Lebedev , 2009).
A common issue in the field of seismic tomography is the somewhat subjective choice of the damping
and smoothing parameters. While the inversion may be allowed to converge towards a best-fit model,
the output Earth model may not always be realistic. A trade-off emerges between the smoothness of
the model and its ability to fit the observed data, quantified by the variance reduction (Figures 6.4
and 6.5). Figure 6.4 shows an example of the trade-off curves that emerge for a combination of applied
smoothing and damping values on the isotropic component and variance reduction and roughness, for
the 50/,s period model. Increasing the applied smoothing decreases the fit to data and the roughness
of the model. The trade-off curves become similar for damping values higher than 0.05, which is the
preferred damping value for the isotropic component. Figure 6.5 shows how the isotropic phase velocity
distribution estimated at period 120 s varies with increasing isotropic smoothness parameter on the
trade-off curve, while damping was held constant. Generally, the chosen smoothness value lies at the
knee of the trade-off curve (Figure 6.6), although more factors come into play such as how geologically
realistic are the features and amplitudes of the velocity distribution and whether the wavelength of
the estimated features is within the model resolution. After inspecting a number of tomographic
models for a range of smoothing and damping values large enough to sample the trade-off curves in
each dimension (Figure 6.5), the following values were chosen for the isotropic and the two anisotropic
components, respectively: 0.05, 0.1, 0.1 for damping and 0.5, 0.7, 0.7 for smoothing, respectively.
The isotropic component was damped less than the anisotropic components because the isotropic
heterogeneity can be estimated with higher resolution (Darbyshire and Lebedev , 2009). Figure 4.11
shows that while the roughness increases with period, variance reduction decreases with period. A
higher smoothing value would decrease the model roughness at longer periods, but significantly affect
data fit. Also, applying a different smoothing value at each period produces vertically incoherent
features, by reducing and spreading the anomaly amplitudes in an inconsistent fashion and biasing
the interpretation.

Resolution and leakage tests
To estimate the resolution of the phase velocity distribution, pseudo-checkerboard models were built
(Figure 6.7), synthetic dispersion data were calculated, and the resulting dispersion curves were in-
verted to recover the synthetic model. The pseudo-checkerboard tests are constructed by setting the
velocity anomaly at model grid points to 2.4% and interpolating the values on the dense integration
grid. Since the model grid used in this kind of tomography is based on a triangular geometry, instead
of the classic Cartesian framework (e.g. Boyce et al., 2016; Nolet , 1993; van der Lee and Frederiksen,
2005a), the anomaly shapes in Figure 6.7 are in fact the closest to a standard checkerboard. This
type of synthetic test was successfully used in previous models (e.g. Darbyshire and Lebedev , 2009;
Deschamps et al., 2008; Legendre et al., 2014). The width of the negative anomalies tested ranges from
200-400 km. The 200 km wide anomalies were recovered only in the central and south-west parts of
the model (Figure 6.7). The 300 km anomalies were relatively well recovered throughout the model
space (within a 1% error), except in the extreme north and northeast of the region. The 400 km
anomaly features were well recovered except in the extreme northeast, southeast and southwest (Fig-
ure 6.7). A 0.5% increase in the recovered anomaly amplitude south of Hudson Bay is present at
the westernmost edge of the model (Figure 6.7).

Figure 6.7: Resolution tests for isotropic low velocity checkerboard anomalies at period 100 s. The
peak amplitude of the anomalies is 2.4%. The top row is the input model and the bottom row is
the recovered model.
Imperfect amplitude recovery may be due to poor resolution at the model edges, sparse interstation
path coverage and low degree of path cross-cutting, resulting in directional sampling bias. For this
reason, the edges of the model and the areas that were considered unreliable were masked and inter-
pretations focused on features that are within the resolution capability of the area. Smoothing was
also found to affect resolution by decreasing the peak amplitude and spatially spreading out anomaly
features in the distribution (e.g. Darbyshire and Lebedev , 2009). The number of paths (189-276),
directions and degree of cross-cutting vary slightly in the 30-220 s period range (Figure 6.3). Reso-
lution tests performed at longer periods provided similar solutions as for shorter periods (e.g. 100 s,
Figure 6.7), demonstrating that the change in path coverage/cross-cutting, the main control on the
resolution, does not impact significantly enough to justify an increase in smoothing/damping.
Numerical leakage between the inverted isotropic and anisotropic velocity components can introduce
false velocity anomalies during the inversion procedure. To explore the impact of such numerical arti-
facts, three separate resolution tests were performed, in which each component was inverted individu-
ally: 1) purely isotropic (to investigate leakage into anisotropy), 2) purely anisotropic (to investigate
112 Chapter 6. Lithospheric structure from surface wave tomography
leakage into isotropy), and 3) a combination that includes rotated anisotropy. Figure 6.8 shows the
recovery of these synthetic components and the kind of numerical artifacts that appeared on the other
components, at 100 s and 180 s period.
In all three cases, the magnitudes of falsely induced isotropic or anisotropic anomalies were similar
for the two periods. In the purely isotropic Earth model case, a mean anisotropy anomaly magnitude
of 0.3% was leaked into the 2 component, with some model edge regions exhibiting false anisotropy
anomalies up to 1% (northwestern area). Isotropic velocity patterns were well recovered with slightly
reduced amplitudes (-0.3%) in parts of the Superior craton at 100 s and increased values (+0.3%)
at 180 s. In the purely anisotropic Earth model case (either 2 or 4), there was little leakage into
the isotropic component (mean isotropic phase velocity leakage of 0.08%). The azimuthal anisotropy
amplitudes and directions were well recovered, with an average anomaly reduction of 0.2% and a
mean azimuthal deviation from the input values of 15, mainly resulting from differences at the
model edges. The third tests comprised inversions for an Earth model that comprises a combination
of both isotropic and anisotropic components at 100 s and 180 s period. The anisotropy directions were
rotated by 90, to test for bias in the azimuth of the estimated S-wave polarization. Figure 6.8 shows
that the rotated anisotropy directions were well recovered. Together, these resolution tests provide
further assurance that the inversion method as applied to the current dataset is able to generate
credible tomographic models without significantly distorting each component or inducing significant
numerical artifacts that could bias the interpretation.
6.3 Results
6.3.1 Average lithospheric structures inferred from dispersion curves
Dispersion curve measurements whose paths lie predominantly within the three main tectonic provinces
of eastern Canada (Figure 6.9) are compared to the synthetic ak135 Earth model (Kennett et al., 1995).
The paths sampling the average structure of the Superior craton show velocities significantly higher
than global values (up to 0.4 km/s faster) for a wide range of periods (30-140 s). The anomalous
region reduces beneath the Grenville Province, where dispersion curves tend to be more variable and
faster than the global average over a shorter bandwidth (40-100 s). The Appalachian velocities are
close to the global average, within 0.2 km/s difference. The dispersion curves that cross-cut the
three tectonic provinces show phase velocities up to 0.3 km/s higher than the global average across a

6.3.2 Anisotropic Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps
Figures 6.10 and 6.11 show the distribution of anisotropic Rayleigh wave phase velocities across eastern
Canada at periods between 20 s and 220 s, with respect to the regional average.
Three main period ranges that exhibit relatively consistent seismic features across each province were
identified: 20-140 s, 150-180 s, 190-220 s. The isotropic and anisotropic patterns within these ranges
and the main characteristics of each tectonic province are described in the following sections.
The Superior Craton
A regional scale fast versus low seismic contrast dominates the eastern Canadian crust and upper
mantle in the 20-140 s period range (Figures 6.10 and 6.11). The Superior craton is seismically fast
and relatively homogenous (1 to 2% phase velocity anomaly) as opposed to the Proterozoic (Grenville,
New Quebec and Torngat orogens), the Archean core of the Eastern Churchill Province and the
Phanerozoic Appalachian Province, where the regional phase velocity anomaly can be as low as -2.6%
(Figures 6.10 and 6.11). Phase velocity anomalies range between 0.5% near the Proterozoic border
between the Superior craton and the Grenville Province to 2.5% locally to the SE of Hudson Bay at
periods sampling mostly crustal and uppermost mantle depths (Figure 6.10). The local high velocity
maxima relocates towards the centre of the province at intermediate periods (60-100 s). The 20 s
map shows consistently similar isotropic velocity features with maps at periods of 35 s, and similar
anisotropy magnitude and directions in the Grenville Province.
Azimuthal anisotropy magnitude ranges between 0.5% and 1% in the 20-100 s period interval. Anisotropy
directions at short periods (20-40 s) are not distributed in a coherent fashion, although an interesting
pattern becomes increasingly evident in the 40-110 s period interval (peak depth sensitivity between
50 and 150 km, Figure 6.10): fast velocity axes gradually rotate from predominantly E-W in the south
to N-S in the northern Superior section.
In the 110-140 s period interval, surface waves mostly sensitive to 150-200 km depth range sample
upper mantle material that appears to be faster than the regional average (dC/C 1%) and more ho-
mogenous (the mean standard deviation of absolute phase velocity values is <25m/s). The anisotropy

dispersion curves computed from the ak135 Earth model. Transparent orange rectangles highlight the

directions are less coherent (Figure 6.11) and the mean anisotropy magnitude decreases by 0.5% (Fig-
ure 6.18a), indicating weakly anisotropic material beneath the province. The observed sudden drop in
anisotropy anomaly strength is higher than twice the mean standard deviation in the distribution of
anisotropy anomaly values estimated in the 110-140 s period interval in the Superior Province (0.1%,
Figure 6.18a), making it a robust feature of my model.
The 140-180 s period range (Figure 6.11) reveals a seismically heterogeneous (up to 3% seismic velocity
anomaly difference) and anisotropic (1.5%) mantle layer of the Superior craton (Figure 6.13). A
low velocity (-1%) NW-SE trending corridor develops in the central Superior, between two fast
velocity regions underlying the northern and southern craton sections. Anisotropy directions follow
the strike of the low wavespeed corridor and appear to fan away towards Hudson Bay, beneath the
fast wavespeed regions (Figure 6.11).
At periods greater than 180 s, the anisotropy amplitudes exhibit a significant increase, up to 3.5%
(Figures 6.12 and 6.13), and broadly orientate NW-SE beneath the central and northern Superior
sections and E-W beneath the southern Superior. A high wavespeed anomaly region (3%) dominates
the mantle beneath the central-northern Superior (Figure 6.11).
120 Chapter 6. Lithospheric structure from surface wave tomography
The Eastern Churchill Province
At periods lower than 50 s (Figure 6.10), the Eastern Churchill Province is characterised by negative
isotropic velocity anomalies varying between 0.5 and 1.5%. Anisotropy amplitude is about 1% and
varies slightly between N-S and NW-SE. Between 50 s and 80 s a positive velocity anomaly region
develops in the southeastern Eastern Churchill province, near the GF (Figure 6.10) and gradually
coalesces with the high positive Superior anomaly, to form an approximately E-W oriented fast mantle
corridor (100-300 km wide, 1%). The azimuthal anisotropy amplitudes are higher than average
(2%), directions follow the strike of the fast corridor and cross-cut the N-S trending Proterozoic
orogenies of the Eastern Churchill Province.
The Grenville Province
The Grenville Province is characterised by the transition from the positive seismic anomaly that
dominates the Archean Superior Province to its west to the negative anomaly that underlies the
Appalachian Province to its southeast (Figures 6.10 and 6.11). Wavespeed anomaly amplitudes vary
between -0.5% and -1.5%, although some positive anomalies as high as 1% extend up to 200 km
beyond the Grenville Front, especially in the region between the Ottawa Bonnechere Graben and
Lake Mistassini (Figures 2.1 and 6.10). The lowest anomaly amplitudes (2%) are located below the
eastern Grenville section, south of the Eastern Churchill Province (at periods 20 s-90 s), north of the
Great Lakes (140 s) and the region between Lake Mistassini and St Lawrence River (170 s).
Anisotropy amplitudes range between 0.2% and 1% and span a wide range of directions. At latitudes
lower than 50, the general E-W direction dominates up to 70 s, after which a more complex pattern
develops. Between 50 s and 80 s, in the eastern section, south of the Eastern Churchill Province
(Figure 2.1), the general anisotropy direction is NW-SE, parallel to the fast wavespeed corridor that
is prominent in this period range north of the GF (Figure 6.10).
The Appalachian Province
The Appalachian province is underlain by consistently low isotropic phase velocities with respect to
the regional average, varying between -1.5% and -3.5%.
The southern section of the Appalachian Province exhibits 1% SW-NE azimuthal anisotropy across
the entire period range (Figures 6.10, 6.11), except between 90-100 s, where polarity switches by 90.
6.4. Discussion 121
The northeastern sections of the Appalachian Province (The Gulf of St-Lawrence and provinces to
the SW of the Gulf, Figure 2.1) exhibit a gradual anticlockwise rotation of anisotropy direction from
N-S at 30 s to NE-SW at 130 s, where it stabilises.
6.4 Discussion
6.4.1 The heterogeneous mantle beneath Precambrian terranes
Comparison with previous studies
Most seismic models of eastern Canada come from global- (e.g. Debayle and Ricard , 2012; Lebedev
and van der Hilst , 2008; Nettles and Dziewonski , 2008; Ritsema et al., 2011; Schaeffer and Lebedev ,
2013) and continental-scale tomography (e.g. Bedle and van der Lee, 2009; Schaeffer and Lebedev ,
2014; van der Lee and Frederiksen, 2005a; Yuan et al., 2011). They generally image a large scale high-
velocity anomaly beneath Precambrian North America (Figure 6.14), similar to my model (Figures
6.10 and 6.11). However, the lateral extent of this anomaly, its amplitude and roughness are variable
across models due to their different inversion approaches, datasets or chosen regularizations. Most
importantly, the majority of seismic models (with the exception of the radially anisotropic model
of Nettles and Dziewonski (2008) and the radially and azimuthally anisotropic model of Yuan et al.
(2011)) estimate only the shear wave velocity, without taking into account the anisotropic component,
which can contaminate the isotropic solution.
The large scale velocity decrease beneath the Proterozoic Grenville lithosphere in my model (Figures
6.10 and 6.11) is also present in some global models (e.g. Nettles and Dziewonski , 2008; Ritsema et al.,
2011; Shapiro and Ritzwoller , 2002). In contrast, some continental scale models (e.g. Bedle and van der
Lee, 2009; van der Lee and Frederiksen, 2005a; Yuan et al., 2011) image uniformly fast wavespeeds
beneath both Archean and Proterozoic terranes (Figure 6.14). The velocity decrease beneath the
Appalachian province, however, is a feature present in all models. In the continental scale model of
Schaeffer and Lebedev (2014), a lower velocity region appears beneath the Grenville Province, near the
eastern edge of the Superior craton and south of the Eastern Churchill Province (Figure 2.1), where a
consistently negative phase velocity anomaly is detected 170 s period (Figures 6.10 and 6.11).
A number of regional-scale models of southeast Canada overlap with the southern portions of the study
area (Aktas and Eaton, 2006; Chen and Li , 2012; Rondenay et al., 2000b). These models consistently
image a high velocity anomaly corridor dipping away from the Superior craton beneath the Grenville
122 Chapter 6. Lithospheric structure from surface wave tomography
Province at 50-150 km depth. In contrast, more recent body-wave models of the same area image a
sharp vertical contrast directly beneath the Archean-Proterozoic boundary (Boyce et al., 2016). In this
study, a wedge of positive phase velocity anomaly extending beneath the southern Grenville Province
between 20 s and 70 s period was detected.
Beneath the Eastern Churchill Province, the decrease in velocity in my model correlates with the
models of Nettles and Dziewonski (2008), van der Lee and Frederiksen (2005a), Bedle and van der Lee
(2009) and Yuan et al. (2011), while high velocity anomalies are detected by Schaeffer and Lebedev
(2014), Lebedev and van der Hilst (2008) and Debayle and Ricard (2012). Interestingly, previous
tomographic models that included anisotropy in the inversion (Nettles and Dziewonski , 2008; Yuan
et al., 2011) correlate better with my model (Figure 6.14).
The Great Meteor hotspot track is generally associated with a divot of slow velocity within the ambient
high velocity lid (e.g. Frederiksen et al., 2007; Villemaire et al., 2012) and appears in the models of
French et al. (2013) and Shapiro and Ritzwoller (2002). A pronounced corridor of lower phase velocity
that could be associated with the Great Meteor hotspot track was not detected, although this may be
due to the lower resolution at the edges of the model (Figure 6.7).
Seismic heterogeneities within the Superior craton
The high seismic velocity generally imaged beneath cratonic regions is commonly thought to be caused
by extensive chemical depletion in heavy elements such as Fe, Al or Ca (e.g. Griffin et al., 2003; Jordan,
1988). Purely compositional variations ranging from highly-depleted dunite generally associated with
Archean mantle, to typical modern mantle peridotites, result in 1-2% velocity variations (e.g. Goes
et al., 2000; James et al., 2004; Lee, 2003). A higher degree of depletion in heavy metals is generally
associated with lower density and higher velocity (e.g. Griffin et al., 2009). Some studies, however,
suggest the effects of melt depletion may be too subtle (Vs 0.5%) to be resolved seismically (e.g.
Afonso et al., 2008; Schutt and Lesher , 2006). The phase velocity anomalies beneath the Superior
Province range between 0.5% and 2.5% at shorter periods (20-90 s) and -1% to 2.5% at longer periods
(150 s), indicating strong lateral heterogeneities within the cratonic mantle. Studies of xenoliths from
the Renard kimberlite field in central Quebec showed a 200 km thick lithosphere composed mainly of
lherzolite and harzburgite (Hunt et al., 2012), although more depleted harzburgite may be present,
as well as eclogitic portions (Hunt et al., 2010) which can result in increased seismic velocity and
seismically distinct domains (e.g. Worthington et al., 2013). Variations in chemical composition of

124 Chapter 6. Lithospheric structure from surface wave tomography
xenoliths, indicative of mantle heterogeneities, have been reported in other Precambrian regions (e.g.
Siberian craton, Snyder et al. (1995), North China Craton, Tang et al. (2013b), Slave craton, Kopylova
and Caro (2004)).
A 100K temperature anomaly may cause a velocity change of 0.5-2% (e.g. Hieronymus and Goes,
2010). Within the stable continental interiors, large temperature variations are unlikely, however,
since the thermal equilibration times (2Ga for lithospheric thickness of 200-270 km; Michaut et al.,
2007) are similar to the time elapsed since the last tectonic event (2.5Ga in the Superior craton).
The most recent tectonic event that affected parts of the southern Superior craton is the passage of
the North American plate over the Great Meteor hotspot track at 190-110Ma ago. The hotspot may
have re-fertilized the mantle (e.g. Boyce et al., 2016; Frederiksen et al., 2013) in the southern section of
the study region, consistent with the negative velocity anomalies I observe at all periods in my model
(Figure 6.10) also detected in some regional (e.g. Boyce et al., 2016; Frederiksen et al., 2007; Villemaire
et al., 2012) and continental scale models (e.g. French et al., 2013). The thermal impact associated
with a mantle plume head can be as high as 500C, which will rapidly diffuse and decay to 80C
at 200 km over 120Ma (Eaton and Frederiksen, 2007). A major thermal contribution to the lateral
velocity variations within the upper lithosphere is thus unlikely. Seismic heterogeneities at periods
sampling deeper mantle material may result from local lithospheric thickness variations. At the same
period and depth range of propagation, Rayleigh waves may encounter low velocity asthenospheric
material, due to the local topographic relief of the cratonic root, resulting in strong lateral phase
velocity heterogeneities at longer periods (150 s).
Velocity decrease beneath Proterozoic and younger provinces
Within the Precambrian region, the gradual decrease in velocity (3%) is a large-scale feature of
my model that persists to 140 s period and broadly correlates with the Proterozoic terranes that
surround the Superior craton. The decrease in velocity from Archean to Proterozoic mantle may reflect
the transition from a melt-depleted cratonic lithosphere to a more fertile modern mantle beneath the
Proterozoic. Interestingly, this gradual change in mantle seismic properties with age mirrors a change
in crustal properties: the post-Archean crust was recently found to be thicker, more heterogeneous,
and more mafic (Petrescu et al., 2016).
Whether the mantle underlying circum-cratonic terranes is the original Archean mantle that has been
re-fertilized or it represents young mantle material formed as a result of secular variation of mantle
6.4. Discussion 125
forming processes (e.g. Griffin et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2013a) is ambiguous. (Snyder , 2002) proposed
that strong Archean mantle can indent into the weaker juvenile Proterozoic mantle, forming the so
called wedge tectonics. Seismic profiling of the Archean to Proterozoic crust detected Archean
lower crust underlying the Grenville Province as far as 250 km away from the Archean-Proterozoic
boundary (White et al., 2000). A recent body-wave tomographic study of the upper mantle (Boyce
et al., 2016) detected a sharp vertical change in P and S wave velocity beneath the Grenville Front
(Figure 2.1), which they interpreted as a metasomatic front, likely related to the pre-Grenvillian
subduction system altering the composition of the cratonic margin. Magnetotelluric studies also
detected dipping resistors to 120 km depth beneath the Grenville Province, interpreted as re-fertilized
Archean mantle (e.g. Adetunji et al., 2014). The thermochemical effects of metasomatic re-fertilization,
associated with heat-generating radioactive elements, can also result in a long-lasting seismic anomaly
signature of up to 4-4.5% (e.g. Hieronymus and Goes, 2010).
A thermal effect linked with lithospheric thickness may also contribute to the phase velocity de-
crease, although it cannot be unequivocally discriminated from compositional effects. The conductive
geothermal gradient of a thick lithosphere, generally imaged beneath cratons, can be associated with a
decrease in Vs from 4.7 km/s in the upper lithosphere to 4.65 km/s at 180 km depth, without consid-
ering anelastic attenuation (James et al., 2004). Superior craton lithospheric thickness was previously
inferred to be >220 km (e.g. Porritt et al., 2015; Schaeffer and Lebedev , 2014; Yuan and Romanowicz ,
2010), which would induce colder geotherms and consequently higher velocities. A thinner lithosphere
that likely underlies the Proterozoic Grenville Province will have a steeper geothermal gradient, result-
ing in higher temperatures and progressively lower seismic velocities. The eastern continental margin
of the Laurentian continent (present day Grenville Province) is also thought to have been involved
in a 500Ma long Andean-style paleo-subduction system (Rivers, 1997; Rondenay et al., 2000b); the
Grenville Province was dominated by a hot long-duration plateau, similar to Tibet, that subsequently
collapsed 1Ga ago (Rivers, 2009). These tectonic events likely left an imprint on the cratonic mantle,
altering its composition and lithospheric thickness and consequently redefining the geothermal gradi-
ent. It can thus be concluded that the joint thermochemical effect of both metasomatic re-fertilization
(e.g. Boyce et al., 2016) of the Archean Laurentian mantle partially underlying the Grenville Province
and a progressively thinner lithosphere can explain the 3% velocity decrease detected beneath the
Proterozoic regions.

Grenville Provinces) and Phanerozoic terranes may arise from a thermal contrast: the Phanerozoic
Appalachian Province may have experienced lithospheric delamination (e.g. Levin and Park , 2000;
Yuan and Levin, 2014), which would have been accompanied by upwelling of hot asthenospheric ma-
terial. Additionally, a shallower lithosphere underlain by hydrated asthenospheric melts beneath the
Appalachians may also be contributing to the observed decrease in seismic velocity (e.g. Rychert et al.,
2005).
6.4.2 Causes of upper mantle anisotropy
The main cause of anisotropy in the upper mantle is usually associated with olivine, the most abun-
dant and highly anisotropic mineral of the mantle. Strain results in development of crystallographic
preferred orientation (CPO) of olivine crystals, leading to a-axis alignment in the direction of flow (e.g.
Bystricky et al., 2000; Tommasi et al., 2000; Zhang and Karato, 1995). When a shear wave traverses
such a medium, the faster-travelling component will travel parallel to the a-axes of the crystal (e.g.
Silver and Chan, 1991). Anisotropic fabrics can form due to asthenospheric flow (e.g. Fouch et al.,
2000; Sleep et al., 2002; Vinnik et al., 1989), the preferential alignment of fluid or melt (e.g. Blackman
and Kendall , 1997), preexisting anisotropy frozen into the lithosphere (e.g. Bastow et al., 2007; Silver
and Chan, 1988; Vauchez and Nicolas, 1991), or any combination thereof.
6.4. Discussion 127
6.4.3 Previous measurements of seismic anisotropy in eastern Canada
Variations in azimuthal anisotropic patterns within the Superior craton are of particular interest as
they provide new insight into geological processes that operated in the Archean. My tomographic
model shows the change in anisotropy beneath Precambrian eastern Canada in unprecedented detail,
with multiple vertical changes in the orientation and magnitude of anisotropy occurring within the
fast velocity anomaly region broadly collocated with the Archean terranes (Section 6.3). Previous
measurements of anisotropy are concentrated in the southern sections of the study area and come
from magnetotelluric (e.g. Mareschal et al., 1995) and SKS measurements (e.g. Darbyshire et al.,
2015; Gilligan et al., 2016), which have low vertical resolution and may often record a vertically-
averaged signal from the lithosphere and the convecting mantle. Multi-layered anisotropy signals can
interfere and cause a backazimuthal variation in the SKS splitting measurements, which was detected
at several seismic stations across the Superior craton (Darbyshire et al., 2015).
There is compelling evidence for the existence of multiple layers of anisotropy within the mantle
beneath the North American continent from a large number of global- (e.g. Debayle and Ricard , 2013;
Debayle et al., 2005) and regional/continental-scale (e.g. Darbyshire et al., 2013; Frederiksen et al.,
2006; Yuan et al., 2011, 2014) teleseismic studies. The anisotropic seismic continental model of Yuan
et al. (2011) suggested that the cratonic mantle is composed of two distinct layers, based on the depth
variation of the fast wave polarization. A decrease in anisotropy magnitude in the lower lithosphere
was observed in parts of the Superior craton at 150 km depth in the model of Yuan et al. (2011),
similar to the decrease detected between 100 and 140 s period range (Figures 6.10,6.11). At this depth,
a strong NW-SE oriented anisotropy was identified in the northern portions of eastern Canada which
contrasts with the results in this study, in the broadly corresponding period range (100-140 s). At
250 km depth, Yuan et al. (2011) imaged constant SW-NE oriented anisotropy, while my model shows
a more varied pattern across the provinces at longest periods.
Figure 6.16 shows a comparison between the azimuthal anisotropy estimated by Yuan et al. (2011) at
70 km, 150 km and 250 km depth, respectively and the 2 anisotropy estimated in this study at three
periods with peak sensitivity at the corresponding depths: 60 s, 120 s and 170 s, respectively. At 70 km
(broadly sampled by 60 s period Rayleigh waves), there are some similarities in the Eastern Churchill
Province, southeast Appalachian Province and southwest Superior. At 150 km, the previous model
shows a dominant NW-SE direction, although the magnitude decreases significantly in central Superior

and in parts of the Grenville Province, similar to my model at 120 s. At 250 km, a constant NW-SE
direction is pervasive across eastern Canada. In my model, this anisotropy direction characterises the
central and northern Superior craton, while the surrounding provinces display anisotropy directions
that broadly correlate with the absolute plate motion (Figure 6.16).
6.4.4 Frozen-in Archean tectonic deformation in the upper lithosphere
Whether or not tectonic processes in the Archean were capable of imparting a seismic anisotropic
fabric on the lithosphere is debated (e.g. Fouch et al., 2004), but younger Precambrian fabrics are
recognized worldwide. For example, the thick lithosphere of northern Canada retains a strong fossil
lithospheric fabric of the 1.8 Ga Trans-Hudson Orogen (Bastow et al., 2011; Darbyshire et al., 2013).
Precambrian fossil lithospheric fabrics have also been detected in southern Africa (e.g. Fouch et al.,
2004; Silver et al., 2001) and northern Europe (Fennoscandia: Plomerova and Babuska, 2010).
At periods <110 s (peak sensitivity at 120 km depth), anisotropy patterns within the Superior craton
transition from predominantly E-W in the south to N-S in the north (Figure 6.10), mimicking the
orientation of the Archean surface boundaries (Figure 6.17). SKS splitting directions in the southern
Superior are also parallel to the tectonic fabrics (Senechal et al., 1996), although Darbyshire et al.
(2015) found this correlation to be partial. Since the peak depth sensitivity of the maximum period at
which this anisotropic signal is detected is at 120 km depth, the source must reside in the lithosphere.
Short scale lateral variation of SKS measurements also suggests that the origin of the anisotropic signal
lies mostly in the 50-150 km depth range (Senechal et al., 1996).
The striking agreement in direction between surface geological features, the calculated anisotropy in
the 40-100 s period range in this study (Figure 6.10) and previous SKS measurements (Figure 6.17)
suggests that the anisotropic signal must be due to deeply rooted lithospheric deformation zones. This
idea is also supported by a systematic obliquity between electric and seismic anisotropy identified in
the southern Superior craton (Mareschal et al., 1995; Senechal et al., 1996), thought to arise from the
alignment of a-type olivine minerals in non-coaxial shear deformation zones in the lithosphere (Ji et al.,
1996). The surface geology indicates that tectonic assembly of the Superior craton was completed by
2.5Ga (Hoffman, 1989a), implying that the detected lithospheric deformation is of Archean age. The
persistence of fossilized Archean tectonic deformation at mantle depths implies that the crust and
lithospheric mantle deformed coherently and that the constituent micro-cratonic blocks must have
been already thick (120 km) and strong enough to transmit stress across lithospheric depth scales,

at the time of Archean assemblage.
6.4.5 Archean mantle beneath surrounding terranes
Phase velocity anomalies of1%, indicative of cratonic material, partially extend beneath the Grenville
Province. Anisotropic fabrics are oblique to the general NE-SW Grenville orogenic trend and par-
allel Archean deformation zones in the Superior. This observation is most evident at periods 70 s,
between 46 and 52 N (Figure 6.10), where the dominant E-W anisotropy direction persists up to
200 km away from the Archean-Proterozoic boundary. In the same area, SKS splitting measurements
at a seismic array crossing the Archean-Proterozoic boundary showed no variation in the fast axis
direction (Ji et al., 1996; Senechal et al., 1996). Active seismic profiling of the Archean to Proterozoic
crust detected Archean lower crust underlying the Grenville Province as far as 250 km away from
the Archean-Proterozoic boundary (White et al., 2000). Magnetotelluric studies detected dipping re-
sistors to 120 km depth beneath the Grenville Province, interpreted as re-fertilized Archean mantle
(e.g. Adetunji et al., 2014). On the other hand, a recent body-wave tomographic study of the upper
mantle (Boyce et al., 2016) detected a sharp vertical change in P and S wave velocity beneath the
Grenville Front (Figure 2.1). The joint thermochemical effect of metasomatism or a progressively
thinner and warmer lithosphere, as discussed previously, may influence the slight reduction in seismic
velocity beneath the circum-cratonic regions. However, the persistence of anisotropic fabrics that par-
allel Archean surface deformation suggests that cratonic mantle extends beneath surrounding regions
and maintains frozen-in Archean fabrics despite possible metasomatic reworking.
6.4.6 Anisotropy decrease in the lower cratonic lithosphere
The nature of the weakly anisotropic zone sampled in the 110-140 s period interval (peak sensitivity
at 150-200 km depth) must be lithospheric. Previous seismic (e.g. Schaeffer and Lebedev , 2014; Yuan
and Romanowicz , 2010) and geochemical studies (Hunt et al., 2012) inferred the lithospheric thickness
in the area to be >220 km which is 50 km deeper than the peak depth sensitivity at 140 s (Figure
6.11). Also, phase velocities are 1% faster than the regional (4.3 km/s, Figure 6.11) and the global
average (4.2 km/s, Figure 6.18d), indicating that the material is either colder or more compositionally
depleted, akin to cratonic regions.
Competing effects of multiple anisotropic layers with perpendicular fast directions may cause an al-
most null cumulative anisotropic signature, which may be observed in SKS studies (e.g. Girardin and
132 Chapter 6. Lithospheric structure from surface wave tomography

6.4. Discussion 133
Farra, 1998). Similarly, the relatively broad range of depth sensitivity of Rayleigh waves at periods
between 110 and 140 s (Figure 6.11) may include weak signals from both the upper lithosphere and the
underlying mantle, with contrasting anisotropic signatures, resulting in an apparently isotropic tran-
sition zone. However, if this was true, the observed splitting of SKS waves, which travelled through
both anisotropic layers with hypothetically perpendicular anisotropy directions, should be almost null,
contrary to previous measurements in the area (Darbyshire et al., 2015; Senechal et al., 1996). Also,
the plate motion vectors (Figure 6.17), commonly considered to represent upper mantle flow (e.g. Yuan
and Romanowicz , 2010), are oblique to the anisotropy directions estimated in the upper lithosphere
(20-140 s, Figure 6.10). It is thus unlikely that the interference between the anisotropic signatures of
the upper lithosphere and the underlying flowing asthenosphere is sufficient to cause the observed drop
in the absolute anisotropy magnitude in a period interval sampling a 100 km depth range.
Hypotheses of formation and age of the lower lithosphere
Theories explaining the reduction in anisotropy within the upper mantle include a change in the creep-
ing mechanism from dislocation to diffusion creep (Karato, 1992) or the olivine glide system (Mainprice
et al., 2005), both of which would imply a younger formation age for the lower lithosphere than for
the upper lithosphere. Forward modeling of seismic anisotropy generated by olivine CPO developed in
the presence of mantle flow suggests that a sudden switch in flow direction generates a depth-averaged
response of the mineralogical CPO development, resulting in a weakly-anisotropic basal layer at the
transition between different strain orientations (Tommasi , 1998). However, in a global study of seis-
mic anisotropy, Debayle and Ricard (2013) found that, for plate velocities of <4 cm/yr (current APM
magnitude in eastern Canada is 20mm/yr), the basal drag from plate-asthenosphere interaction is
likely too weak to develop flow-aligned anisotropy. The absence of significant seismic anisotropy in the
lower lithosphere may therefore suggest a low relative velocity between the growing Superior craton
lithosphere and the convecting mantle beneath during Precambrian times. The formation of the lower
lithosphere may have been sufficiently protracted that no single, coherent mantle flow or basal drag
anisotropic fabric was preserved within it.
Alternative explanations for the presence of weakly anisotropic layers include metasomatism by water-
rich fluids or melts (e.g. Baptiste et al., 2012). Annealed microstructures of coarse-grained peridotites
extracted from 150 km depth from the Kaapvaal craton also indicate that dislocation creep, recording
early Archean deformation, was followed by effective annealing, due to a protracted period of cooling
134 Chapter 6. Lithospheric structure from surface wave tomography
and metasomatism (Baptiste et al., 2012). Melt percolation derived from a volatile-rich subcontinental
mantle may have reworked a pre-existing layer from beneath, possibly erasing its original seismic
signature. However, previous studies of mantle seismic anisotropy in Spain (Vauchez et al., 2005)
and Polynesia (Tommasi et al., 2004) suggested that fossil tectonic fabrics, in the form of preexisting
olivine crystal preferred orientations, inherited from older deformation, can survive partial melting or
melt percolation. Baptiste et al. (2012) also speculated that metasomatism would occur episodically,
which would induce lateral heterogeneities within affected areas. The Superior craton is pervaded
by multiple dyke swarms that record magmatic pulses at 2.5, 2.2 and 2.1Ga, linked with episodes of
extension at the paleocratonic margins (Ernst and Bleeker , 2010) or the arrival of mantle plume heads
(Ernst and Bleeker , 2001), providing possible metasomatic sources. Geochemical data in the Slave
craton (Griffin et al., 2004) suggest the presence of a second uniform Archean mantle layer, with the
top located between 140 and 160 km depth. Griffin et al. (2004) interpreted this layer as subcreted
mantle plume material at ca. 3.2Ga. However, the radial spread of plume material from one or more
sources or the presence of pervasive dyke swarms in the lower lithosphere may be expected to cause
discernable seismic anisotropy patterns (Snyder and Bruneton, 2007; Yuan and Romanowicz , 2010)
and would decrease seismic velocities relative to normal lithospheric mantle (Tommasi et al., 2004),
contrary to my results.
The age of formation of the lower lithosphere may be Proterozoic, although my data alone cannot
constrain this. While most geochemical evidence indicates that most melt extraction occurred in the
Archean (Carlson et al., 2005; Pearson, 1999), some xenoliths record Proterozoic mantle addition to
the cratonic root (e.g. Pearson et al., 1995; Smart et al., 2014), supporting the idea that root forma-
tion and stabilization may be a younger phenomenon than the bulk depleted craton age. The wide
extent of the almost isotropic and relatively homogenous lower lithosphere likely fits the hypothesis
in which the base of the lithosphere grew by progressive cooling after the tectonic assemblage of the
upper lithosphere was completed Bedard and Harris (e.g. 2014). The recognition of at least two
temporally distinct lithospheric zones in my model endorses the idea that cratonic keel growth is not
due to one particular dominant tectonic process and, most importantly, is not exclusively an Archean
phenomenon. Previous seismic studies postulated a Paleoproterozoic origin for the lower layer beneath
Hudson Bay and surrounding terranes (e.g. Darbyshire et al., 2013; Porritt et al., 2015), supporting
episodic formation of cratonic roots in the Precambrian.
6.4. Discussion 135
6.4.7 Lowermost lithosphere - transition to the convective asthenosphere
While I do not attempt to constrain the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary due to the broad sensitiv-
ity range of Rayleigh waves at longer periods, I note that pronounced seismic heterogeneities develop
at periods 140 s and the anisotropy magnitude significantly increases at 190 s (4%, Figure 6.11).
Geodynamic models predict the existence of a thin transitional layer (50 km thick) at the base of
the chemically depleted cratonic core, which could absorb some of the shear deformation (e.g. Cooper
et al., 2004). The heterogeneous anisotropic material sampled between 140 and 190 s may be related
to the geodynamically predicted transitional layer at the base of the keel.
At periods 190 s, with peak depth sensitivity at 270 km depth (Figure 6.11) high phase velocity
anisotropy and heterogeneity develops. The data-fit at these periods decreases by 30% compared to
shorter periods (Figure 4.11), which calls for caution when interpreting these features. Since I inde-
pendently invert for phase velocity anomalies at each period, the consistency of large-scale features
between periods suggests that these features are not random numerical artefacts, but may indicate real
material properties. Also, Figure 6.2 shows that velocity dispersion is clearly visible at frequencies as
low as 0.003Hz (333 s period). In accordance with my results, strong anisotropy is expected in the
250-400 km depth range beneath cratons, due to asthenospheric flow (Gung et al., 2003). Mantle con-
vection and locally-complex flow around the cratonic root may thus be responsible for the anisotropy
increase and locally strong heterogeneities at periods 190 s (Figure 6.11), corroborating the view
that sub-cratonic mantle flow is complex (e.g. Fouch et al., 2000).
Geodynamic flow models (Forte et al., 2015) were computed based on the global seismic tomography
model TX2008 (Simmons et al., 2009) using two viscosity profiles and lithospheric thickness combi-
nations: V1 (Mitrovica and Forte, 2004) comprises a 100 km thick lithosphere, representative of the
global average and V2 (Forte et al., 2010) is adapted for a 200 km lithosphere akin to cratonic up-
per mantle. The V2 profile appears to correlate very well with the anisotropy directions that follow
the NW-SE trending low velocity corridor between 140-180 s and the high amplitude regional scale
anisotropy patterns at periods higher than 180 s (Figure 6.19). This provides concurrent but not
entirely independent evidence for the anisotropic fabric beneath 180 s being caused by mantle flow.
Geodynamic flow models may be mutually related to the observed patterns of anisotropy, since they
are based on the same source information: shear wave velocity.

and in the hotspot frame as predicted by Gripp and Gordon (2002) (red arrows) and the geodynamic
flow field as calculated by Forte et al. (2015) (grey arrows).
6.4. Discussion 137
Sub-cratonic mantle flow corridor?
A distinct pattern emerges at periods between 140-180 s within the craton (Figure 6.11). A 300 km
wide elongated region of negative isotropic phase velocity anomaly develops in a NW-SE direction,
and appears to divide two positive velocity regions (up to 4% peak to peak anomaly). Fast S-wave
directions follow the strike of this low velocity corridor and are parallel to the predicted flow velocity
vectors of the V2 geodynamic model predicted by Forte et al. (2015) (Figure 6.19). The shape of
this pattern is suggestive of a corridor of flow-aligned mantle separating two cold depleted cratonic
keels.
The low phase velocity cratonic material coincides with very high values of both lateral and vertical
motion as recorded by GPS stations (10mm/yr), decreasing to 4mm/yr in the high velocity anomaly
region beneath the southern Superior craton. Sella et al. (2007) suggested that, in addition to glacial
isostatic adjustment, lateral variation in upper mantle viscosity must be considered to accurately model
the observed GPS velocities. A higher degree of water content can lead to lower viscosity values (e.g.
Karato, 2008), which renders the material more readily deformable. Cooper et al. (2004) proposed
the existence of a transitional boundary layer between the rigid chemically depleted cratonic root
and the mobile asthenosphere, which partially absorbs the shear tractions exerted by the convective
mantle (Cooper and Conrad , 2009). Also, it has recently been suggested that deep sections of the
southern Superior cratonic root have been shifted in the direction of mantle flow (Kaban et al., 2015).
Rayleigh waves at long periods are, however, sensitive to broad depth ranges (100 km, Figure 4.8)
and may produce an image that contains signal from both lower lithosphere and the convective mantle
below.
If the alignment of corridor-parallel anisotropic patterns with predicted mantle flow vectors is a valid
correlation, this potentially wet, chemically distinct, less viscous zone may be the younger transitional
boundary layer, sheared by present basal mantle drag (Figure 6.20). Alternatively, the fast S-wave
polarisations may reflect frozen-in LPO anisotropy caused by paleo-flow conduits around stronger,
more depleted Archean cores.
6.4.8 Comparison with other cratons
Seismic anisotropy has been studied in other cratons using a range of methods such as SKS split-
ting (e.g. Silver et al., 2001; Snyder and Bruneton, 2007), Love and Rayleigh wave anisotropy (e.g.

and Eaton, 2010; Sodoudi et al., 2013), each reporting slightly different results and interpretations,
depending on the imaging method and resolution. A comparison of the seismic anisotropy between
different stable continental interiors yields a few similarities (see e.g. Fouch and Rondenay , 2006, for
a review of anisotropy beneath cratons), although a unified anisotropic model of craton structure and
growth seems increasingly unlikely. Some cratons are found to be anisotropic from top to bottom and
may retain the signature of underplated lithosphere (e.g. Slave, Bostock et al., 2010), while others
may have been affected by nearby plume magmatism (e.g. Tanzania, Sebai et al., 2006), or other types
of thermochemical erosion (e.g. delamination beneath the North China Craton, Gao et al., 2009; Xu,
2001), which erased their initial anisotropic signatures or contributed to their growth or destruction
in different ways. Most studies, however, agree that on average, anisotropy measurements display a
correlation with surface tectonic trends within the upper 150 km of the lithosphere, related to initial
craton amalgamation, similar to my findings (Figure 6.17): the Baltic shield (e.g. Pedersen, 2006),
the South African cratons (e.g. Adam and Lebedev , 2012; Fouch et al., 2004; Freybourger et al., 2001;
Silver et al., 2004), western Australian cratons (e.g. Fichtner et al., 2010; Girardin and Farra, 1998),
the North China craton (e.g. Bai et al., 2010) and the Slave craton (e.g. Snyder et al., 2003).
Most studies report a switch from dominant fossil anisotropy in the upper lithosphere to anisotropy
6.4. Discussion 139
related to present-day asthenospheric flow (e.g. Deschamps et al., 2008). The transition from layers
containing frozen-in Archean deformation signatures to subcratonic flow may, however, be more com-
plex. Mechanically-weak basal layers such as deformable boundary layers that absorb some of the
shear stress at the base of the keel have been geodynamically inferred (e.g. Cooper et al., 2004) and
reported beneath some cratons (e.g. Kaban et al., 2015). Also, lithospheric regions exhibiting a reduc-
tion in their azimuthal anisotropy similar to my observations (Figure 6.18) were previously reported
in the 100-200 km depth range in a 3D anisotropic model of North America (Yuan et al., 2011) and
between 70 and 150 km depth in Australia from full waveform tomography (Fichtner et al., 2010).
Forward modeling of S receiver functions in the Kaapvaal craton revealed an anisotropic layer (3%
anisotropy) between 40 and 90 km depth, underlain by a dominantly isotropic metasomatized lower
lithosphere (Sodoudi et al., 2013). Thus, depending on the tectonic history of each craton, cratonic
roots may comprise chemical and metasomatic layers (e.g. Sodoudi et al., 2013), sometimes separated
by intra-lithospheric discontinuities (e.g. Wirth and Long , 2014).
6.4.9 Conclusion
Eastern Canadas heterogeneous and anisotropically complex lithosphere documents the development
of cratonic keels through Archean and Proterozoic times. The upper mantle underlying Archean
terranes is seismically faster (up to 5% peak to peak dC/C anomaly) than adjacent Proterozoic and
Phanerozoic belts, between 20 and 140 s period, broadly sensitive to depths up to 170 km. This
seismic dichotomy may represent a compositional and thermal contrast between the depleted cratonic
Archean core and the younger, chemically evolved Proterozoic lithosphere, perhaps indicating a change
in mantle forming mechanisms at the end of the Archean.
Anisotropy of the Precambrian lithosphere is complex and appears to align with Archean surface
tectonic boundaries at periods lower than 100 s beneath the Superior craton and partially beneath the
Grenville Province. The correlation suggests that cratonic blocks must have been thick and strong
enough to sustain plate scale deformation and that cratonic lithosphere with Archean anisotropic
signature underlies Proterozoic belts, surviving subsequent subduction-related metasomatism.
The lower lithosphere beneath the Superior craton, detected at periods between 110 and 140 s, is seis-
mically fast, but only weakly anisotropic. The interference between upper lithospheric fossil anisotropy
and the signature of the flowing underlying asthenosphere may result in a weak signal at the transition
between the two anisotropic layers. Alternatively, basal growing of the lithosphere in a regionally slow
140 Chapter 6. Lithospheric structure from surface wave tomography
mantle convection ambient may explain the existence of a weakly anisotropic layer.
The base of the cratonic lithosphere and the transition to convecting asthenosphere may be complex.
Highly heterogeneous and anisotropic fabrics are detected at 140-190 s period, sensitive to depths that
could include the asthenosphere. Significant base-of-lithosphere topography may regionally interact
with subcratonic mantle flow patterns, causing the observed lateral heterogeneities and anisotropic
patterns.

Conclusions
The crustal structure of three adjacent tectonic provinces with ages spanning 3 billion years of
Earths history has been investigated using data from a newly-installed broadband seismograph net-
work (QM-III) in conjunction with long-term and permanent seismographs across the region. Using
receiver functions, H   stacking and Bayesian inversion, the crustal thickness (H), the bulk crustal
Vp/Vs ratio (), the shear velocity structure and the discontinuity structure within the crust were
estimated.
H   results display an age dependent trend with the thickness and bulk crustal Vp/Vs ratio of
the Proterozoic Grenville crust (40.852.54 km and 1.760.03, respectively) being higher than the
values obtained for the Archean Superior craton (35.871.41 km and 1.730.02) and slightly higher
than the Phanerozoic Appalachians (36.933.80 km and 1.750.05), respectively (Figure 5.8). Pre-
vious laboratory experiments observed a linear relationship between the SiO2 content of rocks and
the Vp/Vs ratio. Hence, my results suggest that the bulk crustal composition of Proterozoic and
Phanerozoic domains is, on average, more mafic than the adjacent Archean domains. Additionally,
the Phanerozoic crust is thinner than the Proterozoic. The shear velocity structure exhibits signif-
icant differences, with the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic terranes being seismically faster and more
heterogeneous than the adjacent Archean domains. The lower crust beneath the Grenville Province
and the Appalachians is higher velocity (3.8-4.0 km/s) than beneath the Superior craton (Figure 5.7).
This secular variation pattern occurs in Precambrian terranes in other continents and agrees with the
theory that mafic underplating may have been an especially important mechanism for crustal growth
during the Proterozoic.
The crust beneath the surface expression of the Archean-Proterozoic boundary is consistently thin and
is interpreted to reflect a continuation of Archean basement in the deep crustal levels of the adjacent
142 Chapter 7. Conclusions
Proterozoic terranes. About 50-60 km SE of the Grenville Front, Moho depth increases by 5-10 km,
although this trend is not spatially continuous along the full extent of the orogen (Figure 5.5). The
lack of a systematic Moho step beneath the edge of the Superior craton, as estimated in this study,
implies that the feature may not be a fossilized Archean slab, as previously thought, but instead a
localized feature, perhaps an accumulation of magmatic material at the cratonic edge associated with
the Great Meteor hotspot.
Some crustal sections in the Proterozoic belt may have experienced partial eclogitization, although
this theory does not appear to reconcile all the geophysical observations beneath the QM-III stations.
Instead, I propose that a strong subcontinental lithospheric mantle provides the necessary buoyant
support for the relatively thick crustal roots in the Proterozoic belt.
The interior of the Proterozoic Grenville Province is heavily pervaded by feldspar-rich igneous intru-
sions, with a geochemical composition that is unique to Proterozoic times. The crust beneath QM-III
stations within these igneous massifs is unusually thick. The lower crust, which has an unusually high
Vp/Vs ratio, could represent the gabbroic residue derived from the formation of these anorthosites.
Mafic magmatic underplating beneath the Proterozoic crust, supported by previous geochemical data,
may indicate a mantle source for these intrusions and could be responsible for crustal growth in a
vertical sense.
A first order feature of the anisotropic phase velocity model is the clear distinction in the isotropic
shear wave velocity between the fast upper mantle underlying Archean terranes and that beneath
Proterozoic belts, between 20 and 140 s, roughly equivalent to a maximum depth of 170 km (Figure
6.10). This contrast was interpreted as a compositional change between depleted cratonic lithosphere
and either metasomatised Archean mantle or younger, chemically distinct Proterozoic lithosphere.
This seismic dichotomy may be a sign of secular mantle evolution, perhaps due to a change in the
geodynamic mechanisms at the end of the Archean.
The Superior craton lithosphere is anisotropically complex. The upper lithosphere, sampled at periods
of 40-100 s, is seismically fast and weakly heterogeneous, with anisotropic fabrics that parallel surface
tectonic boundaries of Archean age (Figure 6.17). This correlation suggests that cratonic blocks must
have been strong enough to support plate scale collision at 2.5Ga. Cratonic upper lithosphere par-
tially underlies the surrounding Proterozoic belts and preserves the signature of Archean deformation
despite subsequent mantle re-fertilization.
The lower lithosphere, sampled at periods of 110-140 s, is seismically fast, more homogenous, and
weakly anisotropic (Figure 6.18). We speculate that it formed in Proterozoic times, subsequent to
the accretion of the overlying Archean terranes. The weak anisotropy detected at lower lithospheric
depths could result from the interference between present-day anisotropy in the flowing asthenosphere
below and the fossil anisotropy in the upper lithosphere or the gradual transition between different
strain orientations as a result of changing convection patterns at the time of lithospheric growth.
Nevertheless, I find it more likely that the decrease represents the weakly anisotropic fabric of the
material, which may point towards regionally sluggish mantle convection and/or slow absolute plate
motion at the time of formation.
The basal root of the cratonic mantle may be imaged between periods of 140 and 190 s and contains
highly heterogeneous and anisotropic seismic fabrics. These suggest that significant base-of-lithosphere
topography may be present at the base of the craton. The craton root transition and interaction with
the convecting asthenosphere are therefore likely to be complex.

Further work
Further analysis may shed light on the internal structural variability of cratonic mantle and its litho-
spheric thickness. Using phase velocity dispersion measurements and receiver functions estimated in
this work, I suggest that a joint inversion of these two data sets can be performed to obtain absolute
shear wave velocity (Vs) variation with depth beneath each station (e.g. Herrmann, 2013). Vs can
then be used to infer lithospheric thickness (e.g. where the value is decreasing to 1 to 2% above
the global average, Darbyshire et al., 2013; Eaton et al., 2009), or the existence of intra-lithospheric
discontinuities such as the MLD (e.g. Wirth and Long , 2014; Yuan and Romanowicz , 2010).
Thermochemical modeling of shear wave velocities can also shed light on the composition, geothermal
profile and water content of Precambrian mantle. Fertile to depleted mantle mineralogy can be
simulated with pyrolite, basalt, harzburgite and dunite compositions (Hieronymus and Goes, 2010).
Mineral stability fields for a range of pressure-temperature (P-T) values and their corresponding elastic
shear wave velocities can be generated with mineral phase modelling programs such as PerPle X
(Connolly , 1990, 2005). A range of geothermal profiles can then be assumed in the P-T domain and
the corresponding velocity profiles for each chemical composition can be compared with the observed
seismic velocities.

Appendix C
H- and RF plots
The following figures contain : Left - H stack diagrams with red dashed line pointing to the H
solution pair that gives the maximum stack function and the green contour showing 95% confidence
interval in the solution; Right: Epicentral distance gathers of composite receiver functions stacked in
10 bins with 5 overlap. Red dashed lines indicate predicted Ps, PpPs and PsPs+PpSs arrival times
based on the H   solution.
