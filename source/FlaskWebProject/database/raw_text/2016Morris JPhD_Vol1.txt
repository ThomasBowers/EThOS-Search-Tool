Abstract 
From the time of Augustus, the Roman agrimensores or land surveyors provided an 
important connection between those who administrated the Empire on the one hand, and 
the territories and peoples they controlled on the other. This work is an investigation 
into the surveyors use of the cultural capital of Roman society to fashion their own 
identity as experts in the organisation and regulation of land, and their influence on the 
shape of discourse about Empire. The study focuses on four questions: 
1) What was the nature of the relationship between the agrimensores or surveyors and 
the Roman provincial administration? 
2) What was the nature of the relationship between the agrimensores and the people of 
the Empire whose lands they surveyed? An emphasis will be placed on the 
population of Italy and the Roman provinces away from the city of Rome itself. 
3) How did the surveyors validate their activities as technical specialists, and under 
what circumstances did the agrimensores undertake surveying work? The thesis will 
focus on practical and theoretical practices implemented by surveyors in the field to 
structure the discourse between land-holders and administrators. The topics of 
boundary disputes and the issue of whether or not the agrimensores were involved 
in the collection of cartographic information will also be considered here. 
4) How and to what extent did the activities of the surveyors influence the provincial 
populations understanding of the Empire by shaping their experience of the 
imperial administration?

Acknowledgements 
The submission of this thesis represents the end of a very long and difficult journey. In 
the course of that journey I have accrued many debts to people, who have made such a 
huge difference in my life. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge those 
debts and thank all those who have supported me over the years. First and foremost, I 
need to thank Prof. Leon Fitts, Prof. Chris Francese and Prof. Mark Mastrangelo, who 
taught me all I know about Greek and Latin. More importantly, Leon took me to Italy 
all those years ago, when I was a freshman at Dickinson College, and convinced me to 
change my major from History to Classics. It was the start of this journey and the most 
momentous choice of my life. Chris was my supervisor and incredibly supportive, both 
at Dickinson and in the years after I graduated. I can only hope that one day I can be 
half as good a mentor and teacher to students as Leon, Chris and Mark were for me. 
Next, I need to thank all those at Victoria University Wellington and the 
University of Leicester, who have mentored me and seen me through my graduate 
studies. First, I need to thank Prof. Art Pomeroy and Prof. Matthew Trundle, who not 
only supported me through my MA, but gave me my first publications and academic 
position as Research Assistant. At Leicester, I owe a special debt to Prof. Graham 
Shipley, both for inviting me to study and for mentoring, to Dr. Andy Merrills and Dr. 
Jeremy Taylor, my supervisors, for all their hard work and guidance, to Dr. Neil 
Christie for mentoring me on review-writing and so many other things, and to Prof. 
David Mattingly for letting me have access to his private collection of journals and 
insights. 
I need also to thank Dr. Oriol Olesti Villa (Universitat Autnoma de Barcelona) 
for access to his Power Point slides of Oxford lecture notes (2014) and Dr. Alessandro 
Pace (Universit degli Studi di Milano) for the use of his photography of the temple of 
Aizanoi (Turkey). 
I also owe a special debt of thanks to Dr. Tom Elliott, who was my boss and 
mentor at the Ancient World Mapping Center where I acquired my interest in the 
Roman Land surveyors, to Prof. Richard Talbert, who kindly allowed me to sit in on so

many of his graduate courses in Roman History, to Prof. George Houston, who 
introduced me to the joys of Latin epigraphy and to Prof. Nic Terrenato, who spent 
much time discussing field surveying theory and methodology with me. 
Now I need to thank the two long-suffering people, who have acted as my 
Specialist Mentors and Sighted Assistants during my PhD (University of Leicester) and 
MA (Victoria University Wellington): Dr. Antonino Nino Cris and Tania Hayes. 
Thanks also goes to: Dr. Crysta Kaczmarek, Dr. Niccol Mugnai, Gabi 
Witthaus, George Sfougaras, Julie Mahon, Em Halsey, Marion Sanson and so many 
other friends. 
Last, and most importantly, I need to thank my parents Russell E. Morris and 
Geraldine M. Morris and my three guide dogs Annie, Vinnie and Ludo, who have all 
made the journey with me. Thank you so much for making this possible.

Preface 
The origin of this project goes back more than a decade to when I was working in the 
Ancient World Mapping Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on 
what was then called The Blind Audio Atlas and Tactile Mapping System (BATS). 
While I was there, Tom Elliott, who was then the Director of the center, gave me a copy 
of Oswold Dilkes book The Roman Land Surveyors (1971) to read, knowing that I was 
interested in doing a PhD in Ancient History at some point. Reading Dilkes work 
started me thinking about surveying, geography and cartography in the Roman world. 
When the BATS Project came to an end in 2004, circumstances did not allow me to 
undertake a PhD at the time; thus, I went on to do other things. However, the Roman 
land surveyors stayed with me and my interest increased, after I discovered Brian 
Campbells Writings of the Roman Land Surveyors. 
In 2007, a friend of mine, who knew that I was doing some work on Roman 
surveyors and the Roman army in my spare time, suggested that I put an abstract 
together for the Classical Association of Englands Annual Conference, which was 
scheduled to be held in Liverpool. I was apprehensive about it, since I did not even have 
my Masters Degree at that point. However the abstract was accepted and I went to the 
conference, where several people were interested in what I had to say. The end result of 
that trip was that I ended up writing a Masters thesis at Victoria University of 
Wellington on the social history and Latin vocabulary for surveyors and surveying in 
the Later Republic. At the end of that project, I was interested in moving on to look at 
the surveyors in the Principate with some idea of considering the role of surveyors in

Introduction 
But when aging Saturn held sway over the world, 
the Earth hid all her wealth in deep darkness. 
She stored bronze and silver, gold and heavy iron 
among the shades; there were no ingots then. 
Then she gave better things - crops without a curved ploughshare 
and fruit and sweet honey found in the hollow oak-tree. 
No one split the earth asunder with the strong plows blade, 
the surveyor did not mark out the land with a boundary, no one swept the 
churning sea with a dipping oar; 
the furthest mortal journey ended at the shore...3 
Immediately every kind of wickedness erupted into this age of baser 
natures: truth, shame and honour vanished; in their place were fraud, deceit, 
and trickery, violence and pernicious desires. They set sails to the wind, 
though as yet the seamen had poor knowledge of their use, and the ships 
keels that once were trees standing amongst high mountains, now leaped 
through uncharted waves. The land that was once common to all, as the light 
of the sun is, and the air, was marked out, to its furthest boundaries, by wary 
surveyors. Not only did they demand the crops and the food the rich soil 
owed them, but, they entered the bowels of the earth, and excavating 
brought up the wealth it had concealed in Stygian shade, wealth that incites 
men to crime. Now, harmful iron appeared and gold, more harmful than 
iron.   War came, whose struggles employ both, waving clashing arms with 
bloodstained hands.4 
0.1 Historical Context 
For the poet Ovid, writing in the age of Augustus, surveying was an act that created 
order out of the violence of human chaos. He associated it with the establishment of 
limites for property, agriculture, and technology, borne of Mans fall from a state of 
grace in the Golden Age, when there was neither need for technology to overcome the 
natural world nor for artificial constraints on human conduct. 
The Earth and the Gods took care of all mortal needs. Then came the fall and 
with it the moral depravity that caused all manner of suffering. The only way to stop the

violence was for a single person to gather the reins of power into their hands and 
establish moral and physical boundaries.5 For Ovid and his contemporaries, Augustus 
was that individual. Yet, the task was not a straightforward one, since Augustus had to 
forge a new political consensus out of the remnants of the old Republican institutions to 
provide for the stability Ovid and his contemporaries expected. However, as he had to 
find a way to settle thousands of veterans discharged after the wars, he stabilised the 
traditional systems of land tenure, forming the very foundations of the Roman economy 
and creating a system for resolving interstate and local disputes.6 To accomplish this 
objective, Augustus adopted and drastically altered several of the institutions, which had 
developed in the period from the Second Punic War through to the Dictatorship of his 
adoptive father Julius Caesar. 
Under the Republic, disputes over boundaries or land between private land-
holders were resolved either through informal arbitration or before a local court 
competent to try the matter.7 Interstate disputes were resolved using the system of 
arbitration, worked out in the period following the death of Alexander the Great, under 
the direction of a Roman consul or proconsul, who was appointed by the Senate for the 
task.8 Until Tiberius Gracchus established his land commission in 133 BC, every colony 
was established by a lex appointing triumviri or a board of three magistrates of 
praetorian or consular rank and individual allotments were assigned over a wider area 
by decemviri or boards of ten.9 
There is little evidence to show who implemented the instructions of these 
boards, though Claude Nicolet has shown that each board had a body of equites, who 
served as finitores under their direction.10 The actual work of taking measurements and 
planting markers was probably left to veteran soldiers, who were used to doing such 
work while on campaign.11 Beginning with the Gracchan land commissions, however, 
deductores began to be able to establish more than one colonial foundation and seem to

have started to employ Greek technical specialists from Magna Graecia, called 
geometrai to carry out the work of surveying.12 
 In the years following Sullas dictatorship and the colonial program he 
introduced to punish the Italian communities who stood against him, surveying, and 
those who did it, became increasingly divisive and politicised as social changes began 
to be felt within Roman society.13 Clear signs of this can be seen in the political 
iconography that appeared on coinage in the period from Pompeys second consulship 
through to the battle of Actium, where Roman politicians used the image of the groma 
or surveyors cross, and the decempeda, or surveyors measuring rod as symbols to 
celebrate the foundation of colonies or the reorganisation of territorial land belonging to 
the Italian municipia (Fig. 0.1-02).14 
More importantly, the coinage attests to what Andrew Wallace-Hadrill has 
termed a knowledge revolution. That is, a social transformation in which the control of 
specialised knowledge and the power it granted shifted from a privileged group of 
Romes elite citizens to a group of professionals, upon whom political and military 
leaders could draw for control and the maintenance of Empire.15 This was a sociological 
transformation relating to who held power, and how this power was accessed, which 
enabled members of the Italian and provincial elite, as well as plebeians, freedmen and 
even slaves, to participate in the formation of consensus about who had power and what 
it meant to have it. Both Caesar and Octavian rose to prominence on this current of 
change in knowledge discourse, since both depended upon men such as the architect 
Vitruvius, the military supply-contractor P. Ventidius Bassus and the Spanish-born 
surveyor of Samnite stock L. Decidius Saxa. All were able to gain political influence at 
Rome through a literate education and their technical knowledge.16 
Once Octavian secured his position as Augustus, however, he and his top 
advisers changed the discourse of consensus about the role of technicians in the Roman 
world to follow traditional Roman social norms. In the future, work undertaken by

architects or surveyors would be overseen by members of the Roman equestrian and 
senatorial orders, whose ranks would neither include technicians nor would its members 
practice such crafts beyond a level necessary to achieve control.17 To help establish this 
social relationship between surveyors and the Roman political elite, Augustus, his wife 
Livia and supporters, such as Statillius Taurus, sponsored freeborn surveyors and 
invested in a number of slaves, who were trained as surveyors.18 They used these 
surveyors, along with technicians enlisted in the army to reorganise boundaries across 
the Empire, to resolve disputes and carry out engineering projects, which 
simultaneously built up infrastructure and provided information about the Roman 
world.19 
 As the three monumental funerary cippi of Titus Statilius Aper (Fig. 0.3), Lucius 
Aebutius Faustus (Fig. 0.4) and Nicostratus Popidius (Fig. 0.5) show, the surveyors 
themselves freely entered into this imperial consensus.20 Each monument draws on the 
conservative language of traditional Roman funerary practice to honour family and 
patron and employs the same iconography of surveying instruments found on the late 
Republican coinage mentioned above. Indeed, Nicostratus Popidius depended upon the 
iconic power of the groma (Fig. 4.5) as a symbol of the surveyors craft. In particular, 
he did not bother to identify himself as such in the simple inscription adorning the 
funerary stele he set up for himself and his concubine Popidia Ecdoche at some point in 
the half century following the battle of Actium. 
The monument that most fully exemplifies most of the intellectual qualities and 
characteristics of the surveyors considered in this study, however, is that of Statilius 
Aper. According to the reports and photographs taken by Henry Stewart Jones, the 
cinerarium depicts Aper as a tunic-clad man in a toga holding a scroll. To Apers left is 
a locked chest with a cylindrical stand for scrolls on top of it. On the left side in low 
relief are a foot-roll marked off in digiti, a surveyors decempeda or surveying staff, a 
flat box with a sliding lid and a spool to hold Apers surveying cord or chain.21 On the

0.2 Aims, Objectives and the Shape of the Work 
This work is an investigation into the surveyors use of the cultural capital of Roman 
society to fashion their own image and influence the shape of discourse about Empire. 
To narrow the focus of the investigation to a manageable size, four questions will be 
explored, as follows: 
1) First, what was the nature of the relationship between the surveyors or agrimensores 
and the Roman provincial administration? 
2) Second, what was the nature of the relationship between the agrimensores and the 
people of the Empire, whose lands they surveyed? Particular emphasis will be 
placed on the population of the Roman provinces and frontier regions, but because 
of the nature of the available evidence some discussion will also be devoted to the 
surveyors in Italy. 
3) Third, how did the surveyors validate their activities as technical specialists, and 
under what circumstances did the agrimensores undertake surveying work? The 
focus of this discussion will be on practical and theoretical practices, implemented 
by surveyors in the field, in order to structure the relationships between individual 
land-holders or between land-holders and either local or imperial administrators. 
The discussion of this question will touch on topics that include boundary disputes 
and the problematic issue of whether or not the agrimensores were involved in the 
collection of cartographic information and the production of maps. 
4) Fourth, how and to what extent did the activities of the surveyors influence the 
relationship between imperial administrators and the provincial populations by 
shaping their understanding and experience of Empire?

The study is structured around four thematic chapters that reflect main categories 
of inquiry, with each chapter broken down into a number of subsections, which have 
been set out in the table of contents. The first chapter explores the socio-cultural 
relationship that existed between the surveyor and the Roman provincial administrators, 
who were so frequently their immediate superiors and employers. It considers the 
circumstances under which a proconsul, legate or procurator might choose to employ a 
surveyor, and the reasons for that choice. It also investigates exactly where a proconsul, 
legate or procurator could locate a competent surveyor. 
 The Chapter Two looks at what a surveyor had to do in order to establish his 
identity and how he went about proving his qualities on the job. The emphasis here is on 
the practical and theoretical aspects of knowledge which an informed member of the 
public might expect a surveyor to demonstrate during the course of a survey, and the 
impact of those skills and procedures on the documentation of a survey to both the local 
and imperial level. It also considers how the surveyor could apply his knowledge base 
to influence human conduct and perceptions of the wider world over the long-term. 
 Chapter Three explores how surveyors were introduced to the provincial 
populations of the Empire and the impact that they had on the development of culture 
and civilisation in the provinces. The chapter focuses first on the nature of Roman 
boundaries and land ownership in order to establish exactly what it was that the Roman 
administration expected the surveyors to achieve in establishing boundaries. Then, it 
investigates points of contact between the Roman administration and provincial 
populations, in which the actions of the agrimensores would provide a positive 
incentive for the subject populations to adopt Roman surveying and surveyors for 
themselves. Finally, the chapter looks at how the provincial population both resisted the 
activities of Roman surveyors and used surveyors to resist the Roman administration. 
 Chapter Four reconsiders the role that surveyors played in the exploration and 
conquest of territory outside the direct control of Rome and their place within the 
Roman army. It pays particular attention to the tasks which the surveyors carried out 
while the Roman army was on campaign, and the impact of their activities on the 
imperial administrations own conception of the Empire. Some attention is also given to

the impact of the surveyors activities on the non-Roman communities, which the 
legions encountered while on campaign, when the available evidence will allow it. 
 All four of these chapters are supported by five appendices, which are located in 
a separate volume. These appendices, whose organisation is set out in the introduction 
to that volume, contain the two hundred inscriptions and sixty-two images that form 
roughly half of the evidence considered in the discussion. For convenience, the 
footnotes refer to the inscriptions by their entry numbers in the second volume with 
notations, as follows: App. 1.10 refers to the tenth entry in Appendix One. The figures 
in Appendix Five will be referenced within the body of the text by the abbreviation 
(Fig.), followed by a chapter and item number used to organise the images. For 
example, (Fig. 0.4) cited above, refers to the fourth image associated with the 
introduction set out in Appendix Five, while (Fig. 4.5) refers to the fifth figure 
associated with Chapter Four in that appendix. 
0.3 The Evidence and Scholarly Context for the Corpus Agrimensorum 
The evidence for any study on the Roman surveyors is diverse and fragmentary. This is 
one of the main reasons that they have not featured in the mainstream of scholarship, 
particularly amongst Anglophone scholars. The collection of literary documents, known 
as the Corpus Agrimensorum, was first edited and published by Karl Lachmann in 
1848.23 However, Mommsen considered his monumental text to be very unsatisfactory 
and published a full account of the problems he had identified in 1895.24 In the same 
year Max Weber published his influential and ground-breaking study of the Roman 
agrarian economy, drawing on the texts of the Corpus Agrimensorum for some of his 
most fundamental arguments.25 
To cope with many of the problems that Mommsen identified in the text of 
Lachmann, a fresh editorial venture was partially published by Carl Thulin at the start of 
the twentieth century.26 This edition, which carried the text of just four of the authors 
listed in the Corpus Agrimensorum, namely Julius Frontinus, Siculus Flaccus, Agennius

Urbicus and the various works attributed to Hyginus, remained the standard scholarly 
text for the works of the Roman land surveyors until very recently. In response to 
pressure from a number of French and German scholars, the European Commission 
began publishing fresh copies of individual authors from the Corpus with refined 
critical apparatus in the early 1990s. The most important of these publications for this 
study is that of the surveyor Balbus, edited by Jean-Yves Guillaumin.27 
Guillaumin, along with J. Brian Campbell, has also gone on to re-edit, translate 
and produce commentaries for the works of Frontinus, the anonymous work known as 
the De Commentaria, Siculus Flaccus and the works of Hyginus, which both editors 
have divided into Hyginus I and Hyginus II to distinguish between a number of stylistic 
and textual differences in the works under that authors name.28 Campbell has also 
produced texts of works from the Corpus by Balbus, Agennius Urbicus and of a work 
known as the Liber Coloniarum. The text of Frontinus, Flaccus and the works attributed 
to Hyginus will be used for this study, as the textual tradition has been established on a 
fairly stable foundation by Campbell and Guillaumin. Balbus and Urbicus will also 
feature prominently in the discussion, particularly in Chapters Two and Four. 
However, it needs to be admitted that the texts of these two authors are far from 
fully edited. Eric Bholin has recently suggested a number of emendations to the text of 
Balbus work on geometric surveying, based on his work on the writings of Euclid.29 
Likewise, Klaus Geus has suggested seven amendments to an important section of the 
text written by Urbicus.30 Most of the suggestions seem to be worthy of adoption, but 
scholarly consensus about these suggestions has yet to be reached. I have attempted to 
take the suggestions of both Bholin and Geus into consideration when interpreting or 
translating both of these authors but there have been points where a clear choice did not 
seem possible. In such moments, I have deferred to the text of Campbell as the most 
recent and canonical edition of the Corpus Agrimensorum in the Anglophone 
community.

Only one other text from the Corpus Agrimensorum needs to be mentioned here, 
and that is the work on practical surveying techniques written by Junius Nipsus, which 
has recently been edited and translated by Jella Bouma.31 While Boumas edition of this 
badly fragmented work is a great improvement on that of Lachmann, it is far from 
stable and could stand further study. However, extensive philological investigation of 
the sort which the text of Nipsus deserves is outside the scope of the research questions, 
set for this doctoral project and will not be undertaken here. The work is primarily used 
in this study because it, along with the writings of Balbus, constitute the only 
descriptions of surveying procedures carried out in the field that were described by 
practicing surveyors to survive from antiquity. This makes them invaluable for any 
discussion on practical surveying, regardless of the state of the text. 
Beyond the core authors listed here, there are a number of other fragmentary 
works reported by Lachmann or Campbell. These texts, however, have not received the 
same level of scholarly attention and their editorial state makes it problematic to use 
them for analysis in the context of this project. A further complication in using any parts 
of the Corpus Agrimensorum, other than those discussed here, is the recent discovery of 
several new fragments of the Corpus. In 2011, Mario Petoletti discovered a small 
fragment of the Corpus in the Biblioteca di Petrarca, and in 2014, at a lecture given at 
Oxford University, Oriol Olesti-Vila announced the discovery of a new ninth-century 
manuscript, containing fragments of the Corpus Agrimensorum describing the 
geography of Roman Spain.32 
These new fragments will certainly change our understanding of the Corpus 
Agrimensorum, once their authorship has been determined and the text fitted into the 
present canon of writings. Within the context of the present study, however, only a 
select range of authors will be used. They include the writings of Frontinus, Balbus, 
Junius Nipsus, Siculus Flaccus, Agennius Urbicus and the writings attributed to 
Hyginus. These works have been chosen because, in addition to having some aspect of 
consensus about the text of each author, there is growing agreement that all of the works 
in this assemblage, with the possible exception of Agennius Urbicus, were produced in 
the period between 80 and 284 AD, with the majority written before the death of 
31 Bouma (1994).

0.4 Forms of Evidence outside the Corpus Agrimensorum 
Other than the texts of the Agrimensores themselves, there are seven other sources of 
evidence that will be employed in the study: diagrammatic figures from the Medieval 
manuscripts of the Corpus Agrimensorum, Classical literature, inscriptions, papyri, 
coins, the bronze or marble cadastral maps, aerial photographs and the material 
evidence provided by archaeological field surveys or excavations. 
The first of these types, the illustrations from the Codex Arcerianus produced in 
the sixth or seventh century AD, represent a particularly complex problem. Until very 
recently, they have been treated as an art-historical problem. In 1967, however, Oswold 
Dilke made an initial study of the illustrations, which demonstrated that many of the 
diagrams were integrated directly into the text in such a way as to generate a sustained 
discourse between written text and pictorial image.34 Beginning with Reviel Netzs 
study of mathematical diagrams, scholars have taken an increased interest in the 
embedded dialectic relationship between texts and the illustrations or artistic 
monuments, which were created to accompany them.35 
In particular, Michael Squire has developed a detailed methodology for looking 
at the interplay between inscriptions and paintings from the Roman world.36 But, as 
Steffen Bogen has observed, interpreting the technical illustrations in Medieval Greek 
and Latin manuscripts of ancient technical literature faces the double difficulty that one 
needs first to establish whether or not the illustration was originally intended to 
accompany the text and then establish the probability that the image was properly

manuscript reflects the scribes understanding of the work, as much as or more than any 
attempt to copy something from antiquity. Some effort has been made to grapple with 
this problem in Chapter Two, where the illustrations found in the manuscripts of Balbus 
and Frontinus play an important role in the interpretation of the surveyors production 
of formae or maps. Much of my interpretation has been anticipated by the work of 
Delphine Acolat and Courtney Roby.38 I have also attempted to incorporate their ideas 
into my own interpretation of the documents as far as possible, though this is not an 
easy class of evidence with which to grapple. 
Another source of evidence, which is far easier to interpret, even though it is still 
fraught with difficulties, is the vast body of Greek and Latin literature. These sources 
were largely written by the Roman political elite and reflected this groups 
understanding of the world. Many of these texts, however, particularly scientific works, 
such as those written by Aristotle, Euclid, Archimedes, Hero of Alexandria, Ptolemy 
and Galen, provide important context for the surveyors world view. Above all, it was 
these authors, as much as works such as the writings of Ovid or Virgil, that formed the 
core of their education and preparation for work in the field.39 In addition, several 
members of the Roman political elite, like Frontinus, Cicero, Varro and perhaps 
Apuleius were first-hand witnesses of Roman field surveys, thus as Serafina Cuomo has 
observed, they can provide a wealth of detail from the non-specialists point of view.40 
Another body of evidence, which has already been mentioned and which will be 
at the core of this study, are inscriptions. These documents are what Greg Woolf, John 
Bodel and Werner Eck have discussed as the monumental writing specific to the Roman 
epigraphic culture.41 Within this sociological practice, people sought to enshrine their 
identity by monumentalising a text, which was bound to their personal identity through 
nomenclature. As will be seen later in this study, an inscribed name established identity 
and bounded an individual perpetually to a place or event, since any given event in the 
Roman annalistic historical tradition was bound to a moment in time and to the place 
where it happened.

Thus, each inscription was a monument which immortalised either the individual 
who created the text or the subject named in the text (and in many cases both). As 
monuments, inscriptions also mediated power relationships between groups and 
individuals, since, as Susan Alcock has observed, the creation of a monumental text 
tends to shape the collective memory about both events and objects.42 This is 
particularly true when the object is embedded in the landscape as a monument in its 
own right, as boundary-markers frequently were. This means that not only the identity 
of the author of an inscription, but also its location or presentation are crucial for 
interpretation and understanding. 
Since many texts, particularly monumental archive walls containing inscribed 
letters from Roman officials, were frequently dismantled and carted off to other 
locations, clear interpretations about authorship and function can be hard to reconstruct. 
Even so, attention to location, authorship and structure will be observed whenever 
possible. Likewise, since the texts, which have survived in stone, metal and wood, tend 
to be badly damaged and amended by modern editors, an attempt has been made here to 
supply not only transcriptions of the key texts, but photographs or drawings wherever 
practical. While it has not been possible to totally avoid using reconstructions of the 
texts, an attempt has been made to minimise problems by using the best texts available, 
cross-referencing and noting damage to monuments.  Inscriptions are the second richest 
source of information on the Roman land surveyors and surveying after the writings in 
the Corpus Agrimensorum. Tom Elliott and I have, between our respective works, 
assembled roughly two hundred and fifty inscriptions, illustrating the life and work of 
the Roman surveyors.43 
If inscriptions loom large in this study, papyrological documents and coins do 
not. Apart from the two coins cited above in this introduction, the only coins which 
contribute anything to the understanding of the Roman surveyors are a few issues of 
Trajan, depicting bridges discussed in Chapter Four. It would seem that after Actium, 
Augustus discouraged the celebration of colonial foundations or land allocations on 
imperial coinage and the trend took root as part of the social consensus forged at the 
start of the Principate.

 Papyrological documents also play a limited role here for two reasons. First, 
most of the documents come from Egypt, which historically has been treated as a 
separate and rather specialised province of the Roman Empire. Secondly, while many of 
the papyrological documents provide a great deal of detail on land-ownership in Egypt, 
almost none of them provide any information on Roman surveyors or surveying 
procedure. The few papyri used in this study come almost exclusively from Syria and 
illustrate either the role of surveyors in the Roman legions or else they are 
administrative documents, showing the relationship between the Roman administration 
and local land-owners involved in property disputes.44 
One class of evidence, which bridges the categories between the illustrations in 
the Corpus Agrimensorum, inscriptions and archaeology, is formed by the bronze and 
marble fragments of Roman survey plans. Two sets of bronze fragments, one from 
Arausio (Orange) and the other from Lacimurga (Extremadura, Navalvillar de Pela) 
have been found and fully published thus far by archaeologists.45 Three further marble 
fragments are known from Italy, with one coming from Verona and the other two from 
Rome.46 The bronze fragments date to the Flavian period, while the Verona tablet dates 
to the late Republic, and the fragments from Rome date to the Augustan period. The 
Verona, Arausio and Lacimurga tablets all show sections of land divided by lines into 
regular grid squares or centuries. In the case of the fragments from Verona and Arausio, 
the grid units are numbered and each has been assigned an owner, whose name and in 
some cases the status of their land has been inscribed on the tablet. The Lacimurga 
fragment has no names, but in spite of the reservations of Gerard Chouquer, it would 
seem to be a perfectly genuine example of a Roman cadastre.47 The examples from 
Rome on the other hand represent a problem. They depict sections of aqueduct with 
depth measurements and in at least one case the marks of a grid with the names of 
owners abbreviated in each. The physical remains of these fragments, however, have 
been lost and the only surviving text is in the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum edited 
by Mommsen.48 This makes it difficult to establish their authenticity.

In what follows, discussion will focus primarily on the Arausio, Lacimurga and 
to a lesser extent the Verona tablets, because they are the best existing evidence and 
because studying landscape-formation and human settlement around the city of Rome 
introduces a number of very special problems, which cannot be addressed in this work. 
The fragments from Rome will only be referenced when they seem to illustrate a 
general point about land-holding or survey practice, which was applicable to both Rome 
and the provinces. 
 For most scholars, working with these documents involves either studying the 
abbreviated names and numbers on each document to place it into its proper 
sociological and historical context, or else trying to fit the fragments back into the 
landscape, in order to understand how the Romans organised space at a given location.49 
Both approaches have their merits, though the second approach rests upon the 
assumption that the Romans created their monumental aes or bronze cadastres with the 
idea of reproducing the landscape in a document, as modern cartographers might do in 
an inscribed map. However, while a relationship between elements of the landscape and 
features in the documents has been identified, other philosophical or sociological 
conventions seem to have been at work to influence the presentation of what should be a 
familiar landscape in unfamiliar ways.50 To better interpret the documents as reflections 
of the ancient landscape and the Romans understanding of it, scholars have turned to 
aerial photographs and the principles of landscape archaeology. 
The existence of the bronze fragments from Arausio and the discovery of fences, 
stone walls and road systems, forming regular grids around Carthage and in northern 
Italy between 1833 and 1848, prompted scholars to identify and study what have 
become known as cadastral grids or the physical remains of Roman centuries or 
pertica.51 The search for these structures, which dominated studies of Roman surveying 
until recently, was greatly facilitated by the development of aerial photography between 
the two World Wars. These images allowed scholars to identify what seemed to be large 
sections of the landscape, subdivided into squares or rectangles by the remains of

ancient roads or walls that formed what the Corpus Agrimensorum termed limites, a 
word which can be translated as roads or boundaries.52 
However, while the use of aerial photography can identify roads, ditches 
associated with Roman boundaries and military fortifications, it does not establish 
dating or the source of construction for such features.53 In addition, aerial photography 
cannot identify features that have been eroded by modern building projects, 
industrialisation or agriculture, problems which have boosted scholars interest in the 
Arausio and Lacimurga tablets, since almost none of the limites they depict have 
survived in the landscape.54 More importantly, aerial photography cannot show the 
complex interaction between fines or boundaries of any shape, which were not always 
marked by ditches or roads, and the limites, particularly when they were not marked by 
a road or ditch either, but only existed as points listed in a Roman survey document. 
The distinction between these two types of boundaries will become clearer in the course 
of the subsequent discussion. 
 To overcome the limits of aerial photography, archaeologists first turned to maps 
drawn up in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in the hopes of finding features, 
which have long since vanished. As Rick Bonnie, Helena Abreu de Carvalho and Florin 
Fodorean have all recently demonstrated, such maps can be very informative when 
combined with historical records of land-holding.55 All three archaeologists have used 
evidence of this sort to explore the transformation of landscapes in the European 
provinces from the Roman period through to the sixteenth century. However, if a 
scholar in examining such maps and records attempts to establish boundaries and the 
structural identity of the ancient landscape without autopsy, there is the very real danger 
that a modern bias can be introduced into the results of any study. 
The evidence of maps, records and aerial photographs can only be established 
through the rigorous autopsy of selected sites using field-walking, excavation and 
laboratory analysis of soil for botanical and chemical residues, taken from controlled 
core samples. A number of recent field projects, undertaken in France, Spain and

Northern Italy, illustrate both the value and importance of combining these various 
procedures through careful documentation of findings.56 Two particularly strong 
examples of this practice are the project published by Philippe Leveau in 2012, who 
used wetland archaeology to reconstruct the course of the aqueduct and field systems 
outside of Arles, and the Wadi Faynan landscape survey recently synthesised by David 
Mattingly.57 In both projects careful recording of features found in the field, maps, 
Global Positioning System data and environmental evidence, obtained through 
laboratory testing of strategically collected soil samples, allowed the archaeologists to 
reconstruct the development of a regional landscape. In what follows some of this data 
will be used along with aerial photographs of sites, where fieldwork has been done to 
illuminate the activities of the Roman surveyors out in the field. 
 A further source of archaeological data, which needs to be considered, is the 
evidence on the surveyors themselves. Excavations at both Pompeii (Italy) and Mainz 
(Germany) have unearthed what scholars have interpreted as a series of surveying 
instruments, which include the parts of a groma or surveyors cross, foot rules, the ends 
of decempeda or surveying rods, writing implements and perhaps a portable sundial.58 
The standard reconstruction of these implements was presented by Matteo Della Corte 
in 1922 and it went unchallenged until Thorkild Schioler discovered that there were 
gaps and contradictions in the records documenting the finds Della Corte used for his 
presentation.59 
Drawing on the evidence of images on the coins and in the relief sculptures, 
discussed above as a guide to the tools, practices and identities of the surveyors, much 
as John R. Clarke did in his book on art in the daily lives of the Romans, Schioler 
suggested an alternative reconstruction for the groma.60 This shattered the consensus 
about both the instruments and procedures that surveyors used in the field; both Michael 
Lewis and John Poulter have spent the last twenty years unravelling the literary,

0.5 Chronological Limitations and Theoretical Considerations 
There is an abundance of material for the study of Roman land surveyors from a variety 
of sources. Because of this diversity in source material, this project will employ a 
synthetic approach, which will integrate literary, epigraphic and archaeological 
evidence into a fuller picture of the surveyors activities.62 
 The chronological limits will be firmly set in the period from the rise of 
Augustus to the death of Alexander Severus. The starting point is justified in two ways. 
First, while the Romans did use surveying to define space under the Republic, and even 
seem to have thought about the control of territory in terms of inside and outside 
space, they did not associate the terms imperium or provincia with a territorial empire.63 
As a consequence, even when individual Roman officials, such as Lucius Rossius 
Fabatus (Fig. 0.2) or Julius Caesar, employed surveyors to structure the landscape of 
individual communities, they did so as individual patrons or at most as representatives 
of the Roman senate, operating on a limited scale. Prior to Augustus principate, there 
was no centralised notion of Empire as an institution. The concept that Tim Whitmarsh 
and Clifford Ando have termed the universalising tendency, where all peoples of the 
Roman world were conceptualised as equals under the authority of an all-powerful 
princeps, only came to be through the social consensus, forged by Augustus during his 
long reign as emperor.64 Thus, while surveyors undoubtedly had an impact upon those 
whose land they measured, they could not have played a role in the formation of a 
relationship between the provincial populations and a centralised imperial 
administration. 
The end point for this study can be justified by the fact that, after the death of 
Alexander Severus, some rather dramatic social changes in Roman society began to take

place, as the Roman world worked its way through the violence of the third century 
crisis.65 While there was doubtless continuity between the world of Severans and that of 
Constantine, there can be no doubt that substantial changes also took place. The 
investigation of the impact that those changes indisputably had upon the surveyors and 
their role in Roman society, would represent a study in its own right, just as considering 
the differences in the impact surveyors had on society under the Hellenistic kingdoms of 
Alexanders successors and the Roman Empire would. 
The concept of the universalising tendency, whereby the imperial administration 
promulgated the image of a world order where all peoples were part of a hierarchy of 
graded equals under an emperor, raises the question of Romanisation, since the concept 
lends itself to a paradigm where the Romans exported their concept of culture out to the 
provinces.66 To see the universalising tendency in this light, however, is to both 
misunderstand that tendency and to reintroduce a modern concept, which, as Greg 
Woolf, Simon James and David Mattingly have all argued, is unhelpful and overly 
simplistic.67 The notion, much like the concept of the Romans Burden introduced by 
Andrew Fear in 2011, places the emphasis of choice on the Romans, reflecting a state-
oriented responsibility to change a less advanced civilisation, where most of the 
population is the same and all that differs is the degree to which individuals are willing 
to accept the benefactions of their imperial superiors.68 While some members of the 
Roman elite may have felt that they had a mission to civilise the peoples of the world as 
Fear has remarked, it is doubtful that all saw things in this way or that there was any 
over-riding objective for the Empires administrators to actively pursue any such 
course, since the hallmark of Roman administration was the process of petition and 
response.69 
 As will be seen in Chapter One of the thesis, Roman administrators, who 
certainly considered themselves as superior to the provincial population, tended to wait 
for the provincial population to petition the Roman administrators for assistance before 
acting. When they did not, it was either because they saw an opportunity to gain the

good will of a selective group or else because a given group initiated a challenge to the 
authority of the emperor and his representatives. The universalising tendency was a 
Roman means of placing people into identifiable social or legal categories to facilitate 
an unequal discourse of power, especially amongst those who were competing for the 
favour of the central administration.70 This competition was constructed through and 
regulated by interaction between the peoples of the provinces, all of whom occupied 
various grades of inequality under the emperor and the imperial administrators. Each 
group within the Empire responded to the administration both in terms of their 
individual perception of the Romans and based on their own sense of cultural identity. 
 Recently, Andrew Wallace-Hadrill put forward the concept of code switching as 
a base for the formation of social identity.71 Within this system, an individual or group 
chooses cultural characteristics to project a specific identity, depending on the social 
context within which they find themselves and the message they wish to convey to 
others. As cognitive linguists and biological anthropologists have shown, the 
components comprising individual and collective choices in presentation, interaction 
and performance involved: language, dress, bearing and the encoded understanding of 
ones relationship to the environment.72  
Language, which includes mathematics, was a mechanism for encoding human 
experiences, like a computer code, where each language has its own expressions and 
requirements. The language one choses and the way one chooses to use it determine 
social relationships, as does the way in which one moves. Specific occupations, as well 
as upbringing in peculiar locations, engender distinctive ways of movement. As will be 
seen, the surveyors used specific styles of movement and particular ways of speaking to 
engage with people from a variety of different social backgrounds and cultures about 
the organisation of land, using mathematics and a preconceived set of encoded 
categories. 
The choices others made about how they interacted with those encoded 
categories, as well as their interaction with the landscape, shaped individual and

collective understandings of a place within the world and the manipulation of the 
identity of a place helped to shape social identity and relationships to the wider world. 
At the core of this discussion is the principle put forward by Gerard Chouquer in 2010, 
whereby land or indeed any physical body, is defined by the agency of human 
occupation and the establishment of identity for and control of use and the recognition 
of that use or ownership by others.73 The Roman land surveyors were individuals who 
had an identity as experts of the regulation and organisation of such relationships 
through the deployment of specific skills. This work is a study of those skills and the 
discourse they shaped.

Chapter One: All the Proconsuls Men: The Agrimensores 
and Roman Provincial Administration 
Consider, Lord, whether or not you believe it necessary to send a surveyor 
here. For, it seems that quite a bit of money could be recovered from the 
superintendents of the public works, if only those works could be reliably 
surveyed. At any rate I am looking through the accounts of Prusinum, a 
matter that I am managing with the upmost diligence.74 
1.1 Introduction 
This letter, written by Pliny the Younger to the emperor Trajan, is perhaps one of the 
best-known documents connecting surveyors to the administration of the Roman 
provinces. It shows that Roman administrators linked knowledge based on quantifiable 
data to good government, and that surveyors were in many cases the key to obtaining 
that data.75 More importantly still, it reveals that surveying was not simply important for 
the regulation of boundaries and the resolution of disputes, as many modern scholars 
have pointed out, but was crucial for assessing building projects and regulating public 
works.76 But, even when scholars take the evidence of surveying in contexts other than 
boundary disputes into consideration, they rarely bother to consider the socio-cultural 
relationship that doubtless existed between the surveyor and his senatorial or equestrian 
superior.77 This chapter will focus directly on that relationship. It will consider the 
circumstances under which a proconsul, legate or procurator might choose to employ a 
surveyor, and the reasons for that choice. It will also investigate exactly where a 
proconsul, legate or procurator could locate a competent surveyor. In doing so, the 
chapter will tackle head on the question of just how typical Plinys letter to Trajan 
might have been. As a final point, the chapter will consider some of the tasks the 
surveyors carried out for the Roman civil administration in the provinces.

1.2 A Question of Knowledge: The Problem of Evidence 
Understanding and assessing the relationship between the various senior administrators 
of the Roman provinces and the surveyors is complicated by two factors. First, the 
surveyors writing in the Corpus Agrimensorum rarely mention any source of imperial 
authority other than the emperor.78 For the surveyors, it would seem that the Roman 
Empire comprised various communities of differing legal status and the figure of the 
emperor, under whom all communities were more or less equal. This worldview, termed 
the universalising tendency by some scholars, formed part of a larger dialogue about 
social identity in the Roman world and was not unique to the surveyors.79 However, the 
surveyors use of the universalising tendency reflects direct engagement with imperial 
policy as it was made manifest through inscribed pronouncements and edicts.80 This 
engagement, along with the surveyors activities in creating roads and boundaries, 
placed them at the centre of the conversation about the nature of the Roman Empire.81 
This is something that will receive more attention elsewhere in this study. 
The second part of the problem is that most of the epigraphic monuments 
recording surveying operations involving proconsuls, imperial legates or procurators do 
not bother to mention the surveyors or their role. This is because the vast majority of 
surveying monuments were set up by notable members of a community to celebrate and 
immortalise local achievements brought about by surveyors.82 Monuments not set up by 
local magistrates were usually commissioned by imperial magistrates or the emperor 
himself.83 Neither the local elites nor members of the imperial administration, when 
commissioning such monuments, showed much interest in the lives, personalities and 
technical activities of the surveyors who made their success possible. Even when a 
monument does mention a surveyor for one reason or another, it is often difficult to 
properly interpret the relationships because the terminology used by the Romans

themselves for surveyors and surveying operations was frequently inexact and changed 
over.84 
Fortunately, three sets of epigraphic documents have survived. They mention 
surveyors in a context where their identity can be partially established and their 
relationship to the Roman magistrates studied in context with the civic cultures of the 
Empire: a set of four letters in Greek and Latin inscribed into the wall of the cella of the 
Temple of Zeus at Aizanoi in Asia Minor; the record of a boundary dispute between the 
Thessalian communities of Lamia and Hypata; and a funerary cippus set up by the 
surveyor Nonius Datus in Lambaesis in Numidia to celebrate the completion of an 
aqueduct at the neighbouring city of Saldae.85 
The first and last of these documents are well published and have been studied 
several times over the last forty years. However, they have never been studied together 
and only rarely have they been examined for what they can tell us about the surveyors 
involved. Here we will consider all three monuments against a backdrop of evidence 
from a range of literary sources to explore the relationship between these technicians 
and the Roman emperors most senior representatives. 
1.3 A Question of History: Quietus and the Problem of Temple-Land 
at Aezanoi 
In the year 126 AD, Avidius Quietus, the Roman proconsul of Asia Minor, intervened in 
a long-running property dispute involving several factions within the Hellenistic city of 
Aizanoi, modern avdarhisar (Fig. 1.1).86 The record of his intervention, consisting of a 
series of letters in both Latin and Greek, was inscribed in an elaborate frame on one 
wall of the cella of the Temple of Zeus (Fig. 1.2).87 These documents reveal how 
Quietus chose to deploy surveyors to resolve the conflict and preserve order in Aizanoi, 
as well as showing many of the complications faced by Roman administrators when

trying to resolve property or boundary disputes within a community. Little is known 
about how the dispute at Aizanoi started. From the inscribed documents and a series of 
Roman boundary markers found around the temple, it would seem that a Hellenistic 
monarch named Attalus donated a large tract of land to the Temple of Zeus at some 
point in the mid to late third century BC.88 At some later date, another Hellenistic 
monarch named Prusias took the land and divided it into allotments called cleroi for 
military veterans.89 
Since Zeus technically owned the land, it is likely that Prusias, in order to avoid 
a charge of impiety, had the veterans pay rent to the temple.90 In the period from the end 
of the third century BC to the start of the second century AD, the practice of paying rent 
seems to have fallen into abeyance.91 Someone, perhaps the chief priest of the temple, 
either attempted to reinstate the rents at the start of Hadrians reign, or else invented this 
story in order to levy rents from those living on the land around the temple. 
The Latin letter from Hadrian to Quietus (Fig. 1.3) suggests that a delegation 
from Aizanoi petitioned Gaius Trebonius Proculus Medius Modestus, proconsul in 119 
AD, to rule on the question of whether or not the vectigal or rent was owed by the land-
holders living around the temple.92 He apparently decided that the rent did indeed have 
to be paid, introducing a fresh set of problems since the exact boundaries of the 
individual properties could no longer be identified.93 To avoid having the dispute 
degenerate into rioting and civil unrest, it is quite possible that Avidius Quietus 
intervened pre-emptively in 126 AD, as Christina Kokkinia suggests in her 2004 
article.94 However, while Roman administrators did interfere in municipal affairs from 
time to time, most administrative matters in the Empire were managed through the 
principles of petition and response.95 As a consequence, governors tended to only act 
when asked to do so by a community or when the emperor ordered them to do so

directly.96 If a governor acted on his own initiative and his course of action proved 
unpopular with the provincial population, a community could appeal the matter to either 
the senate or emperor at Rome.97 This was a course of action, which as will be seen in a 
later chapter, a number of well-organised communities followed when resisting the 
reorganisation of their lands by the provincial authorities. 
Imperial conventions apart, the internal evidence from the letters between 
Quietus, Hesperus and Hadrian suggest that the entire affair was conducted by envoys 
representing the municipal government and the tenants of the land, rather than the 
Temple of Zeus and the landholders.98 While the municipal government and land-
holders might seem the logical parties to enter into litigation based on the nature of civic 
politics in the Roman Empire, the matter is not so clear in this case since the rents being 
levied were due to the city, but the money primarily benefited the temple priesthood.99 
In addition, the letter of Quietus to the people of Aizanoi (Fig. 1.4) shows that the 
principal issue at stake was not the boundaries between individual property-owners, but 
rather how much each landholder should pay per allotment held, and the date from 
which rent should be calculated.100 This was essentially a legal matter, which was 
outside the surveyors competency.101 For, while the surveyors were concerned with the 
law, they were not jurists and only became involved in a court case when their craft was 
necessary for the application of the law to the resolution of a dispute.102 It is this 
distinction in the surveyors role in administrative affairs which explains why Quietus 
only employed surveyors after he wrote to Hadrian and discovered that he was unable to 
implement the resolution, which, in his own account, Hadrian ordered him to apply.103  
This resolution entailed establishing a Golden Mean based on the average size of

allotments at other cities around Aizanoi, which could be used to fix the rate of payment 
artificially.104 
It is important to recognise that Quietus never states that Hadrian ordered him to 
employ surveyors and that neither Quietus nor the emperor Hadrian mentions them in 
their correspondence. The fact that surveyors were eventually called upon by the 
competent magistrate in the case shows that the nature of a court case could change and 
that surveyors often came on stage late in an affair to cope with a matter that was central 
to surveying, but tangential to a larger problem.105 This was certainly true in the case of 
Aizanoi. But, before considering the specific circumstances behind why surveyors were 
required in this particular case, it is worth pausing to explore how a governor chose to 
employ surveyors and where a governor could turn to acquire them. 
1.4 The Quandary of Quietus: Where to Find a Surveyor 
The decision to call in surveyors ultimately rested with the competent magistrate on the 
spot. However, there were instances where the emperor could and did order provincial 
magistrates to seek out and employ surveyors to resolve a specific problem, such as the 
case of the proconsul Augurinus considered below.106 But, even when the emperor 
issued an order for a provincial magistrate to employ surveyors, the final choice as to 
who and how to deploy them in a legal context, still remained with the acting imperial 
magistrate on site, and was based on a consensus of opinion from amongst his concilium 
or advisory council.107 The concilium was principally composed of a magistrates amici 
(friends) and clientes (clients), most of whom were wealthy men who cannot have 
possessed much specialised legal or surveying knowledge.108 Moreover, while members 
of the imperial elites who served in this capacity unquestionably maintained slaves and 
freedmen trained as surveyors, there is no evidence to show that they deployed their 
personal technical specialists in the service of the Empire.109

To judge from the available documents, most proconsuls, legates, and praetors 
preferred to draw their surveyors from the ranks of the serving legionaries or else from 
amongst the evocati or military reservists recalled to duty. This is most clearly 
demonstrated by the fact that the surveyors named in two of the three cases under 
consideration here were evocati.110 Yet, most of the provinces of the Empire, including 
Asia Minor, did not host a standing legion and the military forces assigned to serve their 
imperial administrators were usually composed of small detachments mainly drawn 
from the auxiliaries.111 Since surveyors rarely served in the non-citizen auxiliary units in 
the period before the late second century AD, and the available number of evocati or 
enlisted legionaries were limited, it is likely that Quietus and other proconsuls had to 
seek their surveyors from elsewhere.112 
One possible alternative source of surveyors to help governors such as Quietus 
may have been the emperor himself. In 1974 Focke Hinrichs advanced the argument 
that surveyors from the Domus Augusti or imperial household were assigned to the 
support staff of provincial administrators.113 Unfortunately, none of the inscriptions 
recording imperial slaves or freedmen who were surveyors show any clear associations 
or references to any element of the Roman imperial administration other than the 
emperor himself.114 Indeed, apart from a single letter of Pliny the Younger, there is just 
one inscription to conclusively show that the emperor ever assigned surveyors to assist a 
proconsul, legate or procurator, and in both of these cases the identity of the surveyor is 
not known.115 It might be argued that the limited number of inscriptions reflecting the 
emperors deployment of surveyors in support of his provincial representatives simply 
reflects the nature of the epigraphic habit and a limited rate of survival. But, Trajans 
reply to the letter of Pliny quoted at the opening of this chapter, makes it abundantly 
clear that he expected his provincial representatives to obtain whatever technical 
support they required without help from Rome.

Furthermore, I barely have enough surveyors for the construction projects 
that are underway at Rome or in its vicinity. But, surveyors are to be found 
in every province, something which one may well depend upon, and for that 
reason, you will not be lacking for one if only you are willing to diligently 
undertake a search.116 
In order for a governor such as Pliny or Quietus to follow up on Trajans 
recommendation, it would have been necessary to first locate and then form a contract 
with a private surveyor as a mensor a iudice adhibitus (surveyor employed as an 
advisor by a judge), much as Tiberius Crassius Fermus, the private arbitrator in the 
dispute at Herculaneum discussed in Chapter Three, did.117 How difficult this may have 
been remains conjectural. If the collegia mensorum existed to provide a reference point 
for locating an independent surveyor or a wealthy patron willing to hire out his slave, 
then Trajan may well have been right in stating that it was simply a matter of looking. 
Otherwise, locating a suitable technician may have been a search for the proverbial 
needle in a haystack. Regardless of the difficulty in hiring, the contractual nature of 
this arrangement obligated the governor to pay a merces, or fixed fee, to the surveyor; 
something that was probably not true for military surveyors or those attached to the 
Domus Augusti.118 Unless the governor wished to pay the merces out of his own pocket, 
it would have been necessary to make arrangements with the provincial procurator for 
official funds.119 This in part explains why Quietus states in his letter that he requested 
the procurator Hesperus to choose qualified surveyors: 
Avidius Quietus, to the magistrates of the city of Aizanoi, the council and 
citizenry, greetings. The controversy concerning the sacred land, which was 
dedicated to Zeus long ago, which has been going on for many years, has 
been resolved thanks to the providence of the greatest emperor, because I 
wrote to him and explained the entire situation, asking him what must be 
done. There were two problems that particularly fuelled the dispute among 
you and represents what is both intractable and difficult to resolve. Having 
mixed justice with humanity, in accordance with the exactitude of his 
judgments, he solved our age-old dispute and mutual suspicion, as you will 
learn from the letter, which he sent to me. I have sent you a copy of the 
letter. I have also written a letter to Hesperus, the Augustan procurator, 
ordering him to choose qualified land surveyors, which he could use to

measure the territory and afterwards there should be only one size of 
allotment for you. And, as I have explained, I issue an order according to the 
sacred rescripts of Caesar, that the rent, which each person must pay for an 
individual allotment according to Modestus decision, from which, as soon 
as you receive this letter, every person will pay in proportion to the amount 
of the sacred land which each possesses. In this way, certain individuals 
may not at some later date litigate about the rent and avoid the responsibility 
for the fact that the city benefits from all rent; in fact, it is enough for them 
to have benefitted until now. I have also sent the copy of the letter to 
Hesperus and a copy of another letter that Hesperus wrote to me. I wish you 
are well.120 
The language employed by Quietus here suggests that local technicians would be 
employed to survey the land at Aizanoi to establish a standard size of allotment for the 
purposes of fixing the rent. But, as the additional documentation Quietus shows (Figs. 
1.5 and 1.6), the version of events Quietus communicated to the Greek speaking 
population of Aizanoi was rather different from what transpired. The differences 
between the Greek letter written to the people of Aizanoi and the Latin letters addressed 
to Hesperus and Hadrian prove Dio Cassius statement that it was often hard to establish 
the true nature of events in the Roman world since any account of a situation always 
reflected the perceptions and interpretations of the author, as well as their choice of 
presentation.121 Like the distinctions that can be identified between the Greek and Latin 
letters, the Latin documents Quietus sent to Hadrian and Hesperus need not have 
contained all the same details in order to be true to the situation on the ground, and yet, 
the differences in presentation may have influenced the ways in which the emperor and 
procurator reacted. This relative presentation of truth was not just present in writing, but 
speech as well formed the essence of Roman rhetoric and it provided an impetus for 
Roman political leaders, administrators and as will be seen in the next chapter, 
surveyors as well to expend some considerable effort in mastering the strategies of 
rhetorical oratory.122 
Several fundamental differences between the highly rhetorical Greek account and 
that found in the official Latin administrative documents stand out and influence any 
attempt to understand the relationships that existed between the various Roman

shows that while local units of land division were to be employed for establishing the 
Golden Mean, the final quantity was to be established not by surveying the land at 
Aizanoi, but, by calculating the average size of allotments at neighbouring cities. In 
addition, Hadrian did not develop this plan of action, as Quietus claims in his letter to 
the people of Aizanoi. His attribution of the plan achieved a crucial political objective: it 
formed the rhetorical strategy that embodied the universalising tendency and created the 
all-important illusion that Quietus and the people of Aizanoi were the subjects of the all-
powerful Hadrian who as emperor could be counted on to resolve any and all problems. 
This illusion was crucial for maintaining Hadrians power as a ruler in the tradition of 
the Hellenistic monarchs of old amongst the cities of Asia Minor. Such universalising 
language was not needed in the administrative letters exchanged between the emperor 
and his deputies or between individual Roman magistrates.123 In such documents, 
Hadrian could speak a different version of the truth, acknowledge his proconsul and 
give credit to Quietus as the person who developed the strategy for the resolution of 
matters at Aizanoi: 
If the size of the subdivision, which they call allotments (cleroi), into which 
the territory dedicated by the kings to Jupiter Aizanoi has been divided, is 
not clear, the best solution, as you also judge, is to heed the measure, which 
is neither the largest nor the smallest of the allotments in the neighbouring 
communities.124 
The second discrepancy between the Latin documentation and the account of 
Quietus lies in who discovered that surveyors were needed to establish the Golden 
Mean. While Quietus takes credit for ordering Hesperus to choose surveyors in his 
Greek letter to create a sense of hierarchy amongst the representatives of Hadrian, the 
text of his letter to Hesperus does not mention surveyors or surveying. The proconsuls 
instructions to Hesperus only require the procurator to find out the average size of 
allotments at other cities in the region.125 It is the fragmentary letter forming the far 
right edge of the inscription (Fig. 1.6), which shows that it was Hesperus who realised 
that the information Quietus needed could only be provided by qualified specialists:

the allotments in the region around the community of the Aizanitiis, I have

1.5 Digging in the Archives: Hesperus and the Registration of 
Provincial Property 
Since there is no evidence to suggest that either Quietus or Hesperus ever spent any 
time in the vicinity of Aizanoi itself, the proconsul presumably expected his procurator 
to supply this information from the records used for tax collection stored in the 
provincial archives.127 However, while Frontinus, Hyginus and Siculus Flaccus 
specifically state that lands delimited and allocated (in other words, surveyed) under the 
direction of the Roman authorities had maps and records detailing matters such as the 
size of allotments filed in the imperial archives, this was not necessarily the case for 
land attached to a community, which was organised using a local system of property 
demarcation.128 Rather, available documentary evidence and regulations recorded in the 
Digest of Justinian show that the forma censualis, or census declaration, provided by 
local land-holders to their municipal magistrates, and which formed the bases of the 
procurators tax rolls, only had to contain the name of the fundus or farmstead, the name 
of its owner, the names of the neighbouring fundi, the general use of the land, and either 
the total amount of land under cultivation or used for pasturage.129 
The size of individual allotments belonging to each fundus was not usually part 
of the information that land-holders were required to supply to their civic magistrates 
during the census process; though some private and municipal archives maintained such 
information for local use.130 The mere fact that Quietus expected Hesperus to be able to 
access such information demonstrates the amount of control Roman magistrates

believed they had or should have over the communities under their jurisdiction.131 
Hesperus inability to supply his superior with the required information, even though he 
enjoyed independent juridical and administrative competence in financial cases and in 
matters of provincial accounting, reflects a very real limitation of the Roman 
administrative system, which may have been overcome only in the fourth century.132 
On the other hand, the archival habits of the Roman administration, which 
scholars have frequently lauded, while imperfectly understood, could generate, copy, 
store, catalogue and authenticate most, if not all, of the documents and information 
generated by the Roman central administration.133 That said, it is doubtful there was 
ever a single centralised archival bureaucracy or archival storage facility at Rome. 
Rather, the Roman archival service remained a decentralised repository of 
administrative information, with the various organs of the Roman government 
maintaining several individual storage facilities in a number of different places, such as 
the Aerarium and the imperial residence itself.134 Each of the different archival centres, 
which were never permanently fixed within a building specifically constructed for the 
purpose, served a different constituency, much as each of the individual standing courts 
served a different juridical function.135 In addition, it is likely that the majority of 
documentation produced by the administrators in each of the provinces remained in 
local archives, with summaries of data collections and only the most important 
documents being filed in one of the facilities at Rome. Thus, by way of illustration, the 
tabularium Principis, mentioned as a source of evidence in the inscription recording the 
dispute between the Galillenses and the Patulcenses on Corsica, was probably the 
emperors personal archive, housing the records of his edicts, decreta, colonial 
foundations and the Book of Benefactions, listing his gifts to various groups and 
individuals.136 It would not have contained the documents recording the court case 
between these two provincial groups.

Since the Roman administration did not establish any permanent provincial 
archives outside Egypt in the period before the reign of Claudius, it is likely that most 
provincial documents remained in the hands of private individuals, in municipal 
archives or in the commentaria of provincial magistrates until the end of the Flavian 
period or later.137 Even when provincial archives were introduced to the provinces, it 
was done in a decentralised and piecemeal manner, reflecting the Roman 
administrations response to what were considered inadequate local systems.138 These 
archives or tabularia never replaced the existing municipal or district archives which 
already existed, but rather functioned much as the Roman court system did, providing 
an added umbrella of administrative record-keeping over the top of numerous existing 
repositories.139 
For the Roman administrators or those commissioned by them, the Roman 
tabularia were the primary repository for documents, but, the extent to which the 
provincial population utilised them depends upon two factors which cannot be 
quantified or qualified based on present evidence. First, the extent to which the 
provincial population utilised the Roman imperial archives was greatly dependent upon 
the extent to which they expected the Roman administration to recognise, safeguard 
and/or support them in local matters. On the other hand, there is the question of just 
how much the local population could access the Roman tabularia provinciarum. At the 
moment, a paucity of evidence makes it almost impossible to state to what extent the 
Augustales running provincial tabularia were willing to copy, authenticate or store 
documents created by the provincial population.140 It is interesting to note, however, 
that while numerous inscriptions and papyrological documents show that provincial 
civic archives stored, promulgated and even monumentalised much of the 
documentation sent down by the imperial administration, the majority of the known 
administrative or juridical documents generated by the provincial population have been 
recovered from private archival contexts.141

If this reflects the provincial populations actual archival practices, rather than a 
survival and recovery sample, then Werner Eck may be correct when he postulates that 
direct contact between the majority of the population of the Empire and the imperial 
administrative staff was quite limited and depended upon personal familiarity with the 
administrative systems of a province, rather than upon formalised networks for 
information sharing.142 A predilection for storing documents in private or municipal 
archives, as well as the absence of formalised networks for sharing information between 
different types of repositories and imperial administrators, would certainly explain the 
problems Hesperus had in obtaining the information Quietus requested. In addition, it 
explains why surveyors were required in so many situations in order to obtain 
information on property or property-ownership in the provinces.143 
Whatever future research into the imperial tabularia might reveal about their 
administration and relationships with municipal archives, the crucial point for our 
discussion here is the limited role they played in acquiring information on municipal 
activities not initiated by the central administration. While procurators such as Hesperus 
possessed independent juridical and administrative competence in financial cases and 
could write to local officials to demand information about land and land-ownership, 
procurators, contrary to the views of G. P. Burton, did not have any more direct access 
to imperial and municipal archives or to qualified surveyors than proconsuls.144 
When a procurator could not obtain such information and did not have direct 
access to the required specialists, in keeping with the division of responsibility 
structuring Roman provincial administration, it was entirely appropriate for someone 
like Hesperus to return the matter to the presiding magistrate in the case. Left to act 
without much direct support from the other elements of provincial administration, 
Quietus would have found it crucial to project an image of imperial solidarity amongst 
all the elements of the imperial administration in order to gain compliance from the 
local population.145

1.6 Words and Actions: A Choice in the Strategic Use of Surveyors 
When considering the range of options open to Quietus in resolving the problems at 
Aizanoi, it is important to remember that every magistrate could deploy surveyors in 
two distinct ways. They could employ them as advisors or investigators, but they could 
also invoke surveyors as a rhetorical topos in public documents and speeches. As 
Werner Eck has argued, letters such as that written by Quietus were intended for public 
consumption.146 They functioned as bridges of communication between the Roman 
administration and the local population that were intended to create an atmosphere of 
solidarity in the face of a particular problem when read aloud at public assemblies.147 To 
accomplish this, the emperor and his magistrates drew on the principles of Hellenistic 
diplomacy and drafted their documents using the language associated with the 
universalising tendency as discussed above.148 In the Greek-speaking regions of the 
Empire at least, invoking the surveyors in this context drew on the cultural capital of 
technical experts acting as impartial advisors in the resolution of inter-state boundary 
disputes to conjure the idea of an exact, quantifiable, rational, and above all, civilised 
solution to an otherwise intractable problem.149 
This meant that, for Quietus, referring to the surveyors in conjunction with all 
the municipal and imperial officials amounted to an authoritative declaration of imperial 
power, patronage and a promise of impartial justice. Commitments of this sort, which 
formed a component of imperial benefaction and patronage, played a key role in 
regulating relations between the Roman imperial government and the provincial 
population.150 The texts from Aizanoi neatly illustrate the complicated conversations 
and rhetorical strategies involved in negotiating the implementation of such a political 
promise. To appreciate the practical contribution the surveyors made in regulating the 
relationships that were crucial to the final resolution of the situation at Aizanoi, it is 
worth leaving the province of Asia to look at two near contemporary cases in the

provinces of Thessaly and Mauretania Caesariensis, where the interactions between the 
Roman magistrates, provincial population and surveyors are clearly visible. 
1.7 Dividing the Thessalians or Marking a Greek Boundary 
It is well established that inter-city boundary disputes were one of the major problems 
facing any Roman provincial magistrate.151 Yet, a stone found in the wall of a house at 
the Greek village of Nyxiapes in 1855 is the only instance where all the participants in 
such a dispute can clearly be seen together. The text on the stone reports a dispute 
between the Thessalian communities of Lamia and Hypata dating to some point 
between 124 and 132 AD.152 The text of the inscription reports the decretum, or final 
verdict, rendered in the case by the proconsul Quintus Gellius Sentius Augurinus: 
The verdict was read aloud from the documents on the Kalends of March 
during the proconsulship of Quintus Gellius Sentius Augurinus: Since the 
best and greatest Princeps Trajan Hadrian Augustus wrote to me that once 
surveyors were consulted concerning the dispute over the boundaries 
between the Lamienses and the Hypataei, and the case investigated, I should 
make a boundary demarcation. And since I was frequently at hand, and on 
successive days, in the present affair, and I investigated it with the 
advocates of both cities present, through my consultation of Julius Victor, 
the surveyor, a veteran of Augustus recalled to service, it is agreed that the 
beginning of the boundary will be at the point where I have discovered (the 
statue of) Side is located, which is just below the enclosure consecrated to 
Neptune. From there, it maintains a straight line descending (the slopes) all 
the way to the Dercynnian spring, which is across the Sperchion River so 
that a straight line cuts through the amphispora of the Lamienses and the 
Hypataei to that afore-mentioned Dercynnian spring. Then it makes for the 
Pelion tomb along the slope of Sir[---] to the Eurytian monument, which is 
inside the boundary of the Lamienses [---].153 
The language of the decretum announced by Augurinus suggests that the two 
communities were involved in revendicatio, or a legal claim on ownership of land 
between two neighbours, rather than an actio finium regundorum, or an action for the 
regulation of boundaries.154 The dispute involved a piece of land referred to in the text 
as amphispora, a term otherwise not attested in Greek or Latin and which may mean 
contested property.

If this interpretation is correct and the amphispora was delimited by some 
system of boundaries recognised under Roman law, then resolving the dispute should 
have meant simply examining local records and/or witnesses to establish who had the 
best claim to the land. However, as the text of the inscription shows, Julius Victor, the 
surveyor in this case, had to run a rigor through the amphispora using localy recognised 
termini, suggesting that the question under consideration was more than just one of 
ownership. It is quite possible that the amphispora was what the agrimensores called 
ager arcifinius, a sort of unbounded public land, the control of which was subject to a 
right of occupation.155 At any rate, the description of the property under dispute and 
divided by Victor was probably open ground suitable for grazing. In addition to 
disputing pasturage on unbounded land, the case may also have involved a servitude or 
right of way for drawing water from either the river or the spring mentioned in the 
text.156 This is indicated by the fact that the rigor drawn by Victor crossed the river, 
touched the spring mentioned and therefore may have blocked one of the cities access 
to water from either the spring or riverbank without a right of way. Because the text is 
broken off at the bottom edge, however, the full extent of the case along with the 
identity of the final winner in the contest must remain the subject of conjecture. 
In spite of this, a close reading of the text reveals several aspects of the 
surveyors role in provincial administration. First, the system of petition and response as 
well as the proconsuls effort to create consensus through the universalising tendency 
present in the texts at Aizanoi are also on display in this case, though with some distinct 
differences. One crucial difference between the two cases is that the role of the emperor 
in resolving the situation between Hypata and Lamia is far less clear. At Aizanoi, 
Hadrian clearly exercised executive oversight and responded to a request for approval 
from Quietus. In the dispute between Hypata and Lamia there is the very real possibility 
that the two cities petitioned the emperor for a resolution to their dispute and that 
Hadrian instructed Augurinus to deal with the matter.157 But, as Tom Elliott has pointed 
out, the inscription itself does not clearly state that Augurinus acted under orders from

Hadrian, but merely that Hadrian had written to advise him that surveyors should be 
consulted in resolving the dispute.158 This suggests that Augurinus was asked to 
adjudicate the dispute and, like Quietus, requested imperial approval and permission to 
Unlike Quietus however, Hadrian directly ordered Augurinus to seek out 
surveyors to help him resolve the matter. Such an instruction suggests that Hadrian 
considered the matter to be both politically significant and complicated. This 
assessment may have been prompted by the fact that other cities in the region, such as 
Melitaia, were known for using what has been referred to as judicial imperialism or the 
manipulation of Roman justice to gain control over the property of others.159 Hadrians 
concern for the maintenance, or at least the seeming maintenance of justice, between the 
two communities may also be reflected in the identity of the surveyor Augurinus 
employed, one Julius Victor, an evocatus Augusti. This description of Victor indicates 
that he was a soldier recently discharged from Hadrians Praetorian Guard. This 
interpretation is prompted by a comparison of Victors titulature with that of Nonius 
Datus, a librator (levelling surveyor), from the city of Lambaesis in Numidia. Datus is 
described as an evocatus Legio III Augusta on his funerary monument, showing that he 
was a soldier who served with the Legio III Augusta and was recalled to duty following 
discharge.160 
Victors unit is not listed in the text of the decretum, an unusual absence that 
suggests his presence in the Praetorians, since such soldiers were close to the emperor, 
and would therefore not need to identify their unit in order to make their presence felt. 
Moreover, Hadrian visited Greece several times between 124 and 132, making the 
presence of discharged members of the Praetorians likely.161 Indeed, if Hadrian had a 
particular interest in either of the litigants here, then the contentious nature of inter-city 
politics may have prompted both the emperor and his proconsul to seek an influential 
surveyor from outside the territory to avoid the social and political pressure civic

magnates could apply to local contractors.162 It is important to remember that a 
demarcation produced through fraud on the part of one of the parties in a dispute such 
as this could have precipitated violence.163 In light of that prospect, a retired member of 
the Praetorians would be a logical choice for the assignment of establishing the 
boundary between Lamia and Hypata. 
 Since maintaining peace and order amongst the populations ruled by Rome was 
the principal concern for the imperial administration, one might expect that magistrates 
such as Augurinus and Quietus would have devoted lots of time to dealing with 
interstate disputes such as this. However, Augurinus, in the text of his decretum, states 
that he spent several days personally investigating the matter, as if it was a remarkable 
circumstance worthy of praise.164 Furthermore, other documents suggest that by the end 
of the second century AD and perhaps earlier, proconsuls and legates were delegating as 
much of the work in boundary cases as possible to competent deputies, a circumstance 
reflecting the ever growing case-load that governors seem to have been expected to 
manage. 
In keeping with this, it is significant that even when the senior magistrates were 
directly involved, most surveyors seem to have conducted their work without direct 
oversight from the responsible magistrate; a proceeding not entirely out of character 
with other aspects of Roman civil law.165 Proconsuls principally attended the legal 
hearings and authenticated the boundary demarcations in accordance with Roman law 
and religious custom.166 However, even the all-important job of authenticating newly-
created boundaries was sometimes handed over to subordinates, who may or may not 
have been surveyors themselves.167 In some instances those appointed as surrogates for 
the provincial governor were chosen by the communities whose problems they 
adjudicated, and in other cases the Roman authorities did not consider the feelings of 
the local population.

1.8 Consensus and Control: Augurinus, Victor and the Power of 
Arbitration 
The Romans expected private citizens and civic bodies alike to submit disputes to third 
party arbitration, a system of dispute resolution born out of Hellenistic concepts of 
interstate diplomacy and modelled on the Praetors tribunal at Rome.168 The governors 
court was not the only available venue for such activities however. Graham Burtons 
assertions notwithstanding, Roman magistrates did not have a monopoly on local or 
even inter-state arbitration.169 More traditional systems of arbitration, while poorly 
attested in the epigraphic record, continued to function alongside the Roman courts well 
into the second century AD.170 This meant that in adjudicating a boundary dispute, 
magistrates such as Quietus or Augurinus had to create an illusion of consensus, in 
which all in the Empire were more or less unified equals under a benevolent ruler who 
had the power to make his will felt anywhere and everywhere at once. This illusion, 
which was central to the Empires ideological foundation, simultaneously camouflaged 
the limits of Roman power while drawing the local population into a complicit 
partnership facilitating the successful implementation of policies.171 At the same time, it 
was not enough for Quietus or Augurinus to simply invoke the universalising language 
that conjured up this illusion. 
As an iudex or judge under Roman law, they had to rule in accordance with that 
law, which invested them with authority while implementing a practical resolution 
based on what Sextus Julius Frontinus referred to as the truth of a place.172 While 
Frontinus conceptualises this truth in terms of centuriation, it is clear that creating a 
geometric grid in the landscape was only one component of this concept. In practice, 
this truth seems to have depended on two things: consensus or agreement between

landholders or communities about how the boundary should be marked, and the actual 
creation of those boundaries to define the space.173 
While there was room for the law and jurists to influence the first of these 
components, the second depended entirely on the surveyors art since it entailed laying 
out either rigores, straight paths between established markers, or else flexus, irregular 
lines that followed the landscape connecting up natural features such as trees, stones or 
streams.174 It is important to recognise that, while not every dispute required a surveyor 
to create boundaries, every dispute depended on the truth generated by boundaries for 
their resolution. 
The importance of consensus to the process of establishing truth and regulating 
the conduct of Lamia and Hypata is amply demonstrated in the text by the impersonal 
verb placet, which means it is agreed or it is the general opinion that. This verb 
suggests the use of concilium, a term denoting both an advisory council and the process 
of making an informed decision based on all available information in order to establish 
a resolution to a problem.175 This decision-making model was always slightly autocratic 
since it depended upon a person of superior standing drawing together the opinions of 
others under his auctoritas.176 As proconsul and iudex, Augurinus possessed superior 
auctoritas, allowing him to place himself at the centre of the consensus building which 
leads up to the agreement concerning the boundary when he asserts, I discovered 
(comperi) the starting point of the boundary at the statue of Orions sometime-wife 
Side, which is just below the sanctuary of Neptune. 
While some members of the Roman elite, such as Sextus Julius Frontinus, who 
had first-hand experience of surveying projects in the provinces, urged Roman 
administrators to know something about the technical aspects of such operations to 
avoid being manipulated by their subordinates, there is no corroborative evidence to 
show that they were routinely involved with actual surveying to the extent Augurinus

claims.177 Most Roman senators and equestrians deeply interested in such matters may 
have perused available surveying texts in the same way that Aulus Gellius engaged with 
juridical literature in order to gain an understanding of the general aspects of the topic 
and become a more conversant member of the social elite.178 If Augurinus and Quietus 
possessed such knowledge, it would have allowed them to interact with surveyors like 
Julius Victor without being subject to fraud, but it would not have provided Augurinus 
with the first-hand experience needed to mark out a boundary down the steep slope and 
across the river as described by the text since, as Frontinus himself attested, this was 
one of the most difficult surveying tasks one could undertake.179 
The description of the boundary itself, though fragmentary, represents a crucial 
part of understanding the role of surveyors in provincial administration, since it both 
reflects texts found in the Corpus Agrimensorum and shows how the surveyors applied 
theoretical knowledge in the service of both imperial magistrates and provincial elites. 
In the work entitled De Conditionibus Agrorum, the author describes a hypothetical 
civic boundary. The description of the boundary found in the decretum of Augurinus 
closely matches that of the universal formula for establishing a circular or asymmetrical 
boundary around a civitas found in the Corpus Agrimensorum:180 
A dispute about territorial jurisdiction occurs whenever there is litigation 
about possession of land because taxes have to be collected. One party 
claims that possession is established within the boundaries of its territory, 
while the other makes a similar claim in contradiction. This question should 
be settled by means of territorial boundary markers, for we (surveyors) often 
find in public documents territories distinctively designated as follows: 
From the small hill called such and such, to such and such a river, and along 
that river to such and such a stream or such and such a road, and along that 
road to the lower slopes of such and such a mountain, a place that has the 
name such and such, and from there along the ridge of that mountain to the 
summit, and along the summit of the mountain along the watersheds to the 
place that is called such and such, and from there down to such and such a 
place, and from there to the cross-roads of such and such a place, and from

there past the tomb of such and such to the place from which the description 
began.181 
Based on the similarity between this description and that in the decretum, as well 
as the observations of Michel Tarpin, Federico Santangelo and M. Faudot, the 
delimitation between Hypata and Lamia should probably be understood as a common 
boundary between two pagi, or outlying civic districts.182 The Latin text of the 
inscription makes it likely that the nodes and rigores comprising both the boundary and 
its description were derived from collaborative discussions between Augurinus and 
Victor on behalf of the two civitates since Augurinus, represented by the first person 
singular, and the word for surveyor bracket the reference to the advocates for the two 
litigants. 
The nature of this partnership is demonstrated by the fact that Augurinus uses 
the word adhibitus, which, as the text on the wooden tablet from Herculaneum 
discussed elsewhere has established, was a Latin technical expression used to indicate 
consultations between an iudex or judge and an expert advisor. Like Julius Victor, the 
surveyor Lucius Opsius Herma mentioned in this document, while adhibitus to the 
arbitrator Tiberius Crassus Fermus, investigated the boundaries between two adjacent 
fundi in the presence of the litigants and an impartial witness. These similarities suggest 
that there was a universal performative system of investigation employed by 
surveyors.183 If the principles were indeed standardised, then they were likely similar to 
and perhaps derived from those developed in Greece, since the Hellenistic monarchs 
maintained professional surveyors long before the Romans. 
In a recent article, Angelos Chaniotis has argued that Hellenistic states 
recognised the ownership of land based on four states of acquisition: inheritance, 
purchase, donation and conquest.184 He further argues that establishing ownership under 
these four principles entailed determining the legal point of first occupation in 
accordance with the principles of law and proofs based on aural or documentary

testimony, physical evidence from the land itself, and the philosophical principles of 
what was just.185 While the Romans recognised many of the same principles, they 
preferred to establish ownership based on occupation starting from an agreed point in 
time, which could be established through surveyors reports derived from sworn 
testimony, documents and physical evidence from the landscape, rather than from 
elaborate appeals to mythology or the remote past.186 Such a normative process of 
assimilation doubtless depended upon social conventions and customs similar to those 
that will be discussed in the consideration of the collegia mensorum in the next chapter. 
These conventions, while not fixed through time and space by any law, nonetheless 
provided surveyors with definitive guidelines for the resolution of disputes, and placed 
the power of interpretation firmly in their hands: 
But, we must watch out (for the practices of) different regions in case we 
seem to be doing something unusual. For, our profession will retain its 
integrity if we also conduct our investigations principally, according to the 
practice of the region.187 
It is important to remember that the boundaries and boundary markers found in 
the decretum of Augurinus closely correspond to the types of markers found in the 
pattern presented in the Corpus Agrimensorum and quoted above, since there is one 
oddity in the description of Augurinus, the statue of Side identified as the starting point 
of the boundary. Nor is this oddity an accident. While statues were frequently used as 
boundary markers in the Greek world before the advent of Roman rule, they never 
feature in the writings of the Roman land surveyors; indicating that they did not usually 
employ statuary alone in such a capacity. However, statues were used as rendezvous 
points for litigation on the day of a trial.188 Moreover, courts were frequently held at 
sanctuaries and temples such as that of Neptune. Since Augurinus was the senior 
magistrate of the province and therefore obligated to hear other cases beyond that of 
Lamia and Hypata, it is likely that he chose the statue as a starting point for the survey 
as a matter of administrative convenience.189 In addition, the choice also reflects the 
governors need to exercise control over Victor. As writers such as Ovid and

Cassiodorus remark, surveying was a divine force with the power to transform the 
landscape and shape civilisation itself, making the surveyors a group of men who could 
transform the landscape like a force of nature.190 Roman magistrates, who had a very 
real need to control and rule over others even as they themselves were dominated by the 
emperor, could not allow individuals such as Victor to exhibit an independent authority 
or exercise the final say in a matter and change things at will.191 
To ensure the stability of Roman rule, surveying and surveyors, like the forces 
of nature itself, had to be at least symbolically subordinated to and controlled by Roman 
magistrates.192 As part of this oversight, Roman law specifically stipulated that if legal 
considerations, such as matters involving harvest or taxes or natural disasters like an 
earthquake, made the pure lines of a survey impractical or inadvisable, then the 
magistrate was fully entitled to ignore or otherwise alter the work of the surveyor when 
rendering a verdict.193 Such powers of oversight could prove both a curse and a blessing 
since there is evidence that members of the provincial elites could take advantage of an 
unwitting magistrate during litigation just as easily as a clever surveyor could.194 
Nonetheless, the Roman elite were deeply concerned with regulating and controlling 
technicians and specialists. In his work on aqueducts, Frontinus makes several 
references to fraud and fraudulent practices perpetrated by technicians on unwitting 
administrators and the need for administrators to know what they are about in order to 
put a stop to it.195 A similar concern about fraudulent conduct is doubtless also at the 
heart of all the regulations governing surveyors and their liability for fraud in the Digest 
of Justinian.196 
This exercise in subordination and control introduces two questions that neither 
the documents from Aizanoi nor the text of Augurinus decretum address. First, since a 
Roman magistrate could disregard a surveyors report, it is worth considering just how 
surveyors went about documenting their work to safeguard themselves from legal action 
by both suspicious magistrates and angry members of the provincial population alike.

Equally important would be the need to prepare themselves as advisors and/or witnesses 
in case of further litigation challenging the decretum of a Roman magistrate. Neither 
situation is clearly documented, but it would seem very imprudent to assume that 
neither eventuality could arise. Second, given the nature of the relationship between 
members of the Roman elite and the way they structured it in public documents, it is 
worth considering just how the surveyors constructed relations with their superiors in 
the course of public discourse. 
1.9 Saving Saldaes Water Project: Valerius Clemens, Nonius Datus 
and Aqueduct Levelling in Africa 
While administrators such as Quietus and Augurinus employed land surveyors like 
Julius Victor to measure up boundary lines and agricultural plots, they also employed 
structural surveyors to investigate public monuments and levelling surveyors to measure 
off mineshafts and plan out the courses of aqueducts. A unique monument from the 
Roman colony of Lambaesis, set up by the surveyor Nonius Datus sometime after 154 
AD (Fig. 1.7), records his account of how he saved the construction of an aqueduct at 
the colony of Saldae from disaster.197 This hexagonal monument stood 1.7 m high, and 
was topped by at least three statues of women personifying the virtues of Spes, Virtus 
and Patientia listed at the top of the monument. The sides of the column contained the 
Latin text of Datus narrative bracketed by at least two letters supplied as supporting 
documentation. The letters are written by two separate procurators of Mauretania 
Caesariensis to the legate of the Legio III Augusta at Lambaesis in the province of 
Numidia, requesting the assistance of Nonius Datus. The letters are unique and 
remarkable since they are the only extant evidence of what might be termed a 
surveyors archive, which shows both how surveyors recorded their activities when 
employed on a project and the ways in which they constructed their relationship with 
the imperial administration:

Crispinus, most generous Lord, you acted in all respects according to your 
humanity and friendly manner when you sent to me Nonius Datus, a soldier 
recalled to duty, so that I could manage matters with him on the works 
whose organisation he undertook. And although I was pressed for time and 
hurrying off to Caesarea, I nonetheless ran over to Saldae and found the 
aqueduct well begun, but, which, from the magnitude of the project I 
examined, could not be completed without the superintendence of Nonius 
Datus, who managed it both most diligently and accurately. Therefore, I 
would ask that you allow him to stay with us a few months for the direction 
of the project, even though he has developed an illness contracted from his 
labours (---).198 
Several key observations can be made from these two letters and the account 
situated between them on the cippus. First, the second letter shows that Datus had very 
little oversight from the procurators governing Mauretania Caesariensis, giving him 
almost total control over the project. More importantly, the project was a long-term 
collaborative enterprise to improve the municipal facilities of the city. The imperial 
procurator Petronius Celeris apparently facilitated the early stages of the project as a 
benefaction to the community.199 To do this, he wrote to the Imperial Legate of the 
Legio III Augusta in Numidia to request the loan of a military surveyor around 137 
AD.200 Since Petronius Celeris was an equestrian procurator, who was at best styled 
prolegati so that he could command troops upon occasion, his request for the loan of a 
surveyor from the Legio III Augusta constituted a petition for patronage since the 
legionary legate was a senator who held the rank of a proconsul even if he had not held 
the consulship.201 The fact that the procurator had to subordinate himself by asking a 
favour from the legate to provide patronage for the people of Saldae, demonstrates just 
how complicated the web of social relationships forming Roman provincial 
administration really were.202 In addition to demonstrating the complexities of 
provincial administration, the procurators request also supports the supposition 
advanced above that Roman administrators preferred to obtain technicians from the 
legions whenever possible. 
The Legate at Lambaesis seems to have respected Celeris request, since Nonius 
Datus, a soldier on active duty with the legion, was detached for the task of conducting

a survey at Saldae and made the first of what turned out to be three trips to the city. 
According to the testimony of Datus in his own narrative, it was during this first trip 
that he laid out the course of the aqueduct and drafted a forma, or drawn ground-plan of 
the watercourse. Since Datus states that he marked out the line of the aqueduct across 
the mountainside, presumably with stakes or levelling boards, as described recently by 
Michael Lewis, this document probably contained both written and illustrated directions 
intended to help the contractors during construction.203 Some support for this conjecture 
comes from the writings of Aulus Gellius and some surviving fragments of building 
plans.204 At the very least, his statement that he provided a forma to the procurator 
shows that Datus intended to document his activities and provide a record of what he 
accomplished during his time at Saldae. 
Unfortunately, the text does not state how many copies of the forma existed or 
who held them. When delimiting land, surveyors customarily made two copies, with 
one being given to the Roman authorities and another left in the local community, and 
that is certainly possible in this case.205 What is important for our purposes here is that 
Datus supplied documentation of his work to the Roman authorities and that 
documentation either entered the procurators records or the provincial archives, and 
perhaps both.206 
The extent to which the availability of this information had an impact upon 
subsequent events at Saldae is an open question. However, Klaus Grewe has recently 
argued that construction on the aqueduct was delayed for about ten years or until 147, 
when another procurator, Porcius Vetustinus, had to write to the legate of the Legio III 
Augusta to request further assistance from Datus.207 The exact cause of this delay can 
only be guessed at, but it is likely that there were more than just technical problems in 
getting construction started. Epigraphic evidence from Numidia suggests that other 
similar projects were finished in about five years and archaeological remains from 
outside the ruins of Saldae show that while monumental, the Saldae aqueduct stretching

21 km in length from end to end was by no means the most complex engineering project 
of its type.208 
While military problems in Mauretania Tingitana in the 140s may have 
contributed to the delay, it is likely that local monetary and political considerations 
beyond the purview of surveyors such as Datus caused the majority of the problems at 
Saldae.209 Whatever the exact cause, the delay doubtless made it difficult to interpret the 
markers Datus had set up to guide construction when the contractors eventually started. 
Evidence from the letters quoted above suggests that this situation prompted the 
government of Saldae to petition the procurator Vetustinus for further assistance from 
Datus. Since Datus had been discharged at some point between 140 and 145, Vetustinus 
had to get the legionary legate to recall the surveyor to duty. 
When Datus, who was doubtless in his early fifties, fell ill, the Roman 
authorities discharged him a second time even though the aqueduct was not finished. 
Such a discharge meant that Datus was no longer liable for further service, and when he 
was requested to return and help finish the job some years later, Datus, confronted with 
an unwelcome duty, declined to do the job. Without direct backing from the emperor in 
Rome, only the united social pressure of the legionary legate, procurator and people of 
Saldae proved sufficient to convince Datus to make the 130 mile journey from 
Lambaesis to Saldae. 
Since most studies of the Saldae aqueduct tend to focus on the construction 
project as a direct act of imperialism initiated by the central administration, few have 
recognised the all-important proactive role of the decuriones of Saldae in the drama 
narrated by Nonius Datus.210 This is understandable since Datus was a military surveyor 
and his narrative, if taken at face-value, states that the aqueduct tunnel was finished by 
two units of the Roman army: the Gaesates, or troops drawn from federated tribes in the 
Alps, and classici milites, or soldiers from the fleet.211 However, while troops could be 
used to carry out work on aqueducts, there is a very strong possibility that the aqueduct

at Saldae, like so many other projects throughout the Roman world, was a local 
initiative, making the presence of these troops less substantial than some might 
believe.212 First, it is worth remembering that the Roman provincial administration 
operated on the reactionary principle of petition and response. Secondly, Mauretania 
Caesariensis was a province where the Roman administration maintained a minimal 
military presence.213 All the available legionaries and the majority of the auxiliaries 
were massed in the neighbouring province of Numidia under the direct command of an 
administratively independent legate, who was, to the great annoyance of the governor of 
Africa Proconsularis and other magistrates, only answerable to the emperor at Rome.214 
In provinces such as Asia, Mauretania Caesariensis and Mauretania Tingitana, to 
conserve their limited military resources, which were composed of auxiliary units, 
administrators tended to be very sparing about tasking soldiers to assist in long-term 
projects that were not directly related to tax-collection or provincial security.215 This 
remained true even when Roman law directly encouraged provincial magistrates to take 
an active hand in the upkeep of municipal buildings such as market halls and 
aqueducts.216 
Setting aside the logistical and administrative considerations, there is also the 
fact that most municipal building projects, including those with some measure of 
imperial support, were initiated and managed by private individuals or municipal 
magistrates as acts of euergetism, with most of the labour drawn from the local 
community.217 This suggests that most of the work on the Saldae aqueduct was done by 
private diggers working under the direction of Datus, with the Gaesates and Classici 
only taking over at the final stages of the project to avert disaster. Even then, Datus 
states that he had to train them in order to achieve the desired result, making Datus the 
key man for success in the venture.218

Whether Datus directed soldiers or teams of diggers, he was placed in charge of 
the project by virtue of the fact that he was invested with authority as an expert by both 
the Roman procurator and the local community. The decreta from both Herculaneum 
and Hypata have already shown that relations between surveyors and the local 
population could prove important in any given survey. There is nothing in those texts, 
however, to suggest the local population of a community, or at least their leaders, 
actively participated in the selection of a surveyor when petitioning the Roman 
administration. Yet, the first letter quoted above shows that the people at Saldae 
actively supported Datus return and may have even demanded it from the procurator. 
An inscription, found in Kosijerevo and published in 1964, shows that powerful 
landowners and civic magnates contracted with military surveyors for the regulation of 
boundaries and the restoration of private or municipal amenities such as bridges.219 The 
same inscription also shows that there were situations where some of these contracts 
had to be regulated or facilitated by provincial magistrates. Regardless of the provincial 
authorities involvement, military surveyors had to compete for these contracts, just as 
their civilian counterparts did.220 As a consequence, Datus, particularly during the 
period leading up to his first appointment to the project at Saldae, would have faced 
competition from other levelling surveyors in the Legio III Augusta and perhaps even 
from Lambaesis; though Serafina Cuomo has possibly overstated their presence at that 
community.221 Success in obtaining and maintaining contracts, whether with private 
citizens or with civic councils, would have depended on an individuals standing within 
the community of surveyors, with the Roman magistrates themselves and with the 
provincial population. 
As the passages quoted from Hyginus above show that a surveyors standing 
depended on their ability to assess the landscape both on a legal and practical basis and 
on their fides or integrity.222 Some of the methods surveyors used to assert or establish 
their collective fides as the preeminent authority on the interpretation of maps, boundary 
markers and all practical matters pertaining to the organisation or ownership of land will

be considered in the next chapter.223 In situations where surveying conventions and the 
law might come into conflict, however, the surveyors insisted on the right to dispute the 
matter with the jurists from the Roman political elite; only conceding their position 
when an issue turned exclusively on a point of law alone.224 Such assertions and the 
need to maintain the perceived integrity of the surveying tradition as an independent 
body of experts shaped the ways in which the surveyors represented administrators on 
their monuments and in their writings. 
1.10 A Projection of Authority: Creating the Image of a Magistrate 
Generally speaking, all magistrates, local or imperial, judicial or administrative, were 
treated with courtesy. However, in their own writings surveyors show themselves as 
asserting their authority to a far greater extent than senior Roman magistrates allow. 
Whereas magistrates such as Augurinus depict surveyors such as Julius Victor as 
deferential subordinates in their documents, surveyors tend to present themselves as 
dynamic experts whose knowledge and opinion is decisive and indispensable in 
resolving technical problems.225 The clearest example of this dynamic presentation is 
found on the monument of Datus when he describes his arrival at Saldae by saying: 
I came to Saldae, met with Clemens the procurator, and he conducted me to 
the hill-side where they were lamenting the tunnel from the poor quality of 
work as if it had to be given up for lost...226 
Here Datus constructs his meeting with the procurator Clemens as an interview 
between two equals, rather than as a professional consultation between an equestrian 
magistrate and a retired legionary. This construction of Datus final consultation in his 
efforts to salvage the crisis at Saldae is therefore intended to raise the social standing of 
Datus as a surveyor and soldier to an exalted height. As such it is the most extreme 
example of a surveyor asserting what they and doubtless others saw as a central role in 
the administration of a Roman province, however, it is by no means the only example. 
Most of the authors in the Corpus Agrimensorum assert the importance of the

surveyors skill and their central place in Roman society to one degree or another.227 
Some of the authors even boast that their skills were the real source of Roman political 
and military success, earning them significant privileges from the emperor.228 
The authors in the Corpus Agrimensorum, however, never present themselves as 
interacting with members of the Roman political elite on a more personal or individual 
level as Datus does. Indeed, as Werner Eck has pointed out, the monument of Datus is 
almost totally unique, making it hard to contextualise.229 Even though the Corpus 
Agrimensorum is a patchwork of documents, each work within it represents a single 
type of document created by an individual author. The cippus by contrast is a composite 
of several document types, is fragmentary, and has been removed from its original 
site.230 Still, a comparison of Datus monument with others created by surveyors 
indicates that it was intended to be a triumphal part of a tomb.231 As such, only those 
who knew of Datus reputation as a surveyor or who were directly related to him would 
have sought out the monument.232 This means that the text on the cippus of Datus was 
not a published document in the way that the documents in the Corpus Agrimensorum 
were, allowing Datus to voice aspects of the surveyors reality which could not be 
presented in their formal writings. Many people in the Roman world used letters and 
narrative on funerary monuments to justify their position in life and to establish an 
immortal reputation with posterity.233 Based on this, I, like Klaus Grewe, contend that 
Datus used a series of official documents he possessed and the Hellenistic principles of 
argumentation outlined above to assert his social position by organising the text of his 
tomb to closely reflect the structure of a courtroom proceeding.234 
This interpretation further suggests that the administration engaged surveyors 
using written documents and that surveyors preserved those documents in archives for 
their own use alongside literature and demonstrations of surveying skill to assert their

social position and defend themselves against legal challenges. In addition, it provides 
added support for the concept, discussed elsewhere, that surveyors maintained 
specialised libraries and archives to facilitate both training and technical support in the 
resolution of disputes.235 More importantly, the use and manipulation of documents, 
many of which were not principally intended for public circulation, also reflects the 
reciprocal and symbiotic system of patronage regulating the relationship between 
surveyors and magistrates. Magistrates needed the surveyors to help them resolve 
technical problems, but the surveyors were dependent on recognition from local or 
imperial magistrates to gain or maintain their standing, particularly when operating 
away from their home communities. 
Broadly speaking, the relationship between the surveyors and magistrates was 
analogous to the reciprocal relationship that existed between a province such as Egypt 
and the Roman administration. Rome depended heavily on Egyptian grain to feed the 
people of Rome and the people of Egypt were well aware of this and boasted about it, 
By the same token, however, Egypt could not always survive without assistance from 
Rome, and the Roman elite fully expected the people to recognise that the emperor was 
the fountainhead of all benefactions.236 In a similar vein, surveyors could proclaim their 
own importance, particularly to one another, and, in private at least, Roman 
administrators might even agree with them, however, in a public context, surveyors 
were expected to be deferential. 
As Myles Lavan has argued, the Roman political elite viewed the world in terms 
of rulers and ruled, for men like Quietus, Augurinus and Clemens, men like Datus were 
part of the ruled.237 By contrast, when the Corpus Agrimensorum and the cases 
presented here are considered together, one can perceive that the Roman surveyors 
operated with a different worldview. For surveyors the world was broken down into the 
emperor, magistrates, the surveyors themselves, and everyone else.238 In many cases the 
second and third categories could be conflated as the surveyors aligned themselves with

members of the political establishment for the purposes of exerting influence to resolve 
a problem or gain a personal advantage against their fellows. This outlook on Empire 
would have been natural and advantageous for the surveyors themselves, but it was not 
always compatible with the views of the Roman provincial administration. As a 
consequence there were doubtless times when the interests of the surveyors clashed 
with those of the imperial administration precipitating the need for direct intervention 
by the emperor. As we will now see, the situation at Aizanoi may have been one such 
case. 
1.11 Aezanoi and All the Proconsuls Men 
While the final resolution to the problems at Aizanoi will receive more attention when 
local resistance to Roman surveying is considered in Chapter Three, it is worth looking 
at some aspects of that resolution here since it demonstrates three important points. 
First, it shows the point at which an emperor was willing to supersede the provincial 
governor and become directly involved in a local matter. This is a question that has 
already been highlighted in the dispute between Hypata and Lamia, where the extent of 
Hadrians involvement remains unclear. Secondly, the resolution to the situation at 
Aizanoi shows the limits of a governors ability to resolve a problem, and the very real 
possibility that his actions, even when buttressed by surveyors, other provincial 
magistrates and the emperor proved insufficient to satisfy the demands of the provincial 
population. Most importantly, the outcome shows the limits of modern scholarly 
knowledge in reconstructing a specific case involving the surveyors. 
It is worth recalling that Quietus, in his letter to the people of Aizanoi, promised 
that the surveyors he had ordered the procurator to choose would establish a single size 
of allotment so that he could fix the rents for the land claimed by the Temple of Zeus. 
The surveyors highly competitive efforts at self-promotion and their indelible presence 
in the culture of the Greek population meant that this promise had to be more than a 
rhetorical gesture. Thus, the surveyors were unquestionably engaged and operated 
without direct oversight from the proconsul as so many surveyors did. The difficulty is 
in knowing exactly what they did to resolve the situation. 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             73 
 
As has been noted, the original plan endorsed by Hadrian was to establish the 
average size of allotments in region around Aizanoi and use that as a basis for fixing the 
rents at Aizanoi. Since the information needed to carry out this plan was not available 
through the procurators archives, two courses of action were available to Quietus. One 
was to assign the surveyors to establish the average size of allotments at cities in the 
vicinity and use that as a gauge to set the rate of payment. The other option would have 
been to undertake a survey of the lands at Aizanoi to establish an average size of 
allotment based on evidence gathered from whatever property markers existed on the 
ground. As text within the Corpus Agrimensorum show, surveyors were familiar with 
the investigation of cases involving the obliteration of markers or rigores. To resolve 
such cases, they advocated an active investigation of the landscape in order to re-
establish the accepted structure of land-holding based on the pattern of markers from 
neighbouring properties or communities whose boundaries were not in dispute.239 In the 
rare event that no property markers remained or that a pattern could not be identified, 
the surveyors could introduce a new grid system for fixing rents by marking it out on a 
plan of the area and thereby producing a theoretical demarcation, or else by marking 
fresh rigores directly on to the ground.240 
Many scholars, including Tom Elliott and Serafina Cuomo, believe that Quietus 
chose the first of these two options in part because Hadrian eventually had to intervene 
directly and in part because archaeologists investigating the area around the Temple of 
Zeus have not recovered much evidence for either a Hellenistic or a Roman 
demarcation.241 However, it is worth recognising that the absence of evidence cannot be 
taken as proof of anything. Not all Roman field systems were marked on the ground and 
many that were marked out employed large wooden survey stakes as markers, which 
would leave little trace for modern investigators to find.242 More importantly, as several 
French studies have recently shown, even when there are physical remains of Roman 
centuriation or boundary systems preserved in the landscape, interpreting the evidence

can be incredibly difficult.243 This means that it is quite possible that the surveyors 
employed by Quietus undertook investigations both at Aizanoi and at other communities 
in the area. 
Hadrians intervention in the situation, which is documented by a series of three 
boundary markers found by archaeologists working at Aizanoi in the 1960s, may 
provide some support for a survey at Aizanoi under Quietus depending on how one 
views their location and bilingual text. The inscription in both Greek and Latin found on 
these markers, which can be dated to 129 AD, proclaim that Hadrian restored the 
boundaries given to Zeus the founder and the community of the Aezaniti by Attalus and 
Prusias the Kings, after Septimius Saturninus a primus pilus made a measurement like 
that King Prusias had established.244 The position of the stones shows that they were set 
up to mark only the outer boundary of the temples land.245 This prompts two possible 
reconstructions. The first is that the letter of Quietus was an empty promise that resulted 
in total inaction on the part of the provincial administration for some two years. This 
course of events is possible, but unlikely, in part because, as discussed above, the 
situation in the city seems to have been volatile and because of the damage it would do 
to Quietus reputation should the people of Aizanoi choose to complain to the emperor 
himself. 
The second and more likely possibility is that some of the landholders at Aizanoi 
resisted the new rents by challenging the extent of the temples property limits after the 
ruling of Quietus was issued. While the details of this legal case can only be 
conjectured, it would have to be based on both the location of the boundary and the 
rightful ownership of land, displaying characteristics of at least three of the fifteen types 
of boundary disputes listed by Frontinus.246 Such a complicated legal challenge to the 
Roman authorities could only have been sustained by those who possessed a 
comprehensive understanding of Roman law and at least a semblance of knowledge 
about where the boundary of the temple was purported to be. This would tend to suggest 
that a survey of some sort had taken place and that the property owners who fought the

rents took advantage of whatever information came out of that investigation. This 
possibility is a sharp reminder that surveyors and their reports could serve interests 
other than the Roman authorities, stimulating conflict between administrators and 
surveyors when the case came to court.247 
Theoretically, any Roman magistrate could adjudicate a case regardless of its 
complexity, but the text of the boundary markers mentioned above show that Hadrian 
took direct responsibility for the final resolution to the situation at Aizanoi. He may 
have chosen to involve himself as a result of a petition addressed to him by the people 
of Aizanoi, though epigraphic evidence indicates that such petitions were usually 
returned to the provincial governor or assigned to an iudex for resolution.248 Having said 
that, there were instances where the emperor seems to have wished to retain legal 
authority and control over a dispute as iudex, but where his position as emperor made it 
impossible for him to hear a case in person. In such situations, Hadrian, Vespasian and 
perhaps emperors going back to Augustus, devolved responsibility to surveyors, who 
were chosen from the members of the Domus Augusti or the ranks of the Praetorian 
Guard.249 Since slaves, freedmen and soldiers did not normally possess the social and 
financial requirements to act as an iudex, the emperor could theoretically retain that role 
while allowing a competent subordinate to deal with the practical aspects of a 
problem.250 
Indeed, it was doubtless this practice that provided the precedent for governors 
to appoint soldiers as representatives for the adjudication or the delineation of 
boundaries discussed above. The emperors interest in intervening in these cases was 
almost always triggered by political, rather than practical considerations. In the case of 
Aizanoi, Hadrians interest may partly have been aroused by a desire to maintain order 
in one of the wealthiest provinces in the Empire. Such a concern is manifest by the fact 
that he sent a senior centurion and military surveyor to carry out the survey and 
establish the boundary markers without reference to the procurator or governor of 
Asia.251

Hadrians primary interest in the matter, however, seems to have been 
opportunistic. At the time Saturninus was sent to resolve the problems at Aizanoi, 
Hadrian was traveling through Asia. As part of his tour, he took the opportunity to 
rebuild the temple complex at Aezanai a grand euergetistic gesture, which was intended 
to enhance his image as a traditional Hellenistic monarch amongst the provincial 
population of the East.252 Benefactions such as this, along with letters of goodwill, 
formed the core of the diplomatic dialogue between the central administration and 
provincial population binding the Empire together.253 Therefore Hadrian could not 
allow the on-going dispute over land and rents to continue as it would disrupt not only 
reconstruction of the temple, but also its future financial prosperity since the rents were 
earmarked for the upkeep of the temple and its priesthood. 
This thrust the work of Saturninus and all the other surveyors involved with the 
resolution of the dispute at Aizanoi into the spotlight of Roman geopolitics, and 
highlights a point which will become far more palpable in subsequent chapters: when 
the emperor became involved in a surveying operation, it was no longer a question of 
local interests, boundary lines and the justice of ownership. The emperors involvement 
meant that surveying was a matter of global political power and the establishment of 
order in a wider world. Such intervention at Aizanoi shows that in spite of all of the 
proconsuls authority and all the surveyors skill, there were times when not all the 
proconsuls horses and all the proconsuls men could keep a community together in the

Chapter Two: Show What You Know and Say What You 
Mean: The Agrimensores and Their Power of Knowledge 
and Communication 
However, a legal dispute that has come up about boundaries is entrusted to a 
land surveyor (agrimensor), so that wanton controversy may be dismissed. 
He is a judge, at any rate, of his own art; empty fields are his law-court. You 
might believe him to be some sort of a mad man, should you have caught 
sight of him wandering tortuous pathways. Accordingly, he searches for 
evidence through thickets and wild woods, nor does he walk in the common 
manner. The path for him is a matter of his own choosing, he demonstrates 
what he means, he proves what he has learned, he discerns the justice of the 
dispute with his own footsteps and in the fashion of a mighty river, takes 
vacant areas from some and grants farmland to others.254 
2.1 Introduction 
Roman surveyors have been described as technical professionals who could be called 
upon by Roman magistrates and private landowners alike to resolve boundary disputes 
and structure the landscape to create new colonies. Both Serafina Cuomo and 
Massimiliano Vinci have spoken of their professional reputation, claims to moral 
authority and their legal abilities, which gave their pronouncements force in the law 
courts.255 Yet little attention has been paid to how someone who wished to hire a 
surveyor could establish the bona fides of anyone who might offer their services or 
assess the quality of their work in a world where professional accreditation did not 
exist.256 There had to be an understood basis for assessing a surveyors work and 
specific characteristics that people expected surveyors to demonstrate when hiring them. 
This chapter will look at what a surveyor had to do in order to establish his 
identity and how he went about proving his qualities on the job. The emphasis will be 
on the practical and theoretical aspects of knowledge that an informed member of the 
public might expect a surveyor to demonstrate during the course of a survey and the

shared knowledge base which made an assessment of a surveyors work possible. This 
chapter will also consider how the surveyor could apply his knowledge base to 
influence human conduct and perceptions of the wider world over a long-term period. 
2.2 Competition, Performance and the Individual Client as Audience 
Before proceeding to a discussion of how surveyors established their credentials and 
influenced people out in the field, it is first worth following the line of investigation 
employed by scholars such as Susan Mattern, Maud Gleason, Todd Curtis and Natacha 
Massar in their studies of the rhetorical art of medicine by considering the nature of a 
surveyors audience and the points at which the surveyor had to address it.257 The work 
of all four of these scholars, by studying the narrative sections of Galens texts along 
with those of other medical writers and inscriptions associated with the practice of 
medicine, has pointed out that doctors addressed four different constituencies in at least 
two very different contexts. On the one hand, doctors addressed potential employers and 
their competitors before a general audience in public demonstrations of medical skill, 
which were held in the manner of a philosophical disputation.258 On the other, each 
doctor, when practicing his craft on a day-to-day basis, had to address his patients, the 
family and friends of the patients, his students and any rival doctors, who would have 
been called in to provide an opinion as part of the consultation.259 
Identifying the audience and points of engagement for the surveyors is far more 
difficult. While medical authors record anecdotes about treating patients, the surveyors 
tend to report accounts of their own abilities that are totally devoid of other people. 
When they discuss the inhabitants of the landscape in which they work, it is always in 
abstract terms such as possessors, coloni or veterani. In addition, where doctors tend to 
have honorific inscriptions set up to commemorate their abilities, nearly all the 
inscriptions commemorating surveyors in their own right were sepulchral, providing 
very little information on how their professional relationships worked within the wider 
context of Roman society.260 Only one passage from the writings of the Corpus 
Agrimensorum sheds any real light on the inner life of the surveyors. The passage

260 See for example: App. 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, 1.11, 1.12, 1.15, 1.19, 1.23; IG 12.6.12.1; IEph. 719, 2212, 2304. 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             79 
 
comes from the opening of the work on geometric surveying written by the surveyor 
Balbus. Balbus structured this work as a letter to his friend Celsus, modelled on the 
epistolary works of Eratosthenes and Archimedes and drew deeply on the Hellenistic 
tradition of scientific writing.261 The social atmosphere Balbus describes reflects the 
same highly competitive world of the Second Sophistic found in the writings of 
Galen.262 It also suggests that the surveyors engaged in many of the same competitive 
oratorical displays of knowledge, engaging many of the same kinds of audience, as did 
physicians: 
Everyone knows, Celsus, the summit of our profession resides in you. 
Therefore I decided to offer up to your judgment the first product of my 
industry. For, although rivalry claims a place for itself amongst equals, I 
thought that no one amongst our learned profession would promote my 
efforts more than the man who among them has the greatest ability in this 
role. Therefore, in order that a more polished version may come to the 
attention of certain individuals, this book should first hurry to you, bearing 
all the sorts of things that are already known to you, setting before you the 
rudiments of an apprenticeship, and sharing with you whatever it was able 
to receive from me in the midst of my military service. And if it is worthy to 
go before everyones eyes in public intercourse, it should most appropriately 
begin with you. Because, if you feel that too little diligence and attention 
have been applied to the work and thus it seems to be remiss in any respect, 
I shall achieve no small reward for my labour if I should through your 
advice take the judgment of unfriendly critics as a gain. And so, I ask, if it is 
not improper, that you excuse the work to the extent that it could not be 
brought to perfection at the time when, while our opinions were running 
strong, this sort of instruction was under discussion.263 
Here Balbus describes a world with a stratified hierarchy, in which teachers and 
former fellow students promote one another to gain an advantage over competitors 
through a superior display of not just technical skill, but through superior eloquence and 
writing as well. While Halsey Royden does not include a collegium agrimensorum in 
her landmark study of the professional associations of Italy, it is likely that much of this 
professional competition was exercised through the collegia, where books such as that 
composed by Balbus could be circulated for public and private reading, and where 
debates about professional matters could be conducted before an appreciative

audience.264 As Liba Taub has pointed out, what modern scholars term scientific 
literature was not necessarily considered as such in antiquity where authors from 
Aristotle, Euclid and Archimedes to Vitruvius, Pliny the Elder and Avienus argued 
about technical matters, circulating their ideas in a variety of different styles and 
media.265 For surveyors, perhaps more than any modern scholar or scientist, the ability 
to secure patrons rested on their reputation as technical experts, making public access to 
both their written material and the verbal exchanges, which proved their craft, crucial 
for the development of a public persona. Thus, as Brian Campbell and Serafina Cuomo 
have argued, surveying texts did not simply circulate within the narrow confines of the 
surveying community since they were crafted for a wider audience and formed part of a 
wider public discourse about knowledge, social identity and power created through the 
deployment of oratory, written texts and the manipulation of mathematics.266 
Understanding the discourse and its impact upon the legal ownership of land 
within the Roman world was crucial since the only regulations found in the Digest, 
which restrained the conduct of surveyors, required private citizens to sue the surveyor 
for fraud.267 As a consequence, unless a surveyor happened to be a slave loaned out for 
a particular job by their master, surveyors, like architects and doctors, had to engage a 
potential employer as their first audience and provide a demonstration of their 
professional knowledge and competence.268 
2.3 Audience, Action and Performance in the Field 
Once engaged, a surveyors audience expanded. The passage of Cassiodorus quoted at 
the opening of this chapter suggests that there were three phases to the resolution of a 
boundary dispute with three different sorts of interaction between the surveyor and his 
audience: the investigation, report and demonstration. As Cassiodorus and numerous 
passages from the Corpus Agrimensorum indicate, the first stages of an investigation 
predominantly involved a systematic examination of physical evidence such as

boundary markers out on the land. Such activities required only limited interaction 
between the surveyors and those who lived in the landscape under study. Several 
passages from the Corpus, however, also show that the surveyors frequently had to 
consult with land-holders and cross-reference written records and inscribed monuments. 
The language of these passages illustrates the imperative sense of mission the surveyors 
felt in their work as well as the detached, impersonal attitude they seem to have taken 
toward people whose land they surveyed: 
Truly, if someone should raise a question concerning the pagi themselves, 
the troublesome bother of a serious case will be stirred up. One must 
consider, as we have frequently discussed, by whom from amongst the 
communities on either side of the borderland is rented out. Furthermore, 
supplies frequently have to be provided at public expense to a praetorian 
soldier or to any other dispatch rider, and if firewood or straw is required, 
one must enquire into which civitates with which pagi have been 
accustomed to provide this sort of service. In addition, some regions are 
accustomed to make different kinds of sacrifice: therefore, the way in which 
a pagus conducts its sacrifice must be considered.269 
And an investigation must be conducted into this sort of situation: whether 
an understanding has been established between two land-holders concerning 
a particular (field) within the allocated area of either party, who are clearly 
established on the bronze record (tabula) and in the written copy of the map 
(forma), although the principal owner sold the field in question. And in fact, 
I have discovered this (sort of situation) in Samnium, where the property 
which the divine Vespasian assigned to veterans was possessed by those 
people to whom it was allocated, but in a different manner. For some had 
purchased certain areas and incorporated this acquisition into their own 
territory, by marking out a property line at a road or at a stream or at 
whatever other sort of feature might suit. But, neither those selling their 
allotments, nor those purchasing and adding to their own property, worked 
out the exact area, but rather bought and sold as if each area was, as I said, 
delineated by a road or stream or whatever other sort of feature suited. 
Therefore, how is it possible for the bronze record to be applied, if as I said, 
an agreement has been entered into concerning the property between two 
people, who are in dispute about it?270 
In these two passages, the authors of the Corpus Agrimensorum illustrate the 
importance of integrating information from a variety of sources to resolve problems. In 
the first passage, where the structural identity and ownership of a pagus was in 
question, the investigator had to find out who rented what property and where that 
property was located. But the surveyor also had to find out who carried out specific

duties for the Roman administration and how religious sacrifices were conducted in 
order to distinguish the cultural identity of different communities. The importance of 
direct interaction with land-owners in the acquisition of such information is emphasised 
in the second passage, where a surveyor attempted to resolve a dispute between land-
holders based on documentary records only to discover that the land-owners had made 
their own arrangements without respect to the formal procedures of surveying. Even 
when those living on the land did respect the work of surveyors, information provided 
by people and gleaned from the physical evidence found in the landscape could 
sometimes only be reconciled with the written records by hours of quiet reading in 
archives or libraries, piecing together bits of information through deductive 
reasoning:271 
In addition there is a document termed an interpolated bronze record 
(tabula). It so happens that veterans, who were settled by the Divine Julius 
Caesar at one time, later took up arms again for Augustus; and once the 
wars had burned themselves out, the victorious soldiers returned to their 
own lands. However, other (veterans) received land in the place of those 
who had died. For which reason it happens that within these centuries are 
found the names of both those who were settled before and those who later 
succeeded to their place. This is something which I discovered to be the 
case from this particular oddity: when I was calculating the area of ascribed 
land distributed and the (number of) centuries exceeded the size (of the 
area), I returned to the primary origin of the allocation and discovered that 
names had been added later in this situation, about which I have already 
expressed my opinion above.272 
Since much of the investigative work mentioned by Flaccus in this passage 
involved a close examination and comparison of documents, the work would have been 
done exclusively in the presence of what Pascal Arnaud has argued were specially 
trained archivists tasked with looking after property records and the surveyors maps or 
formae.273 This meant that conclusions such as those recounted by Siculus Flaccus 
would have been formed before a very limited audience. Surveyors could only use them 
to influence the wider audience of land-owners and magistrates when they issued their 
formal renuntiatio or report and undertook their demonstratio to validate their findings. 
Details about these two juridical activities are limited, but a passage from the twenty-

fourth book of Ulpians Edicts and several inscriptions, which include the well-
published bilingual inscription from Delphi, show that they were two separate activities 
in a multi-stage process.274 According to the text of Ulpian, once a surveyor had made 
his report on an investigation, he was open to prosecution for fraud should it be 
suspected, even if the report was delivered by a third party.275 Ulpians observations 
substantiate two points. First, that the surveyors renuntiatio formalised and legitimised 
his actions. By issuing a renuntiatio the surveyor established a factual basis for the 
resolution of a dispute under litigation by an iudex or arbitrator. Second, since a person 
other than the surveyor could deliver the renuntiatio, this activity was what Elizabeth 
Meyer has described as a recitatio ex tabulis, or a ritual reading of a formulaic text from 
tablets before the presiding magistrate and an audience comprised of those who were 
concerned in the matter.276 
The clearest illustration of how surveyors merged verbal delivery with 
performative acts and the production or manipulation of documents comes from three 
separate decreta which have been found in the Greek countryside. One, which will be 
considered below, was found in the ruined church of the Holy Trinity north of Elassona. 
The text chronicles the restoration of a boundary running along the border between 
Thessaly and Macedonia separating territory belonging to Doliche and Elemeia by 
Verginius Publianus on the 27th of March 101 AD.277 The other two are parts of the 
bilingual inscriptions found at the Temple of Apollo in Delphi and published by Andr 
Plassart.278 The texts preserve a series of disputes adjudicated by Gaius Avidius 
Nigrinus in either 110 or 114 between the people of Delphi and several other 
communities to the north and east.279 While none of these documents were drafted by 
the surveyors themselves, the two documents illustrate the performative operations 
undertaken both by surveyors and local land-holders in defining a boundary, while the 
text from the Church of the Holy Trinity helps to illustrate the range of performative 
procedures undertaken by surveyors in the field.

In the earliest of the disputes, recorded in the first column of the inscription (Fig. 
2.1), Nigrinus used a prior ruling by the jurist Gaius Cassius Longinus, whose work is 
cited in the Corpus Agrimensorum as an authority on land-law, and the documents filed 
by the surveyor Valerius Iustus to resolve a dispute between the people of Delphi and 
the people of Ambryssos:280 
These words were read aloud from the tablets when Gaius Avidius Nigrinus 
was propraetorian legate of Augustus, 15 days before the Kalends of 
October (17th of September). Since the authority of prior legal decisions 
must always be preserved, one ought now to pay attention to the decree 
which Longinus issued in the dispute between the people of Delphi and the 
people of Ambryssos, which they had brought before the emperor, in which 
he (Longinus) assigned to them the surveyor Valerius Iustus, and the 
determination (determinatio) for the extent of the boundaries was produced 
by him. For it would appear from the letter of this man (Longinus), which 
was publicly addressed to the people of Delphi, that neither the people of 
Ambryssos or the people of Delphi rejected the determination until many 
years had passed. In accordance with the ordinances of Longinus, in the 
boundary dispute between the people of Delphi and the people of 
Ambryssos, it is agreed that I rule in accordance with the determination (for 
the extent of the boundaries) produced by Valerius Iustus. In concilium were 
Quintus Eppius, Flavius Arrianus, Gaius Papius Habitus, Titus Livius.281 
Within this text, there are three degrees of verbal and performative action united 
in the final written form of the decretum. Longinus, who was consul in 30 AD, was 
ordered by the emperor to adjudicate a dispute involving a boundary between the people 
of Delphi and the people of Ambryssos. He appointed a surveyor, Valerius Iustus, to 
assess the line of the boundary and pronounce an opinion on it. That opinion was 
presumably delivered to Longinus. The iudex then incorporated the renuntiatio of Iustus 
into a decretum, which was issued in writing to the people of Delphi. Later, Nigrinus 
used this documentary record to resolve a fresh altercation between the two parties over 
the exact same boundary-line by invoking the need to respect the prior rulings of 
Roman officials. What is unclear from the text is the extent to which Iustus carried out 
his work under public scrutiny and the extent to which he was working to re-establish 
the results of a prior survey. The decretum issued by Verginius Publianus, along with 
other evidence, however, indicates that his actions were observed by an audience and 
that he was re-establishing the line of a boundary which already existed rather than a

new one instituted by the imperial administration. Publianus, in issuing his verdict, 
which was recorded on the stele from church of the Holy Trinity (Fig. 2.2), does not use 
the word determinatio; however his language makes it clear that like Longinus he was 
restoring a boundary: 
When the Emperor Caesar Nerva Trajan Augustus Germanicus, for the 4th time, 
and Quintus Articuleius, were consuls, on the 6th day before the Kalends of April 
(27th of March). This was copied and authenticated from the journal of Verginius 
Publianus, the judge appointed by the emperor Trajan, which Caelius Niger 
brought out and in which was written that which is written below. Since it has 
been proven to me that the convergent boundaries inscribed on the stone stele 
which is located in the forum of Doliche, are those in the precise royal definition 
of boundaries (definitio) created by Amyntas, father of Philip, between the people 
of Doliche and the people of Elemeia, it is agreed that the boundary is (a line 
starting) from the boundary stone which is on the road above Geranae (and 
running) between Azzoris and Onoareae to Petraeae in Doliche. (The line runs) 
over the top of the ridge through the plain which is called Pronomae, in such a 
manner that the plain is in the territory of the people of Elemeia and then along 
the top of the ridge to 282 
Ulpian, in a passage of his Edicts, used both determinare and definire in a single 
sentence, suggesting that while they were related activities as part of the formulary 
practice of Roman law, each term had its own meaning and involved slightly different 
formulaic procedures.283 In discussing the terminology found in the Corpus 
Agrimensorum, Brian Campbell has observed that much of the surveyors vocabulary 
was not particularly technical or specialised, and that their vague formulations left the 
full nature of the actions required for any given situation to the interpretation and 
discretion of the surveyor on the ground.284 Arnaud, however, who recognised the 
difficulties pointed out by Campbell, has argued that, for much of Roman history, 
definitio referred to the documentary and formulary process involved in creating a 
boundary, while determinatio referred to the process used to re-establish, alter and 
formalise an existing boundary.285 It would seem that the Romans, in keeping with their 
preference for using an established historical moment as the datum for organising land 
in the provinces, distinguished between the formal actions used to create a boundary for

the first time and those used to re-establish a boundary or the ownership of land.286 This 
is certainly the sense one gains from comparing the decretum issued by Verginius 
Publianus with another issued by Nigrinus, which forms the third column of the text in 
the inscription from Delphi (Fig. 2.3): 
(Issued) 10 Days before the Kalends of October (22nd of September) at 
Elatia. With respect to the dispute of the people of Delphi against the people 
of Amphissa and the people of Myania concerning boundaries, which the 
Optimus Princeps ordered me to investigate: once both sides had been heard 
many times and the sites which they were in dispute about were both 
traversed and inspected in accordance with the formal presentation 
(demonstratio) of their features by both parties, and I had also verified the 
documents pertaining to the matter through a careful assessment, I summed 
matters up in this decree. Since the Optimus Princeps ordered (me) to stand 
by the (sententia) judgement of the hieromnemones that was made on the 
authority of Manius Acilius and the Senate, and since the determination 
(determinatio) (of the extent of the boundaries) made by the 
hieromnemones, which was inscribed on the side of the Temple of Apollo at 
Delphi, has been brought before me, it is agreed that according to the 
(determinatio) determination, (the line) from Trinapea, which is an 
overhanging clifftop above the valley called Charadron where there is a 
spring (called) Embateia, all the way to the afore-mentioned spring, is (the 
boundary) of the territory of the Delphic people, which overlooks the 
Delphic community. From this spring, since the determination 
(determinatio) shows that the boundary must be aligned with Astrabas, it is 
agreed that (the boundary-line) up to the marker-stone (terminus), which has 
been pointed out to me on a certain clifftop called Astrabas not far from the 
sea, on which a boundary mark (terminus), which is considered to be a 
special symbol of the sacred lands of the Delphic community, has been 
engraved, is (the extent) of the territory of the Delphic people, which has 
been shown as sloping toward the left in the direction of the Delphic 
community all the way to the sea287 
For the surveyors, magistrates and litigants mentioned in this inscription, 
surveying was a discursive activity which was defined by formalised speech, 
observation, gesture and movement through familiar spaces learned not so much from 
books as from the common experience of living on the land.288 The documents 
employed in this context, whether housed in a local archive or inscribed on boundary-
markers and monuments situated in the landscape, were symbols of enduring memory

and an expression of power whose voices transcended time and distance.289 Each 
document or monument, like each witness who walked the land pointing out its features, 
articulated views on how the land was organised in the past or about how it should be 
organised in the future. Surveyors, by the very nature of their craft, had to enter into this 
performative discourse and negotiate its intricacies to formulate a resolution that all 
parties could accept even if they did not like it. They did so by listening to the land-
owners, reading the documents and observing the matrix of monuments and markers 
structuring the cultural memories etched into the landscape in order to discern a specific 
kind of truth. This highly subjective understanding of truth about a place was 
formulated through an ontological filter created by elements of Stoic, Epicurean and 
perhaps Peripatetic philosophy, Roman law and the Hellenistic mathematical 
tradition.290 
In many ways, the surveyors, like modern archaeologists, were involved in a 
historical inquiry into how people lived on the land and the past and present ways in 
which they thought about the land they inhabited.291 Unlike modern archaeologists, 
however, surveyors did not always have to take exact measurements as a modern 
scientist would be expected to do in order to prove their interpretation of the land. Often 
it was enough for surveyors to present an interpretation of the evidence congruent with 
the cultural memories and social conditions of a particular place to foster the precise 
discourse between people that facilitated consensus about human control over space and 
the structural organisation of the landscape. In other situations, only a surveyors 
deployment of exact figures and precise readings of documents illustrating the truth 
about a place or its extent could negotiate the gap between an abstract understanding of 
space and the everyday lived experience of a particular place. To fully appreciate how 
surveyors constructed a persuasive performative argument in order to achieve this 
objective, the rest of this chapter looks at the surveyors deployment of deductive 
observation, movement, mathematics, juridical taxonomy and the philosophy of 
geographic theory.

2.4 Elementary My Dear Nigrinus: Observation, Articulation and 
Understanding 
The commonplace clich that many people see but do not observe was already old when 
the satirist Lucian noted that a person who is not trained to view something properly is 
content to look on in silence and gesticulate meaninglessly, while the trained observer 
takes in whatever is before their eyes and articulates a fitting explanation or reply to 
illustrate understanding and eloquence.292 While Lucians explication of this topos 
comes in the context of a dialectic on the appreciation of art, it remains a valuable 
source because, as Simon Goldhill and Michael Squire have both remarked, it places the 
scopic regime of learned viewing or observation, which the surveyors frequently 
invoke, into the wider sociological and rhetorical context of the Second Sophistic.293 
Within this specific social context, viewing was a divisive phenomenon in which the 
trained viewer formulated an expert opinion on a given subject by reconfiguring what 
was taken in through the eyes with a carefully articulated response using appropriate 
words, gestures and actions.294 As Daryn Lehoux has explained, the cultural 
construction of viewing that predominated amongst educated people was grounded in 
the physiological understanding of vision and the all-important skill of rhetoric, which 
covered not just argumentation for the Romans, but also housed many of the theoretical 
applications of logic bound up with what might be termed scientific investigation.295 
Amongst the mathematical and scientific community of the Roman world, the 
dominant theory of optical vision depended on the extramission of what modern 
translators term numa, a concept common enough that it found its way into popular 
novels of the period.296 According to Galen and Ptolemy, numa was generated from the 
brain via nerves into the eyes, from whence it emanated out into the world as radiating 
cones.297 These cones of numa then seem to have interacted with the boundaries 
between light, air and the substantive nature of colour, in order to produce sight by 
drawing the essence of things into a person and producing thoughts in the mind through

what the Stoics term phantasia.298 Once the essence of things was imprinted upon the 
mind, they stimulated further thoughts, which by their nature had to be externalised 
through speech, writing and physical action shaping human experience and allowing 
people to communicate with others across time and space.299 This communicative 
faculty meant that the way one studied an object, as well as the words, phrasing and 
gestures used in responding to it, were significant when establishing an air of authority 
in technical matters. 
Like Galen and Ptolemy, who provide much of the technical information on this 
concept of visual perception, the surveyors drew upon the core concepts in Greek 
mathematics and science, internalising and regurgitating parts of literature on subjects 
such as art, architecture and medicine in comparative or illustrative exempla to explain 
their own work.300 It is important to recognise, however, that while the surveyors may 
have internalised this optical theory, they never discussed its details, but simply 
described the act of conducting an examination as part of resolving a problem in 
surveying. 
The authors of the Corpus Agrimensorum deploy observation and visual 
investigation in two different contexts, which might be described as recuperative and 
transformative. While quite distinct in their ends, both modes of viewing depended 
upon the epistemological argument that the reasoning faculty in people could learn to 
draw conclusions from the interaction between ideas in the mind and physical objects in 
the world mediated by the sensations of sense perception, primarily produced by the 
numa radiating out of the eye.301 Such rational conclusions could in turn be combined 
with speech, gesture and the very act of looking itself to transform other peoples 
understanding of the world around them. The role of this conception of visual 
observation in a purely recuperative or affirmative context is most palpable through the 
surveyors discussion of boundary restoration, where, as the texts quoted above show, 
they used visual observation to establish the validity of documents, but most

significantly in the identification of boundary-markers and the interpretation of systems 
for boundary demarcation: 
If a (legal challenge) concerning a boundary is undertaken, property which 
is within the five or six foot gap (between the boundary-lines) is called into 
question, since the space is either occupied as a right of way by those 
travelling to the fields, or else it (is used) for the turning of a plough, which 
makes it impossible for it to be occupied through the custom of usucapio. 
Indeed, a pathway, because it leads to fields under cultivation, cannot be 
occupied by the custom of usucapio. A boundary is established by many 
types of evidence, in which case, one must observe (whether it is done) by 
boundary stones, or by notched trees, or ditches, or roads, or rivers, or 
mountain ridges, or watersheds, or as is customary, by thorn-hedges, or 
terraces, or by straight-line boundaries (rigores) with regular right-angles 
and a fence-line, or as I have discovered here and there, by raised beds of 
earth at the borders between the fields, or yet again as is frequently the case, 
by uncultivated strips of land. These are generally the sorts of things that are 
habitually observed to be boundaries.302 
The exact nature of boundaries and the impact of legal taxonomy on their 
formulation will be considered in a moment. Here it is important to focus on the fact 
that the author of this passage makes it clear that surveyors, through both training and 
practical experience, had to learn to observe the different physical characteristics of 
particular markers and recognise the various types of marker used to denote different 
systems for boundary-marking. He goes on to describe twelve different methods used to 
denote a boundary, which, like the symptoms of a disease or broken bones in the body 
of a doctors patient, could be used to discern the nature of the landscape and the 
characteristics of a dispute.303 The list seems to be presented in a descending order of 
value from the most to the least efficacious system of demarcation. The most secure 
way of defining property was the terminus or stone boundary-marker. These 
monumental markers came in a variety of forms with some, such as the Tiburtine, being 
elaborately carved, while others were simply inscribed with a letter or number to denote 
the identity of a land-owner or their place in a survey grid.304 
As Thomas Habinek has observed, the habit of inscribing stone markers with 
abbreviations, numbers and ornamental relief sculpture was a decidedly Roman act of

scribal appropriation, though the practice may have originated with the Etruscans.305 
Reading these stones, which were frequently peculiar to a specific locality, depended 
upon a surveyor being embedded in the epigraphic culture of Roman society and 
deductive reasoning based on the conception of visual perception and mental 
comprehension discussed above.306 A key demonstration of this deductive faculty 
presented in the Corpus Agrimensorum was the need for surveyors to distinguish 
proprietorial termini from honorific grave cippi, when both were present on or near to 
what people believed to be a boundary.307 Surveyors made the distinction by visually 
matching similar patterns of inscription and ornamentation on stones, which formed a 
discrete line across the landscape, rejecting any stones that were either out of alignment 
with the rest of the pattern or carved differently from the majority of markers forming 
the pattern of the boundary. The surveyors utilised the same system of close reasoning 
when people chose to delineate their boundaries by marking lines or crosses on natural 
stones or by heaping up mounds of stones or by establishing dry stone walls and 
ditches. The objective was to distinguish between monumental features deliberately 
created to mark a boundary from features intended as barriers for the protection of 
livestock or that were the product of land-clearance.308 
While the surveyors lavished a great deal of attention on identifying and 
describing various types of boundary markers as the most sophisticated system for 
marking a boundary, the bewildering array of methods used for deploying stones make 
it difficult to establish whether the surveyors maintained a qualitative taxonomic 
hierarchy for the various types of stone marker described in the texts. The practices used 
for marking trees as termini, however, first studied by Brian Campbell, display some 
clear details of a tripartite hierarchical taxonomy employed to distinguish between 
different grades of thorn-hedges and tree-lines. Within this taxonomic classification, 
Campbell has identified three distinct categories: arbores ante missae, arbores intactae 
and arbores notitae.309

Arbores intactae seem to have been regarded as the least reliable method of 
marking a boundary since the practice simply considered either cutting down all trees 
on a boundary with the exception of one specific species which was left standing with 
its branches pruned, or else planting a specific type of tree that was different from those 
cultivated by the land-holders.310 Distinguishing arboreal markers of this classification 
was therefore mostly an exercise in identifying species of tree and working out local 
patterns of cultivation in the region.311 
By contrast, arbores ante missae, though Campbell considers the category vague 
for some reason, were clearly trees that were planted before the boundaries of a property 
were established and which were identified as boundary-markers by drilling a hole in 
the trunk and inserting a wooden peg.312 In many cases, land-holders added further 
security to boundaries marked in this way by planting thorn hedges, which acted as a 
fence-line between the trees.313 
The most secure method of marking a boundary with trees, however, was referred 
to as arbores notitae. These were lines of trees specifically planted to mark a boundary 
and were identified as such with a scar carved into the side of the trunk facing away 
from the land-holders property.314 The true value in this system was not just that the 
trees were marked, but that they were planted to form a clear straight line of sighting, 
much as the stone markers discussed above. 
The essence of the taxonomy presented in this system of boundary-marking used 
on trees lay in the ease with which the trees could be identified as markers through 
visual signs. Moreover, the inherently visual method of identification was at the heart of 
surveying, particularly in regions in which Roman notions of boundary-marking might 
not be practiced. As the author of the De Generibus Controversiarum explains, in 
situations where two land-holders made conflicting claims about the extent of their 
property without any reference to maps or written documents, a surveyor had to

physically look at the patterns of cultivation, topographical features and any man-made 
markers situated in the landscape.315 The more visible the signs, the easier it was for a 
surveyor to take in and gather the signs and images in their own mind to form a picture 
of the landscape as it should be. But, like the expert critic of art presented by Lucian, 
the surveyors interpretation of the evidence gathered through observation of the 
landscape only became meaningful as part of an expert opinion, when he issued his 
renuntiatio in the presence of the litigants and their arbitrator or judge. Here, sight, 
gesture and utterance would have been forged into an ontological whole, as the 
surveyors narrated the historical significance of features in the landscape, and with their 
index finger following their eyes, as they turned them to the fields and monuments, 
pointed out the evidence of their argument for the benefit of the audience.316 
2.5 Paths of Knowledge: Observation and Movement in Landscape 
Formation 
Each act of observation used to recreate boundaries, as surveyors did at Delphi under 
Longinus and Nigrinus, depended upon a previous act of surveying, in which the 
boundaries were first created or defined. Delphine Acolat remarks that the Romans, 
perhaps through contact with the Etruscans, adapted the practice of creating inscribed 
markers, which were set up at inaccessible, though highly visible, points in the 
landscape.317 As she further notes, inscriptions such as those from Delphi show that 
many of the markers created by Greeks and Romans alike, though different in their use 
of language or iconography, were nonetheless deployed to complement features such as 
hills or mountain ridges, which were recognised as lines of demarcation in their own 
right.318 
Complementing such natural lines of demarcation with abstract lines denoted by 
monumental markers, particularly where the distances between each point was 
measured and recorded, was a conscious effort to dominate and order an otherwise

irregular landscape in both visual and mathematical terms.319 Like the renuntiatio of the 
surveyor, which re-established the validity of an observed line of control, each 
measured interval between markers was the external expression of control, derived from 
a visual observation and human movement across the landscape, which was guided by 
the philosophical principles of geometry. This is what might be termed the 
transformative mode of observation. It was the act creating the structural organisation 
and geometric pattern of a landscape which surveyors like Iuventius later recovered or 
affirmed. 
To grasp the implications of this concept for surveyors and their impact on those 
whose land they organised, it is important to recognise that the ownership of land is 
dependent upon both the human occupation of a given place and the way in which it is 
occupied. As Gerard Chouquer has explained, this is essential since land as a resource 
does not truly exist, but rather comes into being through the assertion of control by 
human beings based on their occupation of a given place in the landscape.320 To 
paraphrase the concepts of the anthropologists Tim Ingold and Alberto Corsin-Jimnez, 
land as place is defined by the cultural understanding created through the agency of 
occupation, a process bound up with sensory perception and the tasks of dwelling.321 An 
individual might experience the landscape in a variety of ways. The crucial factors in 
establishing the kind of control Chouquer has in mind, however, are the interactions 
between people, their environment and the memories of these interactions, which each 
person takes into their mind through the nervous systems starting at the eyes, ears and 
skin.322 Put in anthropological and linguistic terms, used by Christopher Tilley and 
Martin Thiering, these interactions were and are determined by the movement of 
individuals under given conditions regulated by language, gesture and the mental 
models, which provide the implicit cognitive processes of deduction for understanding 
and organising these experiences in long-term memory.323 
For the surveyors and most people past and present, it was words, numbers and 
images that comprised the components of this dynamic encoding of past and present

experiences, derived from states of being and becoming created by movement. As 
Tilley, Thiering and Jean-Marie Kawalski have all discussed, each person constructs an 
understanding of where they are and their relationship to other people derived from a 
finite number of cues in the environment, interpreted in terms of anthropogenic 
conceptions of scale and a relative frame of reference.324 Put another way, each person 
moving across an ocean or through a landscape will situate, describe and assert some 
sort of authority over the people and objects they perceive. They can use either their 
own position as a frame of reference, another relative point outside themselves such as a 
boulder or the front of a house, or else an abstract absolute conventional point of 
reference such as the cardinal directions. Moreover, they will also scale people and 
objects in relationship to their own body, and chronologically in terms of their own 
diurnal experience.325 
In gathering together perceptions filtered through this ontology, Tim Ingold has 
argued that human beings inhabit the landscape either as a wayfarer, who moves along a 
continuous path of interaction with the landscape, or else as a traveller, who follows 
segmented lines of transport between two or more destinations.326 For what Ingold calls 
the wayfarer, movement through the landscape and the observations made through that 
movement are a way of life, while the traveller focuses on the significant activities at a 
given destination and takes the most direct line between any two given points. Both 
modes of perception generate an understanding of the world, but where the wayfarer 
interacts with the environment, learning it through constant experience the traveller 
dissolves the intimate bond between locomotion and perception through the 
introduction of quantified lines connecting points in the landscape. These connective 
pathways tend to act as lines of domination rather than habitation, since they tend to be 
built across country without regard for the natural paths of movement in order to unite 
nodal points of power in an abstract construction of control.327 This was particularly 
true for the surveyors, who interacted with the landscape to understand what it looked 
like only to quantify and bind it in points connected by imaginary lines.

2.6 To Walk Like a Madman: Observation, Movement and Landscape 
Information 
In the Roman world, people, while walking, adopted specific bodily postures, whose 
character and perception was mediated by the landscape, weather and social 
conditions.328 The way in which one walked and where one did it established gender, 
social position and occupation to a far greater extent than in modern societies.329 
Cassiodorus, whose account opened this chapter, made a clear connection between 
movement, observation and the surveyors craft when he observed that one might 
consider surveyors to be madmen if one watched them walking the hills in search of 
evidence.330 Much the same feeling pervades the writings of the Roman land surveyors, 
where the way surveyors move and manipulate their instruments are shown to 
determine their status, the data they can acquire and the viability of the ways in which 
they chose to shape the landscape. 
Regrettably, only two detailed accounts of practical surveying in the field have 
survived for study. One is in the writings of Frontinus and the other is in the fragments 
which have tentatively been assigned to Junius Nipsus.331 From the state of the text in 
the manuscript editions used by Lachmann and all subsequent editors of the Corpus 
Agrimensorum, it would seem that the copyists who produced the first recension had 
trouble understanding what it was they were reading in the original sources. Beginning 
with Lachmann, editors have been forced to intervene and amend the text in the 
manuscript codices extensively.332 This means that interpretations of the texts inevitably 
rest on conjecture, which, in the case of Nipsus, has not been fully accepted by the 
scholarly community.333 For Frontinus at least, most editors have accepted Lachmanns 
emendations, providing a scholarly consensus upon which to proceed.334 
In the section of Frontinus work entitled the De arte mensoria, the author 
describes a theoretical approach for resolving practical problems when setting out

boundaries in irregular terrain or at the outer edge of centuriated land.335 The exercise 
depends on the surveyor geometrically aligning a series of right-angled triangles formed 
from points, which were marked by surveyors stakes in the course of field walking. 
Abbreviated, the passage reads: 
The foundation for the practice of the art of surveying rests in practical 
experience. The truth of sites or extent cannot be expressed without rational 
lines, since the perimeter of all land is enclosed by a curving and uneven 
boundary, which through a multitude of angles of varying size can be 
expanded and contracted even as the total number of angles remains the 
same.  Therefore, we should seriously consider how the ferramentum 
might be used so that we can surmount whatever obstacle might oppose us. 
Then we should demonstrate the greatest diligence in the taking of 
measurements, particularly in the progress of the course which will 
coordinate the execution of the determination with the lengths of the sides. 
First use the ferramentum and when it has been balanced carefully, align all 
of the movements. With the eye, sight from all of the projecting arms (of the 
ferramentum) across the threads or strings once they have been made taught 
with weights and aligned with one another, until one sees the nearest alone, 
while the other disappears from the field of view. Then report the marks and 
retrieve them, having in the interval transferred the ferramentum from the 
furthest marker, and keeping it in the same position as it was before, 
continue the straight line that was begun until it comes to a turn or to the 
end. At all turnings, let the plumb-line (at the end of the ferramentums arm) 
indicate the point of intersection.  Now, if there is a valley, which is too 
wide for surveyors to see across, one must go down through it using markers 
fixed in accordance with the ferramentum.  On the other hand, in the case 
of a narrower valley, the other side of which one can sight, take steps for the 
avoidance of trouble thus: cross to the other side and report at least three 
points, from which, once they have been recovered after the ferramentum 
has been transported across, one must back-sight to the markers fixed 
previously (on the other side) and, with it (the ferramentum) balanced 
carefully, continue the straight line which has been begun until the matter is 
concluded.336 
Here, Frontinus expresses the conviction that surveying was essentially a 
performative exercise that could not really be learned from books, because it involved 
extracting an orderly mathematical understanding from a landscape, which was 
inherently comprised of rough ground and the uneven boundaries created by mountains, 
rivers, swamps and forests.337 In order to create an orderly structure that people could 
comprehend on a more abstract level, surveyors had to experience the topographical

irregularities of a region to visually identify the beginning of a survey and its significant 
topographical points.338 This could fairly be said to reflect wayfaring. However, once a 
starting point was identified, the surveyor would balance the ferramentum or groma, as 
it was sometimes called, and visually sight an alignment taken on a graduated staff set 
up at a mark formed from boundary markers or physical features such as boulders, trees, 
rivers and even man-made structures like walls or aqueducts.339 
While the text quoted above might suggest that this was only done over short 
distances for the organisation of civic land, evidence discussed more fully in the last 
chapter of this study shows that sighting could be done between points that were as 
much as thirty kilometres apart.340 However, whether a surveyor sighted a target near or 
far, he visually created an abstract line in the landscape derived from the rays projected 
by the eye discussed in section 2.4 above. Such an abstract line of sight could only be 
given form when the surveyors, their assistants or apprentices walked its length and 
measured the distance between nodes using the decempeda, measuring cords or fine 
lengths of chain.341 By walking the length between two nodes, the surveyor transformed 
the abstract line of sight into a path, whose length was quantified as what Ingold would 
term a connector or a line of transport.342 As a line of connection, the rigor exists from 
the moment the surveyor sights it, marks the two points and calls them to his assistant 
for inclusion in the documentation of the survey. The quantification of the rigor through 
the measured walk, which transforms it into a connector, allows the surveyor to have 
power over the line as a boundary in much the same way that Serafina Cuomo and Alice 
Knig have demonstrated that numeracy allowed scribes and aqueduct administrators to 
gain regulatory control over water, grain and other commodities by describing them 
exactly in quantitative terms.343 
As the inscriptions quoted above illustrate, the measurements defining a boundary 
were not always cited in legal documentation, since a boundary could function as a 
means of defining social identity in terms of space without reference to its quantitative 
description. It was enough for the markers forming the nodal points of the boundarys

course to be recognised by the respective parties on either side of the line and the 
imperial administrators responsible for enforcing order. The quantitative value was only 
important when the structural integrity of the boundary was under threat and the 
presiding magistrate needed to demonstrate exact control over the boundaries. 
An illustrative example of this principle comes from the text of the decretum 
issued by Titus Flavius Monomitos, surveyor and judge in a dispute between 
Lakedaimon and Messene, issued sometime between the 15th and 31st of December 78 
AD. Monomitos, an imperial freedman and surveyor, marked out the line of what was 
reported to be an ancestral boundary snaking its way across the mountainous 
topography from one inscribed marker to another, in order to resolve a dispute over the 
exact location and extent of the boundary between the two communities in what was 
probably an on-going battle for control over the Temple of Artemis Lemnatis (Figs. 2.4 
and 2.5).344 The markers he established formed a natural monument of order and power 
out of the mountainside that could be experienced as a living expression of the Greek 
collective memory, which could be mathematically described and mapped.345 
Monomitos presented the distances for this boundary as a list of precise measurements 
between individual markers to illustrate his detailed knowledge of the boundarys 
relationship to the landscape and its structural integrity. In so doing, he asserted full 
control over the boundary to forestall any chicanery on the part of either group, in much 
the same way that Frontinus presentation of exact pipe-sizes allowed him to obtain 
control over the flow of water from the aqueducts, putting a stop to water-fraud at 
Rome.346

Obtaining the necessary authority to shape or reshape those social constructions meant 
appropriating and syncretising local systems for constructing land as place with Roman 
approaches. While not all groups in the Roman world quantified the land they owned, in 
order to structure it as a place of habitation, the majority seem to have done so in one 
way or another. As several passages of the Corpus Agrimensorum show, numeracy, as 
an expression of material objects such as the number of cattle a person owned or the 
amount of land occupied, was a common social convention in many places and there 
were many different quantitative systems used throughout the Empire.347 While most of 
those systems of calculation were doubtless based on measurements taken from the 
human body, adapting those units or expressing Roman calculations for an area of land 
in them forced surveyors to be far more conversant in what Quintilian referred to as 
numerical calculation and the proofs for figures.348 More importantly, they had to be 
able to work with both systems simultaneously before an audience who might or might 
not understand what it was that the surveyors were doing. 
For most intellectuals, numerical calculations and geometric proofs for figures 
with their labelled diagrams were treated as two distinctly separate branches of 
theoretical mathematics. This was also evident for Quintilian, who thought in terms of 
the mathematical tradition founded by Aristotle, Euclid and Archimedes. However, in a 
movement crucial for the surveyors intellectual coalescence, scholars in the Hellenistic 
Period developed an intellectual framework that integrated numerical calculations into 
the proofs for figures as a complete system for the production of geometric 
demonstrations used to resolve practical problems on a theoretical level. The best 
surviving example of this mathematical tradition are the writings of Hero of Alexandria. 
Recently, Karin Tybjerg has explored Heros philosophical project of adapting the 
work of Euclid and Archimedes to the needs of practical mathematics.349 Anchoring 
himself firmly in the tradition linking the development of geometry to the division and 
organisation of land, Hero explored the purely abstract mathematics of Archimedes and

gradually included numeric computations as a part of the geometric proofs.350 As he 
developed his arguments, Hero gradually withdrew the Euclidian proofs with purely 
abstract lettered diagrams in favour of proofs supported by diagrams constructed around 
mechanical instruments, such as the sliding ruler and dioptra (Fig. 2.6) used to solve 
real-world problems.351 
This insistence for what Thomas Heath has called alternative proofs for 
Archimedes mathematics, as well as an encyclopaedic interest in land division and 
mechanics, has led scholars to consider Hero a practical author focused on utility rather 
than a complete understanding of theoretical mathematics.352 But this straightforward 
reading obscures a deeper philosophical agenda permeating Heros writings, which have 
only recently been explicated by Serafina Cuomo, Karin Tybjerg and Cortney Roby.353 
Hero used a complete understanding of Euclidian mathematics to blur notions of 
geometrical and physical space, mechanical and geometrical objects, practical and 
theoretical concerns. He intellectualised the disciplines of mechanics and surveying to 
make the moral and philosophical claim that advancements in mathematics, when 
applied to human problems could bring order, justice and tranquillity to a troubled 
world. 
Drawing on the argument that there are similarities between the writings of Hero, 
Frontinus and Balbus, and that Heros work predates that of the Corpus Agrimensorum, 
Jean-Yves Guillaumin, Gerard Chouquer and Cortney Roby have argued that Heros 
scholarship deeply influenced the theoretical development of Roman surveying.354 
Guillaumin and Roby are unquestionably correct to point out that Roman surveyors, like 
Hero, integrated visual observations, instrumentation and Greek mathematical theory to 
discuss the organisation of land as part of a wider philosophical discourse, even as they 
adapted those numerical and geometric concepts to fit the organisation of land through a

variety of different quantitative systems.355 Yet such similarities do not in and of 
themselves prove that Hero was the primary source of inspiration for the authors in the 
Corpus Agrimensorum. Recently, Ramon Masia has shown that the text of the passage 
of the dioptra describing a lunar eclipse used to date Heros life is both corrupted in the 
original manuscript, and that the language of the passage fits a hypothetical 
mathematical demonstration rather than a historical narrative.356 As a demonstration, the 
description of the eclipse, like heros discussion of a hyperbolic harbour, should be read 
more as an assertion about what surveyors can do when they apply theoretical thinking 
to transpose reality and the abstract plain of pure geometry than as a report about any 
real world event.357 In light of this, scholars cannot use Heros text to date the period in 
which the scholar wrote, since it formed part of a rhetorical discourse. It is more than 
likely that the similarities in subject matter and rhetorical strategy scholars have found 
in Hero, Frontinus and Balbus reflect intellectual discourse between a group of near 
contemporaries who all drew on the same Hellenistic texts and traditions.358 
 While surveyors and scholars such as Balbus and Hero doubtless conducted this 
intellectual discourse as part of cultural and intellectual rivalry, the authors in the 
Corpus Agrimensorum, unlike Hero of Alexandria, focused more on how people could 
inhabit the landscape than on the mechanics of organising the landscape itself. They 
also assumed that their audience understood the fundamental relationship between 
observation, instrumentation and the integration of numerical and geometric theorems 
for the organisation of land as property. Only Balbus, in his manual on the elements of 
surveying, provides a detailed explanation of the mathematical taxonomy of boundaries 
used to accomplish the task: 
Each observation of measurements begins and ends with a point. A point is 
something which cannot be divided. This is significant to the investigation 
of all perimeters. Indeed, a point without division is the starting-point from 
which all things begin. A perimeter is the point up to which an individuals 
right of possession is granted, or the point up to which each person 
maintains their own (property). There are two kinds of perimeter, one which

is recognised by means of a straight-line boundary [rigor], the other by 
means of an irregular one [flexus]. A straight-line boundary [rigor] is 
whatever is observed to extend between two points as if it were a perfectly 
straight line; an irregular boundary [flexus] (is recognised) when anything 
curves to follow the nature of the terrain, as is customary in arcifinial land 
[ager arcifinius]. The decumanus is a calculated length, as is the cardo, 
when two straight boundary lines [rigores] have been constituted into a 
single (boundary), with the space for a roadway coming in between the 
individual (boundaries). Whatever occurs out in the field through the need 
for measurement in order to produce a straight boundary [finis rectus], is 
called a straight-line boundary [rigor]. Whatever is drawn to reproduce 
these (boundaries) on a map [forma] is referred to as a line [linea].359 
The translation presented here is intended to highlight the intellectual distinctions 
Balbus was making, which simultaneously blended the Euclidian definitions of a point 
and line with the Peripatetic understanding of a place as the space contained within set 
perimeters, defined by the places relationship to other physical elements.360 A key 
component of his taxonomic explanation was that the line started from a prime point or 
locus gromae, and visually connected points to form the perimeter.361 The perimeter 
marked out on the ground and the abstract line drawn on a map to represent that line of 
sight were two physical and intellectual elements, which were quite distinct and 
separate from the line of sight that gave rise to them. A boundary was marked by 
physical objects that could be investigated, but those objects only formed the boundary 
line when a surveyor sighted a line or what Balbus termed a rigor between them out in 
the field. 
This reflects the distinction between the act of transformation that initially 
established markers and the act of recovery, which re-established markers as forming a 
boundary, as was outlined above. The line drawn on the map by contrast,  as a drawn 
length without breadth between two points, whether straight, circular or curving, was a 
symbolic mediator between the abstract ideal of what space should be like and the 
reality on the ground.

As Courtney Roby has observed, the mathematical principles of the line as Balbus 
explains it, allowed the surveyors to mentally shift a set of objects which began as 
points in the landscape, pinned to predetermined lines of sight, back and forth between 
the physical landscape and an intellectual abstraction of it, formed within a 
mathematical framework.362 Doing so allowed surveyors to render real-world objects 
describable and therefore knowable and controllable on a metaphysical level found in 
surveyors maps and commentaria.363 
While Guillaumin has suggested that much of the contents of the work written by 
Balbus was derived directly from the writings of Euclid or Hero of Alexandria, 
problems in the transmission of the text make direct attributions difficult.364 There are 
grounds for believing that Balbus was not simply translating the mathematical concepts 
of these authors into Latin, however, but rather, like Vitruvius, was engaged in an 
enterprise to adapt, develop and explain the application of Greek theory for surveyors 
on both an intellectual and practical basis.365 First, at the end of his introduction, Balbus 
states that he was granted a one-year leave from the legions by the emperor to write a 
book on surveying procedures and that he had gathered up his notes to incorporate fresh 
ideas into the canon of the surveyors craft.366 This shows that there were core 
procedural practices that all surveyors were expected to master and the writings of 
Aristotle, Euclid, Eratosthenes, Archimedes and Hero are all likely candidates for Greek 
authors included as part of that canonical learning.367 
 More importantly, Balbus groups a number of Euclidian definitions together into 
discrete periods, whose final thought is demonstrated with real-world examples, which 
frequently reflect the problems faced by surveyors out in the field. In addition, the 
earliest version of Balbus work, preserved in the manuscript held at the Herzog August 
Bibliothek, also contains illustrations that were embedded in the text in a manner that 
suggests that they were intended as a functional part of the discussion rather than

decoration. Reviel Netz has argued that the diagram is not a representation of something 
else; it is the thing itself. It is not like a representation of a building, it is like a building, 
acted upon and constructed.368 Karin Tybjerg and Steffen Bogen have adapted Netzs 
argument in their assessment of the diagrams in Hero of Alexandrias work. They argue 
that Hero and perhaps other Hellenistic thinkers drew on the work of Aristotle to adapt 
the lettered diagram to reflect instrumentation, which blurred the boundary between the 
manipulation of purely mathematical objects presented in a text, and mechanical objects 
grounded in the real world through the imagination of the reader.369 
Michael Squire, in a detailed examination of the paintings in the House of 
Propertius at Assisi, has also emphasised the role of imagination in unveiling the multi-
valenced readings for literary texts embedded alongside images and the interdependence 
which existed between the two.370 All of this suggests that the late antique scribes, who 
produced the text of Balbus, intended the reader to use the figures as a vehicle for 
imagining how the geometric principles discussed could be introduced into the 
landscape and the ways in which features of the landscape could be represented in 
diagrams. 
 The interplay between Euclidian theorem, graphical depiction and physical 
action in the discursive strategies employed by surveyors comes through in the three 
sections of Balbus text, immediately following the passage quoted above. In the first of 
these sections, Balbus explains the difference between the straight line, the circular line 
and the irregular or curving line. The first stretches between two points, the second 
cannot be sighted easily, since its path takes it out of the line of sight and the irregular 
line is described as being like a river, a mountain chain or the boundary for ager 
arcifinius.371 The text is interspersed with two diagrams. The first illustrates the straight, 
circular and irregular lines as pure geometric objects (Fig. 2.7), while the second 
illustrates the nature of the curving or irregular line, as he describes it in the text as 
being the edge of an irregular field, a winding river flowing past a cylindrical tower and 
a mountain chain (Fig. 2.8). The field illustrates the interplay between the straight and 
irregular line, while the river shows the interplay of the irregular line of the river

moving past the circular form of the tower. The mountains reflect an object represented 
by the irregular line alone. Individually, neither the text nor the diagrams convey the 
concept that one was expected to conceptualise the Euclidian definitions as lines in a 
document or that those lines should be applied to features in the landscape, which could 
and would need to be represented using mathematics in a document. The transposition 
of mathematical objects and real world features into the representational plain of the 
document only comes when the diagram and text are considered together. 
 Balbus and his scribal copyist continued the exercise in two more surviving 
sections. Next Balbus explained the nature of a surface in a passage whose 
interpretation has been disputed by Guillaumin and Campbell:372 
The surface, according to geometric terminology, is something which has 
only length and breadth. Lines (form) the boundaries of a surface. A level 
surface is one which has been laid out uniformly with straight lines. 
Moreover, there are two ways of sighting the measurements of all surfaces: 
enormis and liquis. An enormis (surface) is one which is contained within 
right angles around the whole field. A liquis (surface) is one which, for the 
sake of reducing the labour involved and to maintain the principle of right 
angles, is subtended according to the (shape) of the perimeter itself.373 
Guillaumin has argued that the term observationes, which has been translated as 
sighting here, should be considered a Latin term reflecting a genus of measurement, 
while contemplatio was used to render theorema or thearum.374 Campbell rejected the 
notion out of hand without providing an explanation in his commentary.375 Such a 
perfunctory dismissal of scholarship done by Guillaumin, who is one of the leading 
authorities on the Corpus Agrimensorum, is unusual for Campbell, though his 
commentary on Balbus is much less comprehensive than those done for other authors. 
Guillaumin based his interpretation upon the use of mathematical terminology, the 
structure of the text following the explanation of points and lines, and above all the 
conviction that Balbus adapted his mathematical materials directly from Euclid and 
Hero of Alexandria.376 While this suggestion does great credit to Guillaumins 
philological genius, their do seem to be reasons to question it.

First, Balbus uses the terms genus and species in their geometrical sense only a 
few lines later to categorise several types of angle.377 Second, ascribing a spatial 
meaning to observations here may be possible, but it would be unique and unparalleled 
by any of the other uses of the word in Balbus or any of the authors in the Corpus 
Agrimensorum. Third, as has already been mentioned, Balbus stated that he intended to 
discuss the development of practical applications for theoretical concepts in his 
introduction, which would make his agenda quite different from Euclid or Hero. As a 
consequence, one should be wary of trying to see too close a parallel between Balbus 
and his Greek originals. Fourth, the vocabulary of the passage itself is full of subtle 
references to the active pursuit of measurement in the field, which include: a) 
observationes as a term for sighting the limits of a surface; b) actus, which usually 
means a subdivision of a survey, a field or a right of way for cattle, as the term used for 
the area of a surface; c) labor as the term for the effort in constructing the area of the 
surface itself. Such vocabulary reflects an actual surveying operation mediated by 
mathematical formulas rather than a purely abstract formation of geometric figures. 
The illustrations for this section, which are crucial for understanding what it was 
that Balbus was describing, are an interesting contrast to the active language of the 
passage. The illustration (Fig. 2.9) shows two geometric figures. One of the figures 
illustrates what seems to be a rectangle with an intrusion at one side, representing a field 
laid out with four nearly equal sides with right angles. The other figure (Fig. 2.10) 
shows an abstract square with a jagged edge at the bottom, where it would be 
impossible to form right angles. The first shape was presumably intended to reflect an 
enormous field while the other was liquis. The combination of language and image 
should probably be taken as a reflection of the fusion between abstract principles and 
concrete reality, which was the focus of Balbus exposition rather than as direct proof 
for Guillaumins interpretation. 
 The full import of the surveyors use of mathematics to structure land in this 
fashion comes out in one final passage of Balbus, which forms the terminus to his 
discussion of angles. Balbus, having detailed all the Euclidian categories for angles,

Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             108 
 
their relationship to one another, and the ways one can form angles from circles and 
curves, observes: 
Still, all those irregularities in shape can be enclosed and divided up with 
measured lines. For example, a line with many curves can be brought under 
measurement, to the extent which the nature of the site itself allows, by 
which it most nearly approximates a straight line or the circumference of a 
circle, if the boundary is recognised by boundary markers, marked trees, or 
ditches, or roads, or by mountain ridges and watersheds.378 
While Balbus does not provide the details for the system of geometric 
approximation he mentions, David Romano has shown how the cadastral grid, formed 
from shallow furrows or trenches, was able to follow the curving shore-line of the 
Corinthian Gulf using a system of right triangles to create offsets.379 Romanos 
reproduction of the street-grid found in Roman Corinth (Figs. 2.11 and 2.12) alongside 
the text of Balbus prove that the surveyors used geometric principles to adapt straight 
lines of sighting to the shape of land on both a theoretical and practical level. The full 
implications of this for Roman systems of land management will be considered below, 
but it is important to recognise that the surveyors brought geometric principles to the 
organisation of any topographical formation found in the landscape.380 
Mathematics was a quantitative method of mentally structuring the perimeter of 
land to transform it into a place circumscribed by topographical markers connected by 
lines of sight. The markers, and lines of sight connecting them, intellectually enclosed 
an area of land much as the sea encloses and defines the shape and structure of an 
island.381 However, where the island was separated from other portions of land by the 
water, a section of land defined by the abstract lines of sight (or rigores to use Balbus 
term), could touch, overlap or even enclose other portions of land. In order to restore the 
truth of a place, to use Frontinus phrasing, a surveyor had to define a place 
taxonomically in quantitative and qualitative terms.382 It was not enough for the

they formed. They also had to define the qualities of a site by establishing the title to the 
place by identifying the lawful owners by name.383 
This was true whether the surveyor was dealing with an individual fundus or the 
territory of an entire community. Indeed, each fundus, whose boundaries were defined 
in this way, was attached to a community. It in turn had its own outer boundaries 
defined and those outer boundaries touched upon the boundaries of other communities, 
which merged together to form a region or a province, defined by boundaries and the 
pathways that connected settlements to one another.384 
2.8 The Law of Numbers and a Number of Laws: Agrimensores, Jurists 
and the Taxonomy of Land 
While the geometric principles discussed here may seem like academic abstractions, 
they were grounded in material lines, which were formed by both looking at and  more 
importantly  walking in the landscape. The geometric descriptions of land as a place 
and the over-lapping legal taxonomy of land-ownership in the Roman world formed the 
intersection between the lived experience of those who inhabited the landscape and the 
administrative norms of the imperial magistrates, who were responsible for tax-
collection and the enforcement of the law. As inscriptions considered in the next chapter 
will show, most land-holders were predominantly concerned with the physical marking 
of boundaries and the control of property under local law, but Roman administrators 
were concerned with the documentation and the qualitative justification for ownership 
used to regulate relationships between people.385 This meant that the surveyors had to 
engage with Roman juridical thinking, both in the formation of boundaries and in the 
resolution of disputes that arose from the formal organisation of land. 
As the passages from Balbus indicate, the surveyors all grouped land into un-
surveyed ager arcifinius and surveyed land, which was classified by Frontinus as either

ager adsignatus or ager divisus et adsignatus.386 The distinction between categories of 
surveyed land was largely political, based on the level of internal intervention, 
involving geometric construction: ager adsignatus was enclosed by an outer boundary 
but its internal division into regular geometric blocks only existed on paper if at all, 
while ager divisus et adsignatus was always formally divided into square units by a grid 
of limites marked out on the ground.387 
Ager arcifinius was land occupied by individual claimants without a formal 
survey. Since its extent was defined through topographical features, which were not 
always quantitatively defined, any maps or documents drafted by the occupants as a 
means of establishing the extent of a holding and ownership of the place were not 
binding under the ius civilis, though rights of occupation presumably held sway under 
the ius gentium.388 This meant that in the event of litigation, surveyors were not 
automatically involved and the extent of their involvement would have been determined 
by the nature of the case. 
This also meant that surveyors had to classify disputes from the individual 
qualities and characteristics presented in description of the dispute found in the litis 
contestatio worked out by the presiding magistrate.389 A surveyor, as Frontinus and the 
author of the De Generibus Controversiarum explained, normally only investigated 
cases involving: the deposition and erosion of land by rivers, boundaries or boundary 
markers, site, area, the law relating to subseciva and territorial jurisdiction. However, 
they could also be called in to deal with problems involving ownership, possession, the 
character of public or sacred and religious places, the control of rain water and rights of 
way.390 The involvement of a surveyor in each of these types of litigation depended 
upon the existence of a boundary-line, the physical location of a given place within a 
site defined by boundaries or the extent of a given section of land.391 There were many

instances, however, where a legal dispute would normally come under the surveyors 
proper sphere of activity, but in which the surveyor could not take any action because of 
legal or administrative considerations. For example, surveyors usually investigated 
disputes over property resulting from erosion in fluvial land, but where the dispute 
involved ager arcifinius or occupatorius, as it was sometimes called, the surveyor could 
not act since the extent of the site was not documented on a legally-binding forma or 
map.392 Thus, in each case, the surveyors actions were entirely determined by the 
existence of boundaries and the classification of the site. 
 Both the classification of a site and the formation of boundaries were governed 
by a number of legal conventions, and the authors of the Corpus Agrimensorum cite a 
number of leges or imperial edicta to explain specific surveying procedures or to 
establish their position within the wider imperial social hierarchy. What is perhaps most 
remarkable about the surveyors use of jurisprudence is the close relationship that they 
created between it and what has been termed the law of numbers discussed above. The 
most pronounced example of the practice comes from the De Controversis Agrorum of 
Agennius Urbicus. In passages which echo the spirit of Balbus, Urbicus praises 
geometry first as the discipline which reveals the size and nature of the universe and 
then as the mother-lode of rational inquiry, orderly thought and natural philosophy.393 
Then, he explains that all disputes could be resolved either through surveying or 
through different branches of the law, and introduced a legal proposition couched in 
terms of geometry: 
A rather complicated discussion is called for with reference to a boundary, 
which in no way differs from a rigor except in appearance. We must discuss 
them carefully, for whenever we speak of a boundary or a rigor, no trifling 
enquiry begins, whether we should recognise one or more lines, or whether 
the Lex Mamilia may not prescribe a width for the boundary. Legal experts 
are still discussing this law and are unable to explain properly the meaning 
of the archaic language, that is, whether 10 feet of width should be allocated 
(on either side of a central line), or five feet only. These people, however, 
think that five feet constitutes the (total) width, so that each piece of land 
allows the boundary to stretch to a width of two and a half feet.394

Here, Urbicus sets out the proposition that the surveyors ability to establish 
boundaries hinged on the jurists interpretation of what a boundary should be under the 
terms of the Lex Mamilia, which stipulated that a right of way at least five feet wide be 
maintained between two or more adjacent properties.395 The question at issue was 
whether there should be five feet on either side of a rigor as a line of site without 
substance, creating a gap of ten feet formed from three rigores, or should a gap of five 
feet be left between two rigores, forming a right of way after the fashion of Balbus 
kardo and decumanus. Most of the jurists and surveyors felt that the law called for a 
five-foot gap between two rigores, which could not be appropriated by right of 
occupation, whether a site was defined as adsignatus or arcifinius, as is shown by 
Urbicus and the passage of Hyginus quoted above in Section 2.4 describing methods for 
recognising a boundary.396 Thus, at least in theory, every fundus or estate was 
surrounded, bounded and stitched into the fabric of the landscape by a series of 
pathways whose existence could not be alienated. 
However, not all rights of way in the Empire were created equal, nor were they 
constructed in the same way. The author of the De Limitibus, attributed to Hyginus, 
provides the information that a further piece of legislation, which may have been 
introduced by Augustus, stipulated that a colonial founder could establish any width for 
the cardo and decumanus maximus so long as they were at least twelve feet wide, but all 
other limites of a colony had to be more than eight feet wide.397 The same legislation 
also seems to have stipulated that the quintarius or every sixth limes in a colonial 
pertica be wider than the others and yet narrower than the decumanus maximus.398 Like 
the generic right-of-way between holdings, discussed by Agennius Urbicus, Roman law 
further stipulated that the limites through a colony be kept clear even if it meant 
providing a detour through a field or keeping slaves on duty day and night to open 
doors, so that travellers could pass through a building constructed across one.399 
While the jurists were concerned with access to rights of way, they did not use the

same terminology and were much less concerned with the physical structure of the path 
or road than the surveyors. As Alan Kaiser has noted in his book on urban street 
networks, the jurists never use the terms decumanus and kardo and the term limes 
appears only once in the Digest.400 Rather, the jurists drew on the more commonly used 
vocabulary of agriculture to define rights of way, as places in which people were 
allowed to undertake specific forms of locomotion, rather than physical spaces defined 
by a particular set of geometrical or political qualities.401 An iter was an area in which 
people were granted an easement to walk, but where they were not allowed to drive a 
beast of burden or a vehicle, while an actus was a place where one could walk and 
drive, but where specific forms of transport or portage were prohibited.402 An aqua 
ductus was a specific servitude to draw or transport water, usually across land owned by 
another party.403 A via was the only place where a servitude for walking, driving and 
unlimited transport, excluding the drawing of water, was granted.404 
While some of the jurists were interested in the various grades of via, which were 
determined by their physical dimensions and the administrative body responsible for 
maintenance, it was the surveyor who most frequently applied these categories along 
with the concepts of transport just outlined. Like the other activities undertaken by the 
surveyors, these principles were applied either in a recuperative or transformative 
capacity. In a recuperative capacity surveyors such as Siculus Flaccus measured and 
assessed both roads and rivers to establish whether the local population treated them as 
an iter, actus or via used to provide access to property, or if they were considered to be 
the line of a boundary.405 A via was either privata, vicinalis, pagana or publica with 
boundaries being set most frequently along the last type of road.406 
This legislation and the way in which Agennius Urbicus and the author of the De 
Limitibus discuss it introduce two points, which the writings of Balbus quoted above 
only hint at. First, in defining the pathways for settlement sites, which were formally

adsignatus, the power to define space in quantitative terms was subordinated to and 
regulated by the jurists and Roman administrators appointed by the emperor. Second, 
the jurists and surveyors alike defined settlement sites in terms of the paths of 
movement, which enclosed and connected them. However, the jurists and surveyors 
present different aspects for the criteria used for assigning a legal status to a piece of 
land. Jurists and Roman administrators were predominantly concerned with the nature 
of habitation at a site, its scale and the tax status of the inhabitants. For example, a 
fundus was any farmstead enclosed by boundaries, while a locus was either a portion of 
a fundus or else a fundus in its own right, depending on how its extent was defined by 
surveyors. A vicus was a dense collection of dwellings in town or country connected by 
viae without being enclosed by its own walls.407 The status of the fundus or vicus would 
be determined by whether it was administratively speaking attached to a colonia, 
municipia, civitas or some other form of settlement. 
The surveyors, on the other hand were more interested in them as a guide to the 
history of occupation at a site and the proper structure of the landscape, though they 
freely used this civic taxonomy.408 This interest in the history of land-holding, and the 
status of the community in which it was held, can clearly be seen in the passages quoted 
above in section 2.3. In the first of these three passages, Siculus Flaccus discusses the 
problems introduced by a legal challenge to the territorial boundaries of a pagus 
attached to a civitas and the need for an investigation to resolve the dispute, which 
includes a study of who might be responsible for providing munera to the cursus 
publicus and the ways in which sacrifices were performed. For Flaccus, the structure of 
a territory was defined by the quantitative limits, containing a specific cultural identity 
which was itself shaped by the history of habitation in a region. 
The second and third passages reflect the problems which developed when the 
pattern of land-holding was disrupted by local land-holders, who bought and sold land 
in a community, whose territory was adsignatus using topographical features rather 
than in respect of the field systems recorded on the map or in the documentary record. 
The last reflects discrepancies between physical patterns of land-holding seen in the

field and the records of settlement found on the maps due to historical circumstances. In 
all three instances, the surveyors were concerned with individuals unwillingness to 
accept the physical dimensions that were assigned to a particular place defined by a 
legal taxonomic status at a particular moment in time. 
2.9 From Ager to Forma: Mathematics, Law and Place on the 
Surveyors Map 
While the passages quoted in section 2.3 do not show it, it was on the forma or 
surveyors map that their interest in the history of land-holding, Roman law and 
mathematics combined on a fundamental level. The essence of this lies in the 
observations of Balbus about the relationship between the perimeter, the rigor as an 
abstract line of site and the linea or line which was drawn on the forma to represent the 
perimeter, formed in the field by the connection of points using rigores. The use of the 
abstracted straight line of a rigor to interpolate the course of a river, forming what 
Siculus Flaccus terms a rivus rectus or proper river boundary, was a transformative act 
shifting the principles of geometry into the landscape to create a circular, triangular or 
rectangular pattern of interconnected pathways, which could be perceived in the minds 
of those who experienced their formation.409 
The projection of that pattern into a document whose contents was composed of 
letters, lines and numbers, drawn on the surface of a board or papyrus sheet, however, 
was a further transformative action shifting points in the real world into the abstract, 
symbolic plane of the mathematical diagram.410 For anyone who understood the 
symbols on the document and the relationship between the figure in the document and 
its relationship to the structure of landscape, the abstracted diagram would allow him to 
gain an understanding of the landscape, or at least the relationship between the features 
marked in the figure without ever really visiting it. More importantly, the figures in the 
diagram could be inscribed with political meaning and the power of ownership in ways 
that could only be achieved out in the field through the creation of a monumental 
inscription, such as the stone markers discussed earlier in this chapter.

As a consequence, the forma could display features that a surveyor intended to 
exist in the landscape, but which could only exist on the abstract plane of thought, 
making it a transformative tool that could not only illustrate how the landscape had been 
shaped by the surveyors, but also how it should be conceptualised on an ideal level by 
inhabitants and administrators alike.411 Features of this transformative power will be 
explored more fully at the ends of Chapters 3 and 4. However, to appreciate how the 
surveyors brought their skills in mathematics, the discernment of history and the jurists 
legal formulations together in this one document, it is worth closing this chapter by 
looking at the construction of the colonial pertica or gridded landscape, where the 
application of all these features met both on the ground and in the documents. 
For the authors of the Corpus Agrimensorum, the creation of a colony was a 
formal ritual act with its own formula, which was overseen by the person appointed by 
the emperor to establish the new community and at least some representatives from the 
body of colonists.412 According to the formula outlined in the Corpus Agrimensorum, 
the colony needed to be oriented so that the main streets of the decumanus maximus and 
cardo maximus were extended perpendicularly outward from a single point at the centre 
of the site through four cardinal gates.413 Beyond the walls, the pomerium and land set 
aside for tombs separated the urban fabric from agricultural land, which was divided by 
limites.414 Where the land claimed for the colony came to an end, a flexus would form 
the outer boundary separating the colonial pertica from the territory of other 
communities.415 
However, surveyors understood that this was an ideal derived from the concept 
that each colony was expected to develop from a castra as an expression of permanent 
Roman control, which was never realised in practice. Instead, all of the authors in the 
Corpus Agrimensorum stress the need to adapt the layout of a pertica to the

topographical conditions within which it was established.416 Since not all the sites 
chosen for colonial foundations could be organised using a grid of limites, the creation 
of a Roman colony always involved both a close dialogue with the landscape and a 
compromise between what the surveyors wanted to create and what the landscape 
would allow. This is amply illustrated by the fact that, in situations where none of the 
land around a site chosen for the colonial urban complex was suitable for the formation 
of limites, additional land for agriculture was allocated in a praefectura elsewhere.417 
Roman tradition from the time of Caesar onward called for this land to be 
organised into centuries, comprised of two hundred iugera, each of which contained 
twenty square actus of one hundred and twenty square feet. But the Corpus 
Agrimensorum reports instances where allocations of land were made based on 
centuries of two hundred and thirty five, three hundred and ten or four hundred 
iugera.418 Moreover, archaeological investigations have revealed centuries which range 
from two to sixty six iugera.419 The dynamic range and formation of the landscape 
reported both in the Corpus Agrimensorum and by archaeological investigation using 
field-walking, aerial reconnaissance, satellite imaging and historical records, show that 
Roman settlement sites of every size need to be viewed as fragmentary, dynamic 
historiographical records of on-going human occupation, whose development has been 
driven by a range of factors.420 
While the first Roman colonial field system identified by Captain Falbe in 1833 
was visible on the ground through the remains of roads, stone walls and boundary 
markers, which showed that it was oriented due north using sun and stars, not all Roman 
field systems are quite so obvious or canonical.421 Even at well preserved sites such as 
Corinth, where David Romano has demonstrated that the surveyors mathematical 
precision was as accurate as can be expected without modern computers, Roman grids 
tended to be oriented well off of true north to take topographical features into

consideration.422 More importantly, Romano has conclusively shown how the surveyors 
adjusted limites to merge existing iugera with fresh additions to a pertica to expand and 
alter the profile of a community.423 Where survey trenches cut one another, one should 
suspect that the agrimensores have been at work to alter or otherwise obliterate the 
topographical features, which formed the physical matrix of a communitys collective 
memory. In extreme cases where survey trenches totally overlay and erase the traces of 
an earlier community, it is likely that Roman politics required the complete 
refoundation of a colony, as surely as Roman warfare could destroy a city and force its 
rebuilding. 
One difficulty in assessing the actual impact of the surveyors craft on the 
landscape in relationship to the principles outlined in the Corpus Agrimensorum, is 
simply the fact that the more obvious physical remains of their activities have been 
obliterated. This is particularly true where the surveyors created limites without actually 
creating formal roads, whose bedding might be expected to stand the test of time. To 
overcome this obstacle, several archaeologists have turned to wetland studies, bio-
archaeology and the study of historical transformation of the landscape to look at the 
impact of transformative processes on the landscape. Three important studies using 
wetland studies, pollen sample analysis and modern satellite surveying were recently 
undertaken at the cities of Arles, Valentia and Tarraco. 
In the Valle des Baux on the eastern edge of the plain of Arles, recent work 
undertaken by Philippe Leveau using geomorphology has demonstrated the close 
relationship between the mathematical precision, involved in aqueduct construction, 
drainage ditches, Roman field systems and the recovery of land from wetlands in a 
long-term development of a micro-regional urban landscape.424 The aqueduct, which 
was far more complicated than the one created by Nonius Datus at Saldae in Africa 
discussed in the previous chapter, began in the mountains north of Arles, ran west for 37 
Km before turning south and then east through Durance to reach the site of Vallon des 
Arcs, where a secondary branch fed into it before the entire course ran another 13 Km to

the city.425 This monumental water course required exact orientation using shadowsticks 
or portable sundials and a high degree of exact measurement in three dimensions 
simultaneously. In addition, there was also a series of drainage ditches that pumped 
water from the centre of the Valle des Baux, preventing a natural rise in the regional 
water table from flooding land recovered from the wetlands for agriculture.426 The exact 
nature and extent of the mathematics used in both of these operations remain elusive, 
but the drainage ditches and the complex design of the aqueduct seem to reflect a 
sustained development of the landscape, where regular fields which might reflect a 
surveyors pertica played a key part in agriculture and the maintenance of the citys 
urban infrastructure.427 
At the same time, environmental core samples and pollen tests have been taken 
from the pertica identified from topographical features using field walking and satellite 
photography in the area around Valentia and Tarraco. These data show that surveyed 
areas located within the grid of limites were not equally exploited as investigation of 
Roman mining sites and agricultural areas in other regions suggest they should have 
been.428 While some sections of the grids identified at Valentia and Tarraco were 
intensively manured and cultivated, there were also many grid sections that remained 
forested and unoccupied. This suggests that the Roman survey at Tarraco may have 
enclosed more land than was needed for agriculture by the colonists, something which 
was certainly true at Emerita further south.429 
The wooded zones may also suggest that the archaeologists working at Tarraco 
have identified sections of either ager relictus or ager extraclusus, two subcategories of 
subsecivum which were not included in formal allocations, either because of rough 
terrain or else because the plot was an irregular section which lay outside the pertica 
and inside the circular perimeter of the colonys territorial control.430 Regardless of the 
political identity of the wooded sections of land at Tarraco, the distinctions between the 
land there and at the Wadi Faynan reflect environmental change. These distinctions

influenced the intensive development of agricultural lands structured by the surveyors 
introduction of limites. 
Other archaeologists have recently also pointed out that even when the surveyors 
established limites to create a pertica to organise agricultural practices at a colonial site, 
it was simply one more act of human agency structuring a landscape that had its own 
historical and historiographical tradition.431 The pertica still had to fit within that 
narrative and connect with the wider pattern of travel routes and land tenure, no matter 
how transformative it may have been. The project at Valentia, along with projects at 
Braga and in the region around Tongeren, have recently been undertaken using aerial 
photographs, field walking, historical records and modern geographic information 
systems to build up a historical profile of each region in antiquity and the Middle 
Ages.432 The results from Braga and Tongeren have proven the most far-reaching. 
Preliminary data published up to 2010 show that several Medieval manors and 
churches around Braga, constructed well outside the boundaries of the old Roman city, 
were built in alignment with a 20 actus grid of limites, which interfaced directly with an 
older pre-existing road network derived from an Iron Age complex and linked the 
colony to the hinterland. A similar study of Roman settlement sites and field-systems 
derived more from escarpments and natural features than roads around Tongeren 
suggests that an extensive grid of limites, oriented 50 degrees west of north, influenced 
the orientation of 75% of all church buildings built before 1500.433 This would tend to 
suggest that the mathematical alignment of Roman field boundaries, using the 
geometrical principles outlined above, influenced the regions far beyond the previous 
settlement sites for which they were created, even as they were adjusted to take older 
road-networks which were still used into consideration. 
Furthermore, such a prolonged use of the system would tend to suggest an on-
going influence of sociological, administrative and political institutions, which valued 
the system of limites as an organisational principle for the regulation of agriculture and

travel. Indeed, recent studies further suggest that while there were practical advantages 
to the use of a grid of limites, much of the Romans interest in the system was 
administrative and ideological. Both the initial creation of the colony and the creation of 
a praefectura entitled taking land from other communities, which invariably meant that 
indigenous land-holders and Roman colonists occupied land alongside one another.434 
The creation of limites and geometrical patterns were therefore at once a direct act of 
appropriation and inclusion. On the one hand, the process appropriated the landscape 
walked and observed by the surveyors, and on the other it incorporated the identity of 
those who lived on the land into the Roman world by structuring, quantifying and 
providing legal standing for people before the Roman courts. 
 The key to this standing and inclusion was grounded in the documents produced 
by the surveyors detailing their findings and particularly in the forma or map, which 
could be used to negotiate the various features observed in the landscape back into an 
ideal conception of the world. As the bronze fragments of formae or cadastres from 
Arausio (Figs. 2.13 and 2.14) and Lacimurga show (Fig. 2.15), surveying documents 
could abstract features from the landscape, embrace them in limites that formed squares, 
attach names and political identities to those features and then project them in an image 
of the landscape not so much as it was experienced by individuals, but as it should be.435 
This distortion is most obvious in the Arausio fragment, which presents a grid whose 
physical remains show that it was oriented five degrees east of north as being aligned 
due north. This feature, which some scholars have postulated was introduced to the 
Arausio tablets to make it easier for readers to understand the data presented on the 
map, seems to also pervade the Lacimurga tablet, the illustrated maps attached to the 
manuscripts of the Corpus Agrimensorum and to some extent the Verona tablet as well 
(Fig. 2.16).436 While the desire for clarity may alone explain this irregularity, it does not 
take what the authors in the Corpus Agrimensorum say about this set of documents into 
consideration. 
Siculus Flaccus and Junius Nipsus provide the most basic information on the 
surveyors map. They explain that the forma or map of ager divisus et adsignatus was a

document which could be drafted on wooden boards, parchment, papyrus or bronze, but 
that it was customary for one draft to be made on perishable material and filed in the 
Imperial record office, while another was cast in bronze and hung up on the wall of a 
public building.437 Furthermore, Flaccus provides the valuable observation that, while 
people other than surveyors could produce maps of their land, only maps produced by 
surveyors, who were presumably commissioned by the government of a community or 
the imperial administration, were considered to be valid and binding documents under 
law.438 As the passage from the works of Balbus quoted above proves, each forma or 
map was comprised of lines drawn on the document in the manner of an art-work to 
represent a rigor, sighted out in the field. 
Moreover, the lines could be joined up in different ways to reflect different 
systems for organising land. As Flaccus observes, all maps should be one type of 
document, but some refer to land forming a pertica, others mention land organised by 
centuriation, others in terms of a measured area, some of land bounded by limites, some 
of land organised by cancellation or formal squares that were not centuries, and yet 
more to land comprised of a typon or the plan of a regular shape.439 Whatever the 
terminology attached to the map and whatever the structure of the land might be, the 
authors in the corpus were quite clear that it had to depict the limites. In fact, they were 
laid out with information about the orientation of the kardo and decumanus maximus, as 
well as notations for land under cultivation, wooded land, common pasture, subsiciva, 
land returned to the original inhabitants and other special categories of land-tenure, that 
reflected legal and political arrangements made by the founder of a colony or the 
magistrate responsible for organising the land of a civitas.440 
Such notations were inscribed on the Arausio and Verona tablets, but are absent 
from the Lacimurga fragment, a fact which caused Chouquer to warn that not all 
surviving fragments of bronze or marble formae may have been genuinely used as 
functional maps in antiquity.441 However, while fraudulent maps, as well as maps

created by people who were not authorised to do so, were a problem in antiquity, the 
absence of names on the fragment from Spain hardly seems to have enough justification 
for discounting the fragment. Above all, it may have been that the units shown on that 
particular part of the map were surveyed but not yet allocated to colonists at the time the 
forma was produced.442 The assignment of additional colonists, as well as changes in 
the status of individual allotments within the pertica, was the reason that the author of 
the De Conditionibus Agrorum insisted that surveyors check not only the laws 
establishing a colony and its associated forma, but also the commentaria, epistulae 
Caesaris and edicta to make sure that nothing had been added or changed after the 
initial foundation.443 As Arnaud and Campbell have demonstrated, such documents 
could almost always be found stored in either the colonial or provincial archives and in 
the imperial archives at Rome.444 
 Two final complications need to be taken into consideration before concluding 
this discussion. One is the fact that land marked off by limites in a pagus or which was 
simply adsignatus to a community without being divisus was also depicted on formae. 
Very little information has survived about what such documents looked like or how they 
may have been composed. The clearest statement on the matter comes from Frontinus, 
when he states that land assigned to communities as civic territory, the land of private 
owners and much of the provincial land subject to taxation was simply enclosed by an 
outer boundary and depicted this way on the forma. However, in some cases, civic land 
that was allocated in this way was depicted on the forma as if it had been given 
limites.445 This first suggests that land for private land-holders could be illustrated with 
the same methods as the land of a community or province, and that surveyors could 
draft the forma to depict features of the landscape, which did not truly exist in reality, 
but which the surveyors and their administrative superiors believed should be depicted 
to structure human relationships. 
The use of imaginary features as a bases for regulating land-use or tax collection 
within a pictorial record would have required the presence of extensive commentaria to 
provide explanations of what was intended. This suggests that the close relationship

between image and text postulated above for the writings of Balbus extended to other 
surveying documents as well. It also returns the discussion to the main point of Balbus 
text, which was that the rigor, formed between two markers, was the abstract line 
connecting both points in the landscape, and when it was drawn in a document 
transposing those physical points into the abstract plain. Jean-Yves Guillaumin argued 
in an article, which most scholars studying the forma agrimensorum have not 
considered: 
Ds lors, la forma elle-mme se trouve investie dune double nature, 
participant  la fois, si lon a recours au vocabulaire platonicien, du monde 
de lintelligible et du monde du sensible. Elle est dune part larchtype 
abstrait selon lequel se fera la division du terrain: grille parfaite, ensemble 
ordonn de carrs de valeur symbolique trs forte; et dautre part, 
matrialisation au sol de cette perfection, norme qui se traduit par le plan 
cadastral. A vrai dire, elle est intermdiaire entre l'intelligible et le sensible: 
ni purement , ni purement ai\ston, elle relve exactement des 
dianohta (et lon sait que la mathmatique est justement dfinie par la 
tradition grecque comme appartenant aux dianohta, car elle touch dun 
ct au monde intelligible, mais la matrialit invitable de ses tres la relie 
malgr tout au sensible); elle manifeste dans le monde humain la perfection 
du monde intelligible et divin; et, en termes aristotliciens, elle mdiatise le 
travail de la formed (ei&dov) sur la matire (u$lh). Aussi la forma, dans 
sa ralisation la plus dpouille, ne sera-t-elle pas alourdie dlments 
soumis au changement comme le sont les noms des propritaires de 
parcelles: on en a un tmoignage dans ce fragment de bronze rcemment 
dcouvert en Espagne, qui comporte comme seule indication, dans les aires 
orthonormes quil dfinit, lindication de la valeur gale de leur surface.446 
Guillaumins interpretation of the role of mathematics in the formation of the 
forma tends to suggest that the document served two functions: it recorded features in 
the landscape, which could be used to resolve disputes, but it also structured the way 
people interacted with the landscape by defining how it should be. Some aspects of this 
come out in the illustrations that accompany the original manuscripts of the Corpus 
Agrimensorum. As two recent studies have remarked, these illustrations use 
mathematics, particularly right angles to form boundaries and structure the landscape, 
but they also use artistic elements, which clearly express engagement with the landscape 
and the abstract at the same time (Figs. 2.17 and 2.18).447 The so-called maps tend to 
render walls and towers in shades of tan and grey, mountains used to bound the

landscape tend to be conical green or brown features, while the trees, symbolising 
forests, tend to be brown vignette and water, in the form of swamps, bays and streams, 
appear as thick black or dark blue lines or closed basins with ripples containing 
depictions of fish and ducks. 
These elements, along with the formal geometric features that indicate the man-
made limites of the surveyors, suggest a world where those who consulted the archives 
to view these documents, expected to see not just what was in the landscape, but what 
people should find there both in terms of natural resources and human structures. Such 
an ideal projection of the landscape would require that the depiction of a colonial 
pertica fits as seemingly as possible into a universal paradigm while depicting what had 
been constructed in the landscape, necessitating the shift in orientation, found in the 
Arausio tablets and other documents. 
Therefore, in theory and depiction, every colony was oriented to true north even 
when it was not. Using such maps in the field, as Junius Nipsus clearly states, one 
should be able to orient the direction of the kardo and decumanus maximus and 
establish the identity of boundary markers. It would not have been easy. Perhaps one of 
the hallmarks of the surveyor and his craft was not only an ability to be seen making 
them, but to read the maps other surveyors had made in order to manipulate and 
regulate human perceptions of the world.448 The creation and manipulation of 
documents, which blended mathematics and law, were at any rate at the heart of the 
Roman world. Surveying can be considered the main tool used by the administration to 
collect taxes and regulate the business of an Empire comprising many cultures.

Chapter Three: Whose Land Is It Anyway: Agrimensores, 
Boundaries and the Peoples of the Empire 
The farmer was a humble man yet, stripped bare by his wealthy 
neighbours greed, he wished at least to be buried where his family had 
always farmed, and so with some trepidation hed invited a group of friends 
to gather formally to mark the boundaries.449 
At the distance of 120 feet: Quintus Julius Rufus, son of Publius, from the 
Galerian Tribe, surveyor to the Siccaenae (is buried here).450 
3.1 Introduction 
Quintus Julius Rufus was a Roman citizen and an independent surveyor, who was 
probably born in Italy and died in the province of Baetica sometime before the 
accession of Claudius. The reasons for Rufus presence in Spain are unknown, though 
like most surveyors, he was doubtless concerned with the organisation of land in the 
provinces and with the resolution of property disputes, like the one described above. His 
independent status, the total absence of a dedication and the reference to the Siccaenae 
suggests that he was employed in a professional capacity by that civitas. Why Rufus 
should have been employed as an independent surveyor by this provincial community 
remains as much a mystery as the identity of those who buried him. 
The tombstone (Fig. 3.1), which is unique in the Iberian Peninsula, however, 
shows a remarkable familiarity with both Roman burial practices and the conventions of 
Roman surveying. Rufus was identified by his full Roman tria nomina and voting tribe, 
and, in addition, those who constructed the tomb specified that there was to be a 
distance of one hundred and twenty feet, a standard unit of measurement used by 
Roman surveyors, between the burial plot and the road.451

This chapter will explore how surveyors like Rufus were introduced to the 
provincial populations of the Empire and the impact that they had on the development 
of Roman culture and civilisation in the provinces. To accomplish this, the chapter will 
first explore the nature of Roman boundaries and land ownership to establish exactly 
what it was that the Roman administration expected the surveyors to achieve in 
establishing boundaries. It will then investigate points of contact between the Roman 
administration and provincial populations, in which the actions of the agrimensores 
would provide a positive incentive for the subject populations to adopt Roman 
surveying and surveyors for themselves. Much of the focus in this part of the chapter 
will be on the structure and organisation of communities in the provinces and the 
regulation of inter-state boundary lines. Finally, the chapter will look at how the 
provincial population both resisted the activities of Roman surveyors and in turn used 
surveyors to resist the Roman administration. 
3.2 Roman Surveying: Centuriation and Beyond 
Here it is necessary to reiterate a point that was set out in the previous chapter. Roman 
surveying and survey theory were more than just a matter of centuriation. As has 
already been remarked, centuriation features very prominently in modern scholars after 
perceptions of the Roman world, but it is unclear from the physical remains on the 
ground just how common this rationalisation and reorganisation of the landscape really 
was in antiquity.452 Recent reassessments of centuriation patterns have shown that while 
centuriation may shape the landscape around a Roman colony to a considerable 
distance, it was only one component of a more complex strategy in the use of the natural 
environment.453 These strategies tended to involve the introduction of roads, the 
creation of boundary demarcations using natural and man-made features, and the 
adaption or alteration of watercourses. By contrast, centuriation as Michel Tarpin and 
Daniel Gargola have both observed, was merely a Roman cultural form of land 
management intended to facilitate veteran settlement, legionary recruitment and 
taxation.454

While centuriation could be used to organise agriculture and tax-collection in 
land that was controlled by non-Roman civitates within the Roman Empire, there is 
very little evidence to show that the lands of non-Roman civitates outside Africa were 
commonly centuriated.455 Rather, scholars have found a range of different forms of 
land-ownership and habitation in the territory controlled by Rome, which cannot be 
reduced to a single organisational principle, size or structural typology.456 As a 
consequence, the Romans engaged with a range of discrepant local concepts of spatial 
organisation with the application of the taxonomic categories, considered in the 
previous chapter. This taxonomic structure was then bound together through a web of 
interpersonal relationships to form a highly stratified landscape.457 
An abundance of evidence shows that the Roman administration regulated the 
boundaries between non-Roman civitates within the Empire.458 But, as the previous 
chapters have shown, such regulation was not carried out by the surveyors in a vacuum. 
Local elites were very much involved and those elites themselves may have sought to 
regulate the boundaries of other civitates in terms of the Roman legal system as a part of 
regional power dynamics.459 In light of this, it is perhaps significant that there is no 
evidence to show that the Siccaenae either had their lands centuriated or sought a 
Roman surveyor to carry out such an operation. This suggests that the reason for 
Quintus Julius Rufus presence in Spain was more involved with inter-state political 
activities conducted by the Siccaenae, their assertion of control over territory and the 
surveyors expertise in the creation and regulation of both internal and external 
boundaries under Roman law. 
3.3 Structure and Shape in the Roman Landscape 
As discussed in the previous chapter, surveyors were expected to fully understand the 
nuances of the juridical taxonomy of settlements and land-division described by 
Frontinus and Agennius Urbicus. This taxonomy established obligations and awarded

benefactions to a civic body  recognised by the Roman central administration using a 
sliding scale that ranged vici and pagi  rendered subordinate to another community to 
the most powerful of Roman colonies. In all cases, the surveyors employed the three-
fold system of intervention to regulate their civic territory. Land was either divided and 
allocated through the creation of limites, allocated but not divided, or left unregulated as 
ager arcifinius.460 
The first two categories, which were applied to most formal communities, were 
distinguished from the third through the delineation of a circular perimeter, enclosing an 
urban core and its dependent fundi, which were regulated by the communities own 
internal taxonomy.461 Ager arcifinius, also called occupatorius, was taken over by a 
possessor, usually in war, and structured using paths and boundaries, which a surveyor 
could describe geometrically, even though they followed natural features in the 
landscape, rather than being formed from geometrically constructed units. The sliding 
scale of civic status allowed the administration to reward and punish communities 
which came under its sway. Thus, the graded system for organising the landscape 
allowed the Roman administration to engage with a discrepant range of indigenous 
systems of land-tenure. 
As Christopher Tilley has recently argued, most subsistence agriculturalists 
inhabit and move through a landscape which was focused on a fixed community with its 
adjacent fields and paths, whose character was structured by monuments and the 
agricultural cycle.462 This made the adaptation of allocated, or allocated and divided 
land, comparatively straightforward, since the Romans developed both principles in the 
context of their own agricultural activities, as Daniel Gargola and Okko Behrends have 
argued.463 At the same time, while Gerard Chouquer has argued that the Romans viewed 
pastoralists and nomadic societies as bandits, who were disruptive to the development 
of the urban structure of the Empire, evidence from boundary disputes involving 
livestock considered below suggests that in practical terms the main concern of the 
Roman administration may have been the unfettered movement and/or the grazing of

livestock.464 As Tilley has remarked, pastoralists tend to move their animals along 
traditional pathways between fixed seasonal habitation sites with varying degrees of 
structured demarcation.465 But, those traditional pathways may not have always fostered 
peaceful relations with agriculturalists, particularly when those agriculturalists were 
newcomers to a region, as many Roman colonists were. 
As the discussion of passages from both the Corpus Agrimensorum and the 
Digest of Justinian in the previous chapter shows, the Roman administration was deeply 
concerned with the regulation of roads and rights of way.466 Jurists and surveyors alike 
engaged in a lively discourse over the taxonomy and physical width of paths and roads, 
since the lines of demarcation separating both private property and communities also 
functioned as thoroughfares, merging the legal classification of boundaries with that of 
rights of way.467 As Siculus Flaccus explains, each right of way, like the land it bounded 
or crossed, had its own administrative category, establishing who had the privilege of 
using it, what mode of transport they could use, its availability to cattle-drovers and the 
identity of those responsible for its upkeep.468 
The Roman landscape, however, consisted of more than just the quantified 
boundaries surrounding human settlements and the roads that connected or separated 
them. Jean-Marie Kowalski has argued that rivers were permeable or soft boundaries, 
defining and compartmentalising the use of the environment in informal ways, even as 
people used them to travel, exchange resources and ideas, and conceptualise the 
world.469 Tonnes Bekker-Nielsen has further argued that the Romans, who considered 
rivers and the sea to be subject to the ius gentium and therefore regulated exclusively by 
the emperor, nonetheless incorporated these permeable spaces into their legal taxonomy 
of formal boundaries.470 Such an approach to the landscape, pragmatically took

advantage of the human tendency to both stop at and travel along or across natural 
features, even as it imposed artificial quantitatively described lines of demarcation. 
The interlocking relationship between formal and informal boundaries, 
comprising lines of demarcation formed from or crossed by a segmented assemblage of 
transport routes, organised the Roman Empire into a fragmented mosaic of interlocking 
personal and regional concepts of space, land-ownership and territorial identity.471 At 
the core of these interlocking concepts, as Gerard Chouquer has argued, was the 
occupation of specific places within the environment by individuals, transforming the 
ground into a resource for exploitation; their discourse with both the local community 
and the wider world over what constituted proper or improper use and ownership.472 
Under the Principate, this discourse was guided by local customs operating under the 
umbrella of the Empires taxonomic administrative hierarchy, which placed a restriction 
on the use of violence and introduced an external source of arbitration.473 This umbrella 
structure placed fundi as both small-holdings and villa estates as the fundamental 
building blocks for a stratified hierarchy, connected by a graded network of paths and 
roads feeding into vici, pagi, castra and a variety of urbes. 
These nucleated settlements, identified along a sliding scale of size, were the 
differentiated nodal points in an overlapping stratigraphy of power and authority. As 
several of the case studies below show, the various grades of urbes, namely colonies, 
municipalities and civitates, had a varying degree of social and political power within 
the province and could own or control extra-territorial tracts of land in one anothers 
territory. Likewise, individuals who travelled along the various segmented inter-state 
routes could acquire property in multiple communities, stimulating disputes over 
ownership and civic authority. Resolution of these disputes could be done under a 
variety of local or imperial legal systems, since a surveyors authorisation to act always 
came from their employer. Besides, depending on who initiated the project, surveyors 
could find themselves negotiating the overlapping and competing authority of 
magistrates from civitates, praefecturae, pagi, municipalities, colonies and even the 
imperial administration itself.

But, whatever else employing a surveyor such as Quintus Julius Rufus might 
bring, the civitas of the Siccaenae and communities like it had to be willing to at least 
tacitly recognise Roman law and accept the Hellenistic principles of proof and the 
performative procedures of the surveyors craft. Without that no surveyor could regulate 
land and the human relationships which governed its use. However, their choice to do 
this may not have been entirely acquiescent, nor may it have been imposed from 
outside. The leadership of the civitas may have adopted the services of Rufus in 
response to the activities of both Roman and non-Roman citizens, living in their 
territory, as a means of regulating their own boundaries with neighbouring populations 
or even to regulate the boundaries of other civitates under the auspices of the Roman 
administration. To appreciate this, the rest of this chapter will look at the activities and 
impact of surveyors at first the local and then the regional levels. 
3.4 Private Ownership and the Fundus in the Civitas of the Cantiaci 
While numerous passages in the Corpus Agrimensorum demonstrate the overwhelming 
importance that assessing private land played in the administration of the Roman 
Empire, most of the discussion of land, attached to a fundus or other forms of private 
property, involves formulaic proscriptions, depicting the sort of thing that a surveyor 
might encounter or the course of action a surveyor should or must undertake.474 Such 
descriptions, though helpful for understanding the theoretical nature of surveying  as 
outlined in the previous chapter  and its relationship to Roman law, do not inform on 
the impact of surveyors on the lived experiences of land-holders in the Empire or the 
reasons as to why a non-Roman civitas might choose to employ a Roman surveyor. 
Fortunately, five documents from across the Empire survive to provide a 
window on the impact of surveyors on property-owners in the seventy-year period from 
the death of Nero to the accession of Antonius Pius. Two of the documents, one from 
Londinium in Britain and the other from Herculaneum in Italy, are wooden writing 
tablets recording part of the proceedings for boundary or property disputes. The other 
three documents, from Niki in Dalmatia, Daulis in Greece and Histonium in Italy, are

all inscriptions that record the restoration of boundaries or the final verdicts in property 
disputes. Four of these documents are considered here, while the inscription from 
Niki will be discussed in another section along with several documents from Africa. 
Of all these documents, the one which is perhaps most representative of the 
majority of the populations experience is the enigmatic tablet from Londinium (Fig. 
3.2). This document records an investigation into the sale of what Roger Tomlin has 
suggested was a small sacred grove in the territory of the Cantiaci, probably by the 
senior magistrates of the civitas:475 
In the consulship of the Emperor Trajan Hadrian Caesar Augustus for the 
second time, and Gnaeus Fuscus, on the day before the Ides of March. 
When he (the magistrate) had arrived at the property in question: fifteen 
arpennia of land, more or less, in the Verlucionian wood, which is in the 
pagus of Dibussu in the civitas of the Cantiaci, and bounded by the estate 
of  and the estate of Caesennius Vitalis and the village road, Lucius Julius 
Bellicus declared he had bought it from Titus Valerius Silvinus for forty 
denarii, as is contained in the deed of purchase. Lucius Julius Bellicus also 
testified that he476 
Civic magistrates, such as the one mentioned in this document who adjudicated 
claims of ownership in property disputes, tended to use procedures and laws derived 
from within their own jurisdiction, but those laws and procedures were frequently 
adapted to fit Roman norms since the organisation of property-ownership in a civitas 
depended upon the surveyors activities. When surveyors established the outer 
perimeter of a civitas, it was customary for individual land-holders to accredit their title 
to a holding by estimating the amount of land contained within boundaries established 
through the naming and identification of adjacent holdings or public rights of way.477 In 
addition, as Siculus Flaccus, Frontinus and Agennius Urbicus explain, property-holders 
did not require the presence of a surveyor to establish a property demarcation in all 
cases, since surveyors did not normally investigate a legal claim on land such as this, 
but property-holders could not establish one unilaterally and were expected to have the

Roman authorities recognise it.478 Rather, all claims on land, and the boundaries which 
defined it, had to be made, not just in the presence of the magistrates, but in the 
presence of the neighbouring land-holders as well. This practice was binding for Roman 
and non-Roman citizens alike, as the documents from Herculaneum, Histonium and 
Daulis considered below show. 
But, declaring the limits of ones property in the presence of the community was 
not simply a matter of good manners to be observed in the interest of maintaining 
peaceful relations with other landholders. It was also a matter of gaining the acceptance 
of a foreign power. Theoretically at least, all land outside of Italy was either owned by 
the Roman people or under the control of the emperor by virtue of his imperium, 
making it impossible for private people without Roman citizenship to own property. In 
practice, however, much land seems to have been regulated through the ius peregrinus 
and ius gentium, opening it to occupation and private ownership under the auspices of 
the emperor, unless it was allocated to a community through a formal allocation 
undertaken by Roman surveyors.479 The surveyors intervention in the civitates of the 
empire, at the request of both the Roman authorities and the community itself, meant 
that non-Roman citizens residing in a non-Roman civitas could still find themselves 
subject to Roman law and Roman courts, if someone had the resources and desire to 
access them.480 This was particularly true when Roman citizens, such as those 
mentioned in the document quoted above, acquired land within the territory of a civitas. 
As Nicholas Purcell has eloquently argued, individual Roman citizens living in the 
provinces, though being a small minority, could still exert a remarkable amount of 
influence on the non-Roman communities where they resided.481 This provided a 
powerful incentive for the leadership of civitates to do things the Roman way in order to 
secure the property rights of their own citizens and avoid problems with the dominant 
power. 
Something of this socio-political influence can be seen in the text of the wooden 
writing tablet quoted above. The use of the Celtic name Verlucionius to define the grove

and its quantification using the Gallic measurement of the arepennis indicates that the 
property was defined by someone of Celtic heritage. Since groves were considered 
sacred under both Celtic and Roman religion, it may have been a significant cultural 
location for the community prior to Roman intervention, or it may have been a cultural 
construct formed through interaction between indigenous members of the civitas, 
foreign immigrants from the continent and Roman administrators.482 In either case, its 
structural identity  as recorded in this document  was unquestionably a hybrid product 
of Iron Age and Roman concepts, since the Gallic arepennis, which may not have been 
used by the people of Britain prior to the Roman occupation, was syncretised to the 
Roman actus by the reign of Hadrian, as was the Greek plethora employed in the case 
from Daulis discussed below.483 
While the name of the site is indisputably British in origin, a more important point 
for understanding its character is that the individuals who first delimited the grove as 
part of a pagus simply estimated the amount of land attached to each property by 
quantifying it in round units of five. This was the common practice attested as the 
normal method of organisation used by surveyors for land that was let out for lease 
throughout the Empire.484 The employment of an inexact method of quantification for 
this property suggests that the original owners of the land were keen to have the Roman 
administration recognise the groves existence, but were not so concerned with exact 
units that they invested in a full formal definition in which each internal property-line 
was measured. This may in turn reflect their desire to rent the land out, but the presence 
of fundi with Latin titles would tend to indicate that it reflects an attempt by the civitas 
to accommodate the presence of Romans, who acquired property within the community 
and the application of the Roman census process. 
At the same time, Oswold Dilke and Roger Tomlin may be right when they see 
this structural definition of space in terms of a pagus as reflecting the forcible 
centuriation of provincial land associated with the settlement of Roman veterans in

individual allotments or through the regulation of Arcifinial land.485 All the land-holders 
mentioned in the documents were unquestionably Roman and they may have seized or 
been allocated land in the territory of the Cantiaci during the early days of conquest. If 
one accepts this explanation, however, two points should be kept in mind. First, as the 
discussion of the inscription from Daulis below shows, not all acts of centuriation were 
carried out as part of Roman colonisation. Surveyors frequently deployed various 
procedures used in centuriation to resolve problems between the indigenous inhabitants 
of a community and outsiders who acquired land within their territory. Indeed, this was 
perhaps the most common reason for surveyors to intervene in property or boundary 
disputes within the territory of a single community. Secondly, evidence for the 
structural identity of Roman pagi, discussed by Michel Tarpin, Murielle Faudet and 
others, suggests that these outlying rural districts were present at many un-centuriated 
settlements and that even when they were attached to divided and allocated land, pagi 
were not commonly centuriated.486 This is a matter that is discussed further below 
where the impact of Roman colonial pagi and praefectura on indigenous civitates is 
considered. 
3.5 The Measurement of Monumental Memory and Self-Identity 
Regardless of whether the land was formally centuriated or left as irregular plots, whose 
size was simply estimated in surveying terms for tax purposes, the community was 
allocated land with an administrative structure. It was quite different from the open 
organisation of property in Iron Age Europe, since it contained urban, extra-urban and 
rural land.487 In negotiating this socio-political transformation, the Cantiaci, like so 
many nations which came under Roman rule, had to simultaneously engage with the 
expectations of the Roman administration while creating a space which reflected who, 
and what, they were as a community.488 Some of this transformation may have been 
negotiated at the highest levels of the Cantiaci leadership,489 in a manner analogous to 
that which scholars have postulated Augustus carried out after Actium, manipulating old 
cultural ideas and merging them with newly structured spaces.

The scope was to create fresh communal memories that seem timeless in order 
to establish a sustainable sense of community to meet the vicissitudes of change.490 
However, as many scholars have been at pains to argue, the true success of any such 
transformation depended upon individuals within the community, who structured 
memory and space along very different lines from those of the Classical tradition, 
bringing together memories and concepts of space from several cultures to create a new 
identity for themselves.491 Several texts from the Roman Empire provide hints as to how 
the surveyors may have interacted with private land-holders within civitates such as the 
Cantiaci to bring this about. 
3.6 Living with your Neighbours: Surveyors and Arbitrators at 
Histonium 
While the activities of the Roman administration in the regulation of property-
ownership and interstate boundary disputes in the provinces have received considerable 
attention, the actions of individual land-holders and their impact on the development of 
communities within the Empire have received far less attention from modern scholars. 
This is in part due to the fact that only a handful of documents recording this sort of 
information have survived from antiquity, and those which have, like the document 
from London, tend to be very fragmentary. The two best examples come from a wooden 
tablet from Herculaneum, dated to around 70 AD (Fig. 3.3), and a stone tablet from 
Histonium dating to around 74 AD. They are both relevant to the intervention of private 
arbitrators in disputes involving the fundi of private land-holders, who, like Julius 
Bassus, acquired property in communities where they were not necessarily originally 
citizens.492 The document from Histonium, which is far more significant for this 
discussion, reads: 
Gaius Helvidius Priscus, arbitrator by common agreement between Quintus 
Tillius Eryllus, procurator of Tillius Sassius, and Marcus Paquius Aulanius, 
advocate of the municipality of the Histonienses: when both parties were 
present and he himself had taken the oath, he proclaimed his verdict in those 
words which are written out below.

When an old book which Tillius Sassius wished to have considered as 
evidence was produced by the advocates of the Histonienses, and in it was 
written a verdict concerning the boundary of the places which were being 
disputed produced by Quintus Coelius Gallus, when Marcus Iunius Silanus 
and Lucius Norbanus Balbus were consuls, 8 days before the Kalends of 
May (24th April, 19 AD), between Publius Vaccius Vitulus, prior owner of 
the Herianican farm of the Histonienses and Titia Flacilla, an even earlier 
owner of the Vellanan farm of Tillius Sassus. Because the subject of the 
disagreement in the present matter involved a boundary dispute, once the 
landowners of both estates were present, Gallus established the boundary, in 
such a way that he planted the first wooden boundary post approximately 
eleven feet from the oak tree. Then there was a wooden boundary post 
which was not far from a ditch, though the interval which was written down 
is not clear because, on account of its age, the book has a gap in the spot 
where the number of feet appears to have been written. Then between the 
ditch and the wooden boundary post was a public right of way which was 
the sole responsibility of Vaccus Vitulus. From the wooden boundary post 
and its environs (the boundary went in a straight line) to an inscribed ash 
tree where a wooden boundary post was planted by Gallus, and then from 
this wooden boundary post and its environs (the boundary went in a straight 
line) to the bank of the furthest-most pond of Serranus. On the far left hand 
side (of the property) the boundary was aligned back to the starting point by 
Gallus493 
The two properties, which formed the core of the dispute arbitrated by Gallus, 
may have been established when a group of Caesars veterans were settled at the 
municipium of Histonium sometime in the mid-40s BC.494 When Publius Vaccius 
Vitulus and Titia Flacilla took possession of the two fundi early in the reign of Tiberius, 
the boundary line between the properties was probably marked by ditches and trees, as 
was common in land that was allocated, but not divided, and they quarrelled over the 
extent of their respective estates. To resolve the dispute, Gallus investigated the 
evidence for the original boundary-line, assembled both parties on the land, and citing 
Herianicus and Vallanus as the names of the original owners, planted wooden boundary 
markers in their presence to re-establish the formal demarcation. 
While there were no physical barriers or fences separating Vitulus and Flacilla, 
Gallus did not rely entirely on their mutual respect for his authority alone to maintain 
peace and the integrity of the two properties. Rather, in keeping with the archival 
practices discussed in the previous chapter, Gallus created a contractual bond between 
493 App. 4.12.

Vitulus and Flacilla by filing records with the municipal government.495 The actions of 
all three parties in this dispute illustrate how the system of self-help and informal 
justice, which Denis Kehoe and Caroline Humfress have both argued typified dispute 
resolution throughout the ancient world, could blend individual notions of property 
ownership. The universal conventions of the surveyors, municipal law and the Roman 
formulary procedure, observed in the previous two chapters, could be used to solve a 
problem without violence.496 
The full importance of this blending and its impact on local judiciaries has been 
discussed by Julian Dubouloz. Most civitates, municipalities and colonies developed 
legal institutions. The scope was to address such grievances which can be seen in the 
later dispute arbitrated by Gaius Helvidius Priscus.497 In that case, whose resolution is 
lost, it would seem that an absentee landlord, Tillius Sassius, entered into a dispute with 
the municipal government of Histonium, over what may have been the loss or damage 
to one or more of the marker-posts. This caused confusion about the boundary between 
the two properties.498 To prove his claim, Sassius forced the municipal administration to 
produce the record of Gallus decretum as evidence of the actual situation on the 
ground. It was regrettable that the book was damaged, since that meant a further survey 
was in all probability undertaken to establish the distance between markers lost in the 
archival record. Damage of the archival records of this sort may have also played a part 
in the dispute between the Patulcenses and Galillenses of Sardinia which is considered 
below, but there is no proof of it. The main point to be recognised here is that informal 
processes of dispute resolution, based on the surveyors craft, could resolve problems 
outside of any formal legal system, so long as the participants were willing to accept the 
decision of a private arbitrator, who drew on that knowledge base, and that the 
resulting decreta could influence future activities on the land.

3.7 A Meeting of Minds: Eubulus and the People of Daulis 
The two documents just discussed illustrate two points. First, the individual actions 
could influence the development of a community and communitys governing body 
could in turn both regulate and become involved in the structure and regulation of 
private land. Second, they show that Roman surveying conventions and administrative 
forms could be adapted to a non-Roman community, where there was a mixture of 
Roman and non-Roman citizens through the choices made by individual land-holders. 
But an inscribed stele, found in front of a church in the modern village of 
Dhavla in Greece, provides the clearest illustration of how surveyors adapted Roman 
administrative principles and the conventions of their craft to local conditions at the 
request of people, who were not Roman citizens. The text preserves two documents 
related to the construction of a temple to a local hero, known as the Archegetes, in a 
rural district or pagus of Daulis, called Tronis.499 The first document is the record of a 
decretum issued by the land surveyor Titus Flavius Eubulus in his capacity as judge in a 
dispute between two magistrates from Daulis, Zopyros son of Aristion and Parmenon, 
son of Zopyros, and one Memmius Antiochus son of Antiochus over four tracts of land 
sold by the heirs of a man named Cleon. The second document, which postdates the 
first, is a decree of Daulis ordering that a road to the new temple complex be surveyed, 
and promising Serapis, son of Zopyros, the representative of Memmius Antiochus, 
financial compensation should the road deprive Antiochus of any land awarded by 
Eubulus in the prior dispute. The two documents read: 
(Side A:) I, T. Flavius Eubulus, judge and land surveyor appointed by 
Cassius Maximus the proconsul, retained by Valerius Severus, proconsul, 
(in the affair) between Zopyros son of Aristion and Parmenon, son of 
Zopyros, and Memmius, son of Antiochos, concerning the disputed places. 
Having heard from both parties for as long as they wished and having 
conducted an examination (of the land), and having been ordered to deliver 
a verdict by Clodius Granianus, the most excellent proconsul, I judge that 
concerning the field Dryppios, which Memmius Antiochos bought for 
himself from the heirs of Kleon, as I understand from the documents 
presented to me, 435 Phocic plethora belong to Antiochos. Whatever should 
be found to be more than this, I judge to belong to the city of the people of 
Daulis. Similarly, concerning the field Euxyleia, I judge that 430 plethra are 
499 App. 4.28, side B, lines 51-58; Paus. 10.4.10. 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             141 
 
Antiochos, the remainder are the citys. Concerning the fields Platanos and 
Moschotomeai, I judge that 230 plethra are Antiochos, the rest are the 
citys. I judge that the origin point of the field survey should be established 
wherever Antiochos wishes in each of the fields Dryppios and Euxyleia, but 
in Platanos and Moschotomeai there will be one survey origin for both 
fields, with the survey proceeding continuously from the appointed origin, 
excluding from the surveyed area streams, rough areas, or areas that cannot 
be cultivated which are over ten sphyrai. Present: T. Flavius Eubulus 
delivered the verdict and affixed his seal, L. Mestrius Soclarus, Kleomenes, 
son of Kleomenes, Neikon, son of Symphoros, Lamprias, son of Neikon, 
Zopyros, son of Antipatros, Sosibios, son of Drakon, Neikon, son of 
Alexandros, Leon, son of Theodotos, Kallon, son of Phylax, Cassius, son of 
Martianus. 
(Side B:) By a decree of the city. The road to the (shrine of the) founder 
shall be two kalamoi wide. They shall jointly engrave the landmarks and 
boundaries of the survey by the twentieth day of the twelfth month, with us 
reviewing them when they are engraved. 
Concerning the field called Dryppios, in accordance with the document 
presented by Serapis, son of Sopyros the legal representative (of Antiochos) 
and by the archons for (Daulis?) Philon, son of Sosikrates and Damon, son 
of Zopyros, we judge that if there should be anything lacking from the 
measurements of four hundred and thirty-five plethora in the verdict of 
Eubulus, that Serapis will have a claim for it from the citizens of the city of 
Daulis. Present: I, Kourrios Autoboulos, have judged and affixed the first 
seal. I Neikeiphoros, son of Lykomedes, have judged. I, Agasias, son of 
Teimon, have judged. I, P. Aelius Damoxenus have affixed the fourth seal. 
I, Eisidoros am fifth. Metrodoros, son of Apollodotos of Antikyra. 
Neikaretos, son of Pistos of Tithorea. I Tyrannos, son of Tyrannos have 
affixed (this) seal. I Akindynos, son of Kallikrates of Tithorea. Sextus 
Cornelius Axiochus. Eunous, son of Epaphras. I, Kalligenes, son of 
Keoneikus of Tithorea have affixed (this) seal.500 
This dispute, like that involving the grove in the civitas of the Cantiaci, though 
embedded in a different cultural context, nonetheless involved a similar argument over 
the rightful ownership of land. However, here the question was complicated by 
competing claims against the four fields in Tronis, whose names were probably derived 
from Greek mythological figures, and whose ownership probably involved complicated 
narratives extending back into the distant past.501 Since the city planned to construct a 
new temple complex to their legendary heroic founder, and perhaps to lease some of the 
property as a source of municipal revenue, such complex mythological connections may 
have formed part of the communitys claim to the property.502 However, the land may

also have been entailed to the community, if Cleon had taken on the task of completing 
the temple as a liturgy prior to his death.503 Debts of this sort are likely since Memmius 
Antiochos, a landlord from outside the community, bought the property from the heirs 
of Cleon before the city could accredit its claims to the property. 
To resolve the disagreement that issued, either Antiochos or the magistrates of 
Daulis appealed to Cassius Maximus, the Roman provincial governor, who contracted 
with the surveyor Titus Flavius Eubulus to decide who the rightful owner of the 
property might be. The problem was protracted and lasted beyond Maximus time in 
office, so that Eubulus was retained in his post by two subsequent governors before he 
was at last ordered to produce a verdict. Eubulus, like Julius Victor, the surveyor who 
resolved matters at Hypata, examined all the legal documents available, took a formal 
tour of examination of each property and concluded that both parties had a valid claim 
on the land. But, unlike Victor, Eubulus did not split the properties into two more or less 
equal halves.504 
Rather, in keeping with the Roman surveyors notion of equanimity, by which 
each person should get only what was their rightful due, he seems to have granted a 
portion of each field to each of the two claimants, based on the value of land in the area 
and the amount that Antiochos had paid for the property.505 He then asked Antiochos to 
choose a starting point for the survey in each of the first two properties named, the 
fields Drypios and Euxyleia, but in the second two pieces of property he allowed only 
one starting point for both. This meant that in the fields of Platanos and Moschotomeai, 
Eubulus retained the titles, but treated the two individual properties as one estate, 
something that tended to cause endless confusion for surveyors and administrators, 
when private land-holders did it on their own initiative.506 
The retention of traditional Greek names in documents that otherwise record the 
reorganisation of land using local measurements illustrates what might be termed a 
discrete moment of mutata forma agrorum, or a transformation of the landscape, which

was supposed to convey a sense of continuity with the distant past. This transformation, 
in both the landscape and the communal memories associated with it emphasised in the 
text through a total absence of any reference to the original structure of the landscape, 
or the total size of the estate prior to Eubulus intervention, was initiated by the 
leadership of Daulis and carried out through the actions of Eubulus and several other 
surveyors. The motivation for this transformation is provided by Pausanias account of 
how all the peoples of Phocis made daily sacrifices with offerings of wine and ritual 
feasting at the temple.507 While perhaps an exaggeration, the significance Pausanias 
ascribes to the temple shows that it was intended not only to renew the civic identity of 
the people of Daulis, but also to reorient their relationship with the other cities of the 
region and to renew the Phocians sense of cultural identity under the domination of 
Rome. 
For his part, Eubulus maintained the illusion of continuity by carefully using the 
archaic place names and a local system of land division, the Phocic plethora, rather than 
the Roman actus. However, beyond the use of this Greek measurement, his 
methodology for carrying out the survey itself was entirely Roman. This is clearest in 
the stipulations Eubulus set out for the allocation of land in the fields Platanos and 
Moschotomeai, where rough terrain, streams and land, which could not be cultivated in 
an area greater than ten sphyrai, would be excluded from the survey, placing it into the 
juridical category of ager relictus, discussed in the last chapter.508 
The prominent place that the leadership of Daulis gave to the judgment of 
Eubulus and by implication to the Roman administration can be seen in the actions of 
the ruling they handed down sometime later. A panel of Roman citizens and Phocians 
from Daulis and two other communities provided financial compensation to Antiochos 
should the road they have ordered surveyed through the field of Drypios strip his estates 
of land granted by Eubulus.509 More importantly, they ordered that the survey for the 
road be undertaken using a similar methodology with the final result inscribed, publicly 
displayed, inspected and authenticated by the town council in the manner of a

surveyors forma and aes.510 This would suggest that Eubulus treatment of these fields 
as colonial land, which was subject to allocation and division under the terms of Roman 
civil law, prompted the people of Daulis to adopt the conventions of the Roman 
surveyors. If this interpretation is correct, then it shows just how a local dispute could 
transform the landscape of a non-Roman community in decidedly Roman terms under 
the very direction of its native inhabitants. 
3.8 Iberian Law and Roman Procedure: The Resolution of Property 
Disputes in Early Roman Spain 
A document, known as the Tabula Contrebiensis from Zaragoza-Aragon, 
demonstrates that the people of Daulis were not unique in adapting Roman legal and 
surveying procedures to the needs of indigenous communities. According to the re-
edited text of this inscription, published by John Richardson in conjunction with Peter 
Birks and Alan Roger in 1984, a civitas, called the Salluienses, bought a tract of land 
owned by another civitas, called the Sosinestani, to build a canal that would bring 
much-needed water to their own territory in Hispania Tarraconensis around 87 BC.511 
A third tribal civitas, the Allavonenses, objected to the sale of the land as well as the 
Roman-style-survey of the watercourse, and took action to obstruct the construction 
project. The Salluienses apparently complained about this obstruction to the Roman 
proconsul C. Valerius Flaccus and filed formal charges against the Allavonenses for 
obstruction. Flaccus turned the matter over to the civic council at Contrebiea for 
adjudication, instructing the decuriones there to employ formulary procedures similar to 
those found at the praetors tribunal in Rome, while rendering a judgment in accordance 
with local law.512 
To judge from the questions that the people of Contrebiea considered, the 
Allavonenses objections to the canal rested on two points. First, they contended that the 
Sosinestani did not have any right to sell their land to the Salluienses without consulting 
the Allavonenses because private citizens from that civitas owned and occupied some of

the land of the Sosinestani through which the canal was laid out by the surveyors.513 
Second, they argued that even if it was the Sosinestani who wished to build and operate 
the canal, they could not do so in the area that had been marked out for the purpose 
since private citizens of the Allavonenses owned some of the land and the Sosinestani 
did not have the right to use it.514 
Following the directive of Flaccus, the council of Contrebiea ruled that the 
Sosinestani were well within their rights to sell land that they owned to the Salluienses. 
They also determined that the Salluienses, acting as if they were the Sosinestani within 
the land they had bought, could also build their canal across the private land, owned by 
members of the Allavonenses, so long as they paid each private land-holder a sum of 
money fixed by an independent board of five. 
Like the situation at Daulis, the problem in this case came from what might be 
considered an interstate property transaction, in which people from outside a 
community acquired land within it. The principal difference was that at Daulis a single 
individual entered into conflict with the community in which the property under 
consideration was located, while the Tabula Contrebiensis presents a complicated 
situation in which two communities entered into conflict over property owned in a third. 
Extra territorial enclaves, called praefecturae by the Roman surveyors, were common 
throughout the Roman world and were a frequent source of contention. They came into 
being under one of three conditions. First, when an individual or civic body acquired 
land within the territorial jurisdiction of another community or large estate either 
through lawful sale, usucapio, or by right of occupation in war.515 This was the basis for 
the Allavonenses interference with the Salluienses in the territory of the Sinistani. 
Second, praefecturae could be created when extra land within the territory of a Roman 
colony was either left in the control of its original inhabitants or returned to the control 
of another community. Third, a Roman colony could be granted control over land 
within the territory of a distant community.

The second and third situations will receive some attention in a moment because 
they play an important part in understanding the regulation of boundaries and the 
activities of the surveyors in the colonies of Emerita, Orange and Arles. What is 
important to recognise here is that the Sinistani faced the complexities involved in 
constructing aqueducts and canals for the extraterritorial transfer of water. This 
technical undertaking required either the ownership of land in other communities or else 
the establishment of servitudes allowing one party to make use of anothers property.516 
All of these features reflect a highly developed concept of law, as well as property 
ownership, which may have been developed independently by the indigenous 
communities of Hispania Tarraconensis, but it unquestionably fit with the Romans 
own socio-juridical world view and was ripe for the activities of the land surveyors. 
3.9 Interstate Boundaries and Continuity at Histria 
When one civitas owned land within the territory of another, it introduced problems in 
interstate property demarcation and the organisation of the provincial landscape. 
Serafina Cuomo, drawing on the work of Susan Alcock, has suggested that provincial 
administrators in the Greek-speaking provinces privileged past traditions of property-
ownership and boundary demarcation to a greater extent than did their counterparts in 
the Western or African provinces.517 Her suggestion that the Romans tended to preserve 
the boundaries of Greek cities and pay attention to the views and sensibilities of Greek 
citizens over those of other cultural backgrounds is quite plausible, given the special 
place Greek culture occupied in the Roman imagination. Yet, the argument needs to be 
nuanced since both Greek and Latin inscriptions from other parts of the Empire show 
that generalised tendencies do not always hold true. 
Two fragmentary steles containing a bilingual set of administrative documents, 
published by Vasile Prvan during the First World War (Fig. 3.4), shed some interesting 
light on the ways in which the Romans established and then maintained interstate 
boundaries following the military occupation of a region.518 The inscriptions record five 
letters, written in Greek to the people of Histria by three Roman governors of Moesia

between the reigns of Claudius and Hadrian. These letters are framed by a Latin 
determinatio for a survey of Histrias civic territory and the final decretum, issued in a 
dispute between the people of Histria and Charagonius Philopalaestrus, tax-collector for 
the Thracian coast. The Greek letters, which are arranged so that the most recent is at 
the top of the stele and the oldest towards the bottom, document the civic council of 
Histrias petitions to the Roman administration for the imperial recognition of their 
ancestral boundaries, their status as an independent city, and their right to fish in the 
mouth of the Puce River, a tributary of the Danube, without being taxed.519 
This traditional diplomatic exchange between a particular provincial 
constituency and the imperial administration shows that the people of Histria did not 
assume that each successive governor, sent to the province, would automatically 
continue to recognise either their civic status or the boundaries that they and their 
ancestors had claimed. The Roman administration, for its own part, does not seem to 
have ever considered surveying the boundary to check the accuracy of the councils 
territorial claims. Nor do any of the emperors from Augustus to Hadrian seem to have 
ever seriously considered revoking Histrias status as a free city. Only when the tax 
collector Charagonius vigorously accredited his right to tax the Histrians, did the 
governor Manius Laberius Maximus actually have the territory owned by Histria 
formally delineated by Roman surveyors.520 
The text of the determinatio at the start of the inscription is too fragmentary to 
reconstruct its full contents, but the boundary follows the elliptical pattern for civic 
boundaries, found in the writings attributed to Hyginus, with flexus following mountain 
ridges and rivers and rigores connecting points across open country.521 The inscription 
only mentions a few features of the citys internal organisation, making it hard to 
reconstruct patterns of land-usage around the urban core. However, one of the letters in 
the collection, written to the civic council by one Flavius Sabinus, mentions that the 
people of Histria have documentation showing that they have the right to exploit timber 
from a forest within an unspecified subsection of their territory free of taxation.522

Archaeological and epigraphic evidence from other parts of Moesia, Lycia and Asia 
Minor suggests that cities in these provinces commonly held large tracks of rural land 
that were parcelled out into a variety of different types of administrative subdivisions, 
which frequently contained temples, villa estates or vici.523 Locally defined sub-districts 
of this sort, which varied in size and structure from city to city, were very much in 
keeping with the Roman understanding of land allocations. The remarkable feature of 
the allocations in this instance is not their apparent structure or age, but rather their 
extent. According to the surviving text of the determinatio, the people of Histria 
claimed a substantial part of the province for themselves. The total distance for the 
perimeter around Histria listed in the inscription was the incredible distance of 516 
Roman miles. While measurements were never made to the same exact standards as in 
the present, the Roman mile passus was approximately equal to 1.48 kilometres.524 
Applying that approximation, the boundary at Histria would have been roughly 763.7 
kilometres enclosing an area of 46,447.6 square kilometres. Roman surveyors had the 
technical ability to enclose such a large area, but it is very unlikely that the Roman 
administration would have allowed an independent community within the borders of the 
empire to claim so much land. The evidence from the photographs of the inscription 
(Fig. 3.4) and the text of the transcription suggests that Prvan copied the numbers off 
the stone correctly.525 A likely explanation for the anomalous distance figure Prvan 
reported in the text is that the stone mason copying the text of the decretum misread 
either an L or a C for the letter D. If the number was supposed to read CXVI, then the 
perimeter around Histria at 116 miles or 171.7 kilometres would have enclosed an area 
of 2,436 square kilometres. If the number in the text was supposed to read LXVI, then 
the perimeter around Histria at 66 miles or 97.7 kilometres, would have enclosed an 
area of 759.5 square kilometres. The second of these options, though still representing a 
wide expanse of territory, would be compatible with the enclosed area of land that other 
powerful cities such as Antiochia controlled during the second century AD.526 More 
importantly, whatever the Romans were willing to accept, any ancestral territorial 
boundary claimed by the people of Histria would by necessity reflect only the land 
which the city was able to secure for itself as a polis through its own military and 
diplomatic initiatives, following its foundation in the seventh century BC. It is hard to

see how the people of Histria maintained control over almost 800 square kilometres of 
land, let alone the higher figure. 
Regardless of the actual area controlled by the people of Histria, Laberius 
Maximus, in resolving the situation between the city and Charagonius, illustrated 
several key points of Roman policy toward long-established civic centres. First, the 
Roman administration accepted the civic-bodies declaration concerning its ancestral 
territorial jurisdiction. As with the cases from Daulis and Histonium discussed above, 
the Roman administrations choice to accept such a declaration rested upon the 
existence of prior documentation supported by material evidence on the ground. The 
Romans only surveyed such boundaries when someone presented a challenge to their 
validity or to the veracity of either the documentation or to the monumental features of 
the landscape establishing the physical existence of the boundary line itself. Finally, 
even when Roman administrators had a pre-existing boundary-line surveyed to resolve a 
dispute, years sometimes passed before surveyors undertook the fieldwork necessary to 
reaffirm the boundarys course in order to make the final decretum in a dispute 
binding.527 
Much of the administrations willingness to accept such declarations came from 
its inability to check the boundaries and property delineations of each and every 
community in the Empire. However, it also stemmed from the fact that the 
administrations own needs were serviced not by civic territorial boundary lines, but by 
the provincial boundary lines, tax districts and juridical conventus, superimposed onto a 
regions landscape when each province was created, a process explored in the next 
chapter. 
3.10 Continuity and Control in Africa Proconsularis and Mauritania 
Caesarensis 
While the document just examined comes from a predominantly Latin speaking 
province, there can be little question that it was produced by a Greek-speaking 
community. It is important to highlight that the production of monumental archives,

preserving important administrative documents in stone, which forms the majority of 
available evidence on large-scale surveying projects, was a cultural habit confined to the 
Greek-speaking population of the eastern provinces. In Africa and the west, such 
monuments were created in bronze or wood, which have long since been lost,528 and 
tend to be quite laconic. As Serafina Cuomo herself has remarked, the evidence for 
boundary disputes and authoritative demarcations in these regions tends to come from 
laconic boundary markers. Their text is so abbreviated that in many cases only someone 
very familiar with the epigraphic conventions of a given region would have known what 
the letters on the stones meant.529 This makes it very difficult to know if the Romans 
followed the same conventions of property adjudication and boundary preservation in 
non-Greek communities. 
Two sets of documents from the reign of Trajan have been put forward as 
evidence for arbitrary boundary-marking and colonial oppression. The first set of 
markers record the authoritative demarcation of property between the Musulamii and 
several neighbouring constituencies. The second set of documents comprises 
quadrilateral marker-stones, reporting the centuriation of several civitates near the 
modern site of Henchir Chenah in the valley of the Bled Segui in Tunisia. However, 
neither set of stones provides any indication as to why the demarcations were carried 
out. Moreover, it is important to consider both cases in light of two crucial historical 
events. One event was the insurgency of the Roman deserter Tacfarinas and his allies 
from the Musulamii, which inflicted widespread damage on crops, livestock, boundaries 
and buildings throughout Africa Proconsularis and Mauritania Caesariensis between 
18 and 23 AD.530 The other is the grain famine which struck Egypt at the start of 
Trajans reign in 99 AD.531 
Both of these instances probably influenced the two series of quadrilateral 
markers, found around Henchir Chenah and published by Pol Trousset in 1978.532 The 
first set, recording allocations ordered by the proconsul Vibius Marsus around 30 AD, 
consists of markers inscribed on two sides with grid notations for a Roman survey. It

follows a 200 km long base-line running from the fortress of Ammedara to the area of 
the Chott Djerid/Fedjedj, which covered an area of 39.1 by 49.7 km, centred at the top 
of Jebel dou el Haneiche.533 The reasons for this vast centuriation grid remain unclear, 
but since the markers make it clear that the civitates retained their political and juridical 
independence, it is likely that the demarcations were intended to re-establish stability 
for taxation in a region, whose traditional system of land-tenure had been badly 
disrupted by the war.534 In this respect, it is important to note that centuriation was not 
required for establishing taxation, but provincial lands occupied in war which were 
subject to taxation, agrum arcifinium vectigalem, and were to be enclosed by stone 
markers and a centuriated grid, though some surveyors felt that striga and scamna 
should be employed to distinguish this sort of survey from a colonial foundation.535 
More importantly, perhaps, the division and allocation was also intended to settle 
veterans either in self-regulating praefecturae or, as seems more likely from the 
inscriptions, on allocated lands subject to the jurisdiction of the indigenous civitates.536 
While this program of centuriation and integration might have provided a 
framework for the intensification of agriculture, transforming life in the Bled Segui, as 
Bruce Hitchner and David Mattingly have argued, two crucial factors could have 
limited its impact on the largely pastoralist population of the region.537 First and 
foremost, as Christopher Tilley illustrates in his article on walking in the landscape, 
agriculturalists, pastoralists and hunter-gatherers interact with and inhabit the landscape 
in quite different ways.538 While the hunter-gatherer takes the world with him, walking 
at the centre of a place filled with a meandering medley of sensations and experiences 
that shape memory and knowledge, the semi-nomadic pastoralist walk or ride between 
distant contrastive landscapes, held together by seasonal migration routes opening out 
the world into cyclical circular patterns.539 Both of these systems of inhabiting and 
structuring the landscape contrast sharply with the activities of the Roman surveyors,

who looked at the landscape and structured it by walking to create curving and straight 
lines of travel demarcating the use of places. 
A second factor, closely tied to the problem of local world view, is that the 
Roman administration depended upon local cooperation for the development of land, 
which was not directly owned and controlled by the emperor himself. As an inscription 
discovered in 1919 near the bank of the Trebisnjica River outside Niki in modern day 
Montenegro shows, the restoration of bridges and boundaries damaged by neglect, 
floods or through other natural disasters depended upon private land-holders or their 
representatives. They usually contracted with surveyors to see the work was done 
without much active oversight from the small number of imperial officials in the 
provinces.540 As will be seen, some civitates took the trouble to do this in the pursuit of 
their own interests. However, unless Roman veterans living amongst the population 
compelled the local leadership to maintain this sort of engagement with Roman 
administrative practice, most pastoralist communities probably would not have bothered 
even for the sake of raising grain to pay their taxes.541 
Another set of marker stones, which were set (posuita sunt) in position between 
the Nybgenii, one of the civitates named on the markers set up by Marsus, and the 
Tacapitani in accordance with a forma sent by Trajan, may be an imperial demarcation 
in response to this sort of local indifference, since there is no mention of a iudex or the 
decretum indicative of a boundary dispute.542 Moreover, another nearly identical marker 
recording a similar demarcation between the Thabborenses and the Thimisuenses by a 
centurion of the thirteenth urban cohort during the same period suggests that the 
demarcation for the Nybgenii was not just an isolated exercise in firming up a local 
system of land division, but rather, part of a larger project.543 There are no historical 
records to show what that project may have been. However, the use of a forma, which 
may have been derived from documentation produced by Marsus to monumentalise an 
interstate boundary in centuriated land, suggests that Trajan and his administrators were 
concerned with establishing continuity with the past and stability for the future. The

grain famine just mentioned provides an ideal context, since the emperor would be 
interested in creating an alternative bread-basket in the event that Egypts crops failed 
again in the future. The regulation of land-use was a crucial first step toward stimulating 
agricultural production in a region where, as Denis Kehoe and David Mattingly have 
both argued, it depended upon a cooperative effort between landowners and tenure 
farmers.544 
This need to regulate the use of agricultural land should also be seen as the 
impetus behind the establishment of boundaries between the pastoralist community of 
the Musulamii and their neighbours. Rather than being an attempt to create a sort of 
tribal reservation, as some scholars have suggested, each of these authoritative 
demarcations should be seen as an attempt to regularise the use of ager occupatorius, 
taken by private Roman settlers during the war with Tacfarinas and the pastoral or 
agricultural land of indigenous gentes.545 The point is clearest in the inscription 
regulating the boundary between the Musulamii and the estate of a woman named 
Valeria Atticilla in 106 AD.546 The inscription invokes the authority of the emperor, 
names the parties separated by the boundary, but does not mention a dispute. Instead, 
the text simply reports the distance measurements for a right-angled perimeter, 
measuring 90 by 716 feet reflecting irregular dimensions of land without the application 
of centuriation. 
Whether the Musulamii lost on this transaction or not it is impossible to say, but 
as was discussed in the previous chapter, every boundary was delineated in the presence 
of all parties whose land was involved. If the Musulamii understood the system of 
proofs involved with Roman surveying, then it is possible that they may have actually 
gained some land from one or more of their neighbours, since at least one of the 
boundaries was delineated multiple times. Sheila Ager has made a strong case for cities 
under the authority of the Romans, such as Melitaia in Thessaly, to have manipulated 
the Roman legal system to expand their territory at the expense of neighbouring 
communities.547 To be sure, the epigraphic evidence she presents applies to just one city

in the late Hellenistic period, and there may be other possible readings for some of the 
inscriptions presented by Ager in her study. Nonetheless, the potential for one city to 
gain territory and power at the expense of others by taking advantage of the Roman 
administrations unfamiliarity with local law or politics should be born in mind when 
considering inscriptions, such as those monumentalising the boundaries between the 
Musulamii. As other inscriptions considered below show, it was crucial for 
communities, who historically lost a war with Rome, to master the arts of Roman law 
and come to terms with the Roman surveyors in order to safeguard their interests. 
3.11 Colonies, Compulsion and the Transformation of the Provincial 
Landscape 
In considering the Trajanic markers from Tunisia, centuriation and the choice of 
indigenous gentes to engage with Roman surveyors, it is important to consider the 
impact of colonial foundations and the forced relocation of collective populations. For 
many indigenous gentes this violent and disruptive form of surveying was the first and 
sometimes most significant contact with Roman surveyors. As will be discussed further 
in the next chapter, the creation of colonies was frequently part of the Romans 
consolidation of control over a region. In the majority of cases, a colony was created as 
a new community built out of the ashes of an indigenous settlement, whose population 
was wiped out or relocated elsewhere by the Romans.548 Lingum in Britannia, Bracara 
in Lusitania and Colonia Iulia Flavia Augusta Corinthiensis in Achaia are all examples 
of this practice, which stimulated discourse and trade between indigenous communities 
and the Romans.549 In some cases, such as at Arausio, Forum Iulium and Emerita, the 
land for the new city was taken from a community, which continued to exist in the 
shadow of the colony.550 
The impact that this practice had on existing communities varied greatly with 
the foundation of some colonies in Italy, occupying so much land that they even 
incorporated parts of a pre-existing citys urban fabric into their pertica or assigned

lands.551 In rare cases, a colony was created out of an already inhabited Roman castra 
such as at Amadara, or in the midst of a thriving civic centre such as at Antiochia.552 
Because each colony was regulated by Roman law and specifically created by the 
surveyors to provide legionary veterans and civilian colonists with fundi, the inclusion 
of an existing indigenous community within the physical territory of a colony created a 
dynamic internal discourse about power and social identity, which was quite different 
from anything seen in the civitates or municipalities.553 
 To fully appreciate this distinction, it is necessary to look at the impact of 
surveying on the internal organisation of a colony and its impact on the indigenous 
population. A selection of inscriptions, along with archaeological evidence, shows that 
while the colonies were intended as Roman settlements and had a profound impact on 
the landscape, they were not, as several scholars have recently remarked, intended to 
consciously transform the culture of the indigenous population in order to incorporate 
them into the fabric of Roman society.554 Two of the inscriptions, illuminating the 
political gradation and social complexity of centuriation at both a proper colony and in a 
praefectura, are the Arausio and Lacimurga tablets, both of which were introduced in 
the previous chapter.555 One of the other two inscriptions is a bronze tablet from near 
the village of Esterzili on the island of Sardinia, which preserves the text of a decretum 
in a property dispute between the Patulcenses Campani  a Roman colonial foundation 
 and the indigenous Galillenses.556 The last text considered in this section is an 
honorific dedication, found near Gmenos in France, which details the political 
relationship between the pagus Lucreti, attached to the Colonia Iulia Paterna Arelate, 
and the civitas of the Arelatensies, within whose boundaries the pagus was actually 
located.557 
As was discussed in the last chapter, the Arausio and Lacimurga tablets are the 
surviving fragments of two cadastres reflecting the aes, which was the monumental

publication of the forma and its commentaria. Each forma simultaneously recorded the 
relationship between different physical features within the centuriated landscape, 
created by the surveyors and situated them inside a geometrically arranged theoretical 
framework.558 This framework was used to ascribe to each feature or section of land in 
the settlement a social and political identity created using a set of abbreviated tags.559 
The interpretation of these tags, like the abbreviated notations on boundary markers, 
formed part of the specialised knowledge of the surveyors. Four tags, whose meaning 
can be inferred from the writings of the Roman land surveyors, are important here. As 
Julien Dubouloz has recently argued, they create a stratified landscape of privilege and 
exclusion, illustrating that not everyone living within a colonys territorial jurisdiction 
was a part of the community subject to its liturgies and jurisdiction.560 These categories 
include: agri ex tributo soli, agri excepti, agri concessi, and most importantly, agri 
redditi. 
 In most colonial foundations, land was theoretically distributed equally to all 
either by sortation or by direct assignment based on preselected criteria, such as military 
rank.561 However, in mixed communities such as Emerita or Carthage, where soldiers 
and civilians who may not even have possessed Roman citizenship prior to the deductio 
were settled alongside one another, the imperial administration had to find a system of 
reward to satisfy soldiers with a particularly distinguished record of service and the 
wealthiest colonists.562 In keeping with Brian Campbells observations concerning the 
importance of Augustus in the development of surveying practice, it would seem likely 
that he developed the first two categories of land definition just mentioned to 
specifically reward colonists who enjoyed imperial favour. According to the authors in 
the Corpus Agrimensorum, the colonial deductor could grant a fundus which was 
exceptus or held by the possessor as part of the territory of the Res Publica Romana, so 
that it was not subject to taxes or liturgies levied by the colonial administration.563 A

slightly less exalted honour was for the deductor to grant a colonist a fundus, which was 
ex tributo soli or exempt from payment of property taxes.564 
 Alongside these two sets of privileges, the Roman administration maintained 
another set of distinctions, which singled out individuals and small groups of indigenous 
possessors for special treatment. These distinctions may have been intended to mitigate 
the disruption and anger which the Roman administration was all too aware colonisation 
caused.565 One policy, which has been attested in Italy and at eastern cities such as 
Antiochia and Epirus, was for the deductor to pay financial compensation to evicted 
land-owners and incorporate the existing civic structures of the community into the 
monumental centuriated landscape of a new imperial city.566 
If the deductor wished to return land to those who held it prior to the deductio, 
he could do so in several ways. One way was for the deductor to reassign subseciva, 
which, as Brian Campbell and Julien Dubouloz have both argued, remained in the hands 
of the emperor and could freely be allocated to the colony as public forest or pasture 
land, sold to private land-holders, or reassigned to the communities from which it was 
taken.567 Another option was for a deductor to grant a fundus concessus, which was an 
extra-legal allocation to anyone containing more land than the colonial charter made 
available in a single allotment.568 
A further practice, attested on the Arausio tablets, was for the colonial deductor 
to make grants of agri redditi prior possessum to individual land-holders.569 The exact 
meaning of agri redditi remains uncertain, but Michael Crawford and Brian Campbell 
have interpreted stating that land was returned to an individual, who established 
themselves as vetus possessor in the eyes of the Roman administration.570 The author of 
the De Conditionibus Agrorum, attributed to Hyginus, certainly establishes agri redditi 
as a legal concept. In fact, he states that land taken in war by the Roman people, which

was not allocated to veteran settlers because it was in excess of what was required, was 
rented out for extended periods. However, it would sometimes be restored to a named 
individual or individuals, if they could prove that they held prior title to the land in a 
Roman court.571 
 The more common practice, however, seems to have been for a deductor to 
simply return allocated plots to prior possessors at his sole discretion.572 Since the return 
of such lands did not always satisfy either colonists or the indigenous land-holders, 
room was left in the allocations for possessors to trade sections of land, so that they 
could form fundi containing both agricultural and forest or pastoral land. The principal 
distinctions between the two conditions was, in part, that one was undertaken after the 
fact, while the other was done at the moment of creation, which may have involved the 
civic status of the land-holder. Individuals who proved title after the fact may have 
gained a legal position within the colony, as those who bought land in the municipalities 
But, unless there was a clause in the colonial charter or an imperial edict, which 
provided for prior possessores to be subject to the liturgies and jurisdiction of the 
colony, veteri possessores were subject to the taxes and liturgies of their home 
community.573It was undoubtedly the existence of constitutional clauses placing veteri 
possessores under the jurisdiction of colonial magistrates, which prompted Siculus 
Flaccus to observe that, while a deductor frequently returned land to the indigenous 
inhabitants of a community when founding a colony, there were cases in which 
jurisdiction over that land was not returned along with the right of occupation and 
use.574 
 While both Andre Piganiol and Julian Dubouloz have used the tag of iugera 
Tricostini redditi, found on the Arausio tablets, to argue that the Roman administration 
returned land as a benefaction to provincial gentes, such as the Tricostini as well as to 
Italians and Roman citizens such as those at Verona, the grant was perhaps a mixed

blessing.575 To be sure the allotments within a colonial deductio returned to veteri 
possessors from a civitas, such as the Tricostini, would have been recorded on the 
forma and in the commentaria coloniae, protecting their legal status under Roman law, 
as Julian Dubouloz has argued.576 But there were distinctly different rates of taxation 
between colonies and civitates, which along with cultural differences and competing 
territorial jurisdictions may have produced serious tension and contention between the 
veteri possessors and colonists.577 
Yet, three factors seem to have mitigated this problem. First and foremost, the 
Roman administration only granted land within the colony to veteri possessores, who 
were already fully conversant with and accepting of Roman law and culture.578 
Secondly, the Roman administration depended upon bonds of obligation created by 
these land grants to stimulate participation in the colonial judicial system, where 
multiple legal systems could operate in tandem under a foundational charter, which was 
crafted to fit the local situation.579 Third, the surveyors presented a monumental aes, 
depicting the landscape experienced by individual colonists and transformed through 
their craft, before a united audience of imperial officials and the colonists themselves, to 
create a sense of community. 
While the authors in the Corpus Agrimensorum only discuss the aes as a public 
reference for the resolution of property disputes, a role amply illustrated by the 
inscription from Sardinia considered below, its role as a focus for the discursive 
formation of a colonys collective identity can be deduced from several pieces of 
evidence. First, Siculus Flaccus, when discussing ager occupatorius, makes the 
observation that there were no formae or aeres for this category of land, since it was not 
held by virtue of a survey, but many possessors of this type of land nonetheless 
produced formae of their own and their neighbours holdings.580 This shows that land-
holders considered the forma and its publicly displayed aes to have been a significant 
declaration of both ownership and position within a community.

This individual interest in displaying the boundaries of private property was 
perhaps a natural outgrowth of the system of negotiated boundaries and property 
identity, seen in the cases from the Cantiaci and Histonium considered above. More 
importantly, this interest was clearly echoed on the marble fragments of aeres recorded 
by Mommsen at Rome, where Augustus had the names of individual possessors, 
inscribed for each delineated property along with the quantity of water allocated to each 
fundus.581 Like the Arausio tablets, which display two or possibly three consecutive 
deductions carried out at the order of the emperor, they were created to monumentalise 
the ideological control of the imperial administration over the relationship between 
individuals and the land at a formative moment for both.582 As has already been 
discussed, surveyors or their assistants publicly hung up the aes high on the wall of a 
building to ritually conclude a colonial deductio and reaffirm that the community was 
fully constituted in accordance with the terms of its charter. The text from Daulis 
discussed above partially shows the importance which civic magistrates placed in this 
ritual display of a surveyed territory. It validated and formed public space in the 
consciousness not just of the community but in the minds of all those who might 
experience the space from outside. 
However, it is clear from passages in the Corpus Agrimensorum that much of 
the aess contents was presented in obscure abbreviations best known to the surveyors, 
and in a position from which it is doubtful that even the most literate members of the 
community could have read the text.583 This would tend to suggest that, while people 
did refer to the aes in the course of litigation, the real power of the aes, like most 
publicly displayed legal documents, was in the symbolic legibility of its contents, rather 
than its physical accessibility.584 Both Jennifer Trimble and Richard Talbert have 
suggested that monumental diagrams of geometrically structured space functioned as 
articulations of power relationships, political hierarchies, cultural practices and social 
identities, which were embedded in a specific location.585

The associations between historical events, significant within a particular 
cultural matrix, social position, political power and depicted locations, were activated 
through discourse prompted by the shared experience of viewing an inscribed 
monument in a significant location. Neither Trimble nor Talbert explain the mechanics 
behind this system of visual comprehension and confine their application of the 
theoretical framework to the Forma Urbis Romae, their suggestion that communal 
memories of significant places embedded in the formas union of text and image has 
much in common with arguments put forward by Michael Squire for the ways in which 
elite viewers interpreted what might be termed annotated or inscribed art. Squire has 
argued that viewing art in the Hellenistic and Roman periods demanded that a viewer 
draw social meaning from the relationship between literary text and graphic or plastic 
subjects, the compositions physical location and any absent cultural references, implied 
by the work which were not present before uttering a verbal response to the composition 
in the presence of other viewers.586 
This multi-layered social concept of viewing, so different from anything in the 
modern world, was deeply embedded in the popular Platonic and Stoic philosophies of 
the period. Yet, it was not out of reach for much of the population, since many people 
outside the political elite constructed works of art annotated by inscriptions.587 Even 
though the system of viewing Squire advocates was best suited for subtle games of 
disjunctive meaning, best appreciated by the educated elite in a private setting, not 
every work of art needed to contain such obscure references nor did every viewer have 
to appreciate all the subtle references in a piece of art for the system to function as a 
cultural paradigm.588 
Within this cultural paradigm, the aes, which was probably both engraved and 
painted to make key boundaries or features stand out, would have stimulated memories 
and cultural associations, empowering those within the community on two different 
levels.589 On a passive level, it would have reminded people of where they were and 
what the structural identity of their community was through the act of casual collective 
viewing. Above all, people passed through the space in which the document was hung,

much as people were reminded of their history on a casual level by the inscribed statues 
and paintings, encountered in both public and private spaces throughout a city. On a 
more active level, the aes would have functioned as the focus of intellectual and legal 
discourse, much as Varro and his friends employed the pictorial rendering of Italy at the 
start of his work on agriculture, as a springboard and unmentioned focus for their 
conversation on life in the Italian countryside.590 The aeres at Daulis, Arausio and 
elsewhere would have functioned as a mnemonic device, reminding the collective 
viewers of places in the community made famous by the presence of significant 
individuals or through key events, which were a monumental part of the lived landscape 
shaping their everyday identities. 
3.12 Continuity, Conflict and Control in the Forma from Sardinia 
One document illustrating some of the discursive properties of the aes and forma is the 
bronze tablet from Esterzili on Sardinia. The tablet records the decretum of the Roman 
governor L. Helvidius Agrippa in a property dispute between the Patulcenses, who held 
a block of divided and allocated land near modern Partedi, and the indigenous 
Galillenses, whose civitas was near modern Gerrei: 
When the Emperor Otho Caesar Augustus was consul, 16 days before the 
Kalends of April (17th of March 69 AD). Transcribed and authenticated 
from the bound codex of Lucius Helvius Agrippa, proconsul, which Gnaeus 
Egnatius Fuscus, quaestorial scribe produced, in which was written what has 
been written out below. On page 5 at headings 8, 9 and 10: 3 days before the 
Ides of March (27th of February) Lucius Helvius Agrippa, Proconsul, once 
the case had been heard, declared: Since for the sake of the public good it is 
appropriate to abide by cases that have been adjudicated, and with regard to 
the case of the Patulcenses, Marcus Juventius Rixa, a very distinguished 
man and the Augustan procurator, has more than once proclaimed that the 
boundaries of the Patulcenses must be maintained just as they were 
arranged by Marcus Metellus on the bronze tablet, and in the end, he 
proclaimed that he wanted to punish the Galillenses, who had frequently 
renewed the dispute and who were not complying with his verdict, but out 
of respect for the clemency of the best and greatest princeps, he would be 
content to admonish them with an edict whereby they would be quiet and 
abide by rulings in prior cases, and before the Kalends of October next, 
withdraw from the lands of the Patulcenses and surrender the empty 
property. But if they persisted with their wilful disobedience to judicial

decrees, he would direct his severity against those responsible for the 
sedition. And later on, when Caecilius Simplex, a very illustrious man, on 
account of the same case was approached by the Galillenses, pleading that 
they would produce a document pertaining to their situation from the 
Archive of the Princeps, proclaimed that it would be humane for an 
evidentiary adjournment to be granted and gave them a period of three 
months, until the Kalends of December, on which day, if the map (forma) 
was not produced, he would observe the one which was in the province. 
When I was also approached by the Galillenses with excuses, because the 
map (forma) had not yet been produced, granted them a further period (of 
grace) until the Kalends of the February which was next, and I understood 
that the delay was agreeable to the possessors. Let the Galillenses depart 
from within the boundaries of the Patulcenses Campani, which they have 
occupied by force, before the next Kalends of April. And if they do not 
comply with the demands of this proclamation, let them understand that 
they will be liable for punishment on account of their longstanding and 
frequently denounced criminal conduct. Present in his concilium were: 
Marcus Julius Romulus, the propraetorian legate; Titus Atilius Sabinus, 
Propraetorian Quaestor; Marcus Stertinius Rufus, son of (Marcus); Sextus 
Aelius Modestus; Publius Lucretius Clemens; Marcus Domitius Vitalis; 
Marcus Lusius Fidus; and Marcus Stertinius Rufus. Witnesses: Cnaeus 
Pompeius Ferox; Aurelius Gallus; Marcus Blossus Nepos; Gaius Cordus 
Felix; Lucius Vigellus Crispinus; Gaius Valerius Faustus; Marcus Lutatus 
Sabinus; Lucius Cocceius Genialis; Lucius Plotius Verus; Decimus Veturus 
Felix; Lucius Valerius Peplus.591 
A prominent feature of this case, which is not self-evident from the text, is that the 
Patulcenses initiated the dispute by complaining to the procurator of Corsica and 
Sardinia about a group of Galillenses, who were squatting on unoccupied land claimed 
as part of the formal territory of the colony. In doing so, they opened up an ever 
intensifying discourse with a non-Roman civitas about the nature of the provincial 
landscape. That challenge forced the Galillenses to engage with Roman concepts of 
land-ownership and surveying. Whether the Galillenses observed similar legal traditions 
with the Romans or not, they would have required legal advice and representation in the 
hearings before Juventius Rixa, the imperial procurator. If the Galillenses were veteri 
possessores, occupying subseciva through the right of usucapio or as agri concessi 
Augusti, then it is possible that they had the support of a surveyor. Unfortunately, in 
spite of a detailed article by Margi Kantor, showing that Roman juridical knowledge 
entered the courts of provincial governors and procurators through both the 
administrators direct application of the law, local juridical experts and through the 
petitions of litigants, little is known about how civitates like the Galillenses formally

accessed legal knowledge necessary to conduct their cases before Roman magistrates.592 
Even so, the text of the inscription makes it clear that the Galillenses believed that their 
case was strong enough in both mutual and legal terms to disregard the ruling by Rixa 
and a subsequent edict ordering them off the land. 
Rixas initial ruling, which he probably delivered from a tribunal in the forum of 
the Patulcenses, validated the argument made by the Patulcenses that their boundaries 
had to be maintained just as they were arranged by Marcus Metellus on the bronze 
tablet. Since it can be documented that other colonies sold off or yielded land to 
outsiders, their argument was not strictly based in law, though the extraterritorial sale of 
colonial land may have required approval from the emperor.593 Rather, it reflects a 
strong conservative sense of ownership and self-identity, grounded in the rhetorical role 
of the aes as an intellectual bridge between the forma censualis of individual 
possessores and the concept of the colony as a collective entity, set within specific 
topographical limits. This construction reflects the theoretical framework for the 
formation of a colony, discussed in the previous chapter. It also helps to illustrate that 
the formation was not just an intellectual concept confined to the writings of the Roman 
surveyors, but permeated outwards into the thinking of at least the colonial elite and 
Roman provincial administrators. 
In the context of the trial, the aes was a symbol of the colony which need not have 
been read off at any point by litigants or magistrates, even when they referenced it as 
their source of authority for their arguments. It was enough for the aes to be present and 
for people to know its general previsions through collective viewing. Only when the 
Galillenses challenged its cultural authority by requesting an adjournment to consult 
documents in Rome, it was necessary for the provincial authorities to reference the 
higher authority invested in the forma. Thus, the request to consult documents at Rome 
intensified and elevated the level of discourse, transcending the bounds of local public 
authority. It was vested in the power of public documents, contained within two 
communities of a province. It also invoked the authority held over everyone by the 
imperial administration at Rome. In granting that request, after giving the Galillenses a

hearing over a prolonged period, the proconsul Helvius Agrippa shows that, while the 
Roman administration may have been prejudiced in favour of Roman colonists, they 
were willing to recognise that the final say in any matter rested with the emperor. It was 
possible for him to have made a concession to the Galillenses, which was recorded at 
Rome, but which had not been added to the copy of the forma held in the provincial 
archives. 
As Junius Nipsus and Siculus Flaccus both observe, in the event of a dispute over 
unoccupied lands in a colony, it was essential for a surveyor to consult not only the aes 
and the forma, but the imperial book of benefactions for the province, in order to make 
sure that the emperor had not exercised his privileges and granted the land as part of a 
supplementary colonial allocation or as ager concessus Augusti.594 To judge from the 
text of the inscription, the proconsul thought that the Galillenses were searching for the 
emperors copy of the forma, while in truth they may have been searching for the text of 
an edict, which granted them title to the land. In either case, their inability to secure the 
required documents should not be seen as proving them in the wrong since the violent 
events at Rome in 69 AD could well have prevented them from accessing the imperial 
archives. 
3.13 Lines of Control and Realms of Identity in the Provincial 
Landscape 
While the activities of the Galillenses and Patulcenses suggest that they lived within a 
world system regulated by the universalising tendency, discussed in Chapter One, and a 
specific form of geo-political framework regulated by surveyed boundaries, it does not 
elaborate on that framework in any detail. Conversly, a later inscription from Arles 
clearly articulates a world view, in which communities were defined by a graduated 
scale of shifting, intersecting and overlapping boundaries and forming discrete spheres 
of identity within the administrative and geographic framework of a province, regulated 
by the central authority at Rome.

Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             166 
 
The notes of tension and contention implied in the articulation of self-identity and 
the discrepant experience of power under Rome, as they were articulated, ripple across 
the provincial landscape and up the graduated scale of the imperial hierarchy, in a 
manner which complements and augments those narrated in the text just considered. 
The truly remarkable feature of the text is that it was not a monumental boundary 
marker or the account of a property dispute, but rather an honorific dedication set up to 
the wealthy freedman Quintus Cornelius Zosimus by a group of people living on a rural 
estate outside the Colonia Julia Paterna Arelatis, which casually employed Roman 
surveying terminology to structure the relationship between a group of clientes and their 
patron: 
The countrymen of the Lucretian Pagus, who are within the territorial 
boarders (finibus) of the Arelatensies, on the Gargarian estate (loco 
Gargario), dedicate this to the honour of Quintus Cornelius Zosimus, 
freedman of Marcellus, member of the board of six Augustales at the 
Colonia Julia Paterna Arelatis, who conducted the case concerning our 
injustice to the most holy princeps of the entire world, Titus Aelius 
Antoninus Augustus Pius, at Rome three times. For many years he 
petitioned the proconsuls of the province. He sought redress for our injustice 
at his own expense. And for this (reason) provided on our behalf, the 
financial outlay which made it so that the benefactions of the most holy 
princeps of the entire world, the Emperor Caesar Antoninus Augustus Pius, 
for the water and public bathing establishment, which we were enjoying free 
of charge, and which was discontinued for the country folk, though they had 
utilised it for more than 40 years, might endure and remain perpetual for all 
time.595 
In describing themselves, the pagani or country folk of this inscription make it 
clear that they were citizens of the colony, who enjoyed benefits there for a considerable 
period. But they do not claim to be Roman citizens. While Murielle Faudot has 
suggested that they were a mixed group of Roman and indigenous Gallo-Roman tenants 
farmers  a suggestion which fits with recent scholarship on veteran settlement  the 
Roman agrarian economy and the asymmetrical social relationships between Roman 
patrons and their clients cannot be established beyond question.596

Far more important than the social identity of the countrymen is the language they 
used to construct their place in Roman society and their relationship to the wider world. 
They claim to be the countrymen of the locus Gargarius, which is in the pagus Lucreti. 
Within the juridical taxonomy, employed by Roman surveyors and jurists, a locus was, 
broadly speaking, any settlement site, and in the narrow sense that the term was used by 
the pagani, it was either a portion of a larger villa estate, or else a fundus joined with 
others to form a latifundum.597 Since colonial pagi were most commonly created by the 
deductor as ager consessus through the allocation of land to colonists without any 
limites, the locus Gargarius was probably a fundus comprised of small holdings, 
incorporated into a larger estate in an outlying rural district.598 More than twenty such 
semi-autonomous rural districts belonged to the Colonia Julia Paterna Arelatis. 
However, it seems to be the only one which was finibus Arelatensium or within the 
territorial boundaries of another community.599 Such a description suggests that the 
pagani understood themselves to be a collective group working land. It was part of an 
estate which itself was owned by a larger estate set within the boundaries of an un-
centuriated district that belonged to a colony, but which was physically enclosed by the 
boundaries of a non-Roman civitas. 
Furthermore, the language used to describe the activities of Zosimus, the patron of 
the pagani and Antoninus Pius, suggests that they conceptualised pagus, civitas and 
colony as all being situated politically and geographically within a province 
administered by a governor, which was in turn under the emperor at Rome, who ruled 
over the entire world. There is nothing in the inscription to show how the pagani 
envisioned the physical structure of the province, but the phrase omnis saeculus as a 
method of describing the extent of the emperors power is quite telling. It suggests that, 
like the Roman land surveyors, the pagani from the locus Gargarius considered their 
community as being encompassed by the boundaries of the civitas, which contained it 
and the province itself as being contained within a spherical world over which the 
emperor held absolute power.600

The surveyors geographical world view and their role in creating provinces as a 
framework for interstate interaction and imperial administrative activity will be 
discussed more fully in the next chapter. At this point, it is worth noticing that the 
encompassing boundaries of the aes, found in the inscription from Sardinia and those 
conceptualised as encompassing the locus Gargarius and its pagus in this text, seem to 
be similar topographical constructions born of the surveyors craft. When they are 
considered with the system of property boundaries in the texts from Histonium and the 
pagus Cantiacorum examined above, they tend to substantiate Chouquers argument for 
seeing the Roman landscape as a series of graduated interlocking circles, which began 
with individual holdings and expanded upward and outward in a complicated 
stratigraphy. 
3.14 The Limites of Power in the Roman Provinces 
Before moving on to explore the role of surveyors in Roman conquest and the creation 
of the provinces, two final points raised by the situations introduced by the Galillenses 
and the pagani from the locus Gargarius need to be considered. The first is the problem 
of local resistance to the surveyors and the implementation of judicial decreta. Helena 
Abreu de Carvalho, reporting on Breccara Augusta, and William Bowden, reviewing 
the built environment of Epirus, have convincingly argued that indigenous populations 
around a colony freely entered into a discourse with the colonists to develop the 
landscape. This occurred frequently, even relocating their settlement sites to take 
advantage of the imperial communications network, extending from the limites of the 
new settlement, out along and across rivers and mountains to link the distant parts of the 
Roman world.601 Yet, the problems faced by the Galillenses and the presence of the 
locus Gargarius within the territory of the Arelatensies show that the discourse could be 
heated and contentious. 
 While the locus Gargarius may have been established on land, bought from the 
Arelatensies by one Lucretius to establish the pagus, the existence of pagi in Italy, 
whose boundaries encompassed land from two different communities, suggests that

Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             169 
 
many were created by the right of usucapio in agri occupatorio.602 Epigraphic evidence 
advises that the need to secure land for use against this sort of conduct under Roman 
law was acute enough to stimulate even semi-nomadic tribes, such as the Rodopeis of 
Thrace, to employ surveyors, in order to establish boundaries to regulate land and 
adjudicate disputes.603 
 Even so, the involvement of surveyors in local matters was not always a choice 
for all concerned in a local dispute. There were unquestionably times when angry cattle-
drovers and land-holders used violence to obstruct a survey. However, the only 
documentary record of such an event comes from a series of fragmentary letters, 
preserved on marble blocks, which once formed an archive wall in the Greek city of 
Koroneia. The letters were all addressed to the Koroneioi and their southern neighbours, 
the Thisbeis, by Hadrian and Antoninus Pius. Modern commentators still do not agree 
on the original order of presentation for the documents inscribed on the wall, making it 
difficult to establish the exact sequence of events, chronicled in the surviving 
documents.604 
What is clear from four of the letters is that, shortly after Hadrian initiated the 
construction of an aqueduct and drainage project intended to reclaim land from Lake 
Copais in 125 AD, the people of Koroneia petitioned the emperor to adjudicate a 
dispute, involving summer pasture high in the mountains between Koroneia and the 
land of the Thisbeis.605 The problems may have involved negotiating servitudes to 
transport water across the land of other civic territories and the flooding of fields caused 
by problems in the engineering works or control over previously unusable land. This 
disrupted agricultural and pastoral activities, though from the documents long-running 
political tensions were involved as well.606 Whatever the cause, Hadrians direct 
instigation of the project prompted him to appoint a special judge, a local magnate 
named Mestrios Aristonymos, to hear the case instead of handing the matter back to the 
provincial governor in the usual way. After looking into the matter, Aristonymos 
assigned the pasture to the people of Koroneia. However, his judgment was not

respected and fighting broke out between the two communities. Hadrian responded to 
this breach of the peace not with force, as was done in similar situations elsewhere in 
the Empire, but with a letter admonishing the two communities:607 
(A letter) of the divine Hadrian, written to the Thisbeis. The Koroneioi 
wrote to me, accusing you of doing the opposite of what Mestrios 
Aristonymos decided on my order, but it was right  when you did not obey 
the decisions but began invading their territory  that they should resort to 
preventing you from grazing. How much the tax due to them is, or what 
security of yours the Koroneioi have kept, Aristonymos himself will judge. 
Farewell.608 
Following this letter, the Thisbeis apparently changed tactics and like other 
Greek states, which lost a property dispute at the highest levels of the Roman 
judicial system, challenged the validity of the boundary used as a guide to award 
the property.609 In 154 AD Antoninus Pius issued a ruling ordering a survey of the 
land in question. However, one party or the other in the case was unhappy with 
the survey and used force to obstruct the work. Antoninus Pius, exasperated by 
the situation, ordered the proconsular governor of the province to carry out an 
investigation into the matter and punish those responsible for this condition: 
The Emperor Caesar, son of the Divine Hadrian, grandson of the Divine 
Trajan Parthicus, great grandson of the Divine Nerva, Titus Aelius 
Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus, Pontifex Maximus, holding the tribunician 
power for the 18th time, (hailed as) Emperor two times, consul for the 4th 
time, Father of the Fatherland, to the magistrates, council and people of the 
Koroneioi, greetings. I have sent you a copy of the verdict which I made 
between you and the Thisbeis, and I wrote also to Mestrios Aristonymos to 
measure out the plethra for the Thisbeis which my divine father ordered to 
be given to them. And if the Thisbeis should persuade you (to allow them) 
to pasture (their livestock) on some of the land outside (the allocated area), 
they will pay a pasturage tax. If ever they should also restore as much as 
they are judged to owe for the previous period (when they occupied your 
land), it is clear that you will also restore the collateral to them. Ailios 
Glykon and Dionysios son of Dionysodoros were the envoys, to whom the 
travel allowance should be granted unless they promised it as a gift.

The Emperor Caesar, son of the divine Hadrian, grandson of the divine 
Trajan Parthicus, great-grandson of the divine Nerva, Titus Aelius 
Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus, Pontifex Maximus, (holding the) 
tribunician power for the 18th time, (hailed as) Emperor for the 2nd time, 
consul for the 4th time, Father of the Fatherland, to the magistrates, council 
and people of the Koroneoi, greetings. Upon hearing your decree, I ordered 
a copy of those things which I sent to the Thisbeis to be sent to you so that 
you might know that I considered the matter worthy of attention. Because 
you accuse them and they accuse you of not allowing the measurement of 
the plethora to occur in accordance with the verdict that my divine father 
rendered concerning these matters and which I, judging it to be valid, 
uphold. Hence forth, the proconsul will be responsible for finding out which 
of the two parties (in this dispute) are the ones refusing to comply with prior 
judgments, and he will provide for the quickest possible way to establish the 
resolutions of the verdicts ... by Aristonymos so that a quick conclusion 
might be made of an affair ... providing an origin and an excuse to the cities 
for strife and rivalry. The ambassadors were Aelius Glykon, Alo... gift, as 
you made clear through your decree. Farewell.611 
It is important to recognise that the violence, which was unquestionably used to 
disrupt the survey in this case, represented a response to and rejection of the decretum, 
issued by Aristonymos. Surveyors drew their authority to act from the individual or 
individuals who commissioned the survey. The testimony of Agennius Urbicus, Ulpian 
and Paul indicates that attempts to bribe, threaten and perhaps even beat surveyors into 
acting against their better judgment or to prevent the implementation of a decretum 
were a common concern.612 In this case, however, the situation was probably 
exacerbated by the nature of the project started by Hadrian and the unusual latitude he 
gave to the Greeks. Had he shown a strong hand when the problem of the boundary had 
first come to light as Pius? He eventually did, it is likely that violence would have been 
averted and the case would not have dragged on for nearly thirty years. 
 Fortunately, not every imperial surveying operation was so monumental in scope 
or duration. Most direct opposition to other imperial surveys rarely reached the point 
that an armed response was required, and emperors like Hadrian and Pius only became 
directly involved when matters of imperial patronage were a concern. The situation at 
Aizanoi, considered elsewhere in this study, is perhaps a prime example. As discussed 
in Chapter One, the people of Aizanoi were locked in an internal struggle over whether 
or not a small group of land-holders had to pay rent to the civic government to maintain

and/or finance the rebuilding of the Temple of Zeus.613 When the problem was placed 
before the Roman proconsul for adjudication, Mettius Modestus ruled that the rents 
were due. The question was then how much each land-holder should pay and from what 
point in time payments should be considered due. The problem was compounded by the 
fact that the pattern of land-holding had been greatly disrupted, since the original 
foundation of the temple occurred some three hundred years earlier. This factor 
contributed to the notion that the rents were considered a fiction dreamed up by the 
temple priesthood. 
Concerned about the possibility of civil unrest over the matter, the proconsul 
Avidius Quietus intervened and/or commissioned surveyors to establish the average size 
of allotments in the region around Aizanoi and with the backing of Hadrian fixed a date 
for payment. Not content with this situation, a number of land-holders, presumably 
using information derived from the surveyors investigations, challenged their need to 
pay rent on the grounds that their land was outside the temples boundary. Sensing an 
opportunity to enhance his image as an imperial benefactor, Hadrian pledged the money 
to rebuild the temple and dispatched a centurion to survey the outer boundary of the 
temple, putting an end to the question of whether or not people had to pay rent. The 
centurion, acting under the direct authority of the emperor, established a series of 
bilingual boundary markers, which stated in no uncertain terms that they marked what 
Hadrian accepted as the ancestral boundary-line around the Temple of Zeus: 
The Emperor Caesar Trajan Hadrian Augustus, Father of the Fatherland, 
Consul for the 3rd time, (holding the) tribunician power for the 13th time, 
restored the boundaries given to Zeus the Founder and the community of the 
Aezaniti by Attalus and Prusias the Kings, since Septimius Saturninus, the 
primus pilus made a measurement, such as King Prusias had established.614 
Whether the continuity Saturninus established between Hadrian and Prusias by 
creating the boundary around the temple had any historical truth behind it, was not 
important. The people of Aizanoi, like the Siccaenae, employed surveyors or survey 
knowledge to make a claim about geometrically constructed space under Roman law. 
Thus, the emperor had countered that claim using the exact same principles. People, 
regardless of their citizenship, consulted with surveyors to reorganise the landscape and

stake a claim to it within the very specific ontological system of justification, derived 
from the Hellenistic principles of proof. Not every group of people in the Empire 
subscribed to that world view. As a consequence, many communities never bothered to 
organise land and their dwellings on it in accordance with the principles practiced by 
the Roman surveyors. Indeed, the only reason to organise the landscape in this fashion 
was to make a claim about it in the face of Roman power. 
It was that power which Saturninus accredited in the name of Hadrian, and it was 
that power relationship which prompted someone to inscribe the Greek letter of Quietus 
and its supporting documentation on the wall of the pronaos in the Temple of Zeus.615 
Like the bilingual boundary-markers, which reminded the tenants of their place on the 
land and the obligation to pay rent to the temple for it, the letters were a reminder to the 
priesthood that their privilege to collect the rents along with their temple itself and the 
province within which the entire city of Aizanoi was situated, were a construction of the 
emperor and the surveyors who served him.

Chapter Four: Storming the World: Agrimensores, 
Measurement and Roman Power Beyond the Frontiers 
For while I was more involved in military service, I set this entire business 
aside as if it were forgotten, thinking about nothing except the glory of war. 
After we entered enemy territory for the first time though, Celsus, at once 
the operations of our Caesar began to require surveying skill.616 
4.1 Introduction 
Written by the Roman surveyor Balbus, these lines constitute one of the few passages in 
the whole of Latin literature that equate Roman conquest with technical skill. As such, it 
is an open invitation to explore the role of surveyors and surveying in Roman warfare 
and conquest. Yet only Robert Sherk in his 1974 article on Roman military exploration 
and geographic mapping has seriously considered the subject.617 While this study forms 
a valuable starting point, it is not without its problems and Sherks discussion does not 
represent a full account of the surveyors role in Roman conquest. Using the text of 
Balbus and the work of Sherk as a guide, this chapter reconsiders the place of surveyors 
within the Roman army and, specifically, their role in the exploration and conquest of 
territory beyond Romes control. It will pay particular attention to the tasks that the 
surveyors carried out while the Roman army was on campaign, the way in which they 
carried out these tasks, and the impact of their activities on the imperial administrations 
own conception of the Empire. 
Because of limitations introduced by the available range of evidence, a 
comparative approach will be adopted here, in which information from a range of 
contexts will be used to assess the impact of military surveyors in conquest and the 
creation of new provinces as discrete spaces under Roman control. In order to structure 
such a complicated synthesis of material, the chapter is broken into two parts. The first 
section, which is structured around the narrative of Balbus, discusses the practical

contribution of surveyors and surveying to the tactical situation of a Roman army on 
campaign. The second section leaves the narrative of Balbus to consider a range of 
sources with the aim of exploring how the surveyors activities on campaign shaped the 
Roman administrations understanding of the Empire through the creation of provinces 
as formally defined places marked by boundaries. 
4.2 Balbus and the Narrative of Conquest 
The text of the surveying treatise written by Balbus, which was introduced in Chapter 
Two, contains more details about the activities of legionary surveyors on campaign than 
any other surviving document. Balbus, however, because he was not primarily writing 
about either the campaign he participated in or about the Roman army as an institution, 
omits material on military surveyors found in other works and, as the discussion in 
previous chapters has shown, was deeply engaged in a dialogue with Greek 
philosophy.618 It is therefore important to understand exactly what it was that Balbus 
wrote and why he wrote it in order to properly synthesise the three examples of the 
surveyors craft considered in the following sections into a full picture of the surveyors 
contribution to Roman tactical operations. 
According to his own account, Balbus was a young surveyor, who, in a quest for 
personal glory, answered a call for volunteers to serve as part of an expedition to 
Dacia.619 During his service, Balbus apparently caught the eye of the imperial high-
command by demonstrating an unusual aptitude for surveying. When hostilities were 
concluded, Balbus was granted the rare honour of a years leave from the legion to 
compose a work on the mathematic principles of surveying.620 Balbus, writing in the 
spirit of Euclid, Archimedes and Eratosthenes addressed and, perhaps, sent his work to 
his friend and former teacher Celsus, who may have been an Alexandrian 
mathematician of some standing.621 As the discussion in Chapter Two has already 
indicated, the work Balbus composed contained a summary of all the principles of

geometric surveying and natural philosophy Balbus had learned during his 
apprenticeship and a number of new applications developed while on campaign.622 The 
principle that warfare contributed directly to the advancement of human knowledge was 
not uniquely held by Balbus, and is a point which will receive more attention below.623 
 The date and nature of Balbus military service is problematic, since both 
Domitian and Trajan conducted campaigns across the Danube. There are three 
indicators, however, which suggest that Balbus served under Trajan in at least one 
Dacian War. First, Balbus states that he abandoned his writing unexpectedly to join the 
emperor on his expedition to Dacia in search of military glory, suggesting that Balbus 
was swept up in a large scale effort to gather new recruits prior to hostilities.624 
Documentary evidence shows that Trajan formed two new legions prior to the second 
Dacian War, while Domitian only used existing legions pulled from the provinces of 
Moesia and Britannia.625 Second, Balbus states that his leave to write was granted only 
after the emperor had opened up Dacia, suggesting that the army had succeeded in 
conquering the entire territory incorporated into the Roman province by Trajan and 
Hadrian.626 Lastly, Balbus constructed his account of the war and his activities as a 
continuous travel narrative during which he first enters enemy territory by constructing 
a new road, crosses a river, and then conquers an enemy mountain stronghold before 
being allowed to return to the heart of the Empire.627 Such a travel narrative echoes the 
one surviving fragment of the De Bello Dacico, which shows that, for Trajan, travel 
played a major part in the chronicle of his campaigns: 
From there we then advanced to Berzobim, then on to Aizi.628 
The centrality of travel narratives in the historiography and propaganda associated 
with the Dacian Wars may also be reflected in the frieze on Trajans Column. At one 
time scholars such as Lino Rossi saw the frieze as showing episodic snapshots of the 
war, but more recent studies by scholars such as John Coulston have noted that the

presentation more nearly reflects a continuous narrative such as one might see or read 
by unfurling a scroll; suggesting that the freeze was derived from the emperors war 
commentary in order to generate political capital and shape Trajans image as a 
successful emperor in the minds of the public.629 Andrew Wallace-Hadrill, in a recent 
study of Vitruvius, has shown that technicians often engaged directly with the reigning 
emperors ideology to craft a place of importance for themselves as authorities who 
were crucial for the maintenance of Roman society.630 As soldier and surveyor seeking 
glory and a strong position within the society of surveyors, Balbus would have found it 
advantageous to craft the narrative portion of his work so that it was in dialogue with 
the emperors own published account. As a consequence, it is more than likely that 
Balbus served under Trajan and structured his account of servus in Dacia to 
complement the De Bello Dacico and Trajans Column. 
4.3 Balbus and the Shape of Empire 
Another feature crucial to understanding and interpreting the writings of Balbus as a 
source for the role of surveyors in Roman conquest is the authors world view. 
Following the sentence quoted at the start of this chapter, Balbus explains how he was 
expected to create a road to help the Roman army reach their objective. The road he 
describes and the introduction to it move through what might be termed chronological, 
tactical and strategic space.631 
Framed by Balbus statement that he had just entered enemy territory (at 
postquam primum hosticam terram intrauimus) and a declaration that he was 
allowed to return from the northernmost reaches once Dacia had been opened up 
(statim ut e septentrionali plaga annuauice transpire permisit), the Roman military 
assault road forms the core of a journey, which seemingly moves in a linear one-
dimensional fashion from the safe area inside the Roman Empire outward into hostile 
territory before returning once again to where it started.632 As the narrative progresses 
into the enemy landscape, the narrator uses the construct of the road to link and

dominate rivers and mountains, two key topographical features in ancient geography, in 
order to transform the territory of Dacia into a Roman province over the course of 
time.633 This transformative literary motif conjures up an image of the Empire as a finite 
part of the world, organised into compartmentalised provinces with delineated internal 
and external boundaries. They could be described mathematically, even as Vitruvius 
described the orders of architecture in terms of the geometric proportions of the human 
body, and Galen, in what may be an inversion of Strabos analogy of a geographer, 
subdividing the world in the manner of a surgeon amputating a human being, described 
the human body in terms of a geometrically defined world.634  
Passages from Herodotus, Aristotle and Aristophanes show that these ideas 
about linear travel and a geometrically structured world formed part of an intellectual 
panoply of congruent concepts of spatial perception. They ranged from an intuitive or 
deontological approach on the one hand, to a fully reasoned understanding of the world 
marked by maps on the other, centuries before the advent of the Roman Empire.635 By 
employing depictions of linear travel alongside geographic terms such as septentrionali 
or the northern reaches, Balbus could contextualise the immediate experience of travel 
within a global framework derived from Hellenistic geography as it was developed by 
Eratosthenes.636 More importantly, Balbus, like many other surveyors, used this 
construction of the world to demonstrate his own erudition while writing Roman 
surveying into a wider philosophical discourse even as he articulated the main purpose 
of his work:637 
Therefore, after the greatest of emperors through his recent victory, had 
opened up Dacia, he permitted me to leave the northern regions for a period 
of one year, and I returned to my studies as if I was returning to a period of 
leisure and I gathered up the many ideas almost written out on individual

leaves and scattered about so that I could incorporate them into the canon of 
our craft.638 
As discussed elsewhere in this work, much of this discourse, and indeed the 
surveyors canon of practice, involved the geometric construction of space and the 
development of maps, which reflected that construction.639 The ability to conceptualise 
the world in this way, as well as to construct or use the maps that went with it, 
represented learned skills beyond the reach of most people.640, As the previous two 
chapters have shown, however, these constructions of space and their depictions seem 
to have become increasingly prevalent as features defining the lives of various 
constituencies in the provinces, as well as their awareness of, and consensus about, the 
nature of Empire. Most people who travelled beyond their own home communities or 
who had extensive contact with the imperial administration seem to have recognised, 
although to varying degrees, the existence of limits to both provinces and the Empire 
itself, which functioned as adjustable zones of legal and military control.641 These 
people also seem to have recognised that movement between and the adjustment of 
these administrative zones depended upon roads, rivers and an exact knowledge of them 
derived from the surveyors craft.642 
4.4 Balbus, Trajan and the Roman Roads of War 
The road marked out by Balbus as a means of navigating both narrative and landscape 
forms the first of three exempla that demonstrate how surveyors structured tactical 
space on campaign, providing a unique window into Roman military operations: 
Two parallel straight lines with an established distance between them had to 
be provided for the roads, so that a dense mass of stakes would rise up along 
them as protection for the supply lines: the use of the ferramentum extended 
these parallel lines through your discovery (of a method) for the reduction 
of a section of the road works to a narrow point.643

It is difficult to understand exactly what Balbus is describing in this passage. 
Every scholar who has edited or translated this section of text, other than Brian 
Campbell, has omitted the end of the second half of the last clause so that they can 
interpret the passage as the description of a road leading into a fortified camp; although 
the syntax of the full sentence precludes this.644 Since no other Latin author mentions 
either a palisade or the use of survey lines to create a road as Balbus does, it is not really 
possible to interpret the text using other Latin descriptions of road construction.645 
Likewise, the subject of laying out Roman roads is not one that has been covered in 
most traditional works on the roads of the Empire such as those published by Raymond 
Chevallier or Ray Laurence.646 Only the experimental investigations into Roman road 
design carried out separately over the last fifteen years by John Poulter, Hugh Davies, 
and most importantly, Michael Lewis, have shed any light on this passage of Balbus. 
In 1998, Hugh Davies, in an attempt to explain how the Romans laid out their 
roads, argued that they first surveyed the line between two points then totalled the east-
west and north-south displacements established by the survey so as to gain the overall 
bearing.647 When topographical features on the ground prevented them from laying the 
road out in a straight line, Roman surveyors would first plan out the line of the road 
across the area that they had surveyed, as though on a map, and then measure out the 
line of the road on the ground by means of offsets at right angles to the survey lines 
(Fig. 4.1). Michael Lewis, doubting the practicality of this method, if for no other 
reason than a lack of evidence for Roman scaled maps like those Davies advocates, 
experimented with the instruments available to the Romans and argues that the roads 
were laid out using pure geometry.648 This method, which reflects observations made by 
Claudius Ptolemy on finding a direction relative to the meridian, depends on one fixed 
point, which is ideally elevated above the landscape, and is based on the geometry of 
similar triangles (Fig. 4.2):

Let us suppose the surveyor wants to stake out a direct route from A to B, 
which he knows lies roughly east of A, and his best guess is that it lies a 
little north of east. By extrapolation he projects a line AX in that direction, 
sighting from high-point to high-point. When it becomes clear that his line 
passes well north of B, he returns to A and projects two new alignments AY 
and AZ further to the south, designed to bracket B, and he stakes them out 
as he goes. Then, from B he projects two lines back on the reciprocal 
bearings until they intersect AY and AZ at C and D. The diagonal between 
C and D is measured, and the point E halfway along it is marked. Because 
ACE and BDE are identical triangles, as are ADE and BCE, AEB is a 
straight line. To fill in further points on this line, the same process can be 
repeated on a smaller scale or can be interpolated in the usual way, as the 
terrain directs.649 
There are problems with Lewiss reconstruction, particularly the issue of 
establishing directions without the benefit of a compass, but the work of two separate 
scholars has shown that Roman surveyors undoubtedly used some system of this sort to 
lay out roads. Lorenzo Quilici, investigating the Via Appia in Italy has noted that the 90 
km straight line that runs between Rome and Terracina is marked by only one 
significant point for back-sights at Colle Pardo near Ariccia, where the surveyors took a 
line from the Temple of Diana on the Aventine, some 23 km to the rear. The same high-
point was used to make a foresight to the seaward cliff of Leano, targeting the shrine of 
Lucus Feroniae, since the summit of the cliff blocks the view of Terracina, some 61 km 
to the south. As Quilici notes, the axis of these straight stretches was marked directly on 
the ground, establishing on site where the road had to pass, including the intermediate 
destinations, and the road deviated from the established alignment only to negotiate 
topographical features which the Roman construction crew could not either remove or 
otherwise bridge.650 
Working independently of Quilici, John Poulter also supports Lewiss theory 
through his investigation of alignments for Roman roads in the north of England. 
Poulter has shown that the road running between Tadcaster and the Dry Burn was laid 
out using a system of long-distance alignments sighted on prominent features found at 
high points in the landscape, which were visible from just over the brow of a hill. Many 
of the alignments cover a distance of more than 30 km; a distance Quilici also considers

normal for Roman alignments.651 Poulter also shows that the planning alignments were 
apparently created to establish the general line of a road without taking river crossings 
into consideration. When the road was actually built, all the deviations from the 
alignment were made on high ground to approach a river crossing, navigate around 
topographical features, or else, because the surveyors had made a mistake requiring 
correction.652 He has further argued that one can establish the direction of a survey by 
studying the lines of visibility at points where there is a change of direction. Since the 
landscape has changed considerably since Roman times, this argument seems somewhat 
speculative. Even so, Poulter and Quilici do seem to have shown that the Romans 
established long-distance alignments for their roads, which can be described using 
geometry. 
This use of geometry to create paths of movement, like other acts of surveying 
discussed in the previous chapters, represents an intellectual abstraction and 
transformation of the landscape formed by an embedded intersection between the 
theoretical principles of Euclidian geometry and the concrete reality of the world 
created by the lived experiences of surveyors.653 Put simply, it was the transformative 
actions of the surveyors, driven by the principles of Hellenistic mathematics and 
theoretical geography which structured the physical environment created by Roman 
conquest and occupation. 
In light of these philosophical and archaeological observations, it should perhaps 
not be a surprise that Balbus chose to focus on the application of geometry to surveying 
in his writings. In what Jean-Yves Guillaumin, Eric Bohlin and Courtney Roby have 
argued was direct engagement with the writings of Euclid and Hero of Alexandria, 
Balbus devotes a great deal of space in his work to the categories and functions of lines, 
angles and geometric shapes by juxtaposing abstract formulae against concrete 
examples from daily life to embed mathematical theory in the practical realities of the 
surveyors working world.654 This would tend to suggest that Balbus description of the 
narrowing of a wide section of the road works to a point using the ferramentum should

be considered a reference to the construction of the Roman roads into Dacian territory 
using the Euclidian principles of congruent right triangles. 
 While the works of Guillaumin, Roby, Lewis and Poulter show the theoretical 
interface between mathematics and surveying on the ground, explaining how surveyors 
laid out Roman roads, but identifying exactly what type of road Balbus was describing, 
they present a real challenge for archaeology. The roads which have been uncovered 
thus far tend to be formed by stone or earthen embankments, functioning as a curb line 
with side paths for foot traffic, a centre trench and a gravel, or gravel and stone, fill that 
acts as surfacing.655, Such roads, however, represent the built up infrastructure at the 
core of the Empire and do not seem to reflect what Balbus had in mind when he drafted 
his narrative. A panel from Trajans Column (Fig. 4.3), shows that classiarii or axmen, 
possibly drawn from the fleet, were deployed by the legions to clear a path through the 
trees in the densely wooded mountains of Dacia.656 They may have also been deployed 
in the same capacity in other similar situations such as the Danish peninsula or the 
mountains of Africa.657 Some of these pathways may have been little more than dirt 
tracks, but an inscription from Trentino-Alto Adige in northern Italy, dated to 46 AD, 
proves that many temporary lines of communication cut by surveyors during military 
campaigns could leave a lasting impression: 
Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, Chief Priest, (holding the) 
tribunician power for the 6th time, designated Consul for the 4th time, (hailed 
as) Emperor for the 11th time, Father of the Fatherland, paved the Via 
Claudia Augusta, which his father Drusus had driven through the Alps 
during the war to open them up, from the Po River to the Danube River, for 
a distance of 350 miles.658 
This inscription records how Claudius finished the military roads cut by the 
younger Drusus 33 years earlier. It shows that military roads were not paved and that in 
some cases they could retain their unpaved character for decades. More interestingly, 
when the text of this inscription is read with the text of Balbus quoted above, it becomes 
clear that Roman military campaign roads were composed of an unpaved central section

with shallow trenches on either side which were topped by high embankments studded 
with surveyors stakes to prevent the enemy from cutting the road as happened to Varrus 
during his march through Germany.659 In order to help civilian contractors supply the 
legions or transport booty back from the campaign as demonstrated by both archaeology 
and panels from Trajans Column, roads may have been provided with a partial 
surfacing of sand and pebbles by the soldiers in some instances.660 
Regardless of whether the roads were a simple dirt cutting or paved with sand and 
pebbles, such roads would leave very little trace in the landscape, unless someone like 
Claudius or Trajan undertook to provide a more substantial paving. Indeed, even when 
proper stone paving and milestones were provided, it can still be difficult to trace the 
course of the legions advance.661 This state of affairs is exemplified by the fact that 
modern scholars still cannot agree upon the exact route the Roman legions followed into 
Dacia, even though an inscribed milestone from Aiton (Fig. 4.4) shows that Trajan had 
the roads measured and paved immediately following hostilities.662 
4.5 Balbus, the Legions and a Bridge for Conquest 
Following on to his description of the Roman road into Dacia, Balbus, in the second of 
his three exempla, chronicles another key index of tactical movement for the Roman 
legions, the measurement of a ford used to cross a river:663 
Now as it pertains to the measurement of bridges, we were able to fix the 
width of rivers from the near bank even if the enemy wished to prevent us 
from doing so.664 
River crossings were dangerous. There were a finite number of places where the 
water was shallow enough to get across and many were only accessible at slack water, 
making it difficult to transport heavy baggage and artillery.665 To cope with the 
problem, the Romans may have used pre-existing bridges, since many other peoples

built them, although as Anne Dumont observes, few bridges predating the Roman 
imperial period have been found because of problems in preservation.666 Regardless of 
whether or not native bridges were available for use, the Roman army was equipped to 
create its own river-crossings and Balbus is clear about the tactical advantage surveying 
gave the Roman legions in such operations. As Serafina Cuomo observes, the principles 
of mathematics, transposed onto the reality of the landscape through the practice of 
surveying allowed the Romans to quantify and know the limits of the river, thereby 
restructuring the tactical space of a crossing and asserting control over it.667 
Balbus does not elaborate on the methods employed to acquire this knowledge, 
however, just as he does not provide details on the methods he used to survey the roads 
he constructed in Dacia. His brevity here is perhaps in part because such mathematical 
calculations were discussed in the body of his work and he only sought to provide a 
general practical example in his introduction.668 It is also doubtless, however, due to the 
fact that the methods used to calculate the width of a river were common mathematical 
exercises for those who studied the more advanced aspects of geometry. This point is 
illustrated by the fact that no fewer than three known authors discuss an early identical 
formula for calculating the width of a river: Hero of Alexandria, the second-century 
Roman surveyor Marcus Junius Nipsus and the third-century Christian author Julius 
Africanus.669 
Like the calculations for the layout of a road discussed above, the formula 
depended on the use of fixed points and the creation of right triangles drawn out as 
straight lines projected on to the ground using either the dioptra (Fig. 2.6) or the groma 
(Fig. 4.5).670 Once measurements were made with one of these instruments, a surveyor 
would have worked with others to build a bridge in much the same manner that Nonius 
Datus worked with auxiliary soldiers to dig the aqueduct tunnel at Saldae.671 As several 
sources show, architects, carpenters and mechanics are well attested in the Roman 
army.672 Unfortunately, there is not enough evidence to reconstruct the exact

relationship between these technicians, but the surveyors probably measured and 
assessed a site while architects and other related craftsmen took responsibility for the 
actual construction.673 In addition, based on a passage of Josephus discussed more fully 
below, labor for the survey and construction of roads, bridges, military encampments 
and related structures was probably formally organised into a hierarchy with a 
predesigned division of labor, which employed prefabricated plans similar to those used 
for the construction of Roman camps.674 If this was so, it would support Roger Ulrichs 
recent contention that constructing a wooden bridge would not have posed much of a 
challenge for the Romans, since axmen and carpenters could cut and shape timbers in 
the field so long as there was a readily available source of wood.675 
Documenting the results of this military bridge-building, depicted on Trajans 
column, is not easy, both because of the perishable nature of wood, and because as John 
Poulter has remarked, most temporary bridges were replaced with more permanent 
structures when the planning alignments for a road were consolidated in order to 
provide a permanent surfacing; an observation that marks the difference between a 
Roman incursion into foreign territory and the creation of a province.676 As indicated 
above, the creation of a province will be discussed more fully in the second half of the 
chapter. Here it is enough to recognise that two different types of wooden bridges can 
be identified from archaeological remains and the Column of Trajan. 
One type was the pontoon bridge constructed of boats lashed together (Fig. 4.6), 
which provided a temporary avenue of advance, securing Roman territory from easy 
attack from the far bank of a river.677 The second type was a more permanent single-
span bridge built on pilings, sunk into the riverbed to support a wooden frame with 
plank decking and open-work balustrades (Fig. 4.7).678 These timber bridges, though 
more modest than Trajans well-known stone edifice (Fig. 4.8), were nonetheless 
monuments of Roman power, which structured the landscape and conveyed specific 
political and cultural messages just as monumental statues, tombs and buildings did in

the heart of the Empire.679 Instead of negotiating a dialogue about status, power and 
standing within society, the wooden bridges probably, at least at first, induced a sense of 
violation and domination similar to that which Gwyn Davies has ascribed to siege 
works.680 
4.6 Balbus and the Victory of Mathematics in Siege Warfare 
In his third and final exemplum of military surveying, Balbus, in one of the rare 
passages that mention levelling in the Corpus Agrimensorum, states that exact 
topographical knowledge and the surveyors divinely inspired ability to obtain it were 
essential for the Romans to transform the tactical space of a battle field and achieve 
success in war: 
Then, with the blessing of the gods, that science showed us a way for us to 
work out the height of mountains that needed to be stormed.681 
While this passage reaffirms the idea that Roman conquest depended upon 
topographical knowledge based on quantifiable data, and buttresses the opinions of Kate 
Gilliver and other experts about the importance of surveyors in a siege, it is even less 
informative about the surveyors activities than the previous two passages.682 
Fortunately, Josh Levithan in his recent study of siege warfare has developed a method 
for discussing the Roman siege, which can be termed the siege progression. Levithan 
describes the progression as being like a set of ratcheting gears whose tension increases 
with every turn until the pressure is released like a spring through the storming of the 
city.683 This highly mechanical analogy provides the clearest expression of a system for 
looking at the role of surveyors in siege craft, since Levithans progression breaks a 
siege down into a series of phases where the surveyors craft can be identified.

1) Stage One: The threat of destruction. 
During the first and second stages of Levithans progression, the army approached its 
target city, made a demonstration of its strength, intended to intimidate the defenders 
into surrender, and launched a probing assault to test the defences.684 During these 
preliminary manoeuvres the only point at which a commander might have employed 
surveyors seems to have been in the layout and construction of field camps from which 
operations could be conducted.685 A series of four texts link the surveyors to this task, 
both in the context of the siege and as part of general military field operations. In a 
frequently quoted passage of the De munitionibus castrorum, Hyginus states: 
In the entrance way to the middle section of the Praetorian is the spot called 
The Place of the surveyors cross (locus gromae), either because a crowd 
congregates at that spot or else because, in accord with the established rule 
for taking measurements, the surveying cross (groma) is set up at the top of 
an iron pole (ferramentum) on the very same spot so that the gates of the 
camp make a star in accord with the sighting lines. And the masters of this 
art are specifically called land surveyors (gromatici) for the reason 
explained above.686 
The idea that surveyors created the camp from a central point fixed by the groma 
is supported by an inscription dated to the reign of Gallienus found at Lambaesis, which 
identifies the monumental courtyard, or forum area, in front of the praetorian as the 
groma; a designation which may indicate that the groma had fallen out of use as a 
surveying instrument.687 Further support comes from a passage in the Corpus 
Agrimensorum where the author ties the creation of the ideal Roman colony to the 
creation of a Roman military encampment by explaining that both should be created 
using the same geometric method to generate a grid from two interlocking streets.688 
While only a few examples of colonies, such as Colchester, developed from a military 
encampment and many colonies were never fortified, the author of this passage 
generated a philosophical continuum in which the first could evolve from the second in

much the same way as the temporary roads considered above gave rise to permanent 
imperial highways.689  
The contention seems to be predicated on two points which are important for this 
study. The first is the rhetorical argument which existed at least from the time of Cicero 
in which the martial character of the colonies contributed man-power to the Roman 
legions while providing a bulwark in defence of the Roman heartland.690 Secondly, and 
perhaps most importantly, there is the fact that the organisation of space and its use in 
both the colony and camp was articulated along mathematical lines using a plan or map. 
As has already been discussed in the course of this study, land attached to a colony and 
its ownership was articulated both publicly and privately through the creation of a forma 
or ground plan, which rendered space graphically using a measured grid.691 In a similar 
vein, Vegetius in two separate passages informs us that the surveyors were responsible 
for providing living quarters for the troops by designing an encampment using geometry 
and a podismus or predesignated ground plan.692 
The exact nature of this document remains the subject of debate, but two recent 
assessments by Alexander Richardson and Brian Dobson suggest that it was a document 
containing precepts based on mathematics, probably Euclidian, geometry and a table of 
square roots, which could be used to enclose an area of land within a temporary 
rampart.693 Evidence from the De munitionibus castrorum suggests both that there were 
a variety of methods for laying out a camp and that each podismus, like an architects or 
surveyors forma, was crafted for a specific situation using a mixture of text and 
graphics to help surveyors apply their information in the field.694 There does seem to 
have been a distinction, however, between the composition and function of these 
documents, which the Romans themselves may not have always recognised. The 
podismus and architects forma seem to have guided the introduction of man-made

features, while the surveyors forma, like the forma sensualis, principally recorded 
features of the landscape as part of the discourse over ownership and control.695 
Interpreting the actual application of a podismus to the construction of siege 
camps and other structures, like the interpretation of the surviving surveyors formae, is 
problematic. Both Brian Dobson and Rebecca Jones have observed that while the 
remains of internal features unearthed at sites such as Numantia, Masada, Inchtuthil and 
Kintore can match the descriptions provided by the classical sources, more often than 
not they tend to diverge wildly from what modern scholars consider to be the theoretical 
model of camp design.696 This may not be the problem that scholars sometimes make it 
out to be, however, since a close reading of the text suggests that the author was 
primarily interested in providing a theoretical ideal rather than strict practical 
proscriptions, and only provides suggestions for how to organise individual sections of a 
camp depending upon the presence or absence of a specific type of unit.697 If this 
interpretation is correct, then it was not so much the structure of the camp itself which 
posed a threat at the start of a siege, but rather the act of surveying and entrenchment 
which transformed the tactical space around a city and functioned as an assertion of 
control. 
2) Stage Two: Lines of Circumvallation and Isolation. 
When a city held out against the threat provided by the camps and the commanders 
initial probing attack, then the siege would launch the third phase of Levithans 
progression. In this phase, the camps constructed for housing the army would be 
extended with straight lines connecting fixed points in the landscape to form a series of 
trenches, walls, artillery emplacements, and watch towers.698 These fortifications, which 
incorporated many of the elements described as boundary markers by Siculus Flaccus, 
functioned as an inversion of the normal civic boundary line of territorial integrity,

stripping a community of its independent identity by transforming a familiar extramural 
area into a hostile and forbidding landscape.699 
To maximise the intimidation factor in this line of circumvallation, as Gwyn 
Davies has argued, the Romans sometimes over-engineered their lines of envelopment 
in order to articulate a clear message of power and control.700 By creating lines of 
circumvallation that interacted with and dominated the landscape, such as those at 
Masada, the Roman surveyors, as Davies has argued, could create a hardened boundary 
to isolate the enemy and induce feelings of despair which would contribute to a quick 
victory.701 
3) Stage Three: The Engineered Assault. 
During the final stages of the siege progression, when the Roman commander 
concentrated all his efforts on the forcible reduction of a city rather than its capitulation, 
the surveyors craft came into its own assessing physical features for the construction of 
mines and siege ramps. The inscription set up by Nonius Datus at Lambaesis shows that 
levelling surveyors were versed in assessing mountain heights and possessed the 
necessary managerial skills to direct the labor force involved in creating mines and 
tunnels through them.702 However, the Romans considered mining to be a dangerous 
and unreliable method of storming a fortress and employed it only as a last resort.703 
Their primary method of attack was to go over the wall using an agger or siege 
ramp.704 However, the construction of siege ramps was a complicated matter, since, as 
Gwyn Davies has remarked, in order for a ramp to be effective it has to have just the 
right gradient across the available open space so that engines can be winched up, while 
being just the right height to allow men to storm the enemys fortifications.705 Equally, 
if the ramp was constructed too close to the wall, falling masonry could clutter up the

path of the assault force even as it crushed rams and the men working them. Assessing 
the best site and line for such a ramp required a good eye for terrain, as well as 
mathematical know-how. It also represented a direct conflict of authority with the 
military commander directing operations, since classical texts make it clear that the 
choice of where and how to attack were exclusively the prerogative of the general.706 
In this respect, the design of a siege ramp was likely to be a situation similar to 
the creation of a boundary line during a dispute or the creation of an aqueduct like the 
one at Saldae. Surveyors had to publicly demonstrate deference to their military 
superior while making sure that the general recognised the surveyors superior technical 
abilities; an exercise requiring all the rhetorical skill discussed in Chapter Two above. 
It is difficult to assess the extent to which plans similar to those used in the 
construction of the camp may have influenced the surveyors discourse with his 
commanding officer, or the extent to which they may have structured the design of siege 
ramps, since the only reference to such theoretical documents are the passages in Hero 
which provide the formula for assessing height and the raising of a mound, and the 
plans drafted by the military leveller Datus for the construction of the aqueduct at 
Saldae.707, Recent experiments using a reconstructed dioptra to assess the height of a 
wall, however, have shown that the system of right triangles described by Hero, and 
which may have been discussed by Balbus too for establishing both distance to and 
elevation of a city wall, were accurate at the remarkable distance of up to three hundred 
meters.708 By contrast, Heros rather vague formula for calculating the dimensions of 
the mound itself, seem to have involved the use of interlocking equal parallelograms 
and the creation of vertical arcs from right triangles: 
Let the site be  and its centre be E. Through E lay out with the dioptra 
as many lines as you like, such as A, ,  and , and plant vertical 
stakes along them. Our instructions for one line apply to all the rest. Plant 
 with stakes at , , ,  and . Set the disc of the dioptra 
vertical, with  corresponding to the segment of the mound. Stand a rod 
, in the same way [as described in chapter 17 of Heros work] so that the 
lines of sight from  to  and  coincide when projected with  and .

on the stakes. These points lie on the segment of the curve. Plant stakes on 
the other lines, sight on them and, when the stakes have been marked, 
mound the site up to the marks. The mounding will correspond to the 
segment of the sphere.709 
Several papyrological documents along with passages from the Corpus 
Agrimensorum and their Medieval illustrations, show that the creation of circles from 
squares was frequently carried out by surveyors when calculating the area of an 
irregular plot of land, and it may have even been a common classroom activity for those 
doing more advanced mathematical studies.710 In addition, a section of Balbus work 
that has yet to be fully edited, deals with the creation of rectangular figures from two or 
more interlocking circles.711 It is important to note that none of these examples involve 
the creation of an arc from a right triangle in the context of constructing a vertical 
surface, but given Balbus reference to the calculation of mountain heights in his 
introduction, it is likely that the lost portion of his text included a discussion of this 
topic and the mathematical formulae involved. 
Unfortunately, the only surviving examples of siege ramps against which one 
can study the theoretical model set out in the text come from the sieges at Avericum (50 
BC), Machaerus (72 AD), Masada (74 AD), Sarmizegethusa (106 AD), Cremna (third 
century) and Dura Europos (256 AD). While mathematical calculations are evident in 
all of these examples, there is so much variation in the gradient of each, with the 
shallowest rising one meter in seven and the steepest rising one meter in three, that a 
unifying algorithm for calculating construction is hard to find.712 This problem, like the 
problems in finding the podismus in the Roman camps discussed above, is probably a 
result of a limited sample and the need to accommodate the local topography during 
building. 
Even so, each agger was built with one of two basic methods. They were either 
composed of compacted earth and stone using a dump-fill method or else a wooden 
frame was built with hurtles to contain spoil in what might be termed a box-construction

method depending on the available materials.713 The danger and backbreaking labor 
involved in constructing such ramps, and in conducting a siege in general, leads me to 
agree with Josh Levithan when he argues that the Romans preferred to engage an enemy 
openly on the field of battle rather than through a siege.714 A siege represented an 
extreme effort at subjugating the inhabited landscape through applied geometry and 
brute force in ways that went far beyond the construction of roads and bridges. The 
Romans only undertook such a dramatic and violent transformation of both the 
topographical and human landscape when the inhabitants refused to diplomatically 
recognise the might of Rome and yet resisted Roman domination without fighting 
openly on the field of battle.715 
The implicit knowledge gap between the theoretical concepts, found in literary 
texts and the engineering works that made such a transformation possible, reflects both 
Roman administrators need for technically competent subordinates and the 
expectations placed on those experts by technical authors.716 Technical literature such as 
the Corpus Agrimensorum and the writings of Hero were unquestionably intellectual 
documents intended to entertain and enlighten any well-educated reader, but technicians 
were also clearly expected to be able to bridge the gap between the theoretical concepts 
of the texts and their practical application to a specific situation through hands-on 
experience.717 Since it is very unlikely that the majority of even well-educated 
individuals in antiquity possessed the prerequisite experience and mental organisation to 
create siege works from the textual examples known, it is worth considering just how 
common it was for a Roman army to have surveyors on hand who might possess this 
sort of knowledge. 
Such consideration is even more important when examining the text of Balbus, 
since Floran Fodorean has recently suggested that Trajan placed Balbus in charge of all 
engineering works in Dacia as a prominent member of the Praetorian Guard.718 In order 
to do this, however, and in order to further assess the impact of surveying operations on

necessary to leave the text of Balbus behind and consider other avenues of evidence. 
4.7 Mensores Militum: Surveyors in the Roman Army 
While the text of Balbus shows the surveyors ability to restructure the landscape while 
on campaign, it does not indicate how many men were involved or their place within the 
Roman legions. The speed and success with which Roman surveyors could transform 
the landscape, both at the tactical level of an army on campaign, and at the strategic 
level when organising a province, depended upon the number of surveyors and 
surveying assistants available and their position within the Roman army. It is only a 
passage of Josephus that provides a vivid picture of how the Romans organised 
manpower to modify or otherwise cut roads during a military campaign. In the third 
book of the Bello Iudaico, Josephus narrates the march of Vespasian from Ptolemais to 
Gabara and then on to Jotapata by first stating: 
Vespasian, eager to invade Galilee himself, set out from Ptolemais after 
drawing up the army in the accustomed Roman marching order. He ordered 
the auxiliary lightly-armed troops and the archers to go in advance, so that 
they might both prevent any sudden attacks by the enemy and investigate 
woodlands that were suspicious on account of their suitability for an 
ambush. And next, followed a body of heavily-armed Roman soldiers, both 
infantry and cavalry. After these troops marched ten men from each century 
carrying their own equipment and the implements for marking out the camp. 
And after these came the engineers who were to straighten bends in the 
road, level rough areas, and cut down woodland which was blocking the 
way, so that the army would not be exhausted by a difficult march.719 
This description of a Roman marching column closely reflects the organisational 
principles for road construction discussed above, and while Josephus does not 
specifically mention the surveyors, the ten men he states were selected from each 
century to go in advance with the tools for marking out the camp were probably the 
metatores or camp technicians who Frontinus, Vegetius and the author of the De 
munitionibus castrorum describe as being responsible for selecting and laying out a 
camp site under the direction of the surveyors.720

According to Robert Sherks interpretation of the available evidence, each legion 
possessed eleven surveyors, with two surveyors serving in the first cohort, which was of 
double strength, and one surveyor in each of the other nine.721 He further argued that 
each of the nine praetorian cohorts also had its own surveyor, providing the emperor 
with independent technical support. As Brian Campbell has pointed out, however, the 
inscriptions Sherk used for his reconstruction date to the third century AD and reflect 
specific moments in the history of two particular legions, which may not reflect the 
situation at other times and places.722 Campbells own assessment, based mostly on a 
reading of the monument set up by Nonius Datus, was that surveyors were quite rare 
with many legions and imperial administrators not having access to any at all. 
In both of these interpretations, the fundamental problem is a lack of qualification. 
As was pointed out in an earlier chapter of this study, there were four subdivisions of 
the surveyors recorded in the epigraphic record, and three of them are attested in both 
Praetorian and legionary cohorts: the land surveyor or agrimensor, the levelling 
surveyor or librator, and the cartographic surveyor or chorographiarii.723 In keeping 
with the general demographic trends outlined in the second chapter, the land surveyor 
seems to have outnumbered the other two groups in the Roman army. However, four 
factors make assessing the number of surveyors in the Roman army in absolute terms all 
but impossible. First, a strict formal system of self-identification does not seem to have 
ever been introduced for the surveyor in the Roman army. While some surveyors took 
pride in identifying themselves as a mensor librator, for example, most simply styled 
themselves as mensor without specifying their technical competency. In addition, even 
when surveyors identified themselves by technical competency, the abbreviations they 
used were ambiguous and can be confused with other occupations. This is particularly 
true of the librator, since the abbreviation lib. could also stand for the Latin word 
librarius, unless prefixed by the notation men meaning mensor.724 
Third, quantifying the number of surveyors present in the Roman army is 
complicated by the fact that mensores seem to have been introduced to auxiliary cohorts 
of citizen soldiers beginning in the last quarter of the first century, and in peregrine

cohorts before the end of the second.725 At the very least, surveyors and their 
apprentices were present in Cohors XX Palmyrenorum at Dura Europos in 239 AD, 
where archaeology shows their proficiency in both strengthening the citys defences and 
later in countering the Persian siege mines.726 Since documentation for most auxiliary 
units is only partial at best, it is impossible to say just how many of these units had 
surveyors, and when. 
But the most significant problem in establishing the presence of surveyors in the 
Roman army is simply the fact that not all surveyors identified themselves as such. 
Contrary to the views of Michael Speidel, surveyors, who served in the legions as 
immunes, seem to have used their position and their specialised skills to earn 
advancement to the rank of optio or centurion, at which point they identified themselves 
by rank rather than by occupation.727 This means that many men who were practicing 
surveyors cannot be conveniently identified as such in the epigraphic record, unless 
there are clear indicators in the document to show that the optio or centurion was 
carrying out the tasks of a surveyor. Interestingly enough, people outside the legions 
seem to have understood and followed this practice of identification as well. 
Seneca when describing Neros expedition to explore all of Ethiopia, states that 
the emperor sent just two centurions from the Praetorian Guard to carry out the 
investigation.728 Presuming that Nero only sent one expedition, these centurions would 
have been the surveyors who produced a forma showing the rout taken by the Praetorian 
expeditionary force mentioned by Pliny the Elder.729 Senecas depiction of the journey, 
as undertaken by just two surveyors, may reflect his ambivalent feelings about 
imperialism and exploration beyond the accepted bounds of the inhabited world, but it 
also probably reflects the true state of most surveying operations in which a finite 
number of technical experts were available to accomplish a great deal.730

In general terms, while it is impossible to quantify the exact number of 
surveyors serving at any given time, the number unquestionably increased steadily from 
the late first to the early third century AD so that by the death of Alexander Severus 
they were serving in nearly every branch of the Roman military. At the same time, the 
overall percentage of serving soldiers who were surveyors remained comparatively 
small. This means that, while it was possible for Balbus to have been part of the 
Praetorian Guard, this was not necessarily so, since an active member of such a small 
group could call himself to the attention of his military superiors by demonstrating 
outstanding ability regardless of his position. Indeed, the only direct evidence for 
Balbus position as part of the Praetorians comes from the fact that he was granted a 
years leave to write a book on surveying and his insinuation in the narrative portion of 
his introduction that his services to the emperor played a significant role in the 
collection of geographic information used in the incorporation of Dacia as a province of 
the Empire. 
4.8 Paths of Knowledge: Facing the Unknown 
Assuming that Balbus was being truthful in asserting that the surveyors, with their 
understanding of Hellenistic geography, were the principal source for the collection of 
quantifiable information on the location of people and places, the Romans had to carry 
out their geographic investigations with a limited body of men using the methods 
outlined above. This introduces two problems. First, there is the problem introduced by 
N. J. E. Austin concerning the surveyors ability to collect enough information to 
establish a viable geographic understanding of a region from a single line of advance, 
such as the road and river-crossings described by Balbus.731 
To borrow an observation from the writings of the British anthropologist Tim 
Ingold, roads created as straight lines in this fashion represent a series of points 
connected as a network of destinations.732 Such a connected line does not constitute a 
base for a two-dimensional understanding of the landscape unless it is used as a base-
line from which surveyors and their assistants investigated the landscape. Put simply, 
the Romans had to have a system for distributing the limited number of surveyors and

surveying assistants available to an army over a field of operations greater than that 
occupied by a single column of march without subjecting them to danger. Such a task 
also had to be accomplished in such a manner that the quantifiable data they collected 
and the control it represented could, and would, be meaningful for the direct 
exploitation of an entire region and its population centres. 
Secondly, surveyors, regardless of how much land they investigated, had to be 
able to find their way to and through the places being surveyed. Within the Empire, as 
noted elsewhere, those who needed to find a destination in the pre-modern world, were 
confined to consulting a written itinerary when planning their journeys and were 
obliged to ask members of the local population for directions on route when those 
itineraries failed to provide the information needed.733 But, as Caesars account of his 
first expedition to Britain shows, itineraries were not always available and information 
gathered from foreign envoys and local merchants could prove insufficient for 
establishing a tactical line of advance.734 Therefore, Roman scouts and surveyors, when 
creating a network of paths and roads in a new territory, like many native hunters 
seeking game in the wilderness, had to interact with the landscape in order to create the 
connecting line of the itinerary and find its destinations for the first time.735 
4.9 Paths of Knowledge: The Sufferings of a Guide 
One effective method for supplementing knowledge found on an itinerary, as well as for 
navigating through otherwise unknown terrain, both inside the Empire and out, was to 
acquire the services of a local guide.736 While employing a guide meant that travellers 
were dependent upon the good-will of an outside person who could become lost himself 
or lead them into an ambush, the accounts of Neros expedition to Ethiopia clearly show 
their value, since the praetorian soldiers acquired and employed the services of 
knowledgeable locals from the king of Ethiopia.737

According to Pliny, the Praetorian cohort sent on the expedition was able to 
travel nine hundred and eighty five miles past Cyrene at the southern border of the 
Empire, record the distances between major cities along the main line of advance and 
even produce a forma of some sort.738 While Pliny provides a wealth of information, 
what he included in his discussion on the geography of Ethiopia was probably only a 
fraction of what the forma contained and it is not really possible to reconstruct what the 
document looked like. This is demonstrated by the fact that the distances Pliny reports 
are far too great for anyone to have covered in a single day. This means that regardless 
of how the local guides conducted the Roman expeditionary force, there were 
intervening stages and changes in direction in the journey between the named urban 
nodes of the itinerary, which Pliny does not discuss. 
Pliny states that the main purpose of the expedition was to carry out a 
reconnaissance for future conquest, and it is very possible that Nero was principally 
interested in locating the source of gold and ebony that tradition said existed south of 
the first Nile cataract.739 If this was the case, then it is quite possible that the Praetorian 
expeditionary force and their guides had orders to investigate the landscape away from 
the Nile River in spite of the harsh climate in order to locate places where natural 
resources such as those found in the western desert of Egypt might be obtained.740 Such 
orders might seem implausible, but since the Roman army had access to local guides, 
dromedaries and surveyors, it was theoretically possible for the Praetorian tribune in 
command of the expedition to hold the main body of his force in a temporary camp on 
the banks of the river and, in a manner similar to Agricolas exploration of Scotland, 
dispatch a small surveying party, led by guides, out into the desert to investigate 
matters.741 In this context, it is worth noting here that pits excavated in marching camps 
from Scotland show that such temporary camps could be maintained for up to five 
weeks, and a small group of scouts and surveyors carrying food and water on pack 
animals could, with the help of a local guide, ride in a wide circle gathering a 
considerable quantity of information during such a period.742

4.10 Paths of Knowledge: Following the Signs 
When operating away from well-marked pre-existing travel routes, both local guides 
and Roman surveyors would have been dependent upon landmarks, astronomical 
observations and dead-reckoning to work out where they wanted to go and the best way 
back.743 This would prove particularly true if they expected to lead others back along 
the same path or create a road for others to follow later. Recently, Martin Thiering has 
contended that navigation of this sort involved mental modes of implicit knowledge, 
which functioned as a dynamic, deductive problem-solving process based upon the 
observation, memory and cognitive reconstruction of specific structural clues within the 
landscape.744 In a world devoid of navigational tools such as the gyro-compass, such 
problem-solving abilities would have been crucial for anyone seeking to know and 
transform the landscape on both the tactical and strategic levels described by Balbus and 
Pliny the Elder, as they provide the only means of navigating through the wider world. 
Within this cognitive system, all orientation and directional determinations 
depend on three points of reference: internal, external and the purely theoretical. 
Internal points of reference involve the articulation of distance measurements in terms 
of the travellers own body using the finger, palm, forearm and foot to approximate size 
in a world without exact, standardised units of measurement.745 In addition, without the 
absolute source of direction provided by the compass, travellers need to establish 
directional indicators based on human syntax, such as when a given object is described 
as being on the right or left hand or, more remotely, by referencing a person or object as 
being near to a point which is fixed relative to the travellers own position and point of 
view.746 
External points of reference are formed in the mind of an individual traveller 
through the experience of sensations that start outside the individual and are taken in 
through the sensory extensions of the nervous system via the eyes, ears, nose and 
skin.747 Where travel and movement are concerned, these external features include

obvious topographical landmarks such as rocks, rivers, mountains, sun and stars, as well 
as a broader range of phenomena such as plant and animal life, wind, rainfall, 
temperature, humidity and the like.748 All of these external features function as either 
visual land marks that are fixed and easy to remember or as cognitive markers, which 
can be considered as things whose presence or absence along with the degree to which 
they are present or absent signal a persons location.749 
 The cognitive or purely theoretical frame of reference is formed by an abstract 
set of understandings, which allow travellers to extrapolate where they are based on 
known features which are not immediately experienced. A key part of this process is the 
recognition that one can establish the distance between two unseen places using the 
movement of a person by measuring the amount of time, usually in relative terms such 
as days that it takes to go from one place to another.750 The movement involved in such 
calculations is understood strictly in one dimension. A second dimension can be added, 
however, through the use of known lateral relationships established between two or 
more objects and/or places which an individual passes by, or between, in the course of 
travel.751 In order to make this two dimensional frame of reference function when 
navigating incommensurable distances, such as those involved in crossing large open 
bodies of water or the vast waste of the desert, it is necessary to develop a systematic 
study of the stars and a fixed conceptual or imaginary point of reference. Astronomical 
observations of specific stars or constellations can be used to establish orientation and 
track the rate of movement, while fixed imaginary points of reference such as the 
phantom island used by Micronesian navigators in the south Pacific, can be memorised 
against any number of known star groups and locations to provide a permanent point of 
orientation.752 
4.11 Paths of Knowledge: Instruments Knowing the Landscape 
While these three points of reference are theoretically enough to allow one to navigate 
through any known or unknown landscape, Hellenistic philosophers added another

factor to the human understanding of the terrestrial world by introducing the dioptra and 
portable sundial. The dioptra, mentioned above as an instrument for surveying rivers 
and military fortifications, could also be set up on a tripod in a vertical posture in order 
to measure the angle between two stars on the same meridian.753 This knowledge could 
be used to establish ones position along a horizontal axis in a crude approximation of 
the modern concept of longitude. 
By contrast, the portable sundial as described by Vitruvius, if designed the right 
way, could be used to establish ones latitude.754 Derek de Solla Price, using what some 
consider to be a contentious system of nomenclature, has identified three distinct types 
of portable dial, all of which he believes were in use by the beginning of the second 
century AD.755 The first type, which he refers to as viatoria pensilia (Fig. 4.9), was 
portable but calibrated to work at only one specific latitude, making it useless for 
surveying or navigational purposes, since one had to know the latitude one was at in 
order to make the instrument function properly.756 A second type (Fig. 4.10), which de 
Solla Price refers to as the pros pan clima, provides compass-like orientations as well as 
the time, based on shadow lengths, measured from a gnomon positioned on a curved 
plate.757 A third and incredibly complicated type of dial (Fig. 4.11), which de Solla 
Price identifies as pros ta historumena, consists of a series of interchangeable plates that 
could be slotted into a housing with an aperture through which sunlight could pass. 
Each of the disks seems to have been marked out with lines that allowed the user to 
measure time at different latitudes.758 
In strict terms, while this third type of dial may have been useful to those who 
travelled, only the second was truly useful while one was traveling, and it is interesting 
to note that many examples of the second type of dial were calibrated for different 
latitudes, using the names of Roman provinces as a reference system, showing that 
people thought about the provinces as places and structured their understanding of the 
world accordingly.759 This is an important point, since such a system of conceptualising

the world entails a system of construction, which shapes the identity of each province in 
strictly quantifiable terms. It also suggests that Roman surveyors had the tools and 
methodology to quantify the boundaries as well as internal structures of each province 
and organised those quantified structures in relationship to one another. 
4.12 Paths of Knowledge: Roads of Change 
A monument that also articulates an understanding of the world in terms of Roman 
provincial organisation, is the Stadiasmus Patarensis (Fig. 4.12). Set up in the harbour 
of Patara by the Lycians in 46 AD, this rectangular monument articulates a clear 
connection between surveying at the tactical level and the creation of a provinces 
topographical identity by honouring Claudius as ruler of the world and prising him for 
building roads throughout Lycia.760 
Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, son of Drusus, emperor of 
the oikomene, built roads through the entirety of Lycia with the services of 
the pro praetorian legate Quintus Verranius, the distance of which is written 
out below.761 
On the two sides flanking this inscription (Fig. 4.13), are the sixty-five stages 
forming an itinerary or list of roads and destinations. Modern maps reconstructing the 
text of the itinerary (Fig. 4.14) show that the monument assumes the Roman provincial 
capital of Patara as the prime point of orientation and reference for the information 
presented in the lists. More importantly, as Benet Salway has remarked, the monument 
describes the road network of the province and its cities from west to east, using six 
relevant topographical groupings containing thirty separate itineraries rather than a 
straightforward linear progression.762 This means that the authors of the text on the 
Patara monument structured their presentation of information in terms of several key 
geographic nodes, which collect cities and routes into discrete groups, rather than 
presenting them as a simple list that progresses from A to B to C. An example of this 
can be seen at the start of the text where Patara and Zanthos form the key nodes in the

route which goes from Patara to Xanthos to Sidyma to Kalabantia before reverting back 
to Xanthos to describe a route to Pinara.763 
As a series of recent archaeological investigations has shown, the majority of 
routes found in the itinerary were formed by short distance alignments defined by the 
mountainous topography of Lycia, which were all measured by surveyors under the 
direction of the legate Verranius using Roman miles that were then translated into 
Greek stadia for the convenience of the provincial population.764 The presence of key 
nodes in the network and the nature of the distances presented suggest that Roman 
surveyors and their support staff used specific cities as central nodes or clearing houses 
for the collection of information on local topography, routes and settlements.765 Once 
the data were collected, they were then gathered into a coherent structure that 
represented Lycia as a topographical compartment containing a group of cities that 
could be put into context with other similarly organised provincial groupings. 
As recent work done on the organisation of colonies and the transportation 
infrastructure of Roman Hispania, Dacia and Britannia have shown, the pattern of 
nodes and routes, forming the final structure of the itinerary on the Patara monument 
was not unique to that province. Several studies of the placement of Roman colonies in 
Spain show that they were located at central strategic points in the regional road 
network, where they served as central administrative centres in the formation of the 
provincial conventus or administrative districts.766 Similarly, Florin Fodorean, in his 
reconstruction of the Dacian landscape, has shown that there were at least nine major 
routes forming the Roman imperial road network, with each focused upon one or more 
key administrative centres, and that the distance measurements used to create the roads 
were all derived from Roman military travel patterns.767

photographs taken over much of Scotland and Germany show how Roman temporary

camps dotting the landscape, although oriented using rivers, river valleys and mountain 
passes without any surviving roads to connect them, nonetheless form corridors of 
advance which structure the landscape. A map showing the location of temporary camps 
in England and Scotland (Fig. 4.15) shows how many of these lines of encampment 
intersect with Roman roads to converge on centralised transit nodes similar to those 
found in the Stadiasmus Patarensis, discussed above.768 
Sites in Wessex and Shropshire demonstrate that the Romans did not always 
create new roads, but frequently incorporated local roads into their surveys, even as they 
used pre-existing settlement sites to establish military fortifications and colonial 
settlements.769 By way of example, during a rescue excavation carried out by Tim 
Malim and Laurence Hayes at Sharpstone Hill near the village of Bayston Hill, six km 
north-west of Worcester in 2009, excavators uncovered three layers of cambered road, 
which intersected an iron-age track-way servicing a line of hillforts. The second road 
leading to the hillforts seems to have gone out of use at the start of the Roman 
occupation. However, the cambered road, which was built in the Roman fashion, even 
though all of its strata were laid down well before the Claudian invasion, formed part of 
the Roman advance into western Wales and continued to be developed with new 
municipal features such as mansiones and mutationes well into late antiquity.770 
In contrast to this, at Knighton Hill above Bishopstone in Wessex, on route from 
Sorviodunum (old Sarum), a Roman settlement established near an iron-age hillfort, 
Roman surveyors, in laying out what is known as the Ackling Dyke, crossed the iron-
age track-way known as the Ox Drove ridgeway in order to avoid the heads of two 
combs. In doing so, they merged the line of the Roman road with that of the older track 
for more than a kilometre before breaking off to follow an alignment across the Ebble 
River at Stratford Tony, on route to the settlement at Badbury.771 
At another site, a little north of this, on Pertwood Down in the Wiltshire Downs, 
an aerial photograph taken in 1924 (Fig. 4.16) shows how Roman surveyors, in order to

change in alignment, as O. S. G. Crawford pointed out in 1928, caused the Roman 
surveyors to follow the line of the ridge, paralleling what is termed a double-lynched 
way.773 This iron-age track-way was laid down running south-west to north-east in 
order to access a series of fields under cultivation. The Roman surveyors were quite 
happy to follow this line until they wished to push their road west, at which point they 
broke away from, and cut through, the line of the older track in order to carry their route 
to the Mendips and possibly further on to the Bristol Channel. 
Whether the Romans constructed this route with or without the assistance of the 
local land-holders, their adoption of the older road to their own needs initiated a 
complex range of changes in local settlement practices and travel patterns. The forcible 
introduction of those changes was not inconsequential, since the limited availability of 
military surveyors frequently meant that the completion of road construction and the 
reorganisation of agricultural land would be left to the local land holders, who could 
expect help from the Roman emperors personal staff only in exceptional situations.774 
4.13 The Provinces Form and the Forma Provinciae 
With the myriad of small track-ways and side roads that crossed the Empire, one might 
legitimately question how much information on sites such as the one at Pertwood Down 
filtered up to the imperial administration at Rome. However, there were two features 
that clearly shaped the understanding of imperial administrators at the strategic level 
and local land-holders alike. On the one hand, there was the zeal and ability of the 
surveyors to structure the local landscape while taking careful notes as members of the 
wider imperial community.775 On the other hand, there was the imperial 
administrations need to structure space on a grand scale through the creation of 
provincial boundaries as much as inter-regional roads to connect and partition the 
territory under its control.

As a series of inscriptions from Africa shows, Roman magistrates worked to 
create provincial boundaries through formal agreements and fixed topographical 
features, which could be measured and incorporated into a formal survey much as was 
done for the creation of private or municipal holdings.776 
By the authority of Vespasian Caesar Augustus, Father of the Fatherland, 
the boundaries of the province, both new and old, were set in order, which 
was accomplished at the Royal Canal by Rutilius Gallicus the Consul and 
Priest and by Sentius Caecilianus the Praetor, Legates of Augustus with Pro 
Praetorian authority.777 
Provincial boundaries may not have always been marked, and they may have had 
very little appreciable impact on the day to day lives of most people, but they still 
structured their interaction with the imperial administration as well as much of their 
understanding of the world.778 This understanding is made manifest in the text of the 
Patara, where the provincial boundaries, even though they are not described, still 
dictate the cities and routes included in the itinerary, a point which is demonstrated by 
the fact that the city of Attaleia is explicitly listed as the first city beyond the provincial 
boundaries on the road into Pamphylia.779 In addition to this provincial border crossing, 
four other named political units of Lycia appear on the monument to provide 
topographical orientation and a geographic sense of structure at a level not found in 
most itineraries.780 These political features include the province of Asia, two conventus 
or internal administrative districts of the province, Oktapolis and Mnara, and one 
topographical region, the Milyas.781 It was the internal boundaries of these 
administrative districts as much as municipal and provincial frontiers that dictated the 
composition of provincial councils and tended to direct the course of inter-city 
competition and self-definition, the forces which gave the Empire form and life.782

administration, is a series of milestones set up in Arabia by Trajan to celebrate the 
incorporation of that region into the Roman Empire: 
The Emperor Caesar Nerva Trajan Augustus, son of Nerva, Germanicus, 
Dacicus, Pontifex Maximus, in the 15th year of his tribunician power, hailed 
as Emperor for the 6th time, Consul for the 5th time, Father of the Fatherland, 
laid out and excavated a new road that was driven into the structure of the 
Province of Arabia (in formam provinciae Arabia) from the boarders of 
Syria all the way to the Red Sea through the (services) of Gaius Claudius 
Severus, Legate of Augustus with Pro Praetorian authority and designated 
Consul.783 
The expression in formam provinciae Arabiae is unusual, but the context makes 
it clear that Trajan was referring to an intellectual conception involving the formal 
physical organisation of Arabia constituted by the provincial road-network and the 
surveyed borders of Syria and the shore of the Red Sea. It is equally clear that the road 
Trajan built was a significant feature defining the newly-created provinces internal 
structure. Like the road and bridge described by Balbus, the road found on the Trajanic 
milestones set out from an area defined by a Roman frontier and penetrated into a 
previously uncontrolled territory in order to redefine it in quantitative terms as Roman. 
In the case of Dacia, Arabia and Lycia, the province was defined by the fines or 
boundaries, which formed a geographic framework for the incorporated communities, 
which made up the province and viae, or roads, which linked the cities together and 
helped to create an administrative hierarchy anchored in the regions topography.784 The 
use of measured boundaries, geographic features and roads, all quantified and recorded 
by the surveyors, to create a formal physical and intellectual construction for Lycia, 
Dacia and Arabia would tend to suggest that Verranius, Trajan, Balbus and those who 
built the road through Arabia all thought in terms of a common system of construction 
for organising the provinces of the Empire. 
What is less clear is how the quantitative information gathered by surveyors 
underpinning and shaping this understanding was transmitted from the field to 
administrators and then from administrators to people in a world without modern mass-
communication. There can be little question that surveyors could be organised to collect 
information and then file reports on it, either through the usual structure of the legions

as outlined above or through the freedmen and private associates forming a governors  
concilium.785  But these social networks would not allow a governor such as Verranius 
to restructure and transmit a full understanding of a province based on aggregate data 
out to all the cities in his jurisdiction. Proof that such information was transmitted can 
be found in the fact that the text on the Patara monument was inscribed in Greek rather 
than Latin, indicating that Lycians as much as or more than future Roman officials were 
the intended audience of the text. 
In addition, while the monument employs a topographic and perhaps even 
geographic organisation to the description of cities and routes, the text only provides a 
few of the Roman administrative districts and provincial frontier boundaries shaping the 
identity of the province. With nothing in the text to explain why some districts and 
political features were included while others were not, the text of the Patara monument 
would have only been meaningful to Greek-speaking members of the Empire who were 
already familiar with the geography and political structure of Lycia.786 Indeed, the 
amount of information that was not included on the Patara monument has been 
demonstrated in two articles published by Fatih Onur. In both articles Onur outlines 
some of the results from a two year field survey undertaken from 2009 to 2010, during 
which many of the road networks of Lycia were investigated and new evidence 
discovered. While most of the roads covered in these reports are recorded on the Patara 
monument, two sets of features discussed are not. 
One set of features are the boundaries of Pataras municipal territory and the 
conventus of which it was a part in the Roman period. Fatih Onur and Mehmet Alkan 
have recently argued that these boundaries are reflected in a series of inscriptions 
recorded during the 2009 field survey.787 The other set of features is an otherwise 
unrecorded series of roads running down to port cities such as Antiphellos, Aperlai, 
Teimusa, Simena and Istlada, which should be recorded as part of the route on the 
Patara monument running from Phillos to Kyaneai.788 The high degree of Roman 
administrative interest in the roads and boundaries around Patara and the absence of 
these features from the Patara monument serve to underscore the highly selective

presentation of information found in the text. This selectivity suggests that there was 
another source document behind the Patara monument, which contained the full range 
of information needed for the administration of the province. In all likelihood, this 
information would have been found in the document, or documents, which embodied 
the forma provinciae. Put another way, the forma provinciae comprised both the 
intellectual conception of a province as a discrete place and the document, which 
contained the formal organisation of the physical landscape and its administrative 
infrastructure. 
While the forma provinciae, as an administrative document, would represent a 
logical means for transient administrators to understand the extent of the territory for 
which they were responsible, its existence in day to day administrative activities is only 
manifest in legal cases involving the lawful jurisdiction of tax collectors and municipal 
officials recorded in a series of three inscriptions.789 One of these inscriptions records 
the verdict rendered by Manius Laberius Maximus in what seems to have been a dispute 
between Charagonius Philopalaestrus, public contractor for the portorium of the 
Thracian coast, and the people of Histria. 
As has been discussed elsewhere, the people of Histria had long been concerned 
that their ancestral right to fish in the mouth of the Puce River without taxation would 
be violated in spite of the fact that several successive governors had reaffirmed it.790 
When Charagonius Philopalaestrus arrived in the region with a forma describing and 
authorising him to collect portorium from the mouth of the Puce River and other places, 
the Histrians seem to have protested his attempts to collect from them by filing a 
challenge in the proconsuls court. To settle the matter, Laberius had a survey of the 
Histrian territory carried out. His final verdict, however, while fragmentary, clearly 
rested on extensive documentation covering not just the territory of Histria, but the 
geographic limits for administrative districts within his own province as well as those in 
the surrounding provinces:

It was transcribed and checked for accuracy against the records of Manius

[---] from Fabius Pompianus, which were addressed to Charagonius 
Philopalaestrus, public contractor for the portorium of the Thracian coast, so 
that, as requested, the portorium from Halmyris and Puce might be granted 
to him in accordance with the forma he has received. He shall have the right 
to the portorium due from the boundaries of the villages of the Dimensies all 
the way...791 
The forma Charagonius used to press his claim is an ambiguous document, but it 
seems to have included his authorisation to collect taxes and a description or diagram 
showing the part of the province where he was expected to work. To reach his verdict, 
Laberius seems to have checked the geographic information in this forma against the 
results of the survey carried out around Histria and the known limits of the tax districts 
in the province. This course of action would only be possible if there was a document, 
or documents, recording the full administrative structure of the province, a forma 
provinciae. The existence of such a document is suggested independently of both this 
decretum and the Patara by a letter from the imperial legate Flavius Sabinus to the 
people of Histria referencing the extent of the tax district and indicating that both he 
and the magistrates of the city understood the geographic extent of the territory under 
consideration.792 
Beyond the Patara monument and the inscriptions from Histria, two Greek 
inscriptions from Aphrodisias (Figs. 4.17 and 4.18) further illuminate the character and 
function of the forma provinciae as a tool to establish administrative direction in the 
provinces at the imperial level, suggesting that copies of the forma were retained, both 
in the province, and at the imperial residence. Both documents are letters addressing the 
issues of liturgies and taxes levied against the citizens of Aphrodisias, an independent 
city like Histria. The first letter is a subscript written by Trajan to the city of Smyrna 
exempting Tiberius Julianus Attalus of Aphrodisias from having to perform liturgies in 
the temple there. The second one was written to Aphrodisias by Hadrian to affirm that 
the city was indeed exempt from paying provincial taxes, making the situation similar to 
the one faced by Laberius:

Emperor Caesar Trajan to the Smyrnaeotes. I do not wish anyone from the 
free cities to be forced into (undertaking) your liturgy, and especially no one 
from Aphrodisias, since that city has been removed from the forma 
provinciae so that it is not liable, either to the common liturgies of Asia or to 
others. I release Tiberius Julianus Attalus, a man who has the highest 
commendation from his own city, from (service at) the temple in Smyrna; 
and I have written about these matters to Julius Balbus, my friend and the 
proconsul.793 
The Emperor Caesar Trajan Hadrian Augustus, son of the deified Trajan 
Parthicus, grandson of the deified Nerva, Pontifex Maximus, in the 3rd year 
of his tribunician power, greets the Magistrates, Council and citizens of the 
Aphrodisians. 
Your freedom, autonomy and the other things which were granted to you by 
the Senate and the Emperors who have preceded me, I have already 
confirmed. 
I have been petitioned through an embassy about the use of iron and the tax 
on nails. While this matter is controversial, since this is not the first time 
that the contractors have attempted to collect from you, still, I knowing the 
city worthy of honour and removed from the forma provinciae, release it 
from payment; and I have written to Claudius Agrippinus, my procurator to 
order the contractor for tax-collection in Asia to keep away from your 
city.794 
The resolution to both of the cases set out in these letters is drawn from the civil 
law of property-ownership governing the foundation of colonies, which was touched on 
in previous chapters. These laws stated that land within the territory of a colony that 
was not allocated to a colonist and therefore retained by an original inhabitant is not 
subject to the liturgies and taxes of the colony but rather falls under the jurisdiction of 
the community from whose land the territory of the colony was taken except in some 
very special circumstances.795 In the case of Aphrodisias, both Trajan and Hadrian have 
applied the principle to the entire city, which they treated as being within the lands 
comprising the Roman imperial province, but not under the Empires jurisdiction, by 
virtue of being an independent city. To make this principle binding under Roman law, 
the reference to the forma recording the lands not controlled by the colonia, or in this 
case the Empire, had to be reproduced from the Latin forma in a Greek administrative 
document with as much fidelity as possible.

The concept of the forma provinciae in both letters is derived from the Greek 
word toupos, which carries strong connotations of drawings, diagrams, legal 
constitutions, theoretical, philosophical and even physical models or blueprints, making 
the term very close to the Latin word forma in meaning and function.796 Modern 
commentators of these two documents have tended to translate the idea expressed here 
as either formula or schemata.797 Both translations capture aspects of the document 
under consideration. But neither really captures the legalistic principle drawn from the 
Latin Ius Civilis, which the emperors have in mind when they use the formula removed 
from the forma provinciae (exeremenes tou tupou tes eparcheias). This construction 
was drawn from the practice maintained by the surveyors, whereby all allotments of 
land that were returned to the original possessors at the time of a colonys foundation, 
and therefore not subject to the colonys jurisdiction, were noted down on the forma 
agrimensorum as removed or returned.798 
This would tend to suggest that the emperors could, and indeed did, consult some 
sort of document in which the city of Aphrodisias was listed as physically present in the 
landscape of Asia, but juridically separated from the province. Moreover, the use of 
toupos or forma in this context suggests that the document, like the forma 
agrimensorum recording colonial lands, was comprised of both text and images. It also 
suggests that the two documents had similar functions. 
Greek and Latin had a word for a diagram representing a large geographic region, 
chorographia, and the Roman army had chorographiarii, or soldiers responsible 
for producing the chorographia in its ranks.799 While surveyors in general and 
chorographiarii in particular seem to have had a deep interest in Hellenistic geography 
and geographic theory, the chorographia is very hard to define as a document, since the 
descriptions of it differ greatly from one account to another. It is even possible that the 
term referred to several different types of documents related only by the fact that they 
all showed what the creator took to be a region. Each such document would therefore

reflect not only the specific circumstances of its creation, but the individual stylistic 
peculiarities of its creator as well. 
Descriptions provided by both Strabo and Vitruvius, however make it fairly clear 
that at least some chorographia depicted rivers, mountains, cities and coastlines at the 
regional level with enough detail that administrators, like Verranius or Hadrian could 
identify individual toponoi for the purposes of making decisions, such as those 
expressed in the documents quoted above.800 At the same time, the identification of the 
forma provinciae with a chorographia should be taken with care, since Ptolemy states 
that the production of a chorographia required not mathematical knowledge, but rather 
the skills employed in landscape painting.801 Given his remarks, the chorographia 
should not be seen as involving centuriation in any way, nor should they be seen as 
maps in the modern sense. By the same token, Ptolemys observations should not be 
seen as eliminating the possible value of the chorographia as an administrative 
document or as a possible structural identity for the forma provinciae. 
Ptolemy, like many other authors from antiquity, should not be taken at his word. 
This is particularly true, since Ptolemy, like Strabo before him, makes it clear that much 
of his geographic knowledge is derived from the quantitative investigation of the 
landscape and therefore from the activities of surveyors.802 Ptolemys and Strabos 
common dependence on survey data suggest that there was a complicated relationship 
between surveyors and those who chose to practice geography, which has yet to be fully 
explored. As part of that complex relationship, Ptolemy may have used the concept of 
landscape painting as an analogy or as part of a rhetorical metaphor, in which the 
description of a chorographia as a landscape painting served as part of a reductive 
strategy to enhance Ptolemys own scholarly achievements as a mathematical 
geographer by presenting the accomplishments of the chorographiarii as little more 
than ornamental art. As was noted in Chapter Two above, such reductive strategies, 
while not common in the Corpus Agrimensorum, do feature in much of the technical

literature, and are particularly common in Ptolemys contemporary Galen.803 While 
Ptolemy cannot be said to display the same stylistic tendencies as Galen, he does make 
a point of criticising the work of previous geographers such as Marinus of Tyre as part 
of a conscious strategy intended to enhance his credibility.804 While a wider literary 
study of Ptolemys introduction is needed to establish the exact rhetorical function of 
the passages discussing the chorographia, such a study is outside the scope of this 
project and will be left for a later time. 
Even so, whatever the truth behind Ptolemys use of the chorographia may 
prove to be, two points seem to be clear. First, the chorographia, whatever it may have 
looked like, contained graphics, which, like the forma agrimensorum or the pictorial 
diagrams found in medical and mechanical manuals, served as the centre point of 
discourse.805 Secondly, the chorographia, like the forma agrimensorum, represented a 
genre of document with its own compositional discourse, establishing what a 
chorographiarius might, or might not, be allowed to include when creating one. As was 
noted in previous chapters, the full extent and nature of this discourse remain uncharted. 
Within the known range of elements in that discourse, however, there is plenty of room 
for identifying the toupos mentioned by Trajan and Hadrian as a chorographia of sorts. 
Apart from the possible examples found in the Madaba Map and the diagram 
found on the highly controversial Artemidorus Papyrus, there are no surviving 
depictions of regional chorography to provide details of the toupos or chorographias 
appearance.806 Even so, the available evidence indicate that the graphic or diagram at 
the centre of the document possessed a label or diagrammatic attribute, such as a letter, 
for each feature of interest, and a commentary to provide discussion and/or, guidance 
for the documents interpretation.807 Since the forma agrimensorum was devoted to 
displaying the centuriated land of a community and the forma provinciae was intended 
to reflect the communities and administrative districts of a province without any 
reference to centuriation, there would have been a considerable difference in form,

content and composition between these two types of document. However, the functional 
nature of the two documents was similar.  
As discussed elsewhere, the forma agrimensorum created a monumental 
depiction of a communitys territory, which mediated between the abstract concept of 
the community and its concrete reality through a graphic representation that allowed for 
the regulation of social relationships and the orderly regulation of property.808 The 
forma provinciae mediated the abstract concept of the province and its concrete realities 
in a similar manner, by presenting the relationships between communities, the 
administrative districts and the provincial capital in a single monumental display. 
Such mediation and the comprehension it could foster was just as crucial as 
having itineraries and tax documents in a political system where provincial 
administrators did not remain in one place long, changed postings frequently, and 
needed to quickly comprehend the extent and nature of their province. The text of the 
letters from Trajan and Hadrian show both the value of such understanding for an 
administrator far removed from the site of a given situation and the extent to which the 
information from the forma provinciae could be used to structure social relationships in 
order to resolve existing problems. 
In addition to serving as an aid to the administration of a province, there is 
circumstantial evidence to show that the forma provinciae also served a propagandistic 
function. Within the text of the bronze tablet found in Lyons recording the speech 
Claudius delivered before the senate in 48 AD, there are no less than three passages 
indicating that the emperor used detailed depictions of the provinces as props in his 
oration. First, Claudius uses the demonstrative interjection ecce meaning to behold to 
reference the colony of Viennensium or Vienna.809 Ecce by its very nature carries the 
force of demonstration and gesture, indicating that Claudius was pointing to something 
within the chamber, which could be used to reference the city in a visual manner. 
In addition to this demonstrative interjection, both an unnamed senator and 
Claudius make direct reference to the boundaries of the Gallic provinces. Indeed, the

text even indicates that Claudius physically pointed to regions depicted in a document, 
or documents, which showed the relationship between Gallia Narbonensis and Gallia 
Comata: 
It is time, Tiberius Caesar Germanicus, that you show the Conscript 
Fathers where it is that your speech is headed. You have already come to the 
furthest reaches of Gallia Narbonensis.  And if you should agree about 
this (point), what more could you wish than that I draw your attention (to 
the issue) by pointing to this section of land on the other side of the 
boundaries to the province of Narbonensis which already sends you senators 
because it is not displeasing to have men from Lugdunum in our ranks. 
Indeed, Conscript Fathers, I am hesitant to depart the boundaries of the 
provinces which are customary and familiar to you, but the case for Gallia 
Comata must now be pressed unreservedly.810 
In addition to using what is unmistakably visual language in this passage, 
Claudius, like Trajan in the text on the milestone discussed above, invokes the formal 
language of surveying. When Claudius states that he is pointing out (demonstrare), 
the land (solus), which is beyond the boundaries (fines), he is drawing on the 
vocabulary and phrasing used by the surveyors in the formal demonstratio that 
established a colony or resolved a boundary dispute. Since Claudius was speaking 
before the Senate in Rome and not on the border between Gallia Narbonensis and 
Gallia Comata, such a demonstratio would have required a graphic representation of the 
land in question or some such substitute representation of the land to be effective. 
Unfortunately, there is nothing in the speech to indicate whether Claudius was using 
painted wooden panels showing the territory of a single province or a large scale 
diagram or map of the western provinces similar to the map of the world mentioned by 
Eumenius.811 It would seem far more likely that Claudius was referencing the formae 
provinciarum for the three Galliae and the two Germaniae given the evidence provided 
by the letters of Trajan and Hadrian, as well as the forma of Ethiopia mentioned by 
Pliny the Elder: 
A forma of Ethiopia was examined when a report was made to Nero that 
showed nothing for 986 miles past the border of the Empire at Cyrene all 
the way to Merin where a rare grove of palm trees grew.812

The forma mentioned here was probably nothing like the forma provinciae, since 
it is very unlikely that the surveyors in the exploratory expedition sent out by Nero were 
able to establish the boarders of Ethiopia. However, the passage, when considered 
alongside the speech of Claudius quoted above, shows that pictorial representations of 
space were used to inform and persuade, creating social and political relationships that 
influenced the course of events in the Roman world. Since the political and 
administrative processes in the provinces tended to reflect those at Rome, it would be 
logical for provincial administrators to employ the forma provinciae as a persuasive tool 
to foster the sense of provincial identity, which scholars sometimes feel they find in the 
epigraphic record.813 
But such an interpretation must remain a conjecture at this stage, since there is no 
direct evidence, other than the Patara monument, and perhaps, the Artemidorus 
Papyrus, to support it. Even if the Roman administration used the forma provinciae to 
help organise provincial conventus, the letters of Trajan and Hadrian show that while 
the municipalities were expected to know about the forma provinciae, they were not 
expected to know its contents. In light of this, tactical surveying during the Romans 
first entry into a region and in the following years was principally intended to facilitate 
Roman control and inform the Roman central administration about the territory under 
its control.

Chapter 5: Shaping the Roman Empire: Conclusions 
5.1 Conquest and Control: Surveying and the Foundation of a 
Province 
From the time of Augustus onwards, the Roman agrimensores or surveyors provided a 
valuable linchpin between those who administered the Empire and the territories they 
controlled. As the discussion in Chapter Four shows, the surveyors activities as part of 
the Roman legions provided the Roman army with an invaluable tactical advantage out 
in the field. When the Roman legions went to war, surveyors, such as the mensor 
Balbus, aligned and marked out lines of advance for the supply columns to follow and 
along which captured people and materials could be sent back to Roman territory. When 
rivers proved to be too deep to ford and the local population burned the boats and 
bridges, surveyors calculated the width and depth of rivers. With the help of architects 
and carpenters, they constructed bridges for the mule carts carrying supplies and for the 
field artillery. 
These roads, which were often created out of local paths and tracks, along with 
the newly created bridges, formed fresh structures for occupation and control. As such 
they were the first lines in a new discourse about the structural identity of the landscape 
itself and the culture of those who inhabited the places which the Roman army 
dominated and redefined through violence and the application of mathematics. The 
sudden transcendence of natural barriers and the transformation of familiar places 
through the introduction of bridges and the surveyors long-distance alignments 
connecting castra and urbes constituted an act of shock, awe and violation. Reactions to 
this reconfiguration of space and place would have varied from people to people, 
depending on prior exposure to Roman culture and local social conditions, with some 
coming to terms, some fighting and others hunkering down at home behind 
fortifications. 
 Those who chose to seek shelter from the Roman storm within fortified strong-
holds had to reckon with the surveyors directly since the agrimensores regarded man-
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             221 
 
made fortifications as a challenge which, like the natural barriers of mountains and 
streams, they could overcome with their craft. Yet, in the course of a siege, surveyors 
were technicians and advisors, who had to remain deferential to the senatorial 
commander, even as they applied their technical skills to reconstruct the landscape 
around the besieged community. As was discussed in the chapter, the siege progression 
was its own form of aggressive discourse, with rules and stages. The surveyors part in 
the discourse was first to construct camps, then connect them with trenches and towers 
to create a sort of no-mans land out of the civic populations most familiar spaces. If 
the psychological shock and threat embodied in such a transformation did not compel 
surrender, the surveyor would be called upon to engineer assault ramps, mines and other 
methods for breaching the defences during the heavy assault by the legionaries. The 
total destruction the Romans wrought upon any community they stormed and the scars a 
siege left in the landscape sent a powerful message demanding compliance from the 
people living in the surrounding region. 
 While the activities of the surveyors were crucial to the Roman legions ability 
to secure tactical victories in campaigns such as the Dacian Wars under Trajan or 
Vespasians expedition to suppress the Jewish uprising, they were only the prelude to 
the larger task facing the surveyors should the emperor or his representatives choose to 
formally incorporate a region into the Empire as a province. As noted in the 
introduction, it was the administrative needs of the senate in the later Republic and the 
age of Augustus which necessitated the identification of a province as not just a realm 
of responsibility, but as a geographic region where authority was exercised. In order for 
such an exercise of power to take place, it was crucial for Roman administrators to 
know exactly what it was that they controlled. 
As the Patara monument and other documents considered in Chapter Four 
show, it was the surveyors and the soldiers under their direction, who not only measured 
the roads and other pathways in a region, but collected the cities of a region into 
groupings and measured the distance between topographical points to form a provincial 
frontier as well. To judge from the Patara monument, cities were clustered together 
based on topography and their relationship on a given road network. In the case of 
Lycia, the surveyors seem to have grouped the cities into six separate networks, all of 
which radiated out from the city of Patrai. Interestingly enough, when organising the 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             222 
 
networks on the Patara monument, the surveyors did not create an itinerary which 
could be used to plan travel through the province. Rather, the groupings structure 
political and topographical relationships, which could be used for understanding the 
socio-political or topographical organisation of a province, but little else. Evidence 
gleaned from the Tabula Peutingeriana for the modern region of Romania suggests that 
similar documents were composed for Dacia and, in all probability, other provinces as 
well. 
In the case of the monument from Patara, however, the text shows that the 
information included in the document organising the province was not simply intended 
for the Roman administrations consumption. The text on the Patara monument was 
drafted in Greek, but the distances for the individual routes listed were converted from 
Roman miles to Greek stadia, something which would have only been necessary if the 
information was intended for the use by the people of Lycia. This factor could mean that 
the people of Patara took the information from a Roman document to honour the 
emperor and his legate Verranius, or that Verranius created the monument to 
simultaneously honour the people of Patara, as the newly established capital of the 
province, and the emperor, as the divine ruler of the oikomene. A third possibility  not 
discussed in the literature  is that the monument was a joint project between Verranius 
and the citizenry of Patara to express the solidarity of the people of Lycia and the 
Roman administration under the divine rule of Claudius through the direct articulation 
of the provinces new political structure. 
All three of the reasons for the Patara monument just presented reflect the same 
political reality in which the administration transformed quantitative and qualitative 
information, collected by the surveyors through the direct autopsy of the landscape into 
a conceptual framework, which defined the province of Lycia. Since the information 
about place names on the monument, if not the measurements themselves, had to be 
drawn from interaction with the Lycian population, and the information was presented 
in a form the Lycians could utilise, the Patara monument, and whatever documents 
were behind it, represent the first stages of a provincial discourse formulated by 
surveying. The evidence taken from the Lyon tablet recording the speech of Claudius to 
the Senate, as well as the letters of Trajan and Hadrian preserved on an archive wall at 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             223 
 
Aphrodisias, show that other forms of political interaction derived from the documents 
organising the province continued to take place long after a province was constituted. 
Trajan addressed a complaint from a Roman citizen from Aphrodisias, who 
insisted he was being compelled to perform a liturgy, which he was not obligated to 
perform by the people of Smyrna. Meanwhile, Hadrian addressed a complaint from the 
people of Aphrodisias concerning a tax on nails, which they did not believe they were 
obligated to pay. In both cases, the emperor ruled in favour of the people from 
Aphrodisias using the information from a document which has been translated as the 
forma provinciae. Claudius likewise seems to have pointed to some sort of document, 
which depicted or included information about the boundaries and cities of the Gallic and 
Germanic provinces. Unfortunately, in the case of the Lyon tablet, interpreting the 
nature of the document is much more difficult than in the case of the Trajanic and 
Hadrianic letters. In the letters, the document clearly contained information about the 
cities located within the fines or boarders of Asia, their physical and sociological 
relationship to one another, and their political status within the Empire. Other 
inscriptions discussed within the chapter show that a forma provinciae existed and that 
it represented an intellectual formation of a provinces physical and political structure 
based on roads and topographically constituted boundaries, two features which were 
defined by the surveyors. 
5.2 Colonists, Administrators and the Roman Surveyors 
While the creation of military assault roads undoubtedly disrupted agricultural patterns 
for some indigenous land-holders and the establishment of Roman administrative 
boundaries altered the political landscape by requiring local civic leaders to recognise a 
powerful new player on the stage of public affairs, the surveyors greatest impact on 
others came after the province was formulated in the imagination of the emperor and his 
representatives out in the field. As Chapters One and Three show, the direct discourse 
involved in the resolution of boundary disputes, the assessment of taxes and the creation 
of Roman colonies regulated the influence and impact of surveyors on the peoples of 
the Roman world. Though these three activities were closely related, they were 
distinctly different in their impact and the surveyors approached them differently. They 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             224 
 
tailored their approach to these tasks both in terms of the objectives which they needed 
to achieve and to fit the context within which they operated.  
The distinctions are perhaps most apparent in the foundation of colonies, the 
activity most commonly associated with the Roman surveying both in antiquity and 
modern times. In creating a colony, the surveyors usually cut off land from an existing 
community to shape both the external structure and internal organisation of a brand new 
community. Though the formation of a colony was governed by an ideal theoretical 
paradigm found in the Corpus Agrimensorum, the surveyors tailored the pattern for 
laying out both pertica and urbs to meet the unique topographical and political 
conditions governing the communitys foundation. 
In the ideal paradigm of the colonia considered in Chapter Two, the pertica was 
supposed to extend in all four directions from a central point or locus gromae at the 
centre of the city, with the urban fabric separated from the fundi and their land by the 
walls and pomerium. But such an organisation was strictly an ideal that was hardly ever 
realised. Even so, the surveyors laid out the pertica at most colonies using a universal 
mathematical principle. This always involved creating a grid of intersecting limites 
forming rectangles or squares of a set size. The size varied from place to place, but was 
always adjusted in multiples of 120 Roman feet. Theoretically, the surveyors wanted all 
of the land assigned to the pertica to be adjacent to the colonys urban core even when it 
was not present on all four sides. In practice, however, the land need not even 
physically be part of the urban fabric of the new community. There were plenty of cases 
where the pertica was at some distance or where the land assigned to colonists was 
divided between a pertica and a semi-autonomous praefectura as happened at Emerita 
in Spain. 
Each colony received a body of laws that imitated those at Rome, but the details 
of every colonial charter were unique to the foundation of the new city. This meant that 
regulations governing land-distribution and property-ownership varied from one colony 
to another. Colonial founders tended to assign land to colonists in the pertica and 
praefectura either by lot or based on rank and service in the legions. Likewise, the 
colonial founder could, at his sole discretion, grant individual colonists tax-exemption 
or the right to possess more land than was normally specified by the colonial charter. 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             225 
 
Most importantly, the founder could return land to prior possessors, when he deemed 
them worthy. Though this could mitigate the impact of colonial deductions on the 
population of a community whose land was seized by the Roman authorities, it was not 
a means of integrating the indigenous population of a region into Roman society. 
Rather, the power to return land was a means for the colonial founder to reward 
individual local land-holders, who supported the Romans, or grant benefactions to gain 
good-will amongst influential members of the indigenous population. In either case, the 
prior possessor was not usually a citizen of the colony and did not pay taxes or perform 
liturgies there, unless the colonial founder specifically stipulated that they did. In most 
cases, the prior possessors retained citizenship in their original community with 
whatever burdens that might entail. In most cases, the colonial deduction forced 
changes in land-ownership and agricultural practice on a community that the Romans 
had already saddled with a heavy burden of taxes and liturgies. 
The system of legal differentiation instituted by the founders ability to grant 
privileges created the hierarchical relationships, as well as the bonds between patroni 
and clients, which were so crucial to Roman social power structure. The surveyors 
themselves were not directly responsible for assigning the plots at a colony or with 
fixing the political privileges, which instituted the asymmetrical power relationships 
between Roman and non-Roman within the new community. However, they did need to 
understand and know about the juridical taxonomy governing their creation, since they 
were both responsible for drafting the forma with its abbreviated notations on land-
holding as well as the commentaria explaining its contents, and for regulating disputes 
between land-holders regardless of citizenship or social status. 
The forma was drafted to be a clear decisive guide to the ownership and transfer 
of ager divisus et adsignatus attached to a colony, but as passages from the Corpus 
Agrimensorum discussed in Chapter Two show, land-holders did not always abide by 
the terms of their assignments. When land-holders in a colonia made their own 
arrangements long after the community was created, it could cause problems in 
resolving disputes. Even when land-holders observed property boundaries for their 
allotments, buying and selling in accordance with the forma, problems could arise from 
incomplete documentation generated by the Roman administration itself. As discussed 
in Chapter Two, surveyors such as Sicculus Flaccus noted that this was a particular 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             226 
 
problem for assignments made by Caesar and Octavian, where the original posessors 
were killed in war and the land reassigned without proper documentation, making it 
hard to trace the history of ownership. For this reason, surveyors insisted that it was 
essential to study any documentation available on the history of land-holding and all 
systems of boundary demarcation with great care. 
Since colonies such as Bracara Augusta in Spain could alter the flow of trade 
and restructure the cultural discourse about power in a region, it was crucial for civic 
and imperial magistrates to properly interpret and observe the forma in order to regulate 
land-tenure and taxation not just within colonies, but between the colonies and the 
surrounding communities as well. This was hard to do when a dispute involved ager 
relictus, ager extraclusus or subseciva at the edge of a colonys outer boundary, where 
territorial jurisdiction could quickly become a problem since the ownership of such land 
was always open to question. 
Plots of land designated as subseciva along the perimeter of a colony were 
particularly hard to regulate. In theory, all subseciva were supposed to be returned to the 
people from whom the land for a colony was taken, however, it was left to the founder 
to decide about such matters and the land could be allocated to the colony as unassigned 
pasture or woodland. When the land went unused for long periods, the situation could 
lead to protracted legal proceedings, since the original owners or opportunistic people 
from neighbouring communities could attempt to gain possession by occupying the 
land. By custom, if not under Roman law, anyone who occupied a section of land for a 
sufficient period of time could claim it as ager arcifinius or unsurveyed and unallocated 
land, held by the rightful use of force. 
When people outside the colony attempted to exercise these squatters rights on 
unallocated land, however, it simultaneously violated territorial boundaries and initiated 
a conflict with the imperial administration since the emperor held rights of jurisdiction 
over subcisiva. As the case of the Patulcenses and Galillenses on Sardinia shows, 
Roman colonies could force non-Roman populations in the provinces to adapt to Roman 
law and administrative practices as the only secure means of asserting rights of 
ownership over land which may have once belong to them. Mastering Roman law did 
not automatically mean that the Galillenses could successfully contest the claims of the 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             227 
 
Patulcenses, but they were anything but complacent or helpless in the face of Roman 
imperialism, going so far as to send representatives to Rome with the intention of 
examining the private archives of the emperor. At the same time, the case illustrates the 
powerful impact the forma had on the Roman imagination and the ways in which 
imperial magistrates and colonists alike constructed space as place. The Patulcenses 
conceptionalised their communal sense of self-identity through consensus derived from 
the inscribed historical iconography on the forma. Evidently, they were totally unwilling 
to relinquish control over land depicted as being within their ancestral borders, even 
when it had gone unused for a prolonged period. This strong sense of identity derived 
from a past enshrined on the forma, as well as the difficulties in interpreting both the 
iconography and historiographical formation of the document, meant that magistrates 
and claimants alike would have found it helpful to consult surveyors in an interstate 
dispute. 
5.3 Magistrates, Surveyors and the Populations of the Provinces 
Though colonies undoubtedly had a dramatic impact on the provincial landscape and 
the ways in which the provincial populations interacted with both Roman citizens and 
magistrates, emperors, with the exception of Augustus, rarely added communities to this 
most exalted category of city. Consequently, few surveyors ever had the opportunity to 
actually lay out a colonial pertica. This meant that the direct impact of surveyors on 
provincial culture through the formation of a colony  no matter its significance in their 
literature  was somewhat circumscribed. For most surveyors, the day to day 
maintenance and regulation of boundaries for the resolution of disputes was the most 
significant subject of concern and the main point of contact with both the indigenous 
populations of a region and the Roman administrators overseeing them. 
As the discussion in Chapter One shows, a provincial governor was expected to 
give an advice on any dispute between two communities brought before him, but he was 
not obligated to use a surveyor to establish the circumstances of a case. The choice to 
employ a surveyor was usually dictated by the conditions on the ground and as 
discussed in chapter Three, the legal taxonomy of a dispute. To help with such 
decisions, the surveyors maintained at least an unofficial taxonomy for legal cases that 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             228 
 
they could employ to assess whether or not a dispute fell within their sphere of 
competence. The details for this informal system of classification differ from one author 
to another within the Corpus Agrimensorum, but, broadly speaking, the surveyors were 
interested in cases involving: the deposition and erosion of land by rivers, boundaries or 
boundary markers, site, area, the law relating to subseciva, and territorial jurisdiction. If 
a provincial magistrate found that the litigation he was asked to adjudicate involved any 
of these issues, he would call a surveyor in for advice, as Augurinus did in resolving the 
dispute between Hypata and Lamia. In that situation, as with so many, the provincial 
governor overheard the case as the representative of the emperor and at least in principle 
acted on advice and orders from the central administration. 
As the documents from Azania show, however, the emperor in many instances 
simply rubber-stamped the governors course of action, unless there was a reason to 
override it. The governor was the man on the spot and the central administration always 
expected the man on the spot to have a much better grasp of a situation than did the 
central administration, which was sometime separated by thousands of square 
kilometres. Thus, in most situations the governor had to use his best judgement and his 
best source of support in reaching a decision. This support would have come from a 
surveyor who could interact with the local population, gaining a first-hand appreciation 
of the situation on the ground while demonstrating that the imperial administration was 
taking an interest in civic affairs. 
In most instances the emperor expected his governors to find a surveyor for 
themselves out in the province where they were stationed. To do this, a magistrate could 
circulate to see if any of his concilia had one amongst his clients or household who 
could be hired for the job. He could also see if the procurator had access to any through 
the imperial estates, though there is no evidence to show that any of the imperial 
freedmen or slaves, who worked as surveyors were ever detached to support the 
provincial administration. Rather, the emperor, like so many wealthy senators, retained 
such individuals for his own personal use, which included direct intervention in disputes 
where the litigants enjoyed imperial patronage. For the governor, as the emperors 
representative in a province, however, the quickest way of locating a surveyor was to 
apply to the legions, since it became increasingly true in the period after Augustus that 
each legion had at least one surveyor on staff. 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             229 
 
Since the majority of the provinces did not have a standing legion stationed 
within their borders, a governor would often have to ask the magistrates of the nearest 
province with a military garrison for the loan of a legionary surveyor to resolve a 
particular situation. Such a request frequently invoked the complexities of patronage, 
and was therefore not always a practical course of action for political or logistical 
reasons. Therefore, a magistrate would have been reduced to locating a surveyor in the 
same way as everyone else. This entailed finding a collegium mensorum and negotiating 
a contract for the services of one of its members on competitive bases. Only when these 
options were exhausted would an emperor such as Vespasian or Trajan send surveyors 
to support their magistrates. 
Regardless of the surveyors social status or origins, the diplomatic and juridical 
procedure for resolving an interstate dispute such as that between Hypata and Lamia 
was substantially the same as that used in resolving a dispute between two land-holders 
in a colonia, with one important difference; a forma might not be available for civitates 
out in the provinces. Even so, the surveyor went to the site of the dispute, established 
the local system used for marking boundaries and authenticating property-ownership in 
both communities and examined the evidence from physical features in the landscape, 
witnesses and documents held in both communities. Only if the case involved a colonia, 
imperial taxes, there was an imperial estate near at hand, or the emperor had personal 
investments in one or more of the communities would a surveyor need to consult the 
provincial or imperial archives at Rome. 
At the end of an investigation, the surveyor would assemble the parties 
concerned and make his renuntiatio or verbal report, which was probably read from a 
tabula to give it authentication and weight. The renuntiatio would also entail a 
demonstratio or pointing out of the features of the landscape, upon which the surveyors 
decision was based. Following the surveyors renuntiatio, the governor, like any other 
iudex, would appoint a date for rendering judgement. On that day, as the documents 
from Hypata, Delphi and several other sites show, the governor or his clerk would read 
out his official verdict or decretum and copies would be posted in both communities to 
make it binding. Refusing to respect an imperial decretum would lead to further 
litigation, which could take years to resolve, as happened in the case of Koroneia 
considered in Chapter Three. If any party in the dispute resorted to the use of violence 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             230 
 
to ask for their claims before or after litigation, the Roman response was usually swift 
and terrible. The Roman central administration sent men from the legions or auxiliary 
units to indiscriminately put down what the Romans considered to be an insurrection. 
At this point it is essential to restate that a governor heard cases which 
provincials brought to his attention. As is amply demonstrated in both Chapters One and 
Three, it was the responsibility of individuals and communities out in the provinces to 
seek out the governor and bring disputes between communities to the attention of the 
Roman administration. Two communities who disagreed about their boundaries or the 
ownership of a piece of property were not obligated to take the matter before the 
provincial authorities. They could opt for private third party arbitration from another 
community in the region or theoretically even from a private person, who was trusted by 
all the communities involved. While the evidence for this practice is scarce, surviving 
inscriptions indicate that the procedure was very similar to that used by the Roman 
provincial administration, suggesting that it was most common amongst the eastern 
cities where the practice seems to have developed out of the process for interstate 
dispute resolution and diplomacy. 
Having said that, the Tabula Contrebiensis suggests that other systems of 
dispute resolution may have existed in the African and Western provinces, however, no 
proceedings etched into wooden documents or carved into stone monuments for 
posterity have not survived. Surveyors may well have been involved in such 
proceedings using the same or similar methods to those described in the documents 
from Hypata, Histonium and Herculanium discussed in Chapters One and Three. This 
raises the question of just how and why surveyors appear within provincial 
communities. 
5.4 Surveyors, Civitates and the Roman Empire 
As the funerary cippus of Quintus Julius Rufus discussed at the start of Chapter Three 
shows, surveyors were employed by civitates out in the provinces. Unfortunately, the 
monument of Rufus does not state the reason for his presence amongst the Siccaeniae. 
Circumstantial evidence from other inscriptions discussed in this chapter and in Chapter 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             231 
 
One provides some different options though. One possibility may have been that the 
Siccaeniae hired Rufus to help resolve a dispute with one or more of their neighbours. 
The presence of Rufus in such a dispute would show that the Siccaeniae sought to have 
the dispute adjudicated either by the provincial governor or through third party 
arbitration, flagging the civitas adoption of Roman juridical principles irrespective of 
their relationship with Rome. 
Another possibility is that the Siccaeniae hired Rufus to reorganise the way in 
which land-tenure was organised within the civitas to improve relations with the Roman 
tax-farmers. As several passages from the Corpus Agrimensorum discussed in Chapters 
One and Two and the inscriptions from Histria discussed in Chapters Three and Four 
show, civitates tended to structure their territory using an elliptical or circular perimeter. 
Frontinus, in a passage discussed at the end of Chapter Two, makes it clear that the 
Romans accepted and recorded such boundaries when they existed. Moreover, he also 
states that the Roman administration maintained a similar policy about the internal 
organisation of civitates. At the same time, the documents examined in Chapters Three 
and Four show that the relationship between civitates and the Roman tax-farmers 
involving territorial delimitations and property-ownership could be contentious, 
particularly when there was a colonial praefectura or the settlement of individual 
Roman citizens within the territory of a civitas. To avoid problems, the Roman 
administration sometimes divided provincial land subject to tax. This allowed the 
central administration to forcibly regulate land occupied by soldiers and to help stabilise 
regional agriculture for taxation following a change in a communitys legal status or at 
the end of an armed conflict. 
There were also instances in which surveyors assessing and recording the land 
of a civitas would provide notations on the forma to show that the land had been divided 
and allocated for tax purposes even when they did not measure out any limites. This 
allowed the Romans to regulate and tax the populations of the Empire in accordance 
with Roman practice without actually disrupting local patterns of land-holding. Even so, 
the use of such hypothetical lines of demarcation represented an invasive aspect of 
surveying that determined a communitys relationship with the Roman administration 
predominantly along Roman lines. To avoid such an experience, it is quite likely that 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             232 
 
many communities unilaterally chose to reorganise their patterns of land-holding to 
improve their relationship with the Roman tax-farmers. 
Yet another possibility worthy of consideration is that civitates such as the 
Siccanae and Cantiaci carried out the reorganisation of their own lands to better 
accommodate and negotiate their position within the competitive hierarchy of 
communities that made up the Roman Empire. Such a suggestion is supported by the 
wooden administrative document from London discussed early on in Chapter Three. It 
is also supported by the activities of the Siluienses, who were apparently attempting to 
build an aqueduct to bring water across the land of the Sosinestani, using a course 
formed with geometric construction and marked with surveyors stakes some sixty years 
before the battle of Actium. 
More importantly still, at the same time the Sosinestani used geometric 
surveying to build an aqueduct; they also developed complicated Roman-style 
arguments to justify their conduct in a dispute with other civitates in the region 
conducted before the decuriones of Contrebia. This illustrates that civitates in southern 
Spain, such as the Sosinestani and the Siccaeniae were willing to not just employ 
surveyors like Rufus to restructure land-holding and agricultural facilities in order to 
improve agriculture and meet the demands of Roman taxation, but they were also 
willing to adapt Roman law to gain an advantage over other communities. This 
willingness to use foreign methods to adapt the landscape, regulate its use and win 
disputes with other communities reflects a world in which competition for agricultural 
or pasture land and water was fierce, if not actually violent. Indeed, documents from 
Koroneia show that competition for good pasture land became so fierce by the reign of 
Antoninus Pius that some communities were resorting to armed conflict, even when the 
emperor himself intervened directly in interstate disputes. It is therefore perhaps not 
surprising that even pastoralists, such as the Rodopeis of Thrace, had Roman surveyors 
delineate the boundaries of their pastures to ensure that they would not lose it to those 
who asked for squatters rights on ager arcifinius. 
Finally, there is the possibility that the Siccaeniae hired Rufus to help regulate 
land disputes within the civitates. Of all the possibilities available, this is the least 
secure and perhaps the least likely. While municipia in Italy can be shown to have 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             233 
 
retained surveyors as part of the civic administration, those surveyors were usually 
slaves or freedmen, as was discussed in Chapters One and Three. Even if Roman 
citizens undertook such work on long-term contract, there is very little evidence for it 
outside Italy before the mid-third century AD. 
Apart from the limited evidence for the civic retention of surveyors for the long-
term regulation of internal land-tenure, there is the positive evidence of the boundary 
disputes between individuals within a single community. While this evidence reflects 
the bias of the epigraphic habit, nearly every text documenting the role of surveyors in a 
dispute between two or more land-holders within a single community, involved at least 
one person who was not from the community where the dispute took place. The one 
exception to this trend is the wooden tablet from Herculaneum discussed in Chapters 
Two and Three. This suggests that most communities outside Italy continued to prefer 
to resolve disputes using more traditional mechanisms of dispute resolution, which did 
not involve surveyors from outside the community. It also suggests a certain diplomatic 
air to the surveyors. Land-holders, who could not access local systems of dispute 
resolution as outsiders, would have been more willing to defer to the impartiality of the 
Roman surveyors and imperial arbitration. 
5.5 Surveyors and the Shape of their Craft 
Whether surveyors used the Roman foot to assess land organised into arapennia in 
Britain or cubits to assess land divided into plethora in Asia Minor, the principles of 
dispute resolution they employed across the Empire were the same. Their approach 
depended upon a conceptual system of evidentiary proofs and philosophical 
assumptions peculiar to Hellenistic and Roman culture. Within that intellectual 
framework, one could establish a claim of ownership on land based on an argument 
derived from the fact that: one had inherited the land from their ancestors, or they 
bought it for money, or they have laid claim to it by force of arms, or they received it 
from the emperor as a benefaction. 
With the exception of the third possibility, each of these reasons for ownership 
could be demonstrated by witnesses, documents and monumental markers introduced 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             234 
 
into the landscape to structure its identity and affix title to it. Moreover, the Romans and 
the surveyors, who worked within their juridical and cultural influence, believed that 
ownership had to be fixed at a specific moment in time. This is what entailed the 
attachment of a name to a place, so that the first recognised owner could be identified 
and any change in ownership traced through time. This took the concept beyond the 
simple occupation of a place and its retention by force. Force was always an option and 
 some might say  the fundamental basis for ownership, but for the Romans law and 
the taxonomic categories of privilege created through nomenclature and the public 
recognition of names was far superior. 
To enter into this concept of ownership, the surveyors and all those who 
accepted their work recognised categories of names that constructed a hierarchy of 
control based on the validation, which could be obtained from physical features. The 
system of boundary-marking used on trees discussed in Chapter Two is an excellent 
example. A weak basis for a claim could be made by cutting down all the trees along a 
boundary except for one specific type, but a better claim could be made if the trees left 
standing were marked in some way. A better claim still was if the trees were 
specifically planted in a row. But the best visual proof found in trees was when they 
were planted in a row and marked. There were many other ways of proving a line of 
demarcation: ditches, rivers, roads and stones grouped or shaped to be distinctive 
features in the landscape. 
Whatever the system chosen might be, verbal witnesses who could testify to the 
nature of the marks or trees were good, but written documents which could be validated 
as testimony from the time when the property was established were better. Written texts, 
particularly those inscribed into metal or stone had a lasting quality that allowed people 
to communicate with those who were absent in time or space. 
Equally important was the ontological framework within which the surveyors 
structured boundaries and defined a section of the landscape as a place. Surveyors 
organised each place by moving through the landscape and visually connecting points 
formed from physical features that could be quantified. Every survey began as a fixed 
point or locus gromae to which surveyors could orient, align and connect all other 
points in a survey using the abstract principles of the straight, circular or irregularly 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             235 
 
curved line. To form circular or irregular lines from straight lines of sight, the points 
were interpolated using triangles. The lines of sight or rigores were the conceptual 
framework, which allowed surveyors to mentally structure space as place by organising 
disunited groups of physical objects in the real world into a perfectly ordered abstract 
pattern. To communicate that organisation to others, surveyors crafted the forma as a 
labelled diagram to transpose the inexact correspondence between imperfect real-world 
features in the landscape perceived through the senses and the abstract conception of 
those features as a place defined by labels and drawn lines of demarcation. As such, the 
forma, regardless of whether it depicted the temple-land at a city like Daulis or the 
entirety of the province of Lycia, was not a map in the modern sense. Rather it was a 
pictorial rendering of mathematically arranged features found in the landscape. It could 
not provide anyone with a guide for travel as an itinerary would, but as the documents 
from Daulis, Patara and Aphrodisias show, it allowed the viewer to construct and 
comprehend relationships between objects, places and people. The forma agrimensorum 
and its commentarium for example, allowed the viewer to comprehend the social and 
topographical relationships between individual land-holders in a community. 
As Frontinus shows in his discussion of the categories of land, the forma could 
further be used by surveyors to superimpose survey lines on the territory of a 
community that were not physically present in the landscape, or to introduce conceptual 
relationships between people for political or administrative purposes. The forma also 
allowed the viewer to situate the reality of a civic territory into a wider conception of a 
region by depicting the civic landscape oriented perfectly to an ideal north-south 
alignment and in relationship to the communities that surrounded it. On a larger scale, a 
forma could show how the relationship between cities united by roads and enclosed by 
boundaries or topographical features should be grouped together and understood as a 
province or even as the totality of the Empire. 
Reading such a document was a skilled art that only a few could do with 
discernment. Rather, what these documents represented in both their perishable and 
bronze or marble monumental forms was a concept of collective identity which was 
there to be viewed and discussed, but only rarely consulted. The surveyors ability to 
read these documents and others was one of the ways they validated their identity. Their 
style of walking, knowledge of topographical taxonomies and an ability to discuss 
Shaping the Roman Empire (VOL. 1)                                                                                                                             236 
 
mathematics while manipulating specialised instruments, such as the groma, were other 
characteristics that set them apart from most people, allowing those to judge ability and 
choose the best specialist of this craft for a given job. 
Of course, not everyone in the Roman world would have either understood or 
accepted the surveyors and their methods. As stated above in Section 5.4, the number of 
people in any given province who accepted and employed surveyors changed gradually 
over time. In the early stages of Roman expansion, only those few who had prior 
exposure to the Romans would have accepted the presence of surveyors without 
question. As time passed and the surveyors succeeded in negotiating power 
relationships between the Romans and themselves and between the Romans and the 
provincial population, more and more communities would have been willing to employ 
the services of the Roman surveyors to resolve problems. The epigraphic evidence 
suggests that by the time Alexander Severus died nearly all communities who claimed 
land or who made any effort to assert their influence, even if only at a local level on the 
edges of the Empire, had some experience with the Roman surveyors. Indeed, fresh 
evidence coming from the Nubian temples at Dehmit and the Iranian siege works at 
Dura Europos suggests that even non-Roman peoples beyond the frontiers employed 
surveyors trained in the Roman tradition to regulate boundaries and resolve engineering 
problems in the period between the accession of Vespasian and the accession of 
Gallienus (3rd century AD). 
For those peoples who were in contact with the Roman world and who could not 
understand or accept the Roman art of surveying, the surveyors ability to transform and 
represent the landscape would have been an incomprehensible and frightening force of 
domination reflecting a foreign power best avoided. For such people the impact of the 
surveyors work would have lasted only until the rearing of livestock and the growing 
of crops caused the markers and pathways to merge back into the landscape. They 
would not be calling upon the Roman land surveyors to resolve their problems. But for 
those who chose to engage with the surveyors, either to improve their lot with the 
Roman imperial administration or gain an advantage over their neighbours, the 
surveyors craft provided a powerful performative discourse, negotiated into their way 
of life, changing the landscape and those who lived in it forever.
