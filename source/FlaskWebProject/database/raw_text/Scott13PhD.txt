ABSTRACT
We present an analysis of the properties of jets in protonproton and leadlead
collisions at the ALICE experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, using the
technique of two-particle angular correlations. The data sample comprises proton
collisions at energies of
s = 7 TeV and
s = 2.76 TeV, and lead collisions at a
nucleonnucleon collision energy of
sNN = 2.76 TeV, from data taking periods in
2010 and 2011.
The jet width and transverse momentum imbalance, quantified by the jet fragmen-
tation transverse momentum jT and the net partonic transverse momentum kT re-
spectively, were studied in minimum bias proton collisions. The width was found to
be independent of hadron transverse momentum, with a value of
j2T  0.8 GeV.
This is higher than measurements from earlier experiments at lower beam energies,
consistent with theoretical expectations.
k2T was found to increase with collision
energy and also with the transverse momentum of the hadrons in the jet.
The dependence of jet yield on the produced multiplicity was studied in proton
and ion collisions, with the multiplicity providing an estimator for the ion colli-
sion centrality. The ratio of awayside to nearside yield was studied, with a view
to identifying suppression of jet momentum through interaction with a deconfined
quark-gluon plasma. This suppression was identified in lead collisions as expected
from previous results, but no suppression was observed in high multiplicity proton
collisions.
The jet width and transverse momentum imbalance were also studied as a function
of multiplicity, with the width quantified by jT and the imbalance quantified by the
correlation function awayside peak width. In proton collisions, the jet width was
measured to be
j2T  0.8 GeV independently of multiplicity; this was consistent
with the measurements in minimum bias collisions. No firm evidence of medium
effects was observed in measurements of the awayside peak width in proton or lead
collisions, but the jet width was observed to decrease in lead collisions of increasing
centrality. This was interpreted as a suppression of the high momentum hadrons in
the jets.
DECLARATION OF AUTHORS
CONTRIBUTION
It is the nature of research that no work is performed in isolation, and this work
would not have been possible were it not for the efforts of many others. In particular,
I could never have performed my analysis without the combined work of the many
people involved with every stage of the design, construction and operation of the
LHC and the ALICE experiment. Nevertheless, with that caveat the work presented
in this document is entirely my own and unless otherwise indicated, all figures and
results were produced by myself.
The bulk of my analysis work consisted of developing a framework for the construc-
tion of two-particle azimuthal correlation functions, which built upon official ALICE
analysis code, and for the extraction of relevant quantities from these correlation
functions. This is described in chapter 4, with the results in chapters 5, 6 and 7.
To extract the RMS net partonic transverse momentum
k2T from the measured
quantities, a Monte-Carlo model was developed. This is described in detail in ap-
pendix B. A Monte-Carlo model was also developed to determine the relationship
between collision centrality and particle multiplicity in leadlead collisions. This
model is described in appendix C.
In addition to my own work, I shared in the responsibilities of the operation of the
Central Trigger Processor (CTP) through undertaking shifts in the control room
whilst based at CERN, and also through acting as an on-call expert.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Over the past four years I have drawn help from many people, both in and out of
work. Here I would like to show my appreciation; if I have omitted anyone who
deserves to be mentioned then it is only through my own forgetfulness.
Firstly I would like to thank my supervisors, Roman Lietava and Peter Jones. With-
out their patient help and expert guidance I would doubtless not have come close to
completing the work presented here. I am also indebted to the rest of the staff in the
Birmingham ALICE group: David Evans, Orlando Villalobos-Baillie, Lee Barnby,
Cristina Lazzeroni, Anton Jusko, Marian Krivda, Gron Jones and Frank Votruba.
Special mention must go to David for his tireless support of the group (and for all of
the cigars and wine), and to Anton for tolerating my many phone calls in the small
hours of the morning as I frantically tried to fix trigger emergencies.
I have enjoyed sharing offices in Birmingham and at CERN with the other students of
the Birmingham ALICE group, in particular Arvinder Palaha and Plamen Petrov
whose help and advice I found invaluable. I would also like to thank the other
students of the group: Zoe Matthews, Ravjeet Kour, Sparsh Navin, Luke Hanratty,
Graham Lee and Didier Alexandre.
At CERN I benefited greatly from collaboration with Filip Krizek, Jan Rak and
Sami Rasanen, who shared with me their knowledge of correlation analysis and
Monte-Carlo modelling. I was also aided by Misha Ryskin and Valery Khoze, whose
expertise enhanced the theoretical interpretation of my results.
Outside of work, I cannot neglect to thank my friends at CERN, too numerous to
name, for all of the late nights, long days, ski trips, journeys across Europe and
general shenanigans that made my eighteen month stay in Geneva so fantastic. I
have also greatly enjoyed my time in the particle physics group and, more broadly, in
the School of Physics and Astronomy, and this is due in no small part to my friends
in Birmingham. Special mention is due to Rory Smith (who always maintained that
the pickle was implied), Tom McLaughlan and the denizens of West 316 (whose office
tennis court and other inventions provided a welcome distraction), Sarah Baker (for
giving me somewhere to live when I needed it), Pete Rothery, Brigid Jones, Jim
Smyth and everyone else. Ill miss you guys.
I would like to thank Paul Newman and Peter Watkins for giving me the chance to
join the particle physics research group, and the Science and Technology Facilities
Council for funding my PhD.
I would like to express my gratitude to my family, especially my parents Adam and
Hetty, for all of their help over the years, providing me with constant moral (and
occasional financial) support.
Finally I would like to thank Amy, for always being there.
So that no more with bitter sweat
I need to talk of what I dont know yet,
So that I may perceive whatever holds
The world together in its inmost folds.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
The present understanding of interactions in nature includes four fundamental forces:
gravity, electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear interactions. Gravity will
be omitted from this discussion as it is significantly weaker than the other three, and
its theoretical description proceeds along very different lines (although the possible
unification of gravity with the other forces is an open question in physics). The
other three interactions are described by the exchange of virtual bosons: photons
in the case of electromagnetism, W and Z0 bosons for the weak interaction, and
gluons for the strong interaction.
The quantum field theory of electromagnetism (quantum electrodynamics) and the
unified electroweak theory describe electromagnetic and weak interactions to great
precision, indeed quantum electrodynamics has been described as the jewel of
physics for the extreme accuracy of its predictions [1]. This is partly because
the small coupling constant means that not many terms in a perturbative expansion

are needed to provide a good degree of accuracy, and partly because the existence
of elementary charged and electroweakly interacting free particles (leptons) allows
precise experimental investigation. A classic example of this would be the precise
measurement of many electroweak variables at the Large ElectronPositron Col-
lider (LEP) [2]. Neither of these are the case for the strong interaction as, due to
the running of the strong coupling, perturbative expansions are not possible except
for interactions with a large transferred momentum, and also the property of con-
finement means that fundamental strongly interacting particles do not exist freely
in nature but exist instead in bound states.
1.1 Quantum chromodynamics
The strong interaction is the strongest of the four fundamental interactions and is
responsible for binding nucleons (protons and neutrons) together into atomic nuclei.
However, nucleons are not fundamental particles but are believed to be composed of
quarks, and it is also the strong interaction which binds these constituents together
to form the nucleons. Indeed, the constituent particles are exposed to the full
strong interaction, while the binding of atomic nuclei is due only to the residual
strong force between the nucleons.
The current accepted theoretical description of the strong interaction is the theory
of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). While similar to quantum electrodynamics
(QED) and electroweak theory in that it describes elemental particles carrying a
charge (the so-called colour charge in the case of QCD) interacting via the exchange
of virtual bosons, it has many important differences. Particularly important is that
the exchange bosons, gluons, carry colour charge [2]. This means that gluons can
self-interact, which fundamentally affects the properties of the interaction.
1.1. QUANTUM CHROMODYNAMICS 3
1.1.1 The quarkparton model
The theory of the strong interaction has its roots in the parton and quark models
of the 1960s. The parton model originated as particle accelerators began to be suf-
ficiently energetic for deep inelastic electronproton scattering to probe the internal
structure of nucleons [3]. It was subsequently shown by Bjorken that the observed
cross sections could be explained as evidence that nucleons were not elementary but
were in fact comprised of point-like partons [4].
At around the same time, the quark model was proposed independently by Gell-
Mann and Zweig [5, 6]. This was motivated by the large number of observed hadronic
(divided into bosonic mesons and fermionic baryons) states that had been discovered
over the preceding decade, which were considered to be too numerous to all be
fundamental.
The quark model explained these states as composite particles comprised of fraction-
ally charged, spin-1
quarks, along with their corresponding antiquarks; mesons
were described as quarkantiquark (qq) pairs, baryons as three quarks (qqq) and
antibaryons as three antiquarks (qqq). Three flavours of quarks were needed to
account for the observed combinations of charge, isospin (originally introduced in
response to the symmetries between the proton and neutron, and later generalised
to other hadrons) and strangeness (invoked to account for the long decay time of
the kaon relative to its mass); these were named the up (u), down (d) and strange
(s) quarks. The prediction and subsequent discovery of the  baryon, consisting of
three strange quarks, was strong evidence for the validity of the quark model [7]. It
was later discovered that in addition to the u, d and s quarks, there existed charm
(c), bottom (b) and top (t) quarks, with masses too high to be produced at 1960s
experiments. The quarks and their quantum numbers are summarised in table 1.1.
A problem for the quark model was the need to explain the discovery of the ++
baryon, which according to the model comprised three u quarks with parallel spins

and should thus have violated the Pauli exclusion principle. This problem was
averted with the introduction of an additional quantum number, which was not
observed in hadrons and thus must sum to zero for physical states. This quantum
number, with the symmetry described by the SU(3) group, was termed colour, with
each quark having a colour of red, green or blue and likewise with anti-
colours for the antiquarks. Physical hadron states are SU(3) singlets (colourless),
either by having equal numbers of all three colours of quark (for example a baryon
must have a red, a green and a blue quark), or by having each colour sum to zero (for
example a meson could have redantired, greenantigreen or blueantiblue quarks).
The quark and parton models were realised to be describing the same objects, and
together form the quarkparton model. Later deep inelastic electronnucleon scat-
tering experiments determined that hadrons can in fact contain large numbers of
quarks, gluons and antiquarks. However, the quarkparton model of flavour remains
valid with the observation that the net quark content of a given hadron obeys a sum
rule. A proton, for example, is in the quark model composed of (uud). Following the
sum rules, for a proton (u)  (u) = 2, (d)  (d) = 1, and for all other quark
flavours (q)  (q) = 0. These net quarks are termed valence quarks, and the
rest sea quarks. In QCD, the quarks are viewed as elementary fields, with hadrons
existing as bound states of these.
1.1. QUANTUM CHROMODYNAMICS 5
1.1.2 Confinement
Experimental investigation of the strong interaction is complicated by the fact that
elementary strongly interacting particles do not exist freely in nature but are bound
inside hadrons, a property known as confinement. As such, it is impossible to observe
an isolated scattering of coloured particles in the same way as, for example, electron
scattering provides a clean way to study the electroweak interaction. A description
of a widely studied QCD process that could be observed at a collider experiment
(hadronic jet production as a consequence of hard parton scattering) can be found
in section 2.1.
In QCD, the strong interaction is described in terms of the exchange of massless
bosons known as gluons. As stated in the introduction to this section, in contrast to
the uncharged photons in QED, gluons carry colour charge. This has consequences
when two quarks are pulled apart, and leads to the phenomenon of confinement.
To visualise this process it is instructive to consider the QCD colour field lines as
a function of separation, as shown in figure 1.1. At very short distances of much
less than the typical hadron size of 1 fm, the QCD potential behaves analogously
to the QED potential, with an r1 dependence (figure 1.1a). At longer distances,
approaching the hadron size, the gluon self-interaction pulls the gluons exchanged
between the quarks into a flux tube as shown in figure 1.1b. Here the field energy
per unit length is approximately constant, analogously to a stretched spring. Taking
into account both of these components, the strong potential VS has the form
VS = 
+ kr (1.1)
where S is the strong coupling, k is the tension of the flux tube and r is the
separation of the quarks.
At even larger separations of greater than 1 fm, it becomes more energetically

c) At even longer range, it becomes more energetically favourable for a new qq pair to be

favourable for a new qq pair to be produced from the field energy and the flux
tube breaks, leading to two separate hadrons, which are individually confined.
Despite this picture of confinement, to date there has been no analytic proof that
QCD should be confining. However, due to the lack of any observation of bound
coloured states, it is generally accepted.
As well as defining hadron size to around 1 fm, the majority of hadron mass also
arises from confinement: nucleons have mass of the order of 1 GeV, while the bare
quark mass is expected to be of the order of 1 MeV (although there is no way to
directly measure this at present).
1.1.3 Asymptotic freedom
The strong coupling S, used to define the strength of the strong interaction, is not
in fact constant but varies with separation r. Due to the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle, this is equivalent to a dependence on transferred four-momentum q. This
arises due to quantum vacuum fluctuations and related effects occur in both QED
and QCD.
1.1. QUANTUM CHROMODYNAMICS 7
In QED, virtual electronpositron pairs can appear from the vacuum and act as
dipoles, being polarised by the presence of a real charge (such as a real electron).
These act to shield the field of the real charge which results in its measured charge
increasing asymptotically with the momentum of a probe, or equivalently with de-
creasing separation. The electron charge is typically taken as its value measured at
infinity, with the QED coupling  running, that is to say increasing with decreas-
ing separation (or alternatively with increasing q).
A similar effect is present for QCD with virtual qq pairs shielding a bare colour charge
but, due to the gluon self-interaction, gluon loops arise as well as qq loops. This leads
to the net gluon contribution being in fact an anti-shielding which dominates over
the qq shielding, with the net effect being that S decreases with smaller separation
(or equivalently, S decreases with increasing q).
As the coupling increases with separation, it cannot be scaled with respect to the
coupling at infinity, as is done with QED, but must instead be defined relative to
the coupling at a reference scale . From quantum field theory, this leads to the
expression for S(Q
2), where Q2 = q2:
1 + 0S(2) ln
) (1.2)
where 0 =
(2nq  11nc), nq,c being the number of quark and colour degrees of
freedom. For QCD, with six quark flavours and three colours, 0 =  74 . This is
usually expressed in terms of the QCD scale constant 2QCD = 
2 exp [1/0S(2)]
which can be thought of as the scale at which the coupling becomes large. Defining
also the positive quantity b = 0, equation 1.2 simplifies to [9]
b ln(Q2/2QCD)
. (1.3)
From this equation the running of S is apparent. For Q
2  QCD, corresponding
1.2. QUARKGLUON PLASMA 8
to small separation, S  1 and thus the interaction can be treated perturbatively,
much as in QED. This is the basis for perturbative QCD (pQCD), which has
had much success in calculating, for example, cross sections for various hard (high
Q2) QCD processes [9]. However, at low Q2 of the order of 2QCD and lower, S
becomes large and a perturbative expansion is impossible. Instead, non-perturbative
techniques must be used, such as lattice QCD; this approach formulates QCD on a
discrete spacetime lattice of finite size, with quarks defined on the sites and gluons
on the links [10]. Monte-Carlo techniques can then be applied to solve such a system
numerically.
Measurements of S at a range of Q
2 values are shown in figure 1.2 and from these
it has been determined that QCD  0.2 GeV, which is equivalent to a distance of
roughly 1 fm. This is what constrains hadron size to this scale.
If one takes the running of S to its logical conclusion, it becomes apparent that at
asymptotically large Q2, S(Q
2)  0; hence the partons behave as if free, as first
predicted by Gross, Wilczek and Politzer [11, 12]. This phenomenon is known as
asymptotic freedom.
1.2 Quarkgluon plasma
The phenomenon of asymptotic freedom, as described in section 1.1.3, applies to
partons at close separation within a hadron. However, it also leads to the conclu-
sion that at extremely high energy density, bulk hadronic matter would become
deconfined with partons able to propagate freely through the medium. In such a
system of independent partons, hadrons would cease to exist [13]. This state of
matter is commonly referred to as quarkgluon plasma (QGP), and according to
big bang cosmology the universe was likely in such a state before t  10 s [14].

1.2.1 Debye screening
Deconfinement can occur in a dense medium, at lower energy densities than would
be required to reach the asymptotic limit, by a screening process analogous to the
Debye screening of electric charges in an electromagnetic plasma. Much as the
presence of mobile electric charges screens the field of a point charge in an electro-
magnetic plasma, mobile colour charges cause screening in a nuclear medium heated
or compressed to sufficient density that the nucleon boundaries begin to overlap.
Due to this colour charge screening, individual partons interact only with other par-
tons within the screening length, which is inversely proportional to the cube root of
the energy density. As this length becomes comparable to the mean separation, the
partons behave as if free.
Taking only the Coulomb-like (short range) part of equation 1.1 and including Debye

screening gives
VS  
 exp
rD(T )
(1.4)
where rD(T ) is the Debye screening radius, which characterises the separation within
which colour charges interact with each other [15]. It is dependent on the temper-
ature of the system, being infinite at low temperature (implying no screening) and
becoming shorter with increasing temperature over a critical temperature TC. When
rD(T ) becomes smaller than the hadronic radius, bound hadrons cease to exist. Due
to this screening effect, nuclear matter can undergo a transition to a deconfined
QGP state at a lower energy density than would be required for an asymptotically
free QGP.
As S can still not be assumed to be small in this case, perturbative calculations
cannot be used. Instead, non-perturbative methods must be applied to model the
properties of a non-asymptotically-free QGP. Particularly useful is lattice QCD,
which has been used extensively to calculate thermodynamic properties of the QGP
such as the critical temperature of the phase transition.
1.2. QUARKGLUON PLASMA 11
Lattice QCD calculations of the critical temperature TC depend on the number
of quark flavours considered, among other parameters, but generally yield con-
clusions that TC  170 MeV with a corresponding critical energy density C 
1 GeV/fm3 [16]. QGP energy densities from such calculations, for various numbers
of quark flavours, are shown in figure 1.3. The phase transition to a QGP state is
clearly visible at T = TC.
Typically, the produced energy density is quantified by the Bjorken energy density
Bj =
(1.5)
where dET/dy is the transverse energy per unit rapidity (which can be related to
the produced multiplicity of charged particles), ST is the transverse overlap area of
the colliding nuclei and  is the plasma formation time [17]. Rapidity is defined
in appendix A. In
sNN = 0.2 TeV goldgold collisions at the Relativistic Heavy
Ion Collider (RHIC), a measurement was made of Bj = 5.2 0.4 GeV/fm2 which,
assuming a formation time  < 1 fm/c, gives an energy density of at least sev-
eral GeV/fm3, well in excess of the critical energy density as predicted by lattice
QCD [18].
Increased beam energy leads to a higher energy density and indeed measurements at
the ALICE experiment at the LHC indicate values of Bj  15 GeV in central lead
lead collisions [19]. As such, QGP is believed to be accessible to modern collider
experiments.

and antiquarks (although it does not give an absolute measurement of density). For
B  0 lattice QCD can be used, and the rest of the diagram is deduced from QCD
phenomenology and equilibrium thermodynamics. The diagram shows the distinc-
tion between confined hadronic matter and deconfined QGP, and it is expected that
the phase transition between these states is a crossover type at low B and first
order at higher B, with a critical point existing. However, this is not yet fully
established [20].
Cold nuclear matter is shown at low-T , B  900 MeV, and QCD vacuum exists
in the limit of T, B  0. Conditions expected at various past and present heavy
ion collider experiments are marked, which tend to increased T and lower B with
increasing energy. The early universe is presumed to have existed in the extreme high
T , low B position on the diagram with enormous temperature and approximately
equal quark and antiquark densities.
1.3. EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCTION OF QGP 13
Figure 1.5: Simulation of a heavy ion collision [21].
There also exists a phase transition to deconfined matter at low T and high B,
which could occur in matter of very high pressure. This high pressure, (relatively)
low temperature matter is theorised to possibly exist in the core of compact stellar
objects such as neutron stars and hypothetical quark stars. However, such a system
is inaccessible to current experiments.
1.3 Experimental production of QGP
1.3.1 Relativistic heavy ion collisions
As stated in section 1.2.2, ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions can be used to pro-
duce a high temperature, low baryon chemical potential QGP, similar to (but less
extremely so than) that of the early universe. At these experiments, the nuclei of
heavy elements are accelerated to high energy and collided inside detectors to record
the produced particles.
Figure 1.5 shows a simulation of a heavy ion collision. The nuclei impact each other
as Lorentz contracted pancakes which experience nucleonnucleon collisions but
do not stop in the centre of mass frame. As they pass through each other, they
produce a hot dense region between them which rapidly expands and cools. The
system then freezes out into hadrons, which pass into the detector and can be
detected. The energy density  is not directly measurable, but it is correlated with
the number and average energy of particles produced at mid-rapidity (around 90

to the beam direction) as indicated by equation 1.5.
A more detailed depiction of the post-collision time evolution of system is shown
in figure 1.6. The initial pre-equilibrium (t < 0) stage is thought to be dominated
by hard (high Q2) parton scattering. Multiple parton scatterings then take place,
driving the system to an equilibrated QGP phase. The expansion is then driven by
hydrodynamic pressure.
As the system expands it cools, with hadrons re-forming as the temperature drops
below TC. At LHC energies of 2.76 TeV per nucleon, this occurs at a time approx-
imately 10 fm/c after the initial collision [23]. Shortly after this, the temperature
falls below the chemical freeze-out temperature Tch, after which inelastic scattering
does not occur and the hadron species ratios are fixed. Finally, the temperature
drops below the kinetic freeze-out temperature Tf0 and no more elastic scattering
can occur. Barring any subsequent weak decays, the hadrons then pass unchanged
to the detectors.
1.3. EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCTION OF QGP 15
1.3.2 High multiplicity proton collisions
So far this section has described QGP production in heavy ion collisions, which
is well established. The systems produced in proton collisions are typically too
dilute and small in volume for thermalisation to occur and for QGP to be produced.
However, it has been suggested that it may be possible to produce sufficient energy
densities for QGP production in a subset of proton collisions in which a suitably
large number of particles are produced (as the energy density is correlated with the
multiplicity) [24, 25].
Studies of this have been performed at previous experiments, but have thus far
yielded inconclusive results [26]. Much greater multiplicities are produced at Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) energies, which may imply the production of QGP in the
highest multiplicity collisions. The mean charged particle multiplicity has been
measured in 7 TeV proton collisions to be dNch/dy = 6.01  0.01+0.200.12 [27] but
the highest produced multiplicities, reaching values of around dNch/dy  60, are
comparable to the multiplicities observed in 200 GeV/nucleon copper collisions at
RHIC at which measurable QGP effects were observed [28].
There has also been an observation of an extended ridge structure in dihadron
azimuthpseudorapidity () correlations in 7 TeV proton collisions at the
LHC [29]. While not yet fully understood, a similar feature was observed in gold
collisions at RHIC and so there is interest in whether this could be indicative of
QGP production [30]. Whether this observation implies the production of QGP in
proton collisions is still debated [31, 32].
If QGP were produced in a proton collision, the initial size would be significantly
smaller than that produced in a heavy ion collision, as the proton transverse size
(roughly 1 fm) is an order of magnitude smaller than that of a heavy ion. This,
combined with the shorter lifetime that results from the smaller size, would lead
observable QGP signatures (described in section 1.4) to be less apparent, although
1.4. SIGNATURES OF QUARKGLUON PLASMA PRODUCTION 16
still potentially measurable [25].
1.3.3 Experimental history
Various experimental facilities have been built to attempt to create QGP through
heavy ion collisions. While there were earlier attempts at the Alternating Gradient
Synchrotron (AGS), the first indications of QGP production were found at fixed
target experiments at the CERN SPS [33], which studied leadlead collisions at a
centre of mass energy per nucleon of 19.4 GeV. The peak energy density achieved
was estimated to be around 3 GeV/fm3.
The next experimental facility was the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at
Brookhaven National Laboratory, a beambeam collider which produced goldgold,
coppercopper, protonproton and deuterongold collisions at various centre of mass
energies per nucleon up to 200 GeV, producing an estimated energy density well in
excess of the critical density [18]. A wider range of QGP signatures were observed,
which provided greater confidence that QGP had indeed been produced and allowed
a more detailed study of its properties [34].
Currently operating is the CERN LHC which, in addition to its protonproton
program, collides lead nuclei up to a current maximum centre of mass energy per
nucleon of 2.76 TeV, producing a longer-lived and hotter plasma than previously. A
Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) is optimised to study heavy ion collisions
at this collider.
1.4 Signatures of quarkgluon plasma production
Various experimental observables have been proposed as signatures to identify the
production of QGP as opposed to a hot hadronic gas. Typically, these involve mea-
1.4. SIGNATURES OF QUARKGLUON PLASMA PRODUCTION 17
suring the same observable in minimum bias protonproton collisions (the ALICE
minimum bias trigger is described in section 3.2.6) on the assumption that gener-
ally the systems produced are too small to form a QGP. Comparison is then made
with heavy ion collisions to identify differences that cannot merely be explained as
a superposition of nucleonnucleon collisons.
Significant observables include enhanced strange particle yield, charmonium sup-
pression, suppression of high momentum particles and hydrodynamic flow. The
first two were first observed at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), and the second
two were important discoveries at RHIC [34].
1.4.1 Enhanced strange particle yield
One of the key pieces of evidence for the production of QGP at the SPS was the
increased production of strange particles (hadrons containing at least one strange
quark or antiquark) in nuclear collisions compared with hadronic collisions [33].
This was expected in QGP as the strange quark mass is of similar magnitude to the
QGP transition temperature of 170 MeV and so many strange quarks are produced
through scattering subprocesses. The dominant subprocess at SPS energies (and
above) is gluon-gluon fusion gg  ss [35].
Strangeness production occurs as a result of the partonic rescattering that drives
the system to equilibrium. Analysis of strangeness production rates can therefore
provide insight into the equilibration process, an example being at the SPS where it
was discovered that the system typically reaches chemical equilibrium after times of
the order of 5 fm/c. A system with hadronic degrees of freedom rather than partonic
would take around ten times as long to equilibrate via hadron rescattering, and as
such would disperse too quickly for this to occur. [35].
After the system cools below TC, the strange quarks hadronise to form strange
1.4. SIGNATURES OF QUARKGLUON PLASMA PRODUCTION 18
hadrons in greater numbers than would be expected in the absence of QGP.
1.4.2 Charmonium suppression
A consequence of the high charm quark mass is that the production of cc pairs
tends to occur mainly in the early stages of a heavy ion collision. In a medium of
sufficient temperature, the Debye screening radius rD(T ) becomes smaller than the
relatively large size of bound cc states, such as the J/. This suppresses the observed
production of these states, whilst production of D and D0 states is enhanced due
to the free charm quarks [36].
J/ suppression has been measured to be of a similar degree at SPS [37] and
RHIC [38] energies. While some degree of suppression would be expected in the
absence of a QGP due to cold nuclear matter effects such as hadronic rescattering,
the magnitude of these effects was studied in deuterongold collisions at RHIC and
was determined to be insufficient to account for the observed suppression in ionion
collisions [39].
Measurements at ALICE at the LHC have indicated the suppression at these energies
to be less than that observed at earlier experiments [40]. This is believed to be a
consequence of the higher energy densities produced at the LHC, which enhances the
production of cc pairs. These deconfined quarks are then subject to recombination
during hadronisation, which partially compensates for the screening suppression
effect [41, 42].
1.4.3 Hydrodynamic flow
Due to the size of heavy nuclei, heavy ion collisions are not typically head-on but
instead occur with a degree of overlap. This overlap is quantified by centrality,
1.4. SIGNATURES OF QUARKGLUON PLASMA PRODUCTION 19
Figure 1.7: Schematic diagram of colliding heavy ions, showing a non-central collision
with the interaction plane labelled [44].
ranging from 0%100% where 0% is the most central (head-on) and 100% is the
most peripheral. A three-dimensional view of this, with the reaction plane (the
plane defined by the centres of the colliding nuclei and the beam direction) labelled,
is shown in figure 1.7. This spatial anisotropy leads to a larger energy density
gradient in the reaction plane than perpendicular to it, and hence a larger pressure
gradient in this plane [43].
Hydrodynamically, the difference in pressure gradient results in a momentum anisotropy
in the final state particle distribution, with particles emitted in the reaction plane
having higher pT than those emitted perpendicular to it. This can be measured
from the observed particle pT distribution as a function of azimuth. This can be
characterised as a Fourier series, the most important component being the second
harmonic v2 which measures the anisotropy between the reaction plane and the
perpendicular. This is termed elliptic flow [43].
Measurements of v2 are typically compared with predictions from relativistic hydro-
dynamics, assuming a QGP equation of state with quark degrees of freedom. These
predictions were shown to describe the data well for lower momentum particles at
RHIC [46] and at the LHC [47, 48], providing strong evidence for the production of

QGP; indeed the success of these models has led to the description of the QGP as
a perfect liquid with very small viscosity.
Figure 1.8 shows such a comparison for identified particles at ALICE, clearly ex-
hibiting the dependence of v2 on particle type and the accurate description of this
by a current state-of-the-art relativistic hydrodynamic model, with colour-glass
condensate (CGC) initial conditions. The models are not generally applicable at
high pT, where particle production is dominated by the scattering of hard partons
and their interaction with the medium.
1.4.4 Suppression of high transverse momentum particles
Another key QGP signature is the suppression of particles of high transverse momen-
tum pT. The main production mechanism for high pT hadron production at hadron
colliders is jet production, where hard-scattered partons hadronise into collimated
cones of hadrons known as jets. Typically this results in pairs of jets (dijets) that

are approximately opposite in azimuth (although not in polar angle as the centre
of mass frame of the partonparton collision is generally boosted with respect to
the lab frame, as described in appendix A). A simple picture of this is shown in
figure 1.9. This observation forms a large part of this thesis and so jet production
will be discussed in greater detail later.
Hard scattering in heavy ion collisions occurs early in the timeline of the collision,
but the pT of the scattered partons is expected to be significantly attenuated by
radiative interactions with the medium; an overview of this attenuation is provided
in section 2.2. Due to the reduced pT of the fragmenting parton, the produced
hadrons also have reduced pT and so this effect is visible as a reduction in the
yield of high pT particles when normalised by the number of nucleon collisions and
compared with proton collisions at the same centre of mass energy.
Typically the suppression is quantified with the nuclear modification factor RAA.
This is defined as the ratio of the charged particle yield in heavy ion (AA) collisions
1.4. SIGNATURES OF QUARKGLUON PLASMA PRODUCTION 22
to that in pp collisions, the yield from proton collisions being scaled by the mean
number of binary nucleonnucleon collisions in the ion collisions Ncoll [49]:
RAA(pT) =

(1.6)
where  is the pseudorapidity as defined in appendix A and NAAevt , N
evt are the
number of ion and proton events, respectively. Ncoll is calculated from a model
incorporating the nuclear overlap and nucleonnucleon cross sections. A model
of this type, used in this analysis to determine the relationship between observed
particle multiplicity and collision centrality, is outlined in appendix C.
Thus, a lack of suppression at a given pT would be implied by RAA(pT) = 1, which
would suggest that ion collisions could be viewed as simple superpositions of proton
collisions. Observations of RAA < 1 would indicate suppression. Figure 1.10 shows
measurements of RAA for a range of pT at the ALICE [49] experiment at the LHC
and the STAR [50] and PHENIX [51] experiments at RHIC. This shows RAA values
of significantly less than 1, implying a high degree of suppression. It is apparent that
more significant suppression was observed at ALICE than at the RHIC experiments,
which is interpreted as a consequence of the hotter, longer lived plasma produced
at the LHC compared to that produced at RHIC.
As with the charmonium suppression described in section 1.4.2, the possibility of
the high pT suppression being caused by cold nuclear matter effects such as gluon
shadowing or hadronic scattering was investigated at RHIC through the analysis of
deuterongold collisions. The lack of suppression in these events provided strong
evidence that the observed suppression in heavy ion collisions was indeed indicative
of QGP production [52]. A protonlead collision program was underway at the LHC
at the time of writing with the aim of validating the suppression measurements in
a similar way.

collisions at ALICE (LHC) and STAR and PHENIX (RHIC) [49].
1.4.5 Jet quenching
Section 1.4.4 describes the general suppression of high pT particles in heavy ion
collisions. However, the degree of attenuation depends on the position and direction
of the parton within the geometry of the system: a parton produced by a hard
scatter near the edge of a volume of QGP and directed out of the medium would
have a shorter path length and suffer less energy loss than one traversing a greater
length of plasma.
As depicted in figure 1.11, jet quenching arises when a hard parton is produced in
a QGP volume, leading to a reduction in jet pT due to the interaction of the parton
with the medium. When a hard parton pair is produced near the edge of the volume,
one parton may be directed out of the medium and one azimuthally opposite, as
shown in the figure. As the first parton is not greatly suppressed, a high pT jet is still
observed in this direction. However, the greater energy loss from the other parton
1.4. SIGNATURES OF QUARKGLUON PLASMA PRODUCTION 24
Figure 1.11: Simplified representation of radiative parton energy loss leading to jet quench-
ing, with the observed jets having a momentum asymmetry.
leads to a jet with significantly lower pT such that a jet momentum asymmetry is
observed.
In general it is difficult to fully reconstruct jets in heavy ion collisions as the jet
energies are typically not sufficiently high to be distinguished from the background;
because of this, jet studies have been performed using two-particle angular cor-
relations. In such an analysis, the distribution of angular difference  between
particles in defined trigger and associated pT ranges is produced. Given suf-
ficiently high pT bins, in pp collisions this produces a characteristic shape of two
peaks, centred at  = 0 and  = , atop a flat non-jet background (which is
generally subtracted). This shape appears as a consequence of azimuthally opposite
dijet production. However, a pT asymmetry in the jets, due to jet quenching, can
lead to the suppression of the awayside ( = ) peak; this technique was used
to provide firm evidence for jet quenching at RHIC [52]. A more comprehensive
description of a two-particle correlation analysis is presented in section 4.4.
The degree of this attenuation can be described by the ratio of dihadron yields IAA.

where YAA and Ypp are the yields of hadrons associated with the high pT trigger in
ion and proton collisions. Typically this quantity is constructed separately for the
nearside (  0) and awayside (  ) peaks, with the difference between these
expressing the relative degree of suppression of the awayside jets. Measurements of
jet quenching and of the single particle suppression RAA are sensitive to different
properties of the medium, for example through the parent parton of an awayside
jet necessarily traversing a greater path length through the medium. As such, their
combined study allows effective constraint of jet quenching models [53, 54].
Figure 1.12 shows an early measurement in PbPb and pp collisions at ALICE
at the LHC [55]. The awayside peak in peripheral (60%90% centrality) PbPb
is shown to match that for pp. However, the peak in central (0%5% centrality)
PbPb is suppressed with respect to pp. This suppression indicates the effect of jet
quenching. The  = 0 peak is not suppressed in central PbPb as the requirement
of trigger particles in a given high transverse momentum range preferentially
selects events where the jet production occurs near the surface of the QGP volume
and thus one jet escapes mostly unattenuated. In the plot shown, this peak can in
fact be seen to be enhanced in central PbPb with respect to pp; the mechanism
for this enhancement is not yet well understood.
It has also been suggested that the degree of acoplanarity of a dijet pair with respect
to the beam trajectory could be increased as a consequence of interaction of the jets
with the medium [56, 57, 58, 59]. The degree of acoplanarity can be determined from
the net transverse momentum of a jet pair, which can be extracted from two-particle
angular correlations.
At modern hadron collider experiments it is more usual to analyse jets by identifying
and reconstructing them on an event-by-event basis. At LHC energies, jets in heavy

1.5. OVERVIEW OF THESIS 27
ion collisions are in fact energetic enough that it may be possible to accurately re-
construct them. However, due to the large number of non-jet background particles
overlapping with the jet this is still challenging, and correlations remain a valu-
able technique which allows comprehensive comparison with results from previous
experiments.
When taken in combination, measurements of the signatures described in this section
provide convincing evidence that a deconfined quark-gluon plasma state is produced
in heavy ion collisions at the energies of modern experiments.

Chapter 2 reviews the theoretical background of jet production in proton and ion col-
lisions, including more detail regarding parton attenuation in a deconfined medium
than is given in this introduction. Chapter 3 discusses the ALICE experiment at the
LHC, at which the analysed data was taken, with particular emphasis given to the
detector subsystems relevant to this analysis. The details of the dihadron correlation
analysis are then described in chapter 4, including the construction of the correla-
tion functions and the extraction of interesting physical quantities from these. The
results of this analysis are then given in chapters 5, 6 and 7. The conclusions drawn
from the results are reviewed in chapter 8, and some additional technical details
regarding the analysis are presented in appendices: appendix A outlines some kine-
matic quantities used widely throughout this document, and appendices B and C
contain descriptions of the Monte-Carlo models used in the analysis.
CHAPTER 2
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Jets in protonproton collisions
High pT hadron production in high energy particle collisions, at both e
+e and
hadron colliders, is characterised by jet production. Jets originate from the pro-
duction of a pair of high momentum coloured particles which, due to confine-
ment, fragment into collimated jets of hadrons. In e+e collisions, the initial (pre-
fragmentation) event involves the production of a qq pair via an intermediate photon
or Z boson through the process e+e  /Z0  qq.
In hadron collisions, the coloured particle pair is produced through the hard inelastic
scattering of the constituent partons of the colliding hadrons, with all possible parton
scattering processes contributing to the overall cross section. These constituents can
be valence quarks, sea quarks or gluons. By way of example, a diagram showing a

gluongluon scattering is shown in figure 2.1.
Hard (high momentum transfer) processes, where the strong coupling S is small (as
described in section 1.1.3), can be well described by pQCD in much the same way
that electroweak theory can be used to describe processes such as e+e scattering.
The parton scattering subprocesses fall into this category. However, the momentum
distributions of the initial partons within the hadron are incalculable with pQCD
as they arise from many soft processes. Despite this, the scattering cross section is
independent of the initial parton momentum distribution and the process can be fac-
torised into separate components. Because of this, given a suitable parameterisation
of this distribution, the dijet production cross section can be calculated [60, 61].
The momentum distribution of the initial partons is described by parton distribu-
tion functions PDF(i, x,Q2), where i denotes the type of parton and x the hadron
momentum fraction carried by that parton. PDFs are experimentally determined

from deep inelastic electronproton scattering at the H1 and ZEUS experiments at
HERA [62]. This shows the relative proportion of the different parton types. The
fractions of proton momentum carried by valence up quarks, valence down quarks,
sea quarks and gluons are given by xuv, xdv, xS and xg, respectively. It can clearly
be seen that valence quarks contribute significantly at high x, and gluons (and, to
a lesser extent, sea quarks) dominate at low x.
The convolution of the PDFs with the hard scattering cross-sections gives the hard
parton production cross-section and therefore, as these partons fragment into jets
of hadrons, the dijet production cross section. The next stage in the jet production
process is the fragmentation of the outgoing partons into hadrons. Fragmentation
occurs due to confinement and can be visualised in terms of the stretching of gluon
flux tubes between partons, as described in section 1.1.2, which repeatedly produce
extra parton pairs that together form a jet of hadrons.
The hadrons that form the jet share the momentum of the parent parton and thus

form a collimated cone shape about the parton momentum axis, with the relative
pT of a hadron to its parent parton termed jT (with y component in the azimuthal
plane) as shown in figure 2.3. As with the PDFs, the fragmentation process is
governed by soft QCD and cannot be calculated perturbatively. The results of
parton fragmentation are instead described by empirical fragmentation functions
D(h, z,Q2), which give the probability distribution for the production of hadrons
h with momentum fraction z of the parent parton. Assuming the fragmentation
process to be independent of both the hard parton production and of the proton
collision underlying event, the fragmentation functions can be measured in the com-
paratively clean environment of e+e collisions and the results applied to hadron
collider physics [63].
This principle of the independence of the fragmentation function and hard cross
section (and also of the PDFs) is known as factorisation and is an important QCD
concept. The main consequence of factorisation is that the empirical fragmentation
functions and PDFs can be determined separately and convolved with the hard scat-
tering cross section, calculated using pQCD, to give the overall hadron production

2.1.1 The kT effect
If parton collisions were collinear with the pp collision axis, the two emerging par-
tons in a hard scattering event would have equal transverse momentum and opposite
azimuth. Any initial partonic pT, denoted kT, would cause a deviation from this,
with the scattered partons having net transverse momentum p2Tpair = 2  k
T. It
might be navely expected that the partons would have kT  300 MeV, due to the
size of the proton [64]. However, this was observed [65] to not be the case, and
a study by the CERN-Columbia-Oxford-Rockefeller (CCOR) collaboration found
kT to be dependent on the centre of mass energy
s and to have a value as high
as |kTy|  0.8 GeV (giving
k2T  1.1 GeV from the geometric relationship
k2T =
|kTy|, where kTy is the component of kT perpendicular to the trans-
verse momentum of the other hard parton (typically this is defined relative to the
highest pT parton) [66]) for the highest energy collisions at the Intersecting Storage
Rings (ISR), with
s = 62 GeV [67].
Measurements of kT were subsequently performed at other experiments, the results
of many of which are collected in figure 2.4 [66]. This demonstrates clearly that
kT is both significantly larger than the nave expectation and that it increases,
approximately logarithmically, with
It was subsequently realised that the only satisfactory explanation for this behaviour
was that kT had a radiative origin (in addition to the intrinsic part already expected).
2.1. JETS IN PROTONPROTON COLLISIONS 33
Figure 2.4: Net pair pT measurements in proton collisions over a range of

a clear dependence [66].
It is now understood that kT is composed of three components
k2T = k
Tintrinsic + k
TNLO + k
Tsoft (2.1)
where intrinsic refers to the aforementioned component of roughly 300 MeV due
to the proton size, NLO refers to next to leading order corrections (the radiation
of an initial or final state hard gluon) and soft refers to the QCD radiation of
soft gluons, which is explained by resummation [68]. It was found by the E706
collaboration at Fermilab that the observed kT values cannot be explained by the
intrinsic and NLO components alone, and that the soft component is essential to
explain the observations. Indeed, it is believed that at collider energies the soft
component is dominant [69].

2.2 Jets in heavy ion collisions
It is assumed that hard parton scattering in heavy ion collisions should behave
the same as in proton collisions and so, assuming the usage of appropriate PDFs
(modified to take into account the effects of the nuclear medium), it is possible to
calculate a dijet cross section in much the same way as for proton collisions. However,
the evolution of the system after the initial hard scattering takes place in a medium
very different from the vacuum of proton collisions. Significant suppression of high
pT particles (and jets) is expected relative to the yield observed in pp collisions,
indeed this suppression is regarded as a signature of the production of QGP (as
introduced in section 1.4).
Colour charges (partons) traversing a colour-deconfined medium are expected to lose
energy through interactions with that medium, with those interactions being either
collisional or radiative. Collisional energy loss was the first type to be considered (by
Bjorken [70]), with interactions of this type involving the scattering of fast partons
from thermal quarks and gluons in the medium as depicted in figure 2.5a.
The other type of energy loss is radiative energy loss. Fast partons lose energy in
2.2. JETS IN HEAVY ION COLLISIONS 35
this manner by interacting with scattering centres and emitting gluon radiation,
in a manner analogous to the emission of bremsstrahlung photons in electromag-
netic plasmas. A representation of such an interaction is shown in figure 2.5b [71].
All models of radiative parton energy loss must include the Landau-Pomeranchuk-
Migdal effect, whereby gluon radiation is suppressed due to interaction between the
parton and the radiated gluon [72, 59].
As well as energy loss, as stated in section 1.4.5 it has been suggested that medium
interactions could increase the acoplanarity of a jet pair with respect to the beam
trajectory [56, 57, 58, 59]. Any acoplanarity is measurable as a non-zero kTy, and so
measuring the pT imbalance in heavy ion collisions could provide a measure of the
degree of suppression.
2.2.1 Parton attenuation models
The first main approach to modelling radiative parton energy loss, known as BDMPS
(Baier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peigne-Schiff), models attenuation by the emission of
multiple soft gluons [72]. The second, known as GLV (Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev) mod-
els instead the emission of one or a small number of hard gluons [73]. Typically
in either of these approaches, for a finite volume of QGP, the parton energy loss is
not strongly dependent on the initial parton energy (except for it setting an upper
bound on the total energy loss).
The models differ regarding the thickness of plasma that they describe. BDMPS
calculations assume that the plasma is relatively thick and static, with the hard
partons being sufficiently energetic that the path length traversed L (defined by the
size of the plasma) is less than a critical length L < Lcr =
gE/2, where g is
the radiated gluon mean free path and  = 1/RDebye is the Debye screening mass of
the medium. In models of this type the energy loss E is proportional to L2.
2.2. JETS IN HEAVY ION COLLISIONS 36
In contrast, GLV calculations are applicable to thin plasmas which are not signif-
icantly larger than the mean free path, where the BDMPS approximations do not
apply. In this situation it is appropriate to assume that only a small number of
gluon emissions take place [73]. From this model it can be shown that E  L.
The other main radiative energy loss formalisms are higher twist (HT) [74] and
Arnold-Moore-Yaffe (AMY) [75], both of which attempt to create a fuller quantum
field theoretic approach. AMY in particular is based entirely on pQCD, with the
consequence that it is limited to describing only plasmas of very high temperature
T  TC [59].
The models of parton energy loss outlined above generally relate the energy loss
to primary model parameters which characterise the medium. For example, in the
BDMPS approach the energy loss is related to the transport coefficient q = q2T/L,
where q2T is the transverse energy squared transferred to the traversing parton. This
is in turn related to the gluon density in the medium. The primary parameters in
the other models, for example the opacity (related to the screening length and mean
free path) in the case of the GLV approach, are typically translated into effective
transport coefficients [59].
Figure 2.6 shows measurements of parton energy loss, quantified by RAA, from the
ALICE experiment alongside results from various models [49, 76]. It can be seen
that it is difficult to discriminate between the different models by studying RAA
alone, as the data are well described by both purely collisional and purely radiative
models. This is attributed to the dependence of RAA on the initial conditions and
evolution of the system, which cannot be solely characterised by the (effective)
transport coefficient [77].
These models describe the general suppression of high pT particles in heavy ion
collisions. However, the dependence on path length leads to the conclusion that the
degree of attenuation depends on the position and direction of the parton within

the geometry of the system: a parton produced by a hard scatter near the edge of
a volume of QGP and directed out of the medium would have a shorter path length
and suffer less energy loss than one traversing a greater length of plasma. This can
lead to a measurable jet momentum asymmetry, as described in section 1.4.5.
This dependence on path length also has consequences for the potential observation
of QGP in proton collisions, which is described in section 1.3.2. If QGP production
were to occur in such collisions, the volume would be very small compared with that
produced in heavy ion collisions and as such, parton path lengths would be small
and the degree of quenching would not be as great. This would make it harder to
observe.
CHAPTER 3
THE ALICE EXPERIMENT AT THE
This chapter describes the LHC, a particle accelerator at CERN on the French-
Swiss border, in section 3.1. The ALICE experiment at the LHC is then described
in section 3.2, with particular emphasis on the subsystems which are relevant to the
two-particle correlation analysis described in chapter 4. These subsystems are the
Inner Tracking System (ITS) (section 3.2.3) and Time Projection Chamber (TPC)
(section 3.2.4) for tracking, and additionally the V0 (section 3.2.5) for triggering.
The triggering and reconstruction mechanisms are also described, in sections 3.2.6
and 3.2.7, respectively.
3.1. THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER 39
3.1 The Large Hadron Collider
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a two-ring hadron synchrotron, 26.7 km in cir-
cumference and 4570 m underground, located in the tunnel originally constructed
for LEP. Each ring (composed of curved and straight sections) can accelerate either
protons or lead nuclei in opposite directions about the ring and collide them at four
crossing points. At design energy it will be able to collide protons at
s = 14 TeV
and lead nuclei at
sNN = 5.5 TeV, although at the time of writing the highest
energies achieved were
s = 8 TeV and
sNN = 2.76 TeV for protons and lead,
respectively [78]. Collisions of lower-mass nuclei have also been proposed, but this
had not been implemented at the time of writing [79].
The beams are steered around the ring by dipole magnets with a peak field of 8.33 T
and are focussed by quadrupole magnets. The acceleration occurs within a single
straight section of the ring, containing an array of 400 MHz radio frequency (RF)
cavities [78]. The two-ring structure is necessary as, unlike previous hadron colliders
which typically studied protonantiproton collisions, the LHC circulates two beams
of positively charged particles. This requires the bending magnetic field for the
clockwise beam to be in the opposite direction to that for the anticlockwise beam.
Four main experiments are positioned around the LHC ring, one at each of the four
crossing points. These are ALICE, optimised to study ion collisions, the general-
purpose experiments ATLAS and CMS, and LHCb, optimised for the study of b
physics. The layout of these experiments and the accelerating RF cavities around
the LHC ring is shown in figure 3.1.
Protons or lead nuclei are passed through a chain of accelerators prior to being in-
jected into the LHC [80]. Protons are supplied by a proton source, which strips hy-
drogen atoms of their electrons and injects them into a linear accelerator (LINAC2)
in which they are accelerated to 50 MeV prior to injection into the Proton Syn-
chrotron Booster (PSB). The PSB accelerates the protons to 1.4 GeV before inject-

ions [80]
ing them into the Proton Synchrotron (PS), in which they are accelerated to 25 GeV
before being fed into the SPS. In the SPS the protons are accelerated to 450 GeV,
after which they are injected into the LHC. This accelerator chain is shown in
figure 3.2.
The hadrons undergoing acceleration are collected in bunches, with a separation
between bunches of 25 ns at maximum capacity. One beam can circulate up to 2808
of these bunches, which have a typical transverse size when far from the detectors
of the order of 1 mm and a length of a few centimetres. The bunches are squeezed
by focussing magnets to a transverse size of approximately 16 m at the interaction
points to maximise the collision rate in the experiments.
To produce lead beams, 208Pb atoms are stripped of their electrons by being passed
through a series of foils. The nuclei are then accelerated in a linear accelerator
(LINAC3), followed by the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR). The ions are then injected
into the PS, after which they follow the same accelerator chain as described for
protons (albeit at a correspondingly reduced energy per nucleon).
3.2. THE ALICE DETECTOR 42
The design pp collision luminosity is L = 1034 cm2 s1 which, combined with the
total inelastic pp collision cross section of inel = 69.4 mb at
s = 7 TeV [81], gives
an event rate of 700 MHz. The highest produced luminosity across all of the LHC
experiments at the time of writing is 7.7 1033 cm2 s1, with the value in ALICE
typically being around 1030 cm2 s1 (leading to an event rate of around 105 Hz).
When running with lead beams, the average produced luminosity to date was mea-
sured to be 5 1023 cm2 s1, giving a hadronic collision rate of approximately
4 Hz. The overall interaction rate was around 50 Hz, but the majority of this was
due to electromagnetic processes which are easily rejected due to their low produced
multiplicity [82].
3.2 The ALICE detector
3.2.1 Detector overview
A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE), measuring 16 16 26 m3 and situated
at point 2 on the LHC ring, is optimised to focus on the PbPb collisions at the LHC
as opposed to the pp collisions that are the focus of the other experiments. In par-
ticular, this required the design to take into account the very large track multiplicity
expected in ion collisions, roughly three orders of magnitude larger than that of typ-
ical pp collisions and a factor of two to five higher than the largest multiplicities
observed at RHIC. ALICE was tested with simulations of up to dNch/d = 8000 [83],
significantly higher than the value of dNch/d = 1601 60 measured at the LHC in
central PbPb collisions at mid-rapidity [84].
The layout of the detector is illustrated in figure 3.3. The central barrel, centred on
the interaction point, is contained within a large solenoidal magnet which produces
a uniform field of 0.5 T. This causes particle paths within the detector to curve,
3.2. THE ALICE DETECTOR 43

allowing their momentum to be measured as described in section 3.2.7. The central
barrel comprises many concentrically layered detector systems for charged particle
tracking, calorimetry and particle identification (PID), most of which cover the
pseudorapidity range 0.9 <  < 0.9 and the full range of azimuthal angle 0 <  <
2. Transverse momentum is measurable over a large range from around 100 MeV
up to over 100 GeV, and PID is also possible over much of this range. The analysis
presented in this document required only charged unidentified hadrons, and so of
the central barrel detectors only the tracking detectors were used. These, the ITS
and TPC, are described later in this section.
In addition to the central barrel detectors, there exist detectors at larger pseudora-
pidity to detect particles with paths closer to the beamline. Mostly these detectors,
such as the multiple components of the forward muon arm, were not used in this
analysis. However the V0, a particle counter with a fast response, is used for mini-
mum bias triggering and is described later in this section.
3.2. THE ALICE DETECTOR 44
3.2.2 Coordinate system
A standard set of coordinates is used when describing directions and angles in the
ALICE experiment. The origin of both coordinate systems defined here is set to the
intersection of the beamline and the central membrane of the TPC, in the mid-point
of the central barrel.
Cartesian x, y, z
The x-axis points to the centre of the LHC; the y-axis points vertically up-
wards; the z-axis is parallel to the beam direction and points towards the muon
arm end of the detector.
Cylindrical polar r, , 
r is the radial distance perpendicular to the beam pipe.  and  are polar and
azimuthal angles with respect to the beam pipe (z-axis), although pseudora-
pidity  (as defined in appendix A) is typically used instead of .
Sides A and C
The A side of the experiment is the side closest to the main CERN site, and
the C side is the side furthest away. The muon arm is located on the C side.
3.2.3 Inner tracking system
The Inner Tracking System (ITS) consists of six concentric cylindrical layers of
silicon detectors, located immediately around the interaction point and covering
the pseudorapidity range ||  0.9. As depicted in figure 3.4, from inner to outer
these six layers comprise two layers of Silicon Pixel Detector (SPD), two layers of
Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) and two layers of Silicon Strip Detector (SSD). The
main design consideration is the high multiplicity expected in ion collisions, which
necessitates a very high granularity in the tracking detectors close to the beam line
3.2. THE ALICE DETECTOR 45
Figure 3.4: Cross section of the ALICE inner tracking system [83].
 in the innermost layer, with its radius at the minimum allowed by the beam pipe,
track density can be as high as 90 cm2. This granularity can only be achieved
through the use of silicon detectors.
The primary functions of the ITS are vertex determination (including separation of
secondary vertices), tracking of low-momentum particles and improvement of the
momentum and angle measurements of the TPC [85]. It is particularly important
for the measurement of particles of momentum lower than 200 MeV, which do not
reach the TPC and thus only appear in the ITS.
Silicon pixel detector
The SPD comprises the innermost two layers of the ITS, positioned at radii r =
3.9 cm and r = 7.6 cm. The SPD is finely segmented in two dimensions (perpendic-
ular to the  direction), localising a particle passing through by detecting a signal
in one of its 9 106 cells. This gives it the highest precision of the ITS components,
with a spatial resolution of 12 m in r and 100 m in z. Its proximity to the inter-
action point means that the SPD must be extremely radiation hard  the estimated
total dose over 10 years of running is 220 krad [86].
3.2. THE ALICE DETECTOR 46
Short tracks known as tracklets can be formed from two SPD hits, with no other
tracking information required. The number of these tracklets can provide a mea-
surement of charged particle multiplicity sensitive to very low momentum particles.
In addition to tracking, the SPD also contributes to the minimum bias trigger, as
described in section 3.2.6.
Silicon drift detector
The middle two layers, at r = 15.0 cm and r = 23.9 cm, of the ITS are SDDs. These
are finely segmented in one direction but coarsely in another, with track position
in this dimension reconstructed by measuring the drift time of the produced charge
to the electrode. This allows accurate hit location, with a resolution of 38 m in
r and 28 m in z, at the expense of being limited in the event rate that they can
accommodate  the ALICE SDD is configured for a maximum drift time of 6 s [85].
As such, this type of detector is well suited to the high multiplicity, low frequency
events produced in heavy ion collisions.
Silicon strip detector
The outer two layers of the ITS, at r = 38.0 cm and r = 43.0 cm, consist of double-
sided SSDs. These are finely segmented in one direction but coarsely in the per-
pendicular direction, localising a particle to a single one of these strips. The two
sides are at a relative angle of 35 mrad to allow two-dimensional reconstruction of
a hit position with a resolution of 20 m in r and 830 m in z. This type of de-
tector is only suitable at these larger distances from the interaction point, where
the track density is typically less than 1 cm2, as in a higher density environment
difficulties in the attribution of points to a given track could lead to ambiguity in the
reconstruction [85]. The SSD layers are particularly important for track matching
between the ITS and TPC.
3.2. THE ALICE DETECTOR 47
Figure 3.5: Layout of the TPC [87].
3.2.4 Time projection chamber
The Time Projection Chamber (TPC), located outside the ITS, is the main tracking
system of the central barrel of the detector and (as with the other central barrel
detectors) is optimised to provide a charged particle momentum measurement with
good two-particle separation, PID and vertex determination [83]. For tracks with
full radial track length it covers ||  0.9, and coverage up to ||  1.5 is possible
with reduced track length (to a minimum of one third of the total radial track
length) and correspondingly lower momentum resolution. The full range of azimuth
is covered, with momentum resolution better than 1% for tracks with pT between
0.2 and 1 GeV, around 5% for tracks of pT  10GeV, and rising to 30% for tracks
of up to 100 GeV. As with the ITS a significant factor in the design was the high
track multiplicities expected with a theoretical maximum of 2 104 tracks over the
full volume, an unprecedented multiplicity for a TPC [83].
TPCs are a form of gaseous tracking detector and are essentially very large-volume
drift chambers with multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPCs) at one or both ends
(both in the case of ALICE [88]). Due to their very low material thickness, they cause
minimal scattering of the passing particles. This, combined with their excellent two-
3.2. THE ALICE DETECTOR 48
track separation, is desirable in the high multiplicity environment produced in ion
collisions. As with drift chambers, charged particles passing through ionise atoms
of the gas, liberating electrons. These electrons then drift in a uniform electric field
towards the MWPC, producing an electron shower when they approach the MWPC
anode wires and are accelerated by the stronger electric field near the wires. This
shower is then detected from the charge induced on cathode pads [89].
The long drift time of a TPC (up to approximately 92 s at ALICE [83]) limits
the maximum collision rate that can be accommodated. Full three-dimensional
information can be read out: x and y from the two dimensionally segmented cathode
pads and z from the drift time.
The ALICE TPC is cylindrical with inner radius roughly 85 cm, outer radius roughly
250 cm and longitudial length of 500 cm; a cutaway diagram of its structure is shown
in figure 3.5. It contains 90 m3 of Ne/CO2/N2 in a 90:10:5 ratio at atmospheric pres-
sure; this mixture is optimised for low diffusion perpendicular to the drift direction
and low radiation length (minimising multiple scattering). It is separated by a cen-
tral cathode, and electrons drift up to 2.5 m from either side of this to MWPCs at
either end plate.
The end plates are shown in figure 3.6; the MWPCs comprise 18 trapezoidal sectors.
The entire TPC is contained within a field cage to permit the extremely uniform
electric field (of 400 V/cm) that is required in such detectors. It provides a position
resolution of 8001100 m (r) by 11001250 m (z), the exact value depending on
the particle position within the detector [83].
3.2.5 V0
The V0 comprises two arrays of plastic scintillator counters at small angles to the
beam pipe  the V0A on the A side covering the pseudorapidity range 2.8 <  <

5.1, and the V0C on the C side covering the pseudorapidity range 3.7 <  <
1.7. The V0A and V0C are positioned 340 cm and 90 cm from the interaction
point, respectively, this difference being due to the limitations on available space
on the C side imposed by the large muon absorber. This asymmetry leads to the
aforementioned difference in pseudorapidity coverage of the two arrays.
Each V0 array is coarsely granular, being composed of four concentric rings of eight
scintillator counters apiece. Its main relevance to the analysis presented here is
its contribution to the minimum bias trigger, as described in section 3.2.6. It can
also be used for a centrality trigger in heavy ion collisions, and for elimination of
beamgas interactions  the relative timing of signals in the two arrays can be used
to distinguish a collision that occurred at the interaction point from one occurring
elsewhere along the beamline.
3.2. THE ALICE DETECTOR 50
3.2.6 Triggering
Typically at modern high energy physics experiments, including those at the LHC,
the collision rate is far in excess of the capacity to store the resulting data. This
necessitates some form of triggering to preferentially select interesting events for
storage and analysis.
Central Trigger Processor
The triggering in the ALICE experiment is controlled by the Central Trigger Pro-
cessor (CTP) hardware, located adjacent to the detector to minimise the latency.
The CTP can receive up to 24 inputs from triggering detectors (additional detec-
tors can be read out only, playing no role in triggering) and pass trigger signals to
detectors via Local Trigger Units (LTUs). There exist three levels of trigger: L0, L1
and L2 [83].
Initially, if the inputs satisfy defined L0 conditions (typically indicating that at
least one fast detector, such as the V0, has detected a possible event) and if no
vetoes occur (see below for examples of possible vetoes), an L0 signal is generated
which initiates the processing of the event by the read out detectors. This fast
decision typically reaches the detectors within 1.2 s of an interaction. If further,
more restrictive, conditions are met, an L1 signal is generated and following this,
processing of the event either continues or is terminated. Finally, after additional
conditions are tested, an L2a (accept) or L2r (reject) signal is generated; if the
read out detectors receive an L2a signal the event data is read out to the Data
Acquisition (DAQ). This occurs roughly 88 s after the interaction, approximately
equal to the drift time of the TPC.
The CTP can be connected to 24 L0 inputs, 24 L1 inputs and 12 L2 inputs. Up to 50
trigger classes can be defined, each comprising a logical combination of these inputs.

can veto further triggers.
Downscaling To protect rare triggers from being overwhelmed by common ones
saturating the read out, trigger classes can have their rates downscaled by the

is shown in figure 3.7.
3.2. THE ALICE DETECTOR 52
Triggers used in this analysis
The most basic trigger is a so-called minimum bias (MB) trigger which is optimised
to select inelastic events with as little physics bias as possible, to produce a selection
of the most typical events (with no preference for any rare characteristics). The
ALICE pp minimum bias trigger requires at least one hit in the V0A, or the V0C,
or the SPD. Each SPD chip produces a Fast-OR signal for this purpose, indicating
that a hit has occurred on at least one of the pixels on that chip [92]. This signal
is fast enough to be used as an input to the L0 trigger; the full information is then
read out later if the trigger is not vetoed.
For the PbPb collisions studied in this analysis the minimum bias trigger was
slightly different, requiring hits in at least two out of the V0A, V0C, or SPD.
Due to the steeply falling nature of the multiplicity spectrum, as demonstrated
in figure 3.8, the majority of events selected by a minimum bias trigger have a
relatively low multiplicity. For an analysis of high multiplicity pp events, it is
therefore advantageous to have a trigger that selects only high multiplicity events.
The ALICE high multiplicity (HM) trigger was defined to require at least 60 fired
chips in the outer layer of the SPD, and was active during the LHC10e period of
s = 7 TeV pp data taking in August 2010.
As shown in figure 3.8, the high multiplicity trigger greatly increases the statistics
at high multiplicity. In this plot multiplicity is defined as the number of recon-
structed tracks with pT > 0.2 GeV, according to the multiplicity definition used in
the analysis and described in more detail in section 4.3.
Figure 3.8 also shows the HM/MB ratio, which is constant (within statistical uncer-
tainty) above 58 tracks. As such, 58 tracks was taken as the threshold above which
the high multiplicity trigger was usable.
Each trigger described above was configured to trigger the read out of all of the

main tracking detectors. Additional triggers, such as a muon trigger, were also in
use during the data taking period analysed here. However, as they were not used in
this analysis, they are not described in this document.
High multiplicity trigger bias
During the period of data taking in which the high multiplicity trigger was active
there were problems with the ITS cooling system, leading to a non-negligible number
of non-functioning pixels in the SPD. As described in section 4.1.1, track cuts were
optimised to minimise any resultant biasing of the results. However, there was some
concern that this would cause a bias in the high multiplicity trigger. Specifically,
as the dead pixels were clustered together causing large non-functioning sections,
there was a possibility that the trigger would respond differently to events with a
clustered track profile (such as jet events) as opposed to those with a more uniformly
distributed track profile. This would alter the relative proportions of these event
types in the selected event sample.
3.2. THE ALICE DETECTOR 54
To determine the extent of this issue, correlation plots were produced within the
same high multiplicity bin from both minimum bias and high multiplicity triggered
data. These were observed to be compatible within experimental uncertainty, lead-
ing to the conclusion that no significant bias existed in the final results.
3.2.7 Data acquisition and offline reconstruction
After an L2a trigger signal is received, the read out data from the detectors is
managed by the Data Acquisition (DAQ) system. The Front-End Readout Elec-
tronics (FERO) of each detector are connected via optical fibre to Local Data Con-
centrators (LDCs), each of which receive and process chunks of an event. These
chunks are then merged into a full event by one of a farm of Global Data Concen-
trators (GDCs), after which the raw data are stored for offline reconstruction [83].
The offline reconstruction of events is performed using the AliRoot software, an
extension of the ROOT analysis software with ALICE-specific libraries and methods.
This is processed on the Grid, a large distributed computing network [83].
The raw output from the tracking detectors consists of signals from detector ele-
ments, which are digitised. Sets of digits which are adjacent in space are assumed to
originate from the same particle traversing the detector, and are combined into clus-
ters. Space points are then reconstructed in three dimensions, generally positioned
according to the centre of gravity of the cluster [93].
Before reconstructing full tracks, the primary vertex is reconstructed. Pairs of space
points in the two layers of the SPD which are close in azimuthal and polar angles
are joined to form tracklets, from which the primary vertex position is determined.
A first pass track reconstruction is then performed, starting with track seeds from
the outermost clusters in the TPC and working inwards whilst assuming that all
tracks originated at the primary vertex. This is repeated without the constraint
3.2. THE ALICE DETECTOR 55
to the primary vertex, with both sets of tracks stored; the track finding is then
continued through it ITS.
After the first pass, a second pass takes place, with the track finding beginning at
the inner layer of the ITS and working outwards. The track can then be further
refined by a final refitting, again beginning at the outside of the TPC and following
the tracks inwards. Reconstruction is also possible using only the TPC or the ITS,
producing so-called TPC or ITS standalone tracks. The transverse momentum of
detected particles can then be deduced from the curvature of their tracks in the
0.5 T field of the ALICE solenoidal magnet, with the tracks of higher pT particles
having a greater radius of curvature.
After reconstruction, the data are stored in the Event Summary Data (ESD) format
for future analysis. Typically this analysis is carried out on the Grid using routines
written in C++ which utilise AliRoot.
CHAPTER 4
TWO-PARTICLE CORRELATION
ANALYSIS
Jet analysis using dihadron angular correlations, mentioned briefly in section 1.4.5,
takes a fundamentally different approach to the perhaps more familiar method of
event-by-event jet reconstruction. Instead of requiring that individual jets be recon-
structed, a statistical approach is taken whereby the distribution of angular separa-
tion of tracks is studied for a large sample of events. This technique is particularly
useful with heavy ion collisions, where the large multiplicities make it difficult for
jet-finder algorithms to distinguish tracks belonging to a jet from background. Such
a statistical method is sensitive to a wide variety of jet physics [64, 94].
This chapter describes the usage of two-particle angular correlations for a study of
jet shapes and transverse momentum imbalance (quantified by the jet fragmentation
transverse momentum jT, and the net partonic transverse momentum kT) in mini-

of correlations for a study of the multiplicity dependence of the jet yield in proton
and ion collisions is described; the results of this are given in chapter 6. An analysis
of the multiplicity dependence of the jet shape was also performed, the results being
presented in chapter 7.
The proton multiplicity analyses were performed with a view to attempting to iden-
tify possible medium effects in high multiplicity proton collisions, as described in
section 1.3.2; the ion analyses were performed for comparison.
4.1 Data sample
This analysis used data from pp collisions at
s = 7 TeV and
s = 2.76 TeV, and
PbPb collisions at
sNN = 2.76 TeV. The data used, with the LHC periods and
number of MB triggered events at each energy, are summarised in table 4.1. The
analysis also used simulated Monte-Carlo data, which are detailed in table 4.2.
In the minimum bias proton collision analysis, the use of two beam energies allows
the dependence of jet shapes on beam energy to be ascertained. In the multiplicity
4.1. DATA SAMPLE 58
analysis, the 2.76 TeV pp data were used to allow the closest possible comparison
with PbPb data, as for this data
spp =
sNN. The 7 TeV pp data were used
to allow the furthest possible multiplicity reach, as the high multiplicity trigger was
only used during this period. Stronger QGP effects would also be expected to be
more apparent in higher energy data. The LHC period given in the table contains a
number indicating the year and a letter indicating the run period within that year,
a period of data taking lasting roughly a month.
The simulated Monte-Carlo data were central ALICE productions, generated to
match the detector response of the corresponding real data periods as closely as
possible (the production name not necessarily matching the corresponding run pe-
riod).
For pp data, the Pythia 6 event generator was used with the Perugia-0 tune [95, 96].
Pythia is a Monte-Carlo event generator, developed with emphasis on events involv-
ing strong interactions. The total pp collision cross section is divided into elastic,
diffractive and inelastic components, with the diffractive physics being described
by a pomeron model. Inelastic interactions are simulated with a pQCD model,
the divergence of the cross section at low pT being avoided by the introduction
of a phenomenological cutoff pTmin  2 GeV. Pythia also includes a description
of multi-parton interactions, whereby several partonparton interactions can take
place within one event. Fragmentation of colour strings is simulated using the Lund
string model.
For PbPb data, the HIJING 1.36 generator was used [97], which models QCD
processes in a similar manner to Pythia. The simulation is extended to heavy ion
collisions with Glauber geometry used to describe multiple nucleonnucleon interac-
tions In addition, nuclear phenomena such as nuclear shadowing (where the nuclear
PDFs are modified with respect to those of free partons) are included. Final state
effects, such as the suppression of high pT hadrons in a volume of QGP, can also be
introduced.
4.1. DATA SAMPLE 59
In both cases, the detector response was simulated using GEANT3.
4.1.1 Track selection
For each event, a set of track selection cuts were applied to eliminate poor-quality
tracks. These were optimised to preferentially select primary particles not origi-
nating from weak decays or from interactions with detector components, and to
maximise momentum resolution. In the period in which
s = 7 TeV pp data were
taken, there were a number of non-functioning sections in the ITS due to problems
with the cooling system, which caused a non-negligible number of dead pixels in the
SPD. To minimise the bias that this would cause to the results, no ITS hits were
required. For consistency, the same set of track cuts was used for all events; these
are detailed here.

4.2. PILEUP 60
4.2 Pileup
A consequence of the high luminosities reached at the LHC during proton running
is a high probability of multiple interactions occurring within one bunch crossing,
termed pileup (due to the low luminosities during PbPb collisions at the LHC,
pileup for these events is negligible). This is typically quantified within a given
run by the average number of interactions per bunch crossing ; the probability
P (, n) for n interactions in one bunch crossing then being determined by a Poisson
distribution:
P (, n) =
en
. (4.1)
 is determined on a run-by-run basis from the number of fired CINT1B and
CBEAMB triggers. A CBEAMB trigger indicates that both beams were present
in the detector (as monitored by beam pickup detectors) and thus that proton
interactions could occur, and CINT1B is the minimum bias trigger described in sec-
tion 3.2.6 which implies that an interaction occurred while both beams were present.
The ratio of the number of CINT1B triggers to the number of CBEAMB triggers
thus gives the fraction of bunch crossings in which at least one interaction occurred,
and hence the probability of at least one interaction occurring in a given bunch
crossing.  can then be determined by solving

CBEAMB
= 1 P (, 0) (4.2)
where CINT1B and CBEAMB indicate the number of those triggers fired and
P (, 0) = e
is the probability of no interactions occurring in one bunch crossing.
4.2. PILEUP 61
4.2.1 Estimation of pileup fraction
The fraction of pileup in measured data increases with event multiplicity and so
during the period in which the ALICE high multiplicity trigger was in use the LHC
was operated with a low- configuration at point 2, with the beams intentionally
slightly misaligned.
Only the runs with the lowest  were selected for the high multiplicity pp analy-
sis. The prevalence of pileup within these runs was estimated with a Monte-Carlo
model. This model generated simplified events following the multiplicity spectrum
determined from a pileup-free run of very low , each of which could contain from
one to three interactions with proportions according to the  calculated as described
above. As a worst-case scenario, the highest  of all selected runs was used.
The interaction vertices were distributed with a Gaussian distribution of width taken
from the same pileup-free run, and the track DCA to the interaction vertex dis-
tributed according to a Gaussian determined similarly. Within each event, the
highest multiplicity interaction was taken as the primary interaction and the others
as pileup.
Different cuts were then applied on the zDCA of each track with respect to the
primary vertex (where z indicates the direction parallel with the beam axis), and
the degree of included pileup calculated. With the same cut as used in the anal-
ysis, zDCA < 2 cm, at the highest multiplicities the pileup fraction estimate was
calculated to be 0.085.
To determine the effect of pileup on the final results, the analysis was performed
with the zDCA cut reduced to 0.5 cm, reducing the pileup fraction at the highest
multiplicities according to the model to 0.059. This had no measurable effect on the
results, and so pileup was not deemed to be a significant issue. The zDCA cut was
also varied when determining the systematic uncertainties due to the choice of track
4.3. MULTIPLICITY DEFINITION 62
cuts.
4.3 Multiplicity definition
For the multiplicity analysis, various multiplicity estimators were considered. Fig-
ure 4.1 shows the correlation of four potential multiplicity estimators with the true
multiplicity in the region || < 0.8, in a sample of
s = 2.76 TeV pp events
simulated in Pythia. The estimators displayed in the figure are the number of re-
constructed tracks with pT > 0.2 GeV, the number of reconstructed tracks with
pT > 0.3 GeV, the V0 multiplicity and the number of SPD tracklets (a tracklet
being a short track reconstructed using only information from the SPD).
It can be seen that the estimators involving the number of reconstructed tracks have
a tighter correlation with the true multiplicity. This is largely due to the sensitivity
of the detectors to different physics due to their differing acceptance. For example,
diffractive events that cause a signal in the V0 due to its forward position can still
produce few reconstructable tracks at central rapidity. In real data this effect is
worsened by, for example, beamgas interactions.
It is also preferable to use a relatively low pT cut for the estimator, to minimise the
risk of biasing the final results. As such, the multiplicity estimator selected for this
analysis was the number of reconstructed tracks with pT > 0.2 GeV.
4.3.1 Defining centrality in heavy ion collisions
When heavy ion nuclei collide ultra-relativistically they appear in the centre of
mass frame as Lorentz contracted pancakes of thickness 2R/cm (although there
is a limiting thickness of around 1 fm due to Fermi momentum) where R is the
nuclear radius (around 10 fm for typical experimental nuclei such as lead or gold)

mass [10].
As the colliding nuclei are, in the transverse direction at least, relatively large, it
is likely that the collision is not in fact head on but instead occurs with a degree
of overlap. The transverse separation of the nucleus centres is termed the impact
parameter, b. This is depicted in figure 4.2a, with the overlapping region in the
transverse plane shown in figure 4.2b.
The degree of overlap is typically quantified not by the impact parameter but by
the collision centrality. This is defined from 0100% of cross section, where 0%
is a perfectly head on collision with b = 0, and 100% is an extreme peripheral
collision with b = 2R. Typically in the ultra-peripheral region electromagnetic
effects dominate, and so centralities more peripheral than 90% are often excluded
from analyses. Larger, denser volumes of QGP would be expected in more central
collisions.
4.3. MULTIPLICITY DEFINITION 65
4.3.2 Determination of centrality
The centrality is not directly measurable, but it is strongly correlated with the
observed particle multiplicity. As such, multiplicity is commonly used as a centrality
estimator, with the hadronic cross section as a function of multiplicity being divided
into percentiles [82].
While the standard ALICE centrality estimator uses the V0 multiplicity, in this
analysis it was decided that the same multiplicity estimator would be used for both
pp and PbPb data, to enable more direct comparison between the two systems.
This estimator is described at the beginning of section 4.3.
The multiplicity distribution according to this estimator is fit using a Monte-Carlo
model, with a Glauber model to describe the collision geometry and a negative
binomial distribution to describe the particle production. This follows the basic
technique used by the standard ALICE centrality estimator [82]; the model is de-
scribed in appendix C. The multiplicity distribution was fit only in the region above
25 tracks to minimise the contamination from electromagnetic interactions, which
comprise a non-negligible contribution to the total cross section in the most periph-
eral collisions.
The distribution obtained from the model and divided into centrality bins is shown,
together with the multiplicity distribution from the data, in figure 4.3. It can be seen
that the model matches the data well. Figure 4.4 shows the correlation between cen-
trality according to this estimator and centrality according to the standard ALICE
centrality estimator, using V0 multiplicity.

4.4. CORRELATION FUNCTION CONSTRUCTION 67
4.4 Correlation function construction
In each event, high pT particles (defined as having pT within a given range) are
identified and termed trigger particles. For each of these, pairs are formed with
associated particles, defined as having pT less than that of the trigger but still
relatively high (defined as being within a different, but still relatively high, range).
Dihadron azimuthal correlation functions measure the distribution of angular dif-
ference  = t a between these pairs; in general in this analysis, subscripts t
and a refer to the trigger and associated particles, respectively. The allowed pT
ranges of the trigger and associated particles, pTt and pTa, are selected to be high
enough that soft effects (such as flow) do not form a significant contribution but low
enough that an acceptably large number of pairs are analysed.
The normalised correlation function can be constructed as the ratio of real to mixed
distributions
C() =
Ntrigg
dNuncorr/d
dNmix/d
(4.3)
where Ntrigg is the number of triggers in the real distribution, Nmix is the num-
ber in the mixed distribution and dNuncorr/d and dNmix/d are the real and
mixed distributions. The real distribution is the  distribution within each event,
whereas the mixed distribution is constructed using the trigger particles of one event
and the associated particles of another event. As pairs in the mixed distribution
are uncorrelated by construction, the use of the mixed distribution in this manner
corrects for the pair detection efficiency of the detector.
If the mixed distribution is suitably flat, this normalisation is equivalent to normal-
ising by a constant, and so in this case the following distribution could be used:

The mixed distribution is equivalent to the convolution of the t distribution with the

next to the convolution of one with the other (performed using a simple Monte-Carlo
process). It can be seen that the  distributions are noticeably non-uniform, mostly
as a result of the segmented structure of the TPC. Despite this, the convolution
process leads to a very flat pair acceptance. As such, in this analysis the raw 
distributions were normalised by a constant Ntrigg and no mixed distributions were
used. The uncorr suffix is omitted in the remainder of this document, ie.

Normalised  correlation plots generally have a characteristic shape of two peaks,
at   0 and   , corresponding to pairs of azimuthally opposite jets. These
sit on top of a constant pedestal from the uncorrelated background. Examples of
uncorrected and normalised  distributions illustrating this shape, from both pp
and PbPb collisions, are shown in figures 4.6 and 4.7. In general in this document
 distributions are presented in units of  such that, for example,  = 1 implies

4.5 Corrections
When analysing correlation data it is important to consider the effects of efficiency
and contamination. These can be divided into single particle and pair corrections,
with the single particle correction being applied to all trigger and associated par-
ticles separately, and the pair correction being applied to all pairs. The required
corrections are determined from a comparison of reconstructed and generator-level
simulated Monte-Carlo data, the data being described in section 4.1 and summarised
4.5. CORRECTIONS 70
in table 4.2.
4.5.1 Single particle corrections
In general it is important to correct for tracking inefficiencies and fake tracks, where
tracking inefficiency is caused by tracks not being reconstructed and a fake track
is one which was wrongly reconstructed where in fact no particle from the initial
interaction traversed the detector. Tracking efficiency is defined as
Nprimrec
(4.6)
where Nprimrec and N
gen are the number of reconstructed and generated primaries,
respectively, a primary being defined as a particle produced in the initial collision
and not resulting from a later weak decay or from an interaction with the detector
material. Contamination is defined as
Nfake
(4.7)
where Nfake is the number of reconstructed tracks that do not correspond to a
primary particle and Nrec = N
rec + Nfake is the total number of reconstructed
tracks. The overall correction for efficiency and contamination c is then defined as
c1 =
Nfake +N
. (4.8)
This is shown in figure 4.8 for each Monte-Carlo production, as a function of pT,
for three multiplicity bins in pp and three centrality bins in PbPb. It can be
seen that, while there is some dependence on multiplicity/centrality, within a given
multiplicity bin the correction appears to be flat within statistical uncertainty above
pT  3 GeV.

4.5.2 Pair corrections
As well as single particle corrections, a combined pair correction must be considered.
An example of a pair effect is the possibility that two particles with   0 are in-
correctly reconstructed as a single track. To demonstrate these corrections, separate
 distributions are filled at various stages of the analysis. Table 4.3 summarises
these stages.
The ratio of the correlation plot at each stage to that of the previous stage was
then taken; these ratios are shown in figure 4.9. It can be seen that the significant
effects are those of tracking efficiency and contamination, and that the necessary
corrections are, within statistical uncertainty, constant in . While the statistical
uncertainties for the two pp collision energies in this study are relatively large due

to the low Monte-Carlo statistics available, the uncertainties for PbPb collisions
are small and the resulting ratios are very flat; generally pair effects are expected
to be less significant in pp collisions than in PbPb. The plots in this figure are
not binned in multiplicity or centrality as no significant distinction was observed
between the bins.
4.5.3 Overall correction
As can be seen in sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2, the single particle corrections are flat
within statistical uncertainty for particles of pT greater than 3 GeV, and the pair
corrections are flat in  within statistical uncertainty. As will be described in
sections 4.6 and 4.7, the final values extracted from the correlation functions and
compared between different systems are either the ratio of away to nearside yields,
or are dependent on the widths of the near or awayside peaks. As such, the values
are unchanged by a constant scaling of the correlation functions. This has the
consequence that, provided all considered particles have pT > 3 GeV, the results
are independent of both the single particle and pair corrections. Because of this,
no correction was actually applied in the final analysis. Where absolute values of
quantities were compared, for example between data and Monte-Carlo (MC), this
4.6. COMPARISON OF JET SHAPES 73
was done within the same system such that correction was not required.
4.6 Comparison of jet shapes
Dihadron correlations can be used to study the typical jet shape and momentum
imbalance. As described in section 2.1, the relative pT of a jet hadron with respect
to the parent parton is defined as the jet fragmentation transverse momentum jT.
The typical jet width is thus characterised by the RMS of this,
j2T.
In the same section, the net partonic transverse momentum kT is also introduced.
This quantifies the degree of pT imbalance between the two jets. Both jT and kT
can be extracted from  correlation functions, as described in this section.
4.6.1 Extraction of jT
The typical jet width is directly related to the width of the nearside peak of a
dihadron correlation plot (it can be seen that
j2T = 0 would cause the nearside
peak to be a delta function), and can be extracted from a fit of this peak. The
normalised correlation functions were fitted to the function
Ntrigg
= c0 + gN1() + gN2() + gA() (4.9)
where c0 is a constant and gN1,N2,A() are two Gaussians corresponding to the near-
side peak and one to the awayside peak, with their means fixed at N1 = N2 = 0 and
A = . Thus seven free parameters exist to be determined in the fit: the constant
background factor c0, the Gaussian widths N1, N2 and A, and the Gaussian areas
c1, c2 and c3. Only the peak widths N,A were actually required for the analysis.
4.6. COMPARISON OF JET SHAPES 74
The nearside peak width was then taken to be
c1 + c2
2N1 +
c1 + c2
2N2 (4.10)
and the awayside peak width as the width of the awayside Gaussian.
For two particles from the same jet with pT = pTt, pTa, the nearside peak width can
be related to jT by

4.6.2 Geometry of kT
Diagrams illustrating a simplified version of the fragmentation of a parton pair in
the plane perpendicular to the beam are presented in figure 4.10 with some rele-
vant quantities labelled. Figure 4.10a shows two scattered partons with transverse
momenta pT pointing in opposite directions in the partonparton centre of mass
frame.
The partons are shown in the lab frame in figure 4.10b with unequal pT of pTt and
pTa. The imbalance of these momenta is quantified by xh  pTa/pTt. The net
parton pair transverse momentum pT,pair corresponds to the vector sum of the kT
of each parton. The partons fragment, with jet fragments corresponding to each jet
having transverse momenta of pTt and pTa. As jT has been neglected, the jets have
no width.
The component of kT perpendicular to pTt, termed kTy, has been labelled. It is as-

quantities relevant to this analysis are labelled.

4.6. COMPARISON OF JET SHAPES 76
sumed that kTy and the component kTx parallel to pTt follow equal Gaussian distri-
butions. An important feature of kT is that while kTx = kTy = 0, kT 6= 0 as kT
is a radius vector, related to the components by the purely geometrical relationship
k2T =
2k2Tx =
2k2Ty. These components lead to different experimental
effects; specifically kTx causes the pT imbalance of the outgoing parton pair (in other
words causes xh 6= 1) and kTy causes an acoplanarity (the pT of one jet lies out of
the plane defined by the pT of the other jet and the beam axis [66]). The component
of pTa perpendicular to pTt, a quantity somewhat analogous to kT but defined in
terms of final state hadrons rather than partons, is labelled pout.
Actual jets have width, as described in section 2.1 and depicted in figure 2.3. Fig-
ure 4.10c displays exactly the same geometry as that in figure 4.10b but with the
inclusion of non-zero jT for the trigger (pTt side) jet. This is essentially the combi-
nation of figures 4.10b and 2.3, and it can be seen that this confuses the geometry
and makes it distinctly less trivial. In particular, pout and kTy are no longer collinear
and partons 6= hadrons.
4.6.3 Extraction of kT
The determination of kT required both the jT results from section 4.6.1 and also the
extraction of pout from the data. While it would be possible to use the geometrical
relationship pout = pTa sin  on a pair-by-pair basis, this would not take into
account the uncorrelated background. Instead, pout was calculated [67] as
p2out  pTa sinA. (4.13)
The third quantity required from the data for the determination of kT was the ratio
4.6. COMPARISON OF JET SHAPES 77
of pTa to pTt, termed xh by analogy to the partonic xh introduced in section 4.6.2:
. (4.14)
These three quantities were then combined in the equation for kT [66]
k2T
xh
p2out 
j2Tay
 x2h
where xh  pTa/pTt and zt  pTt/pTt. Assuming no difference between jTt and jTa,
this becomes
zt(kT, xh)
k2T
xh(kT, xh)
p2out 
(1 + x2h) (4.15)
where zt and xh have been explicitly labelled as functions of kT and xh, and all
quantities calculated from the data are collected on the right hand side. Solving for
kT is non-trivial, except in the limit that zt and xh tend to 1, which corresponds
to low
s; indeed at ISR energies zt  0.85 which enabled this approach to be
taken [67].
At LHC energies values of the order of zt  0.35 are expected and thus the afore-
mentioned approximation is not valid; as such an iterative method utilising a Monte-
Carlo model was used to solve for kT. This model generates pairs of partons to
which kT values are applied, the values being drawn from a two-dimensional Gaus-
sian distribution. An output
k2T value is then calculated according to equa-
tion 4.15, and the process repeated with this defining the width of the aforemen-
tioned Gaussian. This is then continued iteratively until the
k2T value converges.
A more detailed description of the model is given in appendix B.
4.7. CALCULATION AND COMPARISON OF YIELDS 78
4.7 Calculation and comparison of yields
To calculate the yield of charged particles associated with a trigger particle from the
correlation functions, it is necessary to subtract the uncorrelated background. This
can either be extracted from a fit of the correlation function, or by using the so-called
Zero Yield at Minimum (ZYAM) method, where it is assumed that between the jet
peaks is a region of zero jet yield. This region is defined as the lowest-yield region
of a given width in , the width being selected to be small enough to ensure that
the boundaries are sufficiently far from the peaks; the mean yield in this region is
then taken as the background. For the yield calculation component of this analysis
the ZYAM method was used; the fitting method was used in the determination of
the systematic uncertainty. The process is illustrated in figure 4.11.
The integrals of the background-subtracted near and awayside peaks then corre-
spond to the (uncorrected) near and awayside per-trigger yields, respectively. For
the remainder of this document, yield will refer specifically to this per-trigger yield
of charged particles associated with a trigger particle, unless otherwise specified.
An informative way of comparing yields across different systems is the taking of
the ratio of awayside to nearside yield. This is sensitive to processes that modify
the near and awayside yields differently; for example it would be expected that jet
quenching would cause this ratio to fall in PbPb collisions of increasing centrality,
or possibly in pp collisions of high multiplicity.
The process of taking ratios has the convenient side-effect, as mentioned in sec-
tion 4.5.3, that the single particle and pair efficiencies cancel if they are constant
in pT and , respectively. This method also allows the same quantity to be con-
structed for both PbPb and pp data.

CHAPTER 5
MINIMUM BIAS PROTON STUDY
RESULTS
This chapter presents the results of the study of jet shapes and transverse momentum
imbalance, quantified by jT and kT, respectively, in minimum bias (MB) proton
collisions. The study utilised data from
s = 7 TeV and
s = 2.76 TeV pp
collisions as described in section 4.1.
Results are presented for a range of trigger and associated pT bins; the binning

scheme is outlined in table 5.1. All combinations of pTt and pTa bins were used, with
the exception of those for which pTa > pTt. Combined statistical and systematic
uncertainties are shown on the plots as brackets around the statistical error bars;
the mechanism by which these were calculated is described in section 5.4.
5.1 Correlation function results
Correlation functions for each pTt,a bin were produced following the prescription in
section 4.4, and fit to the function given in equation 4.9 of two nearside Gaussians,
an awayside Gaussian and a constant for the uncorrelated background. These are
shown for three pTt,a bins for each collision energy in figure 5.1. The separate
contributions of the three Gaussians, along with the sum of these plus the constant
background, are shown for one sample bin in figure 5.2.
The peak widths N,A extracted from the fits are shown in figure 5.3, where N
is the combination of the two nearside Gaussian standard deviations as defined in
equation 4.10. The widths are presented as functions of pTt within given pTa bins.
The nearside width is observed to decrease with increasing pTt, as expected due to
the tendency of higher pT triggers to carry a higher fraction of the momentum of
the parent parton, and thus to lie closer to the jet axis. Likewise, a dependence is
observed on pTa, for similar reasons. The combined effects of jT and kT complicate
the interpretation of the awayside width, but a similar dependence on pTt and pTa
is observed. These observations are qualitatively consistent with measurements at
RHIC [66].

5.2 Extracted jT results
Values of
j2T, determined following the method described in section 4.6.1, are
presented in figure 5.4. It can be seen that the measured
j2T is independent of
pTt and pTa, with a constant value of
j2T  0.8 GeV. This is higher than the
values of around 0.6 GeV measured in
s = 200 GeV pp collisions at RHIC [66],
consistently with the expectation from QCD that
j2T should rise slowly with jet
pT, following
j2T 
pTjet (and hence with collision energy) [98]. The expected
difference in
j2T between the two collision energies studied in this analysis is too
small to be identified in the results presented here.
5.3 Extracted kT results
p2out and xh were also calculated; the results are shown in figures 5.5 and 5.6,
respectively.
p2out is observed to increase with increasing pTa and with decreasing

p2out  pTa sinA (equa-
tion 4.13), noting that A decreases with increasing pTt. The dependence of xh on
pTt and pTa arises trivially from the definition of xh.
These results were then used, along with the
j2T results, to determine
k2T
using the method described in section 4.6.3. The Monte-Carlo model described in
appendix B was used to extract the values from the experimental measurements.
These are shown in figure 5.7 as functions of pTt within given bins in pTa.

k2T = 2.68 GeV measured in
s = 200 GeV collisions at RHIC [66], and of
1.1 GeV measured in
s = 62.4 GeV collisions at the ISR [67]. However, some
dependence on hadron pT is also observed, contrary to previous measurements at
lower beam energies:
k2T can be seen to increase with increasing pTt and pTa. This
is suggested to be a consequence of the radiative origin of the measured acoplanarity.

5.4. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES 87
5.4 Systematic uncertainties
The largest sources of systematic uncertainty in the minimum bias proton analysis
were the choice of track cuts and the choice of the mechanism used to extract the
peak widths. To determine the extent of the systematic effects, the track cuts and
width extraction scheme were varied and the spread of the results calculated follow-
ing the prescription in [99]. This prescription defines the systematic uncertainty on
a data point as the standard deviation of the values of that data point according
to the different methods, with the statistical uncertainty subtracted in quadrature.
Thus, if the spread of the values from the different methods was consistent with
statistical fluctuation, the calculated systematic uncertainty on that point would be
zero.
The following sets of track cuts were used, listed here in order from least to most
restrictive:
1. TPC tracks as defined in section 4.1.1.
2. Moderately tight cuts:
(a) Combined ITS+TPC tracks.
(b) At least 70 TPC clusters.
(c) Same DCA requirements as (1).
3. Tight cuts:
(a) Combined ITS+TPC tracks.
(b) At least 70 TPC clusters.
(c) Maximum DCA to vertex in beam direction DCAz < 2 cm.
The following schemes were used to determine the peak widths:
5.4. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES 88
1. The distributions were fit to two nearside Gaussians, one awayside Gaussian
plus a constant, as described in section 4.6.1.
2. The widths were taken as the background-subtracted RMSs of the distributions
in the peak regions, with the background determined in the non-peak region
under the assumption that between the peaks existed a region of zero jet yield.
3. As method 2, but with different widths for the defined peak and back-
ground regions.
By way of example, peak widths N and A extracted from
s = 7 TeV pp data,
with 4 < pTa < 6 GeV, are shown in figure 5.8. The same procedure was also used
for the other pTa bins, for
s = 2.76 TeV data, and for the quantities calculated
from the peak widths, but the plots are not shown here.

CHAPTER 6
JET YIELD DEPENDENCE ON
MULTIPLICITY
This chapter presents the results of the yield study component of the analysis, as
described in chapter 4. As detailed in section 4.1, the analysis used data from
pp collisions at
s = 7 TeV and
s = 2.76 TeV, and from PbPb collisions at
sNN = 2.76 TeV. Background-subtracted correlation plots are shown for each
system; the away/nearside yield ratios are then compared between the different
systems. As explained in section 4.7 an increase in the degree of jet quenching, for
example in PbPb collisions of increasing centrality, would be expected to cause this
ratio to fall below that expected in the absence of such effects.
The multiplicity and centrality binning used for each analysed system is shown
in table 6.1. The centrality binning scheme for the peripheral PbPb data was
selected such that it corresponds to the same multiplicity binning that was used for
6.1. CORRELATION FUNCTION RESULTS 91

6.1.1 Results from 7 TeV proton data
Normalised, background-subtracted correlation plots were produced from
7 TeV pp data, following the binning outlined in table 6.1. The correlation plots
for three bins are shown in figure 6.1. The near and awayside yields extracted from
these are presented in figure 6.2, where they are compared with results from simu-
lated Monte-Carlo data. The multiplicities are scaled by the mean multiplicity to

account for the difference in slope between the multiplicity spectra in real and sim-
ulated data; with this correction applied the Monte-Carlo can be seen to describe
the data well.
The yields are expected to rise with multiplicity, as observed, due to a bias towards
harder collisions in higher multiplicity events. This effect is compounded on the
awayside by acceptance effects, with higher multiplicity events being more likely to
have both jets within the detector acceptance.

6.1.2 Results from 2.76 TeV proton data
Analogously to the previous section, normalised and background-subtracted correla-
tion plots were produced from
s = 2.76 TeV data and three such plots are shown
in figure 6.3. The near and awayside yields extracted from these are compared with
those from simulated Monte-Carlo data in figure 6.4. It can be seen that, with the
multiplicity scaled by the mean multiplicity, the Monte-Carlo data match the real
data well.
6.1.3 Results from ion data
As shown in table 6.1, two centrality binning schemes were used for
sNN =
2.76 TeV PbPb data, one spanning the full range of centrality from 90% to 0%,
and one spanning a more limited range from 90% to 70%, corresponding to the
multiplicity binning used for
s = 2.76 TeV pp data, to allow direct compari-
son between the two systems. Three sample plots from those binned over the full

binning scheme are presented in figure 6.6.
Near and awayside yields extracted from the correlation plots over the full range of
multiplicity are presented in figure 6.7. For consistency with the pp data, central-
ities are expressed in terms of multiplicity rather than as a percentage. It can be
seen that the awayside yield falls in increasingly central collisions, while the same is
not the case for the nearside yield. This suppression of the awayside is interpreted
as a consequence of jet quenching.
6.2 Yield comparisons between systems
As described in section 4.7, it would be expected that jet quenching would suppress
the awayside yield relative to the nearside, causing the away/nearside yield ratio
to fall in PbPb collisions of increasing centrality. Figure 6.8 shows this ratio as
a function of increasing centrality (expressed in terms of multiplicity as well as

centrality percentile) from PbPb data. It can be seen that the ratio does indeed
fall for more central collisions.
Presented in figure 6.9 is the away/near yield ratio as a function of multiplicity
(scaled by mean multiplicity [40]) for pp collisions at
s = 7 TeV and
2.76 TeV, compared with results from Pythia simulations of the same energies. The
ratios are observed to rise with multiplicity, an effect which is expected as a conse-
quence of a bias in higher multiplicity bins towards dijet events with both jets inside
the detector acceptance. This behaviour was reproduced in a Monte-Carlo model,
and was also observed in Pythia data as shown on the plot.
The ratio for
s = 7 TeV data, for which stronger QGP effects would be expected
(if present at all), is consistently lower than that for
s = 2.76 TeV data. However,
as the ratio was not observed to fall or to plateau at a value of less than 1 at
higher multiplicities, and as this was broadly consistent with Pythia, this cannot be
interpreted as evidence for QGP production. This is consistent with other results
indicating that dijet production cross sections in pp collisions are generally well-
described by QCD predictions [100].

6.2. YIELD COMPARISONS BETWEEN SYSTEMS 100
The yield ratios extracted from
s = 2.76 TeV pp collisions were also compared
to those from peripheral
sNN = 2.76 TeV PbPb collisions. These results are
presented in figure 6.10. It can be seen that while the yield ratios for the two systems
match closely at low multiplicities, at higher multiplicities the yields diverge and the
peripheral PbPb data do not exhibit the rise with multiplicity observed in the pp
data.
The divergence between the two distributions is interpreted as being a consequence
of the differing mechanisms by which a high multiplicity event can be produced  in
proton collisions, high multiplicities are generally produced in events with two hard
jets, both of which are produced within the detector acceptance. While this mech-
anism also occurs in PbPb events it is possible, and indeed more likely, to produce
high multiplicities from a superposition of many soft nucleonnucleon collisions 
results from the Monte-Carlo Glauber model described in appendix C indicate that
a PbPb event with 50 tracks typically has around 10 participants and 25 binary
nucleonnucleon collisions. As these events are generally more isotropic than a typ-
ical dijet event, the acceptance effects are not as pronounced and the rise of yield
ratio with multiplicity is not observed.
The results presented in this chapter indicate that high multiplicity pp collisions
are dominantly jet-like and therefore non-thermal, and hence are not equivalent to
peripheral PbPb collisions of comparable multiplicity. Broadly speaking, this is
because jet suppression is a soft QCD effect in an extended deconfined medium,
but multiplicity in proton collisions is correlated not with the size of any produced
medium but instead with the number of jets inside the detector acceptance.

6.3 Systematic uncertainties
The most significant sources of systematic uncertainty in the yield analysis arose
from the subtraction of the uncorrelated pedestal background, and from the choice
of track cuts. To quantify the extent of these effects, the pedestal subtraction scheme
and track cuts were varied, and the spread of the results calculated according to [99].
The following pedestal subtraction schemes were used:
1. ZYAM method as described in section 4.7.
2. As method 1, but with a ZYAM background region twice as wide.
3. As method 1, but with the ZYAM background region fixed to the geometric
midpoint between the two peaks.
4. Background extracted from a fit of the correlation plots to two peaks plus a
constant.
The following sets of track cuts were used:
6.3. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES 102
1. TPC tracks as defined in section 4.1.1.
2. Moderately tight cuts:
(a) Combined ITS+TPC tracks.
(b) At least 70 TPC clusters.
(c) Same DCA requirements as (1).
3. Tight cuts:
(a) Combined ITS+TPC tracks.
(b) At least 70 TPC clusters.
(c) Maximum DCA to vertex in beam direction DCAz < 2 cm.
The yields and ratios extracted from
s = 2.76 TeV pp data using these various
methods are presented in figure 6.11. The same method was used to calculate
systematic uncertainties for the other analysed datasets, but the plots are not shown
here.

CHAPTER 7
JET SHAPE DEPENDENCE ON
MULTIPLICITY
This chapter presents the results of the analysis of jet shape dependence on event
multiplicity. The analysis uses the same data as used in the yield analysis. As
detailed in section 4.1, this comprised data from pp collisions at
s = 7 TeV and
s = 2.76 TeV and PbPb collisions as
sNN = 2.76 TeV.
The multiplicity and centrality binning was unchanged from that outlined in ta-
ble 6.1, with the exception that the highest multiplicity bin was removed from the
s = 2.76 TeV pp data and the most peripheral removed from the peripheral
PbPb data. This was necessitated by there being insufficient statistics in these
bins for a reliable fit.
As with the yield analysis, trigger and associated pT bins of 8 < pTt < 15 GeV and
7.1. CORRELATION FUNCTION RESULTS 105
3 < pTa < 8 GeV were used. Combined statistical and systematic uncertainties are
shown on the plots as brackets around the statistical error bars; the method used
for calculating these is presented in section 7.4.
7.1 Correlation function results
As described in section 4.6.1, the normalised correlation plots shown in section 6.1
were fit to the function given in equation 4.9 of two nearside Gaussians, one awayside
Gaussian and a constant background. The results of these fits are shown for some
sample multiplicity bins for all collision systems and beam energies in figures 7.17.4.
7.2 Correlation peak widths
The peak widths N,A extracted from the fits to pp data are presented in figure 7.5,
and those from PbPb data are presented in figure 7.6. The nearside peak widths
were taken as the combined widths of the two nearside Gaussians in the fit, as
defined in equation 4.10.
Extraction of
k2T from these correlation functions was not possible using the
method described in this document. Multiplicity in a jet event is a product of
both Q2 (with harder scattering causing higher jet multiplicity) and acceptance
effects (with high multiplicity jet events being more likely to have both jets inside
the detector acceptance), requiring a proper treatment of jet fragmentation in the
model used for the extraction of kT. This is beyond the scope of a model such as
that used in this work.
However, given that in heavy ion collisions the majority of the observed multiplicity
originates from soft processes, in the absence of medium effects the shape of the

correlation function (for sufficiently high pT hadrons) is independent of centrality.
Figure 7.6a shows a slight downward trend in A with increasing centrality, but
given the systematic uncertainties it is difficult to draw conclusions.
The near and awayside peak widths measured in pp collisions are consistent with
being independent of multiplicity, as are the nearside peak widths measured in
PbPb collisions.
7.3 Shape results
Figure 7.7 shows the values of the RMS jet fragmentation transverse momentum
j2T, extracted from pp and peripheral PbPb data according to the method
described in section 4.6.1. It can be seen that for all systems,
j2T is constant at
around
j2T  0.8 GeV. This is consistent with the minimum bias proton results
presented in section 5.2.

j2T results for PbPb data over the full range of centrality are shown in
figure 7.8. A slight downward trend is visible, with
j2T decreasing slightly in in-
creasingly central collisions. As mentioned above, in the absence of medium effects
the hard processes are expected to be independent of centrality, and thus this may
be interpreted as a consequence of interaction with the medium. With no observed
N narrowing, this effect can be caused by a suppression of the high pT hadrons in
the jet; this would be qualitatively consistent with measurements at other experi-
ments [101].
7.4 Systematics
As with the analysis of jT and kT in minimum bias pp data presented in chapter 5,
the largest sources of systematic uncertainty in the study of jet shape and imbalance
as a function of multiplicity were the choice of track cuts and the choice of scheme
used to extract the peak widths. To determine the magnitude of these effects the
7.4. SYSTEMATICS 113
same procedure was used as that detailed in section 5.4: various track cuts and
width determination schemes were used and the spread of the results calculated
following [99].
The following sets of track cuts were used:
1. TPC tracks as defined in section 4.1.1.
2. Moderately tight cuts:
(a) Combined ITS+TPC tracks.
(b) At least 70 TPC clusters.
(c) Same DCA requirements as (1).
3. Tight cuts:
(a) Combined ITS+TPC tracks.
(b) At least 70 TPC clusters.
(c) Maximum DCA to vertex in beam direction DCAz < 2 cm.
The following mechanisms were used to extract the peak widths:
1. Two nearside Gaussians, one awayside Gaussian plus a constant, as described
in section 4.6.1.
2. Widths taken as background-subtracted RMSs of the distributions in the peak
regions, with the background determined in the non-peak region under the
assumption that between the peaks existed a region of zero jet yield.
3. As method 2, but with different widths for the defined peak and back-
ground regions.

Peak widths N,A extracted from minimum bias triggered
s = 7 TeV pp data are

CHAPTER 8
CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
This thesis presents an analysis of the properties of jets in protonproton and lead
lead collisions at the ALICE experiment at the CERN LHC, using the technique of
two-particle azimuthal correlations.
The analysis studied a sample of 45M minimum bias triggered pp events at
2.76 TeV, 52M minimum bias triggered pp events at
s = 7 TeV and 18M min-
imum bias triggered PbPb events at
sNN = 2.76 TeV, from data taking periods
in 2010 and 2011. During the
s = 7 TeV pp running period, a high multiplicity
trigger was also in operation which was utilised to extend the multiplicity reach of
the analysis.
Two-particle azimuthal correlations were used to analyse the dependence of jet shape
and momentum imbalance on hadron pT in minimum bias pp collisions. The jet
shape, quantified by the jet fragmentation transverse momentum jT, was found to
be independent of hadron pT and to have a value of
j2T  0.8 GeV. This is
higher than values measured at other experiments with lower beam energies (for
example the values of around 0.6 GeV measured in
s = 200 GeV proton collisions
at RHIC); this is qualitatively consistent with QCD expectations. The expected
difference in
j2T between the two beam energies studied here is too small to
be identified in the measured results. Jet acoplanarity, quantified by the RMS net
partonic transverse momentum
k2T, was found to increase with collision energy
and also with the transverse momentum of the particles in the jet.
Azimuthal correlations were also used to analyse the dependence of jet yield on mul-
tiplicity in pp collisions and centrality in PbPb collisions. The ratio of awayside
to nearside yield was examined, a technique sensitive to jet suppression through
interaction with a deconfined medium. In PbPb collisions this suppression was
observed as expected, but no suppression was observed in high multiplicity pp
collisions (which were well described by simulated Pythia data).
An analysis of the dependence of jet shape and transverse momentum imbalance on
multiplicity/centrality was also performed, with the multiplicity dependence of the
jet transverse momentum imbalance quantified with the width of the awayside peak.
Although a slight downwards trend was identified in PbPb collisions of increasing
centrality, firm conclusions could not be drawn due to the systematic uncertainty.
The jet width was measured to have no dependence on multiplicity with a value
j2T  0.8 GeV in pp and peripheral PbPb collisions, consistent with the
measurement in minimum bias pp data. Some indication was observed of a fall in
central PbPb collisions which, in the absence of a corresponding narrowing of the
nearside peak width, was interpreted as a suppression of the high pT hadrons in the
jets.
The study of in-medium parton energy loss manifesting as measurable jet quenching
is an area of active theoretical work, with various approaches used to describe the in-
teractions with the medium. Experimental study of different jet-related observables
can be used to constrain and discriminate between these models. Two such observ-
ables, which are analysed in this thesis, are the jet yields and shapes; both of these
are closely related to quantities which can be extracted from models [102, 103, 104].
As an improvement of this analysis for the future, the Monte-Carlo method for
extracting
k2T could be developed further by introducing a jet pT dependent
fragmentation function. It would also be informative to analyse jet width and
acoplanarity through full event-by-event jet reconstruction.
APPENDIX A
KINEMATICS OF PARTICLE
COLLISIONS
Throughout this document, standard high energy physics notation is used. Some
commonly used kinematic quantities are defined here.
When describing particle interactions, the Lorentz invariant Mandelstam variable s
is defined in terms of a two-particle scattering process 1 + 2 3 + 4 as
s = (p1 + p2)
2 = (p3 + p4)
2 (A-1)
where p1,2,3,4 are the four-momenta of the incoming and outgoing particles. While
high energy proton collisions are not simple two-particle processes such as this, s
is generalised to refer to the momenta of the incoming protons. Thus,
s is equal
to the collision energy in the protonproton centre of mass frame, equivalent to the
laboratory frame in a colliding beam experiment with equal beam energies. When
describing heavy ion collisions, the energy is typically quantified by the nucleon
nucleon centre of mass collision energy
While the protonproton centre of mass frame is equivalent to the laboratory frame,
the colliding partons can have any fraction x of the total momentum of their parent
proton (described by the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) as outlined in sec-
tion 2.1), and so the centre of mass frame of a partonparton scattering is generally
boosted longitudinally to an unknown degree with respect to the laboratory frame.
As such, the component of momentum transverse to the beam direction pT, which
is invariant under this boost, is often used instead of the overall momentum when
describing the particles produced in a collision. In general, a subscript T typically
refers to the transverse component of a kinematic quantity such as this.
Another widely used kinematic variable is rapidity, defined as
E + pz
E  pz
(A-2)
where E and pz are a produced particles energy and longitudinal momentum re-
spectively. The difference in rapidity between two particles y is invariant under
a Lorentz boost in the longitudinal direction. As the mass and thus energy of a
particle is often not known, this is commonly approximated by the pseudorapidity
 =  ln(tan
) (A-3)
where  is the polar angle of a particle with respect to the beam direction. Pseudo-
rapidity is equal to rapidity in the limit that particle mass m 0.
APPENDIX B
MONTE-CARLO SOLVING FOR kt
As explained in section 4.6.3, a Monte-Carlo model was used to extract the final
values for net partonic transverse momentum kT, by solving
zt(kT, xh)
k2T
xh(kT, xh)
p2out 
(1 + x2h) (A-1)
(equation 4.15 in the main text). This section describes that model.
The model works by generating a large number of pairs of back-to-back partons,
according to a pT spectrum  defined as
 + pn1T
(A-2)
where  = 1 GeV (an unphysical momentum cutoff, required to prevent divergences
at low pT, on which the final result does not depend) and n is set such that the
measured hadron pT spectrum is reproduced within the pT range covered by the
analysis (assuming here that
k2T =
pTQ0 where Q0  1 GeV [98]). This leads
to values of n = 5.0 for
s = 2.76 TeV pp data, and n = 4.7 for
s = 7 TeV pp
data.
The partons are then Lorentz boosted in such a manner as to preserve the invariant
mass of the pair, resulting in the imbalance quantified by kT. This kT is drawn from
a two-dimensional Gaussian with  = kTinput, such that azimuthal angle is uniformly
distributed between 0 and 2. kTinput is set to a suitable input value, initially equal
to the right-hand-side of equation A-1. A limitation of the model is that it assumes
kT to be independent of parton pT, which is believed to not be the case at LHC
energies [56].
The partons are then fragmented into a pair of hadrons, according to a fragmentation
function D(z) parameterised as
D(z) = (1 z)0.88(1 + z)13.29z0.16. (A-3)
This parameterisation is obtained from e+e collision data [66, 105]. The fragmen-
tation process also adds a relatively small jT component to the hadrons following
the measured value of
j2T  0.6 GeV, as presented in section 5.2.
A large number of hadron pair dijets are generated in this manner and the mean
zt and xh, within pTt and pTa bins according the analysis, are output. From these,
k2T is calculated according to
k2T = RHS 
xh
(A-4)
where RHS refers to the right-hand-side of equation A-1. The generation process is
then repeated with the calculated kT as the new kTinput. This iterative process is
then repeated until the kT values converge, at which point a consistent value of kT
is deemed to have been calculated.
APPENDIX C
MONTE-CARLO GLAUBER MODEL
As described in section 4.3.2, to determine the centrality percentiles used in the anal-
ysis of heavy ion data, the multiplicity spectrum of that data was fit to a Glauber
model to describe the collision geometry, with a negative binomial distribution to
describe the particle production. This section describes said model, the basic con-
struction of which is well-established in heavy ion physics [82].
In the model, a large number of PbPb collisions are generated, with a multiplicity
calculated for each one. The first step is the determination of the position of the
nucleons (in spherical polar co-ordinates (r, , )) within each colliding nucleus. The
angles  and  are drawn randomly from flat distributions, and the radius r from a
Woods-Saxon distribution.
An impact parameter b is then generated randomly from the distribution dN/db =
b (up to a cutoff bmax  RPb, where RPb is the nucleus radius), and the nuclei

are positioned accordingly. It is assumed that the nucleons have no transverse
component of momentum, and that no interactions occur between nucleons of the
same nucleus. A collision between two nucleons is deemed to occur when their
relative transverse separation bNN <
NN/, where NN is the inelastic nucleon
nucleon cross section.
For each nucleusnucleus collison, the number of participants Npart and the number
of collisions Ncoll can then be counted. Npart is defined as the number of nucle-
ons which undergo at least one collision, and Ncoll as the total number of binary
nucleonnucleon collisions. The remaining nucleons, which do not collide, are termed
spectator nucleons.
The particle production is then assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution,
which has been seen to describe the data well at many experiments [106]. N part is
then defined as
N part =
Npart
NB(, ) (A-1)
with N coll defined similarly, where NB(, ) are randomly generated numbers sam-
pled from a negative binomial distribution with parameters  and , defined as
PNB, (n) =
(n+ )
(n+ 1)()
(/)n
(/+ 1)n+
. (A-2)
The observed particle multiplicity Ntracks is then calculated as
Ntracks = pN
part + (1 p)N
coll (A-3)
where p  [0, 1] defines the relative contribution of Npart and Ncoll. In this manner,
the Ntracks distribution for a large number of events can be calculated; the depen-
dence of Ntracks on Npart and Ncoll is shown in figure A-1. This is then repeated
for many p,  and , in order to best fit the resultant distribution to the observed
multiplicity distribution. As explained in section 4.3.2, this 2 minimisation was
performed in the region above 25 tracks, to minimise the contamination from elec-
tromagnetic interactions.
