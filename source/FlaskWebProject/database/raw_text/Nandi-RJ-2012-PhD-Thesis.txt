Abstract
An exclusion of Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking at 95% confidence level is
made in the squark mass vs gluino mass parameter space using 1.1 fb1 of proton-proton
collisions data from the Large Hadron Collider. The event selection is based on the strong
production signature of photons, jets and missing transverse energy. Missing transverse
energy is used to distinguish signal from background. The background is estimated with
a data driven technique. The CLs method is used to exclude models with squark mass
and gluino mass up to around 1 TeV.

Chapter 1
Introduction
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [13] was built to explore the TeV energy scale with
proton-proton collisions to increase our understanding of particle physics. Two general
purpose detectors at the LHC, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) [6] and A Toroidal
LHC AparatuS (ATLAS) [14], were designed specifically for this purpose. The main focus
of the analysis at these experiments in terms of new physics has been to search for the
Higgs boson, which is predicted by the electroweak theory in the Standard Model (SM)
[15] but has not been observed, and Supersymmetry (SUSY) [16] which is a theory of new
physics beyond the SM which seeks to solve the hierarchy problem [17].
SUSY is a theory with many parameters and many possible experimental signatures de-
pending on the value of these parameters. This thesis searches for a restricted set of SUSY
models in the data based on the experimental signature of photons, jets and missing trans-
verse energy ( + jets + /ET ) and puts a limit on the cross-section of these models. The
exclusion limit is compared with the results of other analyses looking at the same models.
The introductory section below sets out the units and conventions used in this thesis which
are standard in particle physics and an outline of the thesis is given.
1.1 Units and Conventions
In this thesis natural units are used (c = ~ = 1) to naturally embody special relativity
and quantum effects. So all energies, momenta and masses are given in units of energy
(e.g. GeV).
For lengths and times where special relativity is not important (e.g. detector size) metres
(m) and seconds (s) will be used.
Greek letters (e.g. , ) are reserved for Lorentz indices and take values 0, 1, 2, 3 with the
0-index corresponding to the energy/time component and the other indices corresponding
to the momentum/spatial components.
Latin letters (e.g. a, i) are used for all other index requirements.
Following Einsteins summation convention repeated indices are summed over. For exam-
ple, the component of the spin sa in the direction of the momentum pa, known as the
helicity, can be written as in Equation 1.1.
sapa
s1p1 + s2p2 + s3p3
p1p1 + p2p2 + p3p3
~s  ~p
|~p| (1.1)
When Lorentz indices are involved use of the Minkowski metric,  = diag(1,1,1,1),
is implied. In this thesis there is no distinction between up indices (e.g. p) and
down indices (e.g. p). For example, the invariant mass squared of a particle with
four-momentum p is pp (Equation 1.2).
pp = p0p0  p1p1  p2p2  p3p3
= E2  |~p|2
= m2 (1.2)
Spherical polar co-ordinates (r, , ) are used for detector co-ordinates. The nominal
interaction point at the centre of the detector is (0, 0, 0). The beam axis is the z-axis.
Often pseudorapidity  is used in place of : there is a one-to-one mapping between the
two. Pseudorapidity is defined in Equation 1.3. The backward direction, parallel to the
beam pipe, has  = 0 and  = . The forward direction, also parallel to the beam pipe,
has  =  and  = +. The direction perpendicular to the beam pipe has  = 
 = 0.
 =  ln tan 
(1.3)
There is a difference between detector pseudorapidity defined with respect to the nominal
interaction point and the pseudorapidity of a particle, which is measured with respect
to the interaction vertex. Pseudorapidity is closely related to the rapidity, y, which is
given by Equation 1.4. The rapidity has the useful property that it is invariant under
Lorentz boosts along the z-axis. For relativistic particles (E  m), the pseudorapidity is
equivalent to the rapidity.

Cylindrical co-ordinates (, z, ) are used to describe radius from the beampipe and po-
sition of primary vertices from the interaction point.

1.2 Outline of this thesis
This thesis describes a search for Gauge Mediated SUSY Breaking (GMSB) in events with
photons, jets and missing transverse energy from proton-proton collisions data at centre-
of-mass energy
s = 7 TeV taken by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector.
The theory of the standard model of particle physics is outlined placing emphasis on the
structure of the theory and giving the key experimental results that support the theories.
Problems with the standard model and reasons to expect to find new physics at the TeV
scale are considered. SUSY is introduced as a possible extension to the standard model
which solves the problem of the theoretical calculation of the Higgs boson mass being
a divergent series. The particular flavour of SUSY considered in this thesis, GMSB, is
introduced along with its parameters. Previous results on the exclusion of GMSB from
LEP, Tevatron and LHC are mentioned.
The CMS detector is described focussing particularly on those aspects which are relevant
to this thesis. The key performance measures for each component of the detector are given.
Justifications have been made for design choices and the implications for this analysis have
been given to put the information in context. The trigger and computing model which are
important aspects of the data taking and analysis are also described. The reconstruction
of photons and jets, the main physics objects used in this analysis, are detailed along with
the selection variables associated with these physics objects.
The dataset and trigger used in this search are described. Simulated data are examined
and compared to the experimentally observed data to establish what the simulation mod-
els well and what it does not. The event selection is motivated by the signature of GMSB:
photons, jets and missing transverse energy. The object selection cuts are listed and the
event varibles used to search for GMSB are examined.
The background to the search comes mainly from QCD processes which have fake missing
transverse energy due to the detector resolution. The sources of background are listed and
their properties and relative sizes are examined. Simulated samples are used to validate
the data-driven QCD background model and estimate the small electroweak backgrounds.
The prediction of the number of signal events is made and all the sources of system-
atic uncertainty are considered. A range of possible signals with different parameters are
considered. The signal efficiency is determined by applying the event selection to the
simulated data. The sources of systematic uncertainty are investigated and their effect on
the signal prediction is evaluated.
The CLs method [18] is used to determine the magnitude of the signal that can be excluded
at 95% confidence level. An exclusion plot in GMSB parameter space is given based on
this analysis and compared with other analyses looking at the same signal.
1.3 Other Work
In a collaboration the size of CMS, no ones work is independent. Everyone relies on
the work of others for the detector operation, the data taking, the trigger, the object
reconstruction, the jet energy corrections etc. With the exception of these obvious exam-
ples, almost all the work presented in this thesis is my own including the event selection,
the background estimation, the signal prediction, the determination of systematic uncer-
tainties and the limit setting. The only exceptions are the cross-section calculations and
corresponding uncertainties in Section 6.6 and the photon efficiency correction in Section
In addition to the work included in this thesis, I also worked on anomalous energy deposits
in the electromagnetic calorimeter and a technique to measure the missing transverse
energy in W events, which is important for the W cross-section measurement, using Z  ee
events from data.

2.1 Introduction
In this chapter a brief historical background of the standard model (SM) is given with some
of the results that inform our current understanding. The role of symmetry in particle
physics is discussed and the gauge structure of the SM is examined. The motivation
for new physics at the TeV scale is considered. A brief description of supersymmetry,
a popular possible extension to the SM, is given and the ideas behind it are discussed.
Finally, the current exclusion limits on GMSB are reviewed.
2.2 The Standard Model
The SM of particle physics [19, 20, 21] contains our knowledge of the fundamental particles
and the forces between them. Figure 2.1 shows the fundamental particles and the force
carriers according to our current knowledge.
Historically the SM was formed by trying to understand atomic spectra. In 1928 Dirac
came up with the Dirac equation to describe electrons [22], which was the first theory to
deal with relativity and quantum mechanics. Later QED a theory of the interactions of
light with matter was developed by Richard Feynman (among others) [23] which explained
the Lamb shift in Hydrogen [24] and made a very precise prediction for the magnetic mo-
ment of the electron [25].
The neutrino was postulated by Pauli in 1930 [26] to explain the continuous electron en-

ergy spectrum in -decay. The neutrino was discovered by direct detection in 1956 [27]
by inverse beta decay in a huge detector of water with CdCl2 dissolved in it next to the
Savannah River nuclear reactor. Three flavours of neutrinos corresponding to each of the
leptons has been discovered. More recently neutrino oscillations have been observed in
which neutrinos can change flavour [28]. The flavour change happens due to a difference
between the mass eigenstates and the flavour eigenstates indicating that neutrinos have a
non-zero mass.
After the discovery of many new hadrons, e.g. , K, , , it became clear that the neu-
tron and proton are not fundamental particles, but made up of more basic constituents.
Gell-Mann and Zweig independenty came up with the quark model in which all hadrons
are made up of quarks [29]. There are 6 flavours of quarks with different masses: u, d, c,
s, t, b. Each flavour of quark comes in three different colors. Quarks carry color charge
and form an SU(3) color triplet. Quarks are not observed as free particles, but only in
colorless bound states.
An experiment by C. S. Wu and collaborators [30] showed that parity is violated in weak
interactions. The beta decay of Co60 was performed in a magnetic field and at low tem-
perature to polarise the nuclei and the angular distribution of electrons was measured.
An asymmetry in the distribution between  and 180   (where  is the angle between
the electron momentum and the orientation of the parent nucleus) was observed providing
unequivocal proof that parity is not conserved in beta decay. This is represented in the
SM by the vector minus axial vector structure of the weak interaction and the consequent
presence of chiral fermions.
Electroweak theory was introduced by Glashow, Salam and Weinberg [31, 32] who pro-
posed that the electromagnetic force and the weak force are parts of the same theory. The
W and Z0 bosons were predicted to have have masses in the ratio mW
= cos W , where
W is the weak mixing angle. The W
 and Z0 bosons were discovered by the UA1 and
UA2 experiments [33] at CERN. Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer won the Nobel
Prize for Physics in 1983 for their decisive contributions toward the discovery.
The Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP) [34] made e+e collisions to search for new
physics and make precision electroweak measurements. The collision centre of mass energy
could be tuned to generate many Z bosons. Looking at the Z width for decays to invisible
particles relative to the total Z width indicates that there are exactly three flavours of
neutrino into which the Z can decay [35].
2.3 Gauge Symmetries of the SM
There is an important connection between symmetries and conservation laws discovered
by Noether [36].
For every symmetry of the theory there is a conserved quantity.
Invariance under translations in time and space give rise to energy and momentum con-
servation. Invariance under rotation gives rise to conservation of angular momentum. To-
gether with Lorentz invariance and parity these transformations form the Poincare group.
Describing symmetries in terms of group theory was developed by Galois in the 19th Cen-
tury and was initially used to test the solvability of polynomial equations [37]. These
symmetries are all global, meaning that the transformation is the same for all space-time
points.
A theory can be described by a Lagrangian which is equal to the kinetic energy minus the
potential energy. The equations of motion of such a theory can be derived by minimising
the action (Equation 2.1).
Ld4x (2.1)
Consider a Lagrangian with N scalar fields (x) = (1(x
), ..., N (x
)), where x is the
space-time co-ordinate as in Equation 2.2.
L = L(, , x
) (2.2)
Suppose that this Lagrangian is invariant under the gauge transformation given in Equa-
tion 2.3, where the phase is composed of the parameters a (x) and the generators of the
Lie group T a. This is a local gauge symmetry rather than a global symmetry since the
phase depends on the space-time point.
(x) (x)eiaTa (2.3)
Noethers theorem gives a powerful way of constructing theories based on symmetry which
underpins the structure of the standard model. The gauge symmetry of the SM is SU(3)
SU(2) U(1) [38, 39]. SU(3) corresponds to QCD and SU(2) U(1) corresponds to the
electroweak sector. The gauge structure and matter fields constitute the SM.
2.3.1 Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)
The QED Lagrangian for electromagnetic interactions of electrons can be written as Equa-
tion 2.4.
L = 1
FF + D me (2.4)
The first term represents the free electromagnetic field. F = A  A, where A
is the electromagnetic vector potential. The second term represents the electron kinetic
energy and the interaction between electron and photon. D =  ieA is the covariant
derivative (i.e. it transforms in the same way as  under the gauge transformation). The
third term represents the mass of the electron. This Lagrangian is invariant under the
U(1) gauge transformation given by Equation 2.6.
  ei(x) (2.5)
A  A +
(x) (2.6)
The mass term for the electron is allowed by gauge invariance, but a mass term for the
photon is forbidden. Also photon self-interactions are forbidden by gauge invariance. The
constraints set by experiments and embodied in gauge invariance describe well the nature
of the electromagentic interaction. The photon is a massless particle which interacts with
electrons, but not with itself. The electromagnetic force has infinite range.
QED has been tested to very high precision. Consider the magnetic moment of the electron
given by Equation 2.7.
~ = gB
(2.7)
where B is the Bohr magneton, ~ is the Planck constant, ~S is the electron spin and g is
a constant factor.
According to Diracs theory g = 2, however QED predicts quantum corrections to this
value. The QED prediction agrees with the experimentally measured value [23] to more
than 10 significant figures:
g  2
= 0.00115965218073(28) (2.8)
2.3.2 The Electroweak Sector
The symmetries of the electroweak interaction are SU(2) weak isospin and U(1) hyper-
charge. SU(2) is the special unitary group of 2  2 matrices U satisfying UU  = I and
det(U) = 1. The generators of SU(2) are the Pauli matrices a, a = 1, 2, 3, which are
given in Equation 2.9.

 (2.9)
Table 2.1 defines the symbols for the groups of the electroweak sector of the SM, the cor-
responding fields and the generators.
Consider a scalar field, , which is a doublet with respect to SU(2) and with U(1) hyper-
charge Y = 1
. The bosonic sector of the electroweak lagrangain can be written as:
L = 1

where
F a = A
  Aa + gabcAbAc (2.11)
G = B  B (2.12)
D =  i

The final term is the scalar field potential with a quadratic and quartic term assuming a
non-zero vaccuum expectation value for . There is a continuum of ground states giving
equivalent physics, one of which must be chosen by nature. Choosing a particular ground
state is known as symmetry breaking. Arbitrarily choose:
A = 0 B = 0 0 =
 (2.14)
Finding the unbroken generator, Q, such that Q0 = 0 and Q is hermitian gives:
 1 0
 (2.15)
Q = T 3 + Y (2.16)
The unbroken generator corresponds to the subgroup U(1)em of SU(2)U(1). This should
correspond to a massless gauge field  the electromagnetic field. U(1)em is not the same
as the U(1) component in SU(2)U(1) so the electromagnetic potential, A (without su-
perscript) is not B, but a linear combination of the fields A
 and B.
Consider small perturbations around the ground state:
v +H(x)
 (2.17)
Thus we get the following expression for D:
D =
A1  iA2
(v +H(x))
gB  gA3
(v +H(x)) + 1

 (2.18)
Introduce new fields:

g2 + g2
(gA3  gB) = cos WA3  sin WB (2.20)
g2 + g2
(gB  gA3) = sin WA3 + cos WB (2.21)
Z and A are rotations of the original fields with angle W which satisfies Equation 2.22.
cos W =
g2 + g2
sin W =
g2 + g2
(2.22)
Z and A are determined by the necessity that the covariant derivative, D, does not
contain A  it must be invariant under the electromagnetic gauge transformation. To
quadratic order the Lagrangian can be written as:
L = 1

where
W = W  W (2.27)
Z = Z  Z (2.28)
The physical fields can be seen from the Lagrangian and are summarised in Table 2.2.
Thus electroweak theory predicts mixing between the electromagnetic and weak forces and
the existence of W and Z0 bosons with masses in the ratio given by Equation 2.29.
= cos W (2.29)
The electric charge is connected to the weak mixing angle by:
e = g sin W (2.30)
The existence of the W and Z0 bosons was confirmed experimentally by the UA1 and
UA2 experiments in CERN [33]. The W mass measured by UA2 [40] and the Z mass
measured by the LEP experiments [34] are:
mW = 80.35 0.33 0.17 GeV mZ = 91.1875 0.0021 GeV (2.31)
The weak mixing angle, W , was measured independently [41] to satisfy sin
2 W = 0.23 in
good agreement with the predictions of the electroweak theory.
Both leptons and quarks feel the weak interaction. The W interact only with left-handed
fermions. Handedness (or chirality) is the eigenvalue of the 5 matrix (5 = i0123
where  are the 4 4 gamma matrices of the Dirac equation shown using the Weyl basis
in 2  2 block form in Equation 2.32). Handedness corresponds to the helicity (the pro-
jection of the spin onto the direction of motion) in the relativistic limit E >> m. The
left-handed and right-handed components of a fermion  can be projected out using the
operators 1
(1 5) and 1
(1 + 5) respectively.
 0 I2
 k =
 0 
k 0
 (2.32)
The left handed components form SU(2) doublets while the right handed components are
singlets under SU(2) as in Equation 2.33 for leptons and Equation 2.34 for quarks.
eR (2.33)
uR dR (2.34)
The quark couplings are:
Lquark =
L (Qp)L + (up)R i
R (up)R +
R (dp)R
(2.35)
where p is an index over the three generations.
The three generation are not separate but interact with each other through flavour chang-
ing charged currents. These interactions are described by the CKM (Cabbibo, Kobayashi,
Maskawa) matrix. Equation 2.36 shows the current best experimentally determined values
for the magnitude of the elements in the CKM matrix. For example, the top decays almost
exclusively to the b quark (t bW+) as in Figure 2.2 since |Vtb|  1.

Figure 2.3: Gluon self-interactions occur because gluons carry colour charge. This is due
to the non-abelian nature of SU(3).
2.3.3 Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
SU(3) is the symmetry group of the strong force which is composed of special unitary 33
matrices. Particles which interact via the strong force carry colour charge. Quarks come
in 3 colours denoted r, g and b. There are 8 gluons which correspond to the 8 generators
of SU(3). Gluons carry colour charge and so interact with each other because SU(3) is a
non-abelian group, which means that the group elements do not commute.
Since the data used in this thesis come from a proton collider, the structure of the proton
needs to be considered when making predictions. Particularly cross-section predictions
rely on knowledge of the Parton Density Functions (PDFs) within the proton.
The Hadron Electron Ring Accelerator (HERA) made electron proton collisions to de-
termine the structure of the proton. Deep inelastic scattering in the H1 [42] and ZEUS
[43] detectors revealed that the structure functions of the proton are independent of the
momentum transfer, Q, and dependent only on x =
, where p is the momentum of the
incoming electron and q is the momentum of the exchanged virtual photon [44]. This is
called Bjorken scaling and led to the parton model in which the proton is made of partons
which carry a fraction, x, of the proton momentum. Figure 2.4 shows the independence
of the cross-section with Q2 over 5 orders of magnitude.
The PDFs are the probability distribution for the fraction of the proton momentum carried
by each parton. The PDFs need to be known to make reliable Monte Carlo simulations
and cross-section predictions for the LHC. Figure 2.5 shows the parton density functions
measured by H1 and ZEUS.
The coupling strength of the strong force varies with energy. The strong force is strong
at low energies where quarks exist only in colourless bound states. This is known as
confinement. At high energies the strong force becomes weaker as the partons behave as
free particles. This is known as asymptotic freedom. Figure 2.6 shows the variation in
coupling strength of the strong, weak and electromagnetic force as a function of energy.
2.4 Motivation for new physics at the TeV scale
The motivations for expecting the discovery of new physics at the TeV scale are considered.
WW scattering
WW scattering (among other similar processes) has been observed at the Large Electron
Positron (LEP) collider and the cross-section has been measured. Without additional
couplings the interaction violates unitarity. The Higgs boson is one mechansim to mediate
this interaction, but so far the Higgs has not been observed. Whatever the mechanism
by which this interaction occurs it must be at the TeV energy scale to avoid violating
unitarity [19].

magnitude. Reproduced from [2].

2.1.2 Problems of the Standard Model
Although the Standard Model describes the fundamental particles and their interactions with great suc-
cess, there are some unsolved problems that point towards an extension of the model. Some of them
are intrinsic problems, some arise from cosmological measurements and some have a pure theoretical
nature:
 General: There is no explanation for the observed multiplet structure and mass hierarchy.
 Unification: The quark-to-lepton charge relation is puzzling and there is no unification of the
coupling constants at a high scale.
 Astrophysical: There is an unexplained matter-antimatter-asymmetry in the universe and the mat-
ter is mainly made of unknown dark matter.
 Intrinsic: The stability of the Higgs mass cannot be understood in a natural way.
 Theoretical: Gravity is not included in the Standard Model.
The first item expresses part of the fact that the Standard Model includes many ad-hoc assumptions and
free parameters that cannot be justified or calculated within the model itself. This leads to the hope that
there is a more fundamental underlying theory that overcomes this problem. Attempts have been made
by defining Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) [20], which have a simpler gauge group (such as SU(5) or
SO(10)) and thus have fewer coupling constants and a simpler multiplet structure. Within such models
also the quark-to-lepton charge relation can be calculated, but other problems, such as the instability
of the proton, require new ideas. Another problem related to GUTs is the unification of the coupling
constants, which cannot be achieved within the Standard Model. This can be solved by the formulation
of supersymmetric theories [21, 22, 23], where the running couplings converge in one point at the GUT
scale, as depicted in Fig. 2.4. Also the proton is stable enough in supersymmetric GUTs.

(solid lines) as a function of the energy scale [23].
Figure 2.5: Loop corrections to m2H from (a) a fermion f with mass m f and (b) of a heavy complex scalar
with mass mS [23].
The third item touches the problem of CP violation. The complex phase of the CKM matrix is the
only source of CP violation in the Standard Model, but it is not sufficient to explain the cosmologically
observed matter-antimatter-asymmetry in the universe [24, 25, 26]. Supersymmetric extensions of the
Standard Model contain the possibility to have up to 43 additional complex phases [27]. Another impor-
tant cosmological observation is the fact that the matter described by the Standard Model accounts for
only 4% of the content of the universe. Around 76% is made of dark energy, which is responsible for
the accelerated expansion of the universe, while around 20% is made of dark matter [28]. If dark matter
is made of particles that can be described by particle physics, then these particles must only interact via
the weak interactions and/or gravitational interactions. The only candidate in the Standard Model is the
neutrino, which is excluded to be the only source of the observed gravitational effects of dark matter due
to its very small mass. Again, supersymmetric theories provide good possibilities to solve this problem.
Depending on the model they have a variety of candidate particles that could account for the observed
amount of dark matter, such as the lightest neutralinos or the gravitinos.
The fourth item has to do with the Higgs mechanism, that has been invented to solve the problem of
symmetry breaking in the Standard Model, but causes new problems itself [29, 30, 31, 32]. The Higgs
mass squared m2H receives enormous quantum corrections from loop effects of every particle coupling to
the Higgs. Figure 2.5 shows a corrections to m2H from a fermion f with mass m f . If the coupling reads
as "" fH f f , then the contribution to the Higgs mass is
m2H = "

mass mf and (b) a scalar S with mass mS .
New energy scale
This is simply the observation that while exploring a higher energy scale than has previ-
ously been explored one can expect to find new things. In the same way as when explorers
explore a new land they can expect to see things they have not seen before.
Hierarchy Problem
The hierarchy problem is fundamentally a problem of scale [17]. There are two funda-
mental energy scales in physics: the Electroweak scale ( 100 GeV) and the Planck scale
( 1018 GeV), where gravity becomes as strong as the gauge interactions. Certainly at
the Planck scale the SM will no longer hold because a quantum treatment of gravity is
needed. The Electroweak scale is well measured at colliders and the results form our
current understanding of particle physics. New physics can affect the mass of the Higgs
boson through loop corrections.
The one-loop quantum correction to the Higgs mass squared in Figure 2.7(a) with a fermion
coupling fff and a cut-off energy  is given by Equation 2.37.
m2H = 
|f |2
2 + ... (2.37)
For a scalar coupling S ||2|S|2 and a cut-off  the one-loop quantum correction to m2H
from Figure 2.7(b) is given by Equation 2.38.
m2H =
2 + ... (2.38)
The one-loop quantum corrections to m2H are quadratically divergent depending on the
cut-off used to do the calculation. In supersymmetry this problem is solved by introducing
a symmetry between fermions and bosons. For every SM particle there is a supersymmet-
ric partner which is a boson for fermions and a fermion for bosons. The fermions give a
-1 contribution to m2H while the bosons give a +1 contribution cancelling each other.
Dark Matter candidates
Only 5% of the mass/energy in the universe is normal matter that we observe. The re-
mainder is made up of dark matter (25%) and Dark Energy (70%) [45]. Dark energy is
an unknown that is introduced to explain the expansion of the universe. Dark matter is
well known.
The existence of dark matter is inferred from its gravitational interaction with normal
matter. Dark matter was postulated as unobserved mass to account for the orbital ve-
locities of galaxies in clusters [46]. There have since been other observations that have
confirmed the existence of dark matter including the rotational speed of galaxies [47] and
the bullet cluster [48].
The bullet cluster provides the best evidence yet on the nature of dark matter. It consists
of two colliding clusters of galaxies. The visible matter (stars) pass straight through slowed
only by gravitation. The hot gas that represents most of the normal matter is detected
through X-rays. The hot gas slows more than the stars due to its electromagnetic inter-
actions. Another piece of information comes from gravitational lensing. In the absence
of dark matter the gravitational lensing is expected to follow the normal matter (i.e. the
X-ray gas). However, the gravitational lensing is strongest in the separated regions around
the visible matter. This provides support to the idea that most of the mass of the galaxies
is made up of collisionless dark matter.
If dark matter interacts through the weak force, then it could be observed at the LHC. Dark
matter may not interact weakly. Perhaps it interacts only gravitationally. Additionally it
may not show up at the TeV scale. However, SUSY (which is one of the popular theories
of physics beyond the SM) predicts a set of supersymmetric particles the lightest of which
could be a dark matter candidate. Direct searches from CDMS [49] put an upper limit of
 1 pb on the cross-section of weakly interacting massive particles over the energy range
10 GeV to 1 TeV.
2.5 Supersymmetry
Supersymmetry (SUSY) proposes that for every particle there is a supersymmetric partner
which is a boson for fermions and a fermion for bosons [16]. If unbroken, such a symmetry
ensures cancellation of the divergence in the Higgs boson mass. The operator Q which
generates the supersymmetric transformations can be written as Equation 2.39. Since the
particles within the supermultiplets must maintain the gauge symmetries of the SM, Q
must commute with the internal symmetries of the SM.
Q|Boson >= |Fermion > Q|Fermion >= |Boson > (2.39)
Each lepton SU(2) doublet (l, l)L has two superpartners, both spin-0: a sneutrino lL
and a slepton lL. Each singlet lR has a spin-0 superpartner lR.
In an analagous way, each quark doublet (q, q)L has squark partners qL, q
L and each
singlet qR has a partner qR.
The two spin-1/2 higgsino doublets (H+u , H
u), (H
d , H
d ), have as partners two spin-0
Higgs doublets (H+u , H
u) and (H
d , H
The spin-1 gauge bosons (before electroweak symmetry breaking) g, W, W 0, B0 have
spin-1/2 partners the gluino, wino and bino (g, W, W 0, B0).
After electroweak symmetry breaking, three of the eight degrees of freedom of the two
complex Higgs doublets become longitudinal modes of the Z0 and W bosons. Five Higgs
scalars remain: h0, H0, A0, H. The parameter tan is the ratio of the vacuum expec-
tation values of the neutral Higgs fields.
A straightforward implementation of supersymmetry would predict a whole new set of
particles with the same mass and same interactions as the SM particles. Since we do not
observe these particles SUSY, if it exists, must be broken. The superpartners can then be
at a higher mass scale. There are various different schemes for SUSY breaking [50]. Here
only Gauge Mediated SUSY Breaking (GMSB) is considered [51].
Another symmetry R-parity (RP ) is often introduced to SUSY models. RP is defined in
Equation 2.40 where B is the baryon number, L is the lepton number and S is the spin.
RP is +1 for SM particles and -1 for supersymmetric partners.
RP = (1)3(BL)+2S (2.40)
If R-parity is conserved, there are two important consequences:
 At colliders supersymmetric partners can only be produced in pairs.
 The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable.
The first point ensures that a supersymmetric particle always decays into another super-
symmetric particle and that there are always two decay chains of supersymmetric particles
in each supersymmetric event. The second point means that SUSY events contain miss-
ing energy since the LSP is not detected. The LSP also provides a possible dark matter
candidate.
2.6 Gauge Mediated SUSY Breaking (GMSB)
Under GMSB the messenger particles between the visible sector (SM and SUSY parti-
cles) and the hidden sector (responsible for the SUSY breaking) are gauge particles. In
the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) there are 6 parameters describing
GMSB:
   the SUSY beaking scale.
 Mm  the mass scale of the messengers.
 N5  the number of messengers.
 tan  the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values.
 sign()  the sign of the higgsino mass term.
 Cgrav  the scale factor of the gravitino coupling.
SUSY events contain real missing transverse energy (/ET ) from the Lightest Supersymmet-
ric Particle (LSP). The LSP is the gravitino (G) and the Next Lightest Supersymmetric
Particle (NLSP) is the lightest neutralino (01). The neutralino decays into a photon and
a gravitino 01  G. The events contain two photons coming from separate decay chains.
At lower centre-of-mass energies, for example at LEP (200 GeV) and at the Tevatron
(1.96 TeV), the dominant production mechanism is electroweak production through a W
or a Z since GMSB involves the production of high mass particles (e.g. squark and gluino)
which cannot be produced at low centre of mass energy. The signature for electroweak
production GMSB is + /ET . ALEPH [52] at LEP (e
+e collider) and D0 [53] and CDF
[54] at the Tevatron (pp collider) have published limits on electroweak production GMSB.
At the LHC energy (7 TeV) the cross section is higher and strong production is dominant
since it is possible to produce high mass squarks and gluinos. Figure 2.8 shows an example
of a strong production SUSY decay chain. Strong production events must contain at least
two jets from the two squarks/gluions. Squarks decay to a quark and the next particle
in the SUSY mass hierarchy (q  qX) resulting in one jet. Gluinos decay to a quark
anti-quark pair and the next particle in the SUSY mass hierarchy (g  qqX) resulting in
two jets. The only previous limits on strong production GMSB come from ATLAS [55]
and CMS [12] at the LHC.

CMS Detector and Reconstruction
3.1 Introduction
The LHC is a 27 km circular particle accelerator which lies across the French-Swiss border
about 100 m underground. It was designed to accelerate and collide beams of protons or
heavy ions. The design centre of mass energy (
s) for proton-proton collisions is 14 TeV.
The design luminosity is 1034 cm2s1. The LHC is the highest energy particle accelerator
ever built.
Figure 3.1 shows a diagram of the LHC accelerator complex. Protons are extracted from
a cylinder of hydrogen gas and accelerated first by a linear accelerator which injects them
into the Proton Synchrotron (PS), which accelerates them to 25 GeV and feeds the Super
Proton Synchrotron (SPS). The SPS accelerates the beams to 450 GeV and subsequently
injects them into the LHC.
The CMS detector is one of two general purpose LHC experiments. It was designed
to explore O(TeV) energy proton-proton collisions for indications of physics beyond the
Standard Model. The CMS detector is 21.6 m long and 14.6 m in diameter and has a total
weight of 13 500 tonnes. It is located at Point 5 on the LHC ring near Cessy in France.
Figure 3.2 shows the layout of the CMS detector.
In the following sections each component of the CMS detector is described starting from
the innermost (closest to the interaction point) and going to the outermost. The CMS

Figure 2.1: The LHC accelerator complex.
Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) accelerates the beams to 450 GeV and subsequently
injects them into the LHC ring (see Fig. 2.1).
The protons in the LHC beam are in cylindrical bunches with a nominal interaction
diameter of 16 m and a length of 8 cm. The nominal bunch separation is 25 ns. The
maximum number of possible bunches in the LHC orbit is 3564, however, only 2808
are intended to be used, leaving gaps that are used for dumping the beam and machine
synchronisation. LHC is intended to reach an instantaneous luminosity is 1034 cm2s1.
The LHC was fully commissioned and started operation in September 2008, however,
several days after the first beam circulation, the machine had to stop due to technical
problems [42]. The accelerator started again in November 2009 running initially at
450 GeV per beam and later (December 2009) at 1.18 TeV per beam. In March 2010
the beam energy was raised to 3.5 TeV and the instantaneous luminosity to about
1027 cm2s1. Since then the instantaneous luminosity has been steadily increased: in
summer 2010 it was about 1030 cm2s1 and by October it reached 1032 cm2s1. The
total luminosity delivered during the LHC proton run in 2010 as a function of time is
shown in Fig. 2.2. The current plan is that the LHC will continue running at 3.5 TeV

trigger and the computing model are also described.
3.2 Pixel Detector
The pixel detector consists of 3 barrel layers with 2 endcap disks on each side (Figure
3.3). The barrel layers are at mean radii of 4.4 cm, 7.3 cm and 10.2 cm and have a length
of 53 cm. The endcap disks are placed either side at |z| = 34.5 cm and 46.5 cm.
The purpose of the pixel detector is to give good primary vertex resolution and to initiate
track reconstruction. The pixel size is 100150m. The spatial resolution is about 10m
for the (r,) measurement and about 20m for the z measurement.
The primary vertex is found by clustering selected tracks in z. A fit is performed based on
a weight assigned to each track which is between 0 and 1 depending on the compatibility
with the vertex [5].

superconducting technology for the magnets. The design configuration chosen by CMS [1]
is discussed below.
The overall layout of CMS is shown in Figure 1.2. At the heart of CMS sits a 13-m-long, 5.9 m
inner diameter, 4 T superconducting solenoid. In order to achieve good momentum resolu-
tion within a compact spectrometer without making stringent demands on muon-chamber
resolution and alignment, a high magnetic field was chosen. The return field is large enough
to saturate 1.5 m of iron, allowing 4 muon stations to be integrated to ensure robustness
and full geometric coverage. Each muon station consists of several layers of aluminium drift
tubes (DT) in the barrel region and cathode strip chambers (CSCs) in the endcap region,
complemented by resistive plate chambers (RPCs).

The bore of the magnet coil is also large enough to accommodate the inner tracker and the
calorimetry inside. The tracking volume is given by a cylinder of length 5.8 m and diameter
2.6 m. In order to deal with high track multiplicities, CMS employs 10 layers of silicon mi-
crostrip detectors, which provide the required granularity and precision. In addition, 3 layers
of silicon pixel detectors are placed close to the interaction region to improve the measure-
ment of the impact parameter of charged-particle tracks, as well as the position of secondary
vertices. The EM calorimeter (ECAL) uses lead tungstate (PbWO4) crystals with coverage
in pseudorapidity up to || < 3.0. The scintillation light is detected by silicon avalanche
photodiodes (APDs) in the barrel region and vacuum phototriodes (VPTs) in the endcap re-
gion. A preshower system is installed in front of the endcap ECAL for "0 rejection. The
ECAL is surrounded by a brass/scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter with coverage up
to || < 3.0. The scintillation light is converted by wavelength-shifting (WLS) fibres em-
bedded in the scintillator tiles and channeled to photodetectors via clear fibres. This light

The spatial resolution is measured to be about 10 m for the r- measurement and about
20 m for the z measurement. The detector is readout using approximately 16 000 readout
chips, which are bump-bonded to the detector modules.
1.5.5.3 Tracker control and readout scheme
The Silicon Strip Tracker (SST) readout system is based on a front-end APV25 readout chip
[21], analogue optical links [22] and an off-detector Front-End Driver (FED) processing board
[23]. The APV25 chip samples, amplifies, buffers and processes signals from 128 channels of
a silicon strip sensor. Each microstrip is readout by a charge sensitive amplifier with " =
50 ns. The output voltage is sampled at the beam crossing rate of 40 MHz. Samples are
stored in an analogue pipeline for up to the Level-1 latency of 3.2 s. Following a trigger,
a weighted sum of 3 samples is formed in an analogue circuit. This confines the signal to a
single bunch crossing and gives the pulse height. The buffered pulse height data from pairs
of APV25 chips are multiplexed onto a single line and the analogue data are converted to
optical signals before being transmitted via optical fibres to the off-detector FED boards. The
output of the transmitting laser is modulated by the pulse height for each strip. The FEDs
digitize, process and format the pulse height data from up to 96 pairs of APV25 chips, before
forwarding zero-suppressed data to the DAQ online farm. The electronics noise/channel of
the tracking system is about 1000 to 1500 electrons before and after irradiation, respectively.
The SST control system comprises 300 control rings that start and end at the off-detector
Front-End Controller (FEC) boards [24]. Slow-control commands, clock and Level-1 triggers
are distributed via digital optical links to Digital Opto-Hybrids (DOH) [25], which perform
optical-to-electrical conversion before the control signals are distributed to the front-end elec-
tronics.
The Pixel Tracker readout system is described in detail in [6]. A single pixel barrel module
is readout by 16 Read-Out Chips (ROCs). In the endcaps, the number of ROCs per module
varies from 2 to 10. Each ROC reads an array of 52"80 pixels. Analogue signals and corre-
sponding pixel addresses are stored in a data buffer, waiting for the Level-1 trigger decision.

The primary vertex resolution depends strongly on the number of tracks in the fit. Figure
3.4 shows the primary vertex resolution as a function of the number of tracks for various
average track pT ranges.
3.3 Silicon Strip Tracker
The silicon strip tracker is designed to measure the trajectory of charged particles. It is
made from strips of silicon which charged particles ionise. The technology is the pn junc-
tion with a reverse bias voltage applied that creates a depletion region. Charged particles
ionise the silicon in the depleted region creating electron hole pairs which travel to the

electrodes giving rise to a signal.
The transverse momentum of a particle is measured from the curvature of the track in
the magnetic field by Equation 3.1, where pT is the transverse momentum in GeV, B is
the magnetic field in Tesla and r is the radius of curvature in metres. Only the hits are
measured directly. The length of the sagitta, shown in Figure 3.5, is deduced and the
transverse momentum is calculated from this. Since s is inversely proportional to pT , the
resolution is worse at higher pT .
pT = 0.3Br (3.1)
The silicon strip tracker is sub-divided into four structural units. Figure 3.6 shows the
layout of the tracker. The resolution of the tracker is shown for muons of pT = 1, 10 and
100 GeV in Figure 3.7.

(3.0 < || < 5.0). The jets are reconstructed with the iterative cone R = 0.5 algorithm. See
Section 11.4 for further details.
The layout of the CMS tracker is shown in Figure 1.9. The outer radius of the CMS tracker
extends to nearly 110 cm, and its total length is approximately 540 cm.
Close to the interaction vertex, in the barrel region, are 3 layers of hybrid pixel detectors at
a radii of 4.4, 7.3, and 10.2 cm. The size of the pixels is 100150 m2. In the barrel part, the
silicon microstrip detectors are placed at r between 20 and 110 cm. The forward region has
2 pixel and 9 microstrip layers in each of the 2 Endcaps. The barrel part is separated into an
Inner and an Outer Barrel. In order to avoid excessively shallow track crossing angles, the
Inner Barrel is shorter than the Outer Barrel, and there are an additional 3 Inner Disks in the
transition region between the barrel and endcap parts, on each side of the Inner Barrel. The
total area of the pixel detector is " 1 m2, whilst that of the silicon strip detectors is 200 m2,
providing coverage up to || < 2.4. The inner tracker comprises 66 million pixels and 9.6
million silicon strips [20].
Figure 1.9: The tracker layout (1/4 of the z view).
Figure 3.6: The layout of the silicon strip tracker. Reproduced from [4].
The ECAL has 3 components: the ECAL barrel (EB), the ECAL endcap (EE) and the
ECAL pre-shower (ES). The EB covers the range || < 1.479. The EB radius is 1.29m
and the total length in the z-direction is 6m. The EE consists of two identical detectors
on either side of the EB covering the region 1.479 < || < 3. The ES is positioned in front
of the EE to improve the /0 discrimination which is important for H   searches.
Figure 3.8 shows a diagram of the layout of the ECAL.
An electromagnetic shower progresses through two processes bremsstrahlung, where an
electron or positron emits a photon, and pair production, where a photon converts to an
electron and a positron. Figure 3.9 shows how an electromagnetic shower progresses. The
shower continues until the electrons/photons reach a critical energy, Ec, where energy loss
dominates over the production of new shower particles.
Sampling calorimeters have layers of heavy material to initiate the shower and active de-
tector to sample the shower. In homogeneous calorimeters the heavy material and the
active detector are one and the same. Materials used for electromagnetic calorimeters
have two characteristic lengths which describe the shape of EM showers. Radiation length
is the length over which an electrons energy is reduced to 1/e of its initial energy. Moliere
radius describes the lateral size of the shower; it is the radius which contains 90% of the
energy of the shower.
The Compact Muon Solenoid 51
algorithms will align the inner tracker to a precision such that there will be no eect on
performance significant compared to its intrinsic resolution.

2.2.3 Electromagnetic Calorimeter
The electromagnetic calorimeter absorbs and measures the energy of electrons and pho-
tons. It is a homogeneous calorimeter comprising 75 848 lead tungstate (PbWO4) crys-
tals equipped with fast, radiation hard readout electronics. The ECAL is divided into
a central barrel (EB) and two endcap (EE) subdetectors (Figure 2.9). A preshower
detector is located in front of each endcap.
The ECAL barrel is constructed in two cylindrical halves (EB+ and EB-), joining
at z = 0. Each comprises 18 supermodules which contain 1700 crystals arranged in an
 " geometry : 20 crystals in " by 85 in . The supermodules each cover 20 in " and
extends from 0 " || " 1.479. Each is split into 4 modules : module 1 is 20 crystals in
" by 25 in , covering || < 0.435; the other modules are 20 crystals in " by 20 in .
The nominal distance between supermodules is 6mm ; between modules is 0.5 mm and
0.35mm between crystals within modules. The crystal axes are quasi-projective : they

Electromagnetic Calorimeter
4.1 Description of the ECAL
In this section, the layout, the crystals and the photodetectors of the Electromagnetic Calor-
imeter (ECAL) are described. The section ends with a description of the preshower detector
which sits in front of the endcap crystals. Two important changes have occurred to the ge-
ometry and configuration since the ECAL TDR [5]. In the endcap the basic mechanical unit,
the supercrystal, which was originally envisaged to hold 66 crystals, is now a 55 unit.
The lateral dimensions of the endcap crystals have been increased such that the supercrystal
remains little changed in size. This choice took advantage of the crystal producers abil-
ity to produce larger crystals, to reduce the channel count. Secondly, the option of a barrel
preshower detector, envisaged for high-luminosity running only, has been dropped. This
simplification allows more space to the tracker, but requires that the longitudinal vertices of
H "  events be found with the reconstructed charged particle tracks in the event.
4.1.1 The ECAL layout and geometry
The nominal geometry of the ECAL (the engineering specification) is simulated in detail in
the GEANT4/OSCAR model. There are 36 identical supermodules, 18 in each half barrel, each
covering 20 in ". The barrel is closed at each end by an endcap. In front of most of the
fiducial region of each endcap is a preshower device. Figure 4.1 shows a transverse section
through ECAL.

Figure 3.9: An illustration of the development of an EM shower.
The EB and EE are homogeneous calorimeters made of lead tungstate (PbWO4) crystals.
This material was chosen because of its short radiation length (X0 = 0.89 cm) and short
Moliere radius (rm = 2.2 cm). The crystals have a low light yield, but can withstand high
levels of radiation. The scintillation light is blue/green with a maximum at 420 430 nm.
The light is detected by Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) in the EB and Vacuum Phototri-
odes (VPTs) in the EE. The choice of photodetectors was based on the requirement of
adequate electronic gain given the low light yield of the crystals, operation in the magnetic
field and the ability to tolerate the high radiation environment particularly in the end-cap
regions.
In the EB the length of the crystals is 23 cm (26 X0) and the cross-section is 0.01740.0174
in - or about 22 mm22 mm at the front face. Figure 3.8 shows the layout of crystals in
the EB. The crystals are angled at 3o with respect to the interaction point to minimise the
risk of particles escaping down the cracks between the crystals. The crystals are tapered
with the front face smaller than the rear face. This has the advantage of tighter packing
with fewer gaps and it focusses the scintillation light. Because the crystal is wider at the
back than the front total internal reflection leads light rays to have a smaller with respect
to the long axis of the crystal with each reflection. The ECAL is divided into regions
called trigger towers (TTs) for which trigger primitives (crystal energy sums) used by the
trigger are calculated. There are 85  72 TTs in the EB each consisting of 5x5 arrays of
crystals.
In the EE the length of the crystals is 22 cm (25X0). Due to the geometry of the detector
the granularity in - varies across the EE.
The ES is a sampling device with two layers of active silicon sensors placed in front of
the end-caps. Its purpose is to distinguish between isolated photons and 0s which are a
major background to the H   search. It is made of lead and silicon strip sensors and
has a depth of 20 cm (3X0).
The energy resolution, , has been parameterised as a function of energy in Equation 3.2.
+ C (3.2)
The parameters S, N and C represent the stochastic term, the noise term and the constant
term respectively.
The stochastic term, S, is related to the uncertainty in the number of photons detected.
The number of photons for a given energy electromagnetic shower follows a Poisson distri-
bution. So if n photons are detected, the uncertainty is
n. And the energy is proportional
to the number of photons, hence the
E dependence of this term. About 1000 shower
particles are generated per GeV of the electron or photon.
The noise term, N , comes from electronics noise in the photodetectors and pile-up. It is
independent of energy. The noise from the VPTs in the end-cap is significantly higher
than for the APDs in the barrel. The noise is about 100 MeV as measured using the test
beam.
The constant term, C, contains those uncertainties which are proportional to energy. The
dominant contributors are inter-calibration uncertainties and non-uniformity of the light
collection.
Figure 3.10 shows the energy resolution of the ECAL as a function of beam energy mea-
sured using the test beam which consisted of electrons with energy 10 100 GeV [6].
3.5 Hadronic Calorimeter
The Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL) measures the energy of hadronic showers and assists
in the triggering and measurement of jets and missing transverse energy.
The HCAL is a sampling calorimeter with brass absorbers and plastic scintillator tiles in
the central and endcap regions and steel absorbers with quartz fibre scintillators in the
forward region. Brass has a short interaction length (12 cm) providing adequate contain-
ment within the limited space inside the magnet. Steel is used in the forward region. The
scintillation light is detected by multi-channel hybrid photodiodes (HPDs) in the central
56 The Compact Muon Solenoid
Figure 2.15: Resolution vs Energy of the CMS ECAL measured in beam tests. Energy
reconstruction was performed using 25 3 3 arrays, as described in Chapter 3.
The ECAL Preshower
The preshower detector (ES) is a sampling calorimeter, consisting of two layers of lead
absorber each followed by a layer of silicon strip sensors. The first absorber layer is 2X0
thick and is followed by strips oriented along y. The second absorber layer is 1X0 thick
and is followed by strips oriented along x. The strips have a pitch of 1.9 mm.
The preshower provides excellent granularity in the region 1.653 " || " 2.6, provid-
ing for precise position and shower shape measurements that assist in the rejection of
"0s which are a background for photons.
The presence of the ES in front of the EE impairs the energy resolution. This can
be approximated as an additional 5%/
E sampling contribution convoluted into the
stochastic term in the resolution.
2.2.4 Hadronic Calorimeter
The hadronic calorimeter measures the energy of hadrons. The hadronic shower, illus-
trated in Figure 2.16 is similar to the electromagnetic, but is governed by the strong
force. Energy is lost by the incident hadron in inelastic collisions with the atomic nuclei

measured using the test beam. The parameterisation of the resolution has been fitted and
values extracted for the parameters. Reproduced from [6].
region and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) in the forward region.
The HCAL covers the range || < 5 and consists of four subdetectors: the Hadron Bar-
rel (HB), the Hadron Outer (HO), the Hadron Endcap (HE) and the Hadron Forward
(HF). The HB covers the region || < 1.4 and contains towers with a granularity of
 = 0.087 0.087. The HB is constrained radially to be between the ECAL outer
surface (at r = 1.77m) and the inner surface of the solenoid (at r = 2.95m). This con-
strains the amount of material that can be put in to absorb the hadronic showers. For this
reason the HO lies outside the HB and the magnet in the region || < 1.26 and contains
extra scintillators to catch energy leakage from high energy jets. The HE covers the range
1.3 < || < 3.0 with a granularity that varies with  from    = 0.087  0.087 at
 = 1.3 to  = 0.3500.174 at  = 3.0. The region 3 < || < 5 is covered by the HF.
Figure 3.11 shows a diagram of the development of a hadronic shower.
The jet energy resolution and the missing transverse energy resolution are the key in-
dicators of the performance of the HCAL. Figure 3.12 shows the jet transverse energy
The Compact Muon Solenoid 57
of the calorimeter. A significant fraction of this energy goes into creating 0 and " mesons
which decay into photons, giving an electromagnetic component of the shower. This is
complemented by photons from highly excited nuclei. The hadronic component results
from both the creation of charged hadrons and the breakup of nuclei. The response to
these two components is dierent : the CMS HCAL is non-compensating.
Hadronic showers penetrate more deeply than electromagnetic cascades and are more
extensive laterally, although they are also characterised by a core of high energy par-
ticles surrounded by a cone with a softer energy spectrum. Interaction length, #, is the
hadronic shower analogue to radiation length.
Figure 2.16: Illustration of the development of a hadronic shower, showing the electromag-
netic component descending from a 0; and the hadronic component consisting
of charged hadrons and nuclear spallation products.
Only the energy from the ionisation caused by charged particles is detectable. The
invisible energy is that of recoiling nuclei and neutrons which gradually thermalise.
Hadronic cascades typically have many fewer secondary particles than electromagnetic,
leading to larger statistical fluctuations. Furthermore, the CMS HCAL is a sampling
calorimeter. These factors lead to a much larger stochastic term in the energy resolution
of the HCAL than in the resolution of the ECAL.
The CMS HCAL (Figure 2.17) uses brass absorber-plastic scintillator layers. The
scintillators are connected by wavelength shifting fibres to hybrid photodiodes for read-
out. In the barrel, HB, the calorimeter is segmented into 0.087 0.087 ""$ towers. HB
is supplemented by HO outside the solenoid, which increases the depth of the calorimeter

resolution and the missing transverse energy resolution [7, 8]. The jet resolution for jets
with pT > 40 GeV is better than 10 % and the /ET resolution is between 5 % and 10 %.
3.6 Superconducting Solenoid Magnet
The superconducting solenoid generates a uniform 3.8T magnetic field in the tracking
volume. The magnetic field is important for determining the charge of particles and for
the momentum measurement of charged particles, particularly low momentum charged
particles and muons. The solenoid is 12.5m in length and 6m in diameter. The flux is
returned through an iron yoke to provide a magnetic field which bends muons in the op-
posite direction. The iron is in layers between the muon chambers.
The precision of the momentum measurements in the inner tracker relies on a homogeneous
magnetic field. Within the tracker the magnetic field is homogeneous to within 5% [56]
and has been mapped with a precision better than 0.1% [57].

5.2 Jet pT resolutions from dijet asymmetry method
The asymmetry method described in this section allows jet pT resolution measurement directly
from collision data. The method exploits momentum conservation in the transverse plane of
dijet system and is based (almost) exclusively on the measured kinematics of the dijet events. It
was first developed at the D experiment at the Tevatron [19] and recently established at CMS
for calorimeter jets based on simulation studies [20].
To collect the dijet sample, we use Minimum Bias and dijet pT average triggers (with 15 GeV
and 30 GeV thresholds), the latter being the same triggers as the ones used in the relative
jet response measurement (Section 4.2.2). Integrated luminosity for the unprescaled dijet pT
average trigger with 30 GeV threshold corresponds to Lint = 73 nb1.
At offline, events are required to contain at least two jets within |"| <1.4, with the leading jet
pair being azimuthally separated by # > 2.7. Any additional third jet in event is required to
have low uncorrected transverse momentum pjet3T <p
T,max. We define asymmetry variable
typeIIET/ resolution to the calibrated typeIET/ resolution. For pfET/ , the resolution is on average199
about 45% of the typeI resolution. For tcET/ , the resolution is on average about 55% of the typeI200
resolution. For typeIIET/ , the resolution is on average about 85% of the typeI resolution.201
In order to compare the calibrated ET/ resolution of all the different types of caloET/ , we also202
investigated the raw caloET/ . Figure 13 shows the calibrated ET/ resolution of raw caloET/ , typeI203
caloET/ , and typeII caloET/ . The resolution of the raw caloET/ is very similar to the resolution204
of typeII caloET/ and both raw caloET/ and typeII caloET/ show improvement in resolution com-205

5 Monte-Carlo generator dependence of ET calibration207
The calibration of the ET will be a function of the pT spectrum of the generator-level particles208
and thus depend on the generator used. To try to understand the dependence of the gener-209
ator used, we investigated two different MC minimum bias tunes in addition to the baseline210
pythia8 sample. The two tunes used were TuneP0 and TuneD6T. Fig. 14 shows the calibrated211
ET/ resolution versus calibrated ET for the three different pythia samples and the four differ-212
ent ET/ algorithms. For each different pythia sample the calibration of the ET was recalculated213
using fits similar to those shown in Fig. 7. The ET/ rescaling was not changed for different214
pythia samples. From Fig. 14 we see that the general picture of calibrated ET/ resolution versus215
calibrated ET for the different algorithms does not change much as you vary the generator.216

3.7 Muon System
The purpose of the muon system is identify muons and produce a muon trigger. It also
provides a momentum measurement of the muons.
The muon system has a barrel region in the pseudorapidity range  < 1.2 and two endcaps
with 1.2 <  < 2.4. Standard drift tube chambers are used in the barrel and cathode strip
chambers in the endcaps. The muon ionises the gas as it passes through the chamber.
The resolution worsens with the pT of the muon since the straighter the track the more
difficult it is to accurately determine the curvature. The resolution is worse in the endcaps
where the fake rate is higher and the magnetic field is less uniform. Figure 3.13 shows the
muon pT resolution as a function of muon pT .
3.8 Trigger
With a soft QCD cross-section of  1 mb and a luminosity of 1033 cm1s1 (1 nb1s1)
the event rate is  1 MHz. However, most of these are uninteresting soft QCD events.
Interesting events such as W/Z production, Higgs production or SUSY events have much
smaller cross-sections. Figure 3.14 shows the cross-sections of various processes. Also

4   Physics selection strategy 33
4 Physics selection strategy
This chapter provides an overview of the strategy for the online selection of events in ATLAS.
The challenge faced at the LHC is to reduce the interaction rate of about 1 GHz at the design lu-
minosity of 1  1034 cm"2 s"1 online by about seven orders of magnitude to an event rate of
O(100 Hz) going to mass storage. Although the emphasis in this document will be on the contri-
bution of the HLT to the reduction in rate, the final overall optimization of the selection proce-
dure also includes LVL1.
The first section describes the requirements defined by the physics programme of ATLAS. This
is followed by a discussion of the approach taken for the selection at LVL1 and HLT. Next, a
brief overview of the major selection signatures and their relation to the various detector com-
ponents of ATLAS is given. Then, an overview of the various parts of the trigger menu for run-
ning at an initial luminosity of 2  1033 cm"2 s"1 is presented, together with a discussion of the
expected physics coverage. The discussion in this chapter concentrates on the initial luminosity
regime; the selection strategy for the design luminosity phase will crucially depend on the ob-
servations and measurements during the first years of data taking. This is followed by a de-
scription of how changes in the running conditions are going to be addressed, and finally ideas
for the strategy of determining trigger efficiencies from the data alone are presented.
Details on the implementation of the event-selection strategy, in terms of the software frame-
work to perform the selection, can be found in Section 9.5. More information on selection-algo-
rithm implementations and their performance in terms of signal efficiency and background
rejection are given in Chapter 13. Finally, Chapter 14 addresses the issue of system performance
of the online selection, presenting our current understanding of the resources (e.g. CPU time,
network bandwidth) needed to implement the selection strategy presented in this chapter.
4.1 Requirements
The ATLAS experiment has been designed to cover the physics in protonproton collisions with
a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV at LHC. Amongst the primary goals are the understanding of
the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking, which might manifest itself in the observation of
one or more Higgs bosons, and the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. For the
latter it will be of utmost importance to retain sensitivity to new processes which may not have
been modelled. The observation of new heavy objects with masses of O(1) TeV will involve very
high-pT signatures and should not pose any problem for the online selection. The challenge is
the efficient and unbiased selection of lighter objects with masses of O(100) GeV. In addition,
precision measurements of processes within and beyond the Standard Model are to be made.
These precision measurements will also provide important consistency tests for signals of new
physics. An overview of the variety of physics processes and the expected performance of
ATLAS can be found in [4-1]. Most of the selection criteria used in the assessment of the physics
potential of ATLAS are based on the selection of at most a few high-pT objects, such as charged
leptons, photons, jets (with or without b-tagging), or other high-pT criteria such as missing and
total transverse energy. Furthermore, ATLAS expects to take data during the heavy-ion running
of the LHC.
The online event-selection strategy has to define the proper criteria to cover efficiently the phys-
ics programme foreseen for ATLAS, while at the same time providing the required reduction in
event rate at the HLT. Guidance on the choice of online selection criteria has been obtained from
ATLAS Technical Design Report

34 4   Physics selection strategy
the variety of analyses assessing the ATLAS physics potential, aiming for further simplification
to a very few, mostly inclusive, criteria.
Event selection at LHC faces a huge range in
cross-section values for various processes, as
shown in Figure 4-1. The interaction rate is
dominated by the inelastic part of the total
cross-section with a cross-section of about
70 mb. The inclusive production of b-quarks
occurs with a cross-section of about 0.6 mb,
corresponding to a rate of about 6 MHz for de-
sign luminosity. It is worth noting that the
cross-section for inclusive W production, in-
cluding the branching ratio for the leptonic
decays to an electron or a muon, leads to a rate
of about 300 Hz at design luminosity. The rate
of some rare signals will be much smaller, e.g.
the rate for the production of a Standard Mod-
el Higgs boson with a mass of 120 GeV for the
rare-decay mode into two photons will be be-
low 0.001 Hz. The selection strategy has to en-
sure that such rare signals will not be missed,
while at the same time reducing the output
rate of the HLT to mass storage to an accepta-
ble value.
The online selection thus has to provide a very
efficient and unbiased selection, maintaining
the physics reach of the ATLAS detector. It should be extremely flexible in order to operate in
the challenging environment of the LHC, with up to about 23 inelastic events per bunch cross-
ing at design luminosity. Furthermore, it has also to provide a very robust, and, where possible,
redundant selection. It is highly desirable to reject fake events or background processes as early
as possible in order to optimize the usage of the available resources. Presently the selection is
based on rather simple criteria, while at the same time making use of the ATLAS capabilities to
reject most of the fake signatures for a given selection. It is, however, mandatory to have addi-
tional tools such as exclusive criteria or more elaborate object definitions available for the online
selection.
4.2 Selection criteria
In order to guarantee optimal acceptance to new physics within the current paradigm of parti-
cle physics, we have taken an approach based on emphazising the use of inclusive criteria for
the online selection, i.e. having signatures mostly based on single- and di-object high-pT trig-
gers. Here high-pT refers to objects such as charged leptons with transverse momenta above
O(10 GeV). The choice of the thresholds has to be made in such a way that a good overlap with
the reach of the Tevatron and other colliders is guaranteed, and there is good sensitivity to new
light objects, e.g. Higgs bosons. Enlarging this high-pT selection to complement the ATLAS
physics potential requires access to signatures involving more exclusive selections, such as re-
quiring the presence of several different physics objects or the use of topological criteria. A fur-

in the underground control room located at a distance of 90 m from the experimental
cavern. The Level-1 trigger uses coarse local data from the calorimeter and muon
systems to make electron/photon, jet, energy sum and muon triggers. The Level-1
trigger was generally operated at about 30 kHz in 2010.
The Level-1 calorimeter trigger is based on trigger towers of size 0.0870.087 in -
" space in the central region and somewhat larger for || > 2. The electromagnetic
trigger works with fully overlapping windows of 33 trigger towers applying thresh-
old to the sum of two adjacent ECAL towers and possibly further cuts on isolation,
hadronic/electromagnetic fraction and/or the lateral shape in the ECAL. The jet trig-
ger is based on 33 windows of 44 trigger tower arrays. Three types of jet triggers
are defined - central, tau-jet, and forward - depending on the location and the shape of
the object. The top four candidates in each class of calorimeter trigger are used for the
final Level-1 trigger decision.

there is a technical limit on the rate at which data can be read out. The CMS data
acquisition (DAQ) bandwidth limits the event rate to  100 kHz. Offline reconstruction
and storage facilities further limit the rate to  100 Hz. The goal of the trigger is to select
the interesting events to read out and process.
There are two components to the trigger: Level 1 and Higher Level Trigger (HLT). The
aim of the Level 1 trigger is to reduce the rate to  100 kHz to satisfy the constraint set by
the DAQ bandwidth. It takes trigger primitives such as crystal energy sums calculated
by on-detector hardware which are transferred by optical link from the CMS detector. The
HLT is run on a farm of computers in a room above the CMS detector. It reconstructs
physics objects and makes decisions based on the presence and quality of these to further
reduce the rate to  100 Hz to satisfy the constraint set by the storage and reconstruction
facilities.
3.9 CMS Computing Model
CMS has produced O(100PB) of data and the quantity is growing. No single computer
centre is capable of handling such a large quantity of data. The CMS computing model
involves a network of data centres across the world (Figure 3.15) in a hierarchy of Tiers.
 Tier 0 is the data centre at CERN which is directly connected to the experiment.
It stores the raw data and produces the first reconstruction which is subsequently
transferred to Tier 1 sites.
 Data from Tier 0 is distributed to 8 Tier 1 sites. Each Tier 1 site is responsible for
storing a second copy of the raw and reconstructed data. A lot of reprocessed data
is also stored at the Tier 1 sites.
 Data from the Tier 1 sites is transferred to 38 Tier 2 sites. These data centres store
data for analysis by CMS physicists. Data at the Tier 2 sites is not complete and is
not stored permanently, but is updated according to the requirements of the ongoing
analyses.
3.10 Photon Reconstruction
Photons and electrons make electromagnetic showers in the ECAL. Electromagnetic show-
ers are reconstructed from the energy deposits in the ECAL crystals. The clustering algo-
rithm starts with the energy deposits in single crystals and groups these together starting
with the highest energy crystal. A strip 5 crystals wide in the  direction and with dy-
namic  length is used to contain the energy in the cluster or clusters. To incorporate
bremsstrahlung from electrons and converted photons, the strip can be extended in the 
direction. A description of the superclustering algorithm is given here [58].
Electromagnetic showers have a particular shower shape. Prompt photons can be distin-
guished from fakes by the shower shape. The main backgrounds to prompt photons come

responsible for the safe-keeping of a share of the second copy of the RAW and the
reconstructed data. Large amounts of reprocessed data will also be kept there.
 Data from the Tier-1 will be transferred to 38 Tier-2 centres (see Fig. 2.11).
These centres store the data for analysis by CMS physicists both local to the
associated Tier-2 centre or remote users. Data at Tier-2 centres is not stored
indefinitely, but is expected to be analysed and periodically replaced depending
on the physics, detector or computing requirements.
2.3 The CMS ECAL
2.3.1 Lead Tungstate Crystals
Lead tungstate (PbWO4) [60] forms transparent crystals of very high density (8.3 g/cm
It has a small radiation length (0.89 cm) and a small Moliere radius (2.2 cm). These
two properties allow for a compact calorimeter design that satisfies the limited space
restriction inside the solenoid and the requirement for good spatial resolution. Much
development work went into achieving radiation hard crystals [61].

from single and multiple 0s. The 0 decays to two photons which produce an EM shower
in the calorimeter. Shower shape alone does not distiguish single 0 from prompt photons
however it does reject multiple 0s.
Fake photons from QCD jets tend to have plenty of activity in the surrounding detectors.
In contrast, prompt photons tend to be isolated with little surrounding activity. Isolation
is one of the variables used to select photons because of its background rejection power.
There are three independent isolation measures based on the ECAL, the HCAL and the
tracker.
Fake photons from jets also tend to have a hadronic component as well as an electromag-
netic component while prompt photons are purely electromagnetic. Photons are distin-
guished from electrons by the tracker. Electrons, being charged particles, ionise the silicon
and so leave a track while photons do not.
Based on these considerations, there are six variables used for the photon selection:
 ECAL isolation is defined as the sum of the energy deposited in the crystals of
the ECAL in a circle R =
2 + 2 = 0.4 circle around the photon. A

smaller circle of R = 0.1 around the photon is excluded from the isolation sum
to avoid counting the photon itself in the isolation. Also a strip along  of width
 = 0.04 is excluded from the isolation sum. The  width is chosen to avoid
including bremsstrahlung from electrons and photon conversions. Figure 3.16 shows
a plot of the ECAL isolation of photon candidates for a SUSY model and the QCD
background along with the cut value used in this analysis.
 HCAL isolation is defined as the sum of the energy deposited in the HCAL towers
in a R = 0.4 circle around the photon position. A smaller circle of R = 0.1
is excluded from the isolation sum to avoid counting rear-leakage from high energy
photons in the isolation. Figure 3.17 shows a plot of the HCAL isolation of photon
candidates for a SUSY model and the QCD background along with the cut value
used in this analysis.
 Track isolation is defined as the sum of the pT of tracks inside a cone of R = 0.4
around the photon and toward the primary vertex. A smaller cone of R < 0.1 is
excluded from the isolation sum. Figure 3.18 shows a plot of the track isolation of

 H/E is the ratio of the hadronic energy deposited in the HCAL behind the photon
to the photon energy. Jets faking photons are likely to have a significant amount of
hadronic energy while for prompt photons the amount of hadronic energy is likely
to be small. Figure 3.19 shows a plot of the H/E of photon candidates for a SUSY
model and the QCD background along with the cut value used in this analysis.
 Shower Shape (ii). The width of the shower in the  direction is used as a
measure of the shower shape. The  direction rather than the  direction is used
because the magnetic field can cause electromagnetic showers to be spread out in .
 is the r.m.s width of the shower in the  direction. The variable used here is ii,
which calculates the width in terms of number of crystals in the  direction rather
than  itself. This is better because it does not count the gaps between crystals
(where there is no showering) in the width and it is not distorted by the geometry of
the detector in the end-cap region. Figures 3.20 and 3.21 show plots of the shower

 Pixel Seed. A pixel seed is a track stub in the pixel detector that is the first step
in track reconstruction. The photon selection requires that there is no pixel seed
corresponding to the electromagnetic shower.
3.11 Jet Reconstruction
Jets are collimated bunches of hadrons originating from partons (quarks and gluons) after
fragmentation and hadronisation. Jets are reconstructed based on energy deposits in the
detector using the Anti-KT jet algorithm with a cone size of R = 0.5. The Anti-KT jet
algorithm is a clustering, cone algorithm which does not suffer from the problem of infra
red and collinear divergences [59].
Under the Anti-KT algorithm energy deposits are clustered together within a cone ac-

deposits/particles) is defined by Equation 3.3.

ij =

The Anti-KT algorithm is the most widely used within CMS because it has good energy
resolution and good efficiency [60].
3.12 ECAL Spikes
ECAL Spikes are isolated energy deposits in the ECAL which do not come from EM show-
ers. They tend to be single crystal energy deposits in the ECAL which are often not vetoed
by the shower shape variable. The origin of ECAL spikes is energy deposited directly into
the sensitive region of the photodetectors (without showering in the ECAL). ECAL spikes
lead to fake photons and fake /ET . There are two properties which characterise ECAL
spikes: topology and timing. Some spikes occur at the same time as the rest of the event
from pions and other particles in the hadronic shower, while others are out of time with
the rest of the event due to slow neutrons travelling from where they were created (the
hadronic shower) to the photodetector where they interact. A cut of 1  e4/e1 < 0.96 is
made to avoid spikes. 1 - e4/e1 is the Swiss Cross variable in which e1 is the highest
energy crystal in a 3x3 array and e4 is the energy of the four adjacent crystals. The vast
majority of spikes are vetoed by the swiss cross cut. Many of the remaining are double
spikes (where energy is deposited in the photodetectors of two adjacent crystals). These
spikes are vetoed by requiring e2/e9 < 0.96 and |t| < 5 ns, t is the timing of the signal
relative to the bunch crossing time. e2 is the energy of the highest energy crystal plus the
energy of the highest energy adjacent crystal in a 3x3 array. e9 is the total energy of all
the crystals in the 3x3 array. The distribution of spikes remaining after the swiss cross
cut is illustrated by Figure 3.22.

Figure 10 illustrates the tseed distributions in the four regions. We then rescale the estimated
fraction of spikes fspikes to the measured fraction of signal events from the fit. Finally, the
contribution of anomalous events to the measured signal yield is estimated to be less then 0.4%
(0.7%) at low (high) photon pT.
7.5 Estimation of electron background
We estimate the background from isolated electrons by measuring the probability for an iso-
lated electron to satisfy the photon identification criteria described above. This method exploits
Z0 " e+e decays, using the tag and probe technique described in Section 6. The recon-
struction efficiency for the matching pixel hits selection was measured to be 97.92  0.65% and
95.09  2.02% for the ECAL barrel and the ECAL endcaps, respectively. This yields to 2.08  0.65
(4.91  2.02%) probability for the barrel (endcap) region that an electron fakes a photon.
8 Results
Figures 11, 12 show the estimated fraction of prompt photons (i.e. the purity) in the two pseudo-
rapidity regions for the samples defined for the cluster shape and isolation methods, respec-
tively. We define the signal enriched region as i"i" < 0.010(0.030) in the barrel (endcap) region
for the cluster shape method and loose photon selection. For the tight photon selection the sig-
nal region is defined as i"i" < 0.010(0.028). We require Iso < 5 GeV for the isolation method in

Data, Trigger and Event Selection
4.1 Data
The search for GMSB described in this thesis uses 1.1 fb1 of data taken from March to
June 2011. This corresponds to the data set used for the results presented at the Interna-
tional Europhysics Conference in High Energy Physics in July 2011.
The centre of mass energy of the proton-proton collisions is 7 TeV which makes the LHC
the highest energy particle collider to date. A higher centre of mass energy increases the
production cross-section of certain processes, for example stong production SUSY, and
also enables the production of more massive particles. It should be noted that the impor-
tant energy is not the centre of mass energy of the proton collision, but that of the parton
collision which is  1 TeV on average.
The instantaneous luminosity has increased over the data taking period by increasing the
intensity of the beams and the number of bunches. Increasing the intensity of the beams
leads to more interactions per bunch crossing  an effect called pile-up. During the period
when this data was taken the luminosity was  1033 cm2s1.
Figure 4.1 shows the integrated luminosity recorded by CMS over time until September
2011.

CMS during stable beams at
s = 7 TeV.
4.2 HT and Missing Transverse Energy (/ET)
HT is the scalar sum of the pT of all jets with pT > 40 GeV. The HT gives a measure of
the activity in the event.
T (4.1)
Particles such as neutrinos and the LSP in SUSY events are not detected by CMS. Momen-
tum conservation in the proton collision means that the undetected particles show up as
an imbalance of reconstructed particles. /ET is the negative vector sum of the transverse
momenta of all the reconstructed particles. The transverse component is used because
much of the longitudinal momentum goes down the beampipe (i.e. outside the acceptance
of the detector). For high energy photons and jets the most accurate measurement of the
momentum comes from the energy in the calorimeters. The transverse energy, ~ET , of an
energy deposit E is calculated using Equation 4.2. The missing transverse energy /ET is
given by Equation 4.3.
~ET = E sin  cos~x+ E sin  sin~y (4.2)
/ET =
 (4.3)
HT and /ET are the two variables used to search for GMSB in the data. Figures 4.2 and
4.3 show the distribution of HT and /ET in the signal events compared to the background
from MC.
4.3 Monte Carlo Samples
Events of QCD processes, SUSY signal models and Electroweak processes are generated
using Monte Carlo (MC) techniques followed by detector simulation. The simulated data
gives predictions to be compared with obsevations and used to validate analysis methods.
The samples are generated using Pythia 6 [61] and GEANT 4 [62] is used for the detector
simulation.
Pile-up is simulated in the MC samples however the MC does not reproduce the vertex mu-
tiplicity distribution seen in the data. To correctly simulate pile-up the MC is re-weighted

distribution of number of vertices in the data and MC.
Figure 4.5 shows plots of HT and /ET to show how accurately the MC models the data.
The prediction is good for HT , but the /ET distribution is broader in the data than the
MC. This shows that jets with pT > 40 GeV are well described by the MC, but lower
energy jets and unclustered energy are less well modelled.
4.4 Trigger
Based on the properties of strong production GMSB, a photon + HT trigger is ideal for
this search. Table 4.1 shows a list of all the photon + HT triggers in the 2011 data with
the corresponding L1 seed and the rate at 1033 cm2s1. The 70 GeV photon + 350 GeV
HT trigger is used for this search.
As the luminosity has increased more stringent trigger requirements have been necessary

to keep the data rate manageable. If the rate of a trigger becomes too high, the trigger
must be pre-scaled. This means that only every nth event which fires the trigger is read
out where n is the prescale factor.
If there were no offline jet energy corrections, then the trigger HT value would be identical
to the offline HT value and therefore there would be no trigger inefficiency coming from
the HT cut. Due to offline jet energy corrections there is an inefficiency for events close
to the HT boundary. The offline cuts for HT and photon pT are chosen to avoid any
inefficiency of the trigger due to the thresholds.
The efficiency of the trigger is evaluated with respect to a lower threshold trigger to
determine at which HT value the offline cut should be placed for the trigger to be fully
efficient for the event selection. The thresholds are chosen such that all the events with HT
above the offline cut will pass the lower threshold trigger. Some of the events which would
have passed the offline HT cut will not pass the trigger because of the offline jet energy
corrections and some events will pass the trigger despite having an offline HT below the
trigger threshold. The offline HT distribution of events passing both triggers is divided
by the offline HT distribution of events passing the lower threshold trigger. This does not
give an absolute efficiency of the trigger. The resulting efficiency curve shows where to put
the off-line cut in HT such that the ineffeciency due to the HT cut is negligible. Figure
4.6 shows the trigger efficiency against HT and photon pT .

4.5 Photon Selection
Photons are selected based on variables such as isolation and shower shape which are
designed to select prompt photons over fakes from jets. The photon reconstruction is
described in detail in Section 3.10. The cut values on each of the photon selection varaibles
are listed in Table 4.2. These cut values were chosen to have 90 % efficiency for prompt
photons according to MC [63].
4.6 Jet Selection
Two jets with pT > 80 GeV and || < 2.5 are required. The  threshold corresponds to
the tracker boundary. The pT threshold should be chosen as high as possible to reject
background, but with the signal efficiency close to 100%. Figure 4.7 shows the signal
efficiency and the background rejection as a function of the jet pT threshold.

(blue) as a function of the jet pT threshold.
A HT cut is applied because strongly produced SUSY events have high HT since high
mass particles (squarks and gluinos) are produced. The value of this cut is motivated by
the desire for the trigger to be fully efficient for the event selection. Figure 4.6 shows that
the trigger becomes fully efficient in HT at around 400 GeV.
The  2 jets cut is well motivated from the SUSY perspective: strong production SUSY
events start with two squarks/gluinos each of which decay to a quark/gluon (which forms
a jet in the detector) and the next SUSY particle in the mass hierarchy.
In strong production GMSB the Next-to-Lightest SUSY Particle (NLSP) is the neutralino
(0) which decays to a photon and a gravitino. At least two photons are expected in each
event. However, due to the high activity in these events, photons often fall inside the cone
of a jet and so only one photon is reconstructed. Hence the  1 photon cut.
The background estimation is done in bins of /ET and HT , but an initial /ET cut is made to
avoid the low /ET bins where there is no sensitivity due to the huge amount of background.

Table 4.3: The number of events passing the selection in bins of HT and /ET . The bin
used to search for signal is on the bottom right (HT > 700 GeV, /ET > 200 GeV).
An estimate is made for the expected number of background events in each (HT , /ET ) bin.
The background estimation is done using a sample from data and checked using the MC.
A prediction for the number of signal events in the only significant bin (HT > 700 GeV,
/ET > 200 GeV) is made by applying the event selection to the signal MC. The predic-
tion is made for a variety of signal models with different squark mass and gluino mass.
Systematic uncertainties are estimated by varying within their uncertainties the variables
that could affect the signal prediction.
The CLs method is used to exclude the signal at 95 % CL in the squark mass vs gluino
mass parameter space.
Chapter 5
Background Estimation
5.1 Introduction
The Standard Model backgrounds to the search are estimated in 16 bins of (HT , /ET ). The
HT bins are 400500 GeV, 500600 GeV, 600700 GeV and > 700 GeV and the /ET bins
are 50100 GeV, 100150 GeV, 150200 GeV and > 200 GeV. Only the (HT > 700 GeV,
/ET > 200 GeV) bin is significant in terms of setting a limit on the GMSB cross-section.
The other bins are used only to give confidence in the background estimation procedure.
The main background comes from QCD processes. These events have only fake /ET due
to detector imperfections. The size of the QCD background is estimated using a control
sample from the data.
The electroweak background is small in comparison to the QCD background. Electroweak
processes can contribute real /ET through the production of neutrinos that are not detected.
The size of the electroweak background is estimated using MC.
5.2 QCD Background
The largest background comes from QCD processes. There are three different components
to the QCD background:
 Fakes from jets (0  ): 0s are one of the main constituents of jets. The two
photons from a high energy 0 can easily be mistaken for a single photon. Most 0s
will be non-isolated due to the surrounding jet. However there is a distribution of
isolation and given the large cross section of QCD, some of these events will end up
in the isolated tail.
 Prompt +jet: In these events the photon comes directly from the parton hard
scattering. The other jet can come from gluon radiation or jet fragmentation. These
events contain prompt photons which tend to be isolated and have good shower
shape.
 QCD jets with ISR/FSR: A QCD jets event where an initial state quark or final
state quark radiates a photon. These events also contain prompt photons which tend
to be isolated and have good shower shape. The cross section of this process falls
with the pT of the photon.
QCD events are balanced in the transverse plane. All three sources of QCD background
have only fake /ET . Fake /ET can come from the HCAL resolution, severe mismeasurements
such as dead regions, poor HCAL response or from fluctuations inherent in the hadronic
showering process.
In the ECAL there are single crystals and groups of crystals (ECAL trigger towers) which
are non-functioning or partially functioning resulting in dead areas  energy deposited
in these regions is not reconstructed resulting in fake missing transverse energy. Figure
5.1 shows a map of the ECAL barrel with the dead regions marked.
Poor HCAL response is another cause of large fake /ET . Sometimes a jet is reconstructed
with a much lower pT than it actually has. Such mismeasurements are extremely unusual
(at a rate smaller than 1 in 105 events) and not at all well understood. These are not
correlated with any specific region of the detector.
The core resolution is approximately Gaussian in x and y components of /ET while the
severe mismeasurements contribute a non-Gaussian tail to the /ET distribution. Both
components scale with HT . The core resolution scales as 
HT while the tails increase
because higher HT events contain higher pT objects which give larger /ET when missed.

2 ECAL Operation during LHC collisions
2.1 Crystal Calorimeter status and stability
Shortly after installation of the EB and EE, the percentage of working channels was 99.47% and
99.66% respectively, measured during cosmic-ray runs in late 2008 [2]. Some infant mortalities
resulted in a slight decrease in these numbers, which is currently stable at 99.30% and 98.94%.
In addition, a small number of channels, 0.3% in EB and 0.7% in EE, were classified as operable
but problematic (e.g. high levels of electronic noise). These are suppressed in the offline recon-
struction described in section 4.1. Figures 1 and 2 show maps of the EB and EE respectively,
detailing the fully working areas and the few problematic channels. The energy deposited in
channels with readout integrity problems can in principle be recovered by using the associated
trigger primitive data. Only a small fraction of the total number of channels have neither read-
out nor trigger information available (0.1% of EB and 0.7% of EE). These regions are indicated
by the white squares in figures 1 and 2.
Figure 1: Graphical representation of the barrel ECAL (EB) showing the fully working areas
(green) and few problematic channels. The percentage of fully operational channels in the EB
is 99.30%.
2.1.1 Crystal transparency and thermal stability
One of the most challenging aspects of the CMS ECAL is achieving the required 0.5% constant
term of the energy resolution for unconverted photons. Various factors contribute to this term,
including the temperature stability of the crystals/photodetectors and the crystal transparency,
which can decrease with radiation. It is thus crucial to ensure a stable thermal environment
(specification for the EB/EE is a maximum variation of 0.05C and 0.1C respectively) and to
monitor any changes in crystal transparency. To control the temperature an extensive feedback
mechanism based on information from nearly 7000 thermistors is utilized. To monitor the ra-
diation damage both LED and laser light monitoring systems are employed, which constantly
monitor the transparency of the PbWO4 crystals. Although radiation damage is not expected to
be relevant until at least 2011, it is important that the light monitoring system itself is extremely
stable, to better than 0.2% variation. Figure 3 (left) shows the stability of the thermistor mea-
surements during the first two months of the 7 TeV data taking period in 2010, clearly meeting
the specifications. Figure 3 (right) shows the measured ratio over time of the APD signal to
that from a PN diode, when illuminated by the blue laser light of the monitoring system. The

towers in the ECAL barrel, 27 are dead. Reproduced from [10].
Any background estimation method needs to be able to estimate these detector effects.
If the Monte Carlo were to be used we would be relying on its ability to correctly model
all the causes of fake /ET . Not just the core resolution but also the /ET tail with severe
mismeasurements. Using a control sample from data gives a perfect simulation of the CMS
detector. The problem is reduced to finding a control sample with the same kinematic
properties as the selected sample rather than trying to simulate the most extreme elements
of detector response.
A control sample is defined to contain events which pass all the selection criteria except
for the isolation. This control sample is used to estimate the /ET shape of the QCD back-
ground in each HT bin. The absolute number of events is obtained by normalising the /ET
distribution to the number of events with /ET < 50 GeV.
The assumption in this method is that the control sample has the same /ET distribution
as the selected sample in each HT bin. The control sample is very similar to the selected
sample. It has the same objects with the same kinematic cuts. All events contain at least
one photon with good shower shape. The only difference is that in the control sample the
photon is non-isolated while in the selected sample it happens to be isolated. Although
they contain the three sources of QCD background in different proportions, in both cases
the source of /ET is the same: detector effects. So we can expect them to have the same
/ET distributions.
The background estimation is shown to work in Monte Carlo and in data using a side-
band region. Figure 5.2 shows the regions used for the background estimation. The
(non-isolated) control sample is used to estimate the background in the (isolated) selected
sample. The sideband region is used to check that the background estimation works i.e.
the non-isolated and isolated samples have the same /ET distribution.
To assess how well the background estimation technique works, the /ET distribution of
the selected events is compared to the prediction of the /ET distribution using the control
sample. This is done using the MC and the sideband region to give two independent
checks each with different qualities. The check of the background estimation using the
MC shows how well the technique works in principle. It has the advantage that it is
probing a kinematically identical region to the data, but the disadvantage that the MC
does not accurately reproduce the /ET distribution in data. The check of the background
estimation technique using the sideband region in data uses a kinematically similar, but
not idential region. It has the advantage that being from data it reliably reproduces the
detector idiosyncrasies which cause the fake /ET .
Figure 5.3 shows the /ET distribution in the MC for the selected events compared to the
prediction of the /ET distribution using the control sample. The data are split bins of HT :
400  500 GeV, 500  600 GeV, 600  700 GeV and 700 GeV. A straight line is fitted to
the difference plot to give a quantatative measure of the performance of the background
estimation. The important number to compare is the number of events in the search bin
(HT > 700 GeV, /ET > 200 GeV), which is predicted to be 0.17  0.04 using the control
sample in the MC. The true value in the MC is 0.24 0.06.
Figure 5.4 shows the predicted and observed /ET distribution in the sideband region. The
number of events in the search bin for the sideband region is predicted to be 0.09  0.04

Now that background estimation procedure has been shown to work using the MC and

difference between the estimated and observed number of events is plotted and a flat line
is fitted.
The systematic uncertainty on the background estimation comes from the assumption that
the control sample accurately estimates the number of selected events. Due to the small
number of events in the sideband region, the MC alone is used to determine the systematic
uncertainty. The uncertainty is taken to be the magnitude of the difference between the
estimation and the truth in the MC, , added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty
on the knowledge of that value, stat (Equation 5.1).
total =
2 + 
stat (5.1)
The value of  is 29 % and the value of stat is 25 %. Thus the total systematic uncertainty
on the background estimation is 38 %. The estimate of the number of background events
including statistical and systematic uncertainties is 7.7 2.1(stat.) 2.7(syst.).
5.3 Electroweak and tt Backgrounds
The Electroweak background is small in comparison to the QCD background. Electroweak
processes can contribute real /ET through the neutrino which is not detected. The cross
section of electroweak processes is much lower than that of QCD and this rules out any
background due to fakes from jets. There are two possible sources of photons: W  e
where the electron has been misidentied as a photon or W/Z with ISR/FSR.
The W  e background is estimated using the MC and by measuring the electron/photon
misidentification rate in data. The misidentification rate is measured using e and ee
events from data where the electron is selected using the same selection criteria as the
photon (the only difference is that the electron has a track). For each sample a function
is fitted to the invariant mass peak to determine the number of Z  ee events. The
electron/photon misidentification rate is the number of Z events in the e sample com-
pared to the number of Z events in the ee sample. The misidentification rate is found
to be 0.014  0.004 [12]. This agrees well with the value from MC: 0.012  0.002. The
total number of W  e events passing the selection is 0.52  0.10(stat.). The W/Z+
background is estimated to be 0.030 0.030 from the MC. A conservative estimate of the
systematic uncertainty of 100 % is made to cover the jet energy scale, jet energy resolution,
cross-section and luminosity uncertainties.
The tt background also has real /ET , but it is negligible due to the low cross-section. The tt
background is estimated using Monte Carlo to be 0.007 0.007, where again a systematic
uncertainty of 100 % is used as conservative estimate.
Ignoring the W/Z+ and tt backgrounds because they are so small, the total electroweak
background is 0.5 0.5 events.
5.4 Conclusions
The background from QCD processes in the only significant bin (HT > 700 GeV, /ET >
200 GeV) is estimated to be 7.2  2.1(stat.)  2.9(syst.) events. The background from
electroweak processes is estimated to be 0.5 0.5 events.
Chapter 6
Signal Prediction and Systematics
6.1 Introduction
The predicted number of signal events, s, is given by Equation 6.1.
s = L (6.1)
where  is the efficiency  acceptance for the event selection,  is the cross section and L
is the integrated luminosity.
The signal cross section comes from theoretical calculations. A total of 441 different sig-
nal models are considered with different values for squark mass and gluino mass. The
squark mass and gluino mass each take 21 values from 400 GeV to 2000 GeV in intervals
of 80 GeV. The cross section is  0.01 pb in the region close to exclusion depending on
the squark and gluino masses. The largest uncertainty in the signal prediction comes from
the cross section ( 20 %).
The integrated luminosity comes from LHC measurements of the beam. 1.1 fb1 of data
is used in this analysis. The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is about 5 %.
The efficiency  acceptance for the signal is found by applying the selection cuts to the
signal MC. Corrections need to be made relating to the difference between the photon
efficiency in data and MC and to account for pile-up. In addition to these corrections
uncertainties on the signal prediction need to be determined. These include statistical
errors and systematic errors. Since 10,000 events were used for each signal point, the sta-
tistical error is small and so it is the systematic error on which attention must be focussed.
Cuts are made on jets, photons, HT and /ET . The major sources of uncertainty for the jet
and HT cuts are the jet energy scale and jet energy resolution. For the photons the main
sources of uncertainty come from the photon efficiency correction and from pile-up which
affects the photon isolation efficiency. Both the HT and /ET distributions are also affected
by pile-up, but this is a small effect.
The numbers and plots relating to the systematic uncertainties presented in this section
use a signal parameter point close to the exclusion limit with squark mass 1200 GeV and
gluino mass 1200 GeV. The systematic uncertainties are also determined for all the other
parameter points in the same way.
6.2 Photon Efficiency Correction
The photon efficiency needs to be determined to calculate the signal efficiency. The photon
efficiency could be found using the MC, but that relies heavily on the correct modelling of
the shower shape, isolation and other variables which may not be well modelled in the MC.
The photon efficiency is measured from data. In the absence of a suitable pure photon
sample in the data, electrons from Z  ee events are used. This relies on the similarity in
detector response between electrons and photons. A scale factor to correct the MC photon
efficiency to the real photon efficiency in data is obtained using the electrons (Equation
6.2).

 data = photon efficiency in data;
 MC = photon efficiency in MC;

such as ET, ", R#/jet, Njet and NPVX, we use the combined numbers from all bins for a more261
precise determination of a global electron data-MC efficiency scale factor which is determined262
as datae /
e = 0.953  0.014 (stat.) for events with number of jets  1. Four main sources of263
systematic error on the data-MC efficiency scale factor were studied.264
Different behavior of electrons and photons in MC: Even though the photon ID cuts are de-265
signed to be similarly efficient for both electrons and photons, there might be a small difference266
in the performance between the two kinds of particles, e.g. because of electron bremsstrahlung.267
To check this effect, the MC electron efficiency was calculated using a Z " ee sample and the268
MC photon efficiency was calculated using a # + jets sample. Both samples were reconstructed269
in CMSSWv3.6. Half the difference between these two results, 0.5%, was taken as an error on270
the scale factor.271
Pile-up: To account for the possibility that the MC simulation may not adequately reproduce272
the data in a high pile-up environment, the data-MC scale factor for events with 1-4 good273
reconstructed primary vertices was calculated, along with the same for events with 5 good274
reconstructed primary vertices. This particular division of the data was chosen because the275
pile-up distribution in data peaks at # 5 primary vertices per event (see e.g. Figure 27). The276
difference between the scale factors from both samples, 0.024, was taken as an error on the scale277
factor from pile-up.278
Signal fit over/underestimation: It was found that the signal fit slightly underestimates the279
data in the tag-pass sample, and slightly overestimates it in the tag-fail sample. To cover this280
Figure 6.1: The efficiency correction between data and MC as a function of the number
of primary vertices.
 MCe = electron efficiency obtained using Z  ee events in MC that satisfy the
photon selection.
The selection criteria for electrons are the same as those for photons except that electrons
have a track. The distribution in photon or electron identification variables is similar for
isolated photons and electrons. Using Z  ee events in data, the tag-and-probe method
is used to find the electron efficiency. One electron (tag) is selected with stringent criteria
to be sure that it is an electron. Another electron (probe) with looser requirements is
located such that the invariant mass of the two electrons lies in the Z peak.
Figure 6.1 shows the variation of the efficiency correction as a function of the number of
reconstructed primary vertices. The MC photon efficiency is MC = 0.824  0.003 and
the scale factor is found to be datae /
e = 0.953  0.014(stat.). Two possible sources of
systematic uncertainty on this number were considered:
Electrons and photons behave differently in MC: Both electrons and photons give
EM showers in the ECAL and the selection cuts have been chosen to be similarly efficient
for electrons and photons. However, one can imagine that there may be a slight difference
between the two e.g. because of bremsstrahlung. To check this effect the MC electron
efficiency from Z  ee events was compared with the MC photon efficiency from +jet
events. Half the difference between the two results, 0.5 %, was taken as a systematic error
on the scale factor.
Pile-up: The MC may not accurately model the data in a high pile-up environment. To
estimate the size of this effect the scale factor was calculated for events with fewer than
5 primary vertices and events with at least 5 primary vertices. The number 5 was cho-
sen because that is approximately where the distribution of primary vertices in the data
peaks. The difference between the scale factors in the two samples, 0.024, was taken as a
systematic error on the scale factor.
Combining the systematic errors above with the statistical error yields a final data-MC
efficiency scale factor of datae /
e = 0.953  0.038. This uncertainty on the scale factor
translates into an uncertainty of 3.8% on the signal prediction.
6.3 Jet Energy Scale
Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits in the calorimeters. pT and  dependent jet
energy corrections are applied to the raw calorimeter energy to get the jet energy. Any
variation in these corrections would change the jet pT , the HT and the /ET .
The appropriate jet energy corrections are determined from +jet events in data. The
photon is used as a reference object because its energy is well measured by the ECAL.
The response
is measured in bins of jet pT and  to get the jet energy corrections.
Details of the procedure to determine the jet energy corrections and their uncertainties
are given in [11]. Figure 6.2 shows the jet energy correction factors as a function of jet pT
for jets with || = 1.0 and as a function of  for jets with pT = 200 GeV.

30 6 Jet Energy Calibration
6.6 Combined Jet Energy Correction
In this section, the combined MC and residual calibration is presented along with the total jet
energy scale systematic uncertainty. Following Eq. (12), the residual corrections for the relative
and absolute response are multiplied with the generator-level MC correction, while the cor-
responding uncertainties are added in quadrature. Figure 26 shows the combined calibration
factor as a function of jet- for pT = 50, 200 GeV. Because of the smallness of the residual cor-
rections, the combined correction has the shape of the MC component, shown in Fig. 6. The
total correction as a function of jet pT is shown in Fig. 27 for various  values. Figure 28 shows
the total jet energy scale uncertainty as a function of jet pT. At low jet pT the relative energy
scale uncertainty makes a significant contribution to the total uncertainty while it becomes neg-
ligible at high pT. In the forward region, the relative scale uncertainty remains significant in
the entire pT-range. In general PF jets have the smallest systematic uncertainty while CALO
jets have the largest.

as a function of  with pT = 200 GeV (right). Three diferent jet reconstructions are
shown: CALO, JPT and PF. PF jets are used in this analysis. The bands indicate the
corresponding uncertainties. Reproduced from [11]
The uncertainty is  3 % on jets above 50 GeV and  5 % on smaller jets and unclustered
energy. Figure 6.3 shows the jet energy scale uncertainty against jet pT for central jets
and Figure 6.4 shows the jet energy scale uncertainty against jet  for 100 GeV jets.
In order to evaluate the effect of the jet energy scale uncertainty on the signal efficiency
 acceptance, the pT of all the jets is modified upward and downward according to the
jet energy uncertainties before applying the event selection. The /ET can be expressed as
Equation 6.3.
/ET =  jets photon unclustered energy (6.3)
The /ET is modified to take account of the jet energy correction uncertainties by the
following procedure:
 Add the photon to the /ET (i.e. remove it from consideration).
 Add the jets also to get the unclustered energy.
 Modify the unclustered energy up and down by 5 % in a correlated way with the jet
energy correction uncertainties.

Figure 6.5 shows the leading jet pT distribution with a one sigma upward variation and a
one sigma downward variation in jet energy scale. Figure 6.6 shows how the variation in
jet energy scale affects the /ET and HT distributions.
The variation in signal efficiency  acceptance resulting from the 1 variations of the
jet energy scale on the jet pT , /ET and HT is extracted. The value of  varies about its
nominal value, 0.382, by 0.017 when the jet energy scale is varied within its uncertainty.
This means the uncertainty on the signal efficiency  acceptance from the jet energy scale
is 4.4 %.
6.4 Jet pT Resolution

one sigma upward variaton (red) and one sigma downward variation (blue) in jet energy

 Di-jet asymmetry: This method uses balanced di-jet events which are abundant
in data and considers pT conservation. An asymmetry variable is constructed from
the pT of the two jets:
p1T  p2T
p1T + p
(6.4)
The variance of the asymmetry variable can be expressed as:
2A =
(6.5)
For jets which lie in the same  bin and the same pT bin, the pT s are the same and
the resolutions are the same so there is an expression for the fractional pT resolution
in terms of the variance in the asymmetry which can be measured in the data:
2A (6.6)
 /Z+jet balance: This method uses +jet or Z+jet events from data and uses the
 or Z as a well measured reference object to which the jet pT can be compared. In
balanced events the /Z has the same pT as the jet. The variation of the ratio, R,
of the jet pT relative to the /Z pT in bins of /Z pT gives the jet pT resolution.
(6.7)
Further details on the jet pT resolution measurement and determination of the associated
uncertainty can be found in [11]. The jet pT resolution as a function of jet pT and for

|| < 0.5 is shown in Figure 6.7. The figure also shows that MC agrees well with the
data as far as jet energy resolution is concerned. For the SUSY events the true jet
energy comes from matching the reconstructed jets to the generator level in the MC. The
jet energy resolution is determined by comparing the reconstructed jet energy with the
generator level jet energy. This gives a jet pT resolution similar to that measured in [11].
The resolution is varied upward and downward by 50 %, which correspond to the uncer-
tainty on the forward jets but is conservative for the central jets. Figure 6.8 shows the jet
energy resolution with an upward and a downward variation.
Figure 6.9 shows the effect of the variation in resolution on the HT and /ET distributions.
The important result is how the variation in jet energy resolution affects the signal effi-
ciency. The signal efficiency is 0.3820.005 when the jet energy resolution is varied within
its uncertainty. This means the uncertainty on the signal efficiency from the jet energy
resolution is 1.2 %.

6.5 Pile-up
Pile-up is where there are multiple interations per bunch crossing. Pile-up affects the
number of signal events in several ways:
 The HT increases due to jets and underlying event activity from other interactions
in the same bunch crossing.
 The /ET distribution is broadened by the introduction of more jets and underlying
event activity.
 The photon isolation efficiency is reduced since there is more surrounding activity
which can populate the isolation cone.
Most of the pile-up events are soft with, at most, low pT jets and do not contribute much
to HT . Since the signal MC does not have pile-up simulated, the effect of pile-up on the
HT is evaluated by looking at the HT distribution in MC QCD events with and without
pile-up. A shift of 6.8  0.8 is applied to the no pile-up HT distribution to match the
pile-up HT distribution (Figure 6.10). With a 1 variation in the HT shift the signal
efficiency is 0.3821 0.0003, an uncertainty of 0.1 %.
The /ET distribution is broadened by the introduction of more jets and underlying event
activity from other interactions in the same bunch crossing. The pile-up events will mostly
be low HT and balanced so will have only a little effect on the /ET . The /ET distribution

is smeared to account for pile-up. To determine the amount of smearing necessary a QCD
sample with similar HT and no pile-up is smeared until the shape agrees with the /ET dis-
tribution with pile-up. Figure 6.11 shows the average /ET in QCD events without pile-up
as a function of the /ET smearing. From the plot a /ET smearing of 3.50.5 GeV is applied
to account for pile-up. The important number is the uncertainty in the signal efficiency
due to the uncertainty in the /ET smearing to account for pile-up, which is found to be
0.3821 0.0004. This corresponds to an uncertainty of 0.1 %.
The photon isolation efficiency is particularly affected by pile-up because activity from
other events in the same bunch crossing can populate the isolation cone. To quantify this
effect QCD MC events with a similar HT were used to determine the photon efficiency
in MC as a function of the number of primary vertices. Figure 6.12 shows the photon
efficiency as a function of the number of primary vertices. The efficiency is shown relative
to the efficiency when there is only a single reconstructed primary vertex. Taking the dis-
tribution of number of primary vertices from data, the efficiency expected in the presence
of pile-up can be calculated. This method assumes that photons in SUSY events have a

similar behaviour in the presence of pile-up to photons in QCD events. This assumption
is reasonable beacause the pile-up affects mainly the isolation through extra surrounding
activity which is a property of the event rather than the photon. This method also relies
on MC modelling the photon efficiency in pile-up well. This can be checked by looking
at Z  ee events in data. The efficiency requires only a small correction between data
and MC which is relatively stable with respect to the number of reconstructed primary
vertices (Figure 6.1). The photon efficiency correction due to pile-up is 0.83 0.01. This
produces an uncertainty of 2.6 % on the signal efficiency times acceptance.
6.6 Signal Cross-Section
To calculate the cross-section for p+ p X, the parton collision a+ b X must first be
considered (Figure 6.13). The cross-section for partons a and b with momentum fractions
x1 and x2 is calculated. To get the cross-section from protons the PDFs must be folded
in and the possible partons must be summed over as in Equation 6.8.

The cross-section for the parton process a + b  X is an infinte sum over terms corre-
sponding to processes with extra Feynman diagram vertices and radiations as in Equation
6.9. The terms get smaller as more vertices are introduced. To do the calculation the
series must be cut off at some order. Here the series is cut off at Next to Leading Order
(NLO).
 = 0 + 1 + ... (6.9)
Thus there are two major sources of uncertainty on the signal cross-section:
 The uncertainties on the PDFs, fa(x,Q2) and fb(x,Q2) above.
 The uncertainty from higher order terms.
Figure 6.14 shows the cross-section and total percentage uncertainty for each parameter
point in the mSquark vs mGluino plane.
6.7 Integrated Luminosity
The luminosity is calculated using the HF and normalised by van der Meer scans of the
beam profile [64]. The integrated luminosity can be written as:
(6.10)
where:
  is the mean number of interactions per bunch crossing;
 nb is the number of bunches;
 f is the revolution frequency of the bunches;
 eff is the effective cross-section of the selection.
The number of bunches and the revolution frequency are known precisely. The mean num-
ber of interactions per bunch crossing is determined from the fraction of empty towers in
the HF. A relative value for the effective cross-section is found from the linear relationship
between tower ET and luminosity.
The normalisation of the luminosity measurement is done using van der Meer scans of the
transverse beam profile [65]. The size and shape of the interaction region is measured as
a function of transverse beam separation. With a proton density of F (x, y) = fx(x)fy(y)
and N protons per bunch, the absolute luminosity can be written as:
N2fnbF (0, 0)
fxdx
fydy
 (6.11)
Assuming a gaussian transverse beam profile, the denominator can be calculated as 4xy,
where x and y are extracted from gaussian fits to the transverse beam profile.
The dominant uncertainty on the luminosity measurement comes from the beam current
measurement (3.1 %). The total uncertainty on the integrated luminosity measurement is

Limit Setting and Results
7.1 Introduction
Once the event selection and background estimation procedure have been defined and the
data has been collected one needs to determine the limit on the cross section of a possible
SUSY signal (according to a specific model) or, if a discovery has been made, the signifi-
cance of that discovery. In the present case no discovery has been made so a limit on the
cross section must be found. There are various statistical procedures for doing this and
no consensus on the best method. Here the CLs method is used [18, 66, 67, 68]. The CLs
method is widely used in the field of particle physics. The results are interpreted as an
exclusion in the squark mass vs gluino mass plane.
A likelihood function must be defined. The likelihood is the probability of the data being
observed given a model. The CLs method encompasses the statistical uncertainties on
the expected number of events as well as the systematic uncertainties associated with the
background estimation and signal prediction (e.g. luminosity measurement and jet en-
ergy scale uncertainty). Parameters in the likelihood include the parameter of interest on
which we wish to set a limit  the amount of signal in this case  in addition to nuisance
parameters associated with the systematic uncertainties.
The goal is to find a confidence interval for the parameter of interest based on the likeli-
hood. This gives an upper limit on the size of a possible SUSY signal at a given confidence
level. An exclusion plot with the expected limit and the observed limit is given for the
GMSB models considered here in squark mass vs gluino mass parameter space. The exclu-
sion plot for another CMS analysis of the same dataset looking at the same SUSY models
is shown for comparison.
7.2 Likelihood Function
The likelihood function is the probability of observing the data given the model. There is a
statistical component to the likelihood based on the number of events we can expect given
a model prediction. The statistical component follows a poisson distribution. There are
also systematic uncertainties based on how well the signal and background are predicted.
These contribute a Gaussian component to the likelihood.
 b = Estimated number of background events;
 s = Number of expected signal events according to the model being tested;
 n = Number of events observed.
Considering only the statistical uncertainty on the expected number of events, which
follows a Poisson distribution, the likelihood for the background only hypothesis is given
by Equation 7.1.
Lb = p(n|b) =
bneb
(7.1)
And for the signal plus background hypothesis the likelihood is given by Equation 7.2.
Ls+b = p(n|s+ b) =
(s+ b)ne(s+b)
(7.2)
The number of signal events can be written as:
s = fL (7.3)
This is the same as Equation 6.1 for the number of signal events, except that a signal
strength factor, f , has been added. f is the parameter of interest on which we are seeking
to set a limit. The likelihood for the signal plus background hypothesis can now be written
as Equation 7.4.
Ls+b(f) =
(fL+ b)ne(fL+b)
(7.4)
Systematic uncertainties are introduced to the likelihood by allowing the parameters in the
likelihood (b, ,  and L) to vary according the their uncertainties. These parameters are
called nuisance parameters. To implement this, Gaussian terms are added to the likelihood
with mean equal to the estimated value and sigma equal to the uncertainty. This allows
them to vary away from their estimated value, but the Gaussian constrains them according
to their uncertainty by paying a penalty in the likelihood. For example, the integrated
luminosity was measured to be 1.1000.044 fb1 so a Gaussian term with mean 1.100 and
sigma 0.044 is added to the likelihood. Equation 7.5 shows the full likelihood function,
including nuisance parameters.
Ls+b(f ; b, , , L) =
(L + b)
ne(L+b)
(7.5)
The likelihood is used in the CLs method to find the upper limit on the parameter of
interest, f .
7.3 CLs
The CLs method is used to determine the confidence interval for the parameter of interest,
f . The method is widely used within particle physics: it was used at the Tevatron for
the Higgs limit [69] and at the LHC for the Higgs limit [70] and SUSY searches [71]. The
CLs method profiles the nuisance parameters to incorporate systematic uncertainties in
the limit.
The procedure for finding the confidence interval using CLs is:
 Construct a likelihood function. Equation 7.5 in this case.
 Construct a test statistic qf for performing a hypothesis test. There are various
possible choices for the this, here the profile likelihood ratio is used (Equation 7.6).
Ls+b(f ; )
Lb(0;
(7.6)
 Step through the possible values of the parameter of interest, f .
 Consider two hypotheses: the signal + background hypothesis and the background
only hypothesis. For each hypothesis generate pseudo data according to the likeli-
hood. Call the generated data MC toys.
 Calculate the the p-values:
CLsb = P (qf  qobsf |signal + background) (7.7)
CLb = P (qf  qobsf |background only) (7.8)
These are the fraction of MC toys for which the test statistic is greater than the
observed value given the signal + background hypothesis (Equation 7.7) and given
the background hypothesis (Equation 7.8).
 Construct CLs as a ratio of p-values (Equation 7.9). This cannot be interpreted as a
p-value itself. It gives an idea of how much more probable to observe the data given
the signal + background hypothesis than the background only hypothesis.
CLs =
(7.9)
 Those values of f for which CLs <  are excluded at a confidence level (CL) of 1.
Here the CL is taken to be 95%. The upper limit on f at 95% CL is the value of f
for which CLs = 0.05.
The CLs method is used to calculate the upper limit on f for each point in the parameter
space. Figure 7.1 shows the upper limit on f in the squark mass vs gluino mass plane for
the 441 points in the grid.
7.4 Interpolation and Smoothing
The grid of SUSY parameter points is rather coarse giving a jagged exclusion line. To
make a smooth limit an interpolation is performed between the points on the grid to make

a finer grid with more points in the parameter space. The upper limit on f is taken
to vary linearly between points on the grid. Figure 7.2 shows the finer grid after linear
interpolation between the points. The resulting exclusion line is still slightly jagged due
to the finite number of points in the interpolation. To smooth the line each point along
the line is replaced by a moving average which is the mean of the closest five points.
7.5 Expected and Observed Limit
An expected limit without looking at the data can be calculated. Pseudo data is gener-
ated using the background model. An expected limit is calculated using any of the above
methods using the pseudo data as if it were data.
Many sets of pseudo data are generated and a limit on the cross section of a possible SUSY
signal is calculated for each. An expected limit can be drawn on the SUSY parameter
space by linking those parameter points for which the signal can be excluded at 95% con-
fidence level in half of the pseudo experiments. The 1 band, a line linking the parameter
points where the signal is excluded for 68% of the pseudo experiments, is also drawn.
Figure 7.3 shows the final limit plot at 95% CL with the expected limit, the 1 sigma
band and the observed exclusion limit. The exclusion limit from another CMS analysis,
RA3 [12], looking at the same signal model is also shown for comparison.
The limits on GMSB from previous experiments such as ALEPH [52], CDF [54] and D0
[53] are concerned with electroweak production rather than strong production. A direct
comparison is difficult since the results are interpreted in a different parameter space, but
these experiments have a much lower reach in terms of squark and gluino mass due to the
lower
The limit presented here is similar to the RA3 limit at high gluino mass, but excludes
more parameter space at high squark mass (Figure 7.3). The RA3 search selects events
using the  + /ET signature which is better in a cleaner environment with fewer jets, but
worse in an environment with more jets because the photon efficieny is lower as a photon
may be lost in a jet. Parameter points with high squark mass tend to have more jets.

Conclusions
A limit has been placed on the GMSB cross-section using 1.1 fb1 of proton-proton colli-
sions data at
s = 7 TeV from the CMS detector. The event selection was based on the
signature:  + jets + /ET . Variables HT and /ET , which indicate the energy scale of the
event and the missing transverse energy of the event respectively, were used to search for
GMSB. The background from QCD processes was estimated using a control sample from
data in which the isolation cut on the photons was inverted. The negligible electroweak
background was estimated using Monte Carlo simulation. A grid of signal samples in
squark mass versus gluino mass parameter space was available. The signal efficiency for
each parameter point was estimated using the MC samples. Systematic uncertainties due
to the jet energy scale, jet energy resolution, photon efficiency and pile-up were considered.
The signal efficiencies were multiplied by the signal cross-section and integrated luminos-
ity to get the predicted number of signal events. With an observed number of events, a
background estimation and a signal prediction, the CLs method was used to put a limit
on the GMSB relative cross-section in squark mass versus gluino mass parameter space.
