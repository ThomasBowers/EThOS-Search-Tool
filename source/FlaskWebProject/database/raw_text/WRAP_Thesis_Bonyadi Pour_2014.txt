Medicago truncatula. 
Abstract 
Nitrogen availability is central to global food security. Understanding how 
plants respond to nitrogen could help develop crops with improved nitrogen 
use. This study aims to investigate how lateral root (LR) and nodule 
development are balanced in response to low (0.1 mM) and high (5 mM) 
NH4NO3 concentrations in the model legume Medicago truncatula var. 
Jemalong A17 using phenotypic and gene regulatory network analysis. 
High concentrations of NH4NO3 have an inhibitory effect on nodulation. 
The phenotypic measurements of root architecture of A17 in response to 
NH4NO3 and rhizobia showed that at high NH4NO3 rhizobia affected LR 
development. Total root size was less (P < 0.05) in rhizobia inoculated 
samples compared to the absence of rhizobia. This was due to a shorter 
primary root and less number of LRs. Whole genome profiling of early (2 and 
6 hour) root responses to high NH4NO3 and rhizobia identified 4793 genes 
that were differentially expressed (significance cutoff of P<0.05). The early (2 
and 6 h) responses to high NH4NO3 were mainly independent of the rhizobia 
effect and N-induction especially at 2 h time point was the predominant 
response. Some of the components of the autoregulation of nodulation (AON) 
pathway are also involved in LR development. The sunn-1 mutant is impaired 
in correct AON signals that lead to hypernodulation with short LRs at low N. 
Whole genome expression analysis of A17 and sunn-1 root samples identified 
7186 significantly (P<0.05) expressed genes showing rhizobia and/or SUNN-
regulated responses. These genes could be components of the AON pathway 
with putative role in balancing the number of nodules with LR development. 
Using motif analysis tools we identified motifs with putative promoters that 
were mainly Nodule specific cysteine rich peptides (NCRs). We suggest that 
these NCRs may be involved in regulating LR and nodule development 
depending on the plant N status.

Introduction 
1.1 Nitrogen, a fundamental molecule for plants  
Nitrogen (N) is an essential component of molecules including nucleic 
acids, amino acids and phytohormones thus it is essential for all aspects of 
plant development. N in its different forms such as nitrate and ammonium act 
as signal molecules regulating plant gene expression, metabolism, growth 
and development (Ruffel et al., 2008, Vidal and Gutirrez, 2008, Bouguyon et 
al., 2012). N is available in the soil in several forms and it is acquired by 
plants as mineral (nitrate, nitrite and ammonium) and organic (amino acids 
and peptides) forms. Nitrate and ammonium are the two major forms of N 
available to plants in the soil. 
N limitation is often a limiting factor for plant growth and development 
(Alvarez et al., 2012) and crop yield (Hirel et al., 2011). Soil N availability is 
heterogeneous, even in managed agricultural soils, and several factors cause 
fluctuations in the soil N content. Mineral N from added fertilizers or 
mineralized organic matter can be depleted through leaching or be released 
as N gases to the atmosphere (Hirel et al., 2011). The uptake of nitrate and 
ammonium by the roots makes the rhizosphere alkalised or acidic, thereby 
altering the soil N availability for plants (Marschner, 1995).  
Atmospheric N2 that comprises 80% of the atmosphere (Sanhueza, 
1982) is not directly usable by plants. Atmospheric N2 can enter the biological 
cycle by conversion into nitrate by lightning or photochemical conversion and 
into ammonia by the Haber-Bosch industrial fixation (Marschner, 1995). 
Legumes have also evolved this ability to use atmospheric N2 in the form of 
ammonium through the symbiotic relationship they establish with specific N2 
fixing soil bacteria. 
N in the form of nitrate is taken up via plasma membrane-localised 
transporters. It is then assimilated into the primary organic forms of N 
glutamine and glutamate and then all other N-containing metabolites and 
macromolecules through a series of enzymatic reactions. The assimilatory 
reduction of nitrate takes place in two steps (Figure 1-1). Nitrate is reduced to 
nitrite (NO2-) by nitrate reductases (NR) in the cytosol in a two-electron 
reaction and then to ammonium (NH4+) by nitrite reductase enzymes (NiR). 
Ammonium is then assimilated into amino acids by the combined action of 
glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase in plastids and chloroplasts 
(Crawford, 1995, Orea et al., 2001, Mrquez et al., 2005, Bouguyon et al., 
2012). 
Several abiotic and biotic factors can affect the efficiency of the plant 
root in acquiring N (Schiefelbein and Benfey, 1991, Robinson, 1994). These 
include the availability of other nutrients or pathogen attack. To respond to 
external N availability and whole plant N status, and integrate other abiotic 
and biotic factors there are a number of plant regulatory responses. These 
include alterations to root system architecture (RSA) (Dastidar et al., 2011), 
regulation of uptake systems for nitrate and ammonium with different affinities 
(Bouguyon et al., 2012) and integration of local and systemic signaling 
pathways (Ruffel et al., 2008, Alvarez et al., 2012) that are activated in 
response to N.  
1.1.1 N uptake systems 
N availability to plants in the soil is heterogeneous, with plants facing 
simultaneous local high or low concentrations of N across the root system. 
Plants have evolved several uptake and transport systems to cope with their 
rapidly changing environment (Gutirrez, 2012, Alvarez et al., 2012, Canales 
et al., 2014). Nitrate (Crawford and Glass, 1998) and ammonium (Ludewig et 
al., 2007) are acquired through two different uptake systems 
Figure 1-1: The process of nitrate assimilation (Mrquez et al., 2005).  
(Glass et al., 2002). Low affinity transport systems (LATS) that act at high N 
concentrations (>1 mM) and high affinity transport systems (HATS) that are 
activated at low (M concentration ranges) N (Kraiser et al., 2011). 
Studies in Arabidopsis have revealed that two nitrate transporter families 
known as NRT1 and NRT2 are responsible for transport of nitrate. NRT1 and 
NRT2 are symporters, transferring nitrate with H+ in a symport mechanism and 
based on the pH gradient cross the membrane (Kraiser et al., 2011). NRT2 
encodes high affinity nitrate transporters (Bouguyon et al., 2012). NRT1 
encodes low affinity nitrate transporters with the exception of NRT1.1, which 
is a dual affinity nitrate transporter involved in both low and high affinity nitrate 
transport (Wang et al., 1998, Liu et al., 1999, Liu and Tsay, 2003). Ammonium 
is transported by members of the ammonium transporter 1 (AMT1) family 
including AMT1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.5 (Alvarez et al., 2012). These proteins are 
either ammonium uniporters transferring ammonium along the 
electrochemical gradient or they are NH3/H+ co-transporters (Kraiser et al., 
2011). 
The ability of AtNRT1.1 to switch from low to high affinity modes is a 
regulatory mechanism enabling plants to respond rapidly to the changes in N 
availability. This regulation is via phosphorylation of the threonine residue 101 
(T101). AtNRT1.1 acts as a high affinity nitrate transporter when it is 
phosphorylated (at low nitrate, <1 mM) and as a low affinity transporter when 
dephosphorylated (Liu and Tsay, 2003). AtCIPK23 is a signaling kinase that 
phosphorylates T101 of AtNRT1.1 at low nitrate concentration leading to a low 
level primary high affinity response and a weak induction of AtNRT2.1 (Ho et 
al., 2009). At high nitrate concentration (> 1mM), T101 is not phosphorylated, 
thus AtNRT1.1 functions as a low affinity transporter/sensor and the 
expression of AtNRT2.1 is highly induced (Ho et al., 2009).  
1.1.2 Signaling pathways responding to N availability and affecting RSA 
N uptake systems are under the control of local and systemic signaling. 
The activity of the uptakes systems are regulated in a way that the net intake 
of N depends on the plant need and demand (i.e. plants current growth and 
developmental stage) rather than the N availability in the root environment 
(Imsande and Touraine, 1994). Roots respond to localized supplies of nitrate 
by a transient and localized increase in nitrate uptake activity and an increase 
in LR proliferation in the part of the root subjected to high nitrate (Forde, 
2002). Shoot to root signals are involved in the systemic signals regulating the 
N response. 
1.1.2.1 Regulation and signaling of N responses 
In the primary nitrate response (PNR), nitrate rapidly induces the 
expression of a series of nitrate-related genes (Figure 1-2). The expression of 
a calcineurin B-like (CBL)-interacting protein kinase (CIPK8) is rapidly induced 
by nitrate and it positively regulates the expression of PNR genes such as 
nitrate transporter genes and genes involved in nitrate assimilation (Hu et al., 
2009). Studies analysing the kinetic level of the induction of these genes by 
nitrate suggest that there are two high and low affinity response phases 
(Figure 1-2). Studies on cipk8 mutant defective in the low affinity phase 
suggest that CIPK8 is involved in the low affinity phase and that these two 
phases are genetically distinct.  
The dual affinity nitrate transporter NRT1.1 and the high affinity nitrate 
transporter NRT2.1 have dual functions as transporters and also as sensors 
in the roots for nitrate availability. They act together in the nitrate-signaling 
pathway (Figure 1-2) and this role is separate from their role as nitrate 
transporters. In NRT1.1 mutants of Arabidopsis nitrate responsive genes are 
not regulated in response to nitrate. Suggesting the dual function of NRT1.1 
as a nitrate transporter and sensor (Wang et al., 2009), mutants of chl1 and 
atnrt1.2 show altered root architecture even in the absence of nitrate, which 
could be an evidence for the roles of NRT1.1 and NRT2.1 as sensors and 
signal transducers (Guo et al., 2001, Little et al., 2005, WalchLiu and Forde, 
2008). In the chl1-9 mutant, proline residue 492 is changed to leucine by a 
point mutation. In this mutant, AtNRT1.1 nitrate uptake function is reduced at 
Figure 1-2: Known key molecular players of the signaling pathways 
regulating N responses (Gutirrez, 2012). Several metabolic, 
physiological and developmental pathways are involved in the adaptive 
responses to N availability. Primary and long-term responses are 
activated in response to nitrate. The primary nitrate response signaling 
pathways comprises of (A) the kinase CIPK8-dependent (low-affinity: 
high nitrate concentration) and (B) CIPK8-independent (high-affinity: 
low nitrate concentration) pathways (Ho et al., 2009). NRT1.1 is a dual 
affinity nitrate transporter acting as a nitrate sensor and transporter. It is 
involved in the short-term induction and long-term repression of the 
genes involved in the nitrate transport and assimilation. The affinity of 
NRT1.1 is regulated by the kinase CIPK23 that is responsible for the 
phosphorylation of the T101 residue. NRT1.1 is dephosphorylated at 
high nitrate condition (> 1 mM) and functions as a low affinity 
transporter (A) and phosphorylated at low nitrate concentration (< 1 
mM) to act as a high affinity transporter (B). The high affinity nitrate 
transporter NRT2.1 is a key component in the systemic signal 
regulating root nitrate uptake (Ruffel et al., 2008). It also has a separate 
role as a nitrate sensor suppressing LR initiation at low nitrate 
availability (Little et al., 2005). ANR1 controlling LR elongation in 
response to patches of nitrate supply and acts downstream NRT1.1 
(Zhang and Forde, 1998). LBD 37/38/39, NLP7, HY5, HYH and SPL9 
are other TFs participating in the nitrate signaling pathways. Green 
shapes: TFs, gray octagons: enzymes, pink octagons: microRNAs, and 
brown shapes: other regulatory molecules. Black lines: relationships 
obtained by molecular genetic approaches, and red lines: relationships 
discovered by systems biology approaches (Gutirrez, 2012).  
the low and high affinity range but the primary nitrate response of AtNRT2.1 is 
not affected by this change in amino acid (Ho et al., 2009). This could 
therefore suggest that the role of AtNRT1.1 as a nitrate transporter is 
independent of its role as a nitrate sensor. 
In Arabidopsis, NRT2.1 is under the control of nitrate availability and N 
metabolites such as glutamate. Local supply of nitrate induces the expression 
of NRT2.1 (Zhuo et al., 1999) while it is suppressed by the systemic signals 
from shoot to root when the plant N status is high (Gansel et al., 2001). 
AtNRT2.1 is one of the key components of the systemic signaling of nitrate 
response. When high nitrate concentration is supplied for several days it is 
downregulated by AtNRT1.1 (Muos et al., 2004, Krouk et al., 2006). 
AtNRT1.1 has the ability to sense the broad range of nitrate concentrations in 
the soil by its dual-affinity binding and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation 
abilities (Ho et al., 2009). In split root experiments when supplying one part of 
the root with high nitrate and subjecting the other part to nitrate starvation the 
expression of AtNRT2.1 increased in the nitrate fed section of the root in 
response to the N starved part. This suggests that AtNRT2.1 expression is 
under the control of shoot to root systemic signaling of N demand. The 
increase in expression level in the nitrate fed part of the root suggests that 
AtNRT2.1 is one of the first targets of the long-distance signaling that informs 
the roots of the whole plants N status (Gansel et al., 2001). 
One of the main regulators of the nitrate signaling pathway is the NIN-
like protein 7 (NLP7) TF, a homologue of NIN (Nodule Inception) protein, 
which is one of the regulators of nodulation in legumes (Schauser et al., 
2005). NLP7 is involved in the direct regulation of several steps of PNR and 
signaling pathways (Castaings et al., 2009, Marchive et al., 2013). Hundreds 
of regulatory and structural genes involved in nitrate metabolism and signaling 
have been identified as direct NLP7 targets showing early (within just 10 min) 
nitrate response (Marchive et al., 2013). The transcript abundance of three 
members of the lateral organ boundary domain (LBD) gene family, 
LBD37/38/39, is induced by nitrate and represses the biosynthesis of 
anthocyanin and many N responsive genes including genes required for 
nitrate uptake and assimilation (Rubin et al., 2009). Other TFs that are key 
regulators of PNR are elongated hypocotyl 5 (HY5), HY5-homolog (HYH) and 
squamosal promoter binding protein-like 9 (SPL9). HY5 and HYH are bZIP 
TFs that positively regulate nitrate reductase (NIA) 2 and negatively regulate 
NRT1.1 in Arabidopsis (Jonassen et al., 2009). SPL9 is a negative regulator 
of NIR and NIA2 (Krouk et al., 2010b) (Figure 1-2). 
1.1.2.2 Regulation and signaling of RSA development in response to N  
The uptake rate of nitrate sensed and regulated by AtNRT2.1, rather 
than the external level of nitrate is the key factor causing changes in RSA. 
AtNRT2.1 acts as a nitrate sensor or signal transducer to regulated LR 
development in response to N availability (Little et al., 2005, Remans et al., 
2006b). In Arabidopsis NRT2.1 suppresses LR initiation at low nitrate and this 
suppression can be eliminated in the WT by increasing the concentration of 
external nitrate concentration. This repression is also released in the Atlin1 
mutant that carries a missense mutation in the NRT2.1 gene (Little et al., 
2005). Thus, NRT2.1 is involved on RSA changes in response to N 
availability: as a transporter it is involved in sensing and uptake of nitrate 
based on the external availability of nitrate and the N demands of the plant, 
with its signaling role triggering LR development in response to limiting N 
levels. 
NRT1.1 that is expressed in the apex of the primary root (PR), apex and 
base of lateral root (LR), young emergent LR and LR primordia (Guo et al., 
2001, Remans et al., 2006a) is also involved in the N-regulated changes of 
RSA. Studies on plants with mutation in NRT1.1 suggest that at low nitrate 
concentrations NRT1.1 is involved in LR primordia maturation and elongation 
and the first stages of PR growth at different concentrations of nitrate (Guo et 
al., 2001). 
The MADS box transcription factor (TF) Arabidopsis nitrateregulated1 
(ANR1) is one of the components of a signaling pathway affecting LR growth 
rate in response to localized nitrate supply by controlling LR elongation in 
response to nitrate. In Arabidopsis transgenic plants that showed repressed 
levels of ANR1 expression, localized nitrate supply did not lead to LR 
elongation (Zhang and Forde, 1998). NRT1.1 acts upstream of ANR1 in this 
signaling pathway controlling LR growth in response to external nitrate supply 
(Remans et al., 2006a) (Figure 1-2). 
In Arabidopsis thaliana LR initiation and higher order LR branching is 
increased by localized supply of ammonium but not LR elongation (Lima et 
al., 2010). The role of AtAMT1.3 in regulating LR branching in response to 
ammonium is independent of ammonium transport and this suggests that this 
transporter also has a signaling role (Lima et al., 2010). Studies show that in 
M. truncatula both root nitrate and ammonium uptake are under the control of 
the systemic signallings of N status of the whole plant (Ruffel et al., 2008). 
1.2 Dynamic regulation of LR and nodule development enables root 
architecture plasticity   
Legumes are important food and biofuel crops. The advantage legumes 
have acquired is the symbiotic relationship between the root and the N-fixing 
soil bacterium that enables them to take up otherwise unusable atmospheric 
N (80% of the atmosphere). This process is termed as nodulation. Nodulation 
is, with a few exceptions, limited to leguminous species (Sprent, 2007). 
Genetic evidence shows that nodule development integrates pre-existing 
plant regulatory pathways that are related to LR organogenesis (Mathesius, 
2003). The regulation of LR development itself shares parallels to root-
mutualist interactions, although rather than microbes, plant pathways are 
regulated by environmental conditions including N and phosphorus form and 
availability. 
LRs and nodules are both root lateral organs formed post embryonically 
by the reactivation of cell division in differentiated root cells in specific cell files 
(Malamy and Benfey, 1997, Stougaard, 2000) and are controlled spatially and 
quantitatively by hormone gradients (De Smet et al., 2007, Tirichine et al., 
2007, van Noorden et al., 2007, De Smet et al., 2008). The ability to form 
these new organs post embryonically gives plants potential plasticity to adapt 
to their environmental constraints. The formation of LRs is regulated 
principally by the availability of nutrients and this is controlled by hormone 
signaling pathways (Lpez-Bucio et al., 2003). LR development and 
nodulation share a common environmental regulation. They are both induced 
in conditions of low N (rhizobia-dependent), and the development of the two 
organs is fundamentally linked. High N can inhibit the formation of new 
nodules (Streeter, 1985, Thimm et al., 2004) and influence N fixation capacity 
of existing nodules (Cabeza et al., 2014). LR development is regulated 
through local and systemic responses to N (Desnos, 2008). There is also 
evidence that symbiotic organisms can affect LR development (Maillet et al., 
2011, Olh et al., 2005). 
LRs have existed for over 400 million years (Raven and Edwards, 2001). 
Nodules however, have evolved recently, around 60 million years ago 
possibly due to an environment that lacked N and was rich in CO2 (Sprent, 
2007). Thus, mechanisms that regulate nodule development may have been 
co-opted from the existing processes that regulated LR formation (Hirsch et 
al., 1997). Studies show that LRs and nodules share some similar 
developmental pathways. For example LR growth is slower in Lotus japonicus 
plants inoculated with rhizobia compared to control and the har1-1 
(hypernodulation aberrant root formation) mutant shows an even stronger 
phenotype. Lotus brush and crinkle mutants have reduced nodulation and are 
impaired in root development (Desbrosses and Stougaard, 2011). There are 
also mutants that form nodules similar to LRs. Peripheral vasculature are a 
characteristic of legume nodules. M. truncatula lin-4 mutant forms vascular 
bundles located centrally in the nodules. These vascular bundled are similar 
to LRs (Guan et al., 2013). M. truncatula nodule root (NOOT) and its 
orthologue in Pisum sativum cochleata (COCH) are essential for the 
maintenance of the nodule identity through the nodulation process. Studies on 
noot and coch mutants gives some more evidence for the root evolutionary 
origin of nodule vascular bundles suggesting that NOOT and COCH may 
have been used to repress root identity in the legume nodules (Couzigou et 
al., 2013).  
Several known and well-characterized regulators of nodulation (Oldroyd, 
2013) also affect LR development. For example, Nod factors are rhizobial-
signaling molecules that have a crucial role in the rhizobia-legume cross talk. 
LR formation can also be stimulated by Nod factors and the genes involved 
(e.g. NFP, DMI1, DMI2, DMI3 and NSP1) are the same genes required for the 
Nod factor induced symbiotic response (Olh et al., 2005). RNAi knockdown 
of the cytokinin receptor MtCRE1 in Medicago results in reduction in nodule 
number and increase in LR number (Gonzalez-Rizzo et al., 2006). latd (lateral 
root organ-defective) mutants in Medicago are unable to form active nodules 
or complete LR formation with consequential effects on PR development 
(Bright et al., 2005). Together these developmental and molecular 
connections support the accepted hypothesis that the nodule structure arose 
from a LR blueprint (discussed in Mathesius, 2003) whilst also co-opting or 
utilizing genetic interactions involved in AM interactions. (Deak and Malamy, 
2005) 
1.2.1 LR development 
The tap root system in Arabidopsis consists of a PR formed during 
embryogenesis and LRs that are formed post-embryonically (De Smet et al., 
2010). LRs are initiated close to the root tip and the fully developed LR 
emerges from the differentiation zone. LRs originate from the reactivation of 
cell division in differentiated pericycle cells that are located at the most outer 
layer of the vascular bundle (Tian et al., 2014). Recent studies on LR 
development in M. truncatula using DR5:GUS and DR5:VENUS-N7 reporter 
lines shows that endodermis and inner cortex also contribute in lateral root 
primordia (LRP) formation (Herrbach et al., 2013). DR5 marks local auxin 
accumulation and since LR initiation is triggered by auxin accumulation this 
promoter was used to study early stages of LR development. The DR5 activity 
at the early stage of LRP initiation is not only observed in pericycle dividing 
cells but is also extended to epidermis and inner cortex (Herrbach et al., 
2013). These are interesting differences in LR ontogeny with Arabidopsis 
thaliana. DR5:GUS expression profiling indicated that the endodermal and 
cortical cell divisions could be due to auxin accumulation (Herrbach et al., 
2013).  
Changes in auxin movement, perception of gravity and mechanical 
stimuli contribute to the regular distribution of LRs (Dastidar et al., 2011). 
Local auxin fluxes in root meristem are necessary for pericycle cells acquiring 
the identity of LR founder cell (De Smet et al., 2007, Dubrovsky et al., 2008). 
LR initiation takes place in a narrow developmental window. Studies on 
Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) shows that distinct 
zones on the root where auxin content and response are minimal define the 
position of this developmental window for LR initiation (Dubrovsky et al., 
2011). PIN3 and PIN7 are auxin efflux carriers from the PIN-Formed (PIN) 
family. They maintain the proximal auxin gradient with in the root and are 
essential for the correct positioning of the developmental window for LRs. In 
the zone of auxin minimum, pericycle cells have the highest probability of 
acquiring the identity of LR founder cells (Figure 1-3 a) (Dubrovsky et al., 
2011). This priming of pericycle founder cells (specification of these cells to 
divide and form a LR) that are located opposite the xylem poles occurs in a 
zone named the basal meristem (between the apical meristem and the 
elongation zone from the root tip) (Dastidar et al., 2011). Following the 
specification of LR founder cells and by the development of the PR, these 
primed pericycle cells are displaced further away from the root meristem. Cell 
division and initiation of development of the LRP is then triggered by a second 
auxin flux from the shoot (Dubrovsky et al., 2008). Auxin-induced expression 
of the auxin efflux carriers, encoded by the PIN genes (Figure 1-3 b) creates 
this auxin maxima leading to the first asymmetric cell division and cell fate 
respecification to acquire LRP identity (Laplaze et al., 2007). LR initiation 
starts with the asymmetric division of pericycle cells and occurs in the root 
differentiation zone (Dubrovsky et al., 2011). It is then followed by several 
Figure 1-3: Auxin-mediated control of LR growth in Arabidopsis. a) A 
well-defined zone with a minimum auxin content and response along the 
root defines the positioning of a developmental window for founder cell 
specification and LR initiation in Arabidopsis and tomato (Dubrovsky et 
al., 2011). In an intact growing root two distal and one proximal auxin 
gradients separated by an auxin minimum zone are established that 
define a morphogenetic zone for LR initiation. At the zone with the 
minimum auxin concentration pericycle cells have the highest probability 
of acquiring the identity of founder cells (FC). In Arabidopsis roots the 
distal gradient usually ends at 0.2 mm from the root tip and the proximal 
auxin gradient starts 4.5-6 mm from the quiescent centre. This 
morphogenetic zone is dynamic and moves in the same direction and at 
the same rate as the root growth. NPA-sensitive polar auxin transport 
and auxin receptors of the TIR1AFB family are essential for the function 
of this developmental window. Upon the application of external auxin 
(NAA) the distribution of the morphogenetic zone is rearranged 
activating the cells outside this zone to act as FCs (Dubrovsky et al., 
2011). b) An auxin maxima leads to the first asymmetric cell division and 
cell fate respecification to acquire LRP identity. This second auxin flux is 
transferred from the shoot to the PR tip and LRP by PIN1-dependant 
auxin transport (green arrows) and is accumulated at the tip of the LRP 
forming an auxin maximum (green cells). Part of the auxin is then 
retrieved through a PIN2-dependent auxin route (blue arrows) (Dastidar 
et al., 2011).  28	
rounds of anticlinal and periclinal divisions (Figure 2-4) to form a dome 
shaped LRP (Malamy and Benfey, 1997, Herrbach et al., 2013, Lucas et al., 
2013).   
The new LRP must emerge through overlaying endodermis, cortex and 
epidermis cell layers. Cell separation of the adjacent cell tissues makes it 
possible for the LRP to emerge and auxin has a critical role in this. Auxin, 
produced in the new LRP is transported to the cortical cells overlaying the 
new LRP where it acts as an inductive signal inducing the expression of PIN3, 
which creates an auxin flux towards the epidermis (Pret et al., 2013). The 
intracellular concentration of auxin however, is high enough for induction of 
the auxin influx carrier LAX3. LAX3 is expressed only in two files of cortical 
cells overlaying the new LRP. The consecutive expression of PIN3 and LAX3 
prevents the expression of LAX3 in multiple cell files (Pret et al., 2013). 
LAX3 is required for emergence of the LRP through cortex and epidermis by 
controlling the auxin dependent induction of cell wall degrading enzymes 
(Swarup et al., 2008, Pret et al., 2013).  
1.2.1.1 Hormonal control of LR development 
Plant hormones and in particular auxin, cytokinin, ethylene, gibberellins 
(GA) and brassinosteroids (BR) have a central role in regulating LR growth. 
As previously mentioned, auxin influences all aspects of LR development 
such as initiation, positioning and patterning of LRP (De Smet et al., 2007, 
Dubrovsky et al., 2011) as well as emergence of a fully developed LR 
(Swarup et al., 2008, Pret et al., 2013). Studies show that plants impaired in 
auxin signaling form fewer LRs, and treatment of plants with auxin leads to an 
increase in the number of LRs (Laskowski, 2013). In Arabidopsis transgenic 
plants with reduced cytokinin concentrations, there was an increase in the 
number of LRs, suggesting that cytokinin is a negative regulator of LR 
development (Werner et al., 2003). Cytokinin regulates LR development by 
influencing the asymmetric cell division of the two adjacent founder cells. 
Downregulation of the expression of PIN genes by cytokinin inhibits the 
formation of the auxin gradient required for this asymmetric cell division and 
LRP patterning (De Smet et al., 2007).  
Cross talk between ethylene and auxin also regulates LR development 
due to ethylene interaction with auxin transport and perception. Ethylene 
inhibits LR formation at the early stages of initiation. In Arabidopsis and 
tomato, LR formation was reduced after treatment with ethylene or the 
ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid (ACC) compared to 
non treatment (Negi et al., 2008, Negi et al., 2010). Both Arabidopsis mutants 
in ethylene resistant 1 (etr1 or ein1), which confers a dominant negative 
ethylene receptor mutation, and ethylene insensitive 2 (ein2), have an 
increased number of LRs (Negi et al., 2008). Enhancing ethylene synthesis by 
application of low concentrations of ACC induces LRP initiation. Treatment 
with higher levels of ACC affects LRP development by inhibiting the ability of 
pericycle cells to initiate new LRP and promoting the emergence of already 
formed LRP . Studies on Arabidopsis root branching have also showed that 
the interaction of GA and BR with auxin controls PR growth (Fu and Harberd, 
2003) and promotes LR formation (Bao et al., 2004) respectively. 
1.2.2  Nodulation  
Nodules are formed through two closely coordinated processes: (i) the 
organogenic process, in which the nodule tissue is formed and (ii) the 
infection process, including the colonization of the bacteria inside the host 
plant (Madsen et al., 2010). The signal exchange between the two symbionts 
triggers nodule development. Flavonoids are released by the plant root to the 
rhizosphere as signal molecules to trigger the transcription of the nod genes 
in the rhizobia. Enzymes encoded by the Nod genes synthesise a second 
signal called the Nod factor. The rhizobia is recognised by plasma membrane-
localised Lysine Motif-Receptor-Like Kinases (LysMs) in the epidermal cells. 
LysMs including NFP and LYK3 in M. truncatula (Amor et al., 2003) and 
NFR1/NFR5 in L. japonicus (Madsen et al., 2003) recognise rhizobial-derived 
Nod factors (Figure 1-4). Nod factors are small molecule 
lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs) (Oldroyd and Long, 2003, Limpens et al., 
2003). Structural variation in the rhizobia-derived Nod factor and variation in 
the plant-derived signal flavonoids enable species-specificity in nodulation. 
Perception of the Nod factors by the LysM receptors initiates the symbiosis 
signaling pathway that activates transcriptional responses controlling nodule 
organogenesis, rhizobial infection and formation of symbiosomes inside the 
nodules (Kouchi et al., 2010).  
Rhizobia enter the root through root hair cells. One of the earliest plant 
signaling events initiating symbiosis downstream of the symbiotic receptors is 
calcium oscillation (Ca2+ influx, immediately followed by Cl- and K+ effluxes). 
Calcium oscillation occur initially in the epidermal cells and later in the cortical 
cells (Oldroyd, 2013). These ion fluxes at the tip of root hair cells, trigger the 
deformation and curling of the root hair cell, forming structures known as 
shepherds crooks. The rhizobacterial colony is then entrapped inside this 
structure (Mortier et al., 2012b). In Medicago, doesnt make infections2 
(MtDMI2), which is a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK), and 
MtDMI1, which is a nuclear potassium channel, are both involved in initiating 
calcium spiking to activate nodulation. It has been hypothesised that the 
frequency of epidermal calcium spiking codes for microbe specificity (Oldroyd 
and Downie, 2008), since in response to rhizobia these calcium spikes are 
highly regular (Sieberer et al., 2009), whereas in response to arbuscular 
mycorrhizae they can be highly irregular (Chabaud et al., 2011). However, 
other studies show that the calcium spiking between different types of 
microbial interactions are indistinguishable and that differences in calcium 
spiking are a reflection of the stage of the establishment of the symbiosis 
(Sieberer et al., 2012). The calcium spiking results in the activation of 
Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK), or DMI3 in 
Medicago, and its interacting protein IPD3, triggering the expression of the 
TFs NSP1, NSP2, ERN1 and NIN. These TFs activate the early nodulation 
(ENOD) genes that initiate the infection (Kosuta et al., 2008, Mortier et al., 
2012b, Oldroyd, 2013) (Figure 1-4).

Figure 1-4: Overview of (A) nodulation, and (B) LR development in 
response to N. Rhizobia-derived small molecules are perceived by 
LysM receptors on the epidermal plasma membrane. Expression of NF 
signalling pathway leads to activation of calcium spiking in the nucleus 
and gene regulatory signalling between cell types that trigger nodule 
establishment in the inner cortex. LR primordia develop in the pericycle, 
regulated by signalling downstream of NRTs, transcriptional regulation 
and auxin signalling.  
 The encapsulated rhizobia divide multiple times and form a 
microcolony. It then enters the root and developing nodule through invasive 
structures, the infection threads that initiate at the site of the root hair curl and 
crosses the cortex to enter the developing nodule primordium. Prior to this, 
cortical cells dedifferentiate and divide to form the nodule primordia. Cytokinin 
signaling is one of the key components of nodule primordia formation (Crespi 
and Frugier, 2008, Frugier et al., 2008) and occurs downstream the NF 
signaling. In the epidermis, and downstream of DMI3, a mobile signal is 
generated and translocated to the cortex. This signal is perceived by cytokinin 
receptor CRE1. TFs ERN1, NSP2 and NIN are activated by signaling through 
response regulators inducing the expression of ENODs that induce cell 
division in the cortex (Gonzalez-Rizzo et al., 2006, Lohar et al., 2006, Oldroyd 
et al., 2011, Plet et al., 2011, Mortier et al., 2012b) (Figure 1-4). In 
indeterminate nodules such as in Medicago that have a tip-growing meristem, 
the nodules originate from inner cortex (nodule meristem). In the inner cortex 
and in the site of nodule initiation, rhizobia induce a local accumulation of 
auxin by inhibition of polar auxin transport below the infection site. Local 
inhibition of polar auxin transport downstream of MtCRE1 contributes to the 
development of nodule primordia. MtCRE1 is necessary for the inhibition of 
the polar auxin transport, but it is still unknown if NSP2, ERN1 and NIN are 
also required for the inhibition of polar auxin transport (Plet et al., 2011, 
Mortier et al., 2012b).  
The rhizobia are released inside the nodule primordia and through an 
endocytosis-like process, enter the cells. There they are surrounded by a 
plant-derived membrane and form the symbiosomes (nodule infection zone). 
Inside the symbiosomes they differentiate into bacteroids, which use a 
nitrogenase complex to fix atmospheric N2 into ammonia (nodule fixation 
zone). The ammonia is then provided to the plant in exchange for 
carbohydrates (Jones et al., 2007, Mortier et al., 2012b). 
1.2.3 Endogenous and external pathways controlling the extent of 
nodulation in legumes 
Several regulatory controls exist to balance photosynthate and N 
exchange, in order to optimise whole plant growth and the ability of the root 
system to produce LRs for the acquisition of other nutrients. Nodule 
development is a costly process for the plant and C requirements are higher 
for N2 fixation than for N assimilation . Thus, the overall tendency is towards 
using other sources of N such as nitrate and ammonium. At high 
concentrations of nitrate, total N uptake increases and nitrogenase activity 
decreases, which results in decrease of nodulation and N2 fixation . Thus, 
plants are able to redirect C to root growth. N limitation stimulates nodule 
initiation and growth, which is followed by formation of new nodules if N 
starvation continues. Nodulation is regulated by different mechanisms 
according to the environmental condition of the plant.   
Ethylene and ABA negatively regulate the number of nodules by 
affecting the calcium oscillation (Mortier et al., 2012b). The local ethylene-
signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of Nod factor signaling and 
controls the number of nodules by impacting calcium spiking and restricting 
the infection (Gresshoff et al., 2009, Lohar et al., 2009). This inhibits root hair 
curling, reduces the calcium oscillation period, inhibits the bacterial infection 
and thus represses the expression of ENODs (Oldroyd et al., 2001). 
Consequentially, mutants impaired in ethylene sensitivity genes, such as the 
M. truncatula ethylene-insensitive hypernodulating mutant sickle (skl), which 
has a defect in the orthologous gene of A. thaliana ethylene-insensitive2 
(EIN2) (Penmetsa and Cook, 1997, Varma Penmetsa et al., 2008), show an 
increased number of nodules. ABA is a negative regulator of nodule number 
in M. truncatula and L. japonicus (Ding et al., 2008, Biswas et al., 2009). At 
the early stages of nodulation, ABA reduces the nodule number by affecting 
calcium spiking in the NF signaling pathway, and at the later stage of 
nodulation, it suppresses cytokinin dependent nodule organogenesis (Ding et 
al., 2008).   
Aside from local mechanisms controlling the number of nodules, the 
major pathway governing nodule number is Autoregulation of Nodulation 
(AON). Split root experiments show that this is a long distance signaling 
mechanism involved in the systemic inhibition of nodulation that is generated 
after root hair curling and prior to N fixation and initiation of visible cell division 
in cortex and pericycle (Suzuki et al., 2008, Li et al., 2009). After the activation 
of the cytokinin signaling, AON signaling is activated in the cortex affecting 
nodule primordia development. The number, activity and developmental stage 
of the nodules are factors governing the strength of AON (Mortier et al., 
2012b). Studies on AON in pea have shown that AON could be activated in 
several nodule developmental stages (Li et al., 2009).  
Nodulation related CLAVATA3/embryo-surrounding region (CLE) 
peptides, produced during nodule primordium formation and the nodule 
meristem development, are involved in the activation of AON, regulating the 
balance between cell division and differentiation (Mortier et al., 2010). In the 
AON pathway, along with the first nodule initiation and cell divisions in the 
roots, a long distance signal between root and shoot is initiated that is known 
as the Q signal. The Q signal is perceived in the shoot by a Leu-rich repeat 
receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK). The shoot LRR-RLK is required for AON and 
is responsible for the systemic regulation of nodule number and density. It is 
similar to Arabidopsis CLAVATA1 (CLV1) and is encoded by MtSUNN (Super 
numeric nodules) in M. truncatula (Schnabel et al., 2005), GmNARK (Nodule 
Autoregulation Receptor Kinase) in Glycine max (Searle et al., 2003), LjHAR1 
(hypernodulation aberrant root formation) in L. japonicus (Krusell et al., 2002, 
Nishimura et al., 2002) and PsSYM29 in pea (Krusell et al., 2002), suggesting 
a conserved AON mechanism across legumes. The nature of the Q signal is 
unknown but it is thought to be a CLE peptide (Reid et al., 2011a), and may 
be transported through the xylem (Okamoto et al., 2009, Mortier et al., 2010, 
Lim et al., 2011, Mortier et al., 2012a). Phylogenetic similarity between CLV1-
like RLK receptors and putative peptide receptors such as CLV1, which are 
able to perceive CLE peptides, suggests that the Q signal may be a CLE 
peptide (Mortier et al., 2012b) and references within). Studies on Glycine max 
have identified three different CLE peptides that are induced in response to 
rhizobial NF (RC1 and RC2) or nitrate (NCI) treatment in a NARK (Nodule 
Autoregulation Receptor Kinase) dependent manner (Reid et al., 2011a). 
GmRC1 is induced during initial signaling and cell division and has an 
expression pattern similar to MtCLE13 and LjCLE-RS1/2 (Okamoto et al., 
2009, Mortier et al., 2010, Reid et al., 2011a). The expression of GmRC2, 
which is similar to MtCLE12, is upregulated at a later stage of nodule 
organogenesis and is associated with the emergence of more mature 
nodules, probably during the initiation of nodule meristem or in response to N 
fixation (Mortier et al., 2010, Reid et al., 2011a). In GmNARK mutants, over 
expression of RIC1 and RIC2 results in the complete inhibition of nodulation. 
Thus these CLE peptides may be acting as the Q signal in the AON pathway 
through NARK (Reid et al., 2011a).    
The CLV1-like RLK expressed in the shoot, receives the Q signal and 
produces the Shoot Derived Inhibitor (SDI) signal. The identity of SDI is still 
unknown, but studies have shown that it is a small compound (<1 kDa), that is 
not a protein or RNA (Lin et al., 2010). This signal is transferred through the 
phloem to the root and inhibits cell division and the formation of any new 
nodules (Figure 1-5).  
Crosstalk between AON and nitrate-regulation of nodulation is evident 
from the role of NARK and its orthologs in this regulation and the importance 
of CLEs in each. This is more directly evident in examples such as the nitrate 
tolerant symbiotic mutants of Glycine max (nts) and AON mutants that also 
exhibit a supernodulation phenotype at high nitrate levels. In L. japonicus, 
LjCLE-RS2 responds to both nitrate treatment and rhizobia inoculation and 
systemically induces regulation of nodulation when overexpressed (Okamoto 
et al., 2009). In Glycine max, the N-Induced CLE peptide, NIC1, is induced 
locally in the root in response to nitrate and is involved in the local inhibition of 
nodulation in a NARK dependent manner (Reid et al., 2011a). Local and 
systemic regulation of nodulation is affected in GmNARK mutants

Figure 1-5: A model for control of nodule number in legumes. The 
number of nodules is regulated through both local and systemic 
regulatory pathways. (a) Auto regulation of nodulation (AON) pathway is 
a systemic pathway, which is activated at early steps of nodulation. The 
exact identity of the components of this signaling pathway is still 
unknown but evidence so far suggests that a long distance signal (Q), 
most likely a CLV3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) peptide 
is transferred from root to shoot and is perceived by the shoot LRR-RLK, 
NARK in pea. A Shoot Derived Inhibitor (SDI) signal is then transferred 
from shoot to root to inhibit nodulation. (b) In parallel, a local signaling 
pathway inhibits nodulation under high N concentrations. This signal 
may be a N-induced CLE1 (NIC1), which is perceived by the root NARK 
that in turn sends a second signal, the SDI-like nitrate induced inhibitor 
(NII) to inhibit further nodulation. Cytokinin signaling interacts with AON 
to control the number of nodules.  
(Reid et al., 2011b). This indicates that in G. max this gene may be common 
to both systemic (AON) and local (nitrate induced) regulation of nodulation. 
Grafting experiments have shown that NIC1 is perceived by root-localised 
NARK during the local regulation of nodulation in roots by nitrate (Reid et al., 
2011a). A SDI-like nitrate induced inhibitor (NII) is then produced, which 
inhibits the formation of nodules (Figure 1-5). In L. japonicus LjHAR1 
(hypernodulation aberrant root formation) mutants, lacking the ability to 
recognize the LjCLE-RS2 peptides in the presence of nitrate, could explain 
the reason for nitrate tolerance in these plants (Okamoto et al., 2009).  
Cytokinin signaling is well established in regulating nodule 
organogenesis (Plet et al., 2011, Heckmann et al., 2011). More recently 
several studies have shown that there is a correlation between cytokinin 
signaling and AON (Mortier et al., 2010, Mortier et al., 2012a, Saur et al., 
2011, Takahara et al., 2013). More directly, Too much love (TML) may act 
downstream of the cytokinin receptor LHK1/CRE1 and thus the F-box protein 
TML may be one of the first components in AON to regulate the number of 
nodules (Takahara et al., 2013).  
1.3 Impact of reducing N requirements for crops 
Our society faces a major challenge in meeting the demands of an 
expanding and developing global population. According to the latest world 
population report from the United Nations (2012), the global population is 
estimated to reach 9.6 billion by 2050. In combination with the changes in 
environmental conditions such as water availability created by the climate 
change due to emission of greenhouse gases that cause a temperature rise, 
there are massive implications for the ability to deliver food security. Higher 
temperatures could have serious effects on agriculture by reducing crop yield. 
Analysis of detailed modeling of crop growth under climate change by 
simulating future climate conditions suggests that agriculture and human well-
being will be negatively affected by climate change (Nelson, 2009). 
In the UK, The Global Food Security Program 
(http://www.foodsecurity.ac.uk/programme/about-the-programme.html) is to 
provide the growing global population with sustainable food supplies using 
less land and resources. In accordance with the global security food program 
it is important to discover new ways and technologies to provide sustainable 
food supply. Having a better understanding of the ways that plants respond to 
stress could help us manage and improve crop productivity. 
As one of the main mineral nutrients required by plants to complete their 
life cycles, the availability of N is central to global food security. The 
unreactive N2 is abundant and makes up to 80% of the earth atmosphere 
(Sanhueza, 1982) but the reactive oxygen compounds (including oxidized and 
reduced N compounds, such as nitric acid, ammonia, nitrates, ammonium and 
organic N compounds) that are usable by plants and animals are generally 
scarce in the natural environment. This is a key constraint making it 
impossible to provide food for the increasing world population only relying on 
the N natural cycle. That is why this population is highly dependent on the 
application of nitrogenous fertilizers, manufactured through the Haber-Bosch 
process (Marschner, 1996). Although use of fertilizers enables increased plant 
productivity, agricultural use of nitrogenous fertilizers has significant 
environmental and economic consequences and we cannot afford to use 
them at the level we are currently using. Nitrate in fertilizers are washed off 
into watercourses or leached through soil into groundwater polluting the 
waters. This affects natural habitats and human health. Emissions of 
ammonia and nitrous oxide to the atmosphere have serious impacts on 
biodiversity and climate change. Application of nitrate fertilizers is currently a 
major driver in agricultural energy consumption and production costs. 
Production of inorganic fertilizers such as N fertilizer accounts for 1.2% of the 
world energy usage (Swaminathan and Sukalac, 2004). Prices for these 
fertilizers will continue to grow as energy prices increase. Excessive usage of 
nitrate fertilizers by the farmers is a major source of carbon dioxide emission 
from agriculture (about 50%) and contributes to emission of greenhouse 
gases.   
Understanding how plants manage and balance interactions with 
different microorganisms is more important than ever in this new era of 
attempting to transfer the ability to nodulate into non-legume species such as 
rice and wheat. This could be one of the ways for breaking our dependency 
on costly N fertilizers. If we can better understand the regulatory genes that 
control nodulation, and identify orthologous genes that could potentially 
control symbiosis in non-legumes we could inform new strategies for plant 
development. However, to ensure that this approach is successful we need to 
understand how nodulation affects development of other root organs such as 
LRs that are needed to take other limiting nutrients such as phosphorus. This 
is key since plants need to balance the resources required to form organs 
against the payback from nutrient uptake. 
1.4 Aim and Objectives 
This study tried to investigate the balance between LR formation and 
nodule development, and the interaction with N availability in M. truncatula. 
This was done by studying phenotypic and gene expression changes in root 
under low and high N concentration and in response to rhizobial inoculation. 
The ultimate goal of this study was to investigate these gene expression 
changes at root tissue level, in pericycle and cortex. This study aimed to: 
Chapter 3: Phenotypic crosstalk between nodulation and LR 
development  
Using Medicago as a suitable legume model plant because of its ability 
to form nodules and its available genetic resources, phenotypic analysis of 
RSA was carried out. The number of nodules and key root parameters were 
measured to quantify the effect of N availability, presence of rhizobia and the 
ability to nodulate. Four Medicago truncatula ecotypes were analysed to 
identify consistent regulatory effects in Medicago.  
Chapter 4: Expression analysis to identify genetic control of 
developmental crosstalk  
Whole genome expression profiling using microarrays was carried out to 
answer key questions about the plant behavior through N and rhizobia at early 
hours after treatment with high NH4NO3. Early responses to NH4NO3 were 
studies 2 and 6 h post treatment with high NH4NO3 (5 mM) in rhizobia 
inoculated and mock inoculated A17 (here known as the wild type) plants 
grown at low NH4NO3 (0.1 mM) concentration. Gene expression changes of 
whole root samples were studied to identify genes involved in early responses 
(2 and 6 h) to NH4NO3 treatment in the presence and absence of rhizobia. 
Since nodules are initiated in the cortex and LRs in pericycle, transgenic 
plants expressing GFP in pericycle or cortex were generated to study gene 
expression changes at cell-specific level.  
Phenotypic studies on root architecture changes under low and high 
NH4NO3 concentrations showed that at high NH4NO3 presence of rhizobia 
affected root growth. Thus the effect of rhizobia under high or low NH4NO3 
treatment on rhizobia inoculated samples grown at high NH4NO3 was studied 
to identify significantly affected genes.   
Chapter 5: Analysis of hypernodulation mutant sunn-1 implicates 
balancing genes to regulate LR development 
M. truncatula A17 and its hypernodulating mutant sunn-1 that is impaired 
in the long distance AON-related shoot signaling controlling the number of 
nodules, show opposite root phenotypes in responses to N and rhizobia. Thus 
they were used as model plants to see how A17 and sunn-1 were affected by 
the presence of rhizobia and how they responded to NH4NO3. For this 
genome expression changes 6 h post treatment with low or high NH4NO3 was 
studied in whole root samples of rhizobia inoculated or mock-inoculated plants 
grown at low NH4NO3. This experiment enabled to identify some of the genes 
affected by rhizobia at low or high NH4NO3 and also the effect of low and high 
NH4NO3 in the presence or absence of rhizobia on gene expression in A17 
and sunn-1 backgrounds. It also identified the genes that were affected by 
SUNN in the presence or absence of rhizobia under low or high NH4NO3 
treatment. The genes showing significant expression changes under these 
conditions could be also some of the genes involved in AON and the balance 
between LR and nodule development. To have a better understanding of how 
these genes are controlled promoters of genes for transcriptional motifs were 
studied.  
Impact of this PhD thesis  
The phenotypic and transcriptomic data generated from this study was 
integrated together to develop a systems-level understanding of N use 
efficiency in Medicago. The data gathered from this project could be used to 
develop new tools, technologies and materials to improve N resource-use 
efficiency in plants and address one critical aspect of food security.

Materials and Methods 
2.1 Plant material  
Seeds were of Medicago truncatula cv. Jemalong line A17 (sequenced 
reference accession, denoted here as wild type) and available Medicago 
truncatula accessions from the IGER seed bank (Aberystwyth, 
http://www.igergru.ibers.aber.ac.uk) M. truncatula cv. Jemalong 2HA, M. 
truncatula ssp. tribuloides, M. truncatula Gaertner, M. truncatula var. 
longispina. Also the A17 background hypernodulating mutant sunn-1 (super 
numeric nodules) (Schnabel et al., 2005) that was kindly provided by Giles 
Oldroyd (John Innes Centre). 
2.2 Plant growth 
2.2.1 Germination of Medicago seeds 
2.2.1.1 Seed extraction from pods 
Seedpods were placed on a corrugated rubber mat and a plasterer's 
hawk with handle was used to crush them with a circular movement, releasing 
seeds between the corrugations and protecting them from damage. 
2.2.1.2 Scarification 
Seeds were scarified either mechanically or chemically depending on 
the quantity of the seeds. 
Mechanical scarification was used for small quantities of seed (n<50). In 
this method seeds were rubbed gently between sheets of fine graded sand 
paper until there were visible signs of scratches, indicating scarification.  
Chemical scarification was used for larger quantities of seed (n>50). 
Seeds were incubated in concentrated H2SO4 in a 50 mL plastic centrifuge 
bottle on a shaker (150 rpm) for about 8 min. Appearance of black colouration 
on the seeds was a sign of scarification. Excess H2SO4 was removed using a 
pipette and seeds were rinsed (3-4 times) with sterile water.  
2.2.1.3 Surface sterilization 
Seeds were incubated in 50:50 (v:v) bleach:water (3% sodium 
hypochlorite) and agitated intermittently for 3 min, then rinsed in sterile water 
for 4 times each time 2 min. 
2.2.1.4 Seed germination  
Sterile seeds were sown on 1.5% agar in sterile 9 cm single vent petri 
dishes  (Greiner Bio-one) sealed using 1.25 cm x 9.1 m microporous tape 
(3MTM MicroporeTM) and imbibed for 1 day in dark at 4C for optimal 
synchronization of germination. In the cases were seed dormancy had to be 
broken, similar cold treatment was applied to the seeds for 3 days. Seeds 
were then incubated inverted (to promote straight radicles) in a growth 
chamber of 25C under fluorescent lights (16/8 hr light/dark photoperiod) for 5 
days.   
2.2.2 Growth on pouch paper overlays on agar growth medium plates  
Changes in Medicago root architecture in response to external nitrate 
concentrations and rhizobial inoculation, were determined using growth 
pouches (CYGTM Germination Pouch, West St. Paul, MN, United States) 
overlaid on agar containing modified Fahreus medium (Vincent, 1970). The 
modified N-free Fahreus medium contained the following macronutrients (0.5 
mM MgSO4.7H2O, 0.7 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM Ferric citrate, 0.4 mM 
Na2HPO4.2H2O and 0.9 mM CaCl2) and micronutrients (MnSO4, CuSO4, 
ZnCl2, H3BO3 and Na2MoO4 each 1 mg mL-1). N was added as NH4NO3 at 
varying rates depending on the experiment (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 
1, 1.5, 2, 5, 10, 15 or 20 mM). The pH was adjusted to 6.5 using KOH and 
1.5% (w:v) agar was added before sterilization by autoclaving. After 
autoclaving, 0.075 M (S)-trans-2-Amino-4-(2-aminoethoxy)-3-butenoic acid 
hydrochloride (AVG) was added to the cooled (around 60C) medium. The 
medium was then poured into sterile square Petri dishes (120 mm  120 mm 
x 17 mm) with vents (Greiner Bio-one). AVG is an ethylene inhibitor (Peters 
and Crist-Estes, 1989) and it is needed for enhancing nodulation in the 
hypernodulating mutant sunn-1. To make the experiments comparable AVG 
was added to the growth medium in all experiments.  
Growth pouches were cut in the shape of the plates and autoclaved 
before soaking them in liquid modified Fahreus medium (same as above but 
without agar) and placed on to the modified Fahreus agar plates (Figure 2-
1). In sterile conditions, 6-7 germinated seedlings were transplanted between 
two layers of growth pouch in each plate and the plates were sealed using 
1.25 cm x 9.1 m microporous tape (3MTM MicroporeTM). Plates were placed 
into black plastic bags so that only the roots were covered (for decreasing 
light exposure and mimicking soil conditions) and grown vertically in the 
growth chamber (25C, 16/8 hr light/dark) for 4 days. Seedlings were then 
inoculated with Sinorhizobium meliloti (as in 2.3.1.3) or mock inoculated using 
liquid modified Fahreus medium, and then incubated in the growth chamber 
for 14 days. 
2.3 Treatments 
2.3.1 Rhizobial inoculation and nodulation

would be placed between two layers of growth pouch (top layer not 
shown in the image) on modified Fahreus medium. The image shows 
14-day mock-inoculated seedlings of A17 grown at low NH4NO3 .  
2.3.1.1 Growing the rhizobia 
S. meliloti was cultured on agar TY/Ca2+ medium (Journet et al., 2006). 
This medium was prepared by adding 5 g l-1 Bacto-tryptone, 3 g l-1 Yeast 
extract and 1.2% (w:v) bacterial agar into sterile deionized water. The medium 
was then autoclaved and 6mM CaCl2 was added to the cooled (around 60C) 
medium. Rhizobia was streaked out onto the solid medium and incubated for 
3-4 days at 28C. 
2.3.1.2 Preparing rhizobial solution for inoculation 
Rhizobial solution for inoculation was prepared by inoculating 50 ml of 
liquid TY/Ca2+ medium with a subculture of S. meliloti or Agrobacteria 
tumefaciens (for plant transformation) and incubated for 26 hr at 28C while 
shaking at 220 rpm to an OD600 of 1-2. Cells were then harvested by 
centrifugation (4000 rpm, 10 min, 4C) and re-suspended in 40 ml liquid 
modified Fahreus medium (supplemented with the same concentration of 
NH4NO3 as the modified Fahreus agar medium) or liquid TY/Ca2+ medium in 
the case of plant transformation to a final OD600 of 0.8 (Zhou et al., 2004). 
2.3.1.3 Inoculating roots with S. meliloti 
At dawn in the light/dark plant growth chamber cycle, plants were 
removed from the growth chamber and 2 mL of rhizobial solution was added 
evenly to the roots of the seedlings under sterile conditions. Mock inoculation 
was also carried out in the same way, using 2 mL of sterile medium. Roots 
were then covered again with the growth pouch layer and the plates sealed 
with micropore tape and placed back into the growth chamber for 14 days.   
2.3.2 Ammonium nitrate treatment 
Fourteen days post inoculation (dpi) roots were treated with 2 mL per 
plate of liquid modified Fahreus medium supplemented with NH4NO3 (low or 
high concentration depending on the experiments as explained in the 
following chapters) and with rhizobia inoculation or without (mock) inoculation. 
For subsequent microarray experiments, growth pouches with seedlings were 
infiltrated with the solutions for 5 seconds. In all cases, growth pouches with 
seedlings were placed on new plates of Fahreus agar medium 
supplemented with the same NH4NO3 concentration as the treatment. Treated 
plates were kept in the incubator for 2-6 hours (for the microarray 
experiments) or up to 16 days (for analysis of root architecture at the cellular 
level). 
2.4 Phenotyping root architecture and nodule development 
2.4.1 Quantifying root system architecture 
Plant roots were scanned using a flatbed scanner at highest resolution 
at 14 dpi and root attributes were measured (Figure 2-2) The number of LRs 
and nodules (for rhizobia inoculated seedlings) were counted and PR length 
and LR length was measured using ImageJ software (Schneider et al., 2012). 
Average of total LR length and average of LR length (sum of LR length 
/number of LRs per plant) was calculated from the ImageJ measurements. 
Total root size was expressed as the sum of PR and total LR length, and LR 
density as the number of LRs per cm of PR. An individual biological replicate 
consisted of measuring 6 seedlings on each plate and 2 plates.  
2.4.2 Data analysis 
Logarithmic transformation or square root transformation was used to 
normalize the data. The effect of different NH4NO3 concentrations and 
rhizobial inoculation between rhizobia inoculated and mock-inoculated 
samples were compared applying the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) 
statistical model using the Genstat software (VSNInternational, 2011).  
2.4.3 Measuring N in root and shoot 
Seedlings of A17 and sunn-1 were grown on Fahreus medium 
supplemented with low (0.1 mM) or high (5 mM) NH4NO3 and inoculated with 
rhizobia or mock-inoculated with liquid modified Fahreus medium 
supplemented with the same concentration of NH4NO3 as their growth 
condition. At 14 dpi, the seedlings were rinsed with sterile water to remove 
adhering nutrient solution and blot dried to remove excess moisture before 
measuring the fresh weights. The wet and dry weight of roots and shoots of 3 
biological replicates (consisting of 6 seedlings on each plate and 3 plates for 
each experiment, n=54) was measured using a four decimal place balance 
(Sartorius CP225D Dual Range Analytical Balance). They were then 
transferred to plastic tubes and oven dried (80C) for 3 days before dry 
weights of the samples were measured. 
Dry samples in three biological replicates were pooled together, milled to 
2 mm grading and prepared as follows for free NO3, total N and total P 
measurement. The samples were pooled together because sufficient dry 
samples were not available to carry out the mineral measurement assays thus 
the resulting data were not replicated.   
2.4.3.1 Measuring free nitrate in root and shoot  
Dried and ground root or shoot tissue was measured (0.1 g) on a four 
decimal place balance into 50 ml centrifuge tubes. Reverse osmotic water (25 
ml) was added to the samples and placed on a bottle shaker to shake (200 
rpm) for 30 min. They were then filtered through no. 1 filter paper into 
scintillation vials. Free nitrate was then measured using a flow injection 
analyser (Foss FiaStar System). The measurement values were multiplied by 
sample weight and divided by volume of extractant (25 mL) resulting in NO3 
concentration expressed as N. This was multiplied by NO3 molecular weight 
and divided by N molecular weight to determine the amount of NO3 in each 
sample.  
2.4.3.2 Measuring total N and P in shoot 
Sulphuric acid digest by the Kjeldahl method was used to measure total 
N and P in shoot. About 0.1 g of oven dried and ground shoot was weighed 
on a four decimal place balance into a digestion tube. Anti-bumping granules 
were added for smooth boiling. In the fume cupboard 2 mL digestion acid 
(sulphuric acid) was added and the tubes were covered with a polythene bag 
and left overnight. Then, 1 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide was added and 
tubes were loaded into a heating rack and heated using the Gerhardt 
digestion system. Tubes were left to cool down between the programs prior to 
adding a further 1 mL of hydrogen peroxide. The tubes were then allowed to 
cool and 48.6 ml reverse osmotic water was added and samples mixed well 
on a vortex. The samples were transferred to scintillation vials and analysed 
on the Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP).      
2.4.4 Analysing root architecture changes at the cellular level 
A17 seedlings were grown on plates containing modified Fahreus 
medium supplemented with low NH4NO3 (0.1 mM). The seedlings were 
rhizobial inoculated or mock inoculated. At 14 dpi they were treated with high 
or low NH4NO3 (Figure 3-7). At 0, 4, 8, 12, 16-day time points, roots of the 
seedlings in three replicates were stained (section 2.4.4.1) and viewed at 10X 
under differential interference contrast (DIC) using an Olympus BX51 
microscope.  
Nodule primordia and nodules were counted (Lohar et al., 2006) (Figure 
3-8) and the developmental timescale of LRs was measured using a 
comparison to defined LR development stages in M. truncatula (Herrbach et 
al., 2013) according to the following categories (Figure 3-6): (i) stage Ia to III 
LRP (Figure 3-6 A-D), (ii) stage IV to V LRP (Figure 3-6 E-F); (iii) emerging 
LRP (Figure 3-6 G) and (iv) fully emerged LR (Figure 3-6 H). Roots in class (i) 
and (ii) were scored as stage i and ii "initiating" LRP and roots in classes (iii) 
and (iv) were scored as "emerging" LRP and "emerged" LR respectively. LR 
length was measured using ImageJ. 
2.4.4.1 Root tissue staining 
Root tissue was incubated in 1% Periodic acid (10 g/L Periodic acid) for 
40 min at room temperature. They were then rinsed with water and incubated 
in Schiff reagent containing propidium iodide (100 mM Sodium metabisulphite, 
0.15 M HCl, 100 g mL-1 propidium iodide added fresh just before use) for 1-2 
hours at room temperature until tissue was visibly stained (pink). Samples 
were transferred onto microscope slides, covered with chloral hydrate solution 
(4 parts (w/v) chloral hydrate, 1 part (v/v) glycerol, 2 parts (v/v) deionised 
H2O) and incubated in a closed environment (to prevent drying out) at room 
temperature. Excess chloral hydrate solution was removed and samples were 
mounted in several drops of Hoyers medium (30 parts (w/v) gum arabic, 200 
parts (w/v) chloral hydrate, 16 parts (v/v) glycerol, 50 parts (v/v) deionised 
H2O) and covered with a cover slip. Slides were left undisturbed for 3 days 
allowing mounting solution to set (Truernit et al., 2008). 
2.5 Nucleic acid techniques 
2.5.1 DNA and RNA extraction 
2.5.1.1 Total RNA extraction from whole root tissue 
Whole roots from three independent biological replicates were cut using 
a sterile surgical blade and frozen in liquid N in 2 mL sterile microcentrifuge 
tubes. Samples were stored at -80C or RNA isolated immediately. Frozen 
roots were ground thoroughly in liquid N using an electric drill. The drill bit was 
first submerged in liquid N for 5 s and used for grinding the samples inside the 
liquid N-cooled microcentrifuge tubes. After root samples were completely 
crushed into powder, 450 L Buffer RLT (from the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini 
Kit) was immediately added and then samples were ground for another 10 
sec. They were then mixed by vortexing and kept on ice for the remainder of 
the procedure. 
Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit and 
eluted using RNase-free water all according to the manufacturer instructions. 
RNA was quantified using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 1000, 
NanoDrop Products, Wilmington, DE, USA). The Nanodrop stage was 
cleaned with 70% ethanol before and between loading of each 1.2 l sample. 
The spectrophotometer was set to measure RNA quantities against a blanked 
measurement of 1.2 l RNase-free water (from the Qiagen kit) and blanking 
was repeated after measuring every 10 samples.   
Total RNA samples were then treated with the TURBO DNA-free kit (Life 
Technologes) following the manufacturers instructions.   
2.5.1.1.1 Verifying lack of DNA contamination 
A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using tubulin as 
reference gene primer. The samples were then analysed using gel 
electrophoresis (detailed in 2.5.2) for lack of DNA contamination, compared to 
PCR products from a positive control reaction that used gDNA as template. 
2.5.1.2 Extraction of plant genomic DNA 
For fast extraction of DNA for PCR (Edwards et al., 1991), each leaf 
sample was freeze dried in liquid nitrogen and crushed into powder using an 
electric drill followed by addition of 400 L Edwards extraction buffer (200 mM 
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 25 mM EDTA, pH 8, 0.5% SDS). All steps 
were carried out at room temperature. Samples were vortexed and 
centrifuged at 5,600g for 1 min. 200-300 L of supernatant was transferred to 
a microcentrifuge tube and an equal amount of 100% isopropanol added. This 
was mixed and incubated at room temperature for 2 min prior to centrifuge at 
4,000g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet air dried at 
room temperature, before beingresuspended in 50-100 L sterile TE buffer 
(10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8). 
2.5.2 PCR and gel electrophoresis 
For polymerase chain reaction (PCR) a mastermix of 5 L 2x MyTaq red 
mix (Bioline Reagents Ltd, London, UK), 0.3 L dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), 
0.3 L of each primer (forward and reverse) and 3.7 L RNase free water was 
made and mixed by vortexing. 9.6 L of master mix was added to 0.4 L of 
RNA sample in 200 L tubes. Tubes were briefly vortexed and briefly

Table 21: Program for PCR  
centrifuged and placed in a thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA, USA). The thermocycler was set on a program as in Table 2-1.   
The samples were then analysed using agarose gel electrophoresis. 1% 
w/v agarose was mixed with 100 ml 1xTAE buffer (Tris base, acetic acid and 
EDTA, prepared from a 50x stock solution). The agarose was melted in a 
microwave oven by heating for 60 s and cooled prior to adding 3 l ethidium 
bromide (EtBr). This mixture was poured into a gel mould (Thistle Scientific, 
Glasgow, UK) with a toothed plastic comb. After the gel was set, the comb 
was removed and the gel was placed in a gel running tank (Thistle Scientific). 
1xTAE buffer was added to cover the gel and the PCR reactions (10 l) were 
pipetted into the wells alongside 2 l of 1Kb DNA HyperLadder I (Bioline). The 
gel was run for about 90 min at 100-120 V. The gel was viewed under 
ultraviolet light using a G:Box gel imaging system (Syngene International 
Limited, Biocon Limited, Bangalore, India). 
2.5.3 Synthesis of cDNA from RNA 
cDNA synthesis and amplification was carried out using the Ovation Pico 
WTA System (NuGEN Technologies Inc., San Carlos, CA, USA) following the 
manufacturers instructions. The cDNA was then purified using Qiagen 
Qiaquick PCR purification kit following the manufacturers instructions. The 
cDNA was quantified using a Nanodrop set to measure DNA quantities and 
260nm/280nm and 260nm/230nm measurements were recorded.  
2.5.4 Microarray experimental methods 
A Roche-Nimblegen (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Upper Bavaria, 
Germany) microarray platform was used to quantify transcript abundance in 
Medicago whole root samples. This platform used a 12x135k probe array with 
a custom design (OID36783) for the M. truncatula Mt3.5 genome; each of 
47,530 genes was measured with 2-3 unique 60mer oligonucleotide probes 
(total of 14,6171 probes) per gene.  
A 0.5 g sample of purified and amplified cDNA was amplified and 
labeled with Cy3 dye for single channel microarray analysis using the 
Nimblegen one-color DNA labeling kit according to the manufacturers 
instructions. After Nanodrop quantification, 4 g of the labeled cDNA was 
hybridized using the Nimblegen hybridization kit onto the array according to 
manufacturers instructions. Samples in 3 biological replicates and 3 technical 
replicates were randomized using a bioinformatic tool 
(http://www.randomizer.org/) prior to loading on the slides.   
The slides were scanned on a Nimblegen MS 200 microarray scanner 
using the Nimblegen MS 200 Data Collection Software. To measure the 
fluorescence intensities of the microarray, Cy3-labeled samples were excited 
using green laser (532 nm wavelength). To gain an overall overview of the 
microarray quality, a quick scan of 20 m resolution was performed, and if 
hybridization was confirmed then the slide was scanned at 2 m resolution. 
Scan and data collection were carried out as per manufacturers instructions. 
The data was collected as XYS files (raw probe level data by coordinates on 
the microarray), supplying the array coordinates (from the array design file) 
and observed intensities (x, y and signal).  
2.6 Statistical analysis of microarray data 
2.6.1 Normalization, quality control and summarization 
Microarray analysis was conducted in the R software environment (R 
Core Team, 2012). An annotation package associated with the array design 
was built by using the pdInfoBuilder package (Falcon et al., 2012) and the .ndf 
design file provided by the manufacturer. The XYS files were identified and 
imported into the R session using the Oligo package (Carvalho and Irizarry, 
2010). The quality of the data was checked by generating boxplots, smooth 
histograms and heatmaps of Pearson correlation coefficients between all 
arrays of the raw data; these were generated using the boxplot and hist 
methods from Oligo (Carvalho and Irizarry, 2010) package for R. For 
background adjustment, quantile normalization and summarization (to gene 
level by median polish), Robust Multi-Array Averaging (RMA) was performed 
using the Oligo package for R (Carvalho and Irizarry, 2010).  
2.6.2 Identifying differentially expressed genes 
The quality of the arrays was rechecked (using boxplots, smooth 
histograms and heatmaps). To identify differentially expressed genes, a GaGa 
model with a significance cutoff of P=0.05 (Russel, 2011) or moderated t-
statistic with a cutoff of P=0.001 in limma package for R (Smyth, 2004) was 
used. In the case of using the GaGa model, first different patterns comprising 
of all the possible comparisons between the treatments (in 3 or 2 technical 
replicates) were generated in R. These patterns were then used in the GaGa 
model to identify differentially expressed genes. Differentially expressed 
genes were clustered and fold changes of the log2 expression values were 
calculated for further analysis. 
2.6.3 Identifying clusters of differentially expressed genes  
Differential expressed genes were clustered using hierarchical clustering 
with an average linkage and Pearson correlation. Silhouette widths were 
plotted in MATLAB for each hierarchical tree and used to determine where to 
cut the trees and define clusters (MATLAB function for clustergram, MATLAB, 
The MathWorks http://www.mathworks.com). Heatmaps were generated with 
the heatmaps.2 function from gplots package (Warnes et al.) for R. Colors 
were set using the RColorBrewer (Neuwirth, 2007) package.   
2.6.4 Assigning differentially expressed genes to functional categories 
The MapMan software (version 3.5.1R2) (Thimm et al., 2004) was used 
to assign differentially expressed genes with FC > 2 or FC < -2 into functional 
categories defined by MapMan. This was done based on assessing 
similarities with Arabidopsis proteins (Thimm et al., 2004). Wilcoxon Rank 
Sum Test was used to predict functional categories (BINs) that show a 
different behaviour in terms of expression profile compared to all the other 
remaining BINs. 
2.6.5 Motif analysis 
MEME-LaB tool (Brown et al., 2013) was used to search for putative 
motif sequences within groups of co-expressed genes. The software 
compares the input datasets with 2 kb upstream promoter sequences of the 
genes. To generate this file genomic locations for all Medicago genes in the 
Mt 3.5v5 assembly was indexed against the entire Medicago genome 
sequence (Young et al., 2005, Cannon et al., 2006) and a FASTA file of 2 kb 
upstream promoter sequences for each gene was generated. This was then 
hard masked using the RepeatMasker software version 4.0 (Smit et al., 2010) 
that screens the sequences for interspersed repeats and low complexity 
sequences. The output is a modified version of the query sequence in which 
all the annotated repeats have been masked.  
MEME-LaB analysis was run for each dataset with different promoter 
maximum lengths (200, 500 and 1000 bp). Other parameters were set as: 
promoter minimum length = 100 bp, minimum motif width = 6 and maximum 
motif width = 12. MEME was run independently on each group and for each 
group of co-expressed genes MEME-LaB generated a max of 5 putative 
motifs.  
2.7 Generating Medicago transgenic lines expressing GFP  
Transgenic plants expressing GFP in pericycle or cortex were generated 
via callus Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated plant transformation from M. 
truncatula A17 as explained in (Zhou et al., 2004). Mature seeds were 
sterilized and placed on 100cm diameter x 25cm deep sized round Petri 
dishes containing germination medium (3.2 g L-1 Schenk and Hildebrandt 
(SH) basal salt mixture (Sigma), 1.01 g L-1 SH vitamin powder (Sigma), 20 g 
L-1 Sucrose, 1 mg L-1 6-Benzylaminopurine (BAP) in 0.8% agar (w/v), pH 5.8). 
Seeds (15 seeds per plate) were incubated for 4 days at 25 C under 
fluorescent light (16/8 h light/dark); this incubating condition was used in all 
the transformation steps. After 4 days each seedling was transected 1-2 mm 
below the cotyledons to remove the radicle and most of the hypocotyl. The 
remaining tissue was then bisected so that each explant had one cotyledon 
and half of the embryonic axis. Explants were inoculated with Agrobacterium 
tumefaciens carrying the pBGWFS7 vector in which each of four gene 
promoters (Medtr7g118460, Medtr4g018260, Medtr5g093170, 
Medtr8g121420) drove GFP expression. These genes were selected since 
they were found to be orthologous, based on a reciprocal best BLAST search, 
to cell type specific genes in Arabidopsis thaliana (Gifford, Unpublished 
results). Explants were immersed in the bacterial solution (prepared as 
described in section 2.3.1.2) and shaken gently for 30 min. They were blotted 
dry on filter paper to remove excess bacteria and placed adaxial side face-up 
on 100cm diameter x 25cm deep sized round Petri dishes containing co-
cultivation medium (3.2 g L-1 SH salts, 1.01 g L-1 SH vitamins, 20 g L-1sucrose, 
400 mg L-1 L-cysteine, 3 mM MES, 3 mg L-1 BAP, 0.1 mg L-1 NAA, 100 M 
acetosyringone and 1 mM DTT in 0.8% (w:v) agar, pH 5.5). Explants were 
incubated for 5 days then washed twice (10 min each) in sterile distilled water 
with shaking at 100 rpm and blotted on filter paper. They were then 
transferred to fresh 100cm diameter x 25cm deep sized round Petri dishes 
containing regeneration medium (3.2 g L-1 SH salts, 1.01 g L-1 SH vitamins, 
20 g L-1 sucrose, 3 mM MES, 1 mg mL-1 BAP, 1 mg mL-1 NAA, 10 mg mL-1 
AgNO3, 100 mg mL-1 cefotaxime and 500 mg mL-1 ticarcillin in 0.8% (w:v) 
agar, pH 5.8) and incubated for 15 days. Explants were then transferred to 
selection medium - regeneration medium supplemented with 1.6 mg L-1 
phosphinothricin (PPT). They were transferred to fresh medium every 2 
weeks and any explants not regenerating shoots were removed. Shoots 
developed from the explants were transferred to Phytatrays (Sigma-Aldrich) 
containing plant development and rooting medium (3.2 g L-1 SH salts, 1.01 g 
L-1 SH vitamins, 10 g L-1 sucrose, 0.5 mg mL-1 IBA, 100 mg mL-1 cefotaxime 
and 500 mg mL-1 ticarcillin in 0.25% (w:v) phytagel, pH 5.8). Plantlets with 
well-developed roots after 1 month were transplanted onto a soil mixture of 1 
part Levingtons F2s, 1 part Vermiculite plus Osmocote added at 3 gm per liter 
in the glasshouse regulated to 22 C with a 16/8 hr light/dark photoperiod. The 
pots were covered with plastic lids for 3-4 days to maintain high humidity. The 
plants were kept in the glasshouse for almost 3 months until most seedpods 
were developed. Then watering of the plants was stopped to induce 
completion of the set of mature seeds. Seedpods were harvested after they 
were fully dried and kept in paper bags at room temperature in laboratory 
conditions.  
The T1 plantlets from the seeds were tested for the insertion of GFP. For 
this nine seeds grown as in section 2.2. DNA from young leaflets (1 week old) 
was extracted (as in section 2.5.1.2) and PCR was performed to identify the 
presence of GFP in the plants. The primer used for control samples was: 
forward primer 5CACCAATCAAACTTCTTTTTTC and reverse primer 
5TGCTATTGCTAATGTGTTTCTC. GFP primers were: forward primer 
5CGCACCATCTTCTTCAAGGAC and reverse primer 
5AACTCCAGCAGGACCATGTGA. The GFP positive plants were transferred 
to soil and T2s were generated from them.

Results: Phenotypic crosstalk between 
nodulation and lateral root development 
Depending on the soil N concentration and form in the root environment, 
both rapid and inhibitory responses related to N uptake and assimilation is 
triggered in the plant. Inorganic and organic N have critical roles as signal 
molecules controlling genome-wide gene expression in response to N 
availability (Stitt, 1999, Redinbaugh and Campbell, 1991, Crawford, 1995). N 
acquisition is balanced through local and systemic signals that induce or 
repress LR formation according to the plant N and carbon status (Forde, 
2002, Salon et al., 2009, Dechorgnat et al., 2011). Rapid responses caused 
by local and systemic signals during N limitation result in nodulation and root 
architecture development and branching (Jeudy et al., 2010, Salon et al., 
2009). 
The three dimensional structure of the root known as the RSA comprises 
of PR, LRs and root hairs. RSA is a highly plastic trait. RSA is one of the first 
contacting point with N and it is under the influence of external N in its 
environment and the plant internal N status thus it could be modulated by 
promotion or inhibition of PR and LR growth in response to N. N effect on 
RSA depends on several factors such as N source (Patterson et al., 2010), 
concentration (Wang et al., 2007), tissue type (Wang et al., 2003), cell type 
(Gifford et al., 2008) and time after treatment (Krouk et al., 2010b).  
Phenotypic analysis of plant response to N in the presence of rhizobia 
was used to study the changes in root architecture when Medicago plants 
were subjected to a range of low and high NH4NO3 regimes as source of N 
and hence will be referred to here in this thesis as N. NH4NO3 was selected 
as N source based on similar experiments on Arabidopsis (Gifford,

more sufficient N source than NH4 or NO3 (Jeudy et al., 2010, Krouk et al., 
2006).  
3.1 Characterizing root architecture changes under low and high N 
concentrations and rhizobial inoculation 
To study how nodulation affects PR and LR development under limiting 
and excessive N concentrations, a series of phenotyping experiments were 
carried out on M. truncatula. Seedlings were inoculated with rhizobia (+Rhiz) 
or mock inoculated (-Rhiz) to see how the ability to nodulate or the presence 
and absence of rhizobia can affect RSA under low and high N availability 
(Figure 3-1). RSA was quantified at 14 dpi by measuring PR length, LR total 
length, average of LR length, LR number, LR density, total root size and 
nodule number (Figure 2-2). This time point was chosen based on preliminary 
experiments (Gifford, Unpublished results) and pervious studies (Jeudy et al., 
2010) showing that nodule development was more advanced at this point and 
a clearer comparison between -Rhiz and +Rhiz plants were possible. 
Each data set was then transformed as log10 (y + a) or  (y + a), where 
y was the raw data and a the min value in each data set and 0.5 for number 
of nodules. The transformation that approximately followed a normal 
distribution was selected for further analysis. This was done by plotting the 
histogram of residual values, normal plot and half normal plot using GenStat 
software (VSNInternational, 2011). REML (P<0.05) and the least significant 
difference (LSD) at 5% level were calculated for the effects showing 
significance (P<0.05) using GenStat. 
3.1.1 Response to N and rhizobia in different M. truncatula ecotypes 
In order to see if different Medicago genetic backgrounds show the 
same response trend to low and high N concentrations and rhizobia 
inoculation A17 and four other ecotypes of Medicago (cv. Jemalong 2HA, ssp. 
tribuloides, Gaertner and var. longispina) were grown at low (0.5 and 1 mM)

and high (2 and 10 mM) N concentration and inoculated or mock inoculated 
with rhizobia (Figure 3-1). The low and high concentrations of N were selected 
based on the N concentrations used at similar experiments on Medicago and 
Arabidopsis (Gifford, Unpublished results) and previous published studies 
(Jeudy et al., 2010). Samples were in 2 biological replicates (n=6 plant per 
replicate). Root attributes were measured at 14 dpi. REML analysis was used 
to identify significant (P<0.05) differences between mean values of the 
measured root attributes affected by the genotype, N concentrations and 
rhizobia. 
The study showed that the measured root attributes (PR length, average 
of LR length, LR total length, LR density, total root size, LR number and 
nodule number) were significantly (P<0.05) affected by N concentration and 
the interaction between genotype and N concentration (Table 3-1 and figure 
3-2). Genotype also had a significant effect on PR length, average of LR 
length, LR total length, total root size, LR number and nodule number. The 
interaction between genotype, N concentration and rhizobia significantly 
affected LR length (LR total length and average of LR length) and root total 
size (Table 3-1). Although the effect of genotype was significant (P<0.05), the 
aim of this experiment was to study the overall response trend of these 
genotypes to low and high N not to compare the response of individual 
genotypes with each other. The results suggests that -Rhiz and +Rhiz plants 
of A17 and the ecotypes used in this study showed a similar response trend to 
increasing concentrations N (Figure 3-3) irrespective of their individual 
differences regarding changes in root architecture. This could suggest that the 
N effect is conserved across ecotypes. Thus, further experiments were 
focused on A17 and the hypernodulating mutant, sunn-1.

written only where there is significance (P<0.05) between two 
consecutive N concentrations (N effect) or between -Rhiz and +Rhiz 
(rhizobia effect).  
A17 were grown at 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 
20 mM concentrations of N (Figure 3-1). At 14 dpi different root attributes of 2 
biological replicates (n=6 plant per replicate) were measured. The data was 
analysed using REML to identify the effects (N concentration and rhizobial 
treatment) that were significantly (P<0.05) effecting RSA changes.  
The results showed that N concentration had affected PR and LR 
development and nodule formation (Table 3-2). It significantly (P<0.05) 
affected all the measured root attributes (PR length, average of LR length, LR 
total length, LR density, total root size, LR number and nodule number) and 
rhizobial treatment had significant (P<0.05) effect on PR length and average 
of LR length (Table 3-2).  
N concentration affected the ability of the plants to nodulate. Nodule 
development decreased with the increase in N concentration (Figure 3-4 a 
and b). This N response is in agreement with previous studies (Streeter and 
Salrainen, 1988, Charon et al., 1999, Glyanko et al., 2009). Nodulation was 
observed in seedlings grown on concentrations of N from 0 to 2 mM and 
inhibited by high (starting from 5 mM) concentrations of N. A larger number of 
nodules were generally observed at the lower concentrations (0 to 0.5 mM) 
with the highest number of nodulation at 0.1 and 0.5 mM and then declined 
(Figure 3-4 a and b). The formation of new nodules is inhibited at high 
concentrations of N (Streeter, 1985, Thimm et al., 2004) and N fixation 
capacity of existing nodules is also affected by high N (Cabeza et al., 2014). 
As nodule development is a costly process for the plant , when NH4+ and NO3- 
are available, it is more favored by the plant to uptake these ions rather than 
use the costly produced N2 in the nodules (Silsbury et al., 1986, Wery et al., 
1986, Carroll et al., 1990). 
The interaction between N concentration and rhizobia inoculation had a 
significant (P<0.05) effect on PR length (Table 3-2). Low and high N 
concentrations in both -Rhiz and +Rhiz significantly (P<0.05) affected PR 
length (Figure 3-4 c and d). Although PRs are less sensitive to nitrate than 
LRs, studies shows that they could be affected by nitrate concentration 
(Forde, 2014, Vidal et al., 2013). Rhizobia also had a significant (P<0.05) 
effect on PR growth at low and high N concentrations (Figure 3-4 c and d). 
This study was also used for selecting low and high concentrations of N 
for further studies on the effect of low and high N concentration and rhizobia 
on root development and nodule formation. Plants grown on 1 to 0.5 mM of N 
produced a higher number of nodules. Since the results obtained from REML 
showed that there was no significant difference (P<0.05) between these 
concentrations (as the low range), hence 0.1 mM of N was chosen as the low 
N concentration treatment and 5 mM N, the concentration that nodulation was 
inhibited, as high N. These concentrations were also the same as the N 
concentrations used for studies on N response in Arabidopsis thaliana 
(Gifford, unpublished results) and selecting the similar concentrations made 
the comparison of the experiments possible. Thus unless mentioned 
otherwise, low and high concentrations of N are 0.1 and 5 mM respectively. 
3.1.2.1 Rhizobia effect on root development  
To study the effect of rhizobia at low (0.1 mM) and high (5 mM) N 
concentration on LR and PR development, mean values of -Rhiz and +Rhiz 
samples at 0.1 and 5 mM N were compared together using a two sample 
Students t-test at 5% significance level (Figure 3-5 e). The results from 
Students t-test were also confirmed by REML analysis of the data (results not 
shown). 
At low N Nodulation or the presence of rhizobia had no effect on LR 
development (Figure 3-5 e) and no significant difference was observed in the 
average of LR length, LR total length, LR number and LR density between -
Rhiz and +Rhiz (Figure 3-5 e). The results showed that rhizobia affected root 
development at high N concentration even though nodulation was inhibited. 
This was suggested because of the significant (P<0.05) effect of rhizobia on 
PR growth, LR total length, LR number and root total size (Figure 3-5). There 
is evidence that symbiotic organisms can affect LR development

PR= primary root and LR= lateral root.   
(Olh et al., 2005, Maillet et al., 2011). In Medicago, LR formation could be 
stimulated by Nod factors. This stimulation requires NFP, DMI1, DMI2, DMI3 
and NSP1 that are also involved in the symbiotic pathway (Olh et al., 2005). 
This suggests that nodulation or Nod factors could interfere with the root 
developmental programme. At high N, total root size was significantly 
(P<0.05) less in +Rhiz compared to -Rhiz due to significantly (P<0.05) shorter 
PRs (Figure 3-4 c) and significantly (P<0.05) smaller LR total length and 
number (Figure 3-5) compared to -Rhiz. Flavonoids that also act as signal 
molecules in the legume symbiosis pathway, could effect LR development. 
The accumulation of flavonoids decreases polar auxin transport leading to 
short LRs (Laffont et al., 2010). LR development is also regulated through 
local and systemic pathways depending on the plant N status (Remans et al., 
2006a, Desnos, 2008, Forde, 2014) including repression of root development 
by products of N assimilation (Gifford et al., 2008). In Arabidopsis low 
concentrations of glutamate (<50 mM) had an inhibitory effect on PR growth 
and stimulated LR outgrowth that resulted in shorter and more branched LRs 
(Forde, 2014). Studies on Arabidopsis also shows that PR growth could be 
inhibited by application of high (5 mM) nitrate which was associated with 
increase in auxin concentration at the root tip (Vidal et al., 2010).  
3.2 Studying the timescale of LR and nodule development 
The phenotypic analysis provided a long-term perspective of the 
timescale of LR development and nodulation. We were interested to see how 
N treatment and rhizobial inoculation changed the number of LRs and their 
stages of development and the timescale on which these changes occurred. 
Different stages of LR development and patterning have been studied in 
detail in Arabidopsis thaliana (Malamy and Benfey, 1997, Lucas et al., 2013, 
Pret et al., 2013). In a recent study using DR5:GUS and LaS-
CARECROW:GUS (LaSCR:GUS) marker genes cellular events of LR 
formation was studied in M. truncatula (Herrbach et al., 2013). In this study 7 
stages were defined for LR development (Figure 3-6). In the first stage (stage 
Ia) two or three pericycle cells go into anticlinal division (Figure 3-6 A). In 
stage Ib this anticlinal division in pericycle continues and at the same time 
endodermis cells start dividing anticlinally (Figure 3-6 B). The anticlinal 
division of endodermis continues in stage II and in the pericycle two layers are 
formed through periclinal division (Figure 3-6 C). Cells in pericycle and 
endodermis divide periclinally to form a four-layered pericycle and two-layered 
endodermis in stage III and cells in inner cortex also start anticlinal division 
(Figure 3-6 D). These divisions in pericycle, endodermis and inner cortex 
continues in stage IV (Figure 3-6 E). In this stage anticlinal divisions of the 
inner cortex forms the external part of LR primordia and proliferation of the 
parenchyma forms the future vasculature. In stage V LRP is expanded by cell 
proliferation in pericycle, endodermis and inner cortex layers (Figure 3-6 F). In 
stage VI LRP reaches the epidermis but has not merged from this cell layer 
(Figure 3-6 G) and in stage VII (Figure 3-6 H) the fully developed LR emerges 
from epidermis. Based on these developmental stages, the time scale of LR 
development under low and high N treatments and rhizobial inoculation was 
studied (Figure 3-7).  
Mock (-Rhiz) or rhizobia (+Rhiz) inoculated seedlings of A17 were grown 
at low (0.1) N concentration. At 14 dpi, -Rhiz and +Rhiz samples were treated 
with either low or high N and a group of -Rhiz was rhizobia inoculated and 
treated with low N (Figure 3-7). The samples were transferred to medium 
containing the same N concentration as treatment and roots in three 
replicates (n=3) were harvested at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16-day time points and 
viewed under the microscope. The data were then transformed using 
logarithmic or square root transformation (as explained in section 3.1) and 
analysed using REML to identify the effect of rhizobia at low and high N and 
the effect of rhizobia inoculation at low N over the 16-day time points (Figure 
3-6). 
Four stages were defined for LR development based on the stages 
identified by (Herrbach et al., 2013): stage i of initiating LRP (LRP i): stages I-
III (in Figure 3-6 A-D), stage ii of initiating LRP (LRP ii): stages IV-V (in Figure  
Figure 36: Developmental stages of lateral root formation in M. 
truncatula. (A) Stage Ia: Anticlinal divisions in the pericycle (black 
arrowheads). (B) Stage Ib: Anticlinal division in pericycle cells and 
epidermis (black arrowhead). (C) Stage II: A two-layer pericycle is 
formed through periclinal division (white arrowheads) and the 
endodermis continues its anticlinal division. (D) Stage III: Formation of a 
four-layered pericycle (white arrowheads) and two-layered endodermis 
(grey arrowhead) by periclinal divisions, and anticlinal divisions in the 
inner cortex (black arrowheads). (E) Stage IV: Divisions in the pericycle, 
endodermis and inner cortex continues. Anticlinal division of inner cortex 
forms the external part of LRP (black arrowhead) and proliferation of the 
parenchyma (arrow) forms the future vasculature. (F) Stage V: 
expansion of the LRP by pericycle, endodermis and inner cortex cells 
proliferation. The grey arrowhead shows periclinal divisions in the most 
external layer of the LRP. (G) Stage VI: LRP reaches the epidermis and 
is about to emerge. (H) Stage VII: Emergence of the LR. The arrow 
shows the central vasculature of the new root with many elongated cells. 
Bars = 100 m. (Herrbach et al., 2013)  
3-6 E-F), emerging LR: stage VI (in Figure 3-6 G), fully emerged LR: stage VII 
(in Figure 3-6 H). Nodule primordium, emerging nodule and fully developed 
nodule was defined as in (Kuppusamy et al., 2009) (Figure 3-8). In their study, 
Kuppusamy et al. (2009) reported that MtCDC16 was involved in controlling 
the number of LRs and nodules in M. truncatula. The expression of MtCDC16 
was activated in cell division zone in growing roots and nodules of M. 
truncatula (Kuppusamy et al., 2009). To study the expression pattern of 
MtCDC16 the putative promoter region of MtCDC16 was fused to a GUS 
reporter gene and the transcriptional activation of the reporter gene was 
monitored. In response to rhizobia, GUS expression was observed in nodule 
primordia, emerging nodules and finally was limited to the nodule meristem of 
the fully developed nodule (Figure 3-8) (Kuppusamy et al., 2009). 
REML analysis of -Rhiz and +Rhiz samples treated with low N (A-D in 
Figure 3-7) showed that rhizobia had no significant effect on different stages 
of LR development at low N (Table 3-3). A significant (P<0.05) rhizobia effect 
was observed in sample treated with high N (B-E in Figure 3-7) on early and 
late stages of LR development (LRP i and fully emerged LRs) (Table 3-3). 
The rhizobia effect on different stages of LR development at low and high N 
was consistent with the results obtained from section 3.1.2.1. Studying 
different stages of LR development over the 16-day period post treatment of -
Rhiz samples at low N with rhizobia (A-C in Figure 3-7) showed that rhizobia 
inoculation had significant (P<0.05) effect on the early stages of LR 
development (stages i and ii of LRP development) (Table 3-3).  
A two sample Students t-test at 5% significance level was used to 
compare the mean values of different LR developmental stages in -Rhiz with 
+Rhiz samples at low N (A and D in Figure 3-7), -Rhiz with +Rhiz at high N (B 
and E in Figure 3-7) and -Rhiz at low N with -Rhiz treated with rhizobia at low 
N (A and C in Figure 3-7) to identify the significant effect of rhizobia at these 
different conditions and over different time points (Figure 3-9). The results of 
the t-test analysis were also confirmed by the REML analysis (Table 3-3).

Rhizobia effect at low N? (A-D) 
At low N and in the absence of rhizobia (A in Figure 3-7) there was an 
initial increase in different stages of LR development (LRP i and ii, emerging 
and fully emerged LR) at 4-day time point, which was followed, by a 
decreasing trend at later time points (Figure 3-9 a). In response to N 
limitation, HATS is upregulated and LR development is stimulated. In WT 
plants of Arabidopsis when transferred from high to low nitrate concentration, 
the number of visible LRs increased under a moderate N limitation (transfer 
from 10 mM to low 1-0.5 mM) (Remans et al., 2006b). This response is 
followed by decrease in LR development that is controlled by local and 
systemic signaling pathways (Forde, 2014). In +Rhiz samples (D in Figure 3-
7) there was an initial increase in LR development (LRP i, emerging LR and 
fully emerged LR) and as the number of nodules (nodule primordia and fully 
developed nodule) increased, no significant changes were observed in the 
number of LRs at different stages (Figure 3-9 a). These results show that how 
the LR developmental response to N is regulated by the local and systemic 
pathways that act based on the plant N status. It also shows how N deprived 
plants balance LR development with nodule formation.  
To further study these responses, -Rhiz plants grown at low N condition 
were inoculated with rhizobia (C in Figure 3-7). The effect of nodulation or 
rhizobia was then studied on different stages of LR development at 0-16 days 
time points post inoculation. Rhizobia inoculation of plants showed that at 
early time points after inoculation where nodule primordia were forming, there 
was an increase in all stages of LR development (LRP i and ii, emerging and 
fully emerged LR) (Figure 3-9 c). At the early time points (4-8 days), the 
number of LRP i was significantly (P<0.05) less in +Rhiz compared to -Rhiz 
(Figure 3-9 c). This shows a rhizobia effect on LR development at the early 
stages. The number of LRs at different stages of development (LRP i and ii, 
emerging and fully emerged LR) decreased as the number of fully developed 
nodules increased (Figure 3-9 c) suggesting a balancing response between 
nodulation and LR development.

high N (B in Figure 3-7), there was an increasing trend in the number LRs in 
different stages of development (LRP i and ii, emerging and fully emerged LR) 
at the earlier time points that was followed by a decrease at the later time 
points (Figure 3-9 b). The decreasing trend at the later time points suggests a 
balancing response to high N according to the plant N status (Remans et al., 
2006a, Desnos, 2008, Forde, 2014, Gifford et al., 2008). Nitrate acts locally by 
promoting LR growth in different developmental stages. This is an adaptive 
response enabling plants to respond to local patches of high nitrate in the soil. 
In split agar plate experiments in Arabidopsis the side of the root exposed to 
high nitrate showed preferential LR growth. LRP emergence was increased 
and root elongation was stimulated (Bouguyon et al., 2012). Studies in 
Arabidopsis show that high nitrate concentration (> 10 mM) inhibits LR growth 
after their emergence from the PR by affecting the activation of the LRP 
meristem. This results in short LRs whose elongation is repressed (Zhang et 
al., 1999). In +Rhiz (E in Figure 3-7) the number of LRs in stage i of LRP 
development were significantly (P<0.05) less than -Rhiz suggesting a 
balancing effect for rhizobia at high N (Figure 3-9 b). The number of nodule 
primordia decreased significantly (P<0.05) 4 days after treatment with high N 
and at the later time points where the number of nodule primordia decreased; 
there was an increasing trend in different stages of LR development (Figure 3-
9 b). 
3.3 Conclusion 
The phenotypic study of root architecture changes in response to low 
(0.5 and 1 mM) and high (2 and 10 mM) N and rhizobia showed that this 
response was similar between A17 plants and the studied ecotypes (cv. 
Jemalong 2HA, ssp. tribuloides, Gaertner, longispina). In this study we also 
show that nodulation was inhibited at 5 mM and higher concentrations (up to 
20 mM) of NH4NO3 as the source of N.  
Studying the root architecture changes at low (0.1 mM) and high (5 mM) 
concentrations of N in -Rhiz and +Rhiz samples of A17 showed that the 
rhizobia effect on PR and LR length and number was not significant at low N. 
The time point study of nodule and LR development at cellular level also was 
consistent with this result showing that rhizobia had no significant (P<0.05) 
effect on different stages of LR development (LRP i, LRP ii, emerging and 
fully emerged LRs) 0-16 days post treatment with low N. In the presence of 
rhizobia at low N there was an initial increasing trend in the number of LRs at 
different developmental stages (LRP i, emerging LR and fully emerged LR) 
but at the later time points no significant changes were observed. This trend in 
LR development and the increase in the number of nodule primordia and fully 
developed nodules at the later time points suggests a balance between LR 
development and nodule formation.  
Studying the time scale of LR development and nodule formation 0-16 
days post rhizobia inoculation of -Rhiz plants grown at low N shows that 
rhizobia had a significant (P<0.05) effect on the early stages of LR 
development (LRP i and ii). The number of LRP in stages i and ii was 
significantly (P<0.05) less in +Rhiz compared to -Rhiz. Also the number of 
LRs in different developmental stages decreased as the number of nodule 
primordia and mature nodules increased at the later time points. These all 
shows that how LR development and nodule formation are balance at low N.     
Rhizobia significantly affected root development at high N even though 
at this concentration nodulation was inhibited. Total root size was significantly 
(P<0.05) less in the presence of rhizobia at high N. This was due to a 
significantly (P<0.05) shorter PR, smaller LR total length and less LR in 
number. High N treatment of N deprived plants also showed that rhizobia 
significantly (P<0.05) affected early and late stages of LR development (LRP i 
and fully emerged LRs). At early time points post treatment with high N there 
was an increasing trend in the number LRs in different stages of development 
(LRP i and ii, emerging and fully emerged LR) followed by a decrease at the 
later time points possibly caused by the signaling pathways involved in 
balancing LR development according to the plant N status. 
The data obtained from these experiments formed a basis for a better 
understanding of how LR development and nodule formation or inhibition 
were balanced under low and high N concentrations and rhizobia inoculation. 
The effect of N concentration on RSA was significant in the presence of 
rhizobia. This effect was most interesting at high N (5 mM) where in the 
presence of rhizobia total root size was smaller (Figure 4-1) due to shorter PR 
and less number of LRs (average of LR length was not significantly different 
between treatments). In order to associate these phenotypic responses to 
gene expression changes for controlling LR development and nodulation, 
whole genome profiling experiments using microarrays was performed. The 
experiments were designed to study early (2 and 6 h) N-regulated responses 
to high N in the whole root. The rhizobia-mediated responses to low and high 
N concentrations were also studied. This enabled to (1) identify genes 
showing the strongest N and/or rhizobia regulated expression changes, (2) 
studying the gene expression patterns in different gene clusters and (3) 
identify the main biological pathways responsible for N-regulated and 
rhizobia-mediated responses of LR and nodule development. Since these 
responses are highly tissue specific, we also aimed to study the balance 
between LR and nodule development at cell specific level. These studies will 
be discussed in detail in chapter 4.

Results: Expression analysis to identify genetic 
control of developmental crosstalk 
Phenotypic study of RSA in response to low and high N and rhizobia 
showed that at high N concentration nodulation stops; there is a significant 
(P<0.05) decrease in root development in +Rhiz (smaller root size due to 
shorter PR and LRs and decrease in LR number compared to -Rhiz). This 
could suggest a balancing effect for rhizobia on root architecture development 
at high N or (Figure 4-1). To identify genes controlling these phenotypic 
effects, microarray experiments were designed to study the early responses 
(2 and 6 h) to high N (5 mM NH4NO3) treatment in rhizobia inoculated (+Rhiz) 
and mock inoculated (-Rhiz) A17 seedlings grown at low N (0.1 mM) 
concentration (Figure 4-2 a). Seedlings of +Rhiz or -Rhiz were grown at low N 
for 14 days and then treated with high N for 2 and 6 h (C2, C6, R2 and R6 in 
Figure 4-2 a) or harvested directly after growth at low N (C0 and R0 in Figure 
4-2 a). In addition microarray experiments were designed to determine how 
gene expression changes when +Rhiz seedlings grown in high N were treated 
with low N (Figure 4-2 b). In this experiment +Rhiz A17 plants were grown on 
high N (5 mM) and at 14 dpi were treated with high (5 mM) or low N (0.1 mM) 
for 6 h (HH and HL respectively in Figure 4-2 b). The steps taken for 
analysing the microarray data and identifying significantly affected genes by 
rhizobia and N treatments are shown in Figure 4-2 c. 
4.1 Quality control and normalization of the microarray data 
Experimental conditions were selected to generate relevant data to 
answer specific biological questions about Rhizobial and N responses. 
Samples were prepared in 3 biological replicates and each biological replicate

N had no significant effect on PR and LR development in the presence

presence of rhizobia. High N inhibited nodulation but rhizobia presence 
affected root development resulting in smaller root size with shorter PR 
and less total LR length that was due to lower number of LRs (the 
average of LR length was not significantly difference between 
treatments).

for each biological replicate (n=9 plants). The labeled cDNA samples were 
assigned to the microarrays on random (using randomizer tool at 
randomizer.org) to avoid technical bias.  
To visualize the distribution of the data, i.e. XYS expression values that 
represented the coordinates of the probes on the microarrays (XY) and their 
intensity (S for signal), hist method and boxplot method were applied (Figure 
4-3) using the R functions boxplot and hist (Carvalho and Irizarry, 
2010). Both methods use the log2 values of the intensities and produce 
boxplots (Figure 4-3 a and c) or smoothed histograms (Figure 4-3 b and d) for 
each sample. To remove systematic variation from the expression data and 
render the measurements from different arrays inter-comparable, the robust 
multiarray average (RMA) algorithm was applied to the raw expression data 
(rma method in R). This algorithm performed background subtraction, quantile 
normalization and summarization via median polish (Carvalho, 2010).  
To confirm replicate reproducibility distribution of the normalised data 
was visualized by plotting box plots (Figure 4-4 a and d) and smooth 
histograms (Figure 4-4 b and e) then comparisons were performed between 
replicates and across the data set. The overall microarray expression levels of 
the RMA normalised data were compared against each other by calculating 
the Pearsons r correlation coefficients for each pairwise comparison using the 
R function cor. The correlations were plotted on heatmaps (Figure 4-4 c and 
f) using R function heatmap.2.  
The pair-wise comparisons of the microarrays for the early time points 
after treatment of -Rhiz and +Rhiz seedlings grown at low N with high N 
(Figure 4-2 a) showed that there was a strong correlation between microarray 
replicate sets indicated by predominant green coloration in the heatmap 
(Figure 4-4 c) for a row or column with correlation ranging between 0.75  r  
0.99 with average r = 0.94. Replicate 2 of +Rhiz samples treated with high N 
for 6 hr (R6-2) had the lowest correlation with the other replicates with an 
average correlation of r = 0.80 (Figure 4-4 c). Replicate 3 of +Rhiz samples

treated with high N for 6 hr (R6-3) showed the highest correlation with the 
other arrays with an average correlation of r = 0.96. Hence, R6-2 array was 
discarded from the analysis due to poor correlation with the other replicates 
and arrays, an indication of a poor quality array, most likely due to 
hybridization of that one array, since the RNA from that sample was found to 
be of good quality, and other biological sample arrays taken at the same time 
point had strong reproducibility. The poor quality of R6-2 was also evident in 
the normalised data plotted as boxplots and histogram in Figure 4-4 c.  
The visualization of the inter-array correlation (Figure 4-4 f) for the 
second microarray experiment that looked at the effect of low N treatment on 
+Rhiz plants grown at high N (Figure 4-2 b) showed that expression 
comparisons of the replicates and arrays were all strong with 0.98  r  0.99 
and an average of r = 0.99. This correlation heatmap and the normalised 
expression values plotted as boxplots and histogram all confirm the good 
quality of the data.  
4.2 Early responses to high N treatment in plants grown under low N in 
the presence or absence of rhizobia 
This microarray experiment was designed to study early events and 
gene expression changes after treatment of plants grown under N limitation 
(low N, 0.1 mM) with high N (5 mM) in -Rhiz and +Rhiz (Figure 4-2 a). Gene 
expression changes were studied at 0, 2 and 6 hours after treatment with high 
N to identify genes involved in mediating the early N responses in root and 
balancing nodule and LR development in high N conditions. The hypothesis 
was that genes involved in nitrate uptake and assimilation such as nitrate and 
ammonium transporter genes, cell wall genes involved in stimulation and 
suppression of nodule formation in the cortex, cytokinin biosynthetic genes 
and transport regulators, auxin transporters and response factors and 
transcriptional factors would be candidates for controlling the phenotypic 
responses (Figure 4-1). The 0, 2, and 6 hours time points were chosen 
according to the previous published data on the root N (Gifford et al., 2008) 
and nodulation (Lohar et al., 2006) response. Previous work has shown that a 
significant amount of N is acquired 2-4 h pt with similar levels of high nitrate 
(Cabeza et al., 2014), thus any transcriptomic changes triggered by N would 
reflect plant responses to N at these time points.  
4.2.1 Genes rapidly respond to N treatment in both nodulating and non-
nodulating Medicago plants  
Hierarchical models are suitable models for data with small number of 
replicates by allowing sharing information between units of information 
(genes). In this study the hierarchical GaGa algorithm (Rossell, 2009) was 
applied to identify differentially expressed genes. First the groups each 
sample belonged to were defined: Control/-Rhiz (C) C0, C2, C6, Rhizobium-
treated (R) R0, R2, R6, each in 3 replicates except for R6 in 2 replicates (as 
discussed in section 4.1); 0, 2, and 6 indicates hours after treatment with high 
N. Gene expression patterns (i.e. the desired hypothesis) were then 
generated for all combinations of patterns. For example, for three groups (or 
sample types) the patterns for gene expression (hypothesis) would be as 
follows, considering expression level in each group: 
Pattern 0 (null hypotheses): group 1 = group 2 = group 3 
Pattern 1 (alternative hypothesis): group 1  group 2 = group 3 
Pattern 2: group 1 = group 2  group 3 
Pattern 3: group 1  group 2  group 3 
All possible patterns of comparisons between treatments were 
generated (203 patterns) and the data was then fitted to a hierarchical 
Gamma-Gamma model. The posterior probability (similar to FDR) that a gene 
followed each expression pattern was then derived to obtain lists of 
differentially expressed genes.   
Elevated expression levels of genes involved in N acquisition and 
assimilation and root architecture changes (development of LRs and nodule 
formation) at early time points after treatment with high N in the seedlings that 
were grown under low N conditions suggests an initiation of local N responses 
to take up N following previous N deprivation. A total of 4793 genes were 
identified as differentially expressed with a significance cutoff of P<0.05. This 
represented 10% of the genes on the Nimblegen Mt3.5 custom expression 
array and 7.4% of the genes annotated in the M. truncatula 3.5 gene model. 
This parallels comparable transcriptomic studies on Arabidopsis showing that 
the expression of up to 10% of the genome is under the control of nitrate and 
N supply (Bouguyon et al., 2012). 
Around 3% of the differentially expressed genes were TFs some 
involved in stress responses, N responses, and LR and nodule development. 
Around 40% of the identified genes could be directly related to N responses 
(such as N assimilation and transport) or changes in root architecture (LR 
development and nodulation) and hormonal control of LR development and 
nodule formation. 
4.2.2 An overview of the gene expression patterns showing N response 
and rhizobia effect   
To study the expression patterns of the genes under the above 
conditions, differential expressed genes were clustered into 57 clusters 
(Figure 4-5). Clustering analysis revealed a range of different patterns of 
expression in response to this short-term high N treatment. The average 
expression level within each cluster that is plotted as a heatmap in Figure 4-5 
a shows the distinct clustering between -Rhiz and +Rhiz samples. The 
clustering also suggests that both +Rhiz and -Rhiz samples treated with high 
N at 2 and 6 h are showing a more similar response than the 0 h which was 
immediately after the N deprivation period (branches i and ii in figure 4-5 a). 
An overall view of the heatmap suggests that N response was stronger than 
rhizobia response and most clusters are responding to N treatment 
independent of presence or absence of rhizobia.  
As plotted in the heatmap, 5 main responses to rhizobia inoculation and 
N treatment (branches A-E in Figure 4-5 a) could be identified. Clusters in 
branches A, B and C show similar response to N treatment both in +Rhiz and 
-Rhiz, indicating that the response is independent of the rhizobia effect.  In 
clusters of branches B and C the gene expression level is different in +Rhiz 
and -Rhiz pt with high N. For example in cluster 11 (Figure 4-5 b) (149 genes) 
from branch B, -Rhiz and +Rhiz show similar response to N and gene 
expression level drops pt with high N both at 2 and 6-hour time points. 
Response to N could be suggested in this cluster as changes in expression 
levels of genes involved in N assimilation (such as amino acid permease and 
glutamate receptor). In addition the cluster includes genes involved in the 
biosynthesis of auxin, cytokinin and gibberellin and several members of the 
bHLH TF family, suggesting that N regulates hormone signaling, hormone 
metabolism and developmental processes. In branch C cluster 2 (Figure 4-5 
b) with 354 genes shows that early after treatment with high N, gene 
expression level changes in both -Rhiz and +Rhiz samples  this is therefore 
a Rhizobium-independent N response that is maintained at 2 and 6 hr, 
however the average of gene expression level in this cluster is higher in -Rhiz 
compared to +Rhiz. The presence of genes involved in LR development such 
as Medtr2g038450.1 Auxin efflux carrier component, Medtr4g076670.1 Cell 
division protein kinase, Medtr4g075380.1 Ethylene-responsive TF and 
Medtr5g080470.1 LOB domain-containing protein may suggest root 
architecture changes in response to N. Clusters in branch D mainly show 
rhizobia effects in response to N treatment and in branch E expression levels 
are different between +Rhiz and -Rhiz in response to N treatment.  
4.2.3 Identifying genes showing the strongest response to N treatment 
and rhizobia inoculation 
To study the responses plotted in Figure 4-5 a in more detail and to 
identify the genes that showed strong responses to high N treatment at 2 and 
6 h or/and were affected by rhizobia at low N (0 h) or high N treatment (2 and 
6 h), FC of the expression values of the differentially expressed genes were

Rhiz and +Rhiz samples 2 and 6 hours pt with high N; (2) The effect of 
rhizobia on the samples treated with high N for 2 and 6 hours; (3) The effect 
of rhizobia at 14 dpi on samples grown at low N. 
To study early responses to high N treatment, fold changes (FC) 
between C0 and C2, C0 and C6, C2 and C6, R0 and R2, R0 and R6, R2 and 
R6 were calculated. This enabled quantitative understanding of gene 
expression changes at 2, and 6 hr and between 2 to 6 hours after treatment 
with high N in -Rhiz and +Rhiz respectively (Tables 4-1 and 4-2 a). FC 
between C2 and R2 and also C6 and R6 showed the effect of rhizobia on 
gene expression in samples treated with high N after 2 and 6 hours 
respectively (Tables 4-1 and 4-2 b). FC between C0 and R0 showed changes 
in gene expression 14 days post inoculation with rhizobia, compared to plants 
grown at low N without rhizobia (Tables 4-1 and 4-2 b). 
In the next step patterns of differentially expressed genes in different 
biological pathways were analysed using the MapMan software to identify 
specific metabolic and molecular processes affected by rhizobia and/or N 
(Thimm et al., 2004). MapMan software uses the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test to 
predict functional categories (BINs) that show a different behaviour in terms of 
expression profile compared to all the other remaining BINs. To study early N 
responses, pathway analysis of all the major pathways (BINs) was performed 
by applying the Wilcoxon rank sum test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction 
(Thimm et al., 2004). Significantly different (P<0.05) functional pathways (bins 
and sub-bins) containing N-regulated (Table 4-3 a) and rhizobia regulated 
(Table 4-3 b) genes were selected and would be discussed below.  
The gene expression patterns of the amino acid metabolism, N 
metabolism and stress pathways show that -Rhiz samples had a slightly 
stronger response to high N compared to +Rhiz (Figure 4-6). Genes involved 
in N metabolism pathway were upregulated both in -Rhiz and +Rhiz samples 
after 2 and 6 hours pt. Genes involved in amino acid metabolism also showed

Figure 4-6: Gene expression responses to high N in three MapMan 
(Thimm et al., 2004) functional categories. The expression levels of 
upregulated (blue) and downregulated (red) genes are represented in 
BINs of gene function related to amino acid metabolism, N metabolism 
and stress pathways, determined using the International Medicago 
Genome Annotation Group (IMGAG) annotation.  Mock inoculated 
plants had a slightly stronger response to high N treatment compared 
to rhizobia inoculated plant responses to N.  
strong expression changes at these time points with the genes predominantly 
showing upregulation. Genes assigned to the stress category also showed 
strong response at 2 and 6-hour time points with the majority of genes being 
upregulated (Figure 4-6). These gene expression changes were not as strong 
between 2-6 hours. 
To identify the genes that showed the strongest expression changes 
under the experimental conditions, differentially expressed genes with FC >2 
or FC <-2 were selected as significant and considered for further analysis. 
Looking at the early responses to N (2, 6 and between 2-6 hours post pt) 
shows that in -Rhiz, 440 differentially expressed genes showed significant 
(FC>2 or FC<-2) response to high N at 2 h. This number of regulated genes 
was slightly higher (570 genes) at 6 h of which 55% of the genes were 
upregulated. Hence, the predominant effect was N-induction, particular at 2 h 
where 70% of genes were N-induced (Table 4-1). There was not a major gene 
expression change between 2 and 6 hours and only 57 differentially 
expressed genes showed strong response (FC>2 or FC<-2) to high N 
treatment with 68% of them being downregulated (Table 4-1). The number of 
differentially expressed genes showing strong N-regulated gene expression 
changes in +Rhiz was less than -Rhiz but showed almost the same trend in 
the number of genes being up or down regulated as -Rhiz (Table 4-1). Similar 
to -Rhiz, a higher percentage of genes were induced at 2 h (75%) compared 
to 6 h (52%). At 6-hour of N-treatment 298 differentially expressed gene 
showed strong response (FC>2 or FC<-2) to N treatment (52% upregulated). 
Between 2 and 6 hours 50 differentially expressed genes had strong (FC>2 or 
FC<-2) expression changes showing a strong downregulation (78%), (Table 
4-1).  
From these studies it could be concluded that high N effect was stronger 
in the absence of rhizobia (at both 2 and 6 h) with a higher number of genes 
showing N-regulated gene expression changes in -Rhiz than +Rhiz. The 
response trend was however similar in respect to the number of genes 
induced or repressed. N-regulation was stronger at 2 h than 6 h with a higher 
percentage of significantly expressed genes being N-induced in -Rhiz and 
+Rhiz. Thus the studies suggest that the early (2 and 6 h) response to high N 
is mainly independent of the rhizobia effect and N-induction is the 
predominant effect with genes prominently induced at 2 h time point. In 
response to nitrate a rapid (within minutes) transcriptional response is induced 
which does not require protein synthesis and thus it is known as the Primary 
Nitrate Response (PNR) (Redinbaugh and Campbell, 1991, Krouk et al., 
2010b). PNR affects a wide range of gene functional categories such as ion 
transport, primary and secondary metabolism, biosynthesis of nucleic acids, 
transcription and RNA processing, and hormone homeostasis (Krouk et al., 
2010a, Krouk et al., 2010b). In this study some of the main gene functional 
categories (P < 0.05) responding to the N supply in the form of NH4NO3 were 
N and amino acid metabolism, secondary metabolism, TCA cycle and minor 
CHO metabolism and hormone metabolism (as in Figure 4-6, Table 4-3 and 
discussed in the following sections).  
As indicated from these FC studies, the N-regulated gene expression 
changes in -Rhiz and +Rhiz followed a similar trend in respect to the number 
of induced or repressed significantly expressed genes at 2 and 6 h time points 
(Table 4-1). In studying the patterns of gene expression changes in different 
clusters several clusters also showed similar responses to high N treatment in 
-Rhiz and +Rhiz at 2 and 6 h. Clusters showing similar patterns between -
Rhiz and +Rhiz mainly contained genes involved in N assimilation. For 
example, a large number of significantly expressed genes in response to high 
N at 2 and 6-hour time points belonged to cluster 16 (with 511 genes) (Figure 
4-5 b). Gene expression levels were similar in -Rhiz and +Rhiz during low N 
growth (0 h) and similar expression levels were also observed in response to 
high N treatment at 2 and 6 hour time points. 
Rhizobia also had a strong effect on gene expression. A strong rhizobia 
effect (FC>2 or FC<-2) was observed in 11% and 10% of the differentially 
expressed genes 2 and 6 hours post N-treatment respectively. This rhizobia 
effect showed dominant upregulation of genes with 96% and 91% of the

differentially expressed genes being upregulated at 2 and 6-hour time points 
(Table 4-1). Strong rhizobia effect was also present in seedlings grown at low 
N (0 hour time point) and 12% of the differentially expressed genes showed 
strong (FC>2 or FC<-2) gene expression changes (97% upregulated) (Table 
4-1). 
The differentially expressed genes showing significant (FC>2 or FC<-2) 
expression changes in response to high N treatment and rhizobia effect  
(Table 4-1) were further analysed using the MapMan (Thimm et al., 2004) 
software to assign groups of genes to different pathways and functional 
categories (Table 4-3 and Figure 4-7). This allowed the interpretation of the 
data in the context of known biological processes or pathways. The results 
from this analysis showed that that the main N and rhizobia responses were 
related to primary N responses, development and regulation of N assimilation 
and RSA development. Figure 4-7 shows the main functional categories 
defined by MapMan analysis and the number of N regulated (Figure 4-7 a) or 
rhizobia regulated (Figure 4-7 b) genes (FC>2 or FC<-2) assigned to each 
category. Functional categories were selected based on the Wilcoxon rank 
sum test with Benjamini-Hochberg corrected (P < 0.05) (Table 4-3). Some 
functional categories that did not meet this cutoff (P < 0.05) but had important 
role in N/rhizobia responses were also selected for further study (some of the 
functional categories in Figure 4-7). Also, MapMan assigned the majority of 
nodulins and some other genes involved in nodulation to a miscellanies 
category hence they are not mentioned in the graphs in Figure 4-7. Thus, six 
different groups were depicted: i) N assimilation and amino acid metabolism; 
ii) metabolism: tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), minor carbohydrate 
metabolism and secondary metabolism; iii) development: cell wall precursor 
(synthesis, degradation), genes involved in LR and nodule developmental 
stages; iv) regulation: TFs, post translation modification of proteins (protein 
synthesis and degradation), hormones, redox and signaling; v) stress (biotic 
and abiotic) and vi) transport (such as nitrate and amino acid transport). The 
vast majority of the gene expression changes were induction of gene

expression by N (-Rhiz or +Rhiz) or rhizobia effect rather than repression as 
the upregulation trend also in the previous section. 
4.2.3.1 N transport, assimilation and amino acid metabolism is rapidly 
regulated upon N treatment 
Treatment of -Rhiz and +Rhiz seedlings to high N for 2 and 6 h after growth 
under low N (N-depravation) conditions resulted in significant induction 
(FC>2) of some of the genes involved in N transport and assimilation (Table 
4-4). The effect of rhizobia on the expression changes of the genes involved 
in N transport and assimilation and amino acid metabolism at low N (0 h) and 
high N treated plants (2 and 6 h) had a quantitatively lower gene expression 
regulatory effect that the N response (Table 4-5). The N-induced genes could 
be primary response genes induced during PNR and show a similar response 
in -Rhiz and +Rhiz. As also seen in Arabidopsis, PNR genes are significantly 
expressed shortly after treatment with nitrate in roots (Krouk et al., 2010b), 
with Arabidopsis pericycle, stele and LR cap the earliest and most responsive 
tissues to nitrate (Gifford et al., 2008, Krouk et al., 2010b). There are 
numerous studies indicating that, as a signal molecule, nitrate regulates gene 
expression and the genes involved in its own assimilation such as genes 
encoding NR and NiR as well as many transporters of the NRT1 and NRT2 
family (Bouguyon et al., 2012). The expression of several genes involved in N 
transport and assimilation was induced by adding nitrate (and not other N 
sources) to soil or medium (Stitt, 1999). Nitrate transporters (Lejay et al., 
1999), nitrate assimilation enzymes (Gowri et al., 1992) and carbon 
assimilation enzymes involved in N/carbon balance (Sakakibara et al., 1997, 
Scheible et al., 1997) are all regulated by nitrate. In the absence of nitrate 
these genes are expressed at a low level. 
Studying the differentially expressed N-regulated genes with significant 
(FC>2 or FC<-2) expression changes at 2 and 6 hours shows that many of 
the genes involved in different steps of N assimilation were strongly 
upregulated in both -Rhiz and +Rhiz (Table 4-4). In response to high N 
treatment the differentially expressed high affinity nitrate transporters 
Medtr2g085510.1 and AC233663_23.1 were highly induced (average FC of 5) 
and showed a similar expression pattern in -Rhiz and +Rhiz at both 2 and 6 h 
(Table 4-4). Based on MapMan pathway analysis these two transporters are 
highly similar to the AtNRT2.1 high affinity transporter. Studies on Arabidopsis 
(Zhuo et al., 1999) have also reported that local supply of nitrate induces the 
expression of AtNRT2.1. The differentially expressed nitrate transporter 
Medtr5g012290.1 (highly similar to AtNRT1.1 based on MapMan pathway 
analysis) showed significant (FC=2.5) expression changes in response to high 
N specifically at 2 h in +Rhiz (Table 4-4). The local signaling pathway 
activated in response to localized high nitrate concentrations affect RSA 
(Zhang et al., 1999). AtNRT1.1 promotes LR elongation in response to 
localized high nitrate concentration (Remans et al., 2006a) it is also involved 
in auxin transport and accumulation required for LR growth (Bouguyon et al., 
2012). Here the significant induction of NRT1.1 (Medtr5g012290.1) only in 
+Rhiz at high N may suggest that its expression pattern is affected by rhizobia 
and also that it could be one of the components of the regulatory pathway 
responsible for short PR and LRs at high N in the presence of rhizobia (Figure 
4-1).  
The significant (FC>2) induction of the nitrate transporters 
Medtr2g085510.1, AC233663_23.1 and Medtr5g012290.1 that are highly 
similar to AtNRT2.1 and AtNRT1.1 could be evidence of similar rapid N 
assimilation in Medicago. This could be part of the PNR as also seen in 
Arabidopsis that under short-term supply of nitrate NRT2.1 is upregulated by 
NRT1.1 (Ho et al., 2009). Under high nitrate concentrations AtNRT1.1 is 
T101-dephosphorylated and acts as a low affinity transporter. This leads to 
the full induction of AtNRT2.1 (Ho et al., 2009). This mechanism provides an 
explanation for the high induction of the two high affinity transporters in 
response to high N treatment.  
High N treatment also caused the strong induction of differentially 
expressed enzymes involved in the N assimilation pathway such as nitrate 
reductases, ferredoxin-nitrite reductase and glutamate dehydrogenase in -
Rhiz and +Rhiz. The Ferredoxin-nitrite reductase Medtr4g086020.1 (Highly 
similar to AtNIR1) was significantly expressed in response to high N in -Rhiz 
and +Rhiz at 2 and 6-hour time points (Table 4-4). Ferredoxin-nitrite 
reductase is a key enzyme in the assimilation of N since it catalyzes the six-
electron reduction of nitrite to ammonium (Orea et al., 2001). In the non-
nodulating (-Rhiz) plants this enzyme showed a more strong induction in 
response to high N treatment at 2 and 6 h (FC>6) compared to +Rhiz (FC>2). 
This suggests that once supplied with high N, a stronger N assimilation 
activity was induced in the -Rhiz plants that had no previous access to N 
source in the form of N2. This contrasts to the nodulating plants (+Rhiz) that 
were able to acquire some of their N requirements through nodulation when 
under N limiting (low N) conditions. 
In contrast to early N assimilation genes, the number of differentially 
expressed N-regulated genes assigned as enzymes of amino acid 
metabolism pathways was higher in -Rhiz samples. This may be in agreement 
with the higher N assimilation activity observed in -Rhiz to compensate for the 
previous N limitation conditions they were subjected to. These enzymes were 
mainly upregulated and involved in the degradation such as L-asparaginase, 
Tyrosine aminotransferase and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase. Some 
differentially expressed genes annotated as degradation enzymes (e.g. L-
aspartate oxidase) were repressed and some annotated as enzymes involved 
in synthesis of amino acids (e.g. 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase) were 
induced (Table 4-4). In +Rhiz samples, differentially expressed genes 
assigned as enzymes involved in amino acid synthesis were more than the 
ones involved in degradation. The differentially expressed genes that were 
commonly expressed in +Rhiz between both time points were generally 
upregulated and had a similar expression pattern in both -Rhiz and +Rhiz. For 
example alanine glyoxylate aminotransferases that participate in alanine 
synthesis were strongly induced in both time points in both -Rhiz and +Rhiz. 
At 2 h, all the significantly expressed enzymes involved in amino acid 
metabolisms were induced in -Rhiz and +Rhiz. This may be part of the early 
response to N as an induction of assimilation activities. At the later time point 
(6 h) some repression were observed among the amino acid metabolism 
enzymes in -Rhiz and +Rhiz suggesting balancing mechanism for amino acid 
metabolism.  
4.2.3.2 Regulation of carbon metabolism during N treatment and 
nodulation 
There was a strong response (FC>2 or FC<-2) to N among differentially 
expressed TCA cycle enzymes and proteins involved in carbohydrate 
metabolism at 2 and 6 h in both nodulating and non-nodulating plants (Table 
4-4). This may be to provide the necessary carbon and energy pool for the 
enhanced metabolic and developmental activities due to the availability of N. 
This fits with previous studies in Arabidopsis that suggest that carbon 
assimilation enzymes involved in N/carbon balance (Sakakibara et al., 1997, 
Scheible et al., 1997) are regulated by nitrate. Four carbonic anhydrases 
(Medtr5g066060) involved in the TCA cycle were differentially expressed (2 < 
FC < 5) in response to high N in nodulating and non-nodulating plants with a 
higher expression at 2 h (Table 4-4). Carbonic anhydrases are some of the 
key enzymes in CO2 metabolism, catalyzing the reversible hydration of CO2 to 
form bicarbonate. The higher overexpression of these genes in -Rhiz 
compared to +Rhiz and the lower number of significantly expressed genes 
involved in the metabolism of minor carbohydrates (with some strongly 
repressed) in +Rhiz suggests that a stronger carbon metabolism activity is 
triggered in non-nodulating plants once supplied with high N. This could be to 
provide enough carbon resources for the increased developmental processes 
when enough N resources are available. This could be one of the reasons 
that +Rhiz has shorter LRs in high N compared to -Rhiz in the phenotypic 
analysis of plant responses to N (Figure 4-1). Enzymes involved in the 
metabolism of minor carbohydrates were mainly induced at 2 and 6 hour pt. 
Although, fewer enzymes showed significant expression in +Rhiz compared to 
-Rhiz at both time points and some were strongly repressed (Table 4-4).

Two carbonic anhydrases, involved in the TCA cycle showed a higher 
expression change at low N compared to 2 and 6 h high N treatments (Table 
4-5). Medtr3g077910 was strongly affected by rhizobia at low N i.e. post 
treatment with high N (Table 4-5) and Medtr3g077940 was differentially 
expressed (FC>3) only in low N. The rhizobial regulation of these genes could 
be related to the level of nodule development and functioning in the plants in 
response to low and high N concentrations. The expression of some carbonic 
anhydrases may be controlled by the presence of the rhizobia inside the 
nodule (Pea et al., 1997). These carbonic anhydrases may be involved in pH 
regulation and/or CO2/HCO3-transport during nodule initiation (Pea et al., 
1997) suggesting that they may have different roles at several stages of 
nodule development and function. The induction response of transporters of N 
assimilation products, amino acid and peptide transporters affected by 
rhizobia at low N (Table 4-5) could be an indication of nodule activity at low N 
condition. Changes in gene expression of carbon metabolism genes in the 
nodules have been also reported in other studies (El Yahyaoui et al., 2004, 
Cabeza et al., 2014). Plants provide the bacteroids with the organic carbon 
from the photosynthesis. This makes the nodules strong carbon sinks and the 
availability of photoassimilates is one of the important factors controlling 
nodulation. The energy and carbon skeleton are required for N2 reduction, 
assimilation of ammonia and export of nitrogenous compounds. 
4.2.3.3 Identification of putative regulatory genes involved in Rhizobia 
and N responses  
N regulation (predominantly as N-induction) and rhizobia regulation was 
identified for TFs, proteins with signaling functions such as receptor kinases 
and enzymes involved in post translation modification of proteins (protein 
synthesis and degradation). Around 22% of the differentially expressed (FC>2 
or FC<-2) genes were assigned as regulation genes (Figure 4-8) by the 
MapMan software (Thimm et al., 2004). These genes (Table 4-4) may be 
members of the signaling cascade between N sensing and physiological 
responses to N. Gene expression studies at early time points (up to 20 min)

after exposure to nitrate in Arabidopsis suggests that the initial response to 
nitrate includes genes involved in translation (protein synthesis) followed by 
regulation of metabolism and hormonal pathways that mediate development 
(Krouk et al., 2010b). In N-deprived Arabidopsis, NO3- compared to NH4+ 
treatment resulted in the distinct phosphorylation patterns of proteins involved 
in regulation including signaling functions, transcriptional regulators and 
hormone metabolism (Engelsberger and Schulze, 2011).  
4.2.3.3.1 Transcriptional regulators 
The expression levels of the TFs and their N or rhizobia induction or 
repression suggest that different groups of TFs in each TF family were 
responsible for different regulatory responses. Around 8% (in -Rhiz) and 7% 
(in +Rhiz) of the differentially expressed N-regulated genes (FC>2 or FC<-2) 
were TFs. N-induction was the prominent response of different groups of TFs 
(Figure 4-8 c) possibly involved in regulating gene expression responses to 
high N (2 and 6 h) in -Rhiz and +Rhiz. This made up for 74% and 72% of the 
TFs in -Rhiz and 80% and 50% in +Rhiz at 2 and 6 h of high N treatment 
respectively. Among the differentially expressed rhizobia regulated genes with 
significant expression changes (FC>2 or FC<-2) only 2% were TFs in low N 
and 1% in high N (2 and 6 h) treated samples. All of these TFs were rhizobia-
induced except for one that was suppressed at 6 h high N treatment (Table 4-
Different N-regulated members of each TF family usually didnt show the 
same response between -Rhiz and +Rhiz and/or different time points. For 
example a higher number of differentially expressed TFs from the 
APETALA2/Ethylene-responsive element binding protein family (AP2/EREBP) 
showed strong N response (FC>2 or FC<-2) at -Rhiz (at 2 and 6 h) compared 
to +Rhiz or differentially expressed members of the WRKY domain 
transcription factor family showed significant expression changes only in -Rhiz 
(2 and 6 h), indicating that different TFs were responsible for the N-regulated 
responses at different time points (2 and 6) and also between -Rhiz and 
+Rhiz. This was also observed among rhizobia-regulated TFs and different 
groups of TFs were responding to low and high N conditions.   
The WRKY TFs are involved in the transcriptional regulations during 
development, metabolism and responses to biotic and abiotic stress but their 
role in N responses is not yet well known (Canales et al., 2014, Rushton et al., 
2010). In this study WRKY TFs showed an N response that was only 
observed in -Rhiz and rhizobia had no significant effect on the expression 
changes of WRKY TFs at low or high N either. Two differentially expressed 
WRKY TFs showed significant N-regulated response only in -Rhiz. 
Medtr7g038380.1 (WRKY 44) was strongly N-induced (FC>2) in -Rhiz at 2 h 
and Medtr7g110720.1 (WRKY 5) was N-suppressed (FC<-2) at 2 and 6 h. 
This suggests a role for WRKY TFs in N responses in the absence of rhizobia 
that could be related to abiotic stress due to N deficiency in the non-
nodulating plants. Another explanation could be that these two WRKY TFs 
may be involved in the development of LRs and may be one of the reasons 
for the difference in root phenotype between -Rhiz and +Rhiz at high N 
(Figure 4-1).  
4.2.3.3.1.1 Regulation	
 assimilation	
 circadian	
 rhythms	
Of the N-regulated TFs the circadian clock-associated protein 1a 
(Medtr8g077420.1) from the MYB-related TF family was strongly repressed in 
all time points in -Rhiz and +Rhiz and showed a rhizobia independent 
response that was affected by the duration of high N treatment. The 
expression level of this TF showed variation between time points and the 
expression level had a two times decrease at 6 h compared to 2 h in -Rhiz 
and +Rhiz (Table 4-4). In fact, this TF was among the N-suppressed genes 
showing the highest decrease (FC<-4) in gene expression level at 6 h both in 
-Rhiz and +Rhiz. In Arabidopsis circadian clock-associated protein 1a (CCA1) 
is one of the main regulators of the circadian clock (McClung, 2006) and is 
involved in circadian regulation of N assimilation in plants (Gutirrez et al., 
2008). A model has been proposed in Arabidopsis (Gutirrez et al., 2008) 
suggesting an interaction between the circadian clock and N-assimilatory 
pathway. The direct regulatory role of CCA1 on N-assimilation is one of the 
factors responsible for the clocks affect on the N-assimilatory pathway and 
the downstream metabolites of the N-assimilation pathway such as 
Glutamate, Glutamine and other N-metabolites influences the circadian clock 
by regulating CCA1 (Gutirrez et al., 2008). The circadian clock regulates 
some of the steps in N metabolism such as the expression and activity of 
nitrate reductases (Gutirrez et al., 2008). The high affinity nitrate transporters 
NRT1.1 and NRT2.1 are also coordinately regulated by nitrate and circadian 
rhythms (Krouk et al., 2010a). In the current study, as N-deprived plants were 
subject to high N, a PNR starts with upregulation of high affinity nitrate 
transporters (NRT1.1 and NRT2.1) and nitrate reductases that may be 
indicative of enhanced N-assimilation activities when N resource is not 
limiting. The strong N-suppression (FC<-2) of the differentially expressed 
circadian clock-associated protein 1a TF in response to high N treatment may 
be indicative of the regulatory response and interaction between the circadian 
rhythm and N-assimilation.  
4.2.3.3.1.2 A	
 putative	
 regulating	
 development	
The bHLH family are a large family of TFs involved in various signaling 
and developmental processes such as hormone signaling, symbiotic 
ammonium transport and root development (Carretero-Paulet et al., 2010) 
and references within. This TF family is not well studied in the legumes but 
members have been characterized that participate in symbiotic interactions 
such as bHLH1 that is involved in controlling nodule vasculature patterning 
and nutrient exchanges between nodules and roots (Godiard et al., 2011). 
Here we have identified five differentially expressed N-responsive bHLH TFs 
(Table 4-4) with significant expression changes (FC>2 or FC<-2) under high N 
treatment. These TFs showed different responses in -Rhiz and +Rhiz and/or 
at 2 and 6 h high N treatment. For example Medtr4g098250.1 (bHLH 25) was 
N-suppressed (FC< 2) at 2 h in -Rhiz and 6 h in +Rhiz and Medtr3g099620.1 
(bHLH 96) only in +Rhiz at 2 and 6 h. bHLH 96 along with Medtr4g092700.1 
(bHLH 25) were the only bHLH TFs that were significantly (FC>2) affected by 
rhizobia at low or high N (Table 4-5). These results suggest that bHLH 96 
(Medtr3g099620) and bHLH 25 could be involved in N responses and also 
rhizobia affected responses in the root as they are suppressed in the N-
regulated responses and repressed in the rhizobia-regulated ones. It appears 
that the significant expression change of bHLH 96 is related to the presence 
of rhizobia and possibly nodulation. The N-suppression of bHLH 96 at high N 
(2 and 6 h) could be related to the presence of rhizobia or nodulation since it 
is significantly (FC<-2) down regulated only in the presence of rhizobia 
irrespective of the N concentration. The rhizobia-induction of this TF is only 
observed at low N conditions where the plants are able to nodulate. Taking all 
these together it could be assumed that the regulatory role of bHLH 96 could 
be dependent on the presence of rhizobia or nodulation activity of the plant 
and it may be related to controlling developmental activities such as 
nodulation (as it is induced at low N and had no significant expression 
changes at high N where nodulation was inhibited) or LR development (as our 
phenotypic studies showed that LR length could be affected by the presence 
of rhizobia at high N). 
4.2.3.3.2 Hormone metabolism 
The expression change of the genes involved in hormone metabolisms 
shows that N-regulation (predominantly as suppression) of hormone 
metabolism was stronger at 6 h especially in -Rhiz. The majority of the 
differentially expressed N-regulated genes (FC>2 or FC<-2) involved in 
hormonal metabolism were strongly repressed (FC< 2) both in -Rhiz and 
+Rhiz, particularly at 6 hours of N treatment (Table 4-4); in -Rhiz 69% and in 
+Rhiz 88% of the genes were downregulated. These were genes that 
participated in the biosynthesis or signaling pathways of phytohormones 
auxin, brassinosteroid, ethylene, gibberellin, jasmonate acid (JA) and salicylic 
acid (SA) (Figure 4-8 e). The expression patterns of the genes were mostly 
different between -Rhiz and +Rhiz and between time points suggesting that 
the presence or absence of rhizobia and the duration of high N treatment 
were factors affecting hormone metabolism. This could be due to the roles of 
these hormones in regulating LR development or nodulation in response to N 
and the cross talk between some of these hormones in regulating these 
developmental pathways. Auxin is a mobile signal that originates in the shoot 
and is involved in the systemic regulation of LR development (Alvarez et al., 
2012). Other phytohormones are also involved in regulating this process 
usually in an auxin-dependent way. Auxin distribution that is key in root 
development is regulated through the special distribution of certain 
transporters such as PIN family auxin transporters (Saini et al., 2013). 
Hormones such as JA, SA and GA are involved in regulating the special 
distribution of PIN family transporters (Sun et al., 2011, Armengot et al., 
2014). 
The significant (FC>2 or FC<-2) N-regulated expression of some of the 
genes involved in the JA pathway (Table 4-4) was affected by the presence or 
absence of rhizobia (Table 4-4). The response of these genes to high N that is 
also affected by rhizobia may suggest that they could be responsible for the 
short LR phenotype observed at high N in +Rhiz. JA is involved in plant 
responses to biotic and abiotic stress as well as development (Wasternack, 
2014). It regulates LR formation in Arabidopsis through interaction with auxin 
(Sun et al., 2011, Sun et al., 2009). The subcellular distribution of the PIN 
family auxin transporters is crucial in auxin gradient-mediated formation of 
LRs. JA down regulates PIN1 and PIN2 protein levels at the plasma 
membrane thus negatively regulates auxin transport (Sun et al., 2011, Sun et 
al., 2009). In Arabidopsis ERF109 integrates JA signalling into auxin pathway 
to regulate LR formation (Cai et al., 2014).  
 The rhizobia-mediated significant (FC>2 or FC<-2) expression changes 
of Medtr5g013530.1 (Protein TIFY 7) and Medtr5g008040.1 (12-
oxophytodienoate reductase) that are involved in JA pathway (Table 4-5) 
were not dependent on N concentration. These genes could be involved in the 
regulation of nodule development through JA. JA is a negative regulator of 
root-nodule symbiosis (Nagata and Suzuki, 2014, Kinkema and Gresshoff, 
2008, Seo et al., 2007, Nakagawa and Kawaguchi, 2006, Sun et al., 2006). In 
M. truncatula NF signaling was inhibited by the application of JA (Zhang et al., 
2012, Sun et al., 2006). Although studies also suggest that over a certain 
range of concentration JA could be a positive regulator of nodulation (Suzuki 
et al., 2011, Zdyb et al., 2011). 
SA is a regulatory signal involved in plant responses to abiotic stress 
such as drought and salt tolerance (Palma et al., 2013, Chini et al., 2004). It is 
also involved in plant pathogenic responses by inducing the plant systemic 
resistance (An and Mou, 2011, Blilou et al., 1999). SA can strongly inhibit 
nodulation and nodule development (van Spronsen et al., 2003, Stacey et al., 
2006). The SA-dependent mechanism in legumes in response to rhizobia is 
well studied (Robledo et al., 2011, Stacey et al., 2006). The significant (FC>2 
or FC<-2) rhizobia-mediated expression changes of three genes involved in 
the SA pathway (Table 4-5) could suggest that they may be involved in this 
mechanism. Medtr5g020940.1 (Jasmonate O-methyltransferase) was 
significantly (FC<-2) suppression at low N (Table 4-5) that could be due to its 
role in inhibition of SA-mediated control of nodulation. Medtr5g093900.1 (S-
adenosyl-L-methionine salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase-like protein) 
was significantly (FC>2) rhizobia-induced only at high N and the significant 
(FC>2) induction of Medtr7g080940.1 (Uncharacterized UDP-
glucosyltransferase At1g05670) was N independent (Table 4-5). The NFs 
produced by the compatible rhizobia are involved in the inhibition of SA-
dependent defense in Legumes (Martinez-Abarca et al., 1998). Inoculation of 
Medicago sativa with compatible rhizobia resulted in decrease of SA level 
while inoculation with incompatible rhizobia lead to SA accumulation in the 
root (Martinez-Abarca et al., 1998). The suppression of SA-dependent 
defence mechanism against compatible rhizobia allows the establishment of 
the symbiosis (Blilou et al., 1999). Studies also suggest that SA is directly 
involved in signal transmission in the autoregulation of nodulation (van 
Spronsen et al., 2003, Sato et al., 2002). 
The N-regulated significant expression changes of two Jasmonate O-
methyltransferases involved in salicylic acid (synthesis, degradation) pathway 
(Table 4-4) was independent of presence or absence of rhizobia and their 
significant (FC>2 or FC<-2) expression changes could be related to the role of 
SA in root development. Recent studies suggest a role for SA in root 
development by affecting the endocytic traffic of PIN family auxin-efflux 
transporters (Armengot et al., 2014, Du et al., 2013). High levels of SA affects 
PIN1 and PIN2 internalization resulting in the increase of these proteins in 
plasma membrane (Du et al., 2013). These results suggest that SA and auxin 
together regulate the clathrin-dependent endocytic mechanism that regulates 
PIN trafficking and auxin flux and distribution (Armengot et al., 2014, Du et al., 
2013). 
GA is involved in regulating different aspects of plant growth and 
development. To our knowledge, no major role for GA in regulating LR 
development in response to N has been reported. The cross-talk between 
auxin and GA modulates LR development (Gou et al., 2010). There are 
studies indicating that GA is a negative regular of LR development. In 
transgenic Populus plants alteration of LR development by GA is partly 
related to changes in polar auxin transport (Gou et al., 2010). GA mediates 
auxin transport by regulating the abundance of some of the PIN transporters . 
Gibberellin 20 oxidase 2 and 3 that are involved in gibberellin biosynthesis 
(Plackett et al., 2012) were strongly N-repressed (FC<-3, among the most 
highly N-suppressed genes) at all time points with almost no variation in their 
expression levels between -Rhiz and +Rhiz (Table 4-4). Indicating that the 
strong N-suppression of these genes was related to the high N treatment 
rather than presence or absence of rhizobia and possibly associated with GA 
role in regulating LR development under high N rather than its role in 
nodulation. GA 20-oxidase 2 and 3 are among the enzymes regulating the flux 
of bioactive GA by catalyzing the final steps of GA biosynthesis (Gou et al., 
2010). In A. thaliana and tobacco GA 20-oxidase is induced by auxin (Frigerio 
et al., 2006). The transport of auxin by AtPIN1 results in the degradation of 
AUX/IAA proteins and activation of ARF7 TFs. This leads to the activation of 
GA biosynthesis genes, such as GA 20-oxidase (Saini et al., 2013).  
The suppression of GA 20-oxidase 2 and 3 that results in the decrease 
in GA biosynthesis may affect the biosynthesis of ethylene. As studies show 
that low levels of GA can induce ethylene biosynthesis (Hayashi et al., 2014 
and references within). The N-induction of ethylene-responsive transcription 
factor 5 (AC233556 27.1) that is involved in hormone metabolism at all time 
point in -Rhiz and +Rhiz may be related to this GA and ethylene interaction. 
4.2.3.3.3 Regulation of protein activity 
The overall expression pattern of the genes involved in protein 
metabolism (degradation and postranslational modification) showed some 
differences between different time points and/or -Rhiz and +Rhiz. For 
example, the degradation enzyme cysteine proteinase 2 was strongly N-
induced at 2 hours of high N treatment and the posttranslational modification 
enzyme protein kinase-like protein was significantly N-induced at all time 
points in -Rhiz and +Rhiz. Carboxyl-terminal proteinase was strongly 
repressed at 6 hours in -Rhiz and at 2 hours in +Rhiz (Table 4-4). Around 
70% of the differentially regulated genes involved in protein metabolism that 
responded to high N (in -Rhiz and +Rhiz) or rhizobia (at low N or 2 and 6 h 
high N treatments) were proteins mediating degradation (Tables 4-4 and 4-5). 
Protein degradation plays an important role in control of development and 
plant-microbe interaction (Hellmann and Estelle, 2002, El Yahyaoui et al., 
2004) and is enhanced under stress or when the N or C of the amino acids is 
required for other processes (Vorster et al., 2013).  
4.2.3.3.3.1 Rhizobial	
 induction	
 putative	
 players

 senescence	
Rhizobia had a strong (2.5 < FC < 7.5) effect on expression of nine 
differentially expressed cysteine proteinases (degradation enzymes), all of 
which were highly rhizobia-induced at low N and high N treatment (2 and 6 h), 
with the highest expression level at 6 h; except for Medtr3g044270.1 and 
Medtr4g080730.1 that were significantly rhizobia-induced only in high N-
treated plants (Table 4-5). The strongest rhizobia-induction of the cysteine 
proteinases was at 6 h post N-treatment, including Medtr5g022560.1 and 
AC233675 19.1 that based on MapMan pathway analysis have similarity to 
SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENE 12 (SAG12) in Arabidopsis that is 
expressed in senescent tissues. Studies on nodule senescence in Medicago 
(Van de Velde et al., 2006) shows a high degree of overlap between the 
transcriptome of leaf senescence in Arabidopsis and nodule senescence in 
Medicago. This suggests that the two processes may recruit similar 
mechanisms. The induction of cysteine proteinases is a senescence marker in 
legumes as it is one of the main steps in the later stages of nodule 
development leading to senescence (Vorster et al., 2013). In Glycine max, as 
the nodule develops, the zone with highly expressed cysteine proteinases 
also increases in size (Alesandrini et al., 2003). During senescence metabolic 
and structural proteins are degraded and the assimilated N in the nodules is 
translocated from the nodule (Vorster et al., 2013).  
The higher expression level of the cysteine proteinases (Table 4-5), 
especially the ones involved in senescence, in high N treated plants 
compared to plants grown at low N, could be an indication of nodule 
senescence. Since the nodules are no more than 2 weeks old and the 
lifespan of fast growing annual legumes is around 10-12 weeks (Vorster et al., 
2013), it is more likely that this would be the very early stage of senescence 
possibly triggered prematurely by the N influx (high N treatment) that induces 
inhibition or reduction of nodule activities. Premature nodule senescence 
caused by stress such as nitrate treatment and dark stress (Matamoros et al., 
1999) has been reported also in other studies. Studying the transcriptome of 
different stages of nodule senescence in M. truncatula has also identified a 
cluster of genes with enhanced gene expression before the initiation of nodule 
senescence (Van de Velde et al., 2006).  
The two cysteine proteinases (Medtr5g022560.1 and AC233675 19.1) 
along with the sugar transporter Medtr6g006140.1 (solute carrier family 2 
facilitated glucose transporter member 2) had the highest expression changes 
and were strongly rhizobia induced at 6 hours (Table 4-5). Based on MapMan 
analysis this sugar transporter is similar to the carbohydrate transmembrane 
transporter AtINT2 (INOSITOL TRANSPORTER 2). Medtr6g006140.1 shows 
high expression changes (FC>6) at low N and post treatment with high N at 
both time points. This gene shows to be affected by rhizobia more than the 
other significantly expressed genes (FC>8) at 6 hours pt with high N (having 
the highest FC among all the significantly expressed genes). This transporter 
is not well studied but its strong rhizobia-induction at high N treated samples 
especially at the later time point (6 h) could be to retrieve carbohydrate 
compounds from the senescing nodules. As also studies on AtINT2 function in 
the leaf tissue suggests that it retrieves the diffused inositol from the 
mesophyll cells (Schneider et al., 2007). 
The ammonium transporter 1 member 4 (Medtr7g098930.1) was 
induced by rhizobia and significantly expressed only at 6 h (FC>2). In another 
study looking at the nitrate impact on nodule activity in M. truncatula, 
Medtr7g098930.1 and some other members of the ammonium transporter 
family were expressed in the nodule (Cabeza et al., 2014). This transporter is 
highly similar (MapMan analysis) to the Arabidopsis AtAMT1;4 high affinity 
secondary active ammonium transmembrane transporter. The AMT 
transporter family contributes to the regulation of ammonium levels in the 
plants to prevent ammonium toxicity. AtAMT1;4 is one of the less 
characterized transporters in this family. It is a membrane localised 
transporter and it is believed to be involved in transporting ammonium into 
pollen. It contributes to N nutrition of the pollen by mediating the ammonium 
uptake and retrieval within the plasma membrane (Yuan et al., 2009). Here 
the over expression of this ammonium transporter at 6 h in response to 
rhizobia could be also related to ammonium retrieval as an early response to 
senescence. 
4.2.3.4 Rhizobial and N co-regulation of development 
A strong rhizobia effect upon gene expression was observed in plants 
grown at low N (0 time point) and also in seedlings treated with high N for (2 
and 6 hour time points) in +Rhiz conditions (Figure 4-5 a). Remarkably, the 
genes significantly expressed under these conditions were highly upregulated 
(around 96%) (Table 4-1 and Figure 4-7 b). Cluster 26 (741 genes) from the 
study of clusters of differentially expressed genes (step 3 in Figure 4-2 c), was 
one of the clusters showing this strong rhizobia effect. In this cluster the N-
effect on gene expression pattern was similar between -Rhiz and +Rhiz but 
the gene expression level was higher in +Rhiz (Figure 4-5 b). Around 47% of 
the genes in this cluster were significantly expressed genes involved in the 
nodulation pathway. The genes related to the nodulation pathway were mainly 
upregulated and showed very strong expression changes (2 < FC < 9) in 
response to rhizobia at low N (0 h) and high N (2 and 6 h).  
The rhizobia-mediated induction of genes that were mainly involved in 
the nodulation pathway suggests an enhanced developmental activity in the 
roots under low and high N condition. The significant increase (FC>2) of the 
expression levels of differentially expressed genes at low N could be related 
to nodule organogenesis and activity. At high N the rhizobia-induction of 
genes (FC>2) may be associated to the rhizobia effect on the increased 
developmental activities when sufficient N is available. An example could be 
the rhizobia-induction of some enzymes involved in cell wall degradation 
during nodule organogenesis or LR emergence such as pectate lyases and 
polygalacturonases that had different expression levels at different time points 
(Table 4-5).  
The nodulation pathway genes Medtr5g099060.1 and Medtr4g068000.1 
that are Nodule INception proteins (NIN), a key regulator of nodulation (Marsh 
et al., 2007) and the differentially expressed calmodulin-like proteins 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, and 6b that are involved in calcium signaling were significantly induced (2 < 
FC < 7) at low and high N (2 and 6 h) with almost no variations in their

expression levels between different time points and N concentrations (Table 
4-5). Aside from calmodulin-like protein 3, all showed only rhizobia-regulated 
responses and did not show any strong N-regulated responses at 2 and 6 h of 
high N treatment in -Rhiz and +Rhiz. This may indicate that changes in the 
expression levels of these genes are in a rhizobia dependent manner and 
their role in regulation of nodulation is through a mechanism independent from 
that involving N availability.    
There was not a strong N-regulation response among nodulins and 
rhizobia had a stronger effect on the expression of these genes. All 
differentially expressed nodulins were strongly (2 < FC < 9) rhizobia-induced 
at low and high N (2 and 6 h). The expression levels of these nodulins varied 
between N conditions and some showed significant expression changes only 
in certain N concentrations indicative of the level of nodule activity based on 
plants N status (Table 4-6). 
4.2.3.4.1 Nodule Specific Cysteine Rich (NCR) peptides 
Around 80% of the nodulins showing rhizobia mediated induction at low 
and/or high N were members of the Nodule Specific Cysteine Rich Peptide 
(NCR) family. There were changes in the expression patterns of different sets 
of NCRs depending on the N status of the seedlings (growth at low N, 
treatment with high N for 2 and 6 h) (Table 4-5 and 4-6). NCRs have around 
500 members in Medicago with unclear biological function (Marshall et al., 
2011, Silverstein, 2014). They are a class of cysteine rich peptides (CRP) and 
are only found in Medicago and some other closely related legume families 
(Farkas et al., 2014). NCRs suppress the rhizobial reproduction and increase 
the ploidy levels hence causing the irreversible differentiation of the rhizobia in 
the symbiosomes into bacteroids with the ability to fix N (Van de Velde et al., 
2010). NCRs are also one of the components of the plants defence reaction 
to bacteria that turns infection into the beneficial rhizobia-legume symbiosis 
interaction (Farkas et al., 2014). There are evidences for the involvement of 
CRPs in different molecular signaling pathways and some NCRs are also 
candidates for regulating nodule development (Wang et al., 2010, Van de 
Velde et al., 2010, Marshall et al., 2011). Here we have identified 6 
differentially expressed NCRs (Table 4-6 b) that are significantly (FC>2) 
upregulated in response to rhizobia at low N. These NCRs could be involved 
in the nodule development pathway because of their enhanced expression 
levels at low N where to compensate for the N deficiency under N deprivation 
plants showed increased nodulation activities (as observed at the our 
phenotyping studies).  
We have also identified NCRs with putative role in control of nodule 
number or inhibition of nodule activity at high N (Table 4-6 c and d) because 
of their exclusive strong induction (FC>2) over high N treatment at 2 and/or 6 
h. It is also interesting to know whether these NCRs also affect LR 
development at high N and in the presence of rhizobia. The over expression 
of these NCRs only at high N could make them one of the putative players in 
the rhizobia effect on LR length (Figure 4-1) as observed in our phenotypic 
studies. Several studies have provided evidences that CPRs may function as 
secreted signaling peptides regulating several aspects of development and 
secreted CRPs are identified in the roots having essential roles in root 
development (Marshall et al., 2011) and references within.  
4.3 Gene expression responses to low treatment in rhizobia inoculated 
seedlings grown on high N 
A microarray experiment was designed (Figure 4-2 b) to study the 
response of rhizobia inoculated seedlings grown at high N to a 6-hour 
treatment with low N. This was to study the effect of transferring from high N  
(5 mM) condition to low N condition (0.1 mM) on the gene expression. Data 
was quality checked and normalised as carried out earlier (section 4.1). 
The Limma package in R (Smyth, 2004) was used to identify 2 patterns 
of significantly different gene expression for 2 treatments (HH, HL) with a 
significance cutoff of P<0.05. From a total of 47529 genes tested on the 
Nimblegen Mt3.5 gene expression array, 168 differential expressed genes

response to low N treatment of rhizobia inoculated samples grown at high N assigned to different functional categories

were identified. Two clusters were formed of these differentially expressed 
genes. Low N was found to repress 73% of the differentially expressed genes 
(cluster 2 with 123 genes).  
The effect of low N treatment after growth at high N condition on the 
gene expression was studied by calculating the FC between high N treated 
(control) and low N treated samples. To analyse the regulation of gene 
expression at higher stringency, differentially expressed genes from Limma 
analysis that had a FC>2 or FC<-2 were determined as significant. Only 21% 
of the differentially expressed genes were significantly expressed of which 
83% were downregulated (Table 4-7). This predominant gene suppression in 
response to low N treatment could suggest the activation of a local N signal 
for decreasing biological activities at limiting N condition. NRT2.1 may be 
acting as a nitrate sensor and signal transducer in this response because of 
the strong N-induction (FC>2) of the differentially expressed high affinity 
nitrate transporter Medtr2g085510.1 (NRT2.1). Consistent with previous 
findings in Arabidopsis (Remans et al., 2006b, Little et al., 2005), here 
NRT2.1 could be also involved in regulating LR development and suppression 
of LR initiation at low nitrate. The strong N-suppression (FC<-2) of nitrate 
reductase Medtr3g073180.1 could be another indicative of the decrease in N 
assimilation activities in response to low N.   
MYB164 (Medtr5g020540.1), bZIP (AC233556_19.1), BEE2 
(Medtr3g116770.1) and two-component response regulator ARR1 
(Medtr5g017980.1) were the only differentially expressed TFs showing 
significant (FC>2 or FC<-2) expression changes under low N treatment. 
ARR1 (from the G2-like TF family) and BEE2 (from the bHLH TF family) were 
strongly N-repressed (FC<-2) while MYB164 and bZIP TFs showed strong N-
induction (FC>2). These TFs may be involved in the regulation of the rhizobia 
mediated responses to low N (Table 4-7) affecting N assimilation and 
transport because of their co-expression with NRT2.1 and nitrate reductase. 
Network analysis has also identified putative roles for AtbZIP and AtMyb TFs 
in controlling nitrate responses in Arabidopsis (Canales et al., 2014). This 
study has also provided evidence for the role of G2-like TFs in regulating 
transport and signaling functions in response to nitrate.  
LR formation is promoted through the synergic function of BRs and 
auxin (Bao et al., 2004). BR are also negative regulators of nodule numbers 
possibly through unknown shoot-derived AON signaling pathways (Ryu et al., 
2012). In Arabidopsis, BR facilitates polar auxin transport by enhancing AtPIN 
expression. Polar auxin transport and local accumulation are essential for LR 
formation and nodule organogenesis. Thus the level of BR and auxin could 
affect LR development and nodulation (Ryu et al., 2012). The co-expression 
of BEE2 (BRASSINOSTEROID ENHANCED EXPRESSION2) TF that is 
involved in early BR responses (Friedrichsen et al., 2002) along with the 
aldo/keto-reductase family protein Medtr7g114980.2 (Table 4-7) that is 
involved in auxin metabolism may be indicative of the roles they have in the 
regulatory cross talk between BR and auxin in regulating LR development and 
nodule number. BEE2 along with BEE1 and BEE3 have a significant role in 
plant growth and they redundantly promote cell elongation (Friedrichsen et al., 
2002). Studies in Arabidopsis have showed that BEE2 expression is 
repressed by ABA, an antagonistic of the BR pathway (Friedrichsen et al., 
2002) and this crosstalk between ABA and BR pathway is important in 
regulating plant development. The strong N-suppression of BEE2 (FC<-2) 
along with the N-induction of the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 7 
(Medtr7g045370.1) that is involved in ABA metabolism may suggest that 
these two genes are involved in the BR and ABA pathways to regulate 
developmental activities in the root in response to low N. 
4.4 Study of gene expression changes at cell type level 
Plant responses to the environment occur at a cell-specific level (Spaink, 
2000, Gifford et al., 2008). Nodules and LRs are developed from cortex and 
pericycle respectively. Thus the aim of this research was to study the gene 
expression changes in response to N concentration and rhizobia at cortex and 
pericycle. This could be achieved by producing transgenic lines expressing 
GFP in pericycle or cortex. Fluorescently-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)

presence. From left to right: Bands 2-10= control, 11-19= GFP.  
(Carter et al., 2013) could be used to isolate single cell types of interest 
(Figure 4-9). Gene expression changes of the root cortex or pericycle samples 
could be then studied using microarrays.  
M. truncatula var. Jemalong A17 were transformed to produce GFP-
marked pericycle or cortical cell type plant lines (Figure 4-9 a) using 
transformation methods explained in section 2.7 (Zhou et al., 2004). The lines 
were tested for the insertion of GFP by PCR (Figure 4-10). 
In order to have sufficient RNA (~80ng) for running microarray around 
2,000 plant cells need to be isolated by FACS. Although the GFP expression 
in early generations (T1 and T2) was strong and cell type specific but it was 
silenced in later generations (T3 and T4) so they could not be used for 
transcriptomic studies. Hence, it was not possible to continue the following 
studies at cell-specific level.  
4.5 Conclusion 
We have identified a total of 4793 genes that were differentially 
expressed at 0, 2 and 6 h post treatment with high N in -Rhiz and +Rhiz 
samples previously grown at low N for 14 days. This represented 7.4% of the 
genes annotated in the M. truncatula 3.5 gene model. The significantly 
expressed genes with FC>2 or FC<-2 were assigned to biological functional 
categories using MapMan to identify the main biological pathways controlled 
by N or rhizobia mediated N signals (Figure 4-7). Transport, metabolism and 
transcriptional regulation of root responses to N were among the biological 
functional categories showing the strongest responses to N (Figure 4-7 a) as 
this is also consistent with the data obtained in Arabidopsis (Canales et al., 
2014). The rhizobia mediated responses to N were mainly observed in 
transport, signaling, regulation of protein activity, and development functional 
categories (Figure 4-7 b).  
A model was generated for the biological functions regulated by N in the 
absence or presence of rhizobia (Figure 4-11 a) and also rhizobia mediated N

Figure 4-11: Candidate upregulated (blue) and down regulated (red) 
genes potentially involved in (a) N-regulated and (b) rhizobia-mediated N 
responses. These are genes that showed a significant response (FC>2 
or FC<-2) to N at 2 or 6 h after high N treatment in mock-inoculated (-
Rhiz) or rhizobia-inoculated (+Rhiz) in (a) or were significantly regulated 
(FC>2 or FC<-2) by rhizobia at low (0 h) or high (2 and 6 h) N in (b). In 
(a) the boxes pointing to the two red and opaque lines in the middle 
indicate that the genes are expressed in both -Rhiz and +Rhiz.  161	
responses at low or high N in A17 (Figure 4-11 b). The early (2 and 6 h) N 
responses in N-deprived plants provided with high N resulted in the induction 
of primary nitrate response genes (Figure 4-11 a). The two nitrate sensor and 
transporters NRT2.1 and NRT1.1 were one of the key players in this 
response. The strong induction (FC=2.5) of NRT1.1 only in the presence of 
rhizobia could be a regulatory response affecting the root phenotype at high N 
in rhizobia-inoculated plants. It seems that the non-nodulating plants (-Rhiz) 
grown under low N, showed a more enhanced primary nitrate response (e.g. 
induction of genes involved in N transport and assimilation, and amino acid 
metabolism) than the nodulating (+Rhiz) samples. Thus, this enhanced 
activity could be to compensate for the N deficiency they were facing. The 
stronger induction of ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (Table 4-4) involved in N 
assimilation and the higher number of amino acid metabolism genes in -Rhiz 
could be an indication of this enhanced response. Distinct sets of TFs were 
involved in the regulation of N responses in high N (2 and 6 h) treated rhizobia 
inoculated and mock inoculated plants (Figure 4-8 c and Figure 4-11 a) and 
also rhizobia-regulated responses at low and high N (Figure 4-8 d and Figure 
4-11 b). Some of the TFs were however similar between different conditions 
with variations in their expression. The strong N-suppression of the circadian 
clock-associated protein 1a (Medtr8g077420.1) that was related to the 
duration of high N treatment and independent of rhizobia confirms the results 
from other studies that this TF could be one of the regulators of the N 
assimilation (Gutirrez et al., 2008, McClung, 2006). The N-responsive 
expression changes of WRKY44 (FC>2) and WRKY5 (FC<-2) TFs exclusively 
in the absence of rhizobia may be indicative of their involvement in N 
responses in N-deprived plants when N is available. 
Significant expression changes in some of the genes involved in 
different pathways related to development and regulation (TFs, hormonal 
regulation and signaling) indicates enhanced developmental activities early (2 
and 6 h) after treatment with high N. Strong induction (FC>2) of some of the 
TCA cycle enzymes and proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism 
specifically TCA carbonic anhydrases (Medtr5g066060) in both non-
nodulating and nodulating plants could be to provide the necessary carbon 
and energy pool for the enhanced metabolic and developmental activities due 
to N availability (Figure 4-11). The rhizobia induction and enhanced 
expression of two cysteine proteinases (Medtr5g022560.1 and AC233675 
19.1) that are known as senescence markers and two sugar and ammonium 
transporters (Medtr6g006140.1 and Medtr7g098930.1 respectively) in 6 h 
high N treated plants may be indicative of early stages of a premature 
senescence to inhibit nodulation in order to use the carbon and energy 
sources for other developmental activities when enough N is available (Figure 
4-11). 
Changes in the RSA are under the control of N availability. N is also one 
of the key factors controlling the balance between the number and activity of 
nodules and LR development. Here we have identified some of the 
components of this regulatory complex (Figure 4-11). The two TCA carbonic 
anhydrases Medtr3g077910 and Medtr3g077940 could be involved in 
regulating the number of nodules because of their strong (3 < FC < 7) rhizobia 
induction at low N and not at high N (2 and 6 h). The expression level of these 
enzymes could be related to the level of nodule development and functioning 
in N-deprived plants. They may function to provide the necessary 
photoassimilates for the nodule activity and provide carbohydrates to the 
bacteroids in the active nodules. The rhizobia-dependent expression of 
bHLH96 TF (strong rhizobia induction at low N and strong N-suppression in 
+Rhiz) could suggest that this TF may be involved in the regulation of 
nodulation or LR development. The strong rhizobia-induction (FC>2) of 6 
NCR peptides only at low N could make them some key players in the 
nodulation pathway (Table 4-6 b). A small group of NCRs also showed strong 
rhizobia-induction (FC>2) specifically at high N (Table 4-6 c and d) making 
them putative regulators/inhibitors of nodule development at high N. These 
NCRs could be also candidates for the rhizobia-mediated LR development 
observed at high N condition (Figure 4-1). The strong N-suppression (FC<-3) 
of GA 20-oxidase 2 and 3 that was independent of the presence or absence 
of rhizobia and was related to the duration of high N treatment may be related 
to their regulatory role in LR development at high N condition. 
A model was also proposed for the rhizobia mediated response to low N 
in the rhizobia-inoculated plants grown under high N condition (Figure 4-12). 
The predominant (83%) suppression of the genes with significant expressed 
changes (FC>2 or FC<-2) suggests the activation of a local N signal for 
decreasing biological activities at low N condition. NRT2.1 that is strongly 
induced by low N (FC>2) could be acting as a signal molecule in regulating 
this early response to low N and the strong suppression (FC<-2) of nitrate 
reductase also suggests the decrease in N assimilation at low N. The 
significant expression of BEE2 TF and two enzymes involved in auxin and 
ABA metabolism may be indicative of the hormonal cross talk between BR 
and auxin and also between BR and ABA in controlling the number of nodules 
and LR development. ABA regulates the expression of BEE2 TF that is one of 
the regulators of BR response. BR is involved in controlling the number of 
nodules and LR development by the positive effect it has on polar auxin 
transport and accumulation. 
The significantly expressed genes (FC>2 and FC<-2) identified by 
studying the gene expression changes in response to high N (0, 2 and 6 h 
time points) and rhizobia (Figure 4-11) could be involved in regulating root 
development and nodulation at high N (Figure 4-1). Some of the components 
of AON for controlling the number of nodules are also involved in regulating 
LR development. Thus, gene expression changes in response to N (low and 
high) and rhizobia were compared between A17 and sunn-1 mutant. This 
mutant is impaired in the correct AON signals that lead to hypernodulating 
phenotype with short LRs at low N. This study aimed to identify (1) genes 
showing N and/or rhizobia regulated responses (these could be putative AON 
regulators also involved in the balance between LR and nodule development), 
(2) genes showing significant SUNN-mediated expression changes in 
response to N and rhizobia, (3) biological pathways involved in the cross talk 
between AON and LR development. In chapter 5 these studies will be 
discussed in detail.

Results: Analysis of hypernodulation mutant 
sunn-1 implicates balancing genes to regulate LR 
development  
Analysis of M. truncatula A17 (chapter 3 and 4; (Bonyadi Pour et al., 
2014 In Prep) in this study and other comparable research (Mathesius, 2003) 
suggest that factors such as rhizobia and N level can affect both nodulation 
and LR development. This effect could be at the level of cross talk between 
signaling and developmental pathways, possibly mediated by genetic or 
protein-protein interactions. For example, high levels of N in the soil or in the 
plant inhibits the formation of nodules via AON mechanisms, controlled by 
super numeric nodules (MtSUNN) in M. truncatula A17 (Schnabel et al., 
2005), and Hypernodulation Aberrant Root formation (LjHAR1) in L. japonicus 
(Wopereis et al., 2000).  This thesis has shown that in A17 the presence of 
rhizobia at high levels of N that inhibit nodulation also represses PR and LR 
development (chapter 3 and Figure 4-1). This suggests tight coregulation of 
LR and nodule formation, with connection of gene regulatory pathways a likely 
mechanism underlying this. There are studies suggesting that AON genes 
could be candidates for regulating LR development in response to N (Jin et 
al., 2012). A17 and the hypernodulating mutant sunn-1 that is impaired in 
correct AON responses (Van Noorden et al., 2006) exhibit different responses 
to low and high N concentrations and rhizobia inoculation (Jin et al., 2012). 
This mutant has a defect in regulating the number of root organs due to 
increased shoot to root auxin transport compared to the wild-type (Van 
Noorden et al., 2006). We have utilized the sunn-1 mutant because of its 
hypernodulating phenotype and short LRs at low N and the ability to nodulate 
at high N to compare the responses of this mutant with A17 at low and high N 
and in response to rhizobia. This could give us an understanding of how 
SUNN could be involved in changing root architecture to balance LR 
development with nodule formation according to the plant N supply.  
5.1 Characterizing SUNN mediated changes on root architecture in 
response to N and rhizobia  
To compare sunn-1 root architecture changes to low and high N and 
rhizobia inoculation with A17, -Rhiz and +Rhiz plants were grown at low (0.1 
mM) and high (5 mM) N and root attributes (Figure 2-2) of 2 biological 
replicates (n=6 plants per replicate) were measured at 14 dpi (Figure 3-1). 
Square root transformation was applied on the data and REML (P<0.05) was 
used to study the effect of genotype, N concentration, rhizobia inoculation and 
the interaction of between these main effects on root development and 
nodulation (Table 5-1). 
The study shows that at low N the number of nodules was significantly 
(P<0.05) higher in sunn-1 compared to A17 (Figure 5-1 a) and it was affected 
(P<0.05) by genotype and N concentration (Table 5-1). Genotype, N 
concentration and rhizobia also had significant (P<0.05) effect on root 
development (Table 5-1). There was a significant (P<0.05) genotype effect on 
PR length, average of LR length and LR number. The effect of N 
concentration was significant (P<0.05) on LR development (LR total length 
and LR number). Rhizobia effect on root development was also significant 
(P<0.05) on PR length, average of LR length, LR total length, LR number and 
root total size (Table 5-1).    
The mean values for different root attributes in +Rhiz and -Rhiz samples 
at low and high N were compared between A17 and sunn-1 using a two 
sample Students t-test at 5% significance level. The results showed that the 
difference between A17 and sunn-1 root phenotype was significant (P<0.05)

between +Rhiz samples (as also confirmed by REML showing significant 
(P<0.05) rhizobia effect on root development and nodule number).  
In A17, the rhizobia effect on root development was not significant at low 
N (chapter 3). At high N rhizobia significantly (P<0.05) affected root 
development in A17. The total root size was significantly (P<0.01) less in 
+Rhiz compared to -Rhiz and this was due to significantly (P<0.01) shorter 
PR, smaller LR total length and less LR in number. The response of sunn-1 to 
low and high N and rhizobia inoculation was different from A17. At low N, LRs 
were shorter in nodulating sunn-1 samples compared to A17, which was 
specific to nodulating plants, not in -Rhiz samples. Average of LR length was 
significantly (P<0.01) less in +Rhiz sunn-1 compared to A17 at low N. This 
was because of a smaller (P<0.05) LR total length and not due to the number 
of LRs (Figure 5-1 b). There was not a significant (P<0.05) difference in LR 
number (Figure 5-1 b) and PR length (Table 5-1 b) at low N between sunn-1 
and A17.  
At high N that nodulation is inhibited in A17, sunn-1 had the ability to 
nodulated but the number of nodules were significantly (P<0.05) less in high 
N compared to low (Figure 5-1 a). Total root size was significantly (P<0.05) 
higher in nodulating sunn-1 samples compared to A17 because of a 
significantly (P<0.01) longer PR and higher (P<0.05) LR total length. The 
average of LR length was significantly (P<0.01) less in +Rhiz sunn-1 
compared to A17 at high N suggesting that higher total LR length in sunn-1 
was due to a higher number of LRs (average of LR length is less in sunn-1).  
The shorter LRs and hypernodulation in the presence of rhizobia at low 
N in sunn-1 compared to A17 and longer PR, higher LR total length (smaller 
average of LR length) and higher number of LRs at high N could suggest a 
balancing effect for SUNN on nodulation and root development specifically in 
the presence of rhizobia as also reported in a study looking at the involvement 
of SUNN in root architecture responses to N (Jin et al., 2012). 
The N content in root and shoot of +Rhiz and -Rhiz samples of A17 and 
sunn-1 at low and high N was measured by estimating the free nitrate and 
total N. A17 and sunn-1 +Rhiz and -Rhiz plants in 3 biological replicates 
(n=54) were grown under low and high (Figure 3-1) and at 14 dpi wet and dry 
weight of root and shoots measured. The 3 replicates were pooled together to 
provide enough plant material for the N measurements. Free nitrate was 
measured in root and shoot and enough samples were available to measure 
total N only in the shoot. The data obtained from these measurements could 
not be used for studying N acquisition efficiency (Moreau et al., 2012) in A17 
and sunn-1 due to lack of enough biological replicates.  
  REML (P<0.05) was applied on the Log10 transformed root dry weight 
(representing the root surface area) and shoot dry weight to study the effect of 
genotype, N concentration, rhizobia inoculation and the interaction between 
these main effects (Table 5-2 and figure 5-2). This analysis showed that there 
was a significant (P<0.05) genotype effect on shoot and root dry weight. 
Shoot dry weight was also significantly (P<0.05) affected by N concentration 
and the interaction between N concentration and rhizobia. Effects of rhizobia, 
N concentration and the interaction between the three main factors were 
significant (P<0.05) on root dry weight (Table 5-2). The comparison of mean 
values for root and shoot dry weight between A17 and sunn-1 using Student t-
test (P<0.05) showed that there was no significant difference in the root area 
between A17 and sunn-1 at low or high N in -Rhiz or +Rhiz samples (Figure 
5-2). Thus, irrespective of significantly (P<0.05) higher number of nodules in 
sunn-1 compared to A17 (at low and high N) there is not a significant (P<0.05) 
difference between their root areas. This shows that there is tight control on 
the allocation of carbon resources for LR and nodule development in the root 
and the hypernodulation in sunn-1 is balanced with inhibition of LR elongation 
(Figure 5-1). 
Concentration of shoot and root free nitrate and shoot total N in A17 and 
sunn-1 samples were similar at low N (Figure 5-3). This could suggest that 
hypernodulation at low N had no effect on the N content of root or shoot. This

is because in hypernodulating mutants the nitrogen capacity per nodule is 
reduced. Hence, despite having a higher number of nodules compared to the 
wild type, they do not fix more nitrogen (Mortier et al., 2012b). In A17, free 
nitrate concentration was higher in the shoot in +Rhiz samples at high N 
compared to low N and compared to sunn-1 (Figure 5-3). This could be one of 
the reasons for smaller root size (shorter PR and LR length with a smaller 
number of LRs) in the presence of rhizobia at high N. LR elongation and 
development is inhibited by the systemic signaling pathways controlling LR 
development based on shoot N status (Forde, 2014).  
5.2 Whole genome expression profiling identifies rhizobia and SUNN 
regulated low and high N responses in A17 and sunn-1  
The response of A17 and sunn-1 to low and high N concentration and 
rhizobia is different. This response is more enhanced in +Rhiz sunn-1 plants 
at low N (Figure 5-4). In low N sunn-1 produces a significantly higher number 
of nodules but LR length is shorter compared to A17. Changes in A17 and 
sunn-1 root architecture under low (0.1 mM) and high (5 mM) N suggest a 
regulatory effect for rhizobia on root architecture. It also suggests that SUNN 
could be involved in regulating LR length as also reported in other studies (Jin 
et al., 2012).  
Genome-wide expression profiling (with microarrays) was used to study 
gene expression changes affect by low or high N and rhizobia inoculation in 
A17 and sunn-1 grown under N deprivation (low N, 0.1 mM) condition (Figure 
5-4). Rhizobia inoculated (+Rhiz) and mock-inoculated (-Rhiz) seedlings of 
A17 and sunn-1 were grown at low N (NH4NO3 0.1 mM) then at 14 dpi treated 
with high (5 mM) or low (0.1 mM) N for 6 h (Figure 5-5 a). Analysis of the 
microarray data (Figure 5-5 b) identified a list of candidate genes regulating 
nodule number and LR development according to the plant N status, by 
implicating gene expression variation in the control of root and nodule 
phenotype variation between sunn-1 and A17 (Figure 5-4).

5.2.1 Quality control and normalization 
The steps taken for quality control and normalization of the data was as 
previously used (section 4.1). Samples in 3 biological replicates with 3 repeats 
for each biological replicate (n=6 plants per plate = 1 repeat) were treated as 
in Figure 5-5 a. Roots of 3 plants from each repeat were harvested for each 
biological replicate (n=9 plants). The labeled cDNA samples were assigned to 
the microarrays roughly at random. The distribution of the XYS expression 
values before and after normalization (using the RMA algorithm (Carvalho, 
2010)) were plotted as box plots and smoothed histograms (Figure 5-6 a-h) to 
compare the distribution between the data sets for identifying the level of 
skewness and variability to gain an overview of the quality of the data. The 
histograms and boxplots for A17 and sunn-1 showed that after normalization 
the data sets were following almost a similar distribution and there were no 
outliers.  
 Expression levels of the normalised data were compared (between 
replicates and across the data set) using Pearsons r correlation coefficients 
and the correlations were plotted as a heatmaps (Figure 5-6 i and j). The pair-
wise comparisons of the data samples for A17 (Figure 5-6 i) and sunn-1 
(Figure 5-6 j) showed that there was a strong correlation between microarray 
replicate sets. This is indicated by predominant green coloration in the 
heatmaps (Figure 5-6 i and j) for a row or column with correlation ranging 
between 0.935  r  0.993 with average r = 0.972 for A17 samples and 0.930 
 r  0.992 with average r = 0.965 for sunn-1 samples. This strong expression 
comparison of the replicates and arrays confirmed the good quality of the data 
hence all replicates were used for further analysis. 
5.2.2 Identifying genes with significant expression changes  
Differentially expressed genes were identified using the GaGa algorithm 
(Rossell, 2009). The groups each A17 or sunn-1 samples belonged to (each 
in 3 replicates) were defined as in Figure 5-5 a. Patterns of comparisons 
between treatments were generated separately for the following groups (16

A17 (i.e. ACLL, ACLH, ARLL, ARLH) and sunn-1 (i.e. SCLL, SCLH, SRLL, 
SRLH); -Rhiz (i.e. ACLL, ACLH, SCLL, SCLL) or +Rhiz (ARLL, ARLH, SRLL, 
SRLH) samples of A17 and sunn-1 treated with low or high N. A GaGa model 
with a significance cutoff of P<0.05 was then applied to each group separately 
to identify the genes differentially expressed under the experiment conditions. 
These lists were amalgamated to generate a list of differentially expressed 
genes responding to low or high N treatment in the absence or presence of 
rhizobia in A17 and sunn-1 backgrounds.  
 From a total of 64123 genes in the Mt3.5 gene model, 47529 genes 
were tested on the Nimblegen Mt3.5 custom expression array, of which 7186 
genes showed significant gene expression changes under the experimental 
condition (Figure 5-5 a). This representing 15% of the genes on the array 
annotated in the M. truncatula 3.5 gene model. 
5.2.3 Clusters of gene expression changes identifies a strong 
interaction between AON and rhizobia effects 
An overview of the responses of A17 and sunn-1 to rhizobia inoculation 
and low or high N treatment was gained by studying clusters of gene 
expression patterns. The RMA normalised expression values of the 
differential expressed genes were used to cluster these genes into 33 clusters 
(Figure 5-7). Silhouette statistics (Leonard and Peter, 1990) in MatLab was 
used to determine the number of clusters. This function takes various 
silhouette statistics for a series of sequentially increasing cluster partitions 
and plots them. The cluster partition with negative silhouette values minus 1 
determines the number of clusters.  
The average expression level within each cluster was then plotted as a 
heatmap (Figure 5-7 a). Patterns of gene expression changes in each cluster 
were studied to identify (1) the effect of high N treatment in the absence or 
presence of rhizobia in A17 and sunn-1, (2) whether the A17 and sunn-1 
responses to high N are similar or differ in -Rhiz and +Rhiz, (3) the effect

of rhizobia inoculation at low N and high N, and how this might differ between 
A17 and sunn-1 (4) the effect of sunn-1 in -Rhiz or +Rhiz samples treated with 
high or low N.  
The position of sample types in the clustering of all differentially 
expressed genes (Figure 5-7 a) shows that +Rhiz and -Rhiz samples of both 
A17 and sunn-1 were clustered separately into two main clusters (branches i 
and ii in Figure 5-7 a) suggesting that rhizobia had a stronger effect on gene 
expression changes under the experiment conditions (Figure 5-5 a) than 
either genotype or N effect (branches i1-2 and ii1-2 in Figure 5-7 a). Within 
each +Rhiz and -Rhiz clade, low or high N treated A17 and sunn-1 samples 
also formed separate clusters (branches i1-2 and ii1-2 in Figure 5-7 a) 
suggesting that the genotype effect was the next strongest. Hence, N showed 
to have a comparably more minor effect on gene expression changes of 
whole root samples of A17 and sunn-1 under the experimental conditions. 
The clustering on the vertical axis of the heatmap (Figure 5-7 a) also 
shows 5 main response patterns to rhizobia inoculation and low or high N 
treatment in A17 and sunn-1 (branches A-E in figure 5-7 a). The average of 
gene expression levels is lower in the clusters in branches A and B compared 
to clusters in other branches. Branch C contains clusters with the highest 
expression levels compared to clusters in other branches. Interesting gene 
expression patterns in these clusters (for example clusters 9 and 11) could 
explain the phenotype observed in rhizobia and high N treated A17 and sunn-
1 samples.  
Clusters in branch C mainly contain genes involved in N responses and 
LR and nodule developmental and regulatory pathways. As shown in the 
heatmap in Figure 5-7 a, in clusters 9 and 11 gene expression level is 
distinctively different in rhizobia inoculated sunn-1 samples treated with low or 
high N from the other treated samples. This could indicate a SUNN effect in 
the presence of rhizobia and independent of N. As also observed in the 
phenotyping experiments that at low N sunn-1 hypernodulated but developed 
shorter LRs than A17 and at high N developed shorter LRs but more in 
number (Figure 5-1). 
The gene expression behavior in cluster 9 affected by rhizobia, high or 
low N treatment in the +/-Rhiz and SUNN effect at these conditions could suit 
with finding candidate genes and could also explain the observed root 
phenotype (Figure 5-1). In this cluster with 2463 genes (Figure 5-7 b), A17 
and sunn-1 showed opposite responses to high N treatment in both -Rhiz and 
+Rhiz. The gene expression levels decreased in A17 in response to high N 
treatment both in -Rhiz and +Rhiz while it was increased in sunn-1. This is in 
agreement with the phenotypic experiments where RSA response to high N 
was different in seedlings of A17 and sunn-1 (Figure 5-1). For cluster 9, +Rhiz 
samples of A17 and sunn-1 gene expression level was lower than -Rhiz, both 
at low and high N. Suggesting that rhizobia had a similar effect on the trend of 
gene expression changes independent of genotype or N treatment. In this 
cluster the average of expression level is similar between A17 and sunn-1 in 
non-nodulating (-Rhiz) samples, especially in high N, but sunn-1 samples 
show a lower expression level than A17 in +Rhiz. This could suggest that the 
SUNN effect is stronger in rhizobia inoculated samples irrespective of the N 
condition and treatment.  
In cluster 11 (1505 genes) (Figure 5-7 b), high N treatment seemed to 
have no significant effect on gene expression levels of +Rhiz or -Rhiz 
samples in either A17 or sunn-1. The rhizobia effect was similar in both A17 
and sunn-1 although sunn-1 showed a stronger response to rhizobia. Genes 
in the cluster in sunn-1 had a higher gene expression level compared to A17 
in both low and high treatments and this was more prominent in the presence 
of rhizobia as shown in Figure 5-7 b. This may suggest a SUNN effect that is 
more dependent on the rhizobia effect than N effect. 
In branch D cluster 8 (with 1398 genes) both A17 and sunn-1 show 
distinctive clustering between +Rhiz and -Rhiz with higher gene expression 
levels in +Rhiz, indicative of a prominent rhizobia effect in this cluster that is 
independent of N or genotype (Figure 5-7). The similar response to rhizobia 
appears to be independent of genotype or N effect. Gene expression levels 
are also the same between the two genotypes in +/-Rhiz at low or high N. The 
fact that the majority of the genes in this cluster are involved in the nodulation 
pathway (e.g. ENOD18, nodule inception protein and the nodule specific 
cysteine rich peptides) could indicate that this effect could be driven by 
nodulation genes.   
5.2.4 Identifying genes having the strongest responses to rhizobia and 
low or high N treatment in A17 and sunn-1 
To identify genes having the strongest responses to low or high N 
treatment or/and affected by rhizobia or/and genotype, FC of the expression 
values of the differentially expressed genes were calculated and genes with 
log2 FC of >2 or <-2 were identified. This was carried out to identify the (1) 
effect of high N treatment in the absence or presence of rhizobia, (2) rhizobia 
effect at low N (3) rhizobia effect at high N and (4) SUNN effect at low or high 
N in -Rhiz or +Rhiz samples (Table 5-3). To identify genes strongly affected 
by high N treatment (post N deprivation) the FC between ACLL and ACLH 
(high N effect in the absence of rhizobia in A17), ARLL and ARLH (high N 
effect in the presence of rhizobia in A17), SCLL and SCLH (high N effect in 
the absence of rhizobia in sunn-1), and SRLL and SRLH (high N effect in the 
presence of rhizobia in sunn-1) were calculated. For the effect of rhizobia at 
low N (i.e. N deprived samples treated with the same low N concentration) FC 
between ACLL and ARLL in A17, and SCLL and SRLL in sunn-1 were 
calculated. The effect of rhizobia at high N (N deprived samples treated with 
high N) was studied by calculating FC between ACLH and ARLH in A17, and 
SCLH and SRLH in sunn-1. For the effect of SUNN in N deprived samples 
treated with the same low N concentration FC between ACLL and SCLL (for 
the absence of rhizobia) and ARLL and SRLL (for the presence of rhizobia) 
were calculated. FC between the absence of rhizobia (ACLH and SCLH) and 
the presence of rhizobia (ARLH and SRLH) were calculated to study the effect 
of SUNN in N deprived samples treated with high N (Table 5-3). The number

Table 5-3: Group of samples that were compared together to calculate

correlate to the experimental design in figure 5-5.  
of genes showing significant expression changes in response to the above 
effects is shown in Table 5-4.  
Analysing of strongest FC responses showed that A17 and sunn-1 had 
different response to high N in the absence or presence of rhizobia. However, 
as also observed in the cluster studies, the N effect was not strong compared 
to rhizobia and genotype effect. From 7186 genes that were identified as 
differentially expressed under the experimental conditions (Figure 5-5 a) 3 
genes showed significant (FC>2 or FC<-2) expression changes in response to 
high N treatment in -Rhiz in A17 (with 100% being upregulated). This number 
was the same in +Rhiz samples but with a different N-response than -Rhiz 
(with 100% downregulated). The high N-response was different in sunn-1 
compared to A17 with a dominant high N-suppression (92% downregulated) 
and a higher number of differentially expressed genes (64 genes) showing 
significant expression changes (FC>2 or FC<-2) under high N treatment in -
Rhiz. In +Rhiz no differentially expressed genes showed significant 
expression changes (FC>2 or FC<-2) in sunn-1.  
Rhizobia regulated responses to low or high N was stronger in both A17 
and sunn-1 and a higher number of differentially expressed genes had strong 
(FC>2 or FC<-2) expression changes. Looking at the rhizobia regulated 
response at low N shows that, 574 differentially expressed genes were 
significantly (FC>2 or FC<-2) affected by rhizobia in A17 (99% induced) and 
849 genes in sunn-1 (80% induced). This number of regulated differentially 
expressed genes was almost the same (8% in A17 and 14% in sunn-1) at 
high N of which 100% were N-induced in A17 and 83% in sunn-1.  
The number of N-regulated or rhizobia regulated genes in response to N 
in A17 and sunn-1 (Table 5-5) indicates that the predominant effect was a 
rhizobia effect (independent of N) and that the (more minor) rhizobia-
regulated response to N was stronger in sunn-1 than A17. These all could 
explain the different root phenotype and nodulation behavior A17 and sunn-1 
show at low and high N in the absence and presence of rhizobia (Figure 5-1).

Table 5-4: The number of differentially expressed genes of A17 and 
sunn-1 that show significant (FC>1 or FC<-1) expression changes in 
response to the effects in table 5-3.  
Studying the effect of SUNN at low or high N in the absence or presence 
of rhizobia again shows that the prominent rhizobia effect is independent of 
the N concentration. The number of significantly (FC>2 or FC<-2) affected 
differentially expressed genes was higher in +Rhiz samples both at low N 
(418, 31% upregulated) and high N (274 genes, 57% upregulated). This 
compares to the effect of SUNN in -Rhiz: 58 differentially expressed genes 
were significantly differentially expressed at low N (78% upregulated) with 31 
genes significantly differentially expressed at high N (29% upregulated). The 
higher number of putative SUNN-regulated genes that was observed at low N 
in +Rhiz (418 genes), most of which were putatively repressed by SUNN 
(69%) could be linked/controlling the hypernodulating phenotype and short 
LRs observed at low N in +Rhiz samples (Figure 5-4). These genes may 
function in the pathways that regulate the number of nodules and balance LR 
development with nodulation. To evaluate this hypothesis, the following 
sections describe analysis of some of the putative regulators and TFs that 
may be involved in these regulatory pathways. 
5.2.5 Rhizobia and SUNN mediated responses to low and high N 
affecting RSA 
To interpret the genomic expression data in the context of known 
biological processes or pathways, groups of differentially expressed genes 
showing the strongest (FC>2 or FC<-2) rhizobia or/and SUNN mediated 
responses to low and high N in A17 and sunn-1 (Tables 5-3 and 5-4) were 
assigned to different pathways and functional categories using the MapMan 
software (Thimm et al., 2004). This analysis used Wilcoxon test with 
Benjamini-Hochberg correction to identify functional categories (bins and sub-
bins) statistically different from other categories. Based on this analysis, 
significantly different (P<0.05) functional categories (Table 5-5) that could be 
involved in rhizobia and SUNN responses to N were selected for further study. 
Additionally, some other functional categories (as in Figure 5-8) with a higher 
P value were also selected because of their abundance of genes and  
Table 55: Rhizobia-regulated (a) and SUNN-regulated (b) biological 
categories as analysed by Mapman (Wilcoxon rank sum test with 
Benjamini-Hochberg corrected; P < 0.05). Elements= number of genes 
in each category, -Rhiz= absence of rhizobia (mock-inoculated), +Rhiz= 
presence of rhizobia (rhizobia inoculated); high N= treated with 5 mM N, 
low N= treated with low N (0.1 mM).

Figure 5-8: Main biological functional categories of the genes showing 
strong (a) rhizobia-regulated or (b) SUNN-regulated response to low and 
high N in A17 and sunn-1 (FC >2 or FC <-2) defined by MapMan 
software (Thimm et al., 2004). The horizontal axis shows the number of 
genes in each category and numbers on top of each bar is the 
percentage of upregulated genes. The nodulin category is not one of the 
default functional categories in MapMan and all nodulins are assigned to 
this category manually. Table 5-5  contains Wilcoxon rank sum test P 
values for each functional category (Functional categories with P > 0.05 
are not included in the table). -Rhiz= absence of rhizobia (mock-
inoculated), +Rhiz= presence of rhizobia (rhizobia inoculated); high N=

significance in rhizobia and SUNN responses to N (as they will be discussed 
further in this section).  
Based on the abundance of genes in MapMan functional categories, the main 
rhizobia regulated N responses belonged to nodulation, development, 
transport and regulatory functions including regulation of protein activity, 
regulation of RNA transcription and signaling (Figure 5-8 a). All nodulins that 
by default were not assigned to a known functional category by MapMan were 
included in a new category named nodulins (Figure 5-8). SUNN regulated 
responses to N were mainly stronger (higher number of differentially 
expressed genes with FC>2 or FC<-2) in the presence of rhizobia and 
especially at low N (Figure 5-8 b). Based on the abundance of genes in each 
category it appears that regulation of protein activity, regulation of RNA 
transcription, hormone metabolism and signaling was among the strongest 
responses regulated by SUNN. 
5.2.5.1 Putative components of regulatory pathways balancing nodule 
number with LR development according to N availability 
The phenotypic analysis presented earlier in this chapter suggests that 
the sunn-1 mutant is a suitable candidate for studying the balance between 
nodule organogenesis and LR development in Medicago. At low N an 
interaction between regulation of nodule number and LR development was 
found in sunn-1: resource/carbon use for hypernodulation is putatively 
balanced by production of shorter LRs. At high N, sunn-1 plants still have the 
ability to nodulate unlike in A17 where nodulation is inhibited, however the 
number of nodules is significantly less at high N. LR development also shows 
some differences between A17 and sunn-1 at high N with shorter but more 
LRs in sunn-1.  
Combined with the expression data analysis of significantly responding 
genes, we propose that under low N a mechanism exists to balance nodules 
and LRs, mediated by sunn-1. Here we try to identify some of the genes that 
may be involved in this balance by identifying differentially expressed genes 
that show significant (FC>2 or FC<-2) rhizobia mediated expression changes 
and also by studying the differentially expressed genes that are strongly 
(FC>2 or FC<-2) affected by SUNN in low N. To provide a comparison 
between low and high N, responses at high N are also studied.   
In both low and high N a higher number of differentially expressed genes 
showed significant (FC>2 or FC<-2) rhizobia-regulated responses in sunn-1 
compared to A17 (Table 5-4). Using MapMan (Thimm et al., 2004) biological 
functional categories indicates that aside from nodulins, the differentially 
expressed genes showing significant (FC>2 or FC<-2) expression changes 
were mainly involved in transport and regulation (signaling, regulation of 
protein activity and TFs) (Figure 5-8 a) in both low and high N.  
SUNN-mediated responses were stronger in the presence of rhizobia 
with a higher number of differentially expressed genes showing strong (FC>2 
or FC<-2) expression changes in both low and high N (Table 5-4). Based on 
the gene abundance in different biological functional categories (Figure 5-8 b) 
genes involved in regulation (signaling and regulation of protein activity) and 
stress were more affected by SUNN-regulation in the presence of rhizobia at 
low N than genes with other biological functions. At high N, regulation 
(signaling and regulation of protein activity) and transport functional 
categories had the highest number of SUNN-regulated genes in the presence 
of rhizobia (Figure 5-8 b).  
These results could suggest that the hypernodulating phenotype and 
short LRs in sunn-1 at low N may be mainly the result of fine tuned regulatory 
cross talk between rhizobia regulated nodulins, TFs, regulation of protein 
activities and signaling and SUNN-regulated signaling, regulation of protein 
activity and stress responses (Figure 5-9 and 5-11).

categories that based on the Wilcoxon rank sum test (P < 0.05) and/or

SUNN-regulated transcripts may be the key components of the 
hypernodulating phenotype with short LRs in sunn-1 at low N.  
the rhizobia-regulated genes at both low and high N in A17 and sunn-1 
(Figure 5-8 a). Aside from two nodulins in sunn-1 they were all rhizobia-
induced at low and high N and mainly belonged to the NCR protein family (as 
discussed earlier in chapter 4). At low N these genes were more highly 
expressed in A17 compared to sunn-1 (Table 5-6). 
NCR 172 (Medtr6g045150.1), NCR 181 (Medtr1g011310.1), NCR 122 
(Medtr7g071720.2) and Late nodulin (Medtr6g044700.1) are examples of 
some differentially expressed nodulins (Table 5-3) that had a higher rhizobia-
induced expression change in A17 than sunn-1 at low N. This decrease in the 
expression level of nodulins in sunn-1 at low N could be suggestive of their 
role in AON for controlling the number of nodules. Changes in the expression 
levels of the SUNN-regulated differentially expressed nodulins (FC>2 or FC<-
2) in the absence and presence of rhizobia at low N could be also indicative of 
the role nodulins could have in AON. Some of these differentially expressed 
nodulins that had the highest rhizobia-regulated expression changes were 
also significantly (FC>2 or FC<-2) SUNN-induced in the absence of rhizobia 
at low N.  
SUNN-regulated expression of the differentially expressed nodulins in 
low N was found to be dependent on the presence or absence of rhizobia 
since in -Rhiz a higher number of differentially expressed nodulins showed 
significant (FC>2 or FC<-2) SUNN-regulated responses compared to +Rhiz 
(Figure 5-8 b). The regulatory effect was also opposite: in -Rhiz 100% of 
nodulins were SUNN-induced but in +Rhiz 86% of the nodulins were SUNN-
repressed (FC<-2). The differentially expressed nodulins that showed strong 
(FC>2 or FC<-2) SUNN-regulated response at low N were different in -Rhiz 
and +Rhiz (Table 5-7 a and b). Nodulin 25 (Medtr3g055440), NCR 333 
(Medtr4g033900.2) and NCR 172 (Medtr6g045150.1) had the strongest 
(3<FC<4) SUNN-induced response in -Rhiz at low N. Early nodulin-like 
protein 3 (Medtr5g006040.1), NCR 146 (Medtr1g075500.1) and Nodulin-like 
protein (Medtr1g099010.1) showed the strongest (-3<FC<-2) SUNN-
repressed response in +Rhiz at low N. This higher number of SUNN-induced

nodulins in the absence of rhizobia and the fact that the number of 
significantly (FC>2 or FC<-2) SUNN-regulated nodulins in the presence of 
rhizobia was around 4 times less and predominantly repressed may indicate 
that these separate sets of nodulins are affected by rhizobia and could be 
involved in AON and possibly the rhizobia mediated effect on LR length. 
Some differentially expressed NCRs such as NCR 90 
(Medtr5g070410.1), NCR 181 (Medtr1g011310.1), NCR 318 
(Medtr4g031430.1) that were strongly rhizobia-induced (4<FC<8) in both 
genotypes at low and high N, did not show a huge variation in their expression 
levels between low and high N in A17. However there was about a two times 
increase in their expression level at high N compared to low N in sunn-1.  
There was no variation in the expression changes of some nodulins 
such as MtN20 protein (Medtr7g086040.1) and MtN11 protein 
(AC146565_34.1) between A17 and sunn-1 in response to rhizobia at low N 
but at high N their expression level was about 2 times higher in sunn-1 than 
A17 (Table 5-3). Such variations in the rhizobia-regulated expression levels of 
these nodulins between A17 and sunn-1 at low and high N may suggest that 
they may be involved in controlling the number of nodules according to the 
plant N status.   
5.2.5.1.2  Putative Regulators of the AON 
TFs play a critical role in different biological pathways by negative or 
positive regulation of the expression of relevant genes. The number of 
rhizobia-regulated (FC>2 or FC<-2) differentially expressed TFs in sunn-1 
was around three times higher than A17 at low N. This number was also 
higher in sunn-1 at high N however a higher percentage of TFs were induced 
in A17 (Figure 5-8 a).  
A higher percentage of the differentially expressed TFs showed strong 
(FC<-2) rhizobia-repressed response at low N in sunn-1 (43%) than A17 (only 
8%). These TFs may be involved in regulation of the expression of AON 
components at low N in nodulating plants and regulators of LR and nodule 
balance. At high N the number of rhizobia-induced TFs was greater, 
particularly in A17 where 100% of the TFs were upregulated (compared to 
76% upregulated in sunn-1). The SUNN-regulated effect on the expression of 
differentially expressed TFs at low N was rhizobia dependent and only in the 
presence of rhizobia they showed significant (FC>2 or FC<-2) expression 
changes (Figure 5-8 b and 5-10 b).  
 A higher number of differentially expressed WRKY TFs were affected by 
the rhizobia-regulated response at low N and also high N (FC>2 or FC<-2) 
than differentially expressed TFs from other families in sunn-1 (Figure 5-10 a). 
These WRKY TFs were significantly (FC>2 or FC<-2) differentially expressed 
at low and high N only in sunn-1 except for Medtr2g075610.1 that was also 
rhizobia-suppressed in A17 (FC=-2.2). Aside from WRKY 33 (FC=2.8) all 
these TFs were strongly (FC<-2) rhizobia-suppressed at low N. Members of 
the WRKY TF family act as activators and repressors in controlling several 
biological processes including development, immunity and stress responses 
(Rushton et al., 2010, Canales et al., 2014). The rhizobia-regulated response 
of the significantly expressed WRKY TFs could suggest that they may be 
among the key regulators involved in AON.  
Four differentially expressed WRKY TFs including WRKY 7 and 22 
along with some other differentially expressed TFs from TF families involved 
in plant growth, development and nodulation (Andriankaja et al., 2007, 
Carretero-Paulet et al., 2010, Godiard et al., 2011) such as bHLH 85 
(Medtr5g005110.1) and Ethylene-responsive TF (ERF) ERF026 
(Medtr1g101550.1) from the AP2/EREBP, APETALA2/Ethylene-responsive 
element binding protein family were rhizobia-suppressed only at low N (Table 
5-8). These TF families are among TFs involved in nodulation and the cross 
talk with the components of the signaling pathways to coordinate different 
steps of the nodulation pathway, from rhizobial infection to nodule 
organogenesis. The differentially expression of these TFs as rhizobia-
suppression only at low N could make them candidates involved in

transcriptional regulation during nodule and LR development in response to

The differentially expressed MYB TF (Medtr4g108430.1), MYB family 
TF-like protein (Medtr7g010210.1), WRKY 33 (FC=3.4), WRKY 73 (FC=2.2) 
and ERF 12 (Medtr7g085810.1) with FC=2.6 were among the significantly 
rhizobia-induced TFs only in sunn-1 at high N. The MYB domain TF family are 
key regulators in networks controlling development, metabolism and 
responses to biotic and abiotic stresses (Dubos et al., 2010). Considering the 
ability of sunn-1 to nodulate at high N and the regulatory roles of these TF 
families in development and response to biotic and abiotic stress these TFs 
could be candidates involved in controlling nodule formation according to N 
availability. This could be especially true for WRKY 33 and ERF 12. ERF 12 
was also significantly SUNN-induced (FC=2.5) only at high N in the presence 
of rhizobia and the SUNN-regulated response of WRKY 33 was rhizobia 
dependent, it was significantly induced (FC>3) at both low and high N only in 
the presence of rhizobia. These rhizobia dependent responses of ERF 12 and 
WRKY 33 at high N (rhizobia-induced in sunn-1 and SUNN-induced in the 
presence of rhizobia) could make them putative regulators of nodule formation 
according to the N status.  
In this study some of the components of the nodulation-signaling 
pathway that showed significant expression changes in response to rhizobia 
and SUNN at low N were identified (Figure 5-11). Because of their significant 
rhizobia or SUNN-regulated expression changes (as explained below) it was 
proposed that they might have putative roles in the AON (Figure 5-11). 
The differentially expressed LysM receptor kinase (Medtr5g086130.1) 
was SUNN-induced (FC=2) at low N in the presence of rhizobia. The 
differentially expressed calmodulin-like proteins 1, 4 and 5 (Medtr3g055570.1, 
Medtr3g055490.1, Medtr3g055510.1 respectively) were rhizobia-induced (2.3 
< FC < 6.8) at low and high N in both A17 and sunn-1 showing variation in 
their expression patterns between genotypes and different treatments (Table

Figure 5-11: A model for the main steps of nodulation signaling 
pathway. Proposed TFs, signaling genes and nodulins involved in the 
nodulation pathway with a putative role in AON are added to the 
model. These are chosen because of their significant (FC>2 or FC<-2) 
rhizobia-regulated response in sunn-1 or SUNN-regulated response in 
the presence of rhizobia (+Rhiz) at low N. The transcripts are shown 
as rectangles with orange (SUNN-regulated in the presence of 
rhizobia) or red (rhizobia-regulated at low N in sunn-1) lines and 
trapezoids (rhizobia-induced with a lower expression level in sunn-1 
compared to A17) filled with blue (induced) or red (repressed) color.  
Table 5-8: A selection of rhizobia-regulated (FC>2 or FC<-2) genes at low and/or high N in A17 and/or sunn-1 assigned 
to different functional categories using MapMan software (Thimm et al., 2004). Tables are sorted alphabetically by the 
functional categories column.

5-8). However, at low N the expression levels of these genes were almost two 
times lower in sunn-1 than A17. The lower expression levels of the 
significantly induced calmodulin proteins at low in sunn-1 that shows the 
hyper nodulating phenotype and the rhizobia dependent SUNN-induced 
expression of LysM receptor kinase could suggest that these could be 
involved in the regulation of nodule numbers. In the nodulation signaling 
pathway, LysM receptor complexes perceive Nod factor (Amor et al., 2003). 
LysM activation triggers a signaling cascade that induces nucleus calcium 
spiking leading to the activation of DMI3. DMI3 activates the nodulation TFs 
NSP2, NIN and ERN (member of the AP2/ERF family). These TFs regulate 
the expression of early nodulins (ENODs) such as ENOD11 (Oldroyd, 2013) 
(Figure 5-11). 
Of the differentially expressed TFs involved in the nodulation-signaling 
pathway NIN (Medtr4g068000.1), showed significant (FC>2) rhizobia-
induction at low and high N in A17 and only at high N in sunn-1. Changes in 
the expression level of NIN were almost the same (FC=3) in A17 at low and 
high N and sunn-1 at high N (Table 5-8). NIN is a key regulator of the 
nodulation pathway with a potential negative role in transcriptional regulation 
of ENOD11 (Andriankaja et al., 2007, Marsh et al., 2007). Recent studies on 
L. japonicus have provided evidence suggesting that this bifunctional TF 
negatively regulates infection but positively regulates nodule organogenesis 
(Yoro et al., 2014). The lower expression level of NIN only in sunn-1 at low N 
where it shows the hypernodulating phenotype could be indicative of the role 
this TF may have in AON. 
Of the differentially expressed ERF TFs ERF026 (Medtr1g101550.1) 
was rhizobia-repressed (FC=-2.2) at low N in sunn-1 and RAP2-6 
(Medtr3g098580.1) was SUNN-repressed (FC=2.4) in the presence of 
rhizobia. AtRAP2-6 participates in plant developmental processes as well as 
biotic and/or abiotic stress signaling such as ABA, salt and osmotic stress 
responses (Zhu et al., 2010, Krishnaswamy et al., 2011). ERFs are part of the 
AP2/EREBP TF family and are involved in signal transduction and regulation 
of defence or regulation genes in response to abiotic and biotic stress such as 
pathogen and defence responses (Xu et al., 2011). Members of this family 
such as ERN (ERF for required nodulation) and EFD (ethylene response 
factor required for nodule differentiation) are key regulators of the nodulation 
pathway including controlling nodule number and differentiation (Andriankaja 
et al., 2007, Verni et al., 2008). The differentially expressed Nodulation-
signaling pathway 2 protein (NSP2), Medtr3g072710.1, was SUNN-induced 
(FC=2.2) only at low N in the presence of rhizobia. NSP2 together with NSP1 
act as positive regulators of ERN1 and ENOD11 transcription (Cerri et al., 
2012). Thus this co-SUNN induction of ERF RAP2-6 and NSP2 at low N and 
in the presence of rhizobia could be indicative of their role in regulating the 
ENODs and other nodulins of the nodulation pathway. 
5.2.5.1.3 Stress related genes with putative role in AON 
Based on the number of significantly differentially expressed (FC>2 or 
FC<-2) expressed genes in the MapMans stress functional category, the 
stress response was stronger in SUNN-regulated genes at low N and in the 
presence of rhizobia. The stress response was rhizobia dependent and also 
affected by N concentration because at low N they were significantly 
differentially expressed (FC>2 or FC<-2) expressed only in +Rhiz and their 
number was 4 times more at low N than high N. According to MapMan 
functional category, 62% were related to biotic stress (Table 5-9). The 
majority (84%) of these stress related genes were SUNN-repressed. From all 
these it could be suggested that these stress related genes (Table 5-9) could 
be involved in rhizobia-legume symbiotic pathways and control of nodule 
formation. 
5.2.6 Analysis of differentially expressed gene promoters identifies 
putative regulatory motifs mediating SUNN responses 
As discussed above, the identified genes that were differentially 
expressed (FC>2 or FC<-2) during nodulation and under low and high N 
concentrations in A17 and sunn-1 are proposed to have a role in AON and 
balance between LR and nodule number according to the plant N status. To 
have a better understanding of the transcriptional regulation of these genes, 
promoters of genes for transcriptional motifs were studied.  
As explained earlier, differentially expressed genes were assigned to 12 
different groups (Table 5-3) representing A17 and sunn-1 responses to low 
or high N concentrations in the presence or absence of rhizobia, rhizobia at 
low or high N and SUNN-regulation at low or high N in the presence or 
absence of rhizobia. In each group, motifs analysis was carried out by using 
the MEME Launcher and Browser tool MEME-LaB (Brown et al., 2013) to 
search for sequence patterns that occurred repeatedly (i.e. motifs) in the co-
expressed genes belonging to the group. The maximum length of promoter 
sequence to be searched were specified as either 200, 500 and 1000 bp that 
was measured from the transcription start site upstream in the 5 direction. 
The analysis was run using 9 different datasets which contained the 12 
groups of differentially expressed genes as defined in Table 5-3 with different 
FC cutoffs (Table 5-10) and for each dataset with 3 different promoter 
maximum lengths (200, 500 and 1000 bp) = 27 runs. This allowed analysis of 
the data as: 1) genes showing the strongest response (datasets 1-3) that 
were genes with FC>3 or FC<-3 (where the highest FC value was 2 or -2 this 
cutoff was used instead); 2) genes with FC>2 or FC<-2 that were also studied 
in different MapMan functional categories (data sets 4-6); 3) all genes without 
identifying a FC cutoff (data sets 7-9); 4) data sets containing both over 
expressed and under expressed genes (data sets 1, 4 and 7) and data sets 
with only over or under expressed genes (data sets 8 and 9).  
To specify the most significant motifs these results were first filtered 
using the following criteria: %Promoters  20 (to identify the most common 
motifs), Info content  10 (to choose the most conserved motifs), Positional 
bias (p-value)  0.001 (to select motifs whose positional distribution and/or 
distribution over both strands are less likely to be random). The information 
provided by MEME-LaB for each motif was then used to select the most 
significant motifs the following parameters for each motif in each group was  
Datasets FC Cutoff  
Dataset 1 FC > 3 or FC < -3  
Dataset 2 FC > 3 
Dataset 3 FC < -3 
Dataset 4 FC > 2 or FC < -2

Dataset 6 FC < -2

compared with other motifs of the group and also the same motif in other 
datasets: 1) having a higher number and percentage of promoter sites within 
the group in which it was found compared to other motifs in the same group; 
2) larger total information content value (as number of bits) that is indicative of 
a larger or more conserved motif; 3) smaller E-value, indicating that the motif 
was unlikely to be a random artifact ; 4) positional bias expressed as p-value, 
that is the observed distribution of the motif compared to the length of the 
promoter sequences with an expected uniform distribution, lower p-value is 
indicative of a non-random distribution.  
To identify biologically relevant findings, for each motif the top five 
closest matching known motifs and their PSSMs (position-specific scoring 
matrix) available in the JASPAR (Sandelin et al., 2004) and PLACE (Higo et 
al., 1999) public databases were analysed in MEME-LaB. The level of 
similarity to these known motifs was indicated as a distance score that 
compares the motif found by MEME to its closest matches among known 
motifs (smaller distance score values is indicative of a higher similarity). Motifs 
with close similarity to known motifs from planta were analysed in more detail. 
Since we were interested in studying the genes with strong (FC>2 or FC<-2) 
response to the N, rhizobia and SUNN, if any of these motifs were only 
discovered in the datasets containing all the differentially expressed genes 
with no FC cutoff, they were omitted from the selected list of motifs. 
Based on all the above parameters six motifs were selected as 
significant motifs (Figure 5-12) among the 9 different datasets. These motifs 
were identified in the group of differentially expressed genes that were 
rhizobia-regulated at low N in A17 (group 5: motifs 1, 2 and 3) and sunn-1 
(group 6: motifs 1, 2 and 3); and rhizobia-regulated at high N in A17 (group 7: 
motifs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) and sunn-1 (group 8: motif 1). Some of the main 
features of the known motifs in planta that had the closest similarity to these 
motifs were nodulin, leghemoglobin and auxin response (Table 5-11). Around 
70% of the promoters of the motifs were NCRs except for motif 1 that 30% of 
the promoters were NCRs. Aside from NCRs and proteins with unknown

function, other target genes were mainly nodulins, leghemoglobins and 
calmodulin-like proteins (Table 5-12). This made up for around 90% of the 
promoter motifs to be involved in the nodulation pathway. These all suggests 
that these motifs could be the regulatory components involved in controlling 
gene expression responses to low or high N to regulate the number of 
nodules, based on the plant N status. 
5.3 Conclusion 
Phenotypic study of RSA changes in response to N and rhizobia in A17 
and sunn-1 showed that the response was different between these two 
genotypes. At low N the number of nodules was significantly (P<0.05) higher 
in sunn-1 compared to A17. However, average of LR length was significantly 
(P<0.01) less in the nodulating sunn-1 samples than A17 (Figure 5-4). This 
was because LR total length was significantly (P<0.05) less in sunn-1 and 
there was not a significant difference in number of LRs between A17 and 
sunn-1 (Figure 5-1 b). At the high N concentration that was inhibiting for 
nodulation, sunn-1 had the ability to nodulate but the number of nodules was 
significantly (P<0.05) less than in low N. Average of LR length was 
significantly (P<0.01) less in sunn-1 compared to A17 at high N but number of 
LRs was (P<0.01) higher (Figure 5-1 b). 
To study the balance between nodule number and LR development 
(based on the differences observed in the RSA responses in our phenotyping 
studies), the effect of rhizobia and SUNN-regulated gene expression changes 
were compared between sunn-1 and A17 with a focus on the responses at 
low N because of the enhanced lateral root-AON effects in sunn-1 at low N. 
Studying differentially expressed significantly (FC>2 or FC<-2) induced or 
repressed genes showed that rhizobia-regulated responses were stronger in 
sunn-1 compared to A17 and that this was independent of the N concentration 
(Table 5-4 and figure 5-8 a). The strongest (higher number of significantly 
differentially expressed (FC>2 or FC<-2) genes) SUNN-regulated responses 
were observed in the presence of rhizobia especially at low N (Table 5-4 and 
Figure 5-8 b). Based on the gene abundance of different MapMan biological 
functional categories (Figure 5-8 a and b) this proposes a model (Figure 5-9) 
suggesting that regulation (signaling, regulation of protein activity and TFs) 
and nodulins are the main factors responsible for the hypernodulation and 
short LR phenotype in sunn-1 at low N.  
The current study suggests that rhizobia-regulated and SUNN-regulated 
nodulins mainly from the NCR protein family, stress responses, TFs and other 
regulatory responses through signaling and regulation of protein activities at 
low and high N may be important in the sunn-1 phenotype, and thus in AON 
control (Figure 5-13). We have identified nodulins with putative role in AON 
that may be also involved in the balance between LRs and nodules in low N 
(Table 5-6 and 5-7 a and b). These are different sets of differentially 
expressed nodulins with distinctive rhizobia-regulated and/or SUNN-regulated 
expression changes at low N (FC>2 or FC<-2), which correlate with 
phenotypic effects. Predominantly, rhizobia induced their expression at low N 
and they were more highly expressed in A17 compared to sunn-1 (Figure 5-
13 a). The SUNN-regulated effect on the expression of nodulins was rhizobia 
dependent, being SUNN-induced in the absence of rhizobia and SUNN-
repressed in the presence of rhizobia.  
A high percentage (43%) of the differentially expressed TFs (FC>2 or 
FC<-2) showed strong rhizobia-suppressed response (FC<-2) in sunn-1 at 
low N. The higher number of rhizobia-regulated (FC>2 or FC<-2) differentially 
expressed TFs in sunn-1 at low N that was three times more than A17 and 
that a high percentage were rhizobia-suppressed in sunn-1, could all suggest 
that these TFs are involved in the pathways leading to the control of nodule 
numbers and balance between LRs and nodules (Figure 5-13 a). Among 
these TFs, the number of WRKY TFs was higher than TFs from other families. 
Based on the differences between gene expression patterns of A17 and 
sunn-1 differentially expressed (FC>2 or FC<-2) rhizobia or SUNN-induced or 
repressed regulatory genes and nodulins at low N we have identified putative

Figure 5-13: Candidate upregulated (blue) and downregulated (red) 
genes potentially involved in AON and the balance between nodule 
formation and LR development     at (a) low and (b) high N. These are 
genes that were significantly (FC>2 or FC<-2) rhizobia-regulated in A17 
or sunn-1 (upper panels), or SUNN-regulated in the absence (-Rhiz) or 
presence (+Rhiz) of rhizobia (lower panel). The boxes pointing to the 
two green and orange lines in the middle indicate that the genes are 
expressed in both A17 and sunn-1.  
roles in AON for some of the components of the nodulation pathway (Figure 
5-11 and 5-13 a). Of the differentially expressed TFs regulating the 
expression of early and late nodulins during NF signaling and nodule 
organogenesis, the bifunctional TF NIN was found to be rhizobia-induced with 
a lower expression level only in sunn-1 at low N. The ethylene responsive TFs 
ERF026 and RAP2-6 were rhizobia-repressed and SUNN-repressed 
respectively and the GRAS family TF NSP2 was SUNN-induced. The 
expression of this combination of TFs, signaling genes (e.g. LysM receptor 
kinase and calmodulin-like proteins 1, 4 and 5) and the differentially 
expressed (FC>2 or FC<-2) nodulins (Table 5-6 and 5-7 a and b) involved in 
the infection pathway (NF signaling pathway) and nodule organogenesis and 
the different expression patterns they show at low N in response to rhizobia 
and/or SUNN (in the presence of rhizobia) makes them suitable candidates 
for AON (Figure 5-13 a).   
Studying the expression patterns of significantly (FC>2 or FC<-2) 
rhizobia and/or SUNN-induced or repressed genes at high N and comparing 
these responses between A17 and sunn-1 and with their expression levels at 
low N enabled to candidate groups of TFs and nodulins as putative regulators 
of nodulation. The higher expression level of these rhizobia and/or SUNN 
regulated nodulins (e.g. NCR 90, MtN20 and MtN11) and TFs that function in 
developmental processes and response to biotic and abiotic stresses (e.g. 
WRKY 33 and ERF 12) in sunn-1 compared to A17 at high N (Figure 5-13 b), 
could be controlling the ability of this mutant to nodulate at N levels otherwise 
inhibitory for A17. This could suggest that these specific nodulins and TFs 
may be involved in controlling nodule formation according to N availability. 
Using motif analysis tools, six motifs were discovered: motif 1 
(AAGGGACAACA), motif 2 (AGAGACAT), motif 3 (TCATGAAA), motif 4 
(TATAA), motif 5 (CAACACA) and motif 6 (TTTTAC). The putative promoters 
of these motifs were mainly nodulins and genes involved in the nodulation 
pathway with the majority of the promoters being NCRs. These promoters 
were strongly (FC>2 or FC<-2) rhizobia regulated at low and/or high N 
(Figures 5-13 a and b) and they could be regulators of gene expression 
responses in response to low and high N to control the nodule numbers. 
As reported in this chapter, by combining our phenotyping results with 
gene expression studies on roots of A17 and sunn-1 at low and high N in the 
presence or absence of rhizobia, we were able to propose models (Figures 5-
11 and 5-13) for explaining the sunn-1 phenotype and identifying some of the 
components of the nodulation pathway as regulators of LR development and 
nodule formation. As expected, some of the CLE peptides putatively involved 
in AON were not significantly differentially expressed in our study. This could 
be due to the choice of mutant (discussed in chapter 6) or a higher threshold 
could be selected for identifying the differentially expressed genes. The data 
provided in this study could be useful in identifying new N-regulated nodulins 
and SUNN-regulated genes that could be components of different biological 
pathways involved in balancing the plant N uptake with its growth and 
development.

General conclusion 
Nitrate as a signal molecule regulates plant gene expression, 
metabolism, growth and development (Ruffel et al., 2008, Vidal and Gutirrez, 
2008, Bouguyon et al., 2012) for instance, by influencing hormone balances 
(Bouguyon et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2012), local stimulation of LR growth 
(Zhang and Forde, 1998, Walch-Liu et al., 2006, Gan et al., 2012) and LRP 
initiation (Vidal et al., 2010). The response of RSA to N availability has been 
widely studied. Significant progress has been also made to understand the 
molecular nature of communication between individual pairs of plant-
microbes. This study focused on how LR development and nodule formation 
were balance in Medicago according to the N availability. This was achieved 
by combining phenotypic analysis of N-regulation of Medicago RSA with 
whole genome expression profiling of N responses. This enabled generation 
of a list of candidate genes that control the responses and cross talk in M. 
truncatula roots to N and symbiosis. Analysis of the regulatory genes and 
processes enabled a better understanding of how legumes balance N uptake 
and use from LRs with N2 fixation. 
6.1 Phenotypic studies of the RSA response to low and high 
concentrations of N and rhizobia  
 Phenotypic measurements of the root architecture were used to study 
root architecture changes in M. truncatula in response to low and high 
concentrations of N and rhizobia inoculation. The regulatory gene networks 
targeted by shoot-root N status signals in the plant and the functional 
responses of the N acquisition systems are determined by the N form (Ruffel 
et al., 2008, Jeudy et al., 2010). In our studies we showed that the ability to 
nodulate and the presence or absence of rhizobia could affect root 
development of Medicago plants grown under low or high N conditions in the 
form of NH4NO3. The response of the rhizobia inoculated and non-inoculated 
plants of M. truncatula cv. Jemalong A17, cv. Jemalong 2HA, ssp. tribuloides, 
Gaertner and var. longispina to low (0.5 and 1 mM) and high (2 and 10 mM) N 
followed a similar trend (Figure 3-2 and 3-3). This could suggest that the 
response is conserved over these different genetic backgrounds of Medicago. 
Hence M. truncatula var. Jemalong A17 (sequenced reference accession, 
denoted here as wild type) was used as the model plant to study RSA 
responses to low and high N concentrations and rhizobia.  
Subjecting A17 to a range of low and high concentrations of N (0-20 
mM) showed that nodulation was highest at low N concentrations (0.1 and 0.5 
mM) and it was inhibited at high N starting from 5 M. The inhibition of 
nodulation at high concentrations of N (Streeter, 1985, Thimm et al., 2004) in 
which N fixation capacity of existing nodules is also affected (Cabeza et al., 
2014) is a balancing mechanism in the nodules to avoid depletion of carbon 
resources when other sources of N is available (Silsbury et al., 1986, Wery et 
al., 1986, Carroll et al., 1990). 
In M. truncatula, N is acquired through three main pathways: NH4, NO3 
and N2 (Ruffel et al., 2008). Local and systemic pathways acting at the 
molecular level regulate NH4 and NO3 uptake and N2 fixation in the nodules 
and root development depending on the N status of the whole plant (Remans 
et al., 2006a, Poultney et al., 2007, Desnos, 2008, Ruffel et al., 2008, Forde, 
2014). Symbiotic organisms (Olh et al., 2005, Maillet et al., 2011) and 
components of the legume symbiosis pathway such as flavonoids that are 
secreted from the plants as signal molecules or Nod factors that are signal 
molecules released by the rhizobia can also effect LR development (Olh et 
al., 2005, Laffont et al., 2010). The data obtained from studying the response 
of A17 root architecture to low (0.1 mM) and high (5 mM) concentrations of N 
showed that rhizobia had no significant (P<0.05) effect on root development 
(average of LR length, LR total length, LR number and LR density) at low N 
(Figure 3-5 e). Studying the time scale of LR development at low N also 
confirmed these results showing that rhizobia had no significant (P<0.05) 
effect on different stages (LRP i, LRP ii, emerging and fully emerged LRs) of 
LR development (Table 3-3). At low N, treated samples at the earlier time 
points in both -Rhiz and +Rhiz samples showed an increase in LR 
development (LRP i, emerging and fully emerged LR) with a decreasing trend 
at the later time points (Figure 3-9 a). In +Rhiz, as the number of nodules 
increased the number of LRs at different developmental stages (LRP i, 
emerging and fully emerged LR) decreased (Figure 3-9 a). This balancing 
response between LR number and the number of nodules that form and 
regulate N2 fixation within the nodules could be to avoid excessive depletion 
of carbon reserves and to conserve energy pool in order to develop more 
nodules rather than produce more LRs. 
To further study the effect of rhizobia and nodulation on different stages 
of LR development, -Rhiz plants grown at low N were inoculated with rhizobia 
and LR developmental changes were studied at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16-day time 
points. The results from this study also suggested there was a balancing 
mechanism between LR and nodule formation. This was concluded because 
at early time points post-inoculation with rhizobia, the number of LRP i in 
+Rhiz was significantly (P<0.05) less compared to -Rhiz (Figure 3-9 a). Also 
in +Rhiz samples there was an increasing trend in the number of LRs at 
different developmental stages at the earlier time points but as the number of 
nodule primordia and mature nodules increased at the later time points, there 
was a decreasing trend in the number of LRs at different stages of 
development (Figure 3-9 c).     
We have found that the presence of rhizobia, at high N concentrations 
that inhibit nodulation significantly (P<0.05) affected root development and 
had an inhibitory effect on PR length, LR total length, LR number and root 
total size (Figure 3-5). This suggests tight coregulation of LR and nodule 
formation, with connection of gene regulatory pathways a likely mechanism 
underlying this. To see how high N concentration and rhizobia affected LR 
development, different stages of LR development was studied 0-16 days post 
treatment of -Rhiz and +Rhiz plants grown at low N with high N. The results 
from this study also showed that rhizobia significantly (P<0.05) affected early 
and late stages of LR development (LRP i and fully emerged LRs) (Table 3-3) 
at high N. It also showed that at early time points post treatment of N deprived 
plants with high N, there was an increasing trend in the number LRs in 
different stages of development (LRP i and ii, emerging and fully emerged LR) 
at the earlier time points that was followed by a decrease at the later time 
points (Figure 3-9 b). This response shows that the plant N status balances 
LR development.  
6.2 Whole genome profiling of root responses to high N and rhizobia 
Phenotypic studies showed that high N affected PR and LR 
development in the presence of rhizobia. In order to identify genes that control 
the plants root response to N and rhizobia, whole-genome profiling was 
carried out. The phenotypic data was used to inform choice of the most 
suitable concentrations of N (0.1 and 5 mM) for the design of these 
transcriptomic experiments. Microarray experiments were used to study gene 
expression changes in whole root samples of rhizobia-inoculated or mock-
inoculated A17 plants grown at low N at 0, 2 and 6 hours post-treatment with 
high N (Figure 4-2 a). 
A total of 4793 genes were identified as differentially expressed with a 
significance cutoff of P<0.05 that represented 7.4% of the genes annotated in 
the M. truncatula 3.5 gene model. Differentially expressed genes with FC>2 or 
FC<-2 were identified as the genes showing the strongest expression 
changes under the experimental conditions. The number of these differentially 
expressed genes (FC>2 or FC <-2) showed that high N effect was stronger in 
-Rhiz at both 2 and 6 h and a higher number of genes were N-regulated 
compared to +Rhiz. This suggested that the early (2 and 6 h) responses to 
high N were mainly independent of the rhizobia effect and N-induction 
especially at 2 h time point was the predominant response (Table 4-1).  
A model (Figure 4-11) was proposed for the early (2 and 6 h) responses 
to high N in -Rhiz and +Rhiz N-deprived plants. This model identifies the 
differentially expressed genes with strong (FC>2 FC<-2) N (Figure 4-11 a) or 
rhizobia (Figure 4-11 b) regulated expression changes and the main biological 
functional categories they belong to. These genes could be responsible for 
the root phenotype observed at high in -Rhiz and +Rhiz (chapter 3 and Figure 
4-1) balancing PR and LR development with nodule formation.  
The results show that PNR genes (Figure 4-11 a) such as genes 
involved in N transport, assimilation and amino acid metabolism were rapidly 
(within 2-6 h) induced upon high N treatment (Figure 4-11 a). Studies in 
Arabidopsis also shows that PNR genes are significantly expressed shortly 
after treatment with nitrate in roots (Krouk et al., 2010b). Among these, 
NRT1.1 was strongly induced (FC=2.5) only in the presence of rhizobia. 
NRT1.1 is involved in auxin transport and accumulation which is required for 
LR growth (Bouguyon et al., 2012). The strong induction (FC=2.5) of NRT1.1 
in response to high N only at +Rhiz could indicate that it may be involved in 
the regulatory response affecting the PR and LR length at high N in rhizobia-
inoculated plants (Figure 3-5) and that its expression is affected by the 
presence of rhizobia. The PNR response to high N treatment was more 
enhanced in -Rhiz N-deprived plants possibly to compensate for the N 
deficiency they were facing. This could be suggested because of the stronger 
induction of ferredoxin-nitrite reductase  (Table 4-4) that is involved in N 
assimilation (Orea et al., 2001) and the higher number of differentially 
expressed (FC>2 or FC<-2) amino acid metabolism genes in -Rhiz.  
In response to high N treatment the circadian clock-associated protein 
1a (Medtr8g077420.1) was strongly N-suppressed (Figure 4-11 a). This 
suppression was related to the duration of high N treatment (suggested by the 
two times decrease in FC at 6 h compared to 2 h in -Rhiz and +Rhiz) and 
independent of rhizobia. The N-suppression of this TF was one of the 
strongest (FC<-4) between the N-suppressed differentially expressed genes 
at 6 h in both -Rhiz and +Rhiz. CCA1 with nitrate is involved in regulating 
some of the steps in N metabolism (Gutirrez et al., 2008) and also the 
activity of NRT1.1 and NRT2.1 (Krouk et al., 2010a). The enhanced N-
assimilation activities suggested by the strong upregulation of the differentially 
expressed high affinity nitrate transporters (NRT1.1 and NRT2.1) and nitrate 
reductases and the strong N-suppression (FC<-2) of CCA1 could be 
indicative of the regulatory response and interaction between the circadian 
rhythm and N-assimilation. 
Enhanced developmental activities were also observed early (2 and 6 h) 
after treatment with high N. Some of the differentially expressed TCA cycle 
enzymes and proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism specifically TCA 
carbonic anhydrases (Medtr5g066060) were strongly induced (FC>2) in -Rhiz 
and +Rhiz samples. In Arabidopsis carbon assimilation enzymes involved in 
N/carbon balance are regulated by nitrate (Sakakibara et al., 1997, Scheible 
et al., 1997). Here the strong induction of the TCA carbonic anhydrases 
(Figure 4-11) may be to provide the necessary carbon and energy pool for the 
enhanced metabolic and developmental activities due to N availability.  
There was a predominant upregulation of significantly expressed genes 
related to the nodulation pathway showing very strong expression changes (2 
< FC < 9) in response to rhizobia at low N (0 h) and high N (2 and 6 h). This 
could be indicative of an enhanced developmental activity in the roots under 
low and high N condition. In this study also 6 significantly expressed NCR 
peptides were identified that could have a putative role in the nodulation 
pathway. This is hypothesised because they were strongly rhizobia-induced 
(FC>2) only at low N (Table 4-6 b and Figure 4-11 b). The strong rhizobia-
induction (FC>2) of another group of significantly expressed NCRs only at 
high N (Table 4-6 c and d, Figure 4-11 b) makes them putative 
regulators/inhibitors of nodule development at high N or candidates for the 
rhizobia mediated LR development observed at high N condition (Figure 4-
The rhizobia-mediated response of N-sufficient plants to low N was also 
studied. Gene expression changes of whole root samples of +Rhiz plants 
grown at high N were studied 6 h post treatment with low N and a model was 
proposed for this response (Figure 4-12). The differentially expressed genes 
(FC>2 or FC<-2) in this study were predominantly (83%) N-suppressed. This 
could be indicative of the activation of a local N signal to decrease biological 
activities in response to low N condition. The strong (FC>2) induction of 
NRT2.1 by low N could suggest that it is involved in the regulation of this early 
response to low N. The strong suppression (FC<-2) of nitrate reductase also 
suggests the decrease in N assimilation at low N. 
6.3 Identifying components of the AON with putative role in balancing 
LR development and nodule number 
The phenotypic study of RSA changes in response to N and rhizobia 
showed that the response was different between A17 and sunn-1. This 
response was specially more enhanced in sunn-1 at low N with a significantly 
(P<0.05) higher number of nodules and shorter LRs (average of LR length 
significantly (P<0.01) less due to significantly (P<0.05) smaller LR total length) 
than A17 (Figure 5-1). sunn-1 is impaired in correct AON responses for 
regulating the number of nodules (Van Noorden et al., 2006). Previous studies 
suggest that AON genes could be candidates for regulating LR development 
in response to N (Jin et al., 2012). The hypernodulating phenotype of sunn-1 
with short LRs at low N suggests that the components of the AON pathway 
may also be involved in balancing LR development. To study this balance 
between LR development and nodule number whole genome expression 
profiling was used and the effect of rhizobia and SUNN regulated gene 
expression was compared between sunn-1 and A17.  
In this study 7186 genes (15% of the genes annotated in the M. 
truncatula 3.5 gene model) showed significant expression changes under the 
experimental condition (Figure 5-5 a). The number of differentially expressed 
genes with significant (FC>2 or FC<-2) rhizobia and/or SUNN-regulated 
responses (Table 5-4) showed that irrespective of the N concentration, 
rhizobia-regulated responses were stronger in sunn-1 compared to A17 
(Table 5-4 and Figure 5-8 a) and the SUNN-regulated response was stronger 
in the presence of rhizobia especially at low N (Table 5-4 and Figure 5-8 b). 
Nodulins made up for the majority of the differentially expressed (FC>2 
or FC<-2) rhizobia-regulated genes at both low and high N in A17 and sunn-1 
(Figure 5-8 a). We have identified different sets of differentially expressed 
nodulins with distinctive rhizobia-regulated and/or SUNN-regulated expression 
changes at low N (FC>2 or FC<-2) that may be involved in the balance 
between LRs and nodules in low N with a putative role in AON (Table 5-6 and 
5-7 a and b). This is suggested because the expression changes in these 
nodulins in response to rhizobia and/or SUNN correlated to the root 
phenotype at low N (Figure 5-13 a). The hypernodulating phenotype with 
short LRs at low N in sunn-1 was rhizobia dependent and different from A17. 
Differentially expressed (FC>2) rhizobia-induced nodulins at low N had a 
higher expression level in A17 compared to sunn-1. Also, the expression 
changes of differentially expressed (FC>2 or FC<-2) nodulins affected by 
SUNN were rhizobia-dependent. They were SUNN-induced in the absence of 
rhizobia and SUNN-repressed in the presence of rhizobia. 
The expression patterns of the differentially expressed TFs at low N also 
correlated to the difference between sunn-1 and A17 root phenotype at low N 
in +Rhiz. The number of rhizobia-regulated (FC>2 or FC<-2) differentially 
expressed TFs in sunn-1 at low N was three times higher than A17 of which 
around 43% were rhizobia-suppressed in sunn-1. Among the SUNN-regulated 
differentially expressed TFs at low N, significant (FC>2 or FC<-2) expression 
changes were only observed in the presence of rhizobia (Figure 5-8 b and 5-
10 b). It is possible that this high rhizobia-suppressed response of TFs in 
sunn-1 at low N and the SUNN-regulated response that is significant (FC>2 or 
FC<-2) only in the presence of rhizobia may be related to the absence of 
control in the number of nodules in sunn-1 (Figure 5-13 a).  
Some of the differentially expressed (FC>2 or FC<-2) known 
components of the nodulation pathway that were rhizobia or SUNN-regulated 
showed differences in gene expression patterns between A17 and sunn-1 at 
low N. Because of these differences in expression patterns and taking into 
account the differences between root phenotype of A17 and sunn-1 at low N 
(Figure 5-3) we propose that they may have putative roles in AON (Figure 5-
11 and 5-13 a). LysM receptor kinase (Medtr5g086130.1) was differentially 
expressed at low N and SUNN-induced in the presence of rhizobia. This 
receptor is involved in the perception of the Nod factor (Amor et al., 2003). 
Calmodulin-like proteins 1, 4 and 5 (Medtr3g055570.1, Medtr3g055490.1, 
Medtr3g055510.1 respectively) were rhizobia-induced (2.3<FC<6.8) but their 
expression levels were almost two times lower in sunn-1 than A17 at low N 
(Table 5-8). These proteins are involved in calcium spiking that leads to root 
hair curling and activation of DMI3 (Oldroyd, 2013). NIN TF 
(Medtr4g068000.1) that is involved in regulating the expression of early and 
late nodulins during NF signaling and nodule organogenesis (Andriankaja et 
al., 2007, Marsh et al., 2007, Yoro et al., 2014) was rhizobia-induced with a 
lower expression level only in sunn-1 at low N. Of other TFs involved in the 
nodulation pathway ERF026 (Medtr1g101550.1) was rhizobia-repressed at 
low N in sunn-1 and RAP2-6 (Medtr3g098580.1) was SUNN-repressed at low 
N in the presence of rhizobia. ERF026 and RAP2-6 are members of the ERF 
TF family. Members of this family are key regulator in the nodulation pathway 
and control of nodule number and differentiation (Andriankaja et al., 2007, 
Verni et al., 2008). NSP2 (Medtr3g072710.1) that with NSP1 is a positive 
regulator of ERN1 and ENOD11 transcription (Cerri et al., 2012) was SUNN-
induced at low N in the presence of rhizobia (Figure 5-11).  
The differentially expressed genes with significant (FC>2 or FC<-2) 
rhizobia or SUNN regulated responses were also studied using motif analysis 
tools (Brown et al., 2013). From these studies, six motifs were discovered: 
motif 1 (AAGGGACAACA), motif 2 (AGAGACAT), motif 3 (TCATGAAA), motif 
4 (TATAA), motif 5 (CAACACA) and motif 6 (TTTTAC). Because these 
promoters were strongly (FC>2 or FC<-2) rhizobia-regulated at low and/or 
high N (Figures 5-13 a and b) and their putative promoters were mainly 
nodulins and genes involved in the nodulation pathway (the majority being 
NCRs) we suggest that they may be regulators of nodule numbers depending 
on the plant N status. 
6.4 Future work 
Phenotyping and transcriptomic analysis were used to study the effect of 
rhizobia and N on the balance between LR and nodule development. We 
studied the time scale of LR and nodule development in response to rhizobia 
and N at cellular level. The time scale of early stages of nodulation in 
response to low and high N could be identified more precisely by visualising 
the GFP-carrying S. meliloti strain using confocal microscopy (Gage et al., 
1996, Fournier et al., 2015). 
In this study we were able to identify some of the key pathways and 
genes that were involved in the balance between LR and nodule development 
according to the N availability in M. truncatula. Whole genome expression 
profiling of N and rhizobia responses in roots enabled us to generate list of 
candidate genes and identify biological pathways involved in regulating root 
and nodule responses to rhizobia and high N. By comparing the responses of 
A17 and sunn-1 to N (low and high) and rhizobia we have also identified 
genes with putative roles in AON and the balance between nodule number 
and LR development. The data generated from this work could be integrated 
with other available transcriptomic data (such as Ruffel et al., 2008). This 
could give a comprehensive perspective on the genes involved in the root and 
nodulation responses in Medicago and would enable comparisn between 
different data sets. The nodulation genes in cluster 26 (section 4.2.3.4) could 
be interesting in this regard and it can give new insight into unknown 
nodulation genes.  
The pathways and genes indicated in the hypothesised models (Figures 
4-11, 4-12, 5-11 and 5-13) could be key and interesting candidates to further 
study the balance between N uptake and use from LRs with N2 fixation in the 
nodules. The expression of these differentially expressed genes (FC>2 or 
FC<-2) could be validated under different conditions (e.g. different time points, 
N and rhizobia treatment) and with different known and available mutants 
using q-PCR. In this study also 6 motifs were identified with putative 
promoters mainly involved in the nodulation pathway. These could be 
validated using yeast two-hybrid systems. 
The choice of rhizobial symbiont could affect the efficiency of nodules in 
N2 fixation (Mhadhbi et al., 2005, Terpolilli et al., 2008). Plant N acquisition is 
also strongly affected by the choice of bacterial partner (Laguerre et al., 
2012). In this study, the reference strain S. meliloti RCR 2011 was used as M. 
truncatula symbiont. It has been reported that this strain is poorly effective in 
N2-fixation with Mt Jemalong A17 (Mhadhbi et al., 2005). A more N-efficient 
strain such as Sinorhizobium medicae strain md4 that shows to have a higher 
symbiotic performance (Laguerre et al., 2012) could be used to study the 
balance between LR and nodule development based on N availability. 
Comparing these two transcriptomic data could then give us a better 
understanding of the effect of low and high performance symbionts and N on 
the balance between LR and nodule in the plant to meet its N demand. 
The cross talk between LR and nodule development are highly 
regulated. The role of hormones is crucial in this cross talk and regulation. In 
our study we have identified genes involved in different hormone signaling 
pathways such as auxin, JA, SA and GA that showed significant (FC>2 or 
FC<-2) expression changes in response to N (Tables 4-4 and 4-5). These 
hormones have well known roles in control of LR and nodule number. SA, JA 
and GA are involved in regulating LR development through cross talk with 
auxin pathway. SA with auxin regulates PIN trafficking and auxin flux and 
distribution (Armengot et al., 2014, Du et al., 2013). JA negatively regulates 
auxin transport by affecting the distribution of PIN family auxin transporters in 
the plasma membrane (Sun et al., 2011, Sun et al., 2009). GA is a negative 
regulator of LR development by affecting the polar auxin transport (Gou et al., 
2010). JA and SA are also involved in regulation of nodulation. There are 
different reports on the negative and positive roles of JA in regulating nodule 
number (Nagata and Suzuki, 2014). SA is a strong inhibitor of nodulation (van 
Spronsen et al., 2003, Stacey et al., 2006) with a direct role in signal 
transmission in the autoregulation of nodulation (van Spronsen et al., 2003, 
Sato et al., 2002). The genes we have identified in these pathways were 
differentially (FC>2 or FC<-2) expressed in response to N. These genes could 
be involved in integrating JA, SA or GA signalling into auxin pathway to cross-
regulate LR and nodule development in response to N. These data could be 
used in studying N regulation in these pathways, how it could affect root and 
LR development and whether there is a direct connection between these 
pathways in response to N.  
To study the AON role of SUNN, other alleles rather than sunn-1 could 
be a better choice (Schnabel et al., 2010). For example sunn-4 that is a 
putative null mutant of SUNN. Schnabel et al. (2005) had identified four alleles 
of SUNN. The sunn-1 mutation that is most often used by researchers is 
resulted from an amino acid change in the kinase domain of the protein in a 
residue highly conserved in serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases (Schnabel 
et al., 2010, Hanks and Quinn, 1991). The sunn-4 allele creates a stop codon, 
which should result in truncation of the protein immediately after the initial 
signal peptide sequence and is presumed to act as a null mutation (Schnabel 
et al., 2005, Schnabel et al., 2010). The fact that most of the CLE peptides 
(Mortier et al., 2010) with putative role in AON were not significantly (FC>2 or 
FC<-2) differentially expressed in our study in sunn-1 could be related to our 
choice of mutant. Using other alleles such as sunn-4 we could study the N-
regulated expression of CLE and CEP peptides. The effect of SUNN on 
controlling nodule number and LR development could be then studied. Split 
root or grafting experiments (Ruffel et al., 2008, Jeudy et al., 2010) could be 
used to investigate if this SUNN effect on root architecture is a local or 
systemic response. 
Finally, this study could continue at a cell-specific level. Pericycle and 
cortical cell responses to rhizobia and N could be studied over a time period 
(e.g. a 48 hour time course). Generating stable M. truncatula transgenic lines 
expressing GFP in pericycle and cortex was not successful in our study. 
Although the early generations expressed strong and cell specific GFP, this 
expression was silenced in the later generations. Using hairy root 
transformation (Deng et al., 2011) could be an alternative way to express the 
cell type specific GFP that could be used for cell sorting. Using cell type 
profiling and systems biology approaches it would be then possible to 
generate models for the root developmental interactions with the environment.
