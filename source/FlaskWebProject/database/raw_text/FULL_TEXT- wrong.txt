Abstract
Ameasurement using the ATLAS detector has been made of the fraction of events in proton-
proton collisions at
s = 7TeV that do not contain additional jets in the rapidity region
bounded by a di-jet system. This provided a strong test of perturbative QCD in the new
energy regime of the Large Hadron Collider. Additional measurements have been made of
the mean jet multiplicity in the rapidity bounded region and using a variety of different event
selections. These observation were compared to recent next to leading order dijet predictions
produced by POWHEG and a variety of leading order generators.

Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Fred and Andy for all their time and help without which this thesis
would surely have sunk faster than the Titanic. Sabah probably deserves a pay rise for all the
time he spent helping me.
Manchester is quite a marvelous place to be as a student where barely a day goes by that there
is not a cake to be enjoyed after a hard afternoon of exploring physics or more commonly
the ROOT support forums.
Spending two years at CERN was a great experience. To see decades of work by thousands
of scientists and engineers come to fruition and be part of it in some small way made the last
four years quite fullfilling.
I am also grateful for friends who managed to put up with me and hope they continue to keep
doing so.
It would of course have not been possible without the love and support my family, whom I
owe everything.
Chapter 1
Introduction
For over a year the LHC has operated at a centre of mass energy of 7 TeV. During this
initial period of running it has been very important for all the experiments to re-discover
the Standard Model of particle physics. Key to the Standard Model at any hadron-hadron
collider is the understanding of QCD, as the dominantly produced physics object in the
ATLAS detector is the jet.
An area of difficulty expected for the standard QCD predictions is the production of wide
angle radiation, whose cross section is highly uncertain theoretically. Previous to this work a
measurement of these effects had not been made at the new energies which the LHC operates
at. A measurement has been made using a central jet veto to study QCD radiation at the new
energies available at the LHC. Using results from this thesis a paper has been published by
ATLAS for the data collected in the 2010 period of proton-proton collisions.
For the purposes of theoretical comparison a number of different leading order Monte
Carlo generators were used to generate predictions. In addition to comparison between the
generators, these samples were also used for the derivation of data corrections that allowed
the removal of residual effects the detector may have upon the data. For the purposes of
this analysis it was found that the default method of generation was not sufficient for pro-
ducing samples for data correction. Two new schemes for weighting generated events were
developed to greatly improve the precision of the data corrections applied.
NLO dijet predictions have been made using the recently developed POWHEG frame-
work. Uncertainties related to the predictions have been investigated with considerations of
both the parton distribution functions and scales chosen for renormalization and factoriza-
tion.
Chapter 2
Theory
In this chapter a brief outline of the theory of quantum chromodynamics is given with some
discussion of proton-proton collisions. The jet physics object and the method of its con-
struction is described in detail. Finally the important variables and observations that will be
investigated in this thesis are identified.
2.1 The Standard Model of Particle Physics
The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics describes the interactions of the fundamental
particles through the exchange of gauge field particles [1]. These force-matter interactions
are described by Lagrangians in field theory, where the Lagrangian is classically considered
to be the difference between the kinetic and potential energy.
The particles described by the SM are the four vector bosons, which mediate the three
forces described in the SM; and twelve fermions, which are the particles that make up the
matter within our universe. The matter particles are split into two types, the leptons and
quarks. Lastly a scalar boson, known as the Higgs, is thought to provide the mechanism
through which particles acquire mass.
The three forces of nature described within the SM are the electromagnetic (EM), weak
and strong nuclear force. A fourth force, gravity, the weakest of the four fundamental forces
is not yet described by the SM, however its effect on particles is very small. The force carrier
for the EM interaction is the photon. The photon is a massless boson which transmits the
EM force between particles with charge.
The weak force allows the interaction of both quarks and leptons. The gauge invariance
of the theory is maintained by the introduction of the three gauge bosons W and Z. It is
described by a non-albelian theory, where the the gauge bosons are able to interact with
themselves. The relative weakness of the force can be explained by the massive nature of the
gauge field particles, which limits the range of interactions. The last force to be discussed
here is the strong nuclear force, and is also described by a non-albelian theory, where the
gauge boson mediating the force is the gluon. The fermions that interact through this force
are limited to the quarks as the leptons do not have a colour, where the colour is the equivalent
of charge in the EM case. This colourful force is of detailed interest within this thesis and
will be described further in the next section.
The strength of the interactions are described by the coupling constants for each of the
forces. The coupling constants vary as a function of the interaction energy, or equivalently
the distance scale, because of charge screening. In the case of non-albelian theories, such as
in the strong or weak cases, the coupling decreases with energy because of the possibility
of self interaction by the gauge bosons. Whilst for albelian theories, such as that which
describes EM interactions, see the coupling increase with energy.
The goal of research today is to test the predictive nature of the SM and to look for physics
that lies beyond well tested theory. Investigations include testing for structure in quarks and
leptons, the unification of the forces, matter-antimatter asymmetry and the incorporation of
the force of gravity to name a few.
2.2 Quantum Chromodynamics and Hadron-Hadron In-
teractions
Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes the strong interactions between coloured quarks
and gluons. Within the SM there are three generations of quarks
where u, d, c, s, t, b are the up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom quarks respectively.
The up, charm and top quarks all have a charge + 2
. The down, strange and bottom quarks all
have charge  1
. The force carrier of the strong interaction is the gluon. The SM Lagrangian
of QCD is given by
q,a(i
ab  gstCabA
  mqab)q,b 
, (2.1)
where q,a are the quark-field spinors for a quark of flavour q and mass m; 
 are the Dirac
-matrices; gs is the strong coupling and is related to s by g
s = 4s; A
 is the gluon field
and Fa is the gluon field strength tensor for a gluon colour index a [2]. The first term in the
equation handles the propagation and interaction of quarks and the second handles the gluon
propagation and self-interaction.
The interaction vertices for QCD, which are encapsulated in the Lagrangian above, are
shown in figure 2.1. QCD has the property of asymptotic freedom, where as the interaction
energy increases the strong coupling decreases. It is in this high energy limit that perturbation
theory becomes applicable. The converse is true; as quarks move apart the force becomes
stronger, requiring an infinite amount of energy to separate two quarks. This confining nature
of the strong interaction leads to the absence of free quarks and in general why we only
observe colourless final states.
(a) (b) (c)
Figure 2.1: Interaction vertices of QCD where the curly line represents the gluon and straight
lines fermions. Taken from [3]
The main tool for solving the QCD Lagrangian is perturbative quantum field theory. The
definition of the partonic scattering cross section is given by
dabF =
2sab
|MabF |2(F; F , R), (2.2)
where |M|2 are the matrix element squared of the process summed and averaged over the
helicities and colours. F and R are the factorization and renormalization scales respec-
tively. The factorization scale separates long and short distance physics, below the scale the
parton is absorbed into hadron structure. The leading order (LO) Feynman diagrams for jet
production are shown in figure 2.2. Also shown in figure 2.3 are some of the next to lead-
ing order (NLO) Feynman diagrams, which show additional real emissions and virtual loop
corrections that are important at this level.

the parton distribution functions fa,b give the probability of finding a parton of momentum
xa,b with a flavour a, b within a proton when it is probed by an interaction of scale F . A long
time after the parton interaction the transition of the produced partons to colourless hadrons
is handled by the fragmentation function DF .
Underlying Event
The underlying event is the energy which is attributed to the primary proton interaction but
not originating from the hardest parton interaction. There is a non-negligible probability that
there will be more than one interaction between pairs of partons within the same proton-
proton collision, this is known as multiple partonic interactions. Additionally if after the
collision the protons disassociate then their remnants will add to the underlying event.
2.3 Jets
Jets are collimated sprays of hadrons carrying the momentum from the interaction. It is
useful to describe the kinematic properties of jets in terms of Lorentz invariant quantities.
The rapidity is defined as
E + pz
E  pz
, (2.4)
where E is the energy and pz is the momentum along the direction of the beam. The trans-
verse momentum of a jet is defined as
(2.5)
where px and py are the transverse momenta in the x and y directions respectively.
2.3.1 Important Properties
A number of important properties for jet algorithms have been identified in [4], including
invariance under boosts, order independence, infrared safety and collinear safety. Invariance
under boosts requires that jet properties do not change when observed in a different frame.
Order independence states that the jets identified at the parton level should be the same as
those identified at hadron level and also after measurement by a detector.
Infrared Safety
Proton-proton collisions will typically contain a large number of low pT particles in each
event. Jet algorithms must avoid being sensitive to these particles. Jet algorithms which use
seeds can be especially sensitive to these problems, as shown in figure 2.4 where if there
is a low pT object present between the high pT objects then they may all be merged into a
single jet. This would leave jets sensitive to large uncertainties in both measuring these low
pT objects and also predicting them.
(a) (b)
Figure 2.4: Examples of clustering of entities into jets using an infrared unsafe algorithm
with (a) and without (b) an additional soft entity.
Collinear Safety
The jet algorithm should also not be sensitive to the case where a particle is replaced with
two collinear particles. In figure 2.5 a jet algorithm which uses seeds may fail to identify the
jet if the parton is split.
2.3.2 Anti-kt Jets
The standard method of creating jet objects in ATLAS uses the anti-kt jet algorithm [5],
which is both infrared and collinear safe. The anti-kt jet algorithm constructs jets through
(a) (b)
Figure 2.5: Examples of jet finding with (a) and without (b) collinear splitting of the parton.
iterative recombination of entities. Examples of entities used by ATLAS are the clusters
of energy measured in the calorimeter, particles measured by the tracker and truth particles
from the Monte Carlo event record. The decision to cluster entities is handled through the
distance metrics
di j = min(p
T i, p
, (2.6)
diB = p
T i, (2.7)
where pT i is the transverse momentum of the i-th entity, R is the recombination parameter
and i j is the distance between the i-th and j-th entity defined as
i j =
(yi  y j)2 + (i   j)2, (2.8)
where yi and i are the rapidity and polar angle of the i-th entity respectively. For each pair
of entities di j and diB are calculated and then sorted from smallest to largest. If the smallest
effective distance is the di j case then the i-th and j-th entities are combined, in the diB case
the i-th entity is removed from the list and it becomes a jet. This process repeats until all the
entities have formed jets.
(b) (c)
Figure 2.6: Catchment areas of jets formed around boxes that represent high pT entities.
Two equally high pT entities are considered in (a), (c) and (d). The asymmetric energy case
is considered in (b). i j is the distance between the original high pT entities.
The result of the clustering procedure is that low pT entities will tend to cluster with the
high pT entities first. This will cause the formation of cone shaped jets around the high pT
entities. So for the case where two high pT entities are separated by more than double the jet
radius parameter, figure 2.6(a), two cone shaped jets will be formed. As the distance between
the high pT entities falls then shape of the jets will change depending upon the relative pT.
For the case of asymmetric pT, shown in figure 2.6(b), the higher pT entity will still form a
cone shaped jet whilst the other will form a crescent shaped jet. In the completely symmetric
case, in figure 2.6(c), the boundary between the jets will be a straight line. Finally if the two
entities are sufficiently close, figure 2.6(d), they will be merged into one jet with a possibly
complex shape.
The clustering properties of the anti-kt algorithm result in jets are less sensitive to soft
energy including pile-up, which is energy from additional proton-proton interactions; and the
underlying event. The reduced sensitivity to soft energy has the downside that the algorithm
will also be less adaptive to soft and collinear emission expected to occur for the energetic
particles coming from the hard interaction.
2.4 Inclusive Jet and Dijet Cross Sections
The measurements of the inclusive jet and dijet cross sections are a strong test of perturbative
QCD and so form an important component of the benchmark processes that the LHC must
measure to rediscover the Standard Model. In addition, the increase in the centre-of-mass
energy at the LHCwill allow much higher jet energies to be probed, possibly uncovering new
phenomena such as excited quarks, axigluons and colour octet scalar resonances. Already
ATLAS has searched for resonances from new phenomena in the dijet mass spectrum, finding
no evidence up to a mass of  4TeV [6]. Jets at hadron colliders also form an important
background to many searches in other channels, further necessitating precision measurement
to increase the sensitivity in those searches as well.
2.4.1 Variables of Interest
The first distribution of interest is the inclusive single jet cross section
d|y|dpT
(2.9)
where |y| and pT are the absolute rapidity and the transverse momentum of the jet. The mini-
mum pT considered here was 20 GeV and the maximum rapidity 4.4. The second distribution
investigated is the double differential cross section
dydm j j
(2.10)
where y = |y1  y2|/2 is the corresponding rapidity of the jets in their mutual centre of mass
frame and m j j the dijet mass. To allow for comparison with fixed order perturbative QCD it
is necessary to also apply a cut requiring that
pT 1  pT 2 + , (2.11)
where pT 1 and pT 2 are the minimum transverse momenta of the two leading jets, and  is a
non-zero constant. As  0 the fixed order predictions become unstable [7]. The instability
is caused by the vetoing of soft radiation leading to large uncanceled virtual corrections. In
this thesis pT 1 = 30GeV and pT 2 = 20GeV are considered for these distributions.
2.5 Dijet With a Central Jet Veto
The main analysis goal of this thesis was to make a measurement of the jet environment
restricted to a rapidity region between a chosen dijet system. As a simplification of a typical
event one can consider the energy originating from the interaction flowing through a cylin-
der, which behaves as an ideal detector. In figure 2.7 a typical layout of an event structure
is projected onto the surface of a cylinder, whose centre is the position of interaction. The
circles on the surface of the cylinder represent areas where energy from the interaction inter-
sects the cylinder. The yellow region is defined to be the interval within which a test is made
for additional energy.
2.5.1 Variables of Interest
The primary test of the central jet veto (CJV) study is the fraction of events which do not
contain additional radiation above a certain minimum threshold in the defined interval region.
This quantity shall be referred to as the gap fraction and is defined as
Figure 2.7: Visualization of the energy flow from an interaction through a cylindrical surface.
The yellow region indicates the area to be tested for additional radiation.
Gap Fraction =
empty
total
, (2.12)
where empty is the cross section for events that satisfy a veto requirement of no additional
radiation in the interval region and total is the total cross section. The gap fraction was
studied as a function of both the size of the interval between the dijet system, |y|, and the
average transverse momentum, pT, of the jets which defined the interval. As |y| increases
in size the available phase space available for the emission of radiation increases and so
the gap fraction should fall. However as both |y| and pT increase conservation of energy
will prevent the production of radiation and so the gap fraction should slow its descent and
eventually start to rise again.
The explicit requirement for the additional radiation is that there should be no jet found
in the interval region with
pT 3 > Q0, (2.13)
where Q0 is a scale chosen to be as low as minimally possible for the detector to measure
accurately. The dependence of the gap fraction as the veto scale Q0 is varied is also of
interest. By varying the Q0 the dependence of the soft underlying physics can be tested. If
a high value of Q0 is chosen then there should be little effect from the underlying event or
pile-up.
Another test of the CJV is the average multiplicity of jets, N jet within the interval region
above the veto scale. The behavior is opposite to the gap fraction, where N jet will rise with
increasing |y|. Again this quantity will be investigated as a function of both |y| and pT.
2.5.2 Kinematic Selection
There were three kinematic selections considered in the dijet with CJV analysis, these shall
be referred to as selection A, B and C. By default the jets used in the selection definitions
were found using the anti-kt jet algorithm with R = 0.6. The only deviation from these
kinematic selections occurs in chapter 7 where anti-kt jet algorithm with R = 0.4 jets were
also considered and the veto threshold in selection A is varied.
Selection A
1. All considered jets must have |y| < 4.4.
2. Interval defining jets are the two highest pT jets.
3. The interval defining jets must both have pT > 20GeV and pT =
(pT1 + pT2)/2 > 50GeV.
4. The veto jet transverse momentum threshold is Q0 = 20GeV.
Figure 2.8: Diagram of the selection A in a typical event layout.
In figure 2.8 a typical layout of the event structure unrolled into the rapidity- plane is shown
for selection A. The yellow region indicates the area of the detector where the jets are tested
for the veto requirement, the extent of this region is between the centres of the objects iden-
tified as 1 and 2. If object 3 of the event meets the veto requirement then the interval region
will be defined as filled. Object 4 does not play a role in this event as it neither defines the
interval region nor resides in a position where it would be considered as a possible veto.
Selection B
1. All considered jets must have |y| < 4.4.
2. The two interval defining jets are the most forward and backward
jets in rapidity with pT > 20GeV
3. The interval defining jets must have pT = (pT1 + pT2)/2 > 50GeV.
4. The veto jet transverse momentum threshold is Q0 = 20GeV.
Figure 2.9: Diagram of the selection B in a typical event layout.
In figure 2.9 a typical layout of the event structure unrolled into the rapidity- plane is shown
for selection B. As in the previous selection the yellow region indicates the area of the detec-
tor where the jets are tested for the veto requirement, the extent of this region is now defined
between the centres of the objects identified as 1 and 4 as these jets are the most forward and
backward jets that satisfy the minimum pT threshold for interval definition jets. There are
now two jets inside the interval region that must have their energy tested. By making this
selection the pT of events will be typically smaller than selection A.
Selection C
1. All considered jets must have |y| < 4.4.
2. The two interval defining jets are most forward and backward jets
in rapidity with pT > 20GeV
3. The interval defining jets must have pT = (pT1 + pT2)/2 > 50GeV.
4. The veto jet transverse momentum threshold is Q0 = pT .
The only difference between selection B and C is the choice of veto definition. In selection
C the veto threshold equal to pT, therefore adjusts on an event-by-event basis.

Chapter 3
The LHC and ATLAS
In this chapter the Large Hadron Collider is described. This includes a brief description of
the accelerator complex, the evolution of the collider energy and a discussion of the machine
luminosity. The ATLAS detector including the inner detector tracker, calorimeters, magnet
system and trigger system will also be described. The chapter finishes with a description of
the reconstruction and calibration of jets.
3.1 Large Hadron Collider
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1][2][3], situated on the border of France and Switzer-
land, is the largest and most powerful particle physics facility constructed to date. The LHC
accelerator is housed in a 26.7 km ring in which two proton beams rotating in opposite di-
rections are brought into collision at four interaction points. The sites of those collisions
are the experiments ATLAS, ALICE, CMS and LHCb. ATLAS and CMS are general pur-
pose detectors whilst ALICE and LHCb specialise in the areas of heavy ion and B-physics
respectively.
3.1.1 Accelerator Complex
The LHC uses almost all of the accelerators present at the CERN facility to to produce
the proton beams in the correct configuration and energy. The configuration of the beams
includes the number of protons per bunch, the number of bunches of protons and the spac-
ing between the bunches. The protons are successively accelerated by Linac2, Proton Syn-
chrotron Booster (PSB), Proton Synchrotron (PS) and the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS)
before they are injected into the main LHC ring at an energy of 450GeV. Figure 3.1 shows
the layout of the accelerators.
In the main ring, the two beams are accelerated using the same superconducting magnets
but in separate beam pipes. There are 9300 superconducting magnets in the main ring which
operate at temperatures below 1.9K.
Figure 3.1: The LHC accelerator layout [4].
Collision Point
There are long straight sections of the accelerator at the four interaction points. Dipole
and quadrupole magnets are used to steer and focus the beams towards a collision point
at a non-zero crossing angle. The beams are kept apart as long as possible to prevent the
occurrence of parasitic collisions, where there is a collision between two protons outside of
the experimental detectors.
3.1.2 Beam Energy
Early Problems
The design beam energy of the LHC is 7 TeV for each beam. Issues arising from the prepa-
ration of the magnets resulted in the planned beam energy being lowered to 5 TeV in 2008.
Unfortunately an incident involving the connection between two magnets resulted in an ex-
plosion which caused damage to the accelerator [5]. This incident resulted in a delay to the
start of LHC operations whilst magnets were repaired and work was carried out to prevent
the same incident from happening again. In late 2009, the first collisions occurred at an
energy of 450GeV per beam and reached 1.18 TeV per beam before Christmas.
Physics Operation
The beam energy of 3.5 TeV was reached in early 2010 and is still the highest operating
energy. A short period of proton-proton collisions were taken in 2011 with beams of energy
2.76 TeV. It is not expected that the design energy of 7 TeV will be reached until 2013 as a
number of technical improvements are needed [6], which are planned for the long shutdown.
3.1.3 Machine Luminosity
The luminosity of the machine can be described by the formula
kN2 f
4xy
(3.1)
where k is the number of bunches, N is the number of protons in each bunch, f is the
revolution frequency, x and y are the beam sizes at the collision point. The luminosity can
be increased by decreasing the area of the beams at the collision point, increasing the number
of protons, or increasing the number of bunches. At peak luminosity operation in 2010, the
operating conditions consisted of 348 bunches containing 1.2  1011 protons producing a
luminosity of 2  1032 cm2s1.
The design luminosity for the LHC is 1034 cm2s1, where the luminosity times the cross
section is the collision rate. This was expected to be achieved with 2808 bunches containing
1.15  1011 protons each.
3.2 ATLAS
The ATLAS experiment (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) [7] is situated at Point 1 on the LHC
ring. ATLAS is a general purpose experimental apparatus. ATLAS has been designed to
investigate a wide range of physics including QCD, gauge bosons, B final states, top, heavy
ion collisions and a range of exotic physics. The subdetectors are arranged in concentric lay-
ers surrounding the interaction point. Closest to the interaction is the inner tracking detector,
which reconstructs charged particles. Outside this layer the calorimeters reside, which pro-
vide granular energy measurements of energy deposited by jets. The outermost layers are
dedicated to the measurement of the properties of muons. The diagram showing the main
subdetectors of the ATLAS experiment is shown in figure 3.2. The massive scale of the ex-
periment is illustrated by the size of the human figures within the diagram. Further details of
these subdetectors will be given in the following sections.
3.2.1 Conventions
There are a number of conventions and definitions used by the ATLAS collaboration: -
1. The positive x direction points towards the centre of the ring and the positive y direc-
tion vertically upwards. Using a right handed coordinate system the positive z direction
is parallel with the beam towards LHCb.
Figure 3.2: The ATLAS detector [7].
2. The polar angle  is defined from the beam axis
cot() =
x2 + y2
(3.2)
3. The azimuthal angle is defined around the beam axis
tan() =
(3.3)
where px and py are the momenta in the x-direction and y-direction.
4. The pseudorapidity is defined as
 = ln
(3.4)
Figure 3.3: The inner detector layout.
3.2.2 Inner Detector Tracker
The inner detector as depicted in figure 3.3 is constructed out of a number of sub detectors
which lie close to the interaction point. The inner detector allows the measurement of the
sign and momentum of charged particles using the curvature of the track in the 2 T magnet
field. A number of layers are needed to measure the position of particles along their track
with high precision.
The inner detector allows the measurement of the interaction vertices in each event to
be made with high efficiency. The efficiency for reconstructing a vertex is greater than 99%
when the number of tracks with pT > 100MeV is greater than 3. The position resolution of
vertices in events with more than 70 tracks or
trk p
> 8GeV is 30m in the transverse
plane and 50m in the direction of the beam [8]. The reconstruction efficiency for tracks
has been observed to be greater than 80% for tracks with pT > 500 MeV and || < 1 [9].
The track reconstruction efficiency falls to 60% at || = 2.5, the edge of the inner detectors
acceptance. The fall of the efficiency at high || is due to the increased amount of material in
this region.
Pixel Detectors
The innermost layers of the inner detector are composed of the silicon pixel detectors [10],
consisting of three barrel layers and three disks at each side of the forward region. The silicon
pixel detectors provide high granularity measurements close to the interaction point, and so
contribute greatly to the vertex measurement. In the barrel the R- accuracy is 10 m and z
accuracy is 115 m. In the end-caps the R- accuracy is 10 m and R accuracy is 115 m.
Semiconductor Tracker
The next sub-detector that particles pass through is the semiconductor tracker (SCT) [11],
which is constructed from Silicon Strip Modules. Pairs of modules are glued back to back
with a 40mrad stereo angle between the sensors. These are arranged in a central barrel with
four cylindrical layers and nine disks at either side of the forward region. In the barrel the
R- accuracy is 17 m and z accuracy is 580 m. In the end-caps the R- accuracy is 17 m
and R accuracy is 580 m.
Transition Radiation Tracker
The final sub-detector important for tracking in the inner detector is the Transition Radiation
Tracker (TRT) which consists of around 300,000 proportional drift tubes [11]. As particles
pass through the tubes the gas is ionised, the electrons then drift to the wire where a signal is
produced. The R- accuracy is 130 m. The TRT also provides particle identification as the
emission of transition radiation is different for hadrons and electrons.
3.2.3 Calorimetry
The goal of the calorimeters is to measure the energy of the photons, electrons, jets and the
missing transverse momentum. They can also provide information for particle identification.
The ATLAS calorimeter is hermetic; it provides large angle coverage for   4.9 and com-
plete  coverage [12]. The fractional energy resolution for pT = 20 GeV jets was evaluated
from MC to be 18%, whilst for pT > 100 GeV the resolution was < 9%. A number of
in situ techniques have been investigated by ATLAS to test the reliability of MC prediction
for the reconstruction efficiency and energy resolution of measured jets [13]. The selection
efficiency, determined through a tag and probe technique using jets composed of of tracks,
was seen to be greater than 98% for jets with pT > 20 GeV. The jet energy resolution was
measured using two techniques, the di-jet balance method and the bi-sector method. In both
cases it was seen that the MC correctly describes the jet energy resolution within 14%.

Electromagnetic Calorimeter
The electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter is able to reconstruct with good resolution the energy
of electrons and photons over a wide range of energies. It is important for the ability to
distinguish electrons, photons and jets. The primary interaction which occurs when a high
energy electron interacts with matter is bremsstrahlung, the emission of a photon. Whilst
a high energy photon when interacting with matter will produce an electron and positron
pair. In this way a shower of particles will develop, where the path length through the
material controls the number of interactions and hence the number of electrons produced.
The calorimeter alternates between an absorber material which develops the shower through
the EM interactions and electrodes which measure the current of electrons drifting in the
gaps. The EM calorimeter uses liquid Argon (LAr) as an active medium and Lead as the
absorber. The LAr EM barrel calorimeter is found in the central region || < 1.475, and the
LAr EM end-cap calorimeter is present in the range 1.375 < || < 3.2. The LAr calorimeter
can be seen in figure 3.4.
Hadronic Calorimeter
The task of the hadronic calorimeter is to reconstruct jets and measure the missing transverse
energy. It has low noise, high granularity and must be of sufficient thickness for the shower to
be fully encapsulated in the calorimeter. The high energy hadrons interact with the absorber
material through the strong interaction. The result of the interaction is the production of sev-
eral lower energy hadrons. This process repeats until the hadrons stop or are absorbed. The
hadronic LAr calorimeters are split into two components; the hadronic end-cap calorimeter
covers the region 1.5 < || < 3.2, and the forward calorimeter 3.1 < || < 4.9. The LAr
hadronic end-cap uses Copper as an absorber whilst the forward calorimeter uses both Tung-
sten and Copper. The hadronic tile calorimeter, which is a sampling calorimeter made from
steel plates interspersed with scintillators, provides coverage in the central pseudorapidity
region || < 1.7.
3.2.4 Magnet System
The ATLAS magnet system [14] is composed of the Central Solenoid together with the
Barrel and End-Cap Toroids. The Central Solenoid operates at a current of 7.7 kA to produce
a 2 T axial magnetic field within the inner detector. The Toroid magnets are installed outside
of the calorimeter and operate at 20.4 kA to produce a 1 T tangential magnetic field for the
muon detectors.
3.2.5 Muon System
The muon system is composed of four different detector chamber technologies that lie out-
ermost from the interaction point, where few particles other than neutrinos and muons can
reach. The four systems are the Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs), Monitored Drift Tube
(MDT) chambers, Cathode Strip Chambers (CSCs) and the Thin Gap Chambers (TGCs) [7].
To measure the track properties three points on muons track must be identified, as with the
inner detectors measurement of tracks. The RPCs form the first layer encountered within the
barrel region, || < 1. The RPC is a simple gaseous detector which provide trigger informa-
tion. Next to be encountered are the MDTs, which provide the precision track measurement.
In the forward most region of instrumentation for detecting muons, 2 < || < 2.7, mea-
surement of the muon tracks is made by the CSCs. The CSCs are multiwire proportional
chambers which measure the passage of a muon by the formation of an avalanche on the
anode wire. Here the TGCs provide the triggering information and additional track measure-
ments.
3.2.6 Trigger System
The expected rate of interactions is too high to record the detector information for all the
events observed so a selection must be made. This selection is carried out by the trigger
system. The trigger system is made up of 3 levels; Level 1, Level 2 and the Event Filter.
The Level 1 trigger is limited to a subset of detector information and the decision must be
made within 2.5 s to handle the design interaction rate of 40MHz. At maximum, the Level 1
trigger can accept an event rate of 75 kHz but during 2010 the maximum rate kept was 30 kHz
[15]. If accepted by the Level 1 trigger the event is transferred to Level 2 where regions of
interest identified in the first level are investigated. Level 2 has complete access to the data
but is still limited by time restrictions. The rate is lowered by Level 2 to approximately
3 kHz.
The final stage of the trigger system is the Event Filter which can run reconstruction
algorithms of greater complexity because it has more time to make its decision. This results
in improved efficiency and the ability to set tighter thresholds. The final maximum event rate
recordable to disk was 200Hz.
Minimum Bias Triggers
The Minimum Bias Trigger Scintillators (MBTS), which also lies within the inner detector,
and the silicon tracking detectors provide the minimum bias triggers. The MBTS is divided
into two rings and eight  sections that cover the region 2.09 < || < 3.84. The efficiency
for triggering on an event when there is a track incident on the MBTS with pT > 100 MeV
is above 97% [16]. Given this high efficiency it makes the MBTS an invaluable tool for
evaluating the absolute trigger efficiency for the jet triggers.
Jet Triggers
The jet triggers select events which contain high transverse momentum deposits in the Liquid
Argon and Tile calorimeters [11]. For || < 3.2 at Level 1 a - sliding window of
dimensions 0.4  0.4, 0.6  0.6 and 0.8  0.8 is used to search for energy deposits above a
chosen threshold. In the Forward Calorimeter there is no  granularity at Level 1. The Level
2 trigger uses a simplified cone algorithm to find jets whilst the Event Filter uses the same
jet algorithms as physics analysis. The Event Filter for the jet triggers was not enabled for
data collected in 2010. The performance of the jet triggers were seen to be very good with
efficiencies > 99% observed for events containing jets with pT > 60GeV within the region
of || < 3.2 [17].
3.3 Jet Reconstruction
Jets in ATLAS are reconstructed from energy deposited in the calorimeter system. Clusters
of energy are built from cells in all of the calorimeter layers, and these clusters are then used
as input to the jet algorithms. The cells from which the clusters are built are calibrated to the
electromagnetic (EM) scale. The EM scale is defined to be the calibration where the energy
of electrons and photons are measured correctly by the calorimeters. After cluster building
and jet finding the jets are calibrated through the application of the jet energy scale (JES).
The jet algorithm used to reconstruct the jets was anti-kt with radius parameters R = 0.6
and R = 0.4.
Truth jets are constructed from running the same anti-kt jet algorithms over the stable
particles in the Monte Carlo event record, but not including either muons or neutrinos.
3.3.1 Initial Calibration
A calibration is necessary to convert the calorimeter signals measured in picoColoumbs to
the energy that the particles have deposited. In ATLAS it was chosen that all energies should
be first reconstructed to the electromagnetic energy (EM) scale. These calibration factors
have been obtained by exposing the calorimeters to test beams of electrons and muons with
a range of known energies [18].
3.3.2 Cluster building
Clusters are built from neighbouring cells in the calorimeters, where the neighbours include
both the surrounding eight cells within each layer and those cells in the surrounding layers
[19]. Varying granularity of each layer can result in more than ten neighbouring cells. Given
that the clusters lie across multiple layers of calorimeter, they are known as 3d topological
clusters. These exploit the fine granularity in the calorimeter system to give a detailed picture
of the shower development. The steps to build a 3d topological cluster are:
1. Identify calorimeter seed cells which have a large signal to noise ratio, |E| > 4 where
E is the energy of the cell and  is the noise level of the cell;
2. Iteratively combine seed cells with neighbouring cells that satisfy |E| > 2 to form
protoclusters. During this process neighbouring seeds may be merged;
3. All the direct neighbours with |E| > 0 are added to each of the protoclusters.
After the protoclusters have been built a splitting procedure is applied. Within the proto-
clusters local maxima are found. For these maxima, cells must satisfy the requirements of
E > 500MeV, energy greater than any neighbouring cells and there must be more than three
cells within the protocluster with |E| > 4. Clusters are re-grown around these local maxima
without any noise requirements or merging of protoclusters. This helps to prevent the for-
mation of clusters covering large fractions of the detector. A typical value of the noise in the
EM calorimeter was seen to be 10-40MeV, with higher levels of noise seen in the forward
region.
3.3.3 Calibration to hadron level
The EM scale calibration previously applied does not account for a number of effects in-
cluding the different fraction of energy that hadrons deposit, inactive material in the detector,
particles not contained in the calorimeter, particles that fall outside the reconstructed jet and
inefficiencies of clustering and reconstruction. To account for these a jet energy scale cor-
rection is applied on a jet-by-jet basis depending on the  and pT of the jet [20]. Through
the matching of MC Truth jets and jets at the EM scale the response can be determined,
REM(p
jet,EM
, ), and so the calibrated momentum of the jets are
= [1/R
jet,EM
, )]  pjet,EM
, (3.5)
this results in no directional change for the jet. This calibration was shown to correct isolated
jet energy to within 2% [20]. The jets are now calibrated to what is known as the EM+JES
level. This was the final calibration applied before the jets were used in the analysis. A num-
ber of crosschecks using data have been performed by ATLAS to validate the JES calibration
derived, one such tool being the jet-photon balance [21].
Pile-up correction
The default jet energy scale that was applied to the EM+JES calibrated topological cluster
jets contains a simple correction for additional energy originating from pile-up [22], which is
considered to be uncorrelated with the primary scatter and its jets. This correction does not
attempt to remove energy from other sources of underlying event, such as multiple partonic
interactions.
The energy offset was derived through the measurement of the energy density in the
calorimeter towers using events where one primary vertex was required. This offset was
translated to the topological cluster jets by using the average calorimeter tower multiplicity
per jet. The correction required can be considered to be a function of the , the number
of primary vertices and the bunch spacing, although the bunch spacing had not yet become
important for the 2010 data.
Jet energy scale uncertainty
There are a number of sources of uncertainty for the JES calibration including an uncertainty
from single particle propagation, variation of the noise levels in the calorimeters, the MC
tune and model used in the evaluation and pile-up. The largest source of uncertainty was the
single particle propagation using both in situ techniques and also test-beam measurements
[20]. The residual bias after the pile-up correction of  0.5GeV is estimated to be  160MeV
per additional vertex for jets with || < 1.9. Higher uncertainties in the forward region should
have minimal effect for the higher pT interval defining jets and the central veto jet is typically
found at low values of ||.

Chapter 4
Monte Carlo Generation
In this chapter the basic process of Monte Carlo event generation is described and details
about the leading order Monte Carlo generators used are given. The predictions made for
the dijet with jet veto measurement are shown for these Monte Carlo generators. A short
description of the computer simulation of the ATLAS detector follows. Finally two methods
for producing weighted Monte Carlo event samples are described.
4.1 Monte Carlo Generator Theory
Monte Carlo (MC) event generation provides a way to simulate the type of events that are
expected to be produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC.
4.1.1 General Program Flow
1. The generation of the hard process takes place using perturbation theory.
2. Additional partonic activity is generated. Including initial and final state radiation,
multiple partonic interactions and beam remnants.
3. The mostly non-perturbative physics is modeled. The fragmentation, hadronisation
and decay to stable particles is handled.
4.1.2 PYTHIA
PYTHIA 6 [1] is a Monte Carlo generator capable of simulating the QCD dijet process events
at leading order accuracy. The parton shower used in the generation is ordered in transverse
momentum of the radiation. These samples cover the production of 2  2 parton scatters
within a range of 17 < pT < 1120GeV, this is accomplished through the use of multiple
slices with different parton pT min and pT max. A subset of parameters is listed in table 4.1 for
the samples considered in this chapter for standard PYTHIA.
Parton pT min [GeV] Parton pT max [GeV] Cross Section [nb]

35 70 4.10104
70 140 2.19103

280 560 2.35100
560 1120 3.36102
Table 4.1: Parameters for standard PYTHIA dijet samples. Each sample contains 1.4million
events.
The tune used for the FORTRAN PYTHIA samples is AMBT1 [2]. The parameters
considered for this tune consisted of MPI, colour reconnection, initial and final state radiation
variables. The data used in the making of this tune included the CDF runs 1 and 2; and
ATLAS 0.9TeV and early 7 TeV data. The ATLAS data received a higher weighting. The
PDF used for this tune was MRST 2007LO* [3]. The LO* PDF is a leading order PDF
with some modifications to make it behave more like a NLO PDF, including the relaxation
of the momentum sum rule and the use of the NLO strong coupling definition. In a range
of standard model processes the LO* PDF set combined with a LO matrix element process
was observed to provide the best agreement with NLO PDF combined with a NLO matrix
element process [3]. Thus when only the LO matrix element is available for a process the
LO* PDF would be expected to provide the prediction closest to the truth.
4.1.3 Herwig++
Herwig++ [4] is another general purpose event generator which provides leading order di-
jet production with parton showering, hadronization and multiple interactions. The par-
ton shower used is angular ordered, and so the largest angle emissions are handled first.
Herwig++ events were generated with the LHC-UE7-1 tune, which also uses the MRST
2007LO* PDF.
4.1.4 Alpgen
Alpgen [5] provides the generation of leading order processes of up to six outgoing parton
legs. The subsequent evolution of the event is handled by HERWIG+Jimmy [6, 7], which
showers, hadronizes and produces the multiple partonic interactions. The PDF used for
the production of Alpgen events was CTEQ6l1 [8]. The ALPGEN samples used where
generated by the ATLAS collaboration and have limited event numbers.
4.2 Monte Carlo Predictions
A set of predictions for the dijet with jet veto analysis are shown in figure 4.1 for the case
where the interval is defined by the two highest pT jets. In figure 4.1a the predictions for
the gap fraction diverge at large |y|; both Herwig++ and Alpgen gap fractions fall relative
to PYTHIA 6. This is consistent with figure 4.1c where the average number of jets in the
interval region is higher in the Alpgen and Herwig++ cases. Alpgen is seen to produce
significantly more jets than the other generators.
In a variety of regions within figure 4.1 differences of up to 50% are seen between the MC
predictions. The variation seen in the predictions can be considered to be representative of
the likely large instrinsic theoretical uncertainties, which are expected for these variables. A
more detailed evaluation of theoretical uncertainties can be found in [9], where uncertainties
of a similar scale to the variation in figure 4.1 can be seen. These substantial uncertainties are
the dominant motivation for the investigation of other possibly more accurate MC programs.
4.3 Detector Simulation
After events had been generated in one of the MC generators it was possible to apply the
full detector simulation to the final stable states of the MC event. ATLAS has developed a
comprehensive software framework called Athena [10] within which the simulation of the
ATLAS detector takes place. The GEANT4 [11] framework is used for the simulation of
particles interacting with the detector volume. The reconstruction of these simulated events
is made using the same algorithms that were used for data collected by the detector. The
precise geometry of the ATLAS detector needs to be described, including all the material
with which particles may interact. Dead material in which energy can be lost is considered
to be important for the accurate simulation of the detector. The conditions of the detector
during operation such as the alignment of detectors, mapping of the magnetic fields and the
temperature distribution were also considered.
4.4 Event Weighting
Inside the ATLAS software framework it is possible to apply filtering algorithms, which
allows a specific event to be retained for the full simulation stage. Application of these
algorithms is applied after the event has been generated by the Monte Carlo generator. This
makes it a generally applicable method for any of the Monte Carlo generators inside the
Athena framework. Using the information present in the truth event record and derived truth
jets allows events of interest to be selected. In this case we would like to increase the yield
of events with large intervals between the leading jets.
The standard PYTHIA dijet samples that the ATLAS collaboration produce are un-
weighted. Thus to cover the entire phase space for dijet production requires that the events
are produced in sets with parton pT in different ranges. A deficiency of these samples is

that the region of large rapidity separation is poorly sampled. Figure 4.2 shows the number
of events generated as a function of the average transverse momentum versus the rapidity
separation of the leading two jets. The deficiency in the large |y| region is clear; large
|y| regions have few, if any, events. This could have a detrimental impact on using these
events to compare data to MC, in particular the MC will be used for systematic uncertainty
determination.

Although simply increasing the sample sizes could overcome the problems it would re-
quire simulating a factor of 100-1000 more events. At peak production of fully simulated
events, ATLAS is able to produce  10 million events per day. To obtain the necessary event
numbers it would take somewhere between 60 and 600 days, if ATLAS were to dedicate all
its resources to this analysis. So the use of unweighted events is simply not possible with the
relatively time consuming ATLAS full simulation. To overcome these shortcomings filtered
and weighted events needed to be generated, which target the underpopulated phase space
regions
Two weighting schemes were developed to compensate for the rapidly falling dijet cross
section at large rapidity separations. The first involves simply weighting events by the ra-
pidity separation of the leading jets, and the second by both the separation and the pT of the
lead jet in the event. Both allow the use of greater levels of weighting to access the largest
values of |y| which are kinematically allowed at the LHC.
4.4.1 Rapidity separation weighted samples
Weighting Function
The weighting is carried out using an acceptance-rejection method whose weight will vary as
a function of |y|. A Gaussian function is used to represent the |y| distribution. An example
of this can be seen in figure 4.3, where there is seen to be reasonable agreement even for
such a simple model. The weight is then given by the expression
|y|
|y|max
) for |y| < |y|max (4.1)
where |y| is the interval size between the leading jets,  is the width of the fitted Gaus-
sian distribution,  is the mean of the fitted Gaussian distribution and |y|max is the maximum
interval size which is to be weighted, referred to in text as the control point. Above the con-
trol point the events are all kept with unit weight.
The parameters used for the weighting function are given in table 4.2. The cross section
falls as the parton pT increases, which is expected because it requires more energetic jets to
produce the same pT jets at higher rapidity values. The inverse of the efficiency numbers
gives a rule of thumb for how many events need to be generated on average for one to be
kept by the filter. For example approximately 625 events need to be generated for one event
to pass the filtering.
Weighted Generation
The steps carried out to generate rapidity separation weighted samples are

algorithm is anti-kt and uses a radius parameter of R = 0.6. This is the same choice of
jet algorithm primarily used in the main analysis presented in this thesis.
2. Events are filtered by requiring at least two jets with pT > 12GeV in the event.
3. The |y| between the two highest pT jets in the event is calculated.
4. The event weight is calculated using the formula 4.1 with the events interval size.
5. A random number is generated between zero and one. The event is kept if the random
number is less than the inverse of the event weight.
Results
It can be seen in figure 4.4 that the coverage of the new weighted sample is greatly improved
over the standard events in figure 4.2. Even the high pT region, where the weighted samples
are significantly smaller, still shows great improvement.

function of |y| of the leading jets.
4.4.2 pT and |y| weighted samples
A deficiency found in the previous weighted samples was that only selecting events based
on the |y| value would reduce the fraction of events which had both high |y| and pT within
each individual parton pT slice. This problem can be seen in figure 4.4 where there is a lack
of events in the region 180 < pT < 250 GeV. To counteract this, a new improved weighting
method was developed.
Weighted Function
A two dimensional function considering both the leading jet pT and also the |y| is used. The
functional form used to represent the unweighted distribution is a mixture model composed
of a set of bivariate distributions represented by equation (4.2)
F(|y|, pT ) =
wi fi(|y|, pT ) (4.2)
where wi is the weight for each bivariate distribution, fi, which is defined in equation

where  is the correlation between the |y| and pT variables, x is the mean value of variable
x and x is the width of variable x. The increased complexity of the model means that
it is no longer possible to use ROOT to perform the fit. Instead a package present in the
SciPy machine learning framework [13] was used. This uses an expectation maximization
routine to iteratively improve the models fit from an initial guess. The number of bivariate
distributions used in the mixture model is a free parameter. The use of five distributions was
found sufficient for the purpose of representing the density of the events. It should however
be possible to optimize the choice of the number of bivariate distributions. Over-fitting
is not necessarily a problem in this case as the density of events will still be described well,
however introducing too many parameters will result in the fit taking a very long time. Figure
4.5 shows two example fits using mixture models containing either one or five gaussian
distributions. The case with only one gaussian distribution is not a good fit of the sample,
whilst the second example shows a good fit can be achieved with five distributions. It
should be noted that the fit in the low density regions will not be very good, but the aim of
the weighting is to suppress the regions which already contain a high density of events, thus
those areas will have good determination of density.

gle Gaussian distribution and (b) used five Gaussian distributions in the mixture model. The
axis on the right-hand side shows the density of events. The points illustrate the distribution
of Monte Carlo events for a small fraction of the sample used to produce the fit.
Weighted Generation
In the filtering algorithm for this method the same requirement is made that there be at least
two jets with pT > 12 GeV. The weight is now derived by evaluating equation 4.2 for newly
generated events and comparing it to the value obtained at a control point. If the probability
density is lower than the control point density then the event weight used will be one. Again
the same rejection technique is used by comparing a random number to the inverse of the
weight.

Results
The good performance of the weighting can be seen in figure 4.6. The total number of events
is normalized to that of the previous weighted sample for the sake of comparison. There is
now a greater yield in the bins that were problematic. The complete set of parameters used
for event weighting can be found in appendix B.
4.5 Comparison of Weighting Samples
In figure 4.7 the yield for each of the fully simulated PYTHIA samples are compared. The
weighted samples can be seen to have a much larger fraction of their events produced in the
large |y| region. The two-dimensionally weighted samples also typically have the highest
number of events in all the samples, although the difference does fall at higher pT.

The utility of these weighted samples can be best seen in the improvement of the statis-

Chapter 5
NLO Dijet Production
In this chapter the POWHEG NLO Dijet generator [1, 2, 3] will be described including a
discussion of uncertainties related to the choice of PDF, renormalisation scale and factorisa-
tion scale. Generation issues encountered whilst producing the predictions and strategies to
mitigate their effect are described. Finally the parameters used to generate the predictions
are listed and a selection of predictions shown for inclusive distributions.
5.1 POWHEG
POWHEG-BOX provides a new framework to produce NLO events which subsequently
can be passed through any of the standard Monte Carlo generators, such as PYTHIA or
HERWIG. The dijet process [4] within POWHEG should provide NLO-accurate predictions
of dijet production. By passing the POWHEG events through the standard MC generators the
effects of parton shower, hadronisation and MPI are taken into account. This is significantly
easier than previous methods that were applied to NLOJet++ [5]. With NLOJet++ it had
been necessary to derive corrections for the soft physics effects by running Monte Carlo with
underlying event and hadronisation switched on and off.
A number of parameters were chosen when generating the events in POWHEG. These
include the PDF, scale, weighting and a number of other POWHEG specific parameters.
5.1.1 Parton Distribution Function Choice
Two PDF sets, MSTW2008NLO [6] and CT10 [7], were investigated for the production of
the hard scatter with POWHEG-BOX. These NLO PDF sets, produced by seperate collabo-
rations, use some of the most recent hadronic collider data and latest theoretical methods to
provide knowledge of the content of interacting hadrons. The CT10 PDF uses more recent
data sets including updated inclusive jet data from the Tevatron. In addition to changing the
PDF, the full eigenvector error sets for each PDF set were investigated.
The determination of the uncertainties due to PDF choice was carried out though the
technique known as PDF re-weighting. In this approach, the effect of using a different PDF
is established by applying a weight, w, to each event. The weight is defined as
f new(x1, q, f l1) f
new(x2, q, f l2)
f old(x1, q, f l1) f
old(x2, q, f l2)
(5.1)
where f is the parton distribution function evaluated for the given momentum fraction
x1,2, energy scale q of the interaction and parton flavour f l1,2. The new and old refer to
the PDF set used, the old being the default central PDF set used in the initial generation. Re-
weighting was necessary because the computational cost of generating POWHEG events for
all 53 PDF eigenvectors in the CT10 PDF set and 41 PDF eigenvectors in the MSTW2008
NLO PDF would have been too great.
For each PDF set, the asymmetric uncertainties in an observable F were then calculated
from the PDF eigenvectors through the use of the following formulas
(F)+ =
{max[F(S +
)  F(S 0), F(S k )  F(S 0), 0]}2, (5.2)
(F) =
{max[F(S 0)  F(S +k ), F(S 0)  F(S
), 0]}2, (5.3)
where S 0 and S
are the central and kth error eigenvector PDF sets respectively. This
is the defined way of doing this [6].
Inclusive Jet Observables
In figure 5.1 the CT10 PDF uncertainties for two doubly differential inclusive distributions
are shown. CT10 PDF was the default choice for the POWHEG prediction in another ATLAS
publication in progress. The uncertainty grows substantially for events containing jets with
high transverse momentum and pairs of jets with high dijet mass. The uncertainty is highly
asymmetric, where the positive uncertainty is over 50% in the highest pT bins. The dom-
inance of the gluon PDF in the high dijet mass region and high y is a source for the large
uncertainty in figure 5.1.

the results of equations 5.2-5.3.
Veto Jet Observables
The work carried out for the veto analysis happened before CT10 became the default PDF
choice for generating POWHEG events, MSTW 2008 NLO was used instead. The size of
the PDF uncertainty for the dijet with central veto jet measurement was found to be small.
In figure 5.2 the typical uncertainty for the MSTW 2008 NLO PDF set is far below 1%. The
size of the uncertainty does increase with |y| but is still considered to be negligible relative
to other theoretical uncertainties and could possibly be explained by the poor statistics in
these regions. The small uncertainty is not limited to the MSTW 2008 NLO PDF set, both
CTEQ66 and NNPDF have also been observed to produce consistent predictions with the
same low uncertainty originating from the PDF error sets.

5.1.2 Scale Choice
In POWHEG-BOX the dijet process by default uses the pT of the underlying leading order
process for the renormalisation and factorisation scales on an event by event basis. It has
been suggested that this default choice of scale  = pT can lead to instability in a purely
NLO prediction. An alternative renormalisation and factorisation scale choice suggested in
[8] was made using
m j j
2cosh(0.7y)
, (5.4)
where m j j is the mass and y
 is the separation in rapidity of the two partons that make
up the underlying leading order system. This choice of scale can be considered to be an
interpolation between the dijet mass and the pT as scale choices. In addition to an alternative
scale choice, scales were varied to estimate the effect of missing higher orders in the per-
turbative expansion. Scale variation required additional events where the factorization and
renormalisation scales had an additional multiplicative factor applied. The renormalisation
and factorization scales (R, F) were varied by factors of (2, 2), (0.5, 0.5), (2, 1), (1, 2),
(0.5, 1.0) and (1.0, 0.5). The envelope of these variations was taken to be the total scale
uncertainty.
Inclusive Jet Observables
A comparison of the uncertainties from scale variation are shown for the single jet cross
sections and dijet mass cross sections in figure 5.3. The PDF uncertainties are shown as well
for reference. For both choices of scale there was a similar result for the inclusive jet cross
section, where there was an  10% uncertainty for the entire pT range in each |y| region. The
size of the uncertainty for scale variation and PDF are of similar magnitude at low pT. At
high pT the PDF uncertainties have become the dominant source of uncertainty.
For the dijet mass distributions in regions of low y both scale choices produced sim-
ilar uncertainties, however as the separation of the leading jets increased the uncertainties
diverged. In the highest separation region considered here, 2.5 < y < 3.0, the scale uncer-
tainty in the negative direction was greater than 50% for the pT scale choice. The new scale
choice did not see the same growth of uncertainty with increasing y, indicating it may be
the preferable choice especially if the uncertainty for the default scale choice continues to
grow and possibly becomes unstable.

PDF uncertainties are indicated by the yellow lines when the scale uncertainties are larger.
Veto Jet Observables
The uncertainty from varying the scale by a factor of 2 for the veto observables was found
to be small, with the exception of the largest |y| bin where low event numbers make
the uncertainty dominated by the statistics. In figure 5.4 the uncertainty from scale varia-
tion was found to be much smaller than the difference between POWHEG+PYTHIA and
POWHEG+HERWIG samples. The small size of the uncertainties from scale variation
seemed to indicate that there was only a small effect from missing higher order terms in
the perturbative expansion, however [9] found that a large theoretical uncertainty can be ob-
tained through varying the arguments in the resummation of their calculation. Given that
fact, it is the difference between the PYTHIA and HERWIG showers that demonstrate the
missing higher order terms. It was therefore decided not to display uncertainties from scale
variation on any of the subsequent predictions for the veto observables and instead rely upon
PYTHIA and HERWIG differences, this strategy was adopted for the ATLAS publication
[10].

tion.
Figure 5.5 shows that the effect of the different scale choice was less than a few percent
for a selection of veto observables; with more statistics this effect may reduce further. This
does not rule out the possibility that higher |y| could be affected, especially if the fixed NLO
prediction does actually produce a negative cross section.

PYTHIA choice. Included is a sample of POWHEG events generated and showered with the
alternative scale choice in equation 5.4
f (pT ) =
T supp
, (5.5)
where pT is the underlying leading order transverse momentum and pT supp is a user
defined parameter which controls the level of weighting. Events which have pT  pT supp
are kept with a weight 1, whilst for pT supp  pT events will receive a very large weight.
Samples have been generated where the outermost exponent has been changed from 3 to 2,
reducing the suppression of the very lowest transverse momentum events. This was found to
be useful for handling problems discussed in the next section.
The default pT suppression is capable of producing events across a wide range of pT val-
ues, however it suffers from the same deficiencies as the standard PYTHIA samples, where
large |y| events are unlikely to occur. It is therefore necessary to generate very large samples
of events, in the hundreds of millions, to cover the regions which this thesis investigates.
5.1.4 POWHEG Generation Issues
A problem observed when generating weighted POWHEG events was that on a small number
of occasions the highest pT partons generated were much lower in pT than the hardest jets of
the event. For the events produced in POWHEG to be accepted by a showering MC generator
they must be put into the correct format, where the hardest radiation parton must be assigned
a parent. Consider the possible angles which the emitted parton can be assigned in figure
5.6 depending on the choice of parent. The probability to be assigned the larger 1 angle
is suppressed but not zero. The choice of the larger angle results in a larger energy scale
available for the subsequent parton shower. The increased scale means that much higher pT
objects can be generated in the showering MC generator.
Figure 5.6: Assignment of the hardest radiation generated by POWHEG.
These events are not unphysical but they do pose a problem through the size of their
weights. They have low parton pT and so through equation 5.5 they will have a large event
weight. These large weighted events with high pT generated by the showering MC enter
regions of observables where the typical weight is much lower. An example of a large fluc-
tuation caused by one of these events can be seen in figure 5.7. Although generating more
events would reduce the size of these fluctuations, the number needed is too large for the
computing resources available. The first method to mitigate the effect of the events was to
change the exponent in equation 5.5 from three to two. This reduced the size of weights in
the very lowest pT events. The second method involves the filtering of events using parton
level quantities. Specifically, events were rejected if they satisfied
pT jet > CpT parton, (5.6)
where C is a free parameter, pT jet is the highest transverse momentum jet and pT parton
is the highest transverse momentum parton. These events are a genuine component of the
cross section and so their removal can cause a bias. Figure 5.7 shows an example of how
the pathological events exhibit themselves in the veto observables. A large fluctuation was
present in the gap fraction for the events without the cut applied. For each of the curves with
the cut applied with different choices of threshold, the large fluctuation was removed without
causing significant bias. The levels of bias were evaluated by dividing a generated sample
into a set of subsamples and calculating the average value in each bin with and without the
cut applied.

Here are the list of parameters considered for the generation of POWHEG dijet events.

will generate. It is sufficiently low that there is no bias
present for jets with pT > 20GeV.

The suppression factor as defined in equation 5.5.
Showering Monte Carlo Settings
A number of different tunes were used to shower the POWHEG events for this analysis. For
PYTHIA the tunes which have been considered are AMBT1, AUET2b and Perugia 2011.
For HERWIG+JIMMY AUET1 and AUET2 have been considered.
The authors of POWHEG found that it was necessary to limit the MPI scale to that of
the jets in the primary interaction [4]. This is achieved in PYTHIA by setting the parameter
MSTP(86)=1. The same requirement is applied for HERWIG+JIMMY, where events with
the additional scatters with a pT greater than the hard scatter pT are rejected.
5.3 Inclusive Jet Predictions
In figure 5.8 the range of predictions for POWHEG are shown for the inclusive jet cross
section. The ratio plots show the size of the systematic with both the scale variations and
the CT10 PDF errors added in quadrature. Both POWHEG PYTHIA distributions produce
predictions within 10% of each other whilst the POWHEG HERWIG prediction starts to rel-
atively increase as the rapidity of the jets becomes more forward. Additionally the POWHEG
HERWIG predictions are more strongly peaked at low pT in most regions of rapidity. This
good agreement between POWHEG+PYTHIA tunes is also seen in the dijet mass spectrum
shown in figure 5.9. The differences observed between the HERWIG and PYTHIA showered
events could arise from the non-peturbative elements of the predictions, and therefore impose
a large additional systematic uncertainty on the POWHEG predictions above and beyond the
scale and PDF uncertainties. This is not unprecedented as in predictions made by NLOJet++
[5] there are also significant uncertainties arising from non-peturbative physics models. This
interpretation of the differences observed is not quite complete as there are also significant
differences observed in regions where the peturbative physics should be dominant, in this
case it would appear that peturbative showers within PYTHIA and HERWIG are playing a
more significant role than expected.
The agreement of POWHEG predictions of inclusive jet distributions with data has been
seen to be good in [11]. However the complete range of distributions is still yet to be pub-
lished for the 2010 ATLAS data, including the data for the systems with the greatest rapidity
separations where the most significant differences between HERWIG and PYTHIA showered
events occurred. A future publication by the ATLAS collaboration will show the POWHEG
distributions described in this chapter compared to the improved measurement.

Chapter 6
Dijet Veto Measurement
In this chapter the remaining elements of the dijet with a central jet veto analysis are dis-
cussed. An outline is given to show how events were selected from data in the 2010 period
and what quality requirements were made.
With great detail this chapter also examines the determination of the data corrections that
were critical for this analysis. The correction that has been derived translated the measured
observable quantities from the detector level to the hadron level definition. The utility of the
PYTHIA Monte Carlo samples in determining the corrections was examined by comparing
the full detector simulation events with uncorrected data, and were found to be in sufficient
agreement. The requirements for the use of the detector correction technique were then
shown to be satisfied through the investigation of event migration in bins of the relevant
kinematic variables. A set of conservative systematic uncertainties were determined through
the consideration of both theoretical modeling uncertainties and measurement limitations of
the ATLAS detector. The complete set of corrections are presented for the main analysis
selection criteria.
The remaining important sources of systematic uncertainty for the measurement are iden-
tified. The chapter ends with a summary of the results which were published in the ATLAS
dijet with a central jet veto paper [1].
6.1 Analysis Selection
The default kinematic selection as defined in chapter 2 is used for selections A, B and C. In
all cases only anti-kt jets with a radius parameter R = 0.6 were considered.
6.1.1 Data Selection
Good Data Selection
This analysis was dependent upon many detector subsystems of ATLAS and the operation of
accelerator. It was therefore necessary that a rigorous selection was applied to the complete
data recorded in the 2010 period. ATLAS records information pertaining to the quality of
the data on a luminosity block basis, where a luminosity block is a period of data taking of
 1minute. The data quality stored in each luminosity block is derived from comparisons
to benchmark distributions for each sub-detector and when agreement was seen, the sub-
detector was considered to be operating in a good or green state. In 2010 all sub-detectors
were flagged as green for over 90% of the data [2]. In this analysis the calorimeters, track-
ing system, magnet system and triggers were all required to be operating at the green level.
In addition to the good operation of the ATLAS detector, further requirements were placed
on the accelerator operation. The LHC was required to be operating in stable beam condi-
tions and colliding protons at
s = 7TeV. After making all these quality requirements the
amount of integrated luminosity fell from the 45 pb
delivered to the ATLAS detector [3] to
35.6 pb
available for the analysis.
Jet Quality
Data quality requirements were also made for the jet objects by requiring that there were
no loose-bad or ugly jets with pT > 20GeV in each event [4]. The jets defined as bad
have been found to be fake or not associated with in-time energy deposition; they may for
example originate from cosmic rays or noise in the calorimeter. Ugly jets were associated
with in-time energy deposition but have occurred in a region where the measurement was
not considered reliable, such as in transition regions between detectors. The jet requirements
have been observed to have a high efficiency in rejecting bad events with only a sub-percent
effect on all the observables [1]. These same jet quality requirements were tested in the
Monte Carlo samples which had the full detector simulation applied, and were seen to have
only a small effect. Figure 6.1 shows in a selection of observables that the effect of the
jet quality requirement was typically less than 1%, comparable to the effect observed in
data. Although these requirements were not applied to the final MC results because of an
incomplete modeling of all the jet quality variables in the simulation at the time.

A criteria.
Trigger Requirements
The dijet events which were investigated in this analysis had pT in the range 50GeV to
500GeV. The production rate for the low pT events was very high requiring ATLAS to reject
a large fraction of these events using highly prescaled jet triggers. ATLAS used a series of
single jet triggers with different energy thresholds to collect jet events, where lower energy
thresholds required large prescales to cope with the high event rate by the end of 2010. The
trigger strategy that was used in this analysis was the division method [5], where separate
trigger items are used to fill different regions of phase space. In this case the pT distribution
was divided into seven regions in which different single jet triggers were used to select events.
These regions were selected by finding the minimal jet pT where the jet trigger is more than
99% efficient. The choice of threshold for each division is listed in table 6.1. More details
about the trigger strategy can be found in chapter 7.

Table 6.1 shows the recorded luminosities for each pT division for the 2010 running. The
effect of trigger prescales, deadtime and data quality is taken into account in figure 6.2, where
the large trigger prescales are apparent at low pT, reducing the yield of events substantially.
Vertex Selection
Events are only kept if they have exactly one good vertex. The definition of a good vertex
was one that had Ntracks > 4 associated with it, where each track had pT track > 100MeV. This
requirement was made to remove the effect of in-time pile up and to allow jet reconstruction
access to the position of the interaction point as part of the standard jet energy correction in
ATLAS. In figure 6.2 the effect of this vertex requirement was quite clearly seen to reduce
the sample size by a significant fraction. In the low pT region the fraction of data lost to the
cut was approximately 35% and rose to 70% in the highest pT regions.

Example event
An example of an event that satisfied the event selection criteria is shown in figure 6.3 using
the Atlantis event display system [6]. The leading jets of this event have pT = 510GeV
and a separation of over four units of rapidity. The presence of an additional jet between the
leading jets with pT = 31GeV caused the event to fail the veto requirement imposed for both
selection A and B, however it did pass selection C.
6.2 Data Correction
Using the correction outlined in the following sections of this chapter the effects of the de-
tector were removed from the data. By correcting the data to the hadron level it may be

compared to many of the standard Monte Carlo dijet predictions and indeed analytical calcu-
lations without the need for the full detector simulation. It additionally allows comparisons
to measurements made by other experiments. The correction was applied by a simple mul-
tiplicative factor, the correction factor, on a bin-by-bin basis for each observable considered
and was derived by the comparison of Monte Carlo samples at the truth level and after de-
tector simulation. The correction factor for the i-th bin is defined as
Otruth
Osimul
, (6.1)
where O represents the observable to be corrected, Osimul
is the observable after full
ATLAS detector simulation and reconstruction and Otruth
is the observable derived from the
truth record. When the reconstructed data is multiplied by this correction factor it should
ideally produce an estimate of the real life physics distributions free from detector effects.
The requirements for the use of bin-by-bin corrections such as these are that the measurement
values must be very close to the true values and that the bin size should be much larger than
the resolution to minimize the migrations between bins [7].
Monte Carlo Samples
Any correction technique can suffer from large statistical fluctuations if the MC samples
have poor statistics. The result of the poor statistics is that the systematic uncertainty for
the data correction would be larger, significantly reducing the precision of the measurement.
This problem has been reduced through the generation of large |y| weighted PYTHIA event
samples, which was discussed in chapter 4. In the derivation of both the correction factors
and their systematic uncertainties, the unweighted and |y| weighted PYTHIA 6 AMBT1
dijet event samples were combined. The combination was performed using
f (x) =
w1(x) f1(x) + w2(x) f2(x)
w1(x) + w2(x)
, (6.2)
where fi(x) is the observable value in the x-th bin for the i-th PYTHIA sample and wi(x)
is the number of events in the x-th bin for the i-th PYTHIA sample. The independently
generated samples combined in this case are the unweighted PYTHIA 6 and |y| weighted
PYTHIA 6 samples. By combining these samples the number of events available in the
large |y| region was greatly increased without loss of precision in the small |y| region.
Comparisons of the event yields in each sample can be seen in chapter 4 in figure 4.7. The
pT and |y| weighted samples had not yet been made when this work was carried out.
6.3 Uncorrected Data Comparisons
The utility of a simulated event sample to derive the correction factors is strongly dependent
on the agreement between the MC model and data. A simple test of this involved the com-
parison of the MC events after simulation with the reconstructed data distributions. As stated
earlier in the chapter the events were required to be taken during adequate detector opera-
tion with the quality of jets classified as green. The control plots that demonstrate data/MC
applicability are

where Nevent is the total number of events in each selection region, |y| is the interval
between the two highest pT jets, pT veto is the transverse momentum of the highest pT jet
inside the interval region, Nveto is the number of jets meeting the veto requirement between
the interval jets and lastly  is the difference in azimuthal angle between the interval defin-
ing jets. The following figures 6.4-6.7 show comparisons of uncorrected 2010 data with the
combination of unweighted and |y| weighted PYTHIA 6 AMBT1 dijet events after detector
simulation. The errors shown are the statistical uncertainties only. The theoretical uncertain-
ties for PYTHIA would be expected to be relatively large. There was reasonable agreement
seen in the shape for each of the distributions and in each of the subdivisions of the kinematic
regions shown. This initially gave confidence that the corrections for detector effects can be
calculated for the observables in this analysis using these MC samples.

6.4 Migrations
The bin-by-bin correction technique assumes that there is a low level of migration of events
between bins. It was therefore important to confirm that the level of migration seen between
the Truth MC and simulated MC was sufficiently small for the method to be applicable [8].
In figure 6.8 the |y| migration matrices for both Selection A and B, where pT > 50GeV,
show a strong correlation between the truth |y| and the detector simulated value. The small
fraction of events which migrate over a large range of rapidity separation values was caused
by misidentifying the interval defining jets. A more quantitative picture of the migration of
events is given by the purity variable defined in the next section.

quirements for the dijet system are shown (a) The highest pT jets (b) The most forward and

Purity
The purity of a bin is defined by
truth+simu
, (6.4)
where N i
truth+simu
is the number of events where both the truth and simulated quantities of
an event are in bin i, and N i
is the total number of MC simulated events that lie in bin i.
The value of the purity will be high if the migration of events between bins is rare and the
efficiency is high.

Figure 6.9: Selection A purities for the variable |y| where the MC events used are PYTHIA
6 with the AMBT1 tune. The regions of the graphs with a hatched background are not needed
to unfold data because these regions lack events in the data.
The figures 6.9-6.11 show the selection A purities in bins of |y|, pT and Q0 in all regions
of phase space considered. These variables show a purity greater than 50% in all the bins
that were needed for data correction in subsequent chapters. It should be noted that the bins
in each figure are essentially two dimensional, so the purity of > 50% is actually reasonably
high. The structure visible in figure 6.10 is due to the way the bin size varies with pT. An
increase in the bin size leads to an increase in purity. The purity plots for the other selections
can be found in appendix section C.1, with similar results compared to selection A.
All the distributions show that the weighted and unweighted PYTHIA 6 samples were in
agreement and importantly the |y| weighted sample provided lower statistical uncertainties
in the large |y| region.

6.5 Systematic Uncertainty Determination
There were a number of possible sources of systematic uncertainty for the data corrections
derived in this chapter. These include the uncertainty in the physics modeling, increased
jet energy resolutions, uncertainty of the jet efficiency and the uncertainty in the position of
the primary vertex. The final total systematic uncertainties for the detector corrections are a
quadratic sum of these effects as well as a statistical uncertainty on the MC samples.
6.5.1 Physics Modeling Uncertainty
Modifications applied
The sensitivity of the detector corrections to variations in the physics modeling in MC was
tested. The distributions considered were the same as those which were being corrected, so
the distributions of pT, |y| and Q0. The modification of the distributions was achieved by
re-weighting the events such that the shape varied within constraints derived using the JES
uncertainty. This represents the maximal variation allowed by data as the data and MC agree
within the JES uncertainty. The functions used to reweight the events and alter the shape
were: -
|y| Shape Event weight multiplied by two different functional forms
|y| + 1
(10  |y|) + 1
where   [0.05, 0.05].
pT Shape Event weight multiplied by two different functional forms
pT + 1
(500GeV  pT) + 1
where   [103, 103].
Q0 Shape Event weight multiplied by two different functional forms
Q0 + 1
(150GeV  Q0) + 1
where   [3  103, 3  103].
The JES uncertainties used to determine the range of modification applied were from an older
more conservative estimation of the JES uncertainty. This has resulted in the modifications
applied here to also be conservative.
Correction Uncertainties
The uncertainty in the correction factor originating from the modification of the physics
modeling is defined to be the fractional difference with respect to the default correction
factor
(F) =
Fnew  Fdefault
Fdefault
. (6.5)
where F is the observable being considered. The correction factor uncertainties after the
modifications made to each of the truth distributions are shown in figure 6.12-6.16 for se-
lection A. The equivalent results for the selections B and C can be found in appendix C, it
should be noted selection C can be seen to have significantly higher uncertainties than the
other two selections.
In selection A the largest contribution to the uncertainty from the physics modeling con-
siderations originated from variation in the third jet pT spectrum. This was seen to be usu-
ally less than 1% in the gap fraction distributions with small increases with larger |y|. The
physics modifications were more important for the average number of jets above the veto
threshold, where at low |y| the uncertainty is greater than 5%. The other physics modelling
sources were almost negligble in all cases. For selection B the uncertainties are of similar
magnitude whilst for selection C the uncertainties are large, reaching 10% for the average
number of veto jets.

6.5.2 Detector Modeling Uncertainty
Jet Energy Resolution
The jet energy resolution (JER) has been measured by ATLAS [9] and there is a relative
uncertainty that varies with the pT and  of the jet, some example values are shown in table
pT [GeV] (0 <  < 0.9) (0.9 <  < 2) (2 <  < 4.4)
15 0.125 0.25 0.35
20 0.10 0.20 0.28
30 0.05 0.10 0.14
Table 6.2: The jet resolution uncertainties for a number of jet energies for different  regions
of the detector. Jets with pT > 30GeV have the same resolutions as the pT = 30GeV case.
The effect of a larger resolution was estimated by smearing the pT of each jet by an
additional amount equal to the uncertainty in the resolution for that particular jet. Given that
it was not possible to use this same method to improve the resolution, the uncertainty was
symmetrised around the nominal correction value, for example (F)up = (F)down.
Jet Efficiency Loss
There is an uncertainty in the measurement made for the jet reconstruction efficiency of
 2% for jets with pT < 30 GeV [9]. The jet efficiency in the low pT region was artificially
decreased by removing at random 2% of the jets which have pT < 30 GeV. The effect of
removing these jets caused a rise in the MC simulated gap fraction. This resulted in the
correction factor for the gap fraction to be lower than the nominal value. As in the case for
the jet energy resolution the uncertainty was symmetrised, (F)up = (F)down.
Vertex Position
Over the period in which the data was collected in 2010 the width of the vertex z position
distribution varied significantly between runs. This variation is not simulated in the MC
samples. The effect this would have on the correction factor was estimated by re-weighting
events to vary the width of the vertex z position. The range of weights applied to events
based upon the vertex z position are listed below
Vertex Z Shape Event weight multiplied by four different functional forms
1.0 + |z|/200.0
1.0  |z|/200.0
1.0 + (|z|/200.0)2
1.0  (|z|/200.0)2
where |z| is the absolute position of the vertex in the z direction. The maximum |z|
allowed is 200mm.
Correction Uncertainties
The uncertainty in the correction factors are shown in figures 6.17-6.21 for the other sources.
Each of the sources have been seen to produce similar uncertainties in the correction factor,
usually . 2% across the whole phase space and often consistent with zero. The uncertainties
in the average number of veto jets are yet again the largest of all the observables. There was
also often seen large fluctuations present from the vertex Z position re-weighting. This was
understandable when you consider the small number of events produced with large values of
|z|. There was similar behavior seen for the other selections as before, and they are displayed
in appendix C.

6.6 Final Correction Factors
The correction factors are shown in figures 6.22-6.25 where the statistical errors are dis-
played as error bars and the total systematic uncertainty is represented by the blue band.
The total systematic uncertainty was evaluated by summing in quadrature the uncertainties
obtained from truth modification, JER smearing, jet efficiency loss and the vertex z position
re-weighting. All the data correction factors were found to be close to one for the gap frac-
tion distributions and close to 0.9 for the average number of veto jet distributions, giving
confidence in the use of the bin-by-bin method. Even with the additional event samples the
statistical uncertainties are still a major component of the uncertainty in the data corrections.
The correction factors for the other selections can be found in appendix C. Selection C has
overall the highest uncertainties.

6.7 Additional Systematic Uncertainties on Measurement
The systematic uncertainty for the data corrections has already been shown in section 6.2.
Additional sources for uncertainty in the measurements were considered. These included
the jet energy scale, the trigger and pile-up. These were determined by other members of
ATLAS and will be described briefly in the following sections.
6.7.1 Jet Energy Scale Uncertainty
One of the most significant uncertainties in any measurement that uses jets arises from the
uncertainty in the jet energy scale (JES). The effect on this analysis was estimated by varying
the JES of each jet within the allowed limits of the JES uncertainty. The JES uncertainty was
determined with both a correlated JES shift for jets in all  regions of the detector and an
uncorrelated JES shift for jets in different  regions. It was always found to be the case that
the correlated JES uncertainty was much larger than the uncorrelated JES uncertainty. The
final JES uncertainty was therefore taken to be just the correlated case. In figure 6.26, a
summing of the systematic uncertainties for the JES and data corrections, labeled unfolding,
are shown for a selection of regions. The uncertainty for the data corrections was found to
be typically lower than the JES uncertainty in most region of |y| and pT considered.

6.7.2 Trigger and Pile-up Uncertainty
The trigger strategy was tested for possible bias by checking that the efficiency for finding
events with an empty interval was the same as the efficiency for a filled interval. The bias
present was found to contribute < 0.5% to the systematic uncertainty [1]. The effectiveness
of the vertex requirement in removing in-time pile-up was tested by considering how the
measured observables varied as a function of the mean number of interaction per bunch
crossing, which increased with time over the period of 2010 data taking. The deviation was
also seen to be < 0.5% in the measured observables as the number of interactions increased.
6.8 Results
In this section the results from the dijet with a central jet veto paper [1] are discussed, where
the data has been corrected and compared to a number of theoretical predictions. These
predictions, excepting HEJ, have been discussed in previous chapters.
6.8.1 Comparison to Monte Carlo Samples
Comparisons of the fully corrected data were made to a number of leading order Monte
Carlo generators. In figure 6.27 a selection of the regions investigated is shown. The spread
of the leading order MC generators was large compared to the experimental uncertainty in
the measurement. The ALPGEN+HERWIG/JIMMY predictions show the greatest deviation
from the data, where the predicted jet content is too high leading to a gap fraction which is
significantly lower than the data.
The spread of the leading order MC generator predictions reflects a large uncertainty in
the theory. Hence while the PYTHIA predictions seem to match very well there is no reason
to believe one MC model over another one.

6.8.2 Comparison of data to POWHEG and HEJ
The higher energies that the LHC provides have altered the behavior of the typical jet events.
There is now more likely to be a larger number of high pT jets in each event. High energy
jets (HEJ) [10][11] is a new framework that provides an all-order description of processes
containing more than two partons that have a large rapidity separations, inspired from BFKL
formalism. There was an expectation that in the limit of pT << m j j that the HEJ prediction
should perform well. The samples that were generated and compared to the measurement
did not contain a parton shower, but the effect from soft corrections was estimated to be
small. As in the case for the other predictions, the anti-kt jet algorithm was applied with a
radius parameter of R = 0.6, clustering the partons to produce infrared and collinear-safe
predictions.
Results
In this section the results are presented for the fully corrected data collected in 2010. The
data has been compared to HEJ, POWHEG+PYTHIA and POWHEG+HERWIG/JIMMY.
The POWHEG+PYTHIA shown here uses the MSTW 2008 NLO PDF for the genera-
tion of the hardest scatter and the tune used for PYTHIA showering was AMBT1. The
POWHEG+HERWIG/JIMMY shown also uses MSTW 2008 NLO PDF for the hardest scat-
ter and the AUET1 tune in HERWIG/JIMMY. The HEJ curves contain both a scale and PDF
uncertainty, whilst the POWHEG curves show only the statistical uncertainty. The system-
atic error on the data values contains the uncertainty from the data correction and the JES
uncertainty. Figures 6.28 and 6.29 show the gap fractions vs |y| and pT. Figure 6.30 shows
the average number of jets above the veto threshold inside the gap region vs pT. For each
figure the left-hand side plot shows the observable with each curve offset in the y-axis direc-
tion, as indicated by the value in the legend. The right-hand side plot shows the ratio of each
theoretical prediction to data.
The POWHEG+PYTHIA predictions for the gap fraction as a function of |y| for selec-
tion A, figure 6.28, were generally seen to be in good agreement although a trend appeared at
large |y| for the prediction to lie below the data. POWHEG+HERWIG/JIMMY has signif-
icantly greater disagreement for |y| > 3. The Multi-Regge Kinematic (MRK) limit which
HEJ uses is only applicable for the case when the outgoing partons are well separated in
rapidity and have similar transverse momenta. Events with high pT combined with a low
veto threshold do not satisfy the MRK requirement. This is consistent with HEJ performing
best when 70 < pT < 90GeV with a growing disagreement for higher pT.
The mean number of jets observed in the gap as a function of pT, figure 6.30, shows
similar behavior. As before POWHEG+PYTHIA provides the best description of the data.
POWHEG+HERWIG has more than 20% extra jets above the veto threshold in the gap
region over large ranges of pT, these differences are seen to worsen at low pT. HEJ predicts
too few jets above the threshold over almost all of the pT range considered. An explanation
for this may be related to the lack of parton shower in the HEJ predictions, and so cannot
properly reproduce the multiplicity of jets measured.
The comparisons to measurements for the other selections B and C are available in the
dijet with a central jet veto paper [1] and in additional material [12]. In selection B it was

seen that the HEJ predictions are more consistent with the data for the gap fraction vs y,
however there were still seen to be major discrepancies with the average number of veto jets
in the gap. In selection C the MC shower dependence was seen to become much smaller,
where the POWHEG+PYTHIA and POWHEG+HERWIG predictions produced identical
results and were both consistent with the data.
6.8.3 Public Code
A public version of code was written that can produce the dijet with a central jet veto dis-
tributions. It is available in the Rivet framework [13], which is a toolkit for the validation
of Monte Carlo event generators. Running the analysis code ATLAS 2011 S9126244 will
produce all the predictions for the currently publicly available ATLAS results [1], which can
all be obtained from either Rivet or the HEPDATA archive (http://hepdata.cedar.ac.

Chapter 7
Measurement Extension
In this chapter the use of the anti-kt jet algorithm with radius parameter R = 0.4 was ex-
plored for the dijet with a central jet veto measurement. The use of an alternative jet radius
allowed a test of the sensitivity of the veto observables to multiple interactions, underly-
ing event and peturbative radiation. The contributions to the jet energy from each of these
sources should vary as a function of the jet radius. This required work to evaluate the trig-
ger strategy and the jet energy scale uncertainty for the new radius. In addition the vertex
requirement was loosened and the impact of additional pile-up vertices was tested. Finally
the new measurements were compared to the latest POWHEG predictions.
7.1 Analysis Changes
A number of changes with regards to chapter 6 have been made in the consideration of these
extensions to the dijet with a central jet veto analyses. The minimum veto scale was been
raised from 20GeV to 30GeV, reducing the effect which pile-up could have on the veto
observable and in general reducing the total systematic uncertainty as well. The increased
veto scale did come at the cost of reduced sensitivity to the large angle soft gluon radiation,
although this is offset by the greater access to high pT events. As the veto scale has been
increased so were the minimum pT values for the leading jets, both pT 1 > 30GeV and pT 2 >
30GeV were required for the first two jets. The only selection considered in this chapter is
type A, where the leading two jets define the interval region. In addition to the previously
used PYTHIA samples a new sample of Monte Carlo events became available. This two
dimensionally weighted sample, pT and |y|, yielded a higher fraction of large interval events
The new sample of events results in an improved determination of the unfolding and jet
energy scale systematic uncertainties, which had been previously statistically limited in the
high |y| region.
7.1.1 Distribution Selection
To alleviate some issues seen in chapter 6 with regards to the purity distributions, where
purity levels reached a nadir of 60%, a manual re-optimisation of the binning was made. The
bin edges for the |y| variable were changed to [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
and the bin edges for the pT variable were changed to [60.0, 80.0, 110.0, 145.0, 185.0, 250.0,
320.0, 400.0, 550.0] GeV. An increased bin size was observed to result in increased purity
values. In figures 7.1 and 7.2 the purity is shown to be approximately 80% and flat as a
function of pT. The increase in the purity gave an improved confidence in the data correction
procedure. Larger bins not only improved the purity observed but also increased the number
of events in each bin reducing the statistical uncertainty. The downside of an increased bin
size was that observable features were limited to a larger size. The figures also show that
there is no significant change in purity when anti-kt R = 0.4 jets are considered.
7.2 Trigger
In chapter 6 the choice of radius used for the anti-kt jet algorithm was restricted to R = 0.6.
As part of the work to understand the veto measurement in the presence of pile up another
radius, R = 0.4, is now also considered. The triggering procedure used to make the previous
measurement using the original jet radius needed to be evaluated for R = 0.4. Figure 7.3

shows the trigger efficiency, the fraction of events as a function of pT passing the three
lowest threshold jet triggers given that the event has passed the L1 MBTS 1 trigger. The
L1 MBTS 1 trigger used requires that there be at least one hit in the minimum bias trigger
scintillator, its efficiency as shown in [1] is high even for very low multiplicity events, thus
allowing the inference of the absolute trigger efficiency. Data recorded in an early period of
running is necessary because the luminosity conditions were relatively low, which allowed
the use of the L1 MBTS 1 trigger with a low prescale value. It is observed when the events
have pT > 60.0GeV the three jet triggers considered L1 J5, L1 J10 and L1 J15 are all above
99% efficiency. The turn-on points for anti-kt R = 0.4 and anti-kt R = 0.6 jets are
consistent.

There is a relatively small amount of data available in the Minbias stream with high pT
jets and insufficient events to obtain the trigger efficiency curves for the higher threshold jet
triggers. A solution is to use the technique commonly referred to as bootstrapping. This
is where a jet trigger is used as a reference trigger to evaluate a higher threshold triggers
efficiency, assuming that the absolute trigger efficiency is available for the new reference
trigger. This allows the use of a larger sample of events originating from the jet stream in the
evaluation of the jet trigger efficiency for trigger thresholds above L1 J15. In figure 7.4 the
plateau regions for the other thresholds can be observed, where again there can be seen to be
a great deal of similarity between the two choices of jet radius.

Standard jet good run list requirements. No ugly or loose bad jets with pT > 20GeV. The
vertex requirement of one good vertex is required
Given that the behavior of the triggers are observed to be the same as in the anti-kt R =
0.6 jet case, the trigger division strategy for anti-kt R = 0.4 can use the same triggers
and pT divisions for event selection. The choice of trigger divisions are then taken to be the
same as those listed in table 6.1. The size of bias for the new radius was also observed to be
negligible as in the anti-kt R = 0.6 case.
7.3 Vertex Cut Loosening
Figure 7.5 shows that the average number of vertices in 2010 data rises with pT. This is
because the triggers in which low pT events are collected had larger prescales applied as
the luminosity increased, such that a larger fraction of events are recorded during the early
running with low pile-up conditions. There is also notably very little dependence on the |y|
between the leading jets or the choice of jet algorithm radius.
The minimal effect of the pile-up present in 2010 data can be easily observed by compar-
ing the gap fraction and average veto jet number observables with and without the Nvertex = 1
criterion applied. In figure 7.6 the distributions are seen to be consistent within the statistical
uncertainties. Some of the largest deviations occur when there has been a large fluctuation in

the Nvertex = 1 distribution; the additional statistics available after loosening this requirement
can be clearly seen in the reduction of the statistical uncertainties. The other observables and
anti-kt R = 0.6 jets show similar levels of agreement.
7.4 Jet Energy Scale
One of the largest sources of systematic uncertainty for the measurement of dijets with a
central jet veto was the jet energy scale. The jet energy scale uncertainty was evaluated
using the simulated Monte Carlo event samples, with the addition of the pT-|y| weighted
PYTHIA sample. As was performed in chapter 6 the uncertainty for the veto observables
was evaluated by considering a shift in energy up and down of each jet across the entire
detector equal to the jet energy scale uncertainty.
7.4.1 JES Systematic Uncertainty
Figures 7.7, 7.8, 7.9 and 7.10 show the effect that pile-up inclusion has on the relative jet
energy scale uncertainty for each of the veto observables. A feature typical of these plots
is that the uncertainty derived for anti-kt R = 0.4 jets is almost universally smaller than
for anti-kt R = 0.6 jets. Whilst there is a difference in the magnitude of the jet energy
scale uncertainty, the dependence as a function of |y| and pT is the same for both radii
considered. Considering firstly the case of events with only one vertex the behaviour is seen
to be consistent between the two jet radii. In figure 7.7 the jet energy scale uncertainty for
the gap fraction grows with |y|, approaching 2.5% uncertainty at the largest separations
considered and is true for each pT region. On the other hand the gap fraction vs pT in figure
7.8 has a constant behavior. The average number of jets above the veto scale, in figures 7.9
and 7.10, have a systematic uncertainty that is flat as a function of both |y| and pT.
Given that we have removed the constraint on vertex number previously imposed, the jet
energy scale uncertainty needed to be determined again. The previous method used Monte

Carlo events to infer the systematic uncertainty. These events however do not have a vertex
number distribution consistent with the data, as they had not been simulated with pile-up
conditions. The samples can still be used but there was a need to evaluate the average number
of vertices in each bin for each observable from data. Combining this with the knowledge of
the jet energy scale uncertainty for each vertex number fromMonte Carlo, an extrapolation of
the jet energy scale uncertainty for the true number of vertices in each bin can be made. The
inclusion of events with more than one vertex was seen to have minimal effect on the final jet
energy scale uncertainty, where the dashed blue line in figures 7.7 to 7.10 are almost entirely
consistent with the one vertex case. This is not too surprising as the pile-up correction applied

The most interesting case is when the effect of the jet energy scale uncertainty is extrapo-
lated to the case where Nvertex = 7, shown as the pale green region in the relative uncertainty
figures. There is now a significant rise of uncertainty beyond the zero pile-up case. In figure
7.7 the uncertainty rises above 5% in the anti-kt R = 0.6 jet case and in figure 7.9 and 7.10
there is a significant rise in the low pT region. These effects are seen to a much smaller extent
in the anti-kt R = 0.4 jet case, as expected from previous studies on the radius dependence
of pile-up in jets shapes.

With the effect of pile-up in the 2010 data seen to be minimal for each of the jet radii
considered and with the systematic uncertainty determined, comparisons to data can be now
made. Figures 7.11, 7.12, 7.13 ,7.14 and 7.15 show comparisons of the observables calcu-
lated using anti-kt R = 0.4 and anti-kt R = 0.6 jets. Whilst in general there is good
agreement between the different choice in jet radii, some regions do show significant differ-
ences. In figure 7.11 there is a trend for the gap fraction to be lower at large separations of
leading jets for R = 0.6.

The final results make comparisons of each of the observables against three theoretical
predictions. POWHEG predictions are used where the chosen PDF is CT10. Of the three
tunes considered, two use FORTRAN PYTHIA and one HERWIG+JIMMY. The PYTHIA
tunes chosen were the author tune Perugia 2011 and ATLAS tune AUET2b. The HER-
WIG+JIMMY tune is restricted to AUET2. The ATLAS tunes were optimized for the
ATLAS underlying event measurements made at 7TeV. The Perugia 2011 tune also makes
use of the recent 7TeV measurements.
In the gap fraction vs |y| ratio plots in figure 7.16 the two PYTHIA tunes are relatively
consistent. All the tunes have a trend to lie below the data as the interval size tends to large

values, with the HERWIG+JIMMY tune showing the largest discrepancy with data. There is
also a tendency for the PYTHIA tunes to have higher gap fractions than data at small |y| and
large pT. As has been seen previously the behavior of R = 0.4 is consistent with R = 0.6. In
figure 7.17, the gap fraction vs pT, it is now possible to see that there is a difference between
the two PYTHIA tunes in the low |y| region. The Perugia 2011 tune is seen to have a gap
fraction around 5% higher.
The behavior in the average veto jet number plots as a function of |y|, figure 7.18, and
pT, figure 7.19 show a consistent behavior where the HERWIG+JIMMY tune predicts too
many jets above the veto scale in the interval region. The collective behavior of the different
tunes shows good agreement of the POWHEG predictions with data, with the exception of
the high |y| regime.

Finally in the gap fraction vsQ0, figure 7.20, there is still a trend for the HERWIG+JIMMY

are probably not simply due to the model of the underlying event, but rather that the par-
ton shower differences appear to be playing a role in the disagreement. There is also an
interesting difference observed in comparing the two ratio plots for the kinematic region
5.0 < |y| < 6.0 and 80 < pT < 110, where the R = 0.6 jets gap fraction lies below data for
all the tunes whilst R = 0.4 jets show good agreement for the PYTHIA tunes.

Summary and Conclusions
The work presented in this thesis documents a major contribution to two of the early ATLAS
jet measurements:Measurement of dijet production with a veto on additional central jet
activity in pp collisions at
s = 7TeV using the ATLAS detector [1] and Measurement
of inclusive jet and dijet cross sections in proton-proton collision data at 7 TeV centre-of-
mass energy using the ATLAS detector [2]. An extension to the inclusive jet and dijet cross
section analysis is currently in collaboration review.
In this thesis next-to-leading order QCD predictions for a number of analyses have been
made using the POWHEG-BOX dijet process. In doing so, a number of interesting features
have arisen. The choice of scale has been seen to have a dramatic impact on the stability
of the predictions for the inclusive dijet mass, while having almost no effect on predictions
related to the dijet with central jet veto process. The use of scale variation was also found
to be unable to properly account for the missing higher order terms in the prediction. It
was instead necessary to rely upon the variation amongst the different shower Monte Carlo
generators to give an estimate of the uncertainty.
Data corrections have been derived for the dijet with central jet veto analysis, with conser-
vative estimates for the systematic uncertainty. In each of the analysis selections considered
the size of the corrections were small. A large reduction in the systematic uncertainty was
achieved through the development of new weighting strategies for Monte Carlo events. This
allowed the extension of the measurements to large values of |y| with low total systematics.
These samples have also been found to be useful in other analyses in ATLAS.
The theoretical predictions found to be in best agreement with the dijet with central jet
veto measurement were the POWHEG+PYTHIA predictions using either of the ATLAS
MC tunes, AMBT1 or AUET2b. Other theoretical predictions showed varying levels of
agreement, most notably HEJ performed well in the limit of large |y| and small pT. An
extension to the analysis found that the measurement could be improved through the use
of anti-kt jets of radius R = 0.4, where not only were the systematic uncertainties found
to be reduced but the sensitivity to the presence of pile-up was reduced. This allowed the
loosening of the vertex requirement and subsequently increased the number of events by a
factor of between two and three.
Overall there was observed to be a large spread of MC predictions relative to a small uncer-
tainty in the measurement. This has already led to a response from the theoretical community
[3], where it is stated
The message is clear: the accuracy of the ATLAS data already demands better theoret-
ical calculations.

Appendix A
Software
In this appendix a short description of some of the software development work carried out so
that data may be analysed for the research described in this thesis. The process of distilling
the ATLAS data is outlined and some of the benefits of the method chosen are detailed. A
short comparison is made to one of the standard ATLAS methods of data analysis.
A.1 Ntuple making
During LHC operation the ATLAS detector is able to collect an enormous amount of data,
which originates from both the high collision rate and fine granularity of the detector for
many physics objects. From the initial signal to the final analysis ready objects, the data
passes through a number of different formats. It starts as a byte-stream from the detectors
themselves and is processed into a format known as a Raw Data Object (RDO). The RDO
objects need to have the offline algorithms applied to produce calibrated physics objects.
The secondary stage is the Event Summary Data (ESD), which provides a sufficient amount
of information to re-run reconstruction algorithms. The final official format is the Analysis
Object Data (AOD), which has reduced sufficiently the size of the files to be practical for
analyses. While the volume of data is reduced tremendously it is still too copious in the
AOD form for it to be analysed locally. It is instead the preferred mechanism to access
the data through the world wide computing network commonly referred to as the Grid. As
with the case of moving from RDO to AOD, further refinement of the object selection can
be made to reduce the size of the dataset necessary to run over. These derived datasets are
typically referred to as ntuples. Where the derivation can involve removing entire collections
of objects, a reduction of the information stored in each object or filtering out entire events
that do not match required criteria. To test out new ideas for ntuple creation for analysis the
Python programming language [1] and standard library was used for its ease of use and its
growing popularity in experimental particle physics.
A.1.1 Pickling
The key element upon which this ntuple scheme is dependent upon is the process of pickling
in the Python programming language. Pickling is Pythons standard mechanism for persisting
an objects state such that it may be saved to and retrieved from disk. The reason why this is so
attractive from the point of view of analysis is that the objects which are saved are arbitrary
Python objects. With very little difficulty a programs state can be frozen and re-used at a
later time, in a completely different computing environment.
There are some limitations to what pickle objects can store. They are not able to store file
objects, network connections and alike that are dependent on transient behavior. However
these are uncommon elements to find in a particle physics ntuple. The function definitions of
objects are also not stored, only the class names are stored. This requires the class definition
to be available when unpickling and gives the flexibility of changing or adding function
behavior.
Utilizing pickle objects on their own to store physics objects is not viable due to the
fact that Python loads the whole of the pickle into memory at once. This has performance
implications when the amount of data exceeds even just a few hundred megabytes in size, a
typical reality of ntuple based analysis today.
A.1.2 ZODB
Alternatively an object database can be used, maintaining the flexibility and ease of storing
python objects via the pickle mechanism but with the practicality of handling large amounts
of data. The object database for ZOPE (ZODB) [2] was chosen. It allows arbitrary python
objects to be stored in a database. The database keeps tracks of Persistent objects and will
update the database if objects are changed in memory. Through a transaction mechanism it
is also able to create a history of the file, allowing the possibility to revert the database to
an earlier version. The main advantage over simply using pickle objects in storing data is
that the database only loads objects into memory when necessary. This reduces the memory
usage when considering a large number of events.
Code listing A.1 shows the relatively small amount of work necessary to prepare a
database for reading and writing.

and relationships indicated.
A.1.3 A Generic Event
As stated earlier an advantage of using the ZODB to store event objects is that relationships
are very easily maintained with little effort. In figure A.1 you can see a selection of the
important objects that make up an event object. You should note that of the basic objects
being stored jets, vertices and tracks that there are references to each other. For example jets
have a quantity known as the jet vertex fraction, which describes the fraction of overlapping
tracks from each vertex. This relationship is useful to maintain as it allows some simple
corrections for the effect of pile-up, which has been seen to be very important for typical
hadron collider environments.
The event objects are stored within a container known as a B+-tree [3], which has a
number of useful features. Access and insertion times have the behavior of O(logb n), where
b is the branching factor. The Info object contained in the event is used as the key in
the BTree, where the ordering of events inside the tree is decided by the event number,
luminosity block and run number. With the implementation of B+-tree in ZODB it is possible
to specify ranges of events by these properties and retrieve only those from the database.
Performing a range query, such that k-events of a given period are selected, is O(logb n + k).
A.2 Skimming and Slimming
While exposing physics objects for use in Python based analysis is of primary import. It is
also useful to consider a further reduction in dataset volume, such that analysis can be run
more often and quite possibly locally. Once the objects are contained within ZODB format
it becomes very simple to modify them. Thus events, physics objects and individual object
properties can be removed or altered to reduce the overall disk size. This can all be achieved
by the use of the del python statement. The code in listing A.2 shows how simple it is to
apply the del statement to objects at various hierarchies within the ntuple.
#Remove f i r s t e v e n t
de l r o o t [  Even t s  ] . v a l u e s ( ) [ 0 ]
#Remove j e t s from an e v e n t
myEvent = r o o t [  Even t s  ] . v a l u e s ( ) [ 0 ]
de l myEvent . j e t s
#Remove q u a l i t y i n f o rma t i o n from on l y t h e f i r s t j e t
myEvent = r o o t [  Even t s  ] . v a l u e s ( ) [ 1 ]
de l myEvent . j e t s [ 0 ] . q u a l i t y
#Commit changes
import t r a n s a c t i o n
t r a n s a c t i o n . commit ( )
Listing A.2: Example code to remove objects from events in a ZODB database
If the del statement is applied to references it will not automatically remove the object from
the database, it is only when the number of references to the object falls to zero that it will
no longer be saved. This behavior is very similar to how the memory management works
within Python.
A.3 Performance
In addition to testing the flexibility of various analysis methods it is also illustrative to com-
pare the speed in which certain tasks complete. The tools tested here are ZODB and the
AOD format. In figure A.2 the size of the input file grows as the number of events increases.
The AOD files size is 5GB for 5000 events. Typically the size of the compressed ZODB file
is half the size of the normal ZODB file. The impact of the slimming and skimming is quite
visible in the comparison between AOD and ZODB file size, where the size of the AOD files
severely restricts the total number of events which can be run over.

In figure A.3, slowest by a significant margin is the AOD file. The reason for this is the
long period of Athena software initialization, this can be seen in the significant pedestal seen
in figure A.3. Given that AOD file size is so large, it is likely that many simple analyses
would be bound by initialization time.

Although python is in some cases many magnitudes slower in general when compared to
other ntuple strategies available, the flexibility provided more than makes up for this. In the
future the discrepancy between Python and C++ should decrease. With the advent of such
Python implementations as PyPy the performance should be eventually become comparable
to that of C++. The JiT compilation seen in PyPy is able to analyse code and build a more
efficient program. Perhaps in some cases the performance exceeds C++, mainly due to some
of the more arduous compilation tools that C++ must use.

Monte Carlo Weighting Parameters
The parametrisation of the pT -|y| distributions used in weighting events for MC event gen-
eration are shown in the following tables. Each table contains all the parameters necessary to
describe the distribution for each PYTHIA jet sample, where each PYTHIA sample covers
a different range of parton transverse momentum. Within each table the models are sorted
by the size of the weight parameter w. For completeness all of the samples generated are
included in this section, however the tables highlighted with red rows were not used in the
rest of this thesis.
