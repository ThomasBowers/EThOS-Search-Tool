Tectonic earthquake swarms in the Northern Volcanic 
Zone, Iceland 
Thomas E. B. Winder 
Microseismicity offers an opportunity to image subsurface deformation at exceptionally high spatial 
and temporal resolution. This may be related to a diverse range of processes, including fore- and 
aftershocks to destructive earthquakes on large faults, magma movement at volcanoes, or the gradual 
advance of glaciers. Microearthquakes at faults might also signal more exotic behaviour, including 
due to transient events such as fluid injections or pulses of aseismic fault creep. 
The study of small earthquakes has advanced significantly over the past decades, as seismology 
has entered the digital age. Denser networks, with larger numbers of more sensitive seismometers 
allow ever smaller seismic events to be detected and analysed. The study of larger numbers of 
earthquakes brings a raft of benefits, including more robust statistical analyses, higher temporal 
resolution, and the opportunity to achieve significantly greater spatial resolution by harnessing the 
power of relative relocation algorithms. However, the fundamental task has remained the challenge 
of extracting an earthquake catalogue from continuous waveform recordings. I present new software 
that offers a powerful, efficient, and highly automatable method to produce exceptionally complete 
and robust earthquake catalogues from continuous seismic data. Instead of reducing the information 
contained in waveforms to picks  discrete timestamps marking candidate phase arrival times  
within QuakeMigrate the seismic data is transformed to continuous functions which are then combined 
across the network by migration. Retaining as much information as possible until the point of 
comparing the recordings from across the entire array allows phase arrivals at or below the signal-to-
noise ratio to be successfully associated with events, improving both detection capability and location 
resolution. 
I use QuakeMigrate to detect and locate microseismicity in the Northern Volcanic Zone, Iceland, 
from 13 years of continuous seismic data recorded on a dense local network. Through comparison 
with a comprehensive catalogue of previously analysed events, I demonstrate that this new, 
automated algorithm is capable of location accuracy equal to or surpassing the widely held gold 
standard of manually refined earthquake locations. Within my new catalogue of more than 155,000 
events, including related to magma ascent and intrusion in the lower crust, shallow geothermal 
activity, and seismicity triggered by fluid injection, I focus on persistent earthquake swarms that 
delineate a network of faults surrounding Askja volcano. 
Tightly constrained earthquake hypocentres, refined by cross correlation and relative relocation, 
reveal an intricate mesh of strike-slip faults, with fine-scaled structures resolved at length-scales of 
10s of metres. This comprehensive image of the subsurface fault structure fills in the gaps between 
manually analysed events, and combined with tightly-constrained fault plane solutions reveals 
kinematics which point to a complex deformation field, and the role of elevated pore pressures or 
mechanical anisotropy in generating anomalous fault geometries. Comparison of the temporal 
evolution of the major sources of deformation with the seismicity provides evidence that deflation of 
a shallow magma reservoir in Askja caldera plays a principal role in driving these earthquakes. 
Within individual earthquake swarms, seismicity systematically migrates along fault planes, 
indicating the role of aseismic processes in controlling their evolution. Analysis of the migration 
velocities and b-value statistics points to transient creep events as the primary driving mechanism, 
indicating the role of unusual frictional properties. Aseismic slip has recently been recognised as an 
important process in releasing strain at subduction zone interfaces, as well as on faults at a range of 
depths both in the oceans and within the continents. Such well-resolved examples of this process are 
crucial in gaining a deeper understanding of the wide spectrum of fault behaviour, and the links 
between slow and largely silent, and fast and potentially devastating fault slip. 
The Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion provides a unique opportunity to analyse the triggering 
of seismic swarms due an extremely well-resolved static stress change. As the dike intruded towards 
Askja, a surge in swarm seismicity was observed across the network of faults studied in this 
dissertation. In the absence of complicating factors present in the study of stress changes caused by 
large earthquakes, I determine that swarms initiated at Coulomb stress increases of as small as 0.025 
MPa. Furthermore, swarms do not show any seasonal tendency in occurrence, despite strong 
seasonal loading of the crust, which dominates measurements of relative crustal velocity changes. 
This further indicates that these faults experience very low effective normal stresses. 
Together, these observations indicate that this network of faults possess an exotic rheology. The 
absence of seismicity triggered elsewhere by the dike intrusion provides confidence in my observation 
of their spatial extent, which is consistent with earthquake catalogues derived from analogue seismic 
recordings extending back to the 1970s. I suggest the potential roles of fluids released at sites of 
vigorous hydrothermal activity in Askja volcano, and from numerous melt feeders in the lower crust, 
in producing the conditions that allowed these faults to develop, setting this area apart from the 
remainder of the Northern Volcanic Zone, which is otherwise largely aseismic during the current inter-
rift period.

Thank you firstly to Bob, for your supervision, patience and support, and for allowing me the freedom 
to explore my own ideas and work with others, and to learn from doing so. A lot of my favourite 
memories from my PhD come from doing science in collaboration with the Dream Team  thank you 
so much to Jenny, Clare and Tobba. I feel very lucky to have been part of such a close-knit crew from 
the very beginning of my PhD. The same goes to Omry and Conor, particularly for the good times 
spent together on fieldwork in Iceland, and at conferences elsewhere. If anyone ever needs to pitch 
their research in startup lingo, or is looking for great company for incidental holiday they should look 
no further. I also greatly enjoyed working together with Jonny and Tom as part of Team 
CMS/SeisLoc/BobLoc/QuakeMigrate, and thank them for the many discussions about software and 
science  often involving bad diagrams on whiteboards. Thanks also to Rob, for introducing me to the 
initial project of my PhD, for his help with data processing scripts and gremlins, and for getting me 
up to speed with seismology in the field all the way back in 2016. The fieldwork trips to Iceland have 
invariably been my favourite fortnight of each year; thank you to everyone who has worked to make 
them possible, particularly Sveinbjrn & Brynds, and also Heidi, Nick, Tim, Nienke, Esme, Debby, 
Joe and Katla. Thanks also to everyone else who made the rest of each year so enjoyable to spend 
at Bullard, including Simon, Paddy, Conor, Alex and Fergus. Particularly the lunchtime Spikeball crew. 
Thanks also go to all those outside Cambridge who have helped make my project possible. Foremost 
are the technicians and scientists at the Icelandic Meteorological Office who have worked to collect 
the seismic data shared for use alongside the Cambridge network, as well as the British Geological 
Survey and Chris Bean from University College Dublin. Special mention to Bergur for his patience 
and help in organising the IMO data. Additional thanks to all those who I have spoken with at 
conferences and workshops, for the advice, ideas and enthusiasm. 
I was very lucky to spend most of my time in Cambridge living with a really wonderful bunch. Thanks 
Jacques for your laughter and shared enthusiasm for stupid funny things from the internet, Karen for 
listening, laughing, baking, questioning, yoga-ing and crosswording, Jos for the great times on formal 
swaps and related shenanigans, Hannah for being endlessly enthusiastic and supportive about 
everything and anything, and chur Vic for always having a passion to share, whether bugs, great Kiwi 
films, or any other oddity under the sun. An additional mention to Jill and James for their vital role in 
founding Team Squirrels in My Pants, and to everyone else who made Churchill feel like home. 
Final thanks go to my brothers and my mum, for always being there, and for always having a joke on 
hand to make me smile.

Introduction 
1.1 Motivation and overview 
According to the Gutenberg-Richter relationship, there are vastly more small micro-earthquakes 
than there are large ones. This scales logarithmically, such that each step down in magnitude 
corresponds to a 10 times increase in abundance. Yet, historically, large magnitude events have 
mostly held the spotlight, in terms of both headlines and research focus. Their newsworthiness is easy 
to understand: though they occur far less frequently, the biggest earthquakes often have devastating 
consequences, whereas those below magnitude 3 are usually not felt. This also relates to one reason 
that they were historically not studied in detail: to accurately locate these small events is only possible 
with highly sensitive and closely spaced seismometers. However, as seismic monitoring technology 
has advanced, and dense seismic networks have become more widespread, the value of studying 
small earthquakes has become apparent. 
Their utility is in many aspects founded on their sheer frequency. This opens up the possibility to 
study deformation processes at far higher temporal resolution than previously possible from, for 
example, the few data points provided by large-magnitude aftershocks. They also occur in a vastly 
wider range of geological settings, including at volcanoes, geothermal reservoirs, glaciers, in relation 
to mining and other anthropogenic deformation, including hydro-fracking, as well as at fault systems 
large and small. Furthermore, recent advances in methods and algorithms for calculating precise 
relative locations for large numbers of small earthquakes allows for these faults and structures to be 
imaged in exquisite detail, and to gain a deeper understanding than by studying only their temporal 
occurrence. 
These advances also raise new challenges. To take full advantage of the spiralling quantities of 
continuous seismic data requires new, automatic processing techniques to replace traditional 
workflows founded on manual analysis of earthquake waveforms. This is met, however, by new 
opportunities afforded by continuing rapid advances in computational processing capabilities. 
Together, these promise a small revolution in the approach we take to analysing seismic data, and a 
significant step forward in the understanding we might gain from it. 
In this dissertation I describe an automated workflow for generating precise images of 
microseismicity from continuous seismic data, and apply it to shed new light on tectonic earthquake 
swarm seismicity in Central Iceland. The layout is as follows: 
 In the remainder of this Chapter I describe the seismicity and tectonics of Iceland, and 
briefly discuss the observation of seismic swarms here and elsewhere. 
 In Chapter 2 I describe QuakeMigrate: a new, open-source software package for the 
automatic detection and location of microseismicity from continuous seismic data. 
 In Chapter 3 I outline the collection of seismic data in Iceland, the pre-processing 
procedures applied, and the application of QuakeMigrate to generate a highly complete 
and robust earthquake catalogue for the region around Askja volcano, in the Northern 
Volcanic Zone of Central Iceland. 
 In Chapter 4 I compare the location results from this new automatic algorithm with those 
from previous manual analysis. 
 In Chapter 5 I present the relative relocation workflow applied to precisely image shallow 
earthquake swarm seismicity caused by a diverse range of processes. 
 In Chapter 6 I describe the geometry of the intricate fault network revealed by the 
relocated seismicity, revealing previously unknown kinematics, and a suggested causal 
link to volcanic deformation in Askja caldera. 
 In Chapter 7 I discuss the systematic migration of earthquake hypocentres observed 
during individual seismic swarms, captured here in unprecedented resolution. This 
analysis has important implications for the understanding of earthquake nucleation 
processes and the spectrum of fault behaviour; from fully aseismic creep to stick-slip 
earthquake sequences. 
 In Chapter 8 I describe a unique observation of tectonic earthquake swarms triggered by 
static stress changes, here caused by the 2014 Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion.  
1.2  Geological setting: the tectonics and seismicity of Iceland 
Iceland represents a subaerial section of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It is anomalous in comparison to the 
overwhelming majority of the 60,000 km mid-ocean ridge system, which resides at a remarkably 
constant depth of 2.5 km below sea level (White and Lovell, 1997). Iceland is the product of long-lived 
hotspot volcanism, which began at the same time as the continental breakup that formed the North 
Atlantic Ocean (White and McKenzie, 1989; White, 1989). It sits at the centre of the Greenland-
Iceland-Fare Ridge, which consists of thicker crust, recording enhanced melt production in the North 
Atlantic Igneous Province from the early Tertiary to the present day (Figure 1.1a). 
Figure 1.1: Map of Iceland and its location in the North Atlantic. (a): Ocean floor bathymetry is shown in blue 
colours; note the ridge extending between Greenland and the Fare Islands, with Iceland at its centre, which 
records Tertiary hotspot volcanism in the North Atlantic. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is denoted by the red line; as it 
comes on land it separates into three broader zones (b). These volcanic zones  the WVZ, EVZ and NVZ 
(western, eastern and northern)  mark where plate spreading is accommodated on land in Iceland. Reproduced 
from Green (2016).  
The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is significantly offset to the east across most of Iceland, corresponding to 
the position of the underlying mantle plume. This thermal anomaly causes both the enhanced melt 
production and isostatic support that elevate Iceland above sea level (White and McKenzie, 1989; 
White et al., 1992; Wolfe et al., 1997; Darbyshire et al., 1998; French and Romanowicz, 2015). The 
plume is centred beneath the Vatnajkull icecap (V; Figure 1.1b), which also correlates with the 
location of the highest crustal thicknesses observed in Iceland (Darbyshire et al., 1998; Jenkins et al., 
2018) and the most intense volcanic activity. The eastwards offset has accumulated progressively 
over a series of rift jumps, presumably re-aligning the centre of rifting with the plume head in each 
case. The most recent rift jump is still in progress, with spreading shifting from the western volcanic 
zone (WVZ) to the EVZ (Hardarson et al., 1997). 
1.2.1 Volcanic systems and transform zones 
The full spreading rate (18.5 mma-1, at an azimuth of 104) (DeMets et al., 2010) is accommodated 
by faulting and magmatic activity within the volcanic zones, and large transforms at the north and 
south of Iceland (Figures 1.1b, 1.2). Each volcanic zone consists of an array of en-echelon spreading 
centres, or volcanic systems, with their fissure swarms mapped by surface features including faults, 
fractures and volcanic fissures. They are typically around 15 km wide and up to 150 km in length, and 
represent the localisation of extension in the brittle upper crust. Though their surface features are 
continually re-surfaced by lava flows and other eruptive products, the fissure swarms provide a broad 
picture of the distribution of deformation within the rift zones, and their relative ages. 
Figure 1.2: Tectonic structure of Iceland. Fissure swarms of individual volcanic systems (Einarsson and 
Smundsson, 1987; Smundsson, 1979) are shown in beige, with the topography overlain in grey. Central 
volcanoes are outlined in red. Transform zones are shown by blue arrows and labels: SISZ = South Iceland 
Seismic Zone, TFZ = Tjrnes Fracture Zone, and the volcanic zones are labelled as in Figure 1.1. Topography 
of glaciers is shown in blue/white, labelled as L = Langjkull, H = Hofsjkull, and V = Vatnajkull. The plate 
spreading vector is illustrated by black arrows. Reproduced from Green (2016). 
Many volcanic systems contain a central volcano (Figure 1.2), which mark the loci of well-
developed magma transport, storage, and differentiation pathways through the crust. Though 
eruptions commonly occur within these caldera systems, magma can also be intruded over long 
distances into the fissure swarms, sometimes producing eruptions at more than 60 km distance. 
Eruptive products in individual volcanic systems often share a distinct geochemical and petrological 
fingerprint (e.g. Jakobsson, 1979; Sigmarsson and Halldrsson, 2015), providing evidence that the 
genesis of new oceanic crust by lateral flow is common in Iceland (Sigurdsson and Sparks, 1978). 
However, recent observations of microseismicity near the Askja central volcano suggest that melt 
does not always ascend from the mantle at a single location in each volcanic system (Soosalu et al., 
2010; Key et al., 2011a,b; Greenfield and White, 2015). 
Figure 1.3: Schematic of the mechanism of plate spreading within volcanic systems. The brittle upper crust 
accumulates elastic strain, which is released by dike injection and faulting, while the ductile lower crust and 
mantle deform continuously. Modified after Wright et al. (2012). 
Rifting events in each volcanic system are highly episodic, and often separated by centuries. In 
the inter-rift phase, the ductile part of the lithosphere deforms by continuous creep, while the brittle 
upper crust accumulates elastic strain (Figure 1.3). These stresses are then released by dike 
intrusions and faulting, as observed in Iceland during the Krafla Fires (1975-1984; Einarsson and 
Brandsdttir, 1980), the Brarbunga-Holuhraun rifting event (2014-15; Sigmundsson et al., 2015; 
gstsdttir et al., 2016), and most recently during the ongoing volcano-tectonic episode on the 
Reykjanes Peninsula (2020-present; e.g. Geirsson et al., 2021). Similar rifting episodes have also 
been observed with comprehensive geophysical monitoring networks in Afar (Wright et al., 2012) and 
in Hawaii (Neal et al., 2019). 
This cycle is also evident in the seismicity recorded across Iceland in the past decades (Figure 
1.4). In most volcanic systems, shallow seismicity is confined to concentrated points, corresponding 
to the location of geothermal systems, most commonly closely associated with central volcanoes. 
This pattern is interrupted most strikingly by the 2014 Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion, but also 
by the seismicity associated with the ongoing rifting event on the Reykjanes Peninsula, and the 2010 
eruption of Eyjafjallajkull (shown in orange). Elsewhere, the volcanic systems have been largely 
aseismic over this 25 year period. 
The seismicity also highlights the transform zones at the north and south of Iceland (blue in Figure 
1.4), and delineates their unusual fault structure. Within the South Iceland Seismic Zone (SISZ), left-
lateral shear is accommodated by north-south oriented right-lateral strike-slip faults, in a bookshelf-
faulting mechanism (Einarsson et al., 1981). The Tjrnes Fracture Zone (TFZ) is also significantly 
more complex than a single through-going strike-slip fault, being partitioned between three separate 
strands (Figure 1.4). The middle strand  the Hsavk-Flatey Fault (HFF)  accommodates transform 
motion along an extended right-lateral strike-slip fault, whereas the Grmsey Oblique Rift is a more 
complicated mixture of faulting and oblique volcanic systems, and the Dalvk lineament exhibits 
bookshelf faulting similar to the SISZ (Rgnvaldsson et al., 1998).

events in the major transform zones (Tjrnes Fracture Zone/South Iceland Seismic Zone), and orange those 
during rifting events/eruptions. Background as in Figure 1.2. Earthquakes from the Icelandic Met Office. 
1.2.2 Swarm seismicity in Iceland 
The largest earthquakes observed in Iceland occur in the transform zones (e.g. Brandsdttir et al., 
2010; Hensch et al., 2016; Rgnvaldsson et al., 1998; Passarelli et al., 2018). In contrast, seismicity 
within volcanic systems in Iceland predominantly occurs as swarms, as opposed to mainshock-
aftershock sequences. 
Seismic swarms within the volcanic systems are associated with a variety of processes. In the 
lower crust, they have been linked to the ascent of magma or magmatic fluids (e.g. Tarasewicz et al.,

near Askja 
2012; Greenfield and White, 2015) including dike intrusions (Jakobsdttir et al., 2008; White et al., 
2011). In the upper crust, they are often found at geothermal areas (Ward et al., 1969; Tryggvason, 
1973; Einarsson and Jakobsson, 2020), and associated with magmatic intrusions and/or eruptions 
(e.g. Einarsson and Brandsdttir, 1980; Tarasewicz et al., 2014; gstsdttir et al., 2016, 2019; 
Woods et al., 2019). In each of these scenarios there is some form of externally modulated transient 
stress imposed upon the shallow crust, leading to the sustained seismicity. In geothermal areas the 
stressing is driven by fluid flow and expansion through fractures and pore spaces, whereas during 
magmatic events it is caused by over-pressured magma breaking a pathway through brittle material 
to form a dike or sill, over timescales of hours to weeks. 
However, swarms have also been observed on the western half of the Hsavk-Flatey fault, where 
no such forcing is apparent (Passarelli et al., 2018). Statistical and spatiotemporal analysis of six 
earthquake swarms on the HFF between 1997-2015 reveal that they obey self-consistent scaling 
relationships, form a mosaic of spatially complementary patches of the fault, and exhibit systematic 
migration of hypocentres. Focal mechanisms show conclusively that the earthquakes consisted of 
fault-parallel right-lateral strike-slip failure. These observations are consistent with tectonic 
earthquake swarms (TES) observed elsewhere (e.g. Vidale et al., 2006; Roland and McGuire, 2009). 
In these cases, the hypocentre migration velocities, effective stress drops of the swarms, and, in some 
instances, comparisons between seismic and geodetic measurements (Lohman and McGuire, 2007), 
provide evidence that the transient driving mechanism was instead aseismic slip (or creep) on the 
fault plane, with earthquakes restricted to embedded brittle asperities. 
This process is important to understand in several contexts. Aseismic slip events have recently 
been discovered (primarily through geodetic observations) to play an important role in releasing strain 
at shallow subduction zone interfaces (e.g. Peng and Gomberg, 2010). It also likely accounts for a 
large portion of slip at oceanic transform faults, and has furthermore been linked to the initiation of 
large earthquakes, evidenced for by precursory swarms of microseismicity (Kuna et al., 2019). In 
addition, the converse is also commonly observed, with large earthquakes leading to aseismic after-
slip, which plays an important role in determining the spatiotemporal evolution of aftershock 
sequences (e.g. Jiang et al., 2021), and potential triggering of subsequent further large events. 
However, in most cases the resolution and completeness of earthquake catalogues places limits 
on the inferences that can be drawn from any associated microseismicity, particularly with respect to 
analysis of their spatiotemporal evolution. Furthermore, though observations of these aseismic creep 
events might provide new insights into the nucleation processes leading to large fault ruptures, the 
factors promoting initiation of the preceding slip events themselves is largely unknown. 
1.3 The Askja volcanic system 
A further area of anomalous seismicity in Iceland,  east of the Askja central volcano (Figures 1.4, 1.5), 
provides a rare opportunity to study tectonic earthquake swarms at high resolution, and their response 
to well-resolved static stress changes. The first seismic swarms observed in this area  and not 
directly associated with an eruption  occurred between 1980-83, around the time that seismic 
stations were first installed within ~ 60 km of Askja (Einarsson and Jakobsson, 2020; Figure 1.5). 
These swarms appear to form lineations northwest and northeast of Askja, but the location resolution 
is limited. They also stand out as occurring primarily in between volcanic systems, and not in 
association with any surface manifestations of geothermal activity. 
Figure 1.5: Seismicity in Central Iceland, 1975-85. Earthquakes are shown by open circles, scaled by 
magnitude. Volcanic systems are stippled, volcanic centres are shown by dashed outlines and labelled: B = 
Brarbunga, G = Grmsvtn, K = Kverkfjll, T = Thrdarhyrna and A = Askja; calderas shown by ticked lines. 
Vatnajkull ice sheet is shown in white. Reproduced from Einarsson (1991). 
These swarms have continued since, and further analysis has been carried out based on 
recordings from a dense local seismic network, deployed by the University of Cambridge in 2007. In 
particular, Green et al. (2014) sought to determine the geometry and kinematics of the faults revealed 
by these seismic swarms, and their relation to the regional deformation field, by manual analysis of a

subset of the recorded earthquakes (Figure 1.6). Their automatic catalogue revealed a consistent 
distribution of seismicity (Figure 1.6a) and fault plane solutions and relative relocations derived from 
manual phase arrival picking showed an array of sub-parallel left-lateral strike-slip faults (Figure 1.6c), 
which they interpreted to be accommodating right-lateral transform motion by bookshelf faulting. 
However, the relatively small proportion of the seismicity that the relocated earthquakes represent 
precludes any analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of individual swarms.

Vaalda 
The most recent rifting episode in the Askja volcanic system occurred in 1874-76, with a regional 
dike intruded northwards from Askja, and eruptions at Nahraun, 60 km to the north (Brandsdttir et 
al., 1992; Hartley and Thordarson, 2013), and in the caldera. skjuvatn (now filled by a lake of the 
same name; Figure 1.7), the youngest of Askjas nested calderas, was formed during this period. 
There have been several smaller eruptions since (pink in Figure 1.7; Hartley and Thordarson, 2013). 
Short-lived fissure eruptions around the skjuvatn ring fault system between 1921-1926 formed 
small-volume lava flows (0.001  0.02 km3) within the main caldera, while a larger fissure to the south 
erupted intermittently between 1924-29, forming the Thorvaldshraun lava field (0.126 km3; Hartley 
and Thordarson, 2012). The most recent eruption occurred on a fissure in the northeast of the caldera 
at Vikraborgir (Figure 1.7) in 1961, with a total volume of ~ 0.1 km3 (Hartley et al., 2016). The 
remainder of the area is covered mainly by hyaloclastite of various ages, and older post-glacial lava 
flows. 
Figure 1.7 also shows the 2014-15 Holuhraun lava field, which was fed by a large regional dike 
intruded 48 km from Brarbunga caldera (Figures 1.4, 1.5). During its propagation, intense seismicity 
was recorded both at the base of the dike (Woods et al., 2019; gstsdttir et al., 2016, 2019) and in 
areas ahead of and adjacent to it (Green et al., 2015). Intriguingly, this included seismic swarm 
seismicity in the area northeast of Askja volcano, suggesting the process driving the seismic swarms 
was also affected by the static stress field imparted by the dike opening. 
In this dissertation I analyse earthquake swarms recorded over 13 years in the region around Askja 
volcano, in Central Iceland. Using observations from a dense local seismic network, and newly 
developed software, I build a highly complete earthquake catalogue and calculate tightly constrained 
hypocentre locations. With this more complete picture of the seismicity, I analyse the kinematics of 
faulting in the region, the evolution of individual seismic swarms, and the relationship between the 
2014 Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion and a surge in the rate of seismic swarms in the region 
around Askja. 
Chapter 2 
QuakeMigrate  a Python package for 
automatic earthquake detection and location 
In this Chapter I describe QuakeMigrate: a new, modular, open-source Python package providing a 
framework to efficiently, automatically and robustly detect and locate microseismicity. The user inputs 
continuous seismic data, a velocity model (or pre-calculated traveltime lookup table) and station 
inventory. Instead of reducing the raw waveforms to discrete time picks, they are transformed (by 
amplitude, frequency and/or polarisation analysis) to continuous functions representing the probability 
of a particular phase arrival through time. These onset functions from stations across the network 
are then migrated according to a traveltime lookup table and stacked to perform a grid-search for 
coherent sources of energy in the subsurface. This enables detection of seismic events with phase 
arrivals at close to or below the signal-to-noise ratio at individual stations, and implicitly associates 
phase arrivals across a network, even at very small inter-event times. 
Here I outline the inversion procedure and the structure of the software package, before 
demonstrating its usage in detecting basal icequakes at the Rutford Ice Stream, Antarctica. This case 
study illustrates the effectiveness of QuakeMigrate for microseismic detection in the presence of 
extremely high event rates and on seismic recordings heavily contaminated by impulsive noise from 
surface crevassing, achieving an order of magnitude increase in event detections compared to 
previous studies. Furthermore, the cause and location of icequakes in this region have been studied 
in detail, providing an opportunity to straightforwardly compare the QuakeMigrate location results 
against a well-defined expected distribution of seismicity. 
The development of QuakeMigrate has been a fantastic team effort. I first became involved with 
the project in April 2018 (when it was known as Coalescence Microseismic Scanning  CMS), and 
have led the development since September 2018, through a brief phase as SeisLoc, and as 
QuakeMigrate since April 2019. All previous versions are archived within the QuakeMigrate GitHub 
repository1 for posterity. It wouldnt have been possible without the early work of Julian Drew, who 
translated much of his (proprietary, closed-source) Coalescence Microseismic Mapping software 
(CMM; Drew et al., 2013) from MATLAB into Python; the efforts of Jonathan Smith and Tom Hudson 
1 https://github.com/QuakeMigrate  
in beginning the process of debugging this early code, and making significant improvements to the 
workflow; and mostly the work of Conor Bacon, who I have worked closely with in re-writing the 
package from the ground up to make the notable improvements described herein. I have led the 
development, implementation and testing of all key features of the code, but with assistance in writing 
and reviewing code and bouncing ideas amongst the entire team, and particularly with Conor, with 
whom I jointly wrote the plotting scripts which produce the automatic plots output by Trigger and 
Locate, and who has taught me so much about implementing my ideas the Pythonic way. Conor also 
led the implementation of the modular architecture, made significant improvements to the speed and 
efficiency of the core C migration functions, as well as leading the effort to make the software fully 
cross-platform. The icequake case study presented here was originally devised by Tom Hudson, but 
I re-processed the data with a later version of the software and thereby achieved the dramatic 
improvement in the number of icequakes detected. I have written the text, which will soon be 
submitted as:

and stacking. Geophysical Journal International. In prep. 
with assistance from Tom Hudson in describing the microseismicity at the Rutford Ice Stream, as 
noted in the text. Figures plotted by others are acknowledged, and work is otherwise my own. Note 
that the term earthquake is used loosely throughout to refer to microseismic events of various 
natures (including, e.g. icequakes). 
2.1 Motivation and Overview 
Detecting and locating microearthquakes from continuous waveform records is the fundamental step 
in microseismic processing. Increasing use of dense local seismic networks and the advent of storing 
continuous waveforms has led to a huge increase in the quantity of available data. These arrays of 
stations have introduced the theoretical possibility to detect large numbers of far weaker events, but 
when viewed on seismic records from individual stations their waveforms are often difficult to 
distinguish from noise. The huge quantity of data to be processed also precludes traditional workflows 
based on manual inspection of seismograms, particularly in settings with extremely high event rates 
(e.g. Cesca and Grigoli, 2015; Grigoli et al., 2017, 2018; gstsdttir et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2020; 
Niemz et al., 2020). In order to maximise the new insights gained, we require fully automated 
techniques which can exploit modern recordings and computing facilities to produce highly complete 
earthquake catalogues containing few artefacts. 
The standard and most widely used approach first detects phase arrivals by considering the 
seismic traces recorded at each station individually, before comparing the picks made at stations 
across the network (e.g. Grigoli et al., 2018). An event detection is declared if enough picks are 
successfully associated to a common source, the location of which can then be further refined. 
However, there is a clear trade-off between lowering the detection threshold, in the desire to make 
more picks and produce a more complete catalogue, and the resulting increase in mis-picks. Even in 
low-noise conditions, and despite significant recent advances (e.g. Ross et al., 2019a), associating 
phase picks to individual seismic events is a challenging procedure, and particularly in the presence 
of mis-picks. Microseismic datasets often contain large numbers of events with short inter-event times; 
they may be so closely spaced that their phase arrivals overlap in time. Incorrect phase identification 
or association can result in missed detections and significant location errors. 
More recently, a second class of waveform-based approaches has been developed, derived from 
the waveform migration and stacking techniques used in active-source seismology. Instead of 
reducing the information recorded at each seismometer to discrete time picks, the waveforms 
recorded across the entire network are combined to perform a grid-search for coherent sources of 
energy in the subsurface. The governing principle behind this procedure is to focus or reconstruct the 
source energy at the time and grid point (location) that corresponds to the earthquake origin time and 
hypocentre, and is variably referred to as waveform migration and stacking, diffraction stack imaging, 
backprojection imaging, beamforming, coalescence mapping or coherence scanning (e.g. Cesca & 
Grigoli, 2015; Li et al., 2020). In doing so, these techniques are able to exploit the coherence between 
information recorded at stations across the network, significantly increasing their detection capability 
and robustness when considering low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) microearthquakes. These benefits 
have been shown in a diverse range of microseismic monitoring applications, including in industrial 
contexts such as mining and geothermal exploitation, in the study of natural seismicity at local and 
regional scale, and at volcanoes and glaciers (e.g. Grigoli et al., 2017; Cesca & Grigoli 2015, and 
references therein).  However, though there is great promise of automation, there are still several 
steps of the processing routine which require manual intervention: particularly at the detection stage, 
and in distinguishing real events from artefacts in the final quality-control check. Furthermore, the 
benefit of utilising the otherwise redundant information contained in the full waveform comes at the 
cost of significantly increased computation time compared to pick-based routines. 
QuakeMigrate is a new, open-source, robust and computationally efficient software package for 
the automatic detection and location of microseismicity by waveform migration and stacking. 
QuakeMigrate is written in Python to be accessible, easy to use and fully cross-platform (relying on 
only a small number of core Python packages: NumPy  Harris et al., 2020; SciPy  Virtanen et al., 
2020; PyProj  Snow et al., 2021; pandas  McKinney, 2010, The pandas development team, 2020; 
and Matplotlib  Hunter, 2007) and wraps a compiled C library containing the core migration and 
stacking functions, in order to maximise their speed. It interfaces with ObsPy (Bayreuther et al., 2010) 
to provide compatibility with any common seismic data format, and is designed in a pluggable, 
modular architecture to make it rapidly adaptable for application to seismic data from a wide range of 
settings. The user interacts with the software through simple high-level functions, but the code is 
thoroughly commented and documented throughout, to promote extension or augmentation by the 
user-base, and to make certain that this code is not provided as a black box. 
I first outline the processing procedure both from a theoretical perspective and from that of a 
prospective user, and illustrate how QuakeMigrate has been developed to be incorporated within 
existing research workflows used to process data archives. I then demonstrate its performance in the 
detection and location of basal icequakes at the Rutford Ice Stream, Antarctica. 
2.2 Method 
A thorough discussion of the variety of waveform-based location techniques developed so far is 
provided in Li et al. (2020). Here I briefly outline their relative benefits and downsides, and describe 
the theory underpinning the functionality of QuakeMigrate. 
Across all implementations of the waveform-based approach, the representation of the waveforms 
that is migrated, and the stacking (or imaging) operator used to combine them at each grid point, 
govern its computational cost, sensitivity, noise robustness and imaging resolution. Full-waveform 
inversion can be used to simultaneously obtain high fidelity source locations and an improved velocity 
model for the subsurface, however at an often-prohibitive computational cost. Alternatively, time-
reverse imaging (TRI) involves simply propagating the full waveform back into the subsurface 
according to the velocity of the medium, without solving the wave equation. However, unlike for the 
isotropic sources used in exploration seismology, TRI demands that earthquake waveforms are 
corrected for the source mechanism, to prevent destructive interference of waveforms originating in 
different quadrants of the focal sphere. Furthermore, a dense search grid and sensor array, and 
accurate velocity model, are still required to avoid spatial aliasing, potentially making it extremely 
computationally demanding. To overcome these limitations, the concept of partial waveform stacking 
(PWS) was introduced, and stands out as the most widely used and successful implementation of the 
waveform-based earthquake detection and location techniques introduced to date. 
PWS is a hybrid approach, where primary phases contained in the earthquake waveform (e.g. P- 
and S-waves) are considered through transformation of the seismic traces recorded at each station 
using a characteristic function (CF). Various CFs have been designed to distinguish the changes in 
the amplitude, polarisation or frequency content of the seismic signal associated with P- and S-phase 
onsets. Many of these algorithms share their foundation with those developed for automatic phase 
picking, including the short-term average to long-term average ratio (STA/LTA) of the signal amplitude 
(Drew et al., 2013; Grigoli et al., 2013), higher-order statistics such as kurtosis (Langet et al., 2014), 
and the Hilbert transform (or envelope function). However, instead of only extracting the timing of 
peaks that exceed a user-defined threshold (picks), here all of the information in the transformed 
signal is retained. Hereafter referred to as onset functions, these continuous signals peak around the 
time of seismic phase (e.g. P and S) arrivals and are required to be always positive to ensure 
constructive stacking when migrated. 
A second class of PWS approach involves instead cross-correlating the raw waveforms (MCM; Shi 
et al., 2019) or onset functions (BackTrackBB; Poiata et al., 2016) from pairs of stations for each 
phase. Here, instead, the resulting functions are of correlation coefficient against lag-time, and are 
migrated and stacked according to a lookup table of differential travel-times. This method benefits 
from an additional layer of noise reduction, and a factor of ~ N(N-1) increase in observations 
contributing to the stack, but come at a significant computational cost, limiting their usefulness for 
most users. 
The detection and location process in QuakeMigrate comprises three key steps. First, the 
continuous data is pre-processed according to the chosen characteristic function, to produce a 
continuous onset function for each selected seismic phase, for each seismic station. This may be 
calculated based on individual components, or a combination thereof. Secondly, the onset functions 
are continuously migrated into a 3D subsurface grid, where each grid point represents a potential 
hypocentre location, and each timestamp a candidate earthquake origin time. At each grid node, the 
onset functions from every station in the network are aligned according to a pre-calculated traveltime 
lookup table for each station and phase, and stacked according to the stacking function. This is 
repeated for a range of potential origin times, resulting in a 4D image (or coalescence function) 
representing an exhaustive search in space and time. Where the onset functions from stations across 
the network stack coherently  or coalesce  at a particular grid point and origin time, a peak in the 
value of the 4D coalescence function will occur, indicating a candidate event hypocentre. The third 
and final step comprises identifying these peaks through space and time. Most commonly this is 
achieved through analysing the time series of maximum instantaneous stacking values (the maximum 
coalescence value in the 3D grid at each timestamp), using a trigger algorithm and/or a static trigger-
threshold value. The final output is a catalogue of event origin times and locations, corresponding to 
the timing and location of peaks in the maximum coalescence value that exceed the trigger threshold. 
By using a far greater proportion of the information contained in the recorded waveforms, and 
exploiting the coherency of signals measured between stations across a network, this procedure has 
been shown to perform better at detecting events at low magnitudes and with short inter-event times 
than even highly sophisticated pick-based routines (e.g. Grigoli et al., 2018). Furthermore, it is 
impressively robust in the presence of noise, for example the contamination of glacial seismology 
recordings by crevassing events (Hudson et al., 2019). However there are a few comparative 
downsides of the waveform-based approach, namely its higher computational cost, the difficulty in 
assessing spatial uncertainties of the output locations, and some remaining hurdles in fully automating 
the event detection and quality control steps. 
In QuakeMigrate, the migration procedure is separated into two stages; first an exhaustive scan is 
performed on a decimated grid: the Detect stage. This produces (and saves) a continuous timeseries 
of maximum coalescence values and their locations, from which the times and locations of candidate 
events are identified using one of a range of triggering algorithms, in the Trigger stage. Finally, in the 
Locate stage, a short window of time around each triggered candidate event is re-migrated on a 
higher resolution grid, and location uncertainties are reported among several other optional outputs. 
This approach significantly increases the computational efficiency of the procedure, and care has 
been taken to ensure considerable speed-ups can be achieved without any reduction in detection 
performance. 
In the Locate stage we follow the approach described by Drew et al. (2013) to produce a 3D image 
approximating the probability density function (PDF) describing the source location. This distribution 
may be characterised (e.g. according to a Gaussian parameterisation) in order to estimate the 
earthquake location uncertainty, and to help automatically distinguish real events from artefacts. 
2.3 Software functionality and workflow 
The QuakeMigrate workflow is straightforward and efficient, consisting of simple steps which are 
described in detail in the documentation2 and demonstrated in the example usage scripts available in 
the QuakeMigrate GitHub repository3. The software has been designed with a modular architecture 
(Figure 2.1), making the inputs and outputs of each stage transparent and readily available to the 
user, and the overall workflow adaptable, customisable and extensible. For example, the Onset and 
Pick modules are fully pluggable, giving the user the flexibility to substitute in any Characteristic 
Function or automatic picking algorithm they choose (Figure 2.1). It is hoped that these will be 
contributed to the public repository such that they will benefit the entire community.

outlines (Onset, Pick and Magnitudes) are plugin/extension modules of the code that can be customised or 
substituted for alternatives by the user; arrows indicate the sequence of steps in the processing workflow. Figure

2.3.1 Installation 
The QuakeMigrate software package is available for download in a public GitHub repository3, and 
version v1.0.0 (described herein) is additionally archived on Zenodo (Winder et al., 2021). Detailed 
instructions for installation using the included conda environment file are provided in the 
documentation1, and the package will soon also be available directly through pip or conda via the 
2 https://quakemigrate.readthedocs.io 
3 https://github.com/QuakeMigrate/QuakeMigrate 
Python Package Index (PyPI) and conga-forge repositories, respectively. Several test datasets based 
on different use-cases, including the one described here, are provided to ensure the software is 
functioning correctly, and to make available fully commented examples both demonstrating how to 
run the code and providing advice on parameter selection. 
2.3.2 Generation of traveltime lookup tables 
A 3D grid of pre-computed traveltimes for each station and phase is fundamental to the QuakeMigrate 
workflow, and additionally defines the search grid used for migration. The user has two options: they 
can compute this lookup table (LUT) through built-in functions, or import LUTs created by other 
means through converting them to the paired buffer- and header-file format used by the NonLinLoc 
software package (Lomax et al., 2000). This provides a means for wave speed anisotropy and 3D 
velocity inhomogeneity to be included if so desired. It is strongly preferred to use both P and S phases 
wherever possible because of the resulting increase in both detection capability and location 
resolution. 
Within QuakeMigrate, LUTs can be computed from either homogeneous or 1D velocity models. 
For 1D models, the user has the option to use either the fast-marching method (Rawlinson & 
Sambridge, 2005) through functions utilising the scikit-fmm Python package, or via the finite-
difference scheme of Podvin and Lecomte (1991) through functions wrapping the implementation of 
this technique in the NonLinLoc program Grid2Time (Lomax et al., 2000). The advantage of the 
NonLinLoc method is that the LUT (search) grid need not include the locations of all the stations, 
potentially avoiding computation time being wasted migrating and stacking onset functions to grid 
nodes in areas where earthquakes are unlikely to occur. 
In general, with the default settings, the detection performance of QuakeMigrate is relatively 
insensitive to modest velocity model inaccuracies (e.g. due to using a 1D approximation to the 
subsurface velocity structure). The default characteristic function used for Detect (the classic, 
overlapping STA/LTA) produces a comparatively broad peak around phase onsets, allowing coherent 
phase arrivals to coalesce even where there are moderate errors in the pre-computed traveltimes. 
This makes it possible to use QuakeMigrate in regions where little prior research has been 
undertaken, and only a basic velocity model is available. It also allows the user to utilise a relatively 
coarse search grid for the Detect stage, reducing memory usage and computation time. Due to the 
pluggable nature of the Onset module (Figure 2.1), this is entirely customisable by the user, so that if 
a high resolution 3D velocity model and sufficient computational resources are available, more sharply 
peaked onset functions may be used, which may allow for better distinction of extremely closely 
spaced events. 
Absolute location performance is inevitably dependent on the accuracy of the velocity model used 
to calculate the LUT. However, in the scenario described previously where the velocity model is poorly 
known, QuakeMigrate may still be used to construct a preliminary earthquake catalogue, providing 
the means to refine the velocity model based on the phase arrival data obtained from these events 
(perhaps even using the automatic phase picks optionally output by Locate  section 2.3.8). Locate 
may then be re-run to calculate final locations using a more accurate model. 
2.3.3 Reading continuous waveform data 
The QuakeMigrate Archive class provides functions for querying a local archive of continuous  
waveform data. It is built around ObsPy (Bayreuther et al., 2010), which provides support for reading 
a wide range of common seismic data formats (including miniSEED, SAC, SEGY, SEISAN etc.). A 
selection of common waveform archive directory structures are built in, including, for example, the 
SeisComp Data Structure (SDS), and that recommended by SEIS-UK. However, any arbitrary, but 
regular, directory structure can be accommodated through specifying a description of the format (e.g. 
YYYY/MM/DD/*_STATION_*) to the format keyword argument when instantiating the Archive 
object. More details are provided in the documentation2. 
It is recommended that the user conducts quality control on the raw data before using 
QuakeMigrate to process it. Sharp signal offsets, for example caused by instrument failures, can 
negatively affect the false trigger rate and location quality, and inclusion of data with timing errors will 
also inevitably be detrimental to performance. Currently, in determining data availability for onset 
calculation, traces with data gaps within the time window being analysed are rejected, though this 
strict treatment may not be necessary depending on the chosen onset function method. Where the 
data archive contains mixed data sampling rates, the capability to unify the sampling rate is included, 
through up-sampling and/or decimation. 
2.3.4 Calculation of onset functions 
As described previously, the onset functions represent a transformation of the raw data according to 
a Characteristic Function which highlights P, S or other arbitrary phase arrivals, and is always positive, 
to ensure constructive interference when migrated (Figure 2.2). Several functions which loosely 
satisfy these criteria have been implemented since Kao & Shan (2004) first used the envelope function 
in their Source Scanning Algorithm. The relative benefits of STA/LTA, kurtosis (or the positive kurtosis 
gradient) and simply migrating the raw data (RTI  though note the requirement to correct for the 
source mechanism) have been thoroughly explored in the literature (e.g. Beskardes et al., 2018; 
Grigoli et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020). However, yet more functions continue to be suggested, aiming to 
improve location resolution, detection capability for low SNR events, and robustness to noise (e.g. 
Hendriyana et al., 2018; Guidarelli et al., 2020). 
To take advantage of the full range of characteristic functions available, including those yet to be 
developed, and of which the most suitable may vary between applications, the Onset module has 
been implemented as a plug-in (Figure 2.1). A small selection are built in, including the default 
STA/LTA, but it is hoped there will be a community-driven expansion in future. An STA/LTA algorithm 
is used by default due to its good resolution, relatively low sensitivity to velocity model errors, and 
robustness in the presence of noise. Furthermore, Drew et al. (2013) showed that where an 
appropriate choice of short- and long-term window lengths is made, the width of the peaks in the 
calculated onset functions corresponds to the statistical error in the timing of the corresponding phase 
arrivals, while their amplitude corresponds to the SNR. As such, when combined using the appropriate 
stacking function (section 2.3.5) the 3D coalescence maps produced can be interpreted as (un-
normalized) probability-density functions describing the source location uncertainty. This provides the 
capability to rigorously assess the uncertainty of the returned event locations without resorting to 
(often computationally intensive) statistical re-sampling techniques, such as bootstrapping, commonly 
relied upon by existing waveform-based location techniques (e.g. Grigoli et al., 2013). 
Figure 2.2: Schematic diagram illustrating the transformation of raw seismic data to onset functions. Here pre-
processed seismic data (left; bandpass filtered between 2-14 Hz) are transformed into onset functions (right), 
sensitive to P- and S-wave phase arrivals, respectively. The P onset function is calculated from the short-term 
average/ long-term average ratio (STA/LTA) of the amplitude of the vertical component seismogram; S from the 
horizontal components. Modified after Drew et al. (2013). 
Typically, for seismic networks deployed on the ground surface, the vertical component 
seismogram will dominantly record P-wave arrivals, while the horizontal components show S-wave 
arrivals more clearly. With the default STA/LTA algorithm the S onset function is thus calculated from 
the root-mean-square of those calculated from the two horizontal seismograms. In cases which do 
not conform to this typical distinction, the user may instead wish to use a different selection of 
components for each phase (for example in the case of borehole instruments) and/or polarization 
analysis to discriminate between P and S (or other) phase arrivals. The flexible implementation of the 
Onset module makes these adaptations straightforward. Though the strict relationships between 
arrival time uncertainty and arrival SNR to the width and height of the peaks will not be necessarily 
be maintained, the theory may be extended so long as the mapping is approximate (Drew et al., 
2013). QuakeMigrate will therefore still provide robust estimates of the relative timing uncertainties 
and SNRs between phase arrivals, and thus between events. 
Among the included options are a classic (overlapping) and centred configuration of the 
STA/LTA algorithm, where the calculated ratio is assigned to the end of both windows and the end of 
the LTA window (start of the STA window) respectively. The classic implementation is less sensitive 
to sharp data offsets due to instrument failures, and produces a broader peak for each phase arrival, 
while the centred configuration is less phase-shifted (late) and is most appropriate for the theoretical 
framework outlined by Drew et al. (2013) when considering the assessment of spatial uncertainties 
output by Locate.  
2.3.5 The stacking operator 
It is important to note that Detect is not dependent on any particular theoretical basis for the 
combination of onset functions, as it is, in essence, a purely pragmatic exercise in identifying 
candidate events from noise, rather than attempting to accurately locate them. It is the recognition of 
this distinction that provides the motivation to separate Detect and Locate, allowing for them to be 
optimised individually for their respective goals. 
This unique approach provides significant benefits in computational efficiency and in modularity, 
increasing both transparency to the user and flexibility to optimise the workflow to adapt to the differing 
challenges and research goals associated with different datasets. Nevertheless, in its current 
implementation, the same stacking operator (or imaging function) is used in the migration undertaken 
during both Detect and Locate, though the treatment of the resulting 4D coalescence functions are 
significantly different. 
At each timestamp (candidate event origin time), an instantaneous 3D coalescence map is 
calculated by migrating the onset functions according to the traveltimes, , stored in the lookup table, 
and stacking them at each grid point, . Drew et al. (2013) determined that where the onset functions 
OFi(t) approximate continuous (un-normalised) probability density functions describing the likelihood 
and timing of a phase arrival, taking the root of their product allows us to calculate a coalescence 
function,  : 
"(, ) 	= *#.	 +	#()1
,        (2.1) 
the calculation of which can also be expressed as the exponent of the arithmetic mean of their 
logarithms: 
    																															=  5
 %&	()*"+,	-	."(/)2)
6      (2.2) 
which provides a more computationally efficient approach. This calculation is repeated over a range 
of timestamps to produce a 4D coalescence function describing the focussing of seismic energy in 
the subsurface through time. As detailed in Drew et al. (2013), this represents a simplified 
representation of the posterior probability distribution for the hypocentre parameters (source location 
and origin time) at the time of an event. 
This stacking operator is equivalent to taking the geometric mean of the onset functions. In 
comparison to the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean is significantly less sensitive to outliers, and 
in contrast to taking the median of the migrated onset functions (e.g. Hansen and Schmandt, 2015) 
is still sensitive to their coherence. It is these characteristics that make this operator well-suited for 
use in Detect, as well as for its originally intended purpose in Locate. The modular implementation of 
the stacking function, however, makes it possible in principal to substitute it for an alternative, for 
example to explicitly calculate the coherence between P and S onset functions by taking their dot-
product, as in Grigoli et al. (2013). This might improve robustness to false detections due to under-
migration of true events (the shooting star artefact described by Beskardes et al., (2018), and 
discussed in Chapter 3), but precludes the detection of atypical events, for example due to landslides, 
or exotic sources in volcanic environments, where the P or S phase arrivals are highly emergent, 
indistinct, or even absent altogether. 
The search for the location and amplitude of the maximum coalescence value in the grid at each 
timestamp, "7 (), is also performed by the core compiled C migration library, and, for the purposes of 
Detect, a normalised maximum coalescence value: 
4"8 () = 	"7 ()		/	
 5%(,6 )
      (2.3) 
is also returned, defined as the instantaneous maximum coalescence value in the grid divided by the 
mean coalescence value across the 3D grid at that timestamp. It is comparatively less sensitive to 
global changes in the coalescence value across the search grid, usually due to changes in station 
availability, or a drop in SNR across the network during the passing of coda waves after large events. 
As described in section 2.3.7, this is useful in maximising the extent to which the Trigger stage can 
by automated, even in challenging scenarios. 
2.3.6 Detect  continuous migration on a decimated grid 
In the Detect stage, the span of possible origin times to be searched is subdivided into timesteps, 
which are processed sequentially. The motivation for this approach is mainly pragmatic, allowing the 
computation of each batch of data to fit within available memory. For each timestep, timeseries of the 
instantaneous (raw and normalised) maximum coalescence value in the grid, and its location, are 
calculated by continuously migrating and stacking the onset functions according to the equations 
described in section 2.3.5. This continuous output is compressed and stored in miniSEED format  
using the functionality provided by ObsPy  making it straightforward for the user to interrogate 
independently, yet efficient in storage use. This also makes the Detect and Trigger stages entirely 
independent and therefore open to customisation, as well as promising the ability to straightforwardly 
extend the capability of QuakeMigrate to operate on near real-time data, though that is not attempted 
here. 
There is a minor trade-off between memory usage  longer timesteps result in a larger 4-D 
coalescence map, and longer waveforms, being stored temporarily in memory  and computation 
time, due to more input/output operations and function overheads. Typically, memory constraints are 
the stronger limitation. As the grid search occurs over a 3D space at each timestamp, the number of 
grid nodes used strongly affects the computational cost, scaling with (nx x ny x nz x t). The classic 
(overlapping) STA/LTA onset function method is typically recommended for use in Detect, or another 
characteristic function which produces similarly broad peaks around phase arrivals. This allows a 
relatively large grid node spacing to be used without missing potential detections. 
In Locate, by contrast, calculating accurate and precise location estimates is the priority, motivating 
the use of the centred onset function and a denser search grid. 
2.3.7 Trigger  identifying a catalogue of candidate events 
Identifying seismic events from continuous migration outputs is a challenging task. The amplitude of 
the maximum coalescence value through time depends on a range of factors, beyond simply the size 
and timing of earthquakes that occur within the search grid. Other influences include changes in 
background noise amplitude or noise source properties, the number of stations with usable data 
during a given timestep, the source properties of earthquakes which occur (their frequency content, 
duration, impulsiveness, and the network geometry with respect to their location) and the inter-event 
time. These factors will differ strongly between networks, and may vary considerably through time for 
any given seismic array. 
To help combat this challenge, multiple timeseries which can be used to help distinguish real 
earthquakes from artefacts are output from Detect. Two built-in trigger algorithms are currently 
available, both of which operate on the (normalised) maximum coalescence timeseries. The user may 
specify a static value for the detection threshold, peaks above which will be identified as candidate 
events, or a dynamic threshold calculated as a multiple of the median absolute deviation (MAD) of 
the timeseries in sequential time windows. The latter is based on the theory of detecting outliers in 
the coalescence amplitude time series, and is therefore able to deal with systematic changes in the 
background coalescence value due to an increase in background noise, or changes in station 
availability. 
A user-specified time increment sets the interval over which the MAD is calculated: if, for example, 
the number of stations operating is known to vary over a timescale of hours (e.g. due to day/night 
power cycles), then a time increment of one hour may be appropriate. However, this setting should 
be chosen with caution when processing data including seismic swarms, which can inadvertently lead 
to the detection threshold being significantly increased exactly when the most intense (and potentially 
most interesting) activity is occurring. In future, consideration of the timeseries recording the position 
of the coalescence peak through time may allow for a further improvements in the ratio of true- to 
false-positive detections, and down to even lower SNR (Bedell, 2020). 
Figure 2.3: Annotated triggered events plot illustrating the process by which candidate earthquakes are 
triggered from the (normalised) maximum coalescence timeseries. Periods where the coalescence value (black 
line) exceeds the detection threshold (green line) are identified as candidate events (green shaded regions), 
with a minimum duration determined by the user-specified Marginal Window (MW). Event windows separated 
by a shorter interval than the specified Minimum Event Interval (MEI), shown by grey shading, are merged, with 
the largest amplitude peak retained as the single candidate event within that period. Red shading indicates the 
marginal window of a merged (rejected) event trigger - note the slowly increasing coalescence value during this 
period, corresponding to the onset function peaks being migrated towards their true source location (and origin 
time), marked as Event 2. The rejected trigger likely corresponds to P-wave arrivals misidentified as S-arrivals 
stacking somewhat coherently at the bottom/edge of the grid, where their apparent slowness approximately 
matches that expected for S-waves originating from that location: the shooting star artefact. Figure by Conor 
Bacon. 
The locations returned with each candidate event also allow the user to choose to only trigger 
events constrained to sub-regions of the detection grid, either for separate analysis in Locate, or to 
exclude artefacts caused by mis-located regional events (with true locations outside the search grid), 
which tend to cluster at the extreme edges of the grid, and can therefore easily be recognised and 
removed. 
There are two further parameters: the Marginal Window (MW) and Minimum Event Interval (MEI). 
The Marginal Window corresponds to the time period over which the 4D coalescence map is 
marginalised (averaged) in the Locate stage; discussed in detail in section 2.3.8. The Minimum Event 
Interval allows the user to specify a minimum separation between consecutive events, which is useful 
to prevent multiple triggers from a single event as the coalescence converges to a maximum (Figure 
2.3). This process is illustrated in Figure 2.3, which is derived from an automatically generated trigger 
summary figure, output alongside the list of event detections. These figures concisely and efficiently 
display the Detect output and Trigger results, and thereby facilitate selection of an appropriate 
detection threshold, triggering method, and MEI for any given dataset. The event detections are listed 
in comma-separated value (.csv) format, with each assigned an EventID and including the time, 
location and raw and normalised coalescence values at the peak. This facilitates inspection and 
analysis by the user, in addition to the automatically provided plots, and again provides a clean 
separation between the different stages of a QuakeMigrate run. 
2.3.8 Locate  migration on a high resolution grid: output refined location and spatial 
uncertainty statistics, plus optional plots and outputs 
The goal of the Locate step is to calculate a more accurate and precise hypocentre for each candidate 
earthquake identified by Trigger, and to provide a robust assessment of the location uncertainty, 
among other outputs. These accompanying statistics may then be used to efficiently and automatically 
distinguish genuine earthquakes from false triggers, allowing the user to both further tune their choice 
of trigger threshold if necessary, and to filter the located events to produce a robust earthquake 
catalogue. 
The migration and stacking process is identical to that used in Detect, though for a much shorter 
timestep (equal to four times the Marginal Window length), making it possible to perform the migration 
on a higher resolution grid while maintaining acceptable memory usage and computation time. As 
outlined in Drew et al. (2013), the resulting coalescence function is here then marginalised (averaged) 
over a time window representative of the origin time uncertainty, in order to provide a complete 
description of the earthquake location uncertainty. The appropriate duration for the Marginal Window 
is tied to the expected event location uncertainty, and to the slowest phase velocity in the vicinity of 
the earthquake source region. However, only an approximate estimate is required, and it is most 
important to encapsulate the entire width of the coalescence peak. 
The resulting 3D map can then be treated as a posterior probability density function (PDF) 
describing the best estimate of the source location and its spatial uncertainty (Figure 2.4). A sub-
gridded estimate for the location of the peak in the PDF is returned from a sub-sampled 3D spline 
function fitted locally to the coalescence map around its maximum. Separately, a 3D Gaussian 
function is also fitted locally, after applying a modest Gaussian smoothing, in order to characterise 
the shape of the peak and a (parameterised) quantitative estimate of the location uncertainty. The 
event origin time, maximum coalescence hypocentre and all additional calculated locations and 
uncertainties are reported in a .event file, also in .csv format, for each successfully located event. 
Summary plots (Figure 2.4) which illustrate the coalescence map alongside a range-ordered 
waveform gather, can also optionally be output for each event, as well as cut event waveforms (for 
use as inputs for location refinement, polarity picking, attenuation tomography, or cross-correlation 
for matched-filter detection and/or calculation of highly accurate differential travel-times, for example). 
By taking advantage of the locate and then pick approach that waveform-based location 
procedures allow (Eaton, 2018), the capability to output phase picks has also been included as an 
option in Locate, making it straightforward to incorporate the results from QuakeMigrate into existing 
research workflows. For example, these picks may be used as inputs for local traveltime or attenuation 
tomography (Reiss et al., 2020), within automatic polarity picking and moment tensor inversion 
routines (e.g. Pugh et al., 2016), for double-difference relocation with HypoDD (Waldhauser and 
Ellsworth, 2000) or to guide the calculation of refined differential traveltimes through waveform cross-
correlation (Chapter 5). 
Figure 2.4: QuakeMigrate event summary plot. Top left reports key statistics describing the event: origin time, 
location, local magnitude and their respective uncertainties. Lower left panels (map view and cross sections) 
display sections through the 3D marginalised coalescence map, providing an unparameterised representation 
of the posterior probability density function (PDF) describing the event location uncertainty; white dashed lines 
indicate the (interpolated) maximum probability location, and the sections displayed in each plot. Black ellipse 
illustrates an estimation of the event uncertainty attained by locally fitting a Gaussian function to the 3D 
coalescence map. Right panel shows a waveform gather, displaying pre-processed waveforms from each 
station, overlain by modelled phase arrival times (red and blue vertical lines) calculated from the maximum 
probability hypocentre and according to the LUT. Bottom right shows the maximum coalescence value over the 
duration of the Marginal Window, illustrating the constraint on the event origin time. Data from the 2014 
Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion, described in the Volcanotectonic_Iceland example available on GitHub3. 
The default picking algorithm uses a Gaussian fit to the onset function, providing a measure of the 
pick SNR and timing uncertainty (see section 2.3.4). Picks are made when the onset function exceeds 
a user-defined threshold within windows around the expected P and S phase arrivals, respectively 
(Figure 2.5). This module is also implemented as a plug-in, so may be replaced with an alternative 
auto-picker of the users choice, operating on either the onset functions, raw, or filtered waveforms. 
Figure 2.5: QuakeMigrate pick summary plot. Top left reports pick times and related statistics. Upper and middle 
panels show pre-processed waveform data (on the vertical and horizontal components at the left and right, 
respectively), and bottom panels show onset functions computed from them. Red and blue shading indicate the 
picking windows, within which a Gaussian function (blue curve) is fitted to the maximum amplitude peak in the 
onset function, if it exceeds the user-defined, adaptive threshold (blue horizontal line). Vertical red and blue 
lines indicate the time of the P and S phase picks, respectively, and dashed lines one-sigma uncertainty. Data 
from the same event as displayed in Figure 2.4, described in the Volcanotectonic_Iceland example on GitHub3. 
Similarly to Trigger, two methods are available to calculate the pick threshold. Both are calculated 
from the amplitude of the onset function outside both the P and S picking windows (Figure 2.5) to 
avoid the influence of peaks from expected phase arrivals. The preferred method calculates the 
threshold from a user-specified multiple of the median absolute deviation of the onset function, which 
effectively accounts for the background noise level without being unduly affected by phase arrivals 
from closely-spaced events. Alternatively, the user may specify a percentile of the onset function 
cumulative distribution function, which may be more suitable for their dataset. 
From a pragmatic standpoint, these picks may also be used for location refinement using software 
such as NonLinLoc, where the accurate pick uncertainty measurements can be utilised within a 
Bayesian framework accounting for velocity model uncertainties and distance weighting of 
observations (Lomax et al., 2000). This may help where the user is unable to calculate waveform-
based locations on a high-resolution grid due to computational constraints, or where a highly sub-
optimal station distribution necessitates careful distance weighting to obtain accurate hypocentre 
depths (e.g. Tarasewicz et al., 2011). The power of the migration method can still be exploited for 
efficient, robust and pick-free phase association and automatic distinction between real events and 
artefacts. Built-in functions are currently available (within the export sub-module) to output picks in 
NonLinLoc, MFAST, Snuffler or ObsPy format; for location refinement, inputs for shear-wave splitting 
analysis, as guides for manual phase picking, or for otherwise further analysis, respectively. 
2.4 Example use case: basal icequakes at the Rutford Ice Stream, 
Antarctica 
The performance and flexibility of QuakeMigrate is demonstrated here by applying it to process data 
from the Rutford Ice Stream, Antarctica. Data and scripts (in the form of fully-commented Jupyter 
Notebooks) to run short samples of this and other example datasets can be accessed through the 
QuakeMigrate GitHub repository3, and run without local installation on remotely hosted Jupyter 
Notebooks4 through a browser, using functionality provided by the Binder service (Jupyter et al., 
2018). N. B. Icequake examples were originally devised by Tom Hudson, who also selected the key 
run parameters, and whose description of the seismicity I have summarised in the following two 
paragraphs; see Hudson et al., 2019, for a full discussion. 
Icequakes, a broad class of seismic events associated with the movement or fracture of ice, can 
provide important insights into the dynamics of glacier flow and deformation. This example has been 
chosen to illustrate the performance of QuakeMigrate because it provides a relatively simple test 
case, with the velocity structure being well-approximated by a homogeneous model, the icequakes 
exhibiting high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) phase arrivals, and their cause being well-understood 
(Smith et al., 2015; Hudson et al., 2019). They are generated by a mechanism generally referred to 
as basal stick-slip; associated with the sliding of the ice stream over the underlying till or bedrock 
(Winberry et al., 2009). This leads to them occurring predominantly within 10s of metres of the ice-
bed interface, here in distinct spatial clusters (Smith et al., 2015; Hudson et al., 2019). The location 
performance can thus be visualised straightforwardly, by comparing the automatically generated 
QuakeMigrate hypocentres with their expected distribution: particularly in depth. 
The critical parameter choices for icequake detection are the bandpass filter frequencies, and the 
window lengths used to calculate onset functions using the STA/LTA algorithm. The P-wave bandpass 
filter is set at 20-200 Hz; icequakes in this region typically have peak P-wave frequencies of 
approximately 130 Hz (Smith et al., 2015). The P-wave short-term window length is set at 0.01 s, 
which is 1.3 times the dominant period of the signal, as it was found to produce high signal-to-noise 
ratios, likely due to the simple, impulsive nature of P and S phase arrivals typically observed in 
Antarctic icequakes. The long-term window is set to 0.25 s, adequate for capturing the background 
noise amplitude, but short enough not to overly smear the onset peak associated with the extremely 
sharp phase arrivals. The S-wave filter and windows are set at 10-150 Hz and 0.05 s and 0.5 s, 
corresponding to their lower frequencies and longer durations. The traveltime lookup table used in 
this example is computed for a homogeneous velocity model, with vP=3841 ms-1 and vS=1970 ms-1, 
as in Smith et al. (2015).

Figure 2.6: QuakeMigrate Trigger summary plot for 10 minutes of icequake data on 20th January 2009. Top left 
text lists the values of the parameters used for Trigger, and specifies the number of events detected. Bottom 
left panels show locations of triggered events (dots, coloured by normalised coalescence value) in map and 
cross section views, and locations of stations (black annotated triangles). Right panels show, from top to bottom, 
timeseries of raw and normalised coalescence values (black lines), and the number of stations available to 
calculate onset functions for each timestep (reported by Detect). Coalescence value panels also display the 
trigger threshold (set here at a normalised coalescence value of 2.0), and the timing of triggered events; note 
merged triggers at ~ 00:01:40. No coalescence values were reported for the first timestep, because the data 
used here starts for all stations at exactly midnight, not allowing for the pre-pad window necessary for tapering 
and onset function calculation. Note the step down in the raw coalescence value at around 00:04:15, caused 
by a station malfunction not noticed in QC, and successfully mitigated in the normalised coalescence timeseries. 
For Detect, it is necessary to use a relatively dense node spacing of 100 m in order to successfully 
capture the sharp coalescence peaks produced by the extremely impulsive, high frequency phase 
arrivals produced by these icequakes, even using the overlapping STA/LTA algorithm: experiments 
using 200 m node spacing resulted in significantly fewer detections. However, the continuous scan is 
instead decimated by performing the migration at 500 Hz  half the data sampling rate  resulting in 
an approximately factor of 2 speedup. A static trigger threshold is used due to the stability of the 
network and seismicity rate over the short two-day time period, making it straightforward to manually 
select an optimal value. As displayed in the sample time period in Figure 2.6, this produced a set of 
triggered events tightly clustered about the ice-bed interface (at approximately 1.8 km depth), with 
very few scattered points, and without any events clearly above the background noise level being 
missed. This demonstrates the usefulness of the trigger summary plots in fine-tuning the Trigger 
parameters, here inspected in 1-hour time windows throughout the 48 hour run period before running 
Locate. In total, more than 57,000 candidate events were detected, in line with the 144 events 
detected in the 10 minute period displayed in Figure 2.6. 
 dfdfg 
Figure 2.7: QuakeMigrate event summary plot for a representative icequake. Panels are as described in Figure 
2.4. Note the extremely impulsive, high-frequency phase arrivals (particularly the P wave), and the exceptionally 
sharp peak in the coalescence function, constraining the event depth at 1.86 km: precisely at the ice-bed 
interface. 
Figure 2.8: QuakeMigrate pick summary plot for the same icequake as displayed in Figure 2.7. Panels are as 
described in Figure 2.5. Note the extremely sharp P-wave onset function peak, corresponding to the highly 
impulsive P-wave arrival. The lower left panel also clearly demonstrates the benefit of the locate and then pick 
approach; a similar pick threshold applied to continuous data would likely lead to numerous mis-picks even 
within this ~ 2.5 second time window. These significantly different-looking signals, seen only on the vertical 
component, are likely caused by surface crevassing. 
Two filters are used to decipher between real events and false triggers in the preliminary catalogue 
of 57,556 events. Both have clear physical meanings, which is important to be able to understand the 
effects of applying them. Firstly, a coalescence filter is used, only selecting events with a normalised 
coalescence value of greater than 4.0. This acts to remove noise that may appear on a single station, 
but not on the majority of stations in the network. It also acts to remove events focussed directly below 
the two sub arrays of instruments, which we are confident  from inspection of a sample of the event 
summary plots  are artefacts. It is worth noting that this value is higher than that recommended  for 
most other environments, but is appropriate here due to the exceptionally high SNRs of the icequake 
phase arrivals, and consequent coalescence values (Figures 2.7 and 2.8). 
Figure 2.9: Icequakes detected at the Rutford Ice Stream, Antarctica, from 20-21 January 2009. Scatter points 
represent 13,847 icequake hypocentres, coloured by the reported Gaussian location uncertainty in depth. The 
ice surface and ice-bed interfaces are indicated by the blue and grey lines, respectively. Blue diamonds show 
the locations of seismic stations. Further details on this dataset can be found in Hudson et al. (2019). Figure by 
Tom Hudson. 
A second filter is applied based on the global covariance statistic reported by Locate. This value is 
measured as the covariance in the marginalised coalescence map after removing values below the 
90th percentile, and is designed to characterise the profile of the 3D coalescence peak. Real events 
typically stand out from the background as sharp peaks (Figures 2.4 and 2.7), while artefacts of 
various forms generally exhibit much more flat-topped or gently sloping maxima. A representative 
value over all three spatial dimensions is calculated as the geometric mean, which (as discussed in 
section 2.3.4) provides a good representation of the coherence, as well as the average magnitude 
of the three values. Events with a mean global covariance value of greater than 500 m are removed, 
with this filter value selected based on statistical analysis of a representative subset of manually 
labelled events (the procedure for which is described in detail in Chapter 3). In this case, conservative 
values have been selected, in order to more clearly highlight the location performance of 
QuakeMigrate for the best located events; based on the statistical analysis, the expected proportion 
of true positives is more than 99%, with a false negative rate of approximately 50%. Nevertheless, 
13,847 events remain in the catalogue, over a period of just two days. 
The locations in this resulting catalogue are displayed in Figure 2.9, and clearly demonstrate the 
capability of QuakeMigrate at detecting icequakes, and in efficiently producing a clean catalogue of 
seismicity with few false triggers. The total of 13,847 events over just two days corresponds to 
approximately a factor of 10 increase in event detections over the same period analysed by Smith et 
al. (2015), using the CMM algorithm (Drew et al. 2013). Clear spatial clustering of seismicity is evident, 
both laterally  indicating sticky spots at the bed (Smith et al. 2015)  and tightly about the ice-bed 
interface, as expected from the basal stick-slip mechanism (Hudson et al., 2019). 
This order of magnitude increase in event detections was facilitated in large part by the separation 
of the process of running QuakeMigrate into three distinct stages. This allows for straightforward 
identification of a short, representative period of data on which to efficiently experiment, refine and 
test both onset function parameters and grid decimations, in order to make an informed choice of 
settings. This is particularly important in temporary icequake studies, where important factors such as 
the source frequencies and attenuation properties of the medium are often poorly known, and which 
would otherwise be both challenging and potentially extremely time consuming to explore. For 
example, icequakes detected at the base of the Skeiarrjkull outlet glacier, Iceland, have 
significantly different characteristics than those presented here, and required significant effort to 
detect and characterise successfully (Hudson, 2019; Hudson et al., 2019). The comprehensive set of 
statistics output by QuakeMigrate alongside each earthquake location is also pivotal. This applies in 
particular to the global covariance statistic, which is in many ways unique in being explicitly designed 
to distinguish real events from artefacts, rather than attempting to describe the location quality under 
the implicit a priori assumption that the statistical measure in question is describing a real event. Its 
use allows the coalescence value filter threshold to be reduced while still maintaining an exceptionally 
high level of true- to false-positive detections. For further discussion of considerations and challenges 
in detecting and locating basal icequakes using QuakeMigrate, the reader is referred to Hudson et al. 
(2019). 
2.5 Extensibility: local magnitude calculation 
Further benefits can be gained from waveform-based location algorithms if we capitalise on the 
opportunity presented by having the event waveforms in memory at the time the location is calculated, 
beyond just making phase picks. As a clear example, it significantly improves the efficiency of the 
routine calculation of local earthquake magnitudes if they are estimated at this time, rather than 
reading, cutting and processing the waveforms in a secondary step. This is the first extension module 
added to QuakeMigrate (Figure 2.1). It follows the approach to calculate local magnitudes outlined by 
Keir et al. (2006), and provides the means to produce all of the fundamental components of an 
earthquake catalogue within a single processing step in Locate. 
Furthermore, the outputs can be used as an additional, extremely efficient filter to distinguish real 
events from artefacts. We calculate the fit of the observed amplitudes with distance to their predicted 
values based on the estimated event magnitude and chosen attenuation function, by means of the r2 
statistic (where r is the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient; Figure 2.10). The appropriate 
filter cut-off will vary between networks and event types, but provides another metric specifically 
designed to distinguish real events from artefacts. This extension also introduces the capability to 
output instrument-corrected velocity or displacement waveforms for each event, which may be used 
for more detailed spectral analysis, amongst other further processing steps. 
Figure 2.10: QuakeMigrate amplitude vs distance plot for the event displayed in Figure 2.4. In the case of this 
real event, measured S-wave amplitudes closely follow the curve expected from combining the network-
averaged estimate of the event magnitude with the applied attenuation curve (from Greenfield et al., 2020). This 
can be quantified by the r2 statistic, here reported as 0.55. 
2.6 Conclusions 
1. QuakeMigrate provides a powerful and efficient method for building an earthquake catalogue 
from continuous seismic data. It is distributed as a cross-platform, open-source Python 
package, making it widely available for application to increasingly large quantities of 
continuous waveform data collected by dense local seismic networks. 
2. Migration-based approaches to seismic event detection and location promise significant 
advantages in robustness to noise, detection capability amongst rapidly occurring swarms of 
microearthquakes, and in the ability to detect events with phase arrivals close to or below the 
signal-to-noise ratio at individual stations. However, computational cost remains a challenge. 
Here, through explicitly separating the detection, triggering and location steps, significant 
improvements are made in both the efficiency and adaptability of the method. 
3. The software is designed with a modular architecture, providing transparency to the user, and 
the flexibility to adapt to the specific requirements and challenges of individual datasets. This 
also provides the exciting opportunity to rapidly create and rigorously compare and benchmark 
new approaches and techniques within a robust framework. For example, the plug-in nature 
of the Onset module allows direct benchmarking of existing algorithms, as well as the prospect 
of harnessing new approaches. This includes using the potential to use the continuous output 
from machine-learning algorithms for phase arrival detection (e.g. Ross et al., 2018; Lapins et 
al., 2021). 
4. Locate outputs a suite of statistics alongside each event location. These include two metrics 
that are, uniquely, explicitly designed to distinguish real events from artefacts, as opposed to 
describing detections under the implicit assumption that they are true earthquakes. This 
promises a significant improvement in the capability to quality-control a preliminary catalogue. 
5. The performance of QuakeMigrate is demonstrated with application to an example dataset 
from the Rutford Ice Stream, Antarctica, with more than an order of magnitude more events 
detected than by previous authors. The locations attained are tightly constrained about the 
ice-bed interface, corresponding to the expected distribution from basal stick-slip seismicity. 
6. The further opportunities to capitalise on the architecture of the software are highlighted by 
the Local Magnitudes extension module, which allows the user to efficiently output all 
fundamental components of an earthquake catalogue within a single processing step. We 
hope this will be embraced by the seismological community and lead to continued open-source 
and collaborative advances in the field of earthquake detection and location. 
Chapter 3 
A unified catalogue of seismicity in the Askja 
region from 2007-2020 
In this Chapter I apply QuakeMigrate to detect and locate microseismicity in the Northern Volcanic 
Zone around Askja volcano from 2007-2020. The superior detection capability of QuakeMigrate, 
particularly in challenging scenarios such as the very high event rates during earthquake swarms, 
due to the occurrence of intense seismicity outside the study area (for example during the 2014 
Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion), and caused by significant fluctuations in the number of 
recording stations, allow me to significantly improve the completeness of the catalogue compared to 
previous efforts. Furthermore, using the statistics output with each earthquake location, I am able to 
objectively select a method by which to filter the raw catalogue, and to measure its performance. This 
results in a catalogue which contains both a significantly larger quantity of real events, down to a 
lower magnitude of completeness, but also very few artefacts, and which is more consistent over its 
13 year extent. 
This earthquake catalogue forms the foundation for the automatic relocation workflow described in 
Chapter 5, the results of which are analysed and interpreted in the following Chapters of this 
dissertation. However, it is worth noting that here I analyse only a small subset of the interesting 
features revealed by the seismicity  some now seen in new detail, and others identified for the first 
time. This presents a wide variety of exciting opportunities for further research. 
3.1  Data collection and processing 
Here I describe the acquisition and processing of the passive seismic data from which I have built an 
earthquake catalogue using QuakeMigrate. Since 2017, I have been responsible for planning and 
leading fieldwork expeditions to the Icelandic Highlands, and processing the data collected. Full 
details are available in field reports archived with SEIS-UK; herein I briefly describe the aims of the 
deployment, how it has evolved since it began in 2007, and the procedures used and challenges 
faced in collecting high quality seismic data in the harsh environment of the interior of Iceland. 
3.1.1 Network configuration through time 
The local seismic network operated by the Cambridge Volcano Seismology research group was 
initially focused on the region around the Askja central volcano (Figure 3.1). Trial deployments in the 
summers of 2005 and 2006 identified persistent upper-crustal seismicity, particularly between Askja 
and Mt. Herubrei, as well as clusters of deep earthquakes in the normally ductile mid-lower crust 
(Soosalu et al., 2010). An expanded network was deployed in summer 2007, co-incident with a new, 
intense episode of lower-crustal seismicity marking a dike intrusion beneath Mt. Upptyppingar 
(Jakobsdttir et al., 2008; White et al., 2011; Martens and White, 2013; Figure 3.1). A limited network 
of 5 sensors was left operating over the winter for the first time, as the dike intrusion continued, and 
expanded again in summer 2008. Instruments have continued to operate year-round since this date, 
generally increasing in number with the service trips each summer (see Appendix A for yearly maps). 
Several more specific aims have led to modifications and expansion of the seismic network 
configuration over this period. In 2012, a significant number of seismometers were added to the Askja 
network, with the primary objective being to perform a high-resolution local earthquake tomography 
study of Askja volcano (Greenfield et al., 2016). In 2013-14, additional stations were installed further 
south as part of the FUTUREVOLC project, in order to provide improved ray coverage for ambient 
noise tomography across Iceland (Green et al., 2017; Volk et al., 2021). This was perfectly timed to 
record the 2014 Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion in exceptional detail, with excellent azimuthal 
coverage as well as a wealth of closely spaced stations around the eventual eruption site at Holuhraun 
(gstsdttir et al., 2016, 2019; Woods et al., 2019; Figure 3.1). The high density of stations in the 
Askja-Herubrei region also provided excellent coverage of the surge in seismicity observed there 
as the dike intruded (Figures A.19-20), analysed in detail in Chapter 8. 
Network coverage remained consistent until 2016, when more than 30 instruments loaned from 
SEIS-UK were returned to the UK (Figure 3.2; Appendix A). 26 stations were left operating, but now 
spread over an area extending over 100 km from Herubrei southeast to Brarbunga, with several 
stations in the Askja region left with 4GB instruments, which do not have sufficient memory capacity 
to record year-round (Figure 3.2). In 2017, a new loan allowed us to deploy 11 new 16GB instruments, 
of which 6 were used to replace 4GB sensors, and 5 to install new stations. Two new sites were 
placed northeast of Herubrei, to improve azimuthal coverage for earthquake swarms in the north 
of my study region, one site to the southeast was re-occupied, and two further stations were deployed 
at new sites between Askja and Brarbunga. Previously, two service trips had been carried out each 
summer, making it possible to record at 100 Hz on 16GB instruments, which would otherwise fill up 
their memory after ~ 10 months of recording. The decision was made to instead record at 50 Hz from 
2017 onwards, allowing us to visit only once each summer. 
In summer 2018 two new stations were deployed southwest of Brarbunga and close to 
Holuhraun, and another reoccupying a site at Kverkfjll, with the network in the Askja region left 
unchanged. In 2019 the final remaining station south of Vatnajkull was decommissioned, and several 
new stations were deployed. A site west of Askja was re-occupied, and two new stations were

installed in the centre of the study region just east of Askja (Figure 3.1). These made use of spare 
power infrastructure and 4GB instruments that would otherwise go unused, and were set to record on 
the vertical channel only at 50 Hz, such that they could record for the full year. These were fortuitously 
placed for the large earthquake swarm which occurred directly between them in November 2019. In 
August 2020, the network around Askja was again left largely unchanged, while three new stations 
were installed close to Brarbunga. 
Throughout the study period, the Cambridge network has been supplemented with data from the 
Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO)s permanent network (Figure 3.1), including stations originally 
deployed by the British Geological Survey and University College Dublin. IMO have operated digital 
seismic stations in the study region since 1995, though they mostly recorded only triggered event 
waveforms until around 2010, rather than continuous data. 
3.1.2 Instrumentation & station setup 
Most instruments operated by the University of Cambridge volcano seismology group are provided 
by SEIS-UK, with a subset owned by the research group. SEIS-UK also provide software, service 
equipment and invaluable expertise and support both in the field and while processing data back in 
Cambridge. 
In all of the automatic analysis I conduct in this dissertation, data is high-pass filtered at 2 Hz; well 
above the corner frequency of the shortest period sensors in either the Cambridge or IMO networks. 
Manual analysis of microearthquakes conducted by previous authors, but used in this study, involved 
inspecting unfiltered data, but the impulsive, high-frequency phase arrivals from the shallow events 
considered here are recorded clearly on all instrument types. For completeness, the sensors used in 
the Cambridge network are described briefly below - all are deployed with GPS for accurate timing. 
Gralp 6TD 
The bulk of the network has comprised Gralp 6TD seismometers throughout 2007-2020. These are 
three-component, broadband sensors with a corner frequency of 30 seconds, a rugged design, and 
low power consumption of around 1 W. Their relatively high internal noise levels and tilt tolerance 
make them suitable for deployment by direct burial, without significant degradation of the recorded 
data. This deployment method provides exceptional coupling during the winter months, when the 
ground freezes around the instruments. Most of the 6TDs deployed around Askja have been 16GB 
models, but in 2007-2008 the network was mostly 4GB instruments, and these have continued to be 
used to supplement the network. All 16GB instruments were set to record at 100 Hz until 2017, since 
when they have recorded at 50 Hz. 4GB instruments recorded data at 100 Hz when deployed for 
short periods between summer services in 2012-16, and at either 40 or 50 Hz when left over the 
winter. Winter 2007-08 stations each had two 4GB sensors, both recording at 40 Hz, but with opposite 
memory buffer settings such that continuous data could be recorded over the whole time period (see 
Figure 3.1 caption). 
Gralp 3ESPCD 
Gralp 3ESPCD sensors are sensitive to 60 seconds period, and have lower internal noise levels 
than the 6TD. However, they are more sensitive to tilt, so in order to accommodate this these 
instruments are deployed in vaults. They all have an internal memory capacity of 16GB. 
Gralp 3T 
A small subset of Gralp 3Ts and 3TDs were deployed as part of the project to image the velocity 
structure beneath Vatnajkull using ambient noise tomography, which benefits from their extremely 
low 120 s corner frequency. However, generally the data were found to be limited by power gaps  
influenced by their high power consumption  and/or excessive tilt, despite them also being deployed 
in vaults or structures with concrete floors. 
3.1.3 Data processing 
Data were downloaded from the Cambridge instruments in Gralp compressed format (gcf) and 
converted to miniSEED using the SEIS-UK-provided scripts. State-of-health streams were also 
extracted in the field to allow for diagnosis of data gaps and quality-checking of GPS timing and tilt. 
A dataless response inventory was assembled using the SEIS-UK response files and scripts, and 
stored in both dataless SEED and STATIONXML format. They are used for instrument response 
removal when calculating event magnitudes (section 3.2.5) and before event data are cross-
correlated (Chapter 5). 
Data from the Icelandic Met Office were delivered in various formats; between 2007-2016 they 
were sent in a proprietary binary compressed (BC) format, which was then converted to miniSEED 
using a provided purpose-built program. Originally, this conversion was implemented such that data 
gaps would be filled with constant values (equal to the average value of the previous period of data 
recorded that day). However, though potentially not an issue for studies which use highly decimated 
long-period data, or 1-bit normalisation before cross-correlation, this is unsuitable for automatic 
processing for microseismic analysis, due to the sharp offsets at the start and end of data gaps. To 
remedy this, I re-extracted the IMO data from this period from the raw BC files with a modified set of 
scripts, to ensure that data gaps were recorded as such (allowing them to be filled later if required by 
any particular analysis workflow). Data sent since 2016 was requested in miniSEED or gcf format, 
such that it could be processed in the same manner as the Cambridge data. All IMO data are recorded 
at 100 Hz. 
Improvements in sensor design, memory capacity and firmware, and improvements to the power 
infrastructure deployed at each station, have led to a gradual increase in data recovery over the life 
of the network, in recent years often approaching 95%.  
3.2  Earthquake detection and location using QuakeMigrate 
As described in Chapter 2, QuakeMigrate has been designed to make the process of detecting 
earthquakes from continuous seismic data as automated as possible, while delivering an 
exceptionally complete and robust catalogue. I will describe the process as I applied it to my study 
region around Askja, the parameters used, and reasons for selecting them. There are just four inputs: 
the continuous seismic data, collected and processed as outlined in section 3.1; a list of station 
coordinates; an instrument response inventory (for calculating earthquake magnitudes); and a velocity 
model. 
3.2.1 Velocity model 
Following Greenfield et al. (2020), I use a 1D gradient velocity model derived from the 3D local body-
wave tomography model of the Askja region from Greenfield et al. (2016) (Appendix B). It is calculated 
from horizontal averages of the P and S wave speeds in the 3D model, respectively, which are 
inverted for together in the 3D tomographic inversion. The final 1D model is similar to 1D models 
calculated by Mitchell et al. (2013) from 1D inversion of phase arrival data, derived from refraction 
profiles shot across lines to the north and south of the study region by Martens and White (2013), and 
Key et al. (2011a,b), and that used for the whole of Iceland by the IMO. 
3.2.2 Lookup table 
The key consideration when calculating the lookup table (LUT) is the choice of search grid: both its 
extent and the node spacing. After experimenting on several representative portions of the dataset, I 
selected a grid which was then used consistently throughout. It was chosen based on the seismicity 
catalogue of the IMO, as well as those of Greenfield et al. (2020) and Martens and White (2013), such 
that it encompassed all of the known seismicity in the Askja region. The southern boundary of the grid 
was placed in an area of little seismicity south of Askja and north of the tip of the Brarbunga-
Holuhraun dike intrusion (Figures 1.4 & 3.1).

Table 3.1: Grid projection parameters used to generate the travel-time lookup table for the Askja region. 
A 10 km pad is included at all sides of the search volume, to allow events outside the region of 
interest to coalesce at the edges of the grid, making them straightforward to remove (sections 3.2.3 
and 3.3). The LUT was calculated on a grid with node spacing of 2 km in all three dimensions for 
Detect, and 1 km for Locate, using the finite difference scheme of Podvin and Lecomte (1991), 
provided in the NonLinLoc program Grid2Time, and wrapped in the QuakeMigrate LUT functions 
(section 2.3.2). A full list of parameters is provided in Table 3.1. 
The stations used were varied to reflect changes in the network configuration over time, meaning 
the data were generally processed in year-long batches (Appendix A). During 2012-16, when the 
network density was significantly biased towards Askja and Holuhraun (Figure 3.1; A.15-23), not all 
available stations were used for Detect (section 3.2.3). This was to help prevent the detections being 
biased against areas with lower station density. Stations with the most continuous data recording in 
each time period were favoured, or alternatively those which generally showed higher signal to noise 
ratios. Stations which would not be useful while intense seismicity was occurring along the 2014 dike 
path and while seismic tremor was being generated by the eruption vents at Holuhraun  both 
generally masking arrivals from earthquakes around Askja  were also not used for Detect during 
2014-15. However, all available stations were used to calculate the LUTs used for Locate. 
3.2.3 Detect 
In the Detect stage of a QuakeMigrate run, onset functions are continuously migrated into the 
subsurface search grid, outputting a timeseries of the maximum (normalised) coalescence value in 
the grid at each timestamp. As well as the LUT and continuous seismic data, it requires several 
parameters specifying the onset function algorithm. Again based on experimentation with several 
representative periods of data, and the characteristics of previously detected seismicity, a set of 
parameters were selected and used consistently throughout 2007-2020 (Table 3.2).

Table 3.2: Onset function parameters used for Detect. Filter describes a zero-phase Butterworth bandpass filter 
(highpass, lowpass and number of filter corners). The window lengths are those used for the (overlapping) short-
term average to long-term average ratio algorithm, which is used to calculate the onset functions. 
The scan was run at a sampling rate of 50 Hz, and accordingly the onset functions were also 
calculated at this sampling interval. Where data were recorded at 40 or 100 Hz, they were resampled 
and/or decimated before the STA/LTA algorithm was applied, using the functionality included in 
QuakeMigrate. The classic overlapping STA/LTA onset function produces a relatively smoothed 
approximation to the phase arrival probability density function (PDF), thus allowing a more decimated 
grid to be used without affecting coalescence. A 2 km node spacing, representing a decimation factor 
of 2 in each dimension compared to the LUT used for Locate (and leading to an 8-fold reduction in 
node count) was found to provide a considerable speed-up without affecting detection performance. 
The timestep (the batch length used internally in performing the continuous scan) was set to 300 
seconds, which fit comfortably in memory and provided a good trade-off between computational 
efficiency and accommodating stations which were coming on and off-line over short time periods  
for example due to transmission gaps in the IMO data (see section 3.2.4). Only data which were 
continuous throughout a timestep  including the pre-and post-pad required for migration to the 
extremes of the lookup table, STA/LTA calculation, tapering and filtering  were used. This resulted 
in most of the IMO event-only waveform data from 2007-2010 being discarded. However, given the 
sensitivity of the STA/LTA algorithm to the type of sharp amplitude offsets produced by filtering data 
which arent sufficiently tapered, and the wide variety of reasons for gaps in the Askja dataset, a strict 
approach was taken in this instance. The capability to adaptively deal with these types of data would 
be a useful future improvement to the software. I note here that Detect was run for July 2007-2019 
on a development version of the code (archived on GitHub1), such that both P and S onset functions 
were only calculated where continuous waveforms were available for all three components, instead 
of assessing the availability of data required for each phase individually. This feature was added 
before processing the 2019-20 data, which included Z-only data from two important stations. 
The data were processed in single-day jobs, each using 4 cores on the Bullard Laboratories 
computing cluster. In this configuration, the scan ran at approximately 15-20 times real time, and 
using half of the cluster (currently 176 cores) it therefore took less than 2 weeks to process the 13 
years of data. 
3.2.4 Trigger 
The Trigger stage of QuakeMigrate identifies candidate earthquakes from the continuous timeseries 
output by Detect. As well as the coalescence timeseries, Detect also outputs the location of the 
coalescence peak in the grid at each timestamp. Considering this additional information promises to 
further build on the power of the coalescence value in distinguishing candidate earthquakes from 
noise (Bedell, 2020), but is not used here. The coalescence value can be thought of as a network-
averaged signal to noise ratio, calculated by combining the migrated onset functions from each station 
using the geometric mean as the stacking operator. It thus reaches high values where coherent phase 
arrivals are detected at several stations. However, intuitively, its sensitivity to outliers increases when 
fewer onset functions are available, lessening its power to distinguish well-located earthquakes from 
those too small to be localised, regional events, and random noise. This is somewhat improved by 
considering the normalised coalescence timeseries, where the peak value is normalised by the 
1 https://github.com/TomWinder/QuakeMigrate/tree/iceland_detect_Jul-Nov2020  
average value across the search grid at that timestep. This also helps to dynamically distinguish well-
located events  effectively measuring how well they stand out from concurrent noise or otherwise 
peaks in the onset functions which do not pertain to coherent sources located within the search grid. 
Figure 3.2: Number of stations operational each day (output by Detect) and median ratio trigger threshold 
coefficient. Filled areas show the number of stations which recorded continuously on each day, and the 
minimum, median and maximum number of stations available for each 5 minute timestep. Periods where the 
IMO network suffered heavily from transmission dropouts (notably between 2012-2015) are highlighted by large 
differences between the minimum and median number of stations available (thick green bars). Service trips are 
highlighted by short dips in the number of stations operating continuously (generally in July-August each year). 
The user-specified median ratio coefficient for each day is plotted in purple. There is a strong inverse 
correspondence between the number of stations operating and the appropriate value for the trigger threshold. 
The significant changes to the number of stations available over the 13 year timespan, between 
the summer and winter months each year, and even on a daily basis when stations were struggling 
for solar power, therefore provided a challenge in attempting to automate the identification of 
candidate earthquakes while maintaining an optimal trigger threshold (Figure 3.2). In response to this, 
I developed a third variation of the trigger threshold algorithm, the median ratio trigger, as well as 
applying a 0.2 s standard deviation Gaussian smoothing to the coalescence timeseries before 
searching for triggered events. This smoothing preserves the longer duration peaks in the 
coalescence value timeseries surrounding the true origin time of real events, while strongly 
suppressing spikes caused by short-lived stochastic coherent stacking of random noise. These new 
features will be included in QuakeMigrate v1.1.0. 
Figure 3.3: Trigger summary plots illustrating the effect of significant network dropouts on the coalescence 
timeseries. The median ratio algorithm is able to withstand short-term (hours: a, or seconds-minutes: b) ~ 50% 
network dropouts without generating a significant number of false triggers. For a full description of the plot see 
Figure 2.6. 
The median ratio algorithm sets the trigger threshold as a user-defined multiple of the median 
value of the coalescence trace, measured in set length, non-overlapping time intervals. This allows it 
to respond to changes in the background coalescence value in the grid, most often caused by stations 
coming on- or off-line, without significantly raising the trigger threshold during intense earthquake 
swarms, which the median absolute deviation dynamic trigger algorithm (described in section 2.3.7) 
is prone to do. Most Cambridge-operated stations, which record locally, switch on and off over 
relatively long time periods of hours or days, most often due to power outages, and usually 
uncorrelated across the network. In contrast, the IMO network telemeters data live, and so is subject 
to outages in telemetry that can lead to several stations going offline at the same time. In order to 
cope with this, the interval over which the median was calculated was set to 300 seconds, aligned 
with the timesteps used in Detect. This allows the trigger threshold to adapt to sharp changes in the 
number of available stations, enabling a low and appropriate threshold to be maintained even in these 
challenging circumstances, without the user having to manually intervene (Figure 3.3). The Marginal 
Window was set to 1 second (see section 3.2.5) and the Minimum Event Interval to the lowest possible 
value of 2 seconds, increasing the susceptibility to multiple triggers from the same event, but allowing 
the maximum possible number of closely spaced events to be detected during intense swarms. 
These solutions were found to be sufficient to maintain an optimal trigger threshold with variations 
of roughly -30% to +50% of the mean number of stations operating. However, in periods where fewer 
stations were available (for example in Winter 2007-2008, Figure 3.2), the user-specified multiple 
applied to calculate the threshold required adjustment. Time periods which would require a higher 
threshold were identified from the station availability plots, and fine-tuning of the threshold choice was 
greatly assisted by the automatically generated trigger summary plots (Figure 3.3). This inspection 
also revealed several shorter time periods where the background coalescence value was affected by 
the passage of storms  which can produce impulsive noise across the seismic network  sometimes 
benefitting from short-term adjustments to the trigger threshold (sharp peaks in Figure 3.2). The 
network was generally more vulnerable to this when it consisted of fewer stations. 
In order to cope with the large number of earthquakes which occurred in the region surrounding, 
but outside, the study area, a regional filter was used when triggering candidate events (Figure 3.3). 
Earthquakes close or large enough to generate clear phase arrivals on the seismic network around 
Askja can produce large peaks in the onset functions, and though the true hypocentre is not inside 
the search grid will still generally lead to coalescence peaks upon migration. The most dramatic 
example of this was during the 2014 Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion, where up to 4,000 events 
were detected each day during its 14-day-long propagation, only 10-50 km southeast of the study 
area. Other examples include earthquake swarms in the Tjrnes fracture zone (approximately 100 
km to the NNW; Figure 1.4) in 2012, 2013, 2017-18 and 2020 (Figure 3.4), during the eruption of 
Grmsvtn in May 2011, and most recently associated with earthquake swarms in the Reykjanes 
Peninsula from December to August 2020 (Figures 1.4 & 1.5). 
As these peaks dont represent the true source locations, and instead correspond to the coherent 
stacking of a single set of phase arrivals (most commonly P waves detected on the horizontal 
seismograms, and therefore misidentified as S), they are broad, and generally occur at the edge of 
the grid in the direction of the true source (Figure 3.4). This is accentuated by triggering on the 
normalised coalescence trace, which down-weights broad spatial peaks in the coalescence function 
as they are migrated further into the search grid, helping distinguish them both in amplitude and 
location. In all cases the regional filter removed the vast majority of these events detected by the 
network but which occurred outside the region of interest (Figure 3.4). 
Figure 3.4: Trigger summary plot during the October 2012 earthquake swarm in the Tjrnes Fracture Zone. 
Events outside the spatial filter (dashed green lines in map and cross section plots) are rejected, denoted by 
grey circles in location plots, and grey lines in coalescence timeseries. These mis-located triggers are generally 
restricted to the far NNW of the search grid, corresponding to the azimuth to the true source locations. 
In total, 179,791 candidate events were identified from 4,795 days of data processed; a mean rate 
of 37 events/day. 10th October 2007 was the only day with zero events detected. 
3.2.5 Locate 
Locate is the final stage of a QuakeMigrate run, and involves re-migrating a short period of data 
around the origin time of each candidate event identified by Trigger, to output a refined location and 
associated uncertainty statistics, as well as a host of optional outputs. I chose to additionally compute 
automatic phase picks (used during the automatic relocation procedure described in Chapter 5) local 
magnitude estimates, and output raw and instrument-corrected cut waveforms for each event. 
The migration was computed on a less decimated grid, with node spacing of 1 km in each 
dimension. This choice was made to balance computational cost against location precision; a less 
decimated grid would have produced less gridded but similarly accurate locations, given the likely 
spatial uncertainties. The Marginal Window  the time period over which the coalescence function 
was marginalised in determining the location uncertainty PDF  was set to 1 second. This corresponds 
to the likely origin time uncertainty, derived from the expected location uncertainty (around 2 km), and 
minimum velocities of 2 km/s for the shallowest events. In general this is a conservative estimate. 
The onset function parameters were identical to those used for Detect, but here using the centred 
STA/LTA algorithm, which produces a more realistic approximation of the phase arrival timing 
uncertainty. Furthermore, similarly to Trigger, Locate was run on an enhanced version of the software, 
the functionality of which will be included in a future release v1.1.0. New features include adding the 
option to specify the signal transformation applied before measuring the STA/LTA, which previously 
defaulted to taking the square of the waveform, and further flexibility for selecting the data quality 
criteria. For Locate, I instead used the square of the signal envelope, which was found to produce a 
smoother function which better separates real phase arrivals from noise spikes. I again specified that 
only perfectly continuous data should be used, now determined individually for each phase. Similarly 
to Detect, data were re-sampled to 50 Hz for onset function calculation and migration. Phase picks 
were made using a dynamic pick threshold, determined as  8 times the median absolute deviation of 
the onset function amplitude outside the picking windows, which were calculated assuming a 10% 
uncertainty in the LUT travel-times (Figure 2.5). 
Following the method of Greenfield et al. (2020), S-wave amplitudes were measured on 2  20 Hz 
bandpass-filtered, Wood-Anderson simulated waveforms. The filtering is necessary to remove the 
strong microseism recorded in Iceland. Here, however, the measurements were corrected for the 
applied filter, by making an approximate measurement of the period of the maximum peak-to-peak 
amplitude in the signal, in order to read and adjust for the corresponding filter gain. This leads to more 
accurate (higher) magnitude estimates for larger events. The S-wave signal window was determined 
in a similar manner to the pick windows (described in section 2.3.8), plus an additional 1 second. 
Noise measurements were made by taking the amplitude of the envelope of the signal in a 5 second 
window preceding the P-wave arrival window. Only S-wave amplitudes exceeding 3 times the noise 
amplitude were retained. Local magnitudes were calculated using the attenuation curve for the Askja 
region determined by Greenfield et al. (2020). 
176,115 (98%) of candidate events were successfully located; those which do not converge to a 
coalescence peak within the duration of the Marginal Window are rejected. In the vast majority of 
cases this occurs when multiple triggers are made from a single event, caused by peaks along the 
upwards slope as the coalescence converged to a maximum (see section 3.3.1 and Figure 2.3). 
3.2.6 Preliminary earthquake catalogue 
The preliminary earthquake catalogue output by Locate is displayed in Figure 3.5, and for individual 
time periods in Figures A.1-31. The key features of the seismicity in the Askja region are immediately 
apparent: shallow seismicity is dominantly focussed in the area between Askja and Herubrei, and 
multiple clusters of deep earthquakes occur at between 10-25 km b.s.l., alongside the dipping plane 
of seismicity between 10-20 km depth marking the 2007-08 Upptyppingar dike intrusion in the 
southeast (see Figure 3.1 for reference to geographical locations). There are also shallow clusters of 
seismicity in Askja caldera, particularly in the southeast around Lake skjuvatn, in the northwest of 
the nested calderas, and along two subparallel lineations further to the northwest. 
Figure 3.5: Preliminary QuakeMigrate earthquake catalogue output by Locate. Map and cross sections display 
the locations of the 176,115 successfully located events in the Askja region, scaled by magnitude and coloured 
by coalescence value; deep and shallow events are coloured separately (see Legend). Cross sections are 
plotted with no vertical exaggeration. Background shading shows topography, with Vatnajkull icecap shaded 
lighter (bottom), and 2014-15 Holuhraun lava flow in grey. 
The location constraint and characteristics of the detected events are clearly illustrated in the 
automatically generated QuakeMigrate event summary plots (Figures 3.6 and 3.7). The shallow 
events, dominantly between -1.0 < ML < 3, are characterised by impulsive, high frequency arrivals, 
typically between 5-10 Hz. The reported Gaussian location uncertainties are typically around 2.5 km 
in X and Y, and 3 km in depth. The waveforms of the deep earthquakes are significantly more 
emergent, with the P phase arrivals often obscured by noise, and usually occur in swarms of closely-
spaced events (e.g. Figure 3.7c). The migration approach is particularly powerful at detecting and  
locating these events, likely because they are typically observed across a large proportion of the 
network. Some of the successfully located events require careful inspection to recognise by eye, and 
it is immediately apparent how a traditional approach relying on automatic phase picking would 
struggle to detect them (e.g. Figure 3.7b). 
However, the boundaries of both the regional filter applied in Trigger, and of the search grid defined 
by the LUT, are still clearly delineated by scattered events in both the deep and shallow crust (Figure 
3.5). These are likely to be mostly made up of artefacts, so the catalogue will benefit from a filtering 
procedure to further improve its robustness. 
3.3  Objective filtering to generate a robust earthquake catalogue 
I applied a statistical analysis most commonly used in the training or assessment of machine learning 
algorithms to assess the robustness of my earthquake catalogue. From a representative 50 day period 
in 2018, I manually inspected the 1,126 located events in order to label each as a real event, or an 
artefact. It would generally be prohibitively time-consuming to perform this type of manual analysis, 
but the automatically generated QuakeMigrate event summary plots provide an extremely useful tool 
that make it possible to achieve quickly and efficiently. 
These labelled events also provide an opportunity to objectively assess the power of each statistic 
output by Locate to distinguish real events from artefacts. This enabled me to objectively select a 
filtering strategy according to the desired properties for the earthquake catalogue, in terms of the 
trade-off between catalogue completeness and the rate of artefacts. 
3.3.1 Labelling a representative sample of events 
The marginalised coalescence map plots coupled with the waveform gather allow for straightforward 
distinction between artefacts and real events (Figure 3.8). Artefacts were found to be caused by a 
small variety of scenarios, in addition to a minority of false triggers on noise. The most common cause 
was under-migration and/or misidentification of phase arrivals, generally from events which were 
successfully located at their true origin time and location several seconds later (e.g. Figure 3.8). As 
discussed in section 3.2.3, this was an expected consequence of using the minimum possible value 
for the minimum event interval parameter in Trigger. 
Other false triggers identified during this period were associated with earthquakes in Brarbunga 
and rfajkull calderas, deep seismicity beneath Vatnajkull, and, occasionally, direct arrivals from 
teleseismic events. Of the 1,126 events, 45 were labelled as artefacts, and 8 were classed as 
ambiguous; likely real events, but too small to be well-located. Of the artefacts, 21 were removed by 
applying a spatial filter similar to that applied in Trigger. A further 3 artefacts, and a single small, real 
event were removed by excluding events for which a magnitude could not be calculated - indicating 
that the waveform amplitudes measured in the S-wave amplitude window were below the noise 
threshold for all stations. This resulted in an overall Precision (proportion of the catalogue made up 
of real events) of 95.9% for the raw earthquake catalogue output by Locate, and 98.1% for that with 
two routine filters applied, an already exceptional result. 
Figure 3.8: QuakeMigrate event summary plot showing the most common cause of artefacts. (a) an artefact 
caused by under-migration, due to misidentification of P arrivals detected on the horizontal channels as S. (b) 
the same event at its correct location several seconds later, with the phase arrivals identified correctly. Note 
that in (a) the coalescence only barely reaches a maximum within the marginal window (bottom right panel). 
3.3.2 Precision-Recall analysis of filtering performance 
Locate outputs a variety of statistics, each designed to describe different properties of each located 
event. Each can be useful in distinguishing groups of earthquakes, but it is worth pausing to consider 
what makes a good filter. Fundamentally, this depends on the goals of the user. In this case, I seek 
to distinguish real events which are capable of being accurately located, from artefacts, mis-located 
events and those too small for their locations to be constrained. For the Askja network these artefacts 
arise from a variety of sources, so it is not immediately clear which measure will best separate them. 
As discussed in section 3.2.3, the coalescence value represents a network-averaged signal to 
noise ratio for an event, but is also affected by changes in the network configuration, and not 
necessarily in line with its ability to resolve event locations. A high coalescence value is therefore a 
necessary condition to locate an earthquake well, but possibly doesnt provide sufficient information 
to distinguish real events from artefacts, particularly when the network consists of few stations. 
Figure 3.9: Histograms displaying the distribution of real events and artefacts with respect to each candidate 
filtering statistic. Note real events and artefacts have different y-axis scales. Ambiguous events are not included. 
The Gaussian location uncertainty statistic is derived from locally fitting a 3D Gaussian function to 
the marginalised coalescence map. It is designed primarily to provide a measure of the shape of the 
location PDF in the immediate vicinity of the peak, in order to characterise the location uncertainty for 
real events. It is less clear how well it might be able to separate these from artefacts or mis-locations. 
In contrast, the global covariance statistic is calculated from the covariance of the marginalised 
coalescence map, cropped above the 90th percentile, and is intended to characterise the broadness 
of the three-dimensional peak that represents the possible earthquake hypocentre. It thus describes 
how well localised the seismic source is  corresponding most closely to the distinction I wish to make 
here in identifying well-located events; indeed, it was designed for this purpose. Both spatial 
uncertainty statistics are reported separately for each dimension, and it was found that taking the 
geometric mean of these three values provides the most useful way of combining them. 
Histograms of the frequency distribution of labelled events plotted against each of these three 
parameters provide an initial indication that the geometric mean of the global covariance value 
provides the most powerful tool to distinguish the 21 remaining artefacts from real events (Figure 3.9). 
The coalescence value and Gaussian uncertainties also separate most real events from artefacts, but 
with considerably more overlap. 
This can be viewed more clearly, and assessed quantitatively, by constructing Precision-Recall 
curves (Figure 3.10), where Precision and Recall are defined as: 
Precision = True positives / (True positives + False positives) 
Recall = True positives / (True positives + False negatives) 
A Precision-Recall (PR) analysis is similar to constructing a Receiver Operator Characteristic  
(ROC) curve, but gives more informative results in cases where the dataset is highly skewed (Davis 
and Goadrich, 2006) as is the case here: 98.1% of the dataset are real events. The curve is 
constructed by sweeping through the full range of possible values for the statistic in question, and 
calculating the Precision and Recall at each. An unskilled classifier would, on average, return a 
Precision corresponding to the proportion of the dataset made up by the desired class of events (in 
this case 98.1%) for any value of Recall (determined simply by the portion of the dataset selected). 
The performance of each statistic above this null scenario thus characterises its power as a classifier, 
and can be measured by the area under the curve (AUC), here calculated above the 98.1% percentile 
(Figure 3.10). 
It should be noted that these PR curves are derived from only a sample of the data (in this case 
slightly less than 1% of the total raw catalogue) so are not definitive. However, they provide a broad 
indication of the relative performance of these three possible filtering parameters, and the shape of 
the trade-off between Precision and Recall in each case.  The AUC values indicate that all three 
perform well at automatically separating real events from artefacts, but the global covariance statistic 
is clearly the most powerful classifier, with a score of 96% (Figure 3.10). These plots also facilitate 
the selection of a filter value based on the desired requirements for either catalogue completeness 
(Recall), or robustness to artefacts (Precision). Based on this sample, the global covariance statistic 
is capable of returning a catalogue with a Precision of higher than 99.5% (199 out of every 200 events 
being real), at a Recall approaching 99%. 
Figure 3.10: Precision-Recall curves for each candidate filtering statistic. A perfect classifier would achieve a 
Precision of 1 for all values of Recall (black dashed line); an unskilled classifier would achieve a Precision of 
98.1% for all values of Recall (blue dashed line). The power of each statistic to separate real events from 
artefacts is thus quantified by their performance over this level, represented by the area under the curve (AUC 
value top right; measured from the area shaded green on each panel). The Precision and Recall at a range of 
possible filter values are displayed by annotated black points. 
3.3.3 Catalogue filtering strategy 
The raw catalogue was first filtered by applying a regional filter similar to that used in Trigger, and 
removing events with a null magnitude. In this case the regional filter was set slightly differently for 
shallow (< 9 km b.s.l.) and deep events. In addition, a small number of mis-located events associated 
with earthquake swarms in the Tjrnes fracture zone were removed with an additional spatial filter in 
the northeast of the study region during those periods. 
Following the Precision-Recall analysis, I elected to additionally filter the catalogue by global 
covariance value, with the baseline filter set at 5.5 km. This corresponds to the knee of the Precision-
Recall curve (Figure 3.10), and therefore an optimal trade-off between completeness and robustness, 
which is suitable for the analyses I perform in this dissertation. It is intuitive that some adjustment 
should be required to this value over the duration of the dataset, because, as for the coalescence 
value, the ability of the network to distinguish real events from noise varies with the number of stations 
in the network, and its geometry. It is more likely for noise, or arrivals from a mis-located event, to 
coalesce strongly at a point in the grid when fewer stations are operating. Peaks in the coalescence 
map for small, real events might also be less well localised, but this adjustment to the filter thus 
corresponds to the evolving detection capability of the network, which is a physically reasonable 
approach. 
The filter value was set within the time blocks used to run QuakeMigrate, corresponding to periods 
where the network configuration was consistent (section 3.2.1). Within the 50-day period analysed in 
2018, the selected filter value of 5.5 km was found to approximately correspond to the knee of the 
frequency distribution of global covariance uncertainties considering all located events. Where the 
filter value was required to be adjusted from the baseline value, this metric was thus used together 
with manual inspection of the distribution of accepted and rejected events to select an appropriate 
value. However, it is encouraging for the use of this approach in future that a single value gave 
excellent results over such a wide majority of the time range, including periods where the network 
varied from fewer than 10 to more than 30 operational stations. Only during blocks of time where far 
fewer (winter 2007-2008) and significantly more (summer 2014 to summer 2016) stations were 
operating was the filter threshold adjusted down and up, respectively (Figure 3.2). 
When analysing earthquake catalogues, the presence of artefacts with large magnitudes affects 
the results disproportionately compared to small events, due to their relative abundances following 
the Gutenberg-Richter distribution, and the power-law scaling of seismic moment release. As a final 
step, all shallow earthquakes (those to be studied in detail in this dissertation) in the filtered catalogue 
with ML  2.5, and events ML > 1 with large global covariance values ( > 3 in 2014, all events in early 
2008, and with global covariance values > 1 otherwise), were inspected manually and labelled as in 
section 3.2.1. This served to further improve the robustness of the catalogue, and also as a loose 
assessment of whether the applied global covariance filter performed as expected. 34 of the 276 
events reviewed were found to be artefacts, corresponding to a Precision of 87.7%. This is in line with 
expectations  somewhat lower than the > 99% suggested by the PR analysis  considering that only 
those events with the largest global covariance values (and therefore most likely to be artefacts) were 
analysed. 
3.4  Seismicity in the Askja region 2007-2020 
The final, filtered earthquake catalogue is displayed in Figure 3.11, and clearly demonstrates the 
benefits of the filtering applied to the raw QuakeMigrate output (Figure 3.5) using the statistics output 
alongside the earthquake locations by Locate. In total it consists of 155,282 events; 88.2% of the raw 
QuakeMigrate catalogue. Here I briefly describe the main features of the seismicity, though in the 
remainder of this dissertation I focus my analysis on the shallow earthquakes only.  
Figure 3.11: Filtered earthquake catalogue 2007-2020. Map and cross sections display locations of the 155,282 
events retained after filtering, scaled by magnitude and coloured by global covariance value; deep and shallow 
events are coloured separately (see colour bars). Cross sections are plotted with no vertical exaggeration. 
Background shading shows topography, with Vatnajkull icecap shaded lighter (bottom), and 2014-15 
Holuhraun lava flow in grey. Note the lowest global covariance value is found in the centres of the deep clusters. 
3.4.1 Deep seismicity 
The power of the global covariance statistic to distinguish the best located events is further 
demonstrated in that events with the lowest global covariance values are clearly focussed at the 
centres of each earthquake cluster. This is particularly visible in the deep clusters, which Greenfield 
and White (2015) showed likely originate from point sources of repeating seismicity, at least for 
individual hours-long swarms. It is therefore encouraging that the scatter in earthquake locations, 
generally +/- 2-3 km in all directions, corresponds closely to the location uncertainties reported by 
QuakeMigrate. Through combining evidence from moment tensor solutions, seismic Vp/Vs ratios and 
local earthquake tomography, Greenfield & White conclude that these swarms of near-identical 
repeating earthquakes are generated by high strain rates associated with fluid movement in the lower 
crust, possibly caused by magma movement at the boundaries of sill intrusions. In addition to the 
clusters identified previously (Greenfield, 2016; Figure 3.12), smaller clusters at the far north of the 
study area, beneath Kollttadyngja, and several new individual clusters beneath Askja and east of 
the previously studied Kollttadyngja cluster are now clearly visible. These likely mark further sites of 
fluid movement, possibly also associated with magmatic sills. 
Figure 3.12: Lower crustal earthquakes detected between 2009-15 by Greenfield (2016) using CMM. (a) 
locations in map view (red dots); clusters labelled by location as A (Askja), V (Vaalda) and K (Kollttadyngja). 
Contours are plotted at 5-100 events per km2. (b) locations in depth along the cross section indicated by the 
black like in (a); point A is 10 km SSW of the margins of the map displayed here; contours are as in (a). Modified 
after Greenfield (2016). 
In comparison to the catalogue of Greenfield (2016), the earthquake catalogue presented here 
contains both more tightly clustered deep earthquakes, as well as significantly fewer scattered events. 
This previous catalogue was generated using the Coalescence Microseismic Mapping (CMM) 
technique on which QuakeMigrate is based. As well as the more sophisticated and flexible trigger 
algorithm used here, the significantly superior results from QuakeMigrate are possibly influenced by 
the filtering procedure used; the CMM catalogue was filtered solely based on the SNR reported for 
each event (closely related to the QuakeMigrate coalescence value) which was shown in section 3.3.2 
to provide inferior performance as a classifier.  
As well as including 5 more years of seismicity since the end of this previous catalogue, that 
presented here also contains microearthquakes from most of the duration of the 2007-2008 
Upptyppingar dike intrusion, delineating a southeastward dipping plane striking at roughly 070 in the 
far southeast of the study region. Detailed studies by Jakobsdttir et al. (2008), Martens (2010), 
Martens et al. (2010) and White et al. (2011) show with relative relocations derived from manually 
refined phase picks that the seismicity is tightly clustered within at most 100 m of this dipping plane. 
Fault plane solutions indicate that these events are generated by dike parallel shear, and the detection 
of reversed mechanisms within quick succession provides evidence that they represent brittle failure 
of chilled magma within the conduit itself. QuakeMigrate locations with the lowest global covariance 
values are again found closest to the centre of the previously identified plane (Figure 3.11), and with 
location scatter and reported uncertainties compatible with the expected source distribution for this 
mechanism. 
3.4.2 Shallow seismicity 
In map view, the shallow seismicity around Askja can be separated into five main groups. The vast 
majority of the catalogue is made up of earthquakes that form a region of intense seismicity between 
Askja and Mt. Herubrei, totalling more than 100,000 events (Figure 3.11). These appear to contain 
linear clusters of seismicity, though are difficult to distinguish from the somewhat gridded 
QuakeMigrate locations. A second dense area of seismicity is located at Lake skjuvatn, in Askja 
caldera. This can be separated into the more diffuse events beneath the lake itself, and an extremely 
dense cluster slightly to the southeast, consisting of close to 15,000 events. A third group of 
earthquakes extends northwest from Askja caldera, consisting of a dense cluster beneath the caldera 
rim, and a NNE striking band of seismicity beneath the flank of the edifice. Further northwest still, a 
fourth cluster of seismicity strikes similarly to the NNE, though is largely located outside the footprint 
of the seismic network. Finally, there is a concentrated cluster of more than 6,500 events beneath Mt 
Upptyppingar, slightly offset to the southeast from the main band of seismicity between Askja and 
Herubrei, and concentrated at the base of the brittle layer of the crust. Martens & White (2013) 
analysed manual relocations of a subset of this seismicity and determined from moment tensor 
solutions and deformation modelling that they were induced by stresses caused by the Upptyppingar 
dike intrusion, but only after a 5 month delay, indicating the key role of volatiles released from the 
intrusion in triggering these earthquakes. 
Further small clusters are observed concentrated at the base of the brittle crust beneath 
Kollttadyngja, at the far north of the study region, and beneath and east of the Jkuls  Fjllum 
river in the east. These have not previously been analysed in detail, and will not be investigated in 
this dissertation. Two previously unrecognised clusters of seismicity are observed directly to the east 
and west of the Vaalda lava shield, at the far south of the study region. Inspection of the 
QuakeMigrate event summary plots for a sample of these events confirms they are not artefacts, but 
they have anomalously long, emergent waveforms, with indistinct S wave arrivals. These would be 
interesting to investigate in more detail in a future study. 
Viewed in cross section (particularly against Longitude), the seismicity clearly marks a shallowing 
of the brittle-ductile boundary  as marked by the base of the shallow seismicity  moving westwards 
from Herubrei towards Askja (Figure 3.11), in agreement with the findings of Soosalu et al. (2010) 
and Greenfield et al. (2016) from analysis of manually refined earthquake locations. 
3.4.3 Temporal evolution of seismicity 
The spatiotemporal evolution of the seismicity is most clearly observed in Movie C.1, which displays 
the entire catalogue including both deep and shallow seismicity. As found by previous authors (Key 
et al. 2011a,b; Greenfield and White, 2015) the clusters of deep earthquakes dominantly occur in 
short-lived swarms, generally lasting only a few hours. The catalogue presented here also provides 
an opportunity to observe the full spatiotemporal evolution of the 2007-08 Upptyppingar dike intrusion, 
marked by more than 12,000 well-located events. See Figure C.1 for a Latitude against time plot as 
shown for the shallow seismicity in Figure 3.13. 
The shallow seismicity exhibits several striking features, also displayed as a timeseries against 
Latitude in Figure 3.13. The earthquakes in the vicinity of Lake skjuvatn, in Askja caldera, are active 
near-continuously for the 13 year extent of the catalogue (green horizontal band). In contrast, most 
other groups of seismicity are characterised by swarms of varying durations. The swarm of 
earthquakes near the base of the brittle upper crust close to Mt Upptyppingar initiates in August 2008, 
is most active in the following 6 months, and then gradually declines over the remainder of the study 
period. However, the clearest example of swarm-like seismicity is seen in the largest group of 
earthquakes extending between Askja and Mt Herubrei (blue), and to a lesser extent in the two 
groups of seismicity at the northwest corner and northwest of Askja caldera (pink and grey, 
respectively). These are the dominant features of the timeline in Figure 3.13 as well as Movie C.1, 
and analysis of these swarms, which clearly punctuate the background seismicity, forms the focus of 
the remaining Chapters of this dissertation. 
The swarms mostly delineate vertically dipping faults, striking either north-south or northeast-
southwest (Movie C.1).  The fine structure of the network of faults they illuminate is analysed in 
Chapter 6, including comparison to previous manual analysis by Green et al. (2014) and more recent 
geodetic studies on the deformation field in this region of the Northern Volcanic Zone (Drouin et al., 
2017). The swarms last from periods of hours or days to several weeks, often exhibiting a clear 
systematic migration over their duration, and vary in size, as measured by their spatial extent, seismic 
moment release and maximum magnitude. Their characteristics are analysed in detail in Chapter 7, 
and compared to earthquake swarms observed both elsewhere in Iceland and across the globe. Over 
much of the duration of the study period the swarms are observed to occur at a relatively uniform rate, 
but there is a dramatic surge in seismicity in August-September 2014, corresponding to the 
propagation of the Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion (orange bar on Figure 3.13) which 
terminated approximately 15 km south of the study region (Figures 3.1 & 3.11). The elevated 
seismicity began in the southwest, nearest to the propagating dike tip, before sweeping northeast 
towards Herubrei, lighting up the entire study region. Swarms then subsequently continued at a 
comparable rate to before the dike intrusion. This intriguing sequence is investigated in Chapter 8. 
Figure 3.13: Timeseries of shallow seismicity against Latitude. Top panel displays the locations of shallow 
earthquakes for the duration of the catalogue (2007-2020), coloured by groups discussed in the text; from north 
to south: orange = Kollttadyngja, blue = Askja-Herubrei, grey = west of Askja, pink = northwest flank of Askja 
caldera, red = Upptyppingar, green = Lake skjuvatn (within Askja caldera). Bottom panel shows cumulative 
seismic moment release through time. Note how the swarms (in blue, pink and grey groups) clearly punctuate 
the background seismicity, and correspond to sharp increases in the rate of seismic moment release. The 
duration of the Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion and eruption are shaded dark and light orange, 
respectively (both panels). 
3.4.4 Magnitude of completeness 
The overall catalogue completeness for shallow earthquakes around Askja is ML 0.03, with a reported 
b-value of 1.014  0.005 (Figure 3.14), calculated using the b-value stability method described in 
Greenfield et al. (2020). 
Figure 3.14: Frequency magnitude distribution for 131,136 shallow earthquakes in the Askja region 2007-2020. 
Cumulative number of events in each bin (of width 0.05) is shown by red triangles; cumulative number of events 
greater and equal to a given magnitude shown by black dots. Fit to the cumulative distribution shown by blue 
line, with the magnitude of completeness (MC) marked by the blue inverted open triangle. Events range from  
-1.5 < ML < 4.3, and closely follow the Gutenberg-Richter relationship between 0 < ML < 2.5, returning a 
measured b-value of 1.014, close to the globally observed value. 
This indicates that the seismicity around Askja closely follows the globally observed Gutenberg-
Richter distribution. However, caution should be taken in interpreting whole-catalogue frequency-
magnitude distributions for regions containing such a diverse variety of seismicity. As displayed in 
Figure 3.15, the significant changes to the network configuration over the 13 year study period have 
clearly led to a time-varying magnitude of completeness, which can lead to spurious b-value 
measurements when not carefully accounted for. I therefore do not attempt to analyse the whole-
catalogue magnitude-frequency distribution in detail, but I do compare relative b-values associated 
with individual seismic swarms in Chapter 7. 
The two clearest periods of increased MC coincide with the network consisting of as few as 3 
stations in winter 2007-08 (Figure 3.2) and the Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion and eruption 
from August 2014 to February 2015 (Figure 3.15). Interestingly, this leads to differing excursions in 
the global covariance values for events which are detected, betraying their differing causes. 
Figure 3.15: Magnitude of shallow Askja earthquakes through time. Earthquakes shown by dots, coloured by 
global covariance value. Lines show the cumulative number of earthquakes through time (black) and cumulative 
seismic moment release (red). Note the contrast in event rate (black line) and moment rate (red line) between 
the swarm in May 2014, and the surge in seismicity in August-September, where the moment release was 
substantially larger, but fewer events were detected. The duration of the Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion 
and eruption are shaded dark and light orange, respectively. 
In winter 2007-08 the global covariance value for an event of a given magnitude is lower than in 
the adjacent periods. This is because when fewer stations are operating it is more likely for coherent 
signals to coalesce to a sharp peak. This is also seen to a much lesser to extent in 2016-17. However, 
using fewer observations leads to noise, poorly located events, or events located outside the search 
grid also having a higher chance of coalescing, hence the necessity to increase the harshness of the 
trigger threshold and/or global covariance value filter during these periods. 
In contrast, during 2014-15 the increased magnitude of completeness was dominantly caused by 
intense seismicity (both around Askja and along the dike path) and by eruption tremor (e.g. Woods et 
al., 2018). The intense seismicity increases the likelihood of there being overlapping phase arrivals 
from closely spaced events, therefore decreasing the extent to which true events stands out from the 
background. The effect of the eruption tremor is simplest to understand, as it leads to a straightforward 
decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio over the network, reducing both the SNR of each observed arrival 
and the number of stations on which a given event is detected. This leads to decreased SNR for the 
event, and poorer location (sharpness of the peak), hence reducing the global covariance value. 
These factors considered, the results presented in Figures 3.14 and 3.15 nonetheless indicate that 
the goal of compiling a highly complete catalogue has been achieved; the previous catalogue 
(Greenfield et al., 2020 - covering the period 2009-2015) reported a magnitude of completeness of 
0.8 for the same region. 
3.5  Conclusions 
1. QuakeMigrate, augmented with the new trigger algorithm detailed here, proves an extremely 
powerful tool for detecting earthquakes from continuous seismic data, particularly in the face 
of challenges provided by the varying Askja seismic network and seismicity. 
2. Manual review of a representative sample of the 2007-2020 earthquake catalogue indicate a 
Precision of 98.1% with routine filtering applied. 
3. A Precision-Recall analysis facilitates an objective selection of filtering strategy, and shows 
that the QuakeMigrate global covariance statistic provides a powerful tool to distinguish 
between well-located earthquakes and artefacts of various nature. 
4. The final, filtered earthquake catalogue contains 155,282 events, of which 131,136 occur at 
less than 9 km depth and are studied in detail in this dissertation. The magnitude of 
completeness for the shallow seismicity is 0.03, with a b-value of 1.014  0.005. 
5. Deep earthquakes occur in discrete spatial clusters, with the exception of the Upptyppingar 
dike intrusion, which describes a dipping plane corresponding to the geometry of the magmatic 
body. Locations and spatial uncertainties reported by QuakeMigrate are compatible with the 
findings of previous analysis which attributes deep clusters of seismicity to repeated failure of 
point sources of seismicity, and fracturing of melt at the margins of the mid-crustal 
Upptyppingar dike. 
6. The shallow earthquakes are divided into five main groups, with the largest being the intense 
area of seismicity extending from Askja to Mt Herubrei. These exhibit contrasting temporal 
evolution, with near-continuous seismicity near Lake skjuvatn, a single decaying swarm of 
events close to Mt Upptyppingar, and multiple staccato swarms punctuating the background 
seismicity elsewhere in the Askja region, particularly between Askja and Herubrei. 
7. Swarms show clear systematic migration of hypocentres over durations of hours to weeks. 
They occur at a relatively uniform rate throughout the study period, apart from a dramatic 
surge of seismicity in August-September 2014, corresponding to the timing of the 
Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion. Individual swarms highlight planar, vertically dipping 
faults striking north-south or northeast-southwest. 
Chapter 4 
Comparison of QuakeMigrate and manually 
refined earthquake locations 
In this Chapter I describe the techniques used to calculate refined locations for a sample of manually 
picked earthquakes, and their comparison to those calculated using QuakeMigrate. Manual 
earthquake analysis and location refinement has traditionally been the gold standard in studying 
microseismicity with local seismic networks. Over the course of 13 years of study, more than 3,000 
shallow earthquakes have been manually analysed in the region around Askja. Here I compile these, 
and use a subset of the best-located events as a benchmark against which to compare the locations 
calculated automatically with QuakeMigrate, to both demonstrate its performance, and to validate 
their use for the analyses performed in the remainder of this dissertation. Manually analysed events 
with sufficient P-wave polarity picks will also be used to calculate fault plane solutions in Chapter 6. 
4.1  Manual earthquake locations: NonLinLoc  
All available manually picked phase arrival data for shallow earthquakes in the region around Askja 
volcano are relocated using NLLoc, a non-linear earthquake location algorithm provided as part of the 
NonLinLoc software package (Lomax et al., 2000). NLLoc is a probabilistic location method, and uses 
an efficient, cascading Oct-Tree importance sampling algorithm to conduct a 3D grid search for the 
optimally fitting hypocentre given phase arrival time observations and uncertainties for a single event. 
I use the Equal Differential Time (EDT) likelihood function (Font et al., 2004), which considers pairs 
of observations as differential traveltimes, making the inversion independent of event origin time. The 
posterior probability of a given location satisfying the observations is then calculated from the sum of 
the probabilities across the observed differential times (equation 4.1).  
Equal Differential Time likelihood function: 
(4.1) 
where x is a vector describing the three spatial coordinates (x, y, z), t0 is event origin time, a,b are a 
priori uncertainties for observations at stations a & b, tobs and tP are observed and modelled 
traveltimes, respectively, N is the number of pairs of observations, and k is a normalisation factor. 
Least-squares L2 likelihood function: 
(4.2) 
where i = a priori uncertainty for observation i. 
A limited parallel can be drawn here with how QuakeMigrate combines measurements from 
individual onset functions at each grid point: in both cases only observations which intersect 
coherently near the true hypocentre location contribute to the location estimate. This is in contrast to 
techniques formulated using an L1 or L2 likelihood function, which combine the misfits from all 
observations within the exponential term when calculating the posterior probability (equation 4.2), 
making them susceptible to significantly skewed results in the presence of outliers. 
The search over possible hypocentres, x, begins on a coarse grid, and recursively subdivides the 
highest probability cells to sample better-fitting areas more densely. In addition to the fit of the 
modelled to observed differential traveltimes, the probability value for each sample location is also 
weighted by the variance of the origin times calculated for that point across all phase arrival time 
observations (using the EDT_OT_WT option). This further down-weights locations which are not 
consistent with the arrival time observations. The potential hypocentre locations explored by the Oct-
Tree search provide a sample of the unparameterised posterior PDF describing the source location. 
In the case of the relatively smooth 1D velocity model and regular station geometry used here, these 
PDFs can be well characterised by the covariances of this distribution reported by NLLoc (assuming 
a Gaussian distribution). 
All phase arrival picks are accompanied by uncertainty estimates, ranging from 0.01 s (the 
sampling interval for 100 Hz data) to 0.2 s. NLLoc also considers an a priori estimate of the uncertainty 
in the modelled traveltimes, described as a function of travel-time. This serves both to include model 
errors incurred due to uncertainty in the subsurface velocity structure, and to apply a distance 
weighting, such that observations from closer stations are prioritised. In comparison, distance 
weighting of observations is included implicitly in QuakeMigrate according to the signal to noise ratio 
of the recorded phase arrivals, via the relative amplitude of the onset functions. The distance 
weighting scheme for NLLoc is set identically to that used by Greenfield et al. (2020), which has been 
shown in synthetic testing by Green (2016) and Greenfield (2015) for the same region to return 
locations accurate within approximately 0.5 km epicentrally and 1 km in depth, using a network 
geometry representative of that used here. 
The velocity model and grid projection used are identical to those specified when calculating the 
traveltime lookup tables for QuakeMigrate, and use the same Eikonal finite-difference solver provided 
by the NonLinLoc program Grid2Time (Podvin and Lecomte, 1991; Lomax et al., 2000). However, the 
efficiency of the cascading Oct-Tree importance sampling algorithm used by NLLoc, as well as the 
elimination of origin time from the grid search, make it possible to use a significantly more finely 
spaced spatial grid for an acceptable computational cost. I set the initial search grid to a cell-size of 
0.5 km in each dimension, and halt the subdivision when it reaches 0.01 km. To facilitate this, the 
LUT is calculated at a grid spacing of 0.05 km. 
3,296 shallow events were successfully located between July 2007 and July 2015, of which 1,977 
remained after removing duplicates and discarding events with fewer than 12 picked phases, Root 
Mean Square residuals greater than 0.12 s, and reported location uncertainties of greater than 1.2 
km (combined by taking the geometric mean). This filtering served both to remove low quality picks, 
as well as to use only the best-located events for comparison. 
4.2  Comparison to QuakeMigrate locations 
1,963 (99.3%) of the sample of earthquakes with manually refined locations were successfully 
matched to the QuakeMigrate catalogue, with magnitudes ranging from -0.7 < ML < 4.3. The locations 
derived from these two independent analysis workflows are displayed for comparison in Figure 4.1. 
This forms a rigorous benchmark of the new, automatic location algorithm described in this 
dissertation (Chapter 2), using earthquakes with a range of magnitudes, located with varying network 
geometry, and crucially using identically generated traveltime lookup tables  the one common input 
required by the two techniques. 
To first order, both the distributions (relative locations within clusters) and absolute positions of 
earthquakes are very similar across the study area for the two location methods. Subtle differences 
are observed upon closer inspection; for example, the cluster of seismicity at Kollttadyngja (K) is 
significantly less scattered in depth in the QuakeMigrate catalogue than that derived from manual 
phase picking. This is also the case in map view for the 2013 swarm at the centre of the study area, 
the lineations of seismicity at the northwest of Askja caldera, and in both map and depth for the 
clusters of seismicity at Upptyppingar (U) and at the southeast of Askja caldera. In contrast, the two 
large cross-cutting lineations of earthquakes from 2014 suffer from significant gridding in the 
QuakeMigrate locations, though otherwise they agree well. This is likely influenced by the relatively 
large magnitudes of these earthquakes (Figure 4.2), meaning they coalesce extremely sharply in the 
QuakeMigrate search grid (e.g. Figure 3.6a), and so limiting the power of the 3D spline interpolation 
(described in section 2.3.8) to obtain an estimate of the peak in the location PDF at a finer resolution 
than the 1 km search grid. 
To fully assess the agreement in the absolute locations, it is necessary to calculate the location 
differences for individual events. These are displayed in Figure 4.3, calculated in each dimension 
separately. The range of location differences in each direction is smaller than the mean location 
uncertainties reported for the manually refined earthquake locations (0.3 km in X and Y, and 0.7 km 
in depth). The mean (systematic) differences are also small, particularly in epicentral location. This  
echoes the impression from visual inspection, indicating an excellent agreement between the 
automatically calculated QuakeMigrate locations and the best-located hypocentres derived from 
manual analysis of event waveforms.

(matching Figure 4.1), and stacked to display the cumulative total over the entire time period. 
Figure 4.3: Event location differences between QuakeMigrate and manually refined earthquake catalogues. 
Panels show histograms of distances between individual event hypocentres in the X, Y and Z directions, 
respectively. Mean difference is marked by an orange line; positive difference indicates QuakeMigrate location 
was further east / north, or deeper. Gaussian kernel density estimate is overlain in blue. Note variation in x axis 
scale between panels. 
As well as analysing location differences collectively, they can also be compared to the event 
location uncertainties reported for individual events (Figure 4.4). Significantly, substantially more than 
68% of event locations agree to within the 1 location uncertainties reported by both QuakeMigrate 
and NLLoc. This provides further support for the interpretation that the small location differences that 
are observed can be explained by the inherent absolute uncertainty in individual event locations. As 
discussed in section 2.3.4 and Drew et al. (2013), the absolute values of the QuakeMigrate reported 
uncertainties are subject to applying a calibration to the onset functions dependent on the frequency 
content of the phase arrivals and background noise, explaining the conservative uncertainty estimates 
apparent from this analysis. However, without calibration, they still provide robust relative estimates 
of the location uncertainty (Drew et al. 2013), and will in the overwhelming majority of cases provide 
an overestimate rather than an underestimate, as seen here. Their minimum value is also somewhat 
artificially limited by the 1 km node spacing used here. 
Figure 4.4: Location differences between techniques compared to quoted location uncertainties. Panels show 
cumulative density functions for the ratio of the location difference to the quoted 1 uncertainty for each 
individual event. Green line shows ratio calculated against the Gaussian location uncertainty estimate reported 
by QuakeMigrate, and blue the location uncertainty estimate output by NLLoc (calculated from the covariance 
of the posterior location PDF). Black cross-hairs highlight the 1 percentile (68.3%). Note x-axes are curtailed 
at a ratio of 6 for clarity; a very small minority of points exceed this ratio. 
4.3 Conclusions 
In summary, this comparison demonstrates that the locations calculated automatically using 
QuakeMigrate agree within location uncertainty with a sample of nearly 2,000 manually refined 
earthquake locations distributed across the study area. This indicates that QuakeMigrate, a fully 
automatic location algorithm, achieves at least the same level of location accuracy as this enormously 
more labour intensive and widely held gold standard in microseismic analysis. Furthermore, the 
automatically calculated earthquake locations appear to show more tightly clustered locations for 
several earthquake swarms, where they are not dominated by large magnitude events, indicating that 
the QuakeMigrate locations might in fact be more accurate. 
However, both sets of locations still exhibit significant scatter around the lineations clearly visible 
in the seismicity. To address this, and to resolve the fault structure delineated by the seismicity more 
precisely, relative relocations are calculated for a subset of the QuakeMigrate catalogue in Chapter 
Chapter 5 
Relative relocation of swarm seismicity 
The absolute earthquake location estimates calculated using QuakeMigrate have been shown to 
match the standard of those derived from manual picking of earthquake phase arrivals (Chapter 4). 
However, both of these techniques are limited to considering the arrival data from single events in 
isolation. Even using the fullest possible amount of information contained in the waveforms recorded 
at each station, random noise will always impose a limitation on the accuracy of the phase arrival time 
estimate (whether it be obtained as a discrete pick, or through transformation to an onset function), 
leading to scatter in the locations. By comparing the waveforms from pairs of events observed at 
common stations using cross-correlation, significantly more accurate and precise measurements can 
be made. Furthermore, utilising these differential travel-time measurements within a relative 
relocation procedure can mitigate common-mode errors, for example due to un-modelled velocity 
structure. This approach can thereby deliver a dramatic sharpening in hypocentre locations, and in 
resolution of fine-scale fault structure. 
In this Chapter I apply waveform cross-correlation to calculate accurate and precise differential 
traveltimes for the closely spaced, highly similar earthquakes that make up each seismic swarm. I 
then use these differential times to calculate precise relative relocations, in order to reveal the fine 
details of both the systematic migration of hypocentres observed in Movie C.1, and the geometry of 
the intricate fault network they delineate. These two phenomena will then be investigated in detail in 
Chapters 7 and 6, respectively. 
5.1  A catalogue of swarm seismicity 
Waveform cross-correlation is a computationally expensive exercise. To cross-correlate the 
waveforms of all 131,136 shallow events in the filtered QuakeMigrate catalogue would be unfeasible 
with the computational resources available, with the cost scaling in proportion to the number of events 
squared. Instead, to make this analysis tractable, I first divide the observed seismicity into smaller 
sub-catalogues. 
The primary subdivision applied is based on the spatial distribution of earthquakes. Waveforms 
from pairs of events will generally not correlate strongly unless they are both closely positioned in 
space, and share similar source characteristics (focal mechanism, magnitude). The length-scale over 
which waveform similarity decays depends on several factors, including the scattering properties of 
the medium, the source-station separation, and, most importantly, the frequency content of the signal. 
As a general rule, events separated by less than one quarter of the dominant signal wavelength will 
have the potential to correlate almost perfectly (Geller and Mueller, 1980). However, this applies only 
to individual pairs of events. Reliable relative relocations may be achieved over much longer length-
scales where chains of closely spaced, highly similar events can be linked and relocated against one 
another. This underlines the importance of having generated such a comprehensive earthquake 
catalogue (Chapter 3). In light of this, the seismicity is only separated into groups where they are 
separated by areas of sparsely scattered events, or where there is an indication that more closely-
spaced adjacent groups are not likely to share similar source characteristics, for example due to 
exhibiting significantly different spatiotemporal patterns of occurrence (Figure 3.13).

Table 5.1: Major groups of seismicity in the shallow Askja catalogue. Events from these groups are coloured 
grey, pink, green, blue and red, respectively in Figures 3.13 and 5.1. 
The major groups identified by these criteria correspond to those described in section 3.4.3; listed 
in Table 5.1 and displayed in Figure 5.1. Smaller groups at Kollttadyngja, in the northeast corner of 
Askja caldera, beneath and east of the Jkuls  Fjllum river, and east and west of the Vaalda lava 
shield are also identified as clusters of seismicity, but not analysed in further detail here due to their 
small size, both in number of earthquakes and in spatial extent (see Figure 3.1 for place names). 
Of these sub-catalogues, only that for the Askja-Herubrei region (Figure 5.1) still contains too 
many earthquakes to make calculating relative relocations feasible, and requires further subdivision. 
Previous authors have approached this problem by dividing the seismicity purely by spatial 
distribution; either into overlapping, regular polygons (Waldhauser and Schaff, 2008; Woods et al., 
2019) or irregular, non-overlapping polygons padded with a certain number of nearest-neighbour 
events at their boundaries (Ross et al., 2019b). However, the exceptionally densely clustered 
distribution of seismicity within the Askja-Herubrei region makes this impractical (Figure 5.1). 
Instead, I identify and separate the seismicity into individual seismic swarms, by both their spatial and 
temporal distributions, and perform the waveform cross-correlation and relative relocation separately 
for each. This compromise precludes certain temporal analyses, but is suitable for those conducted 
in this dissertation, and has the distinct benefit that those earthquakes occurring in the same region 
during the same swarm are most likely to have similar source characteristics, and thus produce the 
highest quality differential time measurements.

is plotted in map (top) and cross-section view (bottom panel) in non-overlapping hexagonal bins, weighted by

high density of seismicity in the Askja-Herubrei region, precluding further simple spatial division.

Swarms were identified based on analysis of both seismicity and seismic moment release rate 
(e.g. sharp steps in Figures 3.13 and 3.15), and their spatial and temporal extent were determined by 
visual inspection of the frames that make up Movie C.1, digitised to form polygons using the 
WebPlotDigitizer tool (Rohatgi, 2020). Events were then cropped from the catalogue without 
replacement. This process is illustrated in Figure 5.2. 
Figure 5.2: Illustration of the swarm selection process. Map view: red polygon delineates the cropped region 
for a seismic swarm in March-April 2013, with seismicity between 2013/03/03 and 2013/03/14 shown by dots: 
red mark selected earthquakes; black are contemporaneous background earthquakes (not yet associated with 
any other swarm). 
5.1.1 Comparison of swarm and background seismicity 
In order to maintain a consistent cut-off point, only swarms with more than three earthquakes of ML  
1 were retained for relocation. This resulted in the generation of a further 67 sub-catalogues, each 
representing a single swarm, and containing a total of 47,607 events. Figure 5.3 shows that the north-
south and northeast-southwest striking lineations of high earthquake density apparent in Figure 5.1 
are accentuated in the swarm catalogue, as expected based on inspection of Movie C.1. This leaves 
a further 53,017 background events, which, in contrast, are spread more diffusely across the region. 
Intriguingly, their depth distributions also appear to be distinct, with the background seismicity largely 
concentrated at around 4 km depth, while the peak density of swarm earthquakes is generally 
shallower. 
Figure 5.4: Depth distribution of swarm and background earthquakes. (a): kernel-density estimate (KDE) of 
earthquake depths; (b) KDE weighted by moment release; (c) KDE plot showing occurrence of swarm 
earthquakes, binned by local magnitude (ML); (d) as for (c) for background seismicity. Note that spikes in (a), 
(c) and (d) correspond to the QuakeMigrate grid node spacing used in Locate (1 km). Black solid and purple 
dotted lines mark the average surface elevation and (apparent) brittle-ductile transition depths, respectively. 
This is explored in more detail in Figure 5.4, which reveals that though the (unweighted) distribution 
of earthquake occurrences shows substantial overlap between the two catalogues, when the seismic 
moment release is considered, they are clearly separated in depth. Furthermore, this does not appear 
to be due to a systematic bias in the depth estimates of large magnitude events, which are significantly 
more numerous in the swarm catalogue, and which account for a disproportionate share of the 
moment release: both large and small earthquakes in the background catalogue are concentrated at 
depth. Upon closer inspection, it appears that the swarm catalogue itself is somewhat segregated in 
depth, with most small earthquakes happening at a similar depth to the background seismicity, while 
the larger events are strongly concentrated in the shallow-most crust. Again, contrasting this with the 
background seismicity lends confidence that it is not due to a location bias as a function of magnitude.  
5.2  Waveform cross-correlation 
In order to more precisely resolve the spatial distribution of the swarm seismicity, as well as 
earthquakes in the largest spatial groups, I cross-correlate earthquake waveforms within each sub-
catalogue to calculate differential travel-times for use in a relative relocation algorithm. The primary 
goal is therefore to obtain precise and accurate measurements of relative first-arrival times for both P 
and S-wave phase arrivals. Two inputs are required: an estimate of the phase arrival time for each 
station and phase for each event (used to select a window around the arrival within which to cross-
correlate the waveforms) and cut waveforms for each event. 
5.2.1 Phase arrival picks 
QuakeMigrate provides two classes of phase arrival time estimates. Modelled phase arrival times 
calculated from the hypocentre location (which is derived purely from the migration analysis) and 
traveltime lookup table  are output for every station and phase. This includes cases where the data 
for a given station did not pass the specified quality check (in this case perfectly continuous data; 
section 3.2.5), or were absent altogether. In addition, I elected to output automatic phase picks, 
derived from fitting a Gaussian function to the phase onset function where it exceeded an adaptive 
threshold level within the picking window (itself derived from the modelled arrival time); see sections 
2.4 and 3.2.5. 
There are advantages and disadvantages associated with each option. Using modelled phase 
arrival times allows differential traveltimes to be calculated where an automatic pick couldnt be made, 
but the phase arrival was still recorded; for example due to a nearby data gap. However, it doesnt 
provide any distinction between these cases, and those where a pick couldnt (and, perhaps, 
shouldnt) be made due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. Background noise recorded over short periods 
of time is liable to correlate strongly in some cases, returning spurious differential travel-time 
measurements potentially with high correlation coefficients, and therefore difficult to recognise and 
remove. These outliers can strongly degrade the relative relocation results (Woods, 2019). In light of 
this, and the generally excellent automatic picking performance observed over a small sample of the 
catalogue (both in timing, and in electing whether or not a pick was there to be made), I elected to 
use the automatic picks. As mentioned in section 3.2.5, this will notably lead to arrival data (and 
waveforms) being discarded during periods where IMO stations were only recording event waveforms, 
but on the whole is expected to produce significantly more robust measurements. 
5.2.2 Waveform data 
For both the long-lived seismic swarm at Upptyppingar and the near-continuous seismicity in the 
skjuvatn cluster (red and green, respectively, in Figures 3.13 and 5.1), event waveforms will 
potentially be strongly correlated over timespans of more than a decade. However, the temporary 
nature of the Cambridge network has meant that though many stations have operated over much of 
the 13 year study period, in many cases the sensors have been swapped in and out during that time 
(Appendix A). This is also the case in the IMO network, though to a lesser extent. In order to minimise 
the impact of this, I use instrument-corrected (velocity) waveforms, also output automatically by 
QuakeMigrate. This is expected to be beneficial because though all sensors in the network feature 
flat amplitude response curves over the frequency band used here (2.0  20 Hz), their phase response 
curves  likely more important in calculating differential first arrival times  vary subtly between 
sensors (particularly when comparing, for example, a 6TD and a 3TD, which have significantly 
different response characteristics  see section 3.1.2). 
Waveform data headers are populated with arrival time information, resampled to a common 
sampling rate of 100 Hz (using a Lanczos interpolation scheme to up-sample, where required) and 
converted to SAC format, necessary for compatibility with MATLAB. Only waveforms for which the 
corresponding automatic pick had been made are retained for cross-correlation (P for vertical; S for 
horizontal component data). 
5.2.3 Waveform cross-correlation 
Cross-correlations are calculated using the correlation toolkit provided within the GISMO software 
suite (Reyes and West, 2011). Waveforms for each station and component are tapered, filtered using 
a 2.0 - 20 Hz Butterworth bandpass filter, and cross-correlated against waveforms from all other 
events in the same swarm, in a 2.5 s window starting 0.5 s before the automatic pick. A polynomial 
interpolation scheme is used to provide sub-sample precision. Where waveforms correlate above a 
coefficient of 0.7 (taken as an absolute value; so similar waveforms with opposite polarities are also 
considered), and the lag time (time shift required to align the waveforms) is less than 0.5 s, the 
differential travel-time measurement and correlation coefficient are saved. Two S-wave differential 
time measurements may thus be made for a single station and event pair. Where this occurs, that 
with the higher correlation coefficient is retained, or, if they are equal, the mean is used if the 
measurements agree within 0.02 seconds. Otherwise, both are discarded. 
The quality of the QuakeMigrate automatic picks is emphasised in Figure 5.5, which shows traces 
aligned first against the picks, and then re-aligned according to the lag times calculated by cross-
correlation. That the sharp vertical lines are also clearly apparent where the waveforms are aligned 
by the automatic picks suggests they are consistent to within at most one quarter of the dominant 
signal period; here ~ 0.025 seconds. The striking consistency of the waveforms also indicates the 
quality of the differential travel-times measured above this correlation coefficient cut-off (0.7).

S-wave phase arrivals aligned by QuakeMigrate automatic picks (top); and according to the maximum 
correlation coefficient (bottom). Waveforms recorded on the North component of station MKO, with minimum 
inter-cluster correlation coefficient 0.7. Note consistent coda waveforms out to high lag times. 
5.3 Relative relocation with GrowClust 
Within each swarm or group of earthquakes, refined locations are calculated using the GrowClust 
algorithm (Trugman and Shearer, 2017). This differs from hypoDD (Waldhauser and Ellsworth, 2000) 
 a second widely used relative relocation technique  in the way that it approaches the problem of 
QUAKEMIGRATE PICKS 
CROSS-CORRELATION 
Figure 5.6: Schematic illustration of the hybrid hierarchical clustering and relative relocation approach 
implemented within the GrowClust algorithm. In (a) through (e) events (circles) linked by high quality differential 
travel-time data (lines, numbered sequentially by waveform similarity) are considered pairwise and relocated 
about their common centroid, each time forming an expanded cluster. In (f)-(g) a third event is added to the first 
multi-event cluster, again relocated about their common centroid, while the relative positions of the previously 
relocated events are held fixed. In (h) and (i) the two multi-event clusters are merged and relocated in the same 
manner, producing the final locations. Event B is left at its original location, as it was not sufficiently strongly 
linked to any other event. In all cases the relocations are performed according to the gradients in the relative 
traveltimes between the pairs of events or clusters being considered, so, where most of the source-receiver ray-
path is shared, they are largely insensitive to velocity structure outside their vicinity, mitigating the effects of un-
modelled heterogeneities elsewhere. Reproduced from Trugman and Shearer (2017). 
building a chain of strongly linked events, and iteratively inverting for their optimal relative hypocentre 
distribution. Instead of constructing a sparse matrix of differential times across all events, applying 
subdivision into clusters where the linking criteria are not met, GrowClust applies a hierarchical 
clustering analysis based on the waveform similarity of event pairs (Figure 5.6). This has several 
advantages, as outlined in detail by Trugman and Shearer (2017), including providing the opportunity 
to employ an L1 norm as the misfit function, which is significantly less sensitive to outliers than the 
matrix inversion based on least-squares misfit criteria (L2 norm) applied within hypoDD (see also 
section 4.1). In addition, the hierarchical clustering approach provides a significantly more robust 
solution to assessing the quality of linkages throughout the chain of hypocentres, which can often 
lead to unstable solutions in hypoDD (Trugman and Shearer, 2017). Finally, from a pragmatic 
standpoint, though a large number of tools are made available to the user to help stabilise the 
inversion within hypoDD  particularly necessary in the case of earthquake clusters extending over 
large distances  to optimise them for clusters varying over the range of sizes, densities and number 
and quality of observations considered here is not practical. 
The only significant disadvantage is that, due to the nature of the approach, GrowClust is built to 
run solely on differential traveltime data derived from cross-correlation analysis. Large earthquakes 
tend to have significantly more distinct waveforms, and are far fewer in number, generally making it 
difficult to obtain sufficient high quality differential time measurements to successfully calculate 
relocations. This limitation is more than compensated for by the advantages of using GrowClust, but 
means that the locations of large earthquakes, even if relocated, should be treated with caution. 
Given the number and quality of differential time measurements available, I choose to use the 
squared, instead of the raw, correlation coefficient, to increase the relative weighting of the best 
measurements. Their absolute values are also affected by the length of the cross-correlation windows 
and bandpass filter used, amongst other factors, and are not considered internally (Trugman and 
Shearer, 2017). I use the same 1D gradient velocity model described in section 3.2.1, though within 
the GrowClust traveltime calculation routines station elevations are not taken into account. Instead, 
internally, the velocity model and hypocentre depths are shifted according to the mean elevation of 
the stations, before being shifted back upon output of location results. I use the default parameters 
provided with the code1, which are relatively insensitive to the problem. 
5.3.1 Location uncertainty analysis 
GrowClust features a bootstrapping routine with which to calculate location uncertainty estimates; the 
results from a representative swarm in the Askja-Herubrei region are displayed in Figure 5.7. This 
analysis indicates that the excellent quality of input differential traveltimes and network geometry lead 
to exceptionally tightly constrained relative earthquake hypocentres. Relative location uncertainties 
for swarms in each region are summarised in Table 5.2; those in the group west of Askja are notably 
far less well constrained, corresponding to the inferior network geometry and drastically lower density 
of earthquakes with which to form chains of strongly-linked events. Relatively large uncertainties are 
also reported for swarms in northwest Askja, but due to being relocated in a single large group, rather 
than separately for individual swarms of (densely spaced, highly similar) events, this estimate is not 
representative. Instead, as I am primarily considering the geometry of lineations associated with 
individual swarms, the spread of uncertainties within the swarm is more informative. This returns only 
slightly larger values than are reported in the Askja-Herubrei region (Table 5.2). 
The clusters of seismicity at skjuvatn and Upptyppingar, and the largest swarms in the Askja-
Herubrei region, are too large for it to be practical to run sufficient bootstrap samples (with runtimes 
1 https://github.com/dttrugman/GrowClust (accessed February 2021) 
of 4 - 12 hours to return a single set of locations from the full dataset). However, given the 
exceptionally high density of seismicity in each, and the extremely large number of differential time 
observations considered (some 51.6 million for the Upptyppingar cluster, for 6,581 events), the 
uncertainties are likely to be even lower than those for the typical Askja-Herubrei swarms.

Note that the locations of the cluster centroids are still determined by the input absolute locations 
derived from QuakeMigrate, which, based on the comparison with manually refined earthquake 
hypocentres analysed in Chapter 4, are typically likely to be accurate to within approximately 200 m 
in epicentral location, and 500 m in depth. 
5.4  Location results 
Figures 5.8 displays the dramatic improvement in resolution achieved by relative relocation of the swarm 
seismicity between Askja and Herubrei. Sharply defined lineations are revealed by the relocated 
hypocentres, with each generally corresponding to an individual earthquake swarm. This is particularly 
important for understanding the fault structure and geometry in the southwest, where faults are generally 
shorter and so not possible to accurately characterise from the scattered absolute locations (left panel).

hypocentres shown by dots, coloured by year of occurrence, and scaled by magnitude. Note that transparency 
is used to help visualise patterns within these 47,607 events. Mean surface elevation (0.6 km) indicated by

The depth distribution of the relocated seismicity is further examined in Figure 5.9, which shows 
that the concentration of larger magnitude events in the shallow-most crust remains after relative 
relocation. The depth distribution of the seismicity will be discussed in Chapter 9 in light of the results 
of analysis presented in the following Chapters of this dissertation.

mean surface elevation. Note that all 5 events in the ML ~ 4 bin are reported as relocated, though as discussed 
previously should be interpreted with caution. 
Figure 5.10: Relative relocation results for earthquakes in the northwest Askja group. Earthquake hypocentres 
displayed as in Figure 5.8. Note the sharply delineated swarms (each from a single year) and more diffuse, 
continuous seismicity at the caldera rim, co-located with hydrothermal activity at the surface (black arrow). 
Exceptional resolution is also achieved for the seismicity in northwest Askja, at skjuvatn, and 
particularly in the Upptyppingar cluster, where structures with dimensions of less than 10 metres are 
sharply defined. Similar location comparisons are presented for these regions in Figures 5.10  5.12. 
In contrast, though the group of seismicity west of Askja was successfully relocated, the low density 
of events significantly limits the resolution attained (Table 5.2). This may be addressed in future by 
applying template matching to increase the completeness of the catalogue;  searching within 
continuous waveform records from long-running stations for similar events not successfully detected 
and located by QuakeMigrate. Based on the extremely high waveform similarity seen within other 
swarms across the region, this would be likely to produce a considerably more complete catalogue, 
which would significantly improve the relocation results. 
Figure 5.11: Relative relocation results for earthquakes in the skjuvatn cluster. Earthquake hypocentres 
shown as in previous figures. Black lines in map view (top panels) show the outlines of the nested Askja 
calderas, and Lake skjuvatn. Note the extremely tightly clustered seismicity at the southeast, which occurs 
continuously throughout 2007-2020, and is co-located with surface manifestations of hydrothermal activity (red 
arrow). In contrast, two sharp ENE-striking lineations are resolved further east, which occurred as discrete 
swarms in 2008 and 2014 (indicated by black arrows). Further small clusters of seismicity, generally around the 
perimeter of Lake skjuvatn (closed black line), are also associated with surface geothermal activity. 
Where the relocations were successful, the sharp images of the earthquake locations begin to 
reveal new details of both the fault structure and spatiotemporal evolution of seismicity. For example, 
the short-lived seismic swarms observed between Askja and Herubrei show a striking spatial 
complementarity, with little overlap between sequential swarms (Figure 5.8). In contrast, though they 
also collectively define clear lineations, the earthquakes observed in the much longer-lived swarm at 
Upptyppingar have a more complex spatiotemporal evolution, with significant overlap between 
seismicity occurring in different years (Figure 5.12). The most significant overlap, however, is seen in 
the exceedingly dense cluster of seismicity at the southeast of Lake skjuvatn (Figure 5.11), which 
shares some similarities with the cluster of seismicity at the northwest rim of Askja caldera (Figure 
5.10). In the latter two cases, linear clusters of seismicity are also observed, which, similarly to those 
delineated by swarms between Askja and Herubrei, occur discretely in time. 
Figure 5.12: Relative relocation results for earthquake swarms in the Upptyppingar cluster. Earthquake 
hypocentres shown as in previous figures. Note that the depths of the QuakeMigrate catalogue locations are 
tightly clustered about the relocated distribution, indicating depth estimates are accurate to within ~ 500 m.  
Though hints of these characteristics were provided by the QuakeMigrate locations displayed in 
Movie C.1, only now can their true nature be resolved. In Chapter 6, the geometry of the network of 
faults revealed by these relocations will be investigated in the context of the regional deformation 
pattern as revealed by geodetic measurements. The spatiotemporal evolution of seismicity during 
several of the best-resolved swarms within the Askja Herubrei region will be investigated in Chapter 
7, and compared to other examples of migrating earthquake swarms seen in Iceland and across the 
globe, as well as the features expected from a range of possible transient driving forces. The results 
of all analyses will be discussed together in Chapter 9, and combined with all available knowledge of 
the geological structure and volcano-tectonic history of the region, the likely hydrological conditions 
in the subsurface, and their potential relation to the deep seismicity described in Chapter 3. 
Figure 5.13: Correlation matrix illustrating waveform similarity through time for the same swarm as in Figure 
5.5. Colour of each cell corresponds to the maximum correlation coefficient between waveforms from each 
given pair of events in the swarm, recorded on the East component of station MKO (Figure 3.1). 
5.5  Temporal evolution of seismicity in the skjuvatn cluster  
As well as the differential traveltime data, the cross-correlation analysis outputs information about the 
temporal occurrence of similar earthquakes. This can be viewed most clearly in correlation matrices; 
Figure 5.13 shows waveforms from the same May 2014 swarm displayed in Figure 5.5, indicating 
generally highly similar waveforms throughout  noting that this plot includes more than 10,600 events 
over a period of 4 months. There is a clear period of distinct seismicity around 13th May 2014, which 
corresponds to concurrent swarm seismicity on a conjugate fault at the north of the main north-striking 
fault plane (Movie C.1 and Chapter 7). 
The correlation matrix displayed in Figure 5.13 is typical of that for most swarms in the Askja-
Herubrei area. In contrast, at Lake skjuvatn clusters of earthquakes grouped by waveform 
similarity show a remarkable seasonality over the 13 year extent of the study period (Figure 5.14). 
These families of events with similar waveforms could be partitioned between seasonally occurring 
clusters for several reasons, broadly grouped into variability in the properties of the earthquake 
source, or of the medium encountered along the source-receiver ray-path. 
Figure 5.14: Seasonal occurrence of families of events with similar waveforms in the skjuvatn cluster. Left 
panel shows histograms of event occurrence through time (from 2010-2020; see ticks on bottom row). Time 
periods corresponding broadly to summer and winter months are shaded orange and blue, respectively. Right 
shows waveforms for a sample of events (grey) overlain by the stack over all waveforms in the cluster (black). 
Waveforms recorded for P-wave arrivals on the vertical component of station FLAT. 
Families of events could be distinguished simply by focal mechanism, driven, for example, by local 
rotation of the principal stress axes linked to seasonal surface loading (Drouin et al., 2017; Donaldson 
et al., 2019). However, Rendle (2017) found no clear seasonal signal from studying focal mechanisms 
of a (small) sample of manually analysed events. Initial comparison between the fault plane solutions 
of these events and the clusters in which they occur suggests the story is either more nuanced, or 
that variability in earthquake source mechanisms is not the primary cause.  
Earthquakes in this region are thought to be dominantly associated with hydrothermal activity, and 
annual variation in the depth of the supercritical point of the mixed aqueous fluids therein, due to 
changes in the pore-pressure gradient and/or from surface loading, may therefore affect the depth of 
seismicity. As mentioned in section 5.1, location changes of only one quarter of a wavelength (in this 
case ~ 75 m, for their ~ 10 Hz dominant frequency in the cross-correlation window; Figure 5.14) might 
lead to a measurable reduction in waveform similarity. Analysis of the variation in hypocentral depth 
through time, however, shows only a long-term trend towards increasing depth, while no long-term 
partitioning of families is observed over the duration of the study period (Figure 5.15). This suggests 
that the 50-100 m amplitude of the depth change seen over the course of 2007-2020 is not significantly 
larger than the length-scale of the first Fresnel zone, which is compatible with the 75 m estimate from 
their source frequency and the expected seismic velocities in the source region. Any annual variability 
 which is not apparent on visual inspection  must therefore be on a length-scale significantly smaller 
than the first Fresnel zone, and would therefore be highly unlikely to cause the observed sharp 
seasonal division in the occurrence of earthquake families. 
Figure 5.15: Long-term trend in the depths of earthquakes in the skjuvatn cluster. Earthquakes shown by blue 
dots, scaled by magnitude (n=7,470; only earthquakes from the dense sub-cluster are included  see Figure 
5.11). Mean depth over the study period is shown by orange line; green line shows a 3rd order polynomial fit to 
the depths. Note that long-term depth change is ~ 50-100 m, similar to the 75 m estimate for the first Fresnel 
zone. 
As well as variations at the earthquake source, the observed seasonal variation in earthquake 
waveform similarity could also be influenced by seasonal changes to the surrounding medium. Strong 
seasonal variations in relative crustal seismic velocity (dv/v) have been observed in this region using 
ambient noise interferometry (Donaldson et al., 2019), and indeed this is visually apparent upon 
inspection of the coda of families of similar waveforms from the skjuvatn cluster (Figure 5.16). 
However, for the waveforms to be significantly altered in the vicinity of the direct phase arrivals would 
be more unusual, though potentially extremely useful in constraining the spatial distribution of any 
changes in the medium, due to their significantly narrower sensitivity kernels. It might, for example, 
reveal strong local changes in the velocity structure associated with 1-2 m seasonal fluctuations 
observed in the lake level in skjuvatn (Tryggvason 1989a,b; de Zeeuw-van Dalfsen et al., 2013). 
Figure 5.16: Apparent seasonal variations in coda wave velocity observed from similar earthquake waveforms. 
Waveforms from a family of earthquakes with similar waveforms, identified by cross-correlation, and plotted 
aligned by the cross-correlation derived lag time. Traces are ordered by date of occurrence (labelled on y-axis). 
Horizontal lines highlight apparent changes in coda wave velocity, identified by visual inspection (seen 
particularly clearly between 4-6 seconds lag time). P- and S-wave phase arrivals highlighted by vertical dashed 
lines. Waveforms recorded on the vertical component of station DREK. 
To comprehensively investigate this striking observation will require more detailed analysis of the 
earthquakes that make up the families seen at individual stations. For example, changes in the source 
(whether a binary change in mechanism, or a more subtle difference) might be expected to affect the 
waveforms recorded at all stations, though potentially to varying degrees depending on their location 
on the focal sphere. If consistent families of earthquakes are identified from observations across the 
network, P-wave polarity picks made on the stacked waveforms (Figure 5.14) will provide a method 
to quickly and efficiently construct fault plane solutions for each, and also allow observations to be 
made at stations where the signal-to-noise ratio might otherwise be too low to make picks on 
waveforms from individual events. Seasonal variations in the medium might also lead to consistent 
differences in waveforms across the network, but may also be influenced by spatially heterogeneous 
patterns in the pore-pressure and elastic loading variations identified as the primary driving 
mechanisms for the dv/v changes observed by ambient noise interferometry. 
These analyses will form an interesting future investigation, but are not attempted within this 
dissertation. However, the observations alone serve to further underline the additional information 
that can be extracted from earthquake waveforms beyond simply phase arrival (and polarity) picks, 
and the potential they have to reveal new features and thereby deliver new understanding of both the 
seismicity and the physical properties of the crust through which their waves travel. 
5.6  Conclusions  
1. Background seismicity in the Askja-Herubrei region exhibits a distinct depth distribution 
from that which occurs during seismic swarms. Within the swarm seismicity, relative 
relocations confirm that there is a systematic bias in the occurrence of larger magnitude 
earthquakes, which dominantly occur in the shallow-most crust. Smaller earthquakes mostly 
occur at 3-4 km b.s.l.; comparable to the depths of the background seismicity (of all 
magnitudes). 
2. Comparison of the alignment of similar waveforms by QuakeMigrate phase picks and by 
maximum correlation coefficient indicate that these automatic picks are likely accurate to 
within ~ 0.025 s, approaching the sampling rate of the data from which they were calculated 
(Chapter 3). These picks are not used in this dissertation, but this level of agreement indicates 
that they may be of sufficient quality for other analyses where picks are required; for example 
as inputs to automatic polarity-picking algorithms (e.g. Pugh et al., 2016) or in body-wave 
travel-time tomography, where traditionally only manual analyst picks have been trusted. 
3. High precision relocations are calculated using the GrowClust algorithm. Reported relative 
location uncertainties are of order ~ 10 m for typical swarms in the Askja-Herubrei region. 
Swarms located towards the northern edge of the network, and those that occurred during 
periods where the network consisted of considerably fewer stations, are still constrained to 
within ~ 100m. 
4. Swarms between Askja and Herubrei delineate sharply defined fault planes, and exhibit 
striking spatial complementarity; there are very few examples of more than one swarm 
occurring on a single fault throughout the 13 year study period. 
5. Seismicity making up the long-lived swarm at Upptyppingar displays a markedly more complex 
spatio-temporal evolution, and is instead tightly clustered at the presumed brittle-ductile 
boundary, though also occurs along tightly-constrained lineations. 
6. Earthquakes in northwest Askja caldera occur in two groups: a near-continuously active area 
of diffuse seismicity directly beneath surface manifestations of geothermal activity at the 
caldera rim (arrow, Figure 5.10), and swarms of earthquakes which define northeast-
southwest and north-south striking lineations to the NNW. Similarly to those in the Askja-
Herubrei area, these occur discretely, and do not overlap. 
7. Seismicity in and around skjuvatn is dominated by an extremely dense cluster of 
earthquakes to the southeast of the lake. This, as well as several smaller clusters around the 
lakes perimeter, is co-located with vigorous hydrothermal activity seen at the surface, and is 
active throughout 2007-2020. In addition, two ENE-striking lineations of seismicity are 
apparent, which occurred in discrete swarms in 2008 and 2014. 
8. The near-continuous seismicity at Lake skjuvatn produces seasonally occurring families of 
similar event waveforms, as observed at individual stations. Initial analysis of the available 
focal mechanisms and of the temporal variation of earthquake depths suggests neither of 
these two potential changes to the earthquake sources provides a simple explanation for the 
partitioning between summer and winter months. Inspection of the coda of similar earthquake 
waveforms reveals seasonal variations in coda-wave velocity, though it is not immediately 
clear if the same changes in the medium which cause this, and seasonal dv/v variations 
observed by ambient noise analysis, could cause sufficient changes within the short window 
around the phase arrivals considered in the cross-correlations performed here to cause such 
clear distinctions between families. This will form the basis for an interesting future study. 
Chapter 6 
An intricate network of strike-slip faults 
The relative relocation results presented in Chapter 5 reveal a complex network of faults that extend 
between Askja and Herubrei. In this Chapter, I combine detailed analysis of their geometry with 
constraints on their coseismic motion from tightly controlled fault plane solutions. Together, these 
reveal the kinematics of this network of faults, and strongly indicate that their geometry is primarily 
controlled by ongoing deflation of a shallow magma reservoir within Askja caldera, together with 
influence from regional plate-boundary extension. I further explore factors which might explain their 
anomalous geometry with respect to the principal stress axes, including the possible roles of 
significant mechanical anisotropy and elevated pore fluid pressures. 
6.1  Motivation and Overview 
Between rifting events, shallow seismicity across Iceland is typically restricted to central volcanoes, 
and particularly their active geothermal areas; upper crustal extension in the inter-rift period is largely 
aseismic (Einarsson and Brandsdttir, 2021). This is true across large parts of the Northern Volcanic 
Zone, with most seismicity occurring in geothermal areas at Kistufell, Kverkfjll, the Skftar cauldrons, 
Grmsvtn, and at the Leirnjkar geothermal field in Krafla. In the region surrounding Askja this is not 
the case, despite its last major rifting episode occurring in 1874-76 (e.g. Brandsdttir, 1992; Hartley 
and Thordarson, 2013), with smaller volcano-tectonic episodes in 1921-33 and 1961 (section 1.3). As 
well as the persistent seismicity at the geothermal areas surrounding Lake skjuvatn (Chapter 5), 
intense earthquake swarms have been observed in the region between Askja and Herubrei since 
the national seismic network was first capable of recording them in the 1980s (Einarsson and 
Smundsson, 1987; Einarsson, 1991; Jakobsdttir, 2008). These earthquakes reveal a complex 
network of faults (Figure 6.1), which appear to be responding to regional deformation during the 
current inter-rift phase. These earthquakes are also unusual in that they occur in the region between 
the Askja and Kverkfjll fissure swarms, which mark the areas where plate spreading is focussed over 
longer timescales (Figures 3.1 & 6.1). 
The results derived from manual analysis of 8 seismic swarms recorded between 2009 and 2012 
have been interpreted as evidence that this region acts as a transform zone associated with the 
northwards termination of the en-echelon Kverkfjll fissure swarm (Figure 6.1; Green et al., 2014). 
They found a set of northeast-southwest striking left-lateral strike-slip faults extending east to west 
between the fissure swarms (Figure 1.6c), which they suggest accommodate east-west right-lateral 
shear, via a bookshelf faulting mechanism. However, further swarms in 2010 (not considered in the 
Green et al. analysis) and 2014 (Fischer-Linnett, 2015) revealed north-south striking right-lateral 
strike-slip faults, which do not fit this model.  
Figure 6.1: Relocated shallow seismicity across the Askja region 2007-2020. Earthquakes are shown by dots, 
coloured by year of occurrence and scaled by magnitude. Topography is shown by grey shading, with fissure 
swarms draped by lighter colours (from northwest to southeast, Fremrinmar, Askja and Kverkfjll; Einarsson 
and Smundsson, 1987). Surface fabric  defined by faults, fractures and fissures visible in the field and from 
aerial imagery  is shown by orange/brown lines (Hjartardttir et al., 2009, 2013; Hjartardttir and Einarsson, 
2012); major lakes and rivers are coloured blue. Seismic stations (2007-2020) are shown by open triangles.

The comprehensive catalogue of relatively relocated seismicity presented in Chapter 5 presents 
the opportunity to make precise measurements of the geometry of this complex network of faults, as 
revealed by 67 earthquake swarms recorded between 2007-2020 (Figure 6.1). By combining them 
with the fault plane solutions derived from previous manual analyses, I comprehensively describe the 
kinematics of faulting across this region. These observations are then compared to geodetic 
observations made within the study area extending back to 1968, to understand the roles of 
deformation caused by plate spreading, isostatic rebound associated with the retreat of the 
Vatnajkull icecap, and long-term deflation in Askja caldera (Drouin et al., 2017; Sturkell et al., 2006; 
de Zeeuw-van Dalfsen et al., 2013). 
6.2 Fault plane solutions 
I use a subset of the catalogue of high-quality manually refined earthquake first-arrival observations 
collated in Chapter 4 to calculate fault plane solutions for earthquakes throughout the region around 
Askja. Only those with at least 8 P-wave first arrival observations are considered, leaving 1,548 
events. These are inverted for fault plane solutions using the Bayesian moment tensor inversion 
software MTfit (Pugh and White, 2018), according to take-off angles derived from the absolute 
earthquake locations calculated using NonLinLoc (section 4.1). 
Figure 6.2: MTfit fault plane solution plots. (a) shows an example of an event where the picked polarities are 
self-consistent, but the solution is ambiguous; in contrast the moment tensor in (b) is exceptionally tightly 
constrained. P-wave first motion polarity observations (red circle = compressional; blue triangle = dilatational) 
and nodal planes for a subset of the explored double-couple solutions are plotted on lower hemisphere 
projections. Nodal planes are coloured by posterior probability (darker colours are better fitting), with the 
maximum probability solution coloured purple. Only tightly constrained solutions (e.g. b) are used herein. 
Of these, 1,545 were successfully inverted for fault plane solutions, searching only within the 
double-couple parameter space. MTfit employs a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo approach to efficiently 
explore the range of double-couple moment tensors which may fit the data, in each case using a 
Bayesian approach to combine observations and their uncertainties (inferred from the timing 
uncertainty assigned by the analyst for each pick) to calculate a posterior probability for that solution 
fitting the data. This provides the means to visualise the constraint on the best-fitting solution; a 
feature not included in most commonly-used moment tensor inversion software. Examples of a typical 
ambiguous event and a tightly constrained fault plane solution are displayed in Figure 6.2. I manually 
review each fault plane solution and assign it to one of these two categories, or reject it if the picked 
polarities are not self-consistent. Only the 831 highest quality, tightly constrained and unambiguous 
fault plane solutions are retained for the analysis presented in the remainder of this Chapter. 
6.2.1 Identifying the fault plane 
I combine the manually derived fault plane solutions with my automatically generated catalogue of 
relatively relocated seismicity in order to distinguish the two nodal planes. Where events occur along 
a lineation of seismicity, the fault plane can be straightforwardly identified as that which is parallel to 
the earthquake hypocentres. This analysis is carried out manually, with the process illustrated in 
Figure 6.3. 
Figure 6.3: Fault plane identification procedure. Moment tensors are shown in map view plotted as lower-
hemisphere beach ball projections (using the maximum probability solution; Figure 6.2), and coloured 
according the mechanism implied by the 1st nodal plane output by MTfit. Relocated seismicity plotted as black 
dots; events within +/- 10 days of the event in question are plotted in pink. Taking the 1st nodal plane to be the 
fault plane in (a) indicates left-lateral strike-slip (green); in agreement with the strike of the lineation of 
hypocentres in which it occurs. In contrast, in (b) the 1st nodal plane implies right-lateral strike-slip (red), which 
does not agree with the relocated seismicity. The user enters 1 or 2 to record this. The EventID, the 
strike/dip/rake of both nodal planes and quality/relocation statistics are shown in red text. 
Events between Askja and Herubrei, at Upptyppingar, and from the linear swarms of events east 
of Lake skjuvatn and northwest Askja caldera (Figure 6.1) are generally well-constrained and feature 
one nodal plane which strikes parallel to the relocated seismicity. This leaves a final catalogue of 667 
tightly-controlled fault plane solutions where the fault plane can be confidently identified. 
6.2.2 Results 
The resulting catalogue of moment tensors is displayed in Figure 6.4, coloured by mechanism as in 
Figure 6.3. Across the entire region, excellent agreement is observed between the fault plane 
orientation determined from focal mechanisms and from the lineations of relocated seismicity (see 
inset panels in Figure 6.4). The fault plane solutions show that, as found by previous authors, 
earthquakes in this region occur dominantly on a network of vertically dipping strike-slip faults.  
Figure 6.4: Fault plane solutions, coloured by mechanism. Relocated seismicity is plotted as black dots, with 
667 tightly constrained fault plane solutions (FPS) shown by beachballs, positioned according to the relocations. 
Red = right-lateral, green = left-lateral strike-slip; yellow = normal; blue = reverse. (a) and (b) highlight two 
regions discussed in the text. Only FPS where the fault plane could be determined unambiguously are included. 
Herubrei 
Figure 6.5: Fault plane solution P- and T-axes. (a)-(d) show P and T-axis azimuth and plunge for fault plane 
solutions from the skjuvatn and Askja-Herubrei region; (e) and (f) show similar plots for fault plane solutions 
from earthquakes in the Upptyppingar cluster. Note the significantly rotated P and T-axis azimuths in the 
Upptyppingar cluster, and the hint of a systematic rotation with latitude seen in (c) and (d).  
In the middle latitudes, both left-lateral and right-lateral faults are seen, forming cross-cutting 
conjugate fault pairs oriented perpendicular to the plate spreading direction (Figures 6.4b, 6.5); 
measured locally at 112 in this region (Drouin et al., 2017). However, in the region between Askja 
and Herubrei, seismicity further north is dominated by northeast-southwest striking left-lateral 
strike-slip faulting, while the north-south right-lateral half of the conjugate pair are most prevalent in 
the south. This pattern is interrupted by the focal mechanisms from the Upptyppingar swarm 
seismicity (labelled). There, right-lateral faulting at a strike of ~ 025 is observed; parallel to the rift 
fabric in this area as measured from surface features (Hjartardttir and Einarsson, 2012). In northwest 
Askja, the focal mechanisms show the opposite pattern to Askja-Herubrei, with left-lateral faulting 
at the south, and right-lateral faulting further north. 
Upon closer inspection of the relocated seismicity, it is also evident that there is a systematic 
rotation of the strikes of lineations from south to north, within both the right-lateral and left-lateral fault 
sets. This is particularly visible at the northern extreme of the Askja-Herubrei region (Figures 6.1 & 
6.4), though there are no fault plane solutions from this area, and few from the most rotated right-
lateral faults at the far south. 
6.3 Fault geometry and motion from relative relocations 
Given the excellent agreement between focal mechanisms and relocations where both are available, 
I extend my observations of the fault network geometry by inferring the fault plane strikes and 
mechanisms directly from the relocations. Lineations of hypocentres are manually recorded by tracing 
the relatively relocated seismicity, and assigned a mechanism based on their strikes, and as indicated 
by focal mechanisms where they are available. This approach is justified by the highly consistent 
pattern within groups of earthquakes of each given mechanism (Figure 6.4).  
Figure 6.6: Fault geometries and mechanisms inferred from relative relocations. Traced faults are shown by 
lines, coloured by inferred mechanism. Relocated seismicity is plotted beneath in black. Black lines delineate 
the nested Askja calderas and Lake skjuvatn. 
The relocations pick out a highly intricate network of strike-slip faults, with particularly fine details 
observed in the region surrounding the cross-cutting conjugate faults (Figure 6.6). The strike of these 
vertically-dipping faults is ~ 010 close to Askja, where right-lateral faulting dominates. Within this 
group (red on Figure 6.6) the strike of individual faults gradually rotates anti-clockwise through space 
moving from south to north; reaching ~ 000 in the cross-cutting region. Similarly, the southernmost 
Herubrei 
of the left-lateral faults (green) strike at ~ 060, while faults at the north strike at ~ 020, with a 
systematic trend in the intervening 20 km.  
In the range of latitudes where the right- and left-lateral faults overlap, their strikes are mirrored 
about the rift fabric; left-lateral faults strike ~ 20 clockwise of it, and right-lateral faults anti-clockwise 
(Figure 6.7). Towards the north and south, their strikes rotate gradually towards the strike of the 
surface fabric, converging to become parallel with it, within error, in both cases (see also Figure 6.1). 
The extent of the rotation is clearest from the left-lateral strike slip faults, which persist over the full 
range of latitudes and exhibit a total rotation of approximately 40. In contrast, the right-lateral faults 
seen at Upptyppingar strike sub-parallel to the rift fabric (blue on Figure 6.7).

6.6)  shown by plus symbols and dots, respectively, coloured by (inferred) mechanism. FPS and inferred fault 
strikes from the Upptyppingar cluster are coloured light blue. Surface rift fabric in the Askja and Kverkfjll fissure 
swarms shown by orange and brown dashed lines, respectively, with indicative uncertainty range shaded (from 
Hjartardttir et al., 2009, 2013). Faults delineated by seismicity in northwest Askja are omitted for clarity. 
6.4  Discussion 
6.4.1 Inferring kinematics from faulting 
Fault plane solutions record the instantaneous coseismic strain during an earthquake. They thus 
provide only a snapshot of the overall deformation, which may also involve, for example, slip on 
conjugate faults (as seen here), or slower, potentially aseismic processes such as large-scale block 
rotation. Inferring the deformation field from seismicity should thus be approached with caution. 
Indeed, Green et al. (2014) previously suggested that a combination of left-lateral faulting and block 
rotation may accommodate larger scale right-lateral shear between the Askja and Kverkfjll rift 
segments (Figure 1.6). However, considering the new observations made here, this mechanism now 
seems highly unlikely. 
The seismicity triggered by the Upptyppingar dike intrusion can be well explained by slip along the 
regional rift fabric (Figures 6.1, 6.4 & 6.7). The strike of fault planes recorded by fault plane solutions 
and relocated seismicity is consistent with fractures and fissures measured at the surface, and the 
slip vectors match those predicted by calculating the static stress change induced by the dike 
(Martens and White, 2013). There was a significant delay between the cessation of dike inflation and 
the initiation of this years-long seismic swarm, but this can be well-explained by the time taken for 
magmatic fluids to diffuse upwards from the intrusion, which together with positive Coulomb stress 
changes brought these faults to failure. 
The orientation of these faults provides a useful marker against which to compare the nearby 
shallow faults, which, in contrast, strike 5 - 15 clockwise of the surface fabric. Therefore, unless there 
has been significant differential rotation of the upper and lower crust, this does not fit the bookshelf-
faulting model; else the Upptyppingar faults would also be rotated. Elsewhere in Iceland  most 
notably in the South Iceland Seismic Zone  bookshelf faults are found striking sub-parallel to the rift 
fabric. This includes areas where both are misaligned relative to structures outside the transform 
zone, suggesting they have rotated coherently (e.g. Steigerwald et al., 2020). In addition, conjugate 
faults would not be expected to undergo rotation over time. It follows that if the dominantly left-lateral 
faulting at the north of the study region were accommodating right-lateral shear by clockwise block 
rotation, those faults should be rotated clockwise relative to the conjugate fault sets. However, here 
the opposite is seen. Differential spreading between rift segments also fails to provide an explanation 
for the right-lateral faulting seen further south, and its similar systematic variation in strike with latitude. 
I infer that there has not been significant block rotation in this region, and cautiously interpret the 
fault motion indicated by the fault plane solutions as representative of the longer term deformation 
field (over at least years to decades). It is instructive, then, to examine the rotation of T-axes implied 
by the rotation of fault strikes (Figure 6.8). This clearly illustrates that opposite senses of rotation are 
observed at the west and east of Askja caldera (blue best-fit lines, Figure 6.8). Furthermore, the 
pattern of left- and right-lateral strike slip faulting with latitude is reversed. Together, these results 
strongly imply a significant role of radial extension about Askja caldera. The differing gradient in T-
axis azimuth variation with latitude also suggests that the focus of this radial deformation is located 
closer to the seismicity in northwest Askja, leading to a larger change in the azimuth to the focus of 
deformation with a given change in latitude. This is consistent with the deformation source being 
located within Askja caldera. 
Figure 6.8: Variation of inferred T-axis azimuth with latitude. T-axes from fault plane solutions (plus symbols) 
and inferred from relocations (dots) from faults at northwest Askja, skjuvatn and in the Askja-Herubrei 
region, coloured by mechanism. Plate spreading vector shown by orange dashed line (Drouin et al., 2017). 
Azimuth is wrapped around 180 so that seismicity in northwest Askja can be distinguished. Note the opposite 
sense of variation in strike with latitude, and opposite distribution of left-lateral and right-lateral faulting with 
latitude. In both cases T-axes from right-lateral faults strike clockwise from the extension direction. Inferred 
trends in the T-axes are illustrated by light and dark-blue lines. Note that in the mid latitudes the deformation is 
variably partitioned between left-lateral and right-lateral faulting, with each set of faults consistently oriented 
symmetrically about the spreading direction. 
6.4.2 Deformation field from geodesy 
Drouin et al. (2017) analysed GPS measurements from a dense network of campaign benchmarks in 
the Northern Volcanic Zone from 2008-2014; a period with no significant volcanic activity or magmatic 
intrusions. They found that the deformation field in the present study region could be explained by a 
combination of plate spreading, isostatic rebound associated with retreat of the Vatnajkull icecap, 
and a shallow volcanic deflation source in Askja caldera (summarised in Figure 6.9). 
Figure 6.9: Deformation field in the Northern Volcanic zone from GPS. From left to right, panels show: observed 
average horizontal motion; modelled deformation field from plate spreading (plate boundary modelled as shown 
by green lines); from isostatic rebound surrounding the Vatnajkull icecap; and from volcanic deflation sources 
in Askja caldera (bottom) and Krafla, top - red arrows indicate horizontal motion relative to the Eurasian plate. 
Dashed lines outline central volcanoes; fissure swarms are shaded grey, and Vatnajkull is marked by black 
outline, bottom. Black box outlines the study region. Modified after Drouin et al. (2017). 
Only the model for deflation at a shallow point source in Askja caldera predicts significant radial 
variation in the deformation field within the study region (Figure 6.9), suggesting that it plays a pivotal 
role in generating the deformation field responsible for the contrasting faulting seen at either side of 
Askja caldera. However, the combined gradients in the plate spreading and isostatic rebound velocity 
fields also contribute to the rotating strain field observed within the study region, suggesting this 
interaction may also play a role. 
In contrast, negligible extension is observed across the Kverkfjll rift segment over this time period, 
suggesting that even if there may once have been a significant transform zone at its northern 
termination, it is unlikely to be active at the present day. This is also supported by evidence from field 
mapping of surface features in the Kverkfjll fissure swarm: Hjartardttir and Einarsson (2012) report 
that northwest-southeast striking surface fractures, which might imply large-scale transform motion 
across the en-echelon stepping fissure swarms at the north of the study area, are overprinted by 
MODEL: Plate Spreading MODEL: Isostatic rebound OBSERVED: Average 
horizontal 
MODEL: Volcanic deflation 
younger, rift-parallel extensional fractures, suggesting that the transform motion may have pre-dated 
even the last significant phase of volcanism and rifting at the beginning of the Holocene (Hjartardttir 
and Einarsson, 2012; Figure 6.1). 
6.4.3  Temporal evolution of deformation and seismicity 
At least two types of analysis may help further distinguish the roles of the deformation fields caused 
by the shallow deflation source in Askja caldera and from isostatic rebound driven by melting of the 
Vatnajkull ice sheet in driving the shallow seismicity around Askja. First, a spatial analysis may be 
carried out, considering the average deformation field measured by Drouin et al. (2017) between 
2008-2014 and the snapshot of the deformation accommodated by faulting as observed in this study. 
This will form an interesting future study, but in light of the significant uncertainties in modelling the 
two deformation sources, and in selecting suitable rheological parameters (e.g. Pedersen et al., 2009; 
de Zeeuw-van Dalfsen et al., 2012) to interpolate the GPS velocities and relate them to deformation 
in the shallow-most crust, this is not attempted here. Instead, I focus on the temporal evolution of 
each deformation source, and discuss how that might be reflected in the seismicity. 
Several studies have attempted to characterise the shallow deflation source in Askja caldera, and 
thereby infer its nature. Combined analysis of gravity and deformation measurements (Tryggvason, 
1989a; Sturkell and Sigmundsson, 2000; Sturkell et al., 2006; Pagli et al., 2006; Pedersen et al., 2009; 
de Zeeuw-van Dalfsen et al., 2005, 2012, 2013) has provided evidence for the presence of a shallow 
magma reservoir, with the surface subsidence suggested to be caused by a combination of cooling 
and contraction of magma, and ongoing plate spreading within locally weak crust. A region of locally 
increased shear-wave velocity has since been imaged at this location by ambient noise tomography, 
supporting this hypothesis (Volk et al., in prep). However, irrespective of the causal mechanism, the 
temporal evolution of the deflation is well constrained by measurements as following an exponentially 
decaying trend since the cessation of a short-lived period of inflation in ~ 1973 (Figure 6.10a). Recent 
measurements from both GPS and InSAR also suggest an anomalous contraction extending 
somewhat north of the caldera into the fissure swarm. This might explain why the rotation of T-axes 
observed in this study is less than that required to maintain a radial azimuth with respect to the 
presumed magma reservoir in Askja caldera (Figures 6.6 and 6.8). 
In contrast, the mechanism by which glacial unloading leads to isostatic uplift around Icelands 
major glaciers is well understood. Its temporal evolution is similarly constrained by deformation 
measurements, though only extending back to 1998 (Figure 6.10b). However, by analysing the 
acceleration of uplift over the time since, Compton et al. (2015) determine that the point of zero 
velocity was most likely more recent than 1980. This is consistent with temperature and melt-season 
anomalies beginning in approximately 1989, and glacier mass-balance measurements transitioning 
from fluctuating net accumulation and loss to sustained mass loss in the mid-1990s (Compton et al., 
2015; Bjrnsson et al., 2013; Comiso, 2003). The measurements of Drouin et al. (2017) suggest that 
it has continued to accelerate until at least 2014. 
Figure 6.10: Temporal evolution of deformation sources, as measured geodetically. (a) shows cumulative 
vertical displacement between levelling line benchmarks at the east of Askja caldera, obtained from surveys 
carried out between 1968 and 2010, fitted with a linear inflation trend and exponentially decaying deflation since; 
modified after de Zeeuw-van Dalfsen et al. (2013). Note that these show the relative height change between 
these two benchmarks, and not the total deflation within the centre of the caldera (b) shows differential GPS 
measurements (blue)  such that the 2010 point represents the difference in vertical position from 2009-2010  
and results from admittance modelling (red) for three sites across Iceland (inset); SKRO is most pertinent for 
the current study. Modified after Compton et al. (2015). 
These two timeseries can be compared to the temporal evolution of the seismicity. During the 
period of this study (2007-2020), no significant long-term trend in the rate of earthquake swarms is 
observed (e.g. Figure 3.13), with the exception of the short-lived surge in seismicity in late 2014 
(Chapter 8). The IMO seismicity catalogue for this area extends further back, to 1994 (Figure 6.11), 
corresponding to the first use of digital seismometers in Iceland. However, over this period, the 
magnitude of completeness changed considerably, as the number of stations installed in the 
Highlands systematically increased (Jakobsdttir et al., 2008). However, importantly, significant 
swarms were also observed around Herubrei in 1982-83 (Einarsson, 1991). This is significantly 
earlier than the onset of sustained glacial melting, and therefore rebound, suggesting the associated 
deformation field might not be the primary cause of the observed seismicity. 
 Furthermore, analogue seismometers have been operating in certain locations in Iceland for 
significantly longer periods (Brandsdttir, 1992; Einarsson and Jakobsson, 2020). In particular, a 
seismograph in Kirkjubjarklaustur, 160 km southwest of Askja, was capable of detecting 
earthquakes M > 2.4 since at least 1961. Only swarms of seismicity linked to fault movement within 
Askja caldera itself were recognised before 1980 . Of the 67 swarms I have identified between 2007-
2020, eight have included at least 5 events ML  2.5, and three feature at least 3 events ML  3. This 
is broadly consistent with the swarms observed by Jakobsdttir et al. (2008) between 1996-2007 
(Figure 6.11), and by Einarsson (1991) between 1980-83. That no swarms were observed before 
1980 might therefore be tentatively interpreted as further evidence linking the observed seismicity 
with the ongoing deflation in Askja caldera, which began between 1973 and 1983. However, to confirm 
this hypothesis would require a more thorough inspection of the analogue seismographs. These have 
recently been digitised (Einarsson and Jakobsson, 2020), making this endeavour feasible, but it is not 
attempted here.

ML > 1 are shown by black vertical lines; grey line shows the cumulative number of events. Modified after 
Jakobsdttir et al. (2008). 
6.4.4 Pre-existing structure and anomalous fault orientations 
There are two significant counter-arguments to the hypothesis that the deflation in Askja caldera 
controls the seismicity. First, as mentioned previously, the faults between Askja and Herubrei do 
not rotate sufficiently to maintain radial T-axes with respect to the presumed deflating magma 
reservoir. Secondly, the length-scale of the ongoing deformation caused by deflation as Askja 
observed at the present day is small compared to the area covered by the seismicity. 
However, regarding this second point, it is important to recognise that the deformation rate in Askja 
is significantly lower today than in the early part of the levelling timeseries, and may have been 
considerably higher still between ~ 1972-1983. The estimated 0.38 m of net subsidence between the 
two levelling benchmarks (Figure 6.10a) corresponds to at least 2 m of subsidence at the focus of the 
deformation (E. Sturkell, pers. comm., 2021; de Zeeuw-van Dalfsen et al., 2013). The deflation rate 
is extrapolated to have been at least 50 mma-1 at that time; significantly higher than the deformation 
rates from plate spreading (17.4 mma-1) and present-day isostatic rebound (~ 5-10 mma-1)  Drouin 
et al. (2017). de Zeeuw-van Dalfsen also undertook finite element modelling (FEM) to investigate the 
spatial distribution and extremely high rate of subsidence. Their results show that viscoelastic 
rheology is likely important in controlling the concentrated nature of the observed deformation field, 
with a strong dependence on the depth to a viscoelastic layer below the surface of the caldera. 
Depending on these factors, the integrated effect of deflation in Askja on the surrounding region may, 
therefore, have accumulated sufficient stress change over the past ~ 50 years to drive the observed 
seismicity, particularly if the faults exhibit low stress drops. It is still likely, however, that further away 
from Askja the plate spreading strain field is dominant. 
I suggest, therefore, that though plate spreading alone may not be sufficient to drive these 
earthquakes, it must also play a role in determining their kinematics. Combined with the broader 
deflation field extending north from Askja caldera (Pagli et al., 2006), which corresponds closely to 
the latitude range covered by the faults mapped here, I believe this can explain the orientations of the 
observed faulting. It is inevitable that pre-existing structure will also play a role, though this is difficult 
to constrain: I highlight two endmember possibilities. First, it may be the case that in the past this area 
did act as a significant transform zone associated with the termination of the Kverkfjll fissure swarm. 
This may have led to left-lateral faulting in a right-lateral shear zone around Herubrei (as suggested 
by Green et al., 2014), though the evidence suggesting that there has not been significant block 
rotation counts against this. In contrast, it is overwhelmingly likely that the shallow magma reservoir 
underlying Askja has been through numerous cycles of inflation and deflation over the past tens of 
thousands of years, which may have been of significantly larger amplitude than that which is occurring 
at the present day. This may also help to explain why the Askja deflation appears to be holding such 
influence over the faulting observed in this study, despite its relatively small magnitude, as it has been 
shown that pre-existing, favourably oriented faults are able to slip at far lower differential stresses. 
Some insight might normally be gained into the frictional properties of faults by examining their 
orientations with respect to the principal stress axes. This is simplest to do in the area of conjugate 
faulting, where 1 must bisect the acute angle between the fault pairs. However, the two sets of faults 
are each rotated only ~ 20 from 1; significantly smaller than the ~ 30-35 that would be predicted 
according to a Byerlee/Coulomb friction model. This angle cannot be explained under the 
assumptions of a homogeneous medium where the coefficient of friction is independent of normal 
stress (e.g. Craig et al.,  2014); it would imply a coefficient of friction of greater than 1. There are then 
two possible explanations; that these faults formed under near lithostatic pore pressure conditions 
(and in a material which exhibits Griffith-type behaviour at low or negative normal stress), or that 
mechanical heterogeneity strongly influences the fracture orientations. 
The faults studied here are located at depths ranging from 1 to 5 km below the surface. To achieve 
near lithostatic pore pressures at these depths would require anomalously low permeability in the 
shallow crust, which dominantly consists of extrusive volcanic material, and is typically highly porous. 
However, Vilhjlmsson and Flvenz (2017) found a shallow conductive layer between ~ 900  2000 
m depth in a resistivity survey carried out along a line bisecting the study region. They interpret this 
as corresponding to an increasing abundance of clay minerals, similar to the clay cap observed at 
high temperature geothermal fields, and leading to a sharp decrease in permeability. This might 
therefore provide a plausible mechanism to generate the anomalously high fluid pressures required 
to generate fractures with such low angles to the maximum principal stress direction, if the material 
indeed exhibits a varying angle of internal friction at low normal stresses. 
Figure 6.12: Effect of anisotropy on fracture orientation and fault strength. (a) schematic illustration of the variety 
of relative geometries of fractures and fabric; (b) measured fracture orientation with respect to anisotropy 
(cleavage) orientation in Martinsburg slates (Donath, 1972). Modified after Burg (2020). 
Planar anisotropy is well-documented in the shallow crust of Iceland, and has recently been 
described in detail in the region around Askja by analysis of both ambient noise cross-correlations 
(Volk et al., in prep) and shear-wave splitting from local earthquakes (Bacon et al., 2021). This reveals 
a strong fabric oriented perpendicular to the spreading direction, and consistent with the orientation 
of surface features (Figures 6.1 and 6.7; Hjartardttir et al., 2009, 2013). Experiments on highly 
anisotropic shales (Donath, 1961) and rocks of varying lithology (Donath, 1972) reveal that structural 
anisotropy can have a large influence on both the orientation at which faults develop, and their 
strength (Figure 6.12). The observed strikes of faults in this study closely correspond to the fracture 
inclinations observed by Donath (1972) (Figure 6.12) in the range of angles 0 - 20 from 1, and might 
therefore help explain their anomalous geometry. It would have also have favoured, or allowed, their 
formation at relatively low differential stress. 
In reality it is possible that both mechanisms play a role. The frictional properties of these faults 
will be further analysed and discussed in Chapters 7 and 8, and the results summarised in Chapter 
6.5 Conclusions  
1. By combining relative relocations of seismic swarms, which reveal sharply delineated faults 
across the study region, with tightly constrained fault plane solutions from manual analysis of 
a subset of events, the kinematics of faulting across the study region are comprehensively 
determined. This reveals an intricate network of strike-slip faults between Askja and Mt 
Herubrei, dominated by right-lateral faulting at the south, conjugate faulting in middle 
latitudes, and left-lateral faulting at the north. Within each subset of faults, a significant anti-
clockwise rotation in fault strikes is observed with increasing latitude. 
2. Combined with the failure mechanisms of faults at the northwest of Askja caldera, this 
suggests an important contribution of radial extension towards the location of a geodetically 
observed deflation source within the caldera, likely associated with a shallow magma 
reservoir. 
3. Geodetic measurements also reveal that the combination of plate spreading and glacial 
isostatic rebound lead to a rotating strain field in this region, but this likely only became 
significant significantly after swarms were first observed in this region. It is inconclusive from 
current analysis of analogue seismographs whether swarms were only first observed after 
deflation began in Askja caldera, though current observations are consistent with this timeline. 
4. Conjugate strike-slip faults are rotated by only ~ 20 from the maximum principal stress 
direction, which may be caused by strong mechanical anisotropy in the shallow crust, near-
lithostatic pore-pressures, or a combination of both. 
Chapter 7 
Migrating earthquake swarms 
In this Chapter I analyse the systematic migration of hypocentres during earthquake swarms, clearly 
observed in Movie C.1, and revealed in exquisite detail by the relative relocations presented in 
Chapter 5. I investigate two large swarms in detail, and combine information from their spatiotemporal 
evolution, magnitude distributions and effective stress drops to infer the nature of the transient forcing 
driving their occurrence. 
7.1  Motivation and Overview 
The study of earthquake swarms promises to deliver new insights into the diverse range of processes 
that drive seismicity on crustal faults (e.g. Zaliapin and Ben-Zion, 2013). Swarms are characterised 
by a complex temporal evolution, often with significantly delayed occurrence of the largest magnitude 
event, and featuring several large events of similar magnitude. Their nature is derived from aseismic 
transient forcing acting on top of (or independent of) the long-term tectonic loading (e.g. Vidale and 
Shearer, 2006; Peng and Gomberg, 2010). This may be due to fluid pressurisation, slow-slip or creep 
events on fault segments with velocity-strengthening rheology (e.g. Beroza and Ide, 2011), or 
magmatic processes at volcanoes including dike and sill intrusions and the release of magmatic fluids 
(e.g. Martens and White, 2013). The exact physics governing their evolution is yet to be fully 
understood, though is likely influenced by local increases in pore-pressure, elastic loading by aseismic 
deformation processes and earthquake-earthquake interaction by both static stress transfer and the 
coupled evolution of dilatancy and fault slip (e.g. Peng and Gomberg, 2010; Segall and Bradley, 2012; 
Fischer and Hainzl, 2021). Tectonic earthquake swarms and slow-slip events have also been 
observed in close association with large, damaging earthquakes, so are important to study in order 
to understand the links between these two different regimes within the newly-recognised spectrum of 
fault behaviour (Peng and Gomberg, 2010; Shelly, 2010; Kato et al., 2012). 
Earthquake swarms have been observed in a wide range of tectonic and geological settings, 
including at subduction zone interfaces, associated with shallow detachment faults, at oceanic 
transform faults, in volcanically active regions, at geothermal areas and in association with human-
mediated fluid injection into the shallow crust (Vidale and Shearer, 2006; Vidale et al., 2006; Roland 
and McGuire, 2009; Peng and Gomberg, 2010; Passarelli et al., 2018; Shelly et al., 2016; Fischer and 
Hainzl, 2017). Statistical and spatiotemporal analysis of the seismicity is a primary tool in uncovering 
the nature of the swarms and thereby inferring their cause, coupled with comparison to theoretical 
models and controlled experiments, or examples where the stress and fluid conditions at the site of 
the swarm can be independently resolved. The relocated catalogue of seismicity presented in Chapter 
5 provides the opportunity to examine the properties of the seismicity during the swarms around Askja 
at exceptional resolution, and interpret them in the context of a good understanding of the tectonic 
and geological setting. Detailed analysis and comparison of the ~ 70 swarms identified during the 
study period will deliver a significant new contribution to the understanding of how seismic swarms 
may vary within a small area, but is not attempted here. Instead, I focus on characterising the 
migrating swarms observed between Askja and Herubrei, that make up the bulk of the seismicity. 
7.2  Systematically migrating earthquake swarms 
Given the volcanic setting in which these earthquake swarms are observed, it is important to first 
consider whether they might be directly caused by magmatic activity, as seen further south during the 
Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion (gstsdttir et al., 2016, 2019; Woods et al., 2019). However, 
as explored in Chapter 6, focal mechanisms calculated for these earthquakes are fully consistent with 
fault-parallel slip, and there have not been any indications of magma intrusion from geodetic 
measurements. In contrast, during the Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion, though the 
accompanying seismicity was also dominated by strike-slip faulting, the fault planes were rotated 
relative to the lineations along which they occurred, which were governed by the macroscopic 
trajectory of the dike path. Furthermore, the swarms studied here initiate at various points over a wide 
area, rather than, for example, radiating from the vicinity of the shallow magma storage regions 
identified beneath Askja volcano (Greenfield et al., 2016; de Zeeuw-van Dalfsen et al., 2013; Volk et 
al., in prep). 
Further evidence that these swarms are driven by a different process is provided by inspection of 
the spatiotemporal migration of hypocentres during a swarm that occurred in May 2014 (several 
months prior to the Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion)  one of the largest observed during the 
study period (Figure 7.1). Figure 7.1b clearly indicates a radial migration of seismicity from an initiation 
point at approximately 2 km b.s.l., expanding first along a single plane, but subsequently also featuring 
seismicity on subparallel faults to the west, and conjugate faults at the north (Figure 7.1a). This 
behaviour is representative of that seen across all swarms, and not consistent with being driven by a 
magmatic intrusion.  
In this Chapter I also analyse a large earthquake swarm from September 2014, which covered a 
fault area more than 8 km in length (Figure 7.2). Similarly to the May 2014 swarm, it initiates at a point 
close to the centre of the fault, and initially radiates systematically outwards. In this example the 
seismicity is more tightly confined to a single plane, with the exception of a small amount of conjugate 
faulting at the southwest. 
Figure 7.1: Spatiotemporal migration of hypocentres during the May 2014 swarm. (a): Map view; earthquakes 
are shown by circles, coloured by time of occurrence and scaled by magnitude; topography is shown in grey, 
and surface fractures in light brown (Hjartardttir et al., 2009, 2013; Hjartardttir and Einarsson, 2012). (b) and 
(c) show cross-sections against Latitude and Longitude, respectively; earthquakes coloured as in (a). 
Figure 7.2: Spatiotemporal migration of hypocentres during the September 2014 swarm. (a), (b) and (c) show 
map and cross-section views, as in Figure 7.1. 
As an aside, Figures 7.1 and 7.2 also illustrate how these two cross-cutting conjugate faults co-
exist without generating a space problem: the north-south right-lateral fault (May 2014 swarm) occurs 
below the complementary left-lateral fault (September 2014). Note also that a significant number of 
earthquakes occurred along the trace of the September swarm fault in May (Figure 7.1a), whereas 
none were observed along the main north-south fault plane in September (Figure 7.2a). 
7.2.1 Spatiotemporal evolution of seismicity 
The temporal evolution of seismicity during each swarm is displayed in Figure 7.3, clearly illustrating 
the characteristics that distinguish them from typical mainshock-aftershock sequences. In both cases 
there are several earthquakes within 0.5 magnitude units of the largest event, which is preceded and 
followed by several days to weeks of sustained seismicity. This behaviour is also visible in the seismic 
moment release curves, which show a gradual increase during the main phase of each swarm, as 
opposed to being dominated by a mainshock event. These features are similar to the swarmy 
sequences identified and studied by Vidale and Shearer (2006) and Roland and McGuire (2009). 
Figure 7.3: Temporal evolution of seismic swarms. (a) and (b) show earthquakes (black) scaled by magnitude, 
and cumulative seismic moment release (red) for the May 2014 and September 2014 swarms, respectively; 
September swarm x-axis scale is roughly double that for the May swarm. Note the higher magnitude of 
completeness during the first week of the September swarm, corresponding to the duration of the Brarbunga-
Holuhraun dike intrusion (orange) and elevated seismicity rates in the Askja region (Figure 3.15; Chapter 8). 
To analyse the migration of hypocentres, I filter out earthquakes which occur away from the main 
fault plane defined by the seismicity (Figures 7.1 & 7.2), and calculate their distances relative to the 
swarm initiation point. The results for each swarm are shown as plots of radial distance against time 
in Figure 7.4. Swarms driven by fluid diffusion (both in natural examples and laboratory experiments) 
generally exhibit a characteristic migration front which advances as the square root of time (Shapiro 
and Dinske, 2009). In contrast, those studied here show linear migration at velocities of ~ 0.05 kmh-1 
(~ 1 km/day), which is similar to the characteristics of earthquake swarms elsewhere attributed to 
being driven by transient aseismic slip events (Roland and McGuire, 2009; Passarelli et al., 2018). 
Figure 7.4: Linear migration of hypocentres during earthquake swarms. (a) and (b) show seismicity plotted by 
radial distance from the swarm initiation point against time, for the May and September swarms, respectively. 
Periods of linear migration are present in both swarms, highlighted by red-dashed lines indicating their speed. 
Arrow marks ML 3.7 event discussed in the text; note this and other large magnitude event locations in (a) are 
likely unreliable (see section 5.3), but included here to show their temporal occurrence. 
The May 2014 swarm displays additional complexity, with a longer period of seismicity before the 
main phase (which includes the period of linear migration shown in Figure 7.4a). The transition from 
relatively diffuse and slowly migrating seismicity to the intense swarm period is marked by the second 
largest event in the sequence (arrow; Figure 7.4a). Though the location is unreliable, the earlier part 
of the swarm provides an intriguing window into the nucleation process leading up to this ML 3.7 event, 
and clearly shows the association of this large event with the initiation of the subsequent linear 
migration period, potentially associated with a transient pulse of aseismic slip. 
7.2.2 Effective stress drops 
Further insight can be gained into the processes underlying the swarms by analysing their effective 
stress drops, calculated by comparing the measured seismic moment release to the total fault area 
illuminated during the swarm (e.g. Vidale and Shearer, 2006; Fischer and Hainzl, 2017). The stress 
drop of a fully-coupled fault rupture can be estimated according to the its length and width by the 
relationship: 
 = 	 "
         (7.1) 
where  is the stress drop, M0 is the seismic moment release, and W and L are the width (height) 
and length (along strike) of the fault (Kanamori and Anderson, 1975).  
I measure the fault area according to the distribution of hypocentres, and thus calculate effective 
stress drops of 0.23 MPa and 0.18 MPa for the May and September 2014 swarms, respectively. 
These are low compared to the typical range of stress drops measured for seismic events of similar 
magnitude to those that make up the swarms (~ 1-10 MPa; e.g. Shearer et al., 2006), but comparable 
to those observed for other tectonic earthquake swarms (Roland and McGuire, 2009). These values 
are not necessarily definitive, but provide a broad indication for the significant role of aseismic moment 
release within these swarms, and are also comparable to the effective stress drops calculated for 
slow slip events (e.g. Gao et al., 2012). Calculation of stress drops for individual events within these 
swarms (by spectral analysis of radiated seismic energy) is not attempted here, but would be a 
valuable investigation to undertake in future. This would allow a direct comparison between the stress 
drop (and coseismic slip) in individual earthquakes compared to the swarm as a whole. 
The seismic moment release of these swarms can also be compared to the globally observed 
scaling relationship with duration (Peng and Gomberg, 2010; Figure 7.5), taking the time period in 
which 80% of the moment release occurred on the main fault plane. This places them within the range 
of seismic swarms included in the Peng and Gomberg (2010) compilation, and is also similar to those 
observed by Passarelli et al. (2018) on the Hsavk-Flatey fault, in the Tjrnes Fracture Zone (north 
Iceland; Figure 1.4). However, notably, Passarelli et al. suggest that there might exist a separate 
scaling relationship for tectonic earthquake swarms driven by aseismic slip processes, which my 
observations are also compatible with. Analysis of further swarms within those identified in this study 
area  which cover a wide range of durations and moment releases  would provide a useful test of 
this hypothesis.

events. Scaling relationships inferred by Ide et al. (2007). Open and filled symbols show geodetic and seismic 
measurements; dashed horizontal lines link seismic and geodetic moment release estimates for the same event.

(2010). 
7.2.3 Relative b-values 
Statistical analysis of earthquake magnitudes can also be used as a tool to probe the processes 
driving these swarms. This is generally characterised by the seismicity b-value, derived from the 
Gutenberg-Richter parameterisation of the globally observed logarithmic distribution of earthquake 
magnitudes (Gutenberg and Richter, 1944). High b-values indicate a larger ratio of small- to large-
magnitude events, and low b-values the converse. Where the stress field is heterogeneous, or time-
varying, it may preclude the growth of large, coherent faults and/or ruptures (over long and short 
timescales, respectively), leading to a higher proportion of small earthquake ruptures. Conversely, 
high amplitude, aligned differential stresses favour the growth of larger fault planes and rupture 
patches, leading to decreased b-values. This relationship between b-value and differential stress has 
been shown in laboratory studies (e.g. Goebel et al., 2013), and inferred from natural earthquakes 
(e.g. Schorlemmer et al., 2005). 
This study 
Figure 7.6 displays the magnitude frequency distributions for the swarm and background 
catalogues for the Askja-Herubrei region presented in Chapter 5. As noted in section 3.4.4, the 
absolute whole-catalogue b-values should be interpreted with caution, however here I interpret the 
relative difference, from catalogues measured over the same time period. The significantly lower b-
values during the seismic swarms indicate a higher differential stress, which would be consistent with 
being driven by aseismic slip. These absolute and relative b-values are within the typically observed 
range for shallow crustal seismicity (~ 0.8  1.3), both globally and in volcanic regions (e.g. Greenfield 
et al., 2020; Schorlemmer et al., 2005). 
Figure 7.6: Magnitude-frequency distributions for swarm and background seismicity. (a): background 
catalogue, and (b) swarm catalogue. Cumulative number of events in each bin (of width 0.1) is shown by red 
triangles; cumulative number of events greater and equal to a given magnitude shown by black dots. Fit to the 
cumulative distribution shown by blue line, with the magnitude of completeness (MC) marked by the blue inverted 
open triangle. 
A consistent picture is obtained from the analysis of individual seismic swarms, with the May and 
September 2014 swarms exhibiting b-values of 0.92 and 0.96, respectively. In contrast, the long-lived 
swarm at Mt Upptyppingar (Figure 5.12), which has been shown to be triggered by fluids diffusing 
upwards from the Upptyppingar dike intrusion (Martens and White, 2013), has a high b-value of 1.4;  
a typical value for fluid induced seismicity in a range of settings (e.g. Greenfield et al., 2020; Scholz, 
1968). This is also consistent with the inference that fault slip in this instance is occurring along the 
pre-existing rift fabric  likely involving rupture on a large number of sub-parallel fractures, rather than 
of a mature, through-going fault  and the relatively low induced differential stresses calculated by 
Martens and White (2013). 
7.3 Discussion 
It is important to recognise that the behaviour I observe on these faults is only over a short snapshot 
of time. Given their large size, it might be ordinarily expected that these faults would periodically 
rupture in ~ M 5+ earthquakes. As discussed in Chapter 6, the microseismic catalogue only extends 
back to ~ 1980, however Jnasson et al. (2021) recently compiled a catalogue of seismicity thought 
to be complete to at least magnitude 5, and extending back to 1900. In this time, no large earthquakes 
are observed within this fault system, providing some confidence that the behaviour observed in this 
study is representative. 
Previous authors have additionally used evidence from identical repeating earthquakes to provide 
evidence for aseismic slip re-loading brittle asperities on the fault plane. I investigate this using the 
cross-correlation results computed as part of the relocation procedure outlined in Chapter 5, leading 
to the identification of ~ tens of pairs of identical events (network-averaged cross-correlation 
coefficients greater than 0.98) within each of the two swarms studied here. However, analysis of the 
frequency distribution of averaged earthquake pair cross-correlation coefficients show a smooth 
distribution, with no clear separate class of repeating events, as observed by e.g. Nadeau et al. 
(1995). This is possibly due to the relatively short cross-correlation window used, precluding the 
separation of true identical repeating events from those which have only similar phase onsets. It 
would be an interesting future study to cross-correlate all or a subset of the apparently similar 
earthquake pairs with varying window lengths, in order to investigate this more fully. 
Another key piece of evidence might be the observation of surface deformation associated with 
swarms, providing a direct measure of the fault slip which could be compared to the seismic moment 
release. Several swarms over the course of the study period are visually apparent in InSAR 
interferograms (V. Drouin, pers. comm., 2018), and it will be interesting to re-assess these in detail in 
combination with the precise earthquake relocations calculated here. A surface deformation signal 
associated with the September 2014 swarm is readily apparent in an interferogram studied by Riel et 
al. (2015), as part of their study of the Brarbunga-Holuhraun eruption (Figure 7.7). This provides 
an initial indication that the fault slip resulted in a significant surface offset (consistent with the shallow 
hypocentre locations; Figure 7.2), of at least 1 cm. Given that the interferogram doesnt cover the 
entire duration of the swarm, and the sub-optimal look angle, it is difficult to read any conclusive, 
much less quantitative, conclusions from this, however it indicates the promise of this avenue for 
future investigation. 
However, even in the absence of further evidence from deformation measurements or repeating 
earthquakes, the linear migration velocities of earthquakes and low b-values during these swarms 
strongly suggest that they are associated with aseismic slip on the fault plane. This is consistent with 
the spatially complementary nature of earthquake swarms observed over the duration of the study 
period (Figure 5.8), and the lack of seismicity on the May 2014 conjugate fault during the September 
swarm (Figure 7.2a), which indicate a significant moment release. Numerical and laboratory 
experiments indicate that to achieve the rate-strengthening rheology required to promote aseismic 
slow slip, as opposed to runaway fault ruptures, requires either an extremely low (effective) normal 
stress or coefficient of friction, and/or the presence of clay minerals with exotic frictional properties on 
the fault plane. This may be achieved with high pore fluid pressures, or in relation to hydrothermal 
deposits associated with the clay cap-like layer observed by Vilhjlmsson and Flvenz (2017) on a 
resistivity survey across this region. These possibilities will be discussed further in Chapter 9 in light 
of the analysis presented in Chapter 8.

7.4 Conclusions 
1. The spatiotemporal evolution of two large seismic swarms is analysed in detail, revealing 
systematic migration of hypocentres during the main phase of each swarm, at linear velocities 
of ~ 1 km/day, and low effective stress drops. 
2. Significantly lower b-values are observed during swarms (both collectively and individually), 
suggesting this seismicity occurs under conditions of increased differential stress, supporting 
the interpretation that they may be driven by transient aseismic slip on the fault plane. 
Furthermore, their moment-duration scaling falls along a proposed scaling relationship for 
slow-slip phenomena, based on a global compilation of seismic and geodetic observations. 
3. The spatially complementary pattern of swarms over the 13 year study period further indicates 
the role of aseismic processes in releasing additional moment. To achieve this slow slip on 
the majority of the fault would require an exotic rheology and/or extremely low effective 
coefficient of friction, which may be explained by a combination of elevated pore fluid 
pressures and the presence of clay minerals associated with hydrothermal activity. 
4. Future investigation of surface deformation during swarms will provide a more accurate 
assessment of the ratio of seismic to aseismic deformation, and combining measurements 
across the full catalogue of more than 70 discrete swarms will provide a useful test for 
proposed scaling relationships, and an opportunity to search for potential variations in 
characteristics, for example with depth.

8.1  Introduction 
The triggering of earthquakes by stress changes has long been a topic of interest in the seismological 
community. This began as a quest to understand the mechanisms controlling the spatiotemporal 
evolution of aftershock sequences following large earthquakes (e.g. King et al., 1994), and has since 
evolved to help explain ruptures on linked faults and, more recently, seismicity rate changes 
associated with a much broader range of applied stresses. This includes stress changes due to 
hydrological loading, deglaciation, tidal oscillations, hydrocarbon extraction (including fracking as well 
as traditional gas extraction) and deformation caused by volcanic activity  for example by magmatic 
intrusions (e.g. Smith et al., 2020, Green et al., 2015, Johnson et al., 2017, Craig et al., 2017, and 
references therein). What we learn from these studies offers both an opportunity to help predict and 
mitigate seismicity caused by human activities (for example by managing water levels in reservoirs, 
or gas extraction rates) and to use examples of well-resolved applied stress changes as a form of 
natural experiment to help probe the mechanical properties of natural faults. This is crucial to help 
bridge the vast difference in timescales and length-scales between simulated fault ruptures in 
laboratory experiments and the failure of geological faults. 
The study of aftershock sequences following large earthquakes remains the most common 
approach  to probing the effect of static stress changes, but these analyses suffer from an unavoidable 
ambiguity between the effects of static and dynamic stresses, both of which are produced during large 
seismic fault ruptures, and both of which have been demonstrated to trigger seismicity (e.g. Ross et 
al., 2019b). Static stress changes decay with ~ r3, while dynamic stresses decay with ~ r2, so there 
are cases where it is possible to isolate seismicity rate changes associated with dynamic forcing (e.g. 
Ross et al., 2019b; Jay et al., 2012), but it is rare to be able to isolate the effects of static stress 
changes. Furthermore, dynamic triggering remains a moreorless empirical observation, with no clear 
understanding of the physical mechanism, precluding the possibility of quantitatively correcting for its 
influence (Ross et al., 2019b; Brodsky et al., 2003). 
How static stress changes affect slow fault slip remains even less well understood. Triggering of 
aseismic slip events by large earthquakes has been commonly reported for over 60 years (e.g. 
Wallace et al., 2017; Shelly et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2018), but it has proven difficult to 
unravel the competing influences of static and dynamic stress transfer for many of these events (Du 
et al., 2003). Indeed, there are examples where stress modelling, seismic and deformation 
measurements provide conclusive evidence that the triggered slow slip must have been primarily 
controlled by either static stress alone: e.g. triggered slip on the Shahdad basal thrust by the 1998 
Fandoqa earthquake (Berberian et al., 2001; Fielding et al., 2004); or by dynamic stress alone: for 
example on numerous faults in California (e.g. Shelly et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2015). A key component 
to understanding these phenomena are the nucleation processes controlling the initiation of creep 
events, and their associated timescales and length-scales. These quantities ultimately determine 
whether creeping faults respond to applied stresses (Wei et al., 2015), and above which threshold 
applied stress (or indeed stressing rate), but are currently not well known. 
This leaves an important gap in our understanding of the triggering of another key component of 
post-seismic deformation following large earthquakes: namely, after-slip on the fault within or 
surrounding the earthquake rupture area. This aseismic slip has the potential to load adjacent portions 
of the fault, potentially leading to further damaging earthquakes. Aseismic fault slip events have also 
been widely identified at subduction zones (Peng & Gomberg, 2010), where it forms a key link in the 
chain to understand the interaction between shallow megathrust earthquakes and slow slip events on 
deeper, creeping portions of the slab interface. 
Here I provide clear evidence for the triggering of seismic swarms, likely driven by dominantly 
aseismic fault slip, by static stress changes generated by the Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion. 
As discussed in Chapter 7, evidence from the spatiotemporal migration of earthquake hypocentres, 
b-value statistics and low effective stress drops, and the spatial complementarity of swarms through 
time,  indicates that these swarms of small, high-frequency earthquakes are driven by transient 
aseismic slip events. The dike intrusion propagated and inflated over a period of roughly 14 days  a 
very slow deformation rate compared to earthquake ruptures  and hence produced negligible 
dynamic stresses. These observations therefore allow a direct and unambiguous analysis of the effect 
of static stress changes on the initiation of these seismic swarms. Furthermore, the dike intrusion was 
monitored in extraordinary detail, allowing for the construction of detailed models of its evolution 
through time (Sigmundsson et al., 2015; Green et al., 2015). I use these models together with the 
exceptionally well-constrained locations, orientations and slip vectors of the faults which slipped to 
calculate the evolution of the applied static stress changes, and compare these to the timing of slip 
initiation as recorded by the microseismicity. 
The observation of this widespread triggering of swarms by the dike intrusion also grants an 
opportunity to provide constraints on the minimum amplitude of the stress cycle on these faults. Those 
which slipped prior to the induced stress change, but not during or immediately after, must have 
released more stress than applied by the dike intrusion. Likewise for faults which did not slip prior to 
or immediately after the dike intruded, but have in subsequent years. This will allow me to place a 
minimum constraint on the amplitude of the stress drop, and compare it to the effective stress drops 
calculated in Chapter 7 
8.2  The Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion 
On 16th August 2014 an intense swarm of microearthquakes marked the initiation of a lateral dike 
intrusion from the sub-glacial Brarbunga volcano (Sigmundsson et al., 2015; gstsdttir et al., 
2016, 2019). Seismicity began in the southeast corner of the caldera, first migrating radially away, 
before turning sharply to the northeast and propagating a total of 48 km over 2 weeks. High resolution 
relative relocations of more than 30,000 microearthquakes induced by the dike (gstsdttir et al., 
2016, 2019; Woods et al., 2019), calculated by the same method outlined in Chaper 5, reveal in detail 
its segmented lateral growth, with the seismicity mainly focussed at the leading edge of the intrusion. 
A brief subaerial eruption on 29th August re-occupied craters from the previous eruption at Holuhraun 
in the 18th century (Ruch et al., 2016), approximately 5 km north of the Vatnajkull ice cap (Figure 
8.1). The main eruption began on 31st August  venting from an elongated fissure at the same location 
 and continued for almost 6 months. Over this time 1.6 km3 of lava was erupted (Gslason et al., 
2015), fed by a draining magma reservoir beneath Brarbunga caldera, which subsided a total of 65 
metres at a steadily decreasing rate, correlating with the rate of eruption at Holuhraun (Gudmundsson 
et al., 2016). 
As the intrusion advanced, historically seismically active regions adjacent to the dike first lit up with 
bursts of seismicity at more than an order of magnitude higher than the background rate, before 
abruptly shutting off as the dike propagated past them (Green et al., 2015). Green et al. demonstrated 
that this shows a clear example of a stress-shadowing effect caused by static stress changes induced 
by the propagating dike. As the dike approached, lobes of positive coulomb stress emanating from its 
advancing tip first favoured fault slip, causing the increase in seismicity rate. However, as the intrusion 
then continued to propagate northwards, these regions of triggered seismicity fell into areas of 
compression adjacent to the dike, clamping the faults and preventing further slip. Seismicity rates at 
Kistufell (Figure 8.1), which showed the most convincing triggering and clearest shut-off, remain at 
zero to this day, almost 7 years later. 
The loci of these regions of triggered seismicity were roughly 10-15 km away from the dike path, 
and though the dike opened around 4 metres in its distal segment (Sigmundsson et al., 2015; Ruch 
et al., 2016; Green et al., 2015), the modelled stress changes imparted on the receiver faults were 
modest, at approximately 0.1 MPa (Green et al., 2015). It is therefore perhaps surprising that such a 
dramatic surge in seismicity was also observed significantly further away from the dike, north of 
Holuhraun: initially around Askja volcano, 20 km north of the eruption site, before sweeping 
systematically northeast towards Herubrei as the dike advanced (Figures 8.1 and 8.2). 
Figure 8.1: Overview of seismicity induced by the Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion, reproduced from 
Green et al. (2015). (a): Dots show earthquakes coloured by the day on which they occurred, including more 
than 30,000 events delineating the path of the segmented lateral dike. Regions of triggered and then suppressed 
seismicity adjacent to the dike are highlighted by black rectangles, with representative focal mechanisms 
displayed for each. Note the seismicity extending northeast from Askja volcano towards Herubrei, which 
occurred from day 239 (27th August) onwards. Orange open triangle shows the site of the eruption, and the 
2014-15 Holuhraun lava is shaded orange. Topography is in grey, with ice in white, and rift segments overlain 
in beige; ticked lines delineate calderas. Inset shows location of the study area within Iceland (red box) (b): 
propagating dike tip is highlighted by the red line, illustrating its episodic advance towards Holuhraun. 
This series of intense seismic swarms occurred throughout the network of strike slip faults that are 
the main focus of this dissertation, the furthest almost 40 km distant from the eruption site. The 
earthquake catalogue and precisely relocated hypocentres I have produced, covering the period from 
7 years prior to 6 years after the intrusion, reveals this increase in seismicity rates in striking new 
detail, and in full context of the background activity. Unlike the triggered events adjacent to the dike, 
the faults around Askja were subjected to a monotonic increase in stress during the intrusion, and 
which has persisted since. As such, there was no stress shadowing effect, and the seismicity rates 
were elevated during and immediately after the intrusion, before evolving back towards the 
background rate in the years since (Figure 8.2). 
Figure 8.2: Earthquakes ML > 0.5 detected in the region around Askja volcano from July 2007 to August 2020. 
Individual events are shown by black circles, and the cumulative number is illustrated by the red line. Individual 
swarms appear as vertical stripes, and steep steps in the cumulative number of events. The largest step occurs 
in late August 2014, consisting of several swarms closely spaced in time. The duration of the Brarbunga-
Holuhraun dike intrusion and eruption are shaded dark and light orange, respectively. 
8.2.1 Temporal evolution of background seismicity 
I will focus on the seismic swarms triggered by the dike intrusion, but the comprehensive nature of 
my earthquake catalogue will also allow for future study of the effect of the dike intrusion on the overall 
seismicity rates across the network of faults northeast of Askja. As discussed in Chapter 5, I have 
identified and extracted earthquakes directly associated with the swarms to generate two sub-
catalogues: one containing the swarms only, and the other only the intervening background 
seismicity across the region. Initial inspection of the background seismicity (Figure 8.3) shows an 
intriguing temporal evolution of the seismicity rates in the years following the eruption, with some 
suggestion that they may still not yet have returned to pre-2014 rates (note MC < 0.5). 
However, my removal of seismic swarms represents only a crude attempt at de-clustering the 
catalogue, which will likely be necessary to comprehensively assess the evolution of seismicity rates 
through time (e.g. Marsan & Lenglin, 2008), but complicated here by the strong spatial and temporal 
clustering of seismicity associated with the seismic swarms (e.g. see discussion in Heimisson & 
Segall, 2020). Furthermore, unlike for the earthquakes which occurred during seismic swarms, I have 
not yet calculated precise relocations of the background activity, and no manual analysis has been 
undertaken to calculate focal mechanisms. The rarity of this opportunity to study such a well-resolved 
natural experiment, however, means that it will merit further investigation, and recent re-appraisal of 
the applicability of rate-and-state theory to model un-de-clustered catalogues suggests that this will 
be possible if certain conditions are met (Heimisson, 2019). This will require careful consideration, 
and is not attempted here.

circles, cumulative number of events in red. The duration of the dike intrusion and eruption is shown in orange. 
8.2.2 Triggering of seismic swarms by the dike intrusion 
The exceptionally detailed earthquake locations presented by Woods et al. (2019) and gstsdttir 
et al. (2019), and our new understanding of how they are generated, allow for a detailed comparison 
to be made between the evolution of the dike intrusion as it propagated towards Holuhraun (Figure 
8.4), and the triggered seismicity northeast of Askja. 
As the dike advanced forwards on the 19th and 20th August 2014, forming its 3rd segment, the first 
spike in earthquake rates was observed along a fault immediately east of the geothermal area at the 
southeast of Lake skjuvatn (Figures 8.5 & 5.11), before remaining quiet for several days as the dike 
stalled. The first sign of seismicity within the network of strike-slip faults occurred in the early hours of 
the 26th August, as the dike propagated towards the eruption fissure at Holuhraun (Woods et al., 
2019). When the dike advanced forwards again in the early hours of the 27th August, reaching its final 
length, a second spike in seismicity occurred close to the geothermal area, closely followed by the 
initiation of several swarms on faults within 10 km to the northeast of Askja (points b and d on Figure 
8.5). The precise and accurate relocations of this seismicity that I have produced reveal that over the 
following days, the seismicity on each fault accelerated and migrated, as observed systematically 
across all the swarms I have identified in this region during the study period (Chapter 7). 
Figure 8.4: Detailed evolution of the dike intrusion revealed by relatively relocated seismicity, modified after 
Woods et al. (2019). Earthquakes plotted by distance along the distal segment of the dike (starting at 64.78N  
see Figure 8.1) against time, during (A) the dike intrusion and (B) the first month of the eruption; earthquakes 
in black, scaled by magnitude. Eruption fissures shown as orange diamonds; eruption periods shaded in orange. 
Cumulative seismic moment release shown by red line. Note the change in timescales between A and B. 
At midnight on 29th August, seismicity in the dike abruptly abated (Figure 8.4), correlating closely 
with the observation of the glow of lava on webcams installed around Holuhraun, signalling the start 
of a small eruption (Woods et al., 2019; Ruch et al., 2016). This lasted roughly 4 hours (as observed 
in the field by researchers from the University of Cambridge), and after this time seismicity gradually 
returned to the distal dike segment and migrated back towards the eruption site, signalling re-
pressurisation and further inflation of the conduit (Figure 8.4). Later the same day, seismicity was 
observed south of Herubrei, approximately 30 km northeast of the eruption fissure, signalling the 
initiation of a far larger swarm, which would last for more than 10 days and grow to almost 10 km in 
length (a, Figure 8.5; Chapter 7). The relocated seismicity reveals the initiation point of this swarm  
close to the centre of the fault  from which slip and seismicity radiated monotonically outwards to 
both northeast and southwest, and places precise constraints on its location and orientation, with 
excellent agreement with the tightly-constrained fault-parallel fault plane solutions (Chapter 6).  
Figure 8.5: Spatiotemporal evolution of triggered seismicity around Askja. Relocated earthquakes plotted in 
map and cross section view, coloured by date of occurrence, highlight swarms on sharply delineated faults, 
starting in the southwest and then migrating northeast (note that earthquakes which occur earliest in time are 
plotted on top). Two swarms occurred after 10th September; north of Herubrei, and close to Askja, respectively 
(shaded black). Points a-f mark faults/swarms which are referred to in the text and in Figure 8.8. 
The main eruption at Holuhraun began at around 04:00 on 31st August, after which time seismicity 
rates in the dike again generally fell, suggesting a drop in pressure in the conduit as magma found its 
way to the surface through a now 1.5 km long eruption fissure (Figure 8.4). However, the seismicity 
observed northeast of Askja continued to evolve beyond this time. First, a swarm on a northeast-
striking left-lateral fault east of Herubrei began on 1st September (c on Figure 8.5  more than 40 
km from the eruption fissure), followed by another north-south fault close to Askja on 3rd September

(f), a third left-lateral fault north of Herubrei on 4th September (e) and further swarms on the 5th and 
8th September close to Askja and north of Herubrei, respectively (regions b and e). It is interesting 
to note that though no first-order behavioural changes were noted in the eruption during this time, 
subtle oscillations in the rate of seismicity in the distal dike segment (P5, Figure 8.4), and the brief 
opening of a second eruption fissure further south (within the graben which had formed above the 
opening dike), indicated that the dike continued to inflate  and perhaps occasionally deflate  even 
as lava flowed out freely at the surface. 
These observations indicate a clear correspondence between propagation and inflation phases of 
the dike and the initiation of earthquake swarms more than 20 km away between Askja and 
Herubrei. However, to quantitatively assess their relationship requires modelling of the evolving 
static stress field imparted on these faults by the dike. Here I combine my constraints on the 
orientation and slip vectors of the receiver faults with two models of the evolution of dike opening 
through time to analyse this quantitatively and in detail. 
8.3  Coulomb stress modelling 
By combining observations of the migrating earthquakes, which delineate the location of the 
propagating dike tip, GPS measurements, and high-resolution, short-repeat InSAR acquisitions, 
several detailed models of the dike opening have been constructed (Sigmundsson et al., 2015; Green 
et al., 2015; Ruch et al., 2016). Here I use two of these models to calculate the static stress changes 
imparted by the dike opening on the faults which slipped in my study area (Figure 8.6). Rock failure 
along a plane can result from either increasing the shear stress (in the direction of fault slip) or 
reducing the normal stress, in order to overcome or reduce frictional resistance to slip, respectively. 
The combination of these factors can be expressed as the Coulomb Failure Stress (CFS), based on 
the Coulomb failure criterion derived from laboratory studies of rock fracture. 
   Coulomb Failure Stress (CFS)   =   s  (n  P)   =   s  n             (8.1) 
where P is pore fluid pressure,  is the coefficient of friction, and s and n are the shear and normal 
stresses, respectively (here positive n is defined as clamping of a fault plane, such that decreased 
normal stress favours fault slip). The reduced form of the equation (RHS) incorporates the effect of 
pore pressure (which acts to counteract the normal stress) into an effective coefficient of friction,  
(King et al., 1994). It is important to note that the Coulomb stress field is not a representation of the 
absolute stress state of the crust, but instead indicates whether a given deformation (and/or pore fluid 
pressure) perturbation acts to favour or suppress slip of a given orientation of fault in a particular slip 
direction. A positive CFS (generally plotted in red  e.g. Figure 8.7) indicates that the perturbation 
pushes that particular population of faults towards failure. 
I use the open-source Coulomb 3.3 software (Toda et al., 2011) to calculate the strain field 
according to two separate dike opening models, according to the equations of Okada (1992), and 
assuming a homogeneous elastic half-space. Given a Youngs modulus (or elastic stiffness) these 
can then be used to derive the stress field, and to resolve the change in the normal and shear-stress 
on receiver faults of the specified geometry. I specify the same Youngs modulus as was used to 
invert for the dike opening from surface deformation measurements, for consistency (45 GPa in both 
cases). I perform these calculations for each of the two orientations of receiver faults observed around 
Askja: north-south striking right-lateral and northeast striking left-lateral strike slip faults. Finally, to 
combine the normal and shear stress perturbations into an estimate of the change in Coulomb Failure 
Stress requires the specification of an effective coefficient of friction (equation 8.1).

solutions from which it is derived (arrows; red shows modelled displacement vectors). Purple dots and green

white, and volcanic calderas are marked by ticked lines. 
8.3.1 Influence of the (effective) coefficient of friction 
The effective coefficient of friction depends not only on the material properties of the country rock (or 
more accurately the likely heavily altered fault gouge produced from it over many slip cycles), but also 
the pore-fluid pressure within the fault core. These factors are highly uncertain, so it is useful to pause 
to examine the effect of a plausible range of values for this parameter on the outcome of this 
modelling. Green et al. (2015) trialled values between 0.2 and 0.6 (in keeping with the majority of 
studies before them), but these all provided comparable fits to their data. As is evident from equation 
8.1, lower (effective) coefficients of friction will act to reduce the impact of normal stress changes, 
both absolutely and relative to the influence of shear stress changes. However, within this study area, 
normal and shear stresses induced by the dike opening (on both sets of receiver faults) are uniformly 
negative and positive, respectively (i.e. both favouring fault slip). The selection of the effective 
coefficient of friction will not, therefore, change the sign of the calculated CFS. It will, however, have 
some effect on its amplitude. If the coefficient of friction is overestimated, this will result in an 
overestimate of the CFS, with the limiting case that CFS = s , with no contribution from the normal 
stress change. 
Laboratory and numerical studies investigating the phenomenon of slow fault slip, which likely 
plays an important role in driving the observed seismic swarms, have generally produced strong 
evidence that low effective normal stresses and/or low effective coefficients of friction favour the mildly 
rate-strengthening rheology required to achieve this behaviour (e.g. Brgmann, 2018). This can be 
achieved either by the presence of abundant clay minerals (for example) which exhibit extremely low 
frictional resistance, or by elevated pore fluid pressures (section 7.4). Nevertheless, for the purpose 
of this modelling I use a value of 0.4. This likely represents an overestimate of the true value , (and 
hence the predicted CFS), but provides a maximum endmember constraint. I also report the change 
in shear stress through time, as a minimum constraint on the CFS. 
8.3.2 Deformation models 
I here use the models of Green et al. (2015) and Sigmundsson et al. (2015) to model the evolution of 
the strain field induced by the dike opening through time, and the consequent stresses induced on 
the receiver faults northeast of Askja. Both consist of daily estimates of the dike opening, though are 
based on different data and parameterisations. Green et al. use only daily GPS displacement 
measurements from relatively far-field stations in their inversion (Figure 8.6d). Accordingly, they are 
confined to estimating the volume of the dike, rather than its precise geometry; they set the top of the 
dike at 2 km depth, apart from in the final segment beneath the eruption fissure, which extends to the 
surface, and the base and lateral position and extent according to the locations of the seismicity. Their 
model therefore represents a coarse estimate of the dike opening, but this is suitable for investigating 
triggering of fault slip in the far field. 
The model of Sigmundsson et al. contains additional constraints from InSAR data (Figure 8.6b) 
which provides detailed near-field measurements of the surface displacement north of the glacier 
margin, as well as more GPS stations. This allows them to invert for the distribution of opening in 
depth, and therefore obtain a more detailed picture of both the dike opening and consequent 
subsurface strain field. However, varying data availability (due to the irregularity of InSAR 
acquisitions) leads to additional uncertainty in the relative dike opening on consecutive days, which 
is of strong importance in this study. Each inversion also uses different inversion schemes, so by 
comparing the results from both I obtain a more representative picture of the range of possible 
stressing histories. However, they are broadly similar, so I expect them to give comparable results. 
Figure 8.7: Displacement field (a), and example of normal (b), shear (c) and Coulomb (d) stress changes 
imparted on right-lateral strike slip faults by the dike intrusion, reproduced from Green (2016). Green lines 
delineate the dike opening model used to compute displacements in an elastic half-space (here from 1st 
September 2014). In regions shaded red, faults with the specified orientation and slip vector would be pushed 
towards failure. Coulomb stress change is calculated according to equation 8.1 using an effective coefficient of 
friction of 0.4. In the study region, northeast of Askja, normal and shear stresses uniformly favour failure (red 
shading), so only the amplitude of the Coulomb stress change is sensitive to the coefficient of friction. 
8.4  Results: stress-seismicity evolution 
Figure 8.7 illustrates the strain, normal stress, shear stress and Coulomb Failure Stress fields induced  
by the dike for near-north striking right-lateral strike-slip receiver faults, according to the dike opening 
model of Green et al. (2015), on 1st September 2014. As mentioned previously, the magnitude of the 
stress changes in the region of interest, northeast of Askja, is significantly lower than in the areas of 
triggered seismicity at Brarbunga, Kverkfjll and Kistufell studied by Green et al. (Figure 8.1). 
Importantly, the normal and shear stresses in this region both uniformly favour fault slip (Figure 8.7), 
meaning the coefficient of friction used to calculate the CFS field mainly acts to modulate its 
amplitude, rather than controlling its relative value through time and space. 
For each triggered seismic swarm described in section 8.2.2, I identify the position in the 
subsurface at which the swarm initiated from my relocated hypocentre catalogue (Figures 8.5, 7.2). I 
set the receiver fault orientation according to both the orientation of the relocated microseismicity and 
the fault plane solutions of Green et al. (2015) (Figures 8.5, 6.4). Note that not every small North-
South striking fault close to Askja (b, Figure 8.5) has been analysed manually, but based on the 
consistency of focal mechanisms across this region I can confidently infer their slip direction from the 
fault orientation (see Chapter 6 for more detailed discussion of the distribution of fault orientations 
and slip vectors). I then calculate the Coulomb Failure Stress and shear stress evolution through time 
at the initiation point of each fault, according to the daily dike opening models.  
Figure 8.8 illustrates the daily estimates of CFS at the nucleation point of each seismic swarm 
described in section 8.2.2, in comparison to the daily seismic moment release on that fault. A strong 
correspondence is seen between stress changes favouring fault slip and the initiation of seismic 
swarms, and at very small stress changes. These first order observations provide strong evidence 
that the dike opening triggered slip on these faults. Swarms on the faults north of Herubrei (e) and 
~ 5 km northeast of Askja at Vikrafell (f) began after the eruption initiated, and later than the time 
period covered by the Green et al. dike opening model, but Sigmundsson et al.s model indicates little 
further opening beyond 31st August (Figure 8.8f). As expected, in the period where these two models 
overlap the stress evolution timeseries closely agree, with the Sigmundsson et al. model generally 
predicting roughly 30% larger stress changes (shown only on panel f, for clarity). 
The threshold Coulomb Failure Stress for swarm initiation covers a small range of values, between 
0.01 MPa for the swarms north of Herubrei and 0.02-0.03 MPa for the swarm closest to Vaalda. 
Shear stress changes are generally around twice as small, at 0.005-0.015 MPa. Allowing for a 
reasonable range of Youngs moduli (up to 2x larger  Auriac et al., 2014), and taking into account 
the larger stress changes predicted by the Sigmundsson et al. dike opening model, the maximum 
stress change at swarm initiation is just 0.08 MPa, and for the fault north of Herubrei the maximum 
plausible stress change is just 0.025 MPa. This is three orders of magnitude smaller than the shear 
strength of intact basalt  roughly 50 MPa  and significantly smaller than the typically observed range 
of earthquake stress drops or triggering thresholds for seismic ruptures. However, stress drops of 
geodetically observed slow-slip events commonly fall within this range (Gao et al., 2012).

8.5 Discussion 
Combining my observations of the seismicity with modelling of the stresses imparted on the faults 
provides strong evidence that static stress changes induced by the dike intrusion triggered the seismic 
swarms, likely driven by aseismic slip, observed around Askja in September 2014. The plurality of 
faults that slipped suggests that these extremely small stress changes represent a significant fraction 
of the amplitude of the stress cycle between swarms. That swarms were only triggered across this 
region also suggests that this network of faults does not extend significantly further than observed 
during the study period, particularly to the south where static stress changes were significantly larger. 
8.5.1 Comparison to seasonal loading 
Donaldson et al. (2019) found that crustal seismic velocity also showed a strong response to the strain 
imparted on the surrounding crust by the Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion. Strain modelling, 
carried out using the same procedure as described above, reveals a clear linear correlation between 
the measured step change in seismic velocity in the 0.4-1.0 Hz frequency band and the predicted 
volumetric strain change at 1km depth, in regions of both compression and dilatation surrounding the 
dike (Figure 8.9). However, for all but the very closest stations (within roughly 20 km of the dike path), 
this signal was overshadowed by a high-amplitude annual variation in seismic velocities. This annual 
variation is also clearly observed in surface deformation measurements (Drouin et al, 2017). It is 
therefore interesting to consider why the occurrence of swarms does not show any strong seasonal 
tendency. 
This annual relative velocity variation was observed across several frequency bands, sensitive to 
approximate depth ranges of 0-100m, for the highest frequency band, to 1-8 km for the lowest 
(Donaldson et al., 2019). By carefully comparing the subtle differences in the timing, shape and 
amplitude of the velocity changes at each of these approximate depth ranges with weather data, we 
constructed a model which comprehensively explains this seasonality in crustal seismic velocity. This 
model consists of two key components: variations in elastic loading due to snow depth, atmospheric 
pressure and groundwater level changes, and pore fluid pressure changes also caused by the varying 
groundwater level. For full details of the weather data processing and modelling, see Donaldson et 
al. (2019). 
As shown in figure 8.10, pore-pressure changes  measured by proxy as groundwater level (GWL) 
 peak sharply in ~ May each year, corresponding to snow melt, while elastic loading varies more 
gradually. The total load is generally lowest between July and October, steadily increasing until late 
spring  in correlation with increasing atmospheric loading and accumulating snow depth  before 
decreasing between late April and June as snow first melts, being converted to groundwater, and 
then gradually drains away. The earlier, sharper drops in seismic velocity measured in frequency 
bands sensitive to the shallowest crust correspond to far greater influence of pore pressure changes 
due to snow melt at these depths (Figure 8.10D). Moving deeper, the influence of pore-pressure 
gradually decays, indicating either that the majority of the fluids escape the system laterally, never 
reaching deeper than the top ~ 1 km of the crust, or that the signal is heavily smoothed out by slow 
diffusion, which is not modelled in detail. Velocity changes in the ~ 1-8 km depth range (Figure 8.10C), 
most applicable to the depths of the seismic swarms studied here, are well explained by elastic 
loading variations alone.

stations. A: Relative seismic velocity variations (dv/v), measured from 30-day stacks of ambient noise cross-
component correlation functions in the 0.4-1.0 Hz frequency band, for a selection of stations around Holuhraun.

The amplitude of the cycles in pore pressure and total elastic loading are of the same order of 
magnitude as the dike induced stresses which triggered seismicity across the study area: 0.5 m of 
water is equivalent to a ~ 0.005 MPa surface load; approximately the same as the minimum threshold 
for triggering by the dike (Figure 8.8e). However, there are two important differences between the 
seasonal elastic loading and that induced by the dike. First, it is not clear whether the shallowest 
crust, where pore-pressure changes are most important, is hydraulically connected to the depths of

swarm initiation considered here (typically 1.5-4 km below surface). Secondly, the elastic load is 
spread evenly over a large area, meaning it will dominantly produce stress changes in a vertical 
orientation. For vertical strike slip faults, this corresponds only to a change in normal stress, the 
influence of which is strongly governed by the effective coefficient of friction, as discussed in section 
8.3.1. That we do not see any evidence that this variation in normal stress affects the occurrence of 
seismic swarms provides an indication that the effective coefficient of friction on these faults is very 
In contrast, seismicity at the geothermal area at the southeast of lake skjuvatn does show 
evidence of a seasonal variation in seismicity (section 5.5). Unlike the network of strike slip faults, a 
wide range of focal mechanisms are observed here, indicating a critically stressed network of 
fractures. However, studies of the temporal distribution of earthquakes of different focal mechanisms 
in the skjuvatn cluster do not show strong evidence for a seasonal partitioning between, for example, 
normal and reverse faulting, which might be expected if surface loading was the dominant mechanism 
driving the varying seismicity rates. It is also worth noting that the hydraulic connection to the surface 
is also likely significantly different in this area. 
8.5.2 Static stress changes on faults not triggered by the dike intrusion 
It is also possible to examine the stress changes on faults where swarms were not triggered by the 
dike intrusion. Following the same procedure as described in section 8.4, I find a similar range of 
stress changes for faults across the region (0.005 - 0.1 MPa, taking the extreme values). This 
suggests that the amplitude of the stress cycle between swarms is generally larger than ~ 0.05 MPa, 
as otherwise faults which hosted swarms in the years following the dike intrusion (e.g. in 2017 and 
2019; Figure 8.2) would also have been triggered in September 2014. Similarly, the stress drop in 
swarms which occurred in the years prior to the dike intrusion in August 2014 must have been larger 
than this, allowing for some uncertainty due to considerations surrounding the nucleation process of 
the swarms, else they would have been triggered to slip once again. This range of values can also be 
compared with the effective stress drops calculated in Chapter 7, which gave values of  ~ 0.2 MPa, 
which is compatible with this interpretation, and inferred lower limit. As discussed in section 7.4, it will 
be useful to investigate the effective stress drops across the full range of swarms observed over the 
study period, and particularly for those where it might be possible to make independent observations 
using geodetic techniques. 
The range of static stress changes observed to trigger swarms in this region can also be compared 
to examples of stress triggering observed elsewhere. Observational studies, dominantly consisting of 
analysis of aftershock sequences, find that stress increases of less than 0.1-0.3 MPa are generally 
sufficient to trigger seismicity (Freed, 2005, and references therein). That such small stress changes 
are sufficient to trigger typical fast earthquakes (with stress drops on the order of 1-10 MPa; Shearer 
et al., 2006) reinforces the interpretation that they are not the cause, but only a trigger, acting to 
advance the clocks of faults already close to failure (Freed, 2005). As discussed above, the temporal 
occurrence of seismic swarms observed during this study is fully compatible with this model. 
8.6  Conclusions 
1. I present clear evidence, in the absence of complicating factors such as dynamic stress 
changes, for the triggering of seismic swarms by static stress changes of just 0.005-0.1 MPa. 
This is below the commonly assumed threshold at which fault slip is likely to be triggered, and 
has implications for the modelling and understanding of induced seismicity in the variety of 
locations and geological contexts in which the importance of aseismic slip has now been 
recognised. 
2. These observations provide important additional constraints on the mechanical properties of 
the faults which host seismic swarms in this study area. The absence of triggered seismicity 
on any of the faults which hosted swarms before and after the dike induced stresses were 
applied in 2014 indicates that the amplitude of the stress cycle, and of the total stress drop 
during each swarm, is larger than ~ 0.05 MPa, compatible with the effective stress drop 
estimates calculated in Chapter 7. 
3. The absence of any seasonal tendency in the timing of swarms, despite seasonal elastic 
loading of the crust of the same magnitude as has been shown to trigger seismic swarms by 
the dike intrusion, provides observational evidence that the effective coefficient of friction on 
these faults is likely to be anomalously small, such that changes in normal stress have 
negligible influence on their tendency to fail. 
Chapter 9 
Conclusions 
Here I summarise the main findings from the research presented in this dissertation, and combine it 
in order to provide a fuller perspective on this anomalous area of seismicity in the Northern Volcanic 
Zone. I furthermore summarise how these findings have been facilitated by the automated relocation 
workflow I have developed  founded on the earthquake catalogue produced using QuakeMigrate  
and the remaining opportunities for future improvements. 
9.1  Fault friction 
The conjugate faults revealed by the relative relocations presented in Chapter 5 and fault plane 
solutions calculated in Chapter 6 show an anomalous geometry, with angles to the principal stress 
axis of only ~ 20. This cannot be explained by fault friction alone (it would require a coefficient of 
friction greater than 1), but may be influenced by mechanical anisotropy or near-lithostatic pore 
pressures. Furthermore, that the network of faults appear to be so influenced by a deflation source in 
Askja caldera, which likely results in only small strain rates at the distances of the majority of the 
faults, suggests that they are weak. 
The linear migration of earthquake hypocentres during individual swarms, at velocities of ~ 1 
km/day, is most similar to swarms observed elsewhere that have been linked to aseismic slip as the 
transient aseismic forcing that drives their slow migration. This is supported by the low relative b-value 
estimates (which likely indicate high differential stress conditions), low effective stress drops, and the 
ratio of seismic moment release to swarm duration. 
The unique observation of seismic swarms triggered by extremely small static stress changes 
induced by the 2014 Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion is in agreement with these findings; 
further indicating that these faults are weak compared to those in the surrounding area. Furthermore, 
the absence of any seasonality in the ~ 70 swarms over a 13 year period suggests they are not 
sensitive to normal stress changes of similar amplitude, again indicating a low coefficient of friction. 
Considered together, these observations could be explained by either elevated (near-lithostatic) 
pore pressures, leading to the anomalous fracture angles, or a low effective coefficient of friction 
(and/or normal stress), and consequent weakness. They could also be explained by the presence 
of clay minerals on the fault plane, which would similarly make the faults weak, would favour 
aseismic slip, and might have exaggerated the effect of the known mechanical anisotropy on the 
fracture angles, by making these planes even more susceptible to slip. The distinction between these 
two potential causes might, however, be helped by taking a wider perspective. 
9.2 Faults in context 
The widespread triggering of seismicity by the dike intrusion was also useful in providing additional 
confidence in the spatial extent of these faults: it is particularly unlikely that they extend any further to 
the south, given the induced stresses were significantly higher there. It is also interesting to note that 
during the Brarbunga-Holuhraun dike intrusion, there was a conspicuous lack of any shallow 
seismicity (< 6 km depth) along its entire path, including immediately ahead of the opening dike tip, 
where stresses were most concentrated. Along with the limited spatial extent of the persistent  and 
swarm-like  seismicity observed across this network of faults, this suggests that the crust here might 
be mechanically distinct from that in surrounding areas. 
Considering this wider view, there are two features that stand out as different about the area 
where the strike-slip faults and staccato swarms are located. Firstly, there is an unusual concentration 
of deep nests of seismicity in the lower crust, that likely indicate locations of magma ascent. Though 
more widespread deep seismicity has recently been discovered under Vatnajkull, it is almost entirely 
restricted to occurring beneath well-developed central volcanoes (this author, unpublished results). 
Intriguingly, however, the seismic swarms appear to tesselate with the locations of deep seismicity 
(Figure 3.11s). This suggests there might be some interaction between the two, but not in the simple 
sense that fluids ascending from these magmatic bodies directly favour swarm-like seismicity above 
them. Indeed, the only direct example of triggering by fluids released from magma intruding in the 
lower crust, at Mt. Upptyppingar, produced a seismic swarm with very different characteristics, and 
notably restricted to the lowermost part of the brittle crust, perhaps hinting at permeability barriers 
preventing influence at shallower depths. 
The second pattern in the occurrence of swarms is their relationship to geothermal areas within 
the Askja calderas, and the surrounding network of rivers (Figures 3.11, 6.1). The swarms between 
Askja and Herubrei emanate from the most intense geothermal area, at the southeast corner of 
Lake skjuvatn, and extend to the northeast, along the drainage direction. There is an indication that 
there is a drainage divide slightly to the south, with a spring just south of Vaalda fed by glacial 
meltwater, and an ephemeral lake at Dyngjuvatn (~ 5 km southeast of the skjuvatn cluster, Figure 
6.1), suggesting the water table comes to the surface here. At the northwest of Askja caldera, the 
second set of strike slip faults, which also exhibit swarms, emanate from a second intense geothermal 
area, which is also marked by persistent seismicity (Figure 5.10). I suggest, based on this, that it is 
worth investigating whether this may indicate a possible causality, with minerals generated at the 
hydrothermal systems and carried in groundwater through the crust into these two areas responsible 
for precipitating either unusual or unusually high concentrations of clays in the depths of the crust 
where these faults occur. 
The combined influence of fluids ascending from depth, and the potential depth stratification of 
groundwater flowing from the hydrothermal area may help to explain the observed variability in 
seismicity with depth, both in magnitude distribution within the swarm seismicity, and in comparison 
to the depth range of background earthquakes. Computing similarly precise relative relocations for 
the background seismicity would be extremely helpful in attempting to explain these observations, as 
well as searching for variations in the properties of swarms which occur at different depths. 
9.3 Automated analysis of microseismicity 
The new insights gained from this research are founded on the automated workflow employed to 
calculate precise and accurate locations for a far greater number and proportion of events than is 
possible by manual analysis. QuakeMigrate is fundamental to this, in making it possible to produce a 
highly complete catalogue, with few artefacts, and with high quality absolute locations. Though there 
are computational costs involved in all stages of the processing, this approach as a whole is highly 
generalisable, and promises to provide the opportunity to gain insights that would not be possible with 
traditional techniques alone. 
Within the analysis presented in this dissertation, a single step remains which is entirely reliant on 
manual waveform analysis: the measurement of P-wave first motion polarities, used to calculate fault 
plane solutions. Though it remains challenging, automated algorithms have been and are being 
developed to attempt this, and are already adept at measuring P/SH amplitude ratios, which can also 
help constrain fault plane solutions. They mostly rely on precise arrival time estimates, and it would 
be interesting to assess the suitability of the automatic phase picks produced by QuakeMigrate for 
this purpose, particularly in light of the excellent performance suggested by comparison to the cross-
correlation results in Chapter 5 (Figure 5.5). 
QuakeMigrate also continues to be somewhat limited by the necessity to specify parameters for 
onset function calculation, which will always inherently be targeted towards a specific class of events 
(whether by frequency content, magnitude range, or phase arrival characteristics). However, new 
algorithms, particularly based around machine learning approaches to seismic phase detection, 
continue to make improvements in this area, and the modular nature of QuakeMigrate will make it 
straightforward to compare these against existing algorithms, and to make use of those which provide 
superior performance. 
This dataset, featuring a diverse array and huge quantity of seismicity, a long recording duration  
including extremes in network geometry and station count  a broad variety of noise sources, and a 
complementary catalogue of manually analysed events, will provide an extremely useful benchmark 
with which to assess these future advances.

Appendix A 
Network configuration through time 
This appendix contains figures showing the network configuration during each batch of time in which 
the 13 years of continuous seismic data between 2007-2020 were processed. It additionally shows 
the raw earthquake catalogue output by QuakeMigrate for that time period. The date range is 
indicated on each figure, each of which features the same layout and information, described in the 
figure caption below. 
Figure A.1: Network configuration and earthquakes detected 2007-184  2007-237. Main panel shows map 
view, with topography shaded in grey, ice in shades of white (bottom), rivers and lakes shown in blue, and 2014-
15 Holuhraun lava flow in dark grey. Stations active during this period shown by red triangles; IMO stations 
shown by inverted blue triangles. Open triangles show inactive stations. Earthquakes shown by dots, scaled by 
magnitude and coloured by coalescence value (see legend bottom right); shallow and deep earthquakes 
coloured separately. Cross sections (VE 1:1) show earthquakes as in map view, with topography as black line.

Supplementary material to Chapter 3 
Figure C.1: Timeseries of deep seismicity against Latitude. Top panel displays the locations of deep 
earthquakes for the duration of the catalogue (2007-2020), coloured by depth b.s.l.. Bottom panel shows 
cumulative seismic moment release through time. The duration of the August 2014 Brarbunga-Holuhraun 
dike intrusion is highlighted in orange (both panels). Note the Upptyppingar dike intrusion (~ 65.05N, during 
2007-2008), and the short-lived swarms in the deep clusters. The apparent decrease in seismicity during the 
2014-15 dike intrusion and eruption (shaded dark and light orange, respectively) is likely an artefact related to 
missed detections during this period. 
The animation referred to in the text is provided alongside the electronic copy of this dissertation. The 
caption is printed below: 
Movie C.1: Animation of seismicity in the region around Askja 2007-2020. Map (left panel) shows topography 
shaded in grey, fissure swarms overlain in beige (Einarsson and Smundsson, 1987; Smundsson, 1979), 
lakes and rivers (blue), and surface fractures and fissures in brown (Hjartardttir et al. 2009, 2016; Hjartardttir 
and Einarsson, 2012). All stations used throughout the study period are shown as open triangles. Right panel 
shows cross section view, with surface topography shown by black line. Earthquakes are shown by circles, 
scaled by magnitude and coloured by time of occurrence (see Legend). Deep and shallow earthquakes are 
coloured separately. Earthquakes which occurred more than 30 days before the timestamp of the current frame 
are shown in black (shallow) and purple (for deep events), and at 1/5th scale.
