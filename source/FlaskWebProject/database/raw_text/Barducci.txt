This Thesis is devoted to the phenomenological analysis at the large hadron collider
(LHC), as well at a future electron positron collider, of the 4 dimensional (4D) composite
Higgs model (4DCHM), a compelling beyond the standard model scenario where the
Higgs state arises as a pseudo Nambu Goldstone boson. The motivations and the main
characteristics of the model are summarised and then an analysis of the gauge and Higgs
sectors of the 4DCHM is performed. Finally we propose a general framework for the
analysis of models with an extended quark sector that we have applied to a simplified
composite Higgs scenario.

Introduction
1.1 The Standard Model of fundamental interactions
The discovery of the Higgs boson by the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] collaborations an-
nounced at the Organisation Europeenne pour la Recherche Nucleaire (CERN) on the
4th of July 2012 has established the existence of the last missing piece of the Standard
Model (SM) of fundamental interactions and has ended a nearly forty years search for
this particle that was theorized in 1964 by Peter Higgs and Francois Englert. The two
scientists proposed a mechanism, now commonly called the Higgs mechanism 1, through
which the gauge bosons of the SM acquire mass and for this idea on the 8th of October
2014 they were awarded with the Nobel Prize for physics 2.
The SM represents at the moment the best theoretical description of the fundamental
interactions in particle physics. It unifies the weak, electromagnetic and strong forces,
three of the four fundamental forces of Nature, which are described by a gauge theory
invariant under the SU(3)c  SU(2)L  U(1)Y group. Since its complete formulation
in 1967 this theory has been more and more validated by experimental evidences such
as the discovery of the bottom quark in 1977, the top quark in 1995, the weak neutral
current mediated by the Z0 boson in 1983 and the  neutrino in 2000 until the already
mentioned discovery of the Higgs boson, that has been reached thanks to the huge effort
of the physics community in building the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
1Though even names with more scientists that have contributed to this idea have been coined, such
as the Brout-Englert-Higgs-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble mechanism, from now on we will refer to it as the
Higgs mechanism.
2Besides the name of Higgs and Englert it should also be mentioned that of Robert Brout, collaborator
of the latter, who would probably have been awarded with the Nobel Prize too if he hadnt passed away
in May 2011.
Chapter 1. Introduction 2
However, despite all its experimental validations, there are theoretical and experimental
indications that the SM cannot be the ultimate theory of Nature. For example, on the
experimental side, the evidence of dark matter (DM) and dark energy makes the SM
describing only 4% of the universe content, while the observation of neutrino oscillation,
and therefore the evidence of at least two massive neutrinos, has no trivial explanation in
this theory as well as the matter-antimatter asymmetry observed in the Universe. Con-
versely, from the theoretical point of view, the non inclusion of a quantistic description
of the gravitational force seems the biggest limitation of the SM.
Nevertheless, as already mentioned, the SM extraordinarily agrees with a large number
of data collected so far by various collider experiments (such as LEP, LEP2, Tevatron
and LHC) as reported in Fig.1.1.

Therefore the following questions arise naturally: what is the main reason that makes
the physics community think that we should find new physics at the TeV scale, that is,
http://gfitter.desy.de/Standard_Model
Chapter 1. Introduction 3
at the energy scale that is being tested at the LHC? Could all the problems mentioned
before be solvable at a scale that is and will be unreachable by the CERN machine?
1.2 Naturalness and fine tuning
A possible answer to this question relies on what the particle physics community calls
naturalness or fine tuning argument. In the SM the Higgs mass receives large radiative
corrections from loops contributions to its two point function involving fermions, vector
bosons and the Higgs itself (Fig. 1.2), and these corrections grow as 2, where  is
the theory cut off. If we assume the SM to be valid up to the Grand Unified Theory
(GUT) scale, 1016 GeV, or Planck scale, 1019 GeV, the one loop corrections to the Higgs
mass will then be roughly 24 order of magnitude bigger than its measured value, and
this implies that the related counter terms would need to be fine-tuned up to 1024 to
have the correct cancellations that give the 126 GeV Higgs mass. Although consistent
from a theoretical point of view, since the SM is a renormalizable theory, this huge
and precise cancellation is believed to be unnatural and is taken as a hint of a relative
small value of the cut off , that indicates the presence of new physics at a scale which,
for a reasonable level of fine tuning of the order of a few %, is expected to be of the
order of 1 TeV. A complementary point of view is to consider that, while in the SM the
fermions and vector bosons masses are protected respectively by the chiral and gauge
symmetries, no symmetry is actually protecting the scalar mass from the mentioned
radiative corrections. Conversely the presence of a new symmetry, with the implication
of new physics, will stabilize the mass of the scalar.
Figure 1.2: Quadratic divergences to the Higgs mass given by a top quark loop (left),
Higgs loop (centre) and a gauge boson loop (right)
This is exactly what happens in the most common BSM (beyond the Standard Model)
scenario for which physicists are searching evidence: Supersymmetry (SUSY). The
boson-fermion symmetry present in SUSY theories predicts the existence of partners
of the SM particles which have a value of the spin 1/2 smaller, and whose existence
Chapter 1. Introduction 4
provides a precise cancellation of the quadratic divergence arising from the loop of,
for example, the top quark with the loop involving its SUSY counter part, the stop
(Fig. 1.3), due to their different statistical behaviour: Fermi-Dirac for the former and
Bose-Einstein for the latter. Despite other fascinating properties of SUSY theories, like
a possible explanation of DM, the unification of the gauge couplings and the fact that a
Supersymmetric algebra is the only non trivial extension of the Poincare group, so far
we do not have any evidence of Supersymmetric particles at the LHC and bounds on
the masses of the SM partners are being set higher and higher.
Figure 1.3: Top quark (left) and stop squark (right) loop contributions to the Higgs
mass. In SUSY theories these contributions lead to the cancellation of quadratic diver-
gences.
For this reason other BSM solutions ought to be investigated and from the point of view
of the fine tuning argument, another possibility to prevent large radiative corrections
affecting the Higgs mass is to postulate it to be a composite state.
1.3 The composite Higgs idea
The idea of postulating the Higgs boson to be a composite state was first formulated by
Georgy and Kaplan [3] in the 80s. In their theory the Higgs arises as a bound state of
a strongly coupled sector at some energy scale higher than the electro-weak (EW) scale.
In order to achieve a light spinless particle, therefore lighter than the other resonances
of this strong sector, the Higgs is postulated to be a Goldstone boson (GB) arising from
the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of a global symmetry G of the strong sector.
An eventual weak and explicit breaking of G can then give rise to a radiative generated
scalar potential [4] that guarantees a mass for the Higgs which will then become a pseudo
GB. Being the Higgs a composite state automatically solves the hierarchy problems since
all the radiative corrections affecting its mass will be saturated at the composite scale,
that is its mass will not be sensitive to virtual effects above such scale, and also agrees
with a historical pattern that has so far seen all the (pseudo)scalar particles known in
Nature to be composite states.
Chapter 1. Introduction 5
This idea closely resembles the pattern with which it is possible to explain the lightness
of the pions,  and 0, with respect to all the other mesons, like for example the s3,
that is, postulating them to be pseudo GB arising from the spontaneously breaking
of the SU(2)L  SU(2)R chiral symmetry, emerging as bound states of the quantum
chromo-dynamic (QCD) strong sector.
A relevant input to the study of the pseudo GB Higgs has been given in a paper of
Agashe, Contino and Pomarol entitled The Minimal Composite Higgs Model [5], where
the authors introduced the most economical coset of symmetry breaking: SO(5)/SO(4).
This coset develops four GBs, which is the minimum number to be identified with the
SM Higgs doublet, and, after three of them have been eaten to give mass to the W
and Z0, the spectrum presents just one physical scalar: the Higgs boson. Moreover the
authors show that the presence of a SO(4) custodial symmetry is crucial to protect the
 parameter from dangerous corrections.
The composite Higgs idea could then be a compelling alternative to SUSY scenarios so
as to stabilize the EW scale and solve the naturalness issue, and in the last decade we
have witnessed a proliferation of models based on this paradigm, among which we also
find constructions that can incorporate DM into the composite Higgs framework (see
e.g. [6]). The reason for this, besides a theoretical appeal, is that this kind of theories is
actually testable at the LHC. If the hierarchy problem is in fact solved by some strong
dynamics, we expect the appearance of new resonances and, in particular, again for the
fine tuning argument, the fermionic ones (usually called top partners) are expected to
be at the TeV scale in order to stabilize the Higgs mass [79], in the same way that third
generation sfermions are expected to be relatively light in SUSY theories, and this is in
general an energy scale that is actually explorable at the LHC.
1.4 The LHC and future proposed colliders
The Large Hadron Collider built at CERN between 1998 and 2008 is at the moment
the worlds largest and most powerful particle collider and four experiments are actually
present: ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and ALICE. Built in the 27 km circumference LEP
tunnel, it started operations on the 10th of September 2008. The centre of mass energy
of the beam has been then gradually increased first to the energy of 7 TeV on the 30 of
May 2010 and then to the energy of 8 TeV on the 5th of April 2012, while the collected
integrated luminosity has now reached the value of  20 fb1. On the 14th of February
2013 the first long planned shut-down of the machine began, waiting for the 14 TeV run
3In fact m/0 = 139.6/135.0 MeV and m/0 = 775.4/775.5 MeV.
Chapter 1. Introduction 6
that is scheduled to start in 20154 and with which the collected integrated luminosity is
predicted to reach  300 fb1 in 10 years of operations. A planned upgrade of the CERN
machine, the high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), plans to bring the integrated luminosity
up to the level of  3 ab1.

runs of the LHC during the years 2010, 2011 and 2012.
Besides the already mentioned discovery of the Higgs boson5, the LHC has achieved
important results in testing the Higgs properties and many BSM scenarios.
The measures of the Higgs couplings are usually recast in terms of the so called signal
strengths, that are the ratio of the number of events observed in a given Higgs decay
channel per production mode over the SM expectation, and the results in Fig. 1.5 for
these measurements, with the 7 and 8 TeV dataset, show that both agreements and
tensions with the SM predictions are present, though nothing definitive can yet be said
due do the still big error bars on these measurements.
From the point of view of BSM theories the LHC has so far found no evidence of new
particles belonging to any new physics theory and bounds on the masses of these new
states are being set higher and higher, as shown for example in Fig. 1.6. The left plot
shows the CMS limits on the masses of different SUSY particles with the 7 and 8 TeV
LHC dataset for different search channels and integrated luminosity while the right plot
shows the CMS mass limit on a generic top partner present in composite Higgs models
(CHMs) in function of its branching ratios into SM bosons and third generation quarks
with the 8 TeV dataset and 19.6 fb1 of integrated luminosity. Though it has to be
stressed that these bounds strongly depend on the underlying models assumptions (a
framework for the reinterpretation of the top partners limits will be given in Chapter
4This is the centre of mass energy that we have used in considering the forthcoming run of the LHC.
However CERN has recently decided to restart the collisions with a centre of mass energy of 13 TeV,
which however will not change our conclusions.
5The LHC has also discovered the bottomonium meson b(3P) (22nd December 2011) and made the
first observation of the rare Bs  
+ decay (8th November 2012).

We conclude this introduction by pointing out that the study of the Higgs boson prop-
erties is one of the main motivations for the proposal of a next generation of colliders.
In fact, even without the discovery of any new particle in the second stage of the LHC
running, understanding the properties of the Higgs boson is an essential step to shed
light on the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). From the point of
view of the measurement of the Higgs couplings to SM matter, gauge bosons and the
triple and quartic Higgs self couplings, the CERN machine has some limitations due to
its hadron-hadron collider nature and in particular the latter two measurements seem
Chapter 1. Introduction 8
respectively challenging and impossible to achieve with sufficient precision. In conclu-
sion, at the end of the LHC operations, it is not so unlikely that there will be a situation
where the measurements of the Higgs properties are achieved with an error not small
enough to disentangle the BSM nature of this state. The physics community must then
make an important decision regarding a new generation of colliders, and at present both
hadron colliders, like the already mentioned HL-LHC and a 100 TeV LHC, and electron-
positron colliders, such as the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC), the International Linear
Collider (ILC) and new circular electron positron collider (TLEP), are being considered.
For this reason it is important to study the capability of such machines in testing par-
ticular BSM scenarios and in this Thesis we will also focus on the potential of the ILC
on testing the Higgs sector of a CHM.
1.5 Plan of the Thesis
The plan of the Thesis is the following.
In Chapter 2 we will discuss the general properties of CHMs and present the particular
model used as a framework for most of the phenomenological analysis of this Thesis,
the 4DCHM, discussing its main characteristics and its implementation in Monte Carlo
(MC) generators.
In Chapter 3 we will analyse the gauge sector of the 4DCHM presenting the LHC analysis
of Drell-Yan (DY), diboson and tt production at the LHC and the discovery potential
of the new gauge bosons present in the model of such processes.
In Chapter 4 we will discuss the Higgs sector of the 4DCHM showing the compatibility
of our model with the 7 and 8 TeV LHC data and the prospects of a future e+e collider,
namely the ILC, in testing the scalar sector of the model.
Finally in Chapter 5 we present an analysis strategy and a dedicated program that
allows the recasting of the results of the experimental direct searches for top partners in
models with a complete and extended fermionic sector, as typical in CHMs, for which a
general analysis would otherwise be challenging. We will apply our tool to simplified as
well as physically motivated models, highlighting also its potentiality in setting bounds
on scenario not yet covered by the experimental analyses.
Chapter 2
Composite Higgs and the
4DCHM
In this Chapter we discuss the idea and general properties of CHMs, starting from
their origins up to their more recent developments. We introduce the formalism for
construction of an effective Lagrangian thorough the Coleman, Callan, Wess and Zu-
mino (CCWZ) method specializing it then to the framework that has been chosen for
our analysis, the 4DCHM. After describing the properties of this concrete realization,
whose most important feature is having an Higgs potential fully calculable making then
the Higgs mass a dependent parameter of the model, we will then discuss its imple-
mentation into automated tools that allow a phenomenological study of the composite
pseudo Nambu GB (pNGB) scenario for the Higgs scalar in a complete way up to event
generation level.
2.1 The Higgs as a composite pNGB
The idea of postulating the Higgs as a composite pNGB goes back to the 80s and was
introduced in a paper by Georgi and Kaplan titled SU(2) U(1)Y breaking by vacuum
misalignment [3]. Their work was written shortly after the discover of the W and
Z0 boson that confirmed that a spontaneously broken SU(2)L  U(1)Y gauge group
was describing the electroweak interactions, but at that time it was not clear how this
symmetry was broken. The authors postulated that besides the Higgs mechanism of
the SM theory and the Standard Hypercolour scheme (now called Technicolour) a third
possibility exists.
Chapter 2. Composite Higgs and the 4DCHM 10
They described the Higgs boson as a bound state of a strongly interacting sector arising
from a SSB at an energy scale f  vSM = 246 GeV, where vSM is the SM vacuum
expectation value (VEV). This breaking describes a certain number of GBs one of which
should be identified with the Higgs boson, that will then be a massless particle. It is
the explicit breaking of the global symmetry of the strong sector that can give rise to
a potential generated by radiative corrections which will then trigger EWSB and make
then the Higgs a pseudo GB. The EWSB is then realized at a scale different from that of
the strong sector. The Higgs boson created in this way will then be a composite state,
therefore insensitive to radiative corrections above its compositness scale, and lighter
than the other resonances of the strong sector due to its pseudo GB nature.
As mentioned in Chapter 1 this idea resembles quite closely what happens for pions in
massless QCD, where it can be postulated that they are GBs arising from the sponta-
neous symmetry breaking of the SU(2)L  SU(2)R  SU(2)V chiral symmetry of the
strong sector. If this symmetry was exact the pions would be massless GB, however, the
coupling of the charged pions with the photon, that can be introduced by gauging the
U(1)em  SU(2)V group, breaks this symmetry explicitly and, in the same way as for
the composite Higgs case, a radiatively induced potential can be generated and give rise
to a mass terms for , leaving 0 massless, thus explaining the mass difference between
the charged and neutral pions.
Coming back to the composite Higgs idea, lets take a strongly interacting theory that
possesses a global symmetry G broken to a subgroup H at a scale f that then develops,
in virtue of the Goldstone theorem, n GBs with n = dim(G)  dim(H). If we assume
now to have an external sector with an associated gauge symmetry Hg  G we then have
that n0 = dim(H0)dim(HHg) GBs will be eaten to give mass to an equal number of
gauge bosons, leaving then n n0 GBs in the spectrum. Lets now identify Hg = GSM ,
where GSM is the SM gauge group, in order to have the minimum number of external
(not belonging to the strong sector) fields. In order to have a correct pNGB composite
Higgs two conditions need to be satisfied [10]:
1. GSM  H so that the EW gauge group is not broken at tree-level
2. Four of the GBs arising from G/H should transform under GSM as the SM Higgs
doublet.
The most economical SSB pattern that respects these conditions is the one described in
[5] with the assignments G = SO(5)  U(1)X and H = SO(4)  U(1)X . The breaking
G/H has the following characteristics
Chapter 2. Composite Higgs and the 4DCHM 11
 It develops dim(G) dim(H)=11-7=4 GBs, the minimum number to be identified
with the SM Higgs doublet. They transform according to the fundamental rep-
resentation of SO(4) and they can then be identified with the SM Higgs doublet
since SO(4)  SU(2)L  SU(2)R.
 GSM  H thanks to the identification T Y = T 3R+TX and so the EW gauge group
is unbroken at tree-level.
As already mentioned, it will be the weak but explicit breaking of the global symmetry
of the strong sector, due to the gauging of a subgroup of H identified with GSM , that will
be able to generate a potential for the Higgs at loop level and then, if this potential has
the correct Mexican hat shape, deliver a VEV that can then break the EW symmetry.
The ratio between the electroweak scale, vSM , and the scale of breaking of the strong
sector, f , is an important parameter in CHMs and the parameter  = v/f substantially
describes the misalignment between the vacuum of the theory before and after the gaug-
ing of SU(2)LU(1)Y and functions of it will also give the deviations of the composite
Higgs couplings with respect to the SM theory.
2.2 The 4DCHM
We want to describe now the framework that we chose for our phenomenological analysis,
the 4DCHM of [11], which is a concrete realization of the composite Higgs paradigm
based on the SO(5)/SO(4) breaking pattern described in the previous Section.
2.2.1 The gauge sector
The starting point is the construction of a non linear  model which describes the
breaking of SO(5)/SO(4) in terms of the low energy dynamics of the associated GBs,
following the CCWZ prescription for which we refer to Appendix A.
We first introduce the pion matrix
U() = ei
2aT a/f  =
2aT a a = 1, 2, 3, 4 (2.1)
where T a are the broken generators of SO(5)/SO(4) whose algebra is described in Ap-
pendix B. This matrix transforms under the symmetry G = SO(5) as
U()  gU()h(, g) g  G, h(, g)  H (2.2)
Chapter 2. Composite Higgs and the 4DCHM 12
from which we can construct the Maurer-Cartan form
U U = id
a + ieaT
a = id + ie (2.3)
that transforms under G as
e  h(, g)eh(, g) ih(, g)h(, g),
d  h(, g)dh(, g).
(2.4)
At the lowest derivative order the generic G invariant Lagrangian written just in terms
of the broken generators is then
tr[dd
] (2.5)
which, for the case SO(5)/SO(4), can explicitly be written as (see again Appendix A)
()
T () (2.6)
where
 = U()0 = e
2aT a/f , 0 = i5 (2.7)
To introduce spin-1 resonances into this construction the authors chose to add a sec-
ond non-linear  model which describes the breaking SO(5)L  SO(5)R/SO(5)V . This
approach follows that of [12] (see also [13]) where the authors show that with a similar
construction it is possible to describe the pions and the heaviest mesons like the s and
the a1s in the context of QCD. Following again the Maurer-Cartan formalism it is pos-
sible to show that the Lagrangian of eq.(2.5) can be written in the case of this breaking
pattern as
Tr[()
()],  = exp(iaT a), T a  SO(5). (2.8)
The complete Lagrangian then now reads
()
T () +
Tr[()
()] (2.9)
and describes 4+10=14 scalars arising from the two  models that for now do not
interact1. We now gauge the diagonal subgroup of SO(5)R and SO(5) adding a complete
SO(5) multiplet of resonances  living in the Adj(SO(5)) obtaining then the following
1 We are neglecting for the moment the U(1)X group since it is irrelevant to the present discussion,
while it will be introduced again in describing the fermionic sector of the model.

D =  g,

(2.11)
and where  and A are the field strengths for the new spin-1 resonances and the SM
gauge fields. The A fields that have been introduced are responsible for the explicit
breaking of the SO(5)L symmetry and will contribute then to the generation of a loop
induced Higgs potential. Finally with g0 we indicate in a compact way both the gauge
couplings of SU(2)L  U(1)Y , namely {g0, g0y}, while the gauge couplings of SO(5) 
U(1)X have been fixed at a common value g. Another possible construction for the
pNGB Higgs, based on the SO(5)/SO(4) breaking pattern, is the one formulated in [14]
which adopts a different construction from ours in introducing the resonances.
Lets now pause and recap the particle content that has been introduced so far in the
model.
 The two non linear  models parametrising the breaking of SO(5)/SO(4) and
SO(5)L  SO(5)R/SO(5)V give 14 GBs in the spectrum.
 The gauging of the diagonal subgroup of SO(5)R and SO(5) causes, via a sort of
Higgs like mechanism, the reabsorbing of 10 GBs into the longitudinal components
of the  resonances, leaving the spectrum with 10 massive vector bosons and 4
massless GBs.
 The EWSB caused by a radiative generated Higgs potential will cause the dis-
appearance, in the unitary gauge, of 3 of the GBs that will give a longitudinal
component to the SM gauge bosons, leaving the spectrum with just one physical
scalar: the (composite) Higgs boson.
 The extension of the symmetry breaking pattern SO(5)  SO(5)U(1)X has the
only consequence of having 11 massive vector bosons instead of 10.
As a last step in the description of the gauge sector we introduce a convenient parametriza-
tion, called unitary gauge, in which the mixing terms between the s and the vector
resonances disappear. This gauge is defined
 = exp(
) = U() (2.12)

from which we can write an explicit expression for  as

haha. (2.13)
2.2.2 The fermionic sector
As explained in [5] the gauge bosons contribution is not enough to cause a correct
misalignment of the vacuum that can provide EWSB and for this reason CHMs usually
present also an extended fermionic sector in their spectrum. While the choice of the
gauge sector of the model depends only on the pattern of symmetry breaking that
develops the pseudo GB Higgs, the fermionic sector has quite a large freedom of choice
which will then cause a strong model dependency.
In the model under consideration the new fermions are embedded in fundamental (vec-
tor) representations of SO(5)  U(1)X and the authors considered four copies of this
representation in order to ensure the finiteness of the Higgs potential and a dynami-
cal generated shape with the correct VEV in order to trigger EWSB [11]. It is worth
stressing, however, that other choices of fermionic embedding are possible 2 and that, in
order to have a simpler spectrum for a phenomenological analysis, the finiteness of the
Higgs potential is not always required in literature. However, a dynamical generated
potential is still one of the most attractive features of CHMs and efforts have been made
in the calculation of it in other patterns of SBB, see for example [8] for the case of
SO(6)/SO(5) breaking.
Coming back to the 4DCHM, the authors considered the following SO(5)U(1)X quan-
tum number assignments for the embedding of the new fermions
T ,T  (5, 2/3),
B,B  (5,1/3).
(2.14)
Under SO(4), the fundamental representation of SO(5) decomposes as 4+1 which, under
SU(2)L  SU(2)R, reads (2,2)+1, so that each representation of eq.(2.14) is made up
of a bidoublet and a singlet of SU(2)L  SU(2)R. Then, thanks to the identification
T Y = T 3R+TX , it is possible to assign to these extra quarks the SM quantum numbers
and also embed the SM quarks, the left handed third generation doublet and the two
right handed third generation singlets, into incomplete representations of SO(5)U(1)X .
The four representations of eq.(2.14) can then be written in terms of the SU(2)L doublets
2Among the most common ones are the adjoint, 10, and the spinorial, 4, of SO(5).
Chapter 2. Composite Higgs and the 4DCHM 15
(X5/3, X2/3), (T2/3, B1/3) and (Y1/3, Y4/3) as
T = T =
( X5/3 T2/3
X2/3 B1/3
B = B =
( T2/3 Y1/3
B1/3 Y4/3
1/3
(2.15)
where with X and Y we have labelled the quarks belonging to the SU(2)L doublet
with exotic (not present in the SM) hypercharge and the subscript indicates the electric
charge of the quark. We can then see from eq.(2.15) that the SM doublet (tL, bR) can
be embedded in both the vector representations with charge X = 2/3 and X = 1/3
respectively, with a proper assignment of the SU(2)R charge, while the SM singlets tR
and bR needs to be identified with 2/3 and 1/3 respectively.
Differently from the SM fermions these new quarks have the properties that their left
and right handed component transforms in the same way under the gauge group (for
this reason they are called vector-like quarks), so we havent labelled them in eq.(2.15)
with a chirality index, that needs to be done in writing explicitly the embedding of the
SM quarks into incomplete representations of SO(5) U(1)X .
Before writing the fermionic Lagrangian of the 4DCHM we want to discuss briefly the
motivations for extending just the third generation of quarks with a new sector and the
motivation is twofold. Firstly, since the SM top quark is the main cause of the hierarchy
problem, it is natural to extend as a first instance just the heavy quark generation in
order to provide cancellations so as to restore the naturalness of the EW scale and for
this reason the new quarks that appear in CHMs are usually called top partners, to
emphasize the role that they have in relieving the hierarchy problem. Secondly, CHMs
also present a mechanism called partial compositness [15] that tries to explain the mass
hierarchy between the masses of the SM fermions (especially the top-bottom hierarchy)
postulating the existence of linear mixing between them and the new quarks. This
mixing allows the SM quarks to interact directly with the composite sector in which the
Higgs boson lives, and then generate Yukawa interactions for the SM quarks. The idea
is that the larger the mixing angle the more the SM fermions are massive and, since the
top quark is the heaviest of them, the first natural extension of a quark sector will again
be related to the third generation of quarks. These two motivations are of course not
separated and usually one speaks of CHMs with partial compositness.
With this in mind, and dictated by the symmetry of the model chosen, the fermionic
Lagrangian of the 4DCHM is
Chapter 2. Composite Higgs and the 4DCHM 16
Lfermions = Lelfermions + (tL q
LT +tR t
RT + h.c.)
+ T (i /D m)T + T (i /D m)T
 (YT T,LTT ,R +mYT T,LT ,R + h.c.)
+ (T  B)
(2.16)
where Lelfermions indicates the kinetic Lagrangian of the third generation SM fermions,
/D are the covariant derivatives with respect to the SO(5) U(1)X fields and, contrary
to the general choice present in the original work [11], we have chosen a common mass
parameter, m, for all four representations of SO(5) U(1)X present in the model.
We have so far introduced the composite Higgs boson via a low energy effective theory,
through the CCWZ construction, with the addition of extra spin-1 and spin-1/2 reso-
nances. This is the most popular approach used in literature for considering the pNGB
Higgs state and studying its properties at colliders, but it should be noticed that there
is no guarantee that there is an UV theory from which these constructions, and so the
4DCHM, can arise. Attempts have been made in order to provide a UV completion of
models with a composite Higgs based on the partial compositness paradigm, based on
both SUSY and non-SUSY approaches [16, 17]. While a discussion on this issue is beyond
the scope of this Thesis, it is however important to stress that our calculations based
on a low energy approach remains valid for phenomenological analyses even though the
general theory is not known. To take into account effects induced by strong interactions,
naive dimensional analysis power counting [18, 19] can be used and, without wanting to
be exhaustive on this subject, we refer to [20, 21] where strongly interacting QCD-like
theories are considered. Though not rigorously motivated, we can then state that the
low energy effective theory approach commonly adopted, and also limited to the lightest
set of extra resonances that can be introduced in these constructions, will provide the
necessary ingredients for a phenomenological collider study of the composite Higgs idea,
although a construction of a UV completion of this paradigm remains an interesting,
and challenging, question.
Finally, even though it has been shown in a recent work [22] that this is not the most
general Lagrangian dictated by the symmetries, it will be, together with the gauge
sector Lagrangian in eq.(2.10), the framework for our phenomenological analysis of the
composite Higgs scenario.
Chapter 2. Composite Higgs and the 4DCHM 17
2.2.3 The particle spectrum and the parameter space of the 4DCHM
The extended gauge symmetry and the new fermionic sector bring new particles into the
model and in particular in the 4DCHM there are 11 degrees of freedom associated with
vector bosons and 20 associated with spin 1/2 Dirac fermions. The spin 1 resonances
can be identified according to their SO(5) generators (see Appendix B) and it is possible
to recast their 11 degrees of freedom in terms of 3 charged and 5 neutral gauge bosons,
that will be from now on called in a generalized way as W i and Z
j with i = 1, 2, 3
and j = 1, . . . , 5, where an increase in the subscript number will indicate a higher mass
for the corresponding particle. From eq.(2.15) we see that the fermionic spectrum of
the 4DCHM also contains fermions with an exotic electric charge, besides the usual
ones with the SM U(1)em quantum number. In particular we have 8 new quarks with
charge 2/3 and 8 with charge 1/3, called in a generalized way ti and bi, and 2 quarks
with charge 5/3 and 4/3, called Xj and Yj respectively3. In the spirit of the partial
compositness these fields mix with their SM counterparts (except for X and Y for which
no SM partner is present) in such a way that the physical states will be a superposition
of the original fields
|SMphys = cos|SM+ sin|4DCHM
|4DCHMphys =  sin|SM+ cos|4DCHM (2.17)
where in principle the mass eigenstate could be a superposition of more than just two
fields and where the mixing angles are dependent on the model parameter. The remain-
der of the spectrum is made up of the rest of the SM fermions, the three generations
of leptons and the two lightest generations of quarks which will be treated as massless
particles belonging to the elementary sector, and the Higgs boson.
From the Lagrangian of eq.(2.10) and eq.(2.16) we notice that the 4DCHM presents quite
a large parameter space. In particular the gauge sector parameters are the model scale
f , the couplings of the SM gauge group g0 and g0Y , the SO(5)U(1)X gauge coupling
called g and, after the Higgs field develops a VEV, h. The parameters of the fermionic
sector are m, the mass parameters of the new quarks, the mixing parameters t/L,R
and b/L,R responsible for the elementary-composite mixing of the top and bottom
sectors, and YT,B, mYT,B responsible for the interactions of the extra quarks with the
Higgs boson. Not all these parameters are independent and in the next subsection, while
describing the implementation of the 4DCHM into dedicated automated tools, we will
also explain the constraints on the model parameters due to physical observables.
3With the same mass ordering convention as for the gauge boson, i = 1, . . . , 8 and j = 1, 2.
Chapter 2. Composite Higgs and the 4DCHM 18
2.2.4 The implementation of the 4DCHM into automated tools
It is clear that, due to the large number of particles and parameters of the model chosen
for our analysis, a detailed study of the latter, considering the full particle spectrum
without any expansion approximation in function of the model parameters, would have
been a really hard task to achieve. However in order to perform a rigorous phenomeno-
logical analysis of this framework at the LHC it is necessary to take into account all
the possible contributions that can modify the physical observables and it is therefore
important to keep the full particle spectrum of the model and to use the least approx-
imation possible. For this reason we chose to implement the 4DCHM into automated
tools to allow for an exact calculation of the model spectrum and a fast phenomeno-
logical analysis up to event generation. In this respect the publicly available tools that
we have used are LanHEP [23], which is a package for the automatic generations of
Feynman rules in a format that can be read by several MC generators, among which
there is CalcHEP [24] which has been our main MC generator for all of the analyses that
we will discuss in this Thesis. The model files in CalcHEP format have been uploaded
for public use onto the High Energy Physics Model Database (HEPMD) [25] under the
name 4DCHM 4.
Nevertheless the parameter space of the model ought to be constrained to be given as
an input to our MC generator, and in order to do so we have written a stand-alone
Mathematica [26] program that is able to perform a parameter scan accounting for
various constraints. We firstly wrote the gauge and the fermionic mass matrices, so
after the shifting h h, in function of the following parameters
f, g, g0, g0y, h,m,t/L,R,b/L,R, YT,B,mYT,B (2.18)
where the neutral and charged spin-1 mass matrices just depends on the first five. These
7  7 and 4  4 matrices, containing the , Z and W fields beside the new resonances,
have been diagonalised in order to find the corresponding eigenvalues (the masses of
the physical states) and eigenvectors (for the determinations of the angles in eq.(2.17))
constraining g0, g0y and h with respect to the EW precision observables
= 128.88,
MZ = 91.1876 GeV,
GF = 1.16639  105 GeV2,
(2.19)
and leaving f and g as input parameters. In the fermionic sector, due to the larger
number of parameters and particles, we have chosen to perform a random scan on m,
4That can be found at the following URL: http://hepmdb.soton.ac.uk/hepmdb:1212.0120.

t/L,R, b/L,R, YT,B, mYT,B after fixing the model scale f and the coupling g. The
scan has been performed requiring that the lowest eigenvalues of the 99 matrices for
the charge 2/3 and 1/3 quarks correspond with the top and bottom mass that, taking
into account the data from LEP, SLC, Tevatron and LHC, has been chosen to lie in the
conservative interval 165 GeV < mtop < 175 GeV and 2 GeV < mbot < 6 GeV, and
requiring the generation of a Higgs mass mH compliant with the latest LHC results
We conclude this Chapter by mentioning that, being CalcHEP a default tree-level MC
generator, it has been necessary in the analysis of the Higgs sector of the 4DCHM to
manually implement into it loop-induced interactions such as hgg and h, in order to
be able to study the related phenomenology. The results of the calculations of these
vertices will be presented in the related Chapter, when we will discuss the analysis of
the 4DCHM Higgs boson.
5In some parts of this Thesis these bounds could have been made more or less stringent. In that case
we will explicitly mention the range of values used in a specific analysis.
Chapter 3
Phenomenology of the gauge
sector of the 4DCHM
In this Chapter we analyse the LHC phenomenology of the Z s and W s of the 4DCHM,
focusing on the study of the DY and diboson production modes of such states. Af-
ter describing in detail the properties of the gauge sector of the model, we discuss the
potentiality of such processes in discovering the new gauge bosons belonging to the
4DCHM, both in cross sections and in asymmetries distributions, also paying attention
to the presence of multiple degenerate resonances that can be distinguishable in certain
regions of the parameter space. Finally, since these new resonances have sizeable cou-
plings to the third generation of SM quarks, we also study top-antitop pair production
at the LHC as a test-bed for discovering Z s states again both in cross section as well as
in various asymmetries. However, since the EW precision data generally disfavour extra
gauge bosons with mass below the TeV range and with large couplings to light fermions,
we will just focus on the 14 TeV stage of the CERN machine.
3.1 Masses and couplings of the gauge bosons of the 4DCHM
From the Lagrangian of eq.(2.10), using the explicit expression of  and  given in
eq.(2.7) and eq.(2.13) and expanding the Higgs field h onto its VEV, it is possible to
write an exact expression for the neutral and charged spin-1 mass matrices that can be
diagonalised in order to obtain masses and rotation matrices of the model. Plugging the
rotations into the fermionic Lagrangian of eq.(2.16) and in the Higgs field dependent part
of eq.(2.10) we can then find the couplings of the SM gauge bosons and extra resonances
to the SM and extra fermions, and also the coupling of the spin 1 states to the Higgs
boson. As mentioned, in all our phenomenological analysis we have performed an exact
Chapter 3. Phenomenology of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM 22
numerical diagonalisation of the relevant matrices, however we will present here some
useful analytical expressions obtained at the leading order in the expansion parameter
 = v2/f2 that, we recall, measures the misalignment between the vacuum of the theory
before and after the SU(2)L  U(1)Y gauging or, in other words, measures the degree
of compositness of the theory.
3.1.1 Masses of the gauge bosons

and where the masses of Z 1 and Z

receive any contribution from EWSB. For the charged sector we have, MW i+1

the vector resonances, and two with mass 
2fg, called the axial resonances. The
former mainly correspond to the gauge bosons associated with the T 3R  TX , T 3L and
T 3R+TX generators while the latter with T 3 and T 4. The charged partners of the vector
resonances are W 1 and W
2, associated with T
R  TR1  iTR2 and TL  TL1  iTL2,
while the axial partner is W 3, associated with the T
  T 1  T 2 combination.
3.1.2 Couplings of the gauge bosons to SM light fermions
The couplings of the neutral gauge bosons to the light SM fermions can be expressed by
the following Lagrangian

The Z 1 and Z
4 couplings to the light quarks are zero at all orders in the expansion
parameter  and these gauge bosons will therefore be inert for the processes under
consideration in this Chapter, as they dont couple to the proton constituents.
In the same way we can work out the expressions for the charged sector, that are
LCC =
W +i J

2(1 2c2)
, (3.12)
and where in this case it is W 1 that will be inert with respect to the processes under
consideration. The masses of the gauge bosons and their couplings to light generations of
quarks and all the three generations of leptons are independent of the parameters of the
fermionic sector at all orders in the expansion parameter  since the partial compositness
mechanism is implemented in the 4DCHM just for the third generation of quarks.
Finally, as mentioned, the parameters f, g, g0, g0Y and  (recast from h) are not all
independent and three of them can be constrained fromMZ , eq.(3.1), the electric charge
e, eq.(3.5), and the Fermi constant GF obtained from the charged current processes at

leaving us with just two free parameters in the gauge sector that have been chosen to
be f and g. Again, these constraints have been imposed in an exact numerical way in
implementing the model for our forthcoming phenomenological analysis.
3.2 Drell-Yan signals at the LHC
The DY mechanism is one of the most important probes in the search for new vec-
tor boson resonances associated with possible BSM scenarios. It consists of di lepton
production from hadron-hadron scattering via neutral current (NC) or charged current
(CC) processes, as shown in Fig. 3.1.
, Z0, Z i
Figure 3.1: Neutral current DY processes via SM and extra gauge bosons. The
corresponding charged current channel is mediated by a charged SM or extra gauge
boson, W or W i , and leads to a l
l final state (l
+l for the charged conjugated
process).
The importance of this process arises from the fact that from the theoretical point of
view such a mechanism is well under control as higher order effects from both EW and
QCD interactions are known up to one and two loop contributions respectively (see,
e.g., [27] for a review), while from the experimental point of view the directions and
energies of the particles of such final state are well reconstructed in a generic detector
at an hadron collider, consisting in fact of electrons or muons (e or ) and their related
neutrinos. Therefore, for all such reasons, this class of processes is ideal for identifying
the mass of the intermediate bosons being produced and studying their properties, and
nowadays the LHC offers us the chance to test DY phenomenology at high energy proton
proton scattering. DY processes for analogous scenarios have already been studied in
literature (see [28] and [29] for a general review), however, the purpose of this Thesis
is to perform a detailed phenomenological study of a specific CHM, the 4DCHM, that
implies also taking into account all the possible model dependent effects that can escape
from a general analysis. In this respect we will stress the importance of:
Chapter 3. Phenomenology of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM 26
- the impact of the fermionic parameter of the model onto the line shape of the
emerging gauge bosons,
- the possibility of being able to resolve, albeit limited to certain regions of the
parameter space, the two lightest (quasi) degenerate neutral active (non-inert)
resonances
3.2.1 Parameter space and benchmark points
Before tackling the analysis of the DY processes we ought to comment on the bounds
from the EWPT that affect the 4DCHM. As is well known, extra gauge bosons give
a positive contribution to the Peskin-Takeuchi S parameter and the requirement of
consistency with the EWPT generally gives a bound on the masses of these resonances
in CHMs around few TeV [30], while the fermionic sector is quite irrelevant for S since
the extra fermions are weakly coupled to the SM gauge boson. Either way, as stressed
in [31], when dealing with effective theories one can only parametrize S rather than
calculating it. In other words, since the construction of the 4DCHM just deals with the
lowest lying resonances neglecting those that, allowed by the symmetries, may exist and
that are not introduced in the construction under our consideration2, we need to invoke
an ultra violet (UV) completion for the physics effects that we are not including. These
effects can in general make the bound stronger, but not significantly. For example in
order to satisfy S  0.3 in the minimal composite Higgs model of Ref.[5], the lowest
vectors have to be heavier that 1.6 2.3 TeV, depending on the choice of some coupling
constants. Higher order operators in the chiral expansions can however compensate for
S, albeit with some tuning, and one example is illustrated in [31], while in [11] it is shown
that the inclusion of non-minimal interactions in the picture of the 4DCHM can lead
to the reduction of the S parameter. For all of these reasons in our phenomenological
analysis we will choose, omitting a systematic and detailed study of the EWPT, values of
the spin-1 resonances masses around 2 TeV in order to avoid big contributions to the S
parameter, that will reflect on the choice of values of f  1 TeV and g  2, according to
eq.(3.1) and eq.(3.3). Furthermore we have checked that our 4DCHM parameter choices,
for any sorted point, are compatible with LHC direct searches for heavy gauge bosons
[3235] while, for the moment, we are neglecting the bounds arising from the direct
searches of extra fermions. In particular, we will present our results for the following
2While they arise naturally in the context of CHMs formulated in 5 dimensions, see for example [5].
Chapter 3. Phenomenology of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM 27
combinations of the parameter f and g
a) (f, g) = (750 GeV, 2)
b) (f, g) = (800 GeV, 2.5)
c) (f, g) = (1000 GeV, 2)
d) (f, g) = (1200 GeV, 1.8)
(3.14)
for each of which we have scanned on the parameters of the fermionic sector with the
following constraints: 500 GeV < t/L,R, YT,B < 5000 GeV, 5000 GeV < mYT/B <
500 GeV and, in the spirit of partial compositness, 50 GeV < b/L,R, YT,B < 500 GeV,
requiring the values of mtop, mbot and mH described in Section 2.2.4. These choices of f
and g have been made with the purpose of illustrating the salient features of the model
for a quasi constant mass of the gauge resonances, varying however the model scale f .
In varying the parameters of the fermionic sector we found that one of the extreme model
dependent effects, that will have a dramatic influence on the effectiveness of the DY
analysis, is the dependence of the widths of the resonances with respect to the fermionic
spectrum of the model. From eq.(2.16) we observe in fact that the coupling constant
of the extra gauge bosons with the extra fermions of the model is proportional to g
modulus a combination of cosi, where i are the rotation angles of the transformation
of eq.(2.17). Therefore, when the mass of a spin-1 resonances is such that the decay
in a pair of extra fermions is allowed, its decay widths will become much larger with
respect to the region of parameter space where this decay is not allowed. We then chose
to divide these configurations in various regimes of the extra resonances widths that we
can present as follows:
- Small width regime: the threshold for the decay in a pair of extra fermions has not
been reached and the dominant decay channels are the ones in SM gauge bosons
and fermions. In this situation the widths of the extra gauge bosons are well below
100 GeV for a mass of  2 TeV.
- Medium width regime: the threshold for the decay in a pair of extra fermions has
just been reached. In this situation the width over mass ratio can be of order
 25%
- Large width regime: the threshold for the decay in a pair of extra fermions has
been abundantly surpassed and the widths of the extra gauge bosons can become
comparable with their mass.
These situations are illustrated in Fig. 3.2 and Fig. 3.3 for the choices of f = 800 GeV,
g = 2.5 and f = 1200 GeV, g = 1.8, respectively, where we plot the widths, s, of
Chapter 3. Phenomenology of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM 28
the lightest non-inert and heaviest neutral and charged spin-1 resonances in function
of the mass of the lightest charge 2/3 extra quark. The masses of the non-inert gauge
bosons for these two configurations are reported in Tab. 3.1. We notice that the small
and medium/large width regime corresponds to almost two different regions, which are
clearly distinguishable for the case of Z 2 and W
2 and less so in the case of Z
5 and W
and separated roughly at the point 2mt
= mZ,W  . Already this aspect is of interest
from a phenomenological point of view since it relates the size of the width of the extra
gauge boson with the presence of an extra quark under or above the threshold  f g/2.
These different configurations in the parameter space might lead to interestingly phe-
nomenological possibilities, but in order to assess whether they are accessible at the LHC
via DY processes we first need to define some specific benchmark points representative of
the regimes already described. We will do so by investigating both the different regimes
for a fixed choice of the parameters f and g, namely f = 1200 GeV and g = 1.8, that
correspond to fixed masses of the extra gauge bosons and fixed couplings of them to SM
light quarks, by just varying the parameters affecting the fermionic sector of the model,
and then analysing benchmark points for the other combinations of the model scale and
the extra gauge coupling of eq.(3.14).

is above, below and well below the threshold for the decay of the gauge boson in a pair
of them, and this will clearly reflect on the branching ratios of the states. While in
the small width regime they are dominated by decays into SM particles, mainly third
generation quarks and gauge bosons, in the medium and large width regime the main
decay modes are the ones in a pair of extra fermions, and rates in SM particles are
reduced well below the percent level as we can see in Tab. 3.3 where we report the
branching ratios of the Z 2 for the choice of parameters related to the widths of Tab. 3.2.

Other combinations of fermionic parameters that will be used in the analysis, correspond-
ing then to other widths of the gauge bosons, can be found in Tab. C.1 in Appendix
C together with the input parameters corresponding to the different choices of the pa-
rameters f and g of eq.(3.14), see Tab. C.2, with the caveat that in those cases we will
just analyse regimes corresponding to small widths, which we will see to be a necessary
condition for the extraction of the 4DCHM signal over the SM background.
3.2.2 Simulation
Our numerical MC simulations have been performed by means of a code based on helicity
amplitudes, defined through the HELAS subroutine [37] and assembled with MadGraph
[38], which has been validated against CalcHEP [24]. The matrix elements (MEs) gen-
erated account for all off-shellness effects of the particles involved. Two different phase
space implementations were used, an ad hoc one, based on Metropolis [39], and a blind
one based on RAMBO [40], checked against each other. The latter was adopted eventu-
ally, as it proved the most unbiased one in sampling the multiple resonances existing in
Chapter 3. Phenomenology of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM 31
the model. Further, VEGAS [41, 42] was finally used for the multi dimensional numeri-
cal integrations. All these additional subroutines were also validated against CalcHEP
outputs.
The MEs have been computed at leading order (LO). Clearly, in the LHC environment,
QCD corrections are not negligible and associated scale uncertainties may have an impact
on the dynamics of Z s and W s production and decay (see Refs. [43, 44] for the case
of the SM Z and W channels). In fact, EW corrections may also be relevant [45, 46].
However, the treatment we are adopting here of the two DY channels is such that real
radiation of gluons and photons would be treated inclusively (i.e., no selection is enforced
here that relies on the gluon and photon dynamics), so that we do not expect such QCD
effects to have an impact on the distributions that we will be considering, neither those
of the cross sections nor those of the asymmetries, apart from an overall rescaling.
The latter, in particular, when implemented at large invariant and transverse mass, is
affected by a residual uncertainty of 5% at the most [45, 46]. The parton distribution
functions (PDFs) used were CTEQ5L [47], with factorisation and renormalisation scale
set at Q =  =
s. (we have verified that later PDF sets do not generate any significant
difference in the results we are going to present3). Initial state quarks have been taken
as massless, just like the final state leptons and neutrinos.
3.2.3 Results
We now consider the two tree-level processes of Fig. 3.1

presenting our results for either of the flavours and not summing on the two, in order
to be able to discuss separately the different mass reconstruction resolution, that can
change significantly from electrons to muons. Considering for example the neutral case,
where the mass involved in reconstructing the Z  resonance is the invariant one
Ml+l =
(pl + pl+)
2, pl = (p
0, ~p), (3.16)
and considering a typical resonance of our benchmarks around 2 TeV, the mass resolu-
tions are about 1% and 10% for e+e and +, respectively. In the CC channel the
3Furthermore, we have estimated the theoretical uncertainty (at next to leading order (NLO)) due to
the PDFs by adopting NNPDF sets [48], which yielded a 10% effect at the most, rather independent of
the Z and W  masses involved and with negligible impact onto the shape of the differential distributions
presented.

and ETmiss being the lepton transverse energy and missing transverse energy respectively,
where px,y are the momenta component in x-y plane assuming that the proton beams
are directed along the z direction. For MT the mass resolution is about 20%, being
dominated by the uncertainty in reconstructing the ETmiss, due to the neutrino escap-
ing the detector. We then impose standard acceptance cuts on the lepton transverse

(3.19)
where l is the angle between the particle momenta and the beam axis. In order to
reduce the SM background we will apply a cut on the invariant and transverse mass
for the NC and CC channel, respectively, that will depend on the choice of the (f , g)
combination and that will be listed when we present the results.
As a first result we show in Fig. 3.4 the contours for the S/
B values, from which it is
possible to compute the statistical significance 
 (3.20)
where L is the integrated luminosity and  the reconstruction efficiency of a given final
state. We show the results for the NC process at the 14 TeV LHC for two arbitrary
configurations of Z/mZ , 1% (a) and 10 % (b). From the plots we already observe
that in order to have a high S/
B value, and so a high exclusion or discovery power,
a small value of the Z/mZ ratio is compulsory, due to the otherwise decrease of the
branching ratio into leptonic final state, no matter the choice of f and g. We do not
show the results for a higher value of the width over mass ratio, for which the S/
value becomes even smaller.
We now focus on realistic points in the 4DCHM parameter space, that is, we choose
benchmarks arising from the constrained parameter scan described in Chapter 2, and
we first show the results for the cross section distributions in invariant mass for the
choices of the benchmark points with fixed f = 1200 GeV and g = 1.8 of Tab. C.1,

that correspond to different decreasing values of the masses of the extra fermions and
therefore increasing values of the gauge bosons widths (see again [36] for the values of
the widths of all the gauge bosons in these configurations). As we can see from Fig. 3.5,
when the values of the Z s and W s widths are small enough, say for the red, green cyan
and magenta lines, a clear excess over the SM background, that is covered by the yellow
line, is visible, while as the values of Zs and W s grow (black and yellow lines) the
signal shape flattens down with the ultimate tendency, for very large widths, that the
extraction of a narrow resonance is no longer possible, both in the neutral and in the
charged sector. For this reason we will now present results for benchmark points with
different values of f and g (Tab. C.2), focusing however only on the case where the
widths are small enough, Zi,W
/MZi,W
 1 5%, to test this sector of the model with
DY processes.
The results of the invariant mass distributions for these choices are shown in Fig. 3.6 for
the NC and Fig. 3.7 for the CC case. From Fig. 3.6 we note that, while the two lightest
Z  resonances are clearly accessible, this is not the case for the heaviest one, Z 5, which is
much suppressed due to its higher mass, 
2fg, and smaller couplings which have a
leading order contribution proportional to
, eq.(3.7), and for which we have not shown
the corresponding mass range in the plots except, marginally, in Fig. 3.6 (d). A clear
excess is always seen near the quasi degenerate Z 2 and Z
3 masses and, while in some
cases they are not resolvable, in others they can be separated, certainly in e+e but not
in +. Notice in fact that the bin width in the plots is 2 GeV, so that even assembling
ten of them in the case of an electron pair final state will not spoil the ability to establish
Chapter 3. Phenomenology of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM 34
the two resonances separately, while this is not the case for a muon pair final state since,
due to the mentioned 10% mass resolution, this will imply integrating over a hundred
bins. The overall cross sections are O(1  10 fb) which render each of these parameter
configurations accessible at the 14 TeV LHC, albeit limited to the lowest resonances only.
From the CC process of Fig. 3.7 we can see that only the lightest of the two resonances
involved, W 2 and W
3, can be detected since for the heaviest one the same consideration
applies as in the case of Z 5. Having to use the transverse mass variable, since in this case
is not possible to reconstruct the invariant mass of the decaying resonances, which is less
correlated with the mass of the decaying W , the visible peaks are broader compared to
the NC case. However even in this case the total signal is clearly visible over the SM
background, although limited to the lightest resonance, and event rates are somewhat
larger with respect to the neutral current case.

cross section at the 14 TeV LHC for the NC (a) and CC (b) DY process for the choice
of benchmark points with f=1200 GeV and g = 1.8 of Tab. C.1 where the colours
correspond to: red (a), green (b), cyan (c), magenta (d), black (e) and yellow (f).
Red, black and yellow lines correspond to the small, medium and large width regime
previously discussed. Cuts on the invariant and transverse mass are 2 TeV. Integrated
cross sections are 0.78, 0.56, 0.52, 0.47, 0.26 and 0.23 fb with a SM background of 0.21
fb in the NC case and 1.11, 0.79, 0.76, 0.70, 0.36 and 0.30 fb with a SM background of
0.23 fb in the CC case.
In both the NC and the CC case it is possible to define the forward backward asymmetry
(AFB) of the cross section, as the direction of the reference incoming quark or antiquark
can be inferred from the direction of the boost onto the final state in the laboratory
frame. The AFB can be sampled in invariant (NC) or transverse (CC) mass bins by
defining

d(cos  > 0)/dM + d(cos  < 0)/dM

the direction of the reference incoming quark or antiquark and M = Ml+l , MT for
the NC and CC processes respectively. In the CC case however one cannot reconstruct
unambiguously the longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum in order to define

the asymmetry, because of the twofold solution from the mass equation. We therefore
take both solutions and plot them with a half weight each, which somewhat dilutes the
asymmetry, in order to individuate the direction of the boost. This is done by assuming
that the invariant mass of the final state corresponds to the SM W mass in case of the
SM hypothesis and with the W 2,3 in case of the 4DCHM one, where an indicative value
of the latter can be obtained from the neutral gauge bosons mass, given the correlation
between the Z s and W s masses. We show the results for the NC and CC cases in
Fig. 3.8 and Fig. 3.9 respectively, where the bins width are now 50 GeV, for the same
benchmark points used for Fig. 3.6 and Fig. 3.7. From the NC case we see that such an
observable displays a peculiar dependence in the vicinity of the Z s masses, including
also the heaviest one, Z 5, for all the chosen combinations of f and g, while in the CC
case we notice that the resolving power of the resonance in the AFB is diminished, as
the presence of the heaviest W  is hardly visible. Also, while in the NC case we can
claim that these effects should be resolvable, no matter what the final state, since the bin
width here is 50 GeV, the same is not true for the CC case, due to the worst resolution

for the transverse mass.
However, in order to be able to quantitatively address the distinguishability between the
4DCHM and the SM, the statistical errors on the predictions ought to be calculated.
While they are quite irrelevant in the case of the cross section, we need to pay particular
attention to the AFB distributions. Given that the AFB is defined in terms of the num-
ber of events measured in a forward (NF ) and backward (NB) direction, the statistical
error is evaluated by propagating the Poisson error on each measured quantity, that is
NF,B =

of the relative error bars, that are calculated for L =1500 fb1 and =90%, for the choice
of f = 1200 GeV and g = 1.8 in the small width regime assumption. We see that the
resonant effects in AFB can still be discernible with respect to the SM noise in both
the NC and CC case, albeit limited to the lowest lying resonances only in both cases,
so long as very high luminosity can be attained, and that in the neutral case, for a di
electron final state, Z 5 also remains however an open possibility.
Before closing this Section we want to point out how the mass correlation between the
neutral and charged gauge resonances, dictated by the group structure of the model, can
be exploited to improve searches in either of the neutral or charged channels. Suppose
that (justified by the fact that the events rates in the CC case are somewhat bigger than
in the NC case) a W  resonance has been seen in the transverse mass spectrum and
nothing appears, after standard acceptance cuts, in the invariant mass distribution, the
knowledge of the W  mass also implies the knowledge of the Z  mass, so that, to exalt
the resonance associated with the latter, one may impose onto the di lepton NC sample

the opposite exercise can also be carried out if it is a Z  the first one to have been seen,
which could occur, for example, in the case of a very narrow width, helping to improve
the W  signal selection also in this case.

ton, for the latter, plus missing transverse energy arise from the topologies of Fig. 3.11;
we will refer to them as the 2l and 3l signatures respectively. The importance of such
processes lies in the fact that, besides the couplings also involved in the DY processes,
these channels allow us to access the triple gauge self couplings of a model, a crucial
ingredient in order to pin down the underlying EW gauge structure. From an experi-
mental point of view it is again the cleanliness of this channel that renders it a favourite
from an experimental point of view, while high order QCD and EW corrections are well
under control (see again [27] for a review).
Figure 3.11: Feynman diagrams topologies contributing to the 2l and 3l processes of
eq.(3.23). The wavy lines correspond to any of the EW gauge bosons of the 4DCHM.
For our phenomenological analysis we relied on the same subroutines used for the DY
case, with the addition that both PHACT [49] and HELAS [37] have been used as a
code based on the helicity amplitude method, and cross checked against each other.
Again the MEs account for all the off shellness effects of the particles involved and were
constructed starting from the topologies in Fig. 3.11, where the wavy lines refer to any
of the gauge bosons belonging to the 4DCHM.
We now define some other kinematic variables, apart from the one already used for the
DY study, that will be used to define acceptance and selection criteria of the final states
in the processes of eq.(3.23)

where, besides the first two, that are standard acceptance cuts, they have been applied
in order to suppress the SM background leaving however a not too small signal cross
section.
We then show in Fig. 3.12 the cross section distributions in ETmiss and p
M for the
benchmark point with f = 1200 GeV and g = 1.8 of Tab. C.2. We notice that the fact
that it is not possible to detect all the final state particles, due to the presence of the two
neutrinos, makes it very hard to achieve a clear identification of the intermediate vector
bosons. However the effect of the extra neutral gauge bosons appears as an excess of
events in some energy measure below the value corresponding to the new gauge boson
mass, while unfortunately there is no observable that allows us to have a signature of
the new charged gauge bosons involved. Since in the 4DCHM the Z 2 and Z
3 are close in
mass, and the Z 5 state is heavier and very weakly coupled to SM fermions, the results in
this figure essentially highlight the masses of the quasi degenerate Z 2,3 at the end point
of the excess region extending to the left of their mass value in the case of ETmiss or to
the left of a half of it in the case of pTM . We then present in Tab. 3.5 the cross sections
for the benchmark points of Tab. C.2 after the application of the cuts given in eq.(3.24)

discovery, respectively  = 2 and  = 5, for the benchmark with f = 1200 GeV and
g=2, it is necessary to require an integrated luminosity for the 14 TeV LHC of  62
fb1 and 400 fb1. Analysing also the other benchmarks it is generally clear that the
lightest Z s can usually be extracted, if not with the standard luminosity LHC, surely
with a high luminosity upgrade of the CERN machine. We do not report here the results
for the benchmark points with fixed f and g and variable widths, for which we refer
to [50], where they have been analysed in detail, but we mention that the extraction of
the lightest neutral resonances is possible so long as their widths are small enough with
respect to their mass, on the same footing as for the DY analysis.

3.3.2 The 3l signature
Before proceeding with the study of this signature, a subtlety should be noted. Some of
the kinematical variables previously defined implicitly assume the capability to identify,
in the final state of process of eq.(3.23), the two leptons coming from the neutral current
(propagated by the , Z, Z 2, Z
5 states). In the l = e and l
 =  (or vice versa)
case this is trivial, since the pair of leptons with identical flavour are necessarily those
emerging from such a current. In the case l = l = e or  the identification is in
principle ambiguous. However, in Ref. [51], an efficient method was devised to overcome
this problem, by noting that the maximum amongst the transverse momenta of all
pair of particles is generally the one induced by the pair of leptons emerging from
the , Z, Z2, Z3, Z5 current, so that this enables us to enforce the same cuts onto the
final state of the process of eq.(3.23), irrespectively of the actual l, l combination being
generated.
The acceptance and selection criteria that maximise the sensitivity to the 3l signature
that have been imposed are
|l,l+,l | < 2, p
> 20 GeV, ETmiss > 50 GeV,
Mll+, ll, l+l > 20 GeV, p
M > 150 GeV, cos
< 0.5,
cos ll+,ll,l+l < 0.9, p
+, ll
, l
> 150 GeV,
Mll+l > 0.9 MW 2 .
(3.25)
The last cut, which unlike the others depends on a 4DCHM parameter, is actually
justified by the results of the previous Section, where we have showed that the extraction
of a value for MW 
can be made through the DY channel. We want to show now that
the process 3l of eq.(3.23) can act as an effective means to extract part of the mass
spectrum of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM that is not accessible elsewhere. It is crucial
however, in order to accomplish this, that the 3l process affords one the possibility to
reconstruct the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino, with the algorithm described
in [52]. Therefore, alongside Ml+l , sensitive to the neutral gauge boson resonances,
we can also plot the reconstructed CM energy at the partonic level,
s = ERcm, which is
sensitive to the charged gauge boson resonance.
We then show in Fig. 3.13, again for the choice f=1200 GeV and g = 1.8, the differential
cross section distributions in terms of these two kinematic variables, from which we
recognise again the presence of the non resolvable Z 2,3 resonances as well as, for the
first time, that of the W 3 in the E
cm distribution, which didnt occur either in the DY
analysis or in the 2l channel; in contrast Z 5 does not emerge again over the background.
Chapter 3. Phenomenology of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM 44
Finally theW 2, whilst evident in the reconstructed CM energy at partonic level, is clearly
mimicked by the SM background, in view of the last cut in eq.(3.25), which renders the
signal and background very similar.

Figure 3.13: Differential cross sections in Mll+ and E
cm for the benchmark with
f=1200 GeV and g=1.8 for which the complete set of input parameters can be found in
Tab. C.2 for the 3l process of eq.(3.23). The red solid curve represents the full 4DCHM,
while the black dashed the SM background.
One peculiar feature of the 3l process is that, unlike the 2l case, it is at times charac-
terized by a large negative interference between the 4DCHM and the SM contribution,
induced by the signs of the fermion gauge boson as well as trilinear couplings of the
4DCHM with respect to those of the SM, which can onset precisely where the masses
of the new gauge bosons are. This is ultimately responsible for the generic smallness of
the cross sections for the 3l process with respect to the 2l ones, up to the point that the
actual signal could be a depletion of the expected SM rate, in the relevant mass region.
We then show in Tab. 3.6 and Tab. 3.7 the signal and background rates integrated over
theMl+ll range between 2 and 3 TeV (except for benchmark (a) for which we integrate
from 1.5 to 2 TeV), i.e., the Z 2,3 peak region, and over the E
cm range between 2.5 TeV
and 4 TeV (except for benchmark (a) for which we integrate from 2 to 4 TeV), i.e., theW3
peak region, respectively. In the same tables, assuming now an overall tagging efficiency
of 50%, we present the significance  of the signal for 1000 fb1 of integrated luminosity
as well as its minimal value required to claim detection,  = 5. While the extraction
of the signal is possible in a few instances with standard luminosities expected at the
14 TeV stage of the LHC, in others this requires much larger data samples, probably
obtainable only at the currently considered HL-LHC stage. Again we do not show the
results for the benchmarks with fixed f and variable gauge bosons widths, for which
we refer to [50], just mentioning here that signal rates dramatically drop down with the
growth of the widths of the extra gauge boson.
Chapter 3. Phenomenology of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM 45
Finally, if one computes the event rates for process 3l of (3.23) after the cuts in eq.(3.25)
without any selection and extraction around the resonance peaks, as described before,
the effects of the aforementioned negative interferences are apparent, to the extent that
most of the chosen benchmark points become inaccessible at the standard LHC and the
HL-LHC would become the only available option, as we show in Tab. 3.8. Is is then
clear that a high resolution sampling in various kinematic distributions is of fundamental
importance to establish a signal in this channel at the LHC and this is clearly impossible
at the 7 and 8 TeV energy stages, given the limited data samples collected therein.

3.4 Z   tt signals at the LHC
In order to establish the Z  and W  sector of a BSM model it would be sufficient in
principle to consider just DY and diboson processes that allow us to test all the couplings
of the gauge bosons to fermions, assuming universality across generations, and the triple
self interactions of the gauge bosons, further recalling that the quartic couplings are not
gauge independent per se. Clearly this statement is not valid any more if we dismiss
the universality hypothesis, which is precisely what happens in the 4DCHM where the
extended fermionic sector of the third generation of quarks reflects on their different
couplings to the gauge bosons with respect the ones of the light generations. In particular
in our CHM scenario the extra gauge bosons present in the spectrum can have sizeable
couplings to the third quark generation, being in fact the tt final state one of the main
branching ratio of such states if the heavy fermionic decay channels are not open, see
Tab. 3.2. We therefore now study the production of top antitop pairs, Fig. 3.14, at the
LHC as a test bed for discovering the heavy Z s present in the 4DCHM.
, Z0, Z i
Figure 3.14: Feynman diagram for the production of tt pair via neutral SM and extra
EW gauge bosons.
In such a scenario however various complications, with respect to the DY and diboson
processes, must be overcome if one intends to probe the Z s states. These complications
arise from a large background due to the QCD top pair production cross section and
a more involved final state, yielding at least six objects in the detector after the decay
of the top quarks, with an associated poor efficiency in reconstructing the two heavy
quarks. Although this is an arduous challenge, it reveals its rewards since the spin
properties of the top quark are transmitted to the decay products, in view of the fact
that it decays before hadronising, and that the electromagnetic charge of the top can be
tagged via a lepton or a b jet [53, 54]. This can be extremely useful in profiling the Z s
states as various asymmetries, effective in pinning down the couplings of these states, can
be defined theoretically and measured experimentally [55, 56]. These asymmetries can
be defined in a wider variety, thanks to the decay chain Z   tt  bbW+W  bbX,
where with X we label the possible decay products of the W bosons, and moreover the
large top mass induces non trivial spin correlations, again sensitive to the nature of the
Chapter 3. Phenomenology of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM 48
intermediate Z s states. Guided by these considerations, experimental collaborations
both at Tevatron [57, 58] and LHC [59, 60] have been studying the tt data samples,
while from the theoretical point of view in this process higher order effects from both
QCD [6163] and EW [6467] interactions are also well known.
3.4.1 Couplings of the neutral gauge bosons to tt
The couplings of the neutral gauge bosons to the top quark can be derived in a similar
way to the one used for deriving the couplings to light quarks and leptons. However, due
to the partial compositness mechanism, these couplings also depend on the parameters
of the fermionic sector and this reflects in more complicated analytical expressions also
because we have to diagonalise a nine dimensional matrix for the charge 2/3 quarks in
order to find corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors. For this reason we will present
the expression for the couplings at the order  = 0, that is, neglecting any contribution
arising from EWSB, and, in this approximation, the neutral current Lagrangian for the
top sector reads

Notice that, in the  = 0 approximation,  is equal to the Weinberg angle defined by:

In fact, the following relation holds in the 4DCHM:
sc  sW cW (1 g(, )), g(, ) =
(6s2 + 4s4  3s2 + 2s4). (3.31)
The Z 4 resonance has zero coupling also to tt at all orders in perturbation theory and,
together with Z 1, is inert to the process under consideration since it doesnt couple to
the proton constituents. Moreover, since we found that the Z 5 state is not accessible
even in this process, we will refrain from presenting results related to it. Finally, the
expression for the top mass at the leading order in  is the following
m2top  
2tL
Y 2T
(1 + FL)(1 + FR)
. (3.32)
Besides taking into account the constraints due to the EWPT and the direct searches
of extra gauge bosons, we now also consider the bounds on the extra fermions present
in the model, that can be produced in hadron hadron collision, and that, due to the
mixing with the top quark, can affect the coupling of the latter to the extra neutral gauge
bosons. The most stringent bounds on the production of ts come from the LHC and rely
on the QCD pair production mechanism. To compare with the experimental results that
assume an exclusive branching ratio in a given final state (W+b and Zt mainly4) we have
then rescaled the production cross section for the process (pp(qq, gg)  titi), calculated
with the code described in [68], in order to take into account the non 100% branching
ratios in the 4DCHM of the ts in the decay channels searched for by the experimental
collaborations. As we will show in Chapter 5, in order to recast in a consistent way the
experimental limits, one has to deal also with the possible enhancement of the signal
due to the presence of more than one extra quark in the spectrum. However we will
postpone this discussion until the end of this Thesis, using now the simplified results
that we have obtained that limits the heavy quark masses to values above 500 GeV or
so, and therefore we have excluded such masses in the forthcoming parameter scans for
which we will present our results.
Finally we have used for this analysis the same tools as for the DY and diboson cases,
with the only difference that the PDFs set chosen has been CTEQ6L1 [69] with factori-
sation and renormalisation scale set to Q =  MZ
4Note that more recent searches, assuming variable branching ratios for the decay channels of extra
fermions, have been produced by ATLAS and CMS: we will discuss on this in Chapter 5.
Chapter 3. Phenomenology of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM 50
3.4.2 Asymmetries
We describe now some asymmetries for which we will present our results highlighting
their main characteristics.
3.4.2.1 Charge asymmetry
The charge asymmetry, already defined for the DY case, is a measure of the symmetry
of a process under charge conjugation. In this process it can only be generated from the
qq initial state due to the symmetry of the gluon gluon system and it can occur via both
subtle NLO QCD effects, as described in detail in [70, 71], as well as more standard EW
ones. We repeat here the definition of this asymmetry given in eq.(3.21)
AFB =
N(cos  > 0)N(cos  < 0)
N(cos  > 0) +N(cos  < 0)
(3.33)
where cos  is defined with the z axis in the direction of the rapidity of the top antitop
system ytt, and  is the polar angle in the tt rest frame, i.e. the CM system at parton
level, to which the entire event can generally be boosted to, whatever the actual final
state produced by the tt pair after it decays [60, 72, 73]. This observable can only be
generated by a Z  boson if its vector and axial couplings to both the initial and final
state fermions are non-vanishing.
3.4.2.2 Spin asymmetry
The spin asymmetry focuses on the helicity structure of the final state fermions and,
when such properties are measurable, displays interesting dependences on the chiral
structure of the Z s couplings. The helicity of a final state can only be experimentally
determined for a decaying final state, where the asymmetries are extracted as coefficients
in the angular distribution of its decay products. This is well described for the case of
top quarks in [53, 74]. As such, since our implementation will be only at the parton
level, our analysis does not represent the full reconstruction and extraction chain of
such observables but it is still able to highlight their potential strength if we estimate
the reconstruction efficiencies from recent experimental publications. We will elaborate
more on this point in Section 3.4.3.
The first observable that we define is the polarisation, or single spin asymmetry, AL
N(,) +N(,+)N(+,+)N(+,)
NTotal
, (3.34)
Chapter 3. Phenomenology of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM 51
where N denotes the number of observed events and its first and second argument
corresponds to the helicity of the final state particle and antiparticle respectively, whereas
NTotal is the total number of events. It singles out one of the two final state particles,
comparing the number of its positive and negative helicities, while summing over the ones
of the other antiparticle, or vice versa. This observable is proportional to the product of
the vector and axial couplings of the final state only and is therefore additionally sensitive
to their relative sign, a unique feature among asymmetries and cross section observables
being, in other words, a measure of the relative handedness of the Z  couplings to the
final state.
In the case of a highly massive final state, such as the top quark, the spin correlation
ALL, or double spin asymmetry, is accessible. This observable relies on the helicity
flipping of either of the final state particles, whose amplitude is proportional to mt/
where
s is the partonic CM energy, and it gives the proportion of like sign final states
against the opposite sign ones
ALL =
N(+,+) +N(,)N(+,)N(,+)
NTotal
. (3.35)
This observable depends only on the square of the couplings in a similar way to the
total cross section. In the massless limit ALL becomes maximal, making it a relevant
quantity to measure only in the tt final state.
3.4.3 Results
Before presenting our results for the process
pp , Z0, Z i  tt (3.36)
we ought to make a consideration about the validity of our analysis in terms of recon-
struction efficiencies of the tt final state. As mentioned, one of the primary complications
of such a final state is the difficulty in reconstructing a six body final state. Ideally one
would perform a full chain of event generation, parton showering and hadronisation with
a final detector simulation in order to get an accurate representation of the reconstruc-
tion process for observables of interest, and the associated efficiencies will depend on the
information required for the observable and the particular decay channel of the tt system.
However since our analysis is limited to a parton level study, without subsequent decay
of the tt final state, we need to give a reasonable estimate of the reconstruction efficien-
cies so that our predictions correspond better to the reality of a detector environment.
We have estimated these quantities in a conservative manner by gauging the selection
efficiencies from the requirements of each observable in each decay channel, taking the
Chapter 3. Phenomenology of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM 52
sum of these and defining a net efficiency to reconstruct a tt event coming from a high
mass,  2 TeV, Z , weighing by the branching ratios: from this we will take the average
efficiencies to be 10%. However we want to point out that for some observables, like the
top polarisation asymmetry, this assumption might be too optimistic stressing then that
our results remain of illustrative nature and are given in order to show that this model
has the potentiality to be investigated further in the tt channel.
In order to establish the regions of the parameter space of the 4DCHM where at least
one Z   tt signal can be established, we have performed a scan over the fermionic
parameters of the model in the same range as declared in Section 3.2.1, with the only
difference that the top mass has now been constrained to be in the 170-175 GeV range.
We have used both CalcHEP [24] and MadGraph [38] to compute cross sections for the
8 and 14 TeV LHC in the presence of the following selection cuts
+ Z
< Mtt <
+ Z
(3.37)
that is selecting a window for the lightest Z s bosons, where Mtt =
(pt + pt)
2 is the
invariant mass of the tt final state5. The signal S has again been defined as the difference
between the total 4DCHM rate, T , and the SM background, B, and the dimensional
significance has been computed as S/
B from which we can calculate the statistical
significance  with the mean of eq.(3.20). The results for the scans over two benchmark
points, f=1000 GeV, g=2 and f=1200 GeV, g=1.8 defined in Tab. C.2, are presented
in Fig. 3.15.

5Due to the large widths of these Zs in certain region of the parameter space lower and upper bounds
on the selection cut have been imposed to be the maximum and minimum between the ones of eq.(3.37)
and 2mt and
Chapter 3. Phenomenology of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM 53
We can clearly see the relationship between the mass scale of the first charge 2/3 quark
resonance and the visibility of the extra gauge bosons, connected to the already men-
tioned increase of their widths with the opening of the extra fermionic decay channels,
which prevents any significant deviation from the SM background. We notice that in the
case of large width the value S/
B can become negative and this is due again, as in the
diboson case, to interference effects which yield a negative total signal S. However we
do not associate any physical meaning with this negative dimensional significance, also
in view of the fact that these off peak effects may have consequences down to very low
invariant masses, perhaps even near the tt threshold, and this may not only already be
constrainable with current LHC data, but would certainly require analyses with back-
ground estimates beyond leading order to have a more precise prediction of the overall
shape and normalisation of the invariant mass spectrum, without which it is difficult to
make meaningful statements about such deficits in the production cross section over a
largeMtt range. It is however clear from the plots that once again our intended resonant
analysis becomes difficult beyond the limit in which the Z s are narrow and cannot decay
into heavy fermions and, with this in mind, we will now analyse some specific benchmark
points, namely the ones of eq.(3.14), focusing again on the small width regime, that is
using again the values of the input parameters of Tab. C.2, considering only the 14 TeV
stage of the LHC with an integrated luminosity of 300 fb1 as the scope at smaller value
s and L is limited.
In order to get a feel for the strength of the asymmetry observables studied, we also
define an illustrative measure of theoretical significance of an asymmetry prediction for
the signal AS as the number of standard deviations it lies away from the background
prediction, AB,
|AS AB|
A2S + A
, (3.38)
which, again, remains within the scope of our parton level analysis. As such, they
should not be interpreted as true LHC significances, but be indicative of the strength of
a particular observable.
We then show in Fig. 3.16 and Fig. 3.17 the differential values of the cross section and
of the asymmetries AL, ALL and AFB
 as a function of the invariant mass of the top
pair for the choice (b) and (d) of Tab. C.2. As a first result we see that, contrary to
the DY case, here it is no longer possible to separate the two light Z s peaks, due to the
mass resolution of the tt pairs being of the order of 100 GeV6 and that, again, the Z 5
never emerges from the background, and this is shown in frames (a) where the results
for the differential cross section are binned over artificially narrow Mtt bins of 5 GeV
6Somewhat better for semi leptonic decay channels and somewhat worst for fully hadronic and leptonic
ones.
Chapter 3. Phenomenology of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM 54
width and in frames (b) where we adopt more realistic 100 GeV bins. Despite this it is
possible to achieve a significance greater than 5 with L = 300 fb1 and  = 10% for the
choice f = 1200 GeV and g = 1.8 and somewhat smaller for f = 800 GeV and g = 2.5.
In the other panels we show, again with a 5 GeV (left) and 100 GeV (right) binning,
the results for the asymmetries that can complement the scope of the cross section as
in all the cases they offer a similar level of significance, so that the contributions of the
former and the latter can be combined, when needed, to increase significance. Finally
if we allow the extra fermions to have a lighter mass, increasing the widths of the extra
gauge bosons, the ability of both the cross section and asymmetries diminish, though
for these cases we refer to [75] for a detailed analysis and related results.

3.5 Conclusions
In this Chapter we have analysed the Z  and W  sector of the 4DCHM in three various
production processes, two yielding leptonic final states and one in which the extra gauge
bosons produce a top antitop quark pair. By means of the first two we have shown that
the LHC, limited to its 14 TeV stage and with standard and high luminosity options,
has the potentiality to probe such a model, albeit limited to the non-inert lowest lying
mass resonances up to a mass of 2-3 TeV, which are two in the neutral sector and one
in the charged sector, with the exception that in the diboson production modes, after
the applications of dedicated cuts, the extraction of the heaviest charged resonance can
also be possible. Furthermore, motivated by the enhanced couplings of these extra
states to the third generation of SM quarks, we have shown the potentiality of the
tt production mode in detecting the extra gauge bosons of such a model. We have
however proved that all these conclusions are strongly correlated to the condition of the
resonances being sufficiently narrow (Z,W /mZ,W 
<10 %) since, with the opening of
extra possible decay modes and the quick growth of their width, the extraction of the
signal over the SM background is no longer possible, no matter the final state. These,
together with the possible separation of the two lightest quasi degenerate Z s, again in
a regime where the width over mass ratio is below 10%, and the use of asymmetries,
other than cross section, distributions, both in the leptonic and in the top antitop final
state, are the main results for the analysis of the gauge sector of this particular CHM
framework, for which the extraction of the Z 2,3 and W
2, all degenerate in mass, would
represent the hallmark signature. Moreover the use of tt samples to define charge and
spin asymmetries, sensitive to the chirality of the couplings of the new states, and the
analysis of the line shapes of the resonances, that would reveal, or otherwise, the presence
of light additional fermions, will shed further light on the spectrum of this model.
Chapter 4
Phenomenology of the Higgs
sector of the 4DCHM
This Chapter is devoted to the analysis of the phenomenology of the Higgs sector of
the 4DCHM. After presenting the experimental status of the Higgs searches currently
ongoing at the LHC and describing in general the main properties of a composite Higgs
arising as a pNGB, we will analyse the characteristics of the 4DCHM Higgs state, show-
ing the compatibility of our framework with the Higgs data arising from the 7 and 8 TeV
runs of the LHC. We will then move onto the analysis of the capabilities of the forth-
coming 14 TeV run of the CERN machine and of a future proposed electron positron
collider in disentangling the nature of this scalar state in the context of our model.
4.1 The status of Higgs searches
After the discovery of a Higgs-like particle at the LHC, one of the primary questions is
now to identify whether this state corresponds to the Higgs boson predicted by the SM
or if it could belong to other BSM scenarios, and presently the efforts of the ATLAS and
CMS collaborations are mainly devoted to giving an answer to this question. While its
spin and parity properties seem quite clear and consistent with the 0+ hypothesis [76, 77],
the same is not true for its couplings to the SM gauge bosons and fermions, which are far
from being determined with a great accuracy. The way in which the experimentalists
usually present their results concerning these properties of the new scalar state is by
defining the so called signal strengths, which are the observed number of events for a
given Higgs decay channel and production process over the SM expectation

where with the subscript i we are indicating a Higgs boson specific production mode,
with X any particle produced in association with it and with Y Y a given final state
for its decay. The final states can be given by tree-level direct decays, such as h  bb,
tree-level decays mediated by one of shell gauge boson, such as hWW  and h ZZ
with the subsequent decay of the W and Z bosons yielding a four body final state, as
well as loop induced decay process, such as h  . At the LHC the main production
processes for the SM Higgs boson are through gluon-gluon-fusion, vector-boson-fusion
(VBF) and Higgs-strahlung while the contributions given by associated production with
heavy quarks (t and b) are sub-dominant, as shown in Fig. 4.1. Luckily a Higgs boson of
125 GeV has many decay modes with a significant branching ratios as shown in Fig. 4.2
(a) and this gives us the chance to test its properties at colliders in many different final
states, as shown in Fig. 4.2 (b) where the decay and the production rates of the Higgs
have been combined for the 8 TeV stage of the LHC.

Recently, possible hints of deviations from the SM expectations observed in the 
channel by the CMS collaboration have been downsized by their latest updates while they
are still present in the results provided by ATLAS. For other channels both agreement
and tensions with the SM are present as shown in Tab. 4.1 where we summarize the LHC
measurements of the  parameters by decay modes, provided by the ATLAS and CMS
collaborations before and after the Moriond winter conference 2013. Although more
data, that will be collected with the forthcoming high energy run of the CERN machine,
are necessary to understand the nature of this state, it is clear that the first two runs of
the LHC are pointing towards a scalar particle with properties in good agreement with
the ones predicted by the SM, making then important to test the compatibility of our
model with the available data.

4.2 The properties of the composite Higgs boson
In general a composite Higgs arising as a pNGB from a spontaneous breaking of a global
symmetry presents couplings to vector bosons and fermions that differ from the ones
predicted by the SM, due to the non linear realization of the Goldstone symmetry. In
the context of a low energy effective theory, expressed just in terms of the SM fields and
of the composite Higgs and neglecting all the resonances belonging to the strong sector,
we have shown in Chapter 2 that the Lagrangian describing the SO(5)/SO(4) breaking
that gives rise to our scalar state can be expressed by the non-linear sigma model of
eq.(2.6)
()
T () (4.2)
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCPhysics/CrossSections
Chapter 4. Phenomenology of the Higgs sector of the 4DCHM 62
where, by using the expressions of the SO(5) generators given in Appendix B, the vector
 can be explicitly written as
sinh/f
(hT , h coth/f), hT = (h1, h2, h3, h4), h =
haha, a = 1, 2, 3, 4,
(4.3)
with h being the Higgs bi-doublet expressed as a vector in the fundamental representa-
tion of SO(4). By means of this Lagrangian we now want to show the modifications of
the Higgs couplings to the W and Z boson with respect to the SM values. In order to
do this we need to gauge the SM gauge group SU(2)LU(1)Y  SO(4) by introducing
the corresponding covariant derivative and, since we are just interested in the gauge sec-
tor of the model, we can identify T Y = T 3R, neglecting the U(1)X gauge group present
in the 4DCHM which, as explained in Chapter 2, is relevant only to the fermionic sector.
We then make the substitution
  D =   igW iT iL  igYT 3R (4.4)
where with g and g we indicated the gauge couplings of SU(2)L and U(1)Y respectively.
Lets assume now that a potential for the Higgs fields exists and that it has the correct
Mexican hat shape so as to trigger EWSB by making the Higgs acquiring a VEV, as
happens in the 4DCHM, choosing for example
h = (0, 0, 0, h)T . (4.5)
Then, using eq.(4.2-4.5), we can calculate the part of Lagrangian quadratic in the W i
fields

Now, expanding the Higgs field onto his VEV, h  h + h and plugging this into
eq.(4.6), we obtain at the second order in the Higgs field h

given by the expression for the W mass
m2W =

Chapter 4. Phenomenology of the Higgs sector of the 4DCHM 63
so that
= sin2
. (4.10)
From eq.(4.7) we see that the couplings of the SM charged vector bosons to one and two
Higgs are modified, with respect to the SM, by a factor
gV V h = g
V V h
1  gV V hh = gSMV V hh(1 2) (4.11)
which is only dictated by the symmetry breaking pattern of the model. Conversely the
modification of the Higgs coupling to the SM fermions also depends on the choice of
the fermion embedding and it is possible to prove, see for example [86], that for the
4DCHM, that is embedding the fermions in fundamental representation of SO(5), the
modified coupling is
gffh = g
1 2
. (4.12)
As mentioned these modifications assume a complete decoupling of the extra resonances
belonging to the composite Higgs scenario while, in presence of a complete spectrum,
extra effects with respect to eq.(4.11) and eq.(4.12) can appear, due to the mixing
between the SM and extra particles caused by the partial compositness mechanism.
Moreover in the case of loop induced couplings such as hgg and h, relevant for the
analysis of the Higgs sector, the presence of extra particles running into the loops can in
principle bring another source of modification of the effective couplings, besides the one
given by the two effects already mentioned. All these effects have been taken into account
in our analysis both at the partial compositness level, as already done in Chapter 3,
and also at the level of extra particles running into the loops and, when necessary, a
comparison between the low energy approach and the complete approach will be shown.
4.3 Loop induced couplings
Since the tool chosen to perform our analysis, CalcHEP, is by default a tree-level MC
generator, in order to study the Higgs properties of the 4DCHM, it has been necessary
to implement in it those couplings that dont arise at the tree-level such as hgg and h.
To compute these effective couplings in the 4DCHM we need to consider both the tree-
level modifications of the couplings of the SM particles to the Higgs boson, which thanks
to our implementation are automatically taken into account, and also the contributions
of extra states intervening in these loop induced processes, which deserve a dedicated
treatment. Therefore we will now present the expressions for hgg and h within the
4DCHM, leaving however indicated in a general way the couplings of which they are
Chapter 4. Phenomenology of the Higgs sector of the 4DCHM 64
functions that have been, of course, expressed in function of the model parameters in
the CalcHEP implementation. The 4DCHM with the addition of the hgg and h
couplings has been uploaded onto the HEPMDB [25] web site under the name 4DCHM
(with HAA/HGG)1.
4.3.1 hgg coupling
The coupling of the Higgs boson to a gluon pair is induced by the Feynman diagram of
Fig. 4.3, where with q we indicate any possible quark that can run into the loop. The
structure of this coupling is well established in literature and the only modification that
has to be taken into account for computing this amplitude within the 4DCHM is to sum
over all the possible quarks that can intervene in the loop obtaining then

next to leading order QCD  factor [87], while for other production processes we have
neglected their k factors since their effect is expected to be smaller.

4.4 LHC analysis
We will present our results concerning the phenomenology of the 4DCHM Higgs in terms
of the ratio of events predicted in the 4DCHM hypothesis with respect to the SM one for
a given production process and in a given decay channel, by defining a signal strength
Chapter 4. Phenomenology of the Higgs sector of the 4DCHM 66
in the same way as done by the experimental collaborations
[(pp hX)iBr(h Y Y )]4DCHM
[(pp hX)iBr(h Y Y )]SM
(4.18)
This theoretical prediction will be compared with the ATLAS and CMS measurements
that are reported in Tab. 4.1 (b), that is with the publicly available data after the
Moriond 2013 winter conference2. For our analysis we will choose as unique production
modes for the Higgs boson, gluon-gluon-fusion for the , WW and ZZ final states and
Higgs-strahlung for the bb final state. This choice is motivated by the fact that in the
case of the decay of the Higgs in a pair of bottom quark the experimentalists, due to
the large QCD background of this final state, tag it in combination with an associated
production of a vector boson while for the other channels, cleaner than the former,
gluon-fusion can be safely considered as the main production channel.
For the purpose of our analysis it is convenient to re-write eq.(4.18) as follows
Y Y =
[(h Y Y )(h Y Y )]4DCHM
[(h Y Y )(h Y Y )]SM
[tot(h)]SM
[tot(h)]4DCHM
(4.19)
where Y Y  denote the particles participating in the Higgs boson production, that are
gg for gluon-fusion and V V =W+W, ZZ for VBF and Higgs-strahlung, while Y Y are
again the particles arising from the Higgs boson decay. In other words we trade a cross
section for a width and this is possible as we will be carrying out our analysis at the
lowest order without the presence of radiative corrections due to either QCD or EW
interactions, and this is possible since the latter are expected to be much smaller than
the former which are the same both in the 4DCHM and the SM. Moreover, following
[93], we can also cast eq.(4.19) as
Y Y =
2Y 
(4.20)
where
2Y/Y  =
(h Y Y/Y Y )4DCHM
(h Y Y/Y Y )SM
, 2H =
tot(h)4DCHM
tot(h)SM
(4.21)
so that we can disentangle in the signal strengths the effects arising from the production,
the partial width and the Higgs total width parts.
Before presenting our results for the analysis of the LHC phenomenology of the 4DCHM
it is however instructive to see what the predictions are for the signal strengths for the
final states of Tab. 4.1 in the low energy assumptions, that is when the only source
2We mention however that more update results have been delivered from both the ATLAS [88]
and CMS [8992] collaborations but that, on the other hand, these modifications will not change the
conclusions of our analysis and we will then continue to refer to the values of Tab. 4.1 (b).
Chapter 4. Phenomenology of the Higgs sector of the 4DCHM 67
of modification of the Higgs couplings is the one given by its pNGB properties. In
this case the s parameters of eq.(4.21) can be computed straightforwardly from the
expression for the Higgs-vector-vector and Higgs-fermion-fermion reduced couplings of
eq.(4.11) and eq.(4.12) assuming, for simplicity, that the total Higgs width, that is the
2H part, is made up only of the contribution of (h bb), (hW+W), (h ZZ),
(h  gg) which are, as shown in Fig. 4.2 (a), the main decay modes of a SM Higgs
with a mass 125 GeV. From the expressions of eq.(4.11) and eq.(4.12) we see that both
the gluon-gluon-fusion and the Higgs-strahlung production rates will be decreased with
respect to the SM predictions, that is 2Y Y  < 1, and the same will happen for the partial
widths of the Higgs in the various final state, 2Y Y < 1, causing the total Higgs width
to decrease. From a phenomenological point of view the reduction of the Higgs total
width is of particular interest. In fact even if a measure of the latter is challenging at an
hadron collider, we observe that we are in presence of contrasting effects intervening in
eq.(4.20) that can induce an increase of the various signal strengths, pointing towards
more stable values even though the production rates are generally decreased. We show
this in Fig. 4.5 where we plot the  parameters as defined in eq.(4.20) for three different
final states in function of the model scale f .

final states respectively. For WW/ZZ and  final states we have assumed unique
gluon-fusion production, while for bb final state unique Higgs-strahlung production.
We now move onto present our results for the 4DCHM including all the possible effects
due to its extra particle content, focusing in particular on the importance of the extra
fermionic resonances present in the spectrum. The role of the fermionic partners in
the LHC Higgs physics has been deeply investigated in literature in the context of
CHMs. For example the modification of the LHC phenomenology in presence of third
generation quark partners has been discussed in [94, 95] while in [96] the composite
Higgs phenomenology has been analysed in the case where the partial compositness
mechanism is also implemented for light quark generations. In order to show our results
Chapter 4. Phenomenology of the Higgs sector of the 4DCHM 68
for the analysis of the 4DCHM we adopt as a reference benchmark point the combination
of f=1000 GeV and g=2 for which we have scanned on the parameters of the fermionic
sector as explained in Section 2.2.4 with the constraints due to the EWPT and direct
search of extra gauge bosons and fermions illustrated in Section 3.2.1 and Section 3.4.1.
However when presenting our final results for the compatibility with the LHC data we
will do so for all the combinations of f and g of eq.(3.14).
We show the results for 2H in function of the mass of the lightest t
 and b in Fig. 4.6
where, for illustrative purposes, we also keep in these plots points that do not comply
with our reinterpretation of the limits on extra quarks for which, we recall, we have
obtained a bound for their masses around 500 GeV. Since the Higgs boson total width is
dominated by the bb partial width, in the limit when the extra fermions are decoupled,
and so the mixing effects between SM and extra quarks due to the partial compositness
mechanism are negligible, k2H tends towards the value of (gffh/g
2 = (
12
1 )
2  0.82
for f = 1000 GeV. However even in regions of the parameter space where the masses of
the extra fermions are consistent with our recast of the extra quark limits, deviations
from this asymptotic limit, due to the mixing of the b quark with extra fermions with
charge 1/3, are still possible and can be quantified in  5%.

Figure 4.6: Distributions of 2H as a function of the lightest t
 (a) and b (b).
This also happens for the s related to production and decay processes and we show
in Fig. 4.7 the result for 2g that gives the measure of the variation of the gluon-fusion
production rates with respect to the SM. Again, if the extra states belonging to the
4DCHM are decoupled, this parameter reaches its asymptotic value (
)2  0.82 while,
if smaller masses of the extra quarks are allowed, it will be brought towards higher values.
In this dynamics we recognise the effects of the ts and bs intervening in the loop such as
the lighter these states are the bigger their loop contribution will be, which will balance
and overcome the reduction of the htt coupling, as the top quark contribution is the

Regarding the h coupling we show in in Fig. 4.8 the results for 2 again in function
of the masses of the lightest t and b in the spectrum. Since the W boson is the
dominant contribution in this loop induced coupling, the value of this parameter points
in the asymptotic limit towards higher values for f= 1000 GeV and, since the top and
top partners loop contributions interfere destructively with the W contribution, it is
brought towards smaller values if smaller masses of these states are allowed.

The final results for the analysis of the Higgs sector of the 4DCHM for the four final
state chosen, bb, WW , ZZ and , and for the benchmark choices of eq.(3.14) are
shown in Fig. 4.10 where we plot them as a series of normalized histograms, in order to
demonstrate the relative number of points surviving the scan that take a given value of
the s; the ATLAS and CMS experimental results are represented by a black and white
dot respectively, together with their 1 error bars, and we exclude from the presentation
of these results the points where the masses of the extra fermions are below 500 GeV.
We observe the tendency of the various s to point towards the SM value of ii=1
with the model scale f increasing, as expected, together with the overall presence of a
smaller number of points for a higher model scale f which is essentially due to the higher
fine-tuning of the model which further constraints its parameters.
In order to have a clear and quantitative picture on how the 4DCHM fares against the
experimental data, and also in relation to the SM, we have calculated the 2 goodness
assuming that all the channels are independent and simply summing the corresponding
2s, obtaining then at the end eight degrees of freedom, as

where i and i are the measured values and errors reported in Tab. 4.1 (b). The values
of our 2 function for each of the parameter scan points are shown in Fig. 4.11 where
we plot, again as normalized histograms, the results for the 4DCHM and, as horizontal
black line, the SM 2 value (computed then with ii = 1), from which we observe that

for most of the points considered the fit of the 4DCHM to the 8 TeV LHC data is as
good as, if not better than, that of the SM thus making clear the compatibility of our
framework with the results arising from the CERN machine.
Before closing this Section we want to illustrate, although limited to just an example,
what the capabilities of the next stage of the LHC could be in disentangling the 4DCHM
from the SM by means of the measurements of the signal strengths, comparing our
predictions with the expected 14 TeV LHC experimental accuracies3 that can be found
in [97, 98], and that are given for an integrated luminosity of 300 fb1. We do this for two
different Higgs production processes, gluon-gluon-fusion and associated top production,
and for different final states associated to these production mechanisms, for which our
predicted values for the s parameters lie outside the LHC expected experimental errors
reported in Tab. 4.2. The results for two of the benchmark points of eq.(3.14), f=800
GeV and g=2.5 and f=1000 GeV and g=2 are shown in Fig.4.12 where we observe
that in certain regions of the parameter space the 4DCHM predictions lie outside of
the expected experimental accuracies, while the deviations of the Higgs signal strengths
3These accuracies, and the ones we will present in the next Section, are based on statistical er-
rors. Even though systematic errors can degrade these predictions, especially those claiming below 1%
accuracies, we will rely on these numbers for our analysis.

4.5 Future collider analysis
Even without the evidence of new physics at the next stage of the LHC the physics com-
munity needs to make an important and critical decision in the near future regarding the
next generations of colliders. In fact the precision measurements of the Higgs properties,
for which the LHC has limited capabilities due to its hadron collider nature, and the
understanding of its nature are essentials steps to shedding light on the mechanism of
EWSB. In this respect many types of colliders are at the moment in their design phase,
among which we count both hadron collider, workshops studying a 100 TeV proton pro-
ton collider have in fact recently started, and also e+e colliders, as CLIC [99], ILC [100]
and TLEP [101], the first two being linear colliders and the latter a circular one. For
many aspects it is clear that the advantage of an electron-positron collider with respect

to an hadron collider are multiple. The cleanliness of the environment, the precision of
the measurements and the large number of Higgs bosons that could be produced there-
fore make an analysis of the prospects of these types of machines in disentangling the
nature of the Higgs of primary importance nowadays and in this respect we will discuss
in this Section the potentiality of a proposed e+e collider in testing the 4DCHM as a
framework for the composite Higgs hypothesis. Recent literature has also studied the
Higgs state as a pNGB in the context of these future colliders (see for example [102]
where the authors focus on specific production processes showing the reach of a future
lepton collider onto the parameter  ) but once again our goal will be to analyse the
properties of a model in which the entire particle spectrum is taken into account also
comparing them with the asymptotic limit, as done for the LHC analysis.
As is known a feature specific to e+e colliders is the presence of initial state radi-
ation and Beamstrahlung and for our numerical computation with CalcHEP both of
these aspects have been taken into account. For the former CalcHEP implements the
Jadach, Skrzypek and Ward expressions of [103, 104] while for the latter we adopt the
parametrisation specific for the ILC project [100] that is
- Beam size (x+y) = 645.7 nm
- Bunch length = 300 m
- Bunch population = 21010
Chapter 4. Phenomenology of the Higgs sector of the 4DCHM 74
While fine details of the emerging electron and positron spectra may be different for
other colliders, we can confirm that the main features of our phenomenological analysis
are captured by our choice.
With the choice of the ILC prototype we will choose for our analysis three standard
values of its CM energy for which this machine could run, that are 250, 500 and 1000
GeV. The relevant Higgs production modes at the ILC can be seen from Fig. 4.13 where
the production cross sections for a 125 GeV Higgs boson in an e+e collider in function
s are shown. For
s= 250 GeV the machine will be at the peak of the reaction
e+e  Zh with the Higgs-strahlung production mode, Fig. 4.14 (left), dominating
the VBF production mode, Fig. 4.14 (right). This stage of the machine will allow a
precise measurement of the Higgs mass and quantum numbers, the former being made
particularly clean in the process e+e  Zh with Z  e+e/+ from which a
measurement of the invariant mass recoiling against the reconstructed Z can provide a
precise value ofmH . At the energy of
s=500 GeV two important processes will become
accessible, e+e  tth and e+e  Zhh, the former containing the top Yukawa coupling
and the latter the triple Higgs self-coupling at the tree-level. Finally, the energy stage
s=1000 GeV, for which the dominant Higgs production mode is VBF mediated
by off-shell charged gauge bosons, will allow a great number of measurements sensitive
to the Higgs boson coupling to the top quark and the Higgs boson self coupling, that
could be relevant as probes of a strongly interacting or composite Higgs, as well as being
an important CM energy for the search of new exotic particles. For these three energy
stages of the ILC we will choose in the following as an integrated luminosity the values of
250,500 and 1000 fb1 respectively, following the values reported in [98]. We will present
once again our results comparing our simulated data, presented in terms of Higgs boson
signal strengths as defined in eq.(4.1), with the experimental predicted accuracies that
are given in [97, 98, 105].
4.5.1 Results
As for the analysis of the Higgs sector of the 4DCHM at the LHC, we will first present
our results in the decoupling limit, that is assuming that all the extra particles in the
spectrum are heavy enough so that the only modifications to the Higgs couplings are
the ones given by eq.(4.11) and eq.(4.12), and for which we can again compute the Higgs
signal strengths just as a function of the model scale f . We present these results just
for the case of Higgs-strahlung production process at
s = 250, 500 GeV in Fig. 4.15 in
which we also show, with horizontal dashed lines, the expected experimental accuracies
for the channels under consideration, as reported in Tab. 4.3. We also present the ratio of
the inclusive cross section with respect to the SM prediction since this is a quantity that

at an electron-positron collider is measurable via the invariant mass recoiling against
the reconstructed Z boson. From the figures we observe that, limited to certain final
states, there exists a sensitivity to the compositness scale f up to  1200 GeV for the
Higgs-strahlung production processes.

As done for the LHC study we now move onto the analysis of our concrete CHM re-
alisation including all the other effects that can produce modifications to the physical
observables, such as extra modifications of the couplings and also extra particles that
can be exchanged in the processes of Fig. 4.14.

in this production processes and for which we have checked, by numerical computation,
that if the new classes of gauge bosons are completely stripped off the calculation, then
R  2hZZ that is   0. However, when we include the Z s in our computation, also
s smaller than the new physics scale f , where the new gauge boson spectrum lives,
the Higgs-strahlung cross section is always affected by propagator effects (see also [106]
and [107, 108] for related studies in the littlest Higgs and CHM respectively). This is
well illustrated in Fig. 4.16 where we plot R and /R in function of the width of Z 3 for
two of the benchmark points of eq.(3.14) for which we have scanned over the parameters
of the fermionic sector as described in Chapter 2 and for which the rescaling factors are
respectively R  0.91 for f=800 GeV and R=0.94 for f=1000 GeV. The slopes present
in the plots make it clear that we are in presence of width dependent propagator effects
and the deviations from the SM limit span from  2% for
s=250 GeV up to 25% for
s=1000 GeV. It is interesting to notice that, contrary to the case where the extra gauge
bosons are completely decoupled and so that, following eq.(4.11), it is always R <1, in
Chapter 4. Phenomenology of the Higgs sector of the 4DCHM 77
case of the inclusion of the extra gauge boson the total result can be an enhancement of
the SM cross section already for
s=500 GeV, that is well below the mass of the extra
gauge bosons. We have also analysed the case of VBF were we have established that
such an interference effect is taking place but with a contribution which is one order of
magnitude lower than in the Higgs-strahlung case.

After having determined, once again, the importance of keeping the finite spectrum
effects in our computation we now present our results in terms of the  parameters
relating them to the expected ILC experimental accuracies of Tab. 4.3. We do this for
Chapter 4. Phenomenology of the Higgs sector of the 4DCHM 78
the choice f = 800 GeV, g = 2.5 and f = 1000 GeV, g = 2 both for both the Higgs-
strahlung and VBF production processes in Fig. 4.17 and Fig. 4.18. From the results it
is clear that, for both production processes, deviations from the case in which the full
particle spectrum is not taken into account, represented in the plots by the circles, could
modify the signal strengths for various channels is such a way that the modifications
could be, depending on the Higgs boson decay mode, fully disentangleable, for some
aspects more in the case of Higgs-strahlung than in the case of VBF due to the different
topologies of Feynman diagrams. Altogether, though, it is clear the potentiality of future
leptonic machines to pin down the possible composite nature of the 125 GeV scalar boson
already at the lowest CM energy here considered.
As mentioned, at the running energy stages of 500 and 1000 GeV another important
process to be analysed at a future electron positron collider is e+e  ttH for which
the relevant Feynman diagram is reported in Fig. 4.204. Other than the effects already
seen in the previously analysed production modes, due to the exchange of s channel
extra gauge bosons, in this channel effects due to the exchange of ts can also occur
that could affect this production process significantly if these particles are light enough
and produced resonantly. In order to illustrate the results for this process we have now
restricted the allowed mass of the extra fermions to be heavier than 600 GeV which,
once again, does not intend to be an accurate and precise exclusion, for which we refer
to the next Chapter, but an indication of what realistic mass bounds on these states
could be, which is an approach indeed sufficient for the purpose of our analysis. Again
following the guidance of [97, 98] we quote in Tab. 4.4 the expected accuracies on the
 parameters for the 500 and 1000 GeV stage of the ILC considering however only the
bb Higgs decay mode, that is the only decay mode for which the analysis of [98] gives
the expected errors. For the same two benchmarks previously analysed we present our
results in Fig. 4.20 where on the left we present the results with the inclusion of the
extra ts and on the right without. From the comparison of the two panels it is clear
that the enhancement of the bb parameter up to a factor two or so for
s=1000 GeV
is due to the exchange of extra ts with a mass smaller than
smtop that can indeed
be resonant in the production of the Higgs top pair final state. Conversely at
s=500
GeV the deviations are due to non-resonant Z s and ts effects as, at this CM energy, no
t mass can be larger than mtop +mH and smaller than
smtop due to our choice of
restricting mts > 600 GeV. Altogether we observe then that, also in this channel, and
limited to the bb Higgs decay mode, the potential of a future e+e machine in assessing
the 4DCHM comprehensive of its finite mass spectrum is significant.
We conclude this Chapter by presenting results regarding a production process relevant
s = 500 and 1000 GeV, that allows a precision measurement that is challenging at
4Note that at the energies considered the contribution from the Higgs off Z diagram is negligible [98].

in determining the  parameters for Higgs-strahlung at 500 GeV and VBF at 1000
GeV production processes [97, 98] are reported in Tab. 4.5, where again we assume
the decays of both the Higgs bosons just into a bb final state. We then present our
results in Fig. 4.23 where we observe that sizeable deviations with respect to the SM,
as well as to the decoupling limit, predictions are possible. However due to the poor
predicted accuracies for the corresponding measurements, the expected errors ought to
be reduced by at least factor of two or so, in order to disentangle the 4DCHM from SM
effects, and this is in line with the pursuit of the so called ILC(LumUP) high luminosity
scenario considered in [105], in the hope of decreasing the predicted uncertainties on
the measurements of such an observable down to a level comparable to their expected
departures from the SM value.

4.6 Conclusions
In this Chapter we have analysed the properties of the Higgs sector of the 4DCHM with
respect firstly to the current available LHC data and then to proposed e+e colliders.
We have shown that the 4DCHM compatibility with the 7 and 8 TeV Higgs data of
the LHC is as good as the SM in pointing to a discovery of a neutral Higgs boson with
a mass  125 GeV. In computing the various signal strengths  we have analysed all
the effects intervening in it and shown that, for values of the extra fermions around 500
GeV, enhancements in these values are possible, albeit moderate. We have compared our
results obtained with the complete particle spectrum of the model with those obtained
in the asymptotic limit showing that possible observable deviations between the two
approaches can arise, for both the 7,8 and 14 TeV LHC. We have then tested our model
against future proposed electron-positron colliders, borrowing the specific configurations
of the ILC, and showing the potentiality of this machine in disentangling the nature of the

process, albeit limited to final states with a predicted error <10%, while, under the
same assumptions on the errors upper bound, VBF and top associated production can
be used at a probe for
s = 500 and 1000 GeV.
Chapter 5
Heavy extra quarks in BSM
scenarios
This Chapter is devoted to the analysis of the phenomenology of extra heavy quarks
that are present in many extensions of the SM, as in the case of CHMs, although here,
differently from the rest of the Thesis, we will not directly study the case of the 4DCHM.
We will illustrate a framework and discuss a dedicated tool called XQCAT (extra quark
combined analysis tool) [109] based on publicly available experimental data which allows
us to determine the exclusion confidence level (eCL) of a given scenario involving multiple
heavy extra quarks with respect to the available direct searches for top partners. After
describing the motivations for this study, we will explain our analysis strategy and apply
our tool to some specific scenarios, including a recently proposed simplified CHM, indeed
reproducible in the 4DCHM case, in order to show its potentiality. Finally we will show
that since the dedicated experimental searches for top partners are not sensitive yet to
the case of decay of these states into light quarks, the re-interpretation of SUSY searches
could be important so as to set bounds in these scenarios as well.
5.1 Introduction and motivations
During our analysis we have so far set bounds on the masses of the extra quarks present
in the 4DCHM by rescaling the pair production cross sections of the lightest extra quarks
to take into account the non-100% branching ratios of these states into the channels for
which the experimentalists are searching for and we have then derived a bound on their
masses around 500-600 GeV. The motivations for this approach have been both the fact
that for the purpose of our analysis the approximation that we adopted was sufficient
in order to illustrate the relevant phenomenology of the gauge and Higgs sectors of the
Chapter 5. Heavy extra quarks in BSM scenarios 86
4DCHM, and the fact that in presence of a large quark spectrum a detailed analysis
of it has to take into account other aspects besides the simple rescaling of the rates
of the lightest quarks. The presence of a wider spectrum can in fact increase the final
signal rate into a given search channel due to the possibility that two quarks can either
have the same decay channels or different decay channels which however feed, even
partially, the same final state. This, together with the necessity to take into account the
different branching ratios of the extra quarks with respect to the one assumed by the
experimental collaborations, makes a re-interpretation of the experimental mass bounds
not trivial. However this re-interpretation is of primary importance nowadays since top
partners are expected to play an important role in many extensions of the SM that offer
alternative explanations to the mechanisms of EWSB and might have a crucial role in
softening the quadratic divergences contributing to the Higgs mass term, which is the
origin of the hierarchy problem discussed in Chapter 1. New heavy quarks can appear
for example in models with extra dimensions [110112], little Higgs models [113, 114],
models with gauging of the flavour group [115118], non minimal SUSY extensions of
the SM [119124], grand unified theories [125, 126] as well as composite Higgs models
[5, 31, 127132] and it is therefore important to be able to set bounds on the masses of
these states in order to constrain or exclude portions of the parameters space of these
scenarios, and up to now extra quarks coupled to third generation quarks have been
thoroughly investigated from a phenomenological point of view [133138], together with
the possibility of having sizeable couplings to light generations [139, 140].
In principle, for cut based analyses, a MC simulation and a simplified detector emulation
can allow the conversion of the results of the existing experimental searches and allow
for the re-interpretation of the mass bounds for any given model. However this is a
very time-consuming task since for each model point, corresponding to different mass
spectra and decay modes, the simulation has to be re-done. Nevertheless we will show
that it is possible, given the parameter space describing the extra quark spectrum and
the experimental results from their searches, to find allowed and excluded regions in
the parameter space of a model without performing any dedicated simulation and in
this respect some studies have attempted to tackle this problem proposing tools such
as CheckMATE [141], SModelS [142] or Fastlim [143] where the former adopts a rather
model independent approach while the others are mostly dedicated to SUSY scenarios.
Clearly in order to achieve the task of reinterpreting the LHC data a pre-loaded database
of MC data and experimental searches has to be created and these two aspects, which
are the most time-consuming ones, can be overcome by the use of the tool that we
propose, called XQCAT1 which requires as input masses, charges and branching ratios of

the extra quarks of a given model and gives as output the corresponding eCL calculated
by reinterpreting the searches implemented into the program database.
To achieve a certain degree of model independence we restricted ourselves to considering
only pair production processes induced by QCD interactions, so that the production rates
of these new states are sensitive only to their mass, although a similar procedure could
in principle also be applied in the case of single production, as shown in [144]. Moreover
we considered that none of the new particles can decay into each other or other non-SM
particles, such as Z s, W s, extra scalars and DM candidates. Under these assumptions
we will show that the cross sections for various final states can be decomposed in model
independent subsets containing all the kinematic information from the decays and that
it is then possible to reconstruct the signal coming from a general scenario by combining
with appropriate weights the different topologies which generate the signal thanks to
the fact that the efficiencies of the various signal channels, each of which in principle
has a different kinematic, are included into the database of XQCAT so that no further
simulation is needed.
5.2 Analysis strategy
5.2.1 General approach
Given the assumption that the extra quarks can only decay into SM quarks and bosons
and considering just dimension-four interactions, the electric charges for the extra quarks
which are of interest to us are restricted to be 5/3, 2/3,1/3,4/3, which for example
arise naturally in the context of CHMs as vector like quarks belonging to singlet, doublet
or triplet representation of SU(2)L, see [145] for a review. These states, that we have
called X, t, b and Y for the case of the 4DCHM, can therefore have just the following
decays channels
Xi W+ui,
ti W+di, Zui, Hui,
bi Wui, Zdi, Hdi,
Yi Wdi,
(5.1)
where with i = 1, 2, 3 we label the SM families not restricting ourselves to decays just
within the third generation of quarks.
We now want to show that knowing the number of signal events surviving the selection
cuts for any given possible decay channel combination of the extra quarks with a certain
Chapter 5. Heavy extra quarks in BSM scenarios 88
mass mQ and for any given experimental search (that is, knowing the efficiency of the
corresponding search for each of the subprocesses that can contribute to the final state)
it is possible to express the overall signal as a weighted sum of signals arising from each
of the subprocesses, where the weights are given by a product of the branching ratios
combination and efficiencies for any given final state. To be more clear lets illustrate this
with an example in the case of just two extra quarks, X and b, for which the correspond-
ing QCD pair production cross sections are (mX) and (mb) and their decay rates are
given by BR(X  W+t), BR(b  Wu) and BR(b  Wt), that is, we assume here
that the b can decay just via charged current, but also into light generation quarks.
Knowing the efficiencies for a given bin of a search for each production and sub se-
quent decay process2, that are (mX ,W
+tWt), (mb ,W
uW+u), (mb ,W
uW+t),
(mb ,W
tW+u), (mb ,W
tW+t), it is possible to compute the final signal rate for a
given integrated luminosity L as
#events = L  [(mX)BR(X W+t)2(mX ,W+tWt)+
+ (mb)BR(b
 Wu)BR(b W+t)(mb ,WuW+t) + ...]
(5.2)
and, again, if the efficiencies, together with the QCD production cross sections, are
stored in a database no simulations are needed in order to compute the final number
of events. From this event rate it is then possible, knowing the background and the
observed number of events provided by the experimental collaborations in their analysis,
to calculate the eCL of the chosen scenario using the CL method
eCL = 1
CL(s+ b)
CL(b)
1 p-value(s+ b)
1 p-value(b)
(5.3)
that can be extended straightforwardly to the case of multiple bins by introducing the
products of p-values.
For our purpose we have then simulated signals for different values of the masses of the
extra quarks and for each possible decay combinations, distinguishing between quarks
and antiquarks, and have then used a C++ based analysis code to apply the selection
cuts of the experimental searches in order to find the respective efficiencies for each
subprocess contributing to each individual signature. These efficiencies have been stored
into the database of XQCAT that, for a given input, allows to automatically evaluate
the corresponding final signal rate, eq.(5.2), and eCLs, eq.(5.3), for each individual
implemented search and, when possible, combination of searches.
2As an example here we are considering the W as the final state of the processes, which of course
has been decayed in performing our analysis.
Chapter 5. Heavy extra quarks in BSM scenarios 89
5.2.2 Generation of the efficiency database
The number of processes that have been simulated in order to obtain a complete efficiency
database is related to the number of considered masses, decay channels and chirality of
the couplings3. Assuming that these states can decay in all three of the quark generations
and neglecting the possibility of a charm tagging (so that 1th and 2nd generations are
indistinguishable from an experimental point of view), both the ts and the bs can have
6 possible decay modes, 4 via neutral current and 2 via charged current, while they
are just 2 in the case of the X and Y species, since they can only decay into the W
boson and a SM quark. Considering that we are assuming QCD pair production and
simulating both the case of left and right chiral couplings, the total number of channels
for each mass is equal to 2  2  (6  6 + 2  2) = 160 and we have performed our
simulations in the mass range of 400  2000 GeV at steps of 100 GeV for a total of
2720 simulated processes for each LHC centre of mass energy. The simulations have
been done with MadGraph5, v.1.5.8 [146], with the decays of the extra quarks into SM
quarks and gauge bosons performed by means of BRIDGE, v.2.24 [147]. For the decay of
SM quarks and bosons and subsequent hadronisation and parton showering we have used
PYTHIA, v.6.4 [148], and the detector simulation has been performed with Delphes2,
v.2.0.2 [149]. Finally, since the pair production is a QCD process, jet matching up to
two jets has been considered in simulating the processes in MadGraph5. Limiting our
study just to CMS searches we have implemented in our program two different kinds of
experimental analyses.
 Direct search of extra quarks: we have implemented the CMS analysis B2G-12-015
[150], at
s = 8 TeV with a 19.5 fb1 dataset, for pair produced t quarks that
mix only with third generation SM quarks and can therefore decay to W+b, Zt or
Ht with variable branching ratios. The CMS collaboration presents the 95% eCL
lower limits on the t quark mass for different combinations of its branching ratios,
see Fig.1.6, using six mutually exclusive channels: two single lepton (single electron
and single muon), three di-lepton (two opposite sign and one same sign, the former
requiring different number of jets) and one tri-lepton. Since the sensitivity of the
search is mostly driven by the multi-lepton channels, in the present version of the
tool we have only implemented three bins: one opposite sign (called OS1 in the
CMS paper), the same sign (SS) and the tri-lepton channels. More details about
this choice will be given in the next Section where we will describe the validation
of our framework. The limits for the multi lepton channels only, can be found in
3The tool assumes in fact a dominant chirality for the extra quarks couplings, which is a correct
assumptions in case that these states are vector like [136], as in the case of CHMs.
Chapter 5. Heavy extra quarks in BSM scenarios 90
the twiki page of the search [151] and the quoted observed bounds are in the range
592 794 GeV depending on the assumed branching ratios.
 SUSY searches we have implemented four searches inspired by SUSY scenarios,
characterised by the presence of different numbers of leptons in the final state
and large missing transverse energy: 0 lepton (called T in the CMS paper) [152],
mono-lepton (Lp) [153], opposite sign di-lepton (OS) [154] and same sign di-lepton
(SS) [155], considering the entire 4.98 fb1 2011 dataset at
s = 7 TeV. We have
also included the updated T [156] and SS [157] searches at 8 TeV, with 11.7 fb
and 10.5 fb1, respectively. It has been verified that the selected searches are
uncorrelated and, therefore, it is possible to statistically combine them without
the need of a correlation matrix, yielding 95% CL bounds at 7 TeV (combination
of 4 searches), 8 TeV (combination of 2 searches) and 7+8 TeV (combination of 6
searches).
Before giving details on how our framework has been validated we need to mention
that there are several effects, that the code currently doesnt take into account, which
might affect the calculation of the final signal rates, and therefore of the eCLs, such as
possible chain decays between the extra quarks, decays into states beside the SM ones,
interference effects in the pair production of two extra quarks and loop corrections to
masses and mixing between the extra states. These issues can in principle reduce the
final number of predicted signal events therefore providing, if not taken into account, a
non-conservative bound on a given scenario. It is however also important to consider
all the possible effects that might enhance the signal rate, since an over-conservative
estimate would result in too weak a bound; a detailed discussion of these effects is given
in [109] and future upgrades of the code will also take into account these aspects of the
phenomenology of extra quarks.
5.3 Validation of the framework
While for the SUSY inspired searches the framework for computing the efficiencies has
been validated and used in previous works [158, 159], for the case of the direct search
for top partners we need to validate it against the experimental results provided by the
CMS collaboration. The validation part also includes the test of the limit code with
which we compute the eCLs from the final signal rates.

(observed) lower mass bounds in [150] are 773 GeV (696 GeV) considering all channels,
and 683 GeV (668 GeV) considering only the multi-lepton channels (as reported in the
corresponding twiki page [151], and to be compared to the limit code results in the
table).
5.3.1 Validation of the computation of the eCLs
This validation has the scope to test any discrepancy between the statistical method used
in our approach and the one used in the experimental analysis, and has been done by
comparing the expected and observed limits computed using the signal, background and
data information provided in the experimental search documentation [150], for which
we show the results in Tab.5.1 where the signal rates have been computed for a t with
branching ratios of 50%, 25% and 25% in W+b, Zt and Ht final states respectively.
First of all, from the column where the eCLs have been computed using all the channels
of the search, we observe that we are not able to reproduce the mass bounds considering
the single lepton channels in combination with the multi-lepton ones, and this is due
to a different analysis technique used by the experimental collaboration. Considering
however only the multi-lepton channels we obtain a mass bounds of 626 and 630 GeV for
the expected and observed bounds, obtained by linearly interpolating the eCLs between
the simulated mass points that are reported in the table. We are therefore able, with
our statistical technique, to reproduce in this case the experimental values of 683 and
668 GeV with a discrepancy of 8% and 6% and for this reason we will only consider
the multi-lepton channels in the rest of our discussion.
5.3.2 Validation of the efficiency extraction code
The extraction of the efficiencies depends on the interplay of different factors among
which the most important ones are the accuracy of the MC simulation, the correct
reproduction of the detector effects and the correct implementation of the experimental
selection cuts. Considering only the multi-lepton channels and again for the same choice
Chapter 5. Heavy extra quarks in BSM scenarios 92
of branching ratios of the t as before, the number of events for a given mass of the
quark and the difference between the ones reported by the CMS analysis in Tab. 5.1 are
reported in Tab. 5.2. We observe that our results present an offset between 20% and
30% in all the channels except the second opposite sign di-lepton, OS2, where we find
a larger deviation which is around 50%. This discrepancy can however be explained by
the unavoidable differences in the reproduction of the detector effects and selection cuts
and for this reason we have decided to omit the OS2 channel from our implementation
of this experimental analysis, leaving us with just three channels, the first opposite sign
di-lepton, OS1, the same sign di-lepton, SS, and the tri-lepton, 3l.

a t with BR(Wb) = 50% and BR(Zt) = BR(Ht) = 25%. In parenthesis, the relative
discrepancy with the number of events quoted in [150] and also reported in Tab. 5.1.
5.3.3 Comparison with the experimental results
After having validated both the expression for the calculation of the eCLs and the
extraction of the experimental efficiencies, we now need to compare our final results,
obtained using the NLO QCD pair production cross section supplemented by the next-
to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) resummation [68], with those presented by the
CMS collaboration for different choices of the t branching ratios into SM bosons and
third generation quarks.
Firstly we show in Fig. 5.1 the eCL for a t, in function of its mass, again for the
nominal point with BR(Zt) = BR(Ht) = 0.25 and BR(Wb) = 0.5, for which, linearly
interpolating the eCLs between the simulated points represented by the dots, we obtain
a 2 mass bound of 614 GeV to be compared with the 668 GeV limit for the multi-lepton
channel only that is quoted in [151]. The colour code for the strips below the plot is
the following: in red and green are the regions where both the configurations with the
extreme masses are excluded or allowed at 95% CL respectively, while in yellow are the
regions where one configuration is allowed, the one with higher mass, and one excluded,
the one with lower mass, allowing us to claim that the 2 bound can be found in the
yellow range. The motivation for the explicit presentation of the colour code below
the plot is due to the fact that the most accurate results are those obtained for the
simulated masses, which we remember are from 400 to 2000 GeV in steps of 100 GeV,
Chapter 5. Heavy extra quarks in BSM scenarios 93
while for intermediate masses we dont have direct information about the experimental
efficiencies. Besides linearly interpolating the eCLs between the simulated mass points
another possibility exists in order to provide an eCL for a given scenario, which is to
linearly interpolate the efficiencies and cross sections between the simulated masses. A
detailed discussion of two methods, with the respective pros and cons, is reported in
Appendix A of [109], to which we refer for further details. In the plot we also show,
with the dashed red line, the eCL obtained from the combination of the 7 and 8 TeV
SUSY searches for which, again interpolating the eCLs between the simulated points,
we can claim a 2 exclusion at a mass of 525 GeV. We clearly see then that the direct
search is, of course, more sensitive to this particular scenario but that the the mass
bound obtained from the SUSY searches combination is not too far from it, which is
remarkable since these analyses are not designed to be sensitive to this kind of final
state and this could be important, as we will show, in scenarios were the extra quarks
can also decay in light generations for which direct searches, that usually requires b-jets
into the final state, might not be sensitive. However we have to point out that progress
on this front is currently underway in the experimental community in both designing
searches and interpreting results in the context of models where the extra quarks can
have couplings also to the light generations of SM quarks.

the plot the red region is excluded at 95% CL, the yellow region is where the 2 eCL
can be found, the green region is not excluded at 95% CL.
We now allow two of the t branching ratios to vary between 0 and 1 and we calculate the
corresponding eCLs for which we show in Fig. 5.2 (a) the 95% CL mass limit contours in
the BR(t Wb) BR(t  Ht) plane, again obtained by linearly interpolating the eCLs
computed for the simulated mass points, together with the results provided by the CMS
collaboration, Fig. 5.2 (b). From the plots we can observe the remarkable similarity of

the contour lines of our results with respect to the experimental ones in almost all the
regions of branching ratios and, from Fig. 5.2 (c), that the mass bounds obtained from
our analysis are consistent with the CMS ones within 60 GeV for most of the branching
ratio configurations.

5.4 Results
5.4.1 Direct searches of top partners
Having validated our framework and compared our results with the experimental ones
in the case of a single extra quark, we now want to apply our tool to analyse scenarios
Chapter 5. Heavy extra quarks in BSM scenarios 95
where more than one extra state is present in the spectrum. In this case a given bin of a
search can receive contributions from different physical states in the following two cases
- the model contains states with the same decay channels which therefore produce
the same final state
- the model contains states with different decay channels, however, the selection cuts
are (even partially) sensitive to the different final states
that are automatically taken into account by XQCAT by using eq.(5.2) generalised to an
arbitrary number of extra quarks.
As a first step we apply our tool to two simplified scenarios, one containing two ts, both
with the same branching ratios used in the previous subsection, and one containing one
t, again with the same decay rates as before, and a X quark that decays 100% intoW+t.
These configurations can arise, for example, in the case of the introduction of two singlet
representations of SU(2)L with hypercharge 2/3 or a doublet with hypercharge 7/6, in
which the extra quarks are embedded (see again [145] for a review) and the numerical
implementation of these two scenarios can be found in [160, 161] and [25, 162]. In both
cases we have calculated the eCLs given by the direct search for top partners by varying
independently the extra quark masses {mt
} and {mt ,mX} although the second case
might not correspond to a physically realistic situation since the mass splitting between
these two quarks that usually appear in the SU(2)L doublet can be only generated
via mixing with the Higgs boson, therefore giving rise to a small mass difference. For
the first case the results are shown in Fig. 5.3 (a) where the crossing points in the grid
correspond to the masses that we have simulated. Shown in the plot are the red squares,
whose corners are all excluded at the 95% confidence level and the green ones, whose
corners are all allowed, while in yellow are the squares that present some corners allowed
and some excluded so that, in the same spirit of the discussion in the case of just one t,
we can then affirm that the exclusion limit should be a line crossing the yellow squares.
This is shown in the plot by the black solid line, which is obtained by interpolating the
eCLs between simulated mass points, as is usually done in the experimental analysis,
using the inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation [163] described in Appendix A
of [109], since we are dealing with a 2-dimensional function, while with the black dashed
line we illustrate the results obtained interpolating efficiencies and cross sections. The
plot displays interesting physical results: we observe in fact that when the mass gap
between the two quarks is less than, say, 200 GeV, the obtained bound is more stringent
than in the case of just one extra quark in the spectrum, up to the point that the eCL
can be found in the 700-800 GeV mass range in this quasi degenerate case. In contrast,
in the case where one of the two ts is assumed to be way heavier than the other, the
Chapter 5. Heavy extra quarks in BSM scenarios 96
mass bound coincides with the one previously obtained for the case of the single extra
We then study the case where a quark with a different charge with respect to the one for
which the search is designed is present in the spectrum. The exotic quark with charge
5/3 has been searched for at the LHC from both ATLAS and CMS in the SS di-lepton
channel, which gives a bound of 670 [164] and 800 [165] GeV respectively, assuming
100% of decay into W+t. The plot in Fig. 5.3 (b) again shows the interplay between
the two quarks in giving rise to a higher bound where the mass splitting is relatively
small and also the interesting result that the CMS analysis dedicated to the search of a
t state is actually sensitive to the X state and able to set bounds on its mass.

yellow, regions at 95% CL are shown. The solid black line corresponds to the 95% CL
obtained from a liner interpolation of the eCLs between the simulated points, while the
dashed black line to the one obtained by linearly interpolating efficiencies and cross
sections.
We now move on to apply our tool to a physical motivated scenario and show the bound
on its parameters space given by our code. The framework that we consider is a model for
a pNGB boson Higgs based on the SO(5)/SO(4) breaking pattern recently presented
in [133]. In this work the authors assume that the top partners belong to an SO(4)
bidoublet and singlet; since the former is typically expected to be lighter than the latter
we will study the case of the bidoublet for illustrating our results. This fourplet can be
decomposed in the SU(2)L  U(1)Y doublets {T ,B} and {X5/3,X2/3 }, where we are
using, for consistency, the notation chosen by the authors of [133], labelling then with T
and B the 2/3 and 1/3 charged quarks belonging to the SU(2)L doublet with SM like
hypercharge, 1/6, and with X5/3 and X2/3 the 5/3 and 2/3 charged quarks belonging to
Chapter 5. Heavy extra quarks in BSM scenarios 97
the SU(2)L doublet with exotic hypercharge, 7/6. These states are assumed to decay
exclusively into third generation SM quarks with the following branching ratios
BR(X5/3 W+t) = BR(B Wt) = 100%,
BR(X2/3  Zt) = BR(X2/3  Ht) = 50%,
BR(T  Zt) = BR(T  Ht) = 50%.
(5.4)
For our study we assume a common mass for the states belonging to the two doublets
which is indeed a natural approximation, as previously explained, since the mass splitting
between the two quarks can only be generated by the Higgs VEV and is therefore
relatively small with respect to the mass scales of the extra quarks, while the mass
difference between the two doublets is generally large, as argued by the authors of [133].
However for our purpose we have decided to independently vary the mass parameters
of the two doublets in the 4002000 GeV range and we show our results in Fig. 5.4.
From the plot we observe that for this scenario with four extra quarks in the spectrum
the bounds are more stringent as in the previous examples. Moreover, in the region of
small splitting between the two doublets the bound can reach the 900-1000 GeV mass
range while it can be found between 700 and 800 GeV when one of the two doublets is
much heavier than the other.

5.4.2 Complementarity with other searches
As already noticed in Fig. 5.1, the mass bound that can be obtained from the re-
interpretation and combination of the SUSY analysis implemented in our tool is not too
far from the one obtained from the dedicated experimental analysis and in this subsection
we will show that SUSY inspired searches are able to set bounds on scenarios where the
extra quarks can also decay into the light quark generations. From a phenomenological
point of view this case has recently received a great deal of attention due to the fact
that it can potentially give rise to large single production cross sections [139] and that it
has been shown that flavour bounds might not disfavour cases where significant mixing
with both the top and the up or charm quark are turned on [140]. Nevertheless at the
time being no specific searches focused on QCD pair production followed by decays to
light jets are available and we will show the potentiality of SUSY inspired searches in
constraining these scenarios.
We start by showing this again for the case of just a t quark mixing exclusively with the
first generation of quarks, BR(Zu) = BR(Hu) = 0.25, BR(Wd) = 0.5, and equally with
the first and third generation of quarks, BR(Zu) = BR(Zt) = BR(Hu) = BR(Ht) =
0.125 and BR(Wd) = BR(Wb) = 0.25, in Fig. 5.5 (a) and (b) respectively. Following the
same method of interpolating the eCLs between the simulated points we observe that
the sensitivity of the direct search is strongly reduced when the mixing with the light
generations is turned on, which is not a surprise since the lack of the top quark arising
from the decay of the ts causes a reduction of b-jets and leptons to which the search is
sensitive. It is remarkable however that the combinations of the SUSY searches can set
a bound on the mass of the extra quark between 400 and 500 GeV in case of exclusive
mixing with light quarks, and that this bound is stronger that the one obtained by the
re-interpretation of the direct search for which no bound above 400 GeV is found.
Finally we apply our tool for the same physical motivated scenario based on the pNGB
Higgs analysed before with the difference that the extra quarks are now assumed to
couple just to the light quark generations, that is, assuming the following branching
ratios for the states belonging to the SO(4) bi-doublet
BR(X5/3 W+u) = BR(B Wu) = 100%,
BR(X2/3  Zu) = BR(X2/3  Hu) = 50%,
BR(T  Zu) = BR(T  Hu) = 50%.
(5.5)
The re-interpretation of the direct search for the extra t quarks doesnt allow us to set
any bound above 400 GeV and so we only show in Fig. 5.6 the limits arising from the
combinations of the SUSY searches, from which we observe that in this scenario too it

5.5 Conclusions
In this last Chapter we have proposed and illustrated a framework for the re-interpretation
of any given experimental search so as to set bounds on extra quarks that are assumed
to be pair produced via QCD interactions. Our analysis, based on a simple cut and
count approach, is done by means of a code called XQCAT that will soon be publicly
available. After having validated our framework we have shown how limits on scenarios
with more than one extra quark in the spectrum can be set, using as examples both
simplified and physically motivated models, without the need of any further simulation
since all the physical information of the relevant experimental searches is encoded in the
code database. Moreover, in the case where the extra quarks can also mix with the light
quark generations, as for example can be the case in CHMs where the partial composit-
ness mechanism is implemented for all three generations of quarks, we have shown how
reinterpreting SUSY inspired searches also allows to set bounds on these scenarios for
which, at the moment, no dedicated searches are available.
Even though our code has not yet been directly applied to the case of the 4DCHM,
some comments on our analysis ought to be made. We have shown that the presence
of a higher number of extra quarks in the model can cause an increase on their mass
bounds. For the study of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM this effect has little impact,
since our analyses have been performed in the small width regime for which the extra
quarks are heavy enough so as to escape more stringent bounds. Also for the case of the
Higgs sector we expect the more stringent bounds not to have a dramatic impact. In
fact the compatibility of the 4DCHM with the 7 and 8 TeV LHC data will not be spoiled
by further constraining the parameter space of the model, and the modifications of the
signal strengths in the case of the e+e study will remain accessible with respect to the
expected experimental accuracies, albeit some moderate decrease could happen in the
case of the tt Higgs associated production where the extra fermions play an important
role in the signal enhancement.

Conclusions
This Thesis has been devoted to the analysis of the phenomenology of a model with a
composite Higgs arising as a pNGB bosons, which is a compelling alternative to SUSY
in order to solve the hierarchy problem present in the SM and restore the naturalness of
the EW scale. The composite Higgs scenario that we have chosen for our investigation
is the recently proposed 4DCHM which realises the Higgs state as a pNGB by means of
the most economical symmetry breaking pattern also containing a custodial symmetry:
SO(5)/SO(4).
In Chapter 2 we have explained the general idea of the (composite) Higgs boson as a
pNGB and described the particle spectrum of the 4DCHM which, besides just one phys-
ical scalar, presents eight extra gauge bosons, five neutral and three charged, and twenty
new fermions, both with SM and exotic electric charge. Moreover we have illustrated
how the 4DCHM has been implemented into automated tools that have been used for
our phenomenological analysis.
The properties of the Z s andW s have been analysed in Chapter 3 where, after present-
ing the expressions for the masses and couplings of these states, we have investigated
the capabilities of the 14 TeV stage of the LHC in discovering or excluding these states
by means of DY and di-boson production processes, also paying attention to specific
features of the 4DCHM that are usually not captured by general analysis of CHMs,
such as the presence of quasi degenerate neutral resonances that, in some regions of the
parameter space, might be distinguishable and that can represent a hallmark signature
of the model. Finally we have shown that also the production of top antitop pairs can
be an important probe for this composite Higgs scenario both in cross section as well as
in asymmetry studies, as already done in the case of the leptonic final states.
Chapter 6. Conclusions 102
Chapter 4 has been devoted to the study of the properties of the Higgs boson of the
4DCHM. We have summarised the status of the Higgs searches that are ongoing at
the LHC and then reviewed the main production and decay mechanisms of the SM
Higgs boson moving finally to the analysis of the 4DCHM Higgs. Assuming firstly a
decoupling regime and then performing a phenomenological analysis considering all the
effects arising from the complete model particle spectrum, again usually not captured by
general analysis of CHMs, we have shown the compatibility of our framework with the
7 and 8 TeV LHC data by means of the Higgs signal strengths, giving also an example
of the capabilities of the 14 TeV stage of the LHC in testing this scenario. Motivated
then by the critical decision that the physics community needs to make regarding the
next generation of colliders, we have then tested the 4DCHM against future proposed
e+e colliders, using the ILC as a benchmark machine. We have considered standard
benchmark energies and luminosities proposed for this machine and we have compared
our predictions for the Higgs signal rates with the expected precision in measuring them,
for various types of Higgs production processes, highlighting the potentiality of this type
of collider in testing the composite Higgs scenario.
We have then shown that the mixing and finite spectrum effects of the 4DCHM are
sizeable in all chosen contexts, both in tree level as well as in loop induced processes,
and that they can provide modifications of the physical observables, with respect to
the case of the decoupling limit, relevant at the level of seen or expected experimental
deviations. Despite the fact that this point can only be made in a specific scenario, the
4DCHM in our case, we firmly believe that the kind of approach we have used in this
Thesis is of great importance when studying CHMs with partial compositness.
Finally in Chapter 5 we have illustrated a framework which allows for the reinterpreta-
tion of the bounds that the experimental collaborations set on extra quarks present in
many BSM models, usually obtained by assuming just one extra state besides the SM
matter content, in scenarios where more than one heavy quark, with general branching
ratios, is present, like in the 4DCHM (though not only). By means of a code that we
propose, called XQCAT, we have applied our analysis both to simplified scenarios as well
as to a physical motivated model showing how the bounds on the extra quarks masses
change with the presence of extra states. Finally, allowing the extra quarks to have
sizeable couplings also to the light SM quark generations, we have illustrated how the
reinterpretation of SUSY searches can be used to constrain these scenarios for which no
experimental results are yet available.

Appendix A
The CCWZ prescription
In this Appendix we will give some details about the most common approach used in
literature for writing phenomenological lagrangians that encode a SSB described just
in terms of the lightest degrees of freedom, the GBs, explaining the formalism due to
Coleman, Callan, Wess and Zumino (CCWZ) for writing non-linear  models.
Lets suppose to have a Lie Group G and a subgroup H both simple and compact. We
can divide the generator of G in those belonging to H and the remaining that we will
call broken generators
TA = {T a  LieH, T a  LieG  LieH}. (A.1)
Every element of g  G can be locally expressed as
g = h, h  H (A.2)
where  = () is a generic element that represents G/H and that can be written as
() = exp(iaT a/f). (A.3)
By multiplying both sides of the equation with an element g  G we obtain the trans-
formation law for ()
() = g()h(, g) (A.4)
that shows that the transformations properties of  are non-linear.
We now introduce a useful quantity, the Maurer-Cartan form, defined as
 =

that, since it has value in G, can be decomposed in terms of the generators of H and

The parallel and perpendicular components transform as

(A.7)
and it is then possible, using  (), to write G invariant Lagrangian written in terms
of just the elements of the coset that, in an effective field theory approach and at the
lowest order derivative, reads
L  f2Tr[ ()
()]. (A.8)
This Lagrangian depends only on the groups choice and can be specialised for the two
cases relevant to our work.
In the first case we chose a SO(N)/SO(N  1) coset and it is possible to prove that

Algebra of SO(5)
In a convenient basis the generators of SO(5) are given by the following matrices
tabij = 
j  aj bi a, b, i, j = 1, ..., 5 (B.1)
for which the algebra is the following
[tab, tcd] = adtbc + bctad  actbd  bdtac. (B.2)
Among the 10 generators of SO(5) we can identify the 6 generators of SO(4)  SU(2)L
SU(2)R and in the remaining 4 of the coset SO(5)/SO(4)
T a =
T aL, T
R  SO(4), T a  SO(5)/SO(4)
(B.3)
with a = 1, 2, 3 and a = 1, 2, 3, 4 giving now the following commutations rules

Benchmark points
In this Appendix we present the benchmark points of the model used for the analysis of
the gauge sector in Chapter 3, splitting them into benchmarks with fixed model scale f
and coupling constant g, for which we present various configurations or the fermionic
parameters that correspond to various widths regimes, and benchmarks with different
values of f and g, for which we present only points belonging to the small width regime.
In presenting these benchmarks we refer to the parameters that have to be fed into
CalcHEP as an input. Since the algorithms for the constrained numerical diagonalisa-
tion of the mass matrices and the computation of the Higgs potential have not been
implemented into CalcHEP, we also need to give as an input to the program parameters
that are in principle not free, such as g0, g0Y , h and mH . For this reason the list of
the input parameters is the following
f, g, g0, g0Y , h,t,b/L,R, YT,B,mYT,B ,mH . (C.1)
C.1 Benchmarks with f=1200 GeV and g=1.8
These input parameters are related to benchmark points with a fixed model scale f and
coupling constant g, chosen to be f = 1200 GeV and g=1.8, that have been used in
order to show the impact of the fermionic parameter of the model, and in particular of
the mass of the lightest extra fermion, on the analysis of the gauge sector of the 4DCHM
performed in Chapter 3.
