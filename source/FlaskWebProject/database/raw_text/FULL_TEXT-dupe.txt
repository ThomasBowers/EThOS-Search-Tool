Abstract
Proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration features both ultra-high accelerating
gradients thanks to plasmas and long acceleration distances due to high energy
contents of protons. Hence it has great potential of powering leptons to TeV-scale
energies in a single plasma stage. Nonetheless, the plasma response is different
from that driven by the electron bunches or lasers as protons suck in the plasma
electrons rather than repel them. It leads to radially nonlinear and time-varying
focusing at the accelerating region, which is detrimental to the witness beam
quality.
In this thesis, by theory and particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstarte the
viability of generation of high energy high quality electrons or positrons driven
by a single short proton bunch or a proton bunch train, which paves the way for
the development of future energy frontier lepton colliders. The hollow plasma
channel has been involved into our studies, which plays a vital role in creating a
beneficial accelerating structure. It eliminates the transverse plasma fields and
forms radially uniform accelerating fields. The former benefits preservation of
the beam emittance. The latter enables minimization of the energy spread by
longitudinal control of the beam.
The relating issues have been investigated, for example, the transverse effects
induced by the beam-hollow misalignment, and the wakefield excitation driven
by a practically long proton bunch in the uniform plasma, where the concept of
seeded self-modulation has been employed into the AWAKE experiment.

Acknowledgments
I am trying not to be sentimental but fail when recalling my three-and-a-half-year
life and study in UK. I feel myself so lucky because of all the excellent people in
my life and a great deal of support I have received from them. I would like to
express my great gratitude to them on the occasion of finishing my thesis.
I would like to first thank my super nice supervisor Dr. Guoxing Xia. I would
never have possibly completed my study without all his patient guidance and
selfless support. I appreciate the huge amount of time he makes for me, much
of which is actually squeezed out from his pretty occupied work and from his
holiday. He is more like a thoughtful and caring friend than a boss, which
makes me free to talk about my anxieties and worries with him. He always
tries his best to help. I am grateful for all the opportunities he created for me
to discuss with experts in the cutting-edge fields, develop my communication
skills and broaden my eyes. More thanks should be given to him for bringing
me on to the marvelous AWAKE collaboration, so that I have the chance to
work with distinguished theoretical and experimental scientists on the worlds
first proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration experiment, and to witness with
great excitement the first acceleration of electrons right before I graduate.
I would like to specially thank my important collaborators and also the devel-
opers of the particle-in-cell code LCODE I mainly use: Prof. Konstantin Lotov
and Dr. Alexander Sosedkin from Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics. I have
had considerable discussions with them on my simulation results and got plenty
of prompt technical support in utilising many advanced features of LOCDE and
running it on the clusters. I deeply admire Konstantins rich knowledge of physics
and his capability of quickly capturing the pivotal points of the physical issues.
His comments and suggestions on my work have motivated me to explore many
further studies, which form part of this thesis. Apart from helping revise my
manuscripts, he also offered me many tips about writing good academic papers.
Alexander although works in the physics department, is definitely an outstanding
programmer. He seems get to know all the answers to my coding or Unix issues
in no time, which I might need to spend a day or even a week on.
Many thanks to Kieran who has always been very helpful and patient. He used
to explain the physics to me over and over until I fully understood. Even when he
was busy writing his thesis, he still spared much time helping me get started on
using EPOCH and Vsim. Despite that he has graduated from the university, he
is still highly responsive with a lot of details to my questions. Special thanks to
Oznur, the postdoc in our group for her many constructive suggestions on my work
and for her much time devoted into promoting my papers and thesis. More thanks
go to my peer colleagues from University of Manchester and Cockcroft Institute:
Yelong, Tom, Bill, Toby, Agnese, Taaj. We have developed good friendships while
working on group projects in the Cockcroft Institute accelerator school, playing
room escape games, climbing stones, enjoying food and drinks, and chatting on
the way from Manchester to Daresbury tons of times, et al.
I want to thank all the academic staff in the accelerator physics group, es-
pecially the head of group Prof. Roger Jones who has been very interested in
my work and concerned about my progress. Not long ago, he invested many
efforts into the document preparation in order to nominate me as the research
postgraduate of year.
Special thanks to the whole AWAKE collaboration for the numerous efforts
they make, the great perseverance and enthusiasm they show while doing succes-
sive day and night experimental shifts for months, the creative ideas they come
up with in dealing with massive issues. The huge success in Run 1 cannot be
possibly obtained without all of their contributions. I feel privileged to be one
of this vigorous team. I have profited a lot from their scientific thinking, deep
physics insights, excellent presentation skills and nice personalities. I have pre-
cious and fun memories with them in Switzerland, Novosibirsk, Elba island, and
Manchester. I will cherish the friendships with many of them forever: Spencer,
Alexey, Barney, Anna-maria, Fabian, Mathias, Alexander, Petr, Vladimir, Ar-
avinda, Gabriel, Florence, Michele.
I also feel so grateful and lucky being accompanied by many good Chinese
friends while studying abroad: Mengying, Qin, Fan, Yuan, Dongjiao, Pengzhan,
Chunhu, Yang, Wenjun, Sen, Chunren, Rui, Emiao at Manchester, Huizhe, Wen-
feng, Rongjuan, Xiangwen, Ningning at Druham, Mengrong, Qian at Bath, Xue
at Leeds. I appreciate all the emotional support they gave me. I have priceless
memories with them in swimming, park running, hiking, cooking Chinese food,
playing board games, travelling across UK. My oversea life couldnt be so much
colourful without these great pals.
The acknowledgements cannot be written without mentioning the Reslife team
which I have worked with for one and a half years in promoting students living
experience in the university accommodation. We endeavour together to support
the students. More importantly, we are each others backup.
Many thanks to Prof. Zhengming Sheng and Prof. Philippa Browning for
accepting to be my thesis examiners. I appreciate a lot their time and all the
comments from them to promote my thesis.
My sincere gratitude goes to my beloved family who has always been there
supporting me, understanding me, encouraging me and caring me. They are my
driving force in pursing further studies and facing difficulties bravely.
I would like to thank my fiance Dr. Shaoyan Sun. Thanks for his countless

Introduction
1.1 Conventional accelerators
High energy physics is devoted to exploring the fundamental structure of the
physical world and studying the basic laws that govern our universe. By means
of particle collisions, we have been able to investigate initially the structure of
an atom, then discover the nucleus and subsequently a variety of new particles
and their interactions. For example, with the worlds highest-energy (7 TeV)
particle collider, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC, Fig. 1.1a) built at CERN (the
European Organization for Nuclear Research), the Higgs Boson was discovered
in 2012 [1, 2]. The larger energies the colliding particles possess, the more new
particles can be created and physics can be studied. In addition, as leptons are
point-like and fundamental objects, a significantly cleaner collision environment
is achievable in lepton colliders in comparison with hadron colliders and hence
higher precision for physics measurements. As a result, it is widely held that
the next energy frontier colliders should collide electrons and positrons in the
Teraelectronvolt (TeV, 1012 eV) scale.
Conventional radio-frequency (RF) accelerators have been the main tools to
accelerate particles to high energies with the RF fields sustained in the metallic

and from the design report for CLIC [3] respectively.
cavities. However, limited by the breakdown of the metallic surface walls [4],
the maximum accelerating gradient hasnt surpassed 100 MeV/m. Therefore, in
order to obtain particle energies of tens of GeV or even TeV, the dimensions of
accelerators are supposed to be at least hundreds to tens of thousands of meters
long. For instance, the accelerating facilities at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) in USA are as long as 3 km to accelerate electrons or positrons to
50 GeV. The average accelerating gradient is even less than 20 MeV/m. Circular
machines like synchrotrons are adopted to compact the accelerators, where the
magnets are used to keep the particles in a circular orbit so that the particle
energies can be boosted many turns in the ring. For example, the LHC can
produce protons up to 7 TeV. However, circular machines are not feasible for
producing TeV light particles like electrons and positrons due to enormous energy
loss from synchrotron radiation, which is caused by the magnetic fields bending
the charged particles. The radiation loss follows the relation [5]
Wloss 
, (1.1)
where  = W/(mc2) is the particles relativistic factor, W and m are the particle
energy and mass respectively, and c is the speed of light. Due to strong  depen-
1.1 Conventional accelerators
dence, the electrons will radiate away 1.13  1013 times more energy than the
protons if they are accelerated to the same energy. Hence, the future TeV lepton
colliders must rely on linear accelerators. Here it is worth pointing out that the
enormous circumference of the accelerating ring of the LHC (27 km, Fig. 1.1a) is
not because of the limit of the accelerating gradient. It comes from the strength
of dipole magnets installed limited to B = 8.33 T, which restricts the bending
radius  given a nominal proton energy W due to the relation
W  B. (1.2)
Two energy frontier linear collider candidates have been proposed to accelerate
leptons: the International Liner Collider (ILC) and the Compact Linear Collider
(CLIC, Fig. 1.1b). The ILC is designed to boost the electron and positron energy
to 500 GeV for collisions and later possibly upgraded to 1 TeV. With a planned
accelerating gradient of 31.5 MeV/m on average utilising super-conducting RF
cavities, the total footprint is expected to be between 30 km and 50 km [6]. The
CLIC exploits a novel two-beam acceleration technique where a low energy, high
peak current drive bunch transfers its power to the RF cavities where the short
main beam with low current is accelerated [3]. It is expected to promote the
field gradient in the accelerating structure to as high as 100 MeV/m and generate
centre-of-mass energies up to 3 TeV. The accelerator would be between 11 km and
50 km long. While the sizes and costs are kept within reach, they are still more
than ten times larger than for the existing SLAC accelerating facilities. It is not
surprising that such projects are funded under collaborative studies around the
world. The sizes and construction costs of such huge linear accelerators would be
prohibitive for every single country. Also it would be challenging to find suitable
locations. All these difficulties urge scientists to seek alternative acceleration

schemes which can considerably shrink the sizes of the machines and reduce the
expenses.
1.2 Plasma-based accelerators
Plasma is an electrically neutral medium consisting of ions and free electrons
which exhibit collective effects [7]. As an already ionized gaseous substance, it
can sustain large electric fields. The maximum field, so-called wave-breaking field
Ewb when the plasma electron wave breaks under an intense perturbation follows
the relation
Ewb = mecp/e = 96
ne [cm3] (V/m), (1.3)
where p =
e2ne/0me is plasma electron wave frequency, ne is the plasma
electron density, me is the electron mass, e is the elementary charge, c is the
speed of light, 0 is the vacuum permittivity. Given a plasma electron density of
1018 cm3, the cold plasma wave-breaking field reaches up to 100 GV/m, which
is three orders of magnitude higher than the electric breakdown threshold of
conventional accelerators. This implies that plasma is a promising medium for
ultra-high gradient acceleration of charged particles.
1.2.1 Laser driven accelerators
In 1979, Tajima and Dawson [8] firstly put forward the concept of plasma-based
particle accelerators [9]. An intense laser pulse shines the underdense plasma and
excites plasma electron oscillations via its ponderomotive force (now known as
laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) [10]). The ponderomotive force results from
rapidly oscillating, non-uniform laser fields and expels the plasma electrons away
from the axis while the ions are considered immobile due to large inertia in this
short time scale. The electric fields formed behind the laser pulse (i.e., wake
fields) due to the charge separation of plasma can accelerate trapped electrons
1.2 Plasma-based accelerators
to relativistic energies. The most effective way requires the laser pulse length
to be half the plasma wavelength (p = 2c/p), which was challenging for the
existing glass lasers. Hence, an alternative approach was proposed: plasma beat-
wave accelerator (PBWA) [11]. The principle is to excite the plasma wave by
two co-propagating laser pulses with a slight frequency difference . Resonant
excitation occurs when the frequency difference is approaching the plasma fre-
quency. High plasma fields are therefore generated. Another way to address the
long laser pulse issue is the self-modulated LWFA (SM-LWFA) [12, 13]. In this
scheme, local oscillations of the plasma electrons modulate the long laser pulse
(c  p) into a pulse envelope similar to that in the PBWA scheme during
the laser-plasma interaction. The modulation is resonant throughout the driving
pulse and a positive feedback is developed to further increase the amplitude of
the plasma wave.
Following the development of laser technologies, particularly the emergence
of chirped-pulse amplification (CPA) [14], single, short (< 1 ps), ultraintense
(> 1018 W/cm2) laser pulses [15, 16] are available for driving strong plasma
wakefields. A bubble regime [17, 18] is then formed where the ponderomo-
tive force of the laser pulse is strong enough to expel all the plasma electrons
from the axial region, leaving an ion volume without electrons. The bubble
forms an ideal field structure for electron acceleration in three aspects. First of
all, the longitudinal electric fields at the witness electron bunch are independent
of the radial positions, thus favourable to reduce the energy spread. Secondly,
the transverse electric fields from the background uniform ions increase linearly
with the radius, which form an ideal focusing lens. It benefits the preservation
of the electron transverse emittance. Finally, the accelerated electrons and the
driving laser pulse are spatially separated from each other, which is advanta-
geous for stable laser propagation and conserving the electron beam quality as
well [13]. The first experimental results in or close to the bubble regime were
Chapter 1: Introduction
reported in 2004 [1921] and near-monoenergetic electron bunches were obtained
for the first time. This is considered as a milestone in the development of LWFA.
After that, the LWFA has advanced extensively [22, 23]. The generated elec-
tron bunches nowadays are comparable with that needed in the synchrotron light
sources regardless of some limitations such as lower repetition rates, larger energy
widths, larger shot-to-shot jitter, etc. The latest energy record of 4.2 GeV was
created by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in 2014 [24]. In the
experiment, a 0.3 PW Ti: sapphire-based BELLA laser was employed to drive
a capillary-discharge-guided plasma with a density of 7  1017 cm3 over 9 cm.
The accelerating gradient demonstrated was over 46 GeV/m. In the near future,
they aim at obtaining a higher energy output  10 GeV with a new technique of
plasma-channel shaping.
Despite huge advantages, such as ultra-high accelerating gradients, hence
considerably short accelerating distances and linear focusing fields for witness
bunches that the LWFA brings, it is subject to three factors which limit the max-
imum acceleration length and therefore the achievable energy gain of charged
particles [10]. The first and the most serious one is natural diffraction of the
laser pulse during propagation as it is significantly focused to obtain high in-
tensity before injected into the plasma. It limits the interaction distance to the
Rayleigh length. In addition, depletion of the laser pulse due to continuous en-
ergy exchange to plasma waves sets a limit to the depletion length. Exploitation
of external guiding [13, 2022, 25] and higher energy laser pulses can relax these
two limitations to a certain extent. Still, when the charged bunch is accelerated
to the (ultra-) relativistic energy, its velocity ( c) will surpass the laser group
velocity (less than c). As a result, the bunch overruns the plasma wave and gets
into the decelerating region. To further promote the energy gain, multi-staging
acceleration [26, 27] has been proposed, whereas it demands precise alignment
1.2 Plasma-based accelerators
and synchronisation of each stage and between the drivers and the accelerated
beam, thus is technically challenging in experiment [2830].
1.2.2 Electron driven accelerators
In 1985, Chen et al. [31] first suggested that the driving laser could be replaced
by the electron beam. They introduced two bunched electron beams into a cold
plasma and demonstrated the successful acceleration of driven electrons from
0mec
2 to 30mec
2 via simulations. Unlike LWFA, here it is the space charge
force from the charged driving bunch that expels free plasma electrons and causes
plasma electron oscillations along the axis. A trailing bunch is accelerated by the
electric fields resulting from plasma charge separation. This is the prototype of
beam driven plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA). PWFA outperforms LWFA
in the following ways. First of all, the relativistic driving bunch travels at the
speed of light, it therefore does not dephase with the relativistic witness bunch.
Secondly, it is strongly focused by the transverse plasma wakefields thus hardly
gets diffracted. Furthermore, the energy content of a beam driver is determined
by the particle population and the energy per particle. As a result, it is easier
to promote the driving energies and a significantly longer depletion length is
achievable in experiment.
In the linear regime of PWFA (nb  ne, E/Ewb  1), the longitudinal plasma
electric field E (in the position of z  ct) behind the driving bunch is sinusoidal
with the plasma frequency, and the peak acceleration amplitude when kpz =
kpr  1 can be written as [32]:
Emax = 240 MV/m (
4 1010 ) (
z [mm]
)2. (1.4)
Here nb is the peak driving bunch density, ne is the unperturbed plasma electron
density, kp = p/c is the plasma wave number, z is the beam travelling distance,
Chapter 1: Introduction
z and r are the RMS (root mean square) bunch length and radius respectively.
It follows that the maximum acceleration gradient is proportional to the number
of driving particles N and inversely proportional to the square of z. This applies
equally to electron and positron drivers. The corresponding perturbed wakefields
also behave the same except for a wake phase difference of .
In the nonlinear regime (nb > ne), the wakefield excited by a dense electron
driver resembles the bubble or blow-out structure in LWFA. In fact, the
analogous investigation actually starts from the electron driven case [33, 34]. The
high density electron driver repels all the plasma electrons from the bunch volume
and forms an electron-free bubble filled with uniform ions. The transverse
focusing is linearly increasing along the radius and is constant along the witness
bunch. The longitudinal accelerating field is uniform along the radius. The
combination of aberration-free, strong focusing and a large accelerating gradient
makes this acceleration scheme ideal for the witness bunch in terms of high energy
gain and well-preserved beam emittance in a long distance.
It is worth pointing out that the positively charged drivers like positrons
behave differently in the nonlinear regime [32]. Instead of being expelled, the
plasma electrons are pulled towards positrons and then stream through them.
The resulting focusing is nonlinear radially and varies along the witness bunch.
In addition, the accelerating gradient is less than in the electron driven case under
the same condition because the streaming plasma electrons do not return as an
ensemble to the propagation axis.
A lot of work concerning electron driven acceleration has been done in the
aspects of theory, simulation and experiment since the proposal of PWFA [33
43]. In 2007, an inspiring experiment completed at the SLAC reported an en-
ergy doubling of the rear fraction of a 42 GeV driving electron bunch over less
than 1 meter long plasma [42]. The peak accelerating gradient reached up to
 52 GeV/m. Although the final energy spread was almost 100%, this work still
1.2 Plasma-based accelerators
profoundly revealed the feasibility of plasma accelerators towards high energy
physics applications. As this single bunch scheme only allowed a small number of
tail particles to be accelerated, it has been proposed to introduce a distinct bunch
containing a substantial charge to further extract energy from the high gradient
wakefields [43]. Fig. 1.2 illustrates the concept where a trailing electron bunch
is placed at the maximum accelerating region. The experiment demonstrated a
high energy transfer efficiency of over 30% from the wake to the bunch as well as
a low energy spread of 2%.

High-efficiency acceleration of charged particle beams at high gradi-
ents of energy gain per unit length is necessary to achieve an affordable
and compact high-energy collider. The plasma wakefield accelerator
is one concept13 being developed for this purpose. In plasma wake-
field acceleration, a charge-density wake with high accelerating fields
is driven by the passage of an ultra-relativistic bunch of charged par-
ticles (the drive bunch) through a plasma46. If a second bunch of rela-
tivistic electrons (the trailing bunch) with sufficient charge follows
in the wake of the drive bunch at an appropriate distance, it can be
efficiently accelerated to high energy. Previous experiments using
just a single 42-gigaelectronvolt drive bunch have accelerated elec-
trons with a continuous energy spectrum and a maximum energy of
up to 85 gigaelectronvolts from the tail of the same bunch in less than
a metre of plasma7. However, the total charge of these accelerated
electrons was insufficient to extract a substantial amount of energy
from the wake. Here we report high-efficiency acceleration of a dis-
crete trailing bunch of electrons that contains sufficient charge to
extract a substantial amount of energy from the high-gradient, non-
linear plasma wakefield accelerator. Specifically, we show the accel-
eration of about 74 picocoulombs of charge contained in the core of
the trailing bunch in an accelerating gradient of about 4.4 gigavolts
per metre. These core particles gain about 1.6 gigaelectronvolts of
energy per particle, with a final energy spread as low as 0.7 per cent
(2.0 per cent on average), and an energy-transfer efficiency from the
wake to the bunch that can exceed 30 per cent (17.7 per cent on aver-
age). This acceleration of a distinct bunch of electrons containing a
substantial charge and having a small energy spread with both a high
accelerating gradient and a high energy-transfer efficiency represents
a milestone in the development of plasma wakefield acceleration into
a compact and affordable accelerator technology.
The experiment reported here is carried out in the three-dimensional,
nonlinear regime of plasma wakefield acceleration, also known as the blow-
out regime8. In this regime, a tightly focused and short ultra-relativistic
electron bunch with a density greater than the plasma density propagates
through a long column of plasma. sr=c
vp and sz=pc
vp are the
root-mean-square (r.m.s.) transverse and longitudinal sizes of the
beam, respectively, with vp the plasma frequency. The transverse elec-
tric field of this drive bunch expels all of the plasma electrons within a
radius of about 30mm, as shown in the three-dimensional particle-in-
cell (QuickPIC9,10) simulation depicted in Fig. 1a. The Coulomb field of
the stationary ions pulls the expelled plasma electrons back towards the
central axis, which begins the wake oscillation, producing periodic ion
cavities in the plasma. This wake structure follows the beam trajectory
with a phase velocity matched to the drive bunch, at nearly the speed
of light.
In the simulation, the input plasma and beam parameters are similar
to those measured in the experiment with a simple scaling of the total
beam charge (see Methods). The on-axis longitudinal electric field Ez of
the wake, also depicted in Fig. 1a, shows that the bulk of the drive bunch
is located in a region of positive (forward-directed) electric field, and
thus loses energy. If the electrons in the rear of such a drive bunch were
to extend into the negative region of the electric field, they would gain
energy from the wake. If there were not enough charge in the long tail
of electrons to have a non-negligible impact on the profile of the steep

Chapter 1: Introduction
On the contrary, the progress on positron acceleration is slow [32, 4447].
The first proof-of-principle experiment was conducted in 2003 where a single
positron bunch was employed to drive the underdense plasma. An accelerating
gradient of 56 MeV/m was measured at the tail of the positron bunch [45]. Then
it took over a decade before the successful acceleration of positrons by 5 GeV
over 1.3 m plasma was announced [44]. The most inspiring part of this work is
that, about 109 positrons at the rear of the bunch out of the entire 1.4  1010
were accelerated with an energy spread as low as 1.8%, because the loading
of high charge positron bunch flattens the accelerating field (Fig 1.3). Overall,
the success of accelerating electrons or positrons with both a high accelerating
gradient and a high energy efficiency advances the development of compact and
affordable plasma-based accelerators. Meanwhile it proves the PWFA concept to

Electrical breakdown sets a limit on the kinetic energy that part-
icles in a conventional radio-frequency accelerator can reach. New
accelerator concepts must be developed to achieve higher energies
and to make future particle colliders more compact and affordable.
The plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) embodies one such con-
cept, in which the electric field of a plasma wake excited by a bunch
of charged particles (such as electrons) is used to accelerate a trail-
ing bunch of particles. To apply plasma acceleration to electron
positron colliders, it is imperative that both the electrons and their
antimatter counterpart, the positrons, are efficiently accelerated at
high fields using plasmas1. Although substantial progress has
recently been reported on high-field, high-efficiency acceleration
of electrons in a PWFA powered by an electron bunch2, such an
electron-driven wake is unsuitable for the acceleration and focus-
ing of a positron bunch. Here we demonstrate a new regime of
PWFAs where particles in the front of a single positron bunch
transfer their energy to a substantial number of those in the rear
of the same bunch by exciting a wakefield in the plasma. In the
process, the accelerating field is alteredself-loadedso that
about a billion positrons gain five gigaelectronvolts of energy with
a narrow energy spread over a distance of just 1.3 metres. They
extract about 30 per cent of the wakes energy and form a spectrally
distinct bunch with a root-mean-square energy spread as low as
1.8 per cent. This ability to transfer energy efficiently from the
front to the rear within a single positron bunch makes the PWFA
scheme very attractive as an energy booster to an electronpositron
collider.
Future high-energy particle colliders will operate at the frontier of
particle physics, with particle energies in the range of several trillion
electronvolts3. Beyond the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the
European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), physicists envi-
sion building even bigger machines, such as the Future Circular
Collider4, which would collide protons at energies of around 100 TeV,
but would require a tunnel of circumference approximately 100 km.
Electronpositron linear colliders are also being considered, with
proposed machines such as the International Linear Collider5 (ILC)
and the Compact Linear Collider6 (CLIC). Based on existing radio-
frequency technology, they are also expensive and tens of kilometres
long. Looking beyond these machines, methods of building compact
and efficient particle colliderssuch as the muon collider7, the laser
wakefield accelerator8 and the PWFA9are under development. Of
these, the PWFA has showed an energy gain of tens of billions of
electronvolts in less than one metre10, and has recently shown high-
efficiency acceleration of an electron bunch with a narrow energy
spread containing a substantial charge, at a high energy gain per unit
length (or gradient) (ref. 2). However, for a future PWFA-based

be an attractive scheme adopted in the plasma afterburner [48], where plasma
is used to double the particle energy coming from the linear colliders.
1.2.3 Proton driven accelerators
One basic limitation for beam driven plasma wakefield acceleration is the trans-
former ratio. It is defined as the ratio of the energy gain of the witness bunch
to the energy loss of the driver or the maximum accelerating field behind the
driver to the maximum decelerating field acting on the driver. For longitudinal
symmetric bunches, it cannot exceed 2 [35]. This indicates that the obtainable
energy gain of the witness bunch in one acceleration stage cannot significantly ex-
ceed the energy of drive particles. The upper limit can be increased by employing
non-symmetric bunches [49] or linearly ramped, equidistant driving bunch train
[50], which is nonetheless either difficult or only works for flat-top beams.
Combining multiple acceleration stages can, in principle, overcome the trans-
former ratio limit, but electron-driven PWFA requires tens to hundreds of stages
for energy frontier collider applications, which is technically challenging as men-
tioned in Section 1.2.1. The need for multiple stages inherently arises from the
limited energy contents of available drivers [51]. Laser driven wakefield acceler-
ators (LWFA) are hindered by the same disadvantage. In spite of rapid growth
of the laser peak power [52], single stage acceleration energy hasnt advanced
that much in the last decade, going up from 1 GeV reached with 40 TW laser
in 2006 [23] to 4.2 GeV record held from 2014 on [24]. Conservative designs of
LWFA-based colliders thus also rely on staging [5355].
Under this circumstance, proton driven PWFA (PD-PWFA) [5659] looks
particularly competitive as existing proton bunches have huge energy and large
populations. For instance, the nominal bunches produced in the LHC are of 7 TeV
in energy and of 1.15  1011 protons in bunch population, which corresponds to
129 kJ/bunch. It far exceeds the electron or positron bunch energy created at the
Chapter 1: Introduction
SLAC [42] (0.12 kJ/bunch) or the proposed ILC (0.8 kJ/bunch). The energy of
laser pulses is even less. For instance, the highest energy of a PW laser proposed
to be used for wakefield acceleration is about 40 J [60]. Owing to available high
energy contents, proton bunches become very promising candidates in the near
future, which are capable of bringing witness particles to the energy frontier in a
single plasma stage.
PD-PWFA was proposed by Caldwell et al. in 2009 for the first time [56].
Simulations prove that the electrons can be accelerated over hundreds of meters
long plasma to TeV-level with an average gradient of 1.38 GeV/m. Detailed
numerical analyses can be found in Ref. [57]. It should be noted that the plasma
wave generates strong focusing at the tail of the driving bunch and the witness
bunch, but very weak or no focusing at the head of the driving bunch. As a
result, for the long distance propagation, quadrupoles are necessary to prevent
the driver head from flying apart driven by the initial angular divergence.
1.2.4 Self-modulated long proton bunch driven accelera-
The aforementioned PD-PWFA scheme assumes the proton bunches as short
as hundreds of micrometers. However, currently existing high-energy proton
bunches in synchrotrons are tens of cm long, which is much longer than the
usual submillimeter plasma wavelength. For example, to get a wave breaking
field in GeV/m, the plasma density needs to be at least 1014 cm3, which cor-
responds to a plasma wavelength of less than 3 mm. Hence, presently existing
long proton bunches hardly excite strong plasma wakefields directly. Longitu-
dinal compression of the bunch length to the plasma wavelength by traditional
methods is conceivable [61, 62], but it will be too costly and technically chal-
lenging to implement, given that the required compression factor is up to several
orders of magnitude. It therefore demands plenty of RF power to firstly generate
1.3 Motivations and outline
the necessary energy chirp along the long proton beam and then huge dipoles for
path modulation [61].
Fortunately, the seeded self-modulation (SSM) [6265] offers a new way to
cope with this issue. The SSM is the seeded axisymmetric mode of the trans-
verse two-stream instability [66, 67] that develops in the beam-plasma system.
The transverse wakefield of the beam leads to rippling of the beam itself, which
further amplifies the plasma waves. Because of this positive feedback, the long
proton bunch transforms into a train of equidistant micro-bunches that follow the
plasma wavelength [6870]. With proper seeding, the axisymmetric mode devel-
ops quickly and suppresses destructible non-axisymmetric modes like the hosing
instability [7173]. As a consequence, the bunched beam can resonantly drive
strong plasma waves. The AWAKE (Advanced Wakefield) experiment at CERN
[51, 7476] relies on this concept and is the worlds first proof-of-principle exper-
iment of long proton bunch driven PWFA. So far it has successfully observed the
seeded self-modulation of the long proton bunch [77, 78] and the acceleration of
the injected electrons to 2 GeV in a 10 m long rubidium plasma [79] in the first
run of experiments. The second run has been planned and will be launched in the
year 2021 after two years shut down of the LHC. Run 2 is dedicated to achieving
a higher accelerating gradient and accelerating the electron beam over a longer
distance and with high quality. In addition, several related experiments with long
or pre-bunched electron beams [8087] are proposed or conducted to enhance the
understandings of the SSM and resonantly driven wakefields.
1.3 Motivations and outline
1.3.1 Motivations
Plasma wakefield acceleration has been developing for four decades with the most
attention fallen on the laser or electron driven cases. LWFA has been shown to
Chapter 1: Introduction
be able to generate electron bunches which are comparable to that needed in
the synchrotron light sources. The latest energy record is 4.2 GeV. Electron
driven PWFA has validated the viability of an energy doubling of 42 GeV, which
sheds light on the promising application of plasma-based accelerators towards
high energy physics. Nevertheless, the obtainable energy gain is intrinsically
liable to the drive energy contents. To accelerate particles to the energy frontier,
multi-staging scheme is necessary which boosts the particle energy stage by stage.
Given the limited energies contained in the existing lasers or electron bunches,
tens or hundreds of stages are required, which makes this scheme essentially
challenging.
Proton driven PWFA stands out under this circumstance as existing proton
bunches possess huge energies and large particle populations. The energy con-
tents are hundreds to thousands times more than those in the laser or electron
drivers. Therefore, proton bunches are the most promising candidates to acceler-
ate particles to the TeV-level in a single plasma stage. This scheme was proposed
nearly a decade ago assuming a short proton bunch, which is not available in prac-
tice at present. But it has received considerable attention with the emergence
of the SSM of long proton bunches, which enables strong wakefield excitation.
Also the success of the AWAKE experiment, which is dedicated to the electron
acceleration in the long proton bunch driven plasma wakefield, further promotes
the faith of scientists on this scheme. In this thesis, by means of simulations, we
have investigated the wakefield and acceleration characteristics driven by a single
or multiple short proton bunches which might be produced in the future and also
by the long proton bunches which are more realistic.
Unlike the laser or electron drivers, the proton bunches with positive charges
will attract the background plasma electrons instead of repelling them, which
causes the adverse phase mixing effect (introduced in Chapter 3). There are
nonuniform plasma electrons distributing in the accelerating region, that is, a
1.3 Motivations and outline
clean plasma bubble (a pure ion column) doesnt stand any more. A rough
view of this can be found in Fig. 1.3 where the driver is positively charged. The
resultant radially- and time- varying transverse focusing dilutes the accelerated
beam, leading to considerable growth of the beam radius and beam emittance.
The large beam emittance will further blow up the beam during the beam trans-
port. It follows that the deterioration of beam quality makes it unsuitable for the
applications in the colliders as the collision luminosity L is inversely proportional
to the product of transverse beam sizes [88]:
L = f N1N2
4xy
. (1.5)
Here f is the collision frequency, N1 and N2 are the particle populations of two
gaussian beams colliding head-on, x and y are the horizontal and vertical beam
sizes at the interaction point assuming equal beams. In this thesis, by means
of nonuniform plasma, we are devoted to producing ultra-high energy and high
quality electrons and positrons, which are the promising candidates for the future
energy frontier lepton colliders.
1.3.2 Outline
In this thesis, we present the motivation, physics and particle-in-cell simulation
results of proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration. The aim is to demonstrate
the viability of generating high energy high quality electrons and positrons, which
are pursued by future energy frontier lepton colliders.
In Chapter 2, we provide a theoretical description of the beam-driven plasma
wakefield acceleration in both the linear and nonlinear regime. We demonstrate
the beam loading effect and the associated properties of the beam. We introduce
the algorithms of both fully relativistic and the quasi-static particle-in-cell codes,
the latter of which is employed in our major simulations.
Chapter 1: Introduction
In Chapter 3, we introduce a hollow plasma channel into a single short proton
bunch driven scheme for electron acceleration. A favorable accelerating structure
is formed with a strong and radially uniform accelerating field, and is completely
free from plasma electrons and ions (i.e., no transverse plasma wakefields). In
addition, it preserves its shape and location up to driver depletion, thus providing
a high acceleration efficiency. As a result, the witness electron bunch carrying
the charge of about 10% of 1 TeV proton driver charge is accelerated to 0.6 TeV
over a single hollow plasma channel of 700 m. More importantly, its normalized
emittance is preserved.
In Chapter 4, we present the simulation results of electron acceleration driven
by a train of short, lower charge proton bunches instead of a single one, which
is more challenging to obtain by a significant length compression. With a hollow
plasma channel to remove the defocusing from the plasma ions, the multiple pro-
ton bunches are well confined by the basin-like potential well, which is formed
by the plasma electrons attracted within the channel. As a result, the proton
bunches can stably operate in the blowout regime, resonantly exciting strong
plasma waves. The witness electrons are accelerated to 0.47 TeV over a plasma
of length 150 m. The hollow channel also brings beneficial features for the accel-
erated beam, such as emittance preservation and low energy spread (1.3%).
In Chapter 5, we present the simulation results of positron acceleration driven
by similarly multiple proton bunches in a hollow plasma channel. The accelera-
tion of positrons is different because the accelerating structure is strongly charge
dependent. We propose to load an extra electron bunch to repel the undesired
plasma electrons and meanwhile reduce the plasma density slightly to shift the
accelerating phase with a conducive slope to the positron bunch. In this way, the
positron bunch can be accelerated to 0.4 TeV (40% of the driver energy) with an
energy spread as low as 1% and well preserved normalized emittance.
1.3 Motivations and outline
In Chapter 6, we assess the adverse transverse effects induced by the mis-
alignment between the beam and the hollow plasma channel by simulating an
initially offset or tilted driving proton bunch. It shows that the proton bunch is
less prone to the initial misalignment as it is strongly focused by the hollow chan-
nel, while the induced asymmetric transverse field leads to the drastic deflection
and eventually loss of the witness electron bunch. Adopting a near-hollow plasma
is promising to mitigate the issue, though further work is needed to determine
whether the hollow plasma structure is suitable for future applications.
In Chapter 7, we simulate the self-modulated long proton bunch in uniform
plasma. We propose a slightly sophisticated plasma taper to compensate the
adverse effect of huge proton loss caused by the significant decrease of wake
phase velocity during the development of the seeded self-modulation. We finally
maintain 24% of the initial beam charge after micro-bunching and boost the
wakefield amplitude by 30%.
In Chapter 8, we summarise the main simulation results and discuss future
prospects of proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration.
Chapter 2
Physics of plasma wakefield
acceleration in uniform plasma
2.1 Introduction
Plasma wakefield acceleration as an advanced accelerator concept has attracted
enormous attention in the last decades. By virtue of strong plasma wave fields
excited by the driving bunch, a trailing bunch can be accelerated to an ultrahigh
energy in a short distance. In this chapter, we provide a theoretical description of
the plasma wakefield acceleration and elucidate the underlying physics. First of
all, following the insights from Ruth [35] and Katsouleas [37], we demonstrate the
plasma response and the characteristics of the transverse and longitudinal wake-
fields in the linear regime where the plasma is overdense. After discussing the
limit of the linear theory [40], we then describe the nonlinear blowout regime
for underdense plasma using a brief sheath model developed by Lu [89, 90]. Next,
we discuss the beam loading in both linear [37, 91] and nonlinear [92, 93] regimes
for the sake of flat wakefields and small energy spread, and introduce associ-
ated physical properties [35] like normalized emittance, transformer ratio, energy
transfer efficiency, etc. In the end, we demonstrate the simulation algorithm of
2.2 Linear theory in nonrelativistic plasma
the particle-in-cell (PIC) codes, and compare the full relativistic PIC code and
the quasi-static code which serves most of our self-consistent simulations in this
thesis due to the high computing efficiency.
2.2 Linear theory in nonrelativistic plasma
2.2.1 Plasma density response
In the linear regime, assuming an axisymmetric, ultrarelativistic (vb  c) electron
beam traverses into a cold, unmagnetized plasma and the beam density (nb) is
much less than the initial plasma density (n0), the plasma response to the beam
can be described with fluid equations following the treatment in Refs. [35, 37].
The plasma density change in a local region is associated with plasma flowing
into or out of this region via the continuity equation
=   (nv). (2.1)
The quantity n(r, z, t) refers to the dynamic plasma electron density in the cylin-
drical coordinate system and v is the plasma electron velocity. The massive
plasma ions are considered stationary in the discussed time scale with the uni-
form number density n0. The motion of the plasma fluid in response to the fields
complies with the Lorentz force law
+ (v  )v =  e
), (2.2)
Here me is the electron mass, e is the elementary charge (e for an electron and
+e for a positron), and c is the speed of light. The fields evolve according to
Chapter 2: Physics of plasma wakefield acceleration in uniform plasma
Maxwells equations, which are given in Gaussian units:
B = 4
, (2.3)
E = 1
, (2.4)
 E = 4, (2.5)
 B = 0. (2.6)
Since the beam is ultrarelativistic, we can consider it unaltered or rigid
during the evolution of the plasma fields. That is, the beam current remains
fixed and the radial motion of the beam dynamics in response to plasma fields is
ignored. As nb  n0, the plasma density perturbation n1 is significantly small
compared to n0, where n = n0 + n1. It follows that the plasma velocity v, and
fields E, B are all first order perturbations. Keeping only linear terms, equations
2.1 and 2.2 can be written as
=   v, (2.7)
= eE
. (2.8)
Apparently, the term vB
in equation 2.2 appears in second order. Taking the
divergence of equation 2.8 and plugging the expression in 2.7 for   v into it
gives
 E. (2.9)
According to Gausss law,
 E = 4en1  4enb, (2.10)
2.2 Linear theory in nonrelativistic plasma
then by combining equations 2.9 and 2.10 we can obtain the second-order differ-
ential equation of the plasma density perturbation
+ 2pn1 = 2pnb, (2.11)
where p =
4e2n0/me is the plasma electron frequency.
Given an arbitrary ultrarelativistic, axisymmetric bunch with the density form
consisting of the longitudinal and transverse components
nb(r, z, t) = R(r)Z(z  ct), (2.12)
and applying the combined coordinate  = z  ct, the differential equation 2.11
can be expressed as
2n1(r, )
+ k2pn1(r, ) = k2pR(r)Z(), (2.13)
where kp = p/c is the plasma wavenumber, and  represents the relative position
to the bunch head. From this equation, we can learn that the radial distribution
of the plasma density perturbation exactly follows the radial profile of the driving
bunch density, which can be validated by Fig. 2.1a shown later.
The solution to equation 2.13 without source is
n1(r, ) = a sin kp + b cos kp. (2.14)
Assuming the source is a point source following a Dirac delta function, i.e., Z() =
(), and integrating both sides of equation 2.13 over  = 0, we find
n1(r, )
= k2pR(r), (2.15)
Chapter 2: Physics of plasma wakefield acceleration in uniform plasma
thus a = kpR(r). In addition, b is equal to 0 as the slope of n1 at  = 0 is
negative. We can then write the Greens function solution to equation 2.13 as
Gn1(r, ) = kpR(r) sin(kp)H(), (2.16)
where H() is the Heaviside step function with the value of 1 when  < 0 and
the value of 0 when  > 0. This is consistent with the fact that the region  < 0
is behind the bunch source where there is plasma perturbation, while for  > 0,
there is no source passing by and thus no plasma perturbation.
The plasma response to an arbitrary bunch distribution nb(r, ) = R(r)Z()
can be built up point by point by integrating the Greens function against the
bunch source, which gives
n1(r, ) = kpR(r)
sin kp(  )Z()d. (2.17)
Fig. 2.1a shows the plasma density perturbation in response to a bi-Gaussian
drive beam with nb(r, ) =
(2)3/2z2r
22z and nb  n0. Nb is the beam
population, r and z are the RMS beam radius and length, respectively. The
beam is assumed an electron beam with the following parameters: Nb = 1 109,
r = 15m, z = 20m. The plasma density is 1  1017 cm3  10nb(0, 0).
We see the perturbed plasma oscillates sinusoidally at the plasma frequency in
time (see the black line) and follows the radial density distribution of the electron
beam in space (compare the red line and the magenta dashed line).
2.2.2 Plasma fields
Previous derivation has demonstrated the plasma density change in time and
space in response to a drive bunch. In this part, we will derive the generated
plasma fields due to beam disturbance so that we can in turn evaluate their effect
on the beam.
2.2 Linear theory in nonrelativistic plasma
Figure 2.1: Spatial distribution of (a) the perturbed plasma electron density, (b)
excited longitudinal electric fields and (c) transverse plasma fields when an elec-
tron beam propagates into a uniform overdense plasma. The blue and magenta
dashed lines indicate the longitudinal and radial profiles of the driving beam,
respectively. The red lines show transverse lineouts of the corresponding plasma
density and fields. The black lines in (a) and (b) are the longitudinal on-axis
lineouts while the black one in (c) gives the off-axis lineout. Because the radial
force on-axis is zero as indicated by the red line in (c). The black lines facilitate
the comparison of the oscillation periods and phases of the plasma density and
wakefields.
Taking the curl of both sides of equation 2.4, then applying the relation 
(E) = (E)2E to its left side and plugging the expression for B
in equation 2.3 into its right side, after rearrangement we can get
2E  1
+ 4. (2.18)
The Laplacian operator can be separated into the transverse and longitudinal
components, i.e., 2 = 2+ 
. Assuming the plasma fields only depend on the
combined coordinate  = z  ct, then 2
. The source comes from the
Chapter 2: Physics of plasma wakefield acceleration in uniform plasma
drive beam and the plasma, where J = Jb +Jp with Jb = cbz and  = b + p.
From equation 2.8, we get a relation between Jp and E by multiplying both sides
by en0
E. (2.19)
Plugging this into equation 2.18 gives
(2  k2p)E =
z + 4(b + p). (2.20)
By directly applying Faradays Law (see equation 2.4) into this equation, the
magnetic field can be expressed as
(2  k2p)B = 4 bz. (2.21)
Then we have the relations among field components
(2  k2p)Ez = 4
, (2.22)
(2  k2p)Er = 4
(b + p), (2.23)
(2  k2p)B = 4
. (2.24)
Here we have used the relation 
. Denoting the longitudinal and trans-
verse plasma field functions as W and W where
W, = (E +
vb B
)z,r, (2.25)
it gives after employing the fact that the beam is ultrarelativistic (vb = cz),
(2  k2p)W = 4
, (2.26)
(2  k2p)W = 4
, (2.27)
2.2 Linear theory in nonrelativistic plasma
where W = Ez and W = Er  B. Equation 2.27 shows that the beam source
contributing to Er and B cancels out at the radial force W, which is therefore
entirely sourced by the plasma perturbation. This coincides with the fact that,
in vacuum the repulsive space charge force of an ultrarelativistic beam is exactly
canceled by its focusing magnetic force generated by the self-current. Equation
2.26 indicates the same rule to the longitudinal field.
Assuming the beam source is a point charge nb(r, ) = (r)(), the plasma
density perturbation is n1(r, ) = kp(r) sin(kp)H() according to equation
2.16. Then equation 2.22 becomes
(2  k2p)Ez = 4ek2p(r) cos(kp)H(). (2.28)
In a cylindrical system, the operator 2 is expressed as
2 =
. (2.29)
The source is azimuthally symmetric, thus the derivatives with respect to  are
zero and equation 2.28 is expanded to
) k2pEz = 4ek2p(r) cos(kp)H(). (2.30)
The Greens function solution to this inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation with a
radial delta source is [94]
GEz(r, ) = 2ek2pK0(kpr) cos(kp)H(). (2.31)
K0(x) is the zeroth-order modified Bessel function of the second kind, which
is exponentially decaying. As a result, the maximum longitudinal electric field
Chapter 2: Physics of plasma wakefield acceleration in uniform plasma
resides at the axis (see Fig. 2.1b). In addition, we can infer that the radially
nonuniform field will lead to energy spread increase of a beam with a finite radius.
The transverse field behind a point charge can be solved in a similar way from
equation 2.27. But with the Panofsky-Wemzel theorem [95], it is easier to employ
the relation between the longitudinal and transverse fields
. (2.32)
This relation can also be directly obtained by doing r-derivative of equation 2.26
and z-derivative of equation 2.27. It follows that
GW(r, ) =
GEz(r, )
= 2ek2pK1(kpr) sin(kp)H(). (2.33)
The longitudinal field produced by an arbitrary beam with the charge density
b = ()(r, ) is the convolution of the Greens function with the beam
density
Ez(r, , ) = 2k
, , )rK0(kp|r  r|) cos kp(  )drdd.
(2.34)
Rewrite equation 2.34 as
Ez = Z ()R(r) (2.35)
where
Z () = 4
) cos kp(  )d, (2.36)
R(r) =
, )rK0(kp|r  r|)drd, (2.37)
then we can quickly get
W = Z()R(r), (2.38)
2.2 Linear theory in nonrelativistic plasma
where Z  = Z
and R = R
Fig. 2.1(b-c) shows the longitudinal and transverse plasma wakefields sourced
by a bi-Gaussian electron bunch. Apparently, the plasma density wave and the
transverse wakefield share the same phase while the longitudinal electric field lags
by a phase shift of /2. It follows that the communally accelerating and focusing
phase region suitable for a witness beam occupies /2, i.e., one fourth wake
period. Also a GeV/m-scale accelerating gradient is shown and it is inferred that,
with strong transverse plasma wakefields, either the drive or the witness beam
can be focused well during the propagation. The downside is the longitudinal
field decreases with the radius, leading to an increase of the energy spread for a
witness beam with a finite radius. In addition, the radial field varies nonlinearly
along the radius, which is detrimental to the preservation of the witness beam
emittance.
It is worth pointing out that, the perturbed plasma density and the resulting
wake form due to a positron bunch follows exactly the same rule as in the electron
driven case except for a phase difference of . This is brought by the change of
sign when it comes to positive charges. To be specific, the sign of the beam
term at the right hand side of equation 2.11 changes to the positive. The plasma
density perturbation in equation 2.17 thus changes its sign, which determines the
sign change of the wakefields in Eqs. 2.34 and 2.38, as they depend on the plasma
density according to Eqs. 2.26 and 2.27.
The above derivation of the linear theory has made two approximations. First,
the beam density is essentially smaller than the plasma density, so that the plasma
response to the beam can be treated perturbatively. Second, the beam is assumed
ultra-relativistic travelling at the speed of light c, which suggests that the beam
current remains in the time scale of 1p and the radial motion of the beam parti-
cles under the plasma fields is not considered. Setting v = c obvisously simplifies
Chapter 2: Physics of plasma wakefield acceleration in uniform plasma
solving the equations, yet a more general analysis involving the relativistic effect
of the beam on plasma waves can be found in Keinigs and Joness paper [96].
2.2.3 Limit of linear theory
In the previous section, we have derived the plasma fields in response to an
arbitrary relativistic beam with a charge density form b = ()(r). For a
gaussian bunch, the corresponding longitudinal profile is () = qnbe
2/22z and
the transverse form is (r) = e
r2/22r . Here q is the charge of particle (+e for
the positron bunch and e for the electron bunch). Substituting into equations
2.35, 2.36 and 2.37, we have the on-axis longitudinal electric field after some
arrangements
Ez(0, ) =
2(q/e)(mecp/e)(nb/np)(kpze
k2p2z/2)R(0) cos(kp), (2.39)
where
R(0) =
r /2)(0, k2p
r /2), (2.40)
and (, ) =
t1etdt.
Combining equations 2.39 and 2.40, and rewriting the beam density in terms
of the particle number Nb = (2)
3/22rznb, we can get the wake amplitude in
the following expression
Eza = qNbk
p{(ek
z/2)(ek
r /2)(0, k2p
r /2)}. (2.41)
It shows that given a beam with fixed Nb, r, and z, the maximum wake ampli-
tude depends explicitly on k2p. The formula can be rewritten as
Eza =
{(kpz)(ek
z/2)(kpr)(e
r /2)(0, k2p
r /2)}
(kpz, kpr), (2.42)
2.2 Linear theory in nonrelativistic plasma
where (kpz, kpr) can be treated as a function of kpz and ra = r/z, which is
the beams aspect ratio. It is found that for r/z < 0.1 (long and narrow beams),
the optimal plasma wavenumber kp1 satisfies kp1z =
2 so that /kp
[40].
At the optimal plasma wavenumber kp1, the maximum value of  depends
only on ra. It follows that the maximum wake amplitude can be expressed as
Ezm =
(r/z). (2.43)
where (r/z) = (kp1z, kp1r). Let (r/z) = z/r(r/z), the formula
becomes a slowly changing logarithmic function of ra
Ezm =
(ra). (2.44)
However, the weak dependence on ra is non-negligible as this term varies con-
siderably for typical experimental parameters. In the limit of r/z  1, an
accurate asymptotic expansion for (ra) = 2/e[0.577 2ln(ra)] is obtainable.
The maximum wake amplitude which occurs at kpz =
2 can be expressed as
Ezm =
[0.05797 ln(kpr)]}, (2.45)
where e is the exponential constant, or in a normalized form
 1.3q
, (2.46)
where the italic e is the elementary charge and the constant term 0.05797 is
neglected as kpr  1. We can also rewrite the expression in a convenient
Chapter 2: Physics of plasma wakefield acceleration in uniform plasma
engineering formula
Ezm  (236 MV/m)(
4 1010 )(
0.06 cm
)2 ln
1016 cm3
. (2.47)
The linear theory is valid if all the assumptions are satisfied. That is, the beam
density is much smaller than the plasma density (nb/np  1), and the beam is
ultra-relativistic. As a result, the fluid velocity is non-relativistic (v  c) and
the normalized wake amplitude is less than unity, eEzm/mcp  1.
Given a fixed amount of beam charge, when shrinking the spot size till nb/np >
1, the normalized electric field can still be less than unity as the term nb/npk
in equation 2.46 dominates. It can get very large when keeping reducing the spot
size due to divergence of the logarithmic term. In physics, it corresponds to the
break down of the fluid theory. The plasma electrons are blown out radially by
the very narrow beam, and their trajectories cross. In addition, the nonlinear
effects come into play. For instance, the wake wavelength increases due to the
change of the relativistic mass of plasma electrons.
By comparing with the simulation results, Ref. [40] demonstrates validity of
the linear theory in the weakly nonlinear limit for the narrow beams. To be spe-
cific, for the electron driver, the peak accelerating field agrees with the equation
2.46 up to nb/np  10. For nb/np > 10, it follows a different expression
 1.3q
, (2.48)
where  denotes the normalized charge per unit length   nb/npk2p2r . Basically
the original logarithmic term ln( 1
) is changed into ln( 1
). We can see
now the wakefield depends on the charge of the beam instead of its density and
reducing the beam radius has little effect as now the blow-out radius is greatly
larger than the beam spot size.
2.3 Plasma wakefield in nonlinear regime
The validity of the linear theory for the positron bunch is more strict. For
nb/np > 1, the normalized peak field changes to the form
 1.3q
, (2.49)
This is because instead of expelling plasma electron away like the electron driver,
the positron driver sucks them in. The trajectories cross inevitably when the
plasma electrons reach the axis.
In the strongly nonlinear regime ( 1), the above scaling laws for electron
and positron drivers are no longer applicable. Simulations confirm that the wake
amplitude is much smaller than that given by the above expressions.
2.3 Plasma wakefield in nonlinear regime
In the previous section, we have elucidated the linear fluid theory in plasma
wakefield excitation, where the driving beam density nb is assumed substantially
less than the plasma density np, so that the issue can be treated perturbatively.
However, with intense drivers, the linear theory breaks down as more complicated
and nonlinear effects come into play. For example, the plasma electron trajec-
tories become not laminar but cross with each other. This brings in complexi-
ties and nonlinearities in describing the turbulent plasma. Also the relativistic
mass effect gets involved as the plasma motion becomes relativistic. The fields
are electromagnetic but can be treated by the full set of Maxwells equations
once the currents and charge densities are known. There have been studies re-
garding one-dimensional nonlinear fluid theory [97, 98] in the early date. Yet
the break-through experiments [1921, 46] operating in the so-called blow-out
regime [33] seek theoretical explanations in terms of multidimensional relativistic
plasma wakefields.
Chapter 2: Physics of plasma wakefield acceleration in uniform plasma
The multidimensional nonlinear kinetic theory was developed by Lu et al.
[89, 90] which turns out to be in good agreement with the simulations and hence
applies to the experiments better. In Lus theory, it assumes the plasma electrons
within a blow-out radius are completely expelled by the space charge field of an
intense electron driver or the ponderomotive force of a strong laser. The expelled
plasma electrons form a thin dense sheath along the blow-out radius which is
surrounded by weakly responding plasma electrons.
The transition from the linear to the nonlinear regime is determined by the
plasma electron trajectories. In the linear regime, the maximum radius rm(r0) of
the perturbed plasma electron always follows a monotonically increasing function
of the initial radius r0. Hence, the electron trajectories do not cross and the
plasma is a cold laminar flow (see Fig. 2.2a). However, in the nonlinear regime,
there exists an plasma electron initially in sufficiently small radius whose tra-
jectory crosses with that of another electron. In other words, rm(r0) has local
minima and maxima. As a result, it is possible to form a pure ion column below
this small radius and the plasma electrons concentrate in a narrow sheath out
of this ion column (see Fig. 2.2b). The blow-out region completely devoid of
plasma electrons but filled with uniform plasma ions is also termed as a bubble
[18]. Assuming the sheath width  is much less than the bubble radius rb, it
is feasible to get the trajectory of the bubble radius rb(), i.e., the innermost
trajectory of the plasma electrons. This quantity further determines the wakes.
In the ultrarelativistic limit, where nb  np and rm  1, the trajectory of a
particle moving along the bubble can be expressed as a second-order differential
equation

natural units, i.e., me = c = e = 1, and  = ct  z. It follows that the bubble

Here the force term r /2 comes from the uniform ion
background. The force term c /r comes from the two-
dimensional 2D" cylindrical electrostatic force from the to-
tal electron charge inside the ring, where cr0 ,r ," is the
total electron charge per unit length within the sheet with a
initial position r0 and a position r at . With the assumption
of no crossing, cr0 ,r ,"=

This equation can be easily integrated numerically. Fig-
ure 2 shows two trajectory plots for different nb0 for a bi-
Gaussian beam driver with kp#r=0.01 and kp#z=$2. In Fig.
2a" nb0=1.0 and there is no trajectory crossing, while in Fig.
2b" nb0=10, clear trajectory crossing can be seen.
Clearly there is a transition from no crossing to crossing.
We can derive such a condition if we calculate the maximum
radius rmr0" for an arbitrary initial radius r0. This is possible
because the particle trajectories all oscillate with frequencies
in the variable  that are very close to each other, so they will
each reach their maxima at nearly the same value of . This
effect can also be seen in the above figures. Trajectory cross-
ing occurs when rmr0" changes from a monotonically in-
creasing function to a function with both a local maxima and
minima.
First we treat the case r0$ a. The equation of motion can
be integrated once leading to the potential energy %r ,r0" for
a particle with an initial radius r0,
%r,r0" = 
%nba2
2 + 1&r02%1 + 2 ln%rr0&& . 20"
A particles velocity is 0 for both r=r0 and r=rmr0", so
the potential for these two radii should be the same,
%rmr0",r0" = %r0,r0" . 21"
This leads to the following relation between rmr0" and
2  r0
2 = %nba2

Rewriting this equation by normalizing the radius to a,
rm=rm /a and r0=r0 /a, gives

For the noncrossing assumption to be valid, we need
rmr0" to be a monotonically increasing function of r0, this is
equivalent to drm /dr0" 0. By differentiating the above equa-
tion we can get
%ln rm2
2&%ln rm2r02  nbr02 + nbr02 ln rm

There is no particle crossing for sufficiently large r0
since drm /dr01 as r0&. We see that for ln rm
2 / r0
=nb / r0
2 we have drm /dr0=0, which defines the onset of par-
ticle crossing. We denote this critical r0 as r0m. Combined
with the above equation, this gives r0m and rmr0m" for a
given nb. We find that u 'nb / r0m
2 satisfies the following
equation:
expu "  1 = u u + 1" . 25"
This equation has a nonzero solution u 0=1.7933. Corre-
spondingly, r0m=0.747$nb and rmr0m"=1.831$nb. In our
analysis r0$ 1, therefore only when nb$ 1.792 can particle
crossing be possible. We can verify that at this r0m, rm is a
minimum by checking if d2rm /dr0
2" 0. Differentiating Eq.
24" we get
d2rm
2rmr0

which is obviously greater than 0, since we have nb / r0m
=1.7933.
For r0' a, a similar calculation can be carried out by
taking into account the kinetic energy of the particle when it
reaches r=a. Some particles very close to the axis will not
reach r=a; for example, the particle with r0=0 will just go
through the beam without any deflection. This is very similar
to an unstable equilibrium, where every trajectory with an
initial r0 slightly different than 0 will leave the equilibrium
very quickly.
It turns out that for a beam density smaller than a critical
density surprisingly the same value nb=1.792", rmr0" is a
monotonically increasing function. Assuming r0' a, then for
nb" 1.792, rmr0" r0' a" will have a local maximum at

length is typically much less than the bubble length, we can ignore the effect of
the driving source on the majority of the trajectory or the bubble shape. After
setting () to zero, the equation of the bubble radius resembles a circle equation
except the coefficient of the second term is 2 instead of 1. Near the top of the
bubble, drb/d  0, so the trajectory rb() draws a circle. But at the rear of
the bubble, the additional term [drb/d]
2 bends the trajectory downward more
quickly (see Fig. 2.2b).
The pseudo-potential for r  rb is given by

where  = /rb and   1. The potential is in the unit of mec2/e. The length
scales like rb and r are in the unit of c/p. The longitudinal wakefield Ez and

which are normalized to the wave-breaking field mecp/e.
Equation 2.52 illustrates that the longitudinal field is constant along the ra-
dius as it is independent of r. Hence, there is no energy spread increase due
to a finite radius of the beam. Equation 2.53 shows that the focusing is linear
radially and constant along the longitudinal position, thus is conducive to the
preservation of the beam emittance. We can conclude that the wakefields formed
in the ion channel in the nonlinear regime are ideal for the accelerated beams and
are significantly superior to that in the linear regime in terms of preserving the
beam quality.
2.4 Beam loading characteristics
So far we have introduced how the wakefields are excited by driving sources in the
linear and nonlinear regime. When a trailing beam is loaded into the accelerating
wake phase behind the driver, it gets accelerated by the wakefield. In this way, the
high energy is transferred from the driver to the witness bunch. Given a trailing
beam with a finite length, the particles in different -positions will see different
accelerating gradients and thus gain energy in different rates. This leads to an
increase of the beam energy spread. In theory, if the beam is ultra-short and with
low charge, the growth of energy spread is negligible. Yet the energy extracted
from the wake is low, so is the energy conversion efficiency. In this section, we
demonstrate that by loading a properly tailored bunch to flatten the wakefield,
the undesired increase of the energy spread can be eliminated. Following that we
2.4 Beam loading characteristics
illustrate the transverse dynamics of the witness beam. Finally, we introduce the
concepts of the transformer ratio and energy transfer efficiency. Note that in this
section we specify the witness bunch as an electron bunch. The accelerating char-
acteristics of a positron bunch is different and will be demonstrated exclusively
in Chapter 5.
2.4.1 Beam loading in the linear plasma wakefield
In the linear regime, the total wakefield seen by the witness bunch is the super-
position of the wakefield sourced by the driver and its self-wake, which reads [37]
Et = E0 cos kp  4
) cos kp(  )d, (2.54)
where the second term is the self-field, b is the bunch density,  = ct  z, 0 is
the position of the head of the bunch. To lower the energy spread, Et needs to be
constant within the beam, i.e., Et = E0 cos kp0. S. Van der Meer [91] suggests
that a finite bunch with a ramping down density allows for a flat field behind the
bunch. Assuming b() = a + b, Ref. [37] resolves the coefficients a and b and
gives
b() = 
[(kp cos kp0) + (sin kp0  kp0 cos kp0)], (2.55)
where
= n1 is the density perturbation associated with the wave. This form
indicates a trianglular bunch with the peak density at the head of the bunch or
a trapezoidal shape if the back of the bunch is truncated earlier.
The maximum bunch length corresponds to the bunch density starting chang-
ing its sign, that is,
Lmax = k
p tan kp0. (2.56)
Chapter 2: Physics of plasma wakefield acceleration in uniform plasma
The peak bunch density is the density at the bunch head  = 0
maxb = en1 sin kp0. (2.57)
As a result, the maximum number of particles being accelerated is
N = Amaxb Lmax/(2e) = N0
sin2 kp0
2 cos kp0
, (2.58)
where N0 is n1A/kp and A is the cross-sectional area of the beam. The beam
loading efficiency is
b = 1
= sin2 kp0. (2.59)
It denotes the fraction of wave energy absorbed by the witness bunch. We see
there is a tradeoff between the accelerating gradient Et and the efficiency b or
the loaded particle number N . They all depend on the starting phase kp0 of
the beam loading. At the extreme case when kp0 = 0, Et = E0 and the beam
loading efficiency is zero, which is reasonable as Eqs. 2.56 and 2.58 imply zero
witness bunch length and zero charge. The loading efficiency reaches 100% for
kp0 = /2, whereas now the bunch is infinitely long and with infinite charge,
which is impractical in the linear regime. As a compromise, when placing the
beam front /3 ahead of the peak field, the accelerating gradient reaches half
the peak accelerating amplitude and the energy extraction is up to 75% without
energy spread.
2.4.2 Beam loading in the plasma bubble
In the nonlinear regime, although the total wake is not simply a superposition
of the driven wake and the self-wake, the beam with a longitudinally trapezoidal
current distribution turns out to be able to produce a flat field likewise [92, 93].
Assuming the beam current follows I() = c + d where c and d are coefficients
2.4 Beam loading characteristics
and substitutes it into the right hand side of the equation 2.50, the beam profile
can be calculated as
I() = Et0 +
E4t0 +
+ Et00, (2.60)
under the requirement that the wake is constant within the bunch, i.e., Ez|>0 =
1/2rb(drb/d)|=0 = Et0. Here Et0 is a positive value and Rb is the maximum
bubble radius. The bubble shape within the bunch can be expressed as
r2b = r
0  4Et0(  0), (2.61)
where r0 is the bubble radius at  = 0 and rb corresponds to the bubble radius
at any position within the bunch. The maximum bunch length occurs when the
bunch extends to the back of the bubble, i.e., rb = 0. As a result, Lmax =
and the maximum total charge can be loaded is
Qtotal = 2Lmax
I(0) + I(0 + Lmax)
. (2.62)
The total energy absorption per unit length for the trapezoidal bunch is then
QtotalEt0 =
. (2.63)
It indicates that the energy extraction is independent of the accelerating gradient.
Therefore, despite a tradeoff between the total loading charge and the accelerating
gradient, the beam loading efficiency can be made close to 100%.
Chapter 2: Physics of plasma wakefield acceleration in uniform plasma
2.4.3 Transverse characteristics of the loaded beam in the
nonlinear regime
In vacuum, despite the cancellation of the space charge field and the self-magnetic
field, the beam will inevitably diverge driven by its initial angular spread. For-
tunately, in the plasma wakefield acceleration, the plasma provides strong trans-
verse focusing to the beam so that it can either keep driving the wakefields as a
driver or be accelerated as a witness bunch. In the linear regime, the focusing
field is nonlinear along the radius according to Eq. 2.38. Hence, the particles
perform anharmonic transverse oscillations, leading a large growth of the final
bunch emittance.
On the contrary, in the nonlinear regime, the witness electron beam resides
in a pure ion column with a uniform ion density. The focusing field is linear with
radius (Eq. 2.53) and reads in the SI unit
r, (2.64)
where the ion density is equal to the initial plasma electron density n0. The
motion of an electron in the ion column follows
= eEr, (2.65)
which turns into the harmonic equation with respect to z
r. (2.66)
After simplification it becomes
+ k2r = 0, (2.67)
2.4 Beam loading characteristics
where k2 = k
p/2 and kp is the plasma wavenumber.  = 1/k is commonly
named as the betatron function. A general solution to this equation is
r(z) = r0e
ikz, (2.68)
which indicates a transversely harmonic oscillation of the particle at the frequency
 = p/
As to a bunch of charged particles, its envelope evolution under the initial
emittance can be described with an equation [99]
d2r(z)
+ k2r(z) =
3r (z)
, (2.69)
which is similar to that for individual particles. Here r is the bunch transverse
RMS size and  is the geometrical beam emittance. It follows that if r is large,
the term k2r dominates the term 
2/3r and 
r becomes negative, then the
beam shrinks due to the external force. Similarly, the beam expands due to its
emittance when r is small. As a result, the beam matches with the focusing
structure when r = 
r = 0, that is,
k2r =
. (2.70)
Thus, the equilibrium radius of the beam can be written as
. (2.71)
The beam emittance is an important property of a beam in accelerator physics.
It denotes the area of the bunch phase space (x, x) and can be expressed as
 xx2, (2.72)
Chapter 2: Physics of plasma wakefield acceleration in uniform plasma
where x is the radial position of each individual particle and x = dx/dz = px/pz
is its angular divergence, pz  p is the longitudinal momentum. The angle
brackets  do the average among all particles. Since the beam is normally under
acceleration, it is more convenient to use the normalized emittance
x2 px2  xpx2, (2.73)
where the transverse momentum px replaces x
 because it decreases with the
increasing p during acceleration. n can be approximated by  . If a beam
is injected into the plasma with an equilibrium radius, its normalized emittance
will be unchanged. It follows from equation 2.71 that r is proportional to 
1/4.
It indicates a weak dependence of the equilibrium beam radius on the particle
energy, which may allow for adiabatic matching of the bunch size to the plasma
focusing upon acceleration.
It is worth noting that while the bunch envelope does not oscillate in the
matched case, the particles do. The particles oscillate with the betatron wave-
length  =
2p, which is much longer than the plasma wavelength. This
concept had been used in the quasi-static approximation in the particle-in-cell
code where the beam is considered rigid while calculating the plasma response.
It will be introduced in section 2.5.
2.4.4 Transformer ratio and efficiency
The transformer ratio R is an important property of the plasma wakefield accel-
erators to evaluate the energy transfer from the driver to the witness bunch. It
is a ratio of the maximum accelerating field amplitude behind the driver and the
maximum decelerating field amplitude seen by the driver: R = E+/E [35]. It
can be calculated by assuming two rigid bunches with zero length, i.e., the driver
with N1 particles and energy W1 per particle and the witness bunch with N2
2.4 Beam loading characteristics
particles and energy W2 per particle. Given E() is the longitudinal decelerating
field excited by a unit charge at the distance  behind it, the energy loss rate by
the driver located at 1 = 0 is
d(N1W1)
= (N1e)N1eE(0) = N21 e2E(0). (2.74)
The witness bunch located at 2 behind the driving bunch sees the field induced
by the driver and its own wakefield, thus its energy change rate is
d(N2W2)
= (N2e)[N2eE(0) +N1eE(2)] = N22 e2E(0)N1N2e2E(2). (2.75)
Note that N1 and N2 are constant. The energy change rate is independent of the
sign of the charge e but it depends on the sign of the E(2), that is, the phase of
the witness bunch in the wakefield of the driver.
The total energy change must not exceed zero due to energy conservation, i.e.,
d(N1W1)
d(N2W2)
= (N21 +N22 )e2E(0)N1N2e2E(2)  0. (2.76)
This inequality equation must hold for arbitrary N1 and N2, then we get
E(2)  2E(0). (2.77)
As a result, the accelerating field gradient G seen by a particle in the witness
bunch is
d(W2)
 (2N1 N2)e2E(0). (2.78)
The maximum energy gained by the witness bunch occurs when the driver loses
all its energy and the corresponding deceleration distance is
N1e2E(0)
. (2.79)
Chapter 2: Physics of plasma wakefield acceleration in uniform plasma
The maximum energy gain by the witness bunch is hence
W2 = GL  W1(2
). (2.80)
When N2 = 0, W2  2W1, which implies the basic limitation of a co-linear
wakefield accelerator, that is, the total energy gain per particle in a witness bunch
cannot exceed twice the initial energy per particle in the driving bunch. This
suggests possible energy transfer from a high-charge, low energy bunch to a low-
charge bunch via plasma wakefields, which is constructive in a staged accelerator.
Therein the witness bunch keeps extracting energy from the low energy bunch in
each plasma stage and eventually reaches very high energy.
The transformer ratio reads
|dW2/dz|
|dW1/dz|
 (2 N2
). (2.81)
Regardless of the assumption of infinitely short bunches made in the above deriva-
tion, it can be shown that the limit on the transformer ratio applies to any sym-
metric bunch distribution. For an asymmetric bunch where the bunch current
profile is tailored longitudinally or by using multiple driving bunches, the trans-
former ratio can greatly surpass 2 [35, 37, 50, 100]. The transformer ratio has
been measured in the plasma wakefield experiments [101103].
The energy transfer efficiency from the driver to the witness bunch is easily
obtained:
N2W2
(2 N2
). (2.82)
The maximum efficiency occurs whenN1 = N2 and all the driving energy transfers
to the witness bunch, but it limits the transformer ratio to 1.
2.5 Particle-in-cell simulations
2.5 Particle-in-cell simulations
Experiments which take into account the uncertainties, imperfections and vari-
ations in reality are indispensable. Experimental results are generally powerful
and persuasive proofs whether the studied case works in the real world. Regard-
less, numerical simulations play an essential role in studying the plasma wakefield
acceleration before the corresponding experiments are conducted. This is because
the underlying physics generally involves nonlinear effects and relativistic plasma
and beams. It requires proper numerical modelling tools to explore the com-
plicated beam and plasma dynamics. In addition, the simulations offer greater
flexibility and quicker operation in adjusting the parameters to basically any val-
ues compared to experiments, which can only vary parameters in a small range
limited by the engineering technologies. Although for some modelling cases it
requires high performance computing resources, the large scale clusters are more
available than the particle accelerators with required parameters. Overall, sim-
ulation tools can save scientists substantial time and costs and also get them
to understand the underlying physics under parameters either obtainable in the
experiments or far beyond the current technologies.
In this section, we will introduce the algorithm of the particle-in-cell (PIC)
method, which is the basis of the full relativistic PIC code. Following that we
elucidate the quasi-static PIC code which acts as the main numerical tool in our
research.
2.5.1 Full relativistic PIC codes and the algorithm
The full electromagnetic relativistic PIC code has been proved reliable in describ-
ing the kinetic properties of plasma. It solves the Maxwell equations together with
the motion equation of the particles [104]. To formulate the problem, lets rewrite
Chapter 2: Physics of plasma wakefield acceleration in uniform plasma
the Maxwells equations in SI units:
B  J , (2.83)
= E, (2.84)
 E = 
, (2.85)
 B = 0, (2.86)
where 0, 0 are the vacuum permittivity and permeability respectively. We see
from equations 2.83 and 2.84 that the electric and magnetic fields E,B evolve
with time. The source term is the current density J , which is produced by the
charge motion in the system. By taking the divergence of equation 2.83 and the
charge continuity equation
=   J , (2.87)
we can get the Poisson equation 2.85 true. As there is no magnetic charge, equa-
tion 2.86 is always valid. Hence, we can simplify the problem to solving the
first two Maxwells equations while considering the last two as the initial condi-
tions, provided that the charge and current densities always satisfy the continuity
equation.
In physics, the electromagnetic fields are continuous in space and time and any
real plasma contains an extremely large number of charged particles. It is hardly
possible to store the positions and momenta of all individual charged particles,
as the required memory is far beyond the capability of computers available. PIC
codes take some approximations and employ a significantly smaller number of
numerical macro-particles to represent the real particles. Each numerical macro-
particle substitutes a cloud of many real particles which occupy a finite volume
in space and move together with the same velocity [105]. The macro-particle
carries the combined charge and mass of the real particle clump. In addition, the
2.5 Particle-in-cell simulations
fields are discretized in simulations. A finite-difference time-domain algorithm
involving Maxwells equations in isotropic media was developed by Yee [106].
The Yee lattice is popularly adopted where the electric field components are
defined in the middle of the grid edges while the magnetic field components are
in the centres of the cell faces. The code only calculates the field components
in the grids. The components at other points if needed will be calculated by
interpolation.
At the boundaries of the finite simulation window (domain), the grids are trun-
cated, which will cause some unphysical reflections of the electromagnetic waves.
Therefore, specific boundary conditions are set for the sake of accurate calculation
of the fields at the boundaries. There are different types of boundary conditions
to accommodate different situations, such as the periodic boundary condition
where the fields and/or particles reaching one edge of the domain are wrapped
round to the opposite boundary, and the perfect conducting condition where the
incoming waves are dumped in a specified region at the simulation boundary and
the particles once reaching the boundaries are removed from the simulation. The
latter is usually used for the boundaries transverse to the propagation direction.
Another type of longitudinal boundary condition allows the electromagnetic wave
sources (like lasers) to be attached to a boundary (i.e., transmitted with as little
reflection as possible) or the particles to be fully transmitted. For the simulations
illustrated in Chapter 6, the left boundary of the window traveling to the right
is set to fully transmit the proton bunch driver, while the right and transverse
boundaries all follow the perfect conducting condition.
In PIC simulation, when calculating, the derivative is replaced by the finite
difference. Define the start time of every time step T as tn and the end time as
tn+1, the update of the electromagnetic fields is as follows:
Chapter 2: Physics of plasma wakefield acceleration in uniform plasma
(1) Magnetic field update by half time step
2 = Bn T/2(En), (2.88)
(2) Electric field update by one time step
n+1 = 0E
n + T ( B
 J), (2.89)
(3) Magnetic field update by half time step
Bn+1 = Bn+
2 T/2(En+1), (2.90)
Once the electric and magnetic fields have been calculated, the update of the
particle positions and momenta occurs according to the electromagnetic forces.
The new particle distribution is used to calculate the current density, which is
then used to calculate the fields. The flowchart in Fig. 2.3 shows a simplified cycle
of the PIC code algorithm which is started after the initialization, i.e., setting
macro-particles to represent the real particles, dividing the space into grids, and
defining the electromagnetic fields on the grids.
Currently there exist many full PIC codes available for beam-plasma simula-
tons such as EPOCH [107], VSim [108], OSIRIS [109], WarpX [110], etc. While
they represent the most fundamental model, they are computationally expen-
sive especially in the high dimension and for a long acceleration (plasma) length.
Plasma-based accelerators have multiple and disparate scales. The smallest one
is the plasma wavelength (or the laser wavelength if a laser is involved). The
medium one is the beam length which is usually comparable to the plasma wave-
length or sometimes much larger when the self-modulated wakefields are under
concern. The largest one is the acceleration distance which ranges from centime-

tres to meters or even kilometres. The enormous scale discrepancy makes the
simulations rather heavy.
The Lorentz boost technique brings the scales to the comparable level by
altering the laboratory frame to a frame that propagates in the same direction as
the driver. The relative velocity of the new frame is c, where  =
1 2 and
 is the transformation relativistic factor. In this way, the driver is stretched by a
factor (1+) while the propagation distance is compressed by the same factor. It
potentially allows an increased longitudinal grid size and time step. In principle,
the computational cost can be reduced hugely by a factor of 2. The issue is in
the new frame the unphysical numerical instability occurs if the streaming plasma
particles with the velocity c resonate with the numerical electromagnetic modes
on the grid. The filters can reduce the instability but should be carefully used as
heavy filtering might affect the dispersion of numerical modes.
2.5.2 Quasi-static PIC codes
Given the fact that the Lorentz boost frame makes the simulations more com-
plicated, the quasi-static approximation has been introduced into the PIC code
Chapter 2: Physics of plasma wakefield acceleration in uniform plasma
which separates different scales analytically. In section 2.4.3, we have demon-
strated that the betatron oscillation wavelength of the particles relates to the
plasma wavelength by  =
2p. Therefore, for a relativistic beam, the time
scale of its transverse evolution is much greater than the plasma wave period.
This validates the quasi-static approximation, where it assumes the beam is rigid
when calculating the plasma response.
In quasi-static PIC code, the fields are associated with the combined coordi-
nate  = z  ct instead of z and t. All derivatives with respect to the slow time
t are now rewritten in terms of . The fields are calculated from the front to the
end of the driving beam at a specific time t. After the fields and the particle
distribution are obtained, we can advance the driver by a large time step in t,
as long as the time step is enough to resolve the shortest timescale of transverse
beam oscillations. Note that the quasi-static code does not consider the radiation
but only the static electromagnetic fields. The derivation of the quasi-static field
equations is as follows.
We firstly rewrite the Maxwells equations in Gaussian units in terms of the
new combined variable  while neglecting the time t:
B = 4
J  E
, (2.91)
E = B
, (2.92)
 E = 4, (2.93)
 B = 0. (2.94)
Given that B = ( B) 2B = 2B, after combining the curl
of equation 2.91 and -derivative of equation 2.92, we get
2B = 
 J , (2.95)
2.5 Particle-in-cell simulations
where 2 = 2+ 
. Similarly, if we take the gradient of equation 2.93 and use
the form (  E) =   E +2E, we can obtain the transverse electric
field components satisfying the equation
2E = 4(
J), (2.96)
and the longitudinal component
2E = 4

where the continuity equation below has been used

The quasi-static PIC code works in the following procedure. First of all, it
gathers the charge and current densities generated by the beam driver on the
numerical grids. They contribute to the source terms of the field equations 2.95-
2.97. Then, the layer of macro-particles for plasma particles is seeded at the front
boundary of the simulation window and advanced layer-by-layer towards the rear
boundary. After the plasma particles pass the entire simulation domain, the fields
and the particle density are determined on the grids. The calculated fields are
then be used to modify the beam and advance it in time t by solving the motion
equation for particles. We see it explicitly separates the fast scale of the driver
and the slow scale of the acceleration [111].
In our research, we have been mostly relying on the quasi-static code as our
studied cases are associated with long distances up to hundreds of meters but
the gird must be fine enough (m scale) to resolve the small beams. It is nearly
impossible to simulate with full PIC codes on the modern machines. LCODE
developed by Lotov et al. [112, 113] is our main choice, which is written based on
Chapter 2: Physics of plasma wakefield acceleration in uniform plasma
the aforementioned quasi-static field equations. It is a 2D (2d3v) code with both
plan and cylindrical geometries available. In simulation, the transverse boundary
conditions correspond to a perfectly conducting tube. The unperturbed plasma
with zero fields are taken as the longitudinal condition of the right boundary,
because the simulation window moves at the speed of light to the right and
nothing within the simulation window can reach this boundary. It takes any set
of fields and velocities reaching there as input in calculating the plasma response
afterwards. For the left boundary, it can fully transmit the incoming fields and
particles. Note that all quantities in this code are dimensionless. The units of
measure depend on the initial plasma density. For example, the times are in the
units of 1p , the lengths are in the units of c/p and the fields are in the units of
mecp/e. The simulation results calculated with LCODE shown in the following
chapters have been interpreted in SI units.
There are 3D quasi-static codes available like Quick-PIC [114] and VLPL
[104], which are useful to see the 3D effects yet not suitable for our long-term
simulations owing to huge computing resources required.
2.6 Summary
In this chapter, we have demonstrated the linear and nonlinear theories of plasma
wakefield acceleration. In the linear regime where the beam density is essentially
smaller than the plasma density, the plasma response is a perturbative quan-
tity. The plasma fields oscillate sinusoidally at the plasma frequency in time.
The transverse field is not linear to the radius and the longitudinal field is non-
uniform along the radius. The linear theory breaks down when the beam density
increases and the plasma trajectories cross. In the nonlinear regime where a
plasma bubble (a pure ion column) is formed, the plasma fields are ideal for the
electron acceleration. To be specific, the transverse plasma field is linear radially,
2.6 Summary
which preserves the beam emittance. The longitudinal electric field is uniform in
the radial direction, which causes no growth of the energy spread. We have also
addressed the beam loading characteristics and associated properties like energy
spread, beam normalized emittance, the transformer ratio and energy transfer
efficiency. In the last section, we have introduced the PIC code algorithm which
is devoted to resolving the Maxwells equation and the particle motion equation.
The quasi-static code which assumes the beam rigid while calculating the plasma
response significantly advances the computing efficiency, and thus is superior in
conducting heavy simulations.

High quality electron bunch

bunch driven hollow plasma
wakefield accelerator
3.1 Introduction
The storyline of this chapter is clearly seen from the title. We basically address
the following questions one by one: why do we employ proton bunches as the
drivers in the plasma wakefield acceleration? why is a hollow plasma channel
necessary and what features are hollow channel-based wakefields? How is the
witness electron bunch accelerated and preserved with high beam quality?
To be specific, in the main simulation part, we introduce the basic concept of
the proposed scheme and determine parameters for the PIC simulations. Then we
elucidate the transverse dynamics of the driving and witness bunches in the hollow
plasma and the longitudinal acceleration of the witness bunch, whose normalized
emittance is shown preserved. We discuss the dependence of the energy gain,
3.2 Considerations of proton bunches as drivers
energy spread, normalized emittance and particle survival rate on the channel
radius and the plasma density, and promote some approaches to further reduce
the energy spread. Finally, we comment the validity of conducted simulations.
3.2 Considerations of proton bunches as drivers
3.2.1 Competitive energy contents
In the past few decades, there has been tremendous progress in plasma-based
wakefield accelerators. The electron beam energy has been advanced to 4.2 GeV
driven by a 300 TW laser [24]. The energy gain in the beam-driven case is more
impressive. For instance, SLAC in 2007 reported an energy doubling of the rear
part of a driving electron bunch, which ended up with a witness beam energy
as high as 84 GeV [42]. However, this energy record hasnt been broken since
then. This is because, the obtainable energy by the witness particles in one
acceleration stage is physically hindered by the energy content of the driver owing
to the limited transformer ratio, and the energy of the driving electron beam used
here has reached the limit that current accelerators can produce. Multi-staging
acceleration can, in principle, boost the particle energy stage by stage to the
energy frontier. Nonetheless, it is technically challenging as it requires tight
synchronization and alignment of all the drivers and the witness bunch and of all
accelerator modules.
Under this circumstance, proton bunches stand out due to existing huge en-
ergies and large populations. As seen from Table 3.1, the proton bunch energy
produced in the LHC is orders of magnitude larger than the highest electron
bunch energy produced at the SLAC. Even the 40 year-old Super Proton Syn-
chrotron (SPS) carries ten times more bunch energy than that in an electron
bunch potentially created in the proposed ILC.
Chapter 3: High quality electron bunch generation in a single proton bunch
driven hollow plasma wakefield accelerator
Light electrons or positrons cannot be accelerated in circular accelerators due
to substantial energy loss via synchrotron radiation, whereas the linear acceler-
ators will be prohibitively long and costly to accelerate them to the TeV-scale
energies. As a consequence, it has been suggested to transfer energies from proton
bunches to the electron bunches via the beam-driven scheme. Owing to available
competitive energy contents, proton bunches have the potential to power long
distance wakefields and bring witness particles to the energy frontier in a sin-
gle plasma stage. Caldwell et al. in 2009 [56, 57] first proposed the proton
driven PWFA (PD-PWFA) scheme, and validated the acceleration of electrons
to 0.62 TeV over a 450 m long uniform plasma channel. The average accelerating
gradient is 1.38 GeV/m.

3.2.2 Dephasing length
As a proton is 1837 times heavier than an electron or a positron, its relativistic
factor is significantly lower given the same particle energy. Hence, in the proton
driven plasma wakefield acceleration, there exists a velocity difference between
the proton bunch and the accelerated electron or positron bunch. It results in a
continuous and backward phase shift of the field pattern as a whole with respect
to the witness bunch as the wake phase velocity is equal to the driving beam
velocity. For a long distance beam-plasma interaction, the phase dephasing could
be considerable thus should be taken into consideration.
3.2 Considerations of proton bunches as drivers
The relative phase change  between a proton driver and an accelerated elec-
tron bunch during a time T can be expressed as [35, 115]
 = kp
(ve  vp)dt, (3.1)
where kp is the wavenumber of the wakefield, ve is the electron velocity and vp
is the proton velocity. To avoid the electron bunch slipping into the decelerating
phase,  must be smaller than . The propagation distance corresponding to a
phase slippage of  is called the dephasing length L ' cT .
The energy change of the proton and the electron reads
d(pmpc
= qEdecvp, (3.2)
d(emec
= eEaccve, (3.3)
where Edec and Eacc are the decelerating amplitude seen by the proton and the
accelerating amplitude seen by the electron, respectively, p and e are the rel-
ativistic factors of the proton and the electron, respectively. To simplify the
calculation, we assume the wake structure does not evolve with time, i.e., the
electrons and protons see constant wake amplitudes. Combing equations 3.2 and
3.3, the phase change in an infinitesimal time interval t is
 = kp(ve  vp)t = Ewb
ei+1  ei
pi+1  pi
, (3.4)
where the subscripts i and i + 1 denote the start and the end time of the time
interval, Ewb = mecp/e is the wave-breaking field.
The momentum equations for protons being decelerated and electrons being
accelerated by the plasma wakefields are
d(pmpvp)
= qEdec, (3.5)
Chapter 3: High quality electron bunch generation in a single proton bunch
driven hollow plasma wakefield accelerator
d(emeve)
= eEacc. (3.6)
Similarly, in the time interval t, we can write
2pi+1  1
2pi  1) = qEdect, (3.7)
2ei+1  1
2ei  1) = eEacct. (3.8)
As a result, pi+1 and ei+1 can be explicitly resolved given the earlier relativistic
factors pi and ei . Then the phase shift during the time interval t is obtainable
according to equation 3.4. The total phase dephasing is just addition of the phase
shifts in all time intervals calculated in the iteration method.
After combing equations 3.4, 3.7, and 3.8, it gives
(ei+1  ei)
2ei+1  1
2ei  1)(pi+1  pi)
2pi+1  1
2pi  1)(ei+1  ei)
 . (3.9)
For relativistic electrons, ei+1  ei  1, the above equation can be simplified
to be
(ei+1  ei)
(pi+1  pi)
2pi+1  1
2pi  1)
 . (3.10)
Now we can estimate the dephasing length given the initial beam and plasma
parameters close to those used in the simulation introduced later. The initial pro-
ton energy is 1 TeV and the initial electron energy is 10 GeV. That is, p0 = 1063
and e0 = 19515. The plasma density is 5  1014 cm3. Eacc and Edec are taken
as the average accelerating and decelerating gradients calculated based on the
simulation results, which are 0.4Ewb and 0.17Ewb, respectively. Fig. 3.1 (the red
line) shows that the dephasing length is 450 m where the electrons overrun the
protons. This is obviously smaller than the simulated 700 m. The reasons are
twofold. First, in the simulation, the protons located at different positions within
3.2 Considerations of proton bunches as drivers
the bunch see different decelerating gradients and get decelerated in different
rates. While the low energy protons lag behind, giving rise to bunch elongation,
the protons with high energies in the front still propagate in a larger velocity, lead-
ing a high wake velocity. In addition, the wakefield wavelength in the simulated
case is much larger than the plasma wavelength as the hollow plasma channel is
involved instead of the uniform plasma.
Figure 3.1: Phase slippage versus the beam propagation distance. The red line
denotes the case with the initial proton energy Wp0 = 1 TeV and the decelerating
gradient Edec = E0 = 0.17Ewb. The green line denotes the case with a twice
larger initial proton energy. The blue line denotes the case with a twice larger
decelerating gradient.
According to equation 3.1, the dephasing length mainly depend on vp, that
is, the proton energy and the decelerating gradient seen by protons, because the
electron velocity ve can be generally considered as the speed of light. When
increasing the initial proton energy twice, the dephasing length increases sig-
nificantly (Fig. 3.1 green line). Doubling the decelerating gradient brings the
electrons to overrun the protons 65 m earlier (Fig. 3.1 blue line).

driven hollow plasma wakefield accelerator
3.2.3 Phase mixing effect
From Chapter 2, we know for the positively and negatively charged beam drivers
in the same condition, there is no amplitude difference between the plasma wake-
fields sourced in the linear regime but a phase shift of . The witness bunch hence
sees exactly the same field. Nevertheless, the plasma responses to driving beams
of different charge signs are asymmetric in the nonlinear regime. When a strong
enough electron or laser beam traverses the plasma, the plasma electrons near
axis are fully expelled away, leaving an electron-free bubble with purely uniform
ions distributed. The bubble provides a linear focusing to the witness electron
bunch, thus preserves its emittance. In this case, the plasma electrons initially
feel the repulsive forces at the same time and thus oscillate at the same phase.
Figure 3.2: A sketch comparing the plasma electron trajectories driven by a
dense negatively charged (e.g., electron) bunch and a positively charged (e.g.,
positron or proton) bunch, respectively. The green dots denote the plasma elec-
trons. The massive plasma ions are not shown here as they are considered sta-
tionary under the beam perturbation and thus taken as the uniform background.
On the other hand, the positively charged beam (e.g., the proton bunch)
attracts or sucks in plasma electrons from different radii, which then reach the
axis at different times. The bubble shape is formed after the plasma electrons
stream through the proton bunch. But since they leave the axis at different times,
their oscillation phases are different. This is called the phase-mixing effect (see
Fig. 3.2). It results in some plasma electrons trailing behind the proton bunch and
hence a non-clean ion bubble. With nonuniform plasma electrons distributing
3.3 Hollow plasma channel
in the bubble, the transverse wakefield is radially nonlinear and it also varies both
in time and along the witness bunch. The nonlinear variations of radial forces
could significantly disrupt the emittance of the accelerated beam and make it
far from suitable for practical applications in future colliders. In addition, the
less density compression on-axis due to the suck-in effect leads to a smaller
accelerating gradient. This has been demonstrated in Ref. [32], where it further
validates the promotion of the wake amplitude via a hollow plasma channel, which
is a vacuum channel surrounded by the plasma annulus with a uniform density.
3.3 Hollow plasma channel
Above we have demonstrated that, despite the potential of accelerating particles
to TeV-level energies in a single stage, proton-driven plasma accelerators are in-
ferior in terms of conserving the beam quality compared to the electron or laser
driven accelerators. Hollow plasma has been recognized to be capable of mitigat-
ing the beam quality deterioration, although it was initially proposed to confine
the lasers [116]. With a hollow channel, an electron- and ion- free accelerating
region with zero transverse forces is feasible, which benefits the preservation of
the beam emittance [117].
Earlier theoretical studies of hollow plasma channels were mostly focused on
low amplitude waves and linear plasma responses [25, 32, 55, 118123] and on
laser [25, 55, 118120] or electron [121] drivers that push plasma electrons aside
rather than pull them into the channel. Studies of positively charged drivers are
fewer in number [32, 58, 59, 123], but a good positron acceleration regime was
found for this configuration [59]. In this regime, the plasma response is strongly
nonlinear, and a wide area devoid of both plasma electrons and ions exists in the
channel, in which the accelerating field approaches the wave-breaking limit. In
simulations, the witness positron beam not only obtained a high energy, but also
Chapter 3: High quality electron bunch generation in a single proton bunch
driven hollow plasma wakefield accelerator
preserved its normalized emittance and reached a final energy spread of 1.5%.
The new regime opens a path to accelerating a considerable amount of positrons
to TeV-range energies with low emittance and energy spread.
3.3.1 Experimental implementation
In this section, we introduce the methods of implementing the hollow plasma
channels, as it is indispensable to testify the concept of hollow plasma wakefield
acceleration in experiment. Earlier work proposed to block the center of a UV
laser beam with a mask so that only the vapor in the annular region was ionized
if the laser intensity there was sufficient [124]. In this work, while the positron
beam was successfully guided by the hollow channel, the channel was partially
filled due to diffusion of the plasma as the positron beam arrived 200 ns later than
the laser.
An advanced method is to combine an axicon lens (Fig. 3.3a) and a spiral
phase lens (Fig. 3.3b) to form an aperture which shapes the phase and intensity
of an incoming wavefront that is initially uniform in intensity and phase [125,
126]. The shaped laser then has a transverse intensity profile with the minimum
intensity in the center but high intensity in a ring. As a result, the laser primarily
ionizes the gas in the ring and a hollow plasma channel is formed.

ax(r) = k?r, (4.10)
with k? = k sin  k is the perpendicular wavenumber. Assuming that the axicon is uniformly
illuminated, the intensity along the line-focus is given by
I(r, z) = I02
2kzJ20 (k?r) z < zmax (4.11)
where I0 is the incident intensity on the axicon. We provide a complete derivation of this expression
in Section 4.4.1. The intensity rises linearly in z until the line-focus ends at z = zmax. The transverse
intensity profile is proportional to J20 (k?r) along the line-focus. Figure 4.3 shows an example of an
axicon profile measured at FACET.
 CHAPTER 4. OPTICS FOR GENERATING HOLLOW CHANNEL PLASMAS 65
Figure 4.4: A spiral shaped optic produces a phase shift () = m where m is an integer.
4.4 High-Order Bessel Optics
We now seek a method for producing a laser focus in which the transverse profile is constant along
the focus and there is zero laser intensity on axis. The axicon optic produces a line-focus where the
transverse profile does not depend on z, but the intensity is maximum on axis. Is there a simple
modification to the axicon that retains the longitudinally-invariant transverse profile but with an
intensity minimum on-axis?
The solution is to add angular momentum to the beam. This can be achieved with a spiral phase
optic shown in Figure 4.4. The combined phase shift of the axicon and spiral phase optic is
m(r,) = k?r + m, (4.12)
where m is an integer. The resulting fields along the line-focus are proportional to Jm(k?r) and
the intensity goes as J2m(k?r), providing the desired on-axis minimum. We now derive these results
using the stationary phase approximation.
4.4.1 Stationary Phase Approximation
The axicon and spiral optics combine to form an aperture that shifts the phase of an incoming
wavefront that is uniform in intensity and phase. The field at the aperture, immediately after the
two optics is
U(r0,0, 0) = U0e
i(k?r0+m0). (4.13)
We will use equation 4.6 to propagate the field to a location z downstream of the aperture, but
first we need to rewrite the expression in polar coordinates. Making the substitution x = r cos,
y = r sin and x0 = r0 cos0, y0 = r0 sin0, we have

The kinoform is a piece of fused silica that is etched with the spiral phase pattern according to
(r,) = mod (m(r,),). (4.23)
The etching was done by electron beam lithography on a fused silicon wafer 1 mm thick and 44
mm by 44 mm wide. The etched portion of the wafer was 40  40 mm, divided into pixels of size
3.33 m. The etch depth is set by the index of refraction of fused silica, the wavelength of the incident
light, and the number of etching layers. In our first kinoform design, we used a single etching layer
corresponding to a phase shift of  radians. Each pixel was assigned a value 0 or  according to
equation4.23. Pixels with phase value  are etched to a depth of 883  9 nm, corresponding to a
half-wavelength phase shift  = /2(n 1). The error on the depth measurement is reported by the
manufacturer NIL Technologies. Errors at the 1% level have negligible eect on the quality of the
focus. The left panel of Figure 4.7 shows the design of the binary masks used in the etching process.
In previous work, the spiral kinoforms were also designed with a binary etch pattern [66, 64], but
a binary phase grating has limited diraction eciency into the first (focusing) diraction order. The
diraction eciency is defined as the fraction of light transmitted by the aperture that is focused into
a given diraction order. Numerical calculations, later confirmed by experimental measurements,
showed that the first-order eciency was only 44% with the binary kinoform.
We were able to improve the performance of the kinoform by increasing the number of layers in the
grating, forming a staircase pattern. Using the FACET OPTICS package, we designed and calculated
first-order diraction eciencies for optics with up to 20 layers. The eciency asymptotically
approaches 100% as the number of layers tends toward infinity. The trend is shown in the left panel
of Figure 4.8. For our improved kinoform design, we chose 8-layer optics as a compromise between

3.3 Hollow plasma channel
An axicon, also referred as a Bessel optic, is a conically shaped lens which is
capable of producing a long, tight focus called line-focus (the ray crossing region
in Fig. 3.3a). It shifts the light by a phase that is linear along the radius (i.e., the
distance to the optic center)
(r) = kr, (3.11)
where k is the laser wavenumber, k = k sin  is the perpendicular wavenumber,
 is the convergence angle. Given a uniform illumination on the axicon with the
incident intensity I0, the intensity of the focused rays along the line-focus reads
I(r, z) = I02
2kzJ20 (kr). (3.12)
The transverse profile of the intensity follows the function J20 (kr) (Fig. 3.4),
indicating a maximum intensity on-axis.
To obtain desired minimum intensity on-axis, a spiral phase optic (see Fig. 3.3b)
has been proposed to add angular momenta to the laser beam. The combined
phase shift of an axicon and a phase screw is thus
m(r, ) = kr +m, (3.13)
where the phase term m is introduced by the spiral optic. The resulting intensity
along the line-focus of the axicon reads
I(r, z) = I02
2kzJ2m(kr). (3.14)
Hence, the transverse intensity profile goes as J2m(kr). Fig. 3.4 indicates that
for m > 0 (high order Bessel), there exists an intensity minimum on-axis. The
larger the m is, the wider the radial distance from the first maximum to the
Chapter 3: High quality electron bunch generation in a single proton bunch
driven hollow plasma wakefield accelerator
central minimum (i.e., the channel radius) is. Note that the amplitude of J2m(kr)
decreases with m, thus to obtain the same focused intensity, the incident intensity
needs to be amplified by an coefficient (e.g., 2.96 for m = 1 and 8.77 for m = 7).
Figure 3.4: A comparison of squared Bessel functions (or normalized intensity)
versus r for m = 0, 1, 7. The convergence angle is  = 4.4 mrad. k is the
wavenumber for 800 nm light.
Equation 3.14 implies that the laser intensity at the focal region increases
linearly along z. But this is not a big issue to produce a longitudinally uniform
channel, thanks to the threshold nature of the ionization rate W (s1) which is
estimated by the ADK model [128] and drops exponentially with the decreasing
electric field. The ionization fraction is F = W when a laser pulse of length 
passes by. Given the laser pulse length, we can estimate the laser field threshold
for an ionization fraction of 100%. Normally a slightly smaller field than the
threshold will lead to orders of magnitude smaller ionization fraction [129], which
indicates a sharp transition between the ionized region and the gas region in the
radial direction. In the longitudinal direction, as long as the laser operates above
the field threshold, the ionization is not sensitive to the small increase or variation
of the laser intensity along the focus. Also further ionization of the ions is not
a concern as it requires a significantly larger electric field. Hence, the hollow
channel can be realized with a high longitudinal uniformity.
3.3 Hollow plasma channel
Although the combined optic (an axicon optic plus a spiral phase optic) per-
forms an ideal intensity shape, its implementation in practice faces some issues.
For instance, it is tricky to fabricate an accurate spiral screw due to the dis-
continuity at r = 0. In addition, the combined optic is very thick, leading to
self-phase modulation of the high intensity laser pulses. Fortunately, a kinoform
is developed which generates an approximate phase shift of the combined optic
[126]. The kinoform optic is a phase plate etched with the spiral phase pattern
following
(r, ) = mod(m(r, ), ). (3.15)
Fig. 3.3c shows an etching mask for a kinoform optic at m = 7 where each grating
is formed with 8 etching layers in a staircase pattern and each layer shifts the
phase of the light by /4.
By means of a kinoform, Fan et al. [130] obtained a laser beam with the
transverse intensity following the fifth-order Bessel (J5) profile and created a
0.8 cm long hollow plasma channel with the channel radius of  4m. A more
encouraging plasma wakefield acceleration experiment [117] at FACET (Facility
for Advanced aCcelerator Experimental Tests) of SLAC has demonstrated an 8 cm
long hollow plasma channel with a radius of 250m, where the laser with a J7
density profile ionized the lithium vapor  3 ps before the driving positron beam
arrived, so the plasma diffusion can be neglected [131]. The channel radius here
exactly agrees with the radial position of the first maximum calculated in Fig. 3.4.
A follow-up experiment [132] created a 25 cm long hollow channel. This opens
up prospects for practical applications of hollow channels in plasma wakefield
acceleration.
Chapter 3: High quality electron bunch generation in a single proton bunch
driven hollow plasma wakefield accelerator
3.4 Simulation results
Future colliders need both high-energy and high-quality electrons and positrons.
In this section, we explore the acceleration regime for electrons in a hollow plasma
channel driven by a short proton bunch, which is complementary to the work of
positron acceleration in Ref. [59]. It will be shown that the witness electron beam
can simultaneously have a high charge and experience a strong accelerating field.
This feature enables high energy transfer efficiencies, approaching those in the
strong blowout regime in uniform plasmas driven by electrons [100]. Most im-
portantly, we have discovered an equally good acceleration regime for electrons
in hollow channels, despite that the similarity between electron and positron ac-
celeration is not typical for nonlinear wakefields and even surprising. It contrasts
with the uniform plasma case, for which the acceleration structure is strongly
charge-dependent [133].
3.4.1 Concept of the proposed scheme and simulation pa-
rameters
In the uniform plasma, it is nearly impossible for the proton driver to create
an electron-free blow-out area like the electron driver does, as the protons pull
in the plasma electrons towards the propagation axis. The strongly nonlinear
interaction might create a rarefied region of plasma electrons [44, 56, 57] but it

acceleration in a hollow plasma channel. The red and blue rectangles denote the
quadrupole magnets with alternating polarity. Lq is the quadrupole period.
3.4 Simulation results
requires the proton driver to be short enough to resonantly excite the plasma
electron waves.
We propose a proton-driven hollow plasma scheme, which has the potential to
realize an acceleration region devoid of plasma electrons. A simple schematic of
this concept is illustrated in Fig. 3.5. The free plasma electrons and immobile ions
are initially located outside a vacuum channel. When the proton bunch propa-
gates through the hollow channel, it attracts plasma electrons into the channel
and drives the wave, in which a considerable amount of electrons oscillates be-
tween the channel and the plasma. At certain wave phases, there are no electrons
near the channel axis, but the longitudinal electric field is present. These regions
are ideal for accelerating the witness beam [134], as the absence of both plasma
electrons and ions results in no transverse wakefields and, thereby, conservation of
the witness emittance. In the following, we demonstrate the efficient acceleration
regime with simulations and discuss which of its specific features are responsible
for particular advantages.
We use 2D axisymmetric quasi-static PIC code LCODE [112, 113] to conduct
hundreds of meters long simulations owing to its high computational efficiency. In
the simulations, both the beam and the plasma are modeled by fully relativistic
macro-particles. The simulation window using the coordinate system (r, , )
travels at the speed of light c, where  = z  ct is a co-moving coordinate. The
window width is large enough (3 mm) to extend to the zero-field area, so the
boundary conditions have no effect on the solution. The radial and axial grid
sizes are 0.05c/p  12m. The time step is 8.4041p  6.7 ps, corresponding
to the length of 2 mm.
The parameter set of the simulated case is detailed in the Table 3.2. Most
importantly, the driver radius (rd = 350m) is equal to the channel radius rc, the
driver length (zd = 150m) is slightly shorter than the skin depth of the outer
plasma (c/p = k
p = 238m), the initial witness radius (rw = 10m) is much

smaller than the channel radius, and the driver charge is approximately 20 times
higher than the charge of electrons in volume k3p of the unperturbed plasma.
The witness charge amounts to 8.7% of the driver charge. Driver population
(1.15 1011 protons) and energy (Wd0 = 1 TeV) are intentionally chosen close to
Refs. [56], [57] and [59] to facilitate comparison.
The channel is surrounded by external quadrupole magnets, which define the
axis of the system and keep the beams focused. The external quadrupoles were
first proposed in Ref. [28] to precisely align the trajectory of the driver and to
prevent the emittance driven erosion of the driver head. For short proton drivers
that propagate hundreds of meters, the quadrupole focusing becomes a must
[56]. In the hollow channel, not only the driver head but the whole driver and
the witness are guided by quadrupoles, as there is no plasma focusing in the

channel. According to Ref. [56], the quadrupole focusing works properly (i.e., the
radial oscillations of the particles are insignificant) when the focusing period of
quadrupoles is much shorter than the period of transverse particle oscillations,
that is,
Lq << 2
, (3.16)
where Lq is the quadrupole period, W is the beam energy and S is the magnetic
field gradient. For an achievable S of 0.5 T/mm and initial driver energy of W ,
the upper limit of Lq for the driver is 16 m. As the witness bunch has a lower
initial energy, the corresponding upper limit is smaller than the one for the driver.
Since the quadrupole magnets are installed along the whole plasma channel, their
period should satisfy the smaller upper limit, i.e. the one for the witness bunch. In
addition, the simulation indicates that Lq should be larger than 0.9 m in order to
guarantee that over 98% of protons survive after 700 m propagation in the hollow
plasma. We choose S = 0.5 T/mm and Lq = 0.9 m as the optimal quadrupole
parameters which require a minimum quadrupole strength to sufficiently focus
the driver. Based on the Eq. 3.16, the initial energy of the witness bunch must
significantly exceed 3.1 GeV. 10 GeV is chosen to keep radial oscillations of the
witness bunch small. Eq. 3.16 also implies that the increase of the witness energy
during the acceleration will gradually alleviate the limitation to the quadrupole
period.
3.4.2 Transverse wakefield characteristics and beam dy-
namics
The spatial structure of the transverse plasma fields (Fig. 3.6a) in the efficient
regime correlates with the density distribution of plasma electrons (Fig. 3.6c).
The field structure in general resembles that of the bubble or blowout regimes in
a uniform plasma driven by a laser or an electron beam, but here the drive and

witness bunches reside in different bubbles. In the electron-free regions within the
channel (blue area in Fig. 3.6c), the radial wakefield is exactly zero, as seen from
the cyan area in Fig. 3.6a or the red line in Fig. 3.6b. Wherever plasma electrons
enter the channel, the resultant force focuses protons and defocuses electrons
(blue areas in Fig. 3.6a). This requires the witness bunch radius to be small.
The radial structure of the focusing force on the driver is similar to that of a
sharp reflecting wall (the green line in Fig. 3.6b), which is beneficial in two aspects.
First, the driver emittance does not blow up as the driver comes into the radial
3.4 Simulation results
equilibrium [135, 136]. Second, as the energy Wd of driving particles decreases,
the amplitude of their radial (betatron) oscillations remains constant and does not
increase as W
d , as it does in uniform plasmas [134, 137]. Consequently, driver
depletion in energy does not result in driver widening and wakefield reduction.
The strong defocusing outside the witness bunch region (see the red dashed line in
Fig. 3.6a) makes external quadrupoles a necessary part of the proposed concept,
as the quadrupoles control the witness bunch radius. Note that the external
magnetic fields of the quadrupoles are not included in the transverse fields in
Fig. 3.6. The quadrupoles also protect the driver head from emittance-driven
erosion that would otherwise shorten the acceleration distance [57], as the plasma
focusing is weak there (the blue line in Fig. 3.6b).
The witness bunch initially resides slightly behind the accelerating field max-
imum, so that the bunch head experiences a stronger field. This trick lowers the
final energy spread, since the field slope at the witness location later changes its
sign as the driver depletes. Due to strong nonlinearity of the plasma response,
the transformer ratio is about unity.
3.4.3 Longitudinal wakefield and acceleration character-
istics
The final energy gain of the witness bunch (0.62 TeV  0.6Wd0) and the required
acceleration length (700 m) are comparable to the best results of Refs. [57] and [59]
(Fig. 3.7a). The beam energy increases linearly in the initial 400 m, afterwards
the increase of the bunch energy slows down. But still, the average accelerating
gradient exceeds 1.0 GeV/m over the first 600 m. The decrease of the acceleration
rate mainly comes from the backward shift of the field pattern as a whole, which
can be seen from Fig. 3.7b. This is caused by the relatively low relativistic factor
of the driver in comparison with the witness electron bunch and is unavoidable
for driver energies of about 1 TeV or below [57]. However, since the witness bunch
Chapter 3: High quality electron bunch generation in a single proton bunch
driven hollow plasma wakefield accelerator
initially resides at the rear of the second bubble, the acceleration continues until
the wave phase shifts back by almost a half of the period (Fig. 3.8a) At this
point, the shape of the drive bunch has changed significantly (Fig. 3.8b). The
bunch elongation results from the energy depletion and low energy protons lagged
behind. Nevertheless, since driving protons cannot escape from the channel,
the driver still excites relatively strong wakefields. The final energy spread of
the witness bunch in this particular case is 4.6% (Fig. 3.7a). Note that here no
optimization of the witness bunch shape has been done in order to reduce the
energy spread.
The energy depletion of the proton bunch brings the plasma bubble shift
backwards with respect to the witness bunch. Hence, the witness bunch sees more
plasma electrons attracted into the channel appearing at large radii and forming
a defocusing region (light blue area in Fig. 3.6d within the channel). Fortunately,
with quadrupoles, the witness bunch is confined well within a small radial region,
free from the dilution of the plasma electrons. Therefore, the witness bunch feels
no transverse plasma wakefield during the whole acceleration process.
As expected, the normalized emittance of the witness bunch is preserved at
a low level of 2.4 mm mrad (Fig. 3.9a). To our knowledge, this is the first time
the emittance preservation at this small level has been directly demonstrated in
Figure 3.7: Dependence of the mean witness bunch energy and the relative
energy spread (a) and the on-axis longitudinal electric field (b) on the propagation

witness bunch.

simulations of plasma wakefield acceleration over such long distances. This proves
applicability of available PWFA simulation codes for studies of low-emittance
beams. Apparently, if the initially loaded emittance is reduced, a smaller final
emittance is obtainable owing to no blow-up arising from the transverse plasma
wakefields.
Fig. 3.9b indicates that the beam emittance increases from the initial 1.95 mm
mrad to 2.4 mm mrad during the first 15 m. The emittance growth is caused by
the quadrupoles, as there are no transverse plasma wakefields acting on the wit-
ness. The initial witness radius (10m) is larger than the equilibrium radius [57]
(7.6m) calculated based on the quadrupole strength we use. During the first
Chapter 3: High quality electron bunch generation in a single proton bunch
driven hollow plasma wakefield accelerator
few meters of acceleration, the beam energy spread quickly blows up (Fig. 3.7a)
and causes frequency variations in betatron oscillations and phase mixing. The
incoherence of particle oscillations results in the emittance growth. But after
15 m, when the beam matches with the focusing structure, the normalized emit-
tance levels off. We deliberately present the initially unmatched case here to
demonstrate the scale of this effect.
3.4.4 Parameter dependence and reduction of the energy
spread
The simulated case is typical for a wide range of parameter space of the hollow
plasma. For example, Fig. 3.10 shows that variations of the channel radius from
320m to 380m or the plasma density from 4  1014 cm3 to 6  1014 cm3 do
not result in substantial changes of the energy gain and energy spread. Further-
more, theoretically as long as the acceleration regime is free from plasma electrons
and ions, the normalized emittance of the witness beam can be preserved at a
low level, and the majority of electrons can survive with proper focusing from
the external quadrupoles regardless of the plasma channel parameters. This is
confirmed by Fig. 3.11.
In all aforementioned simulations, we have assumed that the hollow plasma
channel has a sharp transition between the surrounding uniform plasma and the
vacuum in the centre. Nevertheless, in practice, if the hollow channel is created
by a shaped ionization laser, there is a moderate or even negligible fraction of
gas ionization at the boundary where the laser electric field is very close to the
ionization field threshold, as discussed in Section 3.3.1. As a result, there exist
some finite density gradients at the boundary of the hollow channel. Fig. 3.12a
demonstrates different radial plasma density profiles where we simply assume lin-
early increasing plasma densities at the boundary in different rates. Apparently,
despite various plasma density transitions at the boundary, the witness bunch

is still accelerated to the same mean energy with an identical acceleration rate
(Fig. 3.12b). The reason is straightforward. As the proton driver is intense, the
slight density imperfection at the hollow channel boundary hardly alters the whole
plasma density distribution significantly, thus the wakefield amplitude is not af-
fected. The approximately identical evolution of the energy spread (Fig. 3.12c)

implies the same wakefield pattern for all cases. It is not surprising that the
normalized emittance is well conserved (Fig. 3.12d).
The large parameter space of the hollow plasma allows for some freedom
in optimization for some other parameters, like acceleration distance, beam-to-
beam efficiency, etc. It follows from the Maxwells equations that the accelerating
wakefield is constant across the plasma electron-free region within the channel.
As a result, the energy spread of the witness bunch is the correlated one that
appears due to different energies obtained by different longitudinal slices of the
bunch. This opens the possibility of minimizing the energy spread by tailoring
the witness bunch shape.

mean energy and energy spread on the propagation distance for different witness

The proton driver and plasma parameters are the same as in Table 3.2.
As a first step, it is possible to adjust the witness length and charge so as to
flatten the accelerating field due to beam loading effect (Fig. 3.13). For this trick
to work, the witness beam must be located in the region initially with a positive
field gradient, that is, Ez/z > 0 (Fig. 3.13a). Otherwise, the beam loading
would steepen the already negative field gradient and cause the energy spread to
further increase [133]. Note that if the loaded charge is too high (e.g., the 3.2 nC
case in Fig. 3.13a), it would overload the field, whose gradient then turns into
negative. The good aspect is a stronger electron beam loading repel more the
plasma electrons appearing in the large radii in the later acceleration stage, which
helps preserve the beam normalized emittance. With witness beams of special
shapes [37, 92, 93, 100, 120, 121], it is possible to further reduce the energy spread
while keeping high charges and also high energy transfer efficiencies, as Fig. 3.13b
indicates that optimization for the energy spread has a weak effect on the final
energy gain.

driven hollow plasma wakefield accelerator
3.4.5 Comments on the validity of simulations
In the simulations, we assume the beams propagate perfectly along the axis of the
hollow channel. In general, hosing-like instabilities [66, 138140] might arise and
destroy the beams when a transverse displacement of the beam couples with the
displacement of the surrounding plasma. For our proposed acceleration scheme,
the conducted two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations can not validate this
effect, as full three-dimensional simulations are required for that. However, the
experience gathered over decades of studying various beam-plasma instabilities
suggests that this configuration is stable, because hosing-like instabilities are more
a danger for long beams. If the beam is about one plasma wavelength long or even
shorter, the hosing instability is suppressed [141, 142], and experimental observa-
tions of the stable propagation of short beams confirm this [42, 46]. Furthermore,
large differences in oscillation frequencies suppress the coupling of transverse os-
cillations between the driver and the witness bunch [143], similar to the BNS
damping (proposed by Balakin, Novokhatsky and Smirnov (BNS)) in conven-
tional accelerating structures [144]. Because of this, even trains of many bunches
can stably propagate in plasma wakefield accelerators [64]. Resonances between
transverse particle oscillations and sign-varying pushes from the quadrupoles are
taken into account in our simulation model [28] and do not result in loss of the
witness beam quality. In Chapter 7, we will assess the beam deflection by the
transverse fields induced by beam-channel misalignment through the 2D cartesian
simulations, but note that the beam hosing does not appear therein.
For short beams (comparable to plasma wavelength or shorter), there is no dif-
ference between the 2D axisymmetric simulations and 3D simulations. Also note
that the 2D simulations conducted here have reached the front line of simulation
capabilities. The 3D simulations are hardly possible for modern codes.
3.5 Summary and outlook
3.5 Summary and outlook
In this chapter, we propose a good regime for plasma wakefield acceleration of
electrons in hollow channels driven by protons and illustrate it with simulations.
The proposed scheme solves the issue of beam normalized emittance degradation
due to strong, radially- and time-varying focusing forces in a uniform plasma
driven by a positively charged beam. In this regime, the witness bunch resides in
a region with a strong accelerating field and an absence of plasma electrons. The
region preserves its shape and location up to driver depletion, thus providing a
high acceleration efficiency and an average transformer ratio of about unity. The
witness bunch takes advantage of the hollow channel; it experiences a radially
uniform accelerating field and no transverse plasma fields. Therefore, the nor-
malized beam emittance is conserved during acceleration, and the energy gain
depends only on the longitudinal position along the bunch, thus enabling min-
imization of the energy spread by tailoring the bunch shape. The quadrupoles
used to confine the driver from emittance-driven widening also play an important
role in the confinement of the witness bunch. They keep the witness bunch from
entering the defocusing region that appears at large radii as the driver depletes.
The resultant high quality electron beam with our proposed scheme may find
applications in the next generation energy frontier colliders.
The biggest challenge of assessing the proposed concept in experiment is the
production of a long hollow channel, which is far from maturity given the fact that,
so far the longest hollow channel implemented for plasma wakefield acceleration
is only 25 cm long. However, irrespective of the variation of the channel thickness
(width of the ionized plasmas) which is determined by the peak-to-peak spacing
of the Bessel maxima, it is feasible to create a hollow channel with a length of at
least 3 meters [127]. In addition, the channel could be sectionalized into multiple
plasma cells with almost no decrease of the longitudinal fields, provided that the
gap between cells is shorter than the betatron period of driving particles [145].
Chapter 4
Multiple proton bunch driven
hollow plasma wakefield
acceleration in nonlinear regime
4.1 Introduction
Proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration has been demonstrated in simula-
tions to be capable of accelerating particles to the energy frontier in a single
stage, but its potential is hindered by the fact that currently available proton
bunches are orders of magnitude longer than the plasma wavelength. Fortu-
nately, proton micro-bunching allows driving plasma waves resonantly (discussed
in Section 4.2.2). In this chapter, we propose using a hollow plasma channel
for multiple proton bunch driven plasma wakefield acceleration and demonstrate
that it enables the operation in the nonlinear regime and resonant excitation of
strong plasma waves. This new regime also involves beneficial features of hollow
channels for the accelerated beam (such as emittance preservation and uniform
accelerating field) and long buckets of stable deceleration for the drive beam.
4.2 Evolution of the proposed concept
In the following we first explain why we study multiple proton bunches driv-
ing a hollow plasma. Then we introduce the simulated case used for illustrat-
ing the multi-proton bunch driven regime. We elucidate the characteristics of
nonlinear wakefields driven in the hollow plasma and the behaviour of multi-
ple proton bunches in the wakefield potential wells. Afterwards we demonstrate
the acceleration characteristics and conservation of beam quality of the witness
bunch. Finally, we discuss the dependence of results on four important quanti-
ties: plasma skin depth, driver radius, hollow channel radius and micro-bunch
period, and assess the effect of longitudinal plasma density inhomogeneity on the
acceleration.
4.2 Evolution of the proposed concept
4.2.1 Difficulties of currently producible proton bunches
in use
Previous studies on proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration have assumed the
proton bunch as short as hundreds of m long [5659, 146], whereas presently
producible high-energy proton bunches are tens of cm long. For example, the
SPS operates the proton bunch at an RMS length of 12 cm. The LHC runs
7 TeV proton bunches with the RMS bunch length of 7.6 cm. The reason is in
synchrotrons the proton beam usually runs for tens of to hundreds of million
turns to get huge energies. Hence, it is a must to keep the beam long so that the
transverse and longitudinal beam instabilities are relaxed and the beam can stay
stably in the synchrotrons for long times [147149]. The longitudinal momentum
noise is intentionally introduced to the beam during acceleration. In doing so,
the beam lengthens during acceleration and its longitudinal space expands. The
beam peak current decreases and stays below the thresholds of the instabilities.
Chapter 4: Multiple proton bunch driven hollow plasma wakefield acceleration
in nonlinear regime
The problem is that, such proton bunches produced in synchrotrons are much
longer than the usual submillimeter plasma wavelength, therefore they hardly ex-
cite strong plasma wakefields directly. It is conceivable to longitudinally compress
the bunch length to the plasma wavelength by traditional methods [61, 62, 150,
151], among which is the typical magnetic chicane. It has been popular in use
for bunch compression in free electron lasers. It consists of a linear RF section to
introduce an energy chirp to the beam and a set of dipoles to create a dispersive
path for the particle path modulation. To be specific, the beam is initially in-
jected off-crest in the RF accelerating field, so that the beam tail particles obtain
more energies than the beam head particles. When passing the dipoles, the high
energy particles are deflected less, hence they take shorter paths and catch up
with the low energies particles in the beam front. In this way, the bunch is com-
pressed when exiting from the magnetic chicane. However, as the proton bunch
has ultra-high energy and the required compression factor is up to several orders
of magnitude, the bunch compression is too costly and technically challenging
to implement. For example, Ref. [151] numerically calculates that it requires a
roughly 600 meters long compression system to shrink the 450 GeV, 12 cm SPS
bunch to 3.6 mm, of which the RF system operating at 720 MHz is 500 meters
long to introduce a sensible energy spread given that the field gradient sustained
in the RF cavity is 25 MeV/m. In addition, the system is roughly estimated up
to a few km long if it is to compress an LHC bunch, which is prohibitive.
4.2.2 Generation of a proton bunch train
Fortunately, the self-modulation instability (SMI) [6265] offers a new solution to
cope with this issue. The SMI is the seeded axisymmetric mode of the transverse
two-stream instability [66, 67] that develops in the beam-plasma system. The
transverse wakefield of the beam arising from the noise is amplified by a proper
seeding. It periodically focuses and defocuses different slices of the beam, leading
4.2 Evolution of the proposed concept
to a rippling of the beam, which further amplifies the plasma waves. Because
of this positive feedback, the long proton bunch is transformed into a train of
micro-bunches that follow equidistantly at the plasma wavelength [6870], as
shown in Fig. 4.1. With this multiple micro-proton bunch driven scheme, it has
demonstrated the capability of accelerating an electron bunch to the multi-TeV
scale with the exsiting LHC bunch [63]. The downside is protons located between
the microbunches are deflected by the plasma defocusing forces and form a halo
out of the bunch train. The proton halo hardly contributes to the wake excitation,
which accounts for a majority of proton energy loss. But still, in comparison with
the traditional bunch compression, this plasma-based modulation is essentially
cheap and easy, hence ideally suitable for the initial studies.
require staging of many plasma sections to reach the desired
energy. An alternative to this staging approach is to use a drive
bunch carrying many kilojoules of energy. Such bunches are rou-
tinely produced by the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS,
450 GeV, 3 1011 protons, " 20 kJ) or Large Hadron Collider (LHC,
6.5 TeV, 1:2 1011 protons, " 125 kJ).
The concept of proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration
made its appearance in 2009 after proof-of-principle simulation
papers [15,16]. In these simulations, an incoming 10 GeV electron
bunch gained 650 GeV in 400 m of plasma driven by a 100 m-
long, 1 TeV proton bunch. It was also realized that a high energy
transfer efficiency between the driver and the witness was pos-
sible for proton energies above 1 TeV [16].
The extremely short driver length required for efficient exci-
tation of the plasma wave presents a serious obstacle to a reali-
zation of the concept. The CERN proton bunches available today
are approximately 10 cm long (the root-mean-square length, zb)
and are ineffective at driving large wakefield amplitudes. From
conservation of the longitudinal phase volume we can derive that
a factor of 103 longitudinal compression of the 6.5 TeV LHC bunch
(energy spread 0.01%) would result in a 100 m bunch with a 10%
energy spread, that is 650 GeV for this bunch energy. A com-
pressor capable of delivering this huge energy spread to the proton
bunch would be prohibitively expensive and maybe as compli-
cated as the ILC itself. Simulations [16] also show that state-of-the-
art proton bunches have no safety margin in the transverse
emittance, so the longitudinal phase volume cannot be much
reduced by blowing up the transverse phase volume. Even for
lower energy proton bunches, the longitudinal compression to
sub-millimeter scales requires a long RF system to provide the
necessary energy chirp along the bunch [1720].
An alternative to extreme bunch compression is multi-bunch
wave excitation. In this scheme the plasma wave is resonantly
driven by a train of short microbunches spaced one wakefield
period apart. It is exactly this scheme that was first proposed as
the plasma wakefield accelerator in [7]. The multi-bunch excita-
tion was demonstrated experimentally by several groups [2125]
and studied in several theoretical and simulation papers [2633].
To estimate the required compression rate we assume the wave is
driven by N microbunches in the plasma of the same density n0
 1015 cm$3 as was used in [16]. The train length is then
Np %N mm. Each microbunch must fit roughly 1/4 of the wake-
field period to be focused and decelerated simultaneously. The
longitudinal space occupied by the driver thus has to be reduced
from " 2zb to Np=4. Correspondingly, the energy spread must
increase 8zb=Np times. For the 6.5 TeV LHC bunch and N10,
the final energy spread is about 0.5% or " 30 GeV, which is still
large but will not make the machine prohibitively expensive. If the
bunch is not compressed, then N" 2zb=p100.
4. The self-modulation instability
The conventional method of beam bunching involves energy
chirping along the beam and subsequent longitudinal redistribu-
tion of the beam charge in a region with nonzero momentum
compaction factor [17,20]. This method conserves the beam charge
and makes optimal use of accelerated protons.1 The plasma offers
another method that relies on a beamplasma instability. The
instability is caused by mutual amplification of the rippling of the
beam radius and the resulting plasma wave, which selectively
focuses or defocuses different slices of the beam. Under proper
conditions, the instability splits the beam into microbunches
spaced by exactly one plasma wavelength (Fig. 1). Beam particles
initially located between the microbunches are defocused by the
plasma wave and form a wide halo around the bunch train (Fig. 2).
Although plasma-based bunching is energy inefficient (as a major
fraction of the proton beam energy is lost in the halo), it is rela-
tively cheap and easy, so it is ideally suited for first proof-of-
principle experiments on proton driven wakefield acceleration.
The instability of interest is the self-modulation instability
(SMI), which belongs to the large family of beamplasma
instabilities (see review [35]). The SMI can be viewed as the axi-
symmetric mode of the transverse two-stream (TTS) instability
[36,37]. The latter is characterized by a low beam density nbn0,
radial beam non-uniformity, and high relativistic factor of the
beam. The SMI is a convective instability that grows both along the
bunch and along the plasma.
It was noticed in simulations [38] that the SMI initiated by a
small seed perturbation transforms a long particle beam into a
bunch train. The seed perturbation is needed to give preference to
a single unstable mode. Otherwise a competitive growth of several
modes would inevitably destroy the beam even in the fully axi-
symmetric setup [30,39]. If an externally seeded mode dominates,
it suppresses growth of other modes and produces a train of well-
separated microbunches. Three-dimensional simulations [40]
confirmed that non-axisymmetric modes of the TTS instability
(hosing modes [36,37]) are also suppressed if the seed perturba-
tion is strong enough. The formed bunches propagate stably dur-
ing very long distances, provided that the nonlinear regime is
avoided [41]. This result has opened the path to experimental
verification of proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration.
The parasitic instabilities could originate from shot noise,
which is very low for long beams [42], so the seed wakefield does
not have to be very strong either. A short electron bunch [42], a
powerful laser pulse [43], a sharp cut in the bunch current profile
[40,44], or a relativistic ionization front co-propagating within the
drive bunch can seed the SMI quite well. Analytical and numerical
calculations, however, have shown that bunches with long rise
times (longer than or about the plasma wavelength) do not pro-
duce stable bunch trains [30,38,39]. A quantitative theory which
would determine the minimum acceptable seed strength is still
missing. Available theoretical studies are mainly focused on the
linear stage of the instabilities in the case of narrow beams with a
constant emittance [41,45,46]. However, this problem is not of a
vital importance now, since a sufficient seeding method was
chosen for the first experimental realization, which is a co-
propagating ionization front created by a short laser pulse

A more efficient approach to create a sequence of short proton bunches is the
longitudinal density modulation, the mechanism of which resembles that of the
longitudinal bunch compression mentioned above, except that the energy chirping
operates at a much higher frequency. Ref. [152] demonstrates the basic idea,
where a mm-wavelength dielectric accelerating structure is used to bring energy
modulation to the long proton beam, then the energy modulation is transformed
Chapter 4: Multiple proton bunch driven hollow plasma wakefield acceleration
in nonlinear regime
into proton micro-bunching with the beamline of magnetic dipoles as the proton
path in the dipoles linearly depends on the proton momentum (Fig. 4.2). It
has been calculated that, with a 5 m long dielectric accelerator whose operation
frequency is 300 GHz and field gradient is over 100 MeV/m, plus a 120 m long
magnetic beamline, the SPS bunch is transformed into a train of 1 mm long short
proton bunches. Apparently, the longitudinal modulation is substantially less
challenging than the bunch compression in creating efficient proton bunches for
the plasma wakefield acceleration. Also more protons remain in use in comparison
with the transverse modulation based on SMI.

THE DIELECTRIC ACCELERATING
STRUCTURE
Waveguide parameters and self-consistent beam dynam-
ics calculations were carried out in the DynPart code [9,10].
For creation of a wakefield with the required parameters (the
basic frequency of 300 GHz, electric field above 100 MV/m,
we use a dielectric waveguide with an internal radius of vac-
uum channel Rc = 1 mm, dielectric permittivity  = 3.75
(quartz). The external radius of dielectric Rw = 1.061 mm,
thickness of dielectric d = 0.061 mm. Dielectric thickness
with the given frequency depends on waveguide radius (in
case of Rc = 2 mm d = 0.0334 mm). Radius of the waveg-
uide defines the amplitude of the wakefield in case of the
given value of electron bunch charge and its length. We will
consider a Gaussian electron bunch. Length of the bunch
defines the spectrum of the excited field. Increase in bunch
length leads to lower generated wakefield and, at the same
time, to exponential suppression of high-frequency modes
of the waveguide. Reduction of the bunch length leads to
higher generated wakefield, but, at the same time, to increase
in quantity of the excited waveguide modes. As a result, char-
acter of the field becomes non-uniform in amplitude. In this
regard, we will select such a minimum length of the bunch
which provides the maximum amplitude, but excites almost
pure single-mode of the wakefield. Achieving 100 MV/m
amplitude wakefield in the waveguide with Rc = 1 mm and
length L = 5 m requires electron beam charge Q = 5 nC
and energy W0 = 600 MeV. The mean squared length of
the bunch which meets the requirements described above is
z = 0.1 mm.
The initial transverse parameters of electron bunch are
defined by its transverse dynamics in the dielectric waveg-
uide. The field generated by the electron bunch affects both
electron and proton beams. If electron bunch is slightly
shifted from the waveguide axis the transverse component
of the wakefield can reach significant values, leading to elec-
tron beam defocusing and loss due to the beam break-up
instability. To keep the intense electron bunch on-axis the
strong quadrupole focusing is required. The value of the
focusing magnetic field for not superconducting (warm)
magnets on waveguide border, as a rule, doesnt exceed
B0 = 1.5 T, which we will use in these calculations. For
the fixed magnetic field gradient inside the quadrupoles the
maximum travel distance for the electron bunch is deter-
mined by the initial shift of the bunch from the axis as well
as the length of the focusing section. There is an optimum
length of the focusing section (i.e. the optimum average
beta-function of the quadrupole channel). We will select the
transverse size of the electron bunch x = y = 0.05 mm.
The typical required beta-function of the quadrupole focus-
ing channel is  10 cm meaning that the maximum nor-
malized emittance of the matched beam nx = 2x/x 
1200 (0.05 mm)2/100 mm = 30 mm mrad which is around
10 times higher than the typical electron beam emittance
produced by photo-injectors. This means that significant
emittance blow-up in the electron bunch compression system
can be tolerated.
The best electron beam transfer is achieved in our simu-
lations with 11 cm long FODO period, while the length of
every quadrupole is 4.7 cm. The magnetic field at the pole
of the first quadrupole is 1.5 T. The strength of the follow-
ing quadrupoles is decreasing proportional to the energy of
electrons in the middle of the bunch.

4.2.3 Necessity of a hollow plasma channel
While the SMI forces the micro-bunching of the long proton bunch and allows har-
nessing high energy protons in the plasma wakefield acceleration, it intrinsically
limits the beam-plasma interaction to the linear or weakly nonlinear regimes [63,
153, 154]. This is because the wave period elongates as nonlinear effects come into
play, and the wave eventually falls out of resonance with the bunch train [153].
For the pre-formed proton bunch train via the longitudinal modulation, assuming
4.2 Evolution of the proposed concept
a first proton bunch drives nonlinear wakefields, then in the trailing bubble areas
the ions are more prevalent than the plasma electrons, which determines them
defocusing for the subsequent proton bunches if injected. Therefore, the multiple
proton bunches can only stably operate in the linear regime in uniform plasma.
However, in the linear regime, the plasma focusing on the witness bunch strongly
depends on its density. For a high witness bunch charge, the focusing nonlinearly
varies both across and along the witness bunch [136]. The accelerating field also
inevitably varies radially instead of being constant as in the nonlinear regime,
which is detrimental to the witness beam quality [37].
The hollow plasma channel [25] is generally one of two effective solutions to
the deterioration issues of witness beam quality discussed above. Its features
have been demonstrated in Chapter 3. Another solution is the strongly nonlinear
(blowout) regime in which the witness bunch propagates in a bubble void of
plasma electrons, but containing plasma ions [18, 34]. The blowout regime is
easier to implement experimentally, thus it has been extensively studied during
the last two decades [10, 22]. However, it has several potential drawbacks. First,
very dense particle beams required for collider applications can produce large
perturbations in the ion density, giving rise to nonlinear transverse fields inside
the bubble and degradation of the witness beam quality [155]. Although massive
ions with heavier elements are less prone to density perturbations, they incur a
prohibitively large growth of witness emittance from multiple Coulomb scattering
[156, 157]. Most importantly, the bubble naturally appears for laser or electron
drivers, but not for protons or positrons. There is a blowout-like regime for
positively charged drivers [44, 56, 57], but the witness bunch quality degrades
more due to the presence of plasma electrons in the bubble.
The hollow plasma channel is free from the aforementioned drawbacks, which
stimulates excessive theoretical studies even though experimental implementation
of such a channel is still in its infancy [117]. Up to now, all theoretical studies of
Chapter 4: Multiple proton bunch driven hollow plasma wakefield acceleration
in nonlinear regime
hollow channels were dedicated to short drivers (both for particle beams [32, 58,
59, 121, 123, 146, 158] and for lasers [25, 55, 118120, 159161]). In particular,
an advantageous nonlinear regime has been discovered for short proton bunches
of a high charge [58, 59, 146], whereas these bunches are difficult to produce.
In this chapter, we investigate whether equally good acceleration conditions are
possible with trains of short, lower charge proton bunches.
4.3 Simulations of the proposed regime
4.3.1 Considerations of beam and plasma parameters
We propose to introduce ten identical and equidistant proton bunches to an ax-
isymmetric hollow channel of radius rc. The surrounding plasma outside the
channel is of uniform density np. The bunches initially have the density distribu-

, |  i| <

where r and z are the RMS bunch radius and length, Nb is the bunch popula-
tion, and i is the centroid of the i-th bunch, where  = z ct. The shifted cosine
shape is a convenient approximation to the Gaussian shape with the RMS length
of z, but without infinitely tails. The bunch train period is  10z. The electron
witness bunch has a similar shifted cosine shape and is initially positioned beyond
the maximum accelerating field to extend the acceleration distance [146]. The
witness charge and shape are not optimized for the minimum energy spread, as
we do not intend to demonstrate the capabilities of the optimal beam loading.
The initial witness radius is much smaller than the channel radius, which is nec-
essary for the sake of emittance conservation. Still, it is not as small as required
4.3 Simulations of the proposed regime
for collider applications, since this would require reducing the simulation grid size
and increasing the simulation time impractically.

In order to resonantly drive strong plasma waves, the bunches are supposed to
be in tune with the wakefields and reside in the decelerating phases. Presence of
the hollow channel results in longer wakefield wavelength than in uniform plasma.
Given the bunch period, the wider the channel, the larger the required plasma
density. The channel must be wide enough to accommodate most of the driver
particles, so we choose rc  3r and adjust the plasma density to fit the resonance
between the bunches and wakefields. Similarly to Refs. [5659, 146], we surround
the plasma by focusing quadrupole magnets, which keep the driver head from
emittance-driven erosion and control the witness electron trajectories.
Chapter 4: Multiple proton bunch driven hollow plasma wakefield acceleration
in nonlinear regime
The beam and plasma parameters are given in detail in Table 4.1. A typical
energy of 1 TeV is chosen as the driver energy. Such high energy also allows us
to verify the long term (150 m in our simulated case) bunch propagation and ex-
citation of nonlinear wakes. The simulations are performed with the 2D LCODE
[112, 113] using the cylindrical geometry (r, , ).
4.3.2 Nonlinear wakefield excitation in hollow plasma
In the proposed regime, most driver protons are initially located within the hollow
channel radius of 200m (Fig. 4.3a). Protons that start inside the surrounding
plasma experience a positive radial force (Fig. 4.3c) and are quickly defocused
(Fig. 4.3e). This results in some change of the plasma wave amplitude driven
in the first few meters of propagation (Fig. 4.3a). In addition, the wave ampli-
tude increases with the distance from the driver head. This leads to nonlinear
elongation of the wakefield period [153]. Hence the wake is not strictly periodic.
Nevertheless, since the elongation is insignificant, all bunches still reside in the
decelerating phases and see rising decelerating gradients on average.
In view of the perturbation of plasma electron density (Fig. 4.3b) and the
bunch portraits (Fig. 4.3e), we see that the first driving bunch stays in a weakly
nonlinear wake and the subsequent bunches stay in almost spherical plasma bub-
bles and experience nonlinear waves of increasing amplitude. The maximum
radius of each bubble is larger than the hollow channel radius. It suggests the ex-
istence of areas out of the hollow channel but within the plasma electron sheath,
where the uniformly distributed plasma ions are more prevalent than the plasma
electrons being pulled there. These areas correspond to the yellow and red regions
in Fig. 4.3c denoting positive transverse wakefields. These positive fields will de-
focus the protons if they get there. The blue area within the channel in Fig. 4.3c
imposes focusing on the protons. It is created by plasma electrons attracted into
the channel, whose trajectories are seen in Fig. 4.3b.
4.3 Simulations of the proposed regime

The observation window travels to the right at the speed of light.
The proton bunches reside in rear halves of the bubbles and are almost half
a period long. The bunches completely fill decelerating phases of the wave
(Fig. 4.3a) and nevertheless stably propagate along the channel over a long dis-
tance (Fig. 4.3e), which indicates that the bunches are strongly focused. This
contrasts to wave characteristics in uniform plasmas, where regions of simulta-
neous deceleration and focusing are as short as a quarter of the wave period for
low-amplitude waves [35] and even shorter for nonlinear waves and positively

in nonlinear regime
charged beams [10, 162]. Unique focusing ability of the nonlinear proton-driven
wave is attributed to the basin-like radial profile of the wakefield potential in the
channel (Fig. 4.3d, Fig. 4.4), i.e., the potential drops with the decreasing radius
within the channel (Fig. 4.4d). In turn, this particular potential structure appears
as protons experience a negative (focusing) or zero radial force all through the
channel (Fig. 4.3c). Regions of strong defocusing force, which are necessary for
potential oscillations and excitation of longitudinal fields, are located outside the
channel and thus have no effect on the proton bunches.

where p2r/(2b) denotes the transverse kinetic energy of a proton (pr is its radial
momentum and b is its relativistic factor), and (r, ) represents the potential
energy difference between the value at the proton position and the maximum
value along the radius (at the basin edge). If Wt > 0, the proton has enough
kinetic energy to escape from the potential well. Otherwise it stays in the well,
that is, inside the channel. Most of driver protons have Wt < 0 all the interaction
time (red dots in Fig. 4.4). More than 90% of protons in total survive over 150 m
(Fig. 4.5). Small proton loss occurs at the boundary areas between positive and
negative potentials, where the magnitude of (r, ) is very small due to the lack
of plasma electrons inside the channel (like the green line in Fig. 4.4d). This loss
can also be observed in Fig. 4.3e where a narrow slice of protons escapes out of
the hollow channel. Another reason for the observed proton loss is unphysical and
related to the final width of the simulation window. There is no plasma focusing
at the head of the first bunch, so the protons perform large radial oscillations
under the weak focusing of external quadrupoles (Fig. 4.6a). Some of the protons
exit the simulation window radially and are counted as lost in Fig. 4.5. In our
case, protons in the first bunch being excluded this way account for 2.8% of the
total driver charge.

bunch, respectively.

Figure 4.6: Trajectories of protons initially located at the head (a) and back
(b) of the first driving bunch and at the front (c) of the seventh driving bunch
and the trajectory of the witness electron (d).
Protons at the back of the first bunch experience stronger plasma focusing,
thus oscillating with a higher betatron frequency and within the hollow channel
(Fig. 4.6b) in comparison with the head protons. Fig. 4.6c gives the trajectory
of a proton in the seventh bunch initially located in a fairly deep potential well.
As a result, the proton oscillates well within 200m with a even higher betatron
frequency. It is worth pointing out that the oscillation period changes insignif-
icantly with the propagation distance in each proton case as the proton energy
(or the relativistic factor) drops moderately.
4.3 Simulations of the proposed regime
4.3.3 Acceleration characteristics of the witness bunch
The witness electron bunch is placed in the bubble behind the last proton bunch
(Fig. 4.3). The maximum accelerating gradient in the witness beam region is
4.4 GeV/m, which constitutes 60% of the wave-breaking field for the surrounding
plasma. The witness is only focused by the quadrupoles which keep its radius
small and prevent it from being defocused by the plasma electrons staying in larger
radii. Therefore, in our studied scheme, long intervals of proper focusing for the
positively charged driver and for the electron witness beam coexist. The electron
bunch is initially placed behind the peak accelerating field (see Fig. 4.3a) so that
it can stay in the accelerating phase for a long distance. But the accelerating field
initially has a negative slope, which leads to a large increase of the energy spread.
When the bunch slips into the accelerating region with a positive field slope due
to the backward shift of the wake phase, the energy spread decreases. After
being accelerated over 150 m, the witness bunch reaches an energy of 0.47 TeV
with an energy spread as low as 1.3% (Fig. 4.7a). The normalized emittance
of the witness bunch stays at the initial level of 2 mm mrad over this distance
(Fig. 4.7b). After that the witness beam quality starts to degrade because the
depleted driver bunches change their shapes, which causes mismatch of the wave

and the bunch train, penetration of plasma electrons into the witness beam region,
and defocusing of witness electrons.
The trajectory of a witness electron is shown in Fig. 4.6d. The electron oscil-
lates within 10m, and the oscillation period increases as the energy grows. Since
witness electrons only experience weak quadrupole focusing and the amplitude
and frequency of betatron oscillations are small, the betatron radiation can be
foreseen to be modest.
4.4 Discussions
4.4.1 Parametric relation between the beam and plasma
To attain high energy gain and high beam quality of the witness bunch in the
proposed scheme, four parameters, i.e., plasma skin depth, driver radius, hol-
low channel radius and bunch period, need to have proper relative scale factors.
Numerical optimization suggests that these parameters should form a ratio of
1 : 1 : 3 : 3. This result was obtained with simulations and currently lacks a
complete theoretical justification as no purely analytical model can predict the
outcome as of today. Nevertheless, we present several considerations to back up
this result.
First, the driver period must match the wake period to resonantly excite strong
wakefields. Given a plasma density, the wake period depends on the channel
radius. In our case it is 1.5 times longer than the wavelength in the uniform
surrounding plasma. In turn, for a given period of the bunches, more (less) dense
plasma should accompany the choice of a larger (smaller) channel radius. For a
train of N bunches, the period mismatch should be below 1/N, which is 10% in
our case. Simulations confirm this estimate: channels with radii ranging from
160m to 220m and surrounding plasma densities between 5  1015 cm3 and
7  1015 cm3 work almost equally well.
4.4 Discussions
The optimal ratio between the driver radius and the hollow channel radius
comes from a compromise between the survival rate of the protons and the accel-
erating field amplitude. Reducing the channel radius to 160m (by 20%) while
decreasing the plasma density to keep the resonance leads to the loss of 25%
more protons (Fig. 4.8a). Although the accelerating gradient is initially enlarged
by 42% (Fig. 4.8b), it only lasts for a very short distance and decreases quickly
with proton loss. This is because protons in large radii out of the hollow bound-
ary easily escape due to positive radial wakefields. When increasing the channel
radius to 240m, we obtain a survival rate as high as 95% (Fig. 4.8a), but the
gradient decreases considerably (Fig. 4.8b).
Figure 4.8: Driver survival rates (a) and maximum longitudinal wakefield am-
plitudes (b) for different plasma structures. Each case is denoted by the identi-
cally colored lines in (a) and (b). To avoid contributions from field singularities
(Fig. 4.3a) into the wakefield amplitudes, the on-axis electric field Ez is first in-
tegrated along  and then multiplied by the wake wavenumber and averaged in
wide (1 m) intervals in z.
The optimal ratio between the plasma skin depth and hollow channel radius
aims at providing a strong wakefield on the axis, presence of plasma electrons
in most cross-sections of the channel, and availability of plasma electron-free
bubbles for hosting the witness bunch. This ratio depends on the charge of driver
bunches and needs to be adjusted for each particular driver. If the plasma density
is lower than the optimal one and the skin-depth (or the plasma wavelength)
is longer (Fig. 4.9a), the driver charge increases as the bunch length extends.
Chapter 4: Multiple proton bunch driven hollow plasma wakefield acceleration
in nonlinear regime
There are fewer plasma electrons in the channel, which is unfavorable for driver
focusing. Hence, a large quantity of protons get lost, which subsequently destroys
the accelerating field (Figs. 4.9b-c). On the other hand, if the plasma density is
higher, the bubble structure disappears, bunch contributions stop adding up, and
the accelerating field diminishes (Figs. 4.9d-f).

channel radius, and peak driver density are the same as in the baseline variant;
the driver period is adjusted to match the wake period, so is the bunch length.
The red dash-dotted lines in (b) and (e) denote the hollow channel boundary.
4.4 Discussions
4.4.2 Effect of plasma density inhomogeneity on acceler-
ation
To get a deeper insight into the effect of channel density inhomogeneity, we in-
troduce a perturbation to the density of the surrounding plasma as
n = n0(1 + n sin(2z/L), (4.3)
where n0 = 6  1015 cm3 is the baseline plasma density, n is the perturbation
amplitude and L is the perturbation period. The wakefield characteristics in
different cases (L = 0.1 m, 1 m and n = 0.5%, 2.5%, 5%) are illustrated in
Fig. 4.10. In addition, an irregular density non-uniformity following the form
n = n0(1 + 0.025(1 cos(
)) + 0.015 sin(
) + 0.015 sin(
)) (4.4)
is introduced to further validate the proposed scheme.
The conclusions drawn from Fig. 4.10 are fourfold. First of all, the proposed
scheme can tolerate a regular density perturbation up to a level of 5% and is
slightly more sensitive to the irregular perturbation (Fig. 4.10b). Second, the os-
cillations of the maximum longitudinal wakefields follow the perturbation periods
(Fig. 4.10a) and reducing the periods below the proton oscillation period can sig-
nificantly boost the average wakefield amplitudes (the green line in Fig. 4.10b).
Furthermore, a rise of the plasma density generally damps the wakefields while a
drop of the plasma density increases the wakefields (Fig. 4.10a) similarly to the
uniform plasma case [163]. Last but not least, a clean accelerating region for
the witness beam remain under the plasma density perturbation discussed here
and thereby its normalized emittance is well preserved (Fig. 4.10c). As a conse-
quence, the limitation on tolerable density perturbations comes from decreasing
Chapter 4: Multiple proton bunch driven hollow plasma wakefield acceleration

the acceleration rate (Fig. 4.10d), rather than degrading the witness beam quality
as in the case of uniform plasmas [163].

4.4.3 Proton survival rate
In Sec. 4.3.2, we demonstrate that the survival rate of protons is essentially de-
termined by the relation between their radial momenta and the potential well
depth. Increasing the angular spread will cause more proton loss, as the protons
with larger angular spread have enough transverse kinetic energy to escape from
the potential well. Fig. 4.11 gives a quantitative view of this. The normalized
emittance of the protons in the simulated case (3.5 mm mrad, with the corre-
4.5 Summary
sponding angular spread of 5  105) is typical for the state-of-the-art beams
[76, 164], thus there is no safety margin in beam emittance for our simulated
case. Therefore, the multiple proton bunches employed in the discussed scheme
are preferably generated by longitudinal modulation [152] instead of the radial
self-modulation [64, 65] from a long proton bunch. The reason behind it is that
the self-modulation gives rise to large radial momenta of the micro-bunches [70].

ferent initial angular spreads.
4.5 Summary
In summary, by employing hollow plasma we enable the operation of multiple
proton bunch driven plasma wakefield acceleration in the blowout regime. In
this scheme, up to half a wakefield period is applicable to each proton bunch
in terms of long-term and stable deceleration and maintenance, which is much
longer than in the uniform plasma. The simulations verify that up to 90% of TeV
protons from ten proton bunches survive after propagating through a plasma of
length 150 m, bringing the witness electrons to 0.47 TeV with low energy spread
(1.3%) and well-preserved normalized emittance. No strong dissipation of the
accelerating mode is observed, which enables high efficiency of multi-bunch wave
excitation. In addition, the hollow channel can sustain relatively large eigenfre-

quency fluctuations (at the level of 5%), which lowers the precision requirements

energy physics facilities.

High-quality positrons from a
multi-proton bunch driven hollow
plasma wakefield accelerator
5.1 Introduction
In Chapter 4, we have demonstrated that, by means of a hollow plasma, multiple
proton bunches work well in driving nonlinear plasma wakefields and accelerate
electrons to the energy frontier with preserved beam quality. For the future
energy frontier lepton colliders, the generation of TeV-scale positrons is equally
important. However, the acceleration of positrons is different as positrons see
a different and less favorable accelerating structure, which is strongly charge
dependent. The consequence is a discrepancy in terms of the beam quality, that
is, either a preserved normalized emittance with a high energy spread or vice
versa. This results from the conflict that the plasma electrons, used to provide
focusing to the multiple proton bunches, now dilute the positron bunch. In the
following we first explain this issue. Then we propose two intuitive approaches
which are capable of mitigating the beam quality deterioration yet to a limited

extent. Fortunately, afterwards we validate that a combined solution is able to
guarantee both high energy gain and high beam quality. Finally, we analyze the
dependent relations between the acceleration and beam and plasma parameters.
5.2 Challenges in positron acceleration
Plasma wakefield accelerators have become increasingly popular in constructing
compact and cost-effective colliders in the energy level of hundreds of GeV or
TeV [48, 165, 166] owing to the ultra-high accelerating gradient. There has been
essential progress in plasma-based electron acceleration to high energy [42] or
with high efficiency [43], but little advance for positron acceleration. The most
fundamental obstacle is the lack of a stable acceleration regime for positrons. As
seen from Fig. 5.1, in the blowout regime of plasma wakefield acceleration, the
plasma electrons are displaced off axis by the electron driver and then concentrate
in the bubble sheath. The entire rear half of the bubble which is devoid of
plasma electrons forms an ideal accelerating structure for the electron beam, i.e.,
is both uniformly accelerating and linearly focusing along the beam radius [34, 89].
However, the focusing region for positrons is substantially smaller being at the
back of the bubble (the region marked by the frame in Fig. 5.1a), where the plasma
electrons collapse on axis and the plasma density is nonuniform. Therefore, the
acceleration and focusing for positrons vary radially, which leads to the growth
of the energy spread and the emittance. Also it requires precise control of the
location of positrons [133]. In consequence, the idea in Ref. [133] of accelerating
positrons in the nonlinear wake of the electron beam is apparently challenging
[47]. Nevertheless, an encouraging experiment in 2015 [44] validated that it is
feasible to accelerate positrons at the tail by the front of the positron beam.
By sufficiently self-loading the wake, the rear of the beam sees focusing of the

5.3 Applications of hollow plasma in positron
acceleration
A hollow channel plasma was initially proposed to confine the lasers [116]. Later
it was recognized to strongly benefit the acceleration and quality of positrons
[59, 117]. Take the work in Ref. [117] for example, the hollow plasma dispels
the defocusing from the background ions and also nonlinear focusing from the
plasma electrons attracted towards the axis. In addition, the longitudinal wake-
fields become uniform transversely. The limitation is here the hollow channel
acts as a waveguide structure. It requires no plasma electrons streaming into the
channel and hence no intense drivers, which are supposed to be used for large
wakefield excitation. Ref. [59] elucidates strongly nonlinear beam-plasma inter-

actions, whereas the ultra-short and dense proton driver is hardly obtainable,
because the real proton bunch in practice is tens of cm long.
5.4 Simulation results
In Chapter 4, we exploit multiple equidistant proton bunches, which are hypo-
thetically obtained from the longitudinal modulation of a long bunch. This eases
the challenge in compressing it to one single short proton bunch. Furthermore,
the introduction of the hollow channel removes the ion defocusing to the proton
bunches. It also overcomes deterioration of the witness electron beam quality
in uniform plasma, which results from the asymmetric plasma response to the
positively charged drivers compared to their counterparts. As a consequence,
the multiple proton bunches work well in the nonlinear regime sourcing strong
plasma fields and accelerating electrons to the energy frontier with preserved
beam quality.
In this chapter, likewise we adopt multiple proton bunches as the driver along
with the indispensable parta hollow plasma channel for the nonlinear wake
excitation and validate the efficient acceleration and beam quality preservation
of the positron bunch.
5.4.1 Dilemma in preserving the beam quality
Table 5.1 displays the simulation parameters. The proton beam and plasma pa-
rameters are taken based on the same rules demonstrated in Chapter 4. To be
specific, the multiple equidistant proton bunches are presumably obtained from
a single LHC bunch by longitudinal bunch modulation, hence the population of
each proton bunch is the population of a LHC bunch divided by the number of
multiple proton bunches. The bunch energy spread is set as 10%, larger than that
of the LHC bunch as we assume a longitudinal bunch compression of the LHC
5.4 Simulation results
bunch before modulated to accommodate the need for shorter proton bunches.
The bunches are supposed to be in tune with the wakefields, the period of which
is determined by the plasma density and the channel radius. An optimal com-
bination of the plasma density and the channel radius occurs when the proton
bunches drive strong and stable wakefields. Quadrupole magnets are used to pre-
vent the head of the first proton bunch from emittance-driven erosion owing to
no or weak plasma focusing therein, and also confine the positron bunch within
a small radius. In theory, the stronger the quadrupoles, the better the focus-
ing. Here we keep them in an acceptable level considering current technologies.
More importantly, stronger quadrupoles require the initial positron energy to be
larger, otherwise the positron bunch will diverge under the quadrupole focusing.
We have discussed the constraints in Chapter 3.
The proton beam dynamics and the wake characteristics are similar to those
in Chapter 4 as well and thus not repeated here. Yet it is worth mentioning that
the proton driver and plasma channel have been carefully optimized in order to
radially enlarge the acceleration region for positrons which is free from plasma
electrons. This is essential because, as will be seen later, the positrons interfere
severely with plasma electrons penetrating near axis. Given the same reason,
the initial radius and emittance of the positron bunch are required to be small.
The positron bunch is initialized with the equilibrium radius, which is calculated
based on Ref. [57] assuming positrons are only focused by the external quadrupole
fields. The quasi-static particle-in-cell code LCODE based on the 2D cylindrical
geometry has been employed due to its high computing efficiency to conduct all
the simulations, which extend over long distances whilst maintaining a simulation
grid fine enough to resolve the positron beam.

Each proton bunch basically stays in the rear half of the bubble seeing decelerating
fields (Fig. 5.2b). The positron bunch is located within the first half of the bubble
just behind the last proton bunch (i.e., the 9th bunch), where the longitudinal field
is accelerating and radially uniform. In the initial acceleration stage (before z =
84 m), there are no plasma electrons penetrating into the positron region, which
makes the positrons only focused by the quadrupole fields. With its initial radius
matching with the focusing structure, the positron bunch is stably accelerated
with a well-preserved normalized emittance.

Chapter 5: High-quality positrons from a multi-proton bunch driven hollow
plasma wakefield accelerator
Unfortunately, the slope of the accelerating field initially seen by positrons
is positive and is not conducive to beam loading. This causes an increasing en-
ergy spread due to head positrons experiencing larger fields than the tail (see
Fig. 5.4 later). This type of region where the bunch is accelerated with the en-
ergy spread increasing is termed as Iacc. As protons have larger mass, their
relativistic factors are essentially smaller in comparison with the ultra-relativistic
positrons being further accelerated. Therefore, the protons and the wake phase
keep shifting backwards with respect to the positrons. This creates a perfect
opportunity for the positron bunch to get into the Dacc region ahead of the
maximum accelerating field. The field here has a sharp and negative slope and
could conceivably rectify the energy spread. However, this region resides in the
bubble head, where the plasma electrons stream across the axis and the plasma
density is uneven. The radial fields thus vary transversely, which is detrimental
to the beam emittance.
Ref. [59] has still taken advantage of the Dacc region. However, in this
previous study, the single short proton driver is required to be dense enough so
that an elliptical bubble nearly devoid of plasma electrons is formed behind the
driver under strongly nonlinear wake excitation. That is, the perturbed plasma
electrons move within a thin bubble sheath. In this way, a small radial space free
from plasma electrons at the bubble head is maintained for the positron bunch.
Nevertheless, it is not the case in our configuration. The multiple proton
bunches will lose focusing from the plasma electrons and diverge significantly
[168]. This in turn leads to more plasma electrons flowing in and ruining the
positron beam quality. Furthermore, with proton energy depletion and the bunch
elongation after a long distance, it is increasingly tricky to keep the plasma elec-
trons close to the bubble boundary. Fig. 5.2c foresees the positron emittance
growth from z = 84 m, when some plasma electrons get closer to the axis and the
radial clean space for positrons becomes smaller. The plasma electron trajecto-
5.4 Simulation results
ries crossing with that of positrons dilute the positron bunch. However, by then
the bunch has not reached the Dacc region (Fig. 5.2g). Overall, there is a dis-
crepancy between obtaining a small beam emittance and a small energy spread in
our studied case. Basically the positron bunch needs to get to the bubble head to
lower its energy spread gained before. Nevertheless, before that the nonuniform
plasma electrons will destroy its emittance remarkably. As a result, either the
acceleration is truncated before the beam emittance gets ruined or some measures
must be taken from this point.
5.4.2 Solution 1: plasma density decrease
Recall that the Dacc region is conducive to the decrease of the energy spread
due to the negative field slope. It follows that the Ddec region should contribute
to reducing the energy spread as well. Despite being decelerating for positrons,
this region is free from plasma electrons in a large radial space as it is located
at the rear of the bubble ahead of the positron bunch. Thus, it is expected to
be capable of conserving the beam emittance while reducing its energy spread.
Since the bunch will deteriorate if it continuously slides into the Ddec region
by means of phase dephasing, we propose to reduce the plasma density to 0.91n0
from the point when the beam emittance starts to degrade. In this way, the wake
wavelength increases and the bubble shifts backwards (Fig. 5.2d). It looks like
the positron bunch directly jumps from the front of the old bubble to the tail of
the bubble ahead (i.e., from Fig. 5.2c to Fig. 5.2d).
It is noteworthy that, while the plasma density change brings substantial
phase shift in terms of the positrons, its effect on the resonance of proton bunches
is acceptable. To be specific, the plasma wavelength  is inversely proportional
to the square root of the plasma density n, therefore the slight density decrease
n/n0 will cause the plasma wavelength to increase by /0 = 0.5n/n0 where
0 is the initial plasma wavelength. It follows that with a relative density decrease

of 9%, the wake period increases by 4.5%. This implies a negligible phase shift
with respect to the first proton bunch considering the almost half wavelength it
occupies. However, the phase shift accumulates from the first to the last bunch
and it adds up to about 0.72 plasma wavelength relative to the last bunch. As
initially the last bunch lags behind the maximum decelerating field (Fig. 5.2b),
the wake shift affects it insignificantly and most of the protons still reside in the
deceleration region.

the three proposed solutions starting at z = 84 m to reduce the energy spread
while preserving the beam emittance. Here it only shows the results for the core
positron beam.
5.4 Simulation results
Note that there is already some dilution to the positron bunch in the large
radius at the time of plasma density change. This is done deliberately to keep
the bunch longer in the initial acceleration stage with a large gradient, and it
is acceptable since the core beam (95% of positrons) is still conserved (Fig. 5.3).
Fig. 5.4 (solution 1) illustrates the evolution of the energy gain and energy spread
of the core positron bunch in the initial acceleration stage (before z = 84 m) and
the stage devoted to reducing the energy spread (after). We see that the de-
crease of the energy spread is essentially inefficient and even goes to the opposite
way after a short distance when the bunch slips out of the Ddec region. Also
it comes with a large energy gain loss. The reasons are threefold. First of all,
the plasma density change, although small, leads to less resonance of the proton
bunches. Secondly, the proton bunches deform significantly after long term de-
pletion. These result in weaker wake excitation and hence less sharp field slope
compared to the initial stage (Fig. 5.2b). Thirdly, the wake flattens more under
the beam loading and the extension of the wake period (Fig. 5.2h). Regardless,
the positron beam emittance is still preserved.
5.4.3 Solution 2: presence of the electron beam load
Since the plasma electrons are the main obstacle to the emittance preservation of
the positrons, we introduce an extra electron bunch to the bubble tail ahead of the
positron bunch (Fig. 5.2e). The electron bunch has a large population of 2  1010.
Its radial space charge force acts back on the bubble sheath electrons and delays
them from returning to the -axis. Therefore, the plasma electrons are expelled
away from the positrons and the bubble shape is altered (Fig. 5.2e). Fig. 5.2i
shows that the loading of electrons changes the wake form as well and the positron
bunch sees a flat or slightly increasing wakefield at the beginning. The negative
slope ahead is expected to shift towards the positrons after a distance. Note that
the electron bunch cannot be loaded to the decelerating field region as the energy
Chapter 5: High-quality positrons from a multi-proton bunch driven hollow
plasma wakefield accelerator
loss will lead to its quick divergence under the radial focusing of quadrupoles
[57]. Fig. 5.4 indicates that loading of electrons (solution 2) reduces the energy
spread much more efficiently compared to the plasma density change (solution
1). Another positive feature is that the positron energy increases continuously
with preserved beam emittance until it gets further into the Ddec region.
5.4.4 Solution 3: combination
The shortcoming of the second solution is when loading the electrons, the positrons
are still far away from the Dacc region and the fields seen are not effective to
reduce the energy spread. When the positron bunch arrives at the Dacc region,
the field slope by then becomes insignificant due to large energy loss to both
positrons and electrons and wake decrease. Hence, we combine the aforemen-
tioned two approaches and propose to load extra electrons while reducing the
plasma density to 0.95n0. In so doing, the positron bunch directly jumps to the
Dacc region which has a large slope (Fig. 5.2j) and meanwhile the presence of
electrons removes the interference of plasma electrons with positrons (Fig. 5.2f).
More importantly, the required electron population is 1 1010 to maintain enough
clean space for positrons. This is twice smaller than in solution 2 with only
electron loading, where the electrons are further away from the positrons due to
the requirement of staying in the accelerating field region and thus it requires
a larger number of electrons to bend the bubble shape more. In addition, the
plasma density decrease is less than in solution 1, as it only needs to shift the
Dacc region towards the positron bunch instead of the Ddec region further
ahead. As a result, more protons stay within the decelerating region.
Figure 5.4 (solution 3) demonstrates the successful decrease of the energy
spread to 1.3%. It also happens substantially quicker than the other two so-
lutions. Over 95% of positrons are kept at the initial normalized emittance (0.25
mm mrad). The net energy gain in the stage of reducing the energy spread is neg-
5.4 Simulation results
ative, which is inferior to solution 2, where the dephasing length sees accelerating
fields longer. For all solutions, the reduction of energy spread slows down when
the positron bunch approaches the maximum decelerating field in the Ddec re-
gion, whose slope is trivial or almost zero. The end of this stage corresponds
to the bunch getting out of the Ddec region, otherwise the energy spread will
increase again.
While accelerating the positrons, the electron bunch is accelerated from 10 GeV
to 150 GeV as well but its energy spread is as large as 17% because it mostly stays
in the Aacc region, where the field is accelerating but the slope is not conducive.
Its normalized emittance is well conserved in the whole process, as no plasma fo-
cusing acts on it. The further energy extraction by electrons suggests an increase
of the overall energy efficiency for this particular configuration if this electron
bunch is applicable.
By comparison, we see the most effective way to reduce the energy spread
while preserving the beam emittance is to load an extra electron bunch and
reduce the plasma density from the point when the plasma electrons start to
interfere with the positrons. Despite that, the first two proposed methods are
useful when extending to other set-ups. For example, the idea of plasma density
change could be introduced into the single electron/positron/laser beam driven
positron acceleration cases in hollow plasma, where the acceleration distance is
not long and the wake form does not change significantly. In addition, the idea of
an additional electron bunch is expected to be beneficial to the AWAKE scheme
(details will be introduced in Chapter 7). The load of an extra electron bunch can
expel the nonuniform plasma electrons away from the witness electron bunch, so
that it can be accelerated with high quality. A different use can be found in Ref.
[169], where an additional tailored escort electron beam with a very high charge
was introduced into a later phase of the electron acceleration. It overlapped with
the witness electron bunch and overloaded the plasma wave, reversing the local
Chapter 5: High-quality positrons from a multi-proton bunch driven hollow

accelerating field slope. In this way, the witness energy spread was decreased by
an order of magnitude.
5.5 Acceleration characteristics
5.5.1 Dependence on the electron population and plasma
density
In this section, we further discuss the dependence of acceleration performance
and beam quality preservation on plasma and the electron bunch in terms of the
third solution discussed in Section 5.4.4. The electron bunch is restricted to the
following conditions. First of all, the electron charge is enough to expel plasma
electrons away from the positron bunch. Second, the electron bunch resides in
the acceleration region and better exactly ahead of the zero field [like the electron
bunches in Fig. 5.2(i-j)], so that the energy extraction from protons is the least.
Given initially the same decreased plasma density of 0.95n0, Fig. 5.5 compares
three cases under different populations of electrons. The electron bunch with
larger charge resides further away from the positron bunch as more electrons
overload the wake field to zero earlier. Therefore, it leaves a longer distance
between the positron bunch and the zero field (Fig. 5.5a), i.e., a longer dephasing
length for acceleration before positrons getting into the decelerating field region.
As a result, the net energy gain of positrons for the larger electron loading case is
higher at the same distance (Fig. 5.5b). Nevertheless, the wake field slope seen by
the positron bunch is smaller and thus the energy spread drops slower (Fig. 5.5c).
It has been demonstrated that a plasma density drop to 0.95n0 shifts the
Dacc region towards the positrons. Although with a larger plasma density
the effect of phase shift on multiple proton bunches will be smaller, because
the electron bunch is further away from the positron bunch, it requires a larger
electron loading so that the space charge force is enough to repel the plasma

electrons more. Fig. 5.6 shows the cases where the larger dropped plasma density
comes with a larger electron load. Similar to the case in Fig. 5.5, the energy spread
decreases slower with a large electron load, but the net energy gain increases. Also
when comparing Fig. 5.5 and Fig. 5.6, it is apparent that with the same electron
loading, the wakefield and energy gain are promoted under a larger dropped
plasma density. This is because more protons contribute to the wake excitation
under less phase shift.
Chapter 5: High-quality positrons from a multi-proton bunch driven hollow
plasma wakefield accelerator
5.5.2 Different longitudinal plasma profiles
In Section 5.4.4, we see the net energy gain in the third solution (over the stage
of reducing energy spread) is negative because of positrons later sliding into the
Ddec region with wake phase shift. Then it is natural to think of further in-
creasing the plasma density, so that the wake wavelength decreases and the Dacc
region is shifted back to the positron bunch. Meanwhile, with a wake wavelength
decrease, the extra electron bunch is expected to move towards a smaller accel-
eration gradient and extract less energy from the plasma wave.

corresponding evolution of energy gain (b) and energy spread (c) of the positrons
being accelerated in such plasma channels. The identical colour represents the
same case. The red one corresponds to the third solution presented in section
5.4.4.
Figure 5.7 compares the cases with different longitudinal plasma profiles adopted
along with the same electron beam loading (1  1010). The red coloured case
represents the third solution discussed in Section 5.4.4. With a slight plasma
density increase from 0.95n0 to 0.96n0 (i.e., the green line in Fig. 5.7a), both the
net energy gain and the decrease rate of energy spread are promoted [Fig. 5.7(b-
5.6 Summary
c)]. Still, for a longer acceleration distance, the positrons will inevitably get into
the Ddec region again. Therefore, a more complicated plasma profile (i.e., the
blue line in Fig. 5.7a) is proposed where the plasma density increase occurs when
or after the positrons slip into the Ddec region. In this case, the positron en-
ergy increases continuously to 400 GeV, while the energy spread decreases to the
initial level of 1% or even less with a longer distance at almost the same rate.
Here the plasma with a stepped density can be realized by segmented plasma
in practice. In addition, it allows a substantial response distance to change the
plasma density, as the wake phase changes insignificantly in terms of the acceler-
ation distance. For instance, the wake only dephases by around 8.4 103c/p if
passing through a 1 m longer plasma. Further simulations prove that the density
change is not necessarily sharp and a gradual change even helps the acceleration
performance.
5.6 Summary
In this chapter, we first analyse the issues in preserving the quality of the positron
bunch while accelerating it to high energy in the multiple proton bunch driven
hollow plasma wakefield accelerator. It is difficult to maintain a small normalized
emittance and a small energy spread simultaneously. This results from the plasma
electrons which, although providing focusing to the multiple proton bunches,
dilute the positron bunch. We propose and compare three different solutions,
and find that the most efficient way is to load extra electrons and meanwhile
decrease the plasma density from the point when the positron emittance starts to
degrade. Simulations show that the positron bunch can be accelerated to 40% of
the driver energy with the energy spread as low as 1% when adopting a slightly
more sophisticated plasma profile. Its normalized emittance is well preserved
at the initial value. The electron beam charge must match the plasma density

decrease to reach the best acceleration condition. For a smaller density decrease,
the electron beam loading must be stronger.
This work expands the concept of positron acceleration driven by protons.
The obtainable high quality and high energy positrons are promising candidates
for the future energy frontier lepton colliders. In addition, the proposed ideas are
not restricted to the scheme presented here and they should find applications in
other set-ups.
Chapter 6
Assessment of misalignment
induced effects in proton driven
hollow plasma wakefield
acceleration
6.1 Introduction
Hollow plasma channel has played a key role in our former studies of proton-
driven plasma wakefield acceleration. It overcomes the issue of beam quality
degradation caused by the nonlinear transverse wakefields varying in radius and
time in uniform plasma [146]; enables the stable driving characteristics of multiple
proton bunches in the nonlinear regime [168]; and provides a quality-beneficial
and high gradient accelerating structure for the positron beam [170]. Owing to
these positive features, both the electron and positron beams have been demon-
strated in simulations to be accelerated to the energy frontier with well-preserved
beam quality in a long hollow plasma channel, which advances the development
of future TeV-scale lepton colliders.
Chapter 6: Assessment of misalignment induced effects in proton driven hollow
plasma wakefield acceleration
On the other hand, the proposed hollow channel scheme imposes a stringent
requirement on the beam-channel alignment. This is difficult in reality as random
laser jitters or other unexpected factors result in offset of either the channel
or the beam. Asymmetric and possibly strong transverse wakefields are thus
induced throughout the channel by the misaligned beam, which could deflect the
beam, leading to a significant beam loss. They also very likely jeopardise the
beam quality. All these make the beam unsuitable for the applications on the
colliders, as the resultant luminosity is reduced appreciably. In this chapter, we
demonstrate the beam and wakefield characteristics under the misalignment and
propose and assess solutions to mitigate the adverse transverse effects.
6.2 Beam-channel misalignment in the weakly
linear regime
Ref. [127] derives analytically the beam-channel misalignment where the hollow
channel acts as a waveguide, and describes the beam-breakup (BBU) instabil-
ity [171] driven by the induced transverse wakefield associated with the dipole
mode. In general, the off-axis or asymmetric beam excites the dipole mode whose
strength increases linearly with the beam offset r and strongly depends on the
channel radius. The transverse force shares the same direction as the beam offset
and thus pushes the beam further away from the axis. As the deflection force
grows in strength along the bunch, the trailing particles behind the bunch head
are driven even further, exciting the mode more. As a result, the tail particles see
the largest transverse force and are rapidly deflected towards the channel wall.
This process results in a banana shape of the bunch, which is deleterious to the
beam emittance. In addition, the growth length of the BBU instability scales
roughly linearly with the channel radius. It is essentially short, thus it limits the
beam transport in a relatively short channel. Widening the channel can extend
6.3 Beam-channel misalignment in the nonlinear regime
the length but the accelerating gradient reduces more significantly as it is roughly
inversely proportional to the square of the channel radius.
The experiment at FACET [132] measured the induced transverse wakefield
by a misaligned positron beam with respect to the hollow channel and confirmed
that the deflection of the witness beam scales linearly with the beam offset. Note
that the driving and witness bunches were originally separated from one single
bunch, thus they equally deviate from the channel. It was proposed to place
the trailing bunch precisely at the zero transverse field to mitigate the deflection
effect. But still, the issue remains and sets a tighter constraint on the alignment
accuracy for a TeV-scale energy gain. Apparently, more studies are needed to
understand the tolerances on beam offsets in the hollow channel and to explore
the applicability of the channel structure for the future collider.
In the following, we examine the induced transverse wakefield in a different and
nonlinear beam-plasma interaction regime. As it is complicated to analyse the
nonlinear wakefields analytically, we assess the resultant detrimental effects from
beam offset and tilt by means of the 2D Cartesian particle-in-cell simulations.
6.3 Beam-channel misalignment in the nonlin-
ear regime
The simulation parameters for the driving proton beam and plasma are given
in Table 6.1. We only consider the case with a single and short proton driver
for preliminary studies. x and y are the horizontal and vertical coordinates,
respectively.  = x  ct is the axial co-moving coordinate. With the open
source full relativistic code EPOCH [172] based on a 2D Cartesian geometry, we
first study the beam dynamics of an initially offset or tilted proton driver with
respect to the hollow channel axis and then demonstrate how the beam-channel
misalignment affects the wakefields in the accelerating region for the witness

the one employing a near-hollow plasma structure to confine the deflected witness
bunch.

6.3.1 Beam dynamics of the misaligned proton driver
Fig. 6.1 displays three cases under consideration where the proton driver initially
has different states: normal (taken as the baseline, Fig. 6.1a), with a positive
y offset (y) of 50 m (Fig. 6.1d), with an anti-clockwise and linear tilt angle
() of /12 (Fig. 6.1g). In the normal case without beam-channel misalignment,
the proton bunch is free from the ion defocusing within the hollow channel and
strongly confined by plasma electrons concentrated at the channel boundaries
(Fig. 6.1b-c), which form a reflecting-wall like focusing structure (i.e., a deep
potential well as shown in Fig. 6.2b).
The misalignment of the proton driver results in asymmetric plasma electron
density perturbation along the axis. For a positive beam-channel offset of 50 m,
plasma electrons concentrate more at the upper sheath of the first bubble (see the
cyan areas out of the first bubble in Fig. 6.1e), where there is a higher peak density
in comparison with the baseline case (Fig. 6.2a). The peak density at the other
side of the bubble is obviously smaller. The uneven bubble density distribution
leads to asymmetry of the transverse plasma wakefields (Fig. 6.1f), which will
6.3 Beam-channel misalignment in the nonlinear regime
apparently alter the transverse evolution of the proton bunch. From Figs. 6.2(b-
c), we see the bottom of the potential well at the proton beam is slightly inclined
pointing to the same direction of the beam offset. It suggests that the protons
within the channel tend to accumulate to the upper side of the bubble and thus
the beam centroid gradually moves along the positive y direction. In addition,
the potential well is getting shallow with the propagation distance (Figs. 6.2c),
which is the same as the baseline case. This is because the driver hasnt reached
the equilibrium state in the short simulation length.

tribution (3rd column) along with the on-axis longitudinal electric field (black

considered cases. The red and blue vertical dashed lines indicate the longitudinal
centres of the driver and the witness electron bunch, respectively. The green hor-
izontal dashed line along y = 0 marks the longitudinal axis while the other two
off-axis ones mark the hollow channel boundaries. Note the differences between
the plasma electron density distribution marked in the square frames in (b), (e)
and (h).
Chapter 6: Assessment of misalignment induced effects in proton driven hollow
plasma wakefield acceleration
In the tilted driver case, we deliberately pick up an anti-clockwise tilt to create
a plasma density perturbation in an opposite way (Fig. 6.2a). More specifically,
the plasma density has a larger peak density at the down sheath of the bubble
(Fig. 6.1h) and the potential well bottom is oblique towards the negative y direc-
tion (Figs. 6.2b and 6.2d). In comparison with the beam offset case, the beam
tilt changes the wake potential more significantly.
Figure 6.2: Plasma electron densities (a) and wake potentials (b) measured
along the longitudinal centre of the driver (the red vertical dashed line in Fig. 6.1)
at the propagation distance of 0.5 m for different cases. The same coloured lines in
(a) and (b) denote the same case. Here we include two more cases to enhance the
contrast: one is with a larger beam offset (y2 = 100 m) and the other is with
a larger tilt angle (2 = /6). Wake potentials measured along the longitudinal
centre of the driver at different distances are shown for the case y1 = 50 m (c)
and 1 = /12 (d).
Based on the above discussion, we can conclude that without the defocusing
plasma ions within the hollow channel, the proton driver is strongly confined
within a deep potential well. Therefore, it is capable of sustaining a relatively
large offset (100 m) or tilt (/6) without drastic distortion of the beam shape
or causing beam hosing. Here we only simulate the cases for 1.0 m limited by
6.3 Beam-channel misalignment in the nonlinear regime
the computing resources. Simulations for a much longer distance are important
to determine whether the bunch centroid deviates observably after a long-term
particle accumulation towards one direction. In that case, the bunch might get
out of the potential well.
6.3.2 Wakefield characteristics in the witness region
In this section, we focus on the wakefield characteristics in the second bubble
where the witness electron bunch can be accelerated. Note that the electron bunch
is not introduced in all simulations, as there is no quadrupole module adopted in
the simulation configuration. The electron bunch if injected will radially diverge
even in the baseline case as there is no transverse plasma focusing [146, 168]. We
assume that the electron bunch misaligned or not has insignificant effect on the
plasma bubble, thus the beam dynamics of the electron beam can be estimated
based on the wakefield characteristics.
Fig. 6.3a indicates that the driven accelerating gradient at the witness bunch
decreases considerably with the beam tilt as which equivalently extends the beam
length (Fig. 6.1g). The plots in the second column of Fig. 6.1 show that the offset
or tilt of the driving bunch causes less asymmetry of the second bubble as it is
located further away from the driver in comparison with the first bubble. Due
to uneven plasma electron density distribution, the transverse wakefield in the
vicinity of a potential witness bunch becomes negative (for the beam offset case)
or positive (for the beam tilt case) instead of zero along the radius (Fig. 6.3b).
Neglecting the calculation noises, the transverse field is uniform along the radius,
which is similar to that in the linear regime [127]. The non-zero transverse field
therefore will deflect the witness electrons if located. Take the case of beam offset
y1 = 50m for instance, the transverse plasma wakefield is around 15 MV/m.
Fig. 6.3c gives the wake potential along the radius at the witness bunch where
the channel density distribution possibly varied by the witness bunch is assumed
Chapter 6: Assessment of misalignment induced effects in proton driven hollow
plasma wakefield acceleration

tance (a), transverse plasma wakefields along the radius (b) and wake potentials

cases at the propagation distance of 1.0 m. The inset in (b) displays the plot in
a large range. The same coloured lines denote the same case.
negligible. When the driver is perfectly aligned on axis, the witness bunch see
a flat potential bottom. This is exactly consistent with zero transverse plasma
field. In practice, the witness bunch is stably focused by the quadrupoles fields.
Nonetheless, with beam offset or tilt, the witness bunch is located in a region
where the potential is radially oblique. As a result, the witness bunch will be
pushed by the transverse plasma wakefields towards the positive (negative) y
direction until it gets out of the accelerating bubble for the driver offset (tilt)
case.
6.3.3 Mitigation of the transverse deflection
Based on the results above, we can conclude that the proton driver is robust to
the misalignment due to the strong focusing formed at the channel wall, while
6.3 Beam-channel misalignment in the nonlinear regime
the witness bunch is easily deflected by the transverse field induced as it initially
has no plasma focusing. In this section we propose three solutions to potentially
confine the witness bunch.
The first solution is to place the witness bunch closer to the driver so that
it resides in the accelerating region where there is strong focusing at the hollow
boundaries (the red regions at  [-2.5 mm -1.5 mm] in Figs. 6.1c, 6.1f, and 6.1i).
In so doing, the witness bunch can be strongly confined within the wide channel
regardless of the initial driver offset or tilt. The down side is the beam emittance
might be significantly disrupted while being continuously reflected by the channel
boundaries.
The second solution is to add enough quadrupole focusing to the witness
bunch. The issue is, the deflecting wakefield that needs to be compensated is
much stronger than the focusing that the state-of-the-art quadrupoles can pro-
vide, which operates at a magnetic field gradient of about 100 T/m. For example,
it requires a magnetic gradient of 1  103 T/m to compensate a deflecting wake-
field of 15 MV/m at a radius of 50m (normally the size of a witness electron
beam).
Given the limitations of the first two methods, we further propose to intro-
duce a near-hollow plasma structure to replace the hollow channel. The concept
of near-hollow plasma was initially proposed to separate the focusing and acceler-
ating of the accelerated bunch and alleviate its emittance growth due to Coulomb
scattering [119]. It assumes a lower density (nin) plasma within the channel sur-
rounded by a high density (ne) plasma in the annulus. In general, while plasma
ions located within the channel provide focusing for the witness bunch, a low
witness beam emittance is still obtainable as the transverse plasma focusing is
weak. In theory, the focusing electric field generated by the uniform plasma ions
follows the equation
y, (6.1)
Chapter 6: Assessment of misalignment induced effects in proton driven hollow
plasma wakefield acceleration
where n0 is the ion density within the channel and 0 is the vacuum permittivity.
Assuming the witness bunch radius is 50 m, to get an ion focusing which can
compensate the deflecting radial field (15 MV/m) at the witness bunch caused
by a driver offset of 50 m, the plasma density nin within the channel is around
3  1013 cm3, which is approximately 0.1ne.
Figure 6.4: Wake potentials at the longitudinal centers of the witness bunch
(a) and the proton bunch (b) for different propagation distances for the case
y1 = 50 m, nin = 0.1ne.
Fig. 6.4a demonstrates that by employing a near-hollow plasma where nin =
0.1ne, a local potential well at the witness bunch is created. The well depth is
2.5 kV from the lower well edge. As a result, the witness particle can be con-
fined under the driver misalignment, provided that its transverse kinetic energy
is smaller than 2.5 keV. It corresponds to an angular spread of 7  104 for a
10 GeV bunch, which allows for a large margin of the beam emittance for the
witness bunch. More importantly, the potential well gets increasingly deep with
the propagation distance, indicating an increasingly strong focusing for the wit-
ness bunch. Note that, while the plasma ions within the channel provide focusing
for the witness electrons, they are defocusing for the proton driver. Regardless,
Fig. 6.4b shows a even deeper potential well, indicating strong proton focusing.
This is due to more contribution from the additionally introduced plasma elec-
trons by the near-hollow plasma. In addition, the lowest potential at the proton
6.4 Summary
bunch resides almost on the axis, which mitigates the proton accumulation to-
wards a specific direction.
Figure 6.5: Wake potentials at the longitudinal center of the witness bunch for
different cases when the driver travels for 0.5 m.
Fig. 6.5 includes the case when nin = 0.01ne for comparison. We see that
the resulting wake potential is similarly oblique as the beam offset case in purely
hollow plasma. The reason is, apart from plasma ions, the near-hollow plasma
also introduces extra plasma electrons initially located within the channel. These
plasma electrons participate in the wake excitation as well, so the perturbed
plasma density difference between two sides of the bubble brings additional defo-
cusing wakefields to the witness bunch, which counteracts the focusing from the
plasma ions within the channel.
6.4 Summary
In this chapter, we have demonstrated some preliminary simulation results re-
garding the initially offset or tilted proton bunch traveling in the hollow plasma.
The proton bunch itself is less sensitive to the initial misalignment as it has strong
focusing from the hollow channel, while the induced asymmetric transverse fields
deflect the witness bunch and result in particle loss. Potential solutions are
varying the loading position of the witness bunch, adding strong quadrupoles,

and adopting a near-hollow plasma, which is the most effective one and is also
promising to conserve the witness quality. Nevertheless, the tolerance on the
beam-channel misalignment in the hollow channel for a long distance is not clear
yet. A quasi-static PIC code based on a 2D plane geometry or a 3D geometry is
feasible to simulate the long term cases to get more understandings and to further
determine whether the hollow structure is suitable for future applications.
Chapter 7
Self-modulated long proton
bunch driven plasma wakefield
acceleration
7.1 Introduction
In previous chapters, we either study the short proton bunch or the equidistant
short proton bunch trains which are assumed to be obtained from longitudinal
modulation of a long proton bunch. In this chapter, we focus on the long pro-
ton bunch and the seeded self-modulation which transforms the long bunch into
a train of micro-bunches and enables the resonant wakefield excitation. We in-
troduce the collaborative project  AWAKE experiment, which is based on the
concept of seeded self-modulation. Given the significant decrease of the phase
velocity of the self-modulated wakefields and proton loss, we propose to use a
specially tapered plasma profile to promote the wakefield amplitude and validate
its effect in simulations.
Chapter 7: Self-modulated long proton bunch driven plasma wakefield
acceleration
7.2 Physics in self-modulated plasma wakefield
acceleration
7.2.1 Concept of seeded self-modulation
The concept of proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration is compelling due
to the ability of plasmas to sustain strong accelerating fields and the ability of
proton bunches to power these fields over long distances. Successful exploitation
of this concept assumes the proton bunch to be as short as hundreds of m
[58, 59, 146], while currently producible ones are dozens of cm long. This is
orders of magnitude longer than the plasma wavelengths of interest, which makes
strong wake excitation virtually impossible. Take the SPS bunch (z = 12 cm,
r = 200m) for example, to satisfy kpz 
2, the plasma density np is as
low as 4  109 cm3 and the corresponding wave-breaking field is only several
MV/m, which is trivial for wakefield acceleration.
Given the challenges in compressing the proton bunches in a large scale, sci-
entists turn to a new way to deal with this issue. In 2010, Kumar et al. [65]
proposed the seeded self-modulation (SSM) of the long proton beam, whose con-
cept is very much like the self-modulated LWFA [12, 13]. To be specific, when
a long proton bunch propagates in the plasma, it generates a weak plasma wave
within its body. The transverse wave field ripples the bunch itself, which further
promotes the wave amplitude. With the positive loop, the periodically focusing
and defocusing forces gradually modulate the long bunch into many equidistant
micro-bunches which are one plasma wavelength apart. Strong wakefields are
excited accordingly.
In principle, the axisymmetric self-modulation instability (SMI) starts from
the noises, i.e., a low amplitude plasma wave, which is calculated to be in the
order of 10 kV/m [173]. Likewise, the competing non-axisymmetric instabilities
like the hosing instability also arises from noises and is very likely to destroy the
7.2 Physics in self-modulated plasma wakefield acceleration
beam and the plasma wave. Fortunately, with proper seeding (that is, by creating
an initial wakefield with the amplitude larger than that of the undesired noises),
the SMI mode grows quickly and suppresses the destructible modes significantly
[7173]. As a result, the SSM enables the micro-bunching and applicability of the
long proton bunch in the PWFA scope. The seeding options include introducing
a short electron bunch [173] or a short laser pulse [174] preceding the proton
bunch, creating a sharp cut in the beam current profile [82], and introducing
an ionization co-propagating laser in the middle of the proton bunch, which is
followed by the AWAKE (Advanced Wakefield) experiment demonstrated later.
Several related experiments with long or pre-bunched electron beams [8185, 87,
175] are proposed or conducted to enhance the understandings of the SMI and
resonantly driven waves.
As the long proton bunch sees many periods of longitudinal accelerating and
decelerating wakefields during the development of SSM, it is natural to suspect if
the longitudinal motion of the protons dominates the beam modulation. We can
estimate the longitudinal dynamics of protons in the bunch as the proton velocity
spread multiplied by the propagation time, that is,
v = L = L
, (7.1)
where L is the propagation distance, v is the proton velocity and  is the rela-
tivistic factor. Take the AWAKE parameters for example, the energy spread in
the proton beam increases to roughly 1.25% (5 GeV out of 400 GeV) from ini-
tial 0.35% after traveling through 10 m plasma, assuming the field gradient is
 0.5 GV/m. The proton longitudinal motion is thus around 0.8m, which is
apparently negligible. z comparable to the plasma skin depth of 0.2 mm only
happens when the propagation distance is around 160 m. However, the electron
acceleration stops much earlier, because the acceleration distance (67 m calcu-
Chapter 7: Self-modulated long proton bunch driven plasma wakefield
acceleration
lated based on Section 3.2.2) is much shorter due to electron dephasing with
respect to the wakefield. As a consequence, the micro-bunching in our studied
scope is a transverse process. It is the transverse forces of the wakefield do the
micro-bunching rather than the energy modulation coupled with the longitudinal
motion.
7.2.2 Phase velocity of the self-modulated wakefield
Since the self-modulation instability occurs and grows through the coupling be-
tween the transverse wakefields and the radial envelope of the long beam, the
properties of the self-modulated wakefields are largely affected by the beam-
plasma dynamics.
In the linear regime, within the framework of the beam envelope evolution,
the growth rate of the SSM can be described as [176, 177]
2nembb
, (7.2)
where p =
4nee2/me is the overdense plasma frequency, the quantities with
the subscript b denote the variables for the proton beam, and the co-moving
position variable is  = vbt  z where vb = c
1 2b . The growth rate scales
as   n1/6e  Q1/3, where Q is the proton beam charge. As a result, the growth
rate of SSM increases with the plasma density and the beam population, but
decreases with the beam propagation (i.e., with increasing ct). In addition, the
SSM grows from the bunch head to the tail (i.e., with increasing ).
The phase velocity of the wakefield is
vph = vb
2nembb
)1/3]
, (7.3)
which is closely connected to the growth rate of the self-modulation instability.
We see the wake phase velocity can be significantly smaller than the beam velocity
7.2 Physics in self-modulated plasma wakefield acceleration
during the development of SSM and it is expected to be approaching the beam
velocity when the instability saturates ( = 0). Ref. [177] simulated the case with
a 450 GeV SPS bunch and the relativistic factor of the lowest wake phase velocity
is ph = (1 v2ph/c2)1/2  38, which is one order of magnitude smaller than the
-factor of the drive proton bunch.
The large wake phase slowdown or backward phase shift forces a large number
of protons from the focusing regions into the defocusing regions, which results in
dramatic proton loss and wake amplitude decrease after reaching the peak [63,
68, 70]. In addition, it is deleterious to the trapping and acceleration of witness
electrons. To be specific, the beam energy gain is subject to the dephasing length
Ld, which corresponds to a phase shift of half plasma wavelength. Assuming the
accelerated electron has a velocity close to c, it gives (1  vph/c)Ld = p/2, i.e.,
Ld ' 2php. Hence the energy gain is W ' eEmLd ' 22ph(Em/Ewb)mec2,
where Em is the maximum accelerating field seen by the electron bunch and Ewb
is the wave-breaking field. Since Em  Ewb and ph is low, the obtainable energy
gain is very limited. Another adverse effect of the wake phase shift is the electrons
get scattered when they slip from a focusing phase to a defocusing one.
The issue on the witness electron bunch can be avoided by side injection [177
179]. In that scenario, low energy electrons are side-injected with a small angle
and they reach the driver axis slightly before the instability saturates. Then they
are sucked in the wake by the transverse fields and scheduled into the accelerating
and focusing region. Another approach is to use two plasma stages so that the
long proton bunch gets self-modulated until the instability saturates in the first
stage and then the electron bunch is injected into the second stage for acceleration.
This concept has been employed in the design for the AWAKE Run 2.

7.3 AWAKE experiment at CERN
AWAKE experiment [51, 7476, 145, 180, 181] is a proof-of-principle experiment
dedicated to studying the plasma wakefield excitation and electron acceleration
driven by the long proton beam, which is provided by the SPS. It is the worlds
first proton driven PWFA experiment and currently being conducted at CERN.
The potential of proton driven PWFA was initially discussed in 2009 at CERN and
the first AWAKE collaboration was officially formed in 2012. AWAKE is under
actively collaborative study by initially over 50 scientists from 13 institutes. Now
the collaboration has expanded to over a hundred scientists from 22 institutes
and it keeps attracting more expertise contributed to it. Phase1:Understandthe%physics%of%self<modulaEon%instability.

The AWAKE experiment was approved in 2013. The schematic layout of the
first run is shown in Fig. 7.1, with the proton bunch from the SPS as the driver
and the electron bunch from the RF gun to be accelerated. A laser pulse used
to ionizing the rubidium vapour into plasma co-propagates with the long proton
bunch, starting in its middle. In this scenario, only the rear half of the bunch with
a sharp-cutting front edge propagates in the plasma, hence the self-modulation
is strongly seeded to ensure a stable micro-bunching (see Fig. 7.2). The goal for
Run 1 is to demonstrate a GeV scale electron acceleration.
The planning for the AWAKE experiment is shown in Fig. 7.3. It starts from
the baseline studies (with parameters given in Table 7.1), design, civil engineering,
fabrication and installation all through the years till 2016. After commissioning

the theory. Specifically, the defocusing of protons measured by two distinct beam
screens (BTV) confirm that the transverse wakefields are responsible for the self-
modulation. The increasing defocusing of the protons along the bunch and along

accelerating wakefields with externally injected electrons. The published work
[79] shows a successful acceleration of electrons to 2 GeV over a 10 m long plasma.
Although this experiment is still in an early stage, it validates the potential of
this technique to generate very high energy electrons in a single plasma stage,
which is an important step towards the development of future energy frontier
particle accelerators.

Because the seeded self-modulation develops in the first several meters of
plasma, it has been suggested to use two separate plasma cells (Fig. 7.4) to op-
timize the acceleration process. The first plasma cell is used exclusively for the
beam self-modulation until it saturates and establishment of the wakefields. Then
7.4 Amplitude enhancement of the self-modulated plasma wakefields
a shorter and higher energy electron beam in comparison with that in Run 1 is
injected into the second cell for acceleration. Since the wake phase becomes sta-
ble in the second cell, it is easier to precisely control the electron beam within an
accelerating and focusing phase. This proposal has been submitted as AWAKE
Run 2 which aims at obtaining tens of GeV electron bunch with high beam qual-
ity driven by a compressed SPS bunch. It will take place after the long shut-down
of the LHC.
Future experiments will include ultra-short electron bunches to cope with ac-
celerator related issues. In a longer term, the realization of short proton bunches
will enable the wakefields driven free from SMI and make it promising to accel-
erate electrons to the energy frontier.
7.4 Amplitude enhancement of the self-modulated
plasma wakefields
As the wake phase velocity decreases significantly before the self-modulation sat-
urates, it has been proposed to alter the longitudinal plasma profile to control
the development of SSM [63, 68, 70, 182, 183]. That is, a plasma density increase
is introduced to reduce the local plasma wavelength so that the backward phase
shift can be compensated. The plasma wakefield amplitude has been promoted,
but suboptimally [70]. In this section, we accommodate the need for more compli-
cated plasma density profiles and propose a new plasma shape which can further
boost the wakefield.
It is worth pointing out that the plasma tapers are different from the plasma
density fluctuations [163]. Such plasma inhomogeneity leads to the phase dif-
ference between the long modulated proton driver or the witness bunch and the
plasma wave. It could destroy the accelerated bunch in the defocusing region.
But it has been proved to have little effect on SSM.

7.4.1 Baseline
With LCODE based on a 2D cylindrical geometry, we first simulate a twice
shorter proton beam as compared to the baseline AWAKE scenario [76]. This
beam length is envisaged for AWAKE upgrades (Table 7.2). The beam propagates
in z-direction (to the right in Fig. 7.5a). Only the rear half that propagates in
plasma is simulated, starting with an abrupt cut, so as to mimic SSM seeding
by the ionization front. With periodic focusing and defocusing transverse forces
excited (i.e., negative and positive wakefield potentials shown by green lines),
some protons are confined (marked as red points) and others diverge (marked
black). In this way, the long bunch is chopped into many micro-bunches.

Ideally, the micro-bunches are approximately p = 2c/p apart, where
4n0e2/me is the plasma frequency, and other notations are common.
Each bunch occupies p/4, corresponding to both decelerating and focusing re-
gion. However, before the micro-bunching, the wake potential near the bunch
head has larger regions with negative values than with positive ones [184]. From
Figs. 7.5b and 7.5c, we see protons along   [2, 0] are focused and located in
the negative potential region. Therefore, the first micro-bunch occupies almost a
full wave period after self-modulation and shifts the wave phase back by almost
2.5c/p with respect to the initial perturbation (Fig. 7.5d). Note that the non-

cusing regions and get lost because of the significant backward phase shift. Take
the 20th micro-bunch for instance (Fig. 7.5e), we see only 2% of protons survived
(Fig. 7.6). Without doubt, the wakefield drops drastically with such huge proton
loss (Fig. 7.7a).
7.4.2 Plasma profiling
Since the drastic phase shift is the main issue hindering strong wake excitation
based on SSM, researchers have proposed two typical types of longitudinal plasma
density profiles: density step-up [noted as case 1, Fig. 7.8(a1)] and linear density
transition [noted as case 2, Fig. 7.8(b1)]. Increase of the plasma density reduces
the local plasma wavelength and thus brings forward the back shifted phase.
With the same proton beam parameters given in Table 7.2 and the same initial
plasma density, we first sort out the optimum plasma density profile for each case.
Optimum here corresponds to the highest established wake amplitude that we
measure at z = 30 m. For the case 1, the relative plasma density increases
steeply by 4.5% at z = 1.6 m. The optimum linear transition corresponds to 6%
density increase in the interval from z = 0.2 m to z = 2.2 m. Fig. 7.7a confirms a
substantial enhancement of the wake amplitudes by these two plasma profiles.

the first potential zero (b) versus the propagation distance for all discussed cases
and their close-ups at the initial distance (c) and (d). The curves of the same
colour in top and bottom plots represent the same case.
Here we propose a third plasma density profile. It features an early and
steep density increase immediately followed by a linear transition, as shown in
Fig. 7.8(c1). The optimum set-up is to increase the density steeply by 1.5% after
0.2 m and then linearly until 13.5% in 2 m. It resembles a simple combination
of the first two cases but is capable of further enhancing the wake amplitude by
about 30% (Fig. 7.7a).
The underlying reasons for the wakefield enhancement are twofold. First of
all, introducing a small and sharp increase in the early stage can correct the
phase shift more effectively. Fig. 7.7d demonstrates that the initial phase correc-
tion (1) in our proposed case (black curve) is much larger than the one (2)
produced by the later steep density increase of a larger (6%) value (case 1, green

curve). Likewise, the linear density increase, although acting the same early
(from z = 0.2 m), contributes less to the phase correction (case 2, blue curve).
Another reason is, in our proposed case, the wakefield stays low during a long
time (Fig. 7.7c). As a result, SSM development slows down, and protons experi-
ence smaller transverse forces in the early stage, thus gaining smaller transverse
momenta [Fig. 7.8(c2)] than in other two cases [Figs. 7.8(a2) and 7.8(b2)]. Con-
sequently, fewer protons have enough transverse momentum to escape from the
potential well during micro-bunching. This is especially important for protons
near the boundaries between positive and negative potentials, where the poten-
tial well is pretty shallow. We see a larger proton concentration near the axis
and within the focusing and decelerating region [Fig. 7.8(c3)], which is favorable
for wake excitation. As for the other two cases, protons located in the vicinity

of zero potentials escape easily [marked black in Figs. 7.8(a3) and 7.8(b3)]. This
is further confirmed by the micro-bunch density in Fig. 7.8(c4) being observably
higher than in the other two cases [Figs. 7.8(a4) and 7.8(b4)].
Figure 7.6 gives a quantitative measure of the proton loss in the 20th micro-
bunch for the discussed cases. In our proposed case, 24% of protons survive,
which approaches the ideal value of 25% (quarter-period). For the first two cases,
the survival rate is 16%. Also protons in these cases get lost quicker.
7.5 Summary
Seeded self-modulation has been demonstrated to transform a long proton bunch
into many equidistant micro-bunches (e.g., the AWAKE case), which then res-
onantly excite strong wakefields. However, the wakefields in a uniform plasma
suffer from a quick amplitude drop after reaching the peak. This is caused by a
significant decrease of the wake phase velocity during self-modulation. A large
number of protons slip out of focusing and decelerating regions and get lost, and
thus cannot contribute to the wakefield growth. Previously suggested solutions
incorporate a sharp or a linear plasma longitudinal density increase which can
compensate the backward phase shift and therefore enhance the wakefields. In
this chapter, we propose and investigate a slightly more complicated plasma pro-
file. The main idea is to slow down the seeded self-modulation in the early stage,
so that protons gain smaller transverse momenta while being bunched and es-
cape less from the potential wells, especially near micro-bunch boundaries. More
protons are therefore kept within the favorable focusing and decelerating region
of the wave. Simulations illustrate that this new profile enables further boost of
the wakefield amplitude by 30%, and 24% of the initial beam charge remains in
the micro-bunches.
Chapter 8
Conclusions and outlooks
Plasma-based wakefield accelerators have attracted enormous attention and de-
veloped significantly since the proposal in 1979, due to ultra-high accelerating
gradients sustained by plasmas in comparison with those in metal cavities of
radio-frequency accelerators. So far electrons have been demonstrated in experi-
ment to be accelerated to as high as 85 GeV. Nevertheless, the achievable energy
gain of the witness bunch in one acceleration stage is subject to the transformer
ratio limit and thereby to the energy of the drive beam. Combining multiple
acceleration stages can, in principle, overcome the transformer ratio limit, but it
requires tens to hundreds stages for energy frontier collider applications, which is
technically challenging. Under this circumstance, proton driven plasma wakefield
acceleration looks particularly promising as existing proton bunches have huge
energy and large populations, therefore they are capable of powering particles to
the TeV energy level in a single and long distance plasma stage.
On the other hand, unlike the electron or laser driver, a positively charged
driver attracts plasma electrons instead of fully expelling them away and forming
an electron-free bubble. The resulting transverse wakefield is radially nonlinear
and varies both in time and along the witness bunch. The variations of radial
forces deteriorate the emittance of the accelerated beam and make it far from
suitable for prctical applications in future high luminosity colliders. In addition,
currently produciable high-energy proton bunches are tens of cm long, which is
much longer than the interesting submillimeter plasma wavelength. Such long
proton bunches therefore hardly excite strong plasma wakefields directly. Longi-
tudinal compression of the bunch length to the plasma wavelength by traditional
methods is conceivable, but it will be too costly and technically challenging to
implement given the required compression factor of up to several orders of mag-
nitude. Fortunately, the seeded self-modulation forces the micro-bunching of the
long proton bunch and therefore allows harnessing it as the driver to resonantly
excite strong plasma waves.
In this thesis, with theory and particle-in-cell simulations, we expand the
scope of proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration from a single short proton
bunch driven scheme to multiple proton bunch driven case and demonstrate the
generation of either a high quality TeV-scale electron or positron bunch, which
is essentially favored by future high-energy lepton colliders. The hollow plasma
channel involved plays a vital role in creating a beneficial accelerating struc-
ture for the acceleration and the beam quality preservation of the witness beam.
Hence, it is important that we assess the deleterious deflection effects induced
by the misalignment between the beam and the hollow channel. In addition, we
investigate the self-modulated long proton bunch and promote the excited wake-
field amplitude by a sophisticated plasma taper. Our work can be divided into
five aspects:
1. Simulations of the electron acceleration driven by an assumed single short
proton bunch in a hollow plasma channel demonstrate the efficient acceler-
ation of the witness electron bunch to 0.6 TeV with a preserved normalized
emittance in a single stage of 700 m. The electron beam carries the charge
of about 10% of 1 TeV proton driver charge. This work is complementary to
the previously published work on positron acceleration, though the discov-
Chapter 8: Conclusions and outlooks
ered similarly favorable accelerating regime created in the hollow channel
is not typical for nonlinear wakefields. It even contrasts with the uniform
plasma case, where the accelerating structure is strongly charge dependent.
In our discovered regime, the witness bunch is positioned in the region with
a strong and radially uniform accelerating field, but completely free from
plasma electrons and ions (i.e., no transverse plasma fields). As a result,
the beam emittance is conserved and the beam energy gain depends only
on the longitudinal position along the bunch, thus enabling minimization of
the energy spread by tailoring the bunch shape. The quadrupoles used to
confine the driver from emittance-driven widening also play an important
role in witness confinement. They keep the witness bunch from entering
the defocusing region that appears at large radii as the driver depletes.
2. In comparison with a single short proton bunch, which is necessarily ob-
tained by a significant compression, it is less challenging to produce a train
of short, lower charge proton bunches via longitudinal modulation of a long
proton bunch. Hence, we simulate the wakefield excitation driven by mul-
tiple proton bunches. By introducing a hollow plasma channel, we remove
the defocusing from the plasma ions and create a basin-like potential well
by the plasma electrons attracted within the channel to confine the proton
bunches in the blowout regime. Up to 90% of TeV protons from ten proton
bunches survive after propagating through a plasma of length 150 m. In
addition, up to half a wakefield period is applicable to each proton bunch
in terms of stable deceleration and maintenance. Strong plasma waves
are resonantly excited, which accelerate the witness electrons to 0.47 TeV.
The hollow channel also brings beneficial features for the accelerated beam,
such as emittance preservation and low energy spread (1.3%). The stud-
ied regime is attained at a proper ratio among plasma skin depth, driver
radius, hollow channel radius, and micro-bunch period. It can also sustain
relatively large plasma density inhomogeneity (at the level of 5%).
3. Nevertheless, the acceleration of positrons is different in the multiple proton
bunch driven hollow plasma scheme because the accelerating structure is
strongly charge dependent. The plasma electrons, used to provide focusing
to the multiple proton bunches, now dilute the positron bunch. It results
in a trade-off between keeping a small normalized emittance and a small
energy spread. By loading an extra electron bunch to repel the deleterious
plasma electrons and meanwhile reducing the plasma density slightly to
shift the accelerating phase with a conducive slope to the positron bunch,
the positron bunch can be accelerated to 400 GeV (40% of the driver en-
ergy) with an energy spread as low as 1% and well preserved normalized
emittance.
4. In terms of the non-uniformities or imperfections in the 3D world, the most
severe issue is the misalignment between the beam and the plasma channel.
Some preliminary simulations have been done to assess this effect induced by
the initially offset or tilted driving proton bunch. The proton bunch itself is
less sensitive to the initial misalignment as it has strong focusing from the
hollow channel, while the induced asymmetric transverse field drastically
leads to the deflection and eventually loss of the witness bunch. Adopting
a near-hollow plasma is promising to confine the witness bunch, but the
viability of a long term tolerance of the misalignment needs to be further
explored in order to determine whether the hollow structure is suitable for
future applications.
5. The amplitude of the seeded self-modulated plasma wakefield decreases
greatly after reaching the peak due to a significant decrease of the wake
phase velocity during self-modulation and a huge proton loss. With a so-
Chapter 8: Conclusions and outlooks
phisticated plasma taper which features an early and steep density increase
immediately followed by a linear transition, we are able to boost the wake-
field amplitude by 30%. In addition, 24% of the initial beam charge re-
mains in the micro-bunches. The main idea is to slow down the seeded
self-modulation in the early stage, so that protons gain smaller transverse
momenta while being bunched and escape less from the potential well. More
protons are therefore kept within the focusing and decelerating region, con-
tributing to the wake excitation.
The success of the AWAKE experiment for the first time verifies the principle
of plasma wakefield acceleration driven by high energy protons. It is an important
step towards the future energy frontier colliders. Our work essentially expands
this concept and more importantly we demonstrate the feasibility of generating
both high energy and high quality electrons and positrons, which are promising
candidates for the future lepton colliders. To assess our proposed schemes in
experiment, it apparently needs a lot of further efforts. Specifically, it requires
advanced technology development to produce one short proton bunch or a pro-
ton bunch train. The experimental implementation of a long hollow channel is
challenging as the current development is still in its infancy. Another important
issue that requires much attention is the adverse transverse effects induced by the
beam-channel misalignment, which could destroy the whole acceleration process.
We have preliminarily studied it for a short distance, whereas the long term ef-
fects need to be determined. In addition, in our simulations we assume the part
within the hollow channel pure vacuum, but it is actually filled with unionized
gas if the channel is created by gas ionization from a shaped laser. All these is-
sues should be investigated further before this hollow-plasma based acceleration
scheme becomes viable in the future, generating high quality beams for compact
and affordable energy frontier lepton colliders.
