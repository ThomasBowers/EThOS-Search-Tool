Abstract
In the central nervous system, small conductance calcium-activated potassium 
channels (SK) are important for the generation of the afterhyperpolarisation that 
follows single or trains of action potentials. Three SK channels have been cloned 
(SKI, SK2 and SK3), which are selectively blocked by the venom toxin apamin and 
present distinct pharmacological properties. The principal aim of this work is to 
investigate the subcellular distribution of SK2 and SK3 channels in neurones. For 
this purpose, antibodies directed against specific regions of SK2 and SK3 subunits 
were raised, purified and characterised. Immunohistochemistry on rat brain sections 
showed that the SK2 protein is localised in somatic and dendritic structures in 
various brain regions. SK3 immunoreactivity is mainly associated with fibers, but 
also with neuronal somata and dendrites. Intense SK3 expression was detected in the 
substantia nigra pars compacta, the locus coeruleus and the dorsal raphe. In these 
brain regions, the distribution of the channel was analysed in relation to monoamine- 
containing neurones, at two different developmental stages. In this work, I also 
report the characterization of a new SK2 variant, SK2-860, which differs from the 
SK2 subunit by having an extended amino terminus. Heterologous expression of this 
variant in primary neurones indicates that the majority of the protein is located in 
clusters distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Western blot analysis with the SK2 
antibody and with a specific antibody for the new variant showed that SK2-860 
subunit is expressed in the rat central nervous system. The distribution pattern of the 
SK2-860 in the rat brain largely overlaps the one observed for SK2.
Finally, in the last part of this work, the molecular determinants responsible for the 
difference in apamin sensitivity among the different members of the SK channel 
family were investigated. The study showed that the extracellular loop that connects 
transmembrane segments S3 and S4 of SK channel a  subunits significantly 
contributes to apamin sensitivity of SK2 channels.

CHAPTER 1 
Introduction
1.1 Ion channels
Electrical signalling plays an essential role for many biological processes and is 
made possible by the activity of ion transporters and pumps that create and maintain 
ion gradients across the cell membranes of animal cells. Pumps and transporters 
establish the precise concentration of several important ions inside and outside the 
cell: Na+, Ca2+ and Cl' are actively extruded to the extracellular space, whereas K+ is 
actively concentrated in the cytoplasm. These gradients represent the energy source 
for the passive movement of ions through specialised ionic pores, the ion channels 
(Hille, 1992).
Ion channels are integral membrane proteins (Jan and Jan, 2004). They are present 
nearly in all cell types, where they are important components of cell function. In 
excitable cells, such as the muscle, the heart and the brain, they are responsible for 
setting the resting membrane potential, and for the generation and transmission of 
electrical stimuli (Jan and Jan, 2004; Ashcroft, 2000; Hille, 1992). Ion channels open 
or close in response to different signals. Some channels are sensitive to changes of 
the membrane voltage, others open upon binding of specific ligands, such as Ca2+ 
and neurotransmitter, or in response to post-translational modifications including, for 
example, phosphorylation (Jan and Jan, 2004; Hille, 1992).
Ion channels are grouped in several families depending on their ion selectivity. The 
main families of ion channels are: Na+ channels, Ca2+ channels, CT channels, K+ 
channels and non selective cation channels (Alexander and Peters, 2004).
1.2 Potassium channels
K+ channels represent the largest and most diverse ion channel family (Coetzee et al.,
1999). They conduct K+ across the cell membrane down the electrochemical 
gradient. Opening of these channels generates efflux of K+ ions, reducing the number 
of positive charges inside the cell and, as a consequence, terminating or limiting 
excitation (Hille, 1992). In neuronal cells, K+ channels underlie different cellular 
functions, including the duration and the frequency of action potentials, the duration 
of interspike intervals during repetitive firing, the termination of periods of intense 
activity and neurotransmitters release from nerve terminals (Hille, 1992).
1.2.1 Potassium channel families
K+ channels are multimeric membrane proteins made of principal, pore-forming a  
subunits that are often associated with auxiliary p subunits (Deutsch, 2002). Every 
K+ channel principal subunit contains a basic structure consisting of two 
transmembrane domains (TM) and a loop (P loop) between them. Four of these 
structural elements are grouped together to form the ion-permeation pore across the 
cell membrane (MacKinnon, 1991).
Based on the predicted membrane topology of the a  subunits, K+ channels can be 
divided in four classes: 2 TM, 6 TM, 7 TM and 4 TM/2P (Wei et al., 1996). 2 TM 
proteins represent the inward-rectifying K+ channels (Kir) (Bichet et al., 2003). 
These subunits are composed of two transmembrane segments separated by a loop, 
and have the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains located intracellulary (Fig. 1.1
A). A functional Kir channel consists of tetramers of 2 TM subunits. 6 TM a  
subunits (Fig. 1.1 B) contain six transmenbrane domains, with the P-loop located 
between the S5 and S6 transmembrane regions. This family comprises the voltage- 
gated Kv subfamily (Tempel et al., 1987; Stuhmer et al., 1989; Pongs, 1992; Gutman 
et al., 2005), the Ca -activated small and intermediate conductance, SK (Kohler et 
al., 1996) and IK (Ishii et al., 1997a; Joiner et al., 1997; Logsdon et al., 1997) 
subfamilies. 6TM subunits associate in a tetramer to form a functional channel 
(MacKinnon, 1991; Liman et al., 1992). 7 TM a  subunits are represented by the Ca 
and voltage-sensitive, large conductance K+ channel (BK) (Atkinson et al., 1991; 
Adelman et al., 1992; Butler et al., 1993). The BK principal subunit contains seven 
membrane spanning domains. Unlike all the other K+ channels, the amino terminus 
of the BK a  subunits is placed on the extracellular side of the membrane (Meera et 
al.,1997). Functional BK channels are tetrameric complexes of 7 TM subunits. The 
last group of K+ channels principal subunits is the 4TM/2P, that most likely evolved 
by gene duplication from the 2 TM proteins coding genes. These proteins are 
components of the leak K+ channels. The 4TM/2P subunits are thought to dimerise to 
form functional channels, thereby maintaining the fourfold symmetry around the 
pore (Lesage et al., 1996; Goldstein et al, 1998). This family comprises a number of 
subfamilies including TASK, TREK, TRAAK, TWIK, THIK and TALK (Goldstein 
et al., 2005).

Several K+ channel a  subunits form heteromeric complexes with auxiliary p 
subunits, which can be cytosolic or integral membrane proteins. The association of p 
subunits modulates the channel properties, p subunits can influence the voltage 
dependence properties of the channel (Castellino et al., 1995; McManus et al., 1995), 
can affect the sensitivity of the principal subunit to toxins and drugs (Kaczorowski et 
al., 1996; Meera et al. 2000) or, in some cases, enable or increase the channel 
inactivation (Rettig et al., 1994; Morales et al., 1995). Moreover, some p subunits 
have been shown to have a chaperone-like effect by promoting and stabilising the 
cell surface expression of the channel complex (Fink et al., 1996; Shi et al., 1996; 
Trimmer, 1998)
1.2.2 Potassium channel structure
The pore region of K+ channel a  subunits contains a conserved amino acid sequence, 
GXG, which is named K+ channel signature sequence (Heginbotham et al., 
1994). The crystallisation of the procaryotic KcsA channel recently achieved by the 
group of Roderick MacKinnon, showed how these amino acids form an essential part 
of the pore of K+ channels, called selectivity filter (Doyle et al., 1998). As revealed 
by the crystal structure, the pore of K+ channels consists of a wide central water- 
filled cavity. This cavity is essential for letting hydrated K+ ions diffuse through the 
channel for more than half of the membrane before reaching the selectivity filter, 
which is located close to the extracellular surface. The selectivity filter is formed by 
the tight alignment of the four GXG motifs, one in each of the four a  subunits that 
form the channel, and confers to the pore the property that only K+ ions can pass. 
The high selectivity is achieved by the close spacing of carboxyl groups of the amino 
acid backbone around the pore axis that forms a cavity perfectly fitting the size of a 
dehydrated K+ ion. The interactions between these carboxyls and the K+ ions mimic 
the interactions between the K+ ions and water (Doyle et al., 1998). The selectivity 
filter contains four adjacent binding sites for the dehydrated K+ ions transiting 
through the channel (Fig. 1.2). The repulsion between the K+ ions occupying 
adjacent positions overcomes the affinity that each ion has for its binding site and 
allows permeation (Morais-Cabral et al., 2001; Miller, 2001).

inside the selectivity filter are represented in green. 
Inside the central cavity and outside the channel, K+ 
ions are surrounded by water molecules (red). 
(From MacKinnon, 2003).
1.3 The calcium activated potassium channel family
Ca2+-activated K+ channels integrate changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration with 
changes in the membrane potential in many different cell types. These channels are 
involved in numerous physiological functions, such as smooth muscle tone, 
secretion, control of neuronal firing properties and transmitter release (Vergara et al.,
1998). Ca2+-activated K+ channels have been subdivided into three main families, 
which are different in their physiological, molecular and pharmacological properties. 
These are the large conductance (BK), intermediate conductance (IK) and small 
conductance (SK) channels (Vergara et al., 1998).
1.3.1 BK channels
^  I |
BK channels are widely distributed Ca - and voltage-sensitive K channels. They 
have single channel conductance between 100 and 220 pS (Marty, 1989; Latorre et 
al., 1989; Reinhart et al., 1989), and are activated by the simultaneous increase in 
intracellular Ca and depolarization. The Ca dependence of BK channels is
influenced by the membrane potential, with the Kd for Ca in the micromolar range 
at resting potentials, and in the nanomolar range at depolarised membrane potentials 
(Latorre et al., 1989; Cui et al., 1997). Upon strong depolarisation, BK channels can
0  -t-
also open in the absence of Ca , indicating that they can function as purely voltage- 
dependent channels (Horrigan and Aldrich, 2002). The effects of Ca2+ and voltage on 
channel opening seem to consist of two independent processes, both increasing the 
open probability of the channels (Horrigan et al., 1999; Horrigan and Aldrich, 2002). 
BK channels are sensitive to inhibition by several compounds. They are blocked by 
micromolar concentrations of tetraethylammonium (TEA), charybdotoxin and by 
specific agents, including the scorpion toxin, iberiotoxin, and the mycotoxin, 
paxilline (Marty, 1989; Galvez et al., 1990; Sanchez and McManus, 1996; Wu,
2003).
The pore forming a  subunit of BK channels contains a core domain similar to the 
one of voltage-gated K+ channels, with six transmembrane segments S1-S6, 
including the voltage sensor S4 (Papazian et al., 1991). Additionally the subunit 
contains the amino-terminal SO transmembrane segment and a long carboxy-terminal 
domain (Meera et al., 1997). Although the voltage sensitivity is generated by 
mechanisms similar to the ones described for other voltage-gated K+ channels, the
mechanisms underlying the Ca2+ sensitivity have not been completely understood. 
One Ca2+ binding site of the BK a  subunits has been located in a highly conserved 
region named Ca2+ bowl, in the carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail (Wei et al., 
1994; Schreiber et al., 1997; Schreiber et al., 1999). An additional Ca2+ sensing 
domain has been located in the RCK (regulator of K+ conductance) domains (RCK1 
and RCK2), which share high homology with regulatory elements present in 
bacterial K+ channels, and are present in the amino-terminal part of the carboxy- 
terminal cytoplasmic tail (Xia et al., 2002). However, a further study reports that the
removal of the complete carboxy-terminal domain of BK does not disrupt the Ca
sensitivity of the channel, indicating that the Ca sensitivity domains in the carboxy- 
tail are not necessary for the effect of Ca2+ on channel opening (Piskorowski and 
Aldrich, 2002).
Native BK channels display a broad range of functional properties. Despite this high 
diversity, only one gene encodes the mammalian BK a  subunit. Several mechanisms 
generate diversity of native BK channels, including assembly with modulatory p 
subunits (Orio et al., 2002), alternative splicing (Shipston, 2001) and 
phosphorylation (Weiger, 2002).
To date, four p subunits have been cloned (Knaus, et al., 1994; Tseng-Crank et al., 
1996; Brenner et al., 2000; Meera et al., 2000; Uebele et al., 2000; Weiger et al., 
2000). They are membrane proteins containing two transmembrane domains 
connected by a loop. The assembly of the BK p subunits modifies the pharmacology, 
the gating kinetic or the voltage dependence of the principal BK a  subunits (Orio et 
al., 2002). Co-expression of the BK a  and pi subunits shifts the voltage dependence 
of activation to more negative membrane potentials, increases the Ca2+ sensitivity 
and influences the toxin binding (McManus et al., 1995; Dworetsky et al., 1996; 
Nimigean and Magleby, 1999; Wallner et al., 1999). The co-expression of BK a  
subunits with p2/p3 subunits results in channels that exhibit a reduced sensitivity to 
charybdotoxin and show rapid inactivation (Wallner et al., 1999; Brenner et al.,
2000). In contrast, the a  subunit alone or co-expressed with pl/p4 produces currents 
that do not inactivate (Wallner et al., 1999; Meera et al., 2000). The p4 subunit, 
which is mainly expressed in the brain, renders the a  subunit insensitive to 
iberiotoxin and charybdotoxin (Brenner at al., 2000; Weiger et al., 2000; Meera et
al., 2000). Alternative splicing of BK transcripts can generate channels that exhibit 
distinct functional features. Inclusion of STREX exon (STRess axis-regulated exon) 
speeds the activation and slows the deactivation kinetics, and results in channels with 
increased voltage and Ca2+ sensitivity (Xie et al., 1998). Furthermore, STREX 
introduces in the BK a  subunit a PKA phosphorylation site that, in heterologous 
expression system, switches the channel from being activated to being inactivated by 
PKA (Tian et al., 2001).
The current corresponding to the activation of BK channels has been named Ic , 
which, in neurones, participates in action potential repolarisation and is responsible 
for the fast afterhyperpolarization (Storm, 1987; Storm, 1990; Sah, 1996) In many 
central neurones, BK channels are present in somata, dendrites and presynaptic 
terminals (Edgerton and Reinhart, 2003; Hu et al., 2001) where they can be activated 
by intracellular Ca2+ increase mediated by voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Womack et 
al., 2004; Edgerton and Reinhart, 2003), NMDA receptors (Isaacson and Murphy,
2001) or intracellular Ca2+ release (Chavis et al., 1998). At axon terminals, BK 
channels contribute to repolarisation of the presynaptic action potential and function
as feedback regulators of Ca influx and neurotransmitter release (Hu et al., 2001).
1.3.2 IK channels
IK channels are voltage-insensitive, Ca -dependent K channels and they are mainly 
expressed in some non-neuronal cells such as epithelial cells and lymphocytes (Ishii 
et al., 1997a; Joiner et al., 1997; Logsdon et al., 1997). IK channels exhibit a single 
channel conductance of 30-40 pS, are blocked by charybdotoxin and clotrimazole 
(Ishii et al., 1997a; Logsdon et al., 1997) and are sensitive to the enhancer EBIO (1- 
ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone) (Devor et al., 1996; Jensen et al., 1998; Pedersen et al.,
1999). Currents due to the activation of IK channels have not been characterised in 
central neurones. In myenteric neurones, IK channels have been proposed to underlie 
a slow afterhyperpolarisation (Vogalis et al., 2002).
1.4 SK channels cloning and structure
Three members of the SK channel family have been cloned in 1996 by Kohler and 
colleagues: SKI (KCa2.1) SK2 (KCa2.2) and SK3 (KCa23) (Kohler et al., 1996). The 
three genes have a complex gene structure, with the coding region of SKI containing 
nine exons, and the coding regions of SK2 and SK3 containing 8 exons (Fig. 1.3). 
The exon-intron boundaries, which are conserved across species, are represented as 
black arrows in the Figure 1.3.

boxes represent the 6 transmembrane domains. On the right, the chromosomal localisation of the three 
genes in the human, mouse and rat genomes is reported. (From Stocker, 2004)
When expressed as homomultimers, the three identified subunits form ion channels 
that respond rapidly to Ca2+ applied on the cytoplasmic side, are voltage-independent 
and exhibit a small single channel conductance of ~10 pS (Kohler et a l, 1996). The 
Ca2+ concentration required for the half maximal activation of SK channels (EC50) is 
approximately 300-700 nM (Xia et al., 1998; Hirschberg, 1998).
Structurally, the SK channel subunits have a membrane topology similar to the 
voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels. The S4 transmembrane segment, which in Kv 
channels is the voltage sensor, presents a reduced number of positive charges, only 
two, compared to the seven basic residues of Kv channels (Kohler et al., 1996). This 
difference might represent the molecular basis for the voltage insensitivity of SK 
channels. The sequences of the three subunits are highly conserved in the 
transmembrane domains, as shown in the alignment of Figure 1.4, but diverge in 
length and sequence in the amino and carboxy terminals. SK channels contain 
multiple phosphorylation consensus sites for several protein kinases but no 
conserved N-linked glycosylation site and no Ca2+ binding domain (Kohler et al., 
1996). Because of the structural homology of SK a subunits and voltage-gated K+
Kc<12.1 (SK1) 
KCa2.2 (SK2) 
KCa2.3 (SK3)
channel a  subunits, which assemble in tetramers to form functional channels, it is 
likely that native SK channels are composed of four a  subunits.

1.5 Gating of SK channels
The SK a  subunits do not possess intrinsic Ca2+ binding domains (Kohler et al., 
1996); therefore, the Ca2+ sensitivity of the SK channels cannot be explained by 
direct binding of Ca2+. The work performed by Xia and colleagues revealed that SK 
channels use calmodulin as a high affinity Ca2+ sensor (Xia et al., 1998). Ca2+ gating 
is accomplished by the constitutive association of calmodulin to a region 
immediately adjacent to S6, in the carboxy terminal domain of each of the 4 SK a  
subunits (Keen et al., 1999; Xia et al., 1998). This region is highly conserved in all
SK channel subunits and is responsible for the Ca -independent binding of
calmodulin to the SK subunits. Calmodulin contains 4 Ca binding EF-hand motifs: 
the EF hands 1 and 2, located in the amino-terminal lobe (N-lobe), and the EF hands 
3 and 4 in the carboxy-terminal lobe (C-lobe). Mutagenesis studies revealed that the 
C-lobe of calmodulin interacts with the SK a  subunits in a Ca2+-independent manner, 
whereas the N-lobe interacts with the SK subunits only in the presence of Ca2+. The 
crystal structure of the calmodulin/a subunits complex, published by Schumacher 
and colleagues in 2001, confirmed these findings and indicated a model for the 
gating of SK channels (Schumacher et al., 2001). The structure of the SK2 channel 
calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD) consists of 2 a-helices, a l  and a2, connected 
by a loop, and organised in an antiparallel configuration (Fig. 1.5 A, B). The crystal 
structure revealed a dimeric structure of the CaMBD in presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1.5 A,
B), where two calmodulins are bound to the CaMBD dimer, and each calmodulin 
interacts with both CaMBDs. As shown in the Figure 1.5 A, the C-lobe of 
calmodulin grips the CaMBD a l  and a2 helices of one subunit, whereas the N-lobe 
interacts with the a2  helix of the neighbour SK subunit.

One CaMBD is shown in yellow, the other in blue. Each CaMBD consists o f a short a  helix (a l or

in green. The N-lobe of calmodulin contains Ca2+ ions, depicted in red. (From Schumacher et al., 
2001). B: A 90 rotation o f the structure reported in A is shown.
Although the crystallization was performed in the presence of Ca2+, only the EF 
hands 1 and 2 (N-lobe) contained Ca2+ ions, whereas the EF hands 3 and 4 of the C- 
lobe did not, supporting previous observations of the constitutive binding of the 
calmodulin C-lobe, and of the Ca2+-dependent interactions of the N-lobe with the SK
 ^  I
subunits. Moreover, biochemical data indicated that in the absence of Ca the 
calmodulin/CaMBD complex is monomeric. Taken together, all these data suggested 
a model for the gating of SK channels, shown in the schematic representation of 
Figure 1.6. The calmodulin C-lobe is bound to the carboxy-terminus of the SK a  
subunit. The binding of Ca2+ to the N-lobe causes structural rearrangements that 
allow its interaction with the CaMBD of a neighbouring SK a  subunit. Because each 
N-lobe of adjacent monomers contacts the CaMBD of the neighbouring SK subunit, 
the rearrangement results in a rotatory movement transmitted to the channel gate. 
The deactivation of the channel is the opposite process and occurs when the Ca2+ 
dissociates from calmodulin (Keen et al., 1999; Xia et al., 1998).

subunits forming a functional channel. The CaMBDs are represented as rectangular boxes. The 
calmodulin N- and C-lobes are the orange and yellow circles, respectively. The calmodulin C-lobe is 
bound to the CaMBD. Upon Ca2+ binding, the N-lobe interacts the CaMBD of a neighbouring SK
channel subunit and generate a rotatory movement responsible of the channel gating. (From 
Shumacher et al., 2001)
Recently, the study of Bildl and colleagues reported that, in addition to calmodulin, 
the SK channel subunits seem to form multiprotein complexes with two regulatory 
proteins, the protein kinase CK2 and the protein phosphatase 2A (Bildl et al., 2004). 
In this complex, protein kinase CK2 phosphorylates calmodulin. Phosphorylation of 
calmodulin reduces the Ca sensitivity of the SK channel by ~5 times and 
accelerates its deactivation kinetic (Bildl et al., 2004).
1.6 SK channel pharmacology
The distinctive feature of SK channel family is that they are selectively blocked by 
the bee venom toxin, apamin, an 18 amino acids peptide isolated from the apis 
millifera (Habermann, 1972; Haberman et al.,1979). Pharmacologically, the SK 
channels present distinct profiles. SK2 displays high sensitivity to apamin, in the 
picomolar range ( I C 5 0  = 27-140 pM) (Table 1), whereas SK3 is less sensitive to the 
toxin and is blocked by apamin concentrations in the nanomolar range ( I C 5 0  = 0.6-4 
nM) (Table 1). In contrast, initial expression studies of the hSKl in Xenopus oocytes 
showed that this subunit produced functional channels insensitive to apamin at 
concentrations up to 100 nM (Kohler et al., 1996; Ishii et al., 1997b). However, 
subsequent experiments performed by expressing hSKl in mammalian cell lines 
revealed that also this subunit is blocked by apamin, with I C 5 0  in the range between 
0.7 and 12 nM (Table 1). Interestingly, the behaviour of the rSKl subunit differs 
from hSKl, because rSKl does not express as a functional channel in oocytes and 
mammalian cell lines (Benton et al., 2003; Dhoedt et al., 2004). To date, the only 
pharmacological data on rSKl have been provided by a study on chimeric channels 
containing the core sequence (S1-S6) of rSKl (Dhoedt et al., 2004). By substituting 
either only the carboxy-terminus or the carboxy- and amino-terminal domains of 
rSKl with the corresponding regions of SK2, functional channels were obtained, but 
the resulting currents were not sensitive even to 100 nM apamin (Dhoedt et al., 
2004).
In addition to apamin, other scorpion venoms toxins target SK channels. These 
include: scyllatoxin (Chicchi et al., 1988) (Table 1); P05 (Zerrouk et al., 1993); the 
recently identified tamapin (Pedarzani et al., 2002) (Table 1); and Lei-Dab, a
compound highly selective for SK2 that was obtained by substituting the amino acid 
in position 7 of scyllatoxin with the non-natural amino acid di-aminobutanoic acid 
(Dab) (Shakkottai et al., 2001). Moreover, SK channels are inhibited by several 
organic compounds, such as d-tubocurarine (Table 1), quaternary salts of bicuculline, 
dequalinium, UCL 1684 and UCL 1848 (Stocker et al., 2004a).
The molecular basis of apamin and d-tubocurarine binding has been investigated 
using chimeras and mutagenesis studies (Ishii et al., 1997). Two amino acids (D341 
and N368 in rSK2), which are located on opposite sides of the outer vestibule of SK 
channels, have been found to be crucial for apamin and d-tubocurarine sensitivity 
(Ishii et al., 1997). Similarly to apamin, the sensitivity to scyllatoxin is mediated by 
amino acids in the outer pore region (Jager and Grissmer, 2004). Moreover, mutant 
cycle analysis has suggested that the Dab at position 7 in Lei-Dab directly interacts 
with one amino acid in the outer pore of SK2 (Shakkottai et al., 2001). Mutagenesis 
studies of the pore region of SK channels showed that a single amino acid in the 
outer pore of SK2 conferred sensitivity to the Kv channel blockers charybdotoxin 
and kaliotoxin (Jager and Grissmer, 2004). This suggests that a general architecture 
of the SK channel pore is similar to the one of Kv channels (Jager and Grissmer,
2004).

(13) Benton et al., 2003;
Besides SK channel blockers, some SK channels enhancers have also been reported. 
The typical SK channel enhancer is EBIO (l-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone), which was 
initially characterised on IK channels natively expressed in colonic epithelial cells 
(Devor et al., 1996). EBIO was subsequently shown to enhance the activity of IK 
channels heterologously expressed in cultured cells (Jensen et al., 1998; Pedersen et 
al., 1999). The application of EBIO on SKI and SK2 channels increases the Ca2+ 
sensitivity of the channels by ~ 7 fold and slows the channel deactivation (Pedarzani 
et al., 2001). EBIO has also been extensively used as a pharmacological tool for the 
investigation of the physiological role of native SK channels (Stocker, 2004b). Other 
compounds have also been shown to enhance the activity of SK2 as well as of IK 
channels, such as chlorzoxazone and zoxazolamine (Stocker et al., 2004a).
1.7 Alternative splicing of SK channels
Alternative splicing represents an important mechanism that contributes to the 
molecular diversity of the K+ channel family. To date, numerous splice variants of 
principal and accessory K+ channel subunits have been described. Some of them 
have been related to different functional consequences such as changes of the cellular 
targeting, differential tissue expression, or changes of the channel 
electrophysiological properties (Coetzee et al., 1999).
Recent evidence indicates that alternative splicing occurs also within the SK channel 
family. In particular, extensive alternative splicing has been reported for the mouse 
SKI gene (Shmukler et al., 2001). RT-PCR studies showed that 20 SKI alternatively 
spliced transcripts are found in brain tissue. The 20 variants code for 16 putative 
polypeptides arising from the combination of 2 different amino-terminal amino acid 
sequences and 8 different carboxy-terminal amino acid sequences, some of which do 
not preserve the ability to bind calmodulin (Shmukler et al., 2001). Although the 
transcripts for 16 putative polypeptides have been detected, it has still to be 
determined whether these proteins exist in vivo and whether they contribute to the 
generation of functional SK channels. Recent studies reported also the existence of 
several SK3 splice variants. An hSK3 variant, named hSK3_ex4, containing an
additional exon between the third and fourth exons of hSK3, has been identified 
(Figure 1.7 A) (Wittekindt et al., 2004). The inclusion of the new exon 4 results in 
the insertion of 15 amino acids between the S5 segment and the P-loop of the hSK3 
a  subunit (Figure 1.7 A). Pharmacological studies revealed that the hSK3_ex4 is 
insensitive to the classical SK channel blockers such as apamin, scyllatoxin and d- 
tubocurarine. Transcripts coding for hSK3_ex4 were found in neuronal and non
neuronal human tissues but were expressed at lower levels when compared with 
hSK3. Additionally, two more SK3 variants, named SK3-1B (Tomita et al., 2003) 
and SK3-1C (Kolski-Andreaco et al., 2004), have been described. These variants use 
alternative first exons, termed IB and 1C, which are localised downstream to the first 
exon of SK3 (Fig. 1.7 B). Consequently, the resulting proteins lack the amino- 
terminal domain and the SI transmembrane segment. Interestingly, the heterologous 
expression of SK3-1B and of SK3-1C does not produce functional channels, but the 
two variants have been shown to act as dominant negative inhibitors of members of 
the SK-IK channel family (Tomita et al., 2003; Kolski-Andreaco et al., 2004). Little 
is known about the native expression and the functional role of these SK splice 
variants in vivo, and more work is needed to understand the physiological 
consequences of alternative splicing within the SK channel family. SK3-1B has been 
used to generate transgenic animals (see also 1.10) to study the physiological roles of 
SK channels (Shakkottai et al., 2004; Villalobos et al., 2004).

1.8 Trafficking and assembly of SK channel subunits
The investigation of trafficking and multimerisation of SK channels has revealed a 
complex picture where the molecular determinants involved in these processes are 
different, making their analysis particularly complicated. Several studies suggest that 
the carboxy-terminal domain of SK channels has a relevant role both in trafficking 
and tetramerisation (Lee et al., 2003; Kolski-Andreaco et al., 2004; Roncarati et al., 
2005). However, more recent evidence proposes that molecular determinants for the 
correct targeting are also present in other regions of the SK a  subunits (Miller et al., 
2001; Roncarati et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2005). The constitutive association between 
SK a  subunits and calmodulin is necessary not only for gating but also for trafficking 
(Lee et al., 2003). In SK2 a  subunits, the mutation of the amino acids responsible for 
the constitutive interaction with calmodulin results in SK2 channels that, besides 
having reduced affinity for calmodulin, display incorrect membrane trafficking. In 
fact, the mutant SK2 subunits are not expressed in the membrane but are retained in 
intracellular compartments (Lee et al., 2003). Coexpression of the mutated channel 
with calmodulin overcomes the reduced affinity to calmodulin and results in 
membrane expression. Membrane targeting is also obtained by coexpressing the 
mutant SK2 with a mutant calmodulin (CaM 1, 2, 3 and 4) that is unable to bind 
Ca2+, indicating that only the Ca2+-independent interactions with calmodulin are 
necessary for surface expression (Lee et al., 2003). Moreover, deletion of CaMBD 
causes retention of the SK3 a  subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum and no 
membrane expression, but does not interfere with oligomerisation of the channel 
subunit (Roncarati et al., 2005). These observations indicate that the interaction with 
calmodulin is important for the trafficking of the SK channels but not for subunit 
assembly. A possible role of the amino-terminal domain in membrane targeting has 
also been proposed, as the expression of a dominant negative SK3 amino-terminal 
fragment has been shown to oligomerise with native SK2 currents in Jurkat cells 
(Miller et al., 2001). Moreover, the complete truncation of the amino-terminal 
domain in SK3 results in the lack of membrane expression of the channel (Roncarati 
et al., 2005). More recently, the cytoplasmic linker S4-S5 of IK and SK3 channels 
has been reported to be involved in channel trafficking (Jones et al., 2005). In 
particular, the mutation of a lysine in the S4-S5 linker (K197 of hIK and K453 of 
SK3) results in channels that fail to traffic to the plasma membrane, accumulate in
the endoplasmic reticulum, but can assemble in multimeric complexes (Jones et al., 
2005).
The identification of a region involved in the assembly of SK channels has emerged 
from the study of the amino-terminal truncated splice variant SK3-1C (Kolski- 
Andreaco et al, 2004). The variant sequesters SK-IK channels and retain them in 
intracellular compartments, thereby preventing their functional membrane targeting 
(see also 1.6) (Kolski-Andreaco et al., 2004). Deletion analysis identified a 30 amino 
acid fragment, localised in the carboxy-terminus of SK3-1C, as the region 
responsible for this effect. The identified domain, which is called dominant 
inhibitory segment (DIS), covers part of the CaMBD (Fig. 1.8), but experimental 
evidence indicates that the segment does not interfere with calmodulin binding. The 
DIS is very conserved among the members of the SK channel family and resembles a 
coiled-coil domain known to mediate specific multimerisation of many K+ channels 
(Jenke et al., 2003), suggesting that it could be involved in SK subunit assembly.
FIGURE 1.8: Localisation of the DIS domain. Schematic representation of the topological structure 
of the SK a  subunits, indicating the location o f the calmodulin binding domain and of the dominant 
inhibitory segment (DIS). (From Kolski-Andreaco et al., 2004).
Several studies indicate that the heteromeric assembly between members of the SK 
channel family occurs. Ishii and colleagues have shown that coexpression of rSK2 
and hSKl in oocytes results in functional channels with an apamin sensitivity that is 
intermediate between the sensitivity measured for homomeric SK2 and for 
homomeric hSKl (Ishii et al., 1997b). More recent studies indicate that, although 
rSKl subunits alone do not form functional channels, they can form heteromers with 
rSK2. These heteromeric channels generate larger currents but reduced apamin 
sensitivity when compared to SK2 homomers (Benton et al., 2003). Additionally, the 
coexpression of rSK3 and SKI subunits (both human and rat) reduces the expression 
levels of functional rSK3 channels, suggesting heteromultimerisation of the two
subunits (Monaghan et al., 2004). Interestingly the most dramatic effect on SK3 
expression is induced by hSKl which completely suppressed the SK3 currents 
(Monaghan et al., 2004). Also, there is evidence for heteromeric assembly of SK2 
and SK3 subunits (Miller et al., 2001). In Jurkat cells, the expression of an SK3- 
amino-terminal fragment suppresses native SK2 currents, supporting that coassembly 
between the two subunits might occur (Miller et al., 2001). A further indication 
comes from pharmacological data based on the use of an SK3 mutant insensitive to 
apamin and to UCL 1848 (Monaghan et al., 2004). The heterologous expression of 
this SK3 mutant and SK2 results in channels with sensitivity to apamin and 
UCL1848 intermediate between the sensitivity that was measured when the two 
subunits were expressed alone (Monaghan et al., 2004). Although heteromeric 
association of SK a  subunits seems to occur in recombinant expression systems, it is 
not clear whether such interactions occur in vivo. In fact, biochemical techniques 
based on the use of specific antibodies for SK2 and SK3 did not detect the presence 
of SK2-SK3 heteromers in rat brain (Sailer et al, 2002). Therefore, the existence and 
the physiological role of heteromers of SK subunits in vivo have still to be 
determined.
1.9 SK channel distribution
SK channels are predominantly expressed in the brain, as supported by Northern 
blot, in situ hybridisation and RT-PCR analysis (Kohler et al., 1996; Stocker and 
Pedarzani, 2000; Hosseini et al., 2001; Bosh et al., 2002). However, transcripts 
coding for the different SK subunits have also been detected in some peripheral 
tissues including the heart, which expresses SKI, SK2 and SK3 mRNA (Kohler et al. 
1996, Hosseini, 2001; Xu et al., 2003); the adrenal gland, where SKI and SK3 
transcripts have been detected (Kohler et al., 1996); superior cervical ganglia, liver 
and the skeletal muscle which display SK3 mRNA expression (Hosseini et al., 2001). 
In situ hybridisation and recent immunohistochemical studies reported that in the 
mature rat brain the three SK subunits present a distinct distribution profile (Stocker 
and Pedarzani, 2000; Tacconi et al, 2001; Bosch et al., 2002; Sailer et al., 2002; 
Sailer et al., 2004; Sarpal et al., 2004). In many brain regions, the expression profile 
of SKI and SK2 subunits overlaps, whereas SK3 has a complementary distribution 
(Fig. 1.9). In particular, high levels of SKI and SK2 are detected in the neocortex, in
the hippocampus and in the thalamus. At the cellular level, immunolocalisation of 
SK2 has shown that this subunit has a preferential localization in Purkinje cell 
somata and dendrites at early stages of postnatal development (Cingolani et al., 2002; 
Womack and Khodakhah, 2003). Somatodendritic localisation has also been 
described for SKI subunits in CA1 primary cultures (Bowden et al., 2001) but this 
observation differs from the localisation of this subunit in the brain tissue, where 
SKI immunoreactivity was associated with the dendrites but not to the somata of 
CA1 hippocampal neurones (Sailer et al., 2002; Sailer et al., 2004). SK3 is 
abundantly expressed in many subcortical areas such as most thalamic nuclei, the 
lateral septum, the hypothalamus and in different monoaminergic neurones. 
Somatodendritic localisation of SK3 in dopaminergic neurones of the substantia 
nigra pars compacta emerged from immunhistochemical studies with an SK3 specific 
antibody (Wolfart et al., 2001). Moreover, axonal and presynaptic localization has 
been proposed for SK3 in primary cultures of hippocampal neurones, where the SK3 
protein co-localises with presynaptic marker proteins (Obermair et al., 2003). These 
observations suggest that, despite their similarity, the different SK subunits not only 
are localised in different brain areas but also might be targeted to specific cellular 
compartments in different neuronal types.

1.10 Physiological roles of SK channels
In neurones, single or repetitive action potentials are followed by an 
afterhyperpolarisation (AHP) that moves the membrane potential away from the 
action potential threshold, therefore reducing neuronal excitability. Three types of 
AHP have been classified according to their time course (Sah, 1996; Sah and Davies, 
2000; Sah and Faber, 2002):
 the fast AHP (fAHP) is activated during the action potential and lasts 1-10 ms 
(Fig. 1.10 A);
 the medium AHP (mAHP) activates rapidly following one or more action 
potentials (1-5 ms) and decays within 200-400 ms (Fig. 1.10 A, B);
 the slow AHP (sAHP) can be observed only after a train of action potentials, 
peaks in several hundreds of milliseconds and can last up to 5 s (Fig. 1.10 B).

FIGURE 1.10: Representation of the three types of AHP that follow single or repetitive action 
potentials. A: Single action potentials are followed by a fast afterhyperpolarisation (fAHP), generated 
by the Ca2+-activated K+ current Ic. An afterhyperpolarising phase called mAHP follows the fAHP. 
The apamin-sensitive Iahp current underlies the mAHP. Depending on the brain region, other currents 
are also involved in the generation o f the mAHP. For example, in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal 
neurones, the voltage sensitive IM and the voltage- and Ca2+-sensitive Ic currents contribute to the 
generation of the mAHP. B: Train o f action potentials elicited by constant current injection in

whereas the sAHP develops only after a train o f action potentials (Adapted from Storm, 1990).
SK channels contribute to the generation of the mAHP, underling the I a h p  current,
* 2+that is Ca -activated, voltage-insensitive and selectively blocked by apamin, d-
tubocurarine and scyllatoxin (Kawai and Watanabe, 1986; Schwindt et al., 1988; 
Osmanovic et al., 1990; Stocker et al., 1999; Stocker et al., 2004a). Although SK 
channels have also been proposed to be involved in the generation of the s I a h p  
current, which underlies the sAHP, there is no clear evidence for this hypothesis and, 
to date, the molecular determinants of this current are still a matter of debate 
(Vogalis et al., 2003; Bond et al., 2004; Stocker, 2004a-b; Villabos et al., 2004).
The I a h p  has been described in a large number of central neurones, in agreement with 
the broad distribution profile of the SK channel subunits in the central nervous 
system (Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000). The I a h p  displays a variety of functional roles, 
depending on the neuronal type, on the coupling to different Ca sources, on the SK 
channel subunit composition and, possibly, on their subcellular localisation (Stocker 
et al., 2004b). The correlation between the SK channel distribution and the 
pharmacological properties of the I a h p  in various neuronal types provides 
information on the molecular composition of the channels underlying the I a h p - 
Moreover, the use of immunohistochemical techniques for the analysis of the SK 
channel cellular distribution is starting to increase the information on how separate 
populations of SK channels, localised in specific neuronal compartments, contribute 
to different physiological roles.
In the hippocampus, the pyramidal neurones of the CA1 hippocampal region exhibit 
an apamin-sensitive I a h p  current, that controls the early frequency of firing (Stocker 
et al., 1999). In these neurones, the high mRNA levels of the SK2 subunit (Stocker 
and Pedarzani, 2000) and the apamin sensitivity of the I a h p  current (IC50 of 480 pM) 
suggested that SK2 is one of the main molecular determinants of the channels 
underlying the I a h p  (Stocker et al., 1999). The IC50 for apamin in hippocampal 
neurones is higher than that measured for heterologously expressed SK2 subunits 
(Stocker et al., 1999). This observation, together with the presence of SKI transcripts 
in the CA1 pyramidal neurones, indicated the possibility that SK1/SK2 heteromeric 
channels underlie the I a h p  in these brain region (Stocker et al., 1999; Stocker and 
Pedarzani, 2000). However, electrophysiological studies on transgenic animals that 
lack either SK2 or SKI channels indicate that SK2 alone can generate the I a h p  
current in CA1 pyramidal neurones (Bond et al., 2004). CA3 pyramidal neurones
have also been shown to express an I a h p  current of similar amplitude to the one 
measured in CA1 pyramidal neurones, whereas a smaller I a h p  is present in dentate 
gyrus granule cells (Sailer et al., 2002). This difference in the current amplitude 
correlates with the observation that CA1 and CA3 regions display higher SK2 
expression levels than the dentate gyrus (Stocker et al., 2000; Sailer et al., 2002; 
Sailer et al., 2004) and support the notion that SK2 channels contribute to the 
generation of the apamin-sensitive I a h p - Also, hippocampal intemeurones of CA3 
stratum radiatum exhibit an I a h p  current that is involved in the regulation of the tonic 
firing activity (Savic et al., 2001). The selective detection of SK2 mRNA in these 
neurones indicates that SK2 homomeric channels are likely to be responsible for the 
generation of the I a h p  (Savic et al., 2001).
SK channels are involved in the regulation of the spontaneous firing in several 
neuronal types. For example, SK3 is the predominant subunit underlying the I a h p  
current in dopaminergic neurones of the substantia nigra pars compacta. In this area, 
the current has a determinant role in controlling the frequency of spontaneous firing 
(Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000; Wolfart et al, 2001) and is selectively activated by T- 
type Ca2+ channels (Wolfart et al., 2002). The I a h p  contributes to the regulation of the 
spontaneous firing also in motor neurones of the dorsal vagal nucleus (Pedarzani et 
al., 2000). Pharmacological studies and in situ hybridisation indicate that SK3 
homomeric channels underlie the I a h p  current in these neurones (Pedarzani et al., 
2000). In the supraoptic neurones, an apamin-sensitive I a h p  current is involved in the 
control of the phasic firing of the supraoptic neurosecretory neurones (Bourque and 
Brown, 1987; Kirkpatrick and Bourque, 1996). The current has been reported to have 
an estimated apamin sensitivity in the nanomolar range ( I C 5 0  of 1.3 nM) (Bourque 
and Brown, 1987). This observation, together with the selective detection of SK3 
mRNA (Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000) in this brain region, suggests that the current is 
likely to be mediated by SK3 homomeric channels. In Purkinje neurones of the 
cerebellum, SK2 channels have been shown to mediate the I a h p  current that regulates 
the tonic firing pattern of these cells (Cingolani et al., 2002; Womack and 
Khodakhah, 2003; Edgerton et al., 2003). The selective activation of P/Q type Ca2+ 
channels seems to be responsible for the activation of the SK channels in these 
neurones (Womack et al., 2004).
Recently, a new role for SK channels in the modulation of the synaptic activity of the 
hippocampal pyramidal neurones has been proposed (Ngo-Anh et al., 2005; Faber et 
al., 2005; Cai et al., 2004). In individual spines of hippocampal CA1 neurones, the 
Ca2+ entry during synaptic activation opens SK channels that, in turn, reduce the 
NMDA receptor-mediated Ca transients within the spine, resulting in the reduction 
of the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials at the soma (Ngo-Anh et al., 
2005). A similar physiological role of SK channels has been described in neurones of 
the lateral amygdaloid nucleus (Faber et al., 2005), where SK channels, localised in 
the dendritic spines, function as feed-back regulators of synaptic response to 
glutamate. Moreover, recent evidence shows that, in organotypic hippocampal 
cultures, SK channels are responsible for the repolarization of local dendritic plateau 
potentials triggered by focal glutamate application to CAI pyramidal neurone distal 
apical dendrites (Cai et al., 2004).
Further information on the physiological function of SK channels are derived from 
the generation of transgenic animals with enhanced or reduced expression of the SK 
channel a  subunits. The generation of a mouse model where the expression of the 
SK3 gene was regulated by dietary administration of a tetracycline derivative showed 
that suppression of SK3 did not produce any phenotypic change (Bond et al., 2000). 
On the contrary, the overexpression of SK3 resulted in mice with abnormal 
respiration and abnormal parturition (Bond et al., 2000). Also, the splice variant 
SK3-1B (see also 1.6), which suppresses SK and IK channels, was used to generate 
transgenic animals. The mouse model was engineered to express the SK3-1B under 
the control of a neuronal promoter, resulting in the expression of the transgene in 
several brain regions (Shakkottai et al., 2004). The transgenic mice developed severe 
cerebellar ataxia due to an increased excitability of the deep cerebellar nuclei. This 
enhanced excitability was shown to be generated by downregulation of SKI and SK2 
channel expression in the deep cerebellar nuclei of the cerebellum, which resulted in 
the reduction of the apamin-sensitive I a h p  (Shakkottai et al., 2004). The SK3-1B 
transgene was also expressed in pyramidal neurones of neocortical layer V. The 
expression of the transgene in these neurones caused a strong reduction of the 
apamin-sensitive I a h p  measured in this brain region (Villalobos et al., 2004).
Moreover, electrophysiological studies on mice models lacking SKI or SK3 revealed 
that the I a h p  current measured in CAI pyramidal neurones was unchanged (Bond et 
al., 2004). On the contrary, the lack of SK2 subunit abolished the I a h p  current in CAI 
pyramidal neurones, confirming that SK2 is the principal SK subunit contributing to 
the generation of that current (Bond et al., 2004).
1.11 Aims of this thesis
The principal aim of this thesis was the study of different aspects of the distribution 
of SK subunits in the rat brain:
- the subcellular distribution of the SK2 a  subunit was analysed in different 
central neurones by using a site-directed SK2 antibody, anti-NSK2, in 
immunohistochemistry studies;
- the distribution pattern and the targeting of a newly identified SK2 splice 
variant, called SK2-860, were investigated. For this purpose, an antibody 
specifically recognising this new variant was characterised and used in 
combination with the anti-NSK2 antibody to assess the distribution of the 
SK2-860 protein in native tissue and in transfected neuronal cells;
- after the characterisation of an SK3-specific antibody, immunohistochemical 
studies were performed to assess the cellular distribution of the SK3 subunit 
in various brain regions;
- the developemental distribution of the SK3 subunit was analysed in the rat 
brain monoaminergic regions such as the substantia nigra-ventral tegmental 
area, the locus coeruleus and the dorsal raphe.
In the last chapter of this thesis, the aim was to refine the understanding of the
differences in apamin-sensitivity between the members of the SK channel family.

2.2 Methods
2.2.1 Membrane purification of antibody
2.2.1.1 Membrane preparation. The anti-NSK2 antibody, raised against GST- 
NSK2 fusion protein (2.1.5), was purified using the Trx-NSK2 fusion protein in 
which the same region of SK2 used to raise the antibody was fused to Thioredoxin 
(Trx). 100 pg of Trx-NSK2 fusion protein were solubilized in 0.5 ml PBS-Azide and 
adsorbed to nitrocellulose membrane (Protran Schleicher & Schuell, 1.4 x 1.4 cm) 
at room temperature for 2 hours, in a sealed plastic bag under slow rotation. After 
rinsing in PBS-Azide, the membrane was blocked with 10 ml of 5% dry milk in 
PBS-Azide for 2 hours in a Petri dish (92 x 19 mm). The membrane was then washed 
twice for 5 min in PBS-Azide, once in wash buffer, and twice in 1% BSA (Sigma, A- 
3294)/PBS-Azide. All washes were performed with 10 ml of the indicated solution, 
in a Petri dish (92 x 19 mm). After moving the membrane into a clean 2 ml tube, the 
fusion protein weakly bound to the membrane was removed by vortexing the 
membrane for 1 min in 500 pi of acidic elution buffer and three times for 1 min in 
500 pi of alkaline elution buffer. After discarding the last time the alkaline buffer, 
the membrane was moved back in a Petri dish, and washed first for 5 min with PBS- 
Azide and then for 5 min with 5% dry milk/PBS-Azide.
2.2.1.2 Antibody purification. The binding of the antibody was performed by 
incubating the membrane (2.2.1.1) with the anti-NSK2 serum (50 pi antiserum 
diluted in 500 pi of 5% dry milk/PBS-Azide) in a sealed plastic bag, over night at 
4C, under slow rotation. The next morning the membrane was washed for 5 min in 
wash buffer and twice for 5 min in 1% BSA (Sigma, A-3294)/PBS-Azide. The 
antibody elution was performed by vortexing the membrane for exactly 1 min with 
500 pi acidic buffer, and, right away, the eluted antibody was neutralized with 125 pi 
Tris-HCl (1 M, pH 8.0). This elution step was repeated a second time and, after 
removing the second eluate, the membrane was washed twice for 1 min in 1% BSA 
(Sigma, A-3294)/PBS-Azide. Two more elutions were performed, as described 
before, by adding 500 pi of alkaline buffer and neutralising each eluate in 50 pi Tris- 
HCl (1 M, pH 8.0). All the eluates were combined.
2.2.1.3 Desalting of the purified antibody. The combined fractions were desalted 
by gel filtration using NAP-10 columns (AmershamPharmacia). The columns were 
equilibrated with 15 ml of equilibration buffer and loaded with 1.25 ml of the
sample. The elution was carried out with 1.5 ml of equilibration buffer. Finally, 100 
pi aliquots of purified antibody were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -

2.2.2 Column purification
2.2.2.1 Column preparation. SulfoLink coupling gel was used to immobilize the 
fusion protein Trx-NSK2 (2.1.5), the NSK2-pepspot peptide (2.1.5) or the peptide 
SK3 (2.1.5) that were used for the affinity purification of the anti-NSK2 and anti- 
NSK3 sera. SulfoLink enables the covalent immobilisation of sulphydryl-containing 
peptides or proteins to an agarose gel support. The coupling is mediated by the 
reaction of the iodoacetyl groups of the matrix with the reduced sulphydryl group of 
the terminal cysteine of the peptide or other free sulphydryl groups. Before 
immobilization, the peptide was reduced using the immobilized TCEP disulphide
Reducing Gel, where the reducing agent TCEP is linked to agarose beads which 
allow an easy separation from the reducing agent.
22.2.2 Peptide reduction. All the solutions used for this procedure were 
deoxygenated by bubbling N2 through the solutions for 15 min. 1 mg of peptide was 
dissolved in 200 pi of sterile dt^O; EDTA was added to the peptide solution at the 
final concentration of 10 mM and Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was added at the final 
concentration 5 mM. 750 pi of TCEP reducing gel (corresponding to 1.5 ml of 50% 
slurry) was equilibrated at room temperature, centrifuged at 50 x g for 1 min and the 
supernatant was removed. The reducing gel was washed three times with 750 pi of 
deoxygenated reducing buffer. Each wash was performed by adding reducing buffer, 
vortexing, centrifuging at 50 x g for 1 min and, finally, removing the supernatant. 
After the last wash, the peptide solution and 150 pi of reducing buffer were added to 
the TCEP-agarose beads, mixed by vortexing, and incubated for 15 min at room 
temperature under slow rotation. To recover the reduced peptide, the beads were 
sedimented as before and the supernatant was collected. The TCEP reducing gel was 
washed three times with 200 pi of reducing buffer and the collected supernatants 
were combined. To remove any residue of agarose, the solution containing the 
reduced peptide was finally filtered using a spin column (mini spin handy, Pierce) by 
centrifugation at 50 x g for 1 min. The flow through, which contained the reduced 
peptide, was collected and Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) was added at the final concentration of 
50 mM.

2.2.2.3 Peptide coupling to SulfoLink affinity matrix. After equilibrating the 
SulfoLink coupling gel at room temperature, 2 ml of 50% slurry were moved into a 
tube and washed three times with 1 ml of deoxygenated coupling buffer. Washes 
were performed by adding coupling buffer, vortexing, centrifuging at 50 x g for 1 
min and discarding the supernatant. After the last wash, the solution containing the 
reduced peptide was added to the SulfoLink gel and incubated for 15 min under slow 
rotation followed by 30 min without rotation. The agarose beads were sedimented at
50 x g for 1 min, and, after removing the supernatant, they were washed with 
coupling buffer. In order to block non-specific binding sites on the gel, 1 ml of 
coupling buffer containing 50 mM cysteine was added to the gel matrix and 
incubated for 15 min under slow rotation, at room temperature, followed by further 
30 min incubation without rotation. The matrix was finally transferred into a column 
(500 pi per column), washed first with 16 matrix volumes of 1 M NaCl and then with 
16 volumes of 0.05% Azide. The column was stored at 4C in TBS-0.005% Azide 
and was washed with 5 ml TBS before starting the purification.

2.2.2.4 Column purification. 500 pi of serum were diluted in 4.0 ml solution A, 
incubated at 56C for 30 min and centrifuged at 16000 x g for 15 min at 4C. The 
diluted serum was then loaded onto the affinity column (2.2.2.3) with a flow rate of 5 
column volumes per hour. The eluate was collected and loaded three more times onto 
the column. The flow through after the fourth repetition was stored at 4C. In order 
to remove the antibody not specifically bound to the fusion protein, the column was 
first washed four times with 1 ml of solution A and then four times with 1 ml of a 
high salt buffer (solution B). The first elution of the antibody was performed using 
an acidic solution: 6 x 500 pi of solution C were loaded on the column and each 
eluate was immediately neutralised with 75 pi 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). After washing 
the column four times with 1 ml of solution A, the alkaline elution was performed: 6 
x 500 pi of solution D were loaded on the column and each 500 pi eluate was 
collected in 1.5 ml tubes containing 150 pi 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) for neutralisation. 
The column was finally washed five times with 1 ml of solution A, once with TBS- 
0.005% Azide and stored at 4C. OD measurements at 280 nm were performed to 
assess the protein concentration of each elution fraction, the flow through and each 
washing step, in order to estimate the progress of the purification. Elution fractions 
with the highest protein concentration were pooled and desalted by gel filtration 
using NAP 10 columns (2.2.1.3). 100 pi aliquots of purified antibody were snap 
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C.

2.2.3 Peptide coupling to Imject Maleimide Activated BSA
The PepSPOT peptide was coupled to Imject Maleimide Activated BSA carrier 
protein in order to perform ELISA experiments. The PepSPOT peptide (1 mg) was 
dissolved in 150 pi of BSA reducing buffer and reduced as described in 2.2.2.2, but 
using BSA coupling buffer in place of the reducing buffer. The Imject Maleimide 
Activated BSA was reconstituted in 200 pi of deoxygenated dH20  and mixed to the 
reduced peptide. The mix was incubated for 2 hours at room temperature under slow 
rotation to allow the binding of the peptide to the BSA. After the incubation, aliquots 
of BSA-peptide were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C.

2.2.4 ELISA
The success of the antibody purification was tested with an ELISA assay. 3 pg/ml of 
antigen in coating buffer were adsorbed overnight at 4C on 96-well Maxisorp plates 
(60 pi/well). The next morning the antigen solution was removed, the wells were 
washed in ELISA wash buffer and then blocked for 30 min in ELISA blocking 
solution (250 pl/well). After 3 rinses in ELISA wash buffer, the wells were incubated 
with serial dilutions of primary antibody diluted in ELISA blocking solution (60 
pl/well) for 2 hours at room temperature. After removing the antibody, the wells 
were washed twice in ELISA wash buffer, once in PBS, and then incubated for 45 
min with the secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP-conjugated antibody (1:1000, 
Sigma) diluted in PBS supplemented with 1 mg/ml Hemoglobin (60 pl/well). The 
secondary antibody was removed and the wells were washed three times with PBS. 
Afterwards, the HRP substrate ABTS (1 mg/ml) plus 0.006% H2O2 in incubation 
buffer was added (100 pl/well). The reaction was carried out for 5-7 min in the dark, 
and then stopped with 100 pi of 10% SDS solution. The absorbance was read at the 
wavelength of 405 mm with a Thermo-max microplate reader (Molecular Devices). 
Data were analysed using Microsoft Excel.

2.2.5 Primary antibody preadsorption
To demonstrate the specificity of the primary antibodies, the affinity-purified anti- 
NSK2 and anti-CSK3 antibodies (2.1.5) were preadsorbed with the corresponding 
antigens (pET-NSK2 and SK3 peptide) (2.1.5). The amount of purified antibody 
needed for the final dilution was incubated in 100 pi lxTBS supplemented with 2% 
BSA (Sigma, A-3294)/5% NGS either with Trx-NSK2 (20 pg/ml) or with the SK3 
peptide (30 pg/ml). The pre-adsorption was carried out for 4 hours at room 
temperature or over night at 4C, under slow rotation. This mixture was then 
adjusted to the final volume with the buffer used for the primary antibody incubation 
in Western, immunocytochemistry or immunohistochemistry experiments. The given 
peptide concentrations refer to the final volume used in each experiment. In parallel 
the anti-NSK2 and anti-CSK3 antibody were incubated under the same conditions 
but omitting the fusion protein or peptide.
The preadsorption of the anti-N860 antibody was performed by immobilising the 
pET-N7 antigen on nitrocellulose membrane (Protran Schleicher & Schiill, 1.0 x 1.0 
cm). The binding of the antigen to the membrane was performed as described in 
2.2.1.1, in a 0.5 ml tube under slow rotation. Afterwards, the membrane was washed, 
blocked for 2 hours and then washed again as described in 2.2.1.1. In order to 
remove the pET-N7 antigen weakly bound to the membrane, three acidic elutions 
were performed followed by washes with PBS-0.01% Azide and with 5% dry 
milk/PBS-0.01% Azide (2.2.1.1). Afterwards, the membrane was incubated with the 
anti-N860 antibody diluted (1:200) in 300 pi of 2% BSA/5% NGS in TBS. The 
incubation was performed in a 0.5 ml tube, overnight at 4C. In parallel, the anti- 
NSK2 antibody was treated in the same way but the membrane was coated with pET 
protein, in order to test non-specific binding of the antibody. The following day the 
supernatant was collected and used as control in immunohistochemistry experiments.
2.2.6 Synaptosomal membranes preparation
Synaptosome membrane preparation is based on the method described in Dodd et al. 
(Dodd et al., 1981). A 35 days old rat was terminally anaesthetised by a rising 
concentration of CO2 . The brain was removed from the skull and placed immediately 
in ice-cold PBS. After removing brain stem and cerebellum, the brain was 
homogenised in 10 ml homogenisation buffer, with 15 strokes, using a glass Teflon
homogeniser. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 x g. The resulting 
PI pellet was resuspended in 5 ml homogenisation buffer, homogenised again with 
10 strokes and centrifuged as before. The supernatants of both centrifugations were 
combined, moved into a thin-walled ultracentrifuge tube and membranes were 
sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 x g, for 1 hour (28,000 rpm in SW28 rotor), 
at 4C. The resulting P2 pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of wash buffer, homogenised 
with five strokes and stirred on ice at 4C for 15 min, in order induce hypotonic lysis 
of vesicles. Subsequently, 2 M sucrose was added to the homogenate to reach a final 
concentration of 0.8 M sucrose. A step gradient of sucrose was prepared as follows: 
the homogenate was placed at the bottom of a thin-walled ultracentrifuge tube and 
carefully overlaid with 10 ml of homogenisation buffer (0.3 M sucrose). This 
gradient was centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 2 hours. Myelin rich membranes, 
forming a white thick band, were retained at the interphase between the 0.8 M and 
0.3 M sucrose, whereas membranes of higher density were sedimented and formed a 
big beige pellet. The 0.3 M and 0.8 M sucrose phases were removed and the high 
density membrane pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of wash buffer containing 1.2 M 
sucrose. The resuspension was homogenised with five strokes to give a 
homogeneous membrane suspension, and then adjusted to 15 ml with wash buffer 
containing 1.2 M sucrose. This suspension was transferred to the bottom of a 38.5 ml 
thin-walled ultracentrifuge tube and carefully overlaid with 9 ml of wash buffer 
containing 0.8 M sucrose and 9 ml of homogenisation buffer (0.3 M sucrose). This 
second step gradient was centrifuged for 2.5 hours at 100,000 x g. Synaptosomes 
were retained at the interphase between 0.8 M and the 1.2 M sucrose, whereas 
mitochondria were pelleted. All fractions of the preparation were collected, 
resuspended in wash buffer in order to reduce the sucrose content, sedimented by 
centrifugation for 30 min at 19,800 x g. The pellets were resuspended in 0.5-1.5 ml 
of wash buffer and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

2.2.7 Estimation of protein concentration
The concentration of the extracted proteins was estimated using the BioRad DC 
Protein Assay Kit, which is based on the Lowry assay (Lowry et al., 1951). The 
assay is based on the reaction between proteins and an alkaline copper tartrate 
solution, and the subsequent reduction of Folin reagent by the copper-treated protein. 
The reduced Folin reagent has a characteristic blue colour with a maximum 
absorbance at the wavelength of 750 nm. Six dilutions of the standard protein BSA 
were prepared, containing 1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2 and 0.1 mg/ml of protein. The samples 
were diluted 1:1, 1:2, 1:4 and 1:10. All dilutions of the standard protein as well as of 
the samples were prepared in dH20 and LDS at the final concentration of 2.5%. The 
reagent A (alkaline copper tartrate solution) was premixed with the reagent S (20 
pl/ml reagent A), and 100 pi of this mix were combined with 20 pi of each sample 
dilution. 800 pi of reagent B (Folin reagent) were added and, after 15 min, the 
absorbance was read at the wavelength of 750 nm with a SmartSpec 3000 
spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). According to the Beer-Lamberf s law, the relationship 
between absorbance and protein concentration is linear. Therefore, the absorbances 
corresponding to the standard protein dilutions are used to fit a linear standard curve. 
The slope and the intercept of this linear standard curve are used to calculate the 
concentration of the samples.
2.2.8 Western blot
2.2.8.1 SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were separated on a 
SDS-polyacrylamide gel that was prepared and run in a mini-gel apparatus (Mini- 
Protean III, Bio-Rad). The stacking gel was made of 3.5% acrylamide 
(AA)/bisacrylamide (BA) and 1 x Upper Tris, whereas the separating gel was made 
of 7.5% or 12% AA/BA and 1 x Lower Tris (Table 1). The polymerization of 
stacking and separating gel was carried out at room temperature using ammonium 
persulfate (AP) and TEMED to start and catalyse the reaction (Table 1). Samples 
containing 100 pg protein were supplemented with 6 x Laemmli buffer, DTT (made 
fresh) at the final concentration of 25 mM and dFUO to reach the final volume of 15- 
40 pi. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 75C and then supplemented with 
iodacetamide (made fresh) at the final concentration of 50 mM. After an incubation 
of 15-30 min in the dark the samples were loaded on the gel. A pre-stained, broad 
range molecular marker (2.1.6) was run in parallel to the samples to estimate the 
molecular weight of the proteins. The electrophoresis was carried out in running 
buffer at a constant voltage of 80 V for the stacking gel and at a constant current of 
17 mA for the separating gel.

2.2.8.2 Transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membranes by tank blot. Proteins 
were transferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran Schleicher & 
Schiill) by standard tank blot, using a Mini Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad). Following 
SDS-PAGE, the stacking gel was removed. The separating gel was equilibrated for 
10 min in transfer buffer. Nitrocellulose membrane was cut to the size of the gel and 
equilibrated for 5-10 min in dt^O, and then for 10 min in transfer buffer. The blot 
was assembled as follows (from the anode to the cathode): one sheet of Whatman 
paper soaked in transfer buffer, the gel, the nitrocellulose membrane and a second 
sheet of Whatman paper soaked in transfer buffer. Care was taken not to trap air 
bubbles. The transfer was carried out in the cold room. The blotting tank was filled 
with pre-cooled transfer buffer and placed on a magnetic stirrer. This allowed the 
continuous mixing of the transfer buffer during the transfer, which was performed for 
50 min at a constant voltage of 100 V. After the transfer, the blot was disassembled, 
the membrane was quickly rinsed in dFhO, and occasionally stained for 2 min in the 
Ponceau S solution, under slow agitation. Afterwards, the membrane was rinsed 
twice in dt^O, to remove the excess of Ponceau S solution, and the transfer 
efficiency was assessed. The membrane was destained by washing the membrane 2-3 
times in PBS until the red staining was completely removed. After further rinses with 
dthO, the membrane was placed on a piece of Whatman paper and dried. At this step 
the membrane could be stored overnight at 4

2.2.8.3 Transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membrane by semi-dry transfer.
Proteins were transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry 
transfer cell (Trans-Blot SD, Bio-Rad). A piece of membrane was cut to the same 
size of the separating gel and equilibrated for 10 min in dTkO. Afterwards, the blot 
was assembled as follow (from the anode to the cathode): one sheet of Whatman 
paper soaked in anode buffer 1, two sheets of Whatman paper soaked in anode buffer 
2, the nitrocellulose membrane soaked in anode buffer 2, and 3 sheets of Whatman 
paper soaked in cathode buffer. Proteins were transferred at constant current of 2.5 
mA/cm2 for 20 min. The efficiency of the transfer was evaluated with Ponceau S 
staining as described above (2.2.8.2).

2.2.8.4 Antibody incubation and staining procedure. After a short rinse in dP^O, 
the membrane was blocked for 1 hour in 10 ml of buffer A (in a plastic container) 
and then incubated for 3 hours with the primary antibody diluted in buffer A, in a 
sealed plastic bag (5 ml, for a complete mini-gel blot). Afterwards, the membrane 
was washed twice for 5 min with 10 ml of buffer A, twice for 10 min with 10 ml of 
buffer B and then incubated for 50 min with the anti-rabbit horse-radish peroxidase 
conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at the dilution of 
1:10,000 in buffer A (10 ml, in a plastic container). Finally, the membrane was 
washed two times in 10 ml of buffer A (5 min), two times in 10 ml of buffer B (10 
min) and once for 10 min in 10 ml of TBS. The ECL solution (Amersham 
Biosciences) was prepared by mixing 1 ml of reagent A with 1 ml of reagent B and
immediately applied on the blot, which was placed on a glass plate. After the 
incubation of exactly 1 min, the glass plate was slightly tilted in order to remove the 
excess of ECL solution. The membrane was then placed in a film cassette, covered 
with a plastic transparent sheet and exposed to Kodak BioMax Light Film for 2-10 
min. Films were developed using a film processor.

2.2.9 Immunoblot of PepSpot membrane
Immunoblot on the PepSpot membrane was performed following the manufacturers 
instructions. The membrane was rinsed for 5 min with 5 ml of methanol, washed 
three times for 10 min with 5 ml of TBS, and then blocked for 2 hours with 5 ml of 
buffer A (2.2.8.4) at room temperature, in a small plastic container. Incubation of the 
immunopurified anti-NSK2 serum diluted in 5 ml of buffer A was carried out for 3 
hours at room temperature in the plastic container. Afterwards, the membrane was 
washed twice for 10 min with 5 ml of TBS-Tween-20 and incubated for 1 hour in the 
secondary antibody (BioRad) solution diluted in buffer A (1:6000, 5 ml). After two 
washes with 5 ml of TBS-Tween-20 (5 min each) and two washes with 5 ml of TBS 
(5 min each), the membrane was incubated for 1 min with 1 ml of ECL solution (500 
pi reagent A plus 500 pi reagent B). Afterwards, the membrane was treated like the 
nitrocelluose membrane for the Western analysis (2.2.8.4). The exposure was 
between 2-10 min. Directly after the exposure, the membrane was regenerated by 
washing three times for 10 min with sterile dFLO, 30 min with regeneration buffer I, 
three times for 10 min with 10 x PBS, three times for 10 min with TBS-Tween-20 
and three times for 5 min with TBS. All the washes were performed at room 
temperature, with 5 ml of the indicated solution in the small plastic container. The 
membrane was stored at 4C in TBS-Tween-20.

2.2.10.1 Maintenance and splitting of HEK 293. HEK 293 cells expressing the 
SK2 channel and HEK 293 wild-type were maintained in T25 tissue culture flasks, in 
HEK 293 medium. The culture was maintained in a cell culture incubator at 37C, 
5% CO2 and 95% humidity. When the cells reached 80-90% confluence they were 
split. The growth medium was aspirated and cells were washed once with 2 ml of 
sterile PBS (Invitrogen). Afterwards, 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA was added to the cells, 
the flask was tilted to uniformly distribute the trypsin-EDTA solution and, right 
away, the solution was removed. The flask was placed in the incubator for 1-2 min 
and, afterwards, 3 ml of HEK 293 medium were added and the cells were 
resuspended. 2-3 drops of cell suspension were added to 5 ml of fresh medium in a 
new T25 flask to maintain the cultures.

2.2.10.2 Plating HEK 293 cells for immunocytochemistry
2.2.10.2.1 Coating coverslips: 22 mm x 22 mm coverslips were washed for 
45 min in absolute ethanol and then rinsed 3 times with 75% ethanol. After 
completely removing the ethanol, they were baked at 200C for 6 hours. Before use, 
coverslips were placed in 6 well plates and coated for 10-30 min with -500 pi of 
poly-D-Lysine (0.1 mg/ml), at room temperature. Afterwards, coverslips were 
washed three times with -2  ml of sterile dH2 0 .
2.2.10.2.2 Plating HEK 293 cells on coverslips: HEK 293 cells were split
(2.2.10.1) and 100 pi of cell suspension were used to determine the cell density using
a Neubauer hemacytometer. For immunocytochemistry, cells were plated on 22 x 22 
mm coverslips coated with poly-D-Lysine (2.2.10.2.1), at the density of 120,000 
cells/coverslip, in HEK 293 medium without serum (2 ml of medium/coverslip in 6 
wells plates). 48 hours after plating immunofluorescence was performed.
2.2.11 Superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurones
2.2.11.1 Coverslip preparation. 13 mm diameter coverslips were washed and baked 
at 200C as described in 2.2.10.2.1. The coverslips used for micro-injection of SCG 
neurones were placed inside SCG culture chambers (2.2.11.2). Alternatively, 
coverslips were placed inside 4 well plates. The coverslips were coated with poly-D- 
lysine and laminin. Coverslips were first incubated for 20-30 min with 250 pi of 
poly-D-lysine solution (0.1 mg/ml) at room temperature. After removing the poly-D- 
lysine solution, coverslips were washed three times with sterile dH20. Subsequently, 
coverslips were incubated with 250 pi of 10 pg/ml of laminin in HBSS for 2-3 hours 
in a cell culture incubator (5% CO2 , 37C, 95% humidity). The laminin solution was 
aspirated, replaced with 250 pi of fresh SCG culture medium (2.2.11.3) and left in 
the incubator until the SCG neurones were plated. Before plating, the coverslips were 
washed once more with SCG culture medium.
2.2.11.2 SCG culture chambers preparation. The chambers were made of a 16 mm
0  glass ring fixed with Sylgard 184 to 22 x 22 mm coverslips. To prepare them, 
Sylgard 184 was distributed on one side of a 16 mm 0  glass ring, which was then 
positioned on a 22 x 22 mm coverslip and baked for 2 hours at 200C. Afterwards, 
the chambers were washed, baked as described in 2.2.10.2.1 and, working under the 
tissue culture hood, placed into sterile 35 mm dishes with sterile forceps. As long as 
the chambers were not damaged, they were re-used several times. After each 
experiment, the chambers were washed in dH2 0  for ~1 hour, washed with ethanol, 
baked (2.2.10.2.1) and placed in 35 mm dishes as described above.
2.2.11.3 Primary SCG culture preparation. One 17-21 days old male Sprague- 
Dawley rat was terminally anaesthetised by a rising concentration of CO2 and 
decapitated. The head was fixed with needles onto a dissecting board so that the 
throat area was exposed. One needle was placed through the skin on each side of the 
neck, and one under the mouth. Another needle was inserted through the trachea and 
pulled gently toward the nose. Artery clamps were used to grip the spinal cord and
were bent downwards. The two SCGs are positioned within the carotid artery 
bifurcation on each side of the neck. Fine forceps were used to find the carotid artery 
and the SCGs were removed. The two ganglia were placed in a 35 mm dish 
containing ~2 ml of fresh L I5, and were cleaned from the surrounding fibres using 
small forceps. After cutting the ganglia in four pieces using small scissors, the L I5 
was removed from the dish with a plastic Pasteur pipette. The tissue was washed 
twice with 2 ml of dissection medium using a plastic Pasteur pipette and, afterwards, 
treated enzymatically in two steps. First, the pieces of ganglia were incubated for 15 
min in a 35 mm dish containing 2 ml of collagenase solution. The incubation was 
performed in the cell culture incubator (5% CO2 , 37C, 95% humidity). After 
removing the collagenase solution, the pieces of ganglia were washed twice with 2 
ml of dissection medium, and then incubated with 2 ml of Trypsin solution, for 30 
min in the cell culture incubator. Afterwards, the ganglia pieces were collected with a 
glass pipette and transferred, capturing as little trypsin solution as possible, into a 
fresh 15 ml tube containing 2 ml of SCG culture medium. Neurones were dissociated 
by sequential mechanical trituration, using a fire polished glass pipette with an open 
tip diameter of 1-0.5 mm. After pipetting up and down 15-20 times, cells were 
centrifuged shortly at 120 x g, stopping the centrifugation as soon as the set g-force 
was reached. The supernatant, containing the dissociated neurones, was transferred 
into a fresh 15 ml tube; the pellet, containing undissociated tissue, was resuspended 
in further 2 ml of SCG culture medium and triturated and centrifuged as described 
above. The supernatants were combined and the procedure was repeated three more 
times. Finally, the combined cell suspension (10 ml) was centrifuged for 5 min at 
120 x g and, after discarding the supernatant, the neurones were resuspended in 1.5 
ml of SCG culture medium. 250 pi of cell suspension were plated on poly-D-lysine 
and laminin coated coverslips (13 mm diameter) (2.2.10.2.1), and incubated in the 
cell culture incubator for 4 hours. Afterwards, 400 pi of SCG culture medium were 
added to each coverslip. The culture was maintained in the cell culture incubator for 
up to four days.

2.2.11.4 cDNA microinjection. Microinjection of cDNA plasmids into SCG 
neurones was performed using an Eppendorf 5246 microinjector and an Eppendorf 
5171 micromanipulator, 24-48 hours after plating. The cDNA was diluted at the 
concentration of 100 ng/pl in injection solution and filtered with Whatman 
VectaSpin Micro filters. The cDNA injection was performed with injection needles 
pulled from capillary glass (1.2 mm O.D. x 0.69 mm I.D.) using a micropipette puller 
(Sutter Instrument, program: heat 525, pull 40, vel.60, time 250). The injection was 
performed applying a constant pressure resulting in a constant flow of the injection 
solution. The injection needle was gently driven into the neuronal nucleus and 
retracted as soon as a slight enlargement of the nuclus was observed (~ 1-2 s).

2.2.12 Embryonic hippocampal and cortical neurones
2.2.12.1 Coating coverslips. 13 mm diameter coverslips were treated as described in 
2.2.10.2.1. Before use, the coverslips were placed in 4 or 24 well plates and coated 
for 1 hour at 37C or over night at room temperature with -300 pi of poly-D-lysine 
(0.1 mg/ml). After removing the poly-D-lysine, coverslips were washed three times 
over a time of 2 hours (-500 pi sterile dH20/wash). The washing was performed in 
the incubator. After the last wash 500 pi of attachment medium was added and 
equilibrated in the incubator (5% CO2 , 37C, 95% humidity) during the preparation 
of the neuronal cultures.
2.2.12.2 Primary hippocampal and cortical neuronal culture preparation.
Hippocampal and cortical neurones were prepared following the method described 
by Brewer (1997). The dissection was performed in a vertical laminar flow hood 
(Envair VLF), wearing gloves and working as sterile as possible. The working 
surface was cleaned with 70% ethanol before starting the dissection. All the tools 
were placed in a plastic beaker containing 70% ethanol and kept under the hood 
during the dissection. An El 7 pregnant rat was sacrificed, the abdomen of the animal 
was wiped with 70% ethanol and the skin of these region was removed using sharp 
scissors. The muscular layer of the abdominal wall was cut using sterile instruments, 
the uterus was removed and placed in a sterile petri dish. The foetuses were removed 
from the uterus, decapitated, and the heads were transferred in a petri dish containing 
cold dissection medium. The brains were isolated as follows: the heads were grasped 
with a curved forceps inserted in the eyes, a rostro-caudal cut beginning from the 
mouth was made through the skin and the skull, with fine scissors; the brains were 
pushed out from the skull by lightly wringing the forceps, collected with a small 
spatula and transferred in cold dissection medium. Each brain was dissected under a 
light microscope in order to isolate the hippocampus and the cortex. After cutting off
the cerebellum and the brainsteam, the two hemispheres were separated and cleaned 
from the meninges using fine forceps. The thalamus was removed from each 
hemisphere in order to uncover the hippocampus, which was then separated from the 
cortex using fine forceps. The dissected hippocampi and cortices were collected 
separately in petri dishes containing ice-cold dissection medium. After all brains 
were dissected, hippocampi and cortices were moved into two different 15 ml plastic 
tubes. The tissue was allowed to settle to the bottom of the tube for 1-2 min, after 
which the dissection medium was removed using a sterile Pasteur pipette and 
replaced with 4.5 ml fresh dissection medium plus 0.5 ml trypsin (2.5%). The 
incubation in the trypsin solution was carried out at 37C for 15 min followed by two 
washes with 5 ml of dissection medium and one with 5 ml of attachment medium to 
stop the enzymatic activity of the trypsin. After removing the medium of the last 
wash, fresh attachment medium was added (1 ml/dissected embryo cortex, 1.5 ml in 
total for the hippocampi). The mechanical trituration was performed first with a 5 ml 
pipette (15 times) and then with a fire polished glass pipette with the tip reduced to 
half of its normal size, until no obvious particles of tissue were left in the solution. 
An aliquot of cells was mixed with 1/10 volume of trypan blue, and the number of 
living cells was determined using a Neubauer hemacytometer. Neurones were plated 
in 500 pi of attachment medium, on poly-D-Lysine coated coverslips (13 mm 
diameter) (2.2.12.1). Neurones were plated at a density of 20,000- 
40,000cells/coverslip in 4 or in 24 wells plates. After 4 hours the attachment medium 
was removed and replaced with maintenance medium. Neurones were maintained in 
a cell culture incubator (5% CO2 , 37C, 95% humidity) up to 3 weeks. Half of the 
medium was replaced with fresh maintenance medium every 5 days.

2.2.12.3 Transfection using lipofectamine. Lipofectamine 2000 was used to 
transfect hippocampal or cortical embryonic cultures between 5 and 8 DIV. 1 pg of 
DNA was mixed to 49 pi of Opti-MEM I, and, in parallel, 1 pi of Lipofectamine 
2000 was mixed to 49 pi of Opti-MEM I. After 5 min the two solutions were 
combined, mixed, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Afterwards, the 
maintenance medium was removed from the neurones and replaced with 400 pi of 
fresh maintenance medium plus the 100 pi mixture of DNA and Lipoectamine 
2000 in Opti-MEM I. The neurones were incubated for 2 hours at 37C in the cell 
culture incubator (5% CO2 , 37C, 95% humidity). After the incubation, the medium 
containing the Lipofectamine solution was removed and replaced with 500 pi of 
fresh maintenance medium, and the neurones were maintained in the incubator. 
Immunofluorescence experiments were performed starting from 24 hours after 
transfection.
2.2.13 Post-natal hippocampal neurones
7-8 Sprague-Dawley rats were dissected on the day of the birth (P0). Each pup was 
decapitated, the skin of the head was cut off and, after doing a lateral cut in the skull 
with fine scissors, the skull was removed using forceps. The brain was isolated, 
transferred in a dish containing ice cold dissection medium and the hippocampus was 
dissected as described in 2.2.12.2. After all the brains were dissected, a small scalpel 
was used to cut each hippocampus in three-four pieces. The tissue was then
transferred into a fresh 15 ml tube, the dissection medium was removed and replaced 
by 5 ml of fresh dissection medium (2.2.12.2). After removing again the dissection 
medium, 5.4 ml of fresh dissection medium plus 0.6 ml trypsin (2.5%) were added to 
the tissue. The incubation in trypsin was carried out for 10 minutes in the incubator, 
gently shaking the tube every 2 minutes. Afterwards, the tissue was washed twice 
with 5 ml of dissection medium and twice with 5 ml of attachment medium
(2.2.12.2). After removing the last washing solution, 3 ml of attachment medium was 
added and neurones were mechanically dissociated by pipetting up and down with a 
P I000 Gilson pipette, until the medium turned turbid, indicating dissociated 
neurones. Undissociated tissue was allowed to sediment at the bottom of the tube for 
~2 min. The supernatant, containing the dissociated neurones, was collected with a 
plastic Pasteur pipette and transferred into a fresh 15 ml tube. 2 ml of attachment 
medium were added to the undissociated tissue and triturated with a glass Pasteur 
pipette ~15 times. Undissociated tisuse was left to settle (~ 2 min) and the 
supernatant was combined with the one from the first trituration step. This procedure 
was repeated a third time with a fire polished pipette whose tip was reduced to half 
the normal size. Finally, the collected cellular suspension (7 ml) was centrifuged at 
120 x g for 5 minutes and the pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of fresh attachment 
medium. The cell density was determined as described in 2.2.12.2. Neurones were 
plated on poly-D-Lysine coated coverslips (13 mm diameter) (2.2.12.1) in 4 well 
plates, at the density of 45,000 neurones/coverslip for electrophysiology experiments 
or 15,000-30,000 neurones/coverslip for immuocytochemistry experiments. After 4 
hours the attachment medium was removed and replaced with maintenance medium
(2.2.12.2). Neurones were maintained as described in 2.2.12.2.
2.2.14 Immunocytochemistry
2.2.14.1 Immunocytochemistry on HEK 293 cells. HEK 293 cells were plated as 
described in 2.2.10.2.2. Immunofluorescence was performed in the 6 well plates, 48 
hours after plating. Cells were rinsed 3 times with ~2 ml of PBS using a plastic 
Pasteur pipette and, afterwards, fixed with 1 ml of 4% PFA-PBS for 10 min at room 
temperature. After rinsing the cells twice with ~2 ml of PBS, they were 
permeabilised with 1 ml of 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min and then washed 
four times (5 min each) with ~2 ml of PBS. 300 pi of blocking buffer were applied
on the coverslips, the six well plate containing the coverslips was placed in a 
humidified box and incubated for 30 min at 37C. Subsequently, the blocking buffer 
was replaced by 300 pi of the primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer (antibody 
dilutions are reported in the results section) and incubated for 1 hour at 37C. Cells 
were rinsed five times and washed three times with -2  ml of PBS (5 min each) 
before incubation for 30 min at 37C with the FITC-conjugated swine anti-rabbit 
secondary antibody (1:30) (Dako) (300 pl/coverslip). Cells were rinsed five times 
followed by three more washes with PBS (five min each) in the dark. Coverslips 
were mounted using ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes), dried overnight and 
sealed the next day with nail polish. Slides were examined with a fluorescence 
microscope (Axiophot, Zeiss). Pictures were taken with a MicroPublisher camera 
(Qlmaging).

2.2.14.2 Immunocytochemistry on SCG neurones. The immunofluorescence on 
SCG neurones was performed either in the 4 well plates or in the SCG culture 
chambers (2.2.11.2). 300 pi of 4% PFA-PBS (2.2.14.1) containing 10% sucrose were 
carefully added to the growth medium. After an incubation time of 30 min at room 
temperature the medium/fixation solution was removed using a plastic Pasteur 
pipette and cells were rinsed twice in -500 pi of PBS. Permeabilisation was 
performed by adding 500 pi of 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min at room 
temperature. Cells were then washed four times with -500 pi of PBS (5 min each). 
The immunocytochemistry was performed as described in 2.2.14.1, using a total 
volume of 200 pi for blocking, primary and secondary antibody incubation. The
primary and secondary antibody dilutions used for the different experiments are 
reported in the results section. Coverslips were mounted as described above 
(2.2.14.1). Samples were examined with a confocal microscope (Axiovert 200, LSM 
510, Zeiss) and pictures were taken with the LSM 510 software. The images were 
analysed using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software.
2.2.14.3 Immunocytochemistry on embryonic hippocampal and cortical 
neurones. Hippocampal and cortical neurones, plated on 13 mm coverslips, were 
treated for immunofluorescence experiments inside 4 well plates. Neurones were 
gently rinsed once with -500 pi of PBS using a plastic Pasteur pipette and 
subsequently fixed for 10 min with 500 pi of 4% PFA-PBS (2.2.14.1) supplemented 
with 4% sucrose at room temperature. After two rinses in PBS, the neurones were 
blocked with 200 pi of blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature. The primary 
antibodies were diluted in 200 pi of blocking buffer (see results sections for antibody 
dilutions), applied to the coverslips and incubated overnight at 4C, in a humidified 
box. The day after, cells were rinsed twice and then washed three times with -500 pi 
PBS (5 min each) to remove the unbound primary antibodies. Subsequently, the 
FITC-conjugated swine anti-rabbit (1:30, Dako) or Cy3 conjugated goat anti-rabbit 
secondary antibody (1:600, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were diluted in incubation 
buffer (200pl/coverslip) and applied to the coverslips for 1 hour at room temperature, 
in the dark. Neurones were finally rinsed two times and washed three times, in the 
dark, in PBS (5 min each). Coverslips were mounted, examined and pictures were 
taken as described in (2.2.14.1).

2.2.14.4 Immunofluorescence on post-natal hippocampal neurones. The
Tyramide Amplification System (TSA, Molecular Probes) was used to visualise the 
SK2 protein in post-natal hippocampal cultures. TSA is an enzyme based detection 
method which utilizes the enzymatic activity of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to 
catalyse the deposition of a fluorophore labeled tyramide reagent. After the binding 
of the primary antibody to the target protein, the secondary detection is performed 
using a HRP-conjugated antibody. The amplification of the signal is conferred by the 
turnover of multiple dye-tyramide substrates per peroxidase, which results in the 
deposition of numerous fluorophore labels in vicinity of the immobilised HRP- target 
interaction site.
Hippocampal neurones, plated on 13 mm coverslips, were treated for 
immunofluorescence experiments inside 4 well plates. The growth medium was 
gently removed from the wells using a Pasteur pipette, neurones were gently rinsed 
once with PBS, and then fixed for 10 min at room temperature with -500 pi of 4% 
PFA-PBS (2.2.14.1) supplemented with 4% sucrose. After two washes with PBS (5 
minutes each), neurones were permeabilised with -500 pi of 0.3% Triton X-100 for 
15 min. After rinsing the cultures twice and washing two times with PBS (5 min 
each), the neurones were incubated for 1 hour, at room temperature, with 200 pi of 
2% H2 O2 to block the activity of the endogenous HRP. The H2O2 solution was 
removed and the cultures were blocked with 200 pi of 1% blocking reagent 
(Molecular probes) in PBS. The affinity-purified anti-NSK2 was applied in blocking 
buffer (200 pl/coverslip), and incubated overnight at 4C. Neurones were rinsed 
twice and washed in PBS for 3 times (5 min each) to remove the unbound primary 
antibodies, and then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with 200 pi of HRP- 
conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200, T20922, Molecular Probes) in 
blocking buffer. After rinsing the cultures twice and washing for 3 times in PBS (5 
min each), the Tyramide-Alexa Fluor 488 reagent (1:100 in amplification buffer 
containing 0.0015% H2O2) (Molecular probes) was added to the neurones (100 
pl/coverslip) and incubated in the dark for 5 min. Neurones were washed in the dark 
three times (5 min each). Coverslips were mounted, examined and pictures were 
taken as described in (2.2.14.1 and 2.2.14.2 ).
2.2.15 Immunohistochemistry
2.2.15.1 Tissue preparation and slicing. Male Sprague Dawley rats at the age of 
PI, P3, P6, P I2, P21 and P25 were anesthetised with an intraperitoneal injection of 
pentobarbital sodium (Euthanal, Merial) at the dose of 4.5 mg/100 g of body weight. 
When the animals were completely asleep they were intracardially perfused in order 
to preserve a good morphology of the tissues. Briefly, the anesthetised animals were 
fixed on a metal grid by tying the arms and the legs to the grid. The skin on the chest 
and the abdomen of the animal was removed. Afterwards, the muscular layer was cut 
horizontally with a small scalpel on the bases of the chest, in order to expose the end 
of the sternum. The end of the sternum was gripped with artery clamps and pulled up 
gently while cutting the muscular layer parallel to the ribs, and then laterally on both 
sides upward across the ribs and parallel to the lungs. Afterwards, the diaphragm was 
cut from the left to the right side and, working fast, the canula (drawing up needle 
18G 11/2 for P21-P25; needle 23G 11/4 for P12; needle 25G 5/8 for PI, P3 and P6) 
was introduced in the left ventricle while holding the heart with the fingers. Ice-cold 
phosphate buffer (PB) containing 50 U/ml heparin was infused, and, right away, the 
right atrium was cut for drainage. After most of the blood had been flushed out of the 
system (-100 ml for P21 animals, -50 ml for PI, P3, P6 and P12 animals), the PB 
was substituted by an ice cold, freshly made, solution of 4% PFA-PB. The perfusion 
was carried out until the neck of the animal became stiff (-100 ml PB for P21 
animals, -50 ml PB for PI, P3, P6 and P12 animals). The brains were dissected out 
of the skull, post-fixed by immersion in 4% PFA-PB for 1-4 hours and stored in PB- 
0.01% Azide containing 30% sucrose, at 4C, for up to 2 weeks. Alternatively the 
brains were stored at -80C after cryoprotection for 3 days at 4C in 30% sucrose in 
PB-0.01% Azide and freezing in powdered dry ice. Coronal and sagittal sections (45 
pm thickness for P21 brains, 55-60 pm thickness for PI, P3, P6, P12 brains) were cut 
using a sliding microtome (Leica SM2000 R), collected with a soft brush and 
transferred in 24 well plates filled with PBS-0.01% Azide. Sections were stored up to 
2 weeks at 4C.

2.2.15.2 Immunohistochemistry. The immunohistochemistry experiments were 
performed on free floating sections in 24 well plates. Sections, stored in PBS-0.01% 
Azide, were transferred by means of a brush into a fresh 24 well plate containing 300 
pl/well of IHC blocking solution and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, with 
slow agitation. Subsequently, sections were transferred with a brush into another 24 
well plate containing 300 pl/well of the affinity-purified primary antibody diluted in 
incubation buffer A. The incubation was performed overnight at 4C, on a shaking 
platform. All the following incubations were performed at room temperature. The 
day after, sections were washed with -500 pi of TBS ( 2 x 1 5  min and 1 x 30 min). 
Washes were performed on a rotating platform and the solution exchange was 
performed by moving the sections into 24 well plates containing fresh TBS. When 
many sections were processed at the same time, 15 mm Netwell inserts in 
combination with 12 well plates were used to perform the washes. After the washes, 
sections were incubated with 300 pi of the biotinylated secondary antibody 
(Vectastain Elite ABC Kit) diluted 1:200 in incubation buffer B for 1 hour, with slow 
agitation. After 1 hour of washes (performed as before: 2 x 1 5  min and 1 x 30 min) 
the sections were incubated with 300 pi of ABC (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit, 10 pi A+ 
10 pi B per ml of TBS) for 1 hour on the shaking platform and then washed again in 
TBS (2 x 15 min and 1 x 30 min). The antibody binding was visualised by using 
DAB as substrate of the peroxidase enzyme (DAB substrate kit for peroxidase) plus 
nickel, which was added to the reaction in order to obtain a grey-black stain. The 
staining reaction was carried out by applying 300 pi of DAB solution to the sections 
for 4-6 min, in the 24 well plates, in the dark. Afterwards, DAB was removed with a 
pipette, sections were shortly rinsed in dH20  and then washed three times for 10 min 
with TBS.

and P3 brains were cryoprotected with sucrose (10% sucrose in PB for 10 min at 
room temperature and then 30% sucrose overnight at 4C) and permeabilised by 
temperature shock in dry ice as follows. A beaker containing acetone was 
equilibrated on dry ice. Sections were placed into a 10 ml tube using a brush (two or 
three sections can be processed at the same time). The tube containing the sections 
was immersed in the beaker containing cold acetone for 30 s. The sections were 
removed right away from the tube by using a brush and washed three times for 10 
minutes in TBS. Sections were blocked in IHC blocking solution for 1 hour at room 
temperature and then incubated over night at 4C with the primary antibody diluted 
in Incubation buffer A. Secondary antibody incubation and DAB staining were 
performed as described in 2.2.15.2.

2.2.15.4 Immunhistochemistry using the TSA Biotin System.
Immunohistochemistry experiments with anti-N860 antibody were performed using 
the TSA Biotin System (PerkinElmer), which is based on the use of the biotin-
labelled tyramide reagent in combination with the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Fig. 1). 
After the blocking, primary antibody and secondary antibody incubations (performed 
as described in 2.2.15.2), the sections were incubated with 300 pi of the ABC reagent 
(4 pi A+ 4 pi B per ml of TBS) for 1 hour, on a rotating platform. After washing four 
times for 10 minutes, 250 pi of the biotin-labelled tyramide reagent solution (13.3 pi 
tyramide reagent per ml of amplification buffer, PerkinElmer) was applied on the 
sections for 7 min. The sections were washed three times for 10 minutes with slow 
agitation, and then incubated again for 1 hour with the ABC reagent, on the shaking 
platform. Finally, after washing the sections (2.2.15.2) the antibody binding was 
visualised by using DAB (2.2.15.2).

2.2.15.5 Immunofluorescence using the TSA Biotin System. The TSA Biotin 
System (PerkinElmer) was also used for immunofluorescence experiments on brain 
sections. The experiment was performed as described in 2.2.15.4 until the incubation 
in ABC reagent (step d of Fig. 2.1). Afterwards, sections were washed and incubated 
for 2 hours in 200 pi of FITC-avidin (1.67 pi per ml of TBS), in the dark. Sections
were washed three times for 20 min with TBS, mounted on Super Frost Plus slides 
and air-dried overnight, in the dark. The sections were mounted with Pro-Long 
Antifade mounting medium.
2.2.15.6 Mounting and analysis. The free floating sections were mounted on Super 
Frost Plus slides and air-dried overnight. A Tissue-Tek slide staining unit was used, 
the day after, to dehydrate the sections in an ascending series of ethanol (50%, 70%, 
95% and 2 x 100%, 5 min each), followed by two incubations (5 min) in Histo-Clear. 
Afterwards, the slides were mounted with DePex mounting medium and covered 
with glass coverslips (24 x 60 mm). Sections were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot 
microscope and pictures were taken with a MicroPublisher camera (Qlmaging). 
Brain regions were identified using The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates 
(Paxinos and Watson, 1997). Immunihistochemistry and analysis were performed at 
least on three brains.
2.2.15.7 Hematoxylin counterstaining. When hematoxylin counterstaining was 
performed, nickel was omitted from the DAB reaction in order to obtain a brown- 
yellow staining easily distinguishable from the blue hematoxylin staining. Sections 
were mounted on Super Frost Plus slides and dried overnight. The day after the 
slides were stained for exactly 2 min in a glass slide holder filled with hematoxylin 
Mayer solution (Fluka) and, subsequently, developed under running tap water for 10 
min. The sections were dried for at least 2-3 hours (or overnight), dehydrated and 
mounted in DePex as described in 2.2.15.6.
2.2.16 Standard molecular biology techniques
2.2.16.1 Restriction enzyme digest of plasmid DNA. Digests were performed in a
1.5 ml tube containing DNA, the appropriate restriction enzyme, buffer and dH^O. 
For analytical digests 200-300 ng of DNA were used in a volume of 20 pi. For 
digests of vector and fragment isolation, 1 pg of DNA was used in a volume of 40 pi. 
The digest was incubated for 1 hour at a temperature optimal for the selected 
restriction enzyme. The reaction was stopped by adding DNA sample buffer
2.2.16.2 Dephosphorylation of plasmid DNA. Following restriction digest, cloning 
vectors were subjected to dephosphorylation in order to prevent self ligation of 
plasmid DNA. Alkaline phosphatase was used to remove terminal 5 -phosphate 
groups. The dephosphorylation mixture contained the digest, 1 U of alkaline 
phosphatase and the alkaline phosphatase buffer. The dephosphorylation was carried 
out at 37C for 1 hour and the reaction was stopped by adding sample buffer
2.2.16.3 Agarose gel electrophoresis of cDNA. Separation of the digested DNA 
was carried out by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA was separated on 0.7-2% TAE 
agarose gels containing 40 pg/ml ethidium bromide. The electrophoresis was carried 
out at 80-100 mV for 30-60 min. 1 kb and/or 100 bp DNA ladders (2.1.6) were used 
as molecular weight standards. The DNA was visualised under UV-light. Gel images 
were documented as video prints using a gel documentation system.

2.2.16.4 Gel extraction of DNA fragments. DNA fragments were visualised using 
UV light (365 nm) and the fragment of interest was excised from the agarose gel 
using a scalpel. To recover the DNA, the Nucleospin Extract kit was used according 
to the manufacturers instructions. Briefly, agarose gel slices were melted at 65C in 
buffer NT1 (300 pi/100 mg agarose gel) and the resulting dissolved mixture was 
loaded on a column. After two washes with buffer NT3, the DNA bound to the 
column membrane was eluted with buffer NE pre-heated at 70C to increase the yield 
of DNA elution.

2.2.16.5 Phenol/chloroform extraction of DNA. Occasionally, phenol/chloroform 
extraction was performed to remove proteins following the restriction digestion. 
DNA samples were mixed with an equal volume of phenol and two-three drops of 
chloroform, vortexed for 30 seconds and centrifuged for 2 min at maximum speed 
(14,000 x g). The aqueous phase was transferred into another tube and the same 
volume of chloroform was added. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged again 
for 2 min at maximum speed. The aqueous phase was transferred into a new tube and 
DNA was precipitated.
2.2.16.6 Ethanol precipitation of DNA. The DNA solution was adjusted to 400 mM 
LiCl and three volumes of 100% ethanol were added. DNA was precipitated at -80C 
for at least 30 min or at -20C overnight. Afterwards samples were centrifuged for 15 
min at 14.000 x g and the resulting pellet was washed with 75% ethanol. After the

2.2.16.9 Isolation of DNA from bacterial cultures
Small scale preparation o f plasmid DNA : For small scale preparation of plasmid 
DNA, single colonies were grown overnight at 37C in 5 ml LB medium containing 
100 pg/ml of ampicillin. DNA was isolated using the Nucleobond Plasmid kit, 
following the manufacturers protocol. Briefly, the 5 ml culture was centrifuged for 5 
min at 3,200 x g and the pellet was resuspended in 250 pi of buffer A l. 250 pi of 
lysis buffer A2 was added and, after inverting the tubes 6-8 times, 300 pi of 
neutralisation buffer A3 was added and gently mixed. The cell debris was 
precipitated by centrifugation at 11,000 x g for 5 min and the clear lysate was loaded 
into a NucleoSpin column. After centrifugation (30 s at 11,000 x g), the flow through 
was discarded and the membrane was washed with 600 pi buffer A4. Plasmid DNA 
was eluted from the membrane with 50 pi of AE buffer pre-warmed at 70C.
Medium scale preparation o f plasmid DNA: For medium scale plasmid DNA 
preparation, single colonies were grown in 40 ml of LB medium containing 100 
pg/ml of ampicillin and the Nucleobond AX 100 kit was used for plasmid DNA

extraction. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 x g for 10 min and 
the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 4 ml buffer SI. Subsequently, 4 ml of the lysis 
buffer S2 were added, mixed and then 4 ml of S3 buffer were added. The mix was 
centrifuged at 3,200 x g for 10 min at 4C and the cleared lysate was filtered through 
a paper filter (Macherey-Nagel). The flow through was collected and loaded on a 
Nucleobond AX 100 cartridge pre-equilibrated with 2.5 ml of buffer N2. 
Subsequently, the cartridge was washed twice with 5 ml of buffer N3 and the DNA 
was then eluted with 5 ml of buffer N5. The plasmid DNA was precipitated by 
mixing the eluate with 0.7-0.8 volumes of isopropanol and centrifuging at 16,000 x g 
for 30 min at 4C. The precipitated DNA was then washed with 75% ethanol and 
centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 10 min at 4C. The plasmid DNA pellet was dissolved 
in dt^O  at the final concentration of 1 pg/pl.

2.2.16.10 Amplification of DNA using PCR. Specific DNA sequences were 
amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The reaction was performed using 
either KOD Hot Start DNA or Pfu DNA polymerases.
PCR with KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase: KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase is a 
premixed complex of KOD Hi Fi DNA polymerase and two monoclonal antibodies 
that inhibit the enzymes DNA polymerase and 3 exonuclease activities during PCR 
assembly and initial denaturation step. Reactions were made in a final volume of 100 
pi containing: 1 x KOD buffer, 1 mM MgS0 4 , 0.2 mM dNTPs, 100 pmol of each 
primer, 10-20 ng of template DNA, 1 U of KOD DNA Polymerase and sterile dH20. 
PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase: Reactions were made in a final volume of 100 pi. A 
mix (60 pi) was prepared containing: 0.2 mM dNTPs, 100 pmol of each primer, 10- 
20 ng of template DNA and sterile dH20. This mix was denatured for 3 min at 94C, 
and then a second mixture (40 pi) was added containing: 10 pi of Pfu buffer (10 x),
2.5 U of Pfu and sterile dH20. Then the PCR was started.
The reagents were assembled on ice in 0.5 ml PCR tubes. PCRs were performed in a 
PCR System 2400 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) under the following 
conditions:
 Initial denaturation: 94C, 3 min
 Denaturation: 94C, 30 s
 Annealing: XC (TM), 30-45 s
 Elongation: 72C, 20 s/kb for KOD Hot Start -1 min/kb for Pfu.
 Repeats of steps 2 through 4: 15 cycles or occasionally 30
 Final elongation: 72C, 10 min
The annealing temperature (TM) was depending on the melting temperature of the 
primer with the lowest TM and was calculated following the formula: TM= 4 x (G+C) 
+ 2x (A+T).
2.2.16.11 Splicing by overlap extensions. Splicing by overlap extensions (SOE) 
(Horton et al., 1989; Ho, 1989) was used to introduce single or multiple amino acids 
mutations (Fig. 2.2 A) and to generate chimeras (Fig. 2.2 B). SOE consists of three 
separate PCRs. KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase was employed in the PCR reactions 
(1) and (2) (Fig 2.2 A and 2.2 B) following the protocol described at 2.2.16.10. The 
two PCR products were separated on an agarose gel, extracted as described in
2.2.16.4 and used as template for the third PCR reaction ((3) in Fig 2.2 A and 2.2 B).
1/3 of each of the two extracted fragments were assembled in a tube with 1 x KOD 
buffer , 1 mM MgS0 4  and 45 pi of dH20. The tube was submerged in a beaker with 
800 ml of boiling water until the water reached room temperature. This procedure 
maximises the annealing of complementary sequences. Afterwards, 0.2 mM dNTPs 
and 1 u KOD DNA polymerase were added and a 10 min elongation step at 72 C 
was performed. In this step, the extension of the annealed area by DNA polymerase 
produces a double-stranded DNA molecule in which the original molecules are 
spliced together. After the elongation, the two flanking primers (100 pmol/100 pi) 
were added to the reaction mix and a PCR reaction was performed as described in 
2.2.16.10.

generation. A: Schematic representation of site-directed mutagenesis. The dsDNA are represented by 
lines and primers are represented by arrows. The hybrid primers b and c introduce the desired 
mutations (grey box) and are used in two separate PCRs, (1) and (2), in combination with the two 
flanking primers a and d. The PCR products o f the reactions (1) and (2), carrying the mutated region 
(grey box) and having complementary ends, are used as template in PCR (3). After denaturation, the 
two PCR products anneal at the overlapping region, are extended 3' by DNA polymerase (dashed line) 
and then they are further amplified by the PCR with the flanking primers a and d. B: Schematic 
representation of chimeras generation by SOE. Two different dsDNA are represented as solid lines 
(left) or as a broken lines (right). The hybrid primers b and c match their template cDNAs at their 3' 
portions whereas the 5' portions are designed so that they are complementary to each other. In PCR 
(1) the primer b is used in combination with the flanking primer a, and, in PCR (2), c is used in 
combination with the flanking primer d. The PCR products of the PCRs (1) and (2) are used as 
template in PCR (3). The two PCR products are denatured, the 3' is extended by the DNA polymerase 
activity (dashed line) and then they are amplified by PCR with the flanking primers a and d.
2.2.16.12 Sequencing of DNA. Purified DNA plasmids containing modified 
sequences were verified by sequencing with the BigDye Terminator Cycle 
Sequencing Kit 1.1 or 2 and an ABI PRISM 3100-AVANT automated DNA 
capillary sequencer (Applied Biosysems). When the BigDye Kit 1.1 was used, the 
sequencing reaction was performed in a volume of 10 pi, containing: 200 ng of
DNA, 2 pi of BigDye Kit 1.1, 3.2 pmol primer and sterile dH20. Alternatively, when 
the BigDye Kit 2 was used, the reaction was performed in 20 pi, containing: 300-600 
ng DNA, 4 pi of BigDye Kit 2, 3.2 pmol primer and sterile dt^O. The PCR was 
performed in a PCR System 2400 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). Initial 
denaturation was 30 s at 94C followed by 25 cycles: denaturation (94C, 30 s), 
annealing (50C, 30 s) and extension step (60C, 4 min). The reaction was stopped 
by cooling to 4C. 10 pi of sterile dt^O were added to the 10 pi reactions performed 
with Big Dye 1.1. Afterwards, the PCR product was precipitated by adding 2 pi of 
NaAc (3M NaAc, pH 5.2, in combination with BigDye Kit 1.1; 3M NaAc, pH 4.6, in 
combination with BigDye Kit 2), 50 pi of 100% ethanol and 10 min incubation on 
ice. The mix was centrifuged at 4C for 15 min, at 16,000 x g. The supernatant was 
discarded, the pellet washed with 250 pi of 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 4C for 
another 15 min at 16,000 x g. The supernatant was removed, the pellet was air-dried 
and resuspended in 10 pi of HiDi formamide loading buffer. Sequences were 
analysed using the Lasergene (DNASTAR) analysis suite.

CHAPTER 3 
Characterisation of the anti-NSK2 antibody
3.1. Introduction
One of the aims of this thesis is the study of the distribution of SK2 a  subunit in the 
rat brain. For this purpose, a rSK2-directed polyclonal antibody was generated. This 
chapter describes the affinity purification and characterisation of this antibody 
performed in order to: (1) test the ability of the antibody to recognise native rSK2 
protein in immunocytochemistry and in Western analysis; (2) demonstrate the 
specificity of the antibody; and (3) identify the epitope to which the antibody 
specifically binds.
3.2 Antibody purification
A specific antibody was raised in rabbit against a fusion protein of glutathione-S- 
transferase (GST) and a region of the N-terminal domain of rSK2 a  subunit (Fig. 3.1 
A). This sequence, corresponding to the amino acids (aa) 23-83 (GenBank accession 
no. U69882), is unique to SK2, as no significant homology to the corresponding 
region of SKI and SK3 was found. Two animals were immunized with the GST- 
NSK2 fusion protein; therefore, two different sera, named 1973g and 1974g, were 
obtained (Biogenes, Germany). ELISA assays, performed by Biogenes to determine 
the antibody titer to the GST-NSK2 antigen, indicated that there was no difference 
between the two sera. The experiments shown in this chapter refer to the 1973g 
serum, unless specified.
In order to remove anti-GST and other non-specific immunoglobulins present in the 
generated sera, the antibody was affinity-purified. The affinity purification was 
employed using the pET-NSK2 fusion protein, which comprises the same region of 
the channel used to raise the antibody (NSK2) fused with thioredoxin (Trx) (Fig. 3.1 
A). The pET-NSK2 fusion protein was immobilised on a solid support. When the 
serum was applied, only the immunoglobulins that recognised the NSK2 antigenic 
determinant were retained on the support and purified. Two different affinity 
purification methods were used. To purify small amounts of serum (20-50 pi), the 
membrane purification method (2.2.1) was used. The pET-NSK2 fusion protein was 
adsorbed to a nitrocellulose membrane. The serum was then incubated with the 
membrane and, subsequently, the bound antibody was eluted with acidic and alkaline 
buffers. Larger amounts of serum (500 pi) were purified by the column purification 
method (2.2.2). In this case, the antibody was purified over columns of SulfoLink
agarose beads coupled to the pET-NSK2 fusion protein. The elutions were performed 
as described in 2.2.2A, and the OD28 0  was measured. The three eluates with the 
highest antibody concentration were mixed in a fraction called E l; the three eluates 
with the next highest concentration of antibody were combined in E2 and so on. The 
eluates contained the following amount of antibody: El -100 pg, E2 -49 pg, E3 -32 
pg and E4 -25 pg.
Following every purification, ELISA assays were performed to determine the titer of 
the purified antibody. All the elution fractions and the unpurified serum were used in 
ELISA experiments to test the sensitivity to the pET-NSK2 fusion protein and, in 
parallel, to GST. Figure 3.1 B, C shows a representative ELISA experiment of a 
membrane purification of the anti-NSK2 1974g serum. The ELISA performed with 
pET-NSK2 fusion protein (Fig 3.1 B) showed that the elution fractions contained 
high titers of antibody directed against NSK2, with the acidic elution exhibiting 
higher sensitivity for pET-NSK2 compared with the basic fraction. The ELISA 
performed against GST indicated that the high levels of GST-directed antibodies, 
present in the unpurified serum, were removed with the purification and hardly any 
signal for GST was measured in the two elution fractions (Fig. 3.1 C), suggesting 
that the antibody purification was achieved. After ELISA, the acidic and alkaline 
elutions were pooled and used in the experiments reported in 3.4. Comparable results 
were obtained using ELISA assay on the membrane purified anti-NSK2 1973g 
serum, which was employed in some of the experiments shown in 3.3. Moreover, a 
typical ELISA experiment performed with a column purification of the anti-NSK2 
1973g serum is shown in Figure 3.1 D and E. The assay was performed on the E1-E4 
elution fractions and on the serum. As reported in Figure 3.1 D, El and E2 were the 
elution fractions that contained the highest levels of the antibodies directed against 
NSK2, whereas a lower signal was detected in E3 and E4. Figure 3.1 E shows that 
only a very low sensitivity for GST was detected in all the elution fractions, 
indicating, also in this case, that the antibody purification was accomplished. The 
elution fraction El was used for the experiments described later in this chapter (3.3 
and 3.4).

was fused to Trx. B, C: ELISA experiment performed to determine the titer to pET-NSK2 (B) and to 
GST (C) of the acidic and basic elutions of the anti-NSK2-1974g membrane-purified antibody and of 
the anti-NSK2-1974g serum. 96 well immuno-plates were adsorbed either with pET-NSK2 fusion 
protein (B) or with GST (C) at the concentration of 3pg/pl. This concentration was shown to give 
maximum signal in initial tests that were performed by coating the 96 well plates with different 
concentrations o f protein. Seven serial dilution steps were prepared for the anti-NSK2-1974g serum 
and for the acidic and basic elutions. The starting dilution was 1:150 and the dilution factor o f 3.5 was 
used, leading to the following dilutions: 1:150; 1:525; 1:1,837; 1:6,431; 1:22,509; 1:78,782; and 
1:275,739. The background signal was measured in the absence o f primary antibody. Absorbance was

measured at the wavelength of 405 nm and plotted against the logi0 o f the antibody dilutions. 
Background subtraction was not performed because the absorbance recorded in absence of primary 
antibody was close to zero. A high titer of NSK2-directed antibodies was found in the acidic and in 
the basic elutions (B), whereas almost no GST sensitivity was present after the purification (C). D, E: 
ELISA experiment performed to test the sensitivity to pET-NSK2 (D) and to GST (E) of the four 
elution fractions E1-E4 of the anti-NSK2 1973g antibody purified by the column purification method 
and of the anti-NSK2-1973g serum. The experiments were performed as described for B and C but the 
following antibody dilutions were used: 1:100; 1:350; 1:1,225; 1:4,287; 1:15,006; 1:52,521; and 
1:183,826. High signal for pET-NSK2 fusion protein was measured in the El and E2 fractions, 
whereas a low signal was detected in E3 and E4 (D). High titers o f GST-directed antibodies were 
found in the serum but not in the elution fractions. All elution fractions showed low sensitivity for

In order to test whether the anti-NSK2 antibody recognised the native SK2 subunit 
specifically, immunofluorescence experiments were performed with the anti-NSK2 
serum and the purified antibody. First, the anti-NSK2 serum was tested on HEK 293 
cells stably expressing the rSK2 subunit. Using the serum, immunofluorescence was 
visible in the membrane and in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3.2 A). On the contrary, no signal 
was observed with the same antibody on the HEK wild type cells (Fig. 3.2 B), or on 
HEK cells stably expressing rSK3 (M. Stocker personal communication), indicating 
the specificity of the detected signal. The Figure 3.2 C shows the bright-light picture 
of the same cells shown in Figure 3.2 B.

was observed whereas no immunostaining was detected in B. C: Bright-light picture of the cells 
pictured in B. A-C: FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used for signal detection 
(1:30). Scale bar: 20 pm.
The same cell line that expresses rSK2 was used in immunofluorescence experiments 
with the affinity-purified anti-NSK2 antibody (membrane purification, 1:200) and, as
shown in Figure 3.3 A, a clear immunofluorescence signal was observed in the cell 
membrane and cytoplasm. This result was similar to the signal observed in 
experiments performed with the serum. The specificity of this immunostaining was 
also confirmed by preadsorption experiments. Indeed, preincubation of the purified 
antibody with saturating amounts of the fusion protein pET-NSK2 completely 
abolished the ability of the antibody to detect SK2 in the rSK2-expressing cells (Fig.
3.3 B). In addition to preadsorption experiments, a control experiment was 
performed where the purified antibody was preincubated under the same conditions 
but the fusion protein was omitted. This experiment was performed to demonstrate 
that the lack of signal observed in the preadsorption experiments is due to specific 
binding of the antibody to the fusion protein and not to non-specific adsorption of the 
antibody to the plastic tube in which the preadsorption was carried out. As expected, 
when the antibody preincubation was performed in absence of fusion protein, the 
detected signal (Fig. 3.3 D) was similar to the staining shown in Figure 3.3 A. 
Identical results were obtained when immunofluorescence experiments were 
performed using the anti-NSK2 antibody purified by column purification. 
Immunocytochemistry that was performed with this purified antibody on rSK2- 
expressing HEK 293 cells showed the same distribution pattern observed using the 
membrane purification. Taken together, these experiments indicate that the serum 
and the immunopurified anti-NSK2 antibody were able to recognise recombinantly 
expressed rSK2 a  subunits. Furthermore, the experiments demonstrated that the 
detected signal was specific, as no staining was generated by the serum in 
untransfected HEK 293 cells or by the purified antibody preadsorbed with the 
antigen in rSK2-expressing cells.
FIGURE 3.3: Immunocytochemistry with the affinity-purified anti-NSK2 antibody on HEK 293 
cells stably expressing rSK2. A: Immunofluorescence on HEK 293 cells that express rSK2 using the 
affinity-purified anti-NSK2 antibody (1:200). A membrane purification preparation was used in this 
experiment. Membrane and cytoplasmic staining was observed. B: Antigen blocking: the anti-NSK2 
antibody (1:200) was preincubated with 20 [ig/pl pET-NSK2 fusion protein for three hours at room 
temperature. No immunofluorescence signal was detected. C: Bright-light picture o f the cells pictured 
in B. D: Control for the antigen blocking: the anti-NSK2 antibody (1:200) was preincubated in the 
same conditions indicated in B but the pET-NSK2 fusion protein was omitted. A, D: FITC-conjugated 
anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used for signal detection (1:30). Scale bar: 20 pm.
Subsequently, the anti-NSK2 antibody was used in Western blot analysis in order to 
estimate the antibody sensitivity in this assay. The unpurified and the purified anti- 
NSK2 antibody were tested in immunoblots of serial dilutions of the fusion protein 
pET-NSK2. The lowest amount of fusion protein detected by the unpurified anti- 
NSK2 antibody was 0.5 ng (Fig. 3.4 A). The lowest amount of fusion protein 
detected by the purified anti-NSK2 antibody was -5 ng (Fig. 3.4 B). However, taking 
into consideration the signal intensity of the band, it is possible that 2-3 ng of fusion 
protein might be still detected. Moreover, as shown in Figure 3.1 A, the rSK2 
sequence corresponds to -25% of the total length of the pET-NSK2 fusion protein. 
This has to be considered for the actual detection limit of the antibodies, which is 
four times higher than the detection limit observed. Therefore, the purified antibody 
should be able to detect around 20 ffnol of SK2 protein.

separated on 12% SDS page and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by semi-dry transfer. A: 
Immunoblot performed with the anti-NSK2 serum (1:1,000) showed that 0.5 ng was the lowest 
amount o f pET-NSK2 protein detected. B: Western blot using the membrane affinity-purified anti- 
NSK2 antibody (1:300) indicated that 5 ng was the lowest amount of fusion protein detected. A, B: 
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000; BioRad) and ECL chemiluminescent system were used 
for signal detection.
After estimating the detection limit, the subunit specificity of the anti-NSK2 
antibody was assessed in Western analysis. HEK 293 cells were transiently 
transfected with the plasmids that code for rSKl, rSK2 or rSK3 subunits, and lysates 
were prepared. These lysates and the lysate from untransfected HEK 293 cells were 
then analysed in Western blot using the anti-NSK2 serum. As shown in Figure 3.5 A, 
the antibody recognised a single band of -50 kDa in rSK2-transfected cells (Fig. 3.5 
A, third lane). The molecular weight of this band deviates from the 63 kDa predicted 
from the primary sequence of rSK2 a subunit. However, no bands were detected in 
untransfected cells (Fig 3.5 A, first lane) and no cross-reactivity was observed with 
the other SK subunits, as no bands were detected on cells that were transfected with 
rSKl (Fig. 3.5 A, second lane) or with rSK3 cDNA (Fig. 3.5 A, fourth lane). 
Moreover, the immunopurified anti-NSK2 antibody was used in Western blot of 
rSK2-expressing HEK 293 cells to demonstrate that also the purified antibody 
detected a band of the same molecular weight (Fig. 3.5 B). These analyses show that 
the immunopurified antibody is subunit-specific. Furthermore, these experiments 
confirmed that the unpurified and purified anti-NSK2 antibody recognise the SK2 a  
subunit, which shows a smaller molecular weight than expected.
Finally, the affinity-purified anti-NSK2 antibody was used to study the native 
expression of the SK2 subunit in the rat brain by Western blot of rat brain 
synaptosomal membranes. This antibody detected two predominant bands. In 
addition to the -50 kDa band, which is likely to represent SK2, a second band of -75
kDa was visible (Fig. 3.5 C, first lane). This second band most likely corresponds to 
a novel SK2 variant recently identified by our group (for details see Chapter 5). 
Additionally, a weaker band of higher molecular weight (-130 kDa) was also 
sometimes detected. This band might represent protein aggregates of SK2 a  
subunits. The two SK2 bands of 50 and 75 kDa were completely eliminated when the 
antibody was preadsorbed with saturating amount of pET-NSK2 protein (Fig. 3.5 B, 
second lane), confirming the specificity of the antibody in the native tissue. 
Surprisingly, the band that corresponds to protein aggregates was not preadsorbed.
In conclusion, all these experiments indicated that the affinity-purified anti-NSK2 
antibody is a specific tool to study the immunohistochemical distribution of SK2 a 
subunit in the rat brain.

membrane lysates of untransfected HEK 293 cells and HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with

bands were detected in untransfected HEK 293 (first lane) and in cells transfected with rSKl (second

(third lane). B: Western blot on HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with rSK2. The lysates were

100 pg of synaptosomal membranes o f 35-days-old rat brain were separated on 7.5% SDS page and

purified anti-NSK2 antibody (1:300). Two immunoreactive bands were detected: a -50  kDa band, 
corresponding to SK2, and a -75 kDa band, corresponding to a novel SK2 variant (Chapter 5). A
third, less intense band o f -130  kDa was also detected. In the second lane, the preadsorbtion control, 
performed with 20 jig/ml pET-NSK2, is shown. The signal o f the 50 kDa and 75 kDa bands was 
abolished, whereas the higher molecular weight band was still visible. The Western blots were kindly 
provided by Dr. K. Hirzel
3.4 Epitope mapping of anti-NSK2 antibody
To characterise the anti-NSK2 antibody further, epitope mapping was performed to 
identify antibody binding sites. The method employed for this purpose is the so 
called "peptide scan". In this method, a set of linear overlapping peptides, that were 
designed to cover the entire primary sequence of the antigen, were synthesized on a 
solid support. Subsequently, the antibody was used in immunoblot-like experiments 
together with this solid support to test whether specific regions within the antigen 
could be recognised.
If one or more anti-NSK2 antibody epitopes were identified, the corresponding 
amino acid sequences could be used to perform peptide antibody purifications. This 
approach might be useful from a methodological point of view because the 
preparation of peptide columns for purification is experimentally easier than that of 
fusion protein columns. Furthermore, the anti-NSK2 antibody purified using the 
peptide might display improved sensitivity for the SK2 protein, compared with 
fusion protein purifications.
3.4.1 Epitope mapping
A set of 25 linear 13-aa-long peptides were designed, together covering the whole 
NSK2 part of the fusion protein that was used to generate the antibody (Fig. 3.1 A). 
The peptides overlapped by 11 aa and were shifted of two aa along the NSK2 
sequence, from the amino- to the carboxyl-terminus (Fig. 3.6 A). The 25 peptides 
were synthesized by "SPOT synthesis" directly on Whatman 50 cellulose membrane 
support, from the carboxyl to the amino-terminus, with the carboxyl-terminus 
covalently bound to the membrane (Jerini Peptide Technologies). We obtained a 
membrane with 25 spots (PepSPOTs), each spot consisting of ~5 nmol of peptide. 
The spots were numbered from 1 to 25, corresponding to the peptides covering the 
antigen (Fig. 3.6 B).

antigenic determinant. The red, green and blue lines below the sequence indicate the 13-aa-long 
peptides 1, 2 and 3, each overlapping of 11 aa. 25 peptides were designed to cover the entire NSK2. 
B: Schematic illustration of the 25 PepSPOTs on the membrane support. The red, green and blue dots 
represent the peptides 1,2 and 3, respectively, which are indicated in A with the same colours.
To determine the epitope to which the antibody binds, the PepSPOTs membrane was 
employed in immunoblot-like experiments (2.2.9) using the immunopurified anti- 
NSK2 antibody for detection. Before testing the antibody on the PepSPOTs, a set of 
control experiments were carried out on a membrane where no peptide was bound. 
These controls were performed to assess whether the anti-NSK2 antibody alone 
generated background signal and, in case any non-specific staining was detected, to 
test whether the regeneration of the membrane (2.2.9) might efficiently eliminate the 
signal. The following dilutions of the column purified anti-NSK2 antibody were 
tested: 1:249,000; 1:219,000; 1:150,000; 1:90,000; 1:30,000; and 1:6,000. No 
staining was visible up to the antibody dilution of 1:30,000. When the 1:30,000 
dilution was applied, a diffused staining was visible with long exposure times of the 
membrane (20 min), whereas short exposures (1 min) did not show any signal. 
Following this experiment, the membrane was successfully regenerated (2.2.9). Also, 
the experiment with the dilution of 1:6,000 revealed background signal only at long 
exposure time (20 min). Therefore, we concluded that long exposure combined with 
antibody dilutions lower than 1:30,000 could result in non-specific staining of the 
membrane and, in turn, mask any real signal. Additionally, it was tested whether the 
secondary antibody showed any cross-reactivity with the PepSPOTs. In this control 
experiment, the PepSPOTs membrane was used in the immunoblot experiment but 
the primary antibody was omitted. No signal was detected, indicating that the 
secondary detection system used was suitable for the experiments.
Subsequently, the immunostaining on the PepSPOTs was performed using the anti- 
NSK2 column purified antibody in a series of experiments with decreasing dilution 
of antibody: 1:249,000; 1:120,000; 1:60,000; 1:30,000; and 1:15,000. No 
immunostaining was detected with the highest dilution (1:249,000). When the 
1:120,000 antibody dilution was used, the PepSPOTs 5, 6 and 7 revealed a clear 
staining and, additionally, a faint signal was detected on the PepSPOT 18. A 
qualitative increase of the signal intensity was seen on the peptides 5, 6 and 7 by 
decreasing the antibody dilution from 1:60,000 to 1:15,000. Moreover, a slight 
increase of the signal on the PepSPOT 18 was observed and a weak staining 
appeared on the PepSPOT 4. Starting from the second experiment, performed with 
the 1:120,000 antibody dilution, the membrane was regenerated immediately after 
each immunoblot to remove the antibody bound to the PepSPOTs. Figure 3.7 shows 
a representative PepSPOTs immunoblot experiment performed with antibody 
dilution of 1:30,000, which gave the best signal to noise ratio.

FIGURE 3.7: Epitope mapping of the anti-NSK2 antibody. Immunoblot experiment performed on 
the PepSPOTs membrane. The experiment was performed with the anti-NSK2 antibody column 
purification (1:30,000). The antibody bound to the peptides was detected with anti-rabbit HRP- 
conjugated secondary antibody (1:6,000 BioRad). The ECL chemiluminescent system was used to 
reveal the signal; the membrane was exposed to the film for five minutes. PepSPOTs 5, 6 and 7 
showed a strong immunostaining. PepSPOTs 4 and 18 revealed a weak signal, whereas all the other 
PepSPOTs were not detected by the antibody.
As mentioned in 3.2, two anti-NSK2 sera were raised in two rabbits against the same 
fusion protein NSK2-GST: 1973g immune serum, which is the one used in all the 
experiments shown in this chapter, and 1974g. In order to test whether the two sera 
recognised the same or different epitopes of the NSK2 antigenic determinant, the 
immunopurified 1974g antibody (3.2) was also tested in the immunoblot on the 
PepSPOTs membrane. Before performing this experiment, a control immunoblot was 
preformed omitting the primary antibody. The absence of a signal indicated the 
complete regeneration of the PepSPOT membrane (Fig. 3.8 A). When the purified
1 0 2
1974g antibody (1:60,000) was used in the immunoblot, an intense staining appeared 
on PepSPOTs 5, 6 and 7 and, with less intensity, on 16. Moreover, a weak signal was 
also detected on the PepSPOTs 4, 17, and 18.
Altogether, the epitope mapping experiments suggest that the main region recognised 
by both anti-NSK2 immune sera (1973g and 1974g) corresponds to the sequence of 
the peptides 5, 6 and 7. A second sequence corresponding to PepSPOTs 16, 17 and 
18 was identified with the serum 1974g. The signal intensity of these PepSPOTs was 
significantly lower.

PepSPOTs 5, 6, 7 and, to less extent, 4 showed immunostaining. A second region o f NSK2 
corresponding to the PepSPOTs 16, 17 and 18 revealed a weaker signal. All the other PepSPOTs were 
not detected by the antibody. The experiments were performed as described in Figure 3.7.
3.4.2 Anti-NSK2 antibody purification
After identifying the linear epitope recognised by the affinity-purified anti-NSK2 
1973g and 1974g sera, the amino acid sequence corresponding to the epitope was 
used to purify the 1973g serum.
The sequences of the peptides 5, 6 and 7, which revealed intense immunoreactivity in 
the immunoblot experiments, (Fig. 3.7 and 3.8) were inspected. The sequence 
QPPASWGG (Fig 3.9 A, red) is present in all three peptides and represents the 
central part of the linear epitope. As shown in Figure 3.9 A, in all three peptides this 
core sequence is flanked by a few amino acids: four amino acids at the amino-
terminus in peptide 5; two amino acids at the amino-terminus and two amino acids at 
the carboxy 1-terminus in peptide 6; four amino acids at the carboxyl-terminus in the 
peptide 7. These amino acids might contribute to the binding of the antibody. 
Therefore, the peptide designed for the antibody purification contained the core 
sequence and the amino acids QPL at the amino-terminus, as shown in Figure 3.9. At 
the carboxyl-terminus of the core sequence a stretch of glycine residues is present, 
which gives high flexibility to that region. Antibodies frequently do not bind to 
regions of high flexibility; therefore, we do not expect that the anti-NSK2 antibody 
binds to the stretch of glycine residues. This is also supported by the fact that 
PepSPOTs 8-11 did not give a signal in the experiments described above (Fig. 3.7 
and 3.8 B). Consequently, only one glycine was added at the carboxyl-terminus to 
the core sequence. Additionally, one cysteine was added, enabling the coupling of 
the designed peptide to SulfoLink matrix for antibody purification (Fig. 3.9 B). The 
sequence of the peptide named QP-GG peptide is shown in Figure 3.9 B. This 
peptide was compared with other proteins for sequence similarity by BLAST search 
against the GenBank NCBI mammalian and rat databases. The BLAST search 
showed that the sequence was unique to SK2 and no significant similarity (E-value < 
1) was found.

sequences of PepSPOT peptides 5, 6 and 7 which are recognised by the anti-NSK2 sera 1973g and 
1974g. The core sequence present in all peptides is shown in red. B: Sequence o f the QP-GG peptide, 
designed for the antibody purification. An additional cysteine was added at the carboxy-terminus of 
the peptide.
The QP-GG peptide, obtained from Alta Bioscience (University of Birmingham) was 
coupled to SulfoLink agarose beads and the anti-NSK2 1973g serum was 
immunopurified (2.2.2). Surprisingly, the protein concentration measured in the 
eluates was extremely low (0.06-0.01 OD280nm/ml), compared with that of other 
purifications performed with the same amount of serum, using the pET-NSK2 fusion
protein. Nevertheless, the flow through, one eluate and the serum were tested in an 
ELISA assay. Since the QP-GG peptide alone is too small to adsorb efficiently to the 
plate used for the ELISA assay, the peptide was coupled to a BSA carrier protein 
(Imject Maleimide Activated BSA, 2.2.3). As shown in Figure 3.10, the eluate 
showed a clear signal above background up to a dilution of 1:10,000, whereas the 
flow through gave a signal comparable with the background even at low dilutions. 
These two observations indicate that all the antibodies recognising the anti-QP-GG 
peptide were purified from the serum. Additionally, we tested whether the eluate still 
contained antibody that detected GST. As shown in Figure 3.10 B, no anti-GST 
antibodies were present in the purification, whereas the flow through fraction showed 
a signal for GST comparable with that of the serum. The antibody purification 
performed with the peptide was also used in immunoblot on the PepSPOTs 
membrane (1:30,000) and, as shown in Figure 3.10 C, intense staining was visible 
only on the PepSPOTs 5, 6 and 7, which correspond to the region of the NSK2 used 
for the antibody purification, whereas no signal was detected on PepSPOT 18.

ELISA experiment performed to determine the titer of the anti-NSK2 column purification using the 
QP-GG peptide coupled to SulfoLink matrix. In this purification, the eluates were not pooled as 
described in 3.1 but they were kept separate. One eluate, the serum and the flow through were tested 
to titer the antibodies directed against either the QP-GG peptide (A) or the GST (B). In ELISA assays,
the BSA-conjugated QP-GG peptide (QP-GG peptide-BSA) and GST (3 pg/ml) were adsorbed to a 96 
well immuno-plate. The experiment was performed as described in Figure 3.1. B, C: Seven serial 
dilution steps were tested for the anti-NSK2 serum, for the eluate and for the flow through (1:350; 
1:1,225; 1:4,287; 1:15,006; 1:52,521; and 1:183,826). The background signal, measured in the 
absence of primary antibody was close to zero. Antibodies that recognised the QP-GG peptide were 
found in the eluate, whereas little or no antibodies against GST were present. C: Immunoblot 
experiment performed on the PepSPOTs membrane with the E2 fraction o f the QP-GG peptide 
column purification of the anti-NSK2 antibody (1:30,000). The experiment was performed as 
described in Figure 3.7. Intense immunostaining was detected on the PepSPOTs 5, 6 and 7.
After the successful antibody purification, despite the low protein content in the 
eluates, the antibody was employed in immunocytochemistry experiments to test its 
ability to recognise SK2 a  subunit recombinantly expressed in HEK 293 cells. 
Figure 3.11 A shows that the purified antibody revealed a clear membrane signal in 
the HEK 293 cells stably expressing SK2 subunit. This signal was identical to the 
one previously obtained with the anti-NSK2 antibody purified with the pET-NSK2 
fusion protein. Moreover, no staining was detected in wild type HEK 293 cells (Fig. 
3.11 B), indicating the specificity of the signal. Additionally, Western analysis was 
performed on lysates that were obtained from HEK 293 cells transiently transfected 
with rSK2 cDNA using the anti-NSK2 antibody purified with the QP-GG peptide. 
The antibody detected a band of the molecular weight corresponding to rSK2. This 
result was comparable to the one obtained using the anti-NSK2 purifications 
previously described (Fig. 3.5 A).

transfected HEK 293 cells were separated on 7.5% SDS page and transferred to nitrocellulose

All these experiments indicated that the anti-NSK2 antibody purified using the QP- 
GG peptide was able to recognise recombinant SK2 protein. However, when the 
antibody was used in Western blot analysis of adult rat brain synaptosomal 
membranes, results were in contrast with observations made using the pET-NSK2 
purified antibody. In these experiments, a band of ~90 kDa was detected (K. Hirzel 
personal communication), which is in contrast with previous results where two bands 
of ~50 kDa and 75 kDa were detected (Fig. 3.5 B). In the absence of a logical 
explanation for the ~90 kDa band, taking into consideration the surprisingly low 
protein content of the QP-GG peptide antibody purification and the results presented 
in Chapter 5, this antibody preparation was not further used in the study of the SK2 
distribution in native tissues.
CHAPTER 4 
Distribution of SK2 in the rat brain
4.1 Introduction
In situ hybridisation studies have recently reported the detailed distribution of SK 
channels mRNA in the rat brain (Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000). The studies showed 
that the three SK channels are widely expressed in the central nervous system and 
display differential distribution throughout the rat brain. In particular, SK2 mRNA is 
abundantly expressed; high levels of SK2 transcript are detected in the neocortical 
layer V and in hippocampal CA1-CA3 pyramidal neurones. However, little is known 
about the subcellular localisation of SK channels in specialised neuronal 
compartments. The study of the differential distribution of these channels in neuronal 
somata, dendrites or axons is important to understand their function in the regulation 
of firing patterns, integration of synaptic inputs or the regulation of synaptic activity. 
In this chapter, the immunohistochemical distribution of SK2 a  subunit will be 
reported. In particular, the subcellular localisation of SK2 protein was analysed in 
brain regions such as the hippocampus, the neocortex, the amygdala, the thalamus 
and the habenula. The distribution profile of SK2 in post-natal hippocampal cultures 
will also be described.
4.2 Immunohistochemical localisation of SK2 in the rat brain
The distribution of SK2 a  subunit in the rat brain was investigated by 
immunohistochemistry using the specific, affinity-purified anti-NSK2 antibody 
(Chapter 3). The experiments were performed as described in 2.2.15.2 on sagittal and 
coronal sections of P21-P25 rats (2.2.15.1). As shown in Figure 4.1, the SK2 protein 
was widely distributed throughout the rat brain. Particularly high levels of expression 
were observed in the cortex and in the hippocampal formation. Additionally, intense 
immunostaining was detected in the amygdala and in thalamic regions. When 
immunohistochemistry experiments were performed with the anti-NSK2 antibody 
preincubated with saturating amount of pET-NSK2 fusion protein, the 
immunostaining was completely abolished, confirming the specificity of the antibody 
(Fig 4. IB).

coronal sections (P21), performed either with the affinity-purified anti-NSK2 antibody (1:2,100) (A) 
or with the primary antibody preincubated with 20 pg/ml pET-NSK2 fusion protein (B). The 
Vectastain Elite ABC kit was used for signal detection. A: The affinity-purified anti-NSK2 antibody

4.2.1 SK2 distribution in hippocampus and cerebral cortex
The hippocampal formation and the cortex are among the brain areas that showed the 
highest levels of SK2 a  subunit expression in the rat brain. In the hippocampal 
formation, the most intense SK2 immunostaining was detected in CA1, CA2 and 
CA3 regions, as shown in Figure 4.2 A. High magnification analysis of the CA1 
pyramidal layer (Fig. 4.2 B) showed that the SK2 signal was localised in the 
membrane of somata and in the proximal part of apical dendrites of pyramidal 
neurones. In contrast, the nuclei did not show any staining. Similar cellular 
distribution was observed in CA2 and CA3 pyramidal neurones. Additionally, 
intense signal was present in scattered neurones in the stratum oriens and radiatum, 
indicating that there is expression of SK2 channels in hippocampal intemeurones. 
Furthermore, high SK2 immunoreactivity was detected in the subiculum. Within the 
dentate gyrus, the granule cell layer and the molecular layer displayed a very weak 
signal (Fig. 4.2 A), whereas SK2 labelling was detected in scattered neurones of the 
polymorphic layer.

neurones of layer V, SK2 protein was localised in the soma and in the apical and 
basal dendritic branches (Fig. 4.3 B). Additionally, intense SK2 signal was observed 
in the piriform and entorhinal cortex.

4.2.2 SK2 distribution in the amygdala
Within the amygdala complex a dense signal was observed in the basolateral nucleus 
and, with lower intensity, in the lateral amygdaloid nucleus (Fig. 4.4 A). High 
magnification analysis of the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus (Fig. 4.4 B) indicated 
that in this area the staining was not homogeneous, because some neurones revealed 
a more intense signal than others. Figure 4.4 B shows a somato-dentritic localisation 
of SK2 protein at cellular level. The nuclei were completely free of staining.

4.2.3 SK2 distribution in the thalamus and habenula
High to moderate levels of SK2 expression were detected throughout the thalamus. 
Intense SK2 immunolabeling was observed in the reticular thalamic nucleus (Rt), the 
laterodorsal thalamic nuclei (LDVL), the anterior and posterior nuclei (Po) (Fig. 4.4 
A). High magnification analysis throughout the thalamus revealed that the signal was 
associated to the somata and the proximal dendrites of neurones. Figure 4.5 B and 
show the subcellular localisation of the SK2 signal in the reticular thalamic nucleus 
and in the lateral part of the laterodorsal thalamic nucleus, respectively.

In the epithalamus (habenula), the densely packed neurones of the medial habenula 
presented the most prominent SK2 staining. Moderate signal intensity was observed 
in the lateral habenula (Fig. 4.6 A). The SK2 signal was mainly restricted to the 
neuronal somata, as shown in the high magnification picture of the medial habenula 
(Fig. 4.6 B).

signal. Scale bars: A, 100 pm; B, 10 pm.
4.2.4 SK2 distribution in the nucleus accumbens and caudate putamen
The nucleus accumbens and the caudate putamen were the brain regions displaying 
the lowest SK2 expression levels. In particular, the nucleus accumbens was almost 
completely devoid of SK2 signal (Fig. 4.7) and only weak, diffuse staining was 
visible in the caudate putamen. These data were in agreement with in situ 
hybridisation studies (Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000), that detected no SK2 mRNA in 
the nucleus accumbens and only a weak SK2 signal in the caudate putamen.
FIGURE 4.7: Distribution of SK2 in the nucleus accumbens. Immunohistochemistry of a P21 rat 
coronal section (anti-NSK2 antibody, 1:2,100) showed that no signal was detected in the nucleus 
accumbens. A weak signal was detected in the caudate putamen. The scheme on the right corresponds 
to panel 15 of The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates, (Paxinos and Watson, 1997). CPu, caudate 
putamen;cortex. Scale bar: 200 pm.
4.3 Localisation of SK2 in rat neuronal cultures
To define in more detail the cellular localisation of the SK2 a  subunit, the anti-NSK2 
antibody was used in immunocytochemistry experiments on rat neuronal primary 
cultures. Because the hippocampus and the neocortex were the brain areas showing 
the most intense SK2 signal in the immunohistochemistry, hippocampal and cortical 
primary cultures were used.
Initial immunocytochemistry experiments (2.2.14.3) were performed on embryonic 
cortical and hippocampal cultures. The experiments were performed at different 
stages of the culture development to investigate if developmental regulation of the
protein expression occurred. On these cells, the affinity-purified anti-NSK2 antibody 
did not detect any SK2 immunostaining, suggesting that either the SK2 protein was 
not expressed or the expression level was under the detection limit of the antibody. 
To test whether low levels of SK2 protein were expressed, signal amplification was 
attempted using a Tyramide based amplification system (TSA) (2.2.14.4). Also under 
these experimental conditions, SK2 signal was not detected in these cultured 
neurones, and only a faint background staining was observed on glia cells. Figure 4.8 
shows a typical example of immunostaining performed with the TSA amplification 
system on hippocampal neurones at day 22 in culture. In this experiment, double 
staining was performed with the neuronal marker microtubule-associated protein 2 
(MAP2). Figure 4.8 A shows the absence of staining for SK2 in the two neurones 
present in the field of view. The presence of these two neurones can be observed in 
the light field photograph (Fig. 4.8 C). The red staining in Figure 4.6 B indicates that 
both cells were instead labelled by the neuronal marker MAP2, demonstrating that 
these cells were indeed neurons. Similar results were obtained for hippocampal or 
cortical neurones, when they were cultured for 7-28 days.
FIGURE 4.8: Immunofluorescence of hippocampal neurones at day 22 in culture. Co-labelling of  
SK2 (A) and MAP2 (B). A: The affinity-purified anti-NSK2 antibody (1:150) was used in 
combination with the TSA amplification system. No signal was detected in the neurones. B: The anti- 
MAP2 antibody was used at the dilution o f 1:3,000; anti-mouse secondary Cy3 antibody (1:600) was 
used for signal detection. C: Bright-light picture o f the cells pictured in A and B. Scale bar: 20 pm.
Since no SK2 signal was detected in embryonic cultures, hippocampal neurones 
prepared from P0 rats were cultured, and the expression of SK2 a  subunits was 
analysed by immunofluorescence with the affinity-purified anti-NSK2 antibody.
Using the cultures from postnatal animals in combination with the TSA amplification 
system (2.2.14.4) no immunostaining was observed in neurones after 24 hours in 
culture (Fig. 4.9 A). However, from day 2, an increase of the SK2 protein signal was 
observed. At this stage, an SK2 immunostaining was present in the soma of the 
neurones (Fig. 4.9 C). By day 4 and 6 in culture, the SK2 signal increased in 
intensity, (Fig. 4.9 D, E) and between day 10 and 13, maximal expression was 
observed (Fig. 4.9 F). As shown in Figure 4.9 F, the SK2 staining was restricted to 
the soma and to the proximal portion of the dendrites of hippocampal neurones. The 
preabsorption of the anti-NSK2 antibody with the pET-NSK2 fusion protein and the 
omission of the primary antibody (data not shown) resulted in the complete loss of 
fluorescent staining (Fig 4.9 G), confirming the specificity of the detected signal. 
Immunohistochemical experiments on brain sections showed also that a specific 
SK2 signal was present in intemeurones in the stratum oriens and radiatum of the 
hippocampus (Fig. 4.2 A). Since primary cultures of hippocampal neurones contain 
both pyramidal cells and intemeurones, we investigated whether the SK2 protein was 
expressed in the intemeurones. These intemeurones can be differentiated 
morphologically from pyramidal neurones. Pyramidal cells represent 85-90% of the 
total neuronal population and are characterised by a complex, highly branched 
dendritic tree. In contrast, intemeurones are -10% of the neurones in culture and 
have only few dendritic branching points. Moreover, immunohistochemically, the 
two neuronal populations can be distinguished by the expression of the enzyme 
glutamic acid decerboxylase (GAD), which is involved in the synthesis of GABA. 
GAD is expressed in the GABA-ergic intemeurones but not in the glutamatergic 
pyramidal cells. Double staining with the monoclonal GAD6 antibody and with the 
affinity-purified anti-NSK2 antibody was performed. The SK2 signal was amplified 
using the TSA amplification system. The experiment revealed that -10% of the 
neurones in culture were labelled by the anti-GAD antibody and these cells displayed 
the morphological features of intemeurones, described above. About half of the 
intemeurones revealed immunostaining also for SK2. Figure 4.10 shows the double- 
staining in an intemeuron. The SK2 signal (Fig. 4.10 A, green) was localised in the 
soma and in the proximal portion of the dendrites of the anti-GAD-positive 
intemeuron (Fig. 4.10 B, red), similar to the distribution pattern observed in the 
pyramidal cells.

shown. At day 2 in culture, SK2 immunostaining was detected (C) and its expression increased at day 
4 (D) and 6 (E). In F the distribution o f the SK2 protein at day 13 is shown. No staining is visible with 
antibodies preadsorbed with pET-NSK2 fusion protein (G). In H the bright-light pictures of the cell 
reported in G is shown. Scale bar: A-E, 20 pm; F-H, 10 pm.

CHAPTER 5 
Characterisation of a new rSK2 variant: rSK2-860
5.1 Introduction
Studies recently performed in our group identified a new rSK2 variant, called rSK2- 
860 because the corresponding primary sequence is 860 amino acids long. The rSK2- 
860 differs from the originally cloned SK2 subunit because it has a 275 amino acids 
longer amino terminal domain. The rSK2-860 was identified by cDNA cloning from 
the rat brain. Its existence was verified by RNase protection, which indicated the 
presence of SK2 transcripts containing an additional 5' exon and having a longer 
open reading frame (Kerscenstein, 2003) compared to the published rSK2 sequence 
(Kohler et al., 1996). Furthermore, RNase protection showed that this SK2 transcript 
is the predominant one in the rat brain (Kerscenstein, 2003). Electrophysiological
recordings in HEK 293 cells expressing rSK2-860 showed that the protein assembles
1into functional channels that generate a Ca -dependent and apamin-sensitive K 
current (D. Dhoedt personal communication). Nevertheless, immunocytochemical 
studies on different cell lines expressing rSK2-860 revealed a peculiar distribution 
pattern. When cDNA plasmids coding for rSK2-860 were transfected in HEK 293, 
CHO or COS cells, the protein was present in clusters localised throughout the 
cytoplasm (Dhoedt, 2004). The mechanism responsible for this distribution pattern 
of the rSK2-860 subunit has not been yet elucidated.
In this chapter, the study of the native distribution of the rSK2-860 protein will be 
presented. An antibody directed against the novel rSK2-860 subunit was raised and 
characterised. This antibody was used to assess the expression of the rSK2-860 
variant in the rat brain by Western analysis and to study its distribution profile in 
immunohistochemical experiments. Moreover, the subcellular targeting of the rSK2- 
860 subunit exogenously expressed in different neuronal types was analysed and 
compared with the distribution profile of the originally cloned rSK2 subunit.
5.2 Western analysis of rSK2-860
As described above, the only difference between the rSK2 a-subunit and the rSK2- 
860 consists in the amino terminal 275 amino acids long stretch, whereas the rest of 
the sequence is identical (Fig. 5.1). Therefore, a region within the extended amino 
terminal domain of the rSK2-860 subunit was selected to generate an antibody that 
distinctively binds to the rSK2-860. This antibody, called anti-N860, was raised 
against a fusion protein consisting of GST and amino acids 68-249 (light blue box in
Fig. 5.1) of the rSK2-860 sequence (GenBank accession no. AK033158.1). To study 
the distribution of the new rSK2-860 variant in the rat brain, the anti-N860 antibody 
was used in combination with the anti-NSK2 antibody described in Chapter 3, which 
recognises both the rSK2 and the rSK2-860 subunits (Fig. 5.1).
N860 NSK2
FIGURE 5.1: Schematic illustration of rSK2 and rSK2-860 subunits. The upper scheme 
represents the cloned SK2 (Kohler et al., 1996). The lower scheme corresponds to the rSK2-860, with 
the 275 aa extended amino terminus represented as a dark blue box. The yellow boxes represent the 
six S1-S6 transmembrane domains. The red box marks the region used to generate the anti-NSK2 
antibody and the light blue box indicates the region used to generate the anti-N860 antibody.
Similar to what has been described in Chapter 3 for the anti-NSK2, the anti-N860 
serum was affinity-purified to eliminate GST-directed and other unspecific 
antibodies. Column antibody purification (2.2.2) was performed using a fusion 
protein where the N860 region, which was used to raise the antibody, was fused to 
thioredoxin (Trx) (pET-N860). The purification was tested in ELISA assays. The 
ELISA indicated that GST-directed antibodies were eliminated and anti-N860 
immunoglobulins were purified.
The anti-NSK2 and anti-N860 antibodies were characterised in Western analysis to 
test their ability to recognise native rSK2-860 subunit. Crude membrane lysates of 
HEK 293 cells transfected with cDNA plasmids that code the rSK2-860 were 
prepared and used in Western blots. In parallel, lysates of HEK 293 cells expressing 
the originally cloned rSK2 subunit were also used. The anti-NSK2 serum recognised 
a single band of -85 kDa on rSK2-860-expressing cells (Fig. 5.2 A, first lane). When 
the rSK2 subunit was expressed, a single band of -50 kDa could be observed (Fig.
5.2 A, second lane), as already described in Chapter 3. Additionally, as shown in 
Figure 5.2 B, the same high molecular weight band detected by the serum (-85 kDa) 
was revealed by the affinity-purified anti-NSK2 antibody on lysates of HEK 293 
cells expressing rSK2-860. This result confirmed that also the purified antibody 
retained its ability to recognise the recombinantly expressed rSK2-860 protein.
Furthermore, lysates of HEK 293 untransfected or transfected with rSK2-860, rSK2 
or rSK3 cDNA plasmids were used in Western blots to test the anti-N860 serum. 
Figure 5.2 C (second lane) shows that, similar to the results obtained with the anti- 
NSK2 antibody, a single band of -85 kDa was detected in rSK2-860-expressing 
cells. As expected, no bands were detected in un-transfected HEK 293 (Fig. 5.2 C, 
first lane) and in cells expressing either rSK2 (Fig. 5.2 C, third lane) or rSK3 (Fig.
5.2 C, fourth lane). This observation indicates that the antibody did not cross-react 
with other SK subunits. The affinity-purified anti-N860 was also tested in Western 
blot of lysates from rSK2-860-expressing HEK 293 cells. When the affinity-purified 
anti-N860 antibody was used in the immunoblot, it recognised the single high 
molecular weight band of -  85 kDa corresponding to the rSK2-860 subunit (Fig. 5.2 
anti-NSK2 anti-NSK2 anti-N860 anti-N860
FIGURE 5.2: Western blot of HEK 293 cells expressing SK2 or SK2-860 subunits. A, B: Western 
blot (2.2.8) o f crude membrane lysates o f HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with plasmids 
encoding rSK2-860 or rSK2 a  subunit. Proteins were separated on SDS page and transferred to 
nitrocellulose membrane by tank blot. The immunoblot was performed with the anti-NSK2 serum (A) 
or with the affinity-purified anti-NSK2 antibody (B). A: A single high molecular weight band was 
detected in the rSK2-860-expressing HEK 293 cells (first lane) and a -5 0  kDa band was visible in 
HEK 293 cells transfected with rSK2 (second lane). B: A single band o f -85  kDa was detected in the 
HEK 293 cells transfected with rSK2-860. C: Lysates of HEK 293 cells untransfected or transiently 
transfected with plasmids that code for the rSK2-860, rSK2 or rSK3 a-subunits were used in Western 
blot with the anti-NSK2 serum. No bands were detected in untransfected HEK 293 (first lane), and in 
cells transfected either with rSK2 (third lane) or with rSK3 (fourth lane). A single band (-85 kDa) 
was detected in rSK2-860-expressing cells (second lane). D: Western blot of rSK2-860-expressing 
HEK 293 cells performed with the affinity-purified anti-N860 antibody (1:600).
Taken together, these experiments show that the affinity-purified anti-NSK2 
antibody recognised the rSK2-860 subunit, in addition to rSK2 protein. Moreover, 
the experiments performed with the affmity-purified anti-N860 indicate that the 
antibody is sensitive and specific for the rSK2-860. Therefore, the two antibodies 
were used for the study of the expression of rSK2-860 subunits in the rat brain.
To assess the expression of the rSK2-860 subunit in the rat brain, Western analysis 
was performed on rat brain synaptosomal membranes using the two available 
antibodies. As shown in Chapter 3 (Fig. 3.5 D), the affmity-purified anti-NSK2 
antibody detected two specific bands: one of -50 kDa, which corresponds to rSK2, 
and a second one of higher molecular weight (-80 kDa). When the affmity-purified 
anti-N860 was used in the Western analysis on rat brain, a single band of -80 kDa 
was detected, confirming that this band represents the rSK2-860 subunit (Fig. 5.3). 
Preincubation with saturating amounts of pET-N860 fusion protein resulted in the 
complete elimination of the signal, supporting the specificity of the antibody. In 
conclusion, by using two antibodies directed against different parts of the rSK2-860 
subunit in Western analysis from native tissue, we demonstrated that this subunit is 
expressed in the rat brain.
FIGURE 5.3: Western blot of rat brain 
synaptosomal membranes with the anti-N860 
antibody. 100 pg o f P35 rat brain synaptosomal 
membranes were separated on 7.5% SDS page 
and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by 
tank blot. Immunoblot was performed with the 
affmity-purified anti-N860 antibody. A single -80  
kDa band was detected. The signal was abolished 
by pre-adsorbing the primary antibody with pET- 
N860 fusion protein.

5.3 Immunohistochemical distribution of the rSK2-860 subunit
The distribution of the rSK2-860 subunit was investigated by immunohistochemical 
studies. In particular, the expression pattern was analysed in the hippocampal 
formation and in the cortex. In these regions, an intense signal was detected using the 
anti-NSK2 antibody, which recognises both SK2 variants (Fig. 4.2 and 4.3). By using 
the anti-N860 antibody, we wanted to investigate whether the newly characterised 
rSK2-860 was also expressed in these regions.
Initial experiments performed with the affinity-purified anti-N860 antibody did not 
show any signal in immunohistochemistry. Therefore, the TSA Biotin System was 
used in combination with the ABC detection system to amplify a potential rSK2-860 
immunostaining (2.2.15.4). In CA2 and CA3 layers of the hippocampus, the 
expression pattern observed with the affinity-purified anti-N860 antibody (Fig. 5.4 
A) is similar to that observed with the anti-NSK2 antibody (Fig. 4.2 A). In contrast, 
the signal in the CA1 and in the subiculum is weaker than the one observed with the 
anti-NSK2 antibody. This indicates that the predominant subunit expressed in these 
regions is rSK2. rSK2-860 immunostaining was also detected in scattered neurones 
of the stratum oriens and radiatum, suggesting that the two variants are likely to be 
co-expressed in hippocampal intemeurones. In the neocortex, the rSK2-860 signal is 
restricted to the layer V because all the other layers displayed very weak signal. 
Figure 5.4 B shows that, when immunohistochemistry was performed with the anti- 
N860 antibody preadsorbed with the pET-N860 fusion protein (2.2.5), no signal was 
detected, confirming the specificity of the antibody.
FIGURE 5.4: Distribution of the rSK2-860 a-subunit in the rat hippocampus.
Immunohistochemistry was performed on rat brain (P25) sagittal sections using the affinity-purified 
anti-N860 antibody (1:875) (A) or the affinity-purified anti-N860 antibody preincubated with the
pET-N860 fusion protein (20 pg/ml) (B). A: CA2 and CA3 hippocampal regions and the layer V o f  
the neocortex displayed SK2-860 immunostaining. Weak signal was detected in the CA1 region. SK2- 
860 signal was also observed in scattered neurones o f  the stratum oriens and radiatum. B: No signal 
was detected in the pre-adsorbtion control. V, neocortical layer V. Scale bars: 200 pm.
5.4 Exogenous expression of rSK2 and rSK2-860 subunits in neuronal cells
Studies performed in our laboratory indicated that the expression of the rSK2-860 
variant in different cell lines, such as HEK 293, COS and CHO cells, resulted in a 
distinctive distribution pattern. The rSK2-860 protein formed numerous clusters 
localised in the cytoplasm of cells and no plasma membrane localisation was 
observed. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the intracellular retention 
and the clustering of the rSK2-860 subunit are still unknown. Several retention signal 
sequences present in the extended 275 aa amino terminus were analysed but none of 
them was found to be responsible for the retention of the protein in the intracellular 
clusters (Dhoedt, 2004).
In order to study the targeting of the rSK2-860 variant in neurones, the protein was 
expressed in two different neuronal types. By using the two antibodies anti-NSK2 
and anti-N860 the distribution of the exogenously expressed protein was analysed 
and compared with the distribution profile of rSK2 a-subunit.
5.4.1 Expression of rSK2 and rSK2-860 subunits in SCG neurones
Immunocytochemistry experiments initially performed on SCG neuronal cultures 
indicated that the SK2 protein was not detected using the anti-NSK2 antibody (data 
not shown). Therefore, these cells were used as a neuronal expression system for 
exogenous SK2 subunits. SCG neurones were microinjected with cDNAs encoding 
the two rSK2 variants, and the subcellular targeting of the expressed subunits was 
investigated by immunocytochemistry with anti-NSK2 (Chapter 3) and anti-N860 
antibodies. The unpurified antibody were used in the experiments described in this 
paragraph because neither the anti-NSK2 nor the anti-N860 sera revealed 
immunostaining on untransfected neurones
The SCG neurones were microinjected with 100 ng/pl of cDNA plasmid coding for 
the rSK2 subunit, as described in 2.2.11.4. Immunocytochemistry using the anti- 
NSK2 serum (2.2.14.2) was performed 24-48 hours after the injection. Figure 5.5 
shows that, when the SK2 subunit was expressed in SCG neurones, a uniformly
distributed immunostaining was observed in cell bodies and in dendrites. The signal 
in different sections of the cell clearly indicates that the SK2 subunit was localised in 
the membrane of neurones.

o f six confocal sections o f an SCG neuron expressing the rSK2 subunit. Immunocytochemistry was 
performed with the anti-NSK2 serum (1:1,000). The signal was detected by using the anti-rabbit Cy3- 
conjugated secondary antibody (1:600). Scale bar: 20 pm
In parallel, rSK2-860 subunit cDNA was injected in SCG neurones, as described 
above, and the distribution of the expressed protein was analysed by immunostaining 
using anti-NSK2 and anti-N860 sera. Figure 5.6 shows the immunostaining 
performed with the anti-NSK2 serum. Experiments revealed that in all the injected 
neurones the protein was present in numerous ring-shaped clusters localised in the 
soma and in the proximal part of the dendrites. In the soma, the clusters were 
distributed throughout the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus. In some of the injected 
neurones, a uniform signal in the plasma membrane was also detected, indicating that 
some rSK2-860 protein did not form clusters and was targeted to the membrane. The 
neuron reported in Figure 5.6 is an example that shows a diffuse membrane signal 
(white arrowheads in the inset of Fig. 5.6), in addition to the staining in the clusters. 
Comparable results were obtained when the anti-N860 serum was used for the
immunostaining of SCG neurones expressing the rSK2-860 subunit. A large number 
of cytoplasmic clusters was observed (Fig. 5.7).
FIGURE 5.6: Immunocytochemistry with anti-NSK2 antibody o f SCG neurones expressing the 
SK2-860 subunit SCG neurones microinjected with rSK2-860 cDNA plasmids. Six confocal sections 
of an SCG neuron expressing the rSK2-860 and immunostained with anti-NSK2 serum (1:1,000) are 
shown. The signal was detected by using the anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (1:600). 
The inset shows the 4 x magnification o f the region marked in the figure. Scale bar: 10 pm.
FIGURE 5.7: Immunocytochemistry with anti-N860 antibody of SCG neurones microinjected

rabbit Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (1:600) was used for signal detection. Scale bar: 10 pm.
Because the protein was overexpressed, we wanted to test whether the formation of 
the rSK2-860 protein clusters was related to the saturation of the sorting machinery 
that might lead to mislocalisation of the expressed subunit. This hypothesis was 
addressed by decreasing up to 20 times the amount of rSK2-860 cDNA injected in 
SCG neurones. When 5-10 ng/pl of rSK2-860 plasmid were injected, the distribution 
pattern of the protein did not change. Figure 5.8 shows the immunostaining 
performed with the anti-NSK2 serum on a neuron injected with 10 ng/pl of rSK2- 
860 plasmid. As visible in the selected confocal sections, the protein formed clusters 
throughout the cytoplasm, similar to the ones shown in the Figures 5.6 and 5.7. 
However, the number of clusters was reduced compared with that of the injections 
with higher amounts of plasmids. These observations indicated that, even when the 
rSK2-860 subunit was expressed at extremely low levels, its targeting profile did not 
changed.

cDNA plasmid. The immunostaining was performed with the anti-NSK2 serum (1:1,000). The figure
shows six confocal sections of an injected SCG neuron. Anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated secondary 
antibody (1:600) was used for signal detection. Scale bar: 10 |im.
5.4.2 Co-expression of rSK2 and rSK2-860 subunits in SCG neurones
An interesting aspect of the potential function of the rSK2-860 is that this subunit 
might form heteromeric channels with the rSK2. To test this hypothesis, myc-tagged 
rSK2 subunits were co-expressed with rSK2-860 in SCG neurones. 
Immunofluorescence experiments were performed by using an anti-myc monoclonal 
antibody to detect the rSK2-myc, and the anti-N860 serum to detect specifically the 
rSK2-860 subunit.
When the two subunits were expressed together, the rSK2-860 subunit was retained 
in the cytoplasm of all the injected neurones and, in some cases, also a membrane 
signal was detected. The rSK2-860 that was retained in the cytoplasm exhibited a 
different distribution profile compared to the one observed when rSK2-860 was 
expressed alone. In fact, a reduced number of clusters and a more diffused rSK2-860 
distribution were observed throughout the cytoplasm. As shown in Figure 5.9 A and 
B, an overlapping signal of the rSK2-860 (blue) and the rSK2-myc (red) was 
observed throughout the sections, indicating assembly of the two subunits. The inset 
in the Figure 5.9 A shows that overlapping signals were found in the ring shaped 
clusters present in the area indicated in the figure, supporting a partial retention of 
the rSK2 subunit together with the rSK2-860 in the clusters. The overlapping signal 
of the two subunits was also detected in the plasma membrane of injected SCG 
neurons (Fig. 5.9 B).
FIGURE 5.9: Immunofluorescence on SCG neurones microinjected with rSK2-myc and rSK2- 
860 cDNA plasmids. SCG neurones were microinjected with rSK2-myc (25 ng/pl) and rSK2-860 (25 
ng/pl) cDNA plasmids. The immunostaining was performed with the mouse anti-myc monoclonal 
antibody (1:400) and the anti-N860 serum (1:1,000). Anti-mouse Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody 
(1:600) was used to detect the rSK2-myc signal (red); anti-rabbit-Cy5-conjugated secondary antibody 
(1:600) was used to detect the rSK2-860 subunit (blue). A, B: Five confocal sections o f two injected 
SCG neurones are shown. The insets show the high magnification o f the regions marked in the images 
in A and B. The inset in A is 2.6 x magnification and the inset in B is 4 x magnification. Scale bar: 10 
5.4.3 Exogenous co-expression of rSK2 and rSK2-860 subunits in cortical 
neurones
The expression of rSK2 and rSK2-860 subunits was also analysed in primary 
cultures of cortical embryonic neurones. As reported in 4.3, the 
immunocytochemistry with the affinity-purified anti-NSK2 antibody on the cortical 
primary cultures revealed no SK2 immunostaining. Therefore, these cultures were 
used as an expression system to analyse whether the rSK2-860 subunit exhibited a 
different distribution than the one observed in SCG neurones.
Neurones were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (2.2.12.3) and cDNA 
plasmids coding either for rSK2 or rSK2-860 subunits. The anti-NSK2 antibody was 
used in immunocytochemistry experiments to determine the targeting pattern of the 
expressed subunits.
Figure 5.10 shows that, when the rSK2 subunit was expressed in cortical neurones, a 
uniform immunofluorescence signal was detected in the soma. The protein is 
probably localised in the membrane. Moreover, SK2 expression was found in the 
complex dendritic tree of transfected pyramidal neurones and in the distal part of the 
dendrites (Fig. 5.10 A).
FIGURE 5.10: Immunofluorescence on cortical neurones transfected with cDNA plasmids 
coding rSK2 a-subunit. The anti-NSK2 antibody (1:1,000) was used for the immunostaining. The 
signal was detected with anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:30). Scale bar: 20 pm.
When the rSK2-860 cDNA was transfected, the subcellular distribution of the 
subunit was similar to that observed in SCG neurones. Immunofluorescence 
experiments were performed two and six days after transfection to determine whether 
any change in the targeting of the protein in the different subcellular compartments 
occurred. Figure 5.11 A shows the immunocytochemistry performed 48 hours after 
transfection. The rSK2-860 subunit was mainly localised in clusters. However, some 
signal was present also in the neuronal membrane. Numerous clusters were 
distributed throughout the soma and along the dendrites (Fig. 5.11 B). No change in 
the protein distribution was observed when the experiment was performed six days 
after transfection (Fig. 5.11 C, D). The protein was still present in numerous clusters 
in the soma and in the dendrites of transfected neurones.
FIGURE 5.11 Immunofluorescence on cortical neurones transfected with cDNA plasmids 
coding the rSK2-860 a-subunit. Immunostaining was performed with the affinity-purified anti- 
NSK2 antibody (1:380) at day 2 (A-B) or 6 (C-D) after the transfection. Anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated 
secondary antibody was used for signal detection (1:30). In D the neurone soma was blanked out 
because the picture was obtained by overexposing the specimen. Scale bar: A-C, 10 pm; D: 20 pm.

CHAPTER 6
Immunohistochemical distribution of SK3 a  subunit in the rat brain
6.1 Introduction
In this chapter, the immunohistochemical localisation of SK3 a  subunit in the rat 
brain will be reported. To study the protein distribution, an anti-SK3 antibody was 
generated and characterised. The antibody was used in immunohistochemistry 
experiments to determine the regional distribution of the SK3 protein throughout the 
rat brain and to assess the subcellular distribution of the channel in various central 
neurones.
In situ hybridisation studies of SK channels in the rat brain revealed that the overall 
distribution of SK3 a  subunit is complementary to the distribution of SKI and SK2 
a  subunits (Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000; Tacconi et al., 2001; Bosch et al., 2002; 
Sarpal et al., 2004). Among the brain regions displaying high levels of SK3 mRNA 
are the lateral septum, the dorsal and central thalamic nuclei, the medial habenula, 
the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and, in the hypothalamus, the supraoptic and 
suprachiasmatic nuclei. Moreover, SK3 mRNA expression was observed in regions 
containing monoaminergic neurones such as the substantia nigra pars compacta, the 
locus coeruleus and the dorsal raphe. In some of these brain regions, the expression 
pattern described for the SK3 mRNA has been correlated with native I a h p  currents. 
For example, in the dorsal vagal nucleus, pharmacological studies indicate that 
homomeric SK3 channels underlie the apamin-sensitive I a h p  expressed by these 
neurones (Pedarzani et al., 2000). In dopaminergic neurones of the substantia nigra 
pars compacta, SK3 homomeric channels are the main determinants of the Iahp? 
which are important in the control of the spontaneous firing frequency in these 
neurones (Wolfart et al., 2001).
However, the precise subcellular localisation of SK3 channels in different neuronal 
types has still to be determined. Recent studies have proposed that SK3 might have 
presynaptic localisation in the neuromuscular junction (Roncarati et al., 2001) and in 
hippocampal neuronal primary cultures (Obermair et al., 2003). These observations, 
together with the data reported in Chapter 4, indicating that SK2 is a somatodendritic 
channel, suggest that different SK subunits might target specific neuronal 
compartments and contribute differently to neuronal function.
6.2 Characterisation of the carboxy-terminal anti-SK3 antibody
A sequence-specific peptide antibody was raised against a region that is unique to 
rSK3, corresponding to the amino acids 706-719 and located in the carboxyl-terminal 
domain of SK3 a  subunit. The antibody was immunopurified following the column 
purification method (2.2.2) by using SulfoLink agarose beads coupled to the SK3 
peptide that was used to generate the antibody.
Western blot experiments showed that the immunopurified antibody recognised rSK3 
subunits that are recombinantly expressed in HEK 293 cells and it did not cross-react 
with rSK2 and rSK2-860 a  subunits (K. Hirzel personal communication). The 
immunopurified anti-CSK3 antibody was also used in Western analysis on rat 
synaptosomal membrane preparations in order to test the specificity of the antibody 
on native tissue. As shown in Figure 6.1, the antibody detected a single 
immunoreactive band of ~75 kDa, in good agreement with the molecular weight 
predicted from the primary sequence of rSK3 a  subunit. Similar results were 
obtained in Western analysis of mouse synaptosomal membranes, where a 
commercial anti-NSK3 antibody (Alomone) detected a single band of ~75 kDa 
(Bond et al., 2004). Taken together, these observations indicated that the affinity 
purified anti-CSK3 antibody specifically recognised only the rSK3 channel protein in

6.3 Distribution of SK3 in the rat brain
After showing its specificity in Western analysis, the affinity purified anti-CSK3 
antibody was used to study the immunohistochemical distribution of SK3 a  subunit 
in the rat brain. Immunohistochemistry experiments were performed on coronal and 
sagittal brain sections of P25 rats (2.2.15.1), following the protocol described in 
2.2.15.2.
As shown in the overview pictures in Figure 6.2, the white matter tracts were 
completely devoid of SK3 immunoreactivity and, generally, SK3 signal was 
restricted to neuronal structures and not to glial cells. Moreover, the overall 
expression pattern detected by the anti-CSK3 antibody was in good agreement with 
the distribution profile previously described by in situ hybridisation studies (Stocker 
and Pedarzani, 2000). High levels of SK3 expression were detected in the septum, in 
most thalamic nuclei, in supraoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei and in the medial 
habenula. High SK3 immunoreactivity was also detected in brainstem regions 
containing monoaminergic neurones such as the substantia nigra pars compacta, the 
ventral tegental area, the locus coeruleus and the dorsal raphe.

6.3.1 SK3 distribution in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex
SK3 expression was low in the hippocampal formation. As shown in Figure 6.3 A, 
the pyramidal layer as well as the stratum oriens and radiatum of CA1, CA2 and 
CA3 regions were almost devoid of SK3 staining. These data are in accordance with 
previous mRNA distribution analysis reporting weak detection of SK3 transcripts in 
the hippocampus (Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000). Moderate immunoreactivity was 
associated with the stratum lacunosum moleculare and with the molecular layer of 
the dentate gyrus, which receives afferent fibres from the entorhinal cortex. Weak 
immunostaining was found in the granule cells layer but not in the polymorphic layer 
of the dentate gyrus (Fig. 6.3). In the subiculum and in the entorhinal cortex, SK3 
expression levels were absent and very low, respectively (Table 6.1).
In the neocortex, the SK3 immunoreactivity was almost absent, as shown in Figure
6.2 A-I and, in more details, in Figure 6.3.

6.3.2 SK3 distribution in the thalamus and in the epithalamus
Most thalamic nuclei revealed intense SK3 immunoreactivity. A high signal was 
detected in the anterior thalamic nuclei complex (Fig. 6.4 A-C; Table 6.1) and in the 
laterodorsal nuclei (Fig. 6.5 A-B; Table 6.1). High to moderate levels of SK3 
expression were found in the posterior, central medial, paraventricular and paratenial 
thalamic nuclei (Fig. 6.5 A; Table 6.1). At the cellular level, SK3 immunoreactivity 
in the thalamus was diffuse and neuronal profiles were not visible. As shown in the 
high magnification picture of the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus (Fig. 6.4 C), SK3 
immunostaining was distributed in the perisomatic neuropil and, in some cases, in 
fibre-like structures.

purified anti-CSK3 antibody (1:17,500). A: SK3 signal was observed in the anteromedial thalamic 
nucleus (AM). B: Very intense signal was observed in the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus (AD) and, to 
a lower degree, in the anteroventral nucleus (AV). C: High magnification picture o f AD showing that 
SK3 signal was associated to the neuropil. Scale bars: A, B, 200 pm; C, 40 pm.
The reticular thalamic nucleus was among the few thalamic regions devoid of SK3 
immunostaining (Fig. 6.5 B). Other nuclei expressing low SK3 immunoreactivity 
were the medial dorsal nucleus and the ventral thalamic nuclei complex (Fig. 6.5 A- 
B; Table 6.1).

FIGURE 6.5: SK3 distribution in the thalamus. Immunohistochemistry on coronal sections o f P25 
rats, using the affinity purified anti-CSK3 antibody (1:17,500). A: SK3 signal was intense in the 
medial habenula (MHb), in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PV); in the central medial thalamic 
nucleus (CM) and in the posterior thalamic nuclear group (Po). Weak signal was detected in the 
mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD). B: Very intense signal was observed in the laterodorsal thalamic 
nucleus (LDVL), whereas the ventral posterior thalamic nuclei (VPL and VPM) displayed a weaker 
staining. The reticular thalamic nucleus (Rt) was devoid o f SK3 signal, ic, internal capsule. Scale bar: 
100 pm.
Among the geniculate nuclei, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus displayed intense 
SK3 expression, whereas low staining was observed in the ventral lateral nucleus 
(Fig. 6.6 A). Moreover, intense SK3 immunoreactivity was found in the medium 
geniculate nucleus (Fig. 6.6 B). Similar to the cellular distribution pattern observed 
in other thalamic nuclei, SK3 immunoreactivity was associated to the neuropil and 
neuronal profiles were not visible.

In the epithalamus, a very intense SK3 immunostaining was observed in the medial 
habenula, whereas in the lateral habenula SK3 expression levels were low (Fig. 6.7
A). As shown in the Figure 6.7 B, in the medial habenula the SK3 immunoreactivity 
was localised in neuronal somata and processes. Weak SK3 staining was also 
associated with the neuropil and fibre-like structures present in the lateral habenula.

weak. B: High magnification picture showing subcellular distribution o f the SK3 protein in the MHb.

6.3.3 SK3 distribution in the amygdala
No SK3 expression was observed throughout the amygdala complex (Table 6.1) 
apart from the central amygdaloid nucleus. In this region, a dense SK3 
immunoreactivity was associated to the perinuclear neuropil (Fig. 6.8), whereas no 
evident somatic or fibres staining was observed.
6.3.4 SK3 distribution in the basal ganglia and in the septum
The anti-CSK3 antibody revealed moderate signal in the caudate putamen, in the 
nucleus accumbens and in the ventral pallidum (Table 6.1). Very low SK3 
expression levels were detected in the claustrum and in the subthalamic nucleus, 
whereas almost no signal was present in the globus pallidus (Table 6.1).

FIGURE 6.8: SK3 distribution analysis in the amygdala. Immunohistochemistry on P25 rat
sagittal sections was performed with the immunopurified anti-CSK3 antibody (1:17,500). Very weak 
SK3 signal was detected in lateral (La), basolateral (BL) and basomedial (BM) amygdaloid nuclei. 
Intense neuropil staining was present in the central amygdaloid nuclei (Ce). The scheme on the right is 
adapted from panel 30 o f The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates (Paxinos and Watson, 1997). 
Scale bar: 200 pm.
In the substantia nigra, intense SK3 immunostaining was observed in the pars 
compacta (SNC) and in scattered neurones of the pars reticulata (SNR). SNC 
dopaminergic neurones exhibit an apamin-sensitive I a h p , which has a central role in 
setting the regular spiking activity of these neurones (Worfart et al., 2001). 
Pharmacological (Worfart et al., 2001) and in situ hybridisation studies (Stocker and 
Pedarzani, 2000) indicated that SK3 is the principal molecular determinant of the 
SNR I a h p - Immunohistochemistry performed with the anti-CSK3 antibody confirmed 
that SK3 is highly expressed in these neurones and somatodendritic subcellular 
localisation was observed (See paragraph 6.3.7, Fig. 6.12 A).
Very dense SK3 immunostaining was detected in the septum. The SK3 a  subunit 
exhibited a very intense expression in the dorsal part of the lateral septal nucleus 
(Fig. 6.9 A), whereas the medium and triangular septal nuclei were almost 
completely devoid of signal. In the lateral septum, the immunostaining was 
associated to neuronal somata, dendrites and varicose fibres resembling axonal 
profiles (Fig. 6.9 B).

P25 coronal sections with the immunopurified anti-CSK3 antibody (1:17,500). A: Very intense signal 
was detected in the dorsal part o f the lateral septal nucleus (LSD), whereas much weaker 
immunostaining was present in the intermediate part (LSI). B: SK3 immunostaining was detected on 
fibres in LSD and LSI. Scale bar: A, 200 pm; B, 20 pm.
6.3.5 SK3 distribution in the hypothalamus
In the hypothalamus SK3 was generally expressed at low levels. Exceptions were 
represented by the supraoptic, suprachiasmic, arcuate and the lateral mamillary 
nuclei (Table 6.1).
Particularly interesting was the study of the subcellular distribution of the SK3 
channel in the supraoptic nucleus (SO). The SO contains neurosecretory neurones 
that produce and secrete oxytocin and vasopressin. These cells display an apamin- 
sensitive I a h p  (Bourque and Brown, 1987), which is important for the regulation of 
the SO-neurones rhythmicity and, therefore, influences the secretion of hormones 
(Kirkpatrick and Bourque, 1996). The pharmacological properties of this current and 
in situ hybridisation indicated that SK3 is likely to be the channel underlying the I a h p  
in SO neurones (Bourqueand Brown, 1987; Stocker and Pedarzani 2000). 
Immunohistochemistry performed with the anti-CSK3 antibody indicated that the SO 
exhibited one of the highest levels of SK3 expression in the rat brain. In this area, 
SK3 immunoreactivity was very dense and cellular structures were hardly visible. In 
some neurones (such as the one marked with a black arrow in Figure 6.10 B), 
immunostaining was associated with somata and dendrites, whereas nuclei appeared 
clearer. However, the most intense signal within the supraoptic nucleus was visible at 
the base of the nucleus (black arrowheads in Fig. 6.10 A), which is a region rich in 
glial cells, and was associated to thick filamentous structures (white arrows in Fig.
6.10 B). These observations indicated that in the supraoptic nucleus the SK3 a
1 4 6
subunit might be expressed not only in neurones but also in glial processes. In order 
to test this hypothesis, co-labelling immunofluorescence experiments (2.2.15.5) were 
performed by using the affinity purified anti-CSK3 antibody together with the glial 
marker anti-GFAP monoclonal antibody (Fig. 6.10 C). In this experiment, SK3
immunofluorescence staining was detected using the TSA Biotin System to 
amplify the signal (green in the Fig. 6.10 C). SK3 signal overlapped with the GFAP 
signal at the base of the supraoptic nucleus, indicating that glial cells present in this 
area express the SK3 protein (Fig. 6.10 C).
FIGURE 6.10: SK3 expression in the supraoptic nucleus. Immunohistochemistry with the affinity 
purified anti-CSK3 (1:17,500) was performed on P25 sagittal (A, B) and coronal (C) sections o f rat 
brain. A: SK3 immunoreactivity in the supraoptic nucleus (SO) was particularly intense at the base o f  
the nucleus (black arrowheads). B: High magnification picture o f SO. A neuronal profile is indicated

and the anti-GFAP monoclonal antibody (1:500). SK3 signal was detected using the TSA Biotin 
System in combination with the ABC system and with FITC-conjugated Avidin. Anti-mouse Cy3 
antibodies (1:600) were used to detect the GFAP signal. The picture was kindly provided by H. 
Morgan, ox, optic chiasm. Scale bar: A, B, 20 pm; C, 50 pm.
6.3.6 SK3 distribution in the dorsal vagal nucleus and in the hypoglossal nucleus
Within the brainstem, a particularly intense SK3 signal was observed in the dorsal 
vagal nucleus (DVN) and in the hypoglossal nucleus.
Pharmacological studies indicated that, in DVN neurones, homomeric SK3 channels 
underlie the I a h p , which regulates the spontaneous firing frequency of these cells 
(Pedarzani et al., 2000). As shown in Figure 6.11 A, immunohistochemistry 
experiments indicated that high levels of SK3 expression were detected in DVN 
neurones. The signal was associated to the somata and proximal dendrites. Moreover, 
SK3 signal was present in the fibre bundles that exit the DVN nucleus laterally (Fig.
6.11 A, black arrows). These fibres are likely to represent DVN neurone axons that
1 4 7
form the vagus nerve. Figure 6.11 B, where immunostained fibres are clearly visible, 
shows a high magnification of the region labelled in Figure 6.11 A (black arrows). 
These observations indicate axonal localisation of SK3 a  subunit in DVN neurones. 
In the hypoglossal nucleus, intense SK3 immunoreactivity was restricted to somata 
and to numerous thin varicose fibres (Fig. 6.11 C, black arrows). Neuronal nuclei 
were devoid of immunostaining. Prominent SK3 immunoreactivity was also visible 
in numerous fibres that exit the hypoglossal nucleus ventrally (Fig. 6.11 D). These 
fibres are likely to represent the axons that project ventrally from the hypoglossal 
neurones and converge in the hypoglossal nerve. (Fig. 6.11 D).

hypoglossal nucleus. Immunohistochemistry on P25 rat coronal sections using the anti-CSK3 affinity 
purified antibody (1:17,500). A: Intense signal was visible in the DVN (10) and in fibres groups 
(black arrows). SK3 was highly expressed also in the hypoglossal nucleus (12). B: High magnification

somata and fibres in the hypoglossal nucleus. The arrows indicate the fibres. D: Fibres immunostained 
with SK3 signal are located ventrally to the hypoglossal nucleus. Scale bars: A, 200 pm; B, 40 pm; C, 
D, 20 pm.
6.3.7 SK3 distribution in monoaminergic neurones
High to moderate SK3 immunoreactivity was detected in monoaminergic brain areas 
such as the substantia nigra (SNC)-ventral tegmental (VTA) area dopaminergic 
system, the locus coeruleus and the dorsal raphe. We analysed the subcellular 
localisation of the SK3 a  subunit in these areas and correlated the protein expression 
with the monoaminergic neurone profiles.
As mentioned earlier, a prominent SK3 immunoreactivity was observed in SNC and 
in scattered neurones of SNR. The SNC is composed of a layer of densely packed 
dopaminergic neurones that revealed intense SK3 immunorectivity (Fig. 6.12 A and
B). Immunostained somata were visible throughout the SNC dopaminergic neurones 
layer (Fig.6.12 A and B). Additionally, SK3 immunoreactivity was associated to the 
long apical dendrites invading the pars reticulata and to the basal dendrites laterally 
spread within the pars compacta (Fig. 6.12 C). A somato-dendritic distribution was 
also visible in scattered neurones of the SNR (Fig. 6.12 A and D). In this region, in 
addition to the principal GABA-ergic neurones, a subpopulation of scattered 
multipolar dopaminergic neurones is present. The scattered pattern (Fig. 6.12 A) and 
the morphologic features (Fig. 6.12 D) of SK3-labelled neurones in the SNC suggest 
that SK3 a  subunit is selectively expressed in the dopaminergic neurones of this 
area.
SK3 immunoreactivity was also observed in the VTA (Fig. 6.12 A). However, the 
signal in this area was less intense than that in the SNR. This observation correlates 
with electophysiological studies reporting that a smaller SK-mediated I a h p  is 
detected in the VTA compared with the current recorded in dopaminergic neurones 
of the SNC (Wolfart et al., 2001). At the subcellular level, SK3 signal was associated 
to somato-dendritic neuronal profiles.
FIGURE 6.12: Expression of SK3 in the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental nucleus.
Immunohistochemistry was performed on coronal sections o f P25 rats with the affinity purified anti- 
CSK3 antibody (1:17,500). A: SK3 immunoreactivity was detected in the substantia nigra pars 
compacta (SNC), in scattered neurones o f the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) and in the ventral 
tegmental nucleus (VTA). The subcellular localisation o f  SK3 channels was somato-dendritic in the 
SNC (B, C) and in scattered neurones o f the SNR (D). Scale bars: A, 200 pm; B, 100 pm; C, 40 pm; 
D, 20 pm.
The locus coeruleus (LC) is composed of a homogeneous group of noradrenergic 
neurones. In this region, the SK3 immunoreactivity was very dense. The signal was 
distributed in somata of most LC neurones (Fig. 6.13), whereas cellular nuclei were 
free of SK3 signal. Additionally, SK3 immunostaining was associated with thick 
neuronal processes (Fig. 6.13, white arrows). Numerous thin fibres that were positive 
to SK3 immunostaining were also visible throughout the LC, indicating axonal 
localisation of SK3 a  subunit (Fig. 6.13, black arrows). Given the complexity of the 
afferent/efferent projections of LC neurones, it is difficult to assess the origin of the 
SK3-positive axons within the LC.
FIGURE 6.13: Cellular localisation of SK3 a  subunit in neurones of the locus coeruleus.
Immunohistochemistry on P25 sagittal sections with the imraunopurified anti-CSK3 antibody 
(1:17,500) revealed that the SK3 protein was distributed in locus coeruleus neuronal somata and 
processes. The white arrows indicate neuronal dendrites; the black arrows indicate fibres that were 
immunostained with SK3 immunoreactivity. Scale bar: 20 pm.
Finally, the distribution of SK3 was analysed in the dorsal raphe (DR) serotonergic 
neurones, where the anti-CSK3 antibody detected moderate expression of the 
channel. As shown in the Figure 6.14, immunoreactivity was restricted to somata and 
proximal dendrites of small DR neurones.
FIGURE 6.14: Expression of SK3 channels in the dorsal raphe. Immunohistochemistry on coronal 
sections with the anti-CSK3 immunopurified antibody (1:17,500) revealed that SK3 was expressed in 
the dorsal raphe (A). High magnification analysis indicated that the SK3 protein was localised in
somata and in the proximal portion o f dendrites o f dorsal raphe neurones. Scale bars: A, 200 pm, B, 
40 pm.
6.4 Developmental regulation of SK3 distribution in monoaminergic neurones
Changes in ion channel composition and electrical excitability are crucial during the 
development of the central nervous system. In particular, fluctuations of intracellular 
Ca2+ have been shown to have a central role in the maturation of single neurones and
neuronal networks (Spitzer et al.,1995). Given their high sensitivity to Ca , SK
94 -  
channels might have an important role in the regulation of Ca transients. However, 
limited information is available on the role of SK channels in neuronal development. 
Developmental downregulation of the expression of SK2 channels has been shown to 
influence the firing properties of developing Pukinje neurones and possibly
contribute to the regulation of Ca transients and oscillations during the first two 
weeks after birth (Cingolani et al., 2002). We investigated whether any change in the 
distribution of SK3 a  subunit occurs during the first stages of postnatal development 
in substantia nigra-VTA, locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe. In the previous 
paragraph, we have shown that SK3 channels are expressed in monoaminergic 
neurones of these areas. In all three regions, the expression of the channel has been 
shown to affect the firing properties of these neurones (Worfart et al, 2001; 
Osmanovich et al., 1990; Osmanovic et al., 1993; Freedman and Aghajanian, 1987) 
and, possibly, to influence the release of the different monoamines. An intriguing 
aspect of the expression of SK3 monoaminergic neurones is related to the proposed, 
but still controversial, involvement of the gene that encodes SK3 in schizophrenia 
(Chandy et al., 1998; Gargus et al., 1998; Jobber et al., 1999). This adds a further 
level of interest to the analysis of the developmental regulation of SK3 expression, 
given the numerous lines of evidences indicating a role of developmental processes 
in schizophrenia (Rapoport et al., 2005).
The distribution of the SK3 channel was analysed in PI and P3 rat brains. The 
affinity purified anti-CSK3 antibody was used in immunohistochemistry experiments 
following the protocol described in 2.2.15.2, which is based on the use of detergent 
(Triton-X-100) to permeabilise the tissue during the blocking and the primary 
antibody incubation. However, generally, sections of tissue from young animals
exhibited a higher background compared with that of P25 rat brains and displayed 
poor cellular resolution. Therefore, we tested also a protocol where the tissue was 
permeabilised by freeze/thawing omitting Triton-XlOO (2.2.15.3). When this 
protocol was used, the distribution pattern of the SK3 protein was identical to the one 
observed with the protocol 2.2.15.2, but the signal to background ratio and the 
cellular definition were improved. Therefore, results obtained using both protocols 
are reported in this paragraph.
The signal intensity obtained in the immunohistochemistry experiments on postnatal 
brains was generally weaker than that in P25 rats. However, in the substantia nigra, 
SK3 a  subunit displayed high expression in dopaminergic neurones of the SNC and 
in scattered neurones of the SNR (Fig. 6.15 A and B). Similar to the results obtained 
on P25 rats, SK3 immunoreactivity was localised in the somato-dendritic 
compartment of these neurones. A less intense SK3 immunostaining was observed in 
the VTA, where, owing to the low intensity of the signal, it was difficult to assess the 
subcellular localisation of the protein. A similar difference in SK3 expression levels 
between VTA and SN has been observed also in P25 brains. Taken together, these 
results indicate that SK3 is expressed in the early phases of postnatal development in 
the SN-VTA dopaminergic system, with a similar expression profile to the one 
observed in P25 rats. Moreover, no change in the subcellular localisation of the SK3 
channel was observed in the SN dopaminergic neurones.

was used in immunohistochemistry experiments on coronal sections o f PI (A) and P3 (B) rat brains. 
SK3 immunoreactivity was detected in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) and in scattered 
neurones of the substantia nigra pars reticulate (SNR). Somato-dendritic immunostaining was
observed in SNC dopaminergic neurones, whereas a lower intensity signal was detected in the ventral 
tegmental area. Scale bar: 200 pm.
In noradrenergic neurones of the locus coeruleus, SK3 immunoreactivity was 
detected on PI and P3 brain tissue (Fig. 6.16). In both developmental stages, an 
intense signal was present in the neuronal somata and in numerous processes 
resembling axonal profiles (Fig 6.16 B, D). Also in this case, the cellular localisation 
of the SK3 channel that was observed in these postnatal stages is similar to the 
localisation in P25 rats.

Scale bar: C, 40 pm; D, 20 pm.
Serotoninergic neurones of the dorsal raphe revealed a very weak SK3 signal in PI 
and P3 animals (Fig. 6.17). Given the low intensity of the immunostaining, it is not 
possible to determine the subcellular localisation of the protein. Comparison of this 
signal with the one in P25 animals (Fig. 6.14) suggests that, in this brain region, there 
might be a developmental upregulation of the expression of the SK3 a  subunit.

CHAPTER 7 
Determinants of apamin sensitivity in SK channels
7.1 Introduction
The three members of the SK channel family, SKI, SK2 and SK3, differ in their 
apamin sensitivity. Homomeric SK2 channels from rat (rSK2), mouse (mSK2) and 
human (hSK2) exhibit the highest sensitivity, whereas homomeric human SKI 
channels (hSKl) are the least apamin sensitive channels of the SK channel family 
(Kohler 1996, Strobaek 2000, Shah 2000, Stocker et al., 2004a-b). The behaviour of 
the rat rSKl subunit is different than hSKl, because rSKl is not expressed as a 
functional channel either in oocytes or in mammalian cell lines (Benton et al., 2003; 
Dhoedt et al., 2004). The chimeric rSKl a  subunit, rSKlNSK2 -csK2 , where the 
carboxy- and amino-terminal domains of rSKl have been replaced with the 
corresponding regions of rSK2, forms functional channels (Dhoedt et al., 2004). 
However, the current generated by the rSKlNSK2 -csK2 chimera is only marginally 
inhibited by 100 nM apamin, whereas apamin inhibits hSKl with an IC50 of 3nM 
(D'hoedt et al., 2004). The difference in apamin sensitivity between this chimera and 
hSKl is surprising because: (i) the molecular determinants of apamin sensitivity have 
been allocated in the region between transmembrane segment S5 and S6, which 
comprises the pore of potassium channels (Ishii, 1997; Shakkottai, 2001); (ii) the 
primary sequence of the S5-S6 region of hSKl and of rSKlNSK2 -csK2 chimera is 
identical (Fig. 7.1). Altogether these observations suggest that amino acids located 
outside the pore are most likely involved in the sensitivity to apamin.
In this chapter, we address the question as to whether regions other than the pore of 
the a  subunit of SK channels influence the apamin sensitivity of these channels. The 
present work has been done in collaboration with Drs. A. Nolting and D. Dhoedt 
who performed the electrophysiological experiments.

FIGURE 7.1: Alignment of the primary sequence of rSKl and hSKl. The alignment shows that 
the primary sequence of the S5-S6 region is identical in hSKl and rSKl. The six transmembrane 
segments (S1-S6) and the pore region (P-region) are represented as grey boxes. The different amino 
acids are labelled in black.
7.2 Apamin sensitivity of SK channels is affected by regions outside the pore
The most obvious regions outside the pore that might have an influence on apamin- 
sensitivity are the extracellular loops LI, that connects transmembrane segment SI 
and S2, and L3, which is located between transmembrane segment S3 and S4. 
Inspection of the primary sequences of LI and L3 revealed that one amino acid is 
different between hSKl and rSKlNSK2 -csK2 in LI, and four amino acid are different in 
L3 (Fig. 7.1). Therefore, two chimeras, Ll-hSKl (2.2.17.2) and L3-hSKl (2.2.17.3),
were constructed in order to analyse these regions. Ll-hSKl was generated by 
substituting LI of rSKlNSK2 -csK2  with the corresponding region of hSKl. L3-hSKl 
was generated by substituting L3 of rSKlNSK2 -csK2 with the corresponding region of 
hSKl. The chimeras were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells. Patch clamp 
recordings were performed in the whole-cell configuration. The chimeric channels
were activated by 1 pM free Ca present in the intracellular solution (130 KC1 mM, 
10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA at pH 7.2, MgCl2 and CaCL adjusted to obtain 1 pM
free Ca ). The currents were elicited by voltage ramps of 400 ms duration, ranging 
from -140 mV to +40 mV, and were repeated every 10 s. The measurements were 
performed in nearly symmetrical K+ (extracellular solution: 144 mM KC1, 10 mM 
HEPS, 2 mM CaCL, 1 mM MgCh, 10 mM D-Glucose, pH 7.4 with KOH) which 
resulted in a reversal potential of the current near to 0 mV. A shift of the reversal 
potential towards hyperpolarized values was obtained when the extracellular K+ 
concentration was reduced to 4 mM. The observed reversal potentials correspond to 
values predicted by the Nemst equation for a K+ conductance.
Ll-hSKl and L3-hSKl form functional homomeric channels (Fig. 7.2 A, B). The 
application of 100 nM apamin resulted in almost no inhibition of the current 
generated by Ll-hSKl (7  9%, n=5, Fig. 7.2 A). This inhibition was similar to the 
one obtained for rSKlNsK2 -csK2 - In contrast, -50%  of the currents generated by L3- 
hSKl were inhibited by 5 nM apamin (52  5%, n=3, Fig. 7.2 B), thereby 
demonstrating an apamin sensitivity similar to hSK l. These results indicate that the 
extracellular loop between S3 and S4 influences apamin sensitivity and might 
explain the observed difference in apamin sensitivity between hSKl and rSKl.

current traces o f HEK 293 cells that express the chimera L3-hSKl. 5 nM apamin inhibited 52  5% 
(n=3) o f the current.
7.3 Identification of amino acids outside the pore that affect apamin sensitivity 
of SK channels
Because amino acids that are located outside the pore influence apamin sensitivity of 
the rSKlNSK2 -csK2 chimera, we were interested in knowing whether this property is a 
peculiarity of the chimera or also a feature of other SK channels. To address this 
question, we generated another chimera of hSKl, which is the least apamin-sensitive 
SK subunit, and of SK2, which is the most apamin-sensitive SK subunit. The 
chimera, named hSKl-SK2-hSKl (2.2.17.4), was generated by substituting the 
region that starts from the end of SI and ends at the beginning of transmembrane 
segment S4 of hSKl with the corresponding region of SK2 (Fig. 7.2). If regions that 
are located outside the pore affect the apamin sensitivity of the channel, then hSKl- 
SK2-hSKl should be more sensitive to apamin than hSKl. On the contrary, if  the 
pore is the only region of the channel involved in apamin binding, then the chimera 
should have similar apamin sensitivity than hSKl. To test these two possibilities, 
hSKl-SK2-hSKl was transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells and Ca2+-activated K+ 
currents were elicited as described earlier. hSKl-SK2-hSKl formed functional 
homomeric channels; its apamin sensitivity was tested by applying 300 nM apamin, a 
concentration that is known not to affect hSKl but inhibits SK2 almost completely. 
As shown in Figure 7.2, 300 nM apamin suppressed >50% of the current generated 
by hSKl-SK2-hSKl (58  3%, n=5), indicating that the chimera is more sensitive to 
apamin than hSKl. From these experiments we conclude that regions located outside 
the pore contribute to the different apamin sensitivity of hSKl and rSK2. Moreover, 
these results suggest the involvement of regions other than the pore in apamin 
sensitivity might be a feature of all the SK subunits.

Recordings were performed in the presence o f 1 pM intracellular Ca2+ and in symmetrical K+, as 
described in the legend o f Figure 7.2. After application o f 300 nM apamin, 58  3% current inhibition 
was observed (n=5).
Following these observations, we aimed to identify the amino acids outside the pore 
which contribute to apamin sensitivity of the SK channels a  subunits. In hSKl-SK2- 
hSKl, the complete region between the end of the transmembrane segment SI and 
the beginning of transmembrane segment S4 was exchanged with the corresponding 
region of rSK2. However, the amino acids that are most likely to be responsible for 
the increased sensitivity of the chimera are located in LI or L3. Based on the 
observation that the extracellular loop L3, but not LI, influences the apamin- 
sensitivity of rSKlNSK2 -csx2  (Fig. 7.2), we decided to focus on differences in the 
amino acid sequences of hSKl and SK2 in L3.
As shown in the alignment of Figure 7.4 A, eight amino acids differ between the L3 
loop of hSKl and the L3 loop of rSK2. These eight different amino acids in hSKl 
were replaced with the corresponding amino acids of rSK2. In four mutants a single 
amino acid was exchanged, whereas in two mutants we introducing double amino 
acid exchanges. The following six mutants were therefore generated (2.2.17.6):
 in hSKl-H204N, hSKl-R206T and hSKl-E223T, a charged amino acid of 
hSKl was substituted with a neutral amino acid in the corresponding 
positions of rSK2;
 in hSKl-VA221/222TT, two hydrophobic amino acids in hSKl were 
replaced with two hydrophilic residues in the corresponding position of rSK2;
 in hSKl-T216S and hSKl-VL228/229II, hydrophobic or hydrophilic amino 
acids were exchanged for amino acids of the same character.
Each of these mutants was expressed in HEK 293 cells and formed functional
 I j   # #
homomeric Ca -activated K channels. The apamin sensitivity of the mutants was 
tested by applying 3 nM apamin. Apamin was used at 3nM because this 
concentration corresponds to the IC50 measured for hSKl and, therefore, making it 
possible to measure even small changes in sensitivity towards the toxin. By 
performing these measurements, we wanted to test whether any of the mutated amino 
acids affects apamin sensitivity of rSK2. If this is the case, then the corresponding 
mutations in hSKl should result in a higher apamin sensitivity than the one measured 
for hSKl. Figure 7.4 shows the results that were obtained with all mutants. 
Substitution of three charged amino acids of hSKl with the corresponding uncharged 
amino acid of hSK2 did not change the sensitivity of the channels to apamin. In fact, 
3 nM apamin inhibited -50% of the current generated by hSKl-H204N (Fig. 7.4 B), 
hSKl-R206T (Fig. 7.4 C) and hSKl-E223T mutants (Fig. 7.4 D). Similarly, hSKl- 
VA221/222TT (Fig. 7.4 E) and hSKl-VL228/229II (Fig. 7.4 F) mutants did not 
show any change in the sensitivity to the toxin. However, the hSKl-T216S mutant 
generated a current that was substantially inhibited (80%) by 3 nM apamin (Fig 7.4 
G). The concentration-response curve of hSKl-T216S revealed an IC50 value of 
apamin of 167 pM (A. Nolting personal communication). This indicates that hSKl- 
T216S is -20 times more sensitive to apamin than hSKl (IC50 3.2 mM) and -5  times 
less sensitive to apamin then SK2 (IC50 30 pM) (A. Nolting personal 
communication). All together these results show that we have identified a single 
amino acid located in the extracellular loop between S3 and S4 that is largely 
responsible for the difference in apamin sensitivity that is observed between hSKl 
and SK2.

CHAPTER 8 
Discussion
8.1 Characterisation of the anti-NSK2 antibody
Specificity o f  the anti-NSK2 antibody. The study of the precise subcellular 
localisation of ion channels is important to understand their specific role in neuronal 
function. Immunohistochemistry has been extensively used to study the distribution 
and the subcellular localisation of ion channels in the brain (Trimmer and Rhodes,
2004). The success of the immunohistochemical studies and the quality of the 
resulting data rely entirely on the specificity of the antibodies used. For this reason, 
the characterisation of the antibody represents an absolutely critical step. Since one 
of the aims of this work is the study of the cellular distribution of neuronal SK2 
channels, I extensively characterised a fusion protein antibody directed towards 
amino-terminal domain of the SK2 a  subunit. The specificity of this antibody and its 
ability to recognise the SK2 protein have been demonstrated with different 
experiments. In order to ensure highest antibody specificity, affinity purification of 
the anti-NSK2 serum was performed. Following the purification, ELISA assays 
showed that the purified antibody contained'immunoglobulins that recognise the 
pET-NSK2 fusion protein but not GST. The purified antibody was able to recognise 
specifically the SK2 protein recombinantly expressed in HEK 293 cells in 
immunofluorescence assay and in Western blot, where a single immunoreactive band 
of -50 kDa was recognised. In rat brain tissue, the affinity purified anti-NSK2 
antibody revealed the existence of two SK2 proteins of -50 kDa and -80 kDa. In 
agreement with the data observed in recombinant expression system, the -50  kDa 
band represents SK2. The apparent molecular weight of this band is lower than the 
molecular weight of 63 kDa predicted from the primary sequence of SK2. 
Anomalous mobility on SDS-PAGE might result from post-translational 
modifications such as glycosylation or phosphorylation. Glycosylation cannot 
explain the anomalous running of SK2 because it affects the mobility of proteins on 
SDS-PAGE resulting, most frequently, in bands with higher molecular weight than 
the molecular weight calculated from the primary sequence of the protein (e.g. 
Bennet, 2002). Furthermore, SK channels do not contain extracellular N-linked 
glycosylation consensus sequences (Kohler et al., 1996). Phosphorylation can also 
affect the running behaviour of proteins and can result in proteins that migrate faster 
in SDS gels (Silva-Neto et al., 1996). SK2 channels are directly phosphorylated by 
PKA (Ren et al., 2006); therefore, one possibility to explain the anomalous running
of SK2 might be that the subunit is phosphorylated. Furthermore, incomplete 
denaturation might also result in aberrant running behaviour.
The second band, of ~80 kDa, detected in the Western blot, corresponds to a novel 
SK2 isoform. This variant, called SK2-860, is characterised by an extended amino- 
terminal domain and, therefore, results in an higher molecular weight protein 
compared to the originally cloned SK2. A similar variant has been recently reported 
in mouse brain, where Western analysis demonstrated the existence of two SK2 
species of 49 and 78 kDa (Strassmaier et al., 2005), similar to our study in rat. The 
detection of two SK2 proteins is not in agreement with previous Western analysis 
with a different anti-SK2 antibody that detects a single band of 67 kDa, in rat, and 64 
kDa, in mouse (Sailer et al., 2002; Sailer et al., 2004). The single bands identified 
might correspond to the high molecular weight SK2 variant. However, a second band 
corresponding to the -50 kDa identified in our study (Fig. 3.5 C) and reported by 
Strassmaier and colleagues was not identified, and the reason for this discrepancy is 
not known.
In some Western blot experiments, a third band of -130 kDa was detected by the 
affinity purified anti-NSK2 antibody (Fig. 3.5 C). Given its molecular weight, the 
band, most likely, represents SK2 protein aggregates. Surprisingly, although the 
preadsorption of the antibody resulted in the compete loss of the two SK2 bands, the 
130 kDa band was not eliminated. This might be explained by the fact that the 
aggregates contain a high number of antibody binding sites; therefore, they are 
detected even in the presence of extremely low amounts of free antibodies, which 
have not bound to the antigen during the preadsorbtion incubation. However, when 
we perform immunohistochemistry experiments with the purified anti-NSK2 
antibody preadsorbed with the antigen, we detect no signal (Fig. 4.1 B). This 
observation supports the notion that the antibody is specific and that the 130 kDa 
band is likely an aggregate of SK2 subunits.
Epitope mapping o f  the anti-NSK2 antibody. We identified one linear epitope of the 
the anti-NSK2 antibody. This epitope corresponds to the sequence QPPASVVGG in 
the amino-terminal part of the NSK2 antigenic determinant. The epitope has been 
identified by using the peptide scan method and a PepSPOTs membrane which have 
been extensively used for epitope mapping of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies 
(Kobayashi and Jones, 1999; Reineke et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2004).
The identification of this sequence fostered the idea to use the corresponding 
synthetic peptide (QP-GG peptide) to attempt the purification of the corresponding 
antibodies from the anti-NSK2 serum. However, the resulting purification had a 
particularly low IgG concentration, indicating that the antibodies recognising this 
epitope most likely represent only a small pool of antibodies. The ELISA assay 
indicates that the purified antibodies detect the QP-GG peptide conjugated to BSA 
and does not detect GST. Furthermore, the ELISA shows that virtually all the 
antibodies specific for the peptide have been purified from the anti-NSK2 serum, 
since the flow through showed only low detection of the QP-GG peptide conjugated 
to BSA. The purified antibody is able to detect native SK2 subunits expressed in 
HEK 293 cells, as supported by immunofluorescence and Western blot experiments. 
Surprisingly, on rat brain membranes, the purified antibody detects only a 90 kDa 
protein. This unexpected result differs from the bands observed in the previous 
experiments with the antibody purified by using the pET-NSK2 fusion protein (75 
and 50 kDa bands) (Fig. 3.5) and from data obtained in immunoblots of mouse brain 
membranes with different SK2 antibodies (49 and 78 kDa bands) (Bond et al., 2004; 
Strassmaier et al., 2005). One likely explanation for this discrepancy might be that 
the antibody concentration of this purification is too low to detect native SK2 
subunits on brain tissue and the antibody probably crossreacts with a different 
protein highly expressed in brain, that corresponds to the 90 kDa band. On the 
contrary, the purification that was performed with the pET-NSK2 fusion protein 
results in the isolation of a mixture of antibody populations directed towards many 
different epitopes. All together these antibodies recognise different SK2 antigenic 
determinants and are able to detect the native SK2 proteins both in recombinant 
expression systems and in brain tissue.
Because of the discrepancies observed in the Western blot on rat brain, and the 
extremely small amounts of antibody that could be isolated, the antibody purified 
with the QP-GG peptide was not used for the immunohistochemical studies.
8.2 Distribution of SK2 in the rat brain
Immunohistochemical localisation o f  SK2 a  subunit The immunohistochemical 
studies with the anti-NSK2 antibody reveal that the SK2 a  subunit is widely 
distributed in the rat brain. In the regions that were analysed, I found a good
correlation between the signal detected by the anti-NSK2 antibody and the 
distribution described for the SK2 transcripts (Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000), 
supporting that both finding describe the SK2 distribution and confirming the 
specificity of the antibody. Thus, for example, regions such as hippocampus, 
neocortex, amygdala and thalamus express high levels of SK2 proteins. On the 
contrary, in the nucleus accumbens, that is one of the few brain areas where SK2 
mRNAs were not detected, low SK2 immunoreactivity has been observed.
SK2 distribution in hippocampus and cortex. The strongest SK2 protein expression 
has been observed in the pyramidal neurones of the neocortical layer V and of the 
CA1-CA3 regions of the hippocampus. The high levels of expression in these brain 
regions correlate well with functional data indicating the presence of apamin- 
sensitive I a h p  currents in layer V pyramidal neurones (Schwidt et al., 1992), in CA1 
(Stocker et al., 1999) and CA3 (Sailer et al., 2002) hippocampal pyramidal neurones. 
In agreement with mRNA distribution (Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000; Tacconi et al., 
2001), no SK3 immunoreactivity was detected in neocortex and hippocampal CA1- 
CA3 pyramidal layers (Fig. 6.3). On the contrary, SKI subunit is expressed in these 
brain regions, as shown by in situ hybridisation (Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000) and 
immunohistochemical data (Sailer et al., 2002; Sailer et al., 2004). These 
observations might suggest that SK2 and SKI subunits form heteromeric channels 
and contribute to the generation of the I a h p  current. Although it is not clear whether 
such heteromeric assembly occurs in vivo; in heterologous expression systems SKI 
and SK2 subunits form heteromeric channels that display reduced apamin sensitivity 
compared with homomeric SK2 channels (Benton et al., 2003). In CA1 pyramidal 
neurones, the I a h p  current is inhibited by apamin concentrations that are about eight 
times higher than the apamin concentration necessary to block SK2 homomeric 
channels in heterologous systems (Stocker et al., 1999), supporting the hypothesis 
that the apamin-insensitive SKI subunit, together with SK2, might indeed be a 
component of the channel that generates the native current. However, a recent study 
on transgenic mice lacking the SK2 subunit indicate that SK2 channels are necessary 
and sufficient to generate the I a h p  current in CA1 pyramidal neurones, excluding the 
possibility that SKI contributes to the current (Bond et al., 2004). Taking this 
observation into consideration, it is likely that SK2 is the only component of the 
channel generating the I a h p  also in the other neuronal types where SKI and SK2 are
co-expressed, like, for example, CA3 and neocortical layer V pyramidal neurones. 
Further electrophysiological experiments on these brain regions on the transgenic 
mice might confirm this hypothesis.
The analysis of CA1 pyramidal neurones at high resolution indicates that SK2 
subunits are localised in the somata and in the proximal portion of the apical 
dendrites. The SK2 signal in the proximal dendrites is in agreement with other 
immunohistochemical results (Sailer et al., 2002; Sailer et al., 2004). On the 
contrary, SK2 expression in the somata does not correlate with the data of Sailer and 
colleagues that report only a limited somatic SK2 signal. Localisation of SK2 in 
somata and proximal dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurones is also supported 
by immunocytochemistry on postnatal primary cultures (Fig. 4.9). A recent study 
proposed the localisation of SK channels in the distal apical dendrites of 
hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurones, where they terminate plateau potentials and 
limit the spread of dendritic calcium spikes (Cai et al., 2004). SK2 is very likely to be 
the channel subunit that mediate this effect because, as discussed above, SK2 is the 
only SK subunit underlying the apamin-sensitive I a h p  current in CAI pyramidal 
neurones (Bond et al, 2004). However, immunohistochemistry on brain sections and 
on postnatal hippocampal neurones, did not detect SK2 in the distal parts of the 
dendrites, probably due to detection limitations.
Developmental expression o f  SK2 in cultured postnatal hippocampal neurones.
Interestingly, the expression of SK2 seems to be developmentally regulated in vitro 
as an increase of the SK2 signal intensity in the somata and neurites is observed after 
two days in vitro (DIV), and the highest SK2 signal is reached between 10 and 13 
DIV (Fig. 4.9). This observation correlates with electrophysiological studies 
performed at different stages of the post-natal hippocampal culture, that indicate a 
progressive increase of the number of neurones expressing apamin-sensitive I a h p  
currents (R. Tonini personal communication). The maximum number of neurones 
expressing the current is reached within 10 and 13 DIV, suggesting that the observed 
increase of SK2 protein expression might explain the progressive increase of the 
current. However, other mechanisms might also account for the I a h p  current increase. 
For example, in immature hippocampal pyramidal neurons the SK2 channels might 
be separated from the calcium channels that mediate their activation and, during 
development, a progressive organisation might lead to an improved functional
coupling. Alternatively, the neurones at the initial stages in vitro might have smaller 
Ca2+ currents, resulting in reduced intracellular Ca2+ transients in response to 
membrane depolarization. Another possibility might be that, in young neurons, 
different mechanisms of calcium buffering and calcium clearance might result in 
smaller increase of the intracellular calcium concentration compared to mature 
neurons. Surprisingly, SK2 signal cannot be detected when the 
immunocytochemistry is performed on cultures prepared from rats at embryonic day 
17-18 (E l7-E l8) (Fig. 4.8). At this developmental stage SK2 transcripts are present, 
as shown by Northern blot analysis (M. Stocker personal communication). The 
observed lack of SK2 signal in the cultured neurones might suggest that, although the 
SK2 transcripts are present, the protein is not expressed. Alternatively, the SK2 
subunits might be already expressed at E l7, but the isolation procedure and the 
culture conditions of the neurones may cause changes in the SK2 channel densities 
that result in the lack of SK2 signal.
SK2 is expressed in hippocampal interneurones. In the postnatal cultures, SK2 
protein is also expressed in the somatodendritic compartment of the hippocampal 
intemeurones (Fig. 4.10). This is consistent with the SK2 signal observed in scattered 
neurones of the stratum oriens and radiatum on brain sections (Fig. 4.2). and with the 
characterisation of an apamin-sensitive I a h p  current that contributes to the mAHP in 
the CA3 stratum radiatum intemeurones (Savic et al., 2001).
SK2 expression in the amygdala. In the amygdala, high expression levels of SK2 
have been detected in the basolateral nucleus and, with lower intensity, in the lateral 
amygdaloid nucleus (Fig. 4.4). In the pyramidal neurones of the lateral amygdaloid 
nucleus, an apamin-sensitive I a h p  has been described (Faber and Sah, 2002). 
Interestingly, the lateral amygdaloid nucleus, does not express SK3 (Fig. 6.8). These 
observations, together with the absence of SKI mRNA (Stocker and Pedarzani, 
2000) in the lateral amygdala, indicate that homomeric somatodendritic SK2 
channels underlay the I a h p  described in this area. In the lateral amygdaloid nucleus, 
beside the glutamatergic pyramidal-like neurones, a population GABA-ergic 
intemeurones is present. Further experiments based on the use of specific markers 
might clarify whether the expression of the SK2 protein is limited to the pyramidal 
cells or if also the GABA-ergic intemeurones express the SK2 subunit. Recently, it 
has been shown that SK channels act as feed-back regulators of synaptic activity at
glutamatergic synapses of the lateral amygdala pyramidal neurones (Faber et al., 
2005). In view of these findings, it would be interesting to study the localisation of 
SK2 subunits at the spines of these neurones. Expression of SK channels at synapses 
seems to be particularly low and the distribution of SK2 subunits in spines of CAI 
pyramidal neurones has been only observed upon overexpression of SK2 channels 
(Ngo-Anh et al., 2005). The use of antibodies with high affinity might allow the 
detection of synaptic SK2 channels and their physical colocalisation with NMDA 
receptors.
SK2 expression in reticular thalamic neurones. In the reticular thalamic neurones, 
SK2 is abundantly expressed (Fig. 4.5 A), but no SK3 signal has been detected (Fig.
6.5 B). Reticular thalamic neurones are GABA-ergic neurones that modulate and 
syncronise the thalamic output. An apamin-sensitive mAHP is present in these 
neurones and is involved in the regulation of the pacemaking properties (Avanzini et 
al., 1989; Bal-McCormick et al., 1993). The immunohistochemistry data support that 
somatodendritic SK2 channels are the channels mediating the I a h p  in these neurones. 
However, based on in situ hybridisation results (Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000) and on 
immunohistochemistry data (Sailer et al., 2004) that support the expression of SKI in 
these neurones, it cannot be excluded that SKI subunits contribute to the formation 
of the channels that underlie the I a h p  current. As discussed previously, 
electrophysiological studies on transgenic animals that lack SK2 indicate that, in 
CAI pyramidal neurones, the SKI subunit does not contribute to the generation of 
the I a h p  current (Bond et al., 2004). Further electrophysiological studies on the SK2 
transgenic mice might clarify whether SK2 is the only molecular determinant of the 
current also in reticular thalamic neurones.
8.3 The rSK2-860 variant
Characterisation o f  a new rSK2 variant: rSK2-860. We report that a novel SK2 
isoform, called SK2-860, is expressed in rat brain along with the originally cloned 
SK2 subunit. This variant is characterised by an extended amino-terminal domain, 
compared with the originally cloned SK2 (Kohler et al., 1996). The native expression 
of the newly identified SK2-860 subunit has been analysed by Western analysis 
using two antibodies: the anti-NSK2 antibody (Chapter 3), that recognises both SK2 
proteins; and the anti-N860, that selectively recognises SK2-860 and is directed to
the extended amino-terminus. Both antibodies recognise a high molecular weight 
protein of ~80 kDa, corresponding to SK2-860; whereas only the anti-NSK2 
antibody detects also the shorter protein corresponding to the originally cloned SK2. 
Although the relative abundance of the two proteins is difficult to assess, the results 
obtained with the anti-NSK2 antibody suggest lower expression levels for the SK2 
subunit (Fig. 3.5 C). The characterisation of a mouse SK2 isoform comparable to 
SK2-860 has recently been reported by Strassmaier and colleagues (Strassmaier et 
al., 2005). Western analysis in the mouse brain revealed the existence of two SK2 
species of 49 and 78 kDa (Strassmaier et al., 2005), similar to our study in rat.
The mechanism responsible for the generation of the two proteins is not clear as yet. 
Given that the predominant SK2 transcript expressed in the rat brain is the SK2-860 
mRNA (Kerschensteiner, 2003), it might be possible that the SK2-860 protein is the 
only protein synthesised and that the generation of the shorter SK2 variant occurs by 
post-translational processing. For example, the activity of a protease might mediate 
the specific cleavage of the extended amino-terminus of the SK2-860 protein. If that 
was the case, a protein fragment of 275 amino acids should be generated. Protein 
fragments corresponding to that length are not detected in the Western blot and a 
reason could be that they have a high turnover and are degraded fast. 
Immunohistochemical localisation o f  rSK2-860. The two available antibodies, anti- 
NSK2 and anti-N860, have been used to analyse the distribution pattern of the SK2 
subunits on rat brain sections. Since the only difference between the two variants 
resides in the extended amino-terminal of SK2-860, it is not possible to generate 
antibodies that selectively identify the short SK2 subunit; therefore the SK2 
distribution cannot be studied in isolation. This limits the possibility to identify brain 
regions, if they exist, where only the SK2-860 is expressed. In general, the two 
antibodies revealed a similar distribution profile, indicating that both SK2 subunits 
might be expressed together in most central neurones. In particular, in the 
hippocampus, SK2 and SK2-860 are likely coexpressed in the CA2 and CA3 regions. 
Differently, in the CA1 pyramidal layer and in the subiculum, SK2 is the 
predominant subunit. Moreover, the two variants are probably co-expressed in 
hippocampal intemeurones of the stratum oriens and radiatum, and in the neocortical 
layer V. This distribution profile of the SK2-860 subunit was in good agreement with 
in situ hybridisation data that support low expression levels of SK2-860 in the CA1
region and subiculum, but high expression levels in neocortical layer V and CA2- 
CA3 regions (Kerschensteiner, 2003). At the cellular level, the SK2-860 signal seem 
to be restricted to the somata and the proximal dendrites of the hippocampal 
pyramidal neurones and intemeurones. However, a more detailed subcellular 
distribution is difficult to assess because an amplification system, based on the 
precipitation of TSA species in proximity of the antigen, was used to amplify the 
SK2-860 immunostaining, and high resolution analysis is limited. Surprisingly, the 
distribution pattern we have observed with the anti-N860 antibody reveals some 
differences with the distribution of SK2-L described in mouse (Strassmaier et al.,
2005). In fact, in mouse, an intense immunostaining for the SK2-L variant is detected 
in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, whereas a weaker signal is detected in CA2 
and CA3 (Strassmaier et al., 2005). At the cellular level, the SK2-L signal is weak in 
the pyramidal layer but strong in the stratum oriens and radiatum of the 
hippocampus, suggesting dendritic localisation of the SK2-L protein; whereas we 
observe somatodendritic localisation of the SK2-860 variant in rat. Furthermore, no 
signal has been reported in the neocortical pyramidal neurones layer V (Strassmaier 
et al., 2005), where, in rat, an intense signal has been observed for the SK2-860 
subunit. The reason for these differences is not known but one possible explanation 
might be the species difference.
The functional role of the newly identified SK2-860 subunit is not clear. The 
observation that the two variants are likely coexpressed in most neuronal types 
suggests that that the two subunits might form heteromeric channels, but whether this 
heteromer has a physiological function has still to be determined. Co- 
immunoprecipitation studies reported that the SK2-L variant co-assembles with SK2 
and with SK3 in mouse brain (Strassmaier et al., 2005). Taking this finding into 
consideration, it is very likely that also the SK2-860 takes part in the formation of 
heteromeric channels. The recombinant expression of SK2-860 in HEK 293 (D. 
Dhoedt personal communication) and SK2-L in CHO cells (Strassmaier et al., 2005) 
results in functional channels generating calcium-activated potassium currents. The 
electrophysiological properties and calcium sensitivity of these currents are similar to 
the properties of the currents generated by the homomeric SK2 subunits (Strassmaier 
et al., 2005), as expected from the complete identity of the core and of the carboxy- 
terminal domain which is responsible for calcium gating of SK channels (Xia et al.,
1 7 4
1998; Keen et al., 1999; Schumacher et al., 2001). This might suggest that the 
subunit might take part to the generation of the I a h p  in vivo.
Exogenous expression o f  SK2-860 in neuronal cells. Although the 
electrophysiological experiments indicate membrane functional targeting of the SK2- 
860 subunit, the immunostaining of cells recombinantly expressing the protein 
revealed a peculiar distribution pattern. In fact, in different cell lines, the SK2-860 
subunit localises in clusters distributed throughout the cytoplasm while no 
immunostaining is associated with the plasma membrane. Co-localisation studies 
with specific markers for lysosomes, nuclear membrane and Golgi apparatus 
revealed that the SK2-860 does not localise in any of these intracellular 
compartments (Dhoedt, 2005). Moreover, although partial overlap was observed 
with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker (D. Dhoedt personal communication), 
the appearance of the clusters diverges from the ER morphology and the potential 
localisation of the SK2-860 subunit in the ER has to be further analysed. Signals 
present in the extended amino-terminal domain might affect the targeting of the 
subunit or induce non-specific protein aggregation. However, the SK2-860 protein 
clusters do not seem to represent aggregates of misfolded protein, as suggested by 
the lack of co-localisation between the SK2-860 clusters and vimentin or ubiquitin 
(Dhoedt, 2005), which are markers of misfolded proteins targeted for degradation 
(Ward et al., 1995; Hicke et al., 1997; Hicke and Dunn, 2003; Johnston et al., 1998). 
Thus, the nature and the subcellular localisation of the SK2-860 protein clusters have 
not been understood.
Although many mechanisms for protein targeting are similar in neurones and 
epithelial cells (Dotti and Simons, 1990), some neuronal proteins have been shown to 
have unexpected localisation when expressed in epithelial cells (reported in Stowell 
and Craig, 1999). Therefore, in order to test whether a different localisation pattern 
was observed in neuronal cells, I characterised the targeting profile of the SK2-860 
subunit in different neuronal types. The exogenous expression of SK2-860 either in 
SCG or in cortical neurons results in the formation of numerous clusters in the 
cytoplasm and in the proximal dendrites. Additionally, in most neurones, partial 
membrane localisation of the SK2-860 protein was observed (Fig. 5.6 inset), 
differently from the non-neuronal cells.
Several hypotheses can be formulated to explain this distribution pattern. One 
possible explanation relies on the idea that SK2-860 is only a component of a protein 
complex that forms a complete channel. The interaction with a so far unknown 
auxiliary subunit or the heteromeric assembly with other SK a  subunits might be 
necessary for the formation of a channel that is efficiently transported to the 
membrane. For instance, the heterologous expression of the Kvl.2 a  subunit results 
in perinuclear localisation and its surface expression is increased upon co-expression 
of the Kvp2 subunit (Shi et al., 1996). It might be possible that the extended amino- 
terminus contains an unknown retention signal or an aggregation motif responsible 
for the clustering. The interaction with another channel component might be 
necessary to mask these signals. Such a mechanism has been recently shown for the 
assembly of high voltage activated calcium channels: a retention sequence present in 
the pore forming a l  subunits is shielded by the assembly with the p subunit, which 
allows the channel complex to reach the membrane (Ma et al., 2002). Kv channel 
interacting proteins 1-3 (KChIP 1-3) affect the trafficking of Kv4.2 channels (Shibata 
et al., 2003). The KChIP 1-3 proteins supports the transport to the plasma membrane 
by masking an amino-terminal hydrophobic domain of Kv4.2 that might otherwise 
lead to aggregation and degradation of the protein (Shibata et al., 2003).
Taking into consideration that the SK2-860 subunit can interact with the other SK 
subunits (Strassmaier et al., 2005), it might be possible that the interaction with SKI, 
SK2 or SK3 might change the subcellular localisation and possibly promote the 
membrane targeting of SK2-860 subunit. In heterologous expression systems, it has 
been shown that the co-expression of rSKl and rSK2 results in larger currents than 
the ones generated by homomeric SK2 channels (Benton et al., 2003); whereas the 
coexpression of hSKl or rSKl with SK3, diminishes the functional expression of 
SK3 (Monaghan et al., 2004). These observations suggest that heteromeric assembly 
can affect the functional expression and the targeting of SK subunits in different 
ways; therefore it is conceivable to hypothesise that the interaction of the SK2-860 
subunit with other SK a  subunits might change its subcellular localisation and 
possibly promote its membrane targeting. As observed in the SCG neurones, when 
SK2 and SK2-860 subunits are co-expressed their distribution pattern largely 
overlaps, indicating that the two subunits interact (Fig. 5.9), as reported by 
Strassmaier and colleagues (Strassmaier et al., 2005). However, no dramatic change
in the levels of the membrane expression of SK2-860 subunit is observed, suggesting 
that the interaction with the short SK2 subunit is not sufficient to promote the 
membrane targeting of the SK2-860 subunit and that another factor is necessary. 
Moreover, the distribution pattern of SK2-860 did not change upon co-expression of 
rSKl and SK2-860 (data not shown).
Another mechanism that might influence the membrane targeting of the SK2-860 
subunit is the activation of secondary pathways that results in post-translational 
modifications of the subunit. Some recent evidence has indicated the importance of 
protein kinases in the regulation of potassium channel targeting (Misonou et al., 
2004). Kv2.1 channels are expressed in clusters, in the somata and dendrites of 
hippocampal pyramidal neurones (Misonou et al., 2004). The channels are inserted 
into the membrane after glutamate stimulation which increases the intracellular Ca2+ 
concentration. The relocation of the protein from the clusters to the membrane relies 
on the activation of the phosphatase calcineurin which dephosphorylates the channel 
and induces its translocation to the membrane surface (Misonou et al., 2004). A 
similar mechanism could be envisaged for membrane targeting of the SK2-860 
subunit. A recent report showed that direct PKA phosphorylation of SK2 decreases 
membrane expression of SK2 subunits heterologously expressed in COS7 cells, 
indicating that phosphorylation can modulate SK channel targeting (Ren et al.,
2006). Interestingly, inspection of the extended amino-terminus of the SK2-860 
subunit indicates the presence of several consensus sequences for protein kinase A, 
protein kinase C and casein kinases. Further studies might investigate the 
involvement of these sites in the regulation of the membrane expression of the SK2- 
860 subunit.
8.4 Immunohistochemical distribution of SK3 a  subunits in the rat brain 
Anti-CSK3 antibody characterisation. The SK3 channel distribution in the rat brain 
was analysed using an anti-CSK3 antibody. The specificity of this antibody was 
demonstrated in Western analysis on rat brain synaptosmal membranes, where the 
antibody recognised a single band of -75 kDa, in good agreement with the predicted 
molecular weight for the SK3 protein of 81.5 kDa. This observation is comparable to 
the results obtained in Western blots of mouse (Sailer et al., 2004; Bond et al., 2004) 
and rat (Sailer et al., 2002) brain membranes, with different anti-NSK3 antibodies.
Furthermore, the specificity of the anti-CSK3 antibody is supported by the good 
correlation between the immunohistochemical data and the distribution of SK3 
transcripts described by in situ hybridisation studies (Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000; 
Tacconi et al., 2001; Sarpel et al., 2004; Bosch et al., 2002). For most of the brain 
regions, the expression profile obtained with the anti-CSK3 antibody is also in 
agreement with other immnunohistochemical studies recently reported (Tacconi et 
al., 2001; Sailer et al., 2002; Sailer et al., 2004).
SK3 distribution in the rat brain. Interestingly, at the subcellular level, the SK3 
subunit exhibits a differential localisation in different neuronal types, suggesting that 
the channel might have distinct functions depending on the compartment where it is 
targeted.
As discussed previously (8.2), the hippocampus showed limited expression of the 
SK3 a  subunit (Fig. 6.3). However a moderate neuropil immunoreactivity was 
observed in the stratum lacunosum moleculare and in the molecular layer of the 
dentate gyrus. These regions represent the areas where the axons of the perforant 
path pathway terminate. In particular, in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus the 
axons of the entorhinal cortex form connections with the dendrites of the dentate 
gyrus granular cells; whereas in the stratum lacinosum moleculare the entorhinal 
terminals make excitatory synapses with the dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal 
neurones. Although SK3 transcripts are present in the entorhinal cortex (Stocker and 
Pedarzani, 2000; Tacconi et al., 2001), the immunohistochemical data indicate 
limited SK3 immunoreactivity in this area (Table 6.1). However, the presence of the 
immunostaining in the stratum lacunosum moleculare and in the molecular layer of 
the dentate gyrus suggests localisation of SK3 channels in the axon terminals of the 
entorhinal cortex neurones.
Within the thalamus, the SK3 channel is widely expressed. High SK3 expression is 
detected in most of the principal relay thalamic nuclei associated with sensory 
functions. These comprehend the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (DLG) involved in 
the transmission of visual information from the retina to the cerebral cortex; the 
medial geniculate complex (MGD and MGV) which represents the main thalamic 
relay to the primary auditory cortex; and the posterior nuclei (Po) which is 
predominantly involved in somatosensory signals transmission. Moreover, intense 
expression is observed in the anterior and lateral nuclei, where also the SK2 a
subunit is highly expressed. However, at the subcellular level, the two subunits 
exhibit a different localisation. In fact, SK2 expression is restricted to the somata and 
the proximal portions of the dendrites, whereas SK3 is associated to the neuropil and, 
in some cases, to fiber-like structures. This observation suggests that the two 
channels might not form heteromers and might contribute instead to different aspects 
of neuronal function. Despite the high expression of SK3 and, to less extent, SK2 in 
most thalamic nuclei, no correlation with physiological studies on the role of the 
AHP is available. Future studies might assess the contribution of the SK channels on 
thalamic function.
Differently from the thalamic regions, in the habenula, the subcellular localisation of 
the two SK subunits partially overlaps. For example, in the medial habenular 
neurones, both SK2 and SK3 subunits are expressed in the somata (Fig. 4.6 B and 6.7 
B), whereas only the SK3 protein is present in the neurites of these neurones (Fig.
6.7 B). This suggests the possibility that the two subunits might form heteromers 
only in special cellular compartments. Furthermore, in the lateral habenula, SK2 is 
expressed and exhibits somatic localisation (Fig. 4.6 A), whereas SK3 
immunoreactivity is not detected (Fig. 6.7 A). To date, no physiological correlate on 
the role of the SK channels in the habenular neurons is known; therefore further 
studies are needed to understand the role of the SK channels in this brain area.
An interesting segregation of the expression of SK2 and SK3 subunits is observed in 
the amygdala, where SK2 expression is high to moderate in the lateral (LA) and 
basolateral (BLA) amygdaloid nuclei (Fig. 4.4). On the contrary, the SK3 signal is 
restricted to the central amygdaloid nucleus (Fig. 6.8). While SK2 might be the 
channel responsible for the apamin sensitive AHP in the lateral amygdala pyramidal 
neurones (8.2), the I A h p  present in the central amygdala neurones might be generated 
by the SK3 a  subunit (Schiess et al., 1999). However, the molecular determinant of 
this current have so far not been analysed using the available pharmacological tools 
that would allow an unequivocal correlation between the current and the expressed 
subunit.
In the neurosecretory neurones of the supraoptic nucleus (SO), SK3 channels are 
expressed in the somatodendritic compartment. In these neurones, an apamin- 
sensitive I a h p  regulates the phasic firing and ultimately influences the secretion of the 
hormones oxytocin and vasopressin (Kirkpatrick and Bourque, 1996). SK3 channels
localised in the somata and proximal dendrites are most likely the main molecular 
determinants of the I a h p ,  as supported by pharmacological data (Bourque and Brown, 
1987) and by the selective detection of SK3 transcripts and protein (Stocker and 
Pedarzani, 2000; Tacconi et al., 2000; Sailer at al., 2004). Moreover, within the 
supraoptic nucleus, the SK3 immunoreactivity is very strong at the base of the 
supraoptic nucleus, in the ventral glial/dendritic lamina, which is a region that 
contains a high density of glia cells and dendrites of the SO neurones. However, the 
fact that the signal is associated with thick filamentous structures and that the SK3 
signal colocalises with GFAP immunostaining (Fig. 6.10), indicates that SO glial 
cells express the SK3 protein. A comparable distribution was recently shown with a 
different SK3 antibody (Alomone) in SO (Amstrong et al., 2005). This finding does 
not represent the first observation of the expression of SK channels in glial cells. In 
fact, Fujita and colleagues recently reported that SK3 is present in the glia cells that 
enfold the bundles of olfactory nerve axons in the olfactory bulb (Fujita et al., 2003). 
Moreover, electrophysiological studies have indicated the presence of apamin- 
sensitive potassium currents, along with other potassium conductances, in cultured 
cortical (Jalonen et al., 1997), striatal (Bychkov et al., 2001); and hippocampal glial 
cells (Bumard et al., 1990). It has been proposed that a possible role of calcium 
activated potassium channels, and of others potassium channels, in glia consists in 
the potassium buffering action during periods of intense neuronal activity 
(Sontheimer, 1994). In particular, in the SO neurones, the mechanisms of potassium 
clearance are particularly effective during intense activity (Coles and Poulain, 1991). 
It is therefore interesting to hypothesise a role for SK3 channels in such a 
mechanisms.
In the DVN and in the hypoglossal nuclei a particularly interesting distribution of 
SK3 was observed. Both the DVN and the hypoglossal neurones revealed a somatic 
immunotaining (Fig. 6.11 A, C). Somatic expression of the channel might correlate 
with the apamin sensitive I a h p  that has been shown to control the firing behaviour in 
both cell types (Pedarzani et al., 2000; Viana et al., 1993; Powers et al, 1999; Bayliss 
et al., 1995). Moreover, we observed SK3 immunolocalisation in fibers resembling 
axonal profiles. In the DVN, the location of the fibers is consistent with the sites 
where the axons of the DVN converge to form the vagus nerve (Fig. 6.11 A, B). In
the hypoglossal nucleus, some of the labelled fibers might represent the axons 
ventrally exiting the nucleus to form the hypoglossal nerve. (Fig. 6.11 D).
An interesting aspect of the study of SK3 subunit localisation emerges from the 
analysis of brain stem monoaminergic systems such as the substantia nigra, locus 
coeruleus and dorsal raphe. Monoaminergic neurones of these regions express high 
to moderate levels of SK3 channels. Given the complexity of the monoaminergic 
neurones efferent projections that innervate the whole forebrain, these brain regions 
influence in different ways the general functional state of the brain. Therefore, the 
understanding of the localisation and of the function of SK3 in these neurones is of 
particular interest. Intense SK3 signal was present in the substantia nigra pars 
compacta that contains an homogeneus population of dopaminergic neurones. SK3, 
which is expressed in the somatodendritic compartment of these neurones, has been 
shown to be the principal molecular determinant of the apamin-sensitive I a h p  
involved in setting the regular spiking activity (Wolfart et al, 2001). Interestingly, in 
the substantia nigra pars reticulata the SK3 antibody reveals somatodendritic 
immunostaining on scattered neurones. This expression profile might correspond to 
the scattered pattern of dopaminergic neurones present in this area and would suggest 
a selective expression of SK3 in the dopaminergic neurones of the substantia nigra. 
Such a correlation has been indicated by an in situ hybridisation study that showed a 
comparable distribution of SK3 and TH mRNA-containing neurones in subtantia 
nigra compacta and reticulata (Sarpal et al., 2004). However, this hypothesis needs to 
be supported by further experimental evidence. A possible approach would be the 
concomitant use of SK3 antibody and a specific dopaminergic marker, like a tyrosine 
hydroxylase (TH) specific antibody which detects the rate limiting enzyme in 
catecholamine synthesis. Intense SK3 immunostaining is also observed in the somata 
of the adrenergic neurones in locus coeruleus. Somatic channels might underlie the 
apamin-sensitive mAHP involved in regulating the interspike interval during fast 
firing rates in these neurones (Osmanovich et al., 1990; Osmanovich et al., 1992). 
Interestingly, the immunostaining in the locus coeruleus reveals also a high number 
of fibers labelled with SK3 immunoreactivity. These fibers, which likely indicate 
axonal expression of the SK3 channel, suggest that SK3 channels might influence 
neurotransmitter release. Moderate somatodendritic SK3 expression was observed in 
the serotoninergic neurones of the dorsal raphe. Also in these neurones, the
expression of SK3 correlates with an apamin-sensitive mAHP (Freedman and 
Aghajanian, 1987).
Developmental regulation o f  SK3 in monoaminergic neurones. Given the 
interesting and possibly selective expression of SK3 in the monoaminergic neurones 
we have analysed whether any developmental regulation of the expression of this 
channel occurs during the first stages of postnatal life. We found that in the 
substantia nigra-VTA system and in locus coeruleus, SK3 is already expressed at day 
one (PI) and three (P3) after birth. Northern analysis of mRNA from juvenile brains 
(PI) indicate such an early expression of SK3 mRNA (M. Stocker personal 
communication). Several lines of evidence indicate that the release of monoamines 
during perinatal periods has a crucial role on cellular differentiation and on neuronal 
networks development (Herlenius and Lagercrantz, 2004). It might be possible that 
SK3, expressed in the early postnatal phases, is involved in these processes by 
regulating the firing pattern of the developing dopaminergic and noradrenergic 
neurorones and, ultimately, affecting the release of monoamines. Future studies 
would be interesting to understand the particular functional role of SK3 channels 
during the development in these subset of neurones.
Furthermore, in several systems it has been shown that calcium transients have an 
important role during different stages of neuronal development (Spitzer et al.,1995; 
ODonovan, 1999). In Purkinjie neurones, developmental downregulation of the 
expression of SK2 channels has been shown after the first two weeks of post-natal 
life. The channel influences the firing properties of developing Pukinjie neurones
(Cingolani et al., 2002) and, as a consequence, it might contribute to the regulation of
Ca transients and oscillations. This suggests that SK channels might be functionally 
involved in the complex events that result in the maturation of the neuronal network. 
The analysis of the SK3 distribution in dorsal raphe revealed a weak SK3 
immunoassaying in postnatal brains (PI and P3). This might suggest that up- 
regulation of the SK3 signal in dorsal rape neurones might occur during 
development. However, electrophysiological studies will be needed to determine the 
functional significance of this difference in protein expression.
8.5 Determinants of apamin sensitivity in SK channels.
The results presented in Chapter seven provide new information concerning the 
differences in apamin sensitivity of the three SK channels. By using chimeras of SK 
subunits that have different sensitivity to the toxin, we could demonstrate that the 
extracellular loop that connects transmembrane segment S3 and S4 (L3) significantly 
contributes to apamin sensitivity of SK channels.
Previous studies on oocyte expression systems indicated that the molecular 
determinants of apamin binding reside in the outer pore region of SK channels (Ishii 
et al., 1997). Besides apamin, a number of other toxins have been shown to be potent 
inhibitors of SK channels, including scyllatoxin (Chicchi et al, 1988), P05 (Zerrouuk 
et al, 1993), tamapin (Pedarzani et al., 2002) and the highly SK2 selective Lei-Dab, 
which was obtained by replacing the residue M7 of scyllatoxin with the non-natural 
amino acid di-aminobutanoic acid (Dab) (Shakkottai et al., 2001). Similar to apamin, 
the sensitivity to scyllatoxin is mediated by amino acids in the outer pore region 
(Jager and Grissmer, 2004). Mutant cycle analysis suggests that in Lei-Dab, the Dab 
at position seven directly interacts with an amino acid in the outer vestibule of SK2 
(Shakkottai et al., 2001). Furthermore, several pore mutants that have been designed 
to characterize the pore region of SK channels have indicated that the general 
architecture of the outer vestibule of SK channels is similar to that of voltage-gated 
K+ channels (Ishi et al., 1997; Jager and Grissmer, 2004). A single amino acid 
mutation in the outer pore of the SK2 subunit rendered the channel sensitive to the 
Kv channels blockers CTX and KTX (Jager and Grissmer, 2004). Taken together, 
these observations suggest that apamin and other toxins bind directly to the pore 
region of SK subunits and inhibit the channels.
In our study, the involvement of regions outside the pore in apamin sensitivity 
emerged by the puzzling difference that was observed in apamin sensitivity between 
hSKl and tSKInso-cso (Doehdt et al., 2004), despite the identity of their pore. The 
hypothesis that regions beyond the pore influence the sensitivity to the toxin was 
confirmed by experimental evidence. In particular, substitution of L3 in tS K 1 n sk 2 -  
c s k 2 with the corresponding region of hSKl results in a channel that is inhibited by 
apamin. In contrast, substitution of LI between transmembrane segments SI and S2 
does not produce the same effect, indicating that molecular determinants that 
influence the sensitivity to the toxin are present only in L3. Interestingly, substitution
of L3 results in a similar apamin sensitivity between chimeric rSKlNSK2 -csK2 and 
hSKl. This indicates that L3 is largely responsible for the difference of apamin 
sensitivity between the two channels.
The influence on apamin sensitivity of regions other than the pore is not a peculiarity 
of tSK1nsk2-csk2* hi fact, similar results were observed between hSKl, which is the 
least apamin-sensitive SK channel, and rSK2, which is the most apamin-sensitive SK 
channel. We first observed that the simultaneous substitution of LI and L3 of hSKl 
with the corresponding regions of rSK2 resulted in a substantial increased sensitivity 
to apamin. Then, we showed that a singe amino acid located in L3 is responsible for 
this effect. The hSKl-T216S mutated subunit has an apamin sensitivity that is ~20 
fold higher compared to hSKl and only five fold lower than rSK2, indicating that the 
mutated residue contributes largely to apamin sensitivity of the channel. Taking into 
consideration the studies of Ishii and colleagues that reported the importance of two 
amino acids located in the pore region of rSK2 in apamin binding (D341 and N368) 
(Ishii et al., 1997), it is possible that those two residues, together with the identified 
amino acids in L3, are necessary to generate a high-affinity receptor for apamin. 
Several possibilities could be considered to explain how these two regions of the 
channel affect the sensitivity of SK subunits towards apamin. One possibility is that 
the contribution of L3 to apamin sensitivity is mediated by an indirect effect. It might 
be that the T216S mutation in hSKl or the L3 substitution in tSKInso-cso result in 
a conformational change of the pore that favours the binding of apamin. In this 
model, the amino acids located in L3 would not participate to the formation of the 
toxin receptor but would rather affect the conformation of the outer vestibule, 
thereby influencing the pharmacological properties of SK channel a  subunits. 
Electrophysiological experiments using TEA, a classic pore blocker, were performed 
to test whether T216 mutation introduces changes in the architectural organization of 
the pore (A. Nolting personal communication). The results indicated that TEA 
sensitivity of hSKl-T216S did not differ from that of hSKl, supporting the view that 
the mutation T216S did not alter the channel structure.
Alternatively, L3 might influence the binding of apamin by taking part in the 
formation of the toxin-binding receptor. In this model, crucial residues of L3 might 
directly interact with amino acids on the surface of the toxin, thereby stabilizing its 
binding to the channel pore. This model implies that there should be close proximity
between L3 and the pore region of SK subunits. Studies on voltage-gated K+ 
channels have indicated that S4 is positioned close to the pore domain (Laine et al., 
2003; Lai et al., 2005). If a similar structural organisation occurs also in SK channel 
a  subunits, L3 might be close to the outer pore and be therefore part of the apamin 
receptor. However, to date, there is no evidence for this prediction.
Sequence alignment of the different SK L3 loops revealed that the serine that confers 
increased sensitivity to hSKl in the mutant hSKl-T216S is conserved in rSK2, rSK3 
and rSKl(in bold in Fig. 7.5) but not in hSKl, which has a threonine in the 
corresponding position (in red in Fig. 7.5). Although the lack of apamin sensitivity 
exhibited by rSKl cannot be explained on the basis of this single residue, it might be 
possible that other amino acids located in the same region account for the 
differences. Close inspection of the sequences indicated that four amino acids differ 
between hSKl and rSKl (Fig. 7.5). Among these four residues, the observation that 
the tyrosine (Y217 in hSKl) is conserved in all the apamin sensitive channels, hSKl, 
rSK2 and rSK3, is of particular interest. Further mutations might clarify this aspect.

In conclusion, the results reported in this chapter represent the first indication that a 
region outside the pore of SK channel subunits contributes to apamin sensitivity. In 
particular, we found that the L3 extracellular loop connecting transmembrane 
segments S3 and S4 largely accounts for the difference in apamin sensitivity between 
different SK channel subunits. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the 
mechanism by which L3 affects the sensitivity to the toxin.
