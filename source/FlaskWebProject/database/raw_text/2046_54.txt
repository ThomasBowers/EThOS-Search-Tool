ABSTRACT 
The ferlins are mammalian homologues of the C-elegans sperm vesicle fusion protein FER-1 
characterised by multiple C2 domains and a C-terminal anchor. To date three human ferlin 
proteins, dysferlin, myoferlin and otoferlin have been characterized. Dysferlin and myoferhn 
have a role in muscle membrane fusion. Dysferlin mutations cause muscular dystrophy and 
are associated with defective sarcolemmal repair. Myoferlin has a role in myogenesis. 
Through bioinformatic analysis our group identified a novel ferlin, FER1L5, which by 
homology modelling and sequence analysis showed highest similarity with dysferlin and 
myoferlin. Previously, FER1L5 gene expression was shown to be elevated during C2C12 
myoblast fusion. This led to the hypothesis that PERILS may have a role in muscle membrane 
fusion. In this study this was investigated in the C2C12 cell line using a specific polyclonal 
antibody to FER1L5. FER1L5 was shown to be present in vesicles. By biochemical 
fractionation FER1L5 was detected in low density vesicles the membranes of which were 
non-resistant to non-ionic detergent. The fractionation data showed that FER1L5, dysferlin 
md myoferlin vesicles have similar properties. By immunolabelling FER1L5 was shown to be 
present in distinct vesicles in myotubes compared to dysferlin and myoferlin respectively. 
During myoblast fusion FER1L5 expression was detected at all stages and high expression 
was observed at membrane fusion sites of fusing myoblasts. FER1L5 (but also dysferlin and 
myoferlin) showed a nuclear distribution during myoblast fiision. In myotube nuclei FER1L5 
was localized to subnuclear bodies sensitive to actinomycin D. Using the C3H-ER-MyoD cell 
line, I have shown that FER1L5 is not an early marker of muscle differentiation. The role of 
FER1L5 in muscle membrane fiision was investigated by examining the fusion index and 
membrane repair ability of C2C12 cells following PERILS inhibition. PERILS was shown to 
be required for myoblast fusion and membrane repair. 
In this study, I have also shown that C2C12 myotubes are active in membrane shedding. 
Using live cell imaging and confocal analysis, MVB like structures containing ferlin vesicles 
were shown to be released extracellularly from C2C12 myotubes. EM studies confirmed these 
findings. 
Overall my data shows that PERILS has a role in muscle membrane fusion. My work 
highlights that further studies on PERILS are required for example to determine i f PERILS a 
therapeutic target in dysferlinopathy and to identify the mechanisms involved in PERILS 
mediated membrane fusion.

CHAPTER I: GENERAL 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Introduction 
The cloning o f the dysferlin gene has led to the identification o f a novel mammalian 
protein family called the 'ferlins'. The dysferlin gene was identified by positional 
cloning and shown to be mutated in several types o f inherited muscular dystrophies: 
Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) , Miyoshi myopathy ( M M ) and 
anterior compartment myopathy (DAT) (DYSF, OMIM*603009, Bashir et ai, 1998; 
Liu et al, 1998). When dysferlin was cloned it displayed homology to the C.elegans 
protein FER-1, which is implicated in the fusion o f large membranous vesicles in 
developing sperm. FER-1 mutations lead to defecfive vesicle fiision in spermatocytes 
and insterility in worms (Achanzar and Ward, 1997). The proposed name given to the 
"dysferlin" gene reflected its significant homology to the FER-1 and the impact o f the 
mutations leading to dystrophic related phenotypes (Bashir et al., 1998 and Liu et al., 
1998). Following the identification o f dysferlin, mammalian homologues were 
identified sharing high structural and sequence homology and collectively they were 
called the 'ferl ins ' , which are described below (Bashir et al., 1998). 
1.2 Structural features of the ferlins 
There are six mammalian ferlins, which are evolutionary conserved (Figure 1.1). The 
ferlins are characterized by the presence o f multiple C2 domains and a C-terminal 
transmembrane anchor (Achanzar and Ward, 1997; Davis et al., 2002; Bansal and 
Campbell, 2004; Doherty and McNally, 2003). C2 domains are protein domains, 
which fold into an eight-stranded 6-sandwich comprising 120-140 amino acid residues 
that can adopt two different topologies known as type-I and type I I in which the N-and 
C-termini domains are located at opposite edges o f the B-sandwich resulting in a 
circular permutation o f the strands (Figure 1.2A). The type I domain contains three 
loops (L1-L3) and the type I I domain has four loops (L1-L4). The ligand-docking 
surface is the calcium binding region, which is formed by variable interstrand loops on 
one edge o f the beta sandwich (Figure 1.2B). The C2 domains were initially defined 
as the second-constant sequence in protein kinase C and hence the name C2. They are 
present in 1000s o f proteins and are generally implicated in proteins involved in ( i) 
signal transduction pathways for example, cytoplasmic phospholipases A2 and protein

Figure 1.1. Schematic showing the structural similarities and subgrouping of the 
human ferlin protein family. All proteins contain tandem C2 domains (pink) and C-
terminal transmembrane domain (blue). The subgrouping is based on the presence or 
absence of the nested DysFC (highlighted by dark grey colour) and DysFN 
(highlighted by violet colour). The dysferlin domain is present in dysferlin, myoferlin 
and FER1L5. Other predicted domains also found in the ferlins are Fer A (bluish 
green), Fer B (red) and Fer I (light green). FER1L4 has a zinc finger domain between 
C2B and C2C. The long isoform of FER1L5 and otoferlin are shown.

kinase C and (ii) vesicle trafficking/membrane fusion for example, synaptotagmins, 
rabphilin 3A, munc 13, DOC2 proteins and RIM (Cho and Stahelin, 2006; Rizo and 
Sudhof, 1998; Chacon et al., 2001; Davis et al, 2002). The topology in the C2 domain 
of protein kinase C is generally that of type I , the synaptotagmin C2 domains 
generally show a type II topology (Nalefski and Falke, 1996). The C2 domains of the 
ferlins exhibit type II topology (Davletov et al., 1993; Davis et al., 2002; Jimenez and 
Bashir, 2007). C2 domains are capable of binding Ca' ' , phospholipids, inositol 
polyphosphates, phosphotyrosines and they also participate in a Ca""  dependent and 
independent protein-protein interactions (Cho and Stahelin, 2006; Rizo and Sudhof, 
1998, Fernandez-Chacon et al., 2001; Davis et al., 2002). Some of the C2 domains 
have calcium binding regions (CBR) and the binding of calcium to the C2 domains 
primarily involves aspartyl side-chains that act as bidentate ligands for these ions 
(Davletov era/., 1993). 
The C2 domains most studied and best characterized are those present in 
synaptotagmins, membrane associated proteins, which are thought to function as Ca""  
sensors during synaptic membrane fusion (Chapman et al., 1998). The C2 domains in 
the ferlin proteins have been shown to be the most similar to those present in the 
synaptotagmins (Davis et al., 2002; Bansal and Campbell, 2004; Doherty and 
McNally, 2003; Therrien et al., 2009). Based on the homology with FER-1 and the 
similarities of the C2 domains with those of synaptotagmin the ferlin proteins are 
predicted to be involved in membrane ftision (Bansal and Campbell, 2004; Doherty 
and McNally, 2003). The six mammalian ferlins genes are dysferlin, otoferlin, 
myoferlin, FER1L4, FER1L5 and FER1L6 located on human chromosomes 2pl3, 
2p23, 10q24, 20ql l , 2 q l l and 8q24 respectively. Of these, dysferlin, myoferlin and 
otoferlin have been characterized. Dysferlin and otoferlin are implicated in genetic 
diseases namely muscular dystrophy (Bashir et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1998) and 
nonsyndromic deafness respectively (Yasunaga et al., 1999; Yasunaga et al., 2000). 
Sequence analysis of the three characterized ferlin genes has identified the molecular 
signature of the feriin protein family, which resides in the last two C-terminal C2 
domain sequences located before the transmembrane domain (Britton et al., 2000) 
(Figure 1.3). Using these C2 domain sequences our group and work of others have 
identified novel ferlin genes and shown that there are only six ferlins in the human and 
also other mammalian genomes. 
Dysferlin, myoferlin, otoferlin and FER1L5 (long isoform) proteins have six C2 
domains designated C2A to C2F and FER1L4 and FER1L6 have five C2 domains 
corresponding to C2B to C2F of the dysferlin, myoferlin and FER1L5 C2 domains. 
Otoferlin has two isoforms, the long isoform containing six C2 domains and the short 
isoform containing three C2 domains (Yasunaga et al, 2000). Evidence is also 
emerging of dysferlin, myoferlin and FER1L5 isoforms (Pramono et al., 2006; 
McNally et al., 2000; http://Mww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Comparison of all ferlin C2 
domains has shown that the last two C-terminal domains (C2E and C2F) share strong 
similarity across the entire ferlin family (Jimenez and Bashir, 2007). But the C2A is 
quite divergent between the ferlins indicating functional flexibility. In vitro studies 
have shown that of the six C2 domains in dysferlin and myoferlin, only the C2A 
domain is capable of binding phospholipids in a Ca""" dependent manner. The other C2 
domains are predicted to be involved in Ca""  dependent and independent interactions 
(Davis et ai, 2002; Doherty et al., 2005). The three domains, C2C, C2D and C2F 
contain putative calcium-binding regions and the cation-binding residues binding Ca""  
appear to be strongly conserved (Jimenez and Bashir, 2007). The central region of the 
ferlins (between C2C and C2D) shows differences amongst the ferlin proteins. In 
some of the ferlins there is an additional novel domain designated, DysF, which is 
located between the C2C and C2D domains and is present in dysferlin, myoferlin and 
FER1L5. The dysferlin domain is conserved during evolution and is also present in 
FER-1, Drosophila hypothetical sequence CG32226PA, yeast peroxisomal proteins 
and other hypothetical proteins (Ponting et al., 2001; Davis and Delmonte, 2000; 
Jimenez and Bashir, 2007). Many disease-causing dysferlin mutation have been 
mapped to this domain (Patel et al., 2008). The ferlins contain two copies of the DysF 
domain, one DysF nested within a second DysF domain. Hence the two DysF domains 
have been classified as DysFC (C-terminal region) and DysFN (N-terminal region). 
The fimction of the DysF domain is not known yet but the structure of the myoferlin 
DysF has been resolved recently and appears to be a unique fold, which is held 
together by stack of arginine and tryptophan residues (Patel et al., 2008). The ferlins 
also have ferlin-specific domains of unknown function referred as: Fer I , Fer A and B 
(Glover and Brown, 2007); Fer I is only present in dysferlin and located between C2A 
and C2B domains. Fer A and Fer B are located in the central regions and inserted 
between C2C and C2D domains. Fer A is present in dysferlin, myoferlin and FER-1. 
Fer B is located adjacent to Fer A and is present in all ferlins. (Figure 1.1). The

Figure 1.3. Molecular signatures of the ferlins. Multiple sequence alignment 
showing the two highest conserved C2 domains of dysferlin (DYSF), myoferlin 
(FER1L3) and otoferlin (OTOF) in comparison with the worm ferlin (FER-1). The 
sequences shown in rectangular boxes are conserved in all the ferlins. Shaded amino 
acids shown here are conserved in all the human ferlins. The shared amino acids 
between dysferlin and myoferlin are indicated in bold. Highly conserved calcium 
binding residues are highlighted by arrows. Taken from Britton et al, (2000). 
homology between the ferlins is highlighted in Table 1.1. 
Phylogenetic analysis of the ferlins C2 domains has shown that the ferlin protein 
family can be subgrouped into dysferlin-like and otoferlin-like. Dysferlin, myoferlin 
and FER1L5 form the dysferlin subgroup and otoferlin, FER1L4 and FER1L6 form 
the otoferlin subgroup. Within the dysferlin subgroup myoferlin is most similar to 
dysferlin and within the otoferlin subgroup FER1L6 shares highest homology to 
otoferlin (Figure 1.4). 
1.3 Evolutionary conservation of the ferlins 
The ferlin family is strongly conserved in evolution. Using a combination of database 
searches, BLAST analysis, Dr. Bashir's group has examined the presence of 
evolutionary homologues of the ferlins. The data generated is shown in Table 1.2. 
There are six ferlin genes in higher mammals (for example, chimpanzee, cattle, 
buffalo, dog, horse, cat, sheep, pig and rodents) with a similar structure as the human 
genes. The rodent genome contains six ferlins corresponding to the mammalian genes 
but mapping to different chromosomes. The mouse and the rat ferlin genes share 
significant sequence homology with the human ferlins and an identical protein 
structure with respect to the number and positions of the C2, DysF, transmembrane 
and the novel Fer I , A and B domains (Table 1.2). The Fer B domain is conserved in 
most of the ferlin genes identified so far but the Fer I and B domains are present only 
in some of the evolutionary ferlin homologues. In zebrafish, BLAST analysis has 
idenfified dysferlin, myoferlin, otoferlin and FER1L4 but there appears to be no 
evidence for the existence of FER1L5 and FER1L6. The Zebrafish genome has two 
ferlins one representing the dysferlin subgroup and other representing the otoferlin 
subgroup. In the Xenopus genome there is clear evidence for the existence of 
myoferlin and FER1L6 (otoferlin-like) by BLAST analysis. The existence of other 
ferlin genes is not yet known because the sequencing of the Xenopus genome is 
incomplete. The Drosophila genome has a single ferlin gene, which shares >40% 
sequence homology to dysferlin, myoferlin and otoferlin. In the Plasmodium 
falciparum genome there are two ferlins, one most homologous to dysferlin/myoferlin 
and the other sharing most similarity with otoferlin. The data suggests that gene 
duplication is responsible for the emergence of the ferlin proteins in higher mammals.

1.4 FER-1 and the mammalian ferlins 
1.4.1 FER-1 
The C.elegans FER-1 is a 230 kDa protein to which dysferlin shared homology when 
the gene was identified (Achanzar and Ward, 1997; Aoki et al, 2001). Sharing a 
similar structure to dysferlin, FER-1 is predicted to fiinction in vesicle fiision during 
maturation of spermatozoa. FER-1 is defective in mutant spermatocytes and FER-1 
mutants show a sterile phenotype (Achanzar and Ward, 1997). Currently ten 
mutations have been identified in the fer-I gene and all are missense mutations of 
which five {hcl36, hcl36, b232ts, hc82ts, hc24ts) map to the predicted C2 domains 
and two include map to the DysF domain suggesting that these domains are essential 
for FER-1 function (Washington and Ward, 2006). Ultrastructural studies have shown 
that the first C2A domain of FER-1 is required for the fusion of large vesicles termed 
membranous organelles (MOs) to the plasma membrane (PM), during sperm 
maturation. An antibody raised to FER-1 shows punctate staining at the plasma 
membrane of the spermatids and in MO (Washington and Ward, 2006). No FER-1 
staining pattern was observed in FER-1 mutant sperm. Defective ftision of the MO is 
hypothesized to lead to immotile sperm. This was tested in the spermatids carrying 
FER-1 mutations in the C2 domain and the abihty of these spermatids to trigger MO 
fusion was determined. 
MO fiision assays were developed using the dye FMl-43. When the dye partitions in 
the outer membrane leaflet of spermatids the PM of the spermatids fluoresces. Fusion 
of the MO with the fluorescent PM, leaves a fluorescent puncta around the cell body 
periphery and this was used to quantify the MO fusion. Using this assay MO fusion 
was demonstrated in wild type spermatids and MO fiision was shown to be dependent 
upon internal calcium because depletion of calcium in the wild type spermatids using 
calcium chelators blocked MO fusion (Washington and Ward, 2006). In the presence 
of calcium MO fusion was shown to be blocked in FER-1 mutants indicating that 
FER-1 is required for the active fusion of MO with the sperm PM, a process 
dependent upon the C2 domains and internal calcium. 
1.4.2 Dvsferlin 
1.4.2.1 Molecular genetics of dvsferlin 
Dysferlin was the first mammalian ferlin to be identified (Bashir et al., 1998; Liu et 
ai, 1998). The dysferlin gene is located on chromosome 2pl3 (Bashir et al., 1998), 
spanning at least 55 coding exons (Aoki et al., 2001; Liu et al., 1998) and a genomic 
region of >150kb (Aoki et al, 2001; Bashir et al, 1998; Pramono et al., 2006). The 
dysferlin cDNA contains 6,243 bp encoding a protein comprising 2,080 amino acids 
with a predicted molecular mass of 230kDa (Aoki et al., 2001). The dysferlin gene 
and its protein is expressed in a variety of tissues with the highest expression in 
skeletal and cardiac muscle (Bashir et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1998). Fifteen different 
isoforms of dysferlin are now recognized, which are thought to be produced by 
alternative splicing (http://www.genecards.org). Several monoclonal antibodies 
(designated NCL-hamlet, NCL-hamlet 2) have been raised to dysferlin and they detect 
a 230kDa protein, which shows ubiquitous expression with high levels in muscle and 
heart (Anderson et al, 1999). Dysferlin localizes at the muscle cell membrane 
(sarcolemma) (Figure 1.5) and is also present intracellularly and is thought to be in 
vesicles (Piccole et al, 2000; Bansal et al, 2003; Ampong et al, 2000). Dysferlin is 
not associated with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) based on the 
observations that normal expression of the various DGC components is observed in 
dysferlin-null mice and dysferlin deficient patient muscle (Figure 1.5). In dysferlin 
deficient mice the DGC complex is stable and fimctional (Ampong et al, 2000; 
Bansal et al, 2003). 
1.4.2.2 Dvsferlin and Muscular dystrophy 
Mutations in the dysferlin gene (DYSF) cause three clinically distinct autosomal 
recessive muscular dystrophies; LGMD2B (Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 
2B) (Bashir et al, 1998), M M (Miyoshi myopathy) (Liu et al, 1998) and DMAT 
(Distal anterior compartment myopathy) (Aoki, 2006) collectively called the 
dysferlinopathies (Ilia et al, 2001; Vilchez et al, 2005; Urtizberea et al, 2008). 
Control LGMD 2B M M 
Dysferlin 
-Sarcoglycan 
Figure 1.5. Immunofluorescence analysis of dysferlin and n-sarcoglycan in muscle 
biopsies of patients with LGMD2B and MM. In the MM/LGMD2B patients the 
staining for dysferlin is absent but the control muscle shows staining at the 
sarcolemma. MM/LGMD2B muscle shows a normal staining pattern for a-
sarcoglycan. Taken from Matsuda et al., (1999). 
Muscular dystrophies are a heterogeneous group of muscular disorders, characterized 
by progressive loss of muscle strength and integrity (Emery, 2002). LGMD2B patients 
show characteristically a predominant proximal muscle weakness and wasting in the 
late teens and often have normal mobility during childhood with a slow progression 
(Bashir et al, 1998; Linssen et al, 1997; Mahjneh et al, 2001). In contrast, M M is 
targeted distally to gastronemius muscles of the lower limbs in late teens and 
subsequently there is little early involvement of anterior muscle group with an early 
symptom of impaired toe-standing by affected patients (Liu et al, 1998). DMAT 
affects anterior tibial muscles (Ilia et al, 2001; Vilchez et al, 2005). Despite their 
distinct symptoms, there are some remarkable overlapping features of these disorders 
such as an autosomal recessive inheritance, age of onset with slow disease progression 
and early, severe elevations of serum creatine kinase levels (Matsuda et al, 1999; Ilia 
et al, 2001). 
To date, at least 200 mutations (Leiden Muscular Dystrophy database, 
http://www.dmd.nl/) have been identified in the dysferlin gene. Many different types 
of dysferlin mutations have been identified in dysferlinopathy eg. missense, deletion 
and fi-ameshift (Cagliani et al, 2005; Nguyen et al, 2005). Some of the mutations in 
the dysferlin gene are listed in Table 1.3. Overall the mutations are widely spread 
throughout the coding sequence of the gene without any mutational "hot spot" 
(Cagliani et al, 2005, Nguyen et al., 2005) and there are no evident genotype-
phenotype correlations (Cagliani et al, 2005). It has been reported that a wide inter 
and intra-familial variation in clinical phenotype can be associated with the same 
dysferlin mutation (Caglian et al, 2003). Regardless of the phenotype or the mutation 
dysferlinopathy patients typically have severely reduced levels or a complete loss of 
dysferlin in skeletal muscle when analyzed by immunohistochemistry (as shown in 
Figure 1.5) and by western blotting (Anderson et al, 1999, Vainzof et al, 2001 and 
Aoki et al, 2001; Matsuda et al, 1999; Piccolo et al. 2000). Dysferlin also shows 
cytoplasmic staining in the skeletal muscle fibers (Ampong et al, 2005). 
Ultrastructural studies of normal muscle show that dysferlin is localized at the 
sarcolemma but in patients with dysferlin deficiency there is a subsarcolemmal 
accumulation of vesicles (Selcen et al, 2001; Cenacchi et al, 2005).

Dysferlin deficient muscle is also characterized by inflammation correlating with the 
upregulation o f major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens at the 
peripheral regions o f the fibres (Gallardo et al, 2001; Confalonieri et a., 2003; 
Kostek et al., 2002), plasmalemmal defects, thickened basal lamina, replacement o f 
the plasma membrane by one to multiple layers o f small vesicles, papillary 
projections, small subsarcolemmal vacuoles, some undergoing exocytosis and 
infi-equent subsarcolemmal regions containing rough endoplasmic reticulum and 
abundant fi-ee ribosomes (Cenacchi et al., 2005). 
1.4.2.3 Mouse models of dvsferlinopathv 
There are several mouse models o f dysferlin deficiency. The SJL/J (SJL-Dysf) was the 
first mouse model o f dysferlin to be identified and is a naturally occurring mouse 
model that was used extensively prior to the identification o f dysferlin to examine 
inflammatory diseases (Festing, 1979). SJL/J mice are susceptible to many induced 
autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) and 
inflammatory muscle diseases. SJL mice develop progressive muscle weakness, an 
increased regeneration capacity and the spontaneous occurrence o f inflammatory 
myopathy, which is accompanied by loss o f muscle strength (Bittner et al., 1999). 
Histopathological studies in this mouse at different ages identified the features 
compatible with a progressive muscular dystrophy including degeneration and 
regeneration. The muscle fibres at 3 weeks o f age showed signs o f progressive muscle 
weakness and necrotic fibrosis (Bittner et al., 1999). The myopathic phenotype was 
shown to be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and mapped to mouse 
chromosome 6 to a region syntenic wi th human 2pl3 , where the dysferiin gene 
mapped. The identification o f mutations in the dysferlin gene highlighted that 
dysferlin was the causative gene responsible for the myopathy in SJL/J. Mutational 
screening revealed a 171bp deletion (spanning aa 1628-1685) in the dysferlin gene, 
which had resulted from a homozygous mutation in the 3' splice junction o f exon 45 
resulting in removing 57 amino acids including part o f the conserved C2E domain 
(Bittner et al., 1999). Protein analysis showed loss o f dysferlin from SJL/J {SJL-Dysf) 
muscle (Bittner era/., 1999; Vafiadaki et al., 2001). 
In addition to SJL/J there are three additional mouse models o f dysferlin deficiency, 
A/J, Dysf""^'^"' and Dysf-/- (Brown) (Bansal et al, 2003; Ho M , et al, 2004). A/J is a 
naturally occurring mouse model o f dysferlin deficiency where the mutation is an 
insertion o f a 5-6kb retrotransposon in intron 4 o f the dysferlin gene that is present as 
homozygous (Ho, et al., 2004). The Dysf""^''^'" mouse has been generated to contain 
a deletion spanning exons 53-55 (aa 1983-2080) o f the dysferlin gene. This deletion 
would remove the transmembrane domain o f the protein and is present as homozygous 
(Bansal et al, 2003). The Dysf-/- (Brown) mouse is a knockout mouse generated to 
contain a deletion o f exon 45 (aa 1628-1685) o f the dysferlin gene. This deletion 
removes part o f the fifth C2 domain (C2E) o f the protein and is present as 
homozygous (Ho et al., 2004). Another mouse C57BL/10.SJL-D>'5/ carries the same 
mutation as SJL/J mice except that this mutation has been transferred to the C57BL/10 
background by repeated backcrossing (von der Hagen et al., 2005). Disease 
progression in SJL/J, Dysf-/- (Campbell), Dysf-/- (Brown), and C57BL/10.SJL mice is 
similar; proximal muscles are more severely affected than distal muscles but A/J mice 
show a slower disease progression and abdominal muscles are also affected as in 
Dysf-/- (Brown) mice (Ho et al., 2004). Ultrastructural analysis o f dysferlin-deficient 
muscle from Dysf -/-, A/J and SJL mice shows marked thickening and focal 
duplication o f the basal lamina, isolated areas o f membrane discontinuity, 
accumulation o f vesicles near the sarcolemma but the contractile apparatus, thin and 
thick filaments and the neuromuscular junction appear normal (Ho et al, 2004). 
Behavioral differences were also noticed in all three dysferlin-deficient mice. Severe 
bite wounds were consistently noticed on SJL female mice that were mated with a SJL 
male. The extreme aggressive behavior o f the SJL mouse was not noticed in Dysf- / -
nor A/J mice (Ho et al., 2004). These studies suggested that there could be additional 
genetic defects in the SJL strain or that there is a unique combination o f alleles in the 
SJL backgroimd to account for the aggressive behaviour (Ho et al., 2004). Western 
analysis from all the mouse models showed no dysferlin expression or severely 
reduced dysferlin expression at the sarcolemma but control mice showed strong 
immunoreactivity for dysferlin (Vafiadaki et al., 2001; Bansal et al., 2003; Ho et al., 
2004). Immunolocalization o f dysferlin in control Balb/c mice showed sarcolemmal 
staining for dysferlin but also cytoplasmic staining in muscle fibers (Figure 1.6) 
(Ampong et al., 2005). By biochemical fractionation dysferlin was shown to be 
enriched in sarcolemmal but also in the T-tubule, SR muscle membranes and in 
intracellular vesicles from the muscle o f control mice. In SJL/J mouse, dysferlin was 
absent in the different membrane fractions (Ampong et al, 2005). 
1.4.2.4 Dvsferlin and muscle membrane repair 
Membrane tears are a common physiological event in muscle and heart. Muscle has an 
active membrane repair mechanism. To withstand the rigors o f contraction, muscle 
fibers have a specialized protein machinery that protects the muscle membrane against 
mechanical stress. This mechanism is rapidly activated after injury. Cells w i l l die i f 
injured muscle is not repaired. Recent progress toward elucidating the mechanism 
involved in membrane repair has led to the 'Patch Hypothesis' explaining how cells 
reseal large tears on their surfaces. The 'Patch Hypothesis' states that Ca "  flooding 
through a membrane disruption site w i l l trigger the accumulation and fiision o f 
vesicles at the wound site leading to the formation o f a 'patch' membrane, which is 
added to the disruption site by Ca"*  dependent exocytosis (reviewed in McNeil et al., 
2003). The vesicles involved in membrane repair are being identified and are 
endomembrane derived. Examples o f the type o f vesicles shown to be involved in 
membrane repair include the yolk granules in sea urchin eggs, lysosomes in 
fibroblasts, NRK, CHO, L6E9 and 3T3 cells, enlargeosomes in PC 12 cells and 
endocytic axolemmal vesicles in neurons (McNeil et al., 2003; Terasaki et al., 1997; 
Augustine, 2001; Bai and Chapman, 2004; Yasunaga et al., 1999; Chakrabarti et al., 
2003). Lysosomes had been considered to be the principle source o f endomembrane 
for membrane repair in mammalian cells (Reddy et al., 2001) based on the evidence 
that wounded cells showed surface expression o f the lysosomal marker Lamp-1, in a 
calcium dependent manner fol lowing resealing (Reddy et al., 2001). Lysosomal 
exocytosis was shown to be Ca" dependent and regulated by the synaptotagmin, Syt-
V I I (Reddy et al., 2001). In addition Syt-VII-deficient mice were shown to develop an 
inflammatory myopathy with extensive fibrosis, high serum creatine kinase levels and 
progressive muscle weakness, which was associated with defective membrane repair 
(Chakrabarti et al., 2003). Enlargeosomes are exocytic vesicles represented by the 
giant protein A H N A K (also known as desmoyokin), which have been implicated in 
cell membrane enlargement, differentiation, repair and signal transduction (Hohaus et 
al., 2002; Gentil et al., 2003; Borgonovo et al., 2002; Cocucci et al., 2004). These are

Immunofluorescent images of transverse and longitudinal sections respectively of the 
tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of mice Balb/c and SJL stained with monoclonal 
antibody against dysferlin showed staining for dysferlin at the sarcolemma and in the 
cytoplasm in control muscle sections. No staining or severely reduced staining is

al. (2005). 
novel vesicles, which have been shown to be resistant to nonionic detergents and 
mediating in endocytosis and recycling via a nonacidic route distinct from classical 
endosomal vesicles (Cocucci et al., 2004). The participation o f enlargeosomes in the 
enlargement o f cell membrane was shown by the increased surface expression of 
A K N A K fol lowing elevation of intracellular calcium during cell differentiation and 
plasma membrane repair (Borgonovo et al., 2002; Cocucci et al., 2004). 
In muscle cells dysferlin vesicles are thought to be the primary membrane repair 
vesicles. The role o f dysferlin in muscle membrane repair was investigated because 
ultrastructural studies on dysferlin deficient patient muscle biopsies demonstrated 
membrane tears, duplication o f the basal lamina and accumulation o f vesicles under 
the membrane (Cenacchi et al., 2005) similar to those observed in C. elegans fer-1 
mutants, which showed defective M O fusion (Washington and Ward, 2006). 
Additionally biochemical studies o f dysferlin indicated that the C2A domain is 
capable o f binding phospholipids similar to the C2A domain of synaptotagmin (Davis 
et al., 2002). Together these findings led to the examination o f membrane repair in the 
Dysf*"'* ' ^"' knock out mouse o f dysferlin. Laser induced membrane wounding assays 
were performed on single muscle fibers from wild-type and dysferlin-deficient mice in 
the presence and absence of calcium and using the dye F M l - 4 3 . The laser wounding 
assay involves creating a membrane disruption using a 10-W Argon/Ti:sapphire laser 
multiphoton confocal microscope in the presence o f the dye FMl-43 and in the 
presence or absence o f calcium. F M l - 4 3 is a membrane-impermeant dye, which 
fluoresces when it binds to internal membranes (McNeil , 2003). The increase in F M l -
43 fluorescence near the wounded site is imaged and measured over a time course 
(approximately a few minutes) (McNeil , 2003). Resealing o f the membrane halts the 
increase in FMl-43 fluorescence intracellulary. In wounded wi ld type muscle fibres 
the entry o f FMl-43 dye was efficiently excluded in the presence o f calcium 
indicating that the cells had resealed their torn membranes after laser wounding 
(Bansal et al., 2003). The Ca'"^ dependency o f membrane repair was shown by 
wounding in the absence of calcium when the dye continuously entered the muscle 
cell indicating a failure to reseal. Wounding o f dysferlin deficient fibres in the 
presence o f Ca""  did not stop the increase in FMl-43 fluorescence demonstrating that 
dysferlin-null fibres are defective in membrane repair (Bansal et al., 2003). In parallel 
with laser wounding experiments strong staining o f dysferlin was observed at the 
wound sites in wi ld type muscle fibers (Bainsal et al., 2003). 
Further evidence o f a role o f dysferlin in membrane repair was shown from the studies 
by Lennon et al., (2003). W i l d type myotubes from SWR/J mice and myotubes from 
dysferlin-null SJL/J mice were injured after the cells were preloaded with a 
fluorescent Ca'"^ indicator, I n d o l - A M . In loaded cells changes in Ca""  were monitored 
fluorescently fol lowing membrane injury. This showed that there was a transient 
marked elevation o f Ca""  in response to membrane disruption in the myotubes from 
SWR/J cells and levels o f Ca""  returned to normal levels within a few seconds 
highlighting efficient reseating o f the disrupted membranes. In the absence of 
dysferlin the return to the normal Ca""  levels monitored by Indol -AM fluorescence 
and reflecting membrane repair in SJL/J myotubes was shown to be considerably 
reduced (Lennon et al., 2003). Co-staining o f the lysosomal marker Lamp-1 and a 
488-nm fluorophore bound to the dysferlin antibody was performed in myotubes from 
wi ld type and SJL/J to show that dysferlin is involved in lysosomal exocytosis 
(Lennon et al., 2003). Co-staining showed that the sarcolemmal expression o f Lamp-1 
was detected on 86% of dysferlin-positive myotubes in wi ld type (SWR/J) membrane 
in the presence o f calcium but this was not observed on intact cells. Chelation o f Ca""*  
with EGTA ( I m M ) in SWR/J myotubes resulted in a significant reduction (48%) in 
the amount o f surface Lamp-1 after post-injury. In the presence o f Ca"" , 60%) of 
cultured dysferlin deficient SJL/J myotubes showed surface Lamp-1 expression after 
post-injury (Lennon et al., 2003). However, other studies have not shown impaired 
lysosomal exocytosis in dysferlin deficient muscle cells and studies by McNeil et al., 
(2003) have shown that dysferlin is not present in lysosomal vesicles. 
Further studies have provided additional evidence that dysferlin has a role in 
membrane repair. In wounded C2C12 myotubes dysferlin has been shown to 
accumulate in vesicular structures at wound sites, where they colocalize with the T-
tubule marker protein, B i n l (Klinge et al., 2007). T-tubules are beaded tubular 
invaginations o f the plasma membrane, which form a specialized membrane system 
facilitating excitation contraction coupling reactions (Klinge et al., 2007; Carozzi et 
al., 2000). T-tubules have been recognized as an endomembrane source o f vesicles 
(Lee et al.. 2002). Furthermore, the T-tubule system was shown to be involved in 
membrane elongation and repair o f the sarcolemma (Engel and Franzini-Armstrong, 
2004). The colocalization o f dysferlin with B i n l and other T-tubule markers (Ampong 
et a., 2005) has led to suggestion that the source of the dysferlin vesicle involved in 
membrane repair may be the T-tubule system (Klinge et al., 2007). 
Recent work has shown that dysferlin's role in membrane repair is not only restricted 
to skeletal muscles but also extends to cardiac muscle (Han et al., 2007). A Japanese 
LGMD2B patient has been described suffering from ventricular enlargement and 
diffuse hypokinesia and carrying a 3370G-T missense mutation in the dysferlin gene 
(Kum et al., 2004). These findings prompted the examination o f membrane damage in 
heart muscle from dysferlin knock out mice (Dysf"^"""). Cardiac ftmction tests and 
myocyte membrane repair capacity o f dysferlin null mice hearts showed that dysferlin 
deficiency greatly reduces the membrane repair efficiency o f cardiac muscle 
membrane (Han et al., 2007). Aged dysferlin-null mice manifested hallmarks o f 
cardiomyopathy, for example, elevated serum cardiac troponin T levels, cardiac 
necrosis and cardiac fibrosis (Han et al., 2007). This suggests a model in which 
dysferlin might play a role in membrane repair by responding directly to a Ca""  signal 
triggering vesicle fusion thereby resealing the membrane of cardiomyocytes (Han et 
al., 2007). It was suggested that the dysferlin role in membrane repair o f 
cardiomyocytes protects the heart from stress-induced left ventricular injury (Han et 
al., 2007). 
1.4.2.4.1 Interacting proteins of dvsferlin 
The following proteins have been shown to interact with dysferlin in muscle or be part 
o f the dysferlin complex involved in membrane repair. 
Caveolin-3: Caveolin-3 is localized to the sarcolemma and is responsible for the 
formation and maintenance o f caveolae, which are specialized l ipid raft like, small 
(50-1 OOnm) invaginations o f the plasma membrane present in many vertebrate cell 
types, especially endothelial cells and adipocytes (Williams and Lisanti, 2004). 
Caveolin-3 was identified as the first interacting protein o f dysferlin in skeletal muscle 
by immunoprecipitation studies (Matsuda et al., 2001). Mutations in the caveolin-3 
(CAV3) gene cause many different muscular dystrophies leading to a deficiency o f 
caveolin-3 from patient muscle. These muscular dystrophies are called 
caveolinopathies (Bruno et al., 2007). In the caveolin-3 deficient patient muscle 
biopies dysferlin expression was shown to be altered but not absent (Matsuda et al., 
2001). Caveolin-3 has been shown to regulate the surface trafficking o f dysferlin 
using caveolin 3 null cells and by expressing caveolin-1 and 3 mutant proteins 
(Hernandez et al, 2006). The caveolins were shown to mediate the trafficking o f 
dysferlin from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane. In muscle cells expressing 
caveolin mutants the exit o f both mutant and wi ld type dysferlin from the Golgi 
complex was shown to be inhibited resulting in the retention o f dysferlin in the Golgi 
complex (Hernandez et al., 2006). The endocytosis o f dysferlin was also shown to be 
rapid in caveolin null cells (Hernandez et al., 2008). Recent studies have shown that 
caveolin-3 functions with MG53, a novel muscle membrane repair protein (see below) 
to regulate the surface trafficking o f dysferlin (Cai et al., 2009*'). 
Annexin A l and A2: Microarray studies o f dysferlin deficient muscle have reported 
the upregulation o f Annexin A l and A2 (Butte et al., 2000; Campanaro et al., 2002; 
Lennon et al., 2003). Consistent with this data the expression o f both annexin A l and 
A2 has been shown to be higher in dysferlin-deficient (SJL/J) mouse muscle (Lennon 
et al., 2003). These results led to investigations to examine the expression and 
function o f annexin A1/A2 in skeletal muscle cells. Annexins are calcium and 
phospholipid binding proteins, which are widely expressed (Gerke and Moss, 2002). 
Annexins comprise a large protein family and are implicated in a variety o f fiinctions 
such as membrane organizafion, membrane aggregation and fiision, membrane 
frafficking, exocytosis, endocytosis, ion fluxes, signal transduction, inhibition o f 
phospholipase A2 and cell-matrix interactions (reviewed in Gerke and Moss, 2002; 
Moss and Morgan, 2004). Annexin A l and A2 have been shown to aggregate 
intracellular vesicles and l ip id rafts in a Ca""*" dependent manner at the cytosolic 
surface o f plasma membranes in many cell types (Babiychuk and Draeger, 2000; 
Lambert et al., 1997). Annexin A l binds to S lOOAl l protein by forming a 
heterotetramer to mediate the aggregation o f vesicles (Gerke and Moss, 2002). 
Annexin A2 has been postulated to have a similar relationship with SIOOAIO (Gerke 
and Moss, 2002). By immunolocalization and immunoprecipitation studies annexin 
A l and A2 have shown to associate with dysferlin in a Ca"^ dependent fashion in 
intact skeletal muscle cells and the association has been shown to be mediated through 
the unique N-terminal domains o f annexins A l and A2 (Lennon et al., 2003). The 
interaction between annexins and dysferlin was confirmed using Fluorescence 
Lifetime Imaging Microscopy ( F L I M ) , which measures the decay half life o f 
fluorescent molecules immunologically attached to individual proteins and allows 
sensitive measurement o f protein-protein interactions on a spatial scale o f <10nm 
(Bacskai et al., 2003). The role o f annexin A l in membrane repair has been 
demonstrated. Annexin A l fiinction was inhibited in HeLa and BS-C-1 cells by 
loading cells wi th annexin A l antibody, by peptide competition experiments and 
expression o f dominant negafive annexin A l mutants. Laser and glass bead wounding 
assays were used to show that disruption o f annexin A l expression impedes 
membrane repair (McNeil et al., 2006). A model describing the role o f dysferlin and 
its interacting partners proposed by Glover and Brown, (2007) is shown in Figure 
1.7A. 
A H N A K l : A H N A K l (also called desmoyokin) is a nucleoprotein composed o f three 
structural domains, the central domain composed o f multiple IgG repeating units. 
Unique-sequence domains at the two ends o f the protein flank a large internal domain 
(approximately 4300 amino acids), which is composed o f highly conserved repeated 
elements and most o f which are 128 amino acids in length (Shtivelman et al., 1993). 
A H N A K is a novel family o f two proteins ( A H N A K and A H N A K 2 ) , which are 
characterized by common amino acid sequences and o f exceptionally huge size (-600-
700 kDa) (Komuro et al., 2004). A H N A K l binds with G-actin and cosediments with 
F-actin and has been implicated in the organization o f the subsarcolemmal cell 
architecture (Cocucci et al., 2004). Regulation o f cellular A H N A K content in 
correlation wi th cell membrane remodeling and specialization has already been 
demonstrated in epithelial and endothelial cells (Benaud et al., 2004). In these cells, 
A H N A K stabilization was shown to be dependent on its recruitment to the plasma 
membrane through interaction with its partner proteins, including the 
annexin2/S100A10 complex (Benaud et al., 2004). In normal human skeletal muscle 
fiber A H N A K is known to be localized at the plasma membrane by 
immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence experiments (Gentil et al., 2003). 
Figure 1.7A. The model of dysferlin-mediated membrane repair in skeletal muscle. 
a) In normal muscle dysferlin is localized at the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic 
vesicles, where it interacts with AnxAl and AnxA2, AHNAK, affixin and caveolin-S. b) 
Upon membrane injwy the intracellular Ca'* concentration is increased creating a 
zone of high calcium around the disruption site, triggering the membrane patch 
response. The high intracellular calcium levels activate proteases such as calpain 3 
leading to the remodeling of the cortical cytoskeleton, which removes this physical 
barrier to fusion events, c) Dysferlin repair vesicles traffic to the wound site, where 
they accumulate and fuse with one another and with the plasma membrane in the 
presence of elevated calcium at the wound site. This requires interaction with annexin 
A2, other dysferlin molecules and other unknown proteins. Affixin is predicted to 
mediate vesicle trafficking through reorganization of the cortical cytoskeleton at the 
injwy site, d) Fusion of the dysferlin repair vesicles with plasma membrane foi-ms a

A H N A K has been shown to fomi a complex with dysferlin in skeletal muscle by 
coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Huang et al., 2007). It is not clearly mentioned 
which isoform of the A H N A K interacts with dysferlin but we believe that A H N A K 
refers to the isoform A H N A K l . In human skeletal muscle, A H N A K localized at the 
sarcolemmal membrane was shown to colocalize with dysferlin and the 
dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) subunit o f the L-type Ca""  channel by 
immunofluorescent analysis (Huang et al., 2007). In dysferlinopathy, reduction or 
absence of dysferlin was shown to result in a secondary muscle-specific reduction in 
A H N A K (Huang et al., 2007). Glutathione S-fransferase (GST) pull-down assays o f 
different recombinant GST A H N A K and dysferlin fiasion proteins has demonstrated 
that the binding site o f dysferlin and A H N A K is between the C-terminus o f A H N A K 
and the N-terminal C2A domain of fiill length dysferlin (Huang et al., 2007). A H N A K 
and dysferlin were shown to be in a complex (Huang et al., 2007). In regenerating 
muscle the levels o f A H N A K and dysferlin were elevated and there was a 
redistribution o f both proteins from the sarcolemma to the cytoplasm (Huang et al., 
2007). The role o f A H N A K in membrane repair is unclear because the absence o f 
A H N A K containing exocytotic vesicles does not impair membrane repair whereas 
A H N A K positive enlargeosomes have been shown to imdergo Ca""  regulated 
exocytosis fol lowing plasma membrane disruption (Cocucci et al., 2004). 
Affixin: A f f i x i n (beta-parvin) is a novel, integrin-linked kinase-binding protein that is 
involved in the linkage between integrin (a cell adhesion molecule that mediates cell-
exfracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions) and the cytoskeleton (Yamaji et al., 
2001). It is highly eiuiched in skeletal and cardiac muscle (Yamaji et al., 2004). 
A f f i x i n was shown to colocalize wi th dysferlin at the sarcolemma of normal human 
skeletal muscle and co-immunoprecipitates with dysferlin (Matsuda et al., 2005). The 
immunoreactivity o f a f f ix in was sho-uTi to be reduced at the sarcolemma o f M M and 
LGMD2B patient muscles, although the total amount o f the aff ixin protein levels were 
unchanged (Matsuda et al., 2005). A f f i x i n was shown to interact with dysferlin in 
mouse and himian skeletal muscles by coimmunoprecipitation. Using 
immunoprecipitation with deletion mutants o f dysferlin the C-terminal intracellular 
region of dysferlin was identified as the apparent af f ix in binding domain and the CHI 
domain o f af f ix in was identified as the dysferlin-interacting region (Matsuda et al., 
2005). The role o f aff ixin in membrane repair has not been elucidated and no other 
studies have identified aff ixin in a dysferlin complex. 
MG53: MG53 (mitsugumin 53) is a newly discovered protein belonging to the 
tripartite mot i f /RING B box Coil Coil (TRIM/RBCC) family o f proteins that is 
expressed specifically in skeletal and cardiac muscle (Sardiello et al., 2008; Cai et al., 
2009^). Mice lacking MG53 develop a dystrophic phenotype, which is linked with 
defective membrane repair (Cai et al., 2009^). MG53 is localized to intracellular 
vesicles and the sarcolemma through binding with the l ipid phosphatidylserine (Cai et 
al., 2009*). MG53 vesicles were shown to traffic to the cell surface and fuse with the 
cell membrane and overexpression o f MG53 enhances vesicle fusion and formation o f 
filopodia like structures (Cai et al., 2009^). The exocytosis o f MG53 vesicle was 
shown to be dependent upon caveolin-3 (Cai et al., 2009^). Further studies by Cai et 
al., (2009*"^) demonstrated the role o f MG53 in membrane repair. MG53 vesicles 
were shown to translocate to muscle membrane injury sites and analysis o f MG53 
deficient muscle by electron microscopic analysis confirmed that MG53 is involved in 
vesicle trafficking during membrane repair because vesicle translocation was shown to 
be lacking at muscle injury sites in MG53 deficient muscle. Further studies on MG53 
revealed that the function of MG53 during membrane repair is dependent upon the 
redox state o f the cell. In the presence o f an oxidative environment such as that found 
extracellularly MG53 undergoes oligomerization. A model was proposed whereby 
oxidation-dependent oligomerization o f MG53 acted as a signal to facilitate the 
recruitment o f MG53 vesicles to membrane injury sites because MG53 was shown to 
act independent o f Ca""  unlike other known membrane repair proteins including 
dysferlin and annexins (Cai et al., 2009*; McNei l and Kirchhausen, 2005; Bansal et 
al., 2003; Lennon et al., 2003). The relationship of MG53 and dysferlin is emerging 
and a recent paper on MG53 has demonstrated that MG53 regulates the surface 
frafficking o f dysferiin through its interaction with caveolin-3 (Cai et al., 2009^ ). 
Mg53'^' mice show retention of dysferlin containing vesicles in the post Golgi 
compartment indicating that the translocation o f dysferlin vesicles to the injury site 
requires MG53 and also caveolin-3. hi this first study of MG53, Cai et al, (2009^) 
demonsfrated that MG53 and caveolin-3 colocalize in muscle cells and that MG53 
regulates membrane budding and exocytosis. A physical interaction between caveolin-
3 and MG53 was demonstrated and shown to mediate the trafficking o f dysferlin 
vesicles to the injury site during membrane repair (Cai et al., 2009^^). Expression of 
caveolin-3 mutants was shown to cause retention of wi ld type caveolin-3 in the Golgi 
complex and this also resulted in an aberrant localization o f MG53 and dysferlin, 
which was associated with defective membrane repair (Cai et al., 2009^^). Therefore 
MG53, dysferlin and caveolin-3 appear to form a functional complex in muscle that is 
involved in the recruitment o f vesicles to the membrane wound site. The recent model 
o f membrane repair includes the involvement o f MG53 and its interaction with 
dysferlin and caveolin is shown in Figure 1.7B (Mc Nei l , 2009). 
1.4.2.5 Dvsferiin and muscle inflammation 
In dysferlinopathy inflammation has been shown to be a key feature with patients 
often misdiagnosed with polymyositis (Nguyen et al., 2007). Endomysial and 
perivascular infiltrates have been shown to be common in necrotic dysferlin deficient 
fibres, consisting mostly o f CD4"^ and CD8"^ T-cells and macrophages (Selcen et al., 
2001; Nguyen et al., 2007; McNal ly et al., 2000; Gallardo et al., 2001). Non necrotic 
dysferlin-deficient fibers are free o f all types o f infiltrates (Gallardo et al., 2001). 
There is upregulation o f major histocompatibility complex ( M H C ) class I antigens in 
dysferlin deficient muscle (Gallardo et al., 2001; Selcen et al., 2001) and there is an 
increased number o f macrophages and T lymphocytes in patients indicating an active 
inflammatory response (Gallardo et al., 2001; Confalonieri et al., 2003; Cenacchi et 
al., 2005). In all o f the mouse models o f dysferlin deficiency high numbers o f necrotic 
and regenerating fibers were observed and there was infiltration o f mononuclear cells 
into intact fibers, phagocytosis and marked variation o f fiber size as observed in 
dysferlinopathy patients (Ho et al., 2004). Ultrastructural studies demonstrated that 
some macrophages and lymphocytes were tightly adhered to the sarcolemma (Kostek 
et al., 2002; Gallardo et al., 2001, Confalonieri et al., 2003) (Figure 1.8). It has been 
now recognized that dysferlin is normally expressed in CD 14"  monocytes and that 
CD 14"  monocytes from L G M D 2 B and M M patients are deficient for dysferlin 
(Gallardo et al., 2001). Detection o f dysferlin in monocytes has become a diagnostic 
test for the dysferlinopathies (Gallardo et al., 2001). Monocytes differentiate into 
macrophages and in these cells, membrane fusion events are critical for phagocytosis 
and cytokine release (Nagaraju et al., 2008). Recently, it has been demonsfrated that 
monocytes from patients with dysferlinopathy show increased 
- p '

bacterial phagocytosis compared to control cells (Nagaraju et al, 2008) (Figure 1.8). 
Monocytes and peritoneal macrophages from normal control C57BL/6 and dysferlin-
deficient SJL/J mice strains were tested for their ability to phagocytose fluorescently-
labeled E.coli and showed enhanced phagocytic activity (Nagaraju et al., 2008). The 
phagocytic activity of the monocytes was also demonstrated by siRNA mediated 
knock down of dysferlin using the J774 macrophage cell line, which also exhibited 
significantly higher bacterial phagocytosis (Nagaraju et al., 2008). hi SJL mice strong 
upregulation of endocytic proteins CIMPR, clathrin, adaptin-a and small Rho family 
GTPases RhoA, Racl and Cdc 42 was also observed in splenocytes and macrophages 
of dysferlin-deficient AJ mice (Nagaraju et al., 2008). Abnormal signaling and 
phagocytosis was predicted to be the cause of the inflammation in dysferlinopathy 
(Nagaraju et al., 2008). To identify which signaling pathways were active in dysferlin 
deficient muscle, microarray studies were performed, which highlighted that loss of 
dysferlin in muscle activates compensatory membrane trafficking pathway, the Slp2a 
and Rab27A pathway (Kesari et al., 2008). This pathway is normally inactive in 
muscle and normally operates in melanocytes and T-cells. Examination of 
dysferlinopathy patients has shown that in dysferlin deficient muscle T-cells are more 
activated (Kesari et al., 2008). These findings have led to suggestions that following 
muscle injury in dysferlin deficient patients there is an exaggerated immune response 
triggered by the loss of dysferlin in monocytes and activation of compensatory vesicle 
trafficking pathways in muscle and this exacerbates the dystrophic phenotype (Kesari 
et al., 2008). 
1.4.2.6 Dvsferliii and muscle regeneration 
Several studies analyzing dysferlin deficient patient muscle and mouse models of 
dysferlinopathy have highlighted the role of dysferlin in muscle regeneration. 
Dysferlin was shown to be highly expressed in satellite cells in dystrophic muscle 
biopsies and expression of dysferlin was shown to increase in activated satellite cells 
(Luna et al., 2004). In differentiating myoblasts, dysferlin mRNA and protein 
expression was elevated reaching maximal levels in mature myotubes. hihibiting 
myoblast fusion using drugs resulted in a decrease in dysferlin expression (Luna et al., 
2004). These preliminary studies hinted at the role of dysferlin in muscle regeneration. 
Further studies demonstrated that myoblast fusion was delayed in siRNA transfected 
C2C12 cultures showing dysferlin knock down (Luna et al, 2006). Dysferlin deficient 
patient muscle cultures also showed delayed myoblast fusion as demonstrated by 
measuring the fusion index of the cultures. A functional link between dysferlin and 
myogenin during muscle regeneration was highlighted. During muscle differentiation 
knockdown of dysferlin using siRNA was shown to correlate with reduced myogenin 
levels (Luna et al., 2006). Myotubes formed fi-om dysferlin deficient cultures also 
showed reduced expression of myogenin mRNA. In addition to its role in membrane 
repair dysferlin was proposed to function in a myogenic signaling pathway (Luna et 
al., 2006). In rats, muscle regeneration can be studied by cardiotoxin treatment, which 
induces muscle regeneration after muscle damage (Harris et al., 1974). In wild type 
mice, notexin treated muscle can be repaired within 3 or 4 days post injection by 
muscle regeneration (Harris et al., 1974). In normal rat muscle dysferlin was shown to 
localize at the sarcolemma where it colocalized with AHNAK (Huang et al., 2007). 
After notexin treatment both dysferlin and AHNAK were shown to redistribute in the 
cytoplasm of regenerating muscle fibres (Huang et al., 2007). In dystrophic muscle a 
cytoplasmic localization of dysferlin and increased protein expression has also been 
observed in regenerating muscle fibres (Lo et al., 2008). However it must be pointed 
out that dysferlin mislocalization in dystrophic muscle is not only linked to fibre 
regeneration but may also be due to defective membrane targeting of dysferlin (Lo et 
al., 2008). A recent study by Chiu et al., (2009) has demonstrated that muscle biopsies 
from dysferlinopathy patients show an excess of immature fibers indicating that 
muscle regeneration is delayed. Notexin was used to induce muscle damage in 
dysferlin deficient SJL/J mice and attenuated muscle regeneration was demonstrated, 
which was associated with delayed removal of necrotic fibres, an extended 
inflammatory phase and delayed functional recovery (Chiu et al., 2009). In their 
collection of dysferlin deficient muscle biopsies from patients they observed em 
inflammatory cell infiltrate with reduced neutrophil levels in muscle. Following 
muscle injury of SJL dysferlin deficient mice using notexin or by needle wounding 
Chiu et al., (2009) confirmed that there was a reduction in early neutrophil 
recruitment in muscle from dysferlin deficient C57BL/10.SJL-Dy5/mice. Satellite cell 
activation and myoblast fusion during regeneration was shown to be normal. Using 
dysferlin deficient myoblast cultures cytokine release upon stimulation was shown to 
be reduced. Collectively these findings have led to suggestions that dysferlin is not 
only involved in vesicle fusion but also secretion of cytokines from skeletal muscle. 
The inflammatory response following muscle damage has been shown to be critical 
for muscle regeneration. Neutrophils are recruited first to the muscle injury site and 
signaling fi-om neutrophils and satellite cells then recruit monocj^es, which undergo 
phagocytosis to remove cell debris (Gallardo et al, 2001; Fanin and Angelini, 2002; 
Luna et al., 2004). The monocytes recruited to the injury site first acquire an 
inflammatory phenotype to release proinflammatory cytokines, which activate satellite 
cell proliferation but then they switch phenotype to become anti-inflammatory 
stimulating myoblast fusion (Arnold et al., 2007). Depletion of neutrophils and 
monocytes in wild type muscle has been shown to delay muscle regeneration (Teixeira 
et al., 2003). A model has been proposed to suggest that in dysferlinopathy there is 
defective membrane repair but the reduced secretion of cytokines in the absence of 
dysferlin leads to impaired muscle regeneration and this then acts as the final trigger 
for the development of the dystrophic pathology (Chiu et al., 2009). 
1.4.2.7 Dvsferlin function in non-muscle cells 
Recent publications have extended the knowledge of dysferlin expression in non 
muscle cells. Dysferlin has been shown to be highly expressed in the apical plasma 
membrane of the syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs) in human placenta with some 
expression in blood vessels, leaky endothelial cells of circumventricular organs of 
CNS and glomeruli of kidney cells (Vandre et al., 2007; Hochmeister et al., 2006; 
Hassane et al., 2006). The expression of dysferlin in the human placental microvillous 
STBs was first identified through proteomic studies (Vandre et al, 2007). Dysferlin 
was shown to be prominent within the apical plasma membrane with lesser expression 
in the basal membranes (Vandre et al., 2007). This study also demonstrated trafficking 
of dysferlin to both apical and basal plasma membrane of the STB through a caveolin-
independent mechanism based on the absence of both a and 6 isoforms of CAVl 
staining in the STB by double labeling experiments. This suggested that dysferlin may 
be involved in polarized trafficking. Additionally, Vandre et al., (2007) have shown 
that dysferlin expression is highly increased in fusing and multinucleated syncytial 
cells and not in mononuclear cytotrophoblasts that had not fiised with syncytial 
structures (Vandre et al., 2007). 
In the study by Hochmeister et al., (2006), dysferlin expression in endothelial cells 
was detected in inflamed and non inflamed vessels in patients with multiple sclerosis 
(MS). In the inflamed CNS of patients with MS or in animals with experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis, dysferlin reactivity was shown to be induced in 
endothelial cells and the expression was shown to associate with vascular leakage 
(Hochmeister et al., 2006). In addition, many blood vessels with perivascular 
inflammatory infiltrates were shown to lack dysferlin expression in inactive lesions or 
in the normal-appearing white matter. In vitro analysis showed that expression of 
dysferlin in endothelial cells can be induced by stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-
alpha (Hochmeister et al., 2006). Hence, in this study dysferlin was shown to be a new 
marker for leaky brain vessels (Galvin et al., 2006). 
Expression of dysferlin in the kidney has been reported in patients with LGMD2B and 
these patients also showed renal abnormalities characterized by glomerular proteinuria 
(Hassane et al., 2006). Analysis o f urinary protein levels detected high levels of 
microalbuminuria, which was associated with an absence of dysferlm in the 
glomerular regions of the kidney. In kidney of patients with idiopathic minimal 
change nephropathy or healthy conti-ols no loss of dysferlin was observed in the 
glomerular regions of renal biopsies (Hassane et al., 2006). The presence of dysferlin 
in glomeruh has been associated with glomerular permeability. 
1.4.3 Mvoferlin 
Myoferlin was the first protein identified that shares the highest similarity to dysferlin 
(Davis et al., 2000). Like dysferlin, myoferlin is located at the sarcolemma of skeletal 
muscle and is also present in cytoplasmic vesicles, the nucleus and at the nuclear 
membrane (Davis et al., 2000). Myoferlin is a ubiquitously expressed protein and 
shows high expression in muscle, heart, kidney, spleen and lung. Initial studies 
investigated the expression of myoferlin in dystrophic muscle and although no 
significant changes in expression were observed in dysferlin deficient muscle (Inoue 
et al., 2006) the sarcolemmal expression of myoferlin was increased in mdx skeletal 
muscle (Davis et al., 2000). Since mdx muscle undergoes several rounds of 
degeneration and regeneration myoferlin was implicated in muscle regeneration 
(Davis et al., 2000). Subsequent studies on myoferlin null mice showed defective 
myogenesis and the loss of myoferlin was shown to result in reduced muscle mass 
with the loss of large diameter myofibers (Doherty et al., 2005). Myoferlin null 
muscle cultures displayed a reduced myogenic index compared to controls (Doherty et 
al., 2005). Using cardiotoxins to induce muscle regeneration it was demonstrated that 
mice lacking myoferlin were impaired in their ability to regenerate skeletal muscle 
after injury (Doherty et al., 2005). Staining of dystrophin showed many irregularly 
shaped small muscle fiber in myoferlin null muscle similar to a dystrophic phenotype. 
An increased expression of dysferlin was also observed in myoferlin null muscle 
(Doherty et al., 2005). In the C2C12 model of myoblast fusion myoferlin was 
expressed abimdantly in myoblasts primed for fusion, "prefiision" myoblasts. 
Myoferlin was foimd in vesicular structures in the cytoplasm and at the plasma 
membrane. In myoblasts fiising with myotubes myoferlin was shown to concentrate at 
sites of membrane merging (Davis et al., 2002; Doherty et al., 2005). Recently 
dysferlin has also been shown to concentrate at membrane fusion sites of 
myoblast/myotube undergoing fusion suggesting that both myoferlin and dysferlin are 
required for membrane merging (Huang et al., 2007). So far, myoferlin has not been 
shown to be directly linked to any human disease but the expression of myoferlin is 
upregulated in dystrophin-deficient (mdx) skeletal muscle and also in regenerating 
muscle (Davis et al., 2000; Haslett et al., 2002). Myoferlin shares biochemical 
similarities to dysferlin; its C2A domain has been shown to bind phospholipid in a 
calcium dependent manner like the dysferlin C2A domain (Davis et al., 2002). The 
second C2 domain of myoferlin C2B binds the membrane recycling protein EHD2 
(Doherty et al., 2008). EHD2 levels are reduced in myoferlin null muscle cells and by 
examining the endocytosis of transferrin, delayed membrane recycling was 
demonstrated in myoferlin null myoblasts (Doherty et al., 2008). Consistent with this 
the expression of a dominant negative EHD2 protein in myoblasts was shown to result 
in sequestration of myoferlin and inhibition of myoblast fiision (Doherty et al., 2008). 
These studies have highlighted that myoferlin is involved in membrane recycling 
during myoblast fusion. 
Proteomic analysis of endothelial cell (EC) caveolea/lipid rafts microdomains has 
demonstrated that myoferlin is strongly expressed in EC and vascular tissues 
(Bematchez et al., 2007). Subsequent studies of myoferlin null EC demonstrated that 
in cultured EC cells myoferlin was found at the cell surface and predominantly 
localized at the sarcolemma and lining of intact blood vessels. The loss of myoferlin 
was shown to reduce the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 
(VEGFR-2) and its autophosphorylation (Bematchez et al., 2007). Myoferlin was 
shown to regulate the stability of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor by 
forming a complex with dynamin-2 (Dyn-2) and this protected the receptor from 
CBL-dependent degradation in cells depleted for myoferlin (Bematchez et al., 2007; 
Bematchez et al., 2009). Consistent with this myoferlin knock out mice showed 
impaired VEGF permeability effect in vivo (Bematchez et al., 2007). Further studies 
by Bematchez et al., (2009) have provided further evidence that myoferlin has a role 
in endocytosis. The interaction of myoferlin with dynamin-2 prompted studies in 
endothelial cells to determine whether myoferlin is involved in receptor dependent 
endocytosis because dynamin-2 is required for fission of endocytic vesicles from the 
cell membrane. siRNA knockdown of myoferlin in EC cells was shovra to decrease 
clathrin dependent and raft dependent endocytosis. In cells overexpressing myoferlin 
endocytosis was increased (Bematchez et al., 2009). The role of myoferlin in 
endocytosis was shown to be dependent upon an interaction with dynamin-2 and 
caveolin-1. From these studies it appears that myoferlin is required for several 
endomembrane fusion events. 
1.4.4 Otoferlin 
Otoferlin, as the name implies is the ferlin highly expressed in the iimer ear including 
cochlea, vestibule and brain although a low level of expression is seen in other tissues 
including lung, kidney, skeletal muscle and heart (Yasunaga et al., 1999). By in situ 
hybridization, otoferlin staining was observed in mouse inner hair cells (IHC), outer 
hair cells (OHC), spiral ganglion cells, neuroepithelia of the utricle, saccule and 
semicircular canals at embryonic day 19.5, PO and P2 (Yasunaga et al., 2000). In the 
inner ear, otoferlin immunoreactivity was found highest in the IHC and the staining 
was shown to be associated with the basolateral region of these cells where the 
afferent synaptic contacts are located suggesting that otoferlin is a component of the 
hair cell presynaptic machinery. Ulfrastructural studies have demonstrated that 
otoferlin is associated with synaptic vesicles surrounding the ribbon and presynaptic 
membranes of IHC (Roux et al., 2006). Otoferlin mutations are linked with autosomal 
recessive non-sydromic deafiiess (Yasunaga et al., 1999; Yasunaga et al., 2000). 
Mutations in these patients have a type of hearing loss called auditory neuropathy, 
which prevents the fransmission of sound from the inner ear to the brain. Otoferlin has 
been implicated in synaptic exocytosis and is required for the late step of Ca""  
dependent synaptic vesicle exocytosis acting as the major Ca""  sensor triggering 
synapic vesicle fiision at the IHC ribbon synapse (Roux et al, 2006). Many C2 
domain containing membrane proteins are present in synaptic vesicles and are 
implicated in synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Nalefski and Falke, 1996). Synaptotagmin I 
(Syt I), the most extensively studied synaptic vesicle membrane protein, has been 
shown to interact with the two members of the SNARE complex; syntaxin 1 and 
SNAP25 and is considered as the major Ca""  sensor of fast synaptic vesicle exocytosis 
at conventional synapses (Kee and Scheller, 1996; Li et al., 1995; Gerona et al., 2000; 
Zhang et al., 2002; Reviews: Chapman, 2002; Sudhof, 2004). The synaptic location of 
otoferlin and its predicted C2 domains suggested that otoferlin might play a similar 
role in IHC synaptic vesicle fiision and otoferlin may also interact with syntaxin 1 and 
SNAP25. This was demonstrated in Otof-/- mice, which were shown to have a 
profound hearing impairment (Roux et al., 2006). Otof-/- IHCs lacked the fast 
component of the exocytotic burst even in increased concentration of Ca~" compared 
to control IHCs, which showed fast exocytotic burst in the presence of Ca'^. The 
experiments also showed that the deafiiess in otoferlin-deficient mice appeared to be 
caused by an almost complete loss of calcimn mediated exocytosis fi-ora IHC 
suggesting that otoferlin functions as the calcium sensor during synaptic exocytosis in 
IHC. Interaction of otoferlin with syntaxin 1 and SNAP25 was demonstrated by 
coimmunoprecipitation studies using protein extracts fi-om mouse cochlear sensory 
epithelium and confirmed by pull down assays using GFP otoferlin fusion proteins. 
These experiments demonstrated a direct binding of SNAP25 and syntaxin 1, which 
was also shown to be calcium dependent. Otoferlin and SNARE protein interactions 
have been confirmed and the interacting site on otoferlin for the SNARE interactions 
is the C2F domain (Ramakrishnan et al., 2009). Expression of otoferlin C2F 
mutations, which are linked with deafiiess impaired the ability of otoferlin to bind 
SNARE proteins indicating that these interactions with otoferlin regulate IHC synaptic 
exocytosis (Ramakrishnan et al., 2009). 
1.4.5 FER1L5 
Belonging to the ferlin family, FER1L5 is subgrouped with dysferlin and myoferlin 
based on the sequence and structural homology (see section 1.2, Figure 1.1 and 
Figure L4). The FER1L5 sequence was assembled by Dr. Bashir's group in 2005 and 
annotated sequences of FER1L5 are also deposited in Entrez Gene. The annotated 
sequence shows very good overlap with the sequence assembled by the Bashir's 
Laboratory, which represents the long FER1L5 isoform. In Enfrez Gene, sequences to 
a long and short isoform of FER1L5 are deposited. The long isoform of the FER1L5 
gene has a 6297 base pair sequence encoding a protein of 2098 amino acids with a 
predicted molecular mass of 242 kDa. The short isoform of the FER1L5 gene has a 
2536 base pair sequence encoding a protein of 802 amino acids, which shares 98% 
sequence similarity with long isoform of the FER1L5. The short isoform is predicted 
to have the last C2 domains present in the long isoform corresponding to C2E and 
C2F (see Figure 1.9A). FER1L5 shares 38% identity and 54% similarity with human 
dysferlin and myoferlin respectively (Table 1.1). The FER1L5 gene is conserved in 
evolution and is present in the rodent, frog, fly, and worm genomes (Table 1.2). 
FER1L5 has a similar structure to dysferlin and myoferlin and contains six C2 
domains corresponding to the C2A to C2F domains in dysferlin and myoferlin. It also 
has the dysferlin domain DysFN domain. The FER1L5 genome is organized across 
fifty two exons. The gene expression profile of FER1L5 during C2C12 differentiation 
was shown by Dr. Bashir's group to be similar to that of dysferlin and myoferlin, with 
expression increasing in differentiating myoblasts (Figure 1.9B). From these findings 
it was predicted that FER1L5 may be involved in muscle membrane fusion.

1.4.6 Aims of the project 
By perfonning homology modeling o f the ferlin C2 domains, analyzing the ferlin 
sequences and by examining the gene expression of FER1L5 during muscle 
differentiation FER1L5 has been shown to be similar to dysferlin and myoferlin. It 
was hypothesized that FER1L5 has a role in muscle membrane fusion. PERILS is a 
novel ferlin and very little is known about this protein, its subcellular distribution in 
muscle and function in muscle cells. The Bashir laboratory had generated a polyclonal 
antibody to FER1L5 using N-terminal specific peptides to the long isoform of 
FER1L5 (see section 2.1.2A). 
The aims of the project were to investigate whether FER1L5 has a role in muscle 
membrane fiision by 
1) Examining the subcellular distribution of FER1L5 in muscle tissue and in the 
C2C12 muscle cell lines. 
2) Determining i f FER1L5 shares a similar membrane distribution to dysferlin 
and myoferiin in muscle cells. 
3) Determining the expression o f FER1L5 during C2C12 muscle differentiation. 
4) Investigating whether inhibition of FER1L5 impairs myoblast fusion and 
membrane repair. 
CHAPTER II: MATERIALS AND 
METHODS 
2.1 Chemicals and antibodies 
2.1.1 Chemicals 
The chemicals used for my investigation were of analytical grade and purchased from 
VWR, Sigma and BDH. 
2.1.2 Antibodies 
Polyclonal antibodies to FER1L5 and myoferlin were generated by Dr. Bashir's 
laboratory. The monoclonal myoferlin was generated by the late Louise Anderson and 
was gifted to Dr. Bashir. The antibodies listed in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 were 
bought from commercial suppliers. The following antibodies were gifts from C. J. 
Hutchison (lamin A), R. A. Quinlan (P-tubulin), Angus Lamond (coilin) and 
Hannelore Haase (AHNAK KIS). 
A. FER1L5 antibody 
Since our group had assembled the novel FER1L5 sequence and no antibody was 
available this was generated by the company CovalAb. A polyclonal antibody was 
generated using two N-terminal peptides, LAPLPRPCMSIDFRD and 
TRIEKHQNRQYGLC corresponding to amino acids 15-30 (LAPLPRPCMSIDFRD) 
and 482-496 (TRIEKHQNRQYGLC) respectively in the Genbank FER1L5 sequence 
AY461813 corresponding to the long FER1L5 isoform (Appendix A). The peptides 
that were used showed minimal homology with dysferlin and myoferlin sequences 
(Figure 2.1). For immunofluorescence analysis the affinity purified antibody 
(generated by CovalAb) was used and for the westem analysis the final bleed was 
used. For peptide blocking equal amounts of each FER1L5 peptide was incubated 
with the FER1L5 antibody (final bleed or affinity purified antibody). Other confrols 
tested included preimmune serum. Tubes containing antibody and peptide were 
incubated with agitation at room temperature for 30 minutes and the immunoadsorbed 
mixture was dialyzed. The specificity of the FER1L5 polyclonal antibody is described 
in chapter I I I .

Figure 2.1. Multiple sequence alignment highlighting the FER1L5 amino acid 
sequences used to generate the PERILS antibody. The underlined sequences 
correspond to the peptides used for antibody generation, which show least similarity 
with the corresponding dysferlin and myoferlin sequences. Out of 15 amino acids in 
each FER1L5 peptide only one amino acid showed identity to dysferlin (indicated by 
#). Asterisks indicate similar amino acids. 
B. Mvoferlin antibodies 
For myoferlin we used two antibodies, a monoclonal antibody, FER1L3 was 
generated to the peptide sequence GDEPPPERRDRDNDSDDVE corresponding to 
amino acids 326-344 in the myoferlin sequence AAH52617.1. This antibody has been 
previously characterized (Jaiswal et al., 2007). The polyclonal antibody to myoferlin 
was generated to sequences previously described in Davis et al., (2000) to the peptide 
SEDGSRIRYGGRDYSLD corresponding to amino acid residues 1692-1708 in the 
myoferiin sequence (AF182316.1'). Affinity purified polyclonal myoferlin antibody 
was used for the immunofluorescence studies. The specificity of this antibody was 
checked by immunoadsorption as described for the FER1L5 antibody. 
2.2 Cell culture 
2.2.1 C2C12. NRK, HeLa. HDF and RD cells 
C2C12 is a murine skeletal muscle myoblast cell line (Jasmer and Kwak, 2006; 
Riquelme et al, 2006), which is commonly used to study myoblast fusion (Yaffe and 
Saxel, 1977). Proliferating C2C12 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 
10% FCS and 0.2% antibiotic at 37 C. When the proliferating cells approached 70% 
confluence they were either passaged using trypsin EDTA with washes m I X PBS or 
grown in differentiation media which contained DMEM supplemented with 2% donor 
horse serum. For immunolabelling, differentiating C2C12 cells were cultured on 
13mm glass coverslips (SLS # M1C3306) coated with laminin (5|ig/ml). The cell lines 
NRK (Normal Rat Kidney cell), HeLa and human dermal fibroblasts cells (HDF) were 
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 0.2%, antibiotic. Human RD 
(human rhabdosarcoma) cell line was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 20%) 
FBS. Cells were passaged using trypsin EDTA and all washes were performed with 
I X PBS. 
2.2.2 Crvopreservation of cultures 
All cells were routinely cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for longer storage. Sub-
confluent cultures were detached by trypsinisation and pelleted by centrifugation as 
described above. For T75 flasks, 1x10^ cells were resuspended on ice in 5ml of 
complete media containing 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 1 ml aliquots were 
transfected to cold cryotubes (kept at -20 C overnight). Cryotubes were then placed at 
-80C overnight before storage at -140 C the following day. To re-establish cultures, 
cell suspensions were thawed quickly in a 37C water bath and diluted into the 
appropriate media. Fresh media was added the following day. 
2.2.3 Passage of cells 
Confluent (70-80%) cells were briefly washed with 0.5 M EDTA in PBS and then 
treated with 0.5ml trypsin for approximately 1 min at 37C. The trypsin activity was 
neutralized by adding 10 ml PBS. The cells were centrifliged at 1000 rpm for 5 
minutes and resuspended in 5 ml of PBS. 20^1 cell aliquots were diluted with 20|il of 
trypan blue, mixed and single cell suspensions were counted using a Neubauer 
hemocytometer in duplicate. Cells were diluted in an appropriate volume of fresh 
DMEM containing 10% FCS with antibiotics and seeded into culture flasks. 
2.3 ImmuDohistochemistrv 
Eight micron cryostat adult human muscle cross sections were obtained from late Dr. 
Louise Anderson. Ethical permission was obtained for these and the work was 
performed in accordance with the Human Tissue Act (2007). The sections were fixed 
in 100% cold acetone for 5 minutes and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% 
TritonX-100 for another 5 minutes at room temperature. The sections were washed 
with IX PBS for a few times and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4C. 
The primary antibodies were applied in double staining combinations: polyclonal 
FERlL5/monoclonal dysferlin and polyclonal FERlL5/monoclonal myoferlin 
respectively. Following this, sections were incubated with the secondary antibodies, 
anti-rabbit Alexa 546 and anti-mouse Alexa 488 respectively for 1 hour at room 
temperature. The sections were then washed with PBS and stained with Mowiol 
containing DAPI for microscopy. 
2.4 Immunofluorescence 
Cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips held in 24 well or 6 well plates in 
appropriate media. For differentiating C2C12 cells we used laminin coated coverslips. 
Following washing of cultured cells in I X PBS the cells were fixed at the appropriate

time points in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in I X PBS for 10 minutes at 4C. Fixed 
cells were washed three times for 5 minutes in IX PBS at 4C and permeabilized with 
0.5% TritonX-100 in I X PBS for 5 minutes at 4C. For immunostaining of 
microtubules we followed a specialized method for cell permeabilization and fixation 
(Prescott et al., 1992). Cells were permeabilized for 30 seconds in permeabilization 
buffer (50mM Pipes, 50mM KCl, 0.5mM MgC12, ImM EGTA, ImM 
mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 4% polyethyleneglycol 40,000 at pH 6.8) and 
washed with PBS and then fixed with 90% methanol in MES buffer (lOOmM-2-
(Nmorphilino)-ethane sulphonic acid, ImM EGTA, ImM MgS04, pH 6.9) at -20 C 
for 5 minutes. Washed cells were then extracted with 1% Nonidet P40 in PBS for 10 
minutes at room temperature. Following permeabilization of fixed cells, cells were 
washed in PBS for 5 minutes at 4C and blocked in blocking buffer (5% FCS in I X 
PBS) for 30 minutes at room temperature prior to incubation with primary antibody. 
The coverslips were placed on parafilm for the antibody application. The primary 
antibodies used and their dilutions are described in Table 2.1. Al l primary antibodies 
were diluted in blocking buffer and applied for Ihr at room temperature followed by 
three 30 minute washes in blocking buffer to remove excess antibody. Following this 
the appropriate fluorescently labelled secondary antibody was applied in the dark for 1 
hour followed by three 30 minute washes in blocking buffer. Following application of 
secondary antibody coverslips were briefly dried and cells were mounted in Mowiol 
containing DAPI (5 x1 of 2 mg/ml) for confocal microscopy. 
2.5 Microscopy 
2.5.1 Confocal Imaging 
Upright Confocal laser scanning LSM 510 META (Carl Zeiss equipped with a cooled 
CCD camera) microscope at 40X and 63X/1.10 lens was used for imaging. Z-series 
were collected in Multi-track mode using sequential and simultaneous scanning 
averaging the background 4-7 times at a scan speed of 7 and a resolution of 
1024x1024. Each Z-stack had a thickness of 0.9^m. All montages were assembled in 
ImageJ software and Adobe Photoshop 6.0. 
2.5.2 Live Cell Imaging 
C2C12 myotubes were cultured in six well plates. Prior to imaging myotubes were 
treated with 2niM methyl-P-cyclodextrin (MCD) to deplete cholesterol from 
membranes. In other experiments 2mM MCD was applied after labeling myotubes 
with the lipid raft dye, Alexa Fluor 488 labeled cholera toxin subimit B (Vybrant 
Lipid Raft Labeling Kit, Molecular Probes) by incubation, at a dilution of 1:500 at 
37C for 60 minutes. Following labelling of the lipid rafts, myotubes were treated 
with 2mM MCD for 45 minutes. Imaging was performed using Zeiss AxioVision 
microscope. Images were acquired at 5 second intervals over a period of 60 minutes 
using a 20X objective. Images were assembled using AxioVision 4.5 software and 
then processed further by ImageJ and photoshop 6.0. 
2.6 Protein Analysis 
2.6.1 Whole Cell Protein Extraction 
All protein analysis was performed on ice. Whole cell protein was extracted from 
monolayer cells after washing 3 times in ice cold IX PBS using RIP A (Sigma) buffer 
containing Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Molecular 
Biochemicals, 1 tablet/10ml). Cells were scraped off dishes using a cell scraper and 
transferred to 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes where the cells were vortexed briefly 2 or 3 
times followed by incubation on ice for 20 minutes. Following this cells were 
centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4C. The supernatant was removed for 
protein quantification or aliquoted for storage at -80C until needed. 
2.6.2 Protein Quantification 
The Lowry method was used to determine the protein concentrations of the extracted 
proteins. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate using 5mg/ml BSA as the standard 
protein. BSA concentrations of S^g, 10|ig, 20\ig and 40jig per ml were used to 
generate standard curves. Protein samples were used at dilutions fi-om 1 ^il to 3^1 in 
the colorimetric assay. Samples were read in Beckman DU-600 spectrophotometer at 
595nm. The unknown protein concentrations were calculated using the standard 
curve: Y= mX. (Y = protein concentration in | ig/ | i l , m = gradient of the line and X = 
Abs at 595 nm). 
2.6.3 Western Blot Analysis 
A) Preparation of the SDS-PAGE Gel 
SDS gel electrophoresis was performed to separate proteins using the Mini-Protean 3 
gel system (BioRad Mini PROTEAN & Mini TransBlot). The concentration of the 
acrylamide resolving gel varied dependenting upon the molecular weight of the 
protein to be analysed (Table 2.3A). For dysferlin, myoferlin and FER1L5, 6% gels 
were used. For lamin A (70 kDa), actin (42kDa) and G3PDH (30 kDa) 5-10% gels 
were used. Table 2.3B describes the constituents of the SDS gels, which were 
immediately poured between glass plates held on the casting ring. The gel was 
overlaid with saturated butanol to obtain a smooth interphase between the resolving 
and the stacking gel. Following polymerization the stacking gel mixture (4% 
acrylamide, 0.5mM Tris HCl pH 6.8, 20% SDS, 10% APS) was poured on top of the 
resolving gel (the resolving butanol was removed prior to this) and the combs were 
inserted between the plates. After the gel had polymerized the combs were removed 
and the wells were washed with distilled water before use. Approximately 2O-30fxg of 
purified protein samples were denatured using an equal volume of 2X loading buffer 
(0.5M Tris-HCI, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 70mM lauryl sulphate, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 
15^1 bromophenol blue) by incubation at 95C for 5 minutes. Samples were briefly 
centrifuged prior to gel loading. Electrophoresis was performed (according to standard 
protocol) for 2 hours at lOOV followed by 150V for 2 hours. The prestained protein 
markers (BioRad) were used to monitor the electrophoresis. 
B) Immunoblotting 
This was performed using the Transblot (BioRad). Following SDS-PAGE gels were 
removed from the plates, rinsed in transfer buffer and electroblotted onto 0.45pM 
nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in transfer buffer for 1 hour at 
150V at room temperature with cooling. Post transferred nitrocellulose membranes 
were incubated for 1 hour in 3% milk powder (w/v) in PBS containing 0.2% Tween-
20 and rinsed briefly 3 times for 5 minutes with 5% non fat milk/0.2% Tween-20 to 
reduce non-specific binding sites. The blocked membranes were incubated with 
primary antibody appropriately diluted in 3% non fat milk (w/v) in PBS for 24hr at 
4C with constant shaking and washed three times in 2.5% to 3% non fat milk for 5 
minutes. Immunoreactive bands were detected by sequential incubations with 
appropriate HRP conjugated secondary antibody diluted in non fat milk for 1 hour at 
room temperature with constant agitation, followed by three 5 minute washes with 3 
% skimmed milk/0.2% Tween-20 and a final wash in I X PBS. For immunodetection, 
the ECL-enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v) and 
applied to the blots. The labeled blots were exposed to X-OMAT films (Kodak) for 
different times and adjusted accordingly depending on the results. 
2.6.4 Densitometry 
To estimate the protein proportion of each band, densitometry was performed using 
UVI bandmap software (UVItec, Cambridge, UK). The values of the each specific 
band fi"om three different blots (triplicate) were obtained separately by calculating the 
protein proportions against the background as a control. The percentage values of each 
band were obtained by calculating the mean percentage fi-om these three values. 
2.7 Subcellular Fractionation 
A) Intracellular membrane fractionation 
1x107 C2C12 cells cultured in 12 x 90mm dishes were washed with cold PBS to 
remove media and homogenized in HES buffer (255mM sucrose, 20mM HEPES, 
I m M EDTA at pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor using a hand held Bounce 
homogenizer by applying 15-20 strokes. The homogenates were centrifuged at 
19,000g for 20 minutes at 4C using a Beckman JA-20 rotor and the supematants were 
used to prepare the intracellular membrane fractions. The pellet was retained on ice 
for preparation of the plasma membranes. The 19,000g supernatant was recentrifuged 
at 40,000g for 20 minutes to obtain the low density microsomal pellet. The 40,000g 
supernatant was further centrifiiged at ISO.OOOg for 90 minutes in a Ti-50 rotor to 
obtain the high density microsomal pellet. All pellets were resuspended in HES buffer 
containing protease inhibitors and aliquots stored at -80C. The pellet obtained from 
the 19,000g centrifugation was resuspended in HES buffer containing 1.12M sucrose 
and layered onto lOmls of 1.12M sucrose for centrifugation at 100,000g for 60 
minutes. The white fluffy plasma membrane layer was aspirated and diluted in sucrose 
free HES buffer for centrifugation to obtain sucrose free plasma membrane fi-actions.

B) Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation 
1x10^ C2C12 myoblasts were trypsinised and the cell pellet was homogenised using a 
hand held Dounce homogeniser in 1.5ml of homogenization buffer (HEPES 20mM 
pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5mM MgCb, 2.5mM EGTA, 5% sucrose + protease inhibitor 
cocktail). The lysed cells were centrifuged at lOOOg for 15 minutes. Following 
centrifiigation 1 ml post nuclear supernatant was loaded on top of sucrose gradient 
ranging from 20-40% and ultracentrifuged at 166,000g in a SW41 rotor (Beckman) 
for 12 hr. 1ml fractions were collected carefully from top of the gradient and aliquoted 
and stored at -80C until required. 
C) Floatation sucrose gradient centrifugation 
C2C12 myoblast pellets were obtained by centrifugation of 1x10^ lysed cells at lOOOg 
for 15 min. The pellets were resuspended in 0.32M sucrose, 5mM HEPES pH 7.4 
containing protease inhibitors supplemented with 0.5% final concentration of Triton 
X-100. After incubation on ice for 30 minutes the mixture was loaded onto a 
floatation sucrose gradient over two cushions of I M and 1.3M sucrose respectively. 
After centrifugation at I66,000g for 18hr in a SW-41 rotor (Beckman) 1 ml fractions 
were collected, aliquoted and stored at -80 C for further analysis. 
2.8 Analysis of conditioned medium for FER1L5 vesicles 
C2C12 cells were cultured and at 70% confluence were switched from growth media 
to differentiation media. 7ml of differentiation media was added to each dish. 
Conditioned media was aspirated from each dish at days 0, 2, 4, 8 following serum 
withdrawal. The aspirated media was centrifuged at 2000g for 15 minutes to remove 
any floating cells and cell debris. After a further low speed centrifugation at 4000g for 
15 minutes the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation using a SW41 rotor at 
150,000g for 90 minutes. The invisible pellets were resuspended in 100^1 1 X PBS 
containing protease inhibitor cocktail and analyzed by western blotting. 
2.9 siRNA studies 
2.9.1 Generation of C2C12 stably expressing myoferlin siRNA 
RNA interference was performed in C2C12 cells using the mammalian expression 
vector pSUPER.g^/neo (Oligogene) for the direct synthesis of siRNA transcripts 
using the polymerase HI-RNA gene promoter. The vector co-expresses green 
fluorescent protein (GFP) to allow detection of transfected cells. To knock down 
endogenous myoferlin the following gene specific sequences to myoferlin were 
designed using the RNA design tool Ohgoengine. Murine myoferlin 5' 
CCCTCTGAGCTCATGGATG 3'; Human myoferiin 5' 
TGCGAACGGCGATAAAGCA 3'; Human and murine myoferiin 5' 
TTCAGTTTGAAGTCAGCAT 3'. Scrambled siRNA with no predicted target site in 
the murine and human genome 5' TAGTTGTACCGGTCATTAA 3' was used as a 
negative control. The oligos were designed with Hindlll sites to allow 
cloning into the vector. The sense and the antisense sequences were separated by 
TCTCTTGAA spacer sequences. The sense and antisense oligos were annealed and 
cloned at the BgE and Hindlll site in the p-SUPER vector. Cloning and purification of 
myoferlin plasmids were carried out by Maria Hill . To perform myoferlin knock down 
lxl0^C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and transfected 
with 3|ag of the each of the myoferlin siRNA and scrambled siRNA plasmids 
respectively in lOOfil of nucleofector solution and electroporated using specified 
conditions for C2C12 cells. Following electroporation 1ml of growth media was 
added to the electroporated cells and they were transferred into 6-weIl plates. 24 hours 
after transfection cells were switched to grovslh media containing G418 (0.5mg/ml) 
for 10-15 days. Media was refreshed every 4 days. The G418 resistant cells were then 
seeded into 96 well dishes to establish single cell colonies and subsequently 
transferred to 24 well, 6 well and 90 mm dishes for fiirther propagation. Seven 
independent single cell colonies were taken further for culturing and then cells were 
analyzed for myoferlin expression by performing immunofluorescence and western 
analysis. 
2.10 FER1L5 antibody loading 
A whole range of single and pooled siRNAs specific for FER1L5 were used and 
transfection of C2C12 were performed using the Amaxa nucleofection. Transient 
knockdown of FER1L5 did not result in reduction of FER1L5 protein levels 
(information provided by Dr. Khali Saleki). Therefore a different approach was 
adopted to inhibit FER1L5 function, by loading C2C12 cells with FER1L5 antibody 
by nucleofection. The Amaxa electroporation protocol for C2C12 cells was modified 
in that the appropriate electroporation buffer supplied for C2C12 cells was replaced 
with preimmime serum, FER1L5 peptide blocked serum and FER1L5 antiserum 
respectively. Prior to antibody introduction into C2C12 cells, the uptake into C2C12 
cells of large molecules such as fluorescent dextran was possible in serum rather than 
the nucleofector buffer using the electroporation conditions specified for C2C12 cells. 
Following transfection of fluorescent dextran (or a control GFP plasmid in serum) in 
some cases transfection of up to 50% of C2C12 cells was observed. The same 
electroporation conditions as used for the fluorescent dextran or GFP plasmid were 
applied to C2C12 cells incubated separately with each of 100 ,1 preimmune serum, 
FER1L5 peptide blocked serum and FER1L5 antiserum respectively. Equal densities 
of each group of C2C12 cultures were grown in differentiation media on glass 
coverslips held in six well plates until day 9 following serum withdrawal. The cells 
were then fixed, permeabilised and immunolabelled with anti-desmin antibody to 
identify myogenic cells and mounted in Mowiol containing DAPI for confocal 
microscopy. The fusion index of the different C2C12 cultures loaded with preimmune 
serum, peptide blocked FER1L5 serum and FER1L5 antiserum respectively was 
quantified by analyzing twenty fields on the coverslips at 40X magnifications and 
counting the number of desmin positive nuclei in myotubes in respect of total number 
of nuclei. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired students t-test using 
Microsoft excel. "P" values were obtained by performing unpaired students t-test 
using Microsoft excel. 
CHAPTER III: PROTEIN 
EXPRESSION OF FER1L5 IN 
MUSCLE C E L L S 
3.1 Introduction 
C2C12 is used extensively as a cell culture model to study the function of muscle 
proteins in vitro. C2C12 cells were used to examine the role of FER1L5 in muscle 
membrane fusion since recent studies in C2C12 cells have been performed for 
dysferlin and myoferlin to study their role in membrane repair and myoblast fusion 
respectively (Doherty et al. 2005; Klinge et ai, 2007; Luna et al, 2006). To 
investigate the role of FER1L5 in muscle membrane fiision a polyclonal antibody was 
used. In this chapter the specificity of the FER1L5 antibody is first demonstrated and 
then the distribution of FER1L5 in C2C12 myoblasts and in adult human muscle 
sections is described. 
3.2 Results 
3.2.1 The specificity of the FER1L5 antibody 
The specificity of the polyclonal FER1L5 antibody was examined by comparing the 
signal obtained following incubation with peptide blocked FER1L5 anfiserum and 
preimmune serum respectively using C2C12 lysates for immunoblotting and C2C12 
cells for immunolabelling. Following peptide blocking the immimoblotting was 
performed by Dr. Khalil Saleki. In C2C12 lysates, FER1L5 antiserum recognized a 
267 kDa protein (Figure 3.1 A). The molecular mass of the FER1L5 protein was 
determined by comparing the relative mobility of the FER1L5 protein with that of 
protein markers of known molecular mass. The predicted molecular mass of the 
FER1L5 sequence assembled by our group was 242 kDa. The FER1L5 protein 
detected in C2C12 lysates corresponds to the long FER1L5 isoform. Following 
peptide blocking, the signal obtained with the FER1L5 antiserum by western blotting 
was abolished. No signal was obtained with preimmune serum. FER1L5 expression 
was also examined in different mammalian cell lines and the 267 kDa FER1L5 protein 
was detected (Figure 3.IB, provided by Dr. Khalil Saleki). FER1L5 protein is bigger 
in size compared to the 230 kDa proteins reported for dysferlin (Anderson et. al., 
1998; Matsuda et al., 1999) and myoferiin (Davis et al., 2000). By immunolabelling 
with affinity purified FER1L5 antibody, a predominant punctate staining pattern was 
Figure 3.1. Examining the specificity of the PERILS antibody. Equal amounts of 
protein (20fj.g) prepared from C2C12 lysates were used to generate duplicate western 
blots by Dr Khalil Saleki. A) Following immunoblotting a signal was obtained with 
FER1L5 anti serum (blot 1) but not with peptide blocked FER1L5 antiserum (blot 2) 
and preimmune serum (blot 3) respectively. FER1L5 antiserum detected a 267 kDa 
protein (arrow indicate the position of the 250 kDa protein marker. B) The 267 kDa 
FER1L5 protein is detected in mammalian cell lines, HEK293 Oiuman embiyonic 
kidney 293 cells), SWJ3 (adrenal carcinoma cell line), HT29 (human colon 
adenocarcinoma cell line), HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells), 
KELOID (keloid fibroblasts) and HDF (human dermal fibroblasts) cells. C) For the 
immunolabelling experiments the affinity purified FERIL5 antibody (670ng/50pil) 
specificity was examined after incubation with equal amounts of FER1L5 competitive

observed in C2C12 myoblasts indicating a vesicular localization of FER1L5 in 
myoblasts (Figure 3.1C). In addition to the cytoplasmic staining, some FER1L5 
staining was also detected in the nucleus. No staining was detected with the peptide 
blocked FER1L5 antibody (Figure 3.1C). The FER1L5 staining pattem was also 
examined in different cell lines such as rhabdosarcoma (RD), HeLa, NRK (normal rat 
kidney cell line) and HDF. Al l cell types displayed a predominant pimctate staining 
pattem throughout the cytoplasm indicating a vesicular localization. Nuclear staining 
of FER1L5 was also evident in these cells (Figure 3.2). 
3.2.2 FER1L5 expression in adult human muscle sections 
Cross-sections of adult human muscle were labelled with antibodies to FER1L5, 
dysferhn and myoferlin respectively. Immunolabelling of FER1L5 with dysferlin and 
myoferlin was performed. Very weak immimostaining of FER1L5 was detected at the 
sarcolemma when analysed by confocal Z-series images but the staining was 
predominantly intracellular as shown in the projected Z-series images in Figure 3.3Bi, 
Ci. Dysferlin and myoferlin staining was observed at the sarcolemma and was higher 
compared to FER1L5. For dysferlin and myoferlin some intracellular staining was 
also observed (Figure 3.3Bii, Cii). Intracellular dysferlin staining in human muscle 
fibres has been reported (Anderson et ai, 1998, Matsuda et al, 1999; Piccolo et al, 
2000; Inoue et al., 2006). The staining of FER1L5 was shown to be specific because 
no staining was detected in the control sections stained with secondary antibody alone 
(Figure 3.3A). In some areas, partial costaining of FER1L5 and dysferlin and 
FER1L5 and myoferlin respectively was observed (Figure 3.3Biii and 3.3Ciii). 
3.2.3 The subceUular distribution of FER1L5 in C2C12 myoblasts 
Since the staining pattem obtained after immunolabelling C2C12 muscle cells with 
FER1L5 antibody suggested that FER1L5 is present in vesicles the distribution of 
FER1L5 was investigated in more detail by biochemical fi-actionation of C2C12 cells. 
First membrane fractions were generated by sucrose gradient fractionation of low 
speed supematants of C2C12 lysates and equal volumes of each fraction were 
analysed by western blotting. I prepared the lysates and Dr. Khalil Saleki performed 
the western blotting. The distribution of FER1L5 was examined and compared with

PERILS was examined by immunofluorescence using cross sections of human muscle. 
PERILS staining was detected predominantly intracellularly (Bi and Ci). Dysferlin 
and myoferlin staining was detected at the sarcolemma and also intracellularly (Bit 
and Cii). In some areas partial co-staining of PERILS with dysferlin (Biii) and 
myoferlin (Ciii) was observed. Co-stained regions are indicated by arrow heads (Biv 
and Civ). Staining specificity was shown using secondary antibody as shown in (A).

dysferlin and myoferlin respectively. FER1L5 immunoreactivity was detected in all 
membrane fractions prepared from C2C12 myoblasts, low density microsomes 
(LDM), high density microsomes (HDM), mitochondria/nuclei and plasma membrane 
fractions. A similar distribution was detected for dysferlin and myoferlin. (Figure 
3.4A). The fidelity of the fractionation was confirmed by examining the distribution of 
lamin A, a nuclear lamina protein (Markiewick et ai, 2004) which was only detected 
in the mitochondria/nuclei fraction. The data highlights the dynamic intracellular 
membrane distribution of PERILS but also dysferlin and myoferlin respectively. The 
data indicated that PERILS was present in vesicles. 
The properties of PERILS vesicles in C2C12 cells were examined next by performing 
continuous sucrose density ulfracentrifligation. Post nuclear myoblast supematants 
were prepared and loaded onto 20-40% sucrose gradients. Following 
ulfracentriftigation equal volumes of each fraction were analyzed by western analysis. 
PERILS was predominantly detected in low density vesicles (fractions 4 and 5) 
although small amounts did co-sediment with dense vesicular fractions. Myoferlin and 
dysferlin showed an equal distribution between the lighter and denser vesicular 
fractions (fractions 3 to 6) (Figure 3.4B). The sedimentation profiles of the proteins 
AHNAK, caveolin and Bin 1 were also obtained. AHNAK is a dysferlin and 
myoferlin interacting protein (Huang et al, 2007) and a marker for enlargeosomal 
vesicles, which have also been implicated in membrane repair (Borgonovo et al., 
2002; Cocucci et al., 2004). AHNAK immunoreactivity was only detected in the 
lighter vesicular fractions (fractions 1 and 2). Por caveolin 3, a muscle membrane 
protein (Song et al., 1996), which is thought to regulate the endocytosis of dysferlin, 
overlapping immunoreactivity was observed with dysferlin, myoferlin and PERILS 
respectively. Bin 1, a T-tubule marker protein (Lee et al., 2002), which has been co-
localized with dysferlin in C2C12 myotubes at sites of membrane wounding (Klinge 
et al., 2007) co-sedimented in fractions 3 to S (low and high density fractions). The 
co-sedimentation profile of Bin 1 displayed overlaps with dysferlin and partially 
overlapped with myoferlin and PERILS (Figure 3.4B). Overall the co-sedimentation 
profile of PERILS vesicles overlapped with those obtained for dysferlin and 
myoferlin vesicles suggesting that PERILS vesicles were similar to dysferlin and 
myoferlin vesicles. To obtain further evidence of this the solubility of PERILS, 
Figure 3.4. The subcellular distribution of FER1L5 in C2C12 myoblasts. A) 
Membrane fractions were prepared from C2CI2 lysates by sucrose gradient 
centrifugation. Membrane distribution was then analyzed by western blotting using 
FER1L5 antiserum. Equal loading of each fraction demonstrated that FER1L5 was 
present in high density microsomes (HDM), low density microsomes (LDM), nuclei/ 
mitochondria (N/M) and plasma membrane (PM). Similar profiles were obtained for 
dysferlin and myoferlin. Lamin A was only detected in the nuclear/mitochondrial 
fractions. The data is representative of three independent experiments. B) The 
buoyant properties of FER1L5, dysferlin and myoferlin vesicles was examined by 
fractionating on 20-40% sucrose gradients. Equal volumes of each fraction were

treated C2C12 cells was examined after resuspending post nuclear C2CI2 lysate 
pellets in buffer supplemented with Triton X-100, 0.5% final concentration. Caveolin-
3 and transferrin receptor represented the markers for detergent resistant membranes 
and detergent soluble membranes respectively. Fractions 1-4 corresponded to the 
floated fractions and fractions 5-8 corresponded to the dissolved fractions 
respectively. Fraction 9 corresponded to the nuclear fi'action. The data is 
representative of two independent experiments.

dysferlin and myoferlin vesicular membranes, in detergent, was examined by 
performing floatation sucrose gradient centrifiigation of postnuclear C2C12 
membranes treated with 0.5% final concentration of TX-100. Following fractionation, 
equal volumes of each fraction were analyzed by Western blotting. The detergent 
solubility profiles of the ferlin vesicular membranes were compared with two proteins, 
caveolin-3 a well known marker of detergent resistant membranes (van Deurs et al., 
2003; Cocucci et al., 2004) and transferrin receptor as a marker for detergent soluble 
membranes respectively (Cocucci et al., 2004). Dysferlin and myoferlin 
immunoreactivity was observed in both floated and dissolved fractions. Fraction 4 
represented the interface between the floated and dissolved fractions (Figure 3.4C). 
Por PERILS, the immunoreactivity was mostly evident in the dissolved non-floated 
fractions, fractions S to 8 suggesting that the membranes of PERILS vesicles are 
largely non-resistant to detergent. Caveolin-3 showed immunoreactivity in all of the 
fractions but predominantly in the floated fractions (fractions 2-4) consistent with 
what has been reported for this protein (Cocucci et al., 2004). The sedimentation 
profile for transferrin receptor was consistent with what has been reported for 
transferrin receptor containing vesicles (recycling vesicles), which are solubilized by 
TX-100 (Cocucci et al., 2004) with the immunoreactivity mostly recovered in the non-
floated dissolved fractions, S and 6. Overall the co-sedimentation profiles of dysferlin, 
myoferlin and PERILS overlapped with each other suggesting that these proteins are 
present in similar vesicles. 
3.2.4 Co-staining of FER1L5 with dvsferlin and mvoferlin in C2C12 ceils 
Based on the biochemical fractionation data PERILS was predicted to co-localize 
with dysferlin and myoferlin respectively in C2C12 cells. This was investigated by 
performing co-immunolabelling of C2C12 myotubes with antibodies to 
FERlLS/dysferlin and PERlLS/myoferlin respectively. Myotubes were used for the 
co-immunolabelling experiments because high dysferlin expression has not been 
observed in myoblasts (Doherty et al., 2005; Foxton et al., 2004). Confocal images 
representative of FERlLS/dysferlin and FERlLS/myoferlin expression in myotubes 
are shown in Figure 3.5. In myotubes, following immunolabelling with PERILS 
affinity purified antibody, PERI LS was detected in vesicular structures in the

cytoplasm and there was also a subnuclear co-staining (Figure 3.5Ai, Bi). Co-staining 
of FER1L5 with both dysferlin and myoferlin was observed in only a small 
subpopulation of vesicular structures in C2C12 myotubes (Figure 3.5Alii, Biii). 
Myoferlin and dysferlin displayed minimal partial co-staining in the cytoplasm and 
subnuclear regions in myotubes (Figure 3.5C). My data indicated that FER1L5 is 
present in distinct ferlin vesicles in C2C12 cells. The nuclear distribution of dysferlin 
and myoferlin during myoblast fusion has not been reported before and was confirmed 
by Dr. Khalil Saleki by western blotting of nuclear fractions obtained from myoblasts 
and myotubes respectively. FER1L5 was detected in myotube nuclei by western 
blotting. 
3.2.5 The organeUe distribution of FER1L5 in C2C12 ceUs 
To determine the identity of the organelle(s) positive for PERILS, co-
immunolabelling was performed in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes using the 
PERILS affinity purified antibody and markers to known organelles such as early 
endosomes (EEAl), late endosomes/lysosomes (Lamp-1), enlargeosomes, (AHNAK), 
Golgi vesicles (TGN38), recycling vesicles (transferrin receptor), endocytic vesicles 
(clathrin) and T-tubule vesicles (Bin 1). No co-staining of PERILS with EEAl, 
LAMPl , TGN38, transferrin receptor and Bin 1 was observed in both myoblasts and 
myotubes (data not shown but available on request). Co-staining of PERILS with 
clathrin and AHNAK respectively was observed in a small population of cytoplasmic 
vesicles in both myoblasts (Figure 3.6Ai, ii) and myotubes (Figure 3.6Bi, ii).

3.2 Discussion 
In this chapter the specificity of a polyclonal PERILS antibody was demonstrated and 
following this the expression of PERILS was investigated by western blotting and 
immunolabelling. On western blots PERILS recognized a 267 kDa protein, which is 
slightly larger than the other characterized ferlins, dysferlin (230kDa) (Anderson, et. 
at., 1998; Matsuda et al.,\999), myoferlin (230kDa) (Davis et ah, 2000) and otoferlin 
(220kDa) (Yasunaga et al, 2000, Roux et al, 2006). 
The expression of PERILS was also examined in adult human muscle sections. Weak 
sarcolemmal staining was detected for PERILS compared to dysferUn and myoferlin 
fi-om the Z-stacks of confocal microscopy but the sarcolemmal staining was not 
clearly observed in the projected merged image as shown in Pigvire 3.3. To avoid the 
errors in immunofluorescence to investigate the subcellular localization in detail we 
are generating PERILS GPP fiision proteins in collaboration with Dr. Martin Cann, 
Durham University. These alternative strategies will then be used to confirm our 
results. A detailed distribution of PERILS in adult human muscle is being performed 
in collaboration with Dr. Jens Reimann (Bonn, Germany) and the preliminary data 
supports the data presented in this chapter. In C2C12 cells, PERILS was shown to be 
present in vesicles, which share overlapping properties with dysferlin and myoferlin 
vesicles. PERILS was shown to be predominantly present in low density vesicles the 
membranes of which were largely non-resistant to non-ionic detergent. Dysferlin and 
myoferlin appeared to be more dynamic in their vesicular distribution, existing in both 
low and high density vesicles whose membranes showed detergent resistance and 
solubility. The co-sedimentation profiles of PERILS, dysferlin and myoferlin vesicles 
respectively overlapped with each other and suggested that PERILS, dysferlin and 
myoferlin may co-localize in C2C12 muscle cells. This was investigated by co-
immunolabelling of PERlLS/dysferlin and PER ILS/myoferlin respectively in C2C12 
myotubes. This demonstrated that PERILS, dysferlin and myoferlin are present in 
distinct vesicles in myotubes. Interestingly, PERILS was also detected in myotube 
nuclei where it showed extensive co-localization with myoferlin compared to 
dysferlin. A nuclear distribution of dysferlin and myoferlin in C2C12 cells has not 
been reported before. The nuclear distribution was confirmed by nuclear fi-actionation 
of myoblasts and myotubes by Dr. Khalil Saleki (Presented at the 2'' Dysferlin 
Conference, Puerto Rico, 2008). Dysferlin is predicted to have a role in myogenic 
signaling based on observations that in dysferlin deficient myotubes there is a severe 
reduction in the gene expression of the terminal muscle differentiation marker, 
myogenin, which correlates with delayed myoblast fusion highlighting that there may 
be a direct interaction between dysferlin and myogenin during early myogenesis. It 
has been suggested that dysferlin and myogenin may share a common signaling 
pathway during skeletal muscle differentiation (Luna et al, 2006). Since this study 
has demonstrated that FER1L5 and myoferlin also have a nuclear distribution during 
myoblast fusion and these proteins show partial nuclear co-localization with dysferlin 
one can speculate that these ferlins may also have a role in myogenic signaling. The 
nuclear distribution of these proteins during myoblast fusion needs to be investigated 
fiarther. 
The biochemical fractionation experiments highlighted that the co-sedimentation 
profiles of FER1L5, dysferlin and myoferlin membranes partially overlapped with the 
T-tubule protein, Binl (Lee, et al., 2002). The T-tubule membrane system has a role 
in excitation-contraction coupling and is also a source of vesicles (Lee et al., 1993; 
Carozzi et al, 2000). Recent studies have demonstrated that dysferlin, which is 
predominantly localized to the T-tubule membrane system in C2C12 myotubes 
accumulates with Bin 1, in vesicles at myoblast/myotube membrane fusion sites and 
also at sites of membrane wounding suggesting that T-tubules may be the source of 
the dysferlin vesicles, which participate in muscle membrane fusion (Klinge et al., 
2007). The co-sedimentation data presented in this chapter suggested that PERILS 
and myoferlin membranes may be derived from T-tubule membranes in C2C12 
muscle cells. PERILS was found to show no co-staining with Bin 1 in myotubes. Co-
immunolabelling was performed with markers to known vesicles. No co-staining was 
observed with marker to early endosomes, late endosomes, Golgi derived vesicles, 
transferrin receptor and T-tubule vesicles. A small population of PERILS vesicles co-
stained with AHNAK and endocytic vesicles. Overall the data suggests that PERILS 
is present in distinct vesicles in C2C12 cells. 
CHAPTER IV: FER1L5 
EXPRESSION AND 
DISTRIBUTION DURING C2C12 
MYOBLAST FUSION 
4.1 Introduction 
The overlapping properties of PERILS, dysferlin and myoferlin vesicles in C2C12 
cells indicated that PERILS may have a role in similar muscle membrane fusion 
events as dysferlin and myoferlin respectively, namely myoblast fusion and membrane 
repair. To investigate this, the expression of PERILS in differentiating C2C12 muscle 
cells, and the effects of PERILS inhibition on the myogenic index of these cells was 
examined. In this chapter the expression and distribution of PERILS during C2C12 
myoblast fiision is described. 
4.2 Results 
4.2.1 FER1L5 expression during C2C12 myoblast fusion 
Proliferating C2C12 myoblasts grown at 70% confluency were switched to 
differentiation media and the cells were then lysed at different stages of myoblast 
fusion (DO, D2, D4, DIO and D12 (days) following serum withdrawl). Immunoblot 
analysis was performed on lysates obtained from C2C12 cultures harvested at 
different stages of myoblast fusion. PERILS was shown to be expressed at all stages 
of myoblast fusion, from proliferating myoblasts to mature myotubes (Figure 4.1). 
PERILS expression did not increase dramatically as the cultures became abundant in 
myotubes as has been reported for dysferlin (Doherty et al., 200S: Poxton et al., 2004) 
PERILS levels appeared to be slightly higher in early differentiating cultures (at day 4 
following serum withdrawal) (Figure 4.1). The increase in the PERILS expression 
levels were determined using densitometry by calculating the mean percentage values 
of each the band intensity from three different blots and compared the mean 
percentage values of the each band intensity. This showed that the expression levels of 
PERILS were increased 20% at D2 and 30% at D4. The lysates were also examined 
for dysferlin expression and this increased as cultures became abundant in myotubes 
(Davis et al, 2002; Poxton et al., 2004; Doherty et al., 2005) (Figure 4.1). Actin was 
used as a loading control. C2C12 myoblast fusion is non-synchronous and the 
differentiating cultiires used to analyze the overall PERILS expression contained a 
mixture of cells at different stages of myoblast fusion, PERILS expression was also 
examined by immunolabelling, using an affinity purified PERILS antibody. In the

differentiating cultures, the expression of PERILS was slightly higher in prefiising 
myoblasts and myotubes respectively, compared with mononucleated myoblasts 
(Figure 4.2A). In myotubes, PERILS was present in vesicular structures indicating 
that it had a similar cytoplasmic distribution as observed in myoblasts (Figure 4.2Bi). 
In myotubes, in addition to the cj^oplasmic distribution, PERILS was also present in 
the nucleus. A characteristic nuclear PERILS staining in aggregate like structures was 
observed in all myotube nuclei (Figure 4.2A, Bii). The nuclear aggregates stained 
with PERILS antibody in myotubes were shown to be specific by peptide blocking 
(Figure 4.2C). Following peptide blocking of the PERILS antibody no nuclear and 
cytoplasmic staining was observed indicating that the myotube staining was specific. 
In addition to the characteristic nuclear distribution of PERILS, cytoplasmic vacuoles, 
largely firee of PERILS staining were detected in C2C12 myotubes (Figure 4.3i-iv). 
DAPI staining was used to show that these cytoplasmic vacuoles were not nuclei 
(Figure 4.3ii). The size of these cytoplasmic vacuoles ranged from 2-3 jim and they 
were present as single or multiple units (Figure 4.3i, iii-iv). Ln some myotubes 
intercellular connections emerging from the PERILS free vacuoles and coimecting 
with neighbouring myotubes were observed (Figure 4.3v). PERILS stained 
intercellular connections were also observed between myotubes and between 
myoblasts and myotubes (Figure 4.3vii, viii). In fusing myoblasts there was a 
concentration of PERILS staining in vesicular structures at membrane fusion sites 
(Figure 4.4A), which was not observed at apposed myoblast-myotube membranes 
(Figure 4.4B) as has been reported for dysferlin and myoferlin (Klinge et al., 2007; 
Doherty et al., 200S). By co- immunolabelling differentiating C2C12 cultures with the 
respective antibodies to dysferlin and myoferlin the concenfration of dysferlin and 
myoferlin at apposed myoblast-myotube membrane fiision sites was demonstrated, 
where they also appeared to colocalizes (Figure 4.4C). 
4.2.2 The nuclear distribution of FER1L5 during C2C12 myoblast fusion 
The nuclear expression of PERILS during myoblast fusion was confirmed by Dr. 
Khalil Saleki in the laboratory by performing nuclear fractionation and western 
analysis of C2C12 whole nuclear exfracts generated from respective myoblast and 
myotube cultures. This work showed that nuclear PERILS levels modestly elevated in 
myotube cultures compared to myoblasts. The levels of nuclear myoferlin appeared to

be higher in rayotube cultures compared to myoblast cultures but what was 
noteworthy was that nuclear dysferlin levels were highly elevated in myotube cultures 
compared to myoblast cultures. To complement the western analysis, I performed 
immunofluorescence analysis of myotubes to examine the nuclear expression of 
FER1L5 (Figure 4.5). First, myotubes were stained with antibodies to the proteins, 
LAP2a and lamin A which have been localized to the nucleoskeleton and the nuclear 
lamina respectively (Cenciarelli et al, 1999; Markiewicz et al, 2005). The nuclear 
staining pattern of LAP2a and lamin A was compared with that obtained for PERILS. 
PERILS was present in aggregates in all myotube nuclei (Figure 4.5C). The staining 
pattern of PERILS was not consistent with that obtained for a nuclear lamina protein 
and the pattern also differed from that obtained for LAP2a (Figure 4.5A). The nuclear 
expression pattern of PERILS was also compared with proteins known to be present 
in subnuclear bodies. The only marker available to test was the subnuclear body 
protein, fibrillarin (van Koningsbruggen et al., 2004). Myotubes were stained with 
fibrillarin antibody alone to determine its expression pattern and then co-
immvmolabelling was performed with antibodies to coilin, another subnuclear body 
protein and a marker of Cajal bodies (Korie et al., 2006). The staining of fibrillarin 
and coilin in myotubes was consistent with that reported by others (van 
Koningsbruggen et al., 2004). Partial costaining of fibrillarin and coilin was observed 
in myotube nuclei (Figure 4.6A). When double staining with anti-fibrillarin antibody 
and PERILS antibody was performed there was some staining overlap of PERILS and 
fibrillarin within subnuclear domains (Figure 4.6B). This data suggested that PERILS 
was not localized to subnuclear domains containing fibrillarin in C2C12 myotubes. To 
examine the subnuclear distribution of PERILS fiirther C2C12 myotubes were treated 
with the drug actinomycin D, which is known to disrupt the integrity of subnuclear 
bodies (van Koningsbruggen et al., 2004). Proteins localizing to subnuclear bodies 
show a nucleoplasmic redistribution following actinomycin D treatment (van 
Koningsbruggen et al., 2004). C2C12 myotubes grown on coverslips were incubated 
with a range of actinomycin D concentrations (O.S, 1.0, S.O, 7.0 and lOp.g/ml) to 
determine the optimal concentration required for the redistribution of the subnuclear 
body protein, fibrillarin (Figure 4.7A). Pollowing incubation with actinomycin D (for 
3 hours at 37C), fixed cells were immunolabelled with antibodies to coilin and 
fibrillarin (Figure 4.7A). Prom these experiments the concentration of actinomycin D 
required to disrupt subnuclear body integrity was determined to be 10^lg/ml.

monoclonal anti-fibrillarin antibody (Figure 4.7B). In untreated myotubes, the nuclear 
staining of PERILS was in aggregates as previously described (Figure 4.7B). Upon 
exposure of actinomycin D, there was a redistribution of PERILS from the nuclear 
aggregates to a difftise distribution across the nucleoplasm of C2C12 myotubes 
(Figure 4.7B). Overall the data suggested that in C2C12 myotubes PERILS is 
localized to a fibrillarin-deficient region of subnuclear bodies that is sensitive to 
actinomycin D treatment. Interestingly, in addition to the nuclear redistribution of 
PERILS following actinomycin D treatment, in myotube cytoplasm, there were 
multiple irregular shaped cytoplasmic vacuoles free of PERILS staining detected as 
described previously (Figure 4.7C). 
4.2.3 Investigating whether FER1L5 is early muscle differentiation marker 
Myoferlin and dysferlin have been shown to have a role in muscle regeneration as 
described in the Introduction. The work in our group has shown that dysferlin, 
myoferiin and PERILS are present in the nucleus during myoblast fusion. In dysferlin 
null myoblasts, which show impaired formation of large myotubes the reduction of 
dysferlin correlates with a reduction in myogenin expression. This has highlighted that 
dysferlin may be involved in muscle regeneration through a myogenic signaling 
pathway (Luna et al., 2006). To explore whether PERILS, dysferlin and myoferlin are 
early myogenic markers, the C3H-ER-MyoD fibroblast cell line, which has been used 
to identify early markers of muscle differentiation (Cenciarelli et al, 1999) was used. 
C3H-ER-MyoD is a well characterized C3H10T1/2 cell Hne that stably expresses an 
estradiol-inducible MyoD protein (Cenciarelli et al., 1999). Myogenic differentiation 
is induced by culturing cells in differentiation medium (DM) containing estradiol 
(10|u,M) for increasing periods of time as shown in Cenciarelli et al., (1999). Por this 
study C3H-ER-MyoD cells were cultured in differentiation media containing 10p.M 
estradiol for Ohrs, 18hrs, 24hrs and 48hrs respectively and then cells were lysed for 
immunoblotting (Figure 4.8). Control cells were cultured in differentiation media 
containing no estradiol. Equal amount of protein lysates were loaded onto gels for 
western analysis and the expression of PERILS, dysferlin and myoferlin was 
examined. Cyclin D3 was expressed in hormone free differentiation media and in

media containing estradiol. In differentiation media containing estradiol the 
expression of cyclin D3 increased at 18h, 24h and 48h following serum withdrawal 
compared to hormone free media. This data is similar to that reported by Cenciarelli et 
al (1999) using this cell line. The same lysates showing increased cyclin D3 
expression when the cells were grown in differentiation media containing hormone 
were then examined for FER1L5, dysferlin and myoferlin expression respectively. For 
FER1L5, a slight increase in expression was observed at 18h following serum 
withdrawal, in lysates from cells culttired in hormone containing media compared to 
cells cultured in hormone free media. No differences in expression between the two 
groups of cultures were observed at 24h and 48h, following serum withdrawal. For 
dysferlin no differences in expression were observed in cultures grovra in hormone 
free differentiation media and media containing estradiol. No data was obtained for 
myoferlin. Overall the data obtained did not suggest that FER1L5 and dysferlin are 
early markers of muscle differentiation. The expression of FER1L5 in C3H-ER-MyoD 
estradiol treated and untreated cells grown in growth media (GM) and differentiation 
media was also examined by confocal microscopy. Estradiol treated and untreated 
cells were imaged at the same confocal settings following immunolabelling with 
FER1L5 and cyclin D3 antibodies, hi unfreated cells cultured in growth media, 
FER1L5 staining was observed in cytoplasmic vesicular structures and nuclear 
staining was also observed (Figure 4.9A). For cyclin D3 a speckled like staining 
pattern was detected in the nuclear regions consistent with published data (Cenciarelli 
et al., 1999) and also staining was observed in the cytoplasm in aggregates (Figure 
4.9A). The staining in the cytoplasmic aggregates for cyclin D3 suggested an artifact 
because no other published literatures mentioned so far for cyclin D3 staining in the 
cytoplasmic aggregates. However, there was co-staining of FER1L5 and cyclin D3 in 
some cytoplasmic aggregates was detected (Figure 4.9A). When cells were switched 
to differentiation media and examined at 24h following serum withdrawal, FER1L5 
staining was detected at the nuclear membrane and perinuclear region in small 
aggregates (Figure 4,9B). This staining pattern was more prominent in estradiol 
freated cells and there appeared to be a slight increase in FER1L5 staining in these 
cells. During myogenesis increased nuclear expression of cyclin D3 has been reported 
and shown to correlate with withdrawal of the cells from the cell cycle (Mariappan et 
al., 2005). These cells are myogenic cells. In estradiol untreated myogenic C3H-ER-
MyoD cells occasional co-staining of FER1L5 and cyclin D3 was

increased in media containing estradiol there was increased cytoplasmic staining and 
at the nuclear membrane. In cells grown in hormone free differentiation media all cells 
(mono and multi nucleated) showed increases in nuclear cyclin D3 expression Figure 
compared to earlier time points. The nuclear cyclin D3 expression was increased in 
estradiol treated multinucleated cells. Co-staining of FER1L5 and cyclin D3 in 
cytoplasmic aggregates was observed in untreated cells and there was also some 
nuclear co-staining. In estradiol treated cells there was extensive nuclear costaining of 
FER1L5 and cyclin D3. Overall the data obtained suggests that FER1L5 is not linked 
to MyoD activation. Collectively these studies indicate that FER1L5 is not a 
myogenic marker.

4.3 Discussion 
The expression profile of FER1L5 during C2C12 myoblast fusion appears to be 
different from that of dysferlin and myoferlin. FER1L5 is expressed at all stages of 
myoblast fusion and no increases in FER1L5 levels were observed in myotube 
cultures by western blotting as has been reported for dysferlin and myoferlin 
respectively and confirmed for dysferlin in this study (Davis et al, 2002; Foxton et 
al, 2004). However, a slight increase (20%-30%) in the FER1L5 expression levels 
was observed during early stages of myoblast fusion. To gain a better imderstanding 
of FER1L5 distribution during myoblast fusion immunofluorescence studies followed 
by confocal microscopy was performed. In myoblasts and myotubes FERl L5 staining 
was detected in vesicular structures in the cytoplasm. In myotubes, there was a 
characteristic nuclear staining of FERl L5 in aggregate like structures. In addition to 
the characteristic nuclear FER1L5 staining, cytoplasmic vacuoles ranging fi-om 2-
3^m, largely free of FER1L5 staining were detected. In some C2C12 myotubes 
intercellular FER1L5 stained connections emerging from the vacuolar regions and 
linking adjacently located myotubes were detected. Increased FER1L5 expression in 
vesicular structures was observed at the membrane fusion sites in fiising myoblasts. 
No concentration of FER1L5 stained vesicles was observed at apposed 
myoblast/myotube membranes and apposed myotube/myotube membranes 
respectively as has been reported for dysferlin and myoferlin (Luna et al., 2006; 
Doherty et al., 2005). This data suggests that FER1L5 may operate differentially to 
dysferlin and myoferlin during C2C12 myoblast fusion. The concentration of dysferlin 
and myoferlin in vesicular structures at myoblast/myotube fusion sites has led to the 
hjT?othesis that dysferlin and myoferlin vesicles are involved in the merging of 
apposed myoblast/myotube membranes. The concentration of FER1L5 at apposed 
myoblasts membranes indicates that this ferlin may operate in membrane fusion 
events at the early stages of the myoblast fusion. 
The subnuclear distribution of FERl L5 during C2C12 myoblast fiision was interesting 
and was confirmed by western analysis of whole nuclear extracts generated fi-om 
myoblasts and myotube cultures respectively. This work was performed by Dr. Khalil 
Saleki and demonstrated that nuclear levels of FER1L5 were modestly elevated in 
myotube cultures compared to myoblasts cultures but for myoferlin and especially 
dysferlin, their nuclear levels was highly elevated in myotube cultures compared to 
myoblasts. These findings prompted me to examine the nuclear distribution of 
FER1L5 by confocal microscopy by co-immunolabelling C2C12 myotubes using 
antibodies to protein residing at the nuclear lamina, nucleoskeleton and subnuclear 
bodies. FERl L5 was shown to have a subnuclear body distribution. Subnuclear bodies 
are present in all cells and are non-membrane structures consisting of nucleoli, Cajal 
bodies, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies and speckles (Handwerger et 
al, 2006). PML bodies have a diverse function ranging fi-om DNA repair, apoptosis, 
gene regulation and txmiour suppression (Dellaire et al., 2004). Cajal bodies, nucleoli 
and nuclear speckles are associated with transcription and splicing (Handwerger et al., 
2006). The subnuclear body distribution of FERl L5 was examined further by treating 
myotubes with the drug actinomycin D, which disrupts the integrity of subnuclear 
bodies by targeting the enzymes RNA polymerase I and I I (Sobell et al., 1985). 
Following actinomycin D treatment there was a nucleoplasmic redistribution of 
FER1L5 fi-om aggregates to a diffuse similar to that observed for fibrillarin, a 
nucleolar protein. These studies demonstrated that in C2C12 myotubes FER1L5 is 
localized to subnuclear bodies which are sensitive to actinomycin D. A partial co-
staining of FERlL5 and fibrillarin, a nucleolar protein was observed in myotubes. 
Since the nucleolus is the site for RNA biogenesis FER1L5 may have a role in RNA 
biogenesis but fiarther studies are required to confirm this because the co-
immunolabelling studies were limited due to the unavailability of monoclonal 
antibodies to other subnuclear markers. The role of myoferlin and dysferlin in muscle 
regeneration has been described in Chapter 1 (Doherty et al., 200S; Luna et al., 2006). 
It has been suggested that dysferlin may be involved in muscle regeneration through a 
myogenic signaling pathway since dysferlin null myoblasts show impaired formation 
of large myotubes and the reduction of dysferlin correlates with the reduction in 
myogenin expression (Luna et al, 2006). To explore whether FER1L5 is a myogenic 
marker the C3H-ER-MyoD fibroblast cell line (Micheli et al., 2004) was used and 
FER1L5 expression in estradiol treated and untreated cells was examined by a 
combination of western blotting and immunofluorescence. The western data showed 
that FER1L5 expression did not change in differentiating C3H-ER-MyoD cells 
cultured in hormone fi-ee and hormone containing media. The expression of cyclin D3, 
a known myogenic marker was increased following serum withdrawal in the hormone 
treated cells consistent with the published data (Micheli et al., 2004). The western data 
obtained for FER1L5 suggested that FER1L5 was not a myogenic marker and this was 
confirmed by co-immunolabelling of differentiating C3H-ER-MyoD cultures with 
cyclin D3 and FER1L5 antibodies. No significant differences were observed in the 
expression of FER1L5 in estradiol treated and untreated cells as compared to cyclin 
D3, following serum withdrawal. What was noteworthy was the partial co-staining of 
cyclin D3 and FER1L5 in the cytoplasm and the nuclear region of differentiating 
C3H-ER-MyoD. The significance of these findings is not known yet and will require 
fiirther studies. 
CHAPTER V: FER1L5 
MEDIATES IN MYOBLAST 
FUSION AND MUSCLE 
MEMBRANE REPAIR 
5.1 Introduction 
In this chapter the role of FER1L5 in myoblast fusion and membrane repair are 
described. To examine the role of FERl L5 in myoblast fusion and membrane repair, 
inhibition of FERlL5 in C2C12 cells by siRNAs was initiated but was shown to be 
ineffective in reducing FER1L5 protein levels. Several FER1L5 siRNA targets were 
tested alone and as a cocktail using different transfection methods but no protein 
knockdown of FER1L5 was observed (Appendix C). Against this background I 
developed an alternative approach to inhibiting FER1L5 fimction, by loading C2C12 
cells with FER1L5 antibody using the Amaxa nucleofector system. This adapted 
antibody loading technique is described in this chapter and then its application in 
C2C12 cells to examine the role of FERl L5 in myoblast fusion and membrane repair. 
Microinjection (Kreis et al., 1979; Kreis et a/., 1982; Rose et al., 2007) and scrape 
loading (McNeil et al., 1984; McNeil et al., 1987) are two approaches that have been 
used to load cells with inhibitory antibodies for functional studies. Scrape loading is a 
simpler technique and although ensuring highly efficient delivery of antibody in large 
cell numbers it can often result with loss of cell viability resulting in high mortality 
rates (McNeil et al., 2006). In our laboratory we tested an alternative method, the 
Amaxa nucleofector system to load large cell numbers with FER1L5 antibody. 
5.2 Results 
5.2.1 Loading cells with large molecules using nucleofection 
Electroporation is generally used for delivery of nucleic acids into mammalian cells. 
The electroporation conditions for C2C12 cells using Amaxa nucleofection system are 
known. The optimal electroporation conditions recommended by Amaxa for delivery 
of nuclei acids into C2C12 cells were employed to test the delivery of a GFP plasmid 
and a membrane impermeant fluorescent dextran suspended in rabbit serum (replacing 
the nucleofactor buffer) was investigated (Figure 5.1 A). 24 hours after transfection 
50% of the cells were shown to be positive for the GFP plasmid and fluorescent 
dextran (10,000 kDa) respectively (Figure 5.1 A). The electroporation conditions 
used for the successful entry of GFP plasmid and fluorescent dextran were then 
applied to C2C12 cells resuspended in PERILS antiserum, peptide blocked FER1L5

antiserum and preimmune serum respectively. The FER1L5 antiserum, peptide 
blocked FER1L5 antiserum and preimmune serum were tested for their 
immimoreactivity by immimoblotting prior to electroporation. This was performed by 
Dr. Khalil Saleki and the data was as shown in Figure 3.1A. The successfiil entry of 
FER1L5 inhibitory antiserum into the C2C12 cells were also analysed after 
elecb-oporation by confocal microscopy. Equal cell densities of C2C12 cells loaded 
with FER1L5 antiserum, peptide blocked FER1L5 antiserum and preimmune serum 
respectively were fixed after 24 hours of electroporation. These cells were then 
permeabilized and stained with Alexa 546 secondary antibody and mounted in 
Mowiol containing DAPI. The percentage knockdown of the FER1L5 antiserum in the 
C2C12 cells loaded with FERIL5 inhibitory antiserum were obtained by counting the 
cells showing specific staining on the coverslips with respect to the total number of 
nuclei viewed in 20 randomly chosen areas (Figure 5.1B). Mean percentage was 
obtained for these chosen areas and showed 60% knockdown in the FER1L5 
inhibitory antiserum loaded coverslips. Cells loaded with peptide-blocked FER1L5 
anti-serum showed no staining as shown in Figure 5.1B. No specific staining pattern 
was obtained for preimmime serum (data not shown). Using this approach the role of 
FER1L5 in myoblast fiision and membrane repair was examined in C2C12 myoblasts. 
5.2.2 Inhibition of F E R l L 5 impairs formation of large mvotubes 
C2C12 cells were loaded with FER1L5 antiserum, peptide blocked FER1L5 antiserum 
and preimmune serum respectively. Following electroporation the three groups of 
cultures of equal cell densities were grown on coverslips and allowed to differentiate 
ti l l day 9. During this time no differences in the proliferation rate was observed 
between the cultures (data not shown). At day 9 cells were fixed and stained with anti-
desmin antibody and mounted in Mowiol containing DAPI. Desmin staining was used 
to identify myogenic myoblasts (Doherty et al., 2005) and the fusion index of the 
three groups of cultures was determined by qucintifying the number of desmin positive 
myoblasts, myotubes containing two or three nuclei and myotubes containing four or 
more nuclei. Upon examination the cultures loaded with FER1L5 anti-serum showed 
significantly higher number of desmin positive myoblasts and small myotubes 
containing 2 or 3 nuclei compared to cultures loaded with preimmune serum and

determined by quantifying the number of singly nucleated desmin-positive cells, 
myotubes containing two or three nuclei, and those containing four or more nuclei. 
The number of nuclei counted in preimmune serum, peptide blocked FER1L5

respectively. Forty fields at 40x magnification on the coverslips for each of the

cultures was determined by calculating the mean percentage o f desmin positive nuclei 
in myoblasts and myotubes in respect to the total number o f nuclei viewed in 40 
randomly chosen areas on the coverslips. The fiision index was calculated fi-om three 
independent experiments. The fusion index o f FER1L5 antiserum loaded cultures 
(37.2%) was significantly lower than that obtained for preimmune serum loaded 
(69.6%; P=lxlO"^) and peptide blocked PERILS antiserum loaded (67.4%; P=2xl0'^) 
cultures respectively (Figure 5.2B; Table 5.1A). The results indicated that C2C12 
cells loaded with PERILS antibody are impaired in the formation o f multinucleated 
myotubes. 
In addition to quantifying the number o f desmin positive nuclei in the 40 randomly 
chosen areas on the coverslips of the three groups o f cultures I also quantified the 
number o f the cytoplasmic vacuolar like structures present in myotubes on the same 
coverslips. In myotubes formed in cultures loaded with PERILS antiserum there were 
a significantly less number o f the cytoplasmic vacuolar like structures compared to 
myotubes formed in the cultures loaded with preimmune serum and peptide blocked 
PERILS antiserum (see Table 5.1B). These results suggested that inhibition o f 
PERILS in C2C12 cells restricts the formation o f the cytoplasmic vacuolar like 
structures in myotubes. The effectiveness o f nucleofection for antibody loading o f 
large cell numbers was confirmed by measming the myogenic fusion index o f 
electroporated C2C12 myoblasts loaded wi th characterized myoferlin monoclonal 
antibody (Jaiswal et al, 2007) (Figure 5.2B) and compared the results with myoferlin 
deficient cells generated by stable transfection o f myoferlin siRNA (Figure 5.2C). 
Short interfering R N A (siRNA) is often used in functional gene studies and in the 
validation o f novel drug targets. Impaired fiision o f myoferlin null myoblasts 
generated from the myoferlin knockout mouse has previously been demonstrated 
(Doherty et al., 2005). C2C12 myoblasts loaded with myoferUn monoclonal antibody 
show an impaired myogenic fusion index (Figure 5.2Bii) similar to that observed for 
myoferlin deficient cells generated by stable transfection o f myoferlin siRNA (Figure 
5.2Cii). Morphological changes were also observed in all the antibody loaded cells. 
The cells were more like spread out, thickened and flattened shape compared to the 
control cells. 
As an extra control, C2C12 cultures were also loaded with an antibody to a non-
muscle protein. The antibody used was raised to N M D A R l , which is a characterized 
protein found only in brain (Chazot et al, 1995). Cultures were loaded with 
N M D A R l antiserum, peptide blocked N M D A R l antiserum and preimmune serum as 
described for FER1L5. The fusion index was determined as described for FER1L5. 
No differences were observed between the fusion index o f an t i -NMDARl serum 
loaded cultures (70.1%), preimmune serum loaded (70.0%; P=1.8xlO'') and peptide 
blocked N M D A R l antiserum loaded (70.3%; P=4.9xl0' ' ) cultures (Figure 5.2D). 
These results showed that the control antibody has no effect on the formation o f 
myotubes highlighting the specific inhibitory function o f the FER1L5 antibody. The 
fusion index data obtained for PERILS antiserum and N M D A R l antiserum loaded 
cultures is summarized in Table 5.1A. 
5.2.3 Defective muscle membrane repair foUowm2 inhibition of F E R 1 L 5 
The most common and accurate membrane repair assay used to examine the role o f 
dysferlin in membrane repair is the multiphoton laser woimding assay. This assay 
measures the fluorescence o f the membrane impermeant dye FM-143 following 
wovinding o f membranes by irradiation. Identical wounds can be created using a 
multiphoton confocal microscope. F M l - 4 3 fluoresces when it binds membranes and 
in this assay in wounded cells F M l - 4 3 binds to membranes resulting in an increase in 
its fluorescence, which stops increasing once the injured membrane is repaired 
impeding dye entry in the presence o f calcium. The rate o f FM-143 fluorescence 
influx is a measiire o f membrane repair fol lowing laser wounding. Laser wounding 
assays were performed in collaboration wi th Isabelle Richard at Genethon, on wi ld 
type C2C12 cells and C2C12 cells loaded with PERILS antiserum, peptide blocked 
PERILS antiserum and preimmune serum respectively. The wounding assays were 
performed by Will iams Lostal. Membrane injury was induced by multiphoton laser 
irradiation in the presence o f the dye FM-143 and the fluorescence o f this dye near the 
disruption site was measured at 7s intervals over a 7Ss time course following 
membrane injury. W i l d type C2C12 cells injured in the presence o f Ca""*" resealed the

5.3 Discussion 
In muscle there are two important membrane fusion events: myoblast fusion which 
occurs during muscle development (myogenesis) and following the regeneration phase 
after injury and the repair o f muscle cell membrane tears occurring during muscle 
contraction (Horsley and Pavlath, 2004; Taylor, 2003; Abmayr et al., 2003; Bansal 
and Campbell, 2004; Doherty and McNally, 2003). During myoblast fusion 
proliferating mononucleated myoblasts irreversibly exit fi-om the cell cycle and fiise to 
form multinucleated muscle fibers at sites o f muscle development (Horsley and 
Pavlath, 2004; Taylor, 2003; Abmayr et al., 2003). In mammals myogenesis occurs in 
two well-characterized phases termed primary and secondary myogenesis (Ontell et 
al., 1988). In the first phase primary fibres with several nuclei (myotube) are formed 
by the fusion o f mononucleated myoblast-myoblast t i l l the first few days o f l i fe 
followed by the secondary phase when muscle is developed through hypertrophy o f 
the existing fibres. Myoblast fusion also occurs during adulthood fol lowing muscle 
injury whereupon satellite cells proliferate and fiise either with existing myotubes in 
injured muscle or they form de novo myotubes (Kelly, 1996; Pena et al., 1995). Many 
o f the mechanisms involved in myoblast fusion have been delineated in Drosophila 
because o f its rapidly developing and simple musculature (Taylor, 2003; Abmayr et 
al., 2003; Chen and Olsen, 2004). In Drosophila myoblast fiision founder myoblasts 
acts as seeds to attract, adhere and fiase to fusion-competent myoblasts (ferns). 
Following cell alignment and adhesion the apposing plasma membranes coalesce, 
allowing fiision. Multinucleated myotubes are then formed by successive rovinds o f 
fiision (Taylor, 2003; Abmayr et al., 2003; Chen and Olsen, 2004). Through the 
analysis o f the Drosophila mutants several proteins involved in myoblast fusion have 
been characterised including Dumbfounded (Duf/Kin) , Sticks and stones (Sns), 
Blownfuse (Blow), myoblast city (Mbc), rolling pebbles/antisocial (Rols7) and Loner 
[Taylor, 2003; Abmayr et al, 2003; Chen and Olsen, 2004). Dumbfounded and rolling 
pebbles are involved in the attraction and adhesion steps, blownfuse and the other 
proteins have a role in the fusion process since mutations in the corresponding genes 
produces mutants with severe fusion defects producing b i - or trinucleated muscle 
cells. Several o f the fiision relevant proteins are involved in mediating actin dynamics 
such as Loner, the small GTPases Dracl and Drac2 highlighting the role o f the actin 
cytoskeleton in Drosophila myoblast fusion (Taylor, 2003; Abmayr et al., 2003; Chen 
and Olsen, 2004). In vertebrates there is no evidence for the presence o f founder and 
fusion competent cells and some mammalian orthologs o f many of the above proteins 
do not have similar fianctions (Kestila et al, 1998) whilst for others such as Myoblast 
city and Racl vertebrate homologs have been identified (Lu et al., 2005; Charasse et 
al., 2007). In vitro studies and analysis o f primary myoblasts derived fi^om mouse 
knockout models have identified several gene products that are essential for 
mammalian myoblast fusion (Appendix D) (Richardson et al., 2008). Several 
membrane proteins however have been implicated in vertebrate myoblast fusion 
including A D A M I 2, NFACT2, caveolin-3, calpain 3, integrins, tetraspanins, dysferlin 
and myoferlin but their molecular mechanisms in myoblast fusion are not f i i l ly 
understood (Horsley and Pavlath, 2004; Charasse et al., 2007; Luna et al., 2006). 
Disruption of these gene products impairs or blocks myoblast-myoblast fusion process 
(Richardson et al., 2008). 
Since recent studies have demonstrated the role o f dysferlin and myoferlin in the 
fusion o f myoblasts wi th existing myofibers during mammalian muscle development 
and regeneration the role o f FER1L5 was also analysed during myoblast fusion and 
membrane repair. 
In this study, an alternative approach to inhibit FER1L5 protein function, by antibody 
loading was adopted because transfection o f PERILS siRNAs was shown to be 
ineffective in reducing PERILS protein expression. Pive different PERILS siRNAs 
used independently and as a cocktail were tested and despite the optimization o f the 
electroporation protocol for C2C12 myoblasts using G3PDH siRNAs no PERILS 
protein knockdown was observed. Therefore the nucleofection protocol was modified 
and used to inhibit PERILS protein in C2C12 myoblasts. Using this approach the role 
o f PERILS in myoblast fusion and membrane repair was demonstrated. The data 
obtained fi-om the fusion index assays and the laser wounding membrane repair assay 
suggests that PERILS has a role in muscle membrane fiision. M y results demonstrate 
that inhibition o f PERILS results in a significantly reduced myogenic index. 
Inhibition o f PERILS was shown to impair the formation o f multinucleated myotubes 
similar to what has been reported for dysferlin null and myoferlin null myoblasts 
(Luna et al., 2006; Doherty et al., 2005). The effectiveness o f nucleofection was also 
demonstrated by showing that C2C12 myoblasts loaded with myoferlin monoclonal 
antibody show an impaired myogenic fusion index similar to that observed for 
myoferlin deficient cells generated by stable transfection o f myoferlin siRNA. These 
results are consistent wi th those reported for myoferlin null myoblasts generated from 
the myoferlin knockout mouse highlighting the effectiveness o f nucleofection for 
inhibiting PERILS protein function by antibody loading. These results strengthen our 
fiinctional data on PERILS and show that PERILS is involved in myoblast fiision and 
the inhibition o f PERILS fiinction leads to defective myoblast fusion thereby reduced 
myogenic index was observed. In the cultures loaded with PERILS antiserum, in 
which the formation o f multinucleated myotubes was disrupted there were a 
significantly higher number o f desmin positive myoblasts (myogenic myoblasts). 
Changes in the cell morphology were also seen in the antibody transfected cells than 
control cells. The cells appear to be more thickened, flattened and tapering at both 
ends suggesting that this could be due to a disruption in the cytoskeletal architecture 
possibly reorganization o f the desmin cytoskeleton. In the previous chapter FERl LS 
was shown to concentrate at apposed myoblasf'myoblast membrane ftision sites but 
not at apposed myotube/myoblast fiision sites, like dysferlin and myoferlin (Luna et 
al., 2006; Doherty et al., 2005). The fusion index data and these observations suggest 
that PERILS may function differentially to dysferlin and myoferlin in the merging o f 
myoblast/myoblast membranes and not myoblast/myotube membranes as proposed for 
dysferlin and myoferlin (Doherty et al., 2005; Klinge et al., 2007). 
In chapter IV , I have shown that in C2C12 myotubes cytoplasmic vacuoles not stained 
for PERILS were present and from some o f these vacuoles intercellular cormections 
linking neighbouring myotubes and staining for PERILS were observed. Pollowing 
inhibition o f PERILS the number o f the cytoplasmic vacuoles detected in the 
myotubes from the cultures loaded with PERILS antiserum was reduced. The 
significance o f these findings are not clear at present but the vacuolar regions 
represent sites o f membrane remodeling (see next chapter) and their reduced 
formation fol lowing inhibition o f PERILS may reflect a disruption o f their process. 
Inhibition o f PERILS also leads to defective membrane resealing as shovm using laser 
wounding assays. Membrane repair in mammalian cells is proposed to occur by 
'patch' hypothesis, which involves Ca"^ entry into the cell through the wound site. 
Entry o f calcium is thought to result in accumulation o f a large population o f vesicles 
underneath the membrane injury site, which undergo vesicle-vesicle fusion. This 
eventually creates the formation of a new 'patch' membrane, which is added to the 
wound site by exocytosis (McNei l et al, 2003; McNeil et al., 2005). Although 
lysosomes have been considered to be the primary endomembrane source o f 
membrane repair vesicles in some mammalian cells (Reddy et al., 2001; McNei l et al., 
2005) dysferlin vesicles are thought to be the sarcolemmal repair vesicles. The origin 
and the identity o f dysferlin vesicles is not known but dysferlin is considered to be the 
emergency fusogen involved in the formation o f the patch membrane (Han et al., 
2007; McNei l et al., 2005) because ultrastnictural studies show accumulation o f 
vesicles at disrupted membrane sites in dysferlin deficient muscle and dysferlin null 
muscle fibres fai l to reseal their damaged membranes resulting in a dystrophic 
phenotype (Bansal et al, 2003; Selcen et al., 2001; Cenacchi et al., 2005). Several 
studies have begun to identify other proteins involved with dysferlin in membrane 
repair, which include A H N A K (Benaud et al., 2004), caveolin-3 (Hernandez et al., 
2007), annexin ( A l and A2) (McNeil et al, 2005; Lennon et al., 2003), af f ix in 
(Matsuda et al., 2005), calpain 3 (Huang et al., 2005) and the recenfly discovered 
MG53 (Cai et al., 2009^). A recent study has highHghted the functional interaction 
between MG53 and caveolin 3 to regulate the trafficking o f dysferlin to the injury 
sites o f muscle membranes (Cai et al., 2009"^). MGS3-/- mice showed impaired 
membrane resealing following membrane damage and the mice also develop a mi ld 
muscular dystrophy (Cai et al., 2009^^). Our results indicate that in C2C12 myoblasts, 
PERILS may also have a role in the emergency membrane repair response given the 
molecular similarities of dysferlin and PERILS, the similar properties o f their vesicles 
and their role in membrane repair. Based on these results PERILS may compensate 
for the loss o f dysferlin in muscular dystrophy. Further studies are required to 
demonstrate i f PERILS is a component o f the muscle membrane repair machinery. 
Currenfly the expression o f PERILS in dysferlin deficient muscle is being examined 
to determine i f PERILS expression is upregulated in the absence o f dysferlin. 
CHAPTER VI: C2C12 MYOTUBES 
ARE ACTIVE IN MEMBRANE 
SHEDDING 
6.1 Introduction 
Many signalling molecules and proteins are known to undergo extracellular release 
from cells and this occurs through different mechanisms including regulated vesicular 
exocytosis membrane shedding, transcytosis and ectocytosis (Moss and Lambert, 
2002) . Many cell types have been shown to display membrane shedding, transcytosis 
and ectocytosis, which involve the release o f vesicles termed ectosomes or exosomes. 
Exosomes are vesicles o f 50-90nm in diameter contained in multivesicular bodies 
(MVBs), which are intracellular organelles (200nm in size) derived from the 
endosomal system. Exosomes are released extracellularly by exocytosis following 
fusion of the M V B with the plasma membrane (Piper and Katzmann, 2007; Fevrier 
and Raposo, 2004; Thery et al, 2002). Exosomes have been extensively studied in 
immune cells where they function in stimulatory responses but they are thought to 
have a wider physiological role in intercellular signaling and communication (Piper 
and Katzmann, 2007; Fevrier and Raposo, 2004; Thery et al, 2002; Greco et ai, 
2003) . The shed vesicles are thought to play a role in coagulation, inflammation and 
tumor progression (Piper and Katzmann, 2007; Cocucci et al., 2009). Besides 
exosomes many cells can release vesicles by direct outward budding o f the plasma 
membrane by a process known as ectocytosis (reviewed in Pilzer et al., 2005; Gasser 
and Schifferli, 2008; Moskovich and Fishelson, 2007). Vesicles from platelets and 
monocytes shed by this process have been designated ectosomes or microparticles 
(Pilzer et al., 2005). 
h i chapter 5 fol lowing immunostaining o f C2C12 myotubes wi th affini ty purified 
FER1L5 antibody, cytoplasmic vacuolar regions largely devoid o f FERl L5 staining 
were detected, (see Figure 4.3 in Chapter IV) . The size o f the vacuoles detected 
ranged from 2-3 \im and were present as single or multiple units. From some of the 
vacuolar regions intracellular connections were observed linking adjacently located 
myotubes. These connections were stained for FER1L5. In this chapter further details 
are given on how these vacuolar regions are formed. 
6.2 Results 
6.2.1 The F E R 1 L 5 free vacuolar regions detected in C2C12 myotubes are sites 
of membrane shedding 
C2C12 myotubes were stained wi th PERILS antibody and confocal imaging was 
performed. By performing extensive confocal Z-series imaging to examine PERILS 
stained myotubes I observed the shedding o f PERILS stained ball shaped structures, 
which were released extracellularly firom C2C12 myotubes (as shown i n Figure 6.1 A ) . 
The Z-series images as shown in Figure 6.1 Ai show that the site in the C2C12 
myotubes firom which the ball shaped structure begins to appear vacuolar and 
displaying less PERILS staining (Figure 6.1 A, see middle row of complete Z -
series). Punctate PERILS staining was observed in the shed ball shaped structure and 
through the shedding o f the structure a connection was formed with the neighboring 
myotube leading to a closer aligiunent o f the myotubes (Figure 6.1A, Top row of Z -
series; Figure 6.1Aii). Shedding process can be viewed in Movie 6.1. Further 
confocal imaging o f PERILS labelled C2C12 myotubes was performed and this 
demonstrated that the ball shaped structures containing PERILS were shed by 
outward budding o f the myotube membrane (Figure 6.1B). The punctate staining o f 
PERILS in the shed ball shaped structures suggested that PERILS was present in 
vesicles. To determine whether PERILS was released extracellularly in vesicular 
structures differentiation media was collected at different time points during C2C12 
myoblast differentiation (DO to D l l ) and the media firom several culture dishes 
(representing the same time point) was pooled and subjected to ultracentrifiigation. 
The 'precipitated' material was tested for PERILS immunoreactivity by western 
blotting (Figure 6.2). Western analysis displayed no immunoreactivity for PERILS in 
the precipitated material fi-om supematants collected at different stages o f myoblast 
differentiation even at day 11 post serum withdrawal when the culture dishes were 
abundant in myotubes (Figure 6.2), This suggested that PERILS vesicles were not 
released directly i n the culture medium. 
6.2.2 Concentration of cytoskeletal and membrane proteins at sites of 
membrane shedding in C2C12 mvotubes 
The confocal data described above suggested that the vacuolar regions detected in 
myotubes represented sites o f membrane shedding from C2C12 myotubes. Since such

immunolabeled with affinity purified FER1L5 antibody. The images show the 
extracellular release from a myotube of a ball shaped structure showing punctate 
FER1L5 staining (highlighted by arrows in Ai). The region in the myotube from which 
the ball shaped structure is shed is beginning to appear vacuolar (top regions of the 
myotube) with less PERILS staining (indicated by asterisk in Ai). The shed structure

Bottom o f the myotubes 
Top o f the

regions had not been described previously C2C12 myotubes were immunolabelled 
with characterized antibodies to cytoskeletal proteins (actin, 6-tubulin) and membrane 
associated proteins (6-dystroglycan, caveolin-3, dysferlin and myoferlin) to determine 
i f the vacuolar regions could be detected with these antibodies. Before labelling the 
myotubes the staining specificity o f all o f the antibodies was ascertained by 
immunolabeling o f C2C12 myoblasts (except for dysferlin, which does not display 
high expression in C2C12 myoblasts) (Figure 6.3A). For dysferlin the staining pattern 
obtained in myotubes was consistent with published data (Doherty et al, 2005). 
Following immunolabeling o f myotubes with the different antibodies confocal 
imaging was used to show that vacuolar regions could be detected in C2C12 myotubes 
as described following staining o f myotubes with the FER1L5 antibody. Staining o f 
actin (detected both by anti-actin antibody and phalloidin stain), 6-tubulin, 6-
dystroglycan, dysferlin and caveolin-3 respectively was concentrated at the r im of the 
vacuolar regions (Figure 6.3B). For myoferlin a strong punctate staining was 
observed at regions surrounding the vacuolar regions (Figure 6.3B). Like FER1L5, all 
o f the proteins examined were largely absent from the centre o f the vacuolar regions. 
This data confirmed that vacuolar regions are formed in C2C12 myotubes. 
6.2.3 Enhanced membrane sliedding from C2C12 myotubes bv cholesterol 
depletion 
Since the cytoplasmic vacuolar regions were thought to represent sites o f membrane 
shedding in C2C12 myotubes it was hypothesized that the formation o f the vacuolar 
regions could be enhanced by cholesterol depletion using the drug methyl-6-
cyclodextrin (MCD). Several publications have reported enhanced vesicle shedding in 
mammalian cells following cholesterol depletion using the drug M C D . M C D is known 
to stimulate the extracellular release o f vesicles from immune and cancer cells 
(Gutwein et al., 2003; von Tresckow et al., 2004). C2C12 myotubes treated with 
M C D (2mM) for 30, 45 and 75 minutes respectively were fixed and then 
immimolabelled with FER1L5 antibody. Following M C D freatment FER1L5 showed 
less pimctate and more aggregate like staining that was uniformly distributed 
throughout the cytoplasm of myotubes. Multiple r ing shaped and irregular shaped 
cytoplasmic vacuolar regions were detected in the M C D treated myotubes and these 
regions appeared closely dispersed (Figure 6.4i-ii). FER1L5 stained ball shaped 
Figure 6.2. Western blot showing no immunoreactivity for FER1L5 in the precipitates 
from supernatants collected at different time points during myoblast differentiation 
even at day 11 following serum withdrawal, when the dishes were full of myotubes. 
'D' refers to time in days following serum withdrawal. As a positive control 
homogenate (HG) obtained from C2C12 myoblast lysate was used and showed strong 
PERILS immunoreactivity. Growth (GM) and differentiation media (DM) were used 
as negative controls and displayed no immunoreactivity to FER1L5. 
Figure 6.3. Detection of vacuolar regions in C2C12 myotubes. A) Immunolabelling

stain was also used to label actin filaments. Scale bar, lOfim. B) C2C12 myotubes 
were stained with rhodamine phalloidin or labelled with antibodies to actin, f-tubulin, 
fi-dystroglycan, dysferlin, myoferlin and caveolin-3 respectively. Confocal analysis 
revealed the presence of cytoplasmic vacuolar regions, which were shown not to be 
nuclei by imaging the DAPI staining. In the images the DAPI staining has been 
merged. In myotubes, filamentous actin, fi-tubulin, fi -dystroglycan, caveolin-3 and 
dysferlin were concentrated at the rim of the vacuolar regions and myoferlin was 
concentrated at the regions surrounding the vacuole. The center of the vacuolar 
region was free of staining for all of the proteins examined.

The FER1L5 staining was less punctate in the shed structure following M C D

6.2.4 Ball shaped structures resembling M V B are shed from C2C12 mvotubes 
Complimenting the above studies time lapse video microscopy o f l iving C2C12 
myotubes was performed to further investigate membrane shedding from C2C12 
myotubes. Living C2C12 myotubes were incubated with 2mM M C D for varying times 
up to 45 minutes and cells were imaged at 5 second intervals. The captured images 
show many ball shaped structures being shed from C2C12 myotubes (see Movie 6.2). 
The formation o f bal l shaped structures by outward budding from M C D freated 
myotube membranes was observed (Figure 6.5B). In the M C D freated myotubes 
multiple vacuolar regions were present (Figure 6.5B, 6.5C). 
To examine the membrane shedding fiirther l iving C2C12 myotubes were first 
labelled with the l ipid raft stain Vybrant Alexa 488 labelled cholera toxin B subimit 
and then treated wi th M C D . Live cell imaging was performed on the M C D freated 
fluorescently labelled myotubes. Figure 6.6A shows the shedding o f a ball shaped 
structure and the vacuolar region formed at the site in the myotube from which the 
ball shaped structure is shed. For visualization o f the membrane shedding events 
stimulated by M C D treatment see Movie 6.3. The ball shaped structure released 
extracellularly appears membrane bound and containing vesicular like structures 
(Figure 6.6A, frames taken at 257s and 264s), resembling a multivesicular body 
(Piper and Katzmann et al., 2007). Time lapse images taken at 513s and 536s show 
that the shed ball shaped structure are connected to the myotube from which it is shed 
(Figure 6.6A). To confirm the presence o f FER1L5 vesicles in in the membrane 
structures that were shed from myotubes co-immunolabelling o f fixed M C D freated 
C2C12 myotubes was performed w i t h aff ini ty purified FER1L5 antibody cind the 
fluorescently labelled l ipid raft stain. Following confocal imaging many areas on the 
coverslips showed myotubes engaged in membrane shedding as highlighted in Figure 
6.6B, which shows FER1L5 stained vesicles in a ball shaped structure, which is in the 
process o f being shed. This structure is also stained for the l ipid raft dye. No co-
labelling o f FER1L5 and the l ipid raft stain was observed in the outward budding

structure. Fixed M C D treated myotubes were also stained for caveolin 3 and 6-
dystroglycan to show that the ball shaped structures shedding from C2C12 myotubes 
were membrane bound (Figure 6.6C). Caveolin-3 staining was detected at the surface 
as well as in die lumen o f the outward budding ball shaped structure preparing for 
expulsion (Figure 6.6Cii and iii). B-dystroglycan staining was detected 
predominantly at the surface o f the budding structures (Figure 6.6Cii and iii). Taken 
together the data provided evidence that ball shaped structures are shed from C2C12 
myotube membranes and that the shed structure resembles M V B and contain FER1L5 
possibly in vesicular structures. Fixed M C D treated myotubes were also 
immunolabelled with dysferlin and myoferlin antibodies to determine i f these proteins 
were also present in shed ball shaped structiu-es. Figure 6.7A shows images taken 
following confocal imaging o f fixed M C D treated C2C12 myotubes stained for 
dysferlin and myoferlin respectively. Both dysferlin and myoferlin were shown to be 
present in the ball shaped structures, which were either at the budding stage or 
released exfracellularly. Punctate staining was detected for both dysferlin and 
myoferlin indicating that these proteins were most l ikely present in vesicles. Figure 
6.7B describes ftirther images showing budding structures formed in C2C12 myotube, 
which stain for dysferlin and myoferl in respectively. 
Membrane shedding from C2C12 myotubes was confirmed by ultrastructural studies, 
which were performed by Daniella Emokpare, a student in the laboratory under my 
supervision. Control and M C D treated myotubes were analyzed by Scanning Electron 
Microscope (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and some of the 
images are shown in Figure 6.8. The images show ball shaped structures formed on 
the surface o f control and M C D treated myotubes. The images also highlight different 
stages o f the membrane shedding, some structures are being expelled from myotubes 
whilst other stuctures are still attached to the myotube as budding intermediates 
(Figure 6.8A). Additionally, the images also highlight the differences o f the 
membrane surface o f M C D treated and confrol myotubes. In untreated myotubes 
many finger like membrane extensions are visible projecting outwardly from the 
myotube surface (Figure 6.8A). E M images o f confrol myotubes show ball shaped 
structures ready for extracellular release but attached to the myotube membrane via 
filamentous membrane like connections (Figure 6.8A). Following cholesterol

and myoferlin are present in ball shaped structures being released from C2C12

depletion, the surface of the myotube appears modified. The siirface of MCD treated 
myotubes is smoother compared to untreated myotubes. Interestingly, secondary 
budding structures formed fi-om primary buds were detected in MCD treated 
myotubes. Following MCD exposure no finger like projections were detected on 
myotubes, which had a smooth surface appearance (Figure 6.8A). TEM analysis of 
MCD treated myotubes revealed that the ball shaped structures contain small vesicles 
(indicated by arrows) (Figure 6.8B). The size of these structures range fi-om SOOnm to 
2 microns and the structures appear to contain small vesicles (Figure 6.8B). The size 
of these structures and the vesicles present in these structures are similar to those that 
reported for MVBs containing small vesicles, exosomes in other systems. MVBs of 
150-200nm to 2[im and the consequent release of 40-90nm vesicles (exosomes), have 
been described for various cell types, including reticulocytes (Johnstone et al., 1987 
Vidal and Stahl, 1993; Rieu et al, 2000), B- and T-lymphocytes (Raposo et al., 1996 
Escola et al. 1998; Peters et al., 1989), dendritic cells (Zitvogel et al., 1998 
Kleijmeer et al., 1998), mast cells (Raposo et al., 1997), platelets (Heijnen et al., 
1999), macrophages and alveolar lung cells (Denzer et al., 2000). Exosome-Like 
Vesicles found in epididymal Fluid and the seminal plasma are between 25- and 75-
nm diameter (Gatti et al., 2005). 
In Yeast, (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) ~200-mn diameter of MVBs were shown to 
contain ~25nm diameter intraluminal vesicles (Hurley, 2008). Giant multivesicular 
bodies (MVBs) with diameters up to 4.5fim were shovm in the rat hippocampal 
pyramidal cells after chronic alcohol consumption compared to normal cells (0.2 - 0.5 
\im) and 2^m diameter in vaginal epithelium and rat satellate cells (Paula-Barbosa et 
al., 1986). Recent studies have well documented the structure and size of MVBs in 
nerve rootlet and axons and the structure was shown to be relatively spherical or oval, 
but not tubular (Amy, et al, 2009). They are briefly categorized into five different 
types; Type 1, 50-200-nm diameter, single limiting membrane, small (~30-nm 
diameter) internal vesicles; type 2, 70-200 nm diameter, single limiting membrane 
enclosing small internal vesicles, central empty space; type 3, classic MVB, generally 
>250 nm in diameter, single limiting membrane, multiple internal vesicles (~50-80 
nm diameter); t}'pe 4,: similar to type 3, but noticeably more electi-on dense; and type 
5, generally >250-nm diameter, outer limiting membrane less distinct, very' electron 
dense, internal vesicles less distinct (Amy, el al.. 2009). .Amy, et al, (2009) also 
reported that the quantity of the types 1 and 2 MVB-like organelles increased by 2-
fold, whereas type 5 MVBs increased by 7-fold in dystrophic conditions. 
In muscle cells, the mechanism of exocytosis is well established for glucose 
transporter protein GLUT4 (Costin et al, 2009). GLUT4 is a member of the SLC2 
(solute carrier 2) transporter family of facilitated hexose transporters and is selectively 
expressed in muscle and fat cells (He et al, 2000). Extensive study for nearly 30 years 
of the traffic of GLUT4 in these two cell types has revealed that the transporter is a 
constitutively recycling membrane protein, and defects in its cycling are associated 
with insulin resistance (Thong et ai, 2005; Zaid et al., 2008). Such cycling consists of 
exocytic movement of the transporter within postbiosynthetic vesicles of endosomal 
origin towards the plasma membrane, and of endocytic movement from the membrane 
back to the sorting endosoraal system. Glucose uptake into skeletal muscle fibres 
occurs primarily through the glucose transporter GLUT4 in response to insulin 
stimulation (Zisman et al., 2000). hi muscle cells, glucose is readily used to produce 
energy and is also stored as glycogen, a secondary short term energy source. 
Investigations of many signaling molecules have implicated a range of different 
signaling pathways involved in regulating GLUT4 translocation to PM in response to 
insulin and non-insulin factors (Costin et al., 2009; He et al., 2000). Different types of 
cells perform similar signaling steps in response to changes in the environment. 
GLUT4 is enriched in the storage vesicles that continuously recycling from the cell 
membrane to an inactive location of the cytosol. GLUT4 is a protein that facilitates 
the movement of glucose into the cell (Costin et al., 2009; He et al, 2000). GLUT4 
storage vesicles (GSVs) are held in a recycling state near the cell membrane. The 
vesicles are most held in this region because Rab proteins (small GTP binding 
proteins) that interact with the motor proteins necessary to move the vesicles to the 
membrane are in inactive state (He et al., 2000). Evidence is emerging that supports 
the hypothesis that both the actin and microtubule-based cytoskeleton play a key role 
in the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in response to insulin (Costin 
et al., 2009). Furthermore cytoskeletal reorganization may connect the GLUT4 
translocation with regulating molecules of distal insulin signaling pathway. The final 
step in this signaling pathway involves the phosphorylation of protein that prevents 
the Rab from interacting with the vesicles. When the Rab proteins are no longer 
inhibited the storage vesicles can freely merge with the cell membrane. Once the 
vesicles have merged many GLUT4 proteins are embedded in the membrane and large 
quantities of glucose released into the cell by exocytosis (He et al, 2000; Costin et al., 
2009). 
Movie 6,1: Wild type C2C12 myotubes fixed on coverslips and stained with FER1L5 
antibody (affinity purified) shows the formation of cytoplasmic vacuolar structures 
through the expulsion of ball shaped stmctures containing FER1L5 from the myotube. 
Movie 6.2: Living C2C12 myotubes were incubated with and without 2mM MCD and 
imaged using Zeiss AxioVision microscopy. Images were acquired at 5 second 
intervals over a period of 60 minutes using a 20x objective and demonstrate the 
expulsion of ball shaped structures from myotubes following cholesterol depletion. 
Movie 6.3: Living C2C12 myotubes stained with Alexa 488 tagged cholera toxin were 
incubated with 2mM MCD and imaged as described for control myotubes and 
revealed the expulsion of a ball shaped structure resembling a MVB following 
cholesterol depletion by MCD treatment. 
6.3 Discussion 
In this chapter evidence is provided that differentiating C2C12 myoblast are active in 
membrane shedding. Using confocal analysis I demonstrated that the vacuolar regions 
detected in FER1L5 stained myotubes represent sites of membrane shedding. The 
vacuolar regions were detected following staining with different antibodies to 
membrane and cytoskeletal proteins and therefore they were not an artifact. By 
performing Z-series imaging of FER1L5 stained C2C12 myotubes ball shaped 
structures were shovra to be released extracellularly and showing pimctate stain for 
FER1L5 suggesting that these structures contain PERILS vesicles. Further studies 
demonstrated that dysferlin and myoferlin was also present in the shed structures and 
also in vesicular structures. 
The formation of the vacuolar regions in myotubes could be enhanced following 
cholesterol depletion and by actinomycin D induced genomic stress. Following 
cholesterol depletion multiple vacuolar regions could be detected, irregular shaped 
and closely dispersed. The shedding of the ball shaped structure was shovm to occur 
by outward budding of the myotube membrane. Live cell imaging was performed to 
confirm these findings and to obtain fiirther information on the shed structures. Living 
myotubes stained with a lipid raft stain were imaged following cholesterol depletion 
and this demonstrated that the shed structure appeared to be membrane boimd 
containing vesicular structures and also staining for the lipid raft stain. The data 
indicated that the structures resemble MVB like structures and that their formation 
may require membrane regions, which are rich in lipid rafts. To confirm that the shed 
structures were membrane bound MCD treated myotubes were stained for the proteins 
C-dystroglycan and caveolin 3 and staining was detected at the periphery of the shed 
structure. Ultrastructural studies were also performed on control and MCD treated 
myotubes to examine membrane shedding fi-om C2C12 myotubes. These experiments 
confirmed that ball shaped structures are released extracellularly by outward budding 
and that the structures contain vesicles. Evidence was also obtained that outward 
budding intermediates ready for expulsion appear to be attached to the myotube via 
membrane like protrusions. In MCD treated myotubes secondary buds emerging from 
the shed structure were observed. Membrane budding has recently been reported in 
C2C12 myotubes overexpressing the protein MG53, a muscle specific TRIM protein 
mediating in muscle membrane repair (Cai et al., 2009^ ). MG53 was shown to be 
involved in membrane budding and exocytosis through an interaction with caveolin 3 
(Cai et al., 2009''). Apart from these studies there are very few reports of membrane 
shedding in C2C12 myotubes. In one study, a lectin has been reported to be released 
extracellularly from C2C12 myotubes (Harrison and Wilson, 1992), in ball shaped 
structxires resembling those that have been described in this chapter. Moreover the 
study of Harrison and Wilson (1992) showed that the lectin could not be released by 
trypsinization and could not be elated by lactose from the surface of myotubes 
indicating that the lectin is held within stable structures. This lectin has been identified 
as galectin 1 (Gal-1) (Barondes et al., 1994). Galectin-1 is a 14 kDa carbohydrate 
binding protein family protein with an affinity for 6-galactosides (Harrison and 
Wilson, 1992; Camby et al., 2006). Gal-1 is differentially expressed by various 
normal and pathological tissues (Camby et al., 2006). Galectin-1 has been implicated 
in multiples fimctions including signaling, growth regulation, immune response and 
cell homeostasis etc (Camby et al., 2006; Gabriel et al., 2002). Galectin-1 has 
intracellular and extracellular muscle fimctions (Camby et al., 2006). Galectin-1 is 
secreted extracellularly in muscle tissue but the mechanisms are not known (Camby et 
al., 2006). The exfracellular secretion of Gal-1 is thought to occur by an 
unconventional secretory pathway similar to that proposed for FGF2 and IL16 
(Nickel, 2007) since these proteins do not contain leader sequences and by pass the 
secretory pathway. Galectin-1 knock out mice shows defects in muscle regeneration 
(Cerri et al., 2008) and galectin-1 has been shown to be secreted at high levels into the 
extracellular space from dystrophin deficient and exercised muscle (Cerri et al., 2008). 
Furthermore, these studies showed that there was significant increase in exfracellular 
Gal-1 levels (240% in relation to confrol) after BaC^ induced muscle injury in wild-
type C57BL/6 mice suggested that a potential role for Gal-1 in muscle homeostasis 
and repair (Cerri et al., 2008). This increased exfracellular expression of Gal-1 
following muscle injury was thought to regulate immune responses required for 
muscle healing. Consistent with this possibility Cerri et al., (2008) have shown 
increased Gal-1 levels, which appear to localize both inside and outside the 
sarcolemma where significant exfracellular Gal-1 was shown to colocalize with 
infilfrating CD45'  leukocytes as highlighted by a previous study by Baum et al 
(1995), where Gal-1 expression was thought to increase following inflammatory 
stimuli induced by TNFa. In the study by Cerri et al (2008) Gal-1 was considered to 
be important for leukocyte homeostasis and turnover. Gal-1 has been shown to induce 
phosphatidylserine exposure, a membrane phospholipid responsible for signaling the 
phagocytic removal of neutrophils dviring inflammatory resolution (Dias-Baruffi et al., 
2003; Karmakar et al., 2005; Stowell et al., 2007). It is not known yet the link 
between Gal-1 and neutrophil activation during muscle repair and regeneration but it 
is possible to suggest that the continued degeneration may result in sustained levels of 
proinflammatory cytokines that retain elevated Gal-1 levels or regenerating tissue may 
signal tissue to resume normal Gal-1 expression. I have performed some preliminary 
experiments which show that galectin-1 is present in the ball shaped structures that are 
released extracellularly fi-om C2C12 myotubes (data not shovm). Since Gal-1 is found 
in the extracellular space in dystrophic and exercised muscle, the ball shaped 
structures detected in myotubes may also be responsible for the extracellular secretion 
of galectin-1 fi-om muscle fibres. Since the ferlin proteins are involved in membrane 
remodelling they may be involved in the extracellular transport of galectin-1. 
GENERAL DISCUSSION 
7.1. Implications of current work 
Skeletal muscle cells are highly organized multinucleated cells, which are composed 
of the contractile apparatus, the sarcomere, surroimded by specialized membrane 
structures, which include the muscle cell membrane, the sarcolemma, which coimects 
to T-tubule membranes and a specialized endoplasmic reticulum, the sarcoplasmic 
reticulum (Towler et ai, 2004; Rossi et al, 2008). These specialized membrane 
structures undergo extensive remodeling to function in many physiological process, 
including Ca""  signaling and membrane trafficking such as GLUT4 trafficking, 
muscle membrane repair and the merging of apposed membranes during muscle 
development and regeneration (Towler et al, 2004; Antonescu et al., 2009 Dowling et 
al., 2008). Disruption of muscle cell membrane remodeling leads to defective 
membrane repair and impairs muscle regeneration and is observed in several muscle 
pathologies (Doherty et al., 2005; Han and Campbell, 2007; Glover and Brown, 
2007). The proteins involved in the remodeling of muscle membranes are beginning to 
be identified and include dysferlin and myoferlin, which belong to the ferlin protein 
family (Bansal et al., 2003; Doherty et al., 2003; Doherty et al., 2005; Doherty et al., 
2008; Han and Campbell, 2007; Glover and Brown, 2007). Dysferlin has been shown 
to be linked with many types of muscular dystrophies cind cardiomyopathy, which are 
characterized by defective muscle membrane repair (Bansal et al., 2003: Han et al., 
2007). Myoferlin has a role in myogenesis and is required for the development of 
mature muscle fibres. Myoferlin null mice are impaired in the formation of mature 
myofibers. Myoferlin has been implicated in the merging of membranes at muscle cell 
fusion sites and also in membrane recycling (Doherty et al., 2005; Bematchez et al., 
2007). 
In this thesis I have shown that FER1L5, a novel ferlin most similar to dysferlin and 
myoferlin, has a role in muscle membrane fiision. My findings are summarized below. 
7.1.1 FER1L5 is found in distinct vesicles in C2C12 cells 
This was shown by biochemical fi-actionation and immunolabelling. Although present 
in distinct vesicles, FER1L5 vesicles are similar to dysferlin and myoferlin vesicles. 
The identity of the FER1L5 vesicles is not known but FER1L5 is not localized to 
conventional organelles nor other vesicles involved in muscle membrane fusion. No 
colocalization of FER1L5 with the T-tubule marker Bin 1 was observed in C2C12 
cells. Dysferlin is proposed to be present in vesicles, which are derived from T-tubules 
(KJinge et al, 2007). The distribution of FER1L5 in adult human muscle is being 
examined and the preliminary data indicate that FER1L5 and myoferlin are localized 
to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This underlined data suggests that the origin of the 
vesicles involved in muscle membrane fiasion vesicles are derived from the 
specialized membranes. 
7.1.2 P E R I L S is required for C2C12 myoblast fusion 
Following inhibition of FER1L5 the formation of large myotubes is impaired. I also 
observed strong FER1L5 staining at membrane fusion sites of myoblasts. My data 
suggest that FER1L5 has a role in membrane merging of apposed myoblast-myoblast 
membranes. FER1L5 is predicted to operate upstream from dysferlin and myoferlin in 
membrane merging. A model depicting the proposed role of FER1L5 in myoblast 
fiision is shown in Figure 7.L 
7.1.3 FER1L5 mediates in muscle membrane repair 
This is the first dysferlin related protein that has been implicated in membrane repair. 
It was not possible during my study to examine the trafficking of FER1L5 following 
membrane injury. It is not known whether FER1L5 concenfrates at membrane wound 
site as shown for dysferlin. At present we don't know whether FER1L5 operates in the 
dysferlin repair pathway. The distribution and expression of FER1L5 in dysferlin 
deficient muscle is currently being examined. C2C12 cell lines deficient for dysferlin 
are being characterized in the laboratory. In fiature studies stable cell lines expressing 
FER1L5 shRNA plasmids will be generated and through these studies the precise role 
of FER1L5 in membrane repair and its relationship with dysferlin wi l l be examined. 
Through these studies we will be able to determine whether FER1L5 is a therapeutic 
target for the dysferlinopathies. 
7.1.4 Evidence of membrane shedding in differentiating C2C12 cells 
Another interesting finding from my study is that muscle cells are active in membrane 
shedding. I have provided evidence that C2C12 myotubes release MVB like structures 
extracellularly and that these structures contain dysferlin, myoferlin and FER1L5

Figure 7.1. The basic events in mammalian myoblast fusion. Muscle is formed of 
bundles of myofibres. Myofibres are formed by fusion of myoblasts to form 
multinucleated myotube. These increase in size by additional myoblast fusion. There 
are two phases, first phase is formation of myofibres by myoblast/myoblast fusion and 
the second phase is the maturation of myofibres, which occurs by myoblast/myotube 
fusion. Both phases are essential for muscle regeneration and repair. The proteins, 
which are involved in the different stages during muscle development, are shown in 
bold letters (Richardson et al., 2008). The data obtained for FER1L5 during C2C12 
fusion suggests that this ferlin is involved in the first phase of myotube formation. 
Since dysferlin and myoferlin concentrate at sites of myoblast/myotube membrane 
fusion these ferlins are predicted to function in the second phase of myotube 
development. 
vesicles. Ultrastructural studies have confirmed that MVB like structures are released 
extracellularly and fiirther structural information has been obtained. My work suggests 
that these structures may be involved in the secretion of cytokines. I am proposing that 
these structures are required for the exfracellular secretion of cytokines that bypass the 
secretory pathway, for example Gal 1 and ILIB. These cytokines were shown to be 
present in the MVB like structures by immunolabelling. There is evidence that 
extracellular secretion of the cytokines from muscle is important for muscle 
regeneration and repafr (De Rossi et al., 2000; Hirata et al., 2003; Pelosi et al, 2007; 
Chiu et al., 2009). Currently, this is an exciting area of research. The group led by 
Gillian Butler-Brown have shown that differentiating human myoblasts are active in 
exfracellular protein secretion (Institute of Myology Newsletter, July 2009, "Are 
secreted microvesicles a novel mechanism of communication for skeletal muscle?", 
Columbia University, New York). Proteomics analysis of condifioned media 
identified 965 non-redundant proteins, which were secreted. 27% of these were 
proteins, were secreted extracellularly via the ER/Golgi secretion pathway, 85 of 
which were extracellular matrix components. Several other proteins that bypass the 
secretory pathway were also identified, including Gal-1. The work suggests that 
proteins secreted through microvesicles are required for communication in skeletal 
muscle. This work supports my data and opens up an exciting new area of fiirther 
research which will be discussed below. 
7.2 Future research on P E R I L S 
In vitro studies 
1) Generating stable cell lines deficient for FER1L5 to mediate the mechanism by 
which FER1L5 operates in myoblast fusion and membrane repair. 
2) Investigating the nuclear distribution of ferlins during myoblast fiision. 
 Do they colocalize with myogenin? 
 Is myogenic signaling disrupted in the absence of these ferlins? 
3) Examining FER1L5 expression in dysferlin deficient C2C12 muscle cells. 
4) Characterization of the FER1L5 promoter. 
5) Identification of interacting proteins. 
In vivo studies 
1) Generation of a FER1L5 knock out mice to determine whether the mice 
develop a muscle phenotype and whether it is linked with muscular 
dystrophy or myogenesis or another phenotype. 
2) Generation of transgenic mice overexpressing FER1L5. This model will allow 
us to study whether FERl L5 is a therapeutic target in muscular dystrophy. 
7.3 Future research on extracellular secretion of galectin-1 and I L I B from 
muscle cells 
1) Determine i f muscle fibres release MVB like structures. 
2) Examine the expression and distribution of Gal 1 and IL16 
 During myoblast fusion 
 During muscle membrane repair. 
 In regenerating muscle eg SJL/J and myoferlin null mice. 
 In dystrophic muscle and in muscle subjected to eccentric exercise.

(iii) MyoferUn siRNA studies in C2C12 ceUs. 
Western blot showing the different levels of myoferlin expression in the C2C12 cells 
transfected with myoferlin siRNA plasmids fi-om Himian and mouse (C) and Human 
(D) constructs respectively (See section 2.9.1). Seven independent single cell colonies 
(CI-4; Dl-3) were selected for western analysis. Reduction or no signal was observed 
in the myoferlin expression levels in some of these clones. Clone D l was further 
propagated for fiision index analysis (Chapter V). Controls; scrambled siRNA and 
wild type (no siRNA) showed immunoreactivity to myoferlin antibody. Actin was 
used to show the equal loading.
